    "abstractText": "The aim of the study is to investigate psychosocial factors that are associated with positive and negative coping with stress, as well as with worries about and perceived threat by COVID-19 to enable us to provide adequate support for oldest-old individuals. A paper\u2013pencil-based survey assessed COVID-19 worries and perceived threat, depression, anxiety, somatization, social support, loneliness, resilience, positive and negative coping in a sample of n = 197 oldest-old individuals (78\u2013100 years). Linear multivariate and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Individuals with high levels of resilience were more likely to feel self-efficient when coping with stress. High levels of depression, anxiety and loneliness were associated with feeling more helpless when coping with stress. However, oldest-old individuals who felt lonely also experienced situations where they felt competent in stress coping. Being male and experiencing high levels of social support was more likely associated with high levels of worries due to COVID-19. Increased age and higher levels of depression were associated with lower levels of perceived personal threat, whereas higher somatization scores were more likely associated with higher perceived personal threat. Findings suggest that mental health factors may shape the way oldest-old individuals cope with pandemic-related stress. Resilience might be an important factor to take into account when targeting an improvement in positive coping with stress. Oldest-old individuals who have higher levels of depression, anxiety and feel lonely may be supported by adapting their coping skill repertoire to reduce the feeling of helplessness when coping with stress.",

            "text": "In Germany, the first case of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by the SARS-Cov-2 was reported in January 2020. The outbreak of the disease was closely followed by strict mass quarantine measures by the government trying to curb the spread of the disease. The elderly population was identified as high risk group for a severe course of disease\nand high mortality (Robert Koch Institute 2020; Verity et\u00a0al. 2020). Multiple sources of problems arose especially for the elderly, like fear of infection with the virus, social distancing and isolation, worries about the health of loved ones and worries about the uncertain course of the pandemic, potentially causing high psychological distress (Taylor et\u00a0al. 2020).\nIn the beginning of the pandemic, first studies suggested that the older people\u2019s mental health remained roughly stable with some people reporting having high levels of perceived threat (R\u00f6hr et\u00a0al. 2020). What we do not know yet, and this is important since experiencing distress because of the pandemic is associated with a higher risk for developing mental health problems (Schnell & Krampe 2020), is how the oldest-old population experiences the pandemic and how they feel when coping with pandemic-related stress.\nWe know from previous studies with adults that the way one copes with adverse and challenging events like the COVID-19 pandemic is important for one\u2019s general mental well-being (Lopez et\u00a0al. 2020; Tom\u00e1s et\u00a0al. 2012). There is\nResponsible Editor: Morten Wahrendorf.\nMelanie Luppa and Steffi G. Riedel-Heller have contributed equally to this work.\n* Sina Kathrin Gerhards sina.gerhards@medizin.uni-leipzig.de\n1 Medical Faculty, Institute of\u00a0Social Medicine, Occupational Health and\u00a0Public Health (ISAP), University of\u00a0Leipzig, Philipp-Rosenthal-Stra\u00dfe 55, 04103\u00a0Leipzig, Germany\n2 Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI), Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland\n1 3\nalso research showing that anxiety and depression are linked with a more dysfunctional way of dealing with COVIDrelated stress in an adult sample of 18\u201376-year-old people (Kar et\u00a0al. 2021). Furthermore, higher levels of mental distress, e.g. depression and anxiety, are associated with more negative ways of coping with stress (Li et\u00a0al. 2012; Orgeta & Orrell 2014; Raut et\u00a0al. 2014), which in turn is associated with poorer cognitive functioning (Aggarwal et\u00a0al. 2014; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2007) and higher risk for dementia (Wilson et\u00a0al. 2007). Positive coping on the other hand is associated with lower levels of anxiety, hopelessness and loneliness (Oles et\u00a0al. 2014), leading to better brain health (ArenazaUrquijo et\u00a0al., 2020). Those findings stress the importance to investigate how the oldest-old population deals with the pandemic-related stress, but to our knowledge, it has not yet been explored in the German oldest-old population.\nA factor that may be associated with a positive way to cope with COVID-19-related stress is the extent of perceived resilience. Studies have shown that resilience is positively related to adaptive, active coping strategies that in turn lead to less perceived distress and lower cortisol levels (Smith et\u00a0al. 2016; Vannini et\u00a0al. 2021). With increased age resilience might increase since the older individual has more life experience in mastering challenging events (Hardy et\u00a0al. 2004; Welzel et\u00a0al. 2021).\nIn the current study, we aim to close this existing gap in literature by examining the association of sociodemographic variables, mental well-being, loneliness, social support and resilience with positive and negative coping with stress and with COVID-19-specific worries and perceived personal threat by the virus, with the overall aim to identify mental and social health factors that make an individual of old-age specifically vulnerable. This knowledge will not only help during the ongoing pandemic but also enable us to support the very old population in coping with general adverse life events that they have to face with increased age, for example the loss of close ones. Deduced from the before mentioned literature, we assume\n\u2022 that oldest-old participants with higher depression and anxiety scores show higher ratings on the negative coping scale that is feeling more helpless when coping with stress and lower ratings on the positive, self-efficient coping scale, and \u2022 that higher perceived resilience is associated with less negative, helpless coping with stress and more positive, self-efficient coping with stress due to the pandemic in the oldest-old population.\nThe associations of sociodemographic characteristics and social health factors with perceived coping ability (positive and negative), as well as the associations with experienced\ndistress (worries and perceived personal threat) due to the pandemic are investigated exploratively."

The items can be answered using a five-point Likert scale (\u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery strongly\u201d, scored 1 to 5). The Brief Symptom Inventory has proven to have good psychometric properties (Franke et\u00a0al. 2017). In our study, the subscales show good reliability with Cronbach\u2019s alphas of \u03b1 = 0.70 for the somatization scale, \u03b1 = 0.73 for the anxiety scale and \u03b1 = 0.77 for the depression scale.\nThe German Version of the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI-D; Kendel et\u00a0al. 2011) was used to assess the subjective experience of social support and consists of five items that can be rated on a five-point Likert scale\n1 3\n(\u201cnever\u201d, \u201cseldom\u201d, \u201csometimes\u201d, \u201coften\u201d, \u201calways\u201d; scored 1 to 5). Mean scores were calculated with higher scores indicating higher social support. In the current study, the scale shows very good reliability with a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of \u03b1 = 0.90.\nTo measure loneliness, the three-item version of the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3) was used (Russell et\u00a0al., 1980). Three items can be rated on a four-point Likert scale (\u201coften\u201d, \u201csometimes\u201d, \u201cseldom\u201d, \u201cnever\u201d, scored 0 to 3). Mean scores were calculated for further analysis. The scale has shown good internal consistency as well as discriminant and concurrent validity (Hughes et\u00a0al., 2004). The scale shows good reliability (\u03b1 = 0.76) in our study as well.\nResilience was measured by the validated German version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS; Chmitorz et\u00a0al. 2018). Six items that can be rated on a five-point Likert scale from \u201ctotally disagree to \u201ctotally agree\u201d assessed the person\u2019s ability to rally from stress, respective resilience. To reduce response bias in terms of social desirability, three items of the questionnaire are negatively and three items positively worded. To quantify resilience, the mean score of all items was calculated with higher scores indicating higher resilience. Principal component analyses supported the bi-factorial structure of the questionnaire as previously described by Chmitorz et\u00a0al. (2018). In line with the author\u2019s suggestion, we estimated and adjusted for a method factor. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha in our study is \u03b1 = 0.84."

Principal component analysis confirmed the two-dimensional factor structure of the questionnaire that was described in previous studies (Leung et\u00a0al. 2010). One factors includes the item \u201cIn the last month, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?\u201d and \u201cIn the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?\u201d. The other factor includes the item \u201cIn the last month, how often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?\u201d and \u201cIn the last month, how often have you felt that things were going your way?\u201d. The first factor is measuring the ability to cope with stress in a positive, self-effective way (here: \u201cpositive coping\u201d), and the second factor is assessing the negative affective component of coping with stress resulting in helplessness (here: \u201cnegative coping\u201d; the description of the factors is in line with previous research, e.g. Bastianon et\u00a0al. 2020). The Perceived Stress Scale has shown good\nreliability (Kunzler et\u00a0al. 2018; Leung et\u00a0al. 2010; Warttig et\u00a0al. 2013). The scale shows acceptable reliability in our study with a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of \u03b1 = 0.65 for the positive subscale and \u03b1 = 0.66 for the negative subscale.\nParticipants were asked single item questions that were directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and specifically created for the purpose of the study assessing general worries about the COVID-19 pandemic and the perceived threat by COVID-19. Items were phrased as statements (\u201cI am worried about the coronavirus\u201d, \u201cI feel personally threatened by the coronavirus\u201d) and were rated on a five-point Likert scale (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d, scored 0 to 4). Scores were classified as low (score between 0 and 2) or high (score of 3 or 4)."

First, descriptive statistics for all sociodemographic, psychosocial and COVID-related parameters were calculated. To identify gender differences, Chi-square (x2) tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann\u2013Whitney) tests were calculated for all sociodemographic and psychosocial variables, as well as variables concerning worries about and perceived personal threat by COVID-19. In a next step, two linear multivariate regression models were conducted to predict positive coping with stress and negative coping with stress by including sociodemographic factors, somatization, depression, anxiety, social support, loneliness and resilience in the models. The scale\u2019s residual distributions were inspected with skewness and kurtosis values within the acceptable ranges (skewness between \u2212\u00a02 and + 2; kurtosis between -7 and\u2014+ 7, see e.g. Cohen et\u00a0al. 2002). Furthermore, two binary logistic regression models were fitted to assess associations of sociodemographic characteristics, somatization, depression, anxiety, social support, loneliness and resilience with worries about COVID-19 and perceived threat by COVID-19. The variables included in the models were continuous, except for gender (male in reference to female), marital status (single/ divorced, widowed in reference to married), living situation (living alone in reference to living with partner or other), education (categorized according to Comparative Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations/CASMIN classification as middle, high in reference to low). For the linear multivariate regression models predicting positive and negative coping with stress, we additionally reported standardized beta values ( ) to allow for direct comparison between the variables. We used clustered standard errors to account for heteroscedasticity across the observations since participants originally came\u00a0from different studies. Most important sample size criteria for conducting the regression analyses were met. With an assumed R2 of 0.15, a statistical power of 0.8\n1 3\nand a significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05, one would need a sample size of n = 110 for our models. With an assumed R2 of 0.10, one would need a sample size of n = 162. With n = 182 for the coping with stress model and n = 177 for the model predicting worries and perceived threat due to COVID-19, we fulfilled this criterion."

            "text": "Resilience had the highest effect on positive coping with stress in our sample of the very old population, and this supports our hypothesis that high perceived resilience is associated with more positive coping. This is also in line with previous findings that suggest that resilience plays an important role in adaptive coping and feeling competent and self-efficient in coping with stress (Tagay et\u00a0al. 2016; Vannini et\u00a0al. 2021). This further underlines the importance to include resilience training in interventions targeting selfefficient coping and, consequently, better mental health in the very old population during the pandemic.\nWhen taking a closer look at negative coping resulting in a feeling of helplessness, anxiety and depression may be important factors to look at. Participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression were also more likely to feel helpless in their stress coping more often than participants with lower anxiety and depression levels. This supports our hypothesis that high depression and anxiety levels are associated with more negative, helpless coping. Since feeling hopeless and helpless is one of the features of depression, this feeling seems to reflect on the perceived competence in coping with stress. Our finding is also consistent with the findings of the review by Li et\u00a0al. (2012) who found that anxiety and depression are linked to more dysfunctional coping strategies. Kar and colleagues (Kar et\u00a0al. 2021) found that anxiety and depression are linked to a struggle to cope with stress due to COVID-19 properly as well. At this point, we also need to consider the phenomenon of reversed causality. People with high depressive symptom levels seem to feel more helpless when coping with stress during the pandemic and perceive helplessness when coping with stress also predisposes to developing more depressive symptoms as they do not have suitable coping strategies. This can also result in a vicious circle of unsuitable coping strategies and depression or general mental distress. It is important to give this vulnerable group of oldest-old people, especially when already dealing with depressive symptoms, specific tools to improve their self-efficacy in coping with stress and thereby improve their mental health in the long run.\nOur findings did not support our assumption that high depression and anxiety levels are associated with less perceived positive, self-efficient coping. We did not find significant associations of those factors. Furthermore, our model predicting negative coping explained twice as much variance in percent as did the model predicting positive coping with stress during the pandemic. It seems to be the case that the included psychosocial factors, more specifically depression, anxiety, somatization, social support, loneliness and resilience, are more crucial for the feeling of helplessness in coping with stress during the pandemic than for a positive, self-efficient way of coping. Anxiety, depression and\nloneliness are linked to a negative way of coping with stress but other factors seem to be important for the perception whether one feels self-efficient when coping. Those two concepts do not seem to be opposite sides of a coin but rather independent concepts that are influenced by different factors. Future studies should focus on potential influencing factors of positive, self-efficient coping with stress during critical times like the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that resilience is associated with more perceived positive coping but not with less perceived negative coping also stresses the previous interpretation that we have two separate, distinct factors and not opposite poles of one dimension and that there must be more factors influencing it.\nLoneliness is associated with both higher levels of positive and negative coping. Those two constructs are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The questionnaire assesses how often they felt either self-efficient or helpless in coping with stress during the last month. It seems that people who felt particularly lonely often felt helpless but at the same time experience situation where they felt self-efficient in stress coping. This could be due to the nature of problems and associated settings. While a person can feel very competent in coping with problems that they had in the past and/or have specific coping strategies for, there might be situations that are rather new and one has to adapt their coping strategy to a new setting, initially resulting in a feeling of helplessness. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it could suggest that a strategy once including social contacts cannot be used due to the quarantine measures. More research is needed to clarify this finding and to investigate the psychological effects of the pandemic over its course and after a longer period of time."

            "text": "Contrary to some existing literature (Yu et\u00a0al. 2020), our results indicate that social support may be associated with increased worries about COVID-19. At first glance, this seems contra-intuitive but when taking a closer look at the item wording you can see that the question regarding worries refers to more general worries about COVID-19, also concerning others. A possible explanation is that people who have more social support also have more social contacts resulting in having more persons to worry about (e.g. the grandchildren\u2019s education, financial problems of children, higher risk for severe course of disease of friends and so on). That worries concern mostly others and not the older persons themselves is something that has been found in previous studies as well (Kuehner et\u00a0al. 2020; Vannini et\u00a0al. 2021). Thus, we suggest that social support can be a protective factor for distress in the very old population but in times of a pandemic having more loved ones might be associated with more worries about them and their future. Moreover,\n1 3\nmen may\u00a0tend to worry more about COVID-19 compared to women. This is in contrary to some studies\u2019 findings that women experience more stress due to COVID-19 (Hou et\u00a0al. 2020) but may be explained partially by the higher mortality risk of men, and thus higher risk, when infected with the corona-virus (Barber & Kim 2021). Further studies are needed to clarify this finding.\nAlthough the objective risk for a severe course of disease increases with higher age, our findings indicate that with increased age, individuals tend to experience less personal threat by COVID-19. Oldest-old individuals may feel that they have already lived their life and worry more about others than themselves which would be in line with studies suggesting that worries focus on others and less on the individual\u2019s own health (Kuehner et\u00a0al. 2020; Vannini et\u00a0al. 2021). Higher levels of depression were associated with less perceived personal threat which is in line with finding that suggest that the nature of worries in depressive patients is more about the future, relationships and alike and less about personal physical harm (Diefenbach et\u00a0al. 2001). Furthermore, there was a slightly higher chance of perceiving high personal threat when experiencing higher levels of somatization, which may hint to the fact that mental health factors influence the way one perceives the circumstance of the current pandemic.\nThe percentage of variance explained by the models is rather small, indicating that there are other factors substantially influencing the extent of distress due to COVID-19. Factors that might be worth exploring in future studies are personality characteristics like optimism or previous medical history."

            "text": "While this study has several advantages like being one of the first studies that specifically investigates coping with stress in the high-risk group of the oldest-old population, there are some limitations, which need to be taken into account. Since we analyzed cross-sectional data, it is not possible to make statements about the causal direction of the association of included psychosocial variables and COVID-19-specific worries and perceived threat, positive and negative coping. Another factor worth mentioning is that most of the previous studies investigated specific coping strategies as opposed to the feeling of competence or incompetence in coping with stress as we do in our study. This makes comparing our findings directly with others challenging. Nevertheless, this understanding of the concept also brings advantages since we aimed to specifically investigate which factors influence the feeling of competence or incompetence when coping with stress regardless of specific strategies since the use and their benefits are highly individual (Bonanno & Burton 2013). One could argue that the extent of worries and\nperceived threat by COVID-19 plays a role in the way one feels when coping with stress. Sensitivity analysis showed that there is no significant contribution of those variables to explained variance in the before mentioned outcomes. Furthermore, we used a rather unusual sampling strategy but we see a strong advantage of it. The sample investigated in this study is unique and more challenging to win over to taking part in surveys or studies in general, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This sampling technique gave us the opportunity to investigate the sample of oldest-old people who have a high risk for a severe course of disease and are more likely to agree in taking part in the survey since they have taken part in our studies before compared to other oldest-old people. We also have a response rate of 52.12%. This is in line with the previous reasoning that this group is specifically difficult to win over for study participation. Nevertheless, there are no differences in age (t = 0.825, p = 0.410) nor gender (x2 = 0.702, p = 0.402) between responders (n = 197) and non-responders (n = 181). We also did not assess whether participants were chronically ill or in treatment but would argue that the vast majority of elderly people visits their general practitioner regularly due to some kind of illness (Linden et\u00a0al. 1996). Still, this should be taken into account in future studies to be able to rule out the influence. Furthermore, we would like to note at this point that we chose to dichotomize the COVID-related worries and threat items in order to calculate a binary regression model. For an ordinal regression analysis due to originally ordinal item structure, the proportional odds assumption was not fulfilled and more complex models (e.g. generalized ordered logit models) with a requirement of larger sample sizes would have been required. Although we meet the most important sample size criteria for conducting regression analysis, we still have a rather small sample size and further research with bigger samples is needed."

Our findings show that in the group of the oldest-old people those with higher anxiety and depression levels are particularly vulnerable to feeling helpless in coping with stress and thus, those factors should be targeted in interventions aiming to improve coping skills in the oldestold population. It seems to be especially important to also aim at boosting resilience to further trigger and strengthen the feeling of self-efficacy and competence in stress coping as it is crucial for improving and maintaining mental health\n1 3\nin the very old individuals who feel burdened by the current COVID-19 pandemic. People who feel lonely should be supported in adapting their coping skill repertoire. Generally, mental health factors like depression may influence and shape the way older individuals experience distress due to the current pandemic. The current study\u2019s findings elicit interesting starting points for future research aiming at maintaining and improving mental health in the very old population in times of public health crises and generally, in challenging and demanding situations that occur especially and more frequent with increased age.\nAcknowledgements This work was supported by the Hans and Ilse Breuer Foundation.
