1. **Investigate the use of different data augmentation techniques:** The paper uses a variety of data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, shearing, and zooming, to improve the accuracy of the CNN models. Future research could explore the use of additional data augmentation techniques, such as color jittering, elastic transformations, and mixup, to further improve the accuracy of the models.


2. **Apply the proposed approach to other medical imaging tasks:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach for brain tumor classification. Future research could apply the approach to other medical imaging tasks, such as lung cancer detection, breast cancer detection, and diabetic retinopathy detection, to evaluate its generalizability.


3. **Develop a more interpretable model:** The paper does not provide any insights into the decision-making process of the CNN models. Future research could develop a more interpretable model, such as a rule-based model or a decision tree, to provide explanations for the predictions made by the model.


4. **Explore the use of transfer learning:** The paper does not explore the use of transfer learning, which is a technique for transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to a new model. Future research could explore the use of transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the CNN models.


5. **Develop a real-time brain tumor detection system:** The paper does not discuss the development of a real-time brain tumor detection system. Future research could develop a real-time system that can be used to detect brain tumors in real-time, which could be useful for clinical applications.
