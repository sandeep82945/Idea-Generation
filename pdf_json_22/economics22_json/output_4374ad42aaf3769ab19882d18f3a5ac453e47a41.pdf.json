    "abstractText": "Several strategies are used by researchers and research facilities to increase their scientific production and consequent research quality. Bibliometric records show that coauthorship and the number of participating organizations in research publications are steadily increasing; however, the effect of collaboration varies across disciplines, and the corresponding author\u2019s country appears to influence research impact. This finding inspired our research question for this study: How does international cooperation affect scientific impact, and does the affiliation of corresponding authors influence citation impact indicators at the level of individual publications? To this end, we provide a comparative evaluation of research articles published in Q1 journals among Visegrad Group countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) in Medical and Health sciences between 2017 and 2021. The study investigates the relationship between collaboration type (national vs. international) and scientific impact (impact factor of the journal and category normalized citation impact or research papers), as well as the impact of the country of the corresponding author\u2019s affiliation on quantitative quality of individual papers. We show that Q1 research papers in international collaboration have a higher scientific impact than papers published in national partnerships. Moreover, the corresponding authors\u2019 country of affiliation significantly affects scientific impact.",

            "text": "The publication pattern of researchers is significantly changing, resulting in a sharp increase in the total number of publications each year [1]. According to Bornamm et al. (2015) [2], the global scientific publication output shows an annual growth rate of ~3%. The increasing availability of digital data on scholarly publishing and consequent indicators\u2014 number of papers, measurement of scientific impact, coauthorship, national and international collaborations, analysis of affiliations\u2014offers the opportunity to analyse the patterns of scientific publication and its relationship to scientific impact [3]. Scientific impact indicators play a prominent role in evaluating scientific output [4], and researchers consider them when using the appropriate journal for publishing [5]. The Journal Impact Factor (JIF) from the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) (Clarivate Analytics) is one of the most frequently used scientific indicators to evaluate research performance. Because of the incomparability within different research areas and scientific fields, JIF quartiles have been introduced and used to evaluate research output [4,6]. JIF quartiles are calculated for each journal in a given subject category and reflect the journal\u2019s impact factor distribution. To this end, journals can be divided into four quartiles: Q1 represents the top 25% impact factor distribution; Q2\nPublications 2022, 10, 35. https://doi.org/10.3390/publications10040035 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/publications\nPublications 2022, 10, 35 2 of 13\nthe middle-high position, between 25\u201350%; Q3 the middle-low distribution, between 50 to TOP 75%; and Q4 the lowest position (bottom 25%) [5]. JIF provides quick information on the impact and prestige of a journal where researchers publish; moreover, from the perspective of researchers, publication in highly ranked journals provides not only recognition but plays a crucial role in the performance-based funding of public research [5,7]. However, scholars also argue that JIF is not an appropriate measurement for the prestige or performance of individual papers as the JIF is calculated for the journals, not for the published papers [8,9]. Thus, in bibliometric research, it is also usual to calculate papers\u2019 performance based on the citations they receive, and researchers can benchmark papers\u2019 impact by field-weighted citation impact (FWCI) or category normalized citation impact (CNCN) that considers not just the number of citations but also citation trends in a given discipline [10,11]. In our current research, we measure papers\u2019 impacts through journal prestige (quartiles and JIF) and category normalized citation impact (CNCN). International collaborations are thought to be excellent means to improve the quality of scientific research and the resulting scientific output. In particular, scholars have shown that internationally coauthored research papers have a significantly higher impact than their counterparts prepared in national collaboration [12,13]. The prestige of institutions is closely related to the quantity and quality of research papers, and faculties at prestigious institutions tend to have more scientific outputs, receive more citations and obtain more scientific awards [14]. The driving forces beyond research internationalization and international copublication from the perspective of individual organizations are findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability [15\u201317]. However, at the level of researchers, international collaborations are motivated by an increased proportion of research papers in high-quality journals, greater research impact, increased reputation of the organization, higher visibility and opportunities for multidisciplinary research, as well a better chance to obtain funding for further research projects [18\u201321]. International collaborations are on the rise. However, there is an existing gap in knowledge production and scientific impact between high- and low-income countries [22]. The US, UK, Canada, Australia and Europe have a remarkably high scientific output (Bornmann et al., 2011; Cash-Gibson et al., 2018). China is in a special position, as in terms of research production it is catching up with\u2014or in some fields, even surpassing\u2014the US, but in terms of citations, it still lags behind the Euro-American hub [23]. However, as measured in Scimago Country Rankings, China receives more citations than the US, primarily because of the huge number of publications and self-citations. In contrast, the average number of citations/document is still considerably lower in China than in the US and in most European countries. North America and Europe receive 42.3% and 35.3% of the world\u2019s citations, respectively [24], and the cumulative citation inequalities are on the rise across natural sciences, medical sciences and agricultural sciences [25]. For instance, based on the Scimago Journal Rankings in the Medicine subject area, Europe and the United States published 477,669 (30.75%) and 296,782 (19.11%) research papers and received 726,466 (37.51%) and 365,203 (18.85%) citations, respectively. To this end, international collaboration can be particularly important for developing and low-income countries. Exemplarily, low-income nations are more likely to form international collaborations than researchers from wealthier countries. The most frequent international collaborating partners of low-income and lowermiddle-income countries are researchers from the USA, China, Germany and France [26]. The scientific world is divided into the \u2018haves\u2019 (or the industrialized world) and the \u2018have nots\u2019 (or the developing world), and at least five different concepts must be taken into account when talking about research collaboration and research output: (1) science itself, (2) publishers, (3) the role of nation states, (4) world power structures and (5) the research themselves. Countries beyond the Western world are typically held to be disadvantaged when it comes to scholarly publications, especially in their representation in top-tier international journals. Moreover, as the \u201cMatthew effect for countries\u201d phenomenon suggests, already successful countries can further raise their advantages over the underrepresented\nPublications 2022, 10, 35 3 of 13\nregions by receiving more research funds, brain drain and a possible bias toward research conducted at elite universities [27]. Indeed, the gap between the \u2018haves\u2019 and the \u2018have nots\u2019 is constantly widening, reflected in the existing disparity of scientific research papers in top journals [25,28]. However, the world\u2019s share of scientific publications\u2014the top 1 and top 10% most highly cited scientific publications\u2014show remarkable differences also among developed (high-income) countries. According to the Science, Research and Innovation Performance of the EU 2020 report [29], the EU and China are the global leaders in scientific output (number of research papers), and the United States is the leader in scientific impact (citations). Although the EU remains in the leading position regarding the share of scientific research papers worldwide in 2018, a positive correlation was found between the scientific quality and investment cost in EU countries. Thus, strong differences persist between European countries\u2019 performance. For example, whilst the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxemburg provided 15.3, 15.1, and 13.7% of the top 10% most highly cited scientific publications in 2016, the Visegrad Group countries were characterized by 6.2% (Hungary), 5.2% (Poland), 5.1% (Czech Republic) and 5.0% (Slovakia). This tendency is also captured at the level of top 1% scientific outputs, being 1.57%, 1.56% and 1.35% for the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium, and 0.72 (Slovakia), 0.44% (Hungary), 0.39% (Czech Republic) and 0.29% (Poland) for the Visegrad Group countries. As part of the higher education transformation, scientific performance and quality of scientific research have changed since the 2000s. In the Visegrad Group (V4) countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland), the academic structure follows the CentralEastern European model, and the European trends in science are increasingly visible. The 2000s witnessed a transformation of higher education systems in the region under the process of Europeanization [30]. This transformation includes an increasing struggle for regional research and higher education internationalization. Universities and research institutions started to follow policies emphasizing the importance of international excellence, measured by global university rankings [31]. Consequently, international collaboration and publishing in indexed international journals became mandatory in many research universities in Central and Eastern Europe [32]. However, not all V4 countries collaborate at the same level. According to SzuflitaZ\u0307urawska and Basin\u0301sk (2021) [33], whilst Poland is the most productive of the V4 countries in terms of publication output and citation between 2010 and 2019, Hungary is a leader among V4 countries in international scientific collaborations. Our goal is to provide the first up-to-date cross-country comparison of publication performance of the V4 countries in the light of national and international collaboration. As medical scientific research has become increasingly global, cross-national and collaborative, we performed a field-specific analysis of publication outputs among all four V4 countries. Input data for the OECD 3 Medical and Health Sciences category were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection and Web of Science InCites database between 2017 and 2021. First, we focused on the publication activity of the V4 countries with special attention to papers published in Q1\u2013Q4 JIF quartile journals. Next, we analysed the scientific impact of articles published in Q1 journals as a function of collaboration type (e.g., research output in national or international collaboration). In addition, for all V4 countries we evaluated the scientific impact of internationally coauthored research papers in Q1 journals by considering the affiliate country of corresponding authors. In terms of practical application, our approach can highlight how the research output and scientific impact are affected by national and international collaborations in V4 countries."

With this approach, the InCites database allowed us to download seven different data sheets for all countries: (1) all records, (2) domestic collaborations, (3) international collaborations, (4\u20137) Q1\u2013Q4 JIF quartile. The accession number of research papers was used to obtain data from the WoS database. All derived data for V4 countries (Czech Republic, CZ; Hungary, HU; Slovakia, SK; Poland, PL) were aggregated into separate spreadsheets and aligned with the structure of downloaded datasets. The final four datasheets contained the following data used for further investigation: cooperation type (national or international collaboration), JIF, category normalized citation impact (CNCN), the JIF quartile (Q1\u2013 Q4), as well as the affiliation country of the corresponding author. When more than one corresponding author was included in the datasheet, the affiliation of the first corresponding author was used. Research papers with one author were not included in the study. For qualitative analysis of research outputs, the total number of research articles and the proportion of research papers in national and international collaboration were calculated for all Q1\u2013Q4 quartiles for all V4 countries. As a next step, we used the JIF [34] and category normalized citation impact (CNCI) [35] as indicators of scientific impact. The median values of JIF and CNCI were calculated for national and international collaborations, plotted against V4 countries and within the countries against Q1\u2013Q4 JIF quartile. The affiliation of the corresponding authors was observed for each international Q1 research paper. Based on the number of research papers, we selected the top 10 collaborating countries for each V4 country and calculated the median number of JIF and CNCI for each collaborating region. Before any pairwise statistical analysis and correlation, each measurement\u2019s normality was assessed using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. In all cases, normal distribution was rejected. Therefore we selected U Mann\u2013Whitney nonparametric test to compare pairwise groups statistically. Statistical analysis and data visualizations were performed using Origin Pro 2022 (Student version) and JMP (R) Pro data analysis and graphing software."

Therefore, as an additional indicator, we used the category normalized citation impact (CNCI) as a standard indicator reflecting the observed and expected citation count ratio [37].

As the corresponding author is usually the principal owner of the research results from the perspective of intellectual property [40,41], their affiliation was used as a baseline for further analysis. To this end, for each Q1 paper published in international collaboration, we collected the country affiliation for each corresponding author [42] and demonstrated how the top 10 affiliated countries influence scientific impact. The paper counts for analysed countries for all V4 nations are summarized in Table 4.\nDuring 2017\u20132021, 10,607 papers were analysed: 2934 for the Czech Republic, 2335 for Hungary, 4736 for Poland and 602 for Slovakia. Altogether, 15 countries were represented as the top 10 collaborating partners for the V4 countries, based on the national affiliation of corresponding authors. According to the online World Bank database, all analysed countries belong to high-income countries. Of these 15 countries, 11 are members of the European Union (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Spain), 2 are European countries (England and Switzerland) and 3 are North American countries (Canada and USA). After identifying the affiliated country of corresponding authors, we plotted the impact factor and category normalized citation impact in the order of the observed highest median value. Then, according to the nonparametric distribution of data, the pairwise Wilcoxon test was used to compare values between the given V4 and analyse the top 10 affiliated countries. Czech Republic (Figure 4), Hungary (Figure 5) and Poland (Figure 6) have the lowest median value of impact factor and category normalized citation impact compared to the top 10 analysed countries. Moreover, these differences are statistically significant. Slovakia (Figure 7) was the only country having a higher impact factor (9th place from 11) and a higher category normalized citation impact (10th from 11). In the case of Slovakia, the difference was not significant for all of the top 10 countries (not significant impact factor differences for Poland and the Czech Republic, not significant category normalized citation impact differences for Austria, Poland, England and the Czech Republic). In general, these results suggest that the scientific impact of research papers published in Q1 journals is highly influenced by the country of origin of the corresponding author. Impact factor and the category normalized citation impact were plotted against the country of origin of the corresponding authors.

The country of origin of the corresponding author can provide additional information relevant to international collaboration. It is important to note that this study did not examine additional variables such as the research and development expenditure of collaborating countries or the possibility of publication bias or citation bias [46\u201348]. These results provide several other possibilities for further research in relation to international collaboration and research output. A deeper analysis should be developed considering the relationship between scientific impact and international leadership. Although the V4 countries belong to high-income countries, international collaborations are asymmetrical around several nations [49]. This suggests that the author\u2019s country of affiliation as an indicator of scientific cooperation and leadership needs a deeper insight.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.K., G.P.S., K.C., E.L. and M.D.; methodology, Z.K., M.D. and L.K.; software, Origin Pro 2022 (Student Version) and JMP (R) Pro.; validation, Z.K., M.D. and G.P.S.; resources, Z.K. and L.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Z.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, Z.K. and M.D.; visualization, Z.K.; supervision, K.C., E.L. and G.P.S.
