    "abstractText": "The current study investigates the impact of Russia-Ukraine war on topological properties of the international bond market by adopting econophysics methodologies, namely hierarchical structure methods (minimal spanning tree, (MST) and hierarchical tree, (HT)). We examine the network structure in bond markets by using daily data for 10-years government bond yields for 25 developed and developing economies including European countries as well as countries with largest bond market such as the United States, China, and Japan. We have also concentrated the co-movements among European Union (EU) member countries since most of them adopt the euro as common currency while few still use their local currency as an official currency. Our sample covers the period from beginning of January, 2015 to the end of August, 2022, which also include the Russia-Ukraine war. Hence, we have divided the period into two sub-periods to investigate the influence of Russia-Ukraine war on the structuring and clustering linkages in government bond markets. Our results indicate that the networks of relationships between EU government bond markets, using the Euro as an official currency, are closely connected to each other according to their economic tie. The countries with largest bond markets are not located at the center of the trees. It is also obtaining that the Russia-Ukraine war have affected network structure of the government bond markets.",

            "text": "Soaring prices around the world have become one of the hot topic in the economic managers and policymakers. While the central banks, who initially thought that the inflation were caused by the supply problems triggered by the pandemic and therefore it was temporary, preferred not to intervene the interest rate, however, rising inflation rate prompted the central banks to implement tight monetary policies. As a results of that, monetary policy committees those are responsible for setting interest rate had to and have raised rates aggressively to meet the inflation target. For instance, even though Federal Reserve (FED) did not changed fund rate during 2021, it intervened the interest rates seven times in 2022 to rein in inflation, resulting the rate to rise to 4.50%. The Bank of England (BoE) also enacted consecutive interest rate increases and escalated the interest rate to 3.50% in December 15, 2022, which is 0.25% in the same period of the last year. The European Central Bank (ECB), alike, raised benchmark interest rate to 2.50%, which is the highest interest rate since December 2008.\nThe raising interest rates have brought bond markets back into the economy scene. Both institutional and individual investors incline to invest in government bonds as they act as a hedge against the inflation [1]. However, co-movements between bond markets are increasing since central banks worldwide fight the common enemy and majority of them employs similar monetary policy tools [2]. Increasing market interconnectedness has amplified spillover effects, which in turn limit the ability of investors to diversify their portfolios. At this point, understanding the clustering behavior of government bond yields can assist investors to manage their financial risks.\nThe current study aims to identify topological structure of the government bond markets in order to benefit investors in portfolio diversification, taking into account of the tendency toward bonds in the global financial market. We have investigated the topology, taxonomy and relationships for 10-years government bond yields in order to analyze the network clustering among 25 developed and developing economies by using two network filtering methods, (minimal spanning tree, (MST) and hierarchical tree, (HT)) in detail. In this study, we also pay attention to the links between European Union (EU) government bond market structures since establishment of European Monetary Union has especially decreased dispersion in the EU financial markets [3].\nThe current study contributes contemporary literature on three fronts. First, even though the pattern of co-movements in stock markets have been well-addressed in the finance literature [4\u20138] the network structure in international bond market has been ignored\na e-mail: ibrahimyagli@nevsehir.edu.tr (corresponding author)\n0123456789().: V,-vol 123\n[9]. Considering investment trends in the recent year, we analyze the hierarchical pattern of international bond market by using daily data for 10-years government bond yields for 25 developed and developing economies from January, 2015 to August, 2022.\nSecond, various methodologies including cointegration tests (such as Engle-Granger, and Johansen), correlation tests (such as Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman), GARCH models, and Hurst exponent have been employed to analyze co-movements in financial markets [10\u201314]. For instance, Alvarez-Ramirez et al. [10] employed Hurst exponents to study dynamic behavior of the US stock markets. Similarly, Dajcman et al. [11] investigated stock market co-movements of the European stock markets amid the financial turmoils by adopting Dynamic Conditional Correlation-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (DCC-GARCH) and wavelet correlation analysis. However, network filtering techniques used in econophysics have rarely been applied to elicit the relationships in the financial markets. Moreover, few studies adopting econophysics approach have focused on the stock markets rather than the bond markets [4, 6, 7, 15, 16]. Coelho et al. [4], for example, adopted the minimum spanning tree to analyze the integration in world stock markets from 1997 to 2006, and revealed that international stock markets are becoming more interconnected. Sensoy and Tabak [6] also used dynamic spanning tree (DST) to examine dependence structure of Asia\u2013Pacific stock markets and ascertained that the DST drastically decreases over time. Unlike previous studies, the present paper employs MST and HT methodologies to uncover the linkages among government bond markets. The benefit of these techniques is that they provide the clear anatomy of government bond markets through the use of correlation-based networks and hierarchical clustering. These techniques also provide a concise representation for interconnections among bond yields. It is also possible to identify the centrality issues in the overall government bond market using these methods [4].\nThird, several studies use MST and HT methodologies to analyze the clustering structure of bond markets during times of turmoil, such as global financial crisis [17], Eurozone crisis [18], and more recently COVID-19 pandemic [19]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study investigates the impact of Russia-Ukraine war on the bond markets. Besides, few studies examine the impact of Russia-Ukraine conflict on financial markets. Nevertheless, these studies focus on stock market [20, 21], fiat money [22] and virtual money [23], rather than bond market. The current study, on the other hand, addresses connection structure of government bond markets amid the Russia-Ukraine war period. Even though, it seems the war is between two nations, the entire global economy is feeling the effects of war since both Russia and Ukraine are producers of major commodities. Therefore, uncovering how the war affected government bond markets can provide important implication for investors as well as policy makers.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the MST and HT approaches. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 provides the empirical findings. Section 5 concludes the study."

            "text": "The hierarchical structure methods, (minimal spanning tree, (MST) and hierarchical tree, (HT)), are methodologically basic approaches using only simple correlations as a starting point with no prior assumptions. These methods are the most popular techniques in the field of econophysics proposed by Mantegna [24], and Stanley and Mantegna [25]. The MST and HT are useful tools for detecting global structure, taxonomy, and hierarchy in financial data. The MST provides topological graph in which every node represents a distinct asset, and the distances between them are determined by applying the proper transformation on the correlation coefficients. In other words, the MST is a network that connect all N nodes (bond yields) with N \u2212 1 edges where the total sum of edge weights has a minimum value. The MST is a graph without a cycle connecting all nodes with links. The MST is also successfully applied to examine the hierarchical pattern in many areas such as stock, currency, and commodity markets.\nIn the study, the MST is applied for government bond markets since it enables us to create a taxonomy for topological space of the N government bond yields. The standard procedure commonly starts with a correlation matrix. In this regard, we initially compute the correlation function among daily bond yields of two governments i and j, as in Eq. (1).\nri j \u2329 YiY j \u232a \u2212 \u3008Yi Y \u3009 j\u221a (\u2329 Y 2i \u232a \u2212 \u2329Y 2i \u232a) (\u2329 Y 2j \u232a \u2212 \u2329 Y 2j \u232a) (1)\nwhere, ri j is the correlation coefficient between bond yields that belongs to government i and j, and \u3008. . . \u3009 symbolizes the mean over a specified time period. Y stands for the government bond yield and is the vector of the time series of log-returns, Yi (t) lnPi (t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 lnPi (t) is the log-return, and Pi (t) is the government bond yields of a country i (i 1, 2,\u2026, N) at time t. We take \u03c4 as a day in this paper.\nAt the second step, we convert correlation coefficients between two government bond yields to the metric distance of those yields dij using Eq. 2. Hence, a distance matrix rij is obtained from the correlation matrix. dij ranges from 0 to 2; di j 0 indicates government bond yields are perfectly correlated, while di j 2 implies two bonds are perfectly anti-correlated.\ndi j \u221a 2 ( 1 \u2212 ri j ) (2)\nThereafter, we construct the MST for pair of government bond yields using (NxN ) matrix of distances with Kruskal algorithm [26]. The MST is progressively constructed by connecting all the countries together in a graph, beginning from shortest distance between government bond yields.\nOn the other hand, hierarchical trees (HT) which is also called single linkage cluster analysis (SLCA) are constructed from the MSTs, along with the associated ultrametric distance, or the maximal d\u0302 i j , which fulfills the condition d\u0302i j \u2264 max { dik, dkj } [27]. The distance d\u0302i j is called the subdominant ultrametric distance [28]. Not only the geometrical (using the MST) but also the taxonomic (using the HT) information of the correlation are presented from the elements of the set which can be obtained from the trees.\nWe also use average linkage cluster analysis (ALCA) to observe the cluster structures of countries according to their geographical location, economic ties and government bond yields more clearly in the HTs. Although the MSTs and HTs are obtained methodologically straightforward approaches, these trees are useful to understand the complex system in a simple manner."

            "text": "The present study concentrates on government bonds considering the recent trends in financial markets. Government bond, often known as sovereign bond, is a long-term debt instrument issued by a national government to fund government operations. They can be issued for more than 1 year, such as 5, 10, and 30 year maturities. Government bonds offer periodic interest payments known as coupon payments. The bond yield represents the interest rate that determines the coupon payments that the issuing government pay to the bond holder.\nGovernment bonds generally keep pace with inflation; therefore, they are preferred by investors especially in rising inflation periods. These bonds are low-risk because they are supported by the full faith and credit of the issuing government. However, there are still risks regarding government bonds since factors such as inflation rate, political instability, and debt level of the issuing country can have a significant impact on the bond yields. Broadly, there are two factors of risk associated to government bonds, inflation risk and market risk, respectively. Inflation risk refers the situation where the bond generates return lower than the inflation rate. Market risk may occur if bond sold prior to maturity at a lower price than the purchasing price. Investors would like to minimize their investment risks. At this point, portfolio diversification benefits investors to minimize their risk. Accordingly, the study aims to examine hierarchical structure of government bond markets to assist investors in risk diversification. We employ hierarchical structure methods (MST, HT) to portray the linkages among government bond yields for a group of 25 developed and emerging economies. We use 10-years government bond yields since investors are increasing their exposure to longer-term debt. Our data covers the period from January 1, 2015, to August 31, 2022, with the total of 1,566 observations for each country. We also split our sample period into two sub-periods related to Russia-Ukraine war, period-before-war which spans from January 1, 2015, to February 23, 2022, and war-period from February 24, 2022, where the Russian invasion of Ukraine began to August 31, 2022, respectively. War-period corresponds the time where central banks all around world use tight monetary policies therefore this period reflects high yield periods, while period-before-war represents time period where the bond yields are low. We obtain data on government bond yields from Investing Database www.investing.com [29]. Table 1 reports countries and their corresponding symbols as well as descriptive statistics. Half of the government bond yields indices have a positive standard deviation of difference values, while another half is negative. This result implies clearly different uncertainty behaviors for different countries in the sample period. In general, the GRC has the largest standard deviation, measuring at 3.271, suggesting that the GRC has experienced drastic changes in government bond yields. It is also worth to mention that such type of similar behavior has been found in the global network of economic policy uncertainty [30]."

            "text": "In this section, we construct the full-sample MSTs and HTs in order to visualize a complex financial network, such as the correlations, hierarchies, and networks of the government bond yields for 25 developed and developing economies from January 1, 2015, to August 31, 2022. Additionally, we split this time frame into two sub-periods in order to investigate the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war, to test various time-windows and to observe the temporal evolution.\nFigures 1 and 2 provides some interesting insights into the changes in nature and extent of the network connections of government bond yields due to the uncertainties of the Russia-Ukraine war. The MSTs of the government bond yields which exhibit some degree of geographical and economical linkages, are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for the periods before and during the Russia-Ukraine war, respectively. Each node of the tree corresponds to the country whose government bond yields. The red and blue colors of the nodes represent the European countries, using and not using the Euro as an official currency, respectively. From these figures, we observe that both the general link structure of the trees and the branch clusterization (i.e., clusters gathering the same kind of countries) have changed. A mixed type of topology is shown in Fig. 1, where there are two primary hubs that are almost equivalent topologically (ESP and HUN). However, despite this interesting dual centrality, the MST appears to be a quite dispersed. It can be seen from the MST in Fig. 1 that eight (ESP, PRT, FRA, BEL, AUT, NLD, FIN and SVK) of the European Union countries that use the Euro as their official currency are closely linked to their European counterparts. Countries that are not members of the European Union such\nas JPN, CHN, GBR, RUS, NOR and CHE, are also linked with the European Union countries, independently of each other. Here, we can see that the USA plays a bridging role between the European countries. We observe two distinct EU country clusters, using and not using the Euro as a currency, that are well matched due to their joint production activities and/or strong interrelationships. In this case, commercial relations and economic ties may result from geographical effects.\nReferring to Fig. 2, the MST during the Russia-Ukraine war tells quite a different story to that seen in Fig. 1. For the European Union countries that use the Euro as their currency, the number of connections with each other has increased and they have started to be more connected. Except for DEU, all European Union countries that use the Euro as their official currency form a large cluster, suggesting that centralized monetary policy has influenced Eurozone financial markets. In other words, EU economies are connected by way of joint monetary policy transmission mechanisms and these mechanism strengthen during the crisis periods and therefore affect the financial markets. The USA is also linked to the European Union countries, and it plays a bridging role between the European countries. From these results, one can conclude that the Russia-Ukraine war has a serious effect especially on bond markets those of the European Union countries.\nThe hierarchical trees (HTs) of the subdominant ultrametric space associated with the MSTs are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 before and during the Russia-Ukraine war, respectively. Two distinct countries (lines) link when a horizontal line is drawn between two vertical lines. The height of the horizontal line indicates the ultrametric distance at which the two distinct countries are joined. To begin with, in Fig. 3, we found two different country clusters. The first cluster is the European countries cluster, which consists of BEL, FRA and AUT, they use the Euro as an official currency. The distance between BEL and FRA is the smallest of the sample, indicating the strongest relationship between these two countries. The second cluster is composed of HUN and POL, which are also European countries cluster, not using the Euro as an official currency. One explanation is that these small clusters are formed little interactive clusters before the period of the Russia-Ukraine war. In Fig. 4, one can see that the overall structure observed in this figure is consistent with Fig. 3, but the following relevant changes are detected: (i) It is observed that the number of countries in the European Union cluster, whose use the Euro as their currency, have increased due to the effect of the war. (ii)The first cluster consists of BEL, FRA, AUT, NDL, FIN, SVK, IRL, PRT and ESP. (iii) The number of countries in the other European Union cluster that do not use the Euro as their currency has also increased with the effect of the war. (iv) The second cluster consists of the HUN, POL and CZE. These results are not surprising because the government bond yields of the issuing countries had more stable structures before the Russia-Ukraine war. However, the Russia-Ukraine war crisis had a serious effect on government bond yields.\nWe also used the average linkage cluster analysis (ALCA) in the HTs to observe the cluster structure much better. The ALCAs seen in Figs. 5 and 6 are obtained before and during the Russia-Ukraine war, respectively. When comparing the HTs and ALCAs, similar cluster structures were observed; however, the number of countries in the ALCA cluster was found to be more than in the HTs. For example, new European Union cluster, which consists of PRT, ITA and GRC, they use the Euro as an official currency, appear in Fig. 5. The second example, two countries in the European Union cluster that does not use the Euro as its currency before the Russia-Ukraine war seen in the HT, but four countries were seen in ALCA, as can also be verified comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 5. Thus, we see that the cluster structures are obtained more efficiently by using ALCA."

            "text": "Inflation surge catalyzed central banks around the world to adopt tight monetary policy to control the rising prices. Major central banks are increasing interest rates consecutively in order to tame inflation. Tightening monetary policy makes the bond market more attractive to investors. Recently, both individual and institutional investors, have started to move their investment into bond market to hedge against rising prices.\nCritical issue in investment management is balancing risk and return. Managing both upside and downside risk is a crucial issue in financial markets. Therefore, investors are seeking alternative way to minimize their risk. Concordantly, understanding the network in the financial market can assists investors to manage their risk. The present study, therefore, investigates hierarchical structure of the government bonds markets for a group of 25 developed and emerging economies by applying the MST and HT methodologies.\nOur findings point that there is a convergence in the markets for EU government bonds, particularly in those economies where the euro is the official currency. The convergence among EU government bond yields is much stronger during the Russia-Ukraine war, implying the spillover effect among EU countries in times of turmoil. Besides, the major bond markets are not located near the centers of gravity. This finding suggests that market size is not a clear measure of the impact factor for the government bonds market. Furthermore, no single market serves as the focal point of the links. Separating the sample period into two sub-periods also\ndemonstrates that the linkages between the government bond markets were impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war. Our findings can provide important implications for investors and risk managers in terms of optimal asset allocation as well as risk diversification.\nAuthors contribution I.Y.: Methodology, software, resources, data curation, writing\u2013original draft.
