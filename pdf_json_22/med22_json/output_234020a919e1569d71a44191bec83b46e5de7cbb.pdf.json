    "abstractText": "Background: Inflammation, particularly cytokine release, contributes to epileptogenesis by influencing the cerebral tissue remodeling and neuronal excitability that occurs after a precipitating epileptogenic insult. While several cytokines have been explored in this process, release kinetics are less well investigated. Determining the time course of cytokine release in the epileptogenic zone is necessary for precisely timed preventive or therapeutic anti-inflammatory interventions. Methods: Hippocampal extracellular levels of six cytokines and chemokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) were quantified at various time points during epileptogenesis in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS) using microdialysis (MD). Results: The analysis of microdialysates demonstrated consistent elevation at all time points during epileptogenesis for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10. IL-10 release was maximal on day 1, IL-1\u03b2 release peaked at day 8. No correlation between local hippocampal IL-1\u03b2 concentrations and IL-1\u03b2 blood levels was found. Conclusion: The release kinetics of IL-1\u03b2 are consistent with its established pro-epileptogenic properties, while the kinetics of IL-10 suggest a counter-regulatory effect. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of intraindividual longitudinal monitoring of hippocampal molecular inflammatory processes via repetitive MD over several weeks and sheds light on the kinetics of hippocampal cytokine release during epileptogenesis.",

            "text": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS) is one of the most common focal epilepsies. Treatment is often challenging, with a significant frequency of pharmacoresistance, as well as cognitive and psychiatric comorbidity. Rather than\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 677. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12050677 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci\ntargeted therapeutic strategies, the mainstay of treatment is symptomatic inhibition of seizures using antiseizure medications [1] or resective epilepsy surgery [2]. The exact underlying mechanism of mTLE-HS pathogenesis has yet to be established. It is known that an initial precipitating injury (IPI), such as complex febrile seizures, traumatic brain injury or stroke can initiate epileptogenesis and thereby manifest epilepsy [3]. Epileptogenesis is a clinically silent period\u2014patients are asymptomatic during this time. Currently, no reliable biofluid biomarkers of epileptogenesis are established, hampering epileptogenesis research in human clinical trials. Emerging evidence indicates that inflammatory processes increase seizure susceptibility and are involved in epileptogenesis after an IPI [4]. Immune-mediated pathogenesis has been claimed not only for autoimmune epilepsies (such as Rasmussen or antibodymediated autoimmune encephalitis), but also for epilepsy due to specific lesions like hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in particular [5]. Several inflammatory mediators contribute to the activation of those immune responses, such as cytokines, interferons, growth factors and tumor necrosis factors [6]. In the central nervous system (CNS), cytokines and chemokines are primarily released by infiltrating immune cells, such as granulocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as other cell types (e.g., endothelial cells). Studies have shown an important contribution of glial cells as well as neurons in the production of cytokines during episodes of inflammation in the brain [7]. They are usually released in a cascade as one cytokine causes its target cells to produce other cytokines. Some cytokines act as precipitants of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways. Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6 and the chemokines CCL2 (Monocyte Chemotattractant Protein 1 [MCP-1]), CCL3 (Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1-Alpha [MIP-1\u03b1]) and CCL5 (RANTES) are considered pro-inflammatory and IL-10 mediates mainly anti-inflammatory processes by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell proliferation [8]. Besides acting as inflammatory mediators, increasing evidence indicates that cytokines also interact with receptors and ion channels regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, as well as tissue remodeling under both physiological and pathological conditions [9]. The most convincing evidence supporting the involvement of cytokines in epileptogenesis and epilepsy progression originated from studies on IL-1\u03b2, its corresponding receptor (IL-1R1) and its antagonist (IL-1RA). Most of these study findings are based on histopathological intracellular findings [4]. The correlation between blood cytokine levels and intracerebral cytokine concentrations within the epileptogenic cortex is unknown. Intracerebral microdialysis (MD), with its probe acting like an artificial blood capillary, measures the concentration of the components of the extracellular space and is a tool broadly used in clinical practice and research [10].

This model is characterized by histopathological findings resembling the most common human HS (classified after the international league against epilepsy (ILAE)) type 1, with cell loss mostly in CA1 and CA4, and spontaneous seizure occurrence after a silent period of several days to weeks, making it well-suited for studies on epileptogenesis [12].\nThis proof-of-concept study investigates:\n\u2022 The feasibility of longitudinal monitoring of cerebral molecular inflammatory processes using hippocampal MD over several months in an animal model of mTLE-HS (proof-of-concept); \u2022 Whether and to what extend the cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 are secreted in the hippocampus; \u2022 The intraindividual release kinetics before, during and after epileptogenesis; \u2022 If the MD procedure itself leads to the release of cytokines and chemokines."

Holes (1 mm in diameter) were drilled into the skull to bilaterally implant stimulation electrodes into the perforant pathway (4.5 mm lateral to bregma, 0.5 mm rostral to lambda, variable depth) and a recording electrode was implanted into the left hippocampus (2 mm lateral, 3 mm caudal, variable depth). A guide cannula for MD probes (CMA Microdialysis AB, Kista, Sweden) was inserted above the right hippocampus (5.2 mm caudal of bregma, 4.6 mm lateral right, 3.5 mm depth). The position of the electrodes is shown in Figure 1. One additional drill hole was placed rostral to the bregma; two additional holes were drilled between the lambda and the bregma for a transmitter ground screw and an additional support screw.

Secretion of Cytokines during Epileptogenesis 4.1.1. IL-1\u03b2\nThis study provides additional evidence for the active secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 in early epileptogenesis. The data support IL-1\u03b2 being crucially involved in epileptogenesis, as shown in several clinical and experimental studies [17]. IL-1\u03b2 is assigned a key role in the orchestration of the complex immune response to infection and injury. It is released by macrophages and other infiltrating immune cells, but also synthesized in the brain by glial cells and certain neurons [18]. IL-1 receptors are found in different regions of the CNS with the highest abundance in the hippocampus [19]. Overexpression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-1R1 and IL-1RA is demonstrated in the rodent brains of different animal models after electrically or chemically induced SE [20]. In this study, maximal IL-1\u03b2-release occurred on day 8 and converged to the baseline after established epilepsy. Expression of IL-1\u03b2 has been shown to peak 6 h after electrically induced SE in rats, with the subsequent inflammatory response lasting several weeks [6]. IL-1\u03b2 expression in glial cells remains elevated for up to 60 days [21]. In addition, IL-1\u03b2 influences neuronal function under pathological and physiological conditions [19], with direct application of IL-1\u03b2 into the CNS increasing neuronal excitability and amplifying bicuculline- and kainic acid (KA)induced seizures [22]; this also lowers the seizure threshold in experimental models of febrile seizures [23]. In human brain tissue resected during epilepsy surgery, elevated expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1RA was found in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and glioneuronal tumors [24], as well as in cortical tubers and giant cell astrocytoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis [25] and in hippocampal sclerosis [26]. CSF samples of children with epilepsy showed significantly elevated IL-1\u03b2 values compared to controls [27]. The pro-convulsive and pro-epileptogenic effects of IL-1\u03b2 have been associated with amplified glutamatergic neurotransmission, with enhanced excitotoxicity via IL1R1-induced activation of the N-metyhl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor [28]. Furthermore, IL-1\u03b2-induced transcriptional activations of MAP-Kinase and NF-\u03baB are thought to induce morphological and physiological changes in neuronal networks, contributing to epileptogenesis [29]. Based on these findings, antagonization of IL-1\u03b2 may be a therapeutic target for the prevention of epileptogenesis. Pharmacological blockade of IL-1\u03b2/IL-1R1-axis, using the IL-1 antagonist Anakinra, reduced the duration and frequency of seizures in rodents after induction of SE via pilocarpine or electrical stimulation and exerted neuroprotective effects, including reduced cell loss in the frontal brain regions [30,31]. There are case reports that suggest Anakinra could be effective in controlling epileptic activity [32]. Of note, the data of this study imply that therapeutic intervention should take place soon after the IPI."

            "text": "IL-10 is broadly expressed by many immune cells in both the adaptive (e.g., Th1, Th2 and Th17 cell subsets, regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells and (regulatory) B cells) as well as the innate immune system (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils) [8,33,34]. Induction of IL-10 often occurs together with pro-inflammatory cytokines, although pathways that induce IL-10 may negatively regulate these pro-inflammatory cytokines [34]. In this context and consistent with its role in the periphery, activation of the IL-10 receptor in the CNS leads to decreased release of TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23; reduced proliferation of T cells and decreased antigen presentation of monocytes and macrophages [35]. IL-10 has the capacity to act in a neuroprotective manner via the inhibition of NF-\u03baB,\nthereby reducing neurotoxic accumulation of glutamate. IL-10 is therefore a functional antagonist to the proinflammatory IL-1\u03b2 [33,35]. This study demonstrates that early secretion of IL-10, even earlier than IL-1\u03b2, into the extracellular space potentially acts to temper the inflammatory process occurring after the IPI. Of note, patients with hippocampal sclerosis have significantly reduced IL-10 serum levels, it was suggested that these patients have an inadequate anti-inflammatory immune response [36]. Another study showed upregulation of IL-10 in the resected hippocampi of epilepsy patients in the areas CA1 and CA3 [37]. Therefore, IL-10-agonism could be a further potential therapeutic strategy to prevent epileptogenesis. Various attempts to positively influence autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, by administration of IL-10 did not demonstrate a clear effect [33]."

            "text": "IL-6, a potent inducer of the acute phase response, is secreted by T and B cells, macrophages, microglia, and non-immune cells such as endothelial cells or neurons [38]. In contrast, its receptor is found only on a few cell types, including some leukocytes and microglia. IL-6 plays prominent roles in chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, infectious disease and cancer and has context-dependent pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. In the pathogenesis of epilepsy, IL-6 has demonstrated a dichotomous role. Generally, IL-6 is regarded as a proinflammatory cytokine. Patients with epilepsy have shown elevated blood levels of IL-6 both interictally and postictally [39\u201341], as well as elevated CSF levels of IL-6 [42]. Overexpression of IL-6 seems to increase gliosis in the hippocampus and intranasal application of IL-6 in mice or transgenic IL-6 expression in the rodent brain has a proconvulsive effect [43]. Studies have also shown neuroprotective effects. IL-6 knockout mice showed higher susceptibility to proconvulsive stimuli in KA-induced seizures [44]. Studies investigating stroke demonstrate that IL-6 has neuroprotective effects via the regulation of oxidative stress and angiogenesis [43]. In this study, IL-6 showed no relevant increase in the hippocampal extracellular compartment in epileptogenesis.\n4.1.4. Chemokines\nThe chemokines CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 demonstrated no notable changes in our study. The literature suggests that chemokines, particularly CCL2, may well play a role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Increased levels of CCL2 are described in the resected tissue of epilepsy patients [45]. In addition, rat hippocampal concentrations of CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 were elevated following pilocarpine-induced seizures [46]. Finally, patients with mTLE have demonstrated elevated hippocampal levels of CCL3 [47]."

            "text": "The seven-day recuperation period after surgery appears to be sufficient for recovery, as all baseline cytokine levels in both groups were relatively low. The MD procedure itself may precipitate inflammation, as comparing the first samples to those collected three hours later demonstrated that the later samples had increased cytokine levels. The placement of the MD probes provoking minor trauma in the tissue probably accounts for this cytokine increase. Earlier studies show similar results: Folkersma et al., for example, discuss cytokine release following probe placement. They also demonstrate that a steady state for extraction is reached after about 1.5 h [48]."

            "text": "Changes in the immune cell profile may serve as an indicator of differential activation of the immune system in patients with epilepsy. Changes in both the innate immune system (including monocyte subsets) and the adaptive immune system (e.g., immune patterns of lymphocyte subsets) in peripheral blood and CSF have been discussed as typical immunological features in mTLE patients [5]. In addition to circulating immune cells, plasma cytokine levels are increasingly considered as potential biomarkers in epilepsy. IL-1\u03b2, for instance, has been shown to correlate with disease severity and drug resistance [49,50]. Of\nnote, in this study no correlation between the IL-1\u03b2 concentration of the MD samples and the blood could be found. MD therefore provides crucial data that cannot otherwise be established by blood sampling alone. This finding probably implies that circulating cytokines are unlikely to be suitable biomarker candidates for the detection of epileptogenesis."

            "text": "Using in vivo MD allows for sampling of the extracellular space and is therefore a worthy addition to the well-established tissue examination protocol during epileptogenesis. This is particularly true for inflammation, wherein secretory processes play a crucial role. MD also allows longitudinal sampling, i.e., repeated measurements in the same animal at consecutive time points, thus reducing the number of animals required for experimentation. Furthermore, intra-individual monitoring provides a good opportunity for correlation with clinical parameters that change over time (e.g., seizure frequency). The rat model used here has excellent face validity for human mTLE-HS as it closely resembles the histopathology of HS ILAE type 1 and is characterized by a relatively long latency period before spontaneous seizures occur. Limiting factors are the time-consuming and costly procedure associated with MD and indeed the specific PPS rat model. Furthermore, the small but unequivocal inflammation induced by the MD probe requires closely matched control animals. MD cannot be seen as a minimally invasive procedure [51] and delivers only small samples that require very sensitive detection methods. In addition, the MD procedure is not specific to certain hippocampal subregions and the MD probe extends over different subfields. Further studies should differentiate the exact source of the cytokines. Lastly, this study was for proof-of-concept, using a small number of animals. The results of cytokine and chemokine measurements should therefore be validated in an independent cohort."

            "text": "Preclinical and clinical data provide evidence of a prominent role of cytokines in epileptogenesis. As cytokines are often redundant in their function, the development of novel therapies remains complicated. Thus, mechanistic studies are needed to further distinguish the signaling pathways responsible for physiological versus pathological conditions. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that longitudinal monitoring of hippocampal cytokine release into the extracellular space is feasible over several months during epileptogenesis in freely moving rats and provides a useful, relevant supplement to histopathological studies. The release kinetics of IL-1\u03b2 are consistent with its established pro-epileptogenic properties, while the kinetics of IL-10 suggest a counter-regulatory effect. These data provide a basis for sample size calculation for larger studies and for the timing of anti-inflammatory interventions in order to antagonize epileptogenesis.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization and methodology, S.B., K.S.
