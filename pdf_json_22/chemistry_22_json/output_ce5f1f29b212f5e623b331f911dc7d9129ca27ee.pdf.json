            "text": "Research on luminescent first-row transition metal complexes has tremendously increased in recent years to replace and complement the dominating precious and rare earth elements in molecular inorganic photochemistry.1 Prominent examples are chromium(III) complexes with tridentate ligands and large bite angles which display a strong phosphorescence from spinflip excited doublet states 2E/2T1 in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region with extremely high quantum yields and lifetimes, yet typically only in the absence of molecular oxygen (3O2). 2\u20134\nThe prototypical complex is the so-called molecular ruby, [Cr(ddpd)2]\n3+ ([Cr5H]3+, ddpd = N,N\u2032-dimethyl-N,N\u2032-dipyridine2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine, Scheme 1a) with a luminescence quantum yield of \u03d5ArPL = 13.7% and an excited state lifetime of\n\u03c4ArPL = 1.1 ms at room temperature in deaerated acetonitrile solution (\u03bbem = 738, 775 nm).\n5,6 Modifying the ligand structure and substitution pattern enabled the tuning of the emission wavelength from 709 nm to 1067 nm.7,8\nSeveral unimolecular non-radiative decay pathways compete with the spin- and Laporte-forbidden radiative relaxation in octahedral chromium(III) complexes. This includes back-intersystem crossing to dissociative quartet states (4T2; Scheme 1b), excited state distortion,9 and multiphonon relaxation10 promoted by CH, NH or OH overtones from ligands or solvent molecules.3 Large ligand field splitting and rigid ligand frameworks promoting high octahedricity and ligand deuteration helped to increase the quantum yield and lifetime of the excited state of [Cr5H]3+ up to \u03d5ArPL = 30% and \u03c4 Ar PL = 2300 \u00b5s in O2-free deuterated acetonitrile solution at room temperature. 12\nThe dual NIR emission of [Cr5H]3+ was already exploited for O2 and ratiometric temperature sensing as well as to optically probe hydrostatic pressure.13 The effective quenching of the chromium(III) emission by 3O2 leads to a high quantum yield of the formed singlet oxygen (\u03a6(1O2) ca. 61% in acetonitrile), 14 enabling the usage of [Cr5H]3+ as 1O2-generating photosensitizer for organic photo-oxidation reactions14 and photodynamic therapy.15 However, the high sensitivity to 3O2 limits other potentially interesting applications of chromium(III) complexes \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

The increased average Cr\u22efO2 distance is expected to decrease the Dexter energy transfer rate constant kq, thereby reducing the O2-sensitivity of the chromium(III) complexes and increasing the photoluminescence quantum yields \u03d5airPL and lifetimes \u03c4 air PL in air-saturated systems."

According to density functional theory (DFT) modeling, the 6-methyl substituted derivative ddpd6Me coordinates to chromium(III) giving [Cr(ddpd6Me)2] 3+ ([Cr6Me]3+, Fig. 1b), however with significantly increased Cr\u2013N distances to the terminal pyridines by 0.1 \u00c5 compared to the parent complex [Cr5H]3+ (Table S3\u2020). Possibly, interligand steric congestion, as observed in iron(II) complexes with 6,6\u2033-halogenated 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridyl (tpy) ligands,20 hinders the successful coordination of ddpd6Me to the small chromium(III) ion (ionic radius 0.62 \u00c5).21 Therefore, all attempts to coordinate ddpd6Me to chromium(III) to form [Cr6Me]3+ failed. The next suitable position for introducing a shielding substituent R is position 5 at the terminal pyridine rings to give the ddpd5R ligands (Scheme 1a). As these substituents R point away from the metal center, the substituent size clearly plays a key role to efficiently block the access of O2 to the chromium center (Fig. 1). Therefore, we prepared ddpd ligands with methyl, mesityl and 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl substituents at position 5 (ddpd5Me, ddpd5Mes and ddpd5Tripp) and the corresponding chromium(III) complexes [Cr(ddpd5Me)2][BF4]3 ([Cr\n5Me][BF4]3), [Cr(ddpd5Mes)2][BF4]3 ([Cr\n5Mes][BF4]3) and [Cr (ddpd5Tripp)2][BF4]3 ([Cr\n5Tripp][BF4]3).

In the solid state, the average Cr\u2212N bond from the central pyridines to the metal center is shortened (2.042 \u00c5 to 2.023 \u00c5), while the average Cr\u2212N bond to the terminal pyridines is elongated from 2.045 \u00c5 to 2.053 \u00c5. Simultaneously, the intramolecular N\u2212Cr\u2212N angles increasingly deviate from 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 within this series. This is expected as the size of the aromatic substituents forces the ligand scaffold to twist more strongly out of plane than with small substituents like R = H or Me. Due to the torsion induced by the bulky Tripp substituent, the dihedral angle between the central pyridine planes becomes smaller (\u222110\u00b0, Table S1\u2020) compared to the other ligands (\u222114\u00b0\u201319\u00b0). The more efficient overlap of the pyridine and metal centered t2g orbitals presumably causes a stronger nephelauxetic effect and a bathochromic shift of the emission band for this complex (see below). Moreover, intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking occurs between the aromatic substituents (centroid-to-centroid distance in [Cr5Mes][BF4]3 = 4.961 \u00c5, Fig. S21\u2020 and [Cr\n5Tripp][BF4]3 5.700 \u00c5, Fig. S22\u2020) and even intramolecular interligand \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking was observed in [Cr5Tripp][BF4]3 (5.968 \u00c5). This intramolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking might shield the chromium ion even more efficiently from the environment (Fig. 1e).\nAs a measure of the accessibility of the metal center within the ligand scaffold for subsequent luminescence studies without and in the presence of oxygen, the shortest Cr\u22efF (BF4\n\u2212) and Cr\u22efN (MeCN) distances in the crystal structures were taken into account (Table S1 and Fig. S20\u201322\u2020). Compared to the complex with R = Me, the distances to the counter ions increase, while they remain in the same range for MeCN contacts. This suggests better shielding from tetrahedral molecules than from linear molecules as well as a weaker electrostatic interaction between the counter ions and the cationic metal center in the solid state."

On the other hand, mesityl and 2,4,6-triisopropyl substituents in position 5 clearly affect the photoluminescence quantum yields and luminescence lifetimes of the chromium(III) complexes in\nair-saturated acetonitrile as reflected by \u03d5airPL = 2.2% and 5.1% and \u03c4airPL = 244 \u00b5s and 518 \u00b5s, respectively.

This demonstrates the efficient shielding of the chromium(III) center from O2 by the bulky Tripp substituents.\nCompared to very recently reported chromium(III) complexes with 1,3-bis(2\u2032-pyridylimino)-isoindoline ligands reported as showing long-lived NIR emission under inert and ambient conditions in acetonitrile (\u03c4ArPL = 8.0 \u00b5s and 25.0 \u00b5s; \u03c4airPL = 4.5 \u00b5s and 8.1 \u00b5s),\n24 the here reported lifetimes of [Cr5Mes][BF4]3 and [Cr\n5Tripp][BF4]3 are larger by factors of 30 to 115.\nEmission intensity and lifetime-based Stern\u2013Volmer analyses with varying concentrations or partial pressures of O2 in acetonitrile solution gave linear plots with Stern\u2013Volmer constants KIntSV and K LT SV matching within the measurement uncertainty. This confirms the diffusional quenching by O2 (Table 4, Fig. 3 and S25\u2020). The KIntSV and K LT SV values drop significantly from KSV \u2248 0.13 hPa\u22121 for [Cr5H][BF4]3 and [Cr5Me][BF4]3 over 0.02 hPa\u22121 for [Cr5Mes][BF4]3 to 0.01 hPa\n\u22121 for [Cr5Tripp][BF4]3. Similarly, the quenching rate constants kq = KSV/\u03c4ArPL decrease from \u2248 110 hPa s\u22121 for [Cr5H][BF4]3 and [Cr5Me][BF4]3 over 20 hPa s\u22121 for [Cr5Mes][BF4]3 to 11 hPa s\n\u22121 for [Cr5Tripp][BF4]3, equaling an overall shielding-related reduction by a factor of about 10. These results clearly demonstrate the superior shielding effect of the bulky ddpd5Tripp ligand.\nCooling the complexes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions increases the luminescence lifetimes (Fig. S26 and Table S4\u2020) of the complexes [Cr5R][BF4]3 in acetonitrile solution, yet displaying a different degree of the temperature dependence for deaerated and atmospheric conditions (Fig. S27\u2020). Under Ar-saturated conditions, for R = H, Me, Mes, the lifetimes are prolonged by a factor of f = 5\u20137 upon cooling from 338 to 278 K. For the bulky substituent R = Tripp, the temperature dependence is significantly smaller (factor of f = 2.4) under these conditions. This indicates a higher activation barrier for thermally induced non-radiative processes, probably because the substituent Tripp enforces a rigid structure of the respective chromium(III) complex. Under atmospheric conditions, the increase in the luminescence lifetimes upon lowering the temperature is less significant for all complexes (R = H: f \u2248 1.1, Me: f \u2248 1.3; Mes: f \u2248 2.5, Tripp: f \u2248 1.8). Especially for the complexes with the ddpd ligands bearing the small substituents R = H and Me, O2 quenching is now the most sig-\nFig. 2 (a) Absorption and normalized emission spectra of [Cr5R][BF4]3 complexes with R = H (\u03bbexc = 435 nm, black), Me (\u03bbexc = 441 nm, blue), Mes (\u03bbexc = 450 nm, green) and Tripp (\u03bbexc = 454 nm, red) in Ar-saturated acetonitrile.

            "text": "This study reports the syntheses and structures of novel chromium(III) spin-flip emitters (molecular rubies) modified at position 5 of the tridentate chelate ligands with bulky substituents\nto protect the chromium(III) center from O2 quenching. Conceptually, the shielding of a spin-flip emitter from quenching by 3O2 is more straightforward than the shielding of a phosphorescent charge-transfer emitter due to the metal-localized and ligand-delocalized nature of the respective participating wavefunctions. While small methyl substituents barely show a protective effect, the aryl substituents mesityl and 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl effectively shield the chromium(III) center from a close contact with O2. This reduces the Dexter-type energy transfer rate to O2 from kq \u2248 110 hPa s\u22121 to 11 hPa s\u22121 and consequently increases the photoluminescence quantum yields and lifetimes of the respective chromium(III) complexes from 0.8 to 5.1% and from 52 to 518 \u00b5s, respectively, in air-saturated acetonitrile solution at 293 K. In the future, these favorable luminescence features of the chromium(III) complexes with sterically demanding ddpd ligands can enable applications of shielded molecular rubies, for example as reporters in time-gated luminescence detection schemes25 or for circularly polarized NIR emission26 under aerobic conditions."
