We first investigate the duality on a dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole with nonvanishing dilaton and axion charges. The near-horizon geometry of extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen spacetime possesses the SL\u00f02; R\u00de \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00de isometry where the asymptotic symmetry group method can be used to find the corresponding central charge. We find two different branches of masses which correspond to CFT with two different central charges, cL 1\u20444 12am\u00fe and cL 1\u20444 12am\u2212. The exact agreement between the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and entropy from CFT is then found also in two different branches of extremal entropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this duality is robust insofar for nonzero anti\u2013de Sitter (AdS) length. The duality holds for both dyonic Kerr-Sen\u2013AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart. In both cases, we obtain the expected entropy from CFT which matches exactly with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Since dyonic and axion charges are proportional to 1=m, we note that there are possibly more than two branches of the central charge for nonzero AdS length in terms of mass. When we turn off dyonic charge, the axion charge vanishes, giving the results of Kerr-Sen\u2013AdS black hole. Moreover, when we assume the equal electromagnetic charges, it recovers the results when the dilaton charge vanishes. Lastly, we compare the results of a dyonic Kerr-Sen\u2013AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart to those of the dyonic Kerr-Newman\u2013AdS black hole and the ultraspinning counterpart. Depending on the dyonic charge parameters, it is found that an extremal ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Sen\u2013AdS black hole is not always superentropic.",

Sakti * and Piyabut Burikham \u2020\nHigh Energy Physics Theory Group, Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand\n(Received 17 August 2022; accepted 25 October 2022; published 10 November 2022)\nWe demonstrate strong evidence of entropy matching that rotating dyonic black holes in EinsteinMaxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory is holographically dual to a 2D conformal field theory (CFT). We first investigate the duality on a dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole with nonvanishing dilaton and axion charges. The near-horizon geometry of extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen spacetime possesses the SL\u00f02; R\u00de \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00de isometry where the asymptotic symmetry group method can be used to find the corresponding central charge. We find two different branches of masses which correspond to CFT with two different central charges, cL \u00bc 12am\u00fe and cL \u00bc 12am\u2212. The exact agreement between the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and entropy from CFT is then found also in two different branches of extremal entropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this duality is robust insofar for nonzero anti\u2013de Sitter (AdS) length. The duality holds for both dyonic Kerr-Sen\u2013AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart. In both cases, we obtain the expected entropy from CFT which matches exactly with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Since dyonic and axion charges are proportional to 1=m, we note that there are possibly more than two branches of the central charge for nonzero AdS length in terms of mass. When we turn off dyonic charge, the axion charge vanishes, giving the results of Kerr-Sen\u2013AdS black hole. Moreover, when we assume the equal electromagnetic charges, it recovers the results when the dilaton charge vanishes. Lastly, we compare the results of a dyonic Kerr-Sen\u2013AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart to those of the dyonic Kerr-Newman\u2013AdS black hole and the ultraspinning counterpart. Depending on the dyonic charge parameters, it is found that an extremal ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Sen\u2013AdS black hole is not always superentropic.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.106006\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIt has been pointed out by Bekenstein and Hawking that black holes must have an entropy to prevent the violation of the second law of thermodynamics. It also corresponds to the existence of radiation from the black holes with finite temperature. These thermodynamic behaviors of black holes indicate that there exists the underlyingmicrostructurewithin the black holes. One big question then arises from this theory questioning the explanation of the origin of the black hole microstates. It has been a main curiosity for decades to explain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from this microscopic point of view. Nonetheless, there is yet no complete answer to this question.However, for a large class of extremal\nsupersymmetric black holes, this question has been answered in which the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be computed also by counting the degeneracy of Bogomol\u2019nyi-PrasadSommerfield soliton bound states [1,2]. Another answer to the previous question is the Kerr/CFT duality. This duality states that there is a correspondence between the associated physical quantities of the extremal four-dimensional Kerr black hole and almost similar physical quantities in a chiral conformal field theory (CFT) [3]. This statement is parallel to the general one given by Brown and Hanneaux for AdS3 [4]. However, the AdS3 spacetime is replaced by a near-horizon extremal black hole metric. In the near-horizon region of extremal black holes, it is shown that there is a conformal invariance implying the presence of an anti\u2013de Sitter (AdS) structure on the spacetime with SL\u00f02; R\u00de \u00d7U\u00f01\u00de isometry. The generalization of this correspondence to the other extremal rotating black holes, in four and higher dimensions, and beyond Einstein theory have been extensively studied during the last decade [5\u201321]. The 2D chiral CFT has been carried out by considering the asymptotic symmetry group with some proposed boundary conditions, from *fitrahalfian@gmail.com \u2020piyabut@gmail.com Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

After defining charges associated with the diffeomorphisms and evaluating the Dirac brackets of the charges, we can produce a Virasoro algebra with nonvanishing (quantum) central charge which is the extension of U\u00f01\u00de isometry of the near-horizon extremal black hole geometry. The entropy is then calculated using Cardy\u2019s growth of states for a 2D CFTwhich is the function of central charge and temperature. The temperature can then be calculated by assuming Frolov-Thorne vacuum. From this duality calculation, the exact matching between entropy from CFT and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of extremal Kerr black hole is established. Interestingly, the Kerr/CFT correspondence may apply not only to the extremal black holes, but also to nonextremal black ones. The hidden conformal symmetry of the Kerr black hole has been revealed for the first time in Ref. [22]. The conformal symmetry appears on the solution space of the scalar probe in the black hole background. Further studies show that not only scalar probe, yet higherspin particles can also be the probe to reveal the hidden conformal symmetry [23]. Similar to the Kerr/CFT in extremal black holes, this also can be extended to various black hole solutions in four and five dimensions, and also in different gravitational theories [24\u201347]. The revelation of the hidden conformal symmetry shows that in the nearhorizon region and low-frequency limit, the phase space possesses SL\u00f02; R\u00de \u00d7 SL\u00f02; R\u00de isometry similar to AdS3 spacetime. In these papers, the central charges are computed using numerical observation in order to match the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with the Cardy entropy. Another observation for nonextremal Kerr black hole is that we can identify two sets of Virasoro diffeomorphisms acting on the horizon leading to nonvanising left- and rightmoving central charges [48]. This remarkable calculation fills the gap left from the first revelation of hidden conformal symmetry in the nonextremal black hole. Another intriguing result is provided in Ref. [49] that one can also extend the conventional CFT to the warped CFT in order to calculate the entropy for nonextremal Kerr black holes. Therein, the nontrivial diffeomorphisms lead to a Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra with nontrivial central extensions. Inspired by the Kerr/CFT correspondence, it is natural to extend the similar calculation to the family of black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory. We want to study the thermodynamic properties of a dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole, its gauged and ultraspinning counterparts. A nondyonic Kerr-Sen black hole has been investigated in Ref. [6] for an extremal case and in Ref. [41] for a nonextremal case showing that the central charge of this black hole is identical to a Kerr black hole which is the solution to the Einstein vacuum-field equation, although Kerr-Sen also possesses nonvanishing electric and dilaton charges. The solution of the dyonic case is provided in\nRef. [50], which is the extension of Ref. [51] for the nondyonic case, yet with nonzero cosmological constant (AdS length). This black hole family emerges in the lowenergy heterotic string theory that includes dilaton and axion. Since there exist scalar fields representing dilaton and axion, this solution will differ from dyonic KerrNewman (-AdS) black hole solution. One fascinating limit of a gauged dyonic black hole is the ultraspinning limit, i.e., the spin of the black hole is boosted to the value of AdS length. In the ultraspinning limit, the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole solution possesses a noncompact horizon and becomes superentropic. The noncompact horizon occurs due to the presence of conical singularity, while superentropic means that for a given volume V, the entropy will be maximized [52]. So far, the study for Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole has been done in Ref. [16] in the context of Kerr/CFT correspondence. In the present paper, it will be demonstrated that the Kerr/CFT correspondence is also valid for the dyonic black hole family in EMDA theory and indeed robust. First, we consider a dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and show that there are similar features between dyonic and nondyonic cases. This work is then extended to the gauged counterpart, then in the situation where the cosmological constant is nonzero, and finally when the ultraspinning limit is reached. It is intriguing also to compare the results with the dyonic KerrNewman-AdS black hole family. The paper is organized as follows. After the Introduction, we briefly review the dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and its thermodynamic properties in Sec. II. In Sec. IV, we investigate the near-horizon extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and derive its entropy using the Kerr/CFT correspondence. In Secs. IV and V, we extend the work from the previous section to the gauged dyonic KerrSen-AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart, respectively. In Sec. VI, we provide the comparison between the dual CFT of dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS and dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes. Section VII concludes our work."

            "text": "The dyonic NUT generalization of Kerr-Sen black hole solution was first given in Ref. [53] in ungauged case. However, in this paper, we set the Newman-UntiTamburino (NUT) parameter to zero, and consider only the dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole. The dyonic generalization of the Kerr-Sen solution without the NUT parameter is rewritten in Ref. [50] in a simpler form using certain coordinate transformations. In Ref. [50], the gauged solution of EMDA theory is also provided in a simpler way coming from the original derivation in Refs. [54,55]. In this section, we will briefly review the spacetime metric of the dyonic Kerr-Sen black holes which is given in Ref. [50]. The Lagrangian density of the EMDA theory that is\n106006-2\nconsidered to find a dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole is given by [55,56]\nL \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffi\u2212gp R \u2212 1\n2 \u00f0\u2202\u03d5\u00de2 \u2212 1 2 e2\u03d5\u00f0\u2202\u03c7\u00de2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03d5F2\n\u00fe \u03c7 2 \u03f5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bbF\u03bc\u03bdF\u03c1\u03bb ; \u00f02:1\u00de\nwhere \u03f5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb is the Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor density in 4D. The dual of the gauge potential B is defined by dB \u00bc \u2212e\u2212\u03d5\u22c6F \u2212 \u03c7F. The theory presented in Lagrangian density (2.1) has an SL\u00f02; R\u00de global symmetry that can transform the dyonic black hole to a purely electric or magnetic black hole. The dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole solution to that Lagrangian density is given in Eq. (4) in Ref. [50]. However, as mentioned in Ref.

These branches will reduce into one only when the spin approaches zero. In this case, the black hole solution will reduce to an extremal dyonic GMGHS (Gibbons-MaedaGarfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger) black hole with zero entropy [57]. This condition is distinctive from the extremal (dyonic) Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m solution which has nonzero entropy. Zero entropy is related to zero central charge in CFT. Vanishing cL is trivial and exactly denotes that the Virasoro algebra reduces to the classical Witt algebra.

First, we will find the near-horizon geometry of the extremal dyonic KerrSen black hole. To find the near-horizon geometry of the extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole (2.2), we consider the following coordinate transformations [5,58]:\nr\u0302\u00bc r\u00fe \u00fe \u03f5r0r; t\u0302\u00bc r0 \u03f5 t; \u03d5\u0302\u00bc \u03d5\u00fe\u03a9Hr0 \u03f5 t; \u00f03:2\u00de\nwhere r0 is a scaling constant where we may define r20 \u00bc r2\u00fe \u2212 d2 \u2212 k2 \u00fe a2. In the near-horizon limit, we have \u03f5 \u2192 0. We can obtain the near-horizon extremal metric of Eq.

This is the origin of how we infer that the AdS=CFT correspondence for black holes, namely Kerr/CFT, may apply. Since there exist several nonvanishing scalar and vector fields, it is also applicable to use the near-horizon coordinate transformation to those fields. In the near-horizon limit, we find that the gauge field and its dual are given by\nA\u00fe \u00bc fa\u00f0\u03b8\u00de\u00f0d\u03d5\u00feerdt\u00de\u00fe q\u00bd\u00f0m\u00fed\u00de2\u00fek2\u2212a2\u22122p2\ne\u00f0m2\u2212d2\u2212k2\u00fea2\u00de d\u03d5;\n\u00f03:4\u00de\nB\u00fe \u00bc fb\u00f0\u03b8\u00de\u00f0d\u03d5\u00feerdt\u00de\u00fe p\u00bd\u00f0m\u00fed\u00de2\u00fek2\u2212a2\u22122p2\ne\u00f0m2\u2212d2\u2212k2\u00fea2\u00de d\u03d5;\n\u00f03:5\u00de\nwhere the functions f\u00f0\u03b8\u00de for each field are given by\nfa\u00f0\u03b8\u00de\u00bc q\u00bd2p2\u2212 \u00f0m\u00fed\u00de2\u2212k2\u00fea2 cos2 \u03b8 \u00fe2apmcos\u03b8\n2am\u03f12\u00fe r20;\n\u00f03:6\u00de\nfb\u00f0\u03b8\u00de\u00bc p\u00bd2p2\u2212 \u00f0m\u00fed\u00de2\u2212k2\u00fea2cos2\u03b8 \u22122aqmcos\u03b8\n2am\u03f12\u00fe r20;\n\u00f03:7\u00de\nwhere we can gauge away the second term on the electromagnetic potential (3.4) and its dual (3.5).

However, basically their contribution will not appear directly to the central term. In order to find the isometry group of the near-horizon extremal metric (3.3), one can apply the Killing equation and solve it. In the end, by solving the Killing equation, it is found that the spacetime metric (3.3) possesses SL\u00f02; R\u00de \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00de isometry group which are represented by the following Killing fields:\n\u03b60 \u00bc \u2202\u03d5; \u00f03:9\u00de\nwhich denote the rotational U\u00f01\u00de isometry and\nX1\u00bc\u2202t; X2\u00bc t\u2202t\u2212r\u2202r; X3\u00bc\n1 2r2 \u00fe t\n2\n2\n\u2202t\u2212 tr\u2202r\u2212 e r \u2202\u03d5;\n\u00f03:10\u00de\nwhich generates SL\u00f02; R\u00de. The Killing vectors (3.9) and (3.10) fully denote an enhanced SL\u00f02; R\u00de \u00d7U\u00f01\u00de isometry group. This isometry resembles the isometry of AdS2 spacetime, so the asymptotic symmetry group as used by Brown and Henneaux [4] can be employed to compute the central charge. Note that only U\u00f01\u00de can be extended to a Virasoro algebra while the SL\u00f02; R\u00de is taken to be frozen at extremality [58]. Enticingly, for a nonextremal black hole, one can construct similar SL\u00f02; R\u00de \u00d7U\u00f01\u00de isometry where SL\u00f02; R\u00de isometry can be extended to Kac-Moody algebra [49]. In this case, one can extend the calculation to the entropy in warped CFT. However, we will not consider this case within this paper."

The boundary conditions are imposed in order to produce finite and integrable charges. There is not necessarily a unique set of consistent boundary conditions. Therefore, we adopt the boundary conditions such in most Kerr/CFT correspondence articles. In the basis \u00f0t; r; \u03b8;\u03d5\u00de, we impose the following boundary conditions:\nh\u03bc\u03bd \u223c 0 BBBBB@ O\u00f0r2\u00de O\u00f0 1r2\u00de O\u00f01r\u00de O\u00f01\u00de O\u00f0 1r3\u00de O\u00f0 1r2\u00de O\u00f01r\u00de\nO\u00f01r\u00de O\u00f01r\u00de O\u00f01\u00de\n1 CCCCCA : \u00f03:15\u00de\nThe most general diffeomorphism symmetry that preserves such boundary conditions (3.15) is generated by the following Killing vector field:\n\u03b6 \u00bc fct \u00feO\u00f0r\u22123\u00deg\u2202t \u00fe f\u2212r\u03f50\u00f0\u03d5\u00de \u00feO\u00f01\u00deg\u2202r \u00feO\u00f0r\u22121\u00de\u2202\u03b8 \u00fe f\u03f5\u00f0\u03d5\u00de \u00feO\u00f0r\u22122\u00deg\u2202\u03d5; \u00f03:16\u00de\nwhere ct is an arbitrary constant and the prime \u00f00\u00de denotes the derivative respect to \u03d5.

It is obtained that\ncL \u00bc 12am \u00bc 12J: \u00f03:21\u00de\nThis result is identical to the central charge of Kerr-Sen [6] and Kerr [3] black holes. However, we need to note that the relation between mass, spin, and electromagnetic charges is different from those of Kerr-Sen and Kerr black holes. For an extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole, the mass is given in Eq. (2.13). Each branch corresponds to CFT with the central charge cL \u00bc 12am , respectively. Recall that these branches will reduce into one only when the spin approaches zero denoting that cL also vanishes. This means that the entropy from CFTwill also vanish. Vanishing cL is trivial and exactly denotes that the Virasoro algebra reduces to the classical Witt algebra."

By following semiclassical quantization rules, the operators that define quantum gravity with the given boundary conditions form aVirasoro algebra. We have also provided scalar quantum fields in the analog of the Frolov-Thorne vacuum restricted to extremal excitations having the nonvanishing left-moving temperature. Since we identify the left sector with excitations along \u2202\u03d5 and the SL\u00f02; R\u00de isometry as the right sector is frozen, the states are described by a thermal density matrix with temperatures TL, Tq, and Tp.

Simultaneously, we have also reproduced the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a Kerr-Sen black hole by turning off p. Again, when we assume that q \u00bc p \u00bc 0, it reduces to the entropy of an extremal Kerr black hole. For a \u2192 0 but keeping p, q \u2260 0, this Cardy entropy will vanish, showing the entropy of an dyonic GMGHS black hole. This matching completes the conjecture of Kerr/CFT correspondence for extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen black holes in EMDA theory. This is clearly not a coincidence and shows that the dyonicKerr-Sen black hole is dual to 2DCFTrepresented by nonvanishing left-moving sector."

Since there exists the cosmological constant, this black hole possesses more than two horizons as we can see from \u0394, which is a quartic function. This means that there also exists cosmological horizons. From this dyonic Kerr-SenAdS black hole solution, we can find several solutions by taking certain limits. In order to find a Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole, one can turn off p \u00bc 0 that will cause k \u00bc 0. This implies \u03a8H \u00bc 0. When one consider equal charges q \u00bc p, this will result in d \u00bc 0 or no dilaton charge. On the other hand, we can find that \u03a6H \u00bc \u03a8H. Another fascinating property of this solution is we can find the superentropic solution of a dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole by taking a \u2192 l. Nevertheless, whether it is superentropic or not is defined by the value of l2 over \u00f0d2 \u00fe k2\u00de. Next, we consider the extremal limit for the gauged counterparts of the dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole with \u03940 \u00bc 0.

From the same lengthy calculation, we can obtain the left-moving central charge for the near-horizon extremal dyonic KerrSen-AdS black holes from EMDA theory. It is obtained that\ncL \u00bc 12ar\u00fe\n\u03c5 ; \u00f04:21\u00de\nwhere the event horizon \u03c5 and r\u00fe are given in (4.13) and (4.11), respectively.

It is also clear that by turning off p, q, we can find the central charge of a Kerr-AdS black hole [7]. Similarly, before going to match the entropy, it is required to calculate the corresponding temperatures. For the gauged case, the presence of the cosmological constant can be considered as the additional thermodynamic quantity in the thermodynamic equation. Hence, we can write the first law of black hole thermodynamics for this black hole where the extremal condition satisfies\ndM \u00bc \u03a9exH dJ \u00fe\u03a6exH dQ\u00fe \u03a8exH dP\u00fe VexdP; \u00f04:22\u00de\nsince TexH \u00bc 0.

Similar to the dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole, there exist temperatures conjugate to electric and magnetic charges aside from the right- and left-moving temperatures. The existence of cosmological constant is related to the presence of another temperature conjugate to the cosmological pressure which is defined as TP \u00bc \u2212 \u2202TH=\u2202r\u00fe\u2202V=\u2202r\u00fe jex, although\nwe only need the left-moving temperature in this case.

When we turn off both electromagnetic charges, the temperatures for Kerr-AdS black hole are then recovered. We have calculated the quantities that we need in Cardy formula; we can now compute it in (3.1). It is remarkably found that an extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole possesses the following CFT entropy:\nSCFT \u00bc \u03c0\n\u039e \u00f0r2\u00fe \u2212 d2 \u2212 k2 \u00fe a2\u00de: \u00f04:26\u00de\nThis result matches with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole. The entropy of a Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole and a Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole with vanishing axion charge can also be found from this. When we assume that q \u00bc p \u00bc 0, it reduces to the entropy of an extremal Kerr-AdS black hole [7]. It is worth noting that for Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes, there exists second dual CFT [5] which can be studied when considering a \u2192 0 and then proposing the electromagnetic field as the part of the geometry. In this second dual CFT, the temperatures Tq and Tp are useful to reveal the dual CFT of ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m black hole family. Nonetheless, for black hole solutions in EMDA theory, in this case the Kerr-Sen black hole [41], the second dual CFT fails to be shown. Hence, we will not further consider the second dual CFT for the dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole family in this paper."

DYONIC KERR-SEN-ADS AND KERRNEWMAN-AdS IN COMPARISON\nHere, we will compare the properties from CFT of the black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory, i.e., dyonic\nKerr-Newman-AdS solution and black hole in EMDA theory, i.e., dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole. The study of superentropic black hole from rotating black holes with nonvanishing cosmological constant has been proposed in Ref. [52] using the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole solution. Furthermore, the same thermodynamical properties for similar black hole solution from the Kerr/CFT duality point of view have been proposed. Using the Kerr/CFT method, authors in Ref. [16] calculated the entropy of extremal ultraspinning Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes. Both papers actually do not consider the existence of dyonic solution or nonzero magnetic charge. However, their results will not be so different from the dyonic solution if we just change q2 \u2192 q2 \u00fe p2, where p is the magnetic charge. In this section, we will compare the thermodynamical properties of the dyonic Kerr-NewmanAdS and dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes including their ultraspinning versions. Later on, we also compare with the result when we consider asymptotically dS spacetime."

It is crucial that for an extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole, m > 0; r2\u00fe > 0; x41 \u2212 16x42 \u00fe 2x43 > 0. These conditions lead to \u00f06r2\u00fe \u00fe a2 \u00fe l2\u00de=2> \u00f02r2\u00fe \u00fe a2 \u00fe l2\u00de=2> d2 \u00fe k2, implying that cL is always positive. Aside from the central\nTABLE I.

With the same conditions as cL, it can be shown that these quantities are always positive as well, similar to the dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS solution. Nonetheless, since d; k \u223c 1=m in a dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole, it becomes the main difference from the dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS solution because this leads to possibly more than two branches of mass with its own dual CFT. As explained in [52], an ultraspinning black hole might produce a superentropic black hole. It means that black holes have maximum upper entropy in superentropic circumstance. We have shown that an ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole always violates RII, likewise the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole. However, it is different from the ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole where the violation depends on the value of electromagnetic charges (or dilaton and axion charges), mass, and AdS length. The RII is given by\nR \u00bc r2\u00fe r2\u00fe \u2212 d2 \u2212 k2 \u00fe l2 1 6 : \u00f06:16\u00de\nExplicitly, if 0 \u2264 q2 \u00fe p2 < 2ml or 0 \u2264 d2 \u00fe k2 < l2, RII will be violated; then, the black hole is superentropic. Otherwise, if q2 \u00fe p2 \u2265 2ml or d2 \u00fe k2 \u2265 l2, RII will not be violated, and the black hole is subentropic. Notably, the extremal and nonextremal ultraspinning Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes [50] are not always superentropic depending on the value of d, k. This is different from an extremal ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole and its nondyonic counterpart, which are always superentropic. However, the similarity between the ultraspinning dyonic black holes happens to be on the positivity of the CFT quantities. Similar to the Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole with general spin, we can observe from Table II that the central charge for ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS is always positive. Since from the positivity of the mass we have r2\u00fe \u00fe l2 > d2 \u00fe k2, then the denominator of cL will always be positive because 3r2\u00fe \u00fe l2 > r2\u00fe \u00fe l2 > d2 \u00fe k2. From Table II, since 3r2\u00fe \u00fe l2 > r2\u00fe \u00fe l2 > d2 \u00fe k2, we can conclude that the central charge, temperature, and entropy of the extremal ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS solution are always positive, similar to the extremal ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS solution.\nThere is an interesting fact that central charge exactly can be negative. However, it is not for this asymptotically AdS black hole family. Yet, when we change the solution to have positive cosmological constant (or asymptotically dS) by l2 \u2192 \u2212l2, cL can be negative. For this \u201cdS\u201d type, note that we have the following relations:\nm \u00bc \u2212 r\u00fe l2 \u00f02r2\u00fe \u2212 2d2 \u2212 2k2 \u00fe a2 \u2212 l2\u00de;\nr2\u00fe \u00bc 2d2 \u00fe 2k2 \u2212 a2 \u00fe l2 \u00fe\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi x41 \u2212 16x42 \u00fe 2x43 p 6 ; \u00f06:17\u00de\nwhere x41 \u00bc a4 \u00fe 16d4 \u00fe 16k4 \u00fe l4, x42 \u00bc a2d2 \u00fe a2k2 \u2212 d2l2 \u2212 k2l2 \u2212 2d2k2, x43\u00bc\u22127a2l2\u22126l2q2\u22126l2p2, m > 0, and r2\u00fe > 0. Negative cL can be obtained when \u00f06r2\u00fe \u00fe a2 \u2212 l2\u00de=2 > d2 \u00fe k2. This is always valid as long as a black hole exists, i.e., the quantity x41\u221216x42\u00fe2x43>0 (when the square-root quantity is zero, exceptionally cL \u2192 \u221e). It is known that negative central charge exists in nonunitary CFT which may appear in a ghost system from string theory [61]. Moreover, there are possibly more than two branches of mass for this black hole resulting in more than two branches of CFT with different central charges, just like in the AdS type. Notably, when we consider RII for l2 \u2192 \u2212l2 in (6.16) it is obvious that R > 1, implying that a superentropic black hole cannot be obtained."

            "text": "We have demonstrated that the Kerr/CFT correspondence is explicitly well defined for a dyonic black hole family in EMDA theory, i.e., dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole, its gauged and ultraspinning counterparts. Our work enlarges the family of metrics respecting Kerr/CFT correspondence for dyonic black holes in EMDA theory. For a dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole, we have obtained that the central charge is identical to Kerr-Sen and Kerr black holes, yet with different constraint on the mass parameter due to the presence of dilaton and axion charges. Interestingly, due to the presence of these charges, we have found that the mass possesses two different branches leading also to the central charge of the CFTs with two different branches. The main upshot to prove that the entropy from CFT matches with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy has succeeded for this dyonic black hole family in EMDA theory. We then extend the duality calculation to the gauged and ultraspinning counterparts. Since there exist more than two horizons, we have had to approximate the single event horizon for its extremal case. Since for nongauged dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole the central charge could have two branches, we have argued that possibly there should be more than two branches of the mass for the gauged case that leads to more than two branches of the central charge and entropy. We have found that finite central charges for both\nTABLE II.

It has been proven also that the central charge, temperature, and entropy for these black holes are always positive. This extremal ultraspinning dyonic black hole and its nonextremal counterpart cannot always be superentropic in the ultraspinning limit depending on the value of d, k. We have also considered the asymptotically dS solution with l2 \u2192 \u2212l2 substitution. Interestingly in this case, the central charge can be negative unlike the AdS type. It is well known that negative central charge might appear in nonunitary CFT, for example in string theory. It will be interesting for future investigation. In conclusion, our calculations have supported the Kerr/ CFT correspondence conjecture. This result suggests that\nthe extremal rotating dyonic black holes in EMDA theory are holographically dual to 2D CFT represented by nonvanishing left-moving central charge. For the future investigation, it would b e intriguing to explore the hidden conformal symmetry from the nonextremal dyonic black hole family in EMDA theory using the scalar field and higher spin fields."
