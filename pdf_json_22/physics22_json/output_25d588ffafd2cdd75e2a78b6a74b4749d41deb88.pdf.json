A recently proposed positron acceleration scheme relying on the wake generated by an electron drive beam in a plasma column has been shown to be able to accelerate positron witness beams with low emittance and low energy spread. However, since this scheme relies on cylindrical symmetry, it is possibly prone to transverse instabilities that could lead, ultimately, to beam breakup.

INTRODUCTION\nThe ability to build the next, TeV-class linear particle collider is severely constrained due to its high construction costs and power consumption. Providing extreme accelerating gradients, plasma-based accelerators potentially enable compact linear colliders, promising drastic cost reductions [1,2]. In a plasma-based accelerator, either an intense laser pulse [3] or an ultrarelativistic, highcharge particle bunch [4] drives a plasma wake, which can sustain accelerating gradients on the order of tens to hundreds of GV=m. Although high-energy-gain [5,6], high-efficiency [7], and low-energy-spread [8] electron acceleration was demonstrated experimentally, positron acceleration with collider-relevant parameters is significantly more challenging. Several concepts have been proposed, including utilizing positron drive beams [9], use of hollow-core drive beams [10] or lasers pulses [11], a combination of particle and laser drivers [12], or use of the rear portion of a blowout bubble wake [13]. Unfortunately, these concepts lack low emittance, low energy spread, or reasonable efficiency.\nHollow core plasma channels have been a promising candidate [14,15], but they suffer from instabilities due to the absence of focusing fields for the drive beam [14,16]. Using asymmetric drive beams provides stability in at least one transverse direction [17], but only positron beams with large beam emittances (>50 \u03bcm rad) could be accelerated, which is too large for collider applications. It was found that the wake generated in a thin, warm, quasi-hollow plasma channel provides accelerating fields for positrons while being robust against instabilities [18]; however, this scheme was demonstrated for a positron beam with several \u03bcm rad emittance and several percent relative energy spread only, i.e., beam quality too poor for a collider. In Ref. [19], a concept was proposed that utilizes an electron drive beam and a plasma column to generate positron-accelerating and focusing wakefield structures and has shown sub-\u03bcm rad emittance and sub-percent energy spread positron acceleration [19,20]. Since the scheme relies on cylindrical symmetry, one might expect it to be prone to beam breakup instabilities similar to the ones affecting the hollow core plasma channel. In a recent study [21], the electron driver was found to propagate stably in a plasma column for initial misalignments smaller than the beam size. Still, neither the effect of a misaligned drive beam on the witness beam nor the stability of a misaligned witness beam itself has been investigated so far. In this article, we demonstrate by means of theory and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations the stability of a positron *severin.diederichs@desy.de Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

            "text": "As was first discussed in Ref. [19], if an electron beam drives a wake in a plasma column with a column radius smaller than the blowout radius, the transverse wakefields are reduced outside the column due to the lack of ions. The reduced focusing fields induce a spread in the background plasma electron trajectories moving near the boundary of the blowout wake, which return to the propagation axis over an elongated longitudinal region, forming a high-density electron filament at some distance behind the drive beam. The filament creates a wakefield suitable for acceleration and transport of a trailing witness positron bunch, as shown in the left column (a)\u2013(c) of Fig. 1, where we plot the plasma charge density (a), normalized to en0, where e is the elementary charge and n0 is the ambient plasma density, respectively, and the accelerating (b) and focusing (c) fields, normalized to the cold, nonrelativistic wave-breaking field E0 \u00bc mec2kp=e, in the x-\u03b6-plane. Hereby, kp \u00bc \u00f04\u03c0n0e2=mec2\u00de1=2 is the plasma wave number, e is the electron charge, me is the electron mass, c is the speed of light in vacuum, x is the transverse coordinate, \u03b6 \u00bc z \u2212 ct is the longitudinal comoving variable, with z and t being the longitudinal coordinate and the time, respectively. We use a biGaussian electron drive beam with a peak current Id=IA \u00bc 1, and root-mean-square (rms) sizes \u03c3z;d \u00bc 1.41 k\u22121p (longitudinal) and \u03c3x;d \u00bc \u03c3y;d \u00bc 0.05 k\u22121p (transverse), with IA \u00bc mec3=e \u2243 17 kA being the Alfve\u0301n current. The plasma column has a radius Rp \u00bc 2.5 k\u22121p . For simplicity, a column with a transverse steplike profile is used, however, the scheme also works for realistic, smooth profiles like the ones obtainable via optical field ionization [22\u201326].\nIn the presented configuration, a helium plasma ionized to the first level is assumed within the column radius and neutral helium gas outside of the column radius. Helium is optimal owing to its high ionization threshold. The usable density range for the plasma column scheme is limited by the wakefield-induced ionization at the boundary of the column. Since the wakefield amplitude scales as E \u223c E0 \u221d n 1=2 0 , if the density is too high, the wakefield within the blowout radius (which exceeds the column radius) ionizes the neutral gas outside of the column, causing the column to expand and perturb the positron accelerating and focusing fields. Additionally, the space charge fields of the drive beam can further ionize the plasma in the column to a higher ionization level and disturb the wakefield. For the above drive beam parameters, the maximum densities in a helium plasma and hydrogen plasma are \u22431\u00d71017 cm\u22123 and \u2243 5 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123, respectively. A transverse displacement of the drive beam centroid by one rms size, Xd;0 \u00bc \u03c3x;d, modifies the electron trajectories asymmetrically, perturbing the wake centroid hWi at the back of the blowout. The effect of a misaligned drive beam\n091304-2\nis shown in the right column (d)\u2013(f) of Fig. 1. The stable propagation of a misaligned electron drive beam has been shown in a recent study [21]. There, the transversely displaced drive beam was found to be attracted to the center of the plasma column. Although an initial misalignment was found to seed the hosing instability [27], the induced oscillation is damped by various well-known mechanisms such as ion motion [28], energy spread [29], and others [30,31]. Thus, transversely displaced drive beams undergo damped oscillations and drift toward the plasma column axis. For the drive beam parameters presented in this work, and assuming a background density of 1 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123, a positional alignment at the \u03bcm level and an angular alignment on the \u227210 \u03bcrad-level are required for stable drive beam propagation in meter-scale plasma columns. The effect of a misaligned drive beam on the positron witness bunch is discussed in the next sections."

            "heading": "III. STABILITY OF THE WITNESS BEAM",
            "text": "Based on the premise that the drive beam is stable, we now investigate the witness beam stability and the witness beam quality degradation in the presence of a misaligned drive or witness beam using 3D PIC simulations with the quasistatic code HiPACE++ [32]. In the simulations, the computational domain is \u00f0\u221216; 16\u00de \u00d7 \u00f0\u221216; 16\u00de \u00d7 \u00f0\u221214; 6\u00de k\u22123p in x \u00d7 y \u00d7 \u03b6, where x and y are the transverse coordinates. The mesh resolution is 0.0078 \u00d7 0.0078\u00d7 0.001 k\u22123p . The same drive beam and helium plasma column parameters, as in Sec. II, are used. The helium plasma is modeled by electrons and ions with 16 macroparticles per cell each. The drive beam has an initial energy of 5 GeV, no energy spread, and a normalized emittance of \u03f50 \u00bc 0.18 k\u22121p , which is matched to the focusing field provided by the background ions in the column. The drive beam is sampled with 107 macroparticles. The simulation is propagated for 1000 time steps with a constant time step of \u0394t \u00bc 5\u00f0ckp\u00de\u22121. The witness beam has a transversely Gaussian and a longitudinally tailored profile. To preclude hosing suppression due to the presence of a slice-dependent energy chirp along the positron beam [29] (the energy spread required to suppress the instability is several percent, and this might be incompatible with collider applications), we use a witness beam current profile that optimally loads the wake, minimizing the development of a correlated energy spread. As shown in Ref. [20], the current profile that flattens the accelerating wakefield by optimal beamloading is nontrivial for the nonlinear positron-accelerating wake. To approximately flatten the wakefield, we consider a current profile that captures the salient features of the one described in Ref. [20]. This is obtained by linearly combining two Gaussian distributions centered in \u03b60;w1 \u00bc \u221211.57 k\u22121p and \u03b60;w2 \u00bc \u221211.3 k\u22121p , and with a length of\n\u03c3z;w1 \u00bc 0.5 k\u22121p and \u03c3z;w2 \u00bc 0.2 k\u22121p , respectively. The corresponding peak densities are nw1=n0 \u00bc 260 and nw2=n0 \u00bc 44.6. The transverse size of the witness bunch is \u03c3x;w \u00bc \u03c3y;w \u00bc 0.029 k\u22121p , its initial energy is 1 GeV, it has no initial energy spread, and the initial normalized emittance is \u03f5x \u00bc \u03f5y \u00bc 0.1 k\u22121p (corresponding to 0.75 \u03bcm rad for n0 \u00bc 5 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123). The witness bunch is sampled with 1.25 \u00d7 108 macroparticles. After presenting the basic numerical setting, we now analyze the evolution of the witness beam in the case of various misalignments of the witness beam centroid, the drive beam centroid, or both with respect to the plasma column axis. The evolution of the witness bunch centroid Xw is shown in Fig. 2(a), where we plot the difference\n091304-3\nbetween the witness beam centroid Xw and the wakefield centroid, which we define as the zero crossing of the transverse focusing field, at the phase location of the witness bunch hWi. In the next paragraphs, different beam configurations are reviewed in detail. First, the setup of an on-axis drive beam and a misaligned witness beam is considered. In this configuration, a small initial transverse witness beam offset (Xw;0\u00bc 0.2\u03c3x;w, solid blue line) and a larger witness beam offset (Xw;0 \u00bc \u03c3x;w, dash-dotted red line) are tested. For both offsets, the witness beam centroid quickly converges to the wake centroid via a strongly damped oscillation. For the small initial transverse beam offset, we also test higher initial witness beam energies, namely 5 GeV (dashed red line) and 10 GeV (dash-dotted green line) as shown in Fig. 2(b). To keep the witness beams quasimatched [19], their transverse rms sizes are reduced \u03c3x;w \u00bc \u03c3y;w \u00bc 0.017 k\u22121p and \u03c3x;w \u00bc \u03c3y;w \u00bc 0.0135 k\u22121p for 5 GeVand 10 GeV, respectively. The initial offset is kept constant relative to the reduced beam size with Xw;0 \u00bc 0.2\u03c3x;w. As shown in Fig. 2(b), a higher witness beam energy results in a longer damping length. Second, the setup of a misaligned drive beam and an onaxis witness beam is considered. For initial displacements of Xd;0 \u00bc 0.2\u03c3x;w and Xw;0 \u00bc 0 [dashed green line in Fig. 2(a)], the witness beam centroid again quickly converges to the wake centroid in a damped oscillation. Small deviations of the witness beam centroid from the wake centroid are caused by small asymmetries of the wakefield around the zero crossing so that the bunch equilibrium distribution in that wake is itself slightly asymmetric, implying a small offset of the centroid. Notably, the witness beam centroid stays aligned with the wake centroid, even if the wake centroid is changing due to the evolution of the drive beam. Finally, the same behavior is also observed in the most challenging setup of a misaligned drive beam and a misaligned witness beam, where both the drive and the witness beams are misaligned by Xd;0\u00bc 0.2\u03c3x;w and Xw;0 \u00bc 0.2\u03c3x;w, respectively [dotted orange line in Fig. 2(a)]. Hereby, we chose the most challenging case, where both beams are displaced in the same direction, which increases the offset between Xw and hWi, see Fig. 1. Due to its lower energy, the witness beam adjusts to the (slowly) evolving wake centroid driven by the 5-GeV drive beam. Thus, we also tested quasimatched, higher witness beam energies of 5 GeV [dashed red line in Fig. 2(c)] and 10 GeV [dashdotted green line in Fig. 2(c)] to verify the stability even in cases where the witness beam is evolving at a slower rate compared to the drive beam. Despite the increased damping length due to the higher witness beam energy, the witness is still able to follow the wake centroid. The inset in (c) shows the corresponding witness beam centroids Xw along the propagation distance without the subtraction of the wake centroid. In the presented cases, the witness beam centroids are displaced from the column axis. Since the attraction of\nthe drive beam toward the column center is rather slow (see Ref. [21]), the initial drive beam offset is not fully corrected during the propagation. The resulting nonzero wake centroid leads to a displacement of the witness beam centroids. We also considered cases where the drive and witness beams are offset in orthogonal directions (results not shown), but we did not observe any detrimental coupling between the motion in the two planes. In all presented cases, the oscillation of the positron witness beam centroid is quickly damped and the witness centroid converges to the wake centroid. The damping is caused by two effects that result in high stability of the witness beam toward transverse displacements: first, the oscillation is damped due to the longitudinally varying focusing fields (see Fig. 1), which has also been observed in other positron acceleration schemes [18]. This effect is similar to the Balakin-Novokhatsky-Smirnov (BNS) damping mechanism [33] in conventional accelerators and has been discussed in the context of quasilinear wakefields in Ref. [31]. Second, the nonlinear transverse wakefields cause phase mixing within a single slice of the beam that ultimately leads to a damping of the witness beam centroid motion. The scaling of the damping due to the nonlinear transverse wakefields can be obtained from a simplified theoretical model, described in Appendix A. In the simplified model (see also Ref. [19]), we consider a flat beam (i.e., \u03c3x \u226b \u03c3y) in a steplike confining wakefield, namely \u00f0Ex \u2212 By\u00de=E0 \u00bc \u2212\u03b1 sgn\u00f0x\u00de, where x is the transverse coordinate, \u03b1 is the strength of the wakefield, and sgn\u00f0x\u00de is the sign function. The evolution of the drive beam is neglected (i.e., the confining wake is constant), we neglect head-to-tail effects (i.e., we consider damping in a slice at a given longitudinal location along the beam), and we assume the acceleration to be slow (i.e., the particle energy changes significantly over distances longer than the characteristic betatron period). Finally, we assume the centroid displacement is small compared to the characteristic beam size, namely Xw;0 \u226a \u03c3x;w. With these assumptions, the evolution of the beam centroid Xw is found to be a damped oscillation with a damping length Sdamp scaling as\nkpSdamp \u221d ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi kp\u03c3x;w\u03b3\n\u03b1\nr : \u00f01\u00de\nNotably, and confirmed by the simulations, the damping length does not depend on the initial offset (at least for small displacements). The scaling of the damping length with \u03b3, \u03b1, and \u03c3x;w is in good agreement with the simulation results. Since the damping is caused by phase mixing, the damping length is linked to the spread of the betatron frequencies within the bunch. In the case of a Gaussian betatron wave number distribution, the damping length is proportional to Sdamp;Gauss \u221d 1=\u03c3k\u03b2 , where \u03c3k\u03b2 is the rms\n091304-4\nspread of betatron wave numbers. Although the wave number distribution within the bunch is not Gaussian in this case, their distribution can be used to quantify which mechanism dominates the damping process between (i) BNS damping due to the longitudinally varying focusing strength resulting in a \u03b6-dependent betatron period for particles in different bunch slices, and (ii) nonlinear focusing wakefield resulting in an amplitude-dependent betatron period for the particles in a beam slice. Therefore, we examine the distribution of betatron frequencies within the witness bunch. Using the example with the misaligned witness beam with an initial offset of Xw;0 \u00bc 0.2\u03c3x;w, the betatron frequencies are extracted from 1D test particles simulations by employing a second-order particle pusher and using the initial focusing field of the PIC simulation along x at various slices in the beam. Note that it is possible to obtain the betatron frequencies directly from the PIC simulation, but it is impractical due to the acceleration of the particles and the required data intensity as a short output period is needed for reasonable accuracy. The distribution of the wave numbers of the test particles, k\u03b2=kp, along the bunch is shown in Fig. 3. The red dots and bars denote the per-slice average hk\u03b2i and the per-slice rms spread \u03c3k\u03b2 of the betatron wave number, respectively. We define the head and the tail of the bunch as the slices at \u03b6 \u00bc \u03c3z and \u03b6 \u00bc \u2212\u03c3z. Then, the head-to-tail wave number spread is obtained as the difference between the mean betatron wave numbers at the head and at the tail and is visualized in the plot as a black bar. As shown, the head-totail wave number spread, which is caused by the longitudinal variation of the focusing field, is approximately 4 times larger than the average intraslice wave number spread caused by the transverse nonlinearity of the focusing field.\nThus, the variance of the focusing field along the bunch dominates the damping of the positron bunch. Note that the longitudinal variance strongly depends on the beamloading of the witness bunch."

            "text": "Having discussed the positron stability, we now address the effect of an initial misalignment on the beam quality. For the cases described in Fig. 2(a), the effect of the misalignment on the emittance, energy gain, and relative energy spread of the positron witness beam are shown in Figs. 4(a)\u20134(c). For a small witness beam offset (solid blue line), the emittance grows only by a few percent in comparison to the aligned case (solid gray line). A large witness beam offset (dash-dotted red line), a drive beam offset (dotted green line), or both (dashed orange line) degrade the emittance due to the larger initial difference between wake centroid and beam centroid. Nevertheless, the emittance growth saturates as soon as the beam centroid converges to the wake centroid. This is also the case for the misaligned drive beam, where the wake centroid is evolving. The energy and the relative energy spread are not sensitive to initial misalignments of the beam centroids, and\n091304-5\nresults differ only marginally from the aligned case. Notably, no positrons are lost during the stabilization process in all studied cases. To gain a further understanding of the effect of an initial offset of the witness beam centroid on the emittance, we use the model for the emittance growth at saturation presented in Ref. [19]. In the model, the same general assumptions as in the previous section are made. Then, assuming a small relative initial offset of the witness beam \u0394x \u00bc Xw;0=\u03c3x \u2272 1, the emittance growth at saturation is given by\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi hx2ihu2xi p \u03c3x\u03c3ux \u2248 8 45 1\u00fe 4 \u03c0 \u00f01\u00fe \u03942x\u00de \u00fe ffiffiffi 2 \u03c0 r \u03b7\u22121\u00f02\u00fe 3\u03942x\u00de\n\u00fe 5 2\nffiffiffi 2\n\u03c0\nr \u03b7 1\u00fe \u0394 2 x\n2 \u00fe 3 4 \u03b72 1=2 ; \u00f02\u00de\nwith\n\u03b7 \u00bc \u03c3 2 ux\nkp\u03c3x\u03b3\u03b1 : \u00f03\u00de\nA detailed derivation of Eq. (2) is presented in Appendix B. We now compare the emittance growth obtained from the model with results from the PIC simulations. The emittance growth at saturation is estimated using Eq. (2) with an energy of \u03b3 \u00bc 2000, an initial transverse beam size of \u03c3x \u00bc 0.029 k\u22121p , an initial emittance of \u03f50 \u00bc 0.1 k\u22121p , and a field strength of \u03b1 \u00bc 0.5, which is extracted from the PIC simulation with aligned beams with respect to the column axis. For the aligned case with \u0394x \u00bc 0, the small offset case with \u0394x \u00bc 0.2, and the large offset case with \u0394x \u00bc 1, the predicted emittance growth is 6%, 8%, and 50%, respectively. While the emittance growth predicted by the simplified model is in reasonable agreement with the simulation in the aligned and small offset cases, it is significantly underestimated in the large offset case. A reason for the underestimation is that the beamloading effect on the transverse wakefield of a high-charge, strongly misaligned witness beam is not captured by the model. In the case of a large offset, the transverse focusing field is asymmetrically altered, thus the assumption of a simple steplike wake in the model is not fulfilled anymore. Therefore, the model provides a reasonable scaling only for small offsets. Additionally, some of the assumptions (flat beam, neglect of head-to-tail effects) made in the model are not fulfilled in the full PIC simulation, so the model should be used for qualitative purposes only. In summary, the nonlinearity of the focusing field transversely provides stability as initial offsets are quickly damped due to the phase mixing of the particles. However, this mechanism comes at a cost, since the phase mixing increases the witness beam size and the emittance."

            "text": "In this paper, positron acceleration in a plasma column is shown to be inherently stable: in case of misalignments between the drive and witness beams with respect to the plasma column, the witness beam centroid is attracted to the centroid of the focusing wake and the witness beam is not susceptible to the hosing instability due to a longitudinally varying and transversely nonlinear focusing field in the region of the positron bunch. The initial misalignment is corrected via a damped oscillation, which affects the witness beam quality. A scaling for the damping length of the oscillation and the induced emittance growth is presented. By analysis of the betatron wave numbers distribution within the bunch, the variation of the focusing field along the bunch is identified to be the dominating effect in the damping. To achieve high-quality positron acceleration, the alignment of drive and witness beam with respect to the plasma column is essential, but, in principle, achievable due to the intrinsic stability, which allows for the implementation of active feedback loops. Plasma columns enable stable, low-emittance, low-energy-spread positron acceleration as required for a linear collider. Initial experiments of this configuration may be performed at beam test facilities, such as FACET-II [34].\nData availability.\u2014The input scripts for the PIC simulations used in Figs. 2 and 4 are available online [35].

            "text": "Here we derive an expression for the characteristic damping length of the positron witness beam centroid oscillations. In the derivation, the following assumptions are made: (1) The transverse wakefield close to the axis is approximately steplike (see Fig. 4 in Ref. [19]) and is\n091304-6\ndescribed by \u00f0Ex \u2212 By\u00de=E0 \u00bc \u2212\u03b1 sgn\u00f0x\u00de, with sgn\u00f0x\u00de being the sign function, and the field strength \u03b1 > 0 a constant, respectively. (2) The drive beam evolution is neglected and the transverse wakefield is constant in time. (3) The beam is considered to be flat, i.e., \u03c3w;x \u226b \u03c3w;y and \u03c3ux \u226b \u03c3uy , with \u03c3ux and \u03c3uy being the transverse rms momentum spreads in x and y direction, respectively. (4) The acceleration process is adiabatic (i.e., the single particle action is conserved). (5) A small centroid offset is considered, namely Xw;0 \u226a \u03c3x;w. The damping length depends on the spread in betatron frequencies of the particles in the beam and this, in turn, depends on the beam\u2019s initial phase-space distribution. Analytical calculations for the damping length are tractable in the case of an initial phase-space distribution that is perfectly matched (in the case without centroid displacement) in the idealized steplike wakefield (i.e., the unperturbed phase-space distribution is a stationary solution of the Vlasov equation for the system). Note that, as explained in Ref. [19], the Gaussian distribution that is used as the initial condition in all the simulations presented in this work is not a stationary solution of the Vlasov equation. Hence, in our calculations, we will consider an exponential distribution (see below for details on its definition). We verified numerically that the damping length for an exponential distribution is comparable to that of a quasimatched initial Gaussian distribution with the same rms size (the exponential distribution is a good proxy for a Gaussian distribution). Extension of the results to other types of matched initial distributions is straightforward. The calculation of the beam centroid evolution requires first determining the centroid motion for a displaced beam with a Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij (KV) [37] phase-space distribution (KV beamlet, note that an undisplaced KV beam is also a stationary solution of the Vlasov equation, see Sec. A 1). Then, the centroid evolution for the whole beam is obtained by considering that a generic matched beam can be decomposed into a sum of KV beamlets (see Sec. A 2)."

The particles in the displaced beamlet can be categorized into three subsections: first, the particles with x < 0 (solid red line, we denote this set of particles with the symbol C\u2212) that satisfy\n091304-7\nu2x 2\u03b3 \u00fe \u03b1kpjxj \u00bc \u03b1kp\u00f0X0 \u2212 Xw;0\u00de: \u00f0A9\u00de\nSecond, the particles with x > Xw;0 (solid blue line, C\u00fe) that satisfy\nu2x 2\u03b3 \u00fe \u03b1kpjxj \u00bc \u03b1kp\u00f0X0 \u00fe Xw;0\u00de; \u00f0A10\u00de\nand third, the remaining particles with 0 < x < Xw;0 (solid black lines, C0). When comparing Eqs. (A9) and (A10) with Eq. (A4), one can see that the particles in C\u2212 and C\u00fe are effectively part of KV beamlets with parameters X0 \u2212 Xw;0 and X0 \u00fe Xw;0, respectively. Thus, during evolution, the particles initially in C\u2212 and C\u00fe remain in their respective perturbed KV orbits with sizes X0 \u2213 Xw;0, as indicated by the dashed lines in the corresponding colors in Fig. 5. The particles in C0 fill the space area between the red and the blue orbits (filamentation), but the fraction of such particles is small for small centroid displacements. Hence, we see that we can represent a displaced KV beamlet as the sum of two half KV beamlets of different characteristic sizes. From Eq. (A7), the betatron wave numbers for the particles in C are k \u03b2 \u00bc k\u03b2;KV\u00f0X0 Xw;0\u00de, which reduce, for small offsets Xw;0=X0 \u226a 1, to\nk \u03b2 \u00bc k0\u03b2 1 \u2213 1\n2 Xw;0 X0 : \u00f0A11\u00de\nTo calculate the evolution of the centroid of the full, displaced KV beamlet Xw;KV, the centroids and the fraction\nof particles in C\u2212, C\u00fe, and C0 must be computed. Starting with the latter, we define f\u2212, f\u00fe, and f0 as the fraction of particles in C\u2212, C\u00fe, and C0, respectively. We have f\u2212 \u00fe f\u00fe \u00fe f0 \u00bc 1.
