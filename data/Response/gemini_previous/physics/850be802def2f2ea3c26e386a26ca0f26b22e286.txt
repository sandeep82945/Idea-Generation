1. **Investigate the use of other transition metals or metal-free catalysts for the N-O bond cleavage of oximes and hydroxylamines.** This could lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable methods for the synthesis of N-heterocycles.


2. **Explore the use of oximes and hydroxylamines as precursors for the synthesis of other types of heterocycles, such as furans, thiophenes, and pyrazoles.** This could expand the scope of N-heterocycle synthesis and provide access to new and interesting compounds with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and other fields.


3. **Develop new methods for the enantioselective synthesis of N-heterocycles using oximes and hydroxylamines.** This is a challenging but important area of research, as enantiopure N-heterocycles are often required for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other chiral compounds.


4. **Investigate the use of oximes and hydroxylamines in the synthesis of natural products and bioactive compounds.** This could lead to the discovery of new drugs and other therapeutic agents.


5. **Explore the use of oximes and hydroxylamines in the synthesis of functional materials, such as polymers, semiconductors, and catalysts.** This could lead to the development of new materials with improved properties and applications in various fields.
