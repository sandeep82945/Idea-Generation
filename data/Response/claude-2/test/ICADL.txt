 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore different neural network architectures for the abstractive summarization step. The paper uses BART, but other models like T5, PEGASUS or GPT-3 could be experimented with to see if they can further improve performance. 

2. Incorporate citation information into the model. The paper mentions citation-based summarization as an active area of research. The model could be enhanced by taking into account how the paper being summarized cites and is cited by other papers.

3. Evaluate the approach on a larger and more diverse scientific paper dataset. The model was only evaluated on a dataset of computer science papers. Testing it on datasets from other scientific domains could reveal new challenges.

4. Develop methods to improve summarization of papers with poor formatting or structure. The error analysis revealed issues with summarizing papers not properly formatted. New techniques could be developed to handle these cases.

5. Explore semi-supervised or unsupervised training methods. The model requires a dataset of paper-summary pairs for supervised learning. Investigating unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches could reduce the need for large labeled datasets.
