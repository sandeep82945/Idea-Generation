    "abstractText": "Oxygen sensing mechanisms are essential for metazoans, their origin and evolution in the context of oxygen in Earth history are of interest. To trace the evolution of a main oxygen sensing mechanism among metazoans, the hypoxia induced factor, HIF, we investigated the phylogenetic distribution and phylogeny of 11 of its components across 566 eukaryote genomes. The HIF based oxygen sensing machinery in eukaryotes can be traced as far back as 800million years (Ma) ago, likely to the last metazoan common ancestor (LMCA), and arose at a time when the atmospheric oxygen content corresponded roughly to the Pasteur point, or roughly 1% of present atmospheric level (PAL). By the time of the Cambrian explosion (541\u2013485 Ma) as oxygen levels started to approach those of the modern atmosphere, the HIF system with its key components HIF1\u03b1, HIF1\u03b2, PHD1, PHD4, FIH and VHL was well established across metazoan lineages. HIF1\u03b1 is more widely distributed and therefore may have evolved earlier than HIF2\u03b1 and HIF3\u03b1, and HIF1\u03b2 and is more widely distributed than HIF2\u03b2 in invertebrates. PHD1, PHD4, FIH, and VHL appear in all 13 metazoan phyla. The O2 consuming enzymes of the pathway, PHDs and FIH, have a lower substrate affinity, Km, for O2 than terminal oxidases in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in line with their function as an environmental signal to switch to anaerobic energy metabolic pathways. The ancient HIF system has been conserved and widespread during the period when metazoans evolved and diversified together with O2 during Earth history.",

To trace the evolution of a main oxygen sensing mechanism among metazoans, the hypoxia induced factor, HIF, we investigated the phylogenetic distribution and phylogeny of 11 of its components across 566 eukaryote genomes. The HIF based oxygen sensing machinery in eukaryotes can be traced as far back as 800million years (Ma) ago, likely to the last metazoan common ancestor (LMCA), and arose at a time when the atmospheric oxygen content corresponded roughly to the Pasteur point, or roughly 1% of present atmospheric level (PAL). By the time of the Cambrian explosion (541\u2013485 Ma) as oxygen levels started to approach those of the modern atmosphere, the HIF system with its key components HIF1\u03b1, HIF1\u03b2, PHD1, PHD4, FIH and VHL was well established across metazoan lineages. HIF1\u03b1 is more widely distributed and therefore may have evolved earlier than HIF2\u03b1 and HIF3\u03b1, and HIF1\u03b2 and is more widely distributed than HIF2\u03b2 in invertebrates. PHD1, PHD4, FIH, and VHL appear in all 13 metazoan phyla. The O2 consuming enzymes of the pathway, PHDs and FIH, have a lower substrate affinity, Km, for O2 than terminal oxidases in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in line with their function as an environmental signal to switch to anaerobic energy metabolic pathways. The ancient HIF system has been conserved and widespread during the period when metazoans evolved and diversified together with O2 during Earth history.\nKEYWORDS\nanaerobes, metazoan, origin, oxygen sensing mechanism, terminal oxidase\nIntroduction\nOxygen on Earth stems from cyanobacterial photosynthesis. During Earth history, there were two main phases of atmospheric oxygen content change (Mills et al., 2022). The first was the great oxidation event, GOE, around 2.4 billion years (Ga) ago (Bekker et al., 2004), followed by almost 2 Ga of low oxygen levels and a second, late rise of oxygen corresponding to the origin of land plants and animals"

The metazoan lineage arose roughly 700\u20131000 Ma ago, long before the origin of land plants, during a phase of Earth history when oxygen levels were much lower than today\u2019s. The first metazoans were thus well adapted to low oxygen environments from the outset of their evolution, but adapted to rising oxygen levels during evolution, particularly with the transition to life on land in a highly oxic atmosphere starting about 450 Ma ago (Martin et al., 2021). Oxygen sensing pathways in animals are integral to their evolution during changing oxygen concentrations (Hammarlund et al., 2020) in Earth history. The main oxygen sensing pathway in animals is mediated by hypoxiainducible factors, HIFs (Semenza 2001; Kaelin and Ratcliffe 2008; Zhang et al., 2014; Ivan and Kaelin 2017). The alpha subunit of HIF1, HIF1\u03b1 is posttranslational modified by prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1\u20144), which catalyze the O2 dependent hydroxylation of prolyl residues, inducing ubiquitinylation of HIF by the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) (Brihimi-Horn and Pouyss\u00e9gur 2009), leading to HIF1\u03b1 degradation by proteasomes (Figure 1). The factor inhibiting HIF, FIH, hydroxylates asparaginyl residues in\nthe alpha subunit of HIFs (HIF1\u20143\u03b1), in an O2 dependent reaction, which inhibits proline hydroxylation (Figure 1). HIF1\u03b1 and PHDs are constitutively expressed. When O2 is lacking, the alpha subunit of HIFs is not hydroxylated by PHDs and therefore not degraded, but accumulates and is transported into the cell nucleus to create a heterodimer with the beta subunit of HIFs (HIF1\u03b2 and 2\u03b2). The HIF\u03b1\u03b2heterodimer acts as the transcription factor, which binds to corresponding hypoxia response elements (HRE) of the promoters of the HIF-target genes to stimulate or repress the downstream gene transcription activities which can elicit a series of biological responses (Brihimi-Horn and Pouyss\u00e9gur 2009) (Figure 1). As it relates to energy metabolism, the main biological response governed by the HIF pathway is a shift from aerobic energy metabolism to anaerobic energy metabolism, which in land mammals, diverts pyruvate flux away from mitochondria and O2 dependent terminal oxidases towards cytosolic fermentations (Samanta and Semenza 2018).\nThe mechanism of the main oxygen sensing pathway is well known and its origin and distribution have also been widely studied from the phylogenetic perspective (Rytk\u00f6nen\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org02\net al., 2011; Rytk\u00f6nen and Storz 2011; Mills et al., 2018; Rytk\u00f6nen 2018; Graham and Barreto 2019; Graham and Barreto 2020) but less so from the geological perspective (Taylor and McElwain 2010; Hammarlund 2020). One hypothesis is that the main oxygen sensing pathway may have already occurred in the common ancestor of metazoans (Hammarlund et al., 2018; Hammarlund 2020). PHD like prolyl hydroxylases have been reported in unicellular eukaryotes such as Dictyostelium (Van der Wel et al., 2005) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Lee et al., 2009) and pathogenic proteobacteria like Vibrio cholerae (Aravind and Koonin 2001; McDonough et al., 2006) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Aravind and Koonin 2001; Scotti et al., 2014). The HIF\u03b1/PHD/VHL pathway is conserved in all animals but is not found in choanoflagellates (Monosiga brevicollis) or other protists (Loenarz et al., 2011), it is present in all eumetazoans, except Ctenophera (Mills et al., 2018). A recent study showed that choanoflagellates have PHD but not HIF and VHL (Rytk\u00f6nen 2018). HIF1\u03b1 is conserved among most metazoans while HIF2\u03b1 appeared later (Graham and Presnell 2017). Some studies have suggested that the HIF pathway was lacking in the last common ancestor of animals and is not ubiquitous across metazoans (Mills et al., 2018; Graham and Barreto 2020). From the geological perspective, the HIF system requires the presence of O2, with HIF1\u03b1, HIF1\u03b2, PHD2, and VHL being the oldest components, HIF2\u03b1 and PHD3 were suggested to have appeared around 460 to 421 Ma ago when the atmospheric oxygen level was lower than the present, whereby PHD1 and HIF3\u03b1 are thought to have arisen most recently (about 312 Ma ago) with contemporary atmospheric oxygen levels (Taylor and McElwain 2010). FIH1 is missing in fruit flies and nematodes but not in intermediate beetles (Taylor and McElwain 2010).\nHere, we focus on the origin and distribution of the HIF/ PHD/FIH/VHL oxygen sensing pathway within metazoans from the perspective of oxygen in Earth history, addressing the two phases of the appearance of its essential components: First, the presence of HIF/PHD/FIH/VHL pathway related genes\u2014HIF\u03b1s, HIF\u03b2s, PHDs, FIH, and VHL\u2014across metazoan and nonmetazoan phyla, and the oxygen affinity of oxygen sensing enzymes (PHDs and FIH) were compared to terminal oxidases in mitochondria by the measure of substrate affinity for O2, Km app (O2)."

In July and October 2020, protein sequences from 566 complete eukaryotic genomes were downloaded from the NCBI Reference Sequence database (O\u2019Leary et al., 2016) with assembly levels ranging from contig to complete genome (Supplementary Table S2). The 566 genomes were classified into 15 phyla according to NCBI taxonomy. The proteins of the 566 eukaryotic genomes were blasted against the eukaryotic HIF related sequence database using DIAMOND v2.0.1.139 (Buchfink et al., 2015), to identify potential HIF related genes. DIAMOND blastp was executed with the options--very-sensitive, --evalue 0.0000001 and--id 25 to define the sensitivity as well as the e-value (10\u22127) and identity (25%) thresholds for the homology search and to determine the best corresponding HIF related genes in each genome. Duplicated sequences for the same identified HIF related gene were removed by only taking one of the best hits.\nPresence and absence patterns of the selected hits were used to demonstrate the evolution of HIF related genes within metazoans over the last 3.0 Ga of Earth\u2019s history (Figure 2). The reference phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 was taken from Telford et al., 2015 and the divergence time of the last common ancestor of each representative phylum on the phylogenetic tree was estimated from the free public database (Kumar et al., 2017) used for the estimation of time-scaled phylogenies (Dos Reis et al., 2015; Gold et al., 2015; Delsuc et al., 2018; Tedersoo et al., 2018). The presence of the genes in each phylum is based on the respective gene being present in at least one species within the indicated phylum and represented by filled colored circles, if the gene was not present in the respective phylum, the space was left blank. The time of the earliest eukaryote fossil record (Eme et al., 2014) is displayed in the time scale at the bottom in light brown and the earliest animal fossil record (Hoyal Cuthill and Han 2018) is indicated by a dark brown bar in the time scale.\nOxygen affinity of oxygen sensing enzymes and terminal oxidases\nKm app (O2) values of oxygen sensing enzymes (PHD and FIH) and terminal oxidases were collected from literature (Supplementary Tables S3, S4). Km is the Michaelis constant, which represents the concentration of substrate needed to achieve half of the maximum reaction speed (Vmax) of the enzyme (Northrop 1998). Km app (O2) represents the concentration of oxygen required to achieve half of the Vmax\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org03\nof the examined enzyme; the lower the Km the higher the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate."

This result is based on the genome of Salpingoeca rosetta, as this species deals as a model organism of a group of single-celled eukaryotes that are considered to be the closest relatives of animals (Carr et al., 2008; Booth and King 2022) (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, S. rosetta was included to analyze the presence or absence of the HIF-pathway with its components in an organism that\nmay give insight into oxygen sensing via hypoxia-inducible factors in simple premetazoan eukaryotes. It has been previously reported that choanoflagellates have PHD, but not HIF and VHL (Rytk\u00f6nen 2018). Ascomycetes also possess HIF homologs, the result of Ascomycota is based on nine fungi genomes (Supplementary Table S2). Our results support those of Rytk\u00f6nen et al. in that HIF\u03b1 and HIF\u03b2 subunits are not present in S. rosetta, only homologs of PHD1/3/4 as well as FIH and VHL were found. Ascomycota are the largest phylum of fungi predating metazoans, within which Ofd1\u2014the prolyl 4-hydroxylase-like 2-OG-Fe(II) dioxygenase\u2014mediates the degradation and accumulation of the N-terminal transcription factor (Sre1N) (Hughes and Espenshade 2008). Porifera is the sister group of all other animals (Simion et al., 2017) and has been shown to contain HIF1\u03b1, HIF1\u03b2, PHD1, PHD2, PHD4, FIH, and VHL based on the sponge species Amphimedon queenslandica (Supplementary Table S2). Trichoplax adhaerens which belongs to the phylum Placozoa is discussed as the last\nFIGURE 2 The evolution of the main oxygen sensing pathway across metazoans over the Earth\u2019s oxygen history. The oxygen curve describes the Earth\u2019s oxygen content during each geological time scale (Walker et al., 2018), the detailed information has been obtained from recent publications (Bekker et al., 2004; Lyons et al., 2014). More than 2500 million years (Ma) ago, the Earth oxygen content was almost at an anaerobic state (Catling and Zahnle 2020); during the Proterozoic period (2500\u2013542 Ma), despite the great oxidation event (GOE) that happened at the beginning of this period, the oxygen content was still very low with around 1% present atmospheric levels (PAL) (Allen et al., 2019); during the Phanerozoic period (541\u20130 Ma), the atmospheric oxygen content increased constantly to the modern level (Lenton et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2018). The phylogenetic tree shown in the figure is scaled to the timeframe at the bottomof the figure. It is connected to the presence-absence pattern (PAP) of oxygen sensing genes. The PAP shows the distribution of the 11 gene categories across 13 metazoan phyla (Chordata, Hemichordata, Echinodermata, Annelida, Mollusca, Brachiopoda, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Arthropoda, Priapulida, Cnidaria, Placozoa, and Porifera) and two non-metazoan phyla (Choanoflagellata and Ascomycota) that include 566 species (Supplementary Table S2). The oxygen sensing regulators (HIF1\u03b1, HIF2\u03b1, HIF3\u03b1, HIF1\u03b2, and HIF2\u03b2) at the left of the PAP are the substrates of the oxygen sensors (PHD1, PHD2, PHD3, PHD4, and FIH) in oxygen-dependent reactions before the ubiquitination (Ub) of the tumor suppressor gene (VHL). (HIF\u2014hypoxia-inducible factor; PHD\u2014HIF prolyl hydroxylases; FIH\u2014factor inhibiting HIF; VHL\u2014von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor).\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org04\ncommon ancestor of all animals (Schierwater and DeSalle 2018) and was previously shown to possess the key components of the oxygen sensing mechanism\u2014HIF\u03b1, PHD, and VHL (Loenarz et al., 2011). Our finding shows a more complete result as T. adhaerens not only contains HIF\u03b1 and PHD homologs but also HIF\u03b2, FIH, and VHL homologues. The main oxygen sensing pathway can thus be traced back to at least the last common ancestor of metazoans, which lived roughly 800 Ma ago, when the atmospheric oxygen content was around 1% PAL (Erwin et al., 2011) (Figure 2).\nThe hypoxia induced factor pathway is conserved and widely distributed across metazoans\nThe 13 metazoan phyla examined all possess HIF1\u03b1, HIF1\u03b2, PHD1, PHD4, FIH, and VHL. This shows that the core components of the main oxygen sensing pathway are relatively conserved and widespread across metazoans. Moreover, HIF1\u03b1 is more widely distributed across all phyla and therefore probably evolved earlier than HIF2\u03b1 and HIF3\u03b1 (Figure 2). HIF1\u03b2 is more widely distributed than HIF2\u03b2, whereas PHD1 and PHD4 may have arisen\nearlier than PHD2 and PHD3 as they are found in all phyla examined as shown in Figure 2. It was previously shown that HIF1\u03b1 is more conserved among metazoans and probably arose before HIF2\u03b1 (Graham and Presnell 2017), consistent with our findings. However, previous studies have shown that HIF homologs are ubiquitous across metazoans, with the exception of Porifera and Ctenophora, and HIF2\u03b1 only appears in vertebrates (Loenarz et al., 2011; Rytk\u00f6nen et al., 2011; Graham and Presnell 2017; Hammarlund et al., 2018; Rytk\u00f6nen 2018). Accordingly, it has been suggested that the HIF/PHD/FIH/ VHL oxygen sensing pathway might represent a recent lineage specific invention among recent animals (Hashimoto et al., 2016; Graham and Barreto 2019; Graham and Barreto 2020). The copepod Tigriopus californicus seems to have lost the HIF pathway but still tolerates nearly anoxic conditions for at least 24 h, the genes involved in cuticle reorganization and ion transport may act as the potential solution to low oxygen availability as a replacement to the HIF pathway (Graham and Barreto 2019). Ramazzottius varieornatus, one member of the most stress-tolerant tardigrade species, has lost HIF1\u03b1, PHD, and VHL selectively (Hashimoto et al., 2016). Three of the four orders of Copepoda were shown to have lost the use of the HIF pathway, but both barnacles and copepods have not fully\nFIGURE 3 The Km app(O2) values of terminal oxidases and oxygen sensing enzymes.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the Km app (O2) values of terminal oxidases, PHDs and FIH, which are 0.0034\u201333 \u03bcM, 11.54\u2013530 \u03bcM and 12\u2013270 \u03bcM, respectively. Low Km app (O2) values indicate higher oxygen affinity, this shows that the oxygen affinity of terminal oxidases is far higher than that of PHD and FIH."

            "text": "In previous studies, the characteristic domains of HIF, PHD, FIH, and VHL were used to identify HIF related homologs as the characteristic domains are usually the most conserved and representative part of one protein family. Here, complete HIF related protein sequences were used to find possible HIF pathway homologues from sequenced genomes. This identified HIF pathway homologues that were not detected in previous studies. We used Diamond (Buchfink et al., 2015) for searching, which is generally faster and often more accurate than the traditional Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; Altschul et al., 1990), which helped to identify previously missing HIF pathway genes.\nThe HIF/PHD/FIH/VHL pathway was present during the Cambrian explosion\nThe largest fungal phylum Ascomycota, the metazoan\u2019s closest sister lineage Choanoflagellata as well as the earliest invertebrate phyla Porifera and Placozoa originated in a low oxygen environment, when the oxygen level was roughly 1%\u2013 10% of the present atmospheric level. They are regarded as the low oxygen species group here. According to Figure 2, this group could have the evolved repression machinery - PHD, FIH, and VHL, followed by the first appearance of the HIF1\u03b1 and HIF1\u03b2 subunits and gene duplications leading to HIF2\u03b1, HIF3\u03b1, and HIF2\u03b2. The other invertebrate phyla (Cnidaria to Hemichordata in Figure 2) and the vertebrate phylum Chordata appeared before or after the Cambrian period, when the oxygen content increased to the around 10%\u2013100% PAL. Thus, we classify these phyla as the high oxygen group. The HIF oxygen sensing mechanism may\nhave been fully adapted across this group and is responsible for the adaptive transcriptional responses to hypoxia. In this view, the pathway originated in low oxygen environments and evolved vertically in different animal lineages as atmospheric oxygen content rose.\nGenes for enzymes of the HIF oxygen sensing pathway\u2014PHD1, PHD4, FIH, and VHL\u2014are distributed across all examined phyla (Figure 2), tracing their first appearance to lineages during the course of metazoan and non-metazoan phylum diversification. HIF1\u03b1 was the progenitor from which HIF2\u03b1 and HIF3\u03b1 arose, and HIF1\u03b2 may have emerged before HIF2\u03b2 as it is more widely distributed, giving rise to the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF1), which is composed of HIF1\u03b1 and HIF1\u03b2, and is the major regulator of oxygen homeostasis (Wang et al., 1995; Semenza 2007). HIF\u03b1 and HIF\u03b2 are only absent in the phylum of Choanoflagellata. As S. rosetta is capable of aerotaxis (movement in the direction of oxygen) this species might possess an oxygen sensing mechanism other than HIF because this process requires the ability to detect changes in oxygen levels (Kirkegaard et al., 2016). This alternative oxygen sensing mechanism might also play a role in hypoxia-related responses which obviate a need for retention of HIF\u03b1 and -\u03b2 subunits.\nPurifying selection is a dominant factor underlying functional diversification and structural conservation among HIF\u03b1 genes (Brihimi-Horn and Pouyss\u00e9gur 2009; Sch\u00f6del et al., 2013; Tarade et al., 2019). HIF1\u03b1 has a high affinity to VHL through the close contact between HIF1\u03b1 Met561 and VHL Phe91. It is furthermore bound in closer proximity to promoters compared with HIF2\u03b1. HIF1\u03b2 and HIF2\u03b2 have the same domain architectures and can dimerize with HIF-\u03b1 subunits, but HIF1\u03b2 is more conserved across animal lineages than HIF2\u03b2. These evolutionary changes accompanied the strict retention of HIF1\u03b1 and HIF1\u03b2 across animal lineages.\nPHD3 only appears in five of the 13 phyla analyzed but was present in choanoflagellates. Previous work reported that PHD3 may function as an ancient signaling protein due to its involvement in several cell signaling mechanisms (Place and Domann 2013), which enables large animals to sense and deliver oxygen for development and metabolism. Therefore, the retention of PHD3 in choanoflagellates might not reflect the oxygen sensing pathway but other functions instead.\nIt has been suggested that rudimentary HIF1\u03b1-dominant stemness control can function in such a way as to generate oxygen gradients within a tissue in the presence of 1% oxygen and thus maintain the inner tissue\u2019s hypoxic cell stemness, with HIF2\u03b1-driven pseudohypoxia maintaining stemness of cells in nearby well-vascularized and oxygenated tissue with more than 1%\u20133% oxygen (Hammarlund et al., 2018). Under pseudohypoxic conditions, cells can activate hypoxia-related metabolic pathways even though sufficient oxygen supply is\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org06\nprovided. Pseudohypoxia conditions can include the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor subunits and utilization of glycolysis under normal oxygen conditions in cancer cells (Masoud and Li 2015; Hayashi et al., 2019).\nDuring early animal evolution, refined HIF stemness control might have played an essential role in promoting the larger size of animals and in energy metabolism. Before the Cambrian, low oxygen levels were sufficient to meet the physiological requirements of the simple invertebrates, but after the Cambrian, higher oxygen levels would have interfered with the stemness of animals, which would implicate a role of HIF in the evolution of animal size at the Cambrian explosion. At the same time, collagen hydroxylation at proline residues would have led to more rigid invertebrate body structures and better fossilization properties (Towe 1970).\nThe functional ranges of both HIF1\u03b1 and HIF2\u03b1 (5%\u201324% PAL or 1%\u20135% O2) hydroxylation (Holmquist-Mengelbier et al., 2006) suggest that they are a relic from the time of O2 sensing during low O2 concentrations in the Cambrian (15%\u201320% PAL or 3%\u20134% O2), marking a role for the HIF pathway during the adaptation of larger animals to the rising atmospheric oxygen concentrations. Under low oxygen concentrations of around 1%, both HIF1\u03b1 and HIF2\u03b1 are stabilized with HIF1\u03b1 driving the hypoxia induced reactions which can create oxygen gradients in tissue and thus result in hypoxia and cell stemness within invertebrate tissue. HIF2\u03b1 may have gained a role for creating the pseudohypoxic phenotype in order to facilitate the activation of genes related with promoting stemness within vertebrate tissue, while HIF2\u03b1 maintained HIF2\u03b1-driven pseudohypoxia, promoting stemness even at oxygen levels of roughly 5% (Hammarlund et al., 2018). Clearly HIF dependent oxygen sensing was integral to the Cambrian explosion (541\u2013485 Ma) and likely facilitated an increase in animal diversity (Knoll and Carroll 1999).\nLow O2 affinity of hypoxia induced factor and high O2 affinity of terminal oxidases\nThe Km app (O2) values in Figure 3 show that the O2 affinity of O2 sensing enzymes is lower than that of terminal oxidases by one to two orders of magnitude. The O2 affinity of A1 type terminal oxidases in mitochondria is on the order of 10 \u03bcM, corresponding to 1% [v/v] O2 in air reflecting the environmental concentration of O2 at the time of mitochondrial origin (Zimorski et al., 2019) which is, in turn, very close to the O2 concentration in functioning mitochondria of human tissues because of the oxygen cascade from air to blood to capillaries (Martin et al., 2021). This affinity seems to have changed little during evolution. The situation is different with HIF however, as different animals respond to hypoxia at different levels. For\nexample, Caenorhabditis elegans prefers O2 levels around 7%, and responds to hypoxia only at about 1% O2 (Branicky and Schafer 2008), reflecting diversification of oxygen sensing physiology during metazoan evolution (Kaelin and Ratcliffe 2008; Hampton-Smith and Peet 2009).\nPHDs and FIH can target alternative substrates other than HIF, due to their involvement in both HIF and non-HIF related pathways. Their protein hydroxylation is neither unique nor ubiquitous. The substrates of PHDs and FIH can be sorted into three groups (Strowitzki et al., 2019) (Figure 3). Within the oxygen metabolizing enzymes, FIH has a relatively high oxygen affinity compared to the PHDs suggesting that FIH is more hypoxia-tolerant than the PHDs (Tarhonskaya et al., 2015). The Km app (O2) values of FIH are normally between 90 up to 270 \u03bcM (Koivunen et al., 2004; Hangasky et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2020) while that of PHDs are 30\u2013250 \u03bcM (Hirsil\u00e4 et al., 2003). One study also reported an outlier Km app (O2) value of PHD around 1700 \u03bcM, which is not considered here (Dao et al., 2009). PHD2 was identified as the main regulator of the normal development of growth plate chondrocytes in the avascular environment, as it can inactivate HIF1\u03b1 to avoid prolonged HIF1\u03b1-induced skeletal dysplasia (Stegen et al., 2019). Overexpressed HIF1\u03b1 can reprogram cellular metabolism from respiration to fermentation (Stegen et al., 2019). Appropriate control of PHD2 on HIF1\u03b1 activation is also important for collagen synthesis. For the comparison of the same oxygen sensing enzyme type from the same substrate group, it can be seen that larger sized vertebrates have higher oxygen affinity than smaller sized vertebrates and invertebrates on HIF-based substrates and collagen but not non-HIF substrates. This might reflect selection for a greater O2 demand for structural rigidity among larger vertebrates that are adapted to life above the soil line.\nWithin the terminal oxidases, the Km app (O2) values of other bacteria except for Alphaproteobacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes have also been added here. The mean Km app (O2) values of these seven of terminal oxidase subtypes, from high to low, are AOX (14.91 \u03bcM) > CIO (8.40 \u03bcM) > A1-bo3 (4.38 \u03bcM) > A1 (4.32 \u03bcM) > bd (4.18 \u03bcM) > A2 (2.83 \u03bcM) > C (1.62 \u03bcM) respectively (Degli Esposti et al., 2019). Cytochrome c oxidase was reported to exhibit a much smaller Km app (O2) than the mean physiological oxygen concentration compared to other oxygen utilizing enzymes in mammals, while the reaction rates of other oxygenconsuming enzymes could be limited by the physiological oxygen tensions commonly present in organs (Vanderkooi et al., 1991). The lower affinity for O2 of HIF dependent O2 sensing oxygenases relative to terminal oxidases suggests that the former have undergone evolutionary adaptations in response to changing O2 environments that reflect the physiological needs of the whole animal as opposed to its mitochondria, which are supplied via circulatory and\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org07\nrespiratory systems with roughly the same concentration of O2 as the mitochondria of the first unicellular eukaryotes more than 1.5 billion years ago."
