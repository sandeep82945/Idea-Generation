The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is:

"Nevertheless, they have a few limitations. First, these databases cover specific or limited CysPTM types. For example, many newly discovered types (e.g. s-itaconation [19] and s-succination [20]) have not been collected. Second, they include insufficient information. Generally, the information on identification techniques or sample origin is omitted, which is essential to estimate PTM data quality, compare the PTM profiles identified using different probes and guide further functional investigation [21]. Third, few visualization browsers are provided to show the CysPTM sites on protein sequences, or they cannot be used to estimate the potential effect of the modified sites on protein functions. In summary, a platform is missing that integrates data collection, annotations of modified sites and proteins and analytical tools to characterize the CysPTM sites, such as PTM crosstalks, sequence features and their effects on protein structures and functions."

This text suggests areas for future development in the field of CysPTM research, highlighting the need for more comprehensive databases that include newly discovered PTM types, provide detailed information on identification techniques and sample origins, and offer advanced visualization tools to explore the effects of PTMs on protein functions.
