    "abstractText": "While the cognitive enhancing effects of nicotine use have been well documented, it has also been shown to impair decision making. The goal of this study was to determine if exposure to nicotine vapor increases risky decision making. The study also aims to investigate possible long-term effects of nicotine vapor exposure on the expression of genes coding for cholinergic and dopaminergic receptors in brain. Thirty-two adult male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor or vehicle control, immediately followed by testing in the probability discounting task for 10 consecutive days. Fifty-four days after the 10-day vapor exposure, animals were sacrificed and expression of genes coding for the \u03b14 and \u03b22 cholinergic receptor subunits, and dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, were analyzed using RT-PCR. Exposure to nicotine vapor caused an immediate and transient increase in risky choice. Analyses of gene expression identified significant reductions in CHRNB2 and DRD1 in the nucleus accumbens core and CHRNB2 and DRD2 in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats previously exposed to nicotine vapor, relative to vehicle controls. Results provide data on the negative cognitive effects of nicotine vapor exposure and identify cholinergic and dopaminergic mechanisms that may affected with repeated use.",

            "text": "Successful commercial development of electronic cigarettes (commonly referred to as e-cigarettes) occurred in 2003. While they were originally developed as tool for smoking cessation, recreational use of e-cigarettes has increased at an alarming rate, particularly within the adolescent population [1]. Clinical studies investigating e-cigarette use have linked repeated nicotine vapor inhalation with negative health consequences that can differ from those produced from tobacco leaf smoke inhalation [2,3]. Preclinical studies have also begun to shed light on the toxic health effects of e-cigarettes, including the negative impact on the brain and behavior [4\u20136]. Research has shown that relative to tobacco leaf cigarettes, e-cigarettes expose users to distinct nicotine concentrations, chemical additives (e.g., salt, flavorings), and chemical reaction products (e.g., nicotyrine) that enhance nicotine\u2019s rewarding properties and promote a transition to tobacco leaf cigarette use in individuals with no history of smoking [7\u201310]. Cognitive and behavioral deficits have been well documented in tobacco leaf cigarette smokers [11\u201313]. For example, smokers have been shown to exhibit increases in impulsive and risky choice compared to non-users [14\u201316]. Research is now beginning to identify similar decision-making deficits in e-cigarette users [17\u201319]. While clinical studies identify a link between nicotine exposure and poor decision making, they cannot address whether\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1231. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23031231 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1231 2 of 14\nthis cognitive deficit is pre-existing to nicotine use or occurs as a result of use. Animal studies examining changes in impulsive or risky choice following nicotine injections have reported mixed results. Several rodent studies have shown acute increases in impulsive choice following nicotine injections [20,21], while others have shown no effects [22,23] or decreases [24] in either impulsive or risky choice. Notably, when increases in impulsive choice were assessed after 65 days of repeated exposure to 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg nicotine injections, increases in impulsive choice were seen up to 30 days after exposure [20]. It should be noted that nicotine injections in rats have been shown to increase perseverative behavioral responding in cost-benefit decision making tasks [22], an effect that could be contributing to the inconsistent findings reported in the literature. It was only recently that a study from our laboratory demonstrated that nicotine vapor inhalation causes short-term increases in impulsive choice, in rats [4]. A number of corticolimbic structures have been implicated in cost-benefit decision making, including the prefrontal cortex and striatum [25,26]. Experimental research on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cost-benefit decision making in these regions has predominantly focused on the dopaminergic system [27,28], shedding light on how psychostimulant drugs of abuse drive poor decision making through modulation of dopaminergic signaling [29,30]. Investigation into the role of cholinergic signaling in decision making is less common, despite increased impulsivity and riskiness observed in smokers [16,31]. One animal study has linked low \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex with decreased impulsive choice and increased risky choice, in na\u00efve rats [32]. A more recent study found that complete knockout of \u03b22 nicotinic receptor subunits in mice also resulted in increased risk behaviors [33]. These findings, linking low \u03b14\u03b22 levels with increased riskiness in na\u00efve rodents is somewhat surprising, considering that nicotine exposure causes immediate upregulation of \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors in brain [34,35]. Additional work is needed to better characterize the cholinergic mechanisms driving decision making. Nicotine-induced increases in risk-taking may promote ongoing substance use despite the possibility of negative consequences. The current rise in e-cigarette use highlights the need for additional preclinical research on the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on cost-benefit decision making and the mechanisms that underlie it. While nicotine vapor induced increases in impulsive choice have been demonstrated, the ability of nicotine vapor exposure to shift risky choice during uncertainty is not known. Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate the role of the cholinergic system in risky decision making by examining the ability of nicotine vapor exposure to shift choice preference in the probabilistic discounting task in adult male rats. Furthermore, to elucidate how nicotine use may affect cholinergic mechanisms in regions implicated in risky choice, the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on corticolimbic \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor subunit gene expression was also assessed."

The ability of stress to induce increases in riskiness has been well documented [see reference [36] for review] and relative to self-administration, passive exposure to drugs has indeed been shown increase stress hormone levels in rodents [37].

These finding suggest that pre-exposure to v hicle vapor when using pa sive exposure procedures should be considered for future stu ies investigating the effects of nicotine vapor on decision making. The probability discounting task was used to assess risky decision making. Exposure to 24 mg/mL of nicotine vapor was found to cause modest, short-term increases in risky choice. When comparing choice preference during the 2nd block (when the large reward had a 50/50 chance of being delivered), rats exposed to nicotine vapor showed a significant\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1231 6 of 14\nincrease in risky choice, on 5 of the 10 nicotine vapor exposure days (Figure 2A). On the 3 days immediately following repeated nicotine vapor exposure, no differences in risky choice were observed between the nicotine exposed rats and controls. Additionally, a test of behavioral perseveration immediately following 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor exposure showed that increases in risky choice were not due to reduced behavioral flexibility. The ability of nicotine vapor exposure to cause immediate, short-term increase in risky choice is similar to the nicotine vapor-induced increase in impulsive choice previously reported by our laboratory [4]. While group differences during the 50/50 block only reached statistical significance on half of the nicotine vapor exposure days, a trend for increased riskiness appears on all exposure days. A lack of effect observed on exposure days 5\u20138 appears to be driven by a slight increase in risky choice in the vehicle control group. While the cause for this slight shift in the control group may be due to day-to-day variability in the task, it should be noted that the behavioral effects of repeated exposure to vehicle vapor alone remain unclear. Increases in risky choice following exposure to vehicle vapor were observed following initial exposure, and it remains possible that these effects also manifest later with repeated exposure to vehicle vapor. On the days where significant group differences were seen, it remains possible that longer exposure to nicotine vapor may result in a more potent and/or persistent increases in risky choice, as previous studies using nicotine injections observed long-lasting effects of nicotine on impulsive choice, after 65 days of nicotine treatment. Additional studies with larger treatment groups and extended nicotine vapor exposure will be needed to further characterize the nature of nicotine\u2019s subtle effects on risky and impulsive choice. Previous research in our laboratory has demonstrated that exposure to 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor, using the described exposure parameters in the current study, results in plasma cotinine levels (a metabolite of nicotine) that are within the range of those commonly seen in daily smokers and e-cigarette users, as well as following injections of nicotine in rodents (100\u2013300 ng/mL) [4,38\u201340]. Studies from other laboratories examining cotinine levels following exposure to lower concentrations of nicotine vapor in mice (6 mg/mL) and rats (5 mg/mL) have observed lower cotinine levels in the range of 20 to 70 ng/mL when using free base nicotine liquids, as we did in our study [10,41]. Importantly, these studies also identify other variables requiring consideration when determining vapor exposure parameters. In the mouse study, lower cotinine levels following exposure to the vapor of a freebase nicotine solution versus the vapor of a salt nicotine solution, were observed [10]. In the rat study, lower cotinine levels were seen in females versus males exposed to the same concentration of nicotine vapor. While cotinine levels following nicotine vapor exposure have been well studied, investigations also now showing that rats will self-administer various concentrations of nicotine vapor (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 50 mg/mL) in a dose dependent manner [42], suggesting that our concentration of nicotine vapor is reinforcing. Finally, a recent study in our laboratory identified significant increases in not only cotinine levels, but also physical withdrawal signs, anxiety-like behavior, and intracranial self-stimulation thresholds, following precipitated withdrawal from repeated nicotine vapor exposure using the same parameters described in this study [see reference [43] for preprint describing this work]. Together these findings substantiate our exposure procedures and delivery system as an effective model of human e-cigarette use. The modest and transient shifts in impulsive and risky choice observed following nicotine vapor exposure may explain why the effects of nicotine on cost-benefit decision making have not always been reported in pre-clinical studies. A number of procedural and biological factors must be considered by future studies investigating the effects of nicotine vapor on decision making, and animal behavior in general. For example, subsequent research investigating the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on behavior should consider analysis of both plasma cotinine and nicotine levels during testing. Extended daily exposure to nicotine vapor should also be considered, as it may yield more robust nicotine dependence and intake, similar to that seen with extended access to nicotine intravenous self-administration [44]. Differences in nicotine withdrawal following repeated nicotine\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1231 7 of 14\ninjections have been observed when comparing males and females, adolescents and adults, and various strains in rodents [45\u201347]. Therefore, it remains possible that the observed modest effect of nicotine vapor on risky choice was specific to the adult male Sprague Dawley rats used in this study. Further investigation on how factors such as sex, age, and species strain impact the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on decision making is necessary. In addition to the effects of nicotine vapor on risky choice, our study examined CHRNA4, CHRNB2, DRD1, and DRD2 expression in the corticolimbic structures of rats with and without a history of repeated nicotine vapor exposure. The prefrontal cortex and striatum were investigated, as these regions have been heavily implicated in costbenefit decision making [25,26,28]. While the literature on the effects of e-cigarette use on cholinergic mechanisms is very limited, human studies have recently begun to identify changes in the expression of non-cholinergic genes [48,49] and the function of \u03b22 cholinergic receptors [50] of e-cigarette users. Previous pre-clinical studies examining nicotinic receptor protein levels have focused extensively on changes observed soon after exposure to nicotine injections or minipumps (within 24 h), and repeatedly show that this exposure causes upregulation of \u03b14\u03b22 receptors in mesolimbic and basal forebrain cholinergic systems [51], an effect that has been reported to persist for about 1 month after exposure [52,53]. Preclinical research on the effects of nicotine vapor on cholinergic receptors is also limited, but has shown that exposure to 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor, as well as flavorants used in nicotine solutions, can affect nicotinic receptors levels and function in the striatum [54]. Immediate effects of nicotine injections on CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 expression has been limited compared to receptor analysis, with some studies showing no changes in nicotinic receptor subunit gene expression [55,56] and others showing immediate increases in both CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 expression, similar to that seen with \u03b14\u03b22 receptors [57,58]. To our knowledge, there is no pre-clinical work on the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on cholinergic receptor gene expression. In this experiment, we examined nicotinic and dopaminergic receptor gene expression 54 days after repeated nicotine vapor exposure. Our findings revealed reduced expression of CHRNB2 and DRD1 in the nucleus accumbens core, as well as reduced expression of CHRNB2 and DRD2 in the medial prefrontal cortex, of animals previously exposed to nicotine relative to those exposed to vehicle vapor (Figure 3). Dopamine activity in corticolimbic structures has been implicated in risky choice [59,60]. For example, one study by Simon et al. (2011) demonstrated that DRD1 but not DRD2 expression in the nucleus accumbens predicted choice in a punishment risk discounting task, while DRD2 but not DRD1 expression in the medial prefrontal cortex predicted choice in this same task. Interestingly, in our analysis we found that relative to controls, animals previously exposed to nicotine vapor exhibited reductions in DRD1, but not DRD2, in the nucleus accumbens core and reductions in DRD2, but not DRD1, in the medial prefrontal cortex. Only a handful of studies have examined the long-term effects of nicotine exposure on nicotinic subunit gene expression and findings have been mixed, with one study reporting no changes in gene expression 180 days after adolescent exposure [61] and another showing reduced expression of CHRNB2 in the prefrontal cortex 4 months after postnatal exposure [62]. One other study identified reduced expression of CHRNB2 in prefrontal cortex following nicotine exposure in male rats [63]; however, the time between nicotine exposure and tissue collection was unclear. Interestingly, the latter study also presented sex differences in nicotinic receptor gene expression, with females showing reduced expression of both CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 in the prefrontal cortex. Future studies investigating the long-term effects of nicotine on both cholinergic genes and receptor levels are challenging, however, as they must consider other factors that can influence gene expression in the treatment group, such as nicotine withdrawal. Careful measurements of nicotine withdrawal are needed to determine if it is a moderating variable in any relationships that may arise between decision making and gene expression. Short-term increases in nicotinic receptor gene expression, followed by long-term decreases in the expression of these same genes, may suggest distinct, time-dependent changes in cholinergic mechanisms during abstinence.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1231 8 of 14\nCHRNA4 and CHRNB2 are also highly implicated in nicotine reinforcement, as demonstrated with pre-clinical self-administration studies [64,65]. Therefore, time-dependent changes in cholinergic gene expression could underlie unique behavioral and cognitive processes driving relapse that occurs days, versus months after last nicotine use. Overall, these findings highlight the need for additional work on how nicotine vapor exposure affects cholinergic mechanisms and how these changes impact decision making."

The experiment began with shaping procedures for the probability discounting task (see reference [4] for detailed description of shaping procedures). Shaping procedures were conducted until a criterion of 30 responses in 1 h was met by all rats, for each procedure. After shaping was complete, all rats were trained once daily in the probability discounting task, until a stable probabilistic discounting curve was achieved in the task (see Section 4.7 for description of stability criteria). All rats were then habituated once daily to passive vapor exposure procedures using nicotine vehicle (50% propylene glycol/50% vegetable glycerin), with each exposure session followed immediately by training in the probability discounting task. After 6 habituation days, rats were divided into two groups (24 mg of free base nicotine in 1 mL of vehicle or vehicle control, n = 16/group) and exposed to vapor for ten consecutive days. To examine the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on risky choice, all animals were tested in the probability discounting task immediately following vehicle or 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor exposure sessions. Choice preference without nicotine vapor exposure was assessed for three consecutive days after the last vapor exposure session. To investigate possible behavioral perseveration effects of 24 mg/mL nicotine vapor all rats tested in the probability discounting task were trained in a perseveration task until stable and the effects of nicotine vapor exposure were assessed. Ten days after the perseveration test, and 54 days after chronic nicotine vapor exposure, a subset of rats used for behavioral testing (N = 24, n = 12/group) were sacrificed and brains were collected. Brain tissue from the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex were analyzed for nicotinic and dopaminergic receptor gene expression using RT-PCR (see Figure 4A for schematic of experimental timeline)."

            "text": "Findings from this study provide much need data on the effects of nicotine vapor exposure on risky decision making and the mechanisms that drive choice. Behavioral data demonstrates modest and transient effects of nicotine vapor on decision making, an effect that is supported by other studies investigating cost-benefit decision making [4,21]. Research demonstrating the negative behavioral and cognitive effects of nicotine vapor exposure is imperative, as misconceptions about the safety of nicotine vapor has been identified as a factor driving recent increases in recreational e-cigarette use [68]. Our analysis also serves to extend the current understanding of nicotine\u2019s possible effects on mechanisms underlying decision making. The observed reduction in nicotinic receptor subunit gene expression observed in subjects with a history of vapor exposure, versus those without, may be a distinct long-term mechanism driving relapse in e-cigarette users.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, I.A.M.; methodology, I.A.M. and N.W.S.; software, I.A.M. and A.E.L.; validation, I.A.M., P.G., K.P.U.; formal analysis, I.A.M., P.G., G.A.F.; investigation, P.G. and L.M.-A.; resources, I.A.M.; data curation, I.A.M., P.G. and L.M.-A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, I.A.M. and P.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.G., A.E.L., L.M.-A., K.P.U., G.A.F. and N.W.S.; visualization, I.A.M.; supervision, I.A.M. and P.G.; project administration, I.A.M.; funding acquisition, I.A.M.
