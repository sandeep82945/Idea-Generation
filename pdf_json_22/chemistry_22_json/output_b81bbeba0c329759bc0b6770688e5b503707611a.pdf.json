View Article Online large conjugated systems, many hydroxycinnamic acids are expected to have high free radical scavenging activities based on the H-atom transfer from the \u2013OH group.5,6 In addition, the secondary antioxidant activity via transition metal ion chelation of hydroxycinnamic acids has also been well reported.9,10 Normally, these acids contain \u2013COOH and \u2013OH groups and sometimes have the ester or ether groups that allow the complexation with metal ions.9,29\u201331\nRosmarinic acid (RA, Fig. 1) is one of the hydroxycinnamic acids, and was initially isolated and puried from the extract of rosemary, a member of mint family (Lamiaceae), in 1958 by Scarpati and Oriente.32,33 With an acid dissociation constant Ka of 10 3,57 mono-anionic RA is the main form of RA existing in the physiological environment (pH ranging from 7.35 to 7.45).34 Rosmarinic acid also shows a large number of biological and pharmacological activities including anti-myotoxic,35 antioxidant,36\u201340 anti-inammatory,26 antimicrobial,41 anti-mutagenic,42 anti-cancer,43 antibacterial,44 and antiviral27 functions. Moreover, RA is able to interact with several high-molecular weight compounds such as proteins and lipids.40,45\u201347 In a research study by Xin Peng et al., the interaction of RA with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated by combining experiments and molecular docking.46 The experimental results indicate that BSA has a high affinity towards RA with a binding constant of 4.18 104 mol L 1. Meanwhile, the docking results show that RA is bound to the site-1 (subdomain IIA) of BSA, at Leu-209, Val-239, Leu-196, Trp-212, Ala-289 and Leu-236 amino acids.\nAmong the biological activities of RA, its antioxidant activity has been investigated via both experimental and computational approaches.36\u201340 For example, Fadel et al. experimentally studied the antioxidant activity of RA in preventing lipid peroxidation.36 The authors measured the peroxidation of liposomes of 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) at 37 C with a hydrophilic radical generator, namely, 2,20-azo-bis(2amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH). The results indicate that DLPC is fully peroxidized at a RA concentration of 0.25 mM, whereas the peroxidation level is lower than 20% for a RA concentration greater than 2 mM aer 60 min. Popov et al. conducted a comparative study on the radical scavenging properties of RA in a system of 2,20-azo-bis(2-methylpropionamidin) dihydrochloride/luminol and hemoglobin/hydrogen peroxide/ luminol to determine its protective potential in preventing peroxidation of linoleic acid.40 The antioxidant activity of RA in this\n1500 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 1499\u20131514\nstudied system is remarkably higher than that of trolox, ascorbic acid and taxifolin. Additionally, Cao et al. evaluated the antioxidant activity of RA via a DFT approach at the B3LYP/6-311G(d) level of theory.37 Their results indicated the BDE values of O7\u2013 H, O8\u2013H, and O4\u2013H bonds (see Fig. 1) are 325.7, 314.9, and 316.5 kJ mol 1, respectively. Furthermore, the radical resulting from the H-abstraction of O7\u2013H is more stable than that of the remaining O\u2013H bonds. Besides, S\u0301wis\u0142ocka et al. combined DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory and experiments to investigate the structures and antioxidant properties of rosmarinic acid and its alkali metal salts.48 In this work, the antioxidant activities of RA and its lithium, sodium, and potassium salts were determined by their ability to scavenge 1,1- diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPHc) radicals and to reduce the ferric complex in the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The results indicate that all of these salts have better antioxidant properties than that of initial RA. Moreover, the IC50 values in the DPPHc assay are very similar for all the studied salts, whereas sodium rosmarinate shows the highest antioxidant activity in the FRAP assay. There has been scare study on the prooxidant activities of rosmarinic acid in the literature. Mun\u0303ozMun\u0303oz et al. experimentally investigated the intrinsic pro-oxidant activity of RA via generation of H2O2 and free radicals by the action of peroxidase in competition with its antioxidant properties based on consumption of H2O2 and free radicals.49 In balancing between the pro-oxidant and antioxidant activities, the authors concluded that RA can be considered as a net antioxidant.\nAlthough there are some experimental and computational works dedicated for the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of rosmarinic acid, systematic study of its chemical kinetics in free radical scavenging mechanisms is still lacking, and hence, further detailed studies are needed. Furthermore, the secondary antioxidant properties based on the transition metal chelating ability, and the pro-oxidant activity based on redox processes that may initiate Fenton-like reactions yielding reactive HOc radicals, have not been reported in the literature yet.\nThus, the main goal of this study is to evaluate the free radical scavenging activities of rosmarinic acid (RA) towards the ROOc radical family including HOOc and CH3OOc in aqueous and pentyl ethanoate (PEA) phases. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to optimize the structures and to calculate vibrational frequencies for different forms of RA including neutral, mono-anion, radicals, and metal complexes. The intrinsic thermochemical parameters including bond dissociation energy (BDE), proton affinity (PA) and ionization potential (IP) were rst calculated. The standard enthalpies (DrH\n0) and Gibbs free energies (DrG\n0) of reactions between RA and HOOc/ CH3OOc at potential positions were estimated and the kinetics of these reactions were also computed using the conventional transition state theory (TST) and quantum mechanics-based tests for the overall free radical scavenging activity (QM-ORSA) method. In addition, the secondary antioxidant properties of RA based on the chelation towards Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions to prevent the Harber\u2013Weiss reaction50\u201352 forming harmful radicals were investigated.

The hybrid meta exchange\u2013correlation GGA M05-2X functional was recommended for the thermodynamic and kinetic calculation by their developers54 and has widely been used in the kinetics of free radical scavenging reactions.4,55 The structures of [Fe(H2O)6] 2+ and [Fe(H2O)6] 3+ were respectively employed as ferrous and ferric ion models in the aqueous phase, as recommended by several previous research studies.9,31,56\u201358 In these models, the Fe ion interacted with six water molecules via the Fe\u2013O bonds in an octahedral fashion with quintet spin for Fe(II) complexes and sextet one for Fe(III) complexes. Four main direct antioxidant mechanisms of RA including formal hydrogen transfer (FHT), proton loss (PL), single electron transfer (SET) and radical adduct formation (RAF) were evaluated.\nFirst, the intrinsic thermochemical parameters including bond dissociation energies (BDE), proton affinities, and adiabatic ionization potentials (IP) characterizing respectively for FHT, PL, and SET mechanisms were calculated using the following equations:\nBDE (R\u2013H) \u00bc H(Rc) + H(Hc) H(R\u2013H); (1)\nPA \u00bc H(R ) + H(H+) H(RHc+); (2)\nIP \u00bc H(RHc+) + H(e ) H(R\u2013H); (3)\nwhereH is the enthalpy of each species at 298.15 K and 1M. The experimentally enthalpy values of proton (H+) and electron (e ) in the gas phase were 1.4811 and 0.7519 kcal mol 1, respectively.59 In water, H(H+) and H(e ) were calculated based on the binding of a proton and an electron to water molecules (H2O) to form H3O + and H2O , respectively; this method was recommended by several previous works.60\u201362 In this framework, H(H+) and H(e ) at the M05-2X/6-311++G(2df,2p) level of theory in the aqueous phase were dened as 251.4 and 15.4 kcal mol 1, respectively, whereas the corresponding values in PEA are 240.5 and 8.3 kcal mol 1.\nThe peroxyl radicals including HOOc and CH3OOc were chosen in order to evaluate the inuence of free radicals' nature on the primary antioxidant activities of RA. A large number of works reported in the literature have recommended the use of the peroxyl radicals (ROOc) as major reaction partners for evaluating the relative scavenging activity of different compounds.4,63\u201365 These radicals have not\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

An excess amounts of HOOc in a physiological environment need to be removed to retard oxidative stress.66 HOOc and CH3OOc were therefore chosen to evaluate the inuence of free radicals' nature on the primary antioxidant activities of RA.\nThe standard Gibbs free energies of reaction (DrG 0) with free radicals, HOOc as an example, were calculated using equations (eqn (5), (7), (9) and (11)) for four mechanisms including FHT, PL, RAF and SET as follows:\n- FHT: R\u2013H + HOOc / Rc + HOOH; (4)\nDrG 0 FHT \u00bc [G(Rc) + G(HOOH)] [G(R\u2013H) + G(HOOc)]; (5)\n- PL: R\u2013H + HOOc / R + HOOH+c; (6)\nDrG 0 PL \u00bc [G(R ) + G(HOOH+c)] [G(R\u2013H) + G(HOOc)]; (7)\n- RAF: R\u2013H + HOOc / [RH\u2013OOH]c; (8)\nDrG 0 RAF \u00bc G([RH\u2013OOH]c) [G(R\u2013H) + G(HOOc)]; (9)\n- SET: R\u2013H + HOOc / R\u2013H+c + HOO ; (10)\nDrG 0 SET \u00bc [G(R\u2013H+c) + G(HOO )] [G(R\u2013H) + G(HOOc)]; (11)\nThe energy values for the CH3OOc radical scavenging reactions were similarly determined.\nThe rate constants (k) of three reactions FHT, RAF and SET, which may be in concurrence were calculated via the conventional transition state theory (TST) approach68,69 as follows:4\nk \u00bc sk kBT h e DG s=RT (12)\nwhere s is the reaction symmetry number or the reaction path degeneracy; k is the transmission coefficient attributing for quantum tunneling effects by employing the Eckart barrier;70 kB, h and R are the Boltzmann, Planck and molar gas constant, respectively; T is the temperature of the system; and DGs is the Gibbs free energy of activation.

The reactions between the complexes of Fe(III) and two reducing agents occur as follows (reactions (23) and (24)):\n[Fe(III)L(H2O)6 n] x+3 + (O2c\n) / [Fe(II)L(H2O)6 n] x+2 + O2; (23)\n[Fe(III)L(H2O)6 n] x+3 + (Asc ) /\n[Fe(II)L(H2O)6 n] x+2 + Ascc; (24)\nThe corresponding redox reactions of aqueous complexes occur as follows (reactions (25) and (26)):\n[Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ + (O2c\n) / [Fe(II)(H2O)6] 2+ + O2; (25)\n[Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ + (Asc ) / [Fe(II)(H2O)6] 2+ + Ascc; (26)\nThe standard reaction enthalpies (DrH 0) and Gibbs free energies (DrG 0) of the reactions (23) and (24) were also determined by the difference in the total enthalpies (H) and Gibbs free energy (G), respectively, between the products and the reactants as follows (eqn (27)\u2013(30)):\nFor superoxide anion radical (O2c ):\nDrH 0 \u00bc H([Fe(II)L(H2O)6 n]x+2) + H(O2)\nH([Fe(III)L(H2O)6 n]x+3) H(O2c ); (27)\nDrG 0 \u00bc G([Fe(II)L(H2O)6 n]x+2) + G(O2)\nG([Fe(III)L(H2O)6 n]x+3) G(O2c ); (28)\nFor ascorbate anion (Asc ):\nDrH 0 \u00bc H([Fe(II)L(H2O)6 n]x+2) + H(Ascc)\nH([Fe(III)L(H2O)6 n]x+3) H(Asc ); (29)\nDrG 0 \u00bc G([Fe(II)L(H2O)6 n]x+2) + G(Ascc)\nG([Fe(III)L(H2O)6 n]x+3) G(Asc ); (30)\nThe energy values for the redox reactions of aqueous complexes were similarly determined.\nSEAGrid (http:www.seagrid.org)84\u201387 is acknowledged for computational resources and services for the selected results used in this publication.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "Direct antioxidant potential: intrinsic thermochemical properties\nOptimized structures of rosmarinic acid in neutral and monoanionic forms in the water phase at 298.15 K calculated at the M05-2X/6-311++G(2df,2p) level of theory are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI le\u2020). An intrinsic reactivity-based strategy, which only focuses on the chemical nature of the studied compound itself, is a helpful approach to quickly screen potential antioxidants. The intrinsic thermochemical parameters including BDE, PA, and IP values were rst calculated to determine the antioxidant potential of RA via three mechanisms FHT, PL (Fig. 2), and SET (Fig. S2, ESI le\u2020), respectively.\nIt can be seen in Fig. 2 that the phenolic O\u2013H bonds (i.e. O3\u2013 H, O4\u2013H, O7\u2013H, and O8\u2013H) have lower BDE values ranging from 83.3 to 85.8 kcal mol 1 than that of other bonds from 90.2 to 115.4 kcal mol 1. Therefore, the FHT reactions on the RA molecule may probably involve O\u2013H sites. The two weakest O\u2013H bonds are found at the O3\u2013H (83.3 kcal mol 1) and O4\u2013H (84.9 kcal mol 1) sites of the A ring (Fig. 1). These values are higher than the BDEs of trolox and ascorbic acid calculated at the same level of theory, 79.3 and 78.6 kcal mol 1, respectively. When compared with several other antioxidants in previous studies obtained by the same M05-2X method, the BDE value at the O3\u2013H of RA is lower than that in water of 2-(sec-butyl)-7,8dimethoxybenzo[de]imidazo[4,5,1-ij][1,6]-naphthyridin-10(9H)one (84.9 kcal mol 1),61 xanthyletin (87.1 kcal mol 1),62 trans-pcoumaric acid (85.0 kcal mol 1)6 and protocatechuic acid (83.9 kcal mol 1).88 Furthermore, the hydrogen dissociation in the PEA solvent is slightly more favorable than that in water with a lower BDE value, for example, a BDE (O3\u2013H) of 80.4 kcal mol 1 as compared to 83.3 kcal mol 1 in water. This value is also slightly higher than those of trolox and ascorbic acid in the same medium.\nThe PA values characterize the deprotonation process of molecules involved in the rst step of SPL-ET or SPL-HAT two-\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nstep mechanisms.1 The second step of SPL-ET mechanism is related to the electron transfer from the deprotonated antioxidant to the free radical, whereas the second transferred species in SPL-HAT is a hydrogen atom. Thus, the PA parameter allows characterizing the preponderance of these mechanisms. The lower the PA value, the higher the deprotonation potential of molecules. The PA values of different C\u2013H and O\u2013H bonds present in Fig. 2 vary from 23.3 to 76.8 kcal mol 1. The PA values of O\u2013H bonds (from 23.3 to 37.9 kcal mol 1) are generally lower than the ones of C\u2013H (from 53.5 to 76.8 kcal mol 1), except a quite low value of the C9\u2013H bond (30.5 kcal mol 1). Furthermore, the PA value observed at the C9\u2013H bond (30.5 kcal mol 1) is quite lower than that of C20\u2013H (69.9 kcal mol 1) and C21\u2013H (76.8 kcal mol 1). The lower PA value of the C9\u2013H bond is due to the cleavage of the C10\u2013O1 bond resulting from the proton dissociation at the C9\u2013H position (Fig. S2, ESI le\u2020). In addition, it is expected that a non-polar solvent like PEA is not favorable for transition of a charged particle like a proton. In fact, PA (C3\u2013 H) is equal to 55.9 kcal mol 1 that is remarkably higher than that in water (i.e. 34.2 kcal mol 1). Thus, the rst step of SPL-ET or SPL-HAT mechanisms is expected to occur at the O2\u2013H or C9\u2013H of the RA molecule. The relatively low PA value at O2\u2013H of the COOH group (23.3 kcal mol 1) probably indicates the presence of the mono-anionic form generated from the deprotonation at this position in water. This PA value is quite lower than that of piperidine[3,2-b]demethyl(oxy)aaptamine (60.2 kcal mol 1),61 pandanusin A (54.6 kcal mol 1), and 5- hydroxynoracronycin (36.5 kcal mol 1)62 (obtained at the M052X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory).\nThe adiabatic IP value is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a studied compound. Thus, the lower IP value represents the easier electron transferring ability and the higher antioxidant activity via the SET mechanism. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI le\u2020), the IP value in water of RA being 121.2 kcal mol 1 is lower than that of trolox (128.8 kcal mol 1), but higher than that of ascorbic acid (108.5 kcal mol 1). It is noteworthy that the PEA solvent is also unfavorable to the transfer of an electron particle from RA to free radical with IP in PEA (138.5 kcal mol 1) higher than that in water (121.2 kcal mol 1). In addition, RA presents an IP value in PEA higher than that of trolox (122.1 kcal mol 1) but lower than that of ascorbic acid (148.7 kcal mol 1).\nKinetics of scavenging reactions towards HOOc/CH3OOc radicals\nEvaluating the antioxidant activities based on the thermochemical strategy allows considering the inuence of the free radical nature by predicting reaction enthalpies (DrH\n0) and standard Gibbs free energies (DrG\n0) at 298.15 K. As discussed above, the RA mainly exists in a physiological environment under the mono-anionic form, RA . Thus, in this section, we evaluate the standard Gibbs free energies of the FHT, PL, RAF and SET reactions of the RA towards HOOc and CH3OOc radicals as recommended by several previous studies1,4 (Table 1).\nThe DrG 0 values of the FHT reaction between RA towards HOOc and CH3OOc at the phenolic O\u2013H positions are all\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 1499\u20131514 | 1503\nTable 1 Standard Gibbs free energies (DrG 0, kcal mol 1) at 298.15 K of the FHT, PL, RAF and SET reactions for the rosmarinate mono-anion (RA ) towards HOOc and CH3OOc radicals in water at 298.15 K at the M05-2X/6-311++G(2df,2p) level of theory.

The most favorable reactions in water are expected at the O3\u2013H site with the DrG 0 value being 5.0 and 3.9 kcal mol 1 for the reaction towards HOOc and CH3OOc radicals, respectively. Moreover, DrG\n0 values of these reactions are less negative than that of trolox and ascorbic acid being 8.7 and 9.4 kcal mol 1 for the reactions with HOOc, and 7.6 and 8.3 kcal mol 1 for the ones with CH3OOc, respectively. Besides, the lowest DrG\n0 value of FHT between RA and HOOc is very close to those obtained by the DFT/M05-2X method for piperidine[3,2-b]demethyl(oxy)aaptamine ( 5.0 kcal mol 1),61 pandanusin ( 5.0 kcal mol 1), citrusinine-I ( 4.9 kcal mol 1),62 and 5-hydroxynoracronycin ( 4.6 kcal mol 1)62 and remarkably lower than those of 9- amino-2-ethoxy-8-methoxy-3H-benzo[de][1,6]naphthyridine-3one (7.1 kcal mol 1)61 and tryptamine ( 3.8 kcal mol 1).78 In contrast, the reactions occurring at the C\u2013H positions are all unfavorable with positive DrG\n0 values ranging from 1.2 to 25.6 kcal mol 1 for the HOOc radical and from 2.2 to 26.7 kcal mol 1 for the CH3OOc one. Furthermore, the FHT process occurs in the PEA solvent more favorably than in the aqueous phase. In fact, DrG\n0 values in PEA of the reactions with HOOc obtained at O3\u2013H and O7\u2013H are 5.2 and 3.4 kcal mol 1, which are slightly lower than those in water (i.e. 5.0 and 2.5 kcal mol 1, respectively).\nRegarding the PL mechanism, it is observed that all the reactions towards both the radicals show large positive DrG 0 values. The lowest DrG 0 value of PL reactions was found at the C9\u2013H bond with the values in water as 44.4 and 48.4 kcal mol 1 for HOOc and CH3OOc radicals, respectively. In addition, the DrG\n0 values of these reactions are higher than those of trolox (i.e. 40.7 kcal mol 1 for HOOc and 44.7 kcal mol 1 for CH3OOc) and ascorbic acid (i.e. 36.4 kcal mol 1 for HOOc and 40.3 kcal mol 1 for CH3OOc). As mentioned above, the PEA medium largely increases the DrG\n0 value of the PL process. For example, the DrG\n0 values obtained in PEA at O7\u2013H (103.6 and 88.8 kcal mol 1) is higher than that in water (49.5 and 53.5 kcal mol 1 for HOOc and CH3OOc, respectively).\n1504 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 1499\u20131514\nThe RAF reactions of RA were examined at the C20]C21 double bond. Similar to the PL reactions, the DrG\n0 values of the RAF reactions are all positive. It is noteworthy that the reactions of HOOc and CH3OOc radicals with RA\nat the C20 position are more favorable than those at the C21 one. Indeed, the DrG 0 values of the RAF reaction at C20 are 2.4 and 9.8 kcal mol 1 for HOOc and CH3OOc radicals, respectively, whereas the ones at C21 are 9.7 and 10.4 kcal mol 1, in turn. In addition, the lowest DrG\n0 of RAF reactions between RA and HOOc is lower than those obtained by the DFT/M05-2X method for 9-amino-2ethoxy-8-methoxy-3H-benzo[de][1,6]naphthyridine-3-one (5.2 kcal mol 1)61 and tryptamine (2.5 kcal mol 1).78 In contrast to FHT and PL, the DrG\n0 value of the RAF reaction in the PEA solvent is slightly lower than that in water. Indeed, DrG\n0 (C20) values in PEA are equal to 3.4 and 9.0 kcal mol 1 that are lower than those in water, which are 2.4 and 9.8 kcal mol 1 for HOOc and CH3OOc radical, respectively (Table 1).\nMoreover, the SET reactions of RA toward HOOc and CH3OOc radicals also show positive DrG\n0 values of 30.8 and 32.5 kcal mol 1, in sequence. Additionally, the DrG\n0 values are comparable with the ones of trolox (i.e. 19.4 and 21.1 kcal mol 1 for HOOc and CH3OOc radicals, respectively) and ascorbic acid (i.e. 40.0 and 41.7 kcal mol 1 for HOOc and CH3OOc radicals). The non-polar PEA solvent is shown to be unfavorable for the electron transfer reaction as compared to the one in a polar solvent like water. Overall, the FHT and RAF reactions of RA toward HOOc and CH3OOc radicals are likely more favorable than that of the PL and SET reactions.\nDepending on the chemical structure of the potential antioxidant, the RAF reaction may be in competition with the FHT one.1,61,62,78 In this work, the kinetic calculations were considered for the FHT reactions at the O\u2013H sites showing negative DrG\n0 values, also for all RAF and SET reactions. Optimized structures of the transition states (TSs) for FHT and RAF reactions of RA toward HOOc and CH3OOc radicals in water are presented in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. The corresponding Cartesian coordinates and thermochemistry data are also presented in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI le\u2020). The similar data for the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Meanwhile, the distances between the shiing H-atom and the reacted O-atom of the radical are noticeably longer ranging from 1.30 to 1.35 A\u030a for HOOc and from 1.29 to 1.33 A\u030a for CH3OOc. The bent angles for H/O/H in FHT reactions vary from 162.0 to 164.0 . For RAF reactions, the bond distances between the oxygen atom of the radical and the C-sp2 atom range from 1.94 to 1.97 A\u030a, whereas the interactive O/C]C angles change from 95.2 to 108.5 .\nIn order to evaluate the kinetics of HOOc and CH3OOc scavenging reactions for RA , the Gibbs free energy of activation (DGs), diffusion rate constant (kD), TST thermal rate constant (kT), Eckart-tunneling-corrected rate constants (keck), diffusioncorrected apparent rate constants (kapp), and branching ratio (G) for FHT, RAF and SET reactions were calculated at 298.15 K in water and PEA using conventional transition state theory (TST). The kinetics data are shown in Table 2 for the reactions of HOOc radicals and Table 3 for the reactions of CH3OOc radicals.\nAs observed in Table 2, FHT reactions demonstrate lower activation energies (i.e. from 18.6 for O3\u2013H to 20.2 kcal mol 1 for O8\u2013H) than those of RAF reactions (i.e. 21.4 and 23.7 kcal mol 1 for C20 and C21 positions, respectively) as well as than that of the SET reaction (i.e. 36.1 kcal mol 1). As a result,\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFHT reactions have high diffusion-corrected apparent rate constants (kapp), and thus, the products of HOOc radical scavenging of RA almost result from these reactions with a total branching ratio (G) of 99.99%. It is noteworthy that the FHT reaction occurring at O7\u2013H is the fastest with a kapp value of 8.73 102 M 1 s 1 and it accounts for the highest G value of 47.41%. In contrast, RAF and SET reactions occur with very low rate constants; especially, the kapp value of the SET reaction is only 5.03 10 13 M 1 s 1 and, therefore, this reaction hardly contributes to HOOc radical scavenging of RA . Regarding two RAF reactions, the one occurring at the C20 position with a kapp value of 9.76 10 2 M 1 s 1 is more dominant than that at the C21 one showing kapp of 2.65 10 3 M 1 s 1.\nFurthermore, the overall rate coefficient, ktot, for radical scavenging of RA towards HOOc is 1.84 103 M 1 s 1, which is close to those obtained by the DFT/M05-2X method for guaiacol (1.55 103 M 1 s 1),89 1-methyluric acid (1.08 103 M 1 s 1)90 and about 100 times higher than those of vanillin (9.75 101 M 1 s 1),89 caffeine (3.19 101 M 1 s 1),91 and N(1)-acetyl-N(2)formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (4.57 101 M 1 s 1).92\nRegarding the CH3OOc scavenging reactions, the FHT mechanism is also the main process in forming approximately 100% product. The Gibbs free energies of activation (DGs) vary from 18.3 to 21.1 kcal mol 1, while the ones of RAF are 22.3 and 24.4 kcal mol 1 for the reactions at the C20 and C21 positions, respectively.

The non-polar PEA solvent slightly enhances FHT reactions, while it is unfavorable to RAF and especially to SET reactions.\nChemical nature of formal hydrogen transfer (FHT) reactions\nUnderstanding the chemical nature of the formal hydrogen transfer (FHT) process plays an important role in the potential applications of RA in chemical and biological elds. The FHT may occur via two different pathways, i.e. hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), which have similar initial reactants and nal products. For that reason, distinguishing these two processes is always a challenging task that needs multiple supplementary calculations and analyses, e.g. single occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) distributions (Fig. 5), natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses (Table S5, ESI le\u2020), natural population analysis (NPA) charges, atomic spin densities (ASD), and natural electron conguration (NEC) at the transition states (TSs) of FHT reactions (Table S6, ESI le\u2020).\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFig. 5 represents the SOMO distributions at the TSs for FHT reactions with HOOc and CH3OOc radicals at all four hydroxyl groups of RA . Generally, the SOMO of HAT TSs is distributed along the H transition vector between the donor and the acceptor, whereas the one of PCET TSs is orthogonal to the transition vector.61,93 As can be seen in Fig. 5, the 2p orbitals of the acceptor (O atoms of hydroxyl group) and the ones of the donor (O atoms of the radicals) are interacted and distributed along the H-shiing vector. This observation is the rst signal of the HAT process.\nTo provide more insights into the electron density interaction at the TSs of FHT reactions, we also performed the NBO analyses (Table S5, ESI le\u2020). It is generally noted that the electron densities are essentially transferred from the lone pairs of the reactive oxygen atom on HOOc or CH3OOc, i.e., O41 or O42, to the rst unoccupied anti-bonding orbitals of the shied H from the \u2013OH groups. The stabilization energies of these processes vary from 66.0 to 79.0 kcal mol 1 and from 71.2 to 85.8 kcal mol 1 for the reactions with HOOc and CH3OOc radicals, respectively. In the reverse trend, the electron densities are also donated from the electron lone pairs on the reactive oxygen atom of the studied radicals to the rst unoccupied antibonding orbital of the shied-H.\nFurthermore, NPA charge and 1s occupancy of the mitigating H and two involved O atoms at the TSs of the FHT reactions are presented in Table S6 (ESI le\u2020). The results indicate that the NPA charges of the mitigating H are all positive varying from 0.37 to 0.38 e . These charges are similar to that reported in the literature for the HAT mechanism (i.e. 0.31 to 0.4 e ).94 Meanwhile, the NPA charges of two oxygen atoms involved in the FHT reaction are all negative ranging from 0.42 to 0.44 e and from 0.47 to 0.56 e for the reactive O atom of the radical and for the one of RA , respectively. Moreover, the 1s occupancy show that the mitigating H is characterized by 1s0.51\u20130.52 orbital conguration, which corresponds to one H atom with the 1s1.0 conguration. In addition, the spin densities are all located at the H-donor, (i.e. 0.12286\u20130.14291) and -acceptor atoms (i.e. 0.28294\u20130.34933); thus, the ones at the mitigating-H are slightly negative (i.e. about 0.02).

It means that the FHT processes at all four \u2013OH groups have the chemical nature of the HAT mechanism. Preventive antioxidant potential based on iron ion-chelating activities\nThe secondary antioxidant activities of rosmarinic acid based on its ferrous and ferric ion chelation in preventing the formation of the reactive hydroxyl radical (HOc) via the Haber\u2013 Weiss reaction1,95,96 were evaluated. The hydrated Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions existed in the octahedral-coordinated structures with six water molecules, as largely proposed in the literature9,82,97,98 in which the Fe(II) or Fe(III) ion is located at the center and H2O in the corner.\nThe optimized structures and the relative energies of complexes between RA and [Fe(II)(H2O)6] 3+ and [Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ ions are shown in Fig. 6 and 7, respectively. Their Cartesian coordinates and thermochemistry data are resumed in Tables S7 and S8 (ESI le\u2020). Table 4 presents the reaction enthalpies (DrH 0), standard Gibbs free energies (DrG 0), and formation constants (Kf) of the chelating reactions for RA towards the hydrated Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions at 298.15 K. The similar data for the complexation processes between the neutral RA and the [Fe(II)(H2O)6] 2+ and [Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ ions are shown in Tables S9 and S10 (ESI le\u2020), respectively.

Table S11 (ESI le\u2020) resumes Cartesian coordinates and thermochemistry properties of ascorbate mono-anions, ascorbate radicals, superoxide anion radicals, oxygenmolecules, neutral rosmarinic, mono-anion rosmarinate and aqueous iron complexes in water.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6 and 7, the RA can chelate [Fe(II)(H2O)6] 2+ and [Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ ions via 7 oxygen atom positions including O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7, and O8 to form mono-dentate complexes. Besides, the bi-dentate complexes are formed at the two nearby oxygen atom positions, including site1 (O5 and O6), site-2 (O2 and O6), site-3 (O3 and O4), and site-4 (O7 and O8) (Fig. 1). Regarding the Fe(II) complexes, the Fe\u2013O distances of the mono-dentate complexes vary from 1.98 to 2.26 A\u030a, while the ones of the bi-dentate complexes vary from 1.91 to 2.18 A\u030a (Fig. 6). In the case of Fe(III) complexes, the Fe\u2013O lengths vary from 1.84 to 2.06 A\u030a for the mono-dentate complexes and from 1.88 to 2.05 A\u030a for the bidentate ones (Fig. 7). These bond lengths are slightly shorter than those of Fe(II)\u2013RA complexes.\nFurthermore, it is noteworthy that RA represents strong chelating ability towards both Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions compared to its neutral form RA (see Table S12, ESI le\u2020).

View Article Online complexes are also favorable and spontaneous with high Kf values ranging from 8.12 1015 to 1.29 1028; thus, they are abundant in an aqueous environment. In contrast, the other bidentate complexes of RA are unstable with positive DrG 0 and low Kf values. Moreover, the chelating ability of RA towards the [Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ ion is better than the one towards the [Fe(II)(H2O)6] 2+ ion. For example, the DrG 0 and Kf values for\nFe(III) complexes at the site-2 position are equal to 38.4 kcal mol 1 and 1.29 1028, respectively, which are higher than those for Fe(II) complexes being 22.1 kcal mol 1 and 1.61 1016, respectively.\nOverall, since the mono-anion form RA is the main existing form of rosmarinic acid under physiological conditions, RA plays the main role in the secondary antioxidant activity of rosmarinic acid via its chelation towards the iron ions. The most favorable chelating sites of RA constituted the O2, O5, O6, site-1, and site-2 positions. The coordination of RA with the [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ ion is likely to be more favorable and stable than the one with [Fe(II)(H2O)6] 2+.\nPro-oxidant activities of rosmarinic acid\nThe reduction reactions of Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) complexes involved in Fenton-like reactions that produce reactive hydroxyl (HOc) radical9,83 are used to estimate the pro-oxidant risks of rosmarinic acid. The used reducing agents are ascorbate anion (Asc ) and superoxide anion (O2c\n). Tables 5 and 6 represent the reaction enthalpies (DrH\n0) and standard Gibbs free energies (DrG\n0) of Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) reactions and mono-anion rosmarinate (RA ) complexes by Asc and O2c\n, respectively. The similar data of reduction processes of Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) complexes by two reducing agents for the iron complexes of neutral-rosmarinic form (RA) are shown in Table S13 (ESI le\u2020).\nIt can be seen that all the reaction enthalpies (DrH 0) and standard Gibbs free energies of reactions (DrG 0) for the reduction process of the Fe(III) to Fe(II) complexes by both Asc (Table\n5) and O2c (Table 6) are largely negative; thus, these reactions are spontaneous and exergonic. Especially, the reactions between Asc and O2c\nwith mono-dentate complexes at the O8 position and with the bi-dentate complexes at the site-3, site-4 have signicantly negative DrG\n0 values being 49.3 and 47.1 kcal mol 1, 51.9 and 49.7 kcal mol 1, and 53.2 and 51.0 kcal mol 1, respectively. These values are noticeably lower than those of the similar reaction for [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ to [Fe(II)(H2O)6]\n2+ complexes (i.e. 43.5 and 41.3 kcal mol 1, respectively). Furthermore, the DrG\n0 value of the reduction process between the mono-dentate complexes with the two studied reducing agents at O3, O4, and O7 are all lower than those of [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ complexes. Therefore, these complexes are expected to have risk to promote the Fenton reactions. However, it is noted that all three mono-dentate Fe(III) complexes have low Kf values (Table 4); thus, their formation in aqueous solutions can be considered to be negligible, and their pro-oxidant risk is limited.\nOn the contrary, the main existing complexes, including the ones at the O2, O5, O6, site-1, and site-2 positions, do not enhance the Fenton reactions. Indeed, the DrG\n0 values of their reduction reactions with the Asc and O2c\nagents are all higher than 29.1 and 26.9 kcal mol 1, respectively, which are signicantly higher than those of the reduction reaction for [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ complexes ( 43.5 and 41.3 kcal mol 1, respectively). Thus, the reduction processes of Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) complexes are less favorable than that of the Fe(III) complexes in the aqueous phase. Consequently, the pro-oxidant risks of these complexes are not taken into account.\nIn order to evaluate the rate of the reduction reactions for Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) complexes by the Asc and the O2c\nvalues, the kinetics data for these SET processes were calculated using the Marcus theory.71,72 These kinetic parameters including reorganization energy (l), Gibbs free energy of activation (DGs, kcal mol 1), diffusion rate constant (kD, M\n1 s 1), TST thermal rate constant (kT, M\n1 s 1), and diffusion-corrected apparent rate constants (kapp, M 1 s 1) are shown in Tables 5\nn energy (l), Gibbs free energy of activation (DGs, kcal mol 1), diffusion iffusion-corrected apparent rate constants (kapp, M\n1 s 1) calculated at d the iron complexes in water\nTable 6 Reorganization energy (l), Gibbs free energy of activation (DGs, kcal mol 1), diffusion rate constant (kD, M 1 s 1), TST thermal rate constant (kT, M 1 s 1), and diffusion-corrected apparent rate constants (kapp, M 1 s 1) at 298.15 K for the reducing oxidation reaction between the ascorbate anion (Asc ) and the iron complexes in water\nPosition DrH 0 DrG 0 l DGs kD kT kapp\n[Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ + Asc / [Fe(II)(H2O)6] 2+ + Ascc (eqn (26)) 39.3 43.5 24.5 1.1 7.44 109 2.22 1013 7.44 109\n[Fe(III)L(H2O)6 n] x+3 + Asc / [Fe(II)L(H2O)6 n] x+2 + Ascc (eqn (24)) O2 21.4 21.3 24.0 0.5 7.58 109 1.35 1013 7.57 109 O3 42.2 45.4 24.2 4.7 7.60 109 5.77 1010 6.72 109 O4 46.7 46.1 22.8 5.9 7.60 109 6.84 109 3.60 109 O5 21.3 23.7 21.7 0.0 7.62 109 1.4 1014 7.62 109 O6 25.8 29.1 25.8 0.1 7.61 109 1.28 1014 7.61 109 O7 41.7 43.6 22.8 4.8 7.59 109 4.78 1010 6.55 109 O8 45.7 49.3 21.6 8.8 7.64 109 5.04 107 5.00 107 Site-1 21.6 25.9 24.3 0.0 7.60 109 1.45 1014 7.60 109 Site-2 19.8 20.5 19.5 0.0 7.58 109 1.49 1014 7.58 109 Site-3 46.5 51.9 22.3 9.8 7.63 109 9.23 106 9.22 106 Site-4 48.1 53.2 22.5 10.5 7.56 109 2.93 106 2.92 106"

Regarding the reactions between the [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ ion and the Fe(III)\u2013RA complexes with O2c\n(Table 5), almost the complexes have higher reaction rates than that of the [Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ ion. Indeed, the reactions for all the Fe(III)\u2013RA complexes, except the ones formed at O8, site-3 and site-4, have a kapp value varying from 8.43 109 to 8.58 109 M 1 s 1. These values are higher than that of the [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ ion (i.e. 7.63 109 M 1 s 1). This means that these complexes have high risk to the reduction of Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) complexes and thus enhance the Fenton-like reactions. Conversely, the kapp values of the redox reactions between O2c and the Fe(III)\u2013RA complexes obtained at the O8, site-3 and site-4 (i.e. 6.16 109, 3.42 109 and 1.84 109 M 1 s 1, respectively) are smaller than that of the [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ ion. These complexes have high potential to prevent the reduction of the Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) complexes by the O2c\nagent. However, it is noteworthy that the Fe(III)\u2013RA complexes formed at O8, site-3 and site-4 positions are quite negligible (Table 4). Thus, when O2c\nis the reducing agent, the Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) complex reduction processes are enhanced, and the pro-oxidant risks may be remarkable.\nRegarding the redox reaction between the Asc and Fe(III) complexes (Table 6), it can be seen that all reactions are fast and favorable with the kapp value ranging from 2.92 106 to 7.62 109 M 1 s 1 for the ones of the Fe(III)\u2013RA complexes, which are generally lower or similar to the reaction of the [Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ ion (i.e. 7.44 109 M 1 s 1). The kapp value of the reaction of Fe(III)\u2013RA complexes formed at O2, O5, O6, site-1, and site-2 are slightly higher than that of the [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ ion, and thus, these reactions occur slightly faster. Meanwhile, the reactions for the other complexes especially the ones at site-3 and site-4 have lower reaction rates. Indeed, the rates of the Fe(III)\u2013RA complexes at site-3 and site-4 are approximately 800 and 3000 times lower than that for the reaction of the [Fe(III)(H2O)6]\n3+ ion. As a result, these complexes are able to prevent Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) reduction processes by the Asc agent.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Thus, the RA may express the pro-oxidant risk depending on the reducing agent present in the environment."

View Article Online (iv) Reduction processes of Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) complexes by Asc and O2c agents, which may be an initial step for Fenton-like reactions forming reactive HOc radicals were considered in comparison with the self-reduction process of [Fe(III)(H2O)6] 3+ ions. Consequently, RA may enhance the pro-oxidant risk when O2c is present in the reactive media; however, this phenomenon is not observed if Asc is available.\nHopefully, the actual work may provide a multi-facet point of view into the antioxidant potential of rosmarinic acid before further chemical and biological applications."
