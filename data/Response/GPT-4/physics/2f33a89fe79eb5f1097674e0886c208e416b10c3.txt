Exploration of the Pharmacological Effects of Newly Identified Metabolites: With the discovery of four new secondary metabolites in LJT, future research could focus on exploring their pharmacological effects, including potential antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. This research could help in identifying new drug candidates or food additives with health benefits.

Functional Studies of Specific Metabolites in Disease Models: Given the identification of specific metabolites in different tissues of LJT and their potential health benefits, conducting in-depth functional studies using disease models (in vitro and in vivo) could elucidate the specific mechanisms through which these metabolites exert their effects. This could include studies on anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant mechanisms, as well as their effects on specific pathways involved in chronic diseases and cancer.

Agricultural Practices to Enhance Medicinal Component Yield: Research into the impact of various agricultural practices (e.g., soil composition, watering regimes, sunlight exposure) on the yield of specific beneficial metabolites in LJT could provide insights into optimizing cultivation methods for higher quality and more medically potent plants. This could involve comparative analyses of metabolite profiles in plants subjected to different growing conditions.

Comprehensive Utilization of LJT Tissues: While the flower buds of LJT are commonly used medicinally, this study highlights valuable compounds in the flowers, leaves, and stems as well. Future research could focus on the comprehensive utilization of these tissues, including the development of new medicinal products or food additives that incorporate the full range of beneficial metabolites found throughout the plant. This could lead to more sustainable use of LJT by reducing waste and increasing the economic value of the entire plant.

Cross-species Metabolomics Comparisons: Comparative metabolomics studies across different species within the Caprifoliaceae family or even across different medicinal plants used in traditional Chinese medicine could uncover shared or unique metabolic profiles with therapeutic potential. This research could expand the understanding of plant metabolomics and pharmacology, identifying new candidates for drug development or functional foods.
