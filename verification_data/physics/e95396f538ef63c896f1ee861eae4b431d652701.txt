"Finally, despite the faster photolysis of S2O 2 8 , both H2O2 and S2O 2 8 were seen to be efficient in degrading the targets and presented various performances depending on the compound. NAP underwent faster degradation in the presence of S2O 2 8 , which was also the case of DCF but to a lesser extent. However, IBU was degraded faster in the presence of H2O2 in the rural effluents. Despite the faster photolysis of S2O 2 8 allowing faster degradation of DCF and NAP, IBU underwent faster degradation in the presence of H2O2 in the rural effluents. Moreover, although faster degradation induces lower electrical cost to reach similar degradation, treatment cost also includes reagent and labour cost."
