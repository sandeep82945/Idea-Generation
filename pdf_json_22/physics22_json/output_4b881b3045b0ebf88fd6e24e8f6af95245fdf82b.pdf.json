    "abstractText": "In the current work, YAGG:Cr3+ nanophosphors were synthesized by the Pechini method and then annealed at different temperatures in the range 800\u20131300 \u25e6C. The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). The lattice parameters and average crystalline sizes as site occupation by Al3+ and Ga3+ ions were calculated from the Rietveld refinement data. To investigate the effect of crystalline size of the materials on their optical properties: excitation and emission spectra were recorded and analyzed. Finally, the effect of crystalline size on the probability of carrier recombination leading to PersL was determined experimentally with thermoluminescence analyses. The Tmax-Tstop method was applied to determine the trap type and particle size (calcination temperature) effect on their redistribution. A correlation between structural changes and trap redistribution was found. In particular, the extinction of high-temperature TL maximum with increasing annealing temperatures is observed, while low-temperature TL maximum increases and reaches a maximum when the lattice parameter reaches saturation.",

            "text": "The recently observed increase in interest in nanomaterials that could combine luminescent properties with the ability of temporary storage and emission release due to thermal (thermoluminescence, TL) and optical (optically stimulated luminescence, OSL) stimuli has resulted in the numerous publications on so-called persistent nanophosphors [1\u20137]. Due to potential biomedical applications, the most studied compounds are chemically stable oxides with spinel and garnet structures that provide better biocompatibility compared to, for example, fluorides and sulfides. In these materials, specific positions in the crystal lattice are defined, which can be substituted in a controlled way with acceptor and donor ions involved in the mechanism of electron and hole trapping, as well as their release leading to radiative deactivation [2,8]. An additional advantage of garnet and spinel structured materials is the ability to simultaneously control the energy gap value of the host material by introducing appropriate concentrations of other cations [9]. Ceramics and micro and nanocrystals based on the garnet matrix are the most perspective oxide crystals widely used as the active medium in solid-state lasers. Due to the anisotropic optical properties, YAG powders doped with rare-earth (Ce3+, Pr3+, Yb3+, and Nd3+) and transition metals (Mn2+, Cr3+, etc.) are suitable for preparing transparent laser ceramics with the working region in the near-infrared range that is suitable for\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4407. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15134407 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4407 2 of 13\nbio-applications [10]. At the same time, several publications have described the modulation of the band gap by replacing Ga3+ with Al3+ in the Y3Al5-xGaxO12 matrix to obtain Y3Al2Ga3O12 (YAGG) stoichiometry, which has been shown to be optimal for use as garnet PersL host material [9,11,12]. As a result, YAGG:Cr co-doped with lanthanides have gained attention due to their interesting persistent luminescence (PersL) in the visible, red, and NIR range, where Cr ions play an important role in obtaining long-lasting emissions. Unfortunately, the theoretically very predictable results of the above actions for optimizing persistent luminescence (PersL) quality (intensity and duration) are perturbed in nanoscale particles due to structural imperfections related to size effects as well as the greater influence of the environment of these particles on radiative and non-radiative processes occurring in their volume [13]. Additionally, garnet powder is a convenient material for the manufacture of laser and persistent luminescence ceramics from nanosized grains by low-temperature sintering under high pressure [14,15]. Furthermore, the duration and color of PersL are determined by the luminescence center. Therefore, the use of Cr ions both as an independent dopant and as a co-dopant extends the emission time for most of the used matrices and shifts the emission range to the NIR region [9,16\u201318]. In this work, we present the results of a spectroscopic study that allow us to better understand the influence of these effects using a model system of Y3Al2Ga3O12 garnet (YAGG) doped only with chromium ions, which, according to previously accepted models, act both as dopants leading to the formation of trapping centers and leading to the production of PersL. The presented here results of a detailed analysis of traps based on the Tmax-Tstop method in correlation with structural changes\u2014particularly site occupancy\u2014will, in our opinion, help to establish the relationship between structural changes in crystals and their effect on traps creation and redistribution."

The first maximum is linear with a slope near unity, indicating a series of first-order peaks with a quasi-continuous distribution of peaks (and, therefore, of trapping centers) [38,39]. The second maximum consists of a single first-order peak only in the Tmax-Tstop part of the curve (150\u2013200 \u25e6C) and in the further course is simply a line with zero slope [38]. This is because the peak has not shifted as the initial population of trapped charges decreases. From the point of view of the activation energy, the first maximum in all samples is the same and is about 0.75 \u00b1 0.02 eV, which is close to the value observed previously for the same matrix with different co-dopants [17,40]. In contrast, the activation energy of the second maximum noticeably decreased from about 0.9 to 0.5 eV with increasing an annealing temperature. The invariability of the position of the maximum with decreasing activation energy can be explained by the following Equation (1):\n\u03b2E kT2m\n= s\u00b7 exp { \u2212 E\nkTm\n} (1)\nwhere Tm is the glow curve maximum, E is the activation energy, \u03b2 is the heating rate (in K/s), and s\u2014frequency factor (s\u22121). Equation (1) shows that the frequency factor also plays an important role in the de-trapping process. As the activation energy of the second maximum decreases from 0.9 to 0.5 eV, the value of the frequency factor decreases from 108 to 103 s\u22121, and the process of releasing trapped electrons occurs more slowly [37,41]. Finally, it is likely that one TL peak with a position at a higher Tm may have a lower activation energy than the previous one. Combining these results with the previous analysis of the structure and optical properties, it can be concluded with a high probability that the traps with lower energy values are related to changes occurring inside the phosphors. In particular, morphology, phase change, redox reactions of the dopant ions, changes due to clustering of such dopants, etc. Specifically, one of the limiting points may be \u2013OH groups, which may be present in samples after lower annealing temperatures [35] and which can transform into oxygen vacancies as a result of annealing at higher temperatures."

            "text": "It was found, that increasing the annealing temperature to 1100 \u25e6C leads to a decrease in the lattice parameter to 12.164, after which it remains almost unchanged. In parallel, a redistribution of the Ga3+ and Al3+ ions between octa- and tetrahedral sites in the garnet lattice occurs. Above 1100 \u25e6C, most Ga3+ ions (up to 70%) remain in the tetrahedral site while Al ions (up to 55%) move to the octahedral site. These structural changes correlate with the optical characteristics of both PL and PersL. As the grain size increases, the electronphonon coupling decreases, whereas the crystal-field strength increases. A similar trend is observed for thermoluminescence curves. The maximum of the TL intensity reached 1100 \u25e6C and remains unchanged for higher temperatures. It can therefore be concluded that the higher annealing temperature (>1100 \u25e6C) did not improve the optical properties of studied phosphors. Consequently, the YAGG phosphor annealed at 1100 \u25e6C, showing an acceptable degree of particle agglomeration, may already be suitable for practical applications as starting materials for the production of, among others, high-quality optical ceramics and luminescent markers for imaging in the first biological window.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ma15134407/s1, Figure S1: X-ray diffraction patterns with main (hkl) of the samples.
