As this signal depends on both osmological and astrophysical parameters, it should be possible o decipher abundant information about the early Universe from the ignal once it is observed. The low frequency array (LOFAR; Gehlot t al. 2019 ), the precision array to probe the epoch of reionization PAPER; Kolopanis et al. 2019 ), the Murchison wide-field array MWA; Trott et al. 2020 ), the Owens valley radio observatory long avelength array (OVRO-LWA; Eastwood et al. 2019 ), the largeperture experiment to detect the dark age (LEDA; Price et al. 2018 ; arsden et al. 2021 ), and the hydrogen epoch of reionization array HERA; DeBoer et al. 2017 ) are experiments that have analysed ata in an attempt to detect the power spectrum from the EoR. lthough the existing upper limits are weak, they already provide\nnteresting constraints on some of the exotic scenarios (e.g. with xtra radio background as considered here) (Mondal et al. 2020 ; bdurashidova et al. 2022 ).

Thus, we e xpect a great deal of data from observations n the upcoming decade.\nThe question arises as to what are the possible ways to infer he astrophysical parameters from the observed 21-cm power specrum data. Since the characteristic astrophysical parameters at high edshifts are currently almost entirely unconstrained, the 21-cm ignal must be calculated for a large number of parameter sets that o v er a wide range of possibilities. Given the complexity of the 1-cm signal (see Barkana 2018a ; Mesinger 2019 ) and its highly on-linear dependence on the astrophysical parameters, Artificial eural Networks (ANNs) are a useful method for emulation and tting. Shimabukuro & Semelin ( 2017 ) used an ANN to estimate he astrophysical parameters from 21-cm observations. They trained he ANN using 70 data sets where each set consists of the 21-cm ower spectrum obtained using 21CMFAST (Mesinger, Furlanetto & en 2011 ) as input, with three EoR parameters used in the simulation s output. They applied the trained ANN to 54 data sets to e v aluate ow the algorithm performs. Kern et al. ( 2017 ) used a machine earning algorithm to emulate the 21-cm power spectrum and perform ayesian analysis for parameter constraints o v er elev en parameters hich included six parameters of the EoR and X-ray heating and ve additional cosmological parameters.

( 2020 ) introduced the first all sky averaged (global) 21- m signal emulator using an ANN. Recently, Bevins et al. ( 2021 ) and ye, Portillo & Fialkov ( 2022 ) proposed two different approaches or emulating the global 21-cm signal. The astrophysical parameters nd reionization history can also be reco v ered from 21-cm images irectly using convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Gillet et al. 019 ; La Plante & Ntampaka 2019 ). In this paper, we use an mulation method to constrain the 21-cm power spectrum for the even-parameter astrophysical model. Using ANN, we construct an mulator that is trained on a large data set of models that co v er very wide range of the astrophysical parameter space. Given the even-parameter astrophysical model, the emulator is able to predict he 21-cm power spectrum o v er a wide redshift range ( z = 6 to 30).\ne construct our algorithm in a way that approximately accounts or emulation error (i.e. the uncertainty due to the finite size of he training set), and also test the accuracy (and improve the error stimates) using 5-fold cross-validation. We also explore a more ealistic case of the observational measurements expected for the KA, as well as extended models that also include an excess early adio background. We note that any supervised machine learning lgorithm is specific to the particular seminumerical model that is sed to generate the training data. Therefore, the results obtained rom such algorithms may not be directly applicable to simulations onducted using other seminumerical methods (such as 21CMFAST ) r to the real Universe; in further work we plan to test with data enerated with other methods. This paper is organized as follows: We present in Section 2 a escription of the theory and methods used to generate the data sets 2.1\u20132.4) and build the ANN and maximum likelihood estimator 2.5\u20132.6). Section 3 presents our results, for standard astrophysical odels (3.1\u20133.4) and ones with an early radio background (3.5\u20133.6). inally, we summarize our results and discuss our conclusions in ection 4 .\nT H E O RY A N D M E T H O D S\n.1 21-cm signals\n.1.1 Astrophysical parameters\ne use seven key parameters to parametrize the high redshift strophysics: the star formation efficiency ( f ), the minimum circular elocity of star-forming haloes ( V C ), the X-ray radiation efficiency f X ), the power-law slope ( \u03b1) and the low energy cutoff ( E min ) of the ray spectral energy distribution (SED), the optical depth ( \u03c4 ) of the osmic microwave background (CMB), and the mean free path ( R mfp ) f ionizing photons. Here we briefly discuss these astrophysical arameters. \u2022 The star formation efficiency , f , quantifies the fractional mount of gas in star-forming dark matter haloes that is converted nto stars (Tegmark et al. 1997 ). The value of f depends on the details f star formation that are unknown at high redshift, so we treat it as free parameter. We assume a constant star formation efficiency in aloes heavier than the atomic cooling mass and a logarithmic cutoff n the efficiency in lower mass haloes (Fialkov et al. 2013 ). We cover wide range of f values, from 0.0001 to 0.5. \u2022 The circular velocity , V C , is another parameter that encodes he information about star formation. Star formation takes place in ark matter haloes that are massive enough to radiatively cool the inalling gas (Tegmark et al. 1997 ). This is the main element in setting he minimum mass of star-forming haloes, M min . We equi v alently use he minimum circular velocity as one of our free parameters. Since the\nNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nooling and the internal feedback depend on the depth of the potential nd the potential is directly related to V C , it is more physical to use fixed V C versus redshift rather than a fixed M min . Since complex eedback (e.g. Schauer et al. 2015 ) of various types can suppress tar formation in low-mass haloes, we treat V C as a free parameter. n practice the actual threshold is not spatially homogeneous in our imulation since individual pixels are affected by feedback processes ncluding Lyman\u2013Werner feedback on small haloes, photoheating eedback during the EoR, and the streaming velocity between dark atter and baryons. The relation between the circular velocity ( V C ) nd the minimum mass of the dark matter halo ( M min ) is given (in he Einstein de-Sitter limit which is valid at high redshift) by\nC = 16 . 9 ( M min\n10 8 M )1 / 3 (1 + z 10 )1 / 2 ( m 0 . 0316 )1 / 6 km s \u22121 . (1)\n\u2022 The X-ray radiation efficiency , f X , is defined by the standard xpression of the ratio of the X-ray luminosity to the star formation ate ( L X \u2212SFR relation) [see Fialkov, Barkana & Visbal ( 2014 ), ohen et al. ( 2017 ) for more details]\nL X SFR = 3 \u00d7 10 40 f X erg s \u22121 M \u22121 yr . (2)\nn the abo v e e xpression L X is the bolometric luminosity and f X is he X-ray efficiency of the source. The normalization is such that X = 1 corresponds to the typical observed value for low-metallicity alaxies. Given the almost total absence of observational constraints t the rele v ant redshifts, we vary f X from 0.0001 to 1000. \u2022 The power-law slope \u03b1 and the low energy cutoff E min etermine the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED). e parametrize the X-ray SED by the power-law slope \u03b1 (where log( E X )/dlog( \u03bd) = \u2212\u03b1) and the low energy cutoff ( E min ). These two arameters have significant degeneracy, so we vary \u03b1 in the narrow ange 1\u20131.5 and E min in the broad range of 0.1\u20133.0 keV. The SEDs f the early X-ray sources strongly affect the 21-cm signal from both he EoR and cosmic dawn (Fialkov & Barkana 2014 ; Fialkov et al. 014 ). Soft X-ray sources (emitting mostly below 1 keV) produce trong fluctuations on relatively small scales (up to a few tens of pc) whereas hard X-ray sources produce milder fluctuations on arger scales. X-ray binaries (XRB) (Mirabel et al. 2011 ; Fragos t al. 2013 ) are major sources that are expected to have a hard X-ray ED. \u2022 The optical depth of the CMB , \u03c4 , is one of two parameters hat describe the EoR. For given values of the other astrophysical arameters, the CMB optical depth has a one-to-one relation with he ionizing efficiency \u03b6 which is defined by\n= f f esc N ion 1 1 + n\u0304 rec ,\n(3)\nhere f is the star formation efficiency, f esc is the fraction of ionizing hotons that escape from their host galaxy, N ion is the number of onizing photons produced per stellar baryon in star-forming haloes, nd n\u0304 rec is the mean number of recombinations per ionized hydrogen tom. We choose to include the CMB optical depth ( \u03c4 ) in our sevenarameter astrophysical model instead of the ionizing efficiency \u03b6 ) because \u03c4 is directly constrained by CMB observations (Planck ollaboration VI 2020 ). \u2022 The mean free path of ionizing photons , R mfp , is the other oR parameter (Alvarez & Abel 2012 ). R mfp sets the maximum istance travelled by ionizing photons. Due to the process of structure ormation, dense regions of neutral hydrogen (Lyman-limit systems) f fecti vely absorb all the ionizing radiation and thus limit the sphere\no a p 1 2\n2\nI t t t t 2 a i\na c t w\n\u3008 w a F \u03b4 v\nw i s p i b r\n2\nT d e w s \u03b4 a f h r t s h\ns t i b ( e p\ne B L b a e z\n\u03b4\nw p K h a a a t 2 B\nT\nw o [ ( b c t T \u03b1\ns p I r r o l\nL\nw f B a ( l i g E\nc s b a r t r t u\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/527/4/9977/7455895 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nf influence of each ionizing source. The mean free path parameter pproximately accounts for the effect of these dense neutral hydrogen ockets during reionization. In our simulations, we vary R mfp from 0 to 70 comoving Mpc (Wyithe & Loeb 2004 ; Songaila & Cowie 010 ).\n.1.2 Power spectrum\nt is possible in principle to map the distribution of neutral hydrogen hree dimensionally in the early Universe by observing the brightness emperature contrast of the 21-cm line. In order to infer the informaion about the astrophysical processes in the EoR and cosmic dawn, here are a variety of approaches one can follow to characterize the 1-cm signal. Other than the global signal, the most straightforward pproach is to use the statistical description of the 21-cm fluctuations, .e. the 21-cm power spectrum.\nThe 21-cm power spectrum encodes a great deal of information bout the underlying physical processes related to reionization and osmic dawn. We define the power spectrum P ( k ) of fluctuation of he 21-cm brightness temperature (relative to the radio background, hich is the CMB in standard models) by\n \u0303\n\u03b4T b ( k ) \u0303 \u03b4 \u2217 T b ( k \u2032 ) \u3009 = (2 \u03c0 ) 3 \u03b4D ( k \u2212 k \u2032 ) P ( k) , (4) here k is the comoving wave vector, \u03b4D is the Dirac delta function, nd the angular brackets denote the ensemble average. \u02dc \u03b4T b ( k ) is the ourier transform of \u03b4T b ( x ) which is defined by \u03b4T b ( x ) = ( \u03b4T b ( x ) \u2212 T\u0304 b ) / \u00af\u03b4T b . Finally we express the power spectrum in terms of the ariance, in mK 2 units:\n2 = \u3008 \u03b4T b \u3009 2 k 3 P ( k )\n2 \u03c02 , (5)\nhere the expression k 3 P ( k )/2 \u03c02 is dimensionless. The 21-cm signal s significantly non-Gaussian because of both large-scale and smallcale processes during reionization and cosmic dawn. Thus, the ower spectrum does not reveal all the statistical information that s av ailable. Ne vertheless, a wealth of astrophysical information can e extracted from the 21-cm power spectrum and it can be measured elatively easily from observations.\n.2 The excess radio background\nhe first observational signature of the H I 21-cm line from cosmic a wn was tentativ ely detected by the EDGES collaboration (Bowman t al. 2018 ). The shape and magnitude of this signal are not consistent ith the standard astrophysical expectation. The reported 21-cm ignal is centred at \u03bd = 78.2 MHz with an absorption trough of T b = \u2212500 + 200 \u2212500 mK (Bowman et al. 2018 ). The amplitude of bsorption is more than a factor of two larger than that predicted rom standard astrophysics based on the CDM cosmology and ierarchical structure formation. The SARAS 3 experiment recently eported the upper limit of the global signal that is inconsistent with he EDGES signal (Singh et al. 2022 ) at 95 per cent, so it will be ome time before we can be confident that the global 21-cm signal as been reliably measured.\nIf EDGES is confirmed, one possible explanation of this observed ignal is that there is an additional cooling mechanism that makes he neutral hydrogen gas colder than expected; a novel dark matter nteraction with the cosmic gas (Barkana 2018b ) is a viable option, ut it likely requires a somewhat elaborate dark matter model Barkana et al. 2018 ; Berlin et al. 2018 ; Mu \u0303 noz & Loeb 2018 ; Liu t al. 2019 ). Another possibility, which we consider in detail in this aper, is an excess radio background abo v e the CMB (Bowman\nt al. 2018 ; Ewall-Wice et al. 2018 ; Feng & Holder 2018 ; Fialkov & arkana 2019 ; Mirocha & Furlanetto 2019 ; Ewall-Wice, Chang & azio 2020 ; Reis, Fialkov & Barkana 2020b ). This excess radio ackground increases the contrast between the spin temperature nd the background radiation temperature. In this case the basic quation for the observed 21-cm brightness temperature from redshift relative to the background is\nT b = T S \u2212 T rad 1 + z (1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03c4\u03bd ) , (6) here T rad = T CMB + T radio , with T radio being the brightness temerature of the excess radio background and T CMB = 2.725(1 + z) . We consider two distinct types of extra radio models, which we ave considered in previous publications. The external radio model ssumes a homogeneous background that is not directly related to strophysical sources, i.e. may be generated by exotic processes (such s dark matter decay) in the early Universe. In this model, we assume hat the brightness temperature of the excess radio background at the 1-cm rest-frame frequency at redshift z is given by (Fialkov & arkana 2019 )\nradio = A r \u00d7 2 . 725(1 + z) [ 1420 78(1 + z) ]\u03b2 K , (7)\nhere the spectral index \u03b2 = \u22122.6 (set to match the slope of the bserv ed e xtragalactic radio background observ ed by ARCADE2 Fixsen et al. 2011 ; Seiffert et al. 2011 ) and confirmed by LWA1 Dowell & Taylor 2018 )] and A r is the amplitude of the radio ackground. Here 1420 MHz/(1 + z) is the observed frequency orresponding to redshift z, and A r measures the amplitude (relative o the CMB) at the central frequency of the EDGES feature (78 MHz). hus, the external radio model has eight free parameters: f , V C , f X , , E min , \u03c4 , R mfp , and A r . In contrast to this external radio background, astrophysical sources uch as supermassive black holes or supernovae could in principle roduce such an extra radio background due to synchrotron radiation. n such a case, the radio emission would originate from within high edshift radio galaxies and would thus result in a spatially varying adio background, as computed accurately on large scales within ur seminumerical simulations (Reis et al. 2020b ). The galaxy radio uminosity can be written as\nradio ( \u03bd, z) = f R \u00d7 10 22 ( \u03bd\n150 MHz )\u2212\u03b1radio ( SFR M yr \u22121 ) W Hz \u22121 ,\n(8)\nhere \u03b1radio is the spectral index in the radio band, SFR is the star ormation rate, and f R is the normalization of the radio emissivity. ased on observations of low-redshift galaxies, we set \u03b1radio = 0.7 nd note that f R = 1 roughly corresponds to the expected value G \u0308urkan et al. 2018 ; Mirocha & Furlanetto 2019 ). Since extrapolating o w-redshift observ ations to cosmic dawn may be wildly inaccurate, n our analysis we allow f R to vary o v er a wide range. Thus, the alactic radio model is also based on eight parameters: f , V C , f X , \u03b1, min , \u03c4 , R mfp , and f R . Both types of radio background, if they exist, can affect the 21- m power spectrum, leading to a strong amplification of the 21-cm ignal during cosmic dawn and the EoR in models in which the radio ackground is significantly brighter than the CMB. Ho we ver, there re some major differences between the two models. The external adio background is spatially uniform, is present at early cosmic imes (prior to the formation of the first stars), and increases with edshift (i.e. it is very strong at cosmic dawn and weakens during he EoR). On the other hand, the galactic radio background is nonniform, and its intensity generally rises with time as it follows the\nMNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nM\nf r\n2\nT b p i e n t d i\n\u03c3\nw s = B w \u2018 R ( L E d t a r [ o a w a\nu d S k = o w o e t r o t n d e w o b r w D a\n2\nW F c p g ( a h r e m 2 w W ( i r a s s i f p s w w T 4 0 T s s\n( n s r b t r c V\n2\nA s c A n t a c t t t i\nt m\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/527/4/9977/7455895 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\normation of galaxies (as long as f R is assumed to be constant with edshift).\n.3 Mock SKA data\no consider a more realistic case study, we create mock SKA data y including several expected observational effects in the 21-cm ower spectrum, which we refer to as the case \u2018mock SKA data\u2019. To ncorporate the SKA noise case within the data, (i) we include the ffect of the SKA angular resolution, (ii) we add a pure Gaussian oise smoothed o v er the SKA resolution as a realization of the SKA hermal noise. The strength of the SKA thermal noise (for a frequency epth corresponding to 3 comoving Mpc and assuming a 1000 h ntegration) is approximated by\nthermal = a (\n1 + z 17\n)b , (9)\nhere a and b depend on the resolution used. Here we use a moothing radius, R SKA = 20 Mpc, for which a = 4 mK and b 5.1 for z > 16, while for lower redshifts, b = 2.7 [following anet et al. ( 2021 ), see also Koopmans et al. ( 2015 )] and (iii) e remo v e (i.e. set to zero) modes from part of the k -space (the foreground wedge\u2019) that is dominated by foregrounds [following eis, Barkana & Fialkov ( 2020a ), see also Datta, Bowman & Carilli 2010 ); Morales et al. ( 2012 ); Dillon et al. ( 2014 ); Pober et al. ( 2014 ); iu, Parsons & Trott ( 2014a , b ); Jensen et al. ( 2015 ); Pober ( 2015 )]. ach of the three effects is included along with its expected redshift ependence. Re garding the fore ground a v oidance/filtering, we note hat we assume that the high-resolution maps of the SKA will enable first step of reasonably accurate foreground subtraction, so that the emaining wedge-like region that must be set to zero will be limited corresponding to the \u2018optimistic model\u2019 of Pober et al. ( 2014 )]. In rder to gain some understanding of the separate SKA effects, we lso consider a case that we label \u2018SKA thermal noise\u2019. In this case, e add the effect of SKA resolution and thermal noise, i.e. the same s \u2018mock SKA data\u2019 except without foreground a v oidance. Gi ven the lo wer sensiti vity, for cases with mock SKA effects we se coarser binning, as we do not expect the results to depend on the etailed power spectrum shape that would come out in finer binning. pecifically, we used eight redshift bins and five k bins. The five -bins are spaced evenly in log scale between k = 0.05 Mpc \u22121 and k 1.0 Mpc \u22121 ; we average the 21-cm power spectrum at each redshift v er the range of k values within each bin. To fix the redshift bins, e imagine placing our simulation box multiple times along the line f sight, so that our comoving box size fixes the redshift range of ach bin. F or e xample, we start with z = 27.4, which corresponds o 50 MHz (the limit of the SKA), as the far side of the highest edshift bin. Then the centre of the box is 192 comoving Mpc (half f our 384 Mpc box length) closer to us. The redshift corresponding o the centre is taken as the central redshift of the first bin. The ext redshift bin is 384 Mpc closer and so on. As the total comoving istance between z = 27.4 and z = 6 is around 3000 Mpc, we obtain ight redshift bins that naturally correspond to a line-of-sight filled ith simulation boxes. We then average the 21-cm power spectrum v er the redshift range spanned by each box along the line of sight, y using the simulation outputs which we have at finer resolution in edshift. This averaging is part of the effect of observing a light cone; hile there is also an associated anisotropy (Barkana & Loeb 2006 ; atta et al. 2012 ), in this paper we only consider the spherically veraged 21-cm power spectrum.\nNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\n.4 Method to generate the data set\ne use our own seminumerical simulation code (Visbal et al. 2012 ; ialkov & Barkana 2014 ), which we have named 21 cmSPACE (21- m Seminumerical Predictions Across Cosmological Epochs), to redict the 21-cm signal for each possible model. The simulation enerates realizations of the Universe in a large cosmological volume 384 3 comoving Mpc 3 ) with a resolution of 3 comoving Mpc o v er wide range of redshifts (6 to 50). The simulation follows the ierarchical structure formation and the evolution of the Ly \u03b1, Xay, Lyman\u2013Werner (LW), and ionizing ultraviolet radiation. The xtended Press\u2013Schechter formalism is used to compute the star foration rate in each cell at each redshift (Barkana & Loeb 2004 ). The 1-cm brightness temperature cubes are output by the simulation and e use them to calculate the 21-cm power spectrum at each redshift. hile this seminumerical simulation was inspired by 21 CMFAST Mesinger, Furlanetto & Cen 2011 ), it is an entirely independent mplementation with various differences such as more accurate Xay heating (including the effect of local reionization on the X-ray bsorption) and Ly \u03b1 fluctuations (including the effect of multiple cattering and Ly \u03b1 heating). Inhomogeneous processes such as the treaming velocity, LW feedback, and photoheating feedback are also ncluded in the code. We created a mock 21-cm signal using the code or a large number of astrophysical models and calculated the 21-cm ower spectrum for each parameter combination. Considering first tandard astrophysical models (without an excess radio background), e generated the 21-cm power spectrum for 3195 models that co v er a ide range of possible values of the seven astrophysical parameters. he ranges of the parameters were f = 0.0001 \u2212 0.50, V C = .2 \u2212 100 km s \u22121 , f X = 0.0001 \u2212 1000, \u03b1 = 1.0 \u2212 1.5, E min = .1 \u2212 3.0 keV, \u03c4 = 0.01 \u2212 0.12, and R mfp = 10.0 \u2212 70.0 Mpc. he sampling of different parameters is done using randomly elected values o v er these wide ranges in the sev en-parameter pace.\nAs e xplained abo v e, our analysis involv ed two more data sets 3195 models each) of 21-cm power spectra, with either full SKA oise or SKA thermal noise only, in order to analyse a more realistic ituation. In order to investigate the two scenarios of the excess adio background (where the number of free parameters is increased y one), we use two new data sets of models: 10 158 models with he galactic radio background and 5077 models with the external adio background. Throughout this work, we adopt the CDM osmology with cosmological parameters from Planck Collaboration III ( 2014 ).\n.5 Artificial neural network\nNN (often simply called neural networks or NN) are computing ystems that mimic in some ways the biological neural networks that onstitute the human brain. We briefly summarize their properties. n ANN consists of a collection of artificial neurons. Each artificial euron has inputs and produces a single output which can be he input of multiple other neurons. In our analysis, we utilize Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) which is a deep neural network onsisting of fully connected layers. To define the architecture of he neural network, several parameters must be specified, including he number of hidden layers, the number of nodes in each layer, he acti v ation function, the solver, and the maximum number of terations.\nAn MLP (Ramchoun et al. 2016 ) is a supervised learning algorithm hat learns to fit a mapping f : X m \u2192 Y n using a training data set, where is the input dimension and n is the output dimension. When we\na n M T m e h n n h l o a ( w n o a t l r f p n W t r n p a c b u i\na\nn t f k\nf a M r\ng w ( t b\ng i d t\nt t m\nt m s i c w i\n2\nF a l S n b a 2 0 3 s\nl d d t w t t m s a o c d t m F ( d m i u i t i c a a w e l r c t a t h t a s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/527/4/9977/7455895 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\npply unknown data as a set of input features X = x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,..., x m , the eural network uses the mapping to infer the target output ( Y ). This LP can be used for both classification and regression problems. he advantage of an MLP is that it can learn highly non-linear odels. Every neural network has three different types of layers ach consisting of a set of nodes or neurons. They are the input layer, idden layer, and output layer. The input layer consists of a set of eurons that represent the input features X = x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,..., x m . Each euron in the input layer is connected to all the neurons in the first idden layer with some weights and each node in the first hidden ayer is connected to all the nodes in the next hidden layer and so n. The output layer receives the values from the last hidden layer nd transforms them to the output target value. A specific weight w ij ) and a bias ( b j ) are applied to every input or feature. Both the eight and the bias are initially chosen randomly. For a particular euron in the i \u2019th hidden layer, if m i is the input and n j is the output f that neuron, then n j = f ( \u2211 i w ij m i + b j ), where f is called the cti v ation function. Using linear acti v ation functions would make he entire network linear in the inputs, and thus equi v alent to a one ayered network. Thus, non-linear acti v ation functions such as a ectified linear unit (ReLu; Hara, Saito & Shouno 2015 ), sigmoid unction (Han & Moraga 1995 ), etc., are typically used in order to rovide the ability to handle complex, non-linear data. The precise ature of the non-linearity depends on the acti v ation function used. e use the sigmoid acti v ation function, f ( x ) = 1/(1 + e \u2212x ). When he absolute value of the input is large, this function saturates and eturns a constant output. The output obtained from the acti v ated euron is then utilized as the input for the next hidden layer. The rimary objective of training an ANN is to determine a set of weights nd biases that enable the ANN to generate output vectors that are onsistent with the desired output, for a given set of input vectors. A ackpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams 1986 ) is sually used to train an ANN. The training procedure for a network nvolv es sev eral steps:\n(i) Initialization: Randomly chosen initial weights and biases are pplied to all the nodes or neurons in each layer.\n(ii) Forward propagation: The output is computed using the neural etwork based on the initial choices of the weights and biases given he input from the training data set. Since the calculation progresses rom the input to the output layer (through the hidden layers), this is nown as forward propagation. (iii) Error estimation: An error function (often called a loss unction) is used to compute the difference between the predicted nd the true (known) output of the model, given the current weights. LP uses different loss functions based on the problem type. For egression, a common choice is the mean square error. (iv) Backpropagation and updating of the weights: A backpropaation algorithm minimizes the error function and finds the optimal eight values, typically by using the gradient descent technique Kingma & Ba 2014 ). The outermost weights get updated first and hen the updates propagates towards the input layer, hence the term ackpropagation. (v) Repetition until convergence: In each iteration, the weights et updated by a small amount, so to train a neural network several terations are required. The number of iterations until convergence epends on the learning rate and the optimization method used in he network.\nOnce the network has been trained using the training data set, he trained network can make predictions for arbitrary input data hat were not a part of the training set. We note that in the various\nappings presented below, when we train emulators using simulated\nraining sets, we do this separately for each of our cases of ideal data, ock SKA data, and SKA thermal noise only. In each case the power pectra within the training set are generated from 21-cm images that nclude the observational effects that correspond to the appropriate ase. By applying the observational effects directly to the images, e are working in the spirit of a forward pipeline simulation, which s designed to be as realistic as possible.\n.5.1 Astrophysical parameter predictions\nor the purpose of predicting the astrophysical parameters, we dopted a four-layer MLP (input layer + two hidden layers + output ayer) from the Scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al. 2011 ). pecifically, there are 150 neurons in the first hidden layer and 50 eurons in the second hidden layer. The network was expected to e somewhat complex as we want a mapping between the seven strophysical parameters of the model and, on the other side, the 1-cm power spectrum for 32 values of the wavenumber in the range .05 Mpc \u22121 < k < 1.0 Mpc \u22121 and for redshifts ranging from 6 to 0. For the purpose of predicting the parameters, the 21-cm power pectra are the input and the astrophysical parameters are the output.\nData pre-processing is an important step before applying machine earning. We have two pre-processing steps in the code: (1) Stanardization of the data sets, and (2) Dimensionality reduction of the ata sets. If individual features have large differences in their ranges, hose with large ranges will dominate o v er those with small ranges, hich leads to biased results. Thus it is important to transform all he features to comparable scales, i.e. perform standardization of he data. Mathematically, to do the standardization, we subtract the ean from each value of each feature and then divide it by the tandard deviation. After standardization, all the features are centred round zero and have identical variances. For optimal performance f the learning algorithm, it is best that the individual features are as lose as possible to standard normally distributed data (a Gaussian istribution with zero mean and unit variance). For standardization of he features, we use the StandardScaler class from the preprocessing\nodule in the Scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al. 2011 ). or dimensionality reduction, we use Principal Component Analysis PCA; Jolliffe & Cadima 2016 ) to project our data into a lower imensional space. In the case of predicting the seven parameter odel, the input dimension for a particular model is 25 \u00d7 32, which s quite high and makes the learning algorithm too slow. Thus we se PCA to speed up the learning algorithm. Though the reduction n dimensionality results in loss of information, the data sets with he reduced dimension are sufficiently good to encode the most mportant relationships between the data points. Using PCA with 200 omponents, we are able to reduce the input dimension by 75 per cent, nd capture > 99 per cent of the data variance; for the mock SKA nd SKA thermal noise cases, the number of components is lower so e use all of them without dimensionality reduction. We transform ach data set (both the parameters and the 21-cm power spectra) in og scale (log 10 ) before applying it to the MLP regressor. In our MLP egressor, we set the maximum number of iterations to 10 000. We hoose the logistic sigmoid function as the acti v ation function for he hidden layers, an adaptive learning rate initialized with 0.001 nd the stochastic gradient-based optimizer (Kingma & Ba 2014 ) for he weight optimization. No early stopping criteria has been used ere. We use 2557 models (which is 80 per cent of our full data set) o train the neural network, and we then apply the trained ANN to test data set consisting of 639 models (20 per cent of our full data et). Throughout this paper, for simplicity we choose test cases that\nMNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nM\nh h\nt w n C s m l t g\n2\nI p t W o g\nb T M p m a r t 2 v s t e o t 2 S i l W t B 1 n s g\n2\nG p t p o t p s n o\nf e ( a t e v d t s W t b r\nw d t (\ni t b\np\nw f I t\nL\nT\nw\ns\nt a c p i p ( t d H i t w\n\u03c3\nT e m d r\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/527/4/9977/7455895 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nave non-zero power spectra from intergalactic hydrogen, i.e. that ave not fully reionized by redshift 6. The mapping presented in this subsection, of the power spectrum o the parameters, is included for completeness, and since it is useful henever a quick but still accurate result of the parameter fitting is eeded. Ho we ver, in the rest of this paper we focus more on Markov hain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting (Hogg, Bovy & Lang 2010 ), ince that allows us to also generate estimates of errors as well as ultiparameter error contours; in that application, we make only imited use of the mapping presented in this subsection, as a method o obtain a good first guess of the seven astrophysical parameters iven a 21-cm power spectrum.\n.5.2 Emulation of the 21-cm power spectrum\nf the statistical description of the 21-cm signal (here the 21-cm ower spectrum) is our main focus, then we hope to a v oid the need o run a seminumerical simulation for each parameter combination.\ne can instead construct an emulator that provides rapidly computed utput statistics that capture the important information in the signal iven a set of astrophysical parameters. We train a neural network to predict the 21-cm power spectrum ased on the seven parameter astrophysical model specified abo v e. his trained network/emulator is used primarily for inference using CMC (hereafter, the word \u2018emulator\u2019 refers to the network that redicts the power spectrum given the seven parameter astrophysical odel). As in the case of the ANN to predict the parameters, here lso we standardize the features as part of data pre-processing. To educe the dimension of the power spectrum data, we apply PCA ransformation to the data; after experimentation we found that here 0 PCA components suffice to capture > 98 per cent of the data ariance. As before, we again use a log scale for both the data et of the parameters and the 21-cm power spectra. Next we need o find the appropriate neural network architecture to construct the mulator. For this, we choose some specified hyperparameters for ur MLP estimator and search among all possible combinations o find the best one to use in our MLP regressor. To emulate the 1-cm power spectrum, we employ a three layer MLP from the cikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al. 2011 ) with 134 neurons n each layer. Thus, the full network architecture consists of five ayers in total: input layer, three hidden layers, and output layer.\ne use the logistic sigmoid function (Han & Moraga 1995 ) as he acti v ation function for the hidden layer and limited-memory ro yden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldf arb\u2013Shanno (BFGS) optimizer (Byrd et al. 995 ) for the weight optimization. As before, we fix the maximum umber of iterations to 10 000. After emulating the 21-cm power pectrum, we need to inverse PCA transform the predicted data to et back the power spectrum in original dimensions.\n.6 P osterior distrib ution of the astrophysical model\niven the 21-cm power spectrum, we can predict the seven astrohysical parameters that describe the EoR and the cosmic dawn using he NN trained on the data set consisting of the seven astrophysical arameters and the 21-cm power spectrum P ( k ) o v er the wide range f redshifts of interest. This parameter estimation is very compuationally fast. Ho we ver, estimating uncertainties on the predicted arameters using a traditional neural network, as employed in this tudy, is not straightforward. One solution is to use a Bayesian neural etwork that incorporates uncertainties while making predictions on utput parameters (Hort \u0301ua, Volpi & Malag \u0300o 2020 ). Leaving this for\nNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nuture investigation, here we take a hybrid approach. In order to stimate the astrophysical parameters as well as their uncertainties including complete information on covariances), our approach is s follows. First we use the NN to predict the parameters given he 21-cm power spectrum. Then we employ our power spectrum mulator to an MCMC sampler, using the predicted parameter alues as the initial guesses; the emulator allows us to a v oid a irect dependence on the seminumerical simulation, thus making he MCMC process computationally fast. The final output of the ampler is the posterior probability distribution for the parameters. e report the median of each of the marginalized distributions of he parameters as the predicted value and calculate the uncertainty ound based on quantiles. This is discussed in further detail in the esults section, below.\nIn order to estimate the uncertainties in predicting the parameters e follow a Bayesian analysis for finding the posterior probability istribution of the parameters. We use MCMC methods for sampling he probability distribution functions or probability density functions pdfs).\nThe posterior pdf for the parameters \u03b8 given the data D , p ( \u03b8 | D ), s, in general, the likelihood p ( D | \u03b8 ) (i.e. the pdf for the data D given he parameters \u03b8 ) times the prior pdf p ( \u03b8 ) for the parameters, divided y the probability of the data p ( D ):\n( \u03b8 | D) = p ( D| \u03b8 ) p ( \u03b8 ) p ( D) , (10)\nhere the denominator p ( D ) can be thought of as a normalization actor that makes the posterior distribution function integrate to unity. f we assume that the noise is independent between data points, then he likelihood function is the product of the conditional probabilities\n= N \u220f\nn = 1 p( D n | \u03b8 ) . (11)\naking the logarithm,\nln L = \u22121 2 N \u2211 n = 1\n[ [ D n \u2212 D n , model ( \u03b8 )] 2\ns 2 n + ln (2 \u03c0s 2 n )\n] , (12)\nhere we set\n2 n = \u03c3 2 n + D 2 n , model f 2 . (13)\nThe likelihood function here is assumed to be a Gaussian, where he variance is modelled as is common for the MCMC procedure, as sum of a constant plus a multiple of the predicted data (i.e. as a ombination of an absolute error and a relative error). Here f is a free arameter that gives the MCMC procedure some flexibility, so we nclude it ef fecti vely as an additional model parameter. We apply the rocedure to obtain the posterior distribution for all the parameters seven astrophysical parameters and f ) and then marginalize o v er he extra parameter ( f ) to obtain the properly marginalized posterior istribution for the seven astrophysical parameters (Hogg et al. 2010 ). ere the index n denotes various z-bins and k -bins, where the data D n s the mock observation of the 21-cm power spectrum and D n, model is he predicted 21-cm power spectrum from the emulator. In this work e adopt an ef fecti ve constant error of:\nn = 0 . 25 mK 2 . (14) his ensures that the algorithm does not try to achieve a low relative rror when the fluctuation itself is lo w (belo w \u223c0.5 mK) and likely ore susceptible to systematic errors in realistic data. What we have escribed here is a typical setup for MCMC. We emphasize that egardless of our detailed assumptions, in the end we have test models\nTable 1.

When we use one of the data sets with observational noise and ther SKA effects, we modify equation ( 13 ) as follows: 2 n = \u03c3 2 n + \u03c3 2 var , n + D 2 n , model f 2 , (15) here \u03c3 2 var , n is the variance (for each bin of z and k ) of the SKA oise power spectrum, found separately for the mock SKA and SKA hermal noise cases. We found these expected variances by randomly enerating observational (i.e. signal-free) data. We did not include o-variances among different bins since we found that the correlation oefficients are much smaller than unity (no more than a few percent), ndeed so small that their values did not converge even with tens of housands of samples. We use the emcee sampler (F oreman-Macke y et al. 2013 ) which s the af fine-inv ariant ensemble sampler for MCMC (Goodman & eare 2010 ). The MCMC sampler only computes the likelihood hen the parameters are within the prior bounds. We set the prior ounds for the parameters according to Table 1 and we use flat priors or the parameter values (in log except for \u03b1 and E min ). RESULTS .1 Performance analysis of the emulator e show the performance of the emulator of the 21-cm power pectrum in Fig. 1 . We compare the emulated power spectrum nd the true power spectrum from the seminumerical simulation or two particular k values. The left panel shows a few random xamples of the emulated power spectrum (solid lines) and the true ower spectrum (dashed lines). The different colours denote different odels. In this figure, we see that the accuracy of the emulator is enerally good and tends to impro v e with the height of the power pectrum, although there is some random variation among different odels. A more representative, statistical analysis of the accuracy is hown further below. The right panel of Fig. 1 shows a few random examples of the\nomparison between the power spectrum emulated by the emulator rained using mock SKA data set and the true power spectrum rom the mock SKA data set. The different colours denote different stroph ysical models. Ag ain, the emulation is seen to be reasonably ccurate, although in some cases the emulated 21-cm power spectrum ignificantly deviates from the actual one at low redshift and/or when he power spectrum is low. The variations intrinsic to the different\nodels in the power spectra (left panels in Fig. 1 ) are heavily uppressed once we include the expected observational effects of he SKA experiment into the power spectra (right panels in Fig. 1 ). n particular, the thermal noise dominates at high redshift. Ho we ver, s we find from the results below, when we fit the power spectrum ith SKA noise there is still significant information in the data that\nllows the fitting procedure to reconstruct the input parameters. An dvantage of machine learning is that the algorithm learns directly ow to best deal with noisy data, and there is no need to try to xplicitly model or fit the observational effects.\n.2 Dependence of the emulation error on the redshift and avenumber\nor a more detailed assessment of the emulator, we calculate how he error varies with redshift and wav enumber. F or this we use a est data set of 639 models (which is 20 per cent of our full data et) for each of the cases: ideal data set, mock SKA data, and SKA hermal noise case. We first directly test the emulator by comparing he predicted power spectrum (feeding into the emulator the known rue parameters) to the true simulated power spectrum (as in the revious subsection, but here divided separately into k and z bins). In ddition, we test the complete framework by finding the best-fitting strophysical parameters to mock data using the MCMC sampler; eeding the best-fitting parameters to the emulator of the power pectrum; and finding the error of this best-fitting predicted power pectrum compared to the true simulated power spectrum. In cases ith SKA noise (mock SKA data set and SKA thermal noise case), e are not interested in finding the error in the predicted power pectrum with SKA noise (as the power spectrum is often dominated y noise, especially at high redshifts); instead, we make the more hallenging comparison of the best-fit predicted power spectrum to he true power spectrum, both in their \u2018clean\u2019 versions (i.e. without KA noise). To be clear, this means taking the reconstructed besttting astrophysical parameters (which were reconstructed from the ock SKA data set, based on the NN trained using mock SKA ower spectrum), and using it as input to the NN trained using power pectra from the ideal data set (i.e. without SKA noise). Here we use he following definition to quantify the error as a function of redshift nd wavenumber:\nrror ( z, k) = Median \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 predicted clean \u2212 2 true clean 2 true clean + 0 . 25 mK 2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (16) here we take the median o v er the test models; in this paper we ften take the median in order to measure the typical error and educe the sensitivity to outliers. This definition of the error measures he absolute value of the relative error, except that the denominator ncludes a constant in order not to demand a lo w relati ve error when he fluctuation itself is low [in agreement with equation ( 14 )]. Note hat here the errors are much larger than before because they are not ormalized to the maximum value of the power spectrum but are easured separately at each bin, including when the power spectrum s low. In Fig. 2 , we show how the error varies with wavenumber (top anels) and redshift (bottom panels), for both the ideal and SKA ases (mock SKA data set and SKA thermal noise case). For the irect emulation case (left-most panels, where we emulate the power pectrum using the true parameters from the test data set), the relative rror decreases with wavenumber up to k \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2 Mpc \u22121 , then lateaus, and again increases abo v e k \u223c 0.6 Mpc \u22121 . The redshift ependence shows a less regular pattern, except that the errors tend o increase both at the low-redshift and high-redshift end. Overall, he typical emulation error of the power spectrum in each bin is 0 \u2212 20 per cent o v er a broad range of k and z, but it rises abo v e 0 per cent at the lowest and highest k values (for most redshifts), nd at the lowest redshift for all k values (i.e. at z = 6, near the end f reionization, when the power spectrum is highly variable and is\nMNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nM\nFigure 1.

For some perspective, e note that a 20 per cent error is typically adopted to represent the ystematic theoretical modelling error in the 21-cm power spectrum e.g. Greig & Mesinger 2015 , 2017 ). In the panels in the second olumn from the left, we use the best-fitting parameters derived rom the network trained using ideal data set to emulate the power pectrum. From the comparison to the left-most panels, we see that he fitting of the astrophysical parameters (in this ideal case) is nearly erfect, in that the error that it adds is small compared to the error f the emulator itself. In the panels in the third column, the besttting parameters are derived from the network trained using mock KA data set, but as noted abo v e, the errors are calculated for the bility to predict the real power spectrum, i.e. by comparing the true ower spectrum to the prediction of the emulator that was trained sing the power spectrum without SKA noise. SKA noise reduces he accuracy of the reconstruction of the astrophysical parameters ut not by too much, increasing the typical errors by a fairly uniform actor of \u223c1.5, to 15 \u2212 30 per cent for most values of k and z. For the anels in the last column, we use the best-fitting parameters derived rom the network trained using the power spectrum of SKA thermal oise case. The errors are nearly identical to the full SKA noise anels, showing that the foreground effects do not add substantial rror beyond the angular resolution plus thermal noise, at least for he optimistic foreground a v oidance model that we have assumed.\nIn order to get a better understanding of the span of the models v er k and z, we show in Fig. 3 characteristic quantities that enter nto the abo v e calculation of the relative errors. In the left column, we how the median of the clean power spectrum (without any noise) as a unction of the wavenumber (upper panel) and redshift (lower panel). n the other columns, the median of the absolute difference between he true and predicted clean power spectra is shown as a function f wavenumber (upper panels) and redshift (lower panels). For the anels in the middle column, the best-fitting parameters are derived\nrom the network without any noise (i.e. ideal data set), whereas or the panels in the right column we use the best-fitting parameters erived from the network trained using mock SKA data set to emulate he clean power spectrum (without noise). This figure shows that he 21-cm power spectrum varies greatly as a function of k and z, ven when we take out the model-to-model variation by showing the edian of the 639 random test cases. The variation is by three and a alf orders of magnitude; even if we ignore the parameter space in hich the fluctuation level is lower than 0.5 mK (see equation 14 ), e are left with a range of more than two orders of magnitude. For he considered ranges, the o v erall variation with redshift at a given avelength is much greater than the variation with wavelength at a iv en redshift. Ov er this large range, the relativ e error in each case with or without SKA noise) remains relatively constant; this is seen y the panels in Fig. 3 that show the relative error, which overall ollows a similar pattern (with z and k ) as the power spectrum except ith a compressed range of values.\n.3 Errors in the fitted astrophysical parameters\np to now, we have examined the errors in emulating or recontructing the 21-cm power spectrum. Of greater interest is, of course, he ability to extract astrophysical information from a given power pectrum. In addition to the una v oidable effect on the fitting of the mulation uncertainty, there are also the SKA observational effects.\nIn order to account for the emulation uncertainty, we employed a ethod in the spirit of k -fold cross-validation, where the training data et is randomly divided into k portions, and each model is trained n various k \u2212 1 portions (we emphasize that this is completely eparate from the actual k -fold cross-validation that we perform in he next subsection). We added the k MCMC chains from all the runs nd used the resulting combined chain to get parameter uncertainties nd error contours. We used k = 40 for the algorithm described\nMNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nM\nFigure 4.

The posterior probability for one astrophysical odel is shown in Fig. 4 , for the ideal data set ( A1 shows the same\nxample for the case of the mock SKA data). The figure shows the osterior distribution of the seven parameter astrophysical model for n example power spectrum from the ideal data set. In this figure the rey dashed lines denote the true parameters from the simulation. s the posteriors are not perfectly Gaussian, we report the median f the distribution (black dashed lines) as the predicted parameter alue from the MCMC sampler. The results are rather insensitive o \u03b1, and so its value is not well determined, and thus extends to he limits of the prior assumed range, especially in the noisy cases\nNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nwhere the errors are larger). In the case of R mfp , the upper limit runs nto the edge of the assumed range, in the the mock SKA case. As oted in section 2.1.1 , we assumed a reasonable upper limit to R mfp ased on observational and theoretical constraints; in the future, e plan to explore more realistic modelling of the end stages of eionization. More generally, while this type of result for individual models s interesting, we prefer to look at properties that more generally haracterize the broad range of possible astrophysical models. In rder to understand the general trends, we consider below the o v erall tatistics of the fitting as calculated for a large number of models.\nFigure 5.

We calculate in each case the - \u03c3 MCMC uncertainty. In order to test whether this uncertainty s a realistic error estimate, we calculate the normalized error in redicting a parameter ( P predicted ) compared to the true value ( P true ), hich we term the z \u2212score : \u2212score = P true \u2212 P predicted \u03c3 . (17)\nf \u03c3 is an accurate estimate then the actual values of this normalized rror (i.e. z \u2212score ) for the test data set should have a standard eviation of unity. All these quantities, namely P true , P predicted , and , are measured in log space (log 10 ) for all the parameters except or \u03b1 and E min . To test and impro v e the error estimation using our procedure,\ne perform k -fold cross-validation. In k -fold cross-validation, the raining sample is partitioned into subsets, reserving one subset for esting while training the emulator on the remaining data. We then\nepeat this process k times, each time using a different subset as the est data. Comparing the different cases gives validation (if the results o not vary too much), while taking the mean of various statistics mong the k -folds gives better estimates. Here we choose to work ith k = 5 so that each of our validation sets consists of a test data et equal to 20 per cent of the whole data set. We note that the PCA eduction (as described in Section 2 ) is performed on the training ata for each of the k -folds. We show the combined histogram of the z-score from all 5-folds n predicting each of the parameters in Fig. 5 (for the three most mportant parameters of high-redshift galaxies) and Fig. B1 (for the our other parameters, shown in the Appendix). In these figures, the eft panels are for the ideal data, the middle panels are for the case ith mock SKA data, and the right panels are for the SKA thermal oise case. The black solid line in each panel shows the best-fitting aussian of the histogram, also listing its mean ( \u03bc) and standard eviation ( \u03c3 ) within the panel. The two grey dashed lines in each anel represent the 3 \u03c3 boundary of the respective Gaussian.

The best-fitting values to the combined istributions (shown in the Figures) agree rather closely with the ean values of the Gaussian parameters (shown in the Tables). The standard deviations ( \u03c3 ) for most of the seven parameters re close to unity (within \u223c 20 per cent ), which implies that our rocedure generates a reasonable estimate of the uncertainties. The rrors are significantly smaller than expected for \u03c4 , and also (to a esser extent) for f and V C . In the noisy cases, the error is significantly nderestimated for f X (which is the parameter that has the largest log ncertainty). The mean (which measures the bias in the prediction) s in every parameter at most 0.3 \u03c3 in size, for the ideal data set. The ock SKA data set and SKA thermal noise case give similar results o each other, consistent with the similar comparison in Fig. 2 . With he noisy data, the mean values are biased by as much as \u223c1.4 \u03c3 or some of the parameters ( f X and E min ), with significant skewness hat fa v ours lo w v alues (particularly for f ). Even though the thermal oise is assumed to be Gaussian, it is quite large (especially at high edshifts), and when this is combined with the highly non-linear ependence of the power spectrum on the astrophysical parameters, he resulting distributions are significantly non-Gaussian. When tting real data, these results can be used directly as estimates of\nhe expected error distributions. It may also be possible to impro v e he procedure in order to reduce the errors and the bias. In the case f noisy data, various regularization techniques such as dropout or eight decay, or exploring alternative network architectures, might e ef fecti v e in impro ving the predictions. We leav e for future work urther exploration of these possibilities. We also note that most of he distributions are fairly Gaussian, in that only a small fraction of he samples yield best-fitting parameter values that fall outside the \u03c3 boundary of the respective Gaussian fit.\nNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nIn Figs 6 and B2 (the latter in the Appendix), we show the ombined histogram of the size of the actual error ( | P true \u2212 P predicted | ) rom all 5-folds for each of the parameters. In the left panels we ompare the histogram of the actual error for the cases: ideal data nd mock SKA data, whereas in the right panels we compare the ctual error for the cases: ideal data and SKA thermal noise. Again he actual errors are measured in log 10 for all the parameters except or \u03b1 and E min .\nTable 3 shows the corresponding median of the actual error for ach fold from the 5-fold cross-validation for the cases: ideal data set, ock SKA data set, and SKA thermal noise. We also calculate the ean (of the median) o v er all the 5-folds for all cases. In the theoretcal case of no observational limitations (\u2018ideal data set\u2019), the emulaion errors still allow the parameters V C and \u03c4 to be reconstructed with typical accuracy of 2.3 per cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively, and f o within 4.5 per cent. The ionizing mean free path ( R mfp ) is typically ncertain by a factor of 1.16, and f X by a factor of 1.78. For the linear arameters, the actual error is typically \u00b10.19 in \u03b1 and \u00b10.20 keV in min . One might worry that the dimensionality reduction using PCA n the data set likely introduces some correlations in the resulting ower spectrum predictions (see Fig. 2 ) o v er the various z and k - ins. In testing the sensitivity to the number of PCA components sed to train the emulator, we focus on our main results. Specifically, or the case of the ideal data set we tried doubling the number of CA components used throughout the analysis. We found that the tandard deviation ( \u03c3 ) and mean ( \u03bc) of the best-fitting Gaussian of he astrophysical parameters were as follows: f : ( \u03c3 = 0.67, \u03bc = .00), V C : ( \u03c3 = 0.60, \u03bc = 0.03), f X : ( \u03c3 = 0.94, \u03bc = \u22120.24), \u03b1: \u03c3 = 1.05, \u03bc = \u22120.03), E min : ( \u03c3 = 0.79, \u03bc = \u22120.10), \u03c4 : ( \u03c3 = .59, \u03bc = 0.05), and R mfp : ( \u03c3 = 0.89, \u03bc = 0.02). These values are imilar (within \u223c 20 per cent or better) to the mean values shown or the ideal data set in Tables 2 and B1 . Thus, the main goal of this ork, which is to constrain seven-parameter astrophysical models nd obtain their uncertainties from the mock 21-cm power spectrum, s not very sensitive to the details of the PCA reduction; we leave for he future further analysis of correlations in the reconstructed power pectrum.\nThe actual error with mock SKA data and with SKA thermal noise re nearly identical, with the mock SKA case increasing the error y up to 10 per cent (but much less in most cases). The errors are ubstantially larger compared to the ideal data set, with the mock KA case giving a median error of 24 per cent in V C , 2.8 per cent n \u03c4 , 34 per cent in f , factors of 1.25 in R mfp and 9.6 in f X , and rrors in the linear parameters of \u00b10.22 in \u03b1 and \u00b10.91 keV in E min . f course, currently our knowledge of most of these parameters is ncertain by large factors (orders of magnitude in some cases), so hese types of constraints would represent a remarkable advance.\n.5 Classification of the radio backgrounds\ns noted in the introduction, the possible observation of the absorpion profile of the 21-cm line centred at 78 MHz with an amplitude f \u2212500 K by the EDGES collaboration is incompatible with the tandard astrophysical prediction. One of the possible explanations or this unexpected signal is that the excess radio background above he CMB enhances the contrast between the spin temperature and he background radiation temperature. Fialkov & Barkana ( 2019 ) onsidered a uniform external radio background (not related to he astrophysical sources directly), with a synchrotron spectrum f spectral index \u03b2 = \u22122.6 and amplitude parameter A r measured\nFigure 6.

Another otential model for the excess radio background is that it comes from he high redshift radio galaxies. The effect of the inhomogeneous alactic radio background on the 21-cm signal has been explored by eis et al. ( 2020b ). They used the galactic radio background model o explain the unexpected EDGES low band signal. In our work, we se both the external and galactic radio models and train a neural etwork to try to infer the type of the radio background given the 1-cm power spectrum. For this purpose, we create a training data set f 9500 models (where there are \u223c5000 models with a galactic radio ackground and \u223c4500 models with an external radio background), ith the astrophysical parameters varying o v er the following ranges:\n= 0.01 \u2212 0.5, V C = 4.2 \u2212 60 km s \u22121 , f X = 0.0001 \u2212 1000, \u03b1 = .0 \u2212 1.5, E min = 0.1 \u2212 3.0, \u03c4 = 0.033 \u2212 0.089, R mfp = 10.0 \u2212 70.0. or the models with a galactic radio background, the normalization f the radio emissivity (measured relative to low-redshift galaxies), R , varies o v er the range f R = 0.01 \u2212 10 7 , and the range for the mplitude of the radio background, A r , for the external radio models s is 0.0001 \u2212 0.5.\nWe apply an EDGES-compatible test data set to the two trained etworks. The models that we refer to as EDGES-compatible satisfy he criteria adopted by Fialkov & Barkana ( 2019 ) as representing a ough compatibility with the 99 per cent limits of the detected signal n the EDGES low band experiment, in terms of the overall decline nd rise without regard to the precise shape of the absorption (which is uch more uncertain). The enhanced radio emission must strictly be high redshift phenomena, in order to not o v erproduce the observed adio background (Fialkov & Barkana 2019 ), so we assume a cut-off edshift, z cutoff = 15 (Reis et al. 2020b ) below which f R = 1 as for resent-day radio sources. So we only consider here redshifts from 5 to 30 (or the highest SKA redshift in the case with SKA noise). In ur training data set, we treat the radio background parameters A r or R on an equal footing and add an extra column of a binary parameter hat specify the type of radio background: 0 for the external radio ackground and 1 for the galactic radio background. In our EDGES ompatible test data set, we have 530 models and 308 models with n external and a galactic radio background, respectively. We apply his test data set to the trained NN.

The classification accuracy drops o 87.2 per cent if we use the power spectra from the mock SKA data et with excess radio background; the accuracy remains fairly high as hese EDGES-inspired models have high 21-cm power spectra that re not so strongly affected by the SKA thermal noise. .6 Accuracy of fitting the excess radio background models n the previous subsection we found that our NN works well to infer he type of radio background present in the 21-cm power spectrum. n order to understand cases of misclassification, we now ask whether e can fit a model with the galactic radio background with parameters f , V C , f X , \u03b1, E min , \u03c4 , R mfp , A r ) of the external radio background odel. To address this question, we train an NN that can predict the arameters in the parameter space of an external radio background iven the 21-cm power spectra with an excess radio background. e also construct an emulator and train it using the data set with he external radio background. We then employ our trained emulator n the MCMC sampler. If we apply a data set generated with a alactic background, the NN will find the approximate best-fitting arameters in the parameter space of the external radio background, nd we use this predicted set of parameters from the NN as the initial\nNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nuess in the MCMC sampler. The output of the MCMC sampler s the posterior distribution of the best-fitting parameters. We take he median of the distribution for each of the parameters and report t as the predicted best-fitting parameter value. We use these besttting parameter values in the emulator trained on the external radio ackground data set to emulate the 21-cm power spectrum (which, gain, is actually based on the galactic radio background model). The eft panel of the Fig. 8 shows a few random examples of the quality f fitting the galactic models with an external radio background. In he plot, the solid line is the true power spectrum with the galactic adio background, the dashed line is the best-fitting emulated power pectrum using the correct emulator (galactic) and the dotted line is he best-fitting emulated power spectrum using the other emulator external). The right panel of Fig. 8 shows a few examples of a similar etup except that the roles of the two types of radio models have been eversed.\nTo test the o v erall, statistical performance of the emulators in tting power spectra with different radio backgrounds, we estimate\nhe relative error using the equation\nrror =\n\u221a Mean [ ( 2 predicted \u2212 2 true )2 ]\nMax [ 2 true ] . (18)\ns explained before, this yields a simple, optimistic estimate of the v erall error in a simple number. It suffices here for our interest in omparing various cases, as follows:\nCase A: We have a test data set of 200 models with an external adio background. We fit the power spectra of the test data set using he emulator trained with power spectra with the external radio ackground (i.e. the correct model in this case). The top left panel f Fig. 9 shows the histogram of errors in the fitting procedure. If e compare the true and predicted power spectra, 98.5 per cent f the cases in the test data set give a relative error less than .04. Case B: We fit the power spectra of the same test data set as in case but using the wrong emulator, trained with power spectra with a alactic radio background. The top right panel of Fig. 9 shows the istogram of errors in the fitting procedure. In this case, we find that he relative error is still lower than 0.04 for 87 per cent of cases.\nCase C: We use a test data set of 200 models with a galactic radio ackground. We fit the power spectra of the test data set using the orrect emulator, i.e. trained using the power spectra with a galactic adio background. The histogram of errors is shown in the bottom eft panel of Fig. 9 . Here the relative error is lower than 0.04 for 8.5 per cent cases. Case D: We fit the power spectra of the same test data set as n case C but using the wrong emulator, trained with the external adio background model. The bottom right panel of Fig. 9 shows the istogram of error for this case. We find that the relative error is still ower than 0.04 in 95 per cent of cases.\nTable 4 lists the mean and the median of the relative errors in he various cases mentioned abo v e. The errors increase significantly hen the incorrect emulator is used, by factors between 1.5 and 4 n the various cases. Fig. 10 and Table 5 show similar results to ig. 9 and Table 4 , but using the mock SKA power spectrum. SKA oise increases the errors, but typically by only tens of percent, up o a factor of 1.5. This is generally reminiscent of the magnitude f the effect of SKA noise that we saw in a different context in ig. 2 .\nFigure 7. Confusion matrix depicts the performance of our classification method to distinguish the type of the radio background given the 21-cm power spectrum. Left panel: ideal data set. 62.41 per cent of the test models, i.e. 523 models out of 838 models are labelled as having the external radio background and 36.63 per cent of the test models, i.e. 307 models out of 838 models are labelled as having the galactic radio background. The number of misclassified cases is 8, i.e. eight models have been classified as having the other radio background rather than the true radio background. In this case, the o v erall accurac y is 99 per cent. Right panel: When we train the ANN using the 21-cm power spectrum from the mock SKA data set, the o v erall accurac y is 87.2 per cent, as seen in the confusion matrix.\nFigure 8.

We eveloped a numerical emulation that is a computationally efficient ethod that speeds up the data analysis by bypassing the need to un very large numbers of seminumerical simulations. We trained ur neural network o v er a wide range of possible values of the seven strophysical parameters that include the star formation efficiency, he minimum circular velocity of star-forming haloes, the X-ray adiation efficiency, the power-law slope and low energy cutoff of he X-ray SED, the CMB optical depth from reionization, and the ean free path of the ionizing photons. We constructed our algorithm\nn a way that approximately accounts for emulation error (i.e. the ncertainty due to the finite size of the training set), and also tested he accuracy (and improved the error estimates) using 5-fold crossalidation.\nAs a result we obtained an emulator that can predict the 21- m power spectrum given the set of astrophysical parameters. We nalysed the o v erall performance of the emulator by comparing, for 39 test models, the emulated power spectrum to the true power pectrum generated in the seminumerical simulation. We showed\nc\now the error varies with wavenumber and redshift, using the efinition in equation ( 16 ). We found that the typical emulation rror of the power spectrum in each bin is 10 \u2212 20 per cent o v er broad range of k and z, but it rises abo v e 20 per cent at the lowest nd highest k values (for most redshifts), and at the lowest redshift or all k values (i.e. at z = 6, near the end of reionization). SKA oise reduces the accuracy of the reconstruction of the astrophysical arameters but not by too much, increasing the typical errors by a airly uniform factor of \u223c1.5.\nIn order to find constraints on the astrophysical parameters, we mployed the emulator to an MCMC sampler to fit parameters to a i ven 21-cm po wer spectrum. We quantified the error in predicting he parameters using equation ( 17 ). We found that the standard eviations ( \u03c3 ) for most of the seven parameters (Figs 5 and B1 ) ere within 20 per cent of our error estimate. Also, the mean which measures the bias) was small in every parameter for the deal data set, and the distribution was fairly well described by a aussian. The mock SKA data set or SKA thermal noise case gave early identical results to each other; the noisy data made the bias s large as \u223c1.4 \u03c3 for some of the parameters, and added significant kewness in some cases. Table 2 (along with Table B1 ) listed the orresponding parameters of best-fitting Gaussians for each of the\nMNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nM\nFigure 9.

In igs 6 and B2 , we showed the histograms of the size of the actual rror in predicting each of the parameters, with the medians listed n Table 3 . We measured the parameters and uncertainties in log cale (log 10 ) for all the parameters except for \u03b1 and E min . In the ase of the ideal data set, we found that the emulation errors still llow the parameters V c and \u03c4 to be reconstructed with a typical ccuracy of 2.3 per cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively, and f to ithin 4.5 per cent. The ionizing mean free path ( R mfp ) is typically ncertain by a factor of 1.16, and f X by a factor of 1.78. For the linear arameters, the uncertainty is typically \u00b10.19 in \u03b1 and \u00b10.20 in min .\nNRAS 527, 9977\u20139998 (2024)\nNoisy SKA data only marginally affected the uncertainty in \u03b1, ndicating the importance of the emulation error and also the o v erall ack of sensitivity of the power spectrum to this parameter. However, KA noise increased the errors to 24 per cent in V C , 2.8 per cent in \u03c4 , nd 34 per cent in f . The uncertainty factor increased mildly (to 1.25) n R mfp but greatly (to 9.6) in f X , and also in E min (to \u00b10.91 keV). urrently we have almost no observational information about the alues of most of the astrophysical parameters we used in this work, xcept for the optical depth ( \u03c4 ) of the CMB photons. The detection f the polarized CMB signal by WMAP (Spergel et al. 2003 ) and lanck (Planck Collaboration VI 2020 ) has provided constraints on he optical depth, but their precision is limited by the cosmic variance f the large-angle polarization effect on the CMB. We have shown hat 21-cm power spectrum observations can potentially produce a recise measurement of this and other astrophysical parameters. Of ourse we have used a relatively simple astrophysical model here. If uch precise measurements are indeed achiev ed, the y will motivate omparisons with more complicated models where, for example, the arious ef ficiencies (for star formation, X-rays, and ionizing photons) epend on redshift, halo mass, and perhaps halo environment or erger history. In another part of this work, we applied a neural network to classify he nature of the excess radio background, if it is present in the 21- m signal. We compared models with an external radio background assumed to be primordial and homogeneous) to a galactic radio\nFigure 10. Same as Fig. 9 , except using mock SKA data set. In each case we use the best-fitting parameters derived from NN\u2019s trained using mock SKA data, but for the error we measure the prediction of the clean power spectrum, i.e. we apply the emulators (both external and galactic) trained using ideal data set to emulate the best-fitting 21-cm power spectrum, and compare this to the true clean power spectrum.\nTable 5. Same as Table 4 , but here we use the 21-cm power spectra from the mock SKA data set.

The ccuracy of the classification was 99 per cent for the 21-cm power pectrum without SKA noise (ideal data set), going down to a still igh accuracy of 87 per cent if we use the 21-cm power spectrum rom the mock SKA data set. When fitting data with either the orrect emulator or the one from the other type of radio background, e found that the fits were in all cases rather accurate (Table 4 ). o we ver, the errors increased significantly when the incorrect mulator was used, by factors between 1.5 and 4 in the various ases in the case without SKA noise. Adding SKA noise increased he errors, but typically by only tens of percent, up to a factor of 1.5 Table 5 ).\nIn summary, emulating and fitting the 21-cm power spectrum using NNs is a rapid and accurate method. One of the potential extensions\nf this work will be to impro v e the accuracy of the emulator, e.g. by rying to change various parameters such as the number of layers of he NN. Another possible impro v ement is to use the current procedure s the first step of a fit, and then zoom in on a smaller region of the arameter space in order to achieve higher accuracy (noting that e hav e co v ered a far wider range of astrophysical parameters than ost similar work in the literature). A further direction is to make the strophysical model more realistic by adding a significant number of arameters, and seeing whether the computational speed and fitting ccuracy are maintained. NN\u2019s will clearly remain valuable in this eld, given the highly non-linear dependence of the 21-cm power pectrum on astrophysical parameters, the wide range of possible alues for these parameters, and the relative slowness of realistic imulations, even seminumerical ones.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhis project was made possible for SS, RB, and IR through the upport of the Israel Science Foundation (grant No. 2359/20).
