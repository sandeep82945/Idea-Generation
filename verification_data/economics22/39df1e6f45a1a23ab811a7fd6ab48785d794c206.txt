The portions of the text mentioning future research directions are as follows:

1. "The policy implications of this study imply the necessity for national legislators to create political and economic environments that enable and facilitate investments in environmental protection and sustainability. Creating laws and regulations must be in accordance with tangible objectives, therefore allowing the tourism industry to flourish and become more sustainable, and also to become a factor of prosperity for local communities."

2. "Since traveling is a proven means through which exposure to nature reduces stress, and increases positive emotions, well-being and nervous balance, policies should favor increased mobility and the development of national parks and protected areas, together with the increase in green spaces (parks and vegetation), even in highly congested regions."

3. "Happiness and well-being are natural outcomes that favor productivity, travel and expenditure for increasing health, thus creating and sustaining an economic environment that supports local communities and a better understanding of the values that keep human beings in healthy relationships, both regionally and globally."

4. "In the present study, we encountered a number of limitations, specifically those related to obtaining a more comprehensive data set, in terms of the time period, that was large enough to be significant. Thus, considering the analyzed variables, the time period considered was reduced to 20 years."

These excerpts suggest areas for future research and policy development, focusing on the creation of supportive political and economic environments, the development of green spaces and national parks, the exploration of happiness and well-being's impact on productivity and travel, and the need for more comprehensive data sets for analysis.
