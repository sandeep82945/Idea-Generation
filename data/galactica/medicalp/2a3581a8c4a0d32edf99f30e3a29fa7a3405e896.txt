conclusions The results of this study show that the reactivity pattern of BinaxNOW® malaria test (HPR-2/aldolase) and SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f/Pan (HPR-2/pLDH) allows a rapid semi-quantitative assessment of P. falciparum parasitaemia in travellers with imported malaria, particularly to point-out patients with lower parasite loads. The presence of HRP-2 reactivity in the absence of LDH or aldolase was a reliable predictive marker to detect parasitaemias < 1% with a 100% PPV. On the contrary, neither haematological parameters, nor NLC or MLC ratios, nor the multivariate predictive models developed, were able to estimate parasitaemia with sufficient precision. This findings may be relevant and useful when treating patients suspected of having imported malaria in the acute care setting, especially in those centres where microscopic diagnosis is not readily available or where expertise in managing malaria is lacking.
