 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Study the scaling laws of dynamical non-Markovianity with larger numbers of qubits. The paper showed a power law dependence up to 8 qubits, but exploring larger qubit systems could reveal new scaling behaviors. 

2. Investigate inhomogeneous Tavis-Cummings models, where the qubits have different frequencies and couplings. This could allow more precise engineering of the non-Markovian dynamics.

3. Explore using dynamical non-Markovianity for quantum metrology applications like enhancing measurement precision. The information backflow could potentially improve sensitivity.

4. Analyze the effects of higher excitation numbers and photon nonlinearities on the induced non-Markovian dynamics. The paper focused on single excitations, but allowing more excitations may demonstrate new phenomena.

5. Implement and test the proposals experimentally in superconducting circuits or trapped ions. This could validate the theoretical models and provide a platform for applications in quantum information and neuromorphic computing.
