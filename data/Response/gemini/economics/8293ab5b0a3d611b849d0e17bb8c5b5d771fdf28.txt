1. **Investigate the relationship between privacy preferences and other individual characteristics.** For example, do people with higher levels of education or income have different privacy preferences than those with lower levels of education or income? Do people who are more concerned about their online security have different privacy preferences than those who are less concerned about their online security?
2. **Explore how privacy preferences change over time.** For example, do people's privacy preferences change as they age? Do people's privacy preferences change as they become more familiar with new technologies?
3. **Examine the impact of different data sharing contexts on privacy preferences.** For example, do people have different privacy preferences when they are sharing data with a government agency than when they are sharing data with a private company? Do people have different privacy preferences when they are sharing data for a specific purpose than when they are sharing data for a general purpose?
4. **Investigate the relationship between privacy preferences and actual privacy behavior.** For example, do people who have strong privacy preferences actually take steps to protect their privacy online? Do people who have weak privacy preferences actually share their personal data more freely online?
5. **Develop and test interventions to help people make more informed decisions about their privacy.** For example, could educational campaigns help people to understand the risks and benefits of sharing their personal data online? Could privacy-enhancing technologies help people to protect their privacy online without sacrificing convenience?
