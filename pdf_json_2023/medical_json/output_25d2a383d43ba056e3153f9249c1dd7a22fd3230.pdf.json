    "abstractText": "Objectives: To explore the predictive value of C-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin (ALB) ratio (CAR) for the risk of 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia. Methods: A total of 152 patients with severe pneumonia treated from January 2020 to January 2022were enrolled and assigned into survival group (n=107) and death group (n=45) according to their survival status after treatment for 28 d. Their clinical data were compared, and the influencing factors for 28-day mortality were explored by multiple logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to assess the value of CAR for predicting 28-day mortality risk. A risk prediction model was constructed, and its prediction efficiency was evaluated. Results: The death group had significantly older age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Murray Lung Injury Score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, red cell volume distribution width, neutrophilto-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), fibrinogen, procalcitonin, blood lactic acid (Lac), CRP and CAR and significantly lower oxygenation index and ALB than those of the survival group (p<0.05). APACHE II score, NLR, Lac and CAR were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality (p<0.05). AUC of the established prediction model was 0.826, with sensitivity of 88.45 % and specificity of 87.32 %, indicating high discrimination. The nomogram model had clinical value when the risk threshold probability was 11\u201393 %. Conclusions: CAR is an independent risk factor that shows a high predictive value for the 28-daymortality risk in patients with severe pneumonia.",

            "text": "Pneumonia refers to lung inflammation induced by bacteria, viruses, etc. [1], whose severity is decided by the degree of local inflammation, the dispersal of lung inflammation and the severity of systemic inflammatory response [2]. Patients showing symptoms of severe hypoxemia and acute respiratory failure, signs of circulatory failure (such as shock) or dysfunction of other organs can be diagnosed with severe pneumonia [3]. Characterized by fast onset, rapid progression and multiple complications [4], severe pneumonia contributes to 40 % of the total number of deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU) [5], becoming one of the primary causes of death in the ICU [6], severely threatening the lives and health of patients. Hence, accurately assessing the prognosis of patients with severe pneumonia and taking intervention measures to cut the mortality rate is of important significance. C-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin (ALB) ratio (CAR), a new index to assess inflammation [7\u20139], can be adopted to evaluate the severity and prognosis of multiple diseases such as respiratory tract infection, acute coronary syndrome and cerebral infarction. Nevertheless, whether CAR can serve as a prognostic index for severe pneumonia remains unclarified. In this study, therefore, 152 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled to evaluate the predictive value of CAR for the 28-day mortality risk in patients with severe pneumonia, aiming to provide references for prognosis evaluation in clinical practice."

Those complicated with malignancies, severe blood diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis or asthma were excluded. Based on the survival status of patients after 28 days of treatment, the subjects were divided into survival group (n=107) and death group (n=45). All subjects and their families were informed of the study and signed the informed consent.\nThe Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score of the patientswas recorded on thefirst day of admission. The total score was 71 points, and the higher the score, the severer the condition. Besides, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) was conducted, which consisted of 6 items, with a total score of 0\u201324 points, and the higher the score, the severer the condition. In addition, the Murray Lung Injury Score (MLIS) was recorded, which included chest X-ray findings, hypoxemia score, positive end-expiratory pressure and compliance, and the higher the score, the severer the lung injury.\nWithin 24 h after admission, 5 mL of peripheral blood sample was collected from each subject for detection of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), neutrophil granulocyte percentage (GR), lymphocyte count (LYM), red cell volume distribution width (RDW), blood platelet count (PLT), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fibrinogen (FIB), procalcitonin (PCT), blood lactic acid (Lac), oxygenation index (OI), CRP, ALB and CAR.\nSPSS 23.0 software was utilized for statistical analysis. The measurement datawere expressed asmean\u00b1 standard deviation (X \u00b1 s), and compared between groups by the t-test. The count data were expressed as percentage (%), and compared between groups by the \u03c72 test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors for 28-day mortality, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the predictive value of each index. Internal validation was performed using the self-sampling method (Bootstrap). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the discrimination of each index and the model. Calibration curve was plotted to assess the consistency of the nomogram model. R (R3.5.3) software and rms package were used to plot nomogram and correlation analysis figure. Decision curve analysis was conducted to review the net benefit at various threshold probabilities to determine the clinical utility of the nomogrammodel. p-value<0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference."

            "text": "At present, infectious diseases have emerged as one of the major contributors to death, and the mortality rate of severe pneumonia ranks No.1 among all types of pneumonia [11]. Although the guidelines for the treatment of severe pneumonia have been constantly updated in recent years, its morbidity and mortality rates remain high, seriously threatening people\u2019s lives [12]. Hence, probing into the factors affecting the prognosis of patients with severe pneumonia is of great importance for evaluating the prognosis of\nTable : Predictive value for mortality risk in patients.\nIndex AUC % CI Optimal cutoff value Sensitivity Specificity\nAPACHE II score . .\u2013. . .% .% NLR . .\u2013. . .% .% Lac . .\u2013. . .% .% CAR . .\u2013. . .% .%\npatients. APACHE II score serves as an important scoring index to assess the prognosis of patients with inflammation and sepsis [13]. Nevertheless, due to cumbersome calculation, its clinical application is inconvenient. According to a study [14], many indices such as WBC, PCT, OI and MLIS can be adopted to assess the severity and prognosis of severe pneumonia. However, there are still controversies over these indices and they possess low value for predicting the prognosis of the disease [15]. Hence, it is of great importance to probe into ideal biomarkers with superior sensitivity and specificity for prognostic evaluation of severe pneumonia. Inflammatory response occurs throughout the development of severe pneumonia. CAR, as a new marker of systemic inflammation, exhibits prognostic value for many diseases such as gastric cancer, acute coronary syndrome and respiratory failure. CAR is known as the combination of CRP and ALB, and can reflect the balance between the two. The value of CAR relies on the variation of CRP and ALB\nlevels [16]. CRP, an acute phase reactive protein synthesized by hepatocytes, is largely present in the serum of patients with acute inflammation. A previous study has revealed that [17] CRP levels will rise to varying degrees during the progression of severe pneumonia, so dynamic monitoring of serum CRP levels is significantly important for judging the prognosis of severe pneumonia. ALB, as the most essential protein in human plasma, exerts important physiological functions in human bodies [18]. It has been uncovered that the joint use of ALB with treatment in patients with severe pneumonia can cut the fatality rate, suggesting a close relationship between serum ALB level and the prognosis of patients with severe pneumonia [19]. Considering the correlations of CRP and ALB with severe pneumonia, it was speculated that CRP is also associated with the prognosis of\nsevere pneumonia. In this study, death group had a significantly higher CRP level and a significantly lower ALB level than survival group. Meanwhile, CAR was significantly higher in death group than that in survival group. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CAR was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia, whereas CRP and ALB were not independent risk factors in the analysis. The above findings suggest that CAR (the combination of CRP and ALB) has a higher value for predicting the prognosis of severe pneumonia. The AUC of CAR for predicting the 28-daymortality in patients with severe pneumonia was 0.768, indicating a high predictive value. In addition, the calculation of CAR was relatively simple and costs less, so CAR can serve as an ideal marker for predicting the prognosis of severe pneumonia.\nIn addition, multiple logistic regression analysis results indicated that APACHE II score, Lac, and NLR were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in patients with severe pneumonia. The level of Lac is mainly decided by the synthesis rate and metabolic rate of the liver and kidney. In some pathological conditions, lactic acid in vivo can rise due to tissue hypoxia [20]. Hence, determination of Lac level can reflect the severity of underlying diseases as well as the prognosis. NLR refers to NEU-to-LYM ratio, which can indicate the severity of inflammatory response in patients promptly [21]. Correlation analysis results suggested that Lac, NLR and APACHE II score of patients with severe pneumonia were significantly positively correlated with CAR, further illustrating the close association between CAR and the prognosis of severe pneumonia. Moreover, a certain synergistic effect was observed among Lac level, NLR and CAR in patients with severe pneumonia. To figure out the mechanism, it was speculated that the CRP level was increased in patients with severe pneumonia due to inflammatory response during the disease progression [22],\nleading to insufficient ALB synthesis and elevated CAR. As a result, lung tissue hypoxia is induced, which leads to lung injury and an increased Lac level. As the disease deteriorates, the inflammatory response is aggravated, activating neutrophils, and thereby raising NLR. At this time, all clinical indices of the patients are changed, eventually influencing the APACHE II score. In addition, on the basis of the above risk factors, a nomogram prediction model was constructed in this study, which displayed good discrimination and accuracy, and could provide references for clinical evaluation of the prognosis of patients with severe pneumonia.\nRegardless, this study still has limitations. This is a single-center study with a small sample size, and we did not perform pathogen analysis, so some results may be biased. In the future, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes will be carried out to verify the results of this study."
