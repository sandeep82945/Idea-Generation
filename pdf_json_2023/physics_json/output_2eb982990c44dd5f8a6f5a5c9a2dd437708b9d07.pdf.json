For these reasons, we also considered different local compositions of both terminations in triLHP (Fig. S2, ESI\u2020): AX terminations exposing or not the Cs atom (CsFAMAX and FAMAX in the text, respectively), plus an additional CsFAMAX layer with a maximized interaction of Cs with the most active methoxy groups of spiro-MeOTAD,12,13 CsFAMAX(O\u2013Cs). Similarly, we considered two PbX2-terminated surfaces, lacking or containing a Cs atom at the subsurface layer, PbX2 and PbX2(Cs), respectively. The minimum-energy structures of all these interfaces are shown in Fig. 1a. The most stable interfaces have been determined in terms of binding energies (Eb) between the LHP and spiro-MeOTAD moieties computed as Eb = ELHP/Spiro ELHP ESpiro, where ELHP/Spiro, ELHP and ESpiro are the electronic energies of the fully relaxed interfaces, isolated LHP surfaces, and isolated spiro-MeOTAD molecule, respectively. Total Eb values have been further decomposed into three main contributions:\nEb = Ea + E Spiro d + E LHP d = (ELHP/Spiro ELHP* ESpiro*)\n+ (ESpiro* ESpiro) + (ELHP* ELHP) (1)\nThe first contribution is the adhesion energy (Ea) and stems from the electronic interaction between the moieties and it is calculated from the LHP and spiro-MeOTAD energies at the interface geometries (ELHP* and ESpiro*).

Defined in this way, Ea is an attractive (negative) term, while distortion energies are positive quantities that partially compensate Ea to deliver the final Eb. This analysis is displayed in Fig. 1b, while the corresponding numerical values are listed in Table S1 (ESI\u2020).\nOur results reveal an opposite affinity of the spiro-MeOTAD molecule for either termination depending on LHP composition: while adsorption on the MAI surface is preferred for MAPI, PbX2 is preferred for triLHP. Moreover, Cs appears to have a stabilizing effect in the MA terminated triLHP when linked to the methoxy group of spiro-MeOTAD: FAMAX and CsFAMAX(O\u2013Cs) deliver similar Eb, with binding in CsFAMAX being less convenient.\nRegarding PbX2 termination in LHP, the presence of Cs in the subsurface layer reinforces the PbX2(Cs)/spiro-MeOTAD binding with respect to PbX2/spiro-MeOTAD by B1 eV, making the PbX2(Cs)/spiro-MeOTAD the most stable interface among all explored interfaces (B 4.5 eV). The binding energy trends reflect both the structural and electronic features of the interface. On one hand, more negative binding energies correspond to the closest molecule/surface distances, as discussed in the ESI\u2020\n(Fig. S3 and Table S1). On the other hand, the dominant term in Eb is the adhesion energy, which suggests a mostly electronic interaction, with low distortion energies for both components, especially for the surface, with a low conformational freedom involving only cations of the topmost layer (Fig. S4, ESI\u2020). A more in-depth structural analysis of structural rearrangements on spiroMeOTAD is reported in Fig. S5 (ESI\u2020). At all LHP interfaces, the angles of the main fluorene moiety and the -methoxyphenyl residues vary by 21 and 41, respectively, compared to the free spiro-MeOTAD molecule. These structural variations occur with an elongation of the methoxy CH3\u2013O bond of B0.02/0.03 \u00c5 at the most stable triLHP(PbX2(Cs))/spiro-MeOTAD interface. The electronic nature of the LHP/spiro-MeOTAD interaction is depicted by the charge density difference plots (Fig. 1a). Most of the charge rearrangement at the interface involves the fluorene ring and the methoxy groups of spiro-MeOTAD, which interact predominantly with the A cation and with the Pb atoms of AX and PbX2 terminations, in agreement with previous investigations.12,13 This analysis points out also a direct role of the Cs atom in stabilizing the interaction with spiro-MeOTAD. In the CsFAMAX(O\u2013Cs) system, the increased charge density along the methoxy O\u2013Cs bond and the O\u2013Cs distance (B3.25 \u00c5) suggests the formation of direct bonding.14 Also the strongest binding in the PbX2(Cs) system is accompanied by a pronounced charge rearrangement involving the whole interface.\nOn these interfaces, we computed the atom-projected density of states (pDOS; see Fig. S6, ESI\u2020) to obtain a first qualitative indication of frontier orbital energetics and the thermodynamic feasibility of CT. In all the cases, the spiro-MeOTAD highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) lies at higher energy than the LHP valence band maximum (VBM), providing a convenient driving force for hole injection. The energy difference between the donor and the acceptor band edges is the largest for the PbX2 terminations of both LHPs, suggesting a more effective transfer process than that in AX ones, as also pointed out by Wang et al.15 Nevertheless, a driving force of B0.2 eV or higher is sufficient for efficient CT, so all the considered interfaces are in principle suitable.16 The pDOS plots also indicate the presence of several HOMO X (X = 1, 2, 3. . .) states, lying at higher energies than the LHP VBM, which can behave as additional CT channels. Motivated by this finding, we calculated the donor\u2013acceptor coupling matrix elements for transitions occurring between both the HOMO and HOMO 1 molecular orbitals (MOs) of spiroMeOTAD and the LHP VBM. Since the hole transfer process from the LHP VBM to the spiro-MeOTAD HOMO is conceptually equivalent to an electron transfer in the opposite direction, we consider spiro-MeOTAD as the electron donor, while the LHP acts as the acceptor. We calculated the spectral function Gd(E) from electronic couplings:\nGd E\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2p X\na\nVadj j2d\u00f0E ea\u00de (2)\nwhere Vad is the electronic coupling matrix element between the diabatic donor d state and the acceptor a state of the perovskite valence band, with energy ea. This function can be regarded as an estimate of the donor state decay width and provides information on the CT process timescale. In particular, the time for hole\nFig. 1 (a) Lateral views of the relaxed LHP/spiro-MeOTAD (LHP = MAPI or triLHP) interfaces with AX- and PbX2-type terminations showing electron density difference isosurfaces upon interface formation.

Coupling elements |Vad| and spectral functions G for both the spiro-MeOTAD HOMO and HOMO 1 and LHP AX- and PbX2-type surfaces are depicted in Fig. 2 (left panels). For the AX interfaces of both MAPI and triLHP, couplings are higher and the spectral function presents a more structured character in the low energy region (between 9 and 6 eV). The involvement of such deep states is consistent with recent experimental findings by Droseros et al. on different HTM/MAPI interfaces.17 They observed an ultrafast charge injection at the tris(4-carbazoyl-9ylphenyl)amine/MAPI interface in spite of a negative HOMO/VBM offset. This suggests that the hole injection takes place from perovskite states that lie deep in the VB, thus fulfilling the thermodynamic requirement. Concerning spiro-MeOTAD MOs, the highest coupling occurs when HOMO 1 is involved for most AX surfaces (MAPI-MAI, triLHP-FAMAX and triLHP-CsFAMAX(O\u2013Cs), being triLHP-CsFAMAX an exception, with the highest couplings with the spiro-MeOTAD HOMO within the same energy range. Regarding the PbX2-type terminations, MAPI-PbI2 and triLHP-PbX2(Cs) present the best couplings with spiro-MeOTAD HOMO 1 MO, while only triLHP-PbX2 couples more efficiently with the spiro-MeOTAD HOMO. For this termination, hole injection is more likely to occur in the 2 to 4 eV energy region rather than through deep VB states ( 9 eV o Ea EF o 6 eV).\nThe actual LHP states involved in the CT process can be extracted from the atom-projected pDOS, as shown in Fig. 2\n(right panels). The low energy region with the highest couplings at AX-interfaces is composed of spiro-MeOTAD oxygen p states and MA/FA cations. While in CsFAMAX Cs states are not present in the 6 to 9 eV region, such states appear in CsFAMAX-OCs, where couplings are much higher. All pDOS for PbX2 derived interfaces feature mixed Pb and halide states interacting with spiro-MeOTAD oxygen p states in the 2 to 4 eV region. Also in this case, Cs states correlated to higher couplings appear for triLHP-PbX2(Cs). To gain insight on the nature of donor states and clarify the differences between HOMO and HOMO 1 in terms of couplings, we show interfacial spiro-MeOTAD MOs and the corresponding energies in Fig. 3. For comparison, the same orbitals for isolated spiroMeOTAD are plotted in Fig. S7 (ESI\u2020).\nAs suggested in other works,18 our calculations predict a surface-induced light-to-moderate degeneracy loss between HOMO and HOMO 1 (separated by only 0.04 eV in the isolated molecule) for interfacial spiro-MeOTAD with energy differences from 0.08 to 0.37 eV. As shown in Fig. 3, either the HOMO 1 or HOMO orbital points to the surface, while the other MO points to the vacuum region. For all surfaces explored, the highest couplings occur through such MO oriented towards the surface, i.e. HOMO 1 for MAPI-MAI and PbI2, triLHP-FAMAX and PbX2(Cs) and HOMO for triLHP-PbX2. An exception, and apparent contradiction, occurs for triLHP-CsFAMAX and CsFAMAX(O\u2013Cs) cases, where more advantageous couplings occur through HOMO and HOMO 1 MOs, respectively, which are not spatially located towards the perovskite surface. Still, a closer look at these MOs (Fig. S8, ESI\u2020) can explain this finding: they comprise the methoxy group directly linked to the Cs-rich surface at 2.43 \u00c5 and 3.25 \u00c5 for\nFig. 2 Left panels: coupling matrix elements |Vad| between the spiroMeOTAD HOMO and HOMO 1 donor states and LHP VB acceptor states and spectral function G(E) calculated according to eqn (2) for (a) AX-type and (b) PbX2-type interfaces.

Particularly for the CsFAMAX(O\u2013Cs)/HOMO 1 case, strong couplings in the 6 to 9 eV region that also involve Cs states suggest that Cs acts as a direct hole transfer booster.\nThe computed hole injection times, corresponding to the coupling between the LHP and spiro-MeOTAD states described above and extracted from G(E), are reported in Table 1. All the obtained values are of the order of picoseconds (ps), in agreement with other experimental works,19\u201322 with triLHP presenting the fastest injections, in particular for the FAMAX/spiroMeOTAD (HOMO 1) (1.65 ps), CsFAMAX(O\u2013Cs)/spiro-MeOTAD (HOMO 1) (2.50 ps) and PbX2(Cs)/spiro-MeOTAD (HOMO 1) (2.68 ps) interfaces. These results show that (i) triLHP is always more efficient for CT than MAPI; (ii) MAPI is only efficient at the MAI termination (1.80 ps versus 4.93 ps at the PbI2 one); and (iii) Cs acts as an additional CT booster not only when directly linked to spiro-MeOTAD, but also when it is present as subsurface species.\nIn conclusion, our DFT study addresses the interfaces of the spiro-MeOTAD HTM with the well-studied MAPI and with the much less explored triple cation LHP formulation, providing new insights on the chemical features leading to favorable binding and enhanced CT. In agreement with the recent literature, electronic interactions are crucial for interface stability, with FA and Cs atoms strengthening the binding to spiro-MeOTAD methoxy groups. Regarding CT, we find a thermodynamically favourable scenario for all interfaces, PbX2 terminations presenting the highest driving force. Being close in energy and well above the LHP VBM, we include both the HOMO and HOMO 1 orbitals of spiro-MeOTAD in computing couplings and injection times. Cross-analysis of coupling matrix elements and pDOS shows the specific LHP states acting as CT channels, while analysis of MOs highlights the correlation between the best couplings and orbital localization towards the LHP surface. Our estimates of injection times predict that the CT occurs on the ps timescale, in agreement with experimental works. The donor state is the spiro-MeOTAD HOMO 1 orbital in most cases, which injects the electron to states in the deep LHP VB region or at higher energy for MAX and PbX2 terminations, respectively. Interestingly, our results also highlight a new role for the Cs cation at the triLHP surface: besides its beneficial effects on the structural stability of LHP, Cs offers a convenient anchoring point to the HTM molecule and\nprovides effective CT channels for hole transport. Overall, our analysis offers a novel atomic-scale perspective for a comprehensive rationalization of CT mechanisms and times for some among the most representative systems of current state-of-the-art PSCs, paving the route to further investigation on the effects of dopants, defects or buffer interlayers on key processes as interfacial CT.\nThis work was supported by the Italian MISE-ENEA Research Agreement on the Electric System, ENEA-CRESCO for computing facilities, and PON R&I 2014\u20132020-Asse IV \u2018\u2018Istruzione e ricerca per il recupero-REACT-EU\u2019\u2019."
