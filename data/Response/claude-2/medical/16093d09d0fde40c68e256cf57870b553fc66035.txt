 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Investigate the efficacy and safety of the PPR vaccine in other goat breeds found in Europe to determine if the immune response varies across breeds. 

2. Conduct challenge studies in vaccinated goats after 1, 2 and 3 years post-vaccination to determine the duration of immunity conferred by the vaccine.

3. Explore novel vaccine delivery methods, such as intranasal or intradermal, to potentially improve the immune response elicited by the current subcutaneous vaccine. 

4. Analyze the transcriptomic or proteomic profile of PBMCs from high and low/non-responders to the vaccine to uncover mechanisms influencing vaccine efficacy.

5. Test new PPR vaccine candidates, such as recombinant subunit, vectored or nucleic acid-based vaccines, and compare their performance to the current live-attenuated vaccine.
