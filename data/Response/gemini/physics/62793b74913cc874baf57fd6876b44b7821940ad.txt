1. **Investigate the effect of different magnetic field strengths on the adsorption efficiency of the magnetogel.** The current study used a magnetic field strength of 1.42–1.47 T. It would be interesting to investigate how the adsorption efficiency of the magnetogel changes with different magnetic field strengths. This could help to optimize the magnetic field strength for the removal of specific pollutants.


2. **Explore the use of different types of magnetic nanoparticles in the magnetogel.** The current study used γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. However, other types of magnetic nanoparticles, such as magnetite (Fe3O4) or cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), could also be used. It would be interesting to investigate how the type of magnetic nanoparticle affects the adsorption efficiency of the magnetogel.


3. **Study the effect of different hydrogel compositions on the adsorption efficiency of the magnetogel.** The current study used a hydrogel composed of Fmoc-Phe and diphenylalanine. However, other types of hydrogels, such as polyacrylamide or chitosan, could also be used. It would be interesting to investigate how the composition of the hydrogel affects the adsorption efficiency of the magnetogel.


4. **Investigate the reusability of the magnetogel.** The current study did not investigate the reusability of the magnetogel. It would be important to investigate how many times the magnetogel can be reused without losing its adsorption efficiency. This would be important for the practical application of the magnetogel.


5. **Explore the use of the magnetogel for the removal of other pollutants.** The current study investigated the use of the magnetogel for the removal of Co(II), Ni(II), and Cr(III). However, the magnetogel could also be used for the removal of other pollutants, such as heavy metals, dyes, and organic pollutants. It would be interesting to investigate the effectiveness of the magnetogel for the removal of these other pollutants.
