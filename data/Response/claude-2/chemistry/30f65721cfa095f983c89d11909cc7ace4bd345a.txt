 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Isolate and identify the specific phytochemicals in C. gileadensis responsible for the observed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. Further explore their mechanisms of action.

2. Conduct in vivo studies in animal models to evaluate the efficacy and safety of C. gileadensis extracts for treating inflammatory conditions like arthritis.

3. Explore the potential of C. gileadensis extracts as natural preservatives in food and cosmetics due to their antimicrobial properties.

4. Investigate the effects of different extraction methods on the phytochemical profile and bioactivity of C. gileadensis extracts. Optimize extraction protocols.  

5. Formulate and characterize novel drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles, to enhance the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of the bioactive phytochemicals from C. gileadensis.
