    "abstractText": "This study investigated the factors influencing science teachers\u2019 \u2019Artificial Intelligence\u2019 (AI) utilization by using the \u2019Technology Acceptance Model\u2019 (TAM). The factors inves\u2010 tigated alongside TAM variables were teachers\u2019 data like; age, sex, and residence type. TAM items that were correlated in this study included; self\u2010esteem, stress and anxiousness, ease of utilization, behavioural intention, attitude towards AI usage, and expected benefits. The population of this study comprised all science teachers (170) in the Calabar Education Zone of Cross River State, Nigeria. The sample was made up of 79 science teachers comprising (58.22%) 46 females and (41.77%) 33 males. The descriptive and analytical research design was used in this study. A questionnaire named \u2019 Approval of Artificial Intelligence: The Teachers\u2019 Eye\u2019 Questionnaire (AAITEQ) was used for the study. This study raised 3 research questions. The reliability for AAITEQ was from 0.72 to 0.81 using Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Findings indicated that the approval for the utilization of AI was high with an overall mean score of 3.00. The highest predicting value for behaviour intent using TAM variables was the ease of usage r = .789. Science teachers\u2019 sex (t, 77 = 1.988; p = .060, (p \u02c3 .05), age F (2, 76) = .547; p = .581 (p \u02c3 .05) and teachers\u2019 residence location (t, .77 = .533; p = \u2212 .062 (p \u02c3 .05) did not influ\u2010 ence the behaviour of science teachers\u2019 intention of the utilization of AI. It was recom\u2010 mended that both in\u2010service and pre\u2010service teachers be trained on the utilization of AI.",

In today\u2019s world, AI has access to every facet of Man\u2019s world. This ranges from individualized healthcare, security, shopping online, smart homes, and a host of others. As a result of the complexity of AI and the changes it has undergone, there is no clear-cut definition that will be all-inclusive incorporating the metamorphosis that\nit has undergone from the 1980s to date (Luckin et\u00a0al., 2016). The majority of the definitions of AI integrate two elements as the cardinal point: (i) thinking that is like humans, and (ii) rational actions (Russell & Norvig, 2009). Primarily, the name given to machines or computers that mimic man\u2019s cognitive functions like teaching and learning as well as the ability to solve problems as perfect as humans are called AI tools in education.\nIn the last decade, the world has been moving very swiftly towards the application of what is known as the fifth generation (5G) internet which is also labeled as the internet involving education. Interest in the corporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in teaching and learning is waxing very strong. The relevance of AI became very prominent when universities and schools were locked down due to the pandemic of coronavirus outbreak of 2019 (Darayseh, 2023).\nMahmoud\u2019s (2020) study reported that AI played diverse imminent roles in education. When AI is incorporated into the teaching and learning system, it creates chances for improvement in the educational section in terms of teachers\u2019 teaching and students\u2019 learning outcomes. Students learn in their space and individually by receiving personalized tutoring. Concepts that are ordinarily abstract can be presented in a form that will be understood by students, educators identify learning disabilities, and students get feedback on their progress as they progress in the study. With AI education is made global.\nWhen AI is utilized during teaching and learning, especially in the form of cobots, enhanced learning experiences of students are fostered (Chassignol et\u00a0al., 2018). Cobots have been applied to teach children tasks like spelling and pronunciation and they adjust to the student\u2019s abilities (Timms, 2016).\nPersonalized guidance, assistance, and evaluation by tailoring learning content based on student-specific learning patterns or knowledge levels are provided by AI tutoring systems (Hwang et\u00a0 al., 2020). Teaching with AI assists facilitators to save time as AI answers\u2019 students\u2019 non-complex, repeated questions via online discussion forums, and as such, teachers redirect the time saved to works of higher value (Goel & Polepeddi, 2016). The knowledge of learners\u2019 performance, progression, and potential are decoded by their clickstream data when AI is utilized in teaching and learning (Seo et\u00a0al., 2021; Holstein et\u00a0al., 2018).\nFrom the foregoing, the relevance of AI in teaching and learning via the Internet and the development that has given access to both teachers and students to acquire the information they need cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, the need to enforce the utilization of AI and apply it in the plan of the curricula, teaching methods, and evaluation to have an efficient scholarship cannot be over-emphasized (Eltabakh, 2019).\nIn as much as an immense prospect is proffered by AI in education, its comprehensive utilization in the field of science education cannot be assured that teachers will apply it during teaching and learning. It also does not surety the standard of teaching since instructors have yet to imbibe the implementation steps of AI-based instruction (Ayanwale et\u00a0al., 2022).\nAlso worthy of note is the attitudes of teachers toward the utilization of a new method of instruction. It is possible to find some teachers who will jettison a new method of teaching with the new technologies and continue teaching with the old method that they are familiar with. Teachers\u2019 restiveness toward new technologies and techniques\nmay stymie the attempt to use technology during teaching (H\u00b4ebert et\u00a0al., 2021; Tallvid, 2016).\nThe importance of the classification of factors into relevance when sourcing alternatives to provide efficient usage of AI cannot be neglected. This research was undertaken due to the importance of adding to research seeking answers to the problems of the application of AI usage in the teaching of science via the instructors\u2019 angle."

They pointed out that, if AI was adopted, it would adequately make for an easy learning experience for the learners and make teaching on the part of teachers easy and dynamic.\nThe Nigerian education system has suffered from a lot of setbacks. A beautiful curriculum will be designed but it will crash at the point of implementation. Stakeholders have started to urge the Federal Government of Nigeria to incorporate AI in the curriculum. From the aforementioned, science teachers are expected to have some level of competencies to be able to incorporate AI during the teaching of science. The curriculum of science is designed particularly to encourage students\u2019 engagement. Hence incorporating AI into teaching and learning spaces will be capable of enhancing learners\u2019 performance (Popenici & Kerr, 2017). Given the foregoing, it is necessary to undertake a study on factors that influence the utilization of AI in the sciences classroom using the technology acceptance model (TAM). The TAM is used to check for behavioral and external contributors that can be used to ascertain the demeanor and motives about the real employment of AI utilization in the teaching and learning of science. TAM was used in this research to elucidate the effect of identified external and internal factors that influence the approval of teachers in the sciences as they use AI.\nStudy questions: The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence science teachers\u2019 AI utilization by employing TAM. This study, therefore, sought to answer these questions below:\n1. How do science teachers utilize AI in teaching science in respect to the components of TAM? 2. During the teaching of science, what are the variables that influence the effective utilization of AI with regard to TAM? 3. Does science teachers\u2019 data like sex, age, and residence type affect science teacher use of AI?\nSignificance of the study: This study is relevant because it will provide information on the major variables affecting the approval of the usage of AI by science teachers. The study provided information for curriculum developers to take into cognizance when developing one. This study also provided information on the application of AI from the teachers\u2019 angle."

These sensorial modalities involve the senses of sight, hearing, smell, feeling aural, and others (Kundalakesi et\u00a0al., 2017). VR tools available for usage in the teaching of science are Labster Virtual and PhET simulation (Halabi, 2020; Xue and Wang, 2022).\nStudies on the investigation of factors affecting teachers\u2019 adoption of AI abound but with the divergent reason for why teachers adopt AI in education in general and science in particular. Lack of AI resources as a factor affects the use of AI (Beri & Sharma, 2019; Kafyulilo et\u00a0 al., 2015; Palagolla & Wickramarachchi, 2019; Pima, 2019; Pima & Mtui, 2017). The heavy workload of teachers does not give them enough time to explore AI (Boettcher & Conrad, 2016; Dougherty, 2015). Teachers are not trained and do not have the technical support required to use AI (Ahmad et\u00a0al., 2017; Asiri et\u00a0al., 2012; BuabengAndoh, 2012). Teachers find AI very difficult to use and so do not adopt it (S\u00e1nchez\u2010Prieto et\u00a0al., 2019). Computer self-efficacy affects teachers\u2019 use of AI (John, 2015; Lestari & Indrasari, 2019; Rohatgi et\u00a0al., 2016).\nWhen teachers lack the basic knowledge of the availability and usage of AI-based teaching methods, it can affect their adoption (Buabeng-Andoh, 2012; Lawrence & Tar, 2018; Oye et\u00a0al., 2012; Palagolla & Wickramarachchi, 2019; Pima & Mtui, 2017). Some instructors resist innovation in teaching (Beri & Sharma, 2019; Cleveland-Inne et\u00a0 al., 2018; Kisanga, 2016; S\u00e1nchez\u2010Prieto et\u00a0al., 2019).\nHwang et\u00a0al. (2021) study on factors affecting the adoption of AI in higher education indicated that 7/10 of teacher willingness to adopt AI was attributed to self-efficacy, anxiety, usefulness, and comfort of use. Perceived ease and usefulness was a contributing factor to teachers\u2019 adoption of AI (Chocarro et\u00a0al., 2021; Teo, 2019). The results of the study conducted by Buabeng-Andoh (2012) indicated that instructors\u2019 perceived ease of utilization of AI was a determinant factor for the utilization of AI in teaching and\nlearning. Perceived usefulness of AI Ukoh and Nicholas (2022) and risk of use (Li & Gu, 2023).\nIn a study conducted by Zhang et\u00a0 al. (2021) on factors influencing teachers\u2019 use of e-books in the teaching of artificial intelligence, results obtained showed that teachers\u2019 adoption of the e-book was influenced by their perception of the ease ofits utilization. Teachers are interested in the use of AI in the classroom but are handicapped in terms of how to use the AI tools. Training of teachers on the use of AI is very important. This therefore means that the ease of use of AI influences its\u2019 adoption by teachers. (Dimitriadou & Lanitis, 2023). When AI was used in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education to assist teachers in their lesson delivery and the impact on students\u2019 achievement, an enhanced achievement was reported positive response in students\u2019 achievement (Deo et\u00a0al., 2020; Hellings & Haelermans, 2020). Buenano-Fernandez et\u00a0al. (2019) study on the use of AI in the teaching of computer engineering indicated a positive increase on the learning outcome of students. In the same vein, the study of Zabriskie et\u00a0al. (2019) reported improved physics students\u2019 course outcomes.\nInstructors in the education section are not clear on how they can use AI for pedagogical purposes and also how AI can affect teaching and learning in schools (Kengam, 2020). This calls for the need to investigate the nature of AI and its employability in the science classroom. Science instructors need to be armed with the nitty\u2013gritty to surmount the issue of non -non-availability of resources for teaching and bad practices in teaching that have a relationship with the incorporation of AI into the classroom (Lindner & Romeike, 2019). The use of AI in schools may motivate the training of teachers to utilize current teaching techniques like the utilization of technology during teaching and learning.\nFrom the literature reviewed, it is obvious that AI adoption in science education is lagging behind as evident by the scanty literature review in science education. Literature reviewed also indicated that AI in education is gaining ground in other continents, Africa in general and Nigeria in particular is left behind. Stakeholders in Nigeria are calling for the inclusion of AI in the school curricula especially in science education. But no matter how beautiful a curriculum is, teachers are the ones to implement it, and if they do not it becomes ugly. The question is \u2019Are Nigerian science teachers ready to implement the AI curriculum when put in place? There is, therefore, the need to investigate teachers\u2019 characteristics that will impact on the application of AI in the teaching and learning of science in the classrooms, AI merits, and its\u2019 durability when utilized by teachers in the sciences."

The TAM was developed to explain the behaviour of users as well as forecast the variables responsible for that behavior (Chuttur, 2009). For a user to accept a new technology, three factors are important; the perceived usefulness (PU), its perceived ease of use (PEOU), and user attitude towards its usage (ATU) (Mugo et\u00a0al., 2017). The level of utility of a particular technology that a user thinks can increase their effectiveness in their job is perceived usefulness (PU). Perceived ease-of-use (PEOU) is the extent to which a user feels that a particular technology will\nrequire a small amount of energy in its applicability and lastly, attitude towards its usage (ATU) is how the user conducts him/herself during the application of such technology (Davis, 1989). Chen et\u00a0al. (2011) asserted that users\u2019 attitude toward the usage (ATU) of technology is highly dependent on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU).\nThis model proposes that teachers\u2019 use of technology is influenced by their presumed utility and presumed application which may influence their employability of technology directly or indirectly. Recently, progress has been made in TAM to incorporate factors like self-esteem, age, anxiousness/ stress, and confidence (Guner & Acarturk, 2020).\nThe study conducted by (Alrehaili & Alenezi, 2022) reported that perceived performance, presumed effort, and societal factors influenced teachers\u2019 acceptance of the utilization of technology (AI) in education. Owusu et\u00a0al. (2022) study investigated the factors that influence adults\u2019 use of smartphones using TAM. The findings showed that performance perception (Pp) and social influence significantly impacted the behavioural intent (BI) and attention toward using smartphones (AT). In another study\u00a0by\u00a0Chocarro et\u00a0al. (2021), it was indicated that the perceived ease and perceived utilization of AI (chatbots) facilitated its approval.\nThis study model was indicated in Fig.\u00a01.

The mean scores were between 2.10 (Stress and anxiousness) to 3.40 (Attitude towards AI usage) and a total score of 2.995 on a 4-point Likert-type scale.\nDuring the teaching of science, what are the variables that influence the effective utilization of AI with regard to TAM?\nInter-Correlation Analysis The inter-correlations among the six factors of the QAAITE were determined using simple correlation. The results of the analysis using simple correlation were used to guarantee the absence of multiple correlations among the variables in the model. Results as presented in Table\u00a0 3 showed the correlation value among all variables in the correlation to be less than 0.9, this implies that factors did not have multiple correlations.\nThe pathways analysis in Table\u00a0 4 was used to investigate the variables influencing the effective utilization of AI in the teaching of sciences having in mind the part of the approved TAM. Table\u00a0 4 indicated that seven pathways were significant whereas three were not significant.

For the variables with P = <0.05 it means the interaction between them is significant.\nTable\u00a0 5 indicates both the direct and indirect impact of the variables involved in this study through the coefficient of determination R2. This was used to compute the\nforecasting ability of the TAM. It had a value that ranged between 0 and 1 in which the higher the value the stronger the forecasting ability. As reported in Table\u00a05, when the dependent and independent variables were combined, their total effect had a minimum value of 0.355 and a maximum value of 0.789. The higher the total effects number the greater the influence of the variables. The variable with the highest predicting value for ease of use and behaviour intent (0.789) and was seconded by attitude to AI usage and behavioural Intention (0.729).\nDoes science teachers\u2019 data like sex, age, and residence type affect science teacher use of AI?\nAn independent sample t-test as presented in Table\u00a06 compared the behavioural intention of male and female science teachers in the utilization of AI. Analysis in Table\u00a06 indicated a non-significant difference in value between male and female science teachers (t, 77 = 1.988; p = 0.060). The calculated p value of 0.060 was more than 0.05 hence the result of male and female science teachers for behavioural intention in the use of AI was not significant at a 0.05 level of significance.\nOne-way analysis of variance was used to determine the difference in behavioural intention about teachers\u2019 ages and was displayed in Table\u00a0 7. The analyzed data in Table\u00a07 indicated that science teachers within the age bracket of 25\u201334 had the lowest mean score of 11.93 and the least number of science teachers N = 15. Age bracket 45 and above had the highest number of science teachers and also the highest mean score (N = 39 and mean = 12.00.). That same Table\u00a0 7 showed that F (2, 76) = 0.547\nwith a p-value of 0.581 (p \u02c3 0.05) at a 0.05 level of significance.

Findings from this study indicated that science teachers approved the integration of AI in the science classroom. The findings in this research as recorded in Table\u00a0 2 indicated that the approval for the utilization of AI was high with an overall mean score of 3.00. A closer look at Table\u00a02 indicated that the Self-Esteem variable produced the highest effect on the use of AI in science classes with a mean score of 3.89. Other variables in the study were arranged in descending order according to their effects thus; Attitude towards AI usage (3.40), expected benefits (3.10), behavioural intention (2.98), ease of utilization (2.50), and Stress and anxiousness (2.10).\nSelf-esteem contributed the most to the approval level because no matter how good AI is and the teachers do not have confidence in themselves that they can use it, AI will not be utilized. AI usefulness in teaching science may be influenced by perceived ease of use as what seems useful to a science teacher in this case utilization of AI will determine if it will be used or not. This research supports earlier studies by Zhao (2007) that reported that self-esteem is germane in teachers\u2019 approval of the technology, ease of use was collaborated by Buabeng-Andoh, (2012), the usefulness of AI was supported by Yang et\u00a0 al., (2022) and ease of utilization was collaborated by Condie and Livingston (2007).\nThe importance of self-esteem in the adoption of AI in education cannot be overemphasized. It is along this backdrop that (Guner & Acarturk, 2020) incorporated it into the TAM model. Self-esteem is the worth people ascribe to themselves. It has to do with one\u2019s inner thought of one self. If a teacher believes that he/she can use AI in teaching, then it will be adopted otherwise it will throw into the trash can. No one will willing want to disgrace him/herself before students by not able to use before the students.\nThe second research question stated thus: During teaching science, what are those variables that influence the efficiency of using AI?\nTable\u00a04 was used to answer the second research question. That Table\u00a04 indicates the path analysis of the results to determine the variables influencing the efficiency of the utilization of AI in the science classroom by applying segments accepted by TAM. The results of the analysis as represented in Table\u00a04 showed that ten pathways were employed in this study and seven were positively correlated. They were: Self-Esteem and Ease of utilization, Ease of utilization and Expected benefits, Self-Esteem, and Expected benefits, Ease of utilization and Attitude towards AI usage, Expected benefits and Attitude towards AI usage, Expected benefits and Attitude towards AI usage, Expected benefits and Attitude towards AI usage and Attitude towards AI usage and Expected benefits.\nIt can also be said that teachers\u2019 self-esteem in the utilization of AI would make science teachers incorporate AI in the classroom and reduce their stress /anxiety levels. When stress is reduced in the classroom, the work of the teacher will become fun as the relationship between ease of utilization and intent to use technologies is positively correlated (Teo, 2019). With the view that ease of utilization correlates positively with intending to use AI, it can be said that ease of utilization aids the behavioural intention of teachers in the usage of technologies.\nTable\u00a0 5 was used to check for the coefficient of determination. As reported in Table\u00a0 5, when the dependent and independent variables were combined, their total\neffect had a minimum value of 0.355 and a maximum value of 0.789. The variable with the highest predicting value for behaviour intent was the ease of use (0.789) and was seconded by attitude to AI usage (0.729).\nOne can say that the reason why the results showed that pattern can be because teachers\u2019 presumed less effort in the utilization of AI and also as the control of their essential skills in utilization would have increased their right stance and behavioural intent in the incorporation of AI in the classroom. The results of this study agreed with studies conducted before now. The studies of Davis (1989); Adekunle et\u00a0al. (2022) reported the direct impact of presumed ease of utilization on presumed usage. Earlier researchers indicated the link between presumed usefulness and presumed efforts of usage. It was indicated that there was a direct link between presumed usefulness and the intent of use (Straub et\u00a0al., 1995). There was also a direct link between presumed usefulness and presumed efforts of usage (Condie & Livingston, 2007; Zhao, 2007).\nThe results of the study further collaborated the study conducted by Zhang et\u00a0 al. (2021) on factors influencing teachers\u2019 use of e-books in the teaching of artificial intelligence, results obtained showed that teachers\u2019 adoption of the e-book was influenced by their perception of the ease of its utilization. Interest alone on the utilization of a resource is not enough but the ability and ease in the use of that resource is very important. When teachers are trained on the utilization of AI stools there will be ease in it use and as such teachers will employ AI in the classroom. (Dimitriadou & Lanitis, 2023).\nIn a similar vein, the findings of Buabeng-Andoh (2012) indicated that instructors\u2019 perceived ease of utilization of AI was a determinant factor for the utilization of AI in teaching and learning. Teachers\u2019 perception of the usefulness of AI was a contributed to teachers adoption of AI Ukoh and Nicholas (2022). The reports of (Li & Gu, 2023) findings is that teachers will use Ai only if they discover that the risk of use is low.\nResearch 3 stated that: Does science teachers\u2019 data of sex, age, and residence type affect science teacher use of AI? To answer this research question, means, independent sample t-test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed. Findings, as presented in Table\u00a0 6, showed that the t-test results for sex differences in behavioural Intention were t, 394 = 1.410; p = 0.057. The calculated p value of 0.057 was more than 0.05 at a 0.05 level of significance. The result was therefore not significant. This means that both male and female science teachers share the same behaviour intent in the utilization of AI.\nResults in Table\u00a07 of the one-way analysis of variance (ANCOVA) for the difference in teachers\u2019 ages about behaviour intent showed that the was F (2,76) 0.547with a p value of 0.581 (p \u02c3 0.05) at 0.05 level of significance. With the p =  \u02c3 0.05. This result was\u00a0 not significant, implying that the ages of science teachers do not significantly influence their behaviour intent in the utilization of AI.\nThe findings as displayed in Table\u00a0 8 for the influence of science teachers\u2019 residence location on behaviour intent in the utilization of AI showed a t-value of 0.533 and a nonsignificant p-value of.062 at the significance level of 0.05. With this type of result, where sex, age, and residence location showed non-significance results when compared to behavior intent of the utilization of AI, the study states that sex, age, and teachers\u2019 residence do not influence the behavior of science teachers\u2019 intention of the utilization of AI.\nBy implication, it can be said that the results are this way because, when training programmes are organized for science teachers in Nigeria, there is no distinction in terms of sex, age, or residence location. The results of this research align with those done by (Ahmad, 2019; Almousa, 2020; Darayseh, 2023) which also indicated no differences in the statistically computed results. Darayseh (2023) stated that the non-significant difference observed in teachers\u2019 adoption of AI with respect to gender and age was because teachers have similar circumstances and abilities and therefore there was no distinction between them."

            "text": "In results of this study showed that teachers teaching the sciences exhibited an elevated level of approval for the utilization of AI during teaching and learning in science class. The findings also indicated that self-esteem, expected benefits, ease of utilization as well as attitudes to the utilization of AI produced the highest impact concerning teachers\u2019 behaviour intent in the utilization of AI. One can say that the reason why the results showed that pattern can be because teachers\u2019 presumed less effort in the utilization of AI and also as the control of their essential skills in utilization would have increased their right stance and behavioural intent in the corporation of AI in the classroom. This study also showed that the adoption of AI is dependent on the ease with which it can be utilized. Their drive toward AI is also the benefit they stand to derive from AI when it is used in the classroom. By these results, it is crystal clear that for educationists and managers of schools to effectively train science instructors, they need to investigate the potent means of curbing stress and anxiousness and encouraging instructors\u2019 selfesteem in the classroom. This can be done through periodically organizing workshops that will train teachers on the utilization of AI and getting them informed of the available AI tools and how they can be used in the science classroom. This may boost their favourable disposition toward the utilization of AI. And will increase their self-esteem in AI utility. From the results gathered from this study, the following recommendations were made; there should be workshops and seminars to train in-service science instructors on the utilization of AI. Knowledge gained from the workshop will enable teachers to adopt AI in their classes. That will make them master the use of AI tools and will lead to the high self-esteem of the teacher. During teachers\u2019 training programmes, AI should be incorporated in the programmes this will make teachers be conversant with the use of AI in the early stage of their careers and as such build self-esteem in the use of AI.A manual on how to effectively use AI and its tools should be distributed to both inservice and teachers in training. This is to enable teachers to learn about the application of AI even in their comfort zone. The curriculum of science subjects should be revised to accommodate AI tools. This is important as some teachers may not want to use anything outside the prescribed curriculum.\nA prominent limitation of this study is that it was only centered on teachers who teach science subjects. The findings of this study when made to all science teachers should be conscious of the fact that not all teachers\u2019 data/information was used. For instance, the study did not investigate teachers\u2019 academic level, years of teaching experience, marital status, salary grade level, and a host of others. This study indicated that science teachers\u2019 approval level for the utilization of AI was very high. Among the variables examined in\nthis study, self-esteem produced the greatest influencing power on teachers\u2019 behaviour intent in the utilization of AI applications. Factors like expected benefits, ease of utilization, and attitudes to the utilization of AI also have greatly influenced the utilization of AI.\nThe Secondary school Board should set learning objectives that will comprise both teachers and students on the development of AI tools and skills. This study can play an important role for secondary schools that want to keep their students abreast with the newest innovation in science teaching. The method of teaching will bring about the transition from the ancient teaching style to the digital age teaching style. The AI laboratory when put in place can help teachers to practice its usage before class and that can boost teacher self-esteem on the usage. The design of the AI should be according to the user\u2019s needs and be easy to use. With the adoption of AI in the teaching and learning process errors of information in the classroom will be a thing of the past.\nAbbreviations AI Artificial intelligence AAITEQ Approval of artificial intelligence: The Teachers\u2019 Eye\u2019 Questionnaire CEZCRS Calabar education zone of Cross River State, Nigeria TAM Technology acceptance model\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s40561\u2011 023\u2011 00261\u2011x.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
