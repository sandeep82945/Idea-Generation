The prevalence of health insurance coverage was 6.4%. Women covered by health insurance were more likely to utilise ANC (adjusted OR [aOR]=1.48, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.54), SBA (aOR=1.37, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.45) and PNC (aOR=1.42, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.48). Conclusion: Health insurance coverage was an important predictor of maternal healthcare utilisation in our study. To accelerate progress towards the achievement of SDG 3 targets related to the reduction of maternal mortality and achievement of UHC, countries should adopt interventions to increase maternal insurance coverage, which may lead to higher maternal healthcare access and utilisation during pregnancy.\nKeywords: health insurance coverage, maternal healthcare utilisation, postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, sub-Saharan Africa, Sustainable Development Goals."

They are proven services that play a vital role in achieving improved maternal health outcomes.5 Inadequate maternal healthcare utilisation, therefore, constitutes a major driver of maternal complications that result in disability and mortality among women in LMICs including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).5,6 More than 800 women, for instance, die during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 d of termination of pregnancy each day in SSA due to obstetric complications.7\u20139 Thismilitates against the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations on 25 September 2015.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Integral to this goal are SDG targets 3.1 and 3.8, which seek to respectively reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to <70 per 100000 live births and to achieve UHC by 2030.10 Direct out-of-pocket payments for maternal healthcare at the point of service constitute amajor barrier to the utilisation ofmaternal healthcare services in SSA.11\u201315 To achieve UHC by eliminating out-of-pocket payments and improving maternal healthcare utilisation as a proxy for reducing maternal deaths, many SSA countries have implemented diverse forms of health insurance, including national, social, private and community-based health insurance schemes.3,16 Studies conducted at various country levels in SSA have shown that health insurance improves ANC attendance 17, skilled delivery 18,19 and PNC among women of reproductive age.1,20 There is, however, a paucity of empirical literature at the subregional level on the influence of health insurance coverage on maternal healthcare utilisation. We, therefore, sought to bridge the literature gap by examining the influence of health insurance coverage on maternal healthcare utilisation from 28 countries in SSA countries using the nationally representative demographic and health survey (DHS) data. Also, while many of the previous studies focused on either one or two maternal healthcare variables (ANC, SBA and PNC),21\u201324 we used all of them to achieve a robust outcome variable. The findings from this study could inform policymakers and programme planners regarding the effects of health insurance onmaternal healthcare utilisation in SSA."

The model is a multilevel theory that includes contextual as well as individual-level predictors of healthcare utilisation and this forms the basis for the categorisation of the variables in the study as well as the adoption of the multilevel regression in the analysis."

First, percentages were used to present the results of the health insurance coverage and maternal healthcare utilisation (ANC, SBA and PNC) (Table 1). Later, we performed a cross-tabulation to examine the distribution of ANC, SBA and PNC across health insurance coverage, individual- and contextual-level factors, aswell as an estimated Pearson\u2019s\u03c72 test of independence at p<0.05 to show significant variables (Table 2). The statistically significant variables from the \u03c72 test were placed in the regressionmodel. Amultilevel binary logistic regression using five models (Models O\u2013IV) was used to examine the association between health insurance coverage and each of ANC, SBA\nand PNC, controlling for individual- and contextual-level factors (Tables 3\u20135). Model O showed the variance in ANC, SBA and PNC attributed to the clustering of the primary sampling units (PSUs) without health insurance coverage and studied covariates. Model I was fitted to contain health insurance coverage alone. Model II was fitted to contain the individual-level factors. Model III contained the contextual-level factors. Model IV was finally fitted to comprise health insurance coverage, individual- and contextual-level factors. The Stata command \u2018melogit\u2019 was used in fitting the five models. Fixed and random effects were included in all five models. The fixed effects represented the relationship between the explanatory variable and/or covariates and the outcome variable, whereas the random effects represented the measure of variation in the outcome variable based on PSU, as measured by intracluster correlation (ICC). As a result, the ICC was used to quantify the differences between clusters in the sample used for the analysis. Finally, Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) was used to examine the model fitness, or how the various models were fitted with the data. From the models, the one with the least AIC value was selected as the best-fittedmodel. Thus, the final models (IV) in Tables 3\u20135 were chosen for forecasting the association between ANC, SBA and PNC and health insurance coverage. All the regression results were presented using crude ORs (cORs) and adjusted ORs (aORs) at a 95% CI. The women\u2019s sample weight (v005/1000000) was applied to the data to cater for the complex nature of the DHS dataset. The Stata command \u2018svy\u2019 was used to adjust for the disproportionate sampling and non-response and to improve the generalisability of the findings."

Examples of such interventions include training more health professionals and their deployment to rural areas as part of the community-based health implementation, training and integration of traditional birth attendants into the health system to assist health professionals in the emergency deliveries, improve education among women, as well as increase the accessibility and affordability ofmaternal health services through various forms of health insurance schemes.35,36 The very low prevalence of health insurance coverage recorded in SSA, especially in countries like Burkina Faso, could be attributed to themyriad of challenges facing health insurance policy implementation in most of these countries, including poor funding, corruption, implementation challenges, high subscription and premium costs and the lack of political commitment to expand health insurance coverage to the pregnant women, indigents and informal sector workers who need the scheme the most.37\u201344 The abysmal health insurance coverage observed in the subregion inhibits progress towards achievement of UHC for at least 80% of their populace by 2030.10 Despite the overall low health insurance coverage recorded in SSA, countries like Ghana and Gabon recorded high coverage that could be attributed to the interventions put in place by those countries to ensure that their residents are covered. For instance, in Ghana, children aged <18 y, older people aged >70 y, indigents, formal sector workers who contribute to Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) and SSNIT pensioners are exempt from paying the annual premiums required for membership of the scheme.45\u201347 In 2008, the country also incorporated a free maternal health policy into the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), which makes ANC, SBA and PNC free for women. This, thus, encourages women of reproductive age, especially pregnant women, to subscribe more to the scheme.45,46 It is, therefore, not surprising that Ghana recorded the highest health insurance coverage of>70%prevalence of ANC, SBA and PNCutilisation. Linked closely to the high NHIS coverage and high maternal healthcare utilisation is the continuous decline in Ghana\u2019s maternal mortality ratio,48 which points to the effectiveness of the various interventions geared towards achieving the SDG targets of reducing maternal mortality and attainment of UHC.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /inthealth/article/15/2/134/6570889 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /inthealth/article/15/2/134/6570889 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nTable 4.

Women covered by health insurance were more likely to utilise ANC, SBA and PNC than those who were not covered. This observation could be due to the financial protection health insurance offers to women during pregnancy, at childbirth and during the postnatal period. This finding is consistent with a previous study by Ameyaw et al.,5 which showed that health insurance serves as a cost-cutting and enabling intervention that enhancesmaternal healthcare utilisation, especially amongwomen from the lower-income index. Out-of-pocket payments for maternal healthcare at the point of service delivery constitute the foremost barrier to maternal healthcare utilisation, especially among vulnerable and poor women in SSA.12,13,49 Hence, health insurance policies implemented in the subregion by the various governments exist as essential pro-poor initiatives intended to lift the financial barrier to maternal service utilisation among women.34,50,51 Our findings, where women with health insurance had higher odds of utilising maternal health services, shows that health insurance coverage could be a major fulcrum for SSA countries to achieve UHC and reduce maternal mortality to 70 per 100000 live births by the end of 2030, as prescribed by the global SDG agenda 3.1 and 3.8 targets.10,52 Aside from health insurance coverage, we found other variables to be important predictors of maternal healthcare utilisation. For instance, we found a significant association between higher educational status andmaternal health service utilisation. This observation agrees with previous studies that posited that womenwith low educational backgrounds are less likely to utilise maternal healthcare compared with educated women.52,53 This could be because women who are educated and empowered have increased decision-making power, freedom for making choices, informed choice and accept the responsibility for interventions (insurance subscription).34,54,55 This observation demonstrates the positive link between empowerment through education and informed decision making to utilise maternal healthcare.5,56,57 We found that maternal healthcare utilisation was associated with the wealth status of women. Women with stable financial capabilities were more likely to visit ANC during their pregnancy, have their births attended to by skilled professionals and access PNC.55,58,59 This observation points to poverty as a major barrier responsible for poor maternal healthcare utilisation among women. This could be explained by the fact that women who have financial power will be able to pay for transportation from their abodes to the health facility and be able to afford the maternal healthcare bills that result from other services that may not have health insurance coverage.60,61 On the contrary, their poor counterparts, especially those from rural settings, may be unable to afford transportation to the health facilities that are most remote from their residences, nor afford the other medical costs that may accumulate from the maternal services, as not all services are covered by health insurance in most countries in SSA.62\u201364 For example, even although maternal healthcare is free in Ghana under the national health insurance policy of 2003 (Act 650), the cost of transportation from the abodes of women to the remote health facilities where they receive maternal\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /inthealth/article/15/2/134/6570889 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /inthealth/article/15/2/134/6570889 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nTable 5.

This finding is congruent to previous studies that have also shown that exposure to the mass media has a positive influence on the utilisation of ANC services amongwomen.69\u201373 This observation could be explained by the fact that when women are exposed to mass media, they are then informed about the importance of maternal healthcare utilisation and the possible complications or consequences to the mother or child that can occur when not accessingmaternal healthcare. Their exposure tomassmedia could also inform them regarding the benefit of health insurance or the services that are covered by national health insurance and free maternal healthcare policies.71,72,74,75 We noted in this study that multiparous women were less likely to utilisematernal healthcare. This finding is consistent with previous studies that also found a significant association between parity and maternal healthcare utilisation.76\u201378 This points to the fact that parity is an important predictor of adequate maternal healthcare utilisation, especially the antenatal services.79,80 This could be explained by the fact that multiparous women have the perceived confidence that they have more experience with pregnancy and childbirth, hence they are reluctant to utilise maternal health services, mostly the ANC services, during their subsequent pregnancies.77,81,82 It could also be due to any dissatisfaction they feel about the quality of previous care received or any negative attitudes displayed by health professionals they have experienced during their previous pregnancies.83,84 Concerning gaining permission from a spouse before utilising maternal healthcare, we found that women who have a major problem securing permission from their spouses have lower odds of utilising maternal health services compared with women who do not have a problem securing permission. This finding is consistent with previous studies that noted similar observations.85,86 This indicates that if husbands do not see any need for women to utilise maternal healthcare, then it becomes difficult for those women to utilise the necessary maternal healthcare, as going against the decision of their husbandsmay be perceived by those husbands and their families as insubordination, who hence refuse to provide money for transportation and other services.76,87 The observation that women sought consent from their partners before utilising maternal healthcare indicates a requirement to involve male partners in maternal healthcare utilisation and interventions, including education.88 Our findings revealed that the place of residence is significantly associated with maternal healthcare utilisation. Women from rural settings were less likely to utilise maternal healthcare. This finding corroborates previous studies76,89\u201391 and could be attributed to the limited number of facilities in rural areas. The distance from remote rural areas tomajor health facilities is also far, coupled with deplorable road networks. The difficulty in securing transportation and its associated costs could, therefore, deter rural women from utilising maternal healthcare.77,92\u201394 In Sierra Leone, whilematernal healthcare utilisationwas generally high, health insurance coverage was low. The implication, therefore, is that other variables (such as level of education, wealth status, exposure to mass media and place of residence), which have been proven influential in other studies, could have influenced the high utilisation levels.34,53\u201355,60,61,76\u201378,89\u201391 The high levels of maternal health utilisation in Sierra Leone could also have been due to interventions, including the implementation of a Free Health Care Initiative for pregnant and lactating mothers that started in April 2010.95,96 The policy exempts pregnant\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /inthealth/article/15/2/134/6570889 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nwomen and breastfeeding mothers from paying fees for services at the point of delivery.95,96 While we made some important findings, our study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of our data implied that we were unable to establish causality between health insurance coverage andmaternal healthcare utilisation. Also, the self-reported nature of the responses of study participants in the DHSmeant that therewas the possibility of social desirability bias. In addition, the fact that some of the surveys used in this current study were conducted>5 y ago could affect the comparability of its findings with those of older surveys. Another limitation of this study may be that there is an overlap in reporting insurance in countries (like Ghana) where free maternal healthcare likely has a significant impact on healthcare utilisation, but we do not have a way to estimate the impact of this effect. These limitations notwithstanding, a major strength of our analysis is the use of nationally representative data from 28 SSA countries that address the issue of the generalisability of our findings and conclusions. Our use of multilevel regression analyses also took into consideration the data collection procedure used in the DHS, ensuring robust analysis. Finally, our study is the first multicountry effort using the nationally representative DHS data to examine the influence of health insurance coverage onmaternal healthcare utilisation in SSA. It, therefore, contributes extensively to the literature on health insurance coverage and maternal healthcare utilisation among women in the subregion."

To speed up progress towards attainment of the SDG 3 targets related to the reduction of maternal mortality and achievement of UHC using health insurance, our study recommends that countries with low health insurance coverage (Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad and Gambia) need to adopt/step up interventions that have proven to be effective in other countries. Specific interventions include a reduction in premium costs for all potential subscribers and the exemption of women of reproductive age from the payment of such premiums for ANC, SBA and PNC."
