It was observed that a thickness gradient is essential to assist the field-free magnetization switching in these heterostructures. Further, the thermoelectric effects are utilized to develop a technique to detect the field-free magnetization switching. This technique detects the second harmonic ANE signal as a reading mechanism. Using ANE symmetry with the applied current, the switching can be detected in a single current sweep which was corroborated to the conventional DC Hall method.\n1. Introduction\nRecent years have witnessed a renewed interest in developing spin-based logic and\nmemory devices capable of operating at high frequency with low energy consumption 1, 2, 3. However, spin-transfer torque (STT) based magnetic random access memory devices experiences low endurance issues due to the flow of high current density through the tunnel barrier during writing operation 4. In this regard, MRAM utilizing spin-orbit torque (SOT) mechanism for magnetization switching becomes of paramount importance owing to better endurance, faster access time and lower energy consumption in comparison to STT-MRAM. In SOT-MRAM, lateral current flowing through the heavy metal (HM) layer generates spin current due to the bulk spin-Hall effect (SHE) 3, 5 or/and interfacial Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) 6. The spin current in-turn induces a torque in the adjacent ferromagnetic (FM) layer leading to the magnetization reversal in the FM layer in HM/FM heterostructures. Here, the spin-torques generally comprised of two orthogonal components namely anti-damping like torque (AD-SOT) and field-like torque (FL-SOT) 3, 7. Moreover, for realizing high density SOT-MRAM, the robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in the HM/FM heterostructures is desired to maintain a significant energy barrier prohibiting the thermal fluctuation.\nSHE induced AD-SOT is the dominating torque which can manipulate magnetization\norientation in PMA based magnetic heterostructures 1, 3, 8. In order to exploit the nature of SHE and engineer the SOT in magnetic heterostructures, different stacks of HMs and FMs possessing PMA are used, unlike the conventional HM/FM/oxide stacks 1, 8. Amongst them, HM/FM/HM stacks with PMA are of particular interest where the HM layers can be of dissimilar materials 9-12. By carefully engineering the HM layer according to their spin-Hall\nangles (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3b), SOTs and other magnetic properties in HM/FM/HM heterostructures become tuneable. For instance, Pt/Co/Ta enhances SOT efficiency 12 as both the HMs have opposite \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3b, whereas, a symmetric thickness of Pt in the Pt/Co/Pt stack diminishes the SOT efficiency 10, 11. Remarkably, the Ta/Pt/Co/Ta stack enhances the SOT efficiency as well as the anisotropy field 9. Thus, HM/FM/HM stack with PMA and varying spin current is considered as an ideal composite FM layer for investigating different SOT studies. The main motivation behind controlling these SOTs is to understand and achieve magnetization switching without the application of an external magnetic field.\nIn the last decade, various mechanisms have been proposed to achieve magnetization\nswitching without the application of any external symmetry-breaking magnetic field, such as the use of a wedge layer (either FM 13-15, HM 16, 17, or oxide 18), exchange bias field of antiferromagnets 19 and so on. In a recent study, competing spin currents from two successive HM layers having opposite signs of \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3b were also reported to show a field-free switching 20 while others have argued wedge deposition of the HM layer acts as a source of field-free switching 14, 17. In these studies, the case of vanishing AD-SOT was extensively investigated whereas the case of competing spin currents with considerable AD-SOT is still lacking.\nIn the present study, we had characterized the SOTs in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stacks in\ncomparison to the Pt/Co/Pt asymmetric stack. Here, Pt/Co/Pt asymmetric stack was considered as a model system for studying different SOT behaviour. Further, we had introduced a Ta underlayer to the Pt/Co/Pt asymmetric stack to investigate the emergence of various physical phenomena due to the addition of the Ta layer and studied its implication in SOT behaviour and field-free switching. We had used low field AC harmonic Hall voltage technique 21, 22 and magnetization angle-resolved harmonic Hall technique 23, 24 for estimating the SOT contribution in Pt/Co/Pt and Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack, respectively. In Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack, significant thermoelectric effects persist due to the differences in the resistivity and thermal\nconductivity of the layers 25, 26 in comparison to Pt/Co/Pt. It was found that AD-SOT contribution in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack is similar to the value of AD-SOT for Pt/Co/Pt stack. We observed field-free switching in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack using conventional DC Hall methodology. Notably, in this stack, the thermoelectric effect, competing spin currents as well as considerable AD-SOT contribution coexist. It is noteworthy, that the combination of competing spin currents and non-zero value of AD-SOT in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt did not yield any field-free switching in the uniformly grown Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack. The field-free switching in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack was observed when the Co layer had a thickness gradient. This implies that the thickness gradient induced tilted anisotropy is the origin of field-free switching in our thin-film stacks. This finding was further confirmed with the micromagnetic simulation. Moreover, we had utilized the thermoelectric effects in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt as a reading mechanism for magnetization switching. We developed an AC Hall resistance reading technique using anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) to detect the field-free switching in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt apart from estimating the switching current values.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe thin film stacks of Pt(3)/Co(0.6)/Pt(6) (hereafter denoted as Pt stack) and\nTa(3)/Pt(3)/Co(0.6)/Pt(6) (hereafter denoted as Ta stack) were deposited onto thermally oxidized Si/SiO2 substrate by dc-magnetron sputtering. Here, Pt(3) & Ta (3) were the bottom layer for both the Pt & Ta stack, respectively. The thickness of the films indicated in the parenthesis are in nanometers. All films were deposited at room temperature after achieving a base pressure ~10-8 Torr at a working pressure of 3 mTorr. The Co wedge layer had a thickness gradient of 0.06 nm/cm. Six terminal hall bar devices (Figure 1(a)) with a dimension of 135\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a \u00d7 12\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a were patterned using standard photo-lithograph and plasma\netching process for the subsequent transport measurements. In our Hall bar devices, current channels along and perpendicular to the Co thickness gradient direction, were fabricated.\nNotably, devices with current channel parallel to the wedge direction were considered to have insignificant thickness gradient along y-direction (see Figure 1(a) for the coordinates) and considered as uniformly grown Co devices. Unpatterned films in both the stacks (Pt stack & Ta stack) were utilized for the magnetization measurements using vibration sample magnetometry (VSM). Figure 1(b) shows the variation of the magnetization of the stacks as a function of applied field along z-direction (Hz). The square shaped hysteresis loop as depicted in Figure 1(b) confirms the PMA behaviour in both the stacks. The saturation magnetization (Ms) was found to be ~1057 emu/cc for Pt stack and ~1135 emu/cc for Ta stack, respectively. The occurrence of the PMA in both the stack was further corroborated by performing anomalous Hall effect (AHE) resistance measurement as a function of Hz which is depicted in the inset of Figure1(b). The square shaped hysteresis behaviour of AHE measurement confirms the PMA in both Pt stack and Ta stack.\nFor the quantitative study of SOTs, AC measurement techniques utilizing lock-in\namplifiers (EG&G 7265) with reference frequency of 577.13 Hz were used for both Pt and Ta stacks. Current induced magnetization switching was probed using the DC Hall measurement technique (utilizing Keithley 2450 source meter and Keithley 2182A nanovoltmeter) and 2nd harmonic AC Hall technique. All transport measurements were carried out at room temperature.\nwith Hall measurement geometry. (b) Magnetization measurements by VSM as a function of out-of-plane applied field (Hz) and inset shows AHE resistance measurements vs. Hz.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. SOT measurement for the Pt stack\nFor Pt stack, effective fields induced by AD-SOT (HAD) and FL-SOT (HFL) were\nextracted using low field harmonic Hall measurement method. The results of harmonic Hall voltage measurements with varying external magnetic field for Pt stack are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2(a) depicts the experimental geometry and coordinate system along with the material stack. Figure 2(b) shows the representative plots for the in-phase first harmonic Hall voltage \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udf14(left y-axis) and out-of-phase second harmonic voltage \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14(right y-axis) as a function of the external magnetic field applied in the direction of current (Hx). The variation of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udf14(left y-axis) and \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14(right y-axis) as a function of the external magnetic field transverse to the current (Hy) is shown in Figure 2(c). A small out-of-plane field was applied during the experiment to prevent the domain nucleation in the low field range. The effective\nfields HAD, and HFL generated by current-induced AD-SOT and FL-SOT are calculated using 21:\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3f) = \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3f) \u00b1 2\ud835\udf09\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37)\n1\u22124\ud835\udf092 (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3f) = \u22122 ( \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b\n2\ud835\udf14\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc4b(\ud835\udc4c) ) (\n\ud835\udf152\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udf14\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc3b2\ud835\udc4b(\ud835\udc4c) )\u2044 and \ud835\udf09 = \u2206\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc38 \u2206\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc38\u2044 is the ratio of planar Hall\n(PHE) and anomalous Hall resistances (see supporting information for AHE and PHE measurements). Here \u00b1 sign corresponds to up-and down-magnetization, respectively. Further, the variation of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udf14 and \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14with the applied magnetic field using Eq. (1) leads to the estimation of the HAD, and HFL values for Pt stack.\nThe variation of the extracted HAD, and HFL values under different applied currents are\ndepicted in Figure 2(d) and Figure 2(e), respectively. HAD values increases with the applied current at a rate of +1.6 Oe/mA (\u22121.8 Oe/mA) for up-magnetization (down-magnetization)\nwhereas HFL in Pt stack shows no particular trend and is always an order smaller than HAD. The similar interfaces of Pt on both sides of the Co layer show the insignificant effect of Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) and, as an outcome, FL-SOT is negligible compared to the AD-SOT 10. The significant HAD values suggest that, due to the Pt thickness asymmetry on both side of Co thin film, a net spin current flows from the thicker Pt in the Pt stack. The intuitive picture is depicted in Figure 2(a) where a net spin current (Js efffective) acts upon the Co thin film which is the resultant of the countering contribution from the thicker Pt on top (Pttop) & thinner Pt on bottom (Ptbottom) of the Co thin film.\nand an effective spin current direction, along with the schematic diagram for the AC Hall measurement with its coordinate geometry.

(d) HAD and (e) HFL as a function of applied AC currents.\n3.2. Pt stack and Ta stack comparison\nNext, we compared the second harmonic Hall resistance (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14) as a function of\nmagnetic field, swept along the current direction (Hx) for both Pt and Ta stacks which is depicted in Figure 3. The \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 vs Hx curve for Pt stack (Figure 3(a)) differs distinctly from the\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 vs. Hx plot of Ta stack (Figure 3(b)). The Pt stack curve shows a generic AD-SOT\nbehaviour with asymmetric \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14about the field axis (as, \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37 \u221d \ud835\udc5a \u00d7 \ud835\udc66) 23, 27. In case of Ta stack, the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 vs. Hx plot exhibits a significant hysteric nature in low field regime. This is attributed to the presence of thermoelectric effects 24. The electrical current passing through the sample leads to Joule heating which in turn creates the temperature gradient (\u2207T) due to\nmismatch in the resistivity and thermal conductivity in the stack after introducing the Ta layer 25, 26. Notably, the temperature gradient in Ta stack can generate anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) along with longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (SSE) 26, 28. However, the contribution of the SSE is negligible since the Ta stack possesses significant PMA 28.Thus, the hysteric nature is attributed to the presence of ANE in Ta stack. Note that, for Pt stack, the Pt (3 nm) and Pt (6 nm) undergoes different growth conditions (initial Pt(3) was grown on Si/SiO2 wafer whereas Pt(6) was grown on Co layer) which may lead to the difference in the resistivities of the Pt thin films (top & bottom) in comparison to the Co thin film. This could lead to the ANE in Pt stack as well. Moreover, while analyzed closely, the inset of Figure 3(a) shows very faint hysteric signal. In order to comprehend the relative contribution of the ANE in Pt stack & Ta stack, we have measured the variation of the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14with the external field (Hz) swept along the easy axis i.e., the z-axis of the sample 28. Figure 3(c) exhibits the variation of the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 vs \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 for both Pt stack & Ta stack. The occurrence of the feeble hysteresis for Pt stack in comparison to the Ta stack confirms that the ANE signal is dominant (negligible) in Ta stack (Pt stack). Notably, the voltage generated due to ANE is proportional to \ud835\udc5a \u00d7 \ud835\udefb\ud835\udc47, (m being the magnetization of the thin film) which has similar\nmagnetization dependency as HAD. In this regard, while estimating HAD through the\nmeasurement of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14, the contribution of the ANE needs to be separated else it would lead to the overestimation of the HAD values in Ta stack.\n3.3. SOT measurement for the Ta stack\nTo extricate the AD-SOT generated effective field from the ANE contribution, we\nfollowed a low field second harmonic magnetization rotation technique recently developed by H Yang et al. 24. This method avoids the application of high magnetic field (Hext>Hk) while measuring the thermoelectric effects along with the SOT fields. In this method, the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udf14 and \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 were measured to quantify AD-SOT and ANE contribution by rotating the sample in xz-plane in presence of a constant magnetic fields (Hext) 23, 24 (experimental geometry shown in Figure 4(a)). The contribution of FL-SOT is negligible for Ta stack due to similar interfaces about Co layer (see supporting information for details). Considering trifling contribution from planar Hall effect and FL-SOT for Ta stack, the magnetization angle dependent (\ud835\udf03) \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14in presence of Hext can be expressed as 24:\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 = (\n\u2206\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc38\n2\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc58 + \ud835\udc3c0\ud835\udefc\u2207\ud835\udc47) \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf03. (2)\nwhere \ud835\udefc is the ANE coefficient and I0 is the applied AC current defined by \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc3c0\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc61). The magnetization angle \ud835\udf03, was found using \ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\u22121(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a. \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udf14) where the normalized \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udf14 was obtained as a function of magnetic field angle (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc3b) (Figure 4(b)). Equation (1) can further be modified as:\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14\n\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf03) =\n\u2206\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc38\n2\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc58 + \ud835\udc3c0\ud835\udefc\u2207\ud835\udc47 (3)\nThus, it is important to plot the variation of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 vs. \ud835\udf03 which is depicted in Figure 4(c). According to the Eq. (3) the slope of the variation of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 vs. \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf03 would give rise to the quantification of the ANE voltage along with AD-SOT. Figure 4(d) shows the plot of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14\n\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf03)\nvs. 1\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc58 . The slope of this graph leads to the estimation of the AD-SOT whereas the intercept predicts the ANE contributions in Ta stack. In our calculation we have used Hk ~1.4T for Ta stack (see supporting information for the anisotropy field calculation). From Figure 4(d) and using Eq. (3) we have obtained HAD~7 Oe and VANE=0.32 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc49 23, 24.\nRemarkably, HAD for Ta stack matches well with the value of HAD for Pt stack when\nmeasured with the same current density of ~ 3\u00d71010A/m2. The intuitive picture leading to this\nsimilarity in the HAD values in both the samples is depicted in Figure 4(a). In Pt stack, ADSOT was generated because of thickness asymmetry in Pttop and Ptbottom (as shown in Figure 4(a)). The effective spin current acting on the Co layer for Pt stack can be expressed as Js Pt (top) \u2212 Js Pt (bottom). Similarly, for Ta stack, the resultant spin current can be expressed as Js Pt (top) \u2212 Js Pt\u2032(bottom) + Js Ta (bottom). Notably, the addition of Ta underlayer produces a spin current that has similar spin polarization as Pttop since Pt and Ta has opposite \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3b. One\nhas to note that the Ptbottom layer in Pt stack is directly grown on Si/SiO2 substrate whereas in Ta stack (Pt\u2032bottom) it is grown on Ta. It is expected that the quality of the Ptbottom layer in Pt stack is inferior to the Pt\u2032bottom layer in Ta stack. Note that, though 3nm Pt layer separates the Ta layer from Co layer in Ta stack, a less dominant spin current originating in Ta layer can still pass-through the Pt layer and acts on Co. This scenario is equivalent to the situation reported in Ref 17 where the W/Pt/Co/Pt shows a gradual decrease of AD-SOT efficiency (from W dominating to Pt dominating) as the thickness of Pt increases. Notably, In Ref 17 the Pt thickness was always greater than the spin diffusion length (~1.2nm). This in turn indicates that Js Pt\u2032(bottom) \u2212 Js Ta (bottom)(for Ta stack) \u2248 Js Pt (bottom)(for Pt stack). This results in the comparable value of the effective spin current acting on the Co layer for both the stack leading to the similar value of HAD for both the Pt and Ta stack, respectively.\n3.4. SOT induced magnetization switching\nThe presence of considerable AD-SOT in Ta stack was further confirmed by\nperforming magnetization switching experiments through DC Hall resistance (RH) measurements in presence of a symmetry breaking in-plane magnetic field (See supporting information for further details). Further, we had achieved the field-free magnetization switching by measuring RH as a function of DC current pulses. The typical field-free switching behaviour of the Ta stack is demonstrated in Figure 5. Notably, the field-free switching was achieved for the sample with Co deposited in the wedge form unlike the uniformly deposited Co sample. Until now, the field-free magnetization switching experiments in competing current-based heterostructures have been executed for negligible AD-SOT values. However, in our case, we probed the magnetization switching in Ta stack with competing spin currents and significant AD-SOT. It is noteworthy, that the field-free magnetization switching was not achieved in the uniformly grown Ta stack confirming that field-free switching cannot be accomplished by competing spin currents alone.\nThe thickness gradient of FM tilts the out-of-plane anisotropy with a very small angle\n13 which helps to achieve the field-free magnetization switching. It was further confirmed by the micromagnetic simulation. Micromagnetic simulations for Ta stack were performed using OOMMF 29. In order to replicate the current-induced SOT switching experiments, we have used simulation parameters found from the experiments and literatures. Input parameters include sample dimension of 100 \u00d7 100 nm2, saturation magnetization Ms =1135 emu/cc, exchange stiffness constant 30 A=2\u00d710-11 J/m, DMI constant 31 D=0.2 mJ/m2, Hk=1.4 T, spinHall angle \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3b= 0.49 and, critical current density J=3\u00d710 11 A/m2, respectively. In this simulation, we have probed the time evolution of the out-of-plane component of the magnetization (mz) after applying a current pulse. Figure 6(a) depicts the time evolution of mz for the uniformly grown Ta stack with the applied current pulse (shaded region) of density\n3\u00d71011 A/m2 for duration of 4 ns in presence of an in-plane symmetry breaking field of 100\nOe. The mz found to switch due to the applied current pulse. However, in absence of the symmetry breaking field, the magnetization does not switch as evident from the simulation results presented in Figure 6(b) for the uniformly grown Ta stack. Thus, the current pulse alone was unable to switch the magnetisation for the uniformly grown Ta stack. Further, Figure 6(c) exhibits the scenario when the applied current pulse has lesser magnitude compared to the critical current density of 3\u00d71011 A/m2 required to induce the switching in\nuniformly grown Ta stack in presence of 100 Oe symmetry breaking field. In this scenario, the magnetization did not switch its orientation. These results validate our experimental studies on the absence of field-free magnetization switching in uniform Ta stack. To mimic the experimental geometry of the Ta stack with Co wedge, we had considered a small tilt (~5\u00b0) in the anisotropy direction and we had performed the micromagnetic simulation in\npresence of current pulses without any symmetry breaking magnetic field. Figure 6(d) shows the time evolution of mz in presence of a current pulse and it is found that the magnetization indeed switches its orientation without the application of an external field. This corroborates our earlier experimental findings of the field-free magnetization switching due to the Co thickness gradient induced tilted anisotropy with competing spin currents and considerable AD-SOT. Further, the threshold value of the current pulse density of 3\u00d71011 A/m2 found in\nmicromagnetic simulation matches well with the experimentally obtained current pulse density from field free switching behaviour in the Ta stack with Co wedge. All these simulation results confirm that the thickness gradient induced tilted anisotropy helps to achieve the field-free switching of the magnetization.\n3.5. Thermoelectric detection of SOT switching\nThe thermoelectric effects in magnetic heterostructures are considered to be parasitic\nin nature. For instance, anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in magnetic heterostructures can overestimate the current-induced SOT values. This is due to the same magnetization\ndependent symmetry of ANE and AD-SOT. Hence, they both can contribute to a 2nd Harmonic signal.\nThe measurement of RH 2\u03c9 for Ta stack as function of out-of-plane applied field (Hz)\nresembles an AHE type of behaviour for our PMA base stack (shown in Figure 7(a) & 7(b)).\nThis behaviour is consistent with the ANE signature reported in the literature 28, 32.\nGenerally, ANE mimics anomalous Hall effect (AHE) behaviour and hence ANE signal depicts the attributes of magnetization mz. Similar behaviour of AHE and ANE signifies that ANE can also be used as reading mechanism to probe different magnetization states. Conventionally for detecting the field-free magnetization switching in a PMA sample using DC current, the transverse DC resistance is measured with minute probe current after applying the varying current pulses which were swept from positive to negative magnitude and vice versa. In order to utilize ANE for detecting the magnetization orientation we have devised an AC 2nd harmonic technique. In our AC 2nd harmonic technique, a current pulse that changes the magnetization state due to AD-SOT is applied and the 2nd harmonic Hall signal instead of DC Hall resistance, is measured after the pulse. The writing and reading\nmechanisms are illustrated in Figure 8. At first, we have applied a 1ms current pulses with predefined magnitude to change the magnetization state utilizing AD-SOT and wait for 60 sec (similar to the DC Hall measurement scheme as described in supporting information). The second harmonic Hall resistance (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14) using 4 mA AC current was measured subsequently. We have taken the average of 30 readings for better signal to noise ratio.\nThe ANE signal in 2nd harmonic Hall measurement shows magnetization dependency as:\n\ud835\udc492\ud835\udf14,\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38 \u221d \ud835\udc5a \u00d7 \u2207\ud835\udc47\nwhere, \u2207\ud835\udc47 is the thermal gradient generated due to the Joule heating of the stack (\u2207\ud835\udc47 \u221d \ud835\udc3c2) and m is the magnetization vector of the stack. Since the 2nd harmonic Hall voltage is probed along y-direction so the above equation suggests that \ud835\udc492\ud835\udf14,\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38 must have a following form:\n\ud835\udc492\ud835\udf14,\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38 \u221d (\u2207\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc67 + \u2207\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc65)\nHere, \u2207\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \u2207\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc47 are the temperature gradient along x- and z-directions and mx and mz are x- and z-component of magnetization, respectively. The \u2207\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc47 is generated because of the differences in thermal conductivity of substrate and stack materials. Due to the different width of current and voltage branches, heat conduction occurs differently at the centre of Hall bar and towards the Hall branches, which generates \u2207\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc47. For our high PMA based Ta stack the mz part dominates in above equation. The variation of ANE (\ud835\udc492\ud835\udf14,\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38) vs. Hz is asymmetric in nature as the ANE signal is odd with respect to the magnetization reversal.\nFurther, we have employed our AC 2nd harmonic method to detect the field-free\nswitching in Ta stack which exhibit a significant ANE contribution as depicted in Figure 3 & 7(b). Figure 9 exhibits \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 2\ud835\udf14 vs. the applied current pulses for Ta stack depicting field-free magnetization switching, employing our method. As expected, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 2\ud835\udf14 is symmetric about the current axis and the complete current sweep retraces its nature with two distinct crossover regions where the magnetization switching occurs (inset of Figure 9). Using our method, we can restrict the application of the DC pulses until zero while starting from the positive (negative) value. The sensitivity of the proposed methodology was further confirmed by plotting \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 2\ud835\udf14 vs the applied current pulses together with the Hall resistance (RH) as a function of DC current as shown in Figure 9. The switching current estimated to be ~43 mA by our method matched well to the conventional DC Hall measurement method.\n4. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, we have investigated the effect of addition of the Ta underlayer to the\nasymmetric Pt/Co/Pt stack on the enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, spin orbit torque and emergence of the ANE which was otherwise negligible in the asymmetric Pt/Co/Pt stack. It was found that FL-SOT torque remains insignificant in both the stacks whereas the AD-SOT exhibits similar magnitude. For estimating AD-SOT torque, we have adopted an angle resolved magnetization rotation technique through the measurement of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3b 2\ud835\udf14 in presence of an externally applied magnetic field. Using this methodology, we could quantify the AD-SOT and ANE contributions, respectively. In addition, we could probe the field-free magnetization switching using current pulses in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack with significant AD-SOT. Regardless of the presence of the competing spin currents in the Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stacks, the field-free switching was attributed to the tilted anisotropy induced due to the\ndeposition of Co in a wedge form. This was further confirmed by the micromagnetic simulation. Moreover, we had developed a methodology of detecting field-free switching by utilizing the ANE behaviour present in our sample. In our methodology, the field-free switching as well as the estimation of the switching current can be achieved by sweeping the current from zero to positive (negative) value unlike the full current sweep from positive to negative current values for the DC method. Our result suggests that the simple addition of Ta to the model Pt/Co/Pt stack leads to the unravelling of the new physical phenomena indicating that underlayer indeed plays a major role which would eventually lead to the realization of high efficiency SOT devices coupled with strong PMA."

For Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack, we have calculated the anisotropy field using 3:\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f(\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udf03) = \ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc95\n\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc8c \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc6f \u2212 \ud835\udf03) S(1)\nwhere, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc6f is the angle between the external magnetic field (Hext) and z-axis. \ud835\udf03 is the magnetization angle (for coordinate geometry see Fig S2(a)). The method to find \ud835\udf03 values from magnetic field rotation is discussed in the main text. The fitting of eq. S(1) is shown in Fig. S2(c).The obtained value of Hk is ~1.43\u00b10.23T for Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack in comparison to the Hk ~0.34T observed for Pt/Co/Pt stack. The enhancement in the Hk due to the insertion of the Ta under layer corroborates to the literature 4.\nFig. S2(a) Experimental geometry and coordinate system of magnetization m(\ud835\udf03, \ud835\udf11) and external magnetic field H(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc3b , \ud835\udf11\ud835\udc3b).

The FL-SOT is induced in HM/FM heterostructures due to the interfacial Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE).

This indicates that the FL-SOT values are insignificant, similar to the Pt/Co/Pt case. The similar Pt interfaces about Co layer diminish the FL-SOT effect in both Pt/Co/Pt and Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stacks.\nFig. S3.

In this DC measurement technique, a varying current pulse for the duration of 1ms followed by a 60 sec wait time was applied through current channel. Subsequently, the transverse resistance RH was measured at 500\u00b5A read current in the Delta configuration employing Keithley 2450 source meter and 2182A nanovoltmeter. The experimental results with different in-plane field values are shown in Fig. S6. The hysteresis behaviour of RH vs. I plot confirms the significant value of AD-SOT in Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack.\nFig. S4.
