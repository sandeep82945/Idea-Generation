1. **Investigate the use of different natural oils as the hydrophobic phase of the nanoemulsion.** This could potentially lead to the development of polyzymes with different properties, such as improved stability, biocompatibility, or catalytic activity.


2. **Explore the use of different TMCs as the catalyst in the polyzyme.** This could potentially lead to the development of polyzymes with different catalytic activities, allowing them to be used for a wider range of applications.


3. **Investigate the use of different biocompatible crosslinking agents to stabilize the nanoemulsion.** This could potentially lead to the development of polyzymes that are more stable in vivo, making them more suitable for clinical applications.


4. **Explore the use of polyzymes for the delivery of other therapeutic agents, such as drugs, imaging agents, or gene therapy vectors.** This could potentially lead to the development of new targeted therapies for a variety of diseases.


5. **Investigate the use of polyzymes for the development of biosensors.** This could potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic tools for a variety of diseases.
