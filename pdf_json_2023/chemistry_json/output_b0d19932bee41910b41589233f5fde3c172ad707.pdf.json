    "abstractText": "Owing to the poor treatment efficiency of wastewater containing fluoroquinolones (FQs), effective removal of such pollutants has become a significant issue in waste management. In this study, a ternary covalent organic polymer anchored with SO3H (COP-SO3H) was designed using the Schiff reaction and a multicomponent solvent thermal method. The synthesized COP-SO3H polymer possesses multiple functional binding sites, including amide groups, sulfonic groups, and aromatic frameworks, enabling it to effectively adsorb ciprofloxacin (which belongs to FQs) through mechanisms such as pore-filling effects, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-\u03c0 electron donor\u2013acceptor (EDA) interactions, and hydrophilic\u2013lipophilic balance. COP-SO3H demonstrated outstanding adsorption performance for ciprofloxacin, exhibiting a high adsorption capacity, broad pH stability, strong resistance to ionic interference, and good regenerability. Moreover, it displayed preferential selectivity toward fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The present study not only investigates the intricate structural and functional design of COP-SO3H materials but also presents potential applications for the efficient adsorption of specific antibiotics.",

            "text": "Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a primary category of pharmaceutical compounds that exhibit high antibacterial efficacy and are widely used in disease treatment, infection prevention, and other areas [1,2]. Among these, ciprofloxacin (CIP), a third-generation FQ antibiotic and a prominent representative of the quinolone antibiotic class, is widely employed in livestock farming, healthcare, and aquaculture because of its cost-effectiveness, notable therapeutic benefits, and wide antibacterial coverage. Approximately 70% of these antibiotics are not metabolized and enter the environment through feces and urine [3]. CIP has been detected in diverse water bodies, including wastewater from hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, residential areas, and rivers, with concentrations ranging from micrograms to milligrams per liter. Furthermore, research has indicated that the concentration of CIP in pharmaceutical factory effluents can exceed 31 mg\u00b7L\u22121, posing a significant threat to human health [4,5]. In recent years, prolonged consumption of drinking water containing CIP has led to symptoms such as anxiety, nausea, vomiting, headaches, diarrhea, and tremors [6]. High concentrations of CIP can damage the human immune system, leading to conditions such as acute renal failure, elevated liver enzyme levels, and reduced white blood cell counts [7]. Additionally, CIP inhibits the growth of photoautotrophic aquatic organisms and exhibits high toxicity at certain concentrations [8]. When exposed to residual antibiotics and their metabolic degradation products, aquatic\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28196941 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 2 of 20\nbacteria in water environments develop resistance genes, which accelerate the development of bacterial resistance [9]. Given that CIP is continuously released into surface waters from wastewater treatment plants, agricultural runoff, aquaculture, and pharmaceutical manufacturing sites and subsequently enters the environment and threatens human health, it has become a popular research topic in the field of water environment remediation [10,11]. Various methods have been developed to remove CIP from water, including advanced oxidation processes [12], electrocoagulation [13], photodegradation [14], biodegradation [15], and adsorption [16]. Among these, the adsorption technique is distinguished by its cost-effectiveness, straightforward design, high efficiency, and compatibility with other water treatment systems. The choice of adsorbent material significantly affects the adsorption rate [17]. Thus far, inexpensive materials, such as silica dioxide, clay, zeolite, and bentonite, have been used to remove antibiotics from water. However, adsorbents commonly exhibit low porosity, small specific surface area, weak surface charge, low capacity, and poor selectivity, which ultimately diminish their removal efficiency of quinolone antibiotics [18,19]. Consequently, there has been widespread focus on designing adsorbents with exceptional extraction capabilities and significant selectivity based on the target molecular structure and physical characteristics to address these limitations [20,21]. Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are organic porous substances composed of light components, such as C, N, O, and H. The synthesis of various crystalline and amorphous COPs has been achieved, encompassing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) [22,23], covalent triazinyl frameworks (CTFs) [24], and microporous organic polymers (MOPs) [25]. Because of their strong chemical tunability, high crystallinity, adjustable pore structure, low density, and excellent stability, they are frequently employed in energy storage, gas adsorption and storage, and multiphase catalysis. Currently, sulfonated H-COF-SO3H exhibits selective adsorption towards paraquat and dipyridine-containing polar cations through electrostatic interactions [26]. MOPs based on the Schiff base (SNW-1) can serve as enrichment coatings for the collection of volatile fatty acids in tea and tobacco powder samples [27]. Therefore, COPs demonstrate promising adsorption performance and application prospects. However, reports on the utilization of COPs as adsorbents in antibiotic wastewater treatment are limited, particularly regarding the selective adsorption of FQs. FQ antibiotics commonly possess a molecular structure featuring two ion-binding sites, a carboxyl group, and an amine group [1]. Based on this characteristic, an adsorbent with a specific affinity towards FQs was designed to achieve efficient and selective capture of FQ antibiotics while avoiding interference from other pollutants on its adsorption performance and enhancing its overall efficiency. To accomplish our objective, a solvothermal method was employed to prepare a porous material (COP-SO3H) featuring micropores and mesoporous pores. These pores serve as channels and pathways for diffusion within the adsorbent. Micropores and mesopores provide pathways for the diffusion of the adsorbate into the adsorbent material. The introduction of a sulfonic acid group and a -CO-NH- group to the adsorbent and electrostatic interactions between COP-SO3H and FQs are expected to enhance the selectivity for FQs and effectively remove FQs present in water. The adsorption mechanism is mainly based on the pore-filling effect, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-\u03c0 EDA interactions, and hydrophilic\u2013lipophilic equilibrium. To verify the adsorption mechanism, the adsorption behavior of a new covalent organic polymer, COP-SO3H, on FQs in water (taking CIP as an example) was examined in this study, and detailed information on the adsorption capacity, adsorption kinetics, adsorption thermodynamics, and adsorption mechanism was obtained. The present study not only investigated the selective adsorption of sulfonic acid groups and amide bonds on FQs in covalent organic polymers, but also proposed a novel approach for designing the removal of organic pollutants from water.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 3 of 20"

            "text": "2.2.1. Effect of Adsorbent Dosage on Adsorption Performance\nThe influence of adsorbent dosage on the removal efficiency of CIP was further assessed to optimize the COP-SO3H dosage for the experiments, aiming to maintain costeffectiveness and pollutant removal efficacy. The COP-SO3H loading ratio (ratio of material mass to CIP solution volume) was varied across five gradients, ranging from 0.25 g\u00b7L\u22121 to 2 g\u00b7L\u22121, for the adsorption experiments. The aforementioned material was added to a 50 mL centrifuge tube, followed by 20 mL of pollutant solution at a concentration of 10 mg\u00b7L\u22121. Subsequently, the mixture was placed on an open-air orbital shaker and agitated for 24 h. Subsequently, the concentration of FQ was determined. The results shown in Figure 5A indicate that, as the adsorbent dosage increased, the removal efficiency gradually increased from 67.92% to 95.97%. This trend can be attributed to the increase in the effective surface area and adsorption sites of the material for pollutants [35]. However, because the amount of pollutants in the system remains fixed, excessive addition of adsorbent material results in the aggregation of adsorbent particles [36]. This leads to unoccupied adsorption sites, where pollutants remain uncaptured, rendering an increased dosage of adsorbent material only marginally effective in enhancing the removal efficiency of CIP [37]. Consequently, the CIP removal efficiency slowly increased when the dosage was between 1 and 2 g\u00b7L\u22121. Considering the removal efficiency and experimental cost, the optimal COP-SO3H dosage was 1.0 g\u00b7L\u22121.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 7 of 20\n2.2.2. Effect of pH on Adsorption Performance\nDuring operation, wastewater treatment plants must treat sewage at various pH levels. Therefore, the adsorbent must efficiently capture antibiotics over a wide pH range, making the pH value of wastewater a significant reference factor influencing the adsorption process.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 8 of 20\nFigure 5B shows the impact of pH (ranging from 2.0 to 10.0) on the adsorption capacity of COP-SO3H for CIP. At an initial CIP concentration of 10 mg\u00b7L\u22121 and a temperature of 293 K, the equilibrium adsorption capacity (qe) of CIP on COP-SO3H increased from 5.1 mg\u00b7L\u22121 to 9.6 mg\u00b7L\u22121 as the pH increased, and then slightly decreased to 9.15 mg\u00b7L\u22121. Notably, CIP exists in three forms, depending on the pH: cationic (CIP+) at pH < 6.18, anionic (CIP\u2212) at pH > 8.15, and zwitterionic (CIP0) at 6.18 < pH < 8.15. The zeta potential of COP-SO3H was negatively charged and increased with increasing pH. Based on the experimental results, as the pH increased from 4 to 6, the negative charge of COP-SO3H significantly strengthened, increasing the adsorption capacity. As the pH approached neutrality, the strong hydrophobic interaction between CIP0, CIP\u00b1, and COP-SO3H, coupled with enhanced \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 electron donor\u2013acceptor (EDA) interactions due to electrostatic attraction, significantly increased the adsorption affinity between them. Conversely, strong electrostatic repulsion weakened the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 EDA interaction, thereby inhibiting the adsorption effectiveness of COP-SO3H for CIP. Therefore, the influence of pH on the CIP adsorption capacity of COP-SO3H depends on the balance between the electrostatic, hydrophobic, and \u03c0-\u03c0 EDA interactions. Because qe peaked at pH 6, this pH level was selected as the most suitable for our experiments.\n2.2.3. Influence of Contact Time on Adsorption/Adsorption Kinetics To evaluate the impact of contact time on adsorption, 1 g\u00b7L\u22121 CIP solutions with initial concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 mg\u00b7L\u22121 were exposed to COP-SO3H for varying durations. The temperature was maintained at 20 \u25e6C. Figure 5C shows that the equilibrium time for CIP adsorption onto COP-SO3H is within 24 h for all three initial concentrations. The adsorption capacities of COP-SO3H for CIP with initial concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 mg\u00b7L\u22121 were 9.05, 15.57, and 19.76 mg\u00b7L\u22121, respectively. These results indicated that increasing the initial CIP concentration enhanced the adsorption capacity. Three kinetic models were fitted to the data to understand the adsorption process and mechanism: pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intra-particle diffusion models. The equations used are as follows [38\u201340]:\ndqt dt = k1(qe \u2212 qt) (1)\nn ( qe \u2212 qt ) = ln qe \u2212 k1t (2)\ndqt dt = k2(qe \u2212 qt) 2 (3)\nt qt = 1 qe t + 1 k2q2e (4)\nqt = ki,dt 1/2 + Ci (5)\nwhere qe (mg) and qt (mg) represent the adsorption amounts of CIP on COP-SO3H at equilibrium and time t, respectively, k1 (h\u22121) is the first-order adsorption rate constant, k2 (g\u00b7mg\u22121\u00b7h\u22121) is the second-order adsorption rate constant, and Ci (mg\u00b7g\u22121) is the parameter representing the thickness of the adsorbed CIP layer. Based on the fitting results (Figure 5D,E and Table 2), the pseudo-second-order model demonstrated a stronger fit (R2 > 0.99) than the pseudo-first-order model. Additionally, the experimentally determined adsorption capacities (qe,exp) closely aligned with the calculated values (qe,cal) from the pseudo-second-order model, indicating that it describes the adsorption process of CIP onto COP-SO3H more accurately than the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. These results underscore that chemical adsorption is the primary mechanism governing CIP adsorption onto COP-SO3H.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 9 of 20\nIntra-particle diffusion analysis (Figure 5F and Table 3) revealed a three-stage diffusion process of CIP within COP-SO3H. The initial stage is the external diffusion phase, where the adsorption rate ki,1 reached its maximum at the same concentration, indicating rapid adsorption. This suggests that CIP molecules migrated from the solution to the external surface of COP-SO3H during initial adsorption. The second stage is the internal diffusion phase, with the adsorption rate ki,1 > ki,2, indicating gradual adsorption. This suggests that the CIP molecules saturated the external surface of COP-SO3H and diffused from the outer surface to the inner surface of the material. The third stage is the desorption\u2013adsorption equilibrium phase, where the adsorption rate ki,2 > ki,3 \u2248 0. This indicated that the CIP molecules reached saturation on both the external and internal surfaces of COP-SO3H, and the desorption and adsorption of CIP molecules reached equilibrium. However, none of the diffusion curves passed through the origin, suggesting that the entire adsorption process was influenced by multiple steps [41].\n2.2.4. Adsorption Isotherms and Thermodynamics\nThis section explores the maximum CIP adsorption capacity of COP-SO3H and its interactions. The adsorption results at CIP concentrations ranging from 10 to 170 mg\u00b7L\u22121 under three different temperature conditions (10, 20, and 30 \u25e6C) were investigated. The experimental data were fitted using single-layer Langmuir and multi-layer Freundlich adsorption isotherm models (Figure 6A,B), as represented by Equations (6) to (8) [42,43]:\nCe qe = 1 KLqm + Ce qm\n(6)\nRL = 1\n1 + KLC0 (7)\nqe = KFC 1/n e (8)\nwhere qe (mg\u00b7g\u22121) represents the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for the adsorbate CIP at adsorption equilibrium, Ce (mg\u00b7g\u22121) is the residual concentration of CIP in the solution at adsorption equilibrium, qm (mg\u00b7g\u22121) denotes the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity per unit mass of adsorbent COP-SO3H, KL (L\u00b7mg\u22121) is the Langmuir equilibrium constant, 1/n represents the adsorption intensity, and RL indicates the difficulty level of the adsorption process.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 10 of 20\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 20\nwhere qe (mg\u00b7g\u22121) represents the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for the adsorbate\nCIP at adsorption equilibrium, Ce (mg\u00b7g\u22121) is the residual concentration of CIP in the solu-\ntion at adsorption equilibrium, qm (mg\u00b7g\u22121) denotes the theoretical maximum adsorption\ncapacity per unit mass of adsorbent COP-SO3H, KL (L\u00b7mg\u22121) is the Langmuir equilibrium\nconstant, 1/n represents the adsorption intensity, and RL indicates the difficulty level of\nthe adsorption process.\nFigure 6.

(F) Thermodynamic\nfit of CIP adsorption onto COP-SO3H.\nThe results indicated a significant increase in the adsorption capacity of COP-SO3H for CIP with higher initial concentrations under the same temperature conditions. This trend suggests that elevated initial concentrations promote CIP adsorption onto COPSO3H by creating a larger concentration difference, thereby acting as a pivotal driving force for adsorption [44,45]. This reduction in the mass transfer resistance between CIP\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 11 of 20\nin the solution and COP-SO3H enhanced the overall efficiency. As shown in Table 4, the Langmuir model exhibited a better fit (R2 > 0.99) than the Freundlich model, indicating that the single-layer adsorption mechanism better described the CIP adsorption process of COPSO3H. According to the Langmuir model, the theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of COP-SO3H for CIP at 10, 20, and 30 \u25e6C were 30.37, 39.11, and 44.96 mg\u00b7g\u22121, respectively. Importantly, COP-SO3H exhibited superior adsorption performance compared to other adsorbents, such as modified montmorillonite, sandy silt soil, and carbon nanofibers (Figure 5J and Table 5), highlighting its value as a practical adsorbent. Furthermore, the calculated RL values for CIP adsorption onto COP-SO3H at 10, 20, and 30 \u25e6C ranged from 0.047 to 0.470, falling between 0 and 1. This suggests that the adsorption equilibrium between COP-SO3H and CIP promotes the adsorption process effectively.\nAdsorption thermodynamics helps to understand the effect of temperature on the adsorption process and can further elucidate the adsorption mechanism of CIP onto COPSO3H. At different temperatures, the values of Gibbs\u2019 free energy change (\u2206G0, kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), entropy change (\u2206H0, kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), and enthalpy change (\u2206S0, kJ\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121) were calculated using Equations (9)\u2013(11) as follows [55]:\n\u2206G0 = \u2212RTln Ka (9)\nKa = 106KL (10)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 12 of 20\nln Ka = \u2206S\u25e6 R \u2212 \u2206H \u25e6 RT (11)\nwhere R is the universal gas constant (8.3145 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121), and T is the solution temperature (K). Ka is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant without units, which can be obtained by multiplying Langmuir equilibrium constant KL (L\u00b7mg\u22121) by 106. As shown in Table 6, the values of \u2206G0 were negative at 10, 20, and 30 \u25e6C, indicating that the adsorption of CIP onto COP-SO3H was spontaneous. With increasing temperature, the values of \u2206G0 decreased from \u22121.95 to \u22124.23 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121, indicating that higher temperatures enhanced the adsorption performance of COP-SO3H. This observation was consistent with the Langmuir model fitting results. Moreover, the obtained value of \u2206H0 suggested that the adsorption of CIP onto SO3H was an endothermic process.\n2.2.5. Influence of Inorganic Ion Type and Ionic Strength on Adsorption\nTo assess the impact of inorganic ions in the wastewater on the adsorption of CIP onto COP-SO3H, eight ions were selected for experimentation: Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ (as cations) and Cl\u2212, SO42\u2212, CO32\u2212, and HCO3\u2212 (as anions). The effects of different ion concentrations (10 mM) on CIP adsorption onto COP-SO3H were also investigated. Notably, the hydrogen bonds between the oxygen acid ions and COP-SO3H enhanced the affinity between these ions and CIP. Consequently, oxygen-containing acid ions suppressed the adsorption of CIP onto COP-SO3H. Furthermore, the effects of the Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations on adsorption were examined (Figure 5I). As the Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations increased, the hydrophobic interactions between COP-SO3H and CIP intensified. Simultaneously, the competition between CIP and Na+ or Ca2+ resulted in a substantial initial decrease, followed by a plateau in the adsorption amount of COP-SO3H for CIP.\n2.2.6. Recyclability\nThe recyclability of adsorbents has economic value for wastewater treatment. Highly recyclable adsorbents contribute to both stability and cost reduction during practical use. Methanol was employed as a desorption agent for five consecutive adsorption\u2013desorption cycles of CIP onto COP-SO3H. Based on the results, the CIP removal efficiency of COPSO3H and its recovery efficiency in each cycle were investigated. The results indicated that the removal efficiency could reach 92% by the third cycle, and with an increase in the number of cycles to five, the removal efficiency of COP-SO3H for CIP still remained at 75% (Figure 5K). SEM, FT-IR, and XRD analyses (Figure 7A\u2013C) revealed no significant structural changes in COP-SO3H after five cycles. This finding demonstrates that COP-SO3H is a reusable adsorbent.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6941 13 of 20Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 20\nFigure 7.

To investigate the adsorption selectivity of COP-SO3H, its efficiency in removing sul-\nfonamide, tetracycline, and quinolone antibiotics was assessed at a pH of 6.

This design endowed the polymer with porous structural characteristics, abundant \u03c0-conjugated phenyl rings, and abundant CO-NH and SO3H functional groups, which facilitated the removal of CIP from water. The experimental results showed that COP-SO3H achieved a good adsorption performance over a wide pH range of 4\u201310. The adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and followed the Langmuir model. Moreover, BET, XPS, FT-IR, and zeta potential analyses indicated that the adsorption mechanism involved pore-filling effects, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-\u03c0 EDA interactions, and the hydrophilic\u2013lipophilic balance. After five cycles, the material maintained a removal efficiency of >75%, confirming the reusability of COP-SO3H.
