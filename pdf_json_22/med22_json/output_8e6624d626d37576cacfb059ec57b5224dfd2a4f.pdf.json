    "abstractText": "Background: Data on changes in lung function in eosinophilic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are limited. We investigated the longitudinal changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and effects of inhaled corti\u2010 costeroid (ICS) in Korean COPD patients. Methods: Stable COPD patients in the Korean COPD subgroup study (KOCOSS) cohort, aged 40 years or older, were included and classified as eosinophilic and non\u2010eosinophilic COPD based on blood counts of eosinophils (greater or lesser than 300 cells/\u03bcL). FEV1 changes were analyzed over a 3\u2010year follow\u2010up period. Results: Of 627 patients who underwent spirometry at least twice during the follow up, 150 and 477 patients were classified as eosinophilic and non\u2010eosinophilic, respectively. ICS\u2010containing inhalers were prescribed to 40% of the patients in each group. Exacerbations were more frequent in the eosinophilic group (adjusted odds ratio: 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.10\u20132.03). An accelerated FEV1 decline was observed in the non\u2010eosinophilic group (adjusted annual rate of FEV1 change: \u2212 12.2 mL/y and \u2212 19.4 mL/y for eosinophilic and non\u2010eosinophilic groups, respectively). In eosinophilic COPD, the adjusted rate of annual FEV1 decline was not significant regardless of ICS therapy, but the decline rate was greater in ICS users (\u2212 19.2 mL/y and \u2212 4.5 mL/y, with and without ICS therapy, respectively). Conclusions: The annual rate of decline in FEV1 was favorable in eosinophilic COPD compared to non\u2010eosinophilic COPD, and ICS therapy had no beneficial effects on changes in FEV1.",

FEV1 changes were analyzed over a 3\u2011year follow\u2011up period.\nResults: Of 627 patients who underwent spirometry at least twice during the follow up, 150 and 477 patients were classified as eosinophilic and non\u2011eosinophilic, respectively. ICS\u2011containing inhalers were prescribed to 40% of the patients in each group. Exacerbations were more frequent in the eosinophilic group (adjusted odds ratio: 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.10\u20132.03). An accelerated FEV1 decline was observed in the non\u2011eosinophilic group (adjusted annual rate of FEV1 change: \u2212 12.2 mL/y and \u2212 19.4 mL/y for eosinophilic and non\u2011eosinophilic groups, respectively). In eosinophilic COPD, the adjusted rate of annual FEV1 decline was not significant regardless of ICS therapy, but the decline rate was greater in ICS users (\u2212 19.2 mL/y and \u2212 4.5 mL/y, with and without ICS therapy, respectively). Conclusions: The annual rate of decline in FEV1 was favorable in eosinophilic COPD compared to non\u2011eosinophilic COPD, and ICS therapy had no beneficial effects on changes in FEV1.\nKeywords: COPD, Blood eosinophil count, Exacerbation, Forced expiratory volume in 1 s, Longitudinal change\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

COPD is regarded as heterogeneous condition and chronic airway inflammation in COPD is thought to be driven by neutrophils and lymphocytes [2]. This type of airway inflammation is a prominent feature in most COPD patients unlike in asthmatic patients, and related to the degree of airflow limitation [3].\nAirway inflammation in asthma is mediated by type-2\u00a0 T helper (Th2) cells and eosinophils, associated with an exacerbation risk and poor disease control following inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) withdrawal [4, 5]. The presence of eosinophils has been reported in the blood or sputum of 30\u201340% COPD patients [6].

In the general population, spirometry-based COPD patients experience more exacerbations with high blood eosinophil counts [10, 11]. Although higher eosinophil levels increase the risk for COPD exacerbation, they are also associated with a greater risk reduction after the use of ICS [12\u201314].\nHowever, few studies have investigated the effects of blood levels of eosinophils on lung function. In this study, we evaluated longitudinal changes in forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (FEV1) in patients with eosinophilic COPD, and analyzed the effects of ICS on this parameter."

Blood eosinophilia was associated with increased exacerbation risk, and this phenotype could benefit from corticosteroid therapy directed against eosinophilic inflammation [13, 14, 21\u2013 23]. A recent trial targeted eosinophilic inflammation (IL-5) to reduce exacerbation risk in eosinophilic COPD patients, suggesting that selectively eosinophilic-pathway blockers may be effective for such patients [24]. Elevated peripheral blood eosinophil counts in COPD may be used to identify patients who are expected to have favorable response to ICS therapy or biologics targeting Th2 inflammatory pathway. Conversely, ICS withdrawal in eosinophilic COPD leads to increases exacerbation risk [25]. Following ICS withdrawal, trough FEV1 decreased and exacerbation risk increased only in the high eosinophil group [26].\nMost trials assess the impact of ICS on COPD using exacerbation risk as the outcome, therefore data regarding ICS effects on FEV1 change is limited. A post hoc study reported favorable effects of extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate and formoterol fumarate, compared to formoterol fumarate alone, on FEV1 change in the highest blood eosinophil quartile (\u2265 279.8 cells/\u03bcL). In this trial, severe COPD patients with FEV1 of 30\u201350% of predicted value, and at least one exacerbation in the previous year were included [27].\nA study on effects of ICS monotherapy on disease progression in moderate to severe COPD reported no differences in the rate of decline of post-bronchodilator FEV1 between fluticasone propionate and placebo over 3\u00a0years. However, when analyzed using baseline blood eosinophil levels, the rate of FEV1 decline was significantly lower in the fluticasone propionate group compared to placebo in the \u2265 2% eosinophil group (\u2212 40.6\u00a0mL/y and \u2212 74.5\u00a0mL/y, respectively; p = 0.003)[22].\nIn the present study, annual rate of FEV1 change declined significantly in the lower blood eosinophil group. Analyses of ICS effects on longitudinal FEV1 change in high-blood-eosinophil group revealed a greater decline rate in ICS users. Although we demonstrated increased exacerbation risk in the eosinophilic COPD group, consistent with previous studies [10\u201312], the annual FEV1 decline rate was low in eosinophilic COPD compared to non-eosinophilic COPD, and ICS provided no benefits. Unlike previous trials [22, 27], only 20% of subjects had previous exacerbations and approximately 66% had mild to moderate FEV1 severities in the KOCOSS cohort. Different airflow obstruction severities and previous exacerbation history may have caused the differences in FEV1 change.\nIn this study, we used blood eosinophil count as a marker of treatment response to ICS in COPD cohort.\nIn consideration of patients with asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) high probability, we defined ACO by eosinophil count of cells/\u03bcL and/or extreme BDR criteria (> 15% and 400\u00a0 mL). More than 98% were classified according to the eosinophil criteria. Absence of unified diagnostic criteria for ACO resulted in inconsistent clinical manifestations and outcomes. Moreover, in our previous study, we showed that blood eosinophil was the single most important biomarker to predict the decrease of exacerbation by ICS [28]. Recently, interests in precision medicine according to the subtype of COPD, rather than ACO is increasing. Blood eosinophil count is considered as the reliable biomarker in identifying subtype that might be benefitted by ICS. Although we did not find meaningful relation between FEV1 change and ICS use in eosinophilic COPD in real world data, additional prospective studies will be needed.\nThere were several limitations in this study. First, we analyzed subsequent 2\u00a0years of FEV1 data, which is a relatively short follow-up period. Second, we defined eosinophilic COPD using blood eosinophil counts at a stable period, and variation over time were not reflected. Third, COPD patients in our study were enrolled irrespective of treatment- na\u00efve status. Whether blood eosinophil count less than or over 300cell/\u03bcL, the prescription rate for ICS containing inhalers was similar, which implies considerable numbers of subjects who have already been exposed to ICS are included, and this might be related to attenuation of ICS effects on eosinophilic COPD. Fourth, this was not a randomized clinical trial. Although the prescription rate for ICS containing inhalers was similar in both groups (41.1% and 40.7% in non-eosinophilic and eosinophilic groups, respectively.), ICS containing inhalers was not randomly assigned. ICS prescription was decided by pulmonologists. Thus, there can be a bias for the prescription of ICS. Caution is needed to interpret the impact of ICS on eosinophilic COPD. Fifth, changes in FEV1 according to GOLD classification could not be performed because approximately 90% of subjects were in GOLD group A or B. Lastly, we aimed to assess the rate of decline of FEV1 according to blood eosinophil count and whether FEV1 decline differs between eosinophilic COPD with and without ICS. Whittaker et\u00a0al. [29] reported ICS use is associated with slower rates of FEV1 decline in COPD regardless of blood eosinophil level in a cohort of 26,675 COPD patients. On the other hand, Celli et\u00a0 al. [30] reported ICS plus LABA combination or the component, reduces the rate of decline of FEV1 in moderate to severe COPD. This study included more than 1,000 patients in each of subgroups. However, our study is underpowered to address intended questions about rate of decline of FEV1 due to small number of subjects."

ICS use did not have any beneficial effects on FEV1 change in eosinophilic COPD, but FEV1 decreased more rapidly with ICS use. Further studies with longer follow-up periods in larger number of patients are required."
