 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate how the multi-mode enhancement effect depends on other parameters of the system, such as the donor-acceptor coupling strength, cavity dimensions, and transition dipole orientation. The paper currently only explores the dependence on reaction energetics. 

2. Extend the theoretical framework to non-equilibrium situations, for example by incorporating time-dependent external driving fields. This could allow modeling of photo-induced charge transfer in cavities.

3. Explore the effects of vibronic coupling between the cavity modes and the molecular nuclear degrees of freedom. The current model assumes these are uncoupled, but vibronic coupling could significantly impact the multi-mode enhancement.

4. Apply the theoretical model to simulate experimental cavity-modified electron transfer rates for specific molecular systems, and compare to experimental measurements. This could help validate and refine the model.

5. Investigate the effects of cavity losses, decoherence, and non-Markovian dynamics, which are neglected in the simple Marcus theory model. Incorporating these effects could lead to a more realistic model for cavity-controlled chemistry.
