If this contraction leads to impaired joint mobility, one speaks of contracture. To optimize treatment, a mathematical model, that is based on finite element methods, is developed. Since the finite element-based simulation of skin contraction can be expensive from a computational point of view, we use machine learning to replace these simulations such that we have a cheap alternative. The current study deals with a feed-forward neural network that we trained with 2D finite element simulations based on morphoelasticity. We focus on the evolution of the scar shape, wound area, and total strain energy, a measure of discomfort, over time. The results show average goodness of fit (R2) of 0.9979 and a tremendous speedup of 1815000X. Further, we illustrate the applicability of the neural network in an online medical app that takes the patient\u2019s age into account.\nKEYWORDS\nmachine learning, post-burn scar contraction, morphoelasticity, feed\u2013forward neural network, online application, Monte Carlo simulations\nIntroduction\nLong-term contraction in burn injuries can lead to reduced joint mobilities. During this phenomenon, the wound reduces in size and deforms because of myofibroblasts (dermal cells) that contract. If the contraction of a scar leads to impairment of joint mobility, this is called scar contracture. Patient- and burn-specific factors influence contraction, such as the patient\u2019s age and gender, and the burn\u2019s size, depth, and location. These differences between burns and patients lead to the growing interest in personalized healthcare. Without medical care, a patient may have difficulty exercising or with simple daily activities, which we wish to prevent.\nThe theory of the physiological evolution of burned skin contains quantitative connections that are represented in mathematical relations. To give insight into significant elements influencing the contraction, we use detailed models such that we can tune these elements. We can use Monte Carlo simulations to assess the parameter\u2019s uncertainties, allowing for patient-specific predictions necessary for the clinic. However, high-dimensional mathematical models are expensive, a downside since many model-based predictions are needed to achieve personalized healthcare. Hence, we must use and develop alternatives to predict Monto Carlobased post-burn contractions.\nNeural networks can reflect complex relationships within a limited evaluation time after suitable training [1], which has been beneficial for years in the clinic. For example, Tran et al. have used computer vision to classify skin burns [2] and to classify tumors [3]. Furthermore,\nFrontiers in AppliedMathematics and Statistics 01 frontiersin.org\nBrinati et al. have used neural networks to find diseases, such as the COVID-19 disease, in blood samples [4].\nOur mathematical framework models deep skin burns in which the skin\u2019s dermis has burned. This framework focuses on post-burn contraction in this deep layer of the skin. The displacement of the dermis generates strains. Briefly, the model includes the structure of nine connected, non-linear partial differential equations. Four equations represent biochemical quantities, such as cell densities (two types), the concentration of signaling molecules, and collagen density. The other five equations track the entries of the strain matrix and the components of the velocity vector. The interaction between model variables reduces the wound/scar size, which we relate to the damaged tissue\u2019s relative surface area (RSA) density. Next to the RSA, we define the total strain energy (TSE) density, a measure of patient discomfort. In addition to our previous work in Egberts et al. [5], where we only predicted the evolution of the RSA, in this study, we train neural networks to predict the TSE and the wound/scar boundary. Others also used such surrogate models. For example, Cai et al. used three machine learning methods named K-nearest neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for parameter estimation of left ventricular myocardium [6]. The prediction of stress-strain curves for materials can be speededup by a convolutional neural network [7]. Further, neural networks can surpass other, non-intelligent acceleration techniques on both acceleration and accuracy [8]. In particular, Navratil et al. compare neural networks to other methods to accelerate the physics-based simulations in oil reservoir modeling and show a possible speedup of 2000X. In addition, neural networks reduces the average sequence error by two orders of magnitude.\nThis study explores using neural networks to replace the expensive finite-element predictions of post-burn contraction and patient discomfort. We apply the neural networks to the twodimensional mathematical model because this two-dimensional model is expensive from a computational point of view.We construct a large dataset using our numerical approach by a Bayesian-like variation of parameter values. Then, we feed this dataset to feedforward neural networks with two hidden layers. The resulting optimized networks are then implemented in an online application that illustrates possible future use.\nIn this article, Section 2 presents the mathematical model and its numerical implementation, and Section 3 presents the neural network. Subsequently, Section 4 presents the results and the illustrative (medical) application. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions, and Section 6 presents the discussion and further work."

This model resembles post-burn contraction by dealing with chemical feedback that induces the skin\u2019s permanent displacement and the remaining effective Eulerian strain. The model takes the chemical feedback utilizing four chemical variables: the fibroblasts (N), the myofibroblasts (M), the signaling molecules (c), and collagen (\u03c1). Post-burn healing is initiated by releasing growth factors and cytokines (signaling molecules) that influence cell proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, chemotaxis, and the synthesis and decay of collagen. For the cells, we consider migration toward\nthe gradient of the signaling molecules [10] by a minimal model for chemotaxis [11], and cell density-dependent Fickian diffusion (random walk).

This equation represents the balance of momentum. Here \u03c1t represents the total mass density of the dermal tissues, \u03be is the generated stress per unit cell density and the inverse of the unit collagen concentration, and R is a body forceinhibiting constant. From a mechanical point of view, we assume the tissue to be isotropic and homogeneous, except for a dependency of the stiffness on the local collagen density [13]. The visco-elastic relation for the dermal stress is: \u03c3 = \u00b51sym(\u2207v)+ \u00b52(tr(sym(\u2207v))I)+ E \u221a \u03c1\n1+ \u03bd\n[\n\u03b5 + tr(\u03b5) \u03bd\n1\u2212 2\u03bd I\n]\n,\n(6)\nwhere \u00b51,\u00b52 are the shear and bulk viscosity, respectively, E \u221a \u03c1 represents Young\u2019s modulus (stiffness), and \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio.\nFinally, the equation for the effective Eulerian strain is:\nD\u03b5 Dt + (tr(\u03b5)\u2212 1)sym(\u2207v) = \u2212G = \u2212\u03b6 [N + \u03b7IIM]c 1+ aIIIc c \u03b5, (7)\nwhere D\u03b5 Dt = D\u03b5Dt + \u03b5skw(L) \u2212 skw(L)\u03b5 is the Jaumann time derivative, and G is a growth contribution tensor. In the case of burns, it considers permanent deformation (in this case contraction) and permanent strains as a result of the changes in the chemical constitution of collagen. In the case of tissue of tumor development, it considers the actual growth. The parameter \u03b6 is the rate of morphoelastic change.\nConsidering the boundary conditions, let \u2202 x the boundary of\nthe computational domain. Then, for all time t and for all x \u2208 \u2202 x:\nN(x, t) = Neq, M(x, t) = Meq, c(x, t) = ceq, and v(x, t) = 0. (8) It is unnecessary to specify any boundary conditions for \u03c1 and \u03b5 because of overdetermination since we use v(x, t) = 0 on the boundary.\nWe solve the mathematical model utilizing the finite element method with linear basis functions. We apply the backward Euler method for time integration. We account for non-linearity by using inner Picard iterations. Further initial conditions and numerical methods are not essential for this work and are explained in detail in our earlier study [5].\nRelative surface area and total strain energy\nDuring wound healing, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts that exhibit contractile properties. Myofibroblasts express \u03b1-SM actin in microfilament bundles or stress fibers [14] that interact with the cell\u2019s surrounding tissue. If myofibroblasts disappear because of cell death, this contractile mechanism dies with the cell, and hence, the scar is not subject to this active myofibroblast contraction anymore. In the mathematical model, the scar remodels to equilibrium once the applied stress (active contraction) is released, and during this remodeling, the scar retracts. Therefore, the injured tissue\u2019s relative surface area (RSA) changes. One typical feature is the RSA density is its minimum value that corresponds with the maximum contraction during healing. After this moment, the RSA density converges to an asymptotic value, another typical feature of the RSA, as the scar remodels. The asymptotic RSA value shows the intensity of contraction after scar remodeling that might show a possible contracture.\nThe RSA density was compared to the average of clinical measurements of the RSA of placed unmeshed skin grafts after both early and late excision of burned skin data from Hadidy et al. [15] in Koppenol et al. [9]. For particular combinations of values for \u03b6 and aIIIc that directly relate to the tensor G (Equation 7), a good fit between the numerical method and the clinical data was obtained. We would like to train the neural network on clinical (non-synthetic) data, however, these data have privacy issues and it is not easy to find enough of that data.\nContracting wounds and scars lead to stress and strain on the skin, which can hypothetically lead to irritation (pain) and tingling sensations. The stress we refer to is the total strain energy we assume to measure patient discomfort. The total strain energy (TSE) is defined by the integral over the strain energy density (per unit volume) [16]. A typical feature of the TSE density is its maximum, i.e., the maximum post-burn discomfort that a patient might experience."

Figure 2 shows the best and the worst predictions for the MSE, the worst prediction relative errors, and the relationship between the predicted and target values in the RSA test set. Figure 2A shows the optimal prediction, where the RSA prediction mostly overlaps the RSA target for the first 130 days and underestimates slightly during the wound healing remodeling phase. In the worst-case scenario, shown in Figure 2B, the neural network shows a delay during contraction and retraction and overestimation during remodeling. Theminimum shifted to day 58, compared to day 52 in the RSA target. During remodeling, the overestimation is about 1% less contraction. The worst prediction relative error increases to 9.4% and converges to about 1.39% for the last predicted value, as shown in Figure 2C. The error peaks around day 30, during steep contraction, while the relative error around themoment of maximum contraction is <1%. Finally, Figure 2D shows the (target, prediction) distribution follows the y = x line. Outliers are because of the worst prediction. The spread in the range 0.75 \u2264 x \u2264 0.95 shows that the neural network could have trouble predicting contraction values between these values.\nFrontiers in AppliedMathematics and Statistics 04 frontiersin.org\nFigure 3 shows the best and the worst predictions for MSE, the worst prediction relative error, and the relationship between the predicted and target values in the TSE test set. In the best-case scenario, the TSE prediction mostly overlaps the TSE target, except for the maximum TSE around day 50, as Figure 3A shows a slight overestimation. In the worst-case scenario, shown in Figure 3B, the prediction by the neural network is almost indistinguishable from the TSE target value. Figure 3C shows the relative error of the worst TSE prediction and shows a maximum increase to 0.53% on day 23, which is negligible. Finally, Figure 2D shows that the (target and prediction) distribution follows the y = x line. The spread in the lower range shows that the neural network could have trouble predicting small TSE values and that larger values occur sporadically.\nThe RSA only provides information about the general contraction and lacks any information about localized contractions. Using the displacement of the wound/scar edge, we can also visualize the contraction and retraction of the wound/scar. Visualizing this movement is intuitively more straightforward to interpret than numeric values. Figure 4 shows the results of the neural network we trained to predict the wound/scar boundary. Here, we display targets and predictions on days 5, 25, 50, 75, and 365, with the targets in blue and the predictions in red. The days are shown in the average relative error for the best and worst predictions.We can see that in the case of the best prediction (upper graphs), the prediction follows the target closely. For the worst prediction (lower graphs), the prediction\nshows a slight deviation from the target boundary (less contraction) in the early phase of contraction, before maximum contraction has not been reached yet (day 25). Here, the predicted wound boundary is larger than the target boundary, which is also in line with the trend in Figure 2B. Further, the graphs show that the neural network can closely predict the wound/scar boundary.\nIn Table 1, we show the performances of the neural networks. We see that we obtained R2 \u2265 0.9969 for all networks, which fits within the 95% interval of confidence. The aRRMSEs are 0.0787, 0.0864, and 0.0825 for the RSA, the TSE, and the wound/scar boundary, respectively, showing excellent performance according to Despotovic et al. [21]. The aRelErrs are only 0.018, 1.4919, and 0.0020%, confirming that the neural networks can predict the RSA, the TSE, and the wound/scar boundary. Subsequently, the networks predict 1,000 samples in only 0.2744 s (i.e., 0.2744 ms/sample). In contrast, the numerical simulations take, on average, 498 s per sample. Hence, we obtain a speedup of 1815000X, showing a remarkable acceleration. Taken together, these results confirm our observations.\nFocusing on specific characteristics during post-burn healing makes interpreting the neural network performances easier and is interesting in the clinic. These characteristics are the minimum and the asymptotic RSA values and the maximum TSE value, for which the performances are shown in Table 2.

Therefore, we study neural networks that serve as a lowcost alternative modeling strategy. After training, these neural networks provide compelling predictions for a post-burn scar. Our\nnetworks give aRellErr = 0.0018, 1.4919, and 0.0020% and R2 = 0.9983, 0.9984, and 0.9969 for the RSA, the TSE, and the wound/scar boundary. Further, the networks accurately predict theminimum and asymptotic RSA values and the maximum TSE values. The minimum RSA reports MAE = 0.0016 and R2 = 0.9989; for the final RSA, it reports MAE = 0.0009 and R2 = 0.9965; and for the maximum TSSE, it reports MAE = 0.0029 and R2 = 0.9990.\nFurthermore, this machine learning approach gives a 1815000X speedup. This speedup allows for the Monte Carlo-based example application we developed and published. Our application considers the patient\u2019s age, demonstrating its effect on post-burn contraction and patient discomfort. Clinicians can tailor complication-dependent therapies if they can access such an application that predicts complications after a burn efficiently and reliably. Clinicians can then predict probabilities of success under various treatments and pathological circumstances. Given that the neural networks are effective and inexpensive, we can also use such an application for parameter studies and patient-oriented healthcare to optimize burn treatment."

The current model describes clinical observations smartly, though the model still needs to be completed. Let yc represent clinical measurement, y denote the simulations by the finite element method, and f (x; \u03b8) represent the predictions by the neural network model. Then, we realize that the total error between the neural network model and clinical observations is determined by\n\u2016yc \u2212 f (x; \u03b8)\u2016 = \u2016yc \u2212 y+ y\u2212 f (x; \u03b8)\u2016 \u2264 \u2016yc \u2212 y\u2016 + \u2016y\u2212 f (x; \u03b8)\u2016.\nHence the overall error is bounded by the sum of the modeling error and the neural network error. In a future model, we want to implement the distinct collagen types and integrate the functioning of the immune system, which are significant factors influencing post-burn healing and scar formation. Besides the wound shape, three-dimensional models are capable of dealing with the depth of the wound. However, the numerical computational complexity is a drawback because of a decreasing mesh quality and the curse of dimensionality. These drawbacks can be solved by rotational symmetry and isogeometric analysis.\nBecause machine learning computations provide such a speedup, we expect this to be the way to integrate simulations into medical practice. Once we have further developed the numerical concepts, a practitioner can scan the burn, for example, using laser Doppler to map the blood flow in the wound. This scan contains the form (geometry) of the injury and its severity (in terms of blood flow). Such a scan can also include noise that we can filter using image processing, which may be kernel-based or machine-learning based.\nConvolutional neural networks that work with images of the initial burn can fit the wound. For this, we need to extract contours and other features, which we can do with pixel-based statistics, shape similarity [22], and shape matching [23]. Further, the prediction of post-burn contraction is less complicated for standard geometries, such as squares and circles. We can use factors such as shape indices to integrate with these standard geometric objects. The edge error can measure such a mapping error [24]. In reality, burns do not heal at the same rates. Also, contractures can develop again after applied treatments dissolve these. In these instances, we need predictions over other periods. Hence, we need a network that can work with variable input and output, and therefore, we can use hybrid approaches (e.g., long-term memory). However, we still need a sizeable clinical dataset to train such a model.\nNext to adapting the mathematical model and consider different neural network approaches, we plan to combine these finite element simulations with real patient-specific data to predict, to adapt and to improve therapies for burn injuries next to the common sense of clinicians. For this, we will collect clinical datasets from anonymized patients, including patient-observed data (POSAS)."
