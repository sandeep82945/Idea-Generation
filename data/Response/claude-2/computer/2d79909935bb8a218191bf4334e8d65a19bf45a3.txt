 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of AI on GTFP in other countries beyond China to see if the findings hold in different institutional contexts. 

2. Investigate the mechanisms through which AI improves GTFP, such as by reducing emissions or improving resource efficiency. Detailed case studies could provide insights.

3. Explore the optimal level of slack resources for maximizing the impact of AI on GTFP. Too many slack resources may reduce efficiency.

4. Consider other emerging digital technologies beyond AI, such as blockchain, IoT, or cloud computing, and their impacts on GTFP.

5. Conduct research on GTFP at the industry or regional level to complement the firm-level analysis. Understanding GTFP drivers across levels would be valuable.
