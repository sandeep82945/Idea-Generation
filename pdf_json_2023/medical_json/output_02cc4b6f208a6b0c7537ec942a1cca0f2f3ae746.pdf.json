Then try and focus on what matters most,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAlgorithmic medicine does not work in people with complex medical problems, so listen to your patient.\u201d\nPollock also tells her trainees not to avoid difficult conversations. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of talking about death and dying\u2014to lots of people that\u2019s a great relief. Make sure you know what your patient wants.\u201d\nPollock, a consultant geriatrician at Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, was born into a medical family\u2014her father was a geriatrician and her mother an ophthalmologist\u2014so she knew early on that a career in medicine would be hard work but rewarding.\n\u201cMy father really liked people and found great joy and humour in the dealings he had with his patients,\u201d she recalls.\nGraduating from St Bartholomew\u2019s Medical School in 1990, Pollock worked as a junior doctor in London before moving to Somerset, where she completed her specialist training and took up her consultant post in 2001.\nPollock has held several clinical lead anddirector roles and says that anyone consideringmedical leadership should know that life will never be quite the same again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to get some training before stepping into one of these roles, and to work out who your support network is going to be, what motivates the people above you, and in what format they\u2019re going to need information,\u201d she says. \u201cBuckle in, it\u2019s hard\u2014choose your battles, and if you\u2019re losing that battle, go and fight it a different way.\u201d\nPollock recently published The Book About Getting Older, which aims to empower patients with information. \u201cI realised a long time ago that too often I had the power in the room, and my patient and their family didn\u2019t,\u201d she explains. \u201cI felt strongly that that needed redressing. I wanted to give people that power and the information they needed in a palatable way.\u201d\nShe honed the skills needed to write a book through writing clinic letters. These letters can be a therapeutic device when done well, Pollock believes, and she often uses them to reassure carers that they are doing a good job. \u201cLots of older people care for other older people and it can be a lonely job,\u201d she says. \u201cA phrase I often use is: \u2018You are doing all the right things.\u2019 That\u2019s an important message.\u201d\nOutside of work, Pollock loves reading, music, and spending time outdoors. She has, in her own words, lots of very funny friends and enjoys doing lots of things not very well. This, she says, helps her to have a sunny disposition. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m always happy; I think the pandemic has left its mark on all of us. But optimism is a much more productive state of mind than pessimism.\u201d"
