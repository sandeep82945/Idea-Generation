    "abstractText": "A group of di(arylcarbazole)-substituted oxetanes has been prepared in Suzuki reactions by using the key starting material 3,3-di[3-iodocarbazol-9-yl]methyloxetane and various boronic acids (fluorophenylboronic acid, phenylboronic acid or naphthalene-1-boronic acid). Full characterization of their structure has been presented. The low molar mass compounds represent materials having high thermal stability with 5% mass loss thermal degradation temperatures in the range of 371\u2013391 \u25e6C. Glass transition temperatures of the materials are also very high and range from 107 \u25e6C to 142 \u25e6C, which is a big advantage for formation of stable amorphous layers for optoelectronic devices, i.e., organic light emitting diodes. Hole transporting properties of the prepared materials were confirmed in formed organic light emitting diodes with tris(quinolin-8olato)aluminium (Alq3) as a green emitter, which also served as an electron transporting layer. In the device\u2019s materials, 3,3-di[3-phenylcarbazol-9-yl]methyloxetane (5) and 3,3-di[3-(1-naphthyl)carbazol9-yl]methyloxetane (6) demonstrated superior hole transporting properties than that of material 3,3-di[3-(4-flourophenyl)carbazol-9-yl]methyloxetane (4) based device. When material 5 was used in the device structure, the OLED demonstrated rather low turn-on voltage of 3.7 V, luminous efficiency of 4.2 cd/A, power efficiency of 2.6 lm/W and maximal brightness exceeding 11670 cd/m2. HTL of 6 based device also showed exclusive OLED characteristics. The device was characterized by turn-on voltage of 3.4 V, maximum brightness of 13193 cd/m2, luminous efficiency of 3.8 cd/A and power efficiency of 2.6 lm/W. An additional hole injecting-transporting layer (HI-TL) of PEDOT considerably improved functions of the device with HTL of compound 4. The modified OLED with a layer of the derivative 4 demonstrated exclusive characteristics with turn-on voltage of 3.9 V, high luminous efficiency of 4.7 cd/A, power efficiency of 2.6 lm/W and maximal brightness exceeding 21,000 cd/m2. These observations confirmed that the prepared materials have a big potential in the field of optoelectronics.",

It is well known that multilayer structure devices having a hole transporting layer (HTL), emitting layer and electron transporting layer should be formed for efficient light emission [8\u201311]. One method that is very widely used to improve efficiencies of the OLED devices is the insertion of effective hole transporting layers in the construction of the OLEDs [12\u201315]. The positive charge transporting materials could be of low molar mass [16\u201318] or polymeric derivatives having\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2282. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28052282 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2282 2 of 9\nelectroactive chromophores attached to the main polymeric chains [19\u201321]. Polymeric materials usually have high thermal stability, which is an important characteristic for application in OLEDs, and form more homogenous amorphous films; however, the materials have more impurities because they cannot be purified by using chromatographic methods, which is an advantage in the case of low molar mass derivatives. On the other hand, thermal stability of the low molecular weight derivatives and stability of their amorphous films could be increased by introducing oxetane rings in structures of the mentioned derivatives. The planar structure of such derivatives minimizes the strain in the ring, and there are gauche interactions between the molecules, which increase thermal stability of the materials as well as stability of amorphous films [22\u201324]. Solution processed low molar mass derivatives containing substituted carbazole fragments are among the most studied materials for application in positive charge transporting layers due to their good chemical and environmental stability as well as high hole mobility [25\u201327]. We have reported earlier that aryl-substituted carbazoles demonstrate suitable ionization potentials and positive charge transporting properties for application in OLED devices; however, the materials had an evident tendency for crystallization [28]. Here, we report on oxetanes containing aryl-substituted carbazole fragments as electroactive chromophores. The materials demonstrated high thermal stability with high glass transition temperatures. They were tested as hole transporting layers in OLEDs with an Alq3 emitter, with preparation of layers for the devices by spin-coating from solutions."

The characteristics of a device with PEDOT as HI-TL material are also presented in the Table for comparison of the properties.\nIt is evident that OLEDs using HTL materials 5 and 6 demonstrated similar and better OLED characteristics as compared with those of devices using HTL of derivative 4. The rather high turn-on voltages (Von) of material 4 based devices using various thicknesses of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2282 6 of 9\nthe layers could confirm that there are inappropriate hole injecting properties of positive charges from ITO anode into HTL of 4. On the other hand, materials 5 and 6 demonstrated superior OLED characteristics to those of the material 4 based device. When 40 nm layer of material 5 was used in an analogous device structure, the OLED demonstrated rather low turn-on voltage of 3.7 V, luminous efficiency of 4.2 cd/A, power efficiency of 2.6 lm/W and maximal brightness exceeding 11,670 cd/m2. The HTL material 6 based device also showed exclusive OLED characteristics. In addition, 40 nm HTL using devices could be characterized by turn-on voltage of 3.4 V, maximum brightness of 13,193 cd/m2, luminous efficiency of 3.8 cd/A and power efficiency of 2.6 lm/W. It can be seen from Table 1 that these characteristics are promising as compared to those of analogous devices using a commercial HI-TL layer of PEDOT, and the materials 5 and 6 are well suited for application in HTL. In order to further improve characteristics of the OLEDs, devices of structure ITO/ PEDOT/HTL of material 4, 5 or 6 (40-60-80 nm)/Alq3/LiF/Al using 40 nm of additional HI-TL of PEDOT were formed and characterized. It was observed that the additional layer of PEDOT did not have a noticeable influence for characteristics of devices using HTLs of derivatives 5 and 6. However, the layer considerably improved functions of the device with HTL of compound 4. The luminance\u2013voltage and current efficiency\u2013luminance characteristics of the devices ITO/PEDOT/HTL of 4 (40-60-80 nm)/Alq3/LiF/Al are presented in Figure 5. The modified OLED using 40 nm layer of derivative 4 demonstrated exclusive characteristics with turn-on voltage of 3.9 V, high luminous efficiency of 4.7 cd/A, power efficiency of 2.6 lm/W and maximal brightness exceeding 21,000 cd/m2. This observation confirmed that the additional HI-TL in combination with HTL of compound 4 could strongly improve characteristics of the described devices. In the general case, efficiencies of the described OLEDs are rather high. Earlier, we had investigated the very widely used commercial hole transporting material N,N\u2032-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N\u2032-bis(phenyl)benzidine (NPB). It was used as the HTL material in analogous devices, which are described in the paper. Maximal luminous efficiency of the OLED using NPB reached only 2.7 cd/A [31]. It should also be pointed out that these OLED data were measured in non-optimized test devices. The efficiencies may be further improved by an optimization of device formation conditions and by encapsulation of the OLEDs [32].
