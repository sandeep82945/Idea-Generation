    "abstractText": "Background In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) the scarcity of local cost data is a key barrier to conducting health economic evaluations. We systematically reviewed reports of disease-related costs from MENA and analysed their transferability within the region. Methods We searched PubMed and included full text English papers that reported disease-related costs from the local populations of Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen between 1995 and 2019. Screening, study selection and data extraction were done in duplicate. Study-related variables, costing methods, all costs and their characteristics were extracted and analysed via descriptive methods. From multi-country studies of MENA employing homogenous costing methods, we estimated the ratio (cost transfer coefficient) between the relative differences in direct medical costs and macroeconomic indicators via robust regression. We predicted each cost via the estimated cost transfer formula and evaluated prediction error between true and predicted (transferred) costs. Results The search yielded 1646 records, 206 full text papers and 3525 costs from 84 diagnoses. Transferability was analysed involving 144 direct medical costs from eight multi-country studies. Adjusting the average of available foreign costs by 0.28 times the relative difference in GDP per capita provided the most accurate estimates. The correlation between true and predicted costs was 0.96; 68% of predicted costs fell in the true \u00b1 50% range. Predictions were more accurate for costs from studies that involved the largest number of countries, for countries outside the Gulf region and for drug costs versus unit or disease costs. Conclusion The estimated cost transfer formula allows the prediction of missing costs in MENA if only GDP per capita is available for adjustment to the local setting. Input costs for the formula should be collected from multiple sources and match the decision situation. Plain Language Summary In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) scarce local cost data hinder health economic evaluations. This systematic review summarized disease-related costs from 17 countries (Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen). Eight studies applied the same costing method across multiple countries. We used these data to estimate a formula for transferring costs between countries. We assumed that costs vary proportionally with gross domestic product per capita (GDP). Most accurate cost predictions were provided when relative cost differences were set to 0.28-times the relative differences in GDP per capita. The correlation between transferred and true costs was very high. Still, only 68% of transferred costs fell in the true \u00b1 50% range. Cost estimates were more accurate if costs were transferred from multiple countries. Also, estimates were more accurate for countries outside the Gulf region and for drug costs when compared to unitor disease costs. * Zsombor Zrubka zrubka.zsombor@uni-obuda.hu Extended author information available on the last page of the article 588 Z. Zrubka et al. Key Points for Decision Makers Between MENA countries, disease-related costs vary less than GDP per capita. Cost differences between countries were proportional to 0.28-times the differences in GDP per capita. When only GDP-based adjustments are feasible, for most accurate predictions, transferred costs should be adjusted by this factor. 68% of such estimates fell in the true cost \u00b1 50% range. Therefore, wide error margins should be applied in sensitivity analysis. Predictions were more accurate if costs were available from multiple countries, if predictions were made for non-Gulf countries and for drug costs versus unit or disease costs.",

This systematic review summarized disease-related costs from 17 countries (Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen). Eight studies applied the same costing method across multiple countries. We used these data to estimate a formula for transferring costs between countries. We assumed that costs vary proportionally with gross domestic product per capita (GDP). Most accurate cost predictions were provided when relative cost differences were set to 0.28-times the relative differences in GDP per capita. The correlation between transferred and true costs was very high. Still, only 68% of transferred costs fell in the true \u00b1\u00a050% range. Cost estimates were more accurate if costs were transferred from multiple countries. Also, estimates were more accurate for countries outside the Gulf region and for drug costs when compared to unit- or disease costs.\n* Zsombor Zrubka zrubka.zsombor@uni-obuda.hu\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\nKey Points for Decision Makers\nBetween MENA countries, disease-related costs vary less than GDP per capita. Cost differences between countries were proportional to 0.28-times the differences in GDP per capita. When only GDP-based adjustments are feasible, for most accurate predictions, transferred costs should be adjusted by this factor.\n68% of such estimates fell in the true cost \u00b1\u00a050% range. Therefore, wide error margins should be applied in sensitivity analysis.\nPredictions were more accurate if costs were available from multiple countries, if predictions were made for non-Gulf countries and for drug costs versus unit or disease costs."

            "text": "Depending on the definition, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region includes 19\u201335 countries, including some of the wealthiest and poorest in the world, comprising up to 6% of the global population and 4.5% of the global economy [1\u20133]. In the past decade, MENA countries have made substantial progress in improving their health systems and enhancing the health outcomes of their populations. However, the structure and financing of healthcare systems is rather heterogenous in the region. While high-income countries maintain state-of the art hospitals and universal coverage, lower income countries in the region are struggling to build their healthcare systems [4]. Overall, in most MENA countries, the proportion of GDP spent on healthcare is below the global average and the share of out-of-pocket spending within total health expenditure exceeds the global average [5].\nHealth technology assessment (HTA) is \u201ca multidisciplinary process that uses explicit methods to determine the value of a health technology at different points in its lifecycle [6]\u201d. As a means to inform decision making in order to promote equitable, efficient, and high-quality health systems [6], HTA has been recognized as an important tool in the pursuit of universal health coverage and sustainable healthcare financing worldwide [7]. In MENA, despite the growing interest from countries, the implementation of HTA is still in its early stage [8]. Health economic evaluations in MENA have been systematically reviewed in multiple studies [9\u201313]. In addition to limited funding as well as organizational and human resource barriers, a commonly\ncited constraint to the implementation of HTA in the region is the limited availability of relevant local data on costs and outcomes [9, 10, 12\u201314].\nIn the context of health economic evaluations, transferability generally refers to the feasibility of adjustments both for varying location/country-specific input parameters, and decision-maker-specific methodological requirements that provide valid estimates for a specific country using foreign studies when local studies are lacking [15\u201317]. Clinical outcomes are usually transferable between countries. However, the transferability of cost data is challenging due to the significant inter-country variability in demography, epidemiology, economic performance, healthcare systems, unit costs, financing mechanisms and healthcare practice patterns [15, 16, 18]. In general, the more detailed and transparent the reporting, the more likely that results of health economic evaluations can be transferred internationally [19, 20]. As such, several studies have explored the transferability of costs between jurisdictions [21\u201325]. Despite being a crucial aspect for the development of HTA in MENA, the transferability of costs within the region has not yet been systematically studied.\nTherefore, this systematic review was undertaken to identify studies that report disease-related costs from MENA [26]. We describe the published costs and estimate a cost transfer formula that allows the prediction of missing direct medical costs using macroeconomic indicators. Finally, we analyse the prediction accuracy for transferred costs."

For the analysis of cost transferability, we selected the subset of articles that reported the same costs from multiple MENA countries as described below. The PRISMA guidelines were followed when reporting results [27] (Online Supplementary Material (OSM) File 1, Table\u00a0S1). No ethics approvals were needed for the study.\nA literature search in PubMed database was carried out up to 15 December 2019 using the filter of English language and full-text journal articles and combining the countries as well as the list of keywords related to general descriptions, key methods and main outcomes of health economic analysis. The detailed search strategy is included in OSM File 1 (Table\u00a0S2).\nAbstracts and titles were screened for eligibility by two independent researchers, discrepancies were resolved by consensus. English language full-text articles of original research on humans were eligible for our review if the studies concerned the local population of the respective MENA countries, and costs were reported in monetary units between 1995 and 2019. In addition, we identified four systematic reviews of health economic studies from MENA and included eligible studies from their reference lists.

Motivated by\nthe rapid de facto HTA assessments applied for Eastern Europe and other resource-limited settings [18, 30, 31], we assumed that missing costs can be imputed after adjusting only for a single macroeconomic indicator, such as gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc), total health expenditure per capita (THEpc) or governmental health expenditure per capita (GHEpc). To emphasize the use of per capita values, macroeconomic indicators are denoted as MIpc. We assumed that within the region, the relative differences of costs between countries (RDCost) are proportional to relative differences in macroeconomic indicators (RDMIpc) to a factor \u03b2MI, denoted as the cost transfer coefficient for a given macroeconomic indicator. This assumption is formally written as:\nEq. (1) can be expanded as follows:\nwhere the left side of the equation is the relative difference of costs, and the right side is the relative difference in the macroeconomic indicators, multiplied by the cost transfer coefficient (i.e., the factor of proportionality). To eliminate the variability caused by different costing methods [32], we calculated relative differences of costs from studies, which measured the same cost in multiple MENA countries and applied the same costing methodology in the same costing year. Such costs are denoted as Costx. In Eq. (2) Costx,i denotes Costx measured in country i and Costx,j\u2260i denotes the mean of Costx for all countries where it was reported, except country i. With similar indexing, MIpcx,i denotes the per-capita macroeconomic indicator measured in purchaseparity international dollars (PPP$) in country i in the costing year of Costx where MIpc can be replaced by GDPpc, THEpc and GHEpc.

We used robust regression models, which are less sensitive to outliers than ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, providing more precise fit on the majority of data points while allowing greater errors for outliers [35]. First, we applied an M-estimator with iteratively reweighted least squares [35, 36]. Second, we used quantile regression, which estimates the conditional median of the dependent variable. Third, we applied interval regression, which estimates parameters by assuming that values of the dependent variable fall anywhere between a lower and an upper limit [37]. We estimated the cost transfer coefficient by setting the interval limits to true cost \u00b1\u00a030% (see below). We emphasize that cost transfer coefficient estimates apply only to situations where costs are collected with the same methods in the same costing year in multiple countries.\nBy rewriting Eq. (1), the missing cost for a country can be predicted by the following cost transfer formula:\nWhere C\u0302ostx,i denotes the predicted cost. Equation (2) suggests that if \u03b2 = 0 (i.e., costs do not vary with the macroeconomic indicator), then C\u0302ostx,i = C\u0302ostx,j\u2260i and the missing cost could be imputed using the mean of available costs from other MENA countries (given that costs were measured by\n(3)C\u0302OSTx,i =\n(\n1 + MIpcx,i \u2212MIpcx,j\u2260i\nMIpcx,j\u2260i\n\u00d7 Costx,j\u2260i\n)\nthe same method in the same costing year).

Also, the large number of publications reflected that in several MENA countries the prevalence of diabetes [53] and in Egypt the prevalence of hepatitis C infection is among the highest in the world [54]. The potential transferability of these costs deserves further research.\nTransferability issues have been widely studied for indirect costs of chronic diseases [55, 56], costs collected in various study settings [17, 23], different disease conditions [24, 25, 57] or within geographic regions [58, 59]. Numerous adjustment methods [17, 21, 22, 57], factors of\ntransferability [16] as well as reporting guidelines [15, 20, 60] have been proposed for health economic evaluations. The analysis of patient-level data suggests that the variance of total costs is mainly attributable to individual patients [17, 21]. Studies in Central-Eastern Europe have demonstrated considerable differences in treatment practices involving the same condition, despite the rather similar economic profile of countries [61, 62]. When imputing missing costs, several methods have been proposed from using unadjusted averages of adjacent countries [23], using country-pair specific ratios based on the comparison of known baskets of healthcare goods or services [23, 57] or adjustments by GDP per capita [18, 30, 31]. Unit costs of in- and outpatient services have been estimated via econometric modelling for the WHO CHOICE project using input from 30 countries [63].\nWe assumed that the secondary usability of published costs in the region is low due to the general lack of data on patient- or location-specific transferability factors as well as the methodological and reporting heterogeneity of costing studies. Therefore, we aimed to develop a cost transfer formula that allows the prediction of missing costs if the same cost is reported from at least one country in the region.\nThe strength of our proposed approach is its simplicity and the universal availability of GDP per capita data for the adjustment of input costs. Furthermore, our transferability analysis was based on a comprehensive set of data reported from the region. We note that the cost transfer formula is applicable for predicting missing patient-level direct medical costs, given that input costs are measured with the same methodology in the same costing year. We also emphasize that the cost transfer formula is based on adjustment by a single macroeconomic indicator and should only be used if more comprehensive cost transfer methods are not feasible. Input costs should be carefully selected to ensure fit into the analysis. As a minimum requirement, researchers should ensure that the components of transferred costs are listed (transparency level C) so the match between the perspective and relevant components for the decision situation can be judged. Input costs, which are reported by components (transparency level B) or by separate resource use and unit cost elements (transparency level A), allow further adjustments to the decision situation [15, 25]. When selecting the appropriate input costs, the researcher needs to be aware of specific sources of cost variability such as differences between private versus public settings or tender versus list prices. Also, appropriate methods should be used to adjust time differences and currency exchange rates, which are not addressed by the cost transfer formula.\nThe transferability of costs between countries within the region remains an important research area. Despite the high correlation between the predicted costs and true costs, for nearly half the costs the relative error of prediction was greater than 30%, carrying the risk of flawed estimates of the\ncost-effectiveness of treatments. Therefore, the cost transfer formula should be used with prudence. To improve the accuracy of predictions, further research is needed on the explainable variability and transferability of costs within MENA involving specific diseases, sub-regions [64\u201367] or special cost categories such as productivity loss [56]. We hypothesize that if costs are reported by more countries and the reporting quality improves, more accurate imputations will be possible. We also hypothesize that cost transfer coefficients differ between high- and low- to middle-income countries as well as between different cost types and disease areas. Also, due to the specifics of health systems, the costtransfer coefficient may be specific to geographic regions or even country-pairs. Furthermore, as more data become available for estimation or as health systems evolve over time, cost transfer coefficient estimates may also change.\nAlthough some of these hypotheses can be studied from the cost database described in this paper, the methodological heterogeneity and varying reporting quality of costing studies in MENA may represent challenges for further studies. The association between reporting transparency and the accuracy of cost imputation warrants further research. While we promote the efficient secondary utilisation of published costs, we also encourage authors to report their primary costing research results with transferability in mind, following applicable international guidelines [15, 60].\nSeveral limitations of our study should be noted. We limited our search to academic publications in peer-reviewed journals indexed in PubMed. Therefore, papers exclusive to other bibliographic databases have been omitted. Furthermore, although conference posters, government databases, HTA reports and other sources of the grey literature may be important sources of disease-related cost data, they were omitted from this review. Also, we limited our search to English language articles, so Arabic and French publications have been omitted [68]. Nevertheless, in a review of 27 months\u2019 global health economic publications, Pitt et\u00a0al. [69] did not identify Arabic or French articles from MENA. Therefore, we assume that English papers provide a good representation of health economic publications from the region. Furthermore, the database search was closed in December 2019, so further publications may have reported costs from the region. Although omitted from this study, recently published costs may prove useful in testing the external validity of our proposed imputation method. Finally, costs reported by Boutayeb et\u00a0al. [46] and Alkire et\u00a0al. [47] included components that were estimated from economic parameters of countries, which may have influenced the cost transfer coefficient estimates. While the exact proportion of these estimated components were not reported by the authors, according to the descriptions of their methods, the reported costs were mainly based on primary data."

When using the formula, authors should collect costs from as many sources as possible that match the perspective and relevant components of the decision situation. Due to the limited accuracy of predictions, the cost transfer formula should be used with prudence. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy of transferred costs. To enable the secondary utilisation of data, primary costing research results should be reported according to applicable international guidelines.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s40273- 022- 01146-6.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Bassem Chmaissani for his valuable contribution to this research.\nDeclarations\nAuthor contributions Conceptualisation and design: ZZ, LG.
