The use of the synthetic drugs has increased in the last few decades; however, these drugs exhibit various side effects. Scientists are therefore seeking alternatives from natural sources. Commiphora gileadensis has long been used to treat various disorders. It is commonly known as bisham or balm of Makkah. This plant contains various phytochemicals, including polyphenols and flavonoids, with biological potential. We found that steam-distilled essential oil of C. gileadensis exhibited higher antioxidant activity (IC50, 22.2 μg/mL) than ascorbic acid (IC50, 1.25 μg/mL). The major constituents (>2%) in the essential oil were β-myrcene, nonane, verticiol, β-phellandrene, β-cadinene, terpinen-4-ol, β-eudesmol, α-pinene, cis-β-copaene and verticillol, which might be responsible for the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The extract of C. gileadensis exhibited inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase (IC50, 450.1 μg/mL), xanthine oxidase (251.2 μg/mL) and protein denaturation (110.5 μg/mL) compared to standard treatments, making it a viable treatment from a natural plant source. LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of phenolic compounds such as caffeic acid phenyl ester, hesperetin, hesperidin, chrysin and transient amounts of catechin, gallic acid, rutin and caffeic acid. 1. conclusions It can be concluded that due to the presence of various chemical constituents such as gallic acid, rutin, apigenin, caryophyllene, α-pinene, β-pinene, γ-terpinene and terpinen-4ol, the C. gileadensis extract exhibited significant biological activity. The various chemical constituents present in the plant extract make it a viable natural resource that can be used in various pharmacological formulations. The plant extract showed significant biological activity, which contributes to its success as a traditional medicine used by traditional practitioners to treat various ailments including inflammation, pain and gouty arthritis.
