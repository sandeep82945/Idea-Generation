            "text": "A fundamental aspect of human mental life is the seamless ability for integration of emotion and cognition. Despite progress regarding the spatial architecture of Emotion-Cognition Integration (ECI), the time course of ECI processes remains unclear. To examine the temporal organization of brain oscillations underpinning ECI, we simultaneously manipulated emotional valence of stimuli and cognitive task demand while recording electrophysiological responses of 61 participants. They were asked to complete tasks with low (body-part judgement) and high (laterality judgement) cognitive demand while viewing other people photographs that varied on dimensions of laterality (left or right), body-part (hand or foot), and emotional valence (pain or no pain). We found increased reaction times and error rates in pain versus no pain during laterality judgement relative to body-part judgement, suggesting reciprocal inhibition between emotion and cognition. EEG results showed that 1) emotion processing (valence) occurred first in the theta band from 144 to 372 ms; 2) cognitive processing (laterality) took place in the theta band from 332 to 608 ms; 3) emotional and cognitive processes were integrated in the alpha band from 268 ms and lasted to 800 ms. These findings reveal oscillatory dynamics of the processing and integration of emotion and cognition, providing further insights into the underlying neurophysiology. This may ultimately contribute to our understanding of ECI processing in psychopathology. Keywords: emotion-cognition integration (ECI); oscillatory dynamics; alpha power; theta power; functional integration\nIntroduction\nA fundamental aspect of human mental life is the seamless ability for integration of emotion and cognition. The historical view of \u201cfunctional specialization\u201d holds that different brain areas are specialized for emotion and cognition. Inspired by this viewpoint, many studies examined either the influence of cognition on the \u201cemotional brain\u201d (Ochsner and Gross, 2005) or the impact of emotion on the \u201ccognitive brain\u201d (Dolan, 2002; Pessoa, 2009). However, the concept of functional localization alone is not sufficient to explain the highly complex and dynamic nature of human behavior (Pessoa, 2008). Indeed, in recent years research emphasizes functional integration of brain networks in order to process emotional and cognitive information (Okon-Singer et al., 2015). Emotion-cognition integration (ECI) occurring at both the behavioral and neural levels are of great importance for adaptation to one's environment and thus to successful everyday functioning (Pessoa, 2008). Specifically, emotion and cognition not only strongly interact in the brain but are dynamically integrated to jointly contribute to behavior.\nGu et al., (2013) investigated the interaction between cognitive and affective processes using an empathy-for-pain paradigm that simultaneously manipulated cognitive task demand and affective valence of visual stimuli. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), they identified an interaction between cognitive demand and affective stimulus valence in the anterior insular cortex as well as in the primary somatosensory\ncortex and regions of the frontoparietal network. This may be indicative of a role as interface for ECI in these regions. However, the temporal resolution of MRI is low, and thus the temporal dynamics underpinning ECI remain elusive. Understanding how ECI processes unfold over time is of crucial importance for affective and cognitive neuroscience, given that our brain works dynamically across multiple timescales (Olivers, 2007; Hutchison et al., 2013; King and Dehaene, 2014).\nElectroencephalogram (EEG) techniques have excellent temporal resolution in the range of milliseconds and are thus well-suited to shed light on the time course of ECI (Cohen, 2014). Posterior alpha oscillations have been associated with inhibition processes (Klimesch et al., 2007; Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010; Klimesch, 2012), with increased alpha reflecting inhibition and decreased alpha the release from inhibition (Klimesch, 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2019). Given the inhibitory nature of the relationship between emotion and cognition, alpha power can thus be used to examine neurophysiological processes underlying ECI. In addition, frontal-central theta oscillations are of importance for both emotional and cognitive processing (Cohen et al., 2007; Knyazev et al., 2009; Nigbur et al., 2011; Cavanagh and Frank, 2014; Puma et al., 2018). Specifically, decreased theta power has been shown in negative as compared to positive valence processing (Kamarajan et al., 2008), whereas stronger theta power has been observed for high relative to low cognitive demand (Cavanagh and Frank, 2014). In particular, theta power may be a compelling candidate mechanism for such integrative operation given the\nimportant role of theta power in cognitive regulation of negative emotion (Ertl et al., 2013).\nHere, we tested oscillatory dynamics underlying ECI while recording EEG signals during an empathy-for-pain task adapted from Gu and colleagues, in which we simultaneously manipulated cognitive task demand and affective valence of the stimuli (Gu et al., 2013) . First, we replicated ECI at the behavioral level (i.e., reaction times and error rates). Second, a data-driven method was used to examine the temporal organization of different information processing stages. Based on the dual-system model proposing a fast emotional system and a slow cognitive system during human decision making (Kahneman, 2003; Kuo et al., 2009), we predicted that emotion processing, as indexed by theta power, would occur first. Importantly, we predicted an interaction effect between emotion and cognition in theta and alpha oscillations. We also took into account individual differences in propensity for emotion processing and regulation, as this may be a factor of interest. More specifically, this regards alexithymia, which refers to a reduced ability to identify, describe and regulate one\u2019s feelings (Luminet et al., 2018). Given cognitive and emotional deficits in alexithymia (for a review, see Luminet et al., 2021), we explored associations between alexithymia levels and ECI ability.\nMethods and Materials\nParticipants\nSixty-four right-handed healthy adults participated in the experiment. Based on the Chinese version of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20; Bagby et al., 1994) and in light of the international cutoff to access alexithymia with the TAS-20 (Taylor et al., 1988), 32 participants with TAS-20 scores higher or equal to 61 (13.81% of the pool of 695 students; high alexithymia group; HA) and 32 participants with TAS-20 scores lower or equal to 51 (53.24% of the pool; low alexithymia group; LA) participated in the experiment (for demographic information, see Table S1). This sampling procedure ensured sufficient variability in TAS-20 scores. The current sample size was similar to previous studies examining emotion processing in alexithymia, which showed strong effects (e.g., Roedema and Simons, 1999; Heinzel et al., 2010). Data of three participants were excluded from analyses because of excessive EEG artifacts. The final sample consisted of 61 participants (32 HAs; 32 females; age: 17 \u2013 28 years, mean \u00b1 SD: 20.49 \u00b1 2.23 years). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and reported no psychiatric illness in present or past. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen University and informed written consent was obtained from all participants. . Self-report questionnaires In addition to the TAS-20, participants also completed the Chinese version of the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ; Wang et al., 2021), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck et al., 1988), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, 1967) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) given that anxiety,\ndepression, and autism have been demonstrated to co-occur with alexithymia (Hendryx et al., 1991; Bird and Cook, 2013; Li et al., 2015)."

These dimensions created eight categories: painful-left-hand, painful-left-foot, painful-right-hand, painful-right-foot, nonpainful-left-hand, nonpainful-left-foot, nonpainful-right-hand, and nonpainful-right-foot.

The two tasks were identical except for the task instructions: In TL sessions, participants were asked to judge the laterality (left or right) of the presented body part. In TB sessions, participants were required to judge the body part (foot or hand) of the presented picture. As shown by\nGu et al., (2013), TL was associated with higher cognitive demand than TB, inferred from significantly longer reaction times and higher error rates in TL than TB (mean reaction time (ms): TL = 1000.5, TB = 871; mean error rates (%): TL = 4.3, TB = 0.65). During each session, a total of 128 stimuli (64 for Pain and 64 for No Pain) were randomly presented. Each session consisted of two blocks, interleaved with a self-paced break. At the beginning of each trial, following a white fixation cross of a random duration (800~1500 ms), a picture was displayed in the center of the screen for 2000 ms maximally. Once they had identified the target (left or right in TL; hand or foot in TB) from the shown picture, participants pressed the button \u201cj\u201d with the left index finger or \u201ck\u201d with the right index finger. Specifically, TB required participants to press \u201cj\u201d if the photograph showed a hand and \u201ck\u201d if the photograph showed a foot. This response pattern was counterbalanced across participants. During TL, participants were instructed to press \u201cj\u201d if a left body part was shown and \u201ck\u201d if a right body part was shown. Finally, a blank screen lasted for 1000 ms. The experiment included four conditions with 256 trials (64 trials per condition). Participants completed several practice rounds until achieving at least 80% of accuracy before the formal experiment started.

            "text": "Among six contrasts, we found three significant clusters in theta and alpha bands following stimuli presentation: 1) a main effect of Emotion in theta band from 144 to 372 ms; 2) an interaction effect between Emotion and Cognition in alpha band from 268 to 800 ms; 3) a main effect of Cognition in theta band from 332-608 ms. Specifically, one-way ANOVAs showed that Pain evoked weaker theta power than No Pain from 144 to 372 ms (F(1,60) = 17.630, p < 0.001, \u03b7p 2 = 0.227; 95% CI: -0.313, -0.111) and TB evoked stronger theta power than TL (F(1,60) = 18.718, p < 0.001, \u03b7p 2 = 0.238; 95% CI: 0.199, 0.540). Particularly, a significant interaction between Emotion and Cognition from 268 to 800 ms (F(1,60) = 6.036, p = 0.017, \u03b7p 2 = 0.091) revealed increased alpha power in Pain relative to No Pain in TL (F(1,60) = 5.692, p = 0.020, \u03b7p 2 = 0.087; 95% CI: 0.032, 0.368) but decreased alpha power in Pain relative to No Pain in TB (F(1,60) = 4.003, p = 0.050, \u03b7p 2 = 0.063; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.382). Please note that the minimum number of trials in each condition was not less than 52.\nDiscussion\nEmotion-cognition interactions are of importance in determining human behavior.\nRegarding their neural basis, electrophysiological mechanisms underlying their complex interrelationship (i.e., cooperation, competition or the combination) remain to be elucidated. Consistent with Gu et al., (2013) who examined the spatial organization of Emotion-Cognition Integration (ECI), our behavioral results showed increased RT and Error Rate in Pain relative to No Pain during TL as compared to TB, suggesting reciprocal competition and inhibition between emotion and cognition. Using high temporal resolution EEG recording, we found that 1) emotion processing occurred first in the theta band from 144 to 372 ms; 2) ECI took place from 268 ms and lasted to 800 ms in the alpha band; 3) the theta band also reflected cognitive processing, which occurred from 332 to 608 ms. These findings shed light on the temporal organization of brain oscillations underlying ECI processes, with emotion processing occurring first and cognition processing occurring later in the theta band. ECI took place in the alpha band.\nTheta, rather than alpha, power reflected emotion and cognition processing at different stages, while alpha, but not theta, power was responsible for integrating computation between emotion and cognition, indicative of a functional dissociation between the theta and alpha oscillations in ECI processes. Theta oscillations are involved in fundamental functions across species (Knyazev, 2007). In addition to emotion processing and cognitive encoding (Knyazev, 2007; Kamarajan et al., 2008; Knyazev et al., 2009; Cavanagh and Frank, 2014), theta power has been linked to cognitive regulation of negative emotion (Ertl et al., 2013). However, inconsistent with our prediction, we did\nnot find any significant integrative cluster in the theta band, which may suggest that ECI is associated with different neural mechanisms than cognitive regulation of negative emotion. Notably, the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are at the core of emotion regulation (Kohn et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2020; Wang, Goerlich, et al., 2021), while the anterior insula may be the core brain area underlying ECI (Gu et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2014). Future studies would benefit from investigating differences in alpha and theta oscillations between emotion regulation and ECI. Although many studies have linked increased theta power to higher cognitive demand (Nigbur et al., 2011; Cavanagh and Frank, 2014), some studies have reported the reverse pattern (Puma et al., 2018; Kramer, 2020). It has been proposed that task difficulties moderate the relationship between theta power and cognitive demand in an inverted U-shape pattern, with theta oscillations decreasing for simple tasks, reaching highest levels for medium task difficulty and decreasing again with high task demand (Puma et al., 2018). We found decreased theta power in tasks with low vs. high cognitive demand. One explanation might be that the current task was relatively easy for the participants, as suggested by the high accuracy in the current study. Among ECI processes, emotion processing took place first, from 144 to 372 ms. This result supports the dual-system theory distinguishing between a fast affective system and a slow cognitive system in the human brain (Kahneman, 2003; Kuo et al., 2009).\nImportantly, ECI was subserved by activity in the alpha band from 268 to 800 ms. Alpha\noscillations have long been considered dominant in the human brain (Ba\u015far, 2012), with mounting evidence supporting an inhibitory function of alpha oscillations in information processing (Klimesch et al., 2007; Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010). Increased alpha power may reflect inhibition, while decreased alpha power may denote a release from inhibition (or facilitation; Klimesch, 2012). These roles of alpha activity have been considered to be part and parcel of integrative processes underlying several functions, including attention, working memory, and emotion (Ba\u015far, 2012; Klimesch, 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2019). For example, alpha power has been shown to suppress cognitive control of emotional distractions (Murphy et al., 2020). The current results of increased alpha power in pain (vs. neutral) processing during tasks with high cognitive demand, in line with our behavioral findings, may thus be indicative of mutual inhibition between emotion and cognition to compete for limited mental resources.\nWith regard to the time scale, integrative operation in the alpha band occurred between 268 and 800 ms (note the segmentation of each trial from 0 to 800 ms post-stimulus onset and ECI most likely continuing after 800 ms). The relatively early and lasting integrative processing between emotion and cognition suggests an indispensable role of integrative computation, challenging the traditional view of emotion and cognition being independent systems (Goldman-Rakic, 1996; LeDoux, 2000; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Pessoa, 2008; Liu et al., 2009). In sum, our findings contribute to developing a temporal architecture underlying ECI during an empathy-for-pain paradigm. Future studies would\nbenefit from obtaining a full picture of ECI processes by simultaneous EEG-fMRI or Magnetoencephalography recordings or intracranial EEG recording. An advantage for intracranial EEG recording is that the high-gamma band can be reliably accessed given its crucial role in information integration (Zhang and Yartsev, 2019; Wang et al., 2020).\nWe also found decreased alpha power in pain (vs. neutral) processing during low cognitive demand (body part judgement) following the interaction between emotion and cognition in the alpha band. Based on the facilitation-inhibition hypothesis regarding alpha oscillations (Klimesch, 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2019), this result suggests mutual facilitation between emotion and cognition. Although such a facilitating effect was indeed observed in RT in the previous study (Gu et al., 2013), it was not observed in the current behavioral results. Therefore, interpretations regarding this result should be made with caution. Please note that we did not find any significant interaction effect between emotion and cognition in pain for empathy-related and cognition-related event-related potentials (ERPs; see Figure S2; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011; Coll, 2018). Compared to our oscillation results, the ERP results may suggest that phase-locked analysis is not sensitive to ECI signals.\nNo significant alexithymia-related effect was observed in the current study, despite its association with impairments in emotional processing (van der Velde et al., 2013; Wang, Chen, et al., 2021). One possible explanation may be that the stimuli used here merely\ndisplayed isolated parts of the human body and thus lacked social-emotional features (Britton et al., 2006; Powers et al., 2013). In a previous study, we reported social-specific impairment for negative emotion processing in alexithymia (Wang, S Goerlich, et al., 2021). Future studies could examine the integrative processing between emotion and cognition in relation to alexithymia with socially relevant materials.\nSeveral limitations of the present study should be mentioned. First, we examined the temporal organization of ECI only from electrophysiological activity (e.g., oscillation) profiles. It has been proposed that complex cognitive-emotional behaviors are organized in dynamic brain networks (Pessoa, 2008). Future studies should aim to explore neural mechanisms of ECI using functional connectivity. Second, we used photographs that varied only between painful and nonpainful levels in the current study, because empathic pain has been considered an excellent candidate to probe ECI (Gu et al., 2013). It is thus not clear whether the current conclusions can be extrapolated to other emotions. Future studies would thus benefit from the examination of ECI processing in a variety of emotional categories.\nTo conclude, this study shows characteristics of oscillatory dynamics underlying ECI, with emotion processing occurring first and cognition processing occurring later in the theta band and ECI taking place in the alpha band. In support of the dual-system theory of decision making (Kahneman, 2003; Kuo et al., 2009), our results are indicative of fast\nprocessing of emotional information, slower cognitive processing, and mutual inhibition between emotion and cognition to compete for limited mental resources. These findings shed light on the role of neural oscillations on the interplay between emotion and cognition in the human brain.\nAcknowledgements\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have indicated they have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.\nData available statement\nThe data are available from the corresponding author P.
