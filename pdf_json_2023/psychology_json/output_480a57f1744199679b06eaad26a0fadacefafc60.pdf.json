    "abstractText": "Hybrids of short oligourea foldamers with residues of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3-amino acids esters at the C-terminus were obtained and subjected to a reaction with LiOH. There are two possible transformations under such conditions, one of which is ester hydrolysis and the formation of a carboxylic group and the other is the cyclization reaction after abstraction of a proton from urea by a base. We have investigated this reaction with difference C-terminal residue structures, as well as under different work-up conditions, especially for oligourea hybrids with \u03b1-amino acid esters. For these compounds, an oligourea\u2013hydantoin combination is the product of cyclization. The stability of the hydantoin ring under alkaline conditions has been alsotested. Furthermore, this work reports data related to the structure of C-terminal-modified oligourea foldamers in solution and, for one compound, in the solid state. Helical folding is preserved both for cyclized and linear modifications, with oligourea\u2013acid hybrids appearing to be more conformationally stable, as they are stabilized by an additional intramolecular hydrogen bond in comparison to cyclic derivatives.",

            "text": "In recent years, oligourea foldamers with the general formula [NHCH(R)CH2NHCO]n have gained much attention as structural and functional mimetics of peptides [1\u20138]. It has been shown that oligoureas can mimic the helical secondary structure of peptides. Oligourea foldamers fold into 2.5 helices, stabilized by a network of 3-centered hydrogen bonds, forming 12- and 14-membered pseudorings [2,4]. The secondary structure is independent of the sequence, and even short oligomers tend to form stable spatial structures in solution and in the solid state [2]. It has been shown that water-soluble oligourea foldamers with carefully designed sequences are also able to form higher-ordered structures such as bundles or channels [9\u201312]. Moreover, it is possible to encapsulate guest molecules inside the bundle [13,14]. It has also been demonstrated that oligoureas can act as electron transport mediators, similar to peptides and proteins [15\u201317]. The stability of the helical conformation of these oligomers has enabled studies which have elucidated the mechanism of electron transfer to be length dependent, changing from tunneling to hopping with the length of the molecule and thereby the thickness of the monolayer [15,16]. Over the years the (oligo)urea backbone has undergone various modifications and the impact of these changes on the structural properties of the new analogs has been investigated. This has led to the conclusion that the 2.5-helical structures of oligoureas are robust and it is possible to substitute the urea residue with \u03b3-amino acid [6,18], carbamate [18,19], thiourea [20], guanidinium [21] and also N-methylated [22] or urea residues with noncanonical substitution patterns [23] without the loss of the structural integrity of the new molecule. It has also been shown that urea fragments as short as three residues can induce a helical conformation when fused to a peptide too short to fold into a stable secondary\nInt. J. Mol.

Such \u03b1-peptide/urea chimeras adopt a continuous and well-defined helical structure spanning the entire sequence stabilized by a H bond network, regardless of the position (e.g., N-terminal or C-terminal) of the urea segment on the peptide fragment [24]. The aim of the work reported here was to obtain oligourea foldamers containing carboxyl groups at the C-terminus under alkaline conditions. Similar connections of urea fragments with \u03b1-amino acid residues were reported by Liskamp and co-workers [26]. They developed a solid phase synthetic methodology allowing them to obtain the desired compounds [26]. We performed our syntheses in solution and decided to expand the types of C-terminal residues to include \u03b2- and \u03b3-amino acids. It turned out that in addition to the expected product 1, compound 2 (Figure 1), as the result of the cyclization of the last residue, was also formed. The type of the resultant product (1 or 2) depended on the structure of the C-terminal residue, as well as on the work-up conditions. In this paper we also report the influence of C-terminal modifications on the secondary structure of the obtained compounds.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 18\nnew molecule.

At the C-terminus,\nthe methyl esters of varied amino acids in the form of succinimidyl carbamates were cou-\npled (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1) to form a urea bond. To facilitate the\ncoupling of different amino acids residues, oligourea synthesis was initiated by Boc-pro-\ntected 1-isobutyl-2-azidoethylamine and then carried out by sequential linkage of individ-\nual succinimidyl carbamates from the so-called C-terminus to the N-teminus to obtain the\ndesired tetramer, as it has previously been reported [15]. To incorporate the C-terminal\nresidues, the azide function in compound 3 (Scheme 1) was reduced to an amine group\nwith hydrogen in the presence of Pd/C, and then succinimidyl carbamate derivatives of\nmethyl esters of \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-amino acids (BB1\u2013BB4) were used in the coupling reaction.\nCompounds of type 5 were reacted at RT with excess (10 eq.)

Synthesis of methyl esters of oligourea foldamers and subsequent reaction under alkaline\nconditions.\nIt is known from the literature that ureido esters form hydantoin analogs under al-\nkaline conditions, but most of the examples refer to solid phase synthetic procedures\n[26,31,32]. Liskamp and co-workers [26] observed that resin-bound oligourea was cleaved\noff the Tentagel resin as substituted hydantoin under basic conditions in the presence of\nKCN in MeOH. Subsequently, various hydroxides were tested by them on the model com-\npound and it was discovered that the highest amount of hydantoin was formed with\nNaOH (45%), whereas TBAOH favored the acid form (>98%) of the peptidomimetic.\nNext, we decided to investigate the outcome of the reaction of \u03b2- and \u03b3-amino acid\nresidues at the C-terminus. The linear compound 1f was formed for unbranched \u03b2hGly,\nwhereas for \u03b23hAla, a mixture (around 1:1, see the Supporting Information, Figure S56) of\ntwo products (1g and 2g) was obtained. For \u03b3-amino acid derivatives, only compounds\n1h\u2013j were formed as products of the simple hydrolysis of methyl esters and no cyclic\nproducts were observed.\nWe speculate that the outcome (cyclisation versus hydrolysis) of the reaction of oli-\ngourea methyl esters of type 5 with LiOH and the dependence on the structure of the last\namino acid residue may be caused, among other reasons, by steric factors.

The reaction occurs with oligom rs long en ugh to fold into 2.5 helices, as confirmed by 2D NMR ROESY spectra [2]. All urea groups adopt a trans,trans conformation (see the Supporting Information, Figure S48), which is necessary for helical folding and formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network. For terminal amino acid residues with short distances between the last urea group at the C-terminus and the methyl ester moiety,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 6806 4 of 17\nas present in \u03b1-amino acids, the attack of the OH\u2212 anion on the carbonyl carbon may be hampered because of the helix. On the other hand, cyclization is favored by the proximity of the reacting groups. For Gly derivatives, the unbranched chain seems to be flexible enough to give both products. The elongation of the terminal amino acid residues by additional methylene groups, as in \u03b2- and further \u03b3-derivatives, causes more lability of the carbon chain and extends the distance of the ester group, which facilitates alkaline hydrolysis and the formation of products of type 1. The reaction of oligourea 5b was then studied in more detail. We have discovered that the ratio of cyclic to linear products before and after isolation strongly depended on the work-up method used. In the crude reaction mixture after 2 h, the ratio of 1b and 2b determined by HPLC was 3:7. The crude was then highly diluted with water and DCM and after extraction, the compound 2b was obtained from the organic phase, whereas 1b was isolated from the aqueous phase after acidification. On the other hand, when the crude reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and then re-dissolved in a mixture of DCM and water, acidified with 1M HCl and extracted, the only isolated product was compound 1b (Figure 2a). It was evident that during evaporation, the hydantoin ring in 2b underwent hydrolysis and oligourea 1b with a glycine residue at the C-terminus was formed [29,33,34]. Interestingly, the foldamer with a cyclic residue at the C-terminus is slightly more polar than the foldamer with a carboxylic moiety (Figure 2a).\nInt. J. Mol.

Hydrolysis of Oligourea Ester 5\nThe corresponding ester 5 (1 eq.) was dissolved in MeOH (7 mM). LiOH\u00d7H2O (10 eq) was dissolved in water (the ratio of MeOH to H2O was 4:1) and added to the ester solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at RT. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC (for 5g, the reaction mixture was stirred overnight). The work-up conditions depended on the obtained product/products. To isolate oligourea acid 1, the solvents were completely and slowly removed under vacuum (water bath at 45 \u25e6C). The residue was\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 6806 12 of 17\nredissolved in CH2Cl2 and distilled water. The water layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2\u00d7) with the addition of brine because of the formation of an emulsion. The organic layers were removed. HCl (1M) was added to water layer until an acidic pH and it was extracted with CH2Cl2 until all the product was completely extracted into the organic layer. The solvent was evaporated, and the crude product was dissolved in CH3CN, quickly passed through a syringe filter (PA 0.2\u00b5m) and lyophilized from CH3CN with addition of water. The product of type 1 was obtained as a white solid. To isolate oligourea hydantoin/dihydrouracil 2, the reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 and distilled water. The layers were separated, and the water layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 with the addition of brine (emulsion formation) until all the cyclic product was completely extracted into the organic layer. The solvent was evaporated, and the crude product was dissolved in CH3CN, quickly passed through a syringe filter (PA 0.2\u00b5m) and lyophilized from CH3CN with the addition of water. The product of type 2 was obtained as a white solid.

            "text": "Herein, we have investigated the reaction of oligoureas with methyl esters at the Cterminus under basic conditions. Under such conditions, two possible transformations can occur: the hydrolysis of methyl ester with the formation of an oligourea acid or cyclization of the final residue and the formation of 5- or 6-membered rings at the C-terminus of the oligomer. We discovered that the result of the reaction is strongly dependent on the structure of the terminal residue. Oligoureas modified with \u03b1- and \u03b2-amino acid esters form two types of products, whereas \u03b3-amino acid esters undergo only a hydrolysis reaction. Moreover, for Gly and Ala derivatives, the yield of isolated products depends on the work-up conditions, influenced strongly by the chemical stability of the hydantoin ring. Conformational studies of short acid and hydantoin oligoureas in solution as well as in the solid state revealed that both types of compound fold into 2.5 helices. The stability of the secondary structure of the acid derivatives was observed to be high, as confirmed by NMR and ECD experiments. The hydantoin ring seems to be noticeably labile and is not involved in the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network. Even in the crystal structure, it occupies two positions, either folded \u201cinside\u201d the helix or flipped outside of the helix. The C-terminal-modified oligoureas described in this work expand the family of synthetic oligomers able to fold into stable structures. Moreover, these compounds may find application in molecular recognition and in the formation of supramolecular polymers or more complicated architectures [36,37], as well as in the field of biochemistry, as many hydantoin derivatives show biological activity [28,29]. The hydantoin foldamer hybrids reported here seem to be promising candidates for further studies, as they contain a helical portion which, when properly designed, may be able to mimic biologically active peptides, with the modifiable hydantoin moiety providing a further avenue to enable the design of molecules with biological activities.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24076806/s1.
