Tobacco-related cardiovascular disease and cancers are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in adults experiencing homelessness [3\u20137]. Mental illness and substance use disorders are common among PEH and represent risk factors for both smoking and poor smoking-related health outcomes [8]. PEH make quit attempts as frequently as the general population, but quit successfully less often [9\u201311]. Clinical trials of behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy\u2014the standard of care for smoking cessation\u2014have increased short-term quit attempts but have not demonstrated long-term smoking abstinence among PEH [12\u201316]. Long-term abstinence, defined as abstinence for 6 months or more, is a strong predictor of successful cessation [17].\nContingency management (CM) is an efficacious behavior change strategy that reinforces\npositive health behaviors with incentives (e.g., cash) and has been shown in clinical trials to reduce tobacco and substance use in the general population [18\u201321]. Recent research, including uncontrolled pilot studies [22, 23] and pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs), [24, 25] have demonstrated the feasibility of short-term (i.e., 8 weeks or less) CM to increase quit attempts among PEH. However, these studies did not explore ways to promote long-term abstinence. Evidence suggests that CM implemented for 12 weeks or longer can be efficacious in promoting long-term abstinence beyond 6 months [18, 26\u201331]. Currently, there are no feasibility trials evaluating the ability of extended CM to promote long-term abstinence among PEH.\nImpactful cessation interventions not only need to be efficacious, but also feasible to implement in community or clinical practice settings [32, 33]. Given that the majority of PEH in the United States of America (USA) seek medical care in safety-net health settings [34, 35], a pragmatic clinical trial\u2014designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention in one of these practice settings [36]\u2014could be ideally suited for this population and help bring smoking\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278870 December 16, 2022 2 / 17\nupon study completion to users under a datasharing agreement that provide for: 1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify individual participants, 2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology, 3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.

Furthermore, specially tailored techniques may be needed to facilitate participation success of PEH in clinical trials.\nElectronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly being used to facilitate large-scale, pragmatic RCTs [37, 38] and may be especially useful for PEH. Although most commonly used to assess decision-support interventions, EHRs can also be used for patient recruitment, service utilization, and outcome assessment in RCTs with interventions performed outside of the EHR [38, 39]. Maintaining sustained contact with PEH is a challenge. However, our group and others have developed recruitment and retention techniques to minimize attrition in clinical trials [40\u201349]."

We will thus provide a model of EHR-facilitated study implementation that can be replicated in other safety-net clinics and healthcare organizations. The main objectives of this pilot pragmatic RCT will be to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the CM intervention. In addition, we will assess the feasibility of utilizing the EHR as part of the study protocol implementation as well as the collection of abstinence outcomes for up to 12 months (including 6 months post-intervention) in PEH."

The clinics are part of the San Francisco Health Network\u2014a network of primary care, behavioral health, and acute care clinics. One of the clinics serves a large proportion of PEH (smoking prevalence 44%). The second is an academic primary care clinic located in a safety-net hospital (smoking prevalence 15.2%). The third is an academic primary care clinic located in a safety-net hospital and serves people living with HIV (smoking prevalence 35.4%). We chose these sites based on a needs assessment demonstrating a higher prevalence of tobacco use than the state prevalence of 10% [50] and the presence of an existing clinical infrastructure to deliver guideline-recommended cessation care, including behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy [51, 52]. These clinics have already incorporated a tobacco registry within the Epic EHR to improve delivery of tobacco smoking cessation services by enabling tracking of interventions and missed opportunities in providing cessation care [53]."

Eligibility criteria will include 1) having a primary care provider and receiving smoking cessation care at the clinic, including behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy, 2) meeting criteria for homelessness as defined by the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act or living in single room occupancy hotels temporarily over the past 2 years [54], 3) being a current smoker (at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime, daily smoking in the past 7 days and at least 5 cigarettes per day, verified by expired carbon monoxide (CO)\ufffd8 parts per million [ppm]) [55, 56]\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278870 December 16, 2022 3 / 17\nwith an intention to quit smoking within the next 6 months, 4) being English proficient, and 5) being able to provide informed consent. Participants will be encouraged to attend usual smoking cessation care, which is available to all patients who receive clinical services at the three study sites. Exclusion criteria include any reason that precludes the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (e.g., pregnancy, myocardial infarction within the preceding 2 weeks).\nRecruitment and informed consent procedures\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)- trained study staff will generate lists of patients within the Epic EHR who meet eligibility criteria based on housing and smoking status. We will ask providers in each of the clinics to review these lists of potential participants and provide permission for study staff to contact the individuals for eligibility screening. Separately, providers will also perform \u201cwarm hand-offs\u201d or referrals of potential participants to study staff during in-person recruitment at the clinics. We will also incentivize participants to refer other individuals who meet study criteria for potential participation.\nStudy staff will screen potential participants for current smoking/housing status and assess whether they have contraindications to receiving medications for cessation. They will contact primary care providers (PCPs) for individuals who meet eligibility criteria but who may have contraindications to cessation medications to assess whether they can enroll in the study. We will invite those who meet preliminary eligibility criteria without contraindications to meet study staff at the recruitment site for the assessment of smoking status using CO testing. Participants whose expired CO is\ufffd8 ppm will be invited to enroll in the study. Study staff will describe study procedures and obtain written informed consent using the teach-to-goal method at the time of eligibility, which has been shown to increase comprehension of consent documents in vulnerable patients [57]. To do so, the study staff will give the participant a copy of the consent form, read the informed consent documents and encourage the participant to read along if they desire. The study staff will pause after each section of the consent to allow the participant to ask questions about that section. After reading the entire consent, the interviewer will ask the participants questions related to the content of the consent. Questions will address the procedures for the study, the risks of participation, the voluntary nature of research, the right of the participants to end participation at any point without consequence, the reimbursement for participation, and situations when study staff is legally bound to report participant disclosures (e.g., suicidality, homicidality). These questions will be used by the study staff to assess comprehension. For participants demonstrating a lack of understanding about one or more aspects of the research, the study staff will provide targeted education about misunderstood points. The questioning and targeted education process will be repeated until the participant demonstrates comprehension. If a given individual is unable to demonstrate comprehension after several rounds of questioning and targeted education, we will not enroll him/her/them into the study. Study staff will assess decisional capacity using the Macarthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research [58].\nTo mitigate the risks of transmission from COVID-19, all study procedures will take place\noutdoors in a public space in close proximity to the study clinics. The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the San Francisco Department of Public Health most recently approved the current version of the study protocol (Study #20\u2013 33166), including its consent procedures, on August 24, 2022."

HIPAA-trained study staff will access the EHR monthly to verify participants\u2019 receipt of counseling and prescriptions for cessation pharmacotherapy. We anticipate that some participants may be co-prescribed varenicline or bupropion with NRT; we will document receipt of non-NRT medications by self-report at each visit and verify this information through the EHR. This approach has been used successfully in a prior study of contingency management for smoking cessation among PEH [24]. We will extract data from the EHR patient registry of enrolled patients monthly to identify referrals for clinic-provided counseling and pharmacotherapy. If a patient is not receiving treatment, study staff will message their PCP from within the EHR to remind them to provide smoking cessation treatment."

In addition to usual cessation care, intervention participants with CO-verified abstinence will receive a contingency management incentive payment via gift cards redeemable in national retail chains according to a pre-defined schedule. Gift card amounts and assessment frequencies are based on prior studies among individuals experiencing homelessness or substance use disorders [22, 24, 25, 30, 59] and are expected to be effective in promoting smoking cessation. The schedule of abstinence incentive payments is shown in Table 1. Gift card amounts will begin at $13.00 and increase by $0.50 for each negative CO specimen throughout the first 6 months of the program (maximum of $25.00 per specimen), for a total of 25 specimens collected through week 24 (Table 1). Given that visit frequency decreases over time, an incentive payment schedule that increases with each visit over time is especially important to maintain motivation. The total amount that participants can earn under the contingent incentive program through week 24 is $475, an amount comparable to what has been used in prior studies [22\u201325]. Test results\nindicative of smoking (i.e., CO >5 ppm) or missed visits will lead to resetting the gift card amount back to the initial value (i.e., $13.00). However, two consecutive negative tests will restore the value back to the highest level previously achieved [22, 24, 25, 59, 60].\nControl group incentives. Participants in the control group will receive a fixed incentive\nof $5 for attending each of 25 abstinence assessment visits for the first 6 months of the study.\nFollow-up time periods. The duration of the CM intervention is 6 months, with an additional 6 months of follow up after the last intervention visit. We will ask intervention and control group participants to complete questionnaires at enrollment, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Abstinence assessment visits\u2014where participants self-report smoking abstinence and provide an expired carbon monoxide sample\u2014will take place daily for the first 7 days (week 1), twice weekly for the next 3 weeks (until 1 month post enrollment), once weekly for the next 8 weeks (until 3 months post enrollment), and then monthly through 6 months of follow up. This follow-up schedule is based on assessment frequencies from prior studies among PEH or those with substance use disorders [22, 24, 25, 30, 59]. The abstinence assessment visit schedule will be identical for both the intervention and control groups. All participants will receive incentivized monthly check-in assessments during months 7\u201311 to ensure retention in the study through the last study visit at 12 months follow-up. A complete schedule of enrollment, intervention, and assessments is presented in Fig 1, which has been adapted from the SPIRIT figure [61]."

If a participant does not present for their scheduled visit, study staff will call the participant, as well as any contacts they have provided, visit the places the participant reported that they spend time, or contact the clinic staff (study outreach). Between the 6- and 12-month assessments, we will ask and incentivize participants ($5 per visit) to check in monthly (i.e., check-in assessments). During the study period, if a participant does not show up to a follow-up visit, staff will attempt to reach the participant three times to schedule a make up visit. Participants will only be designated as \u201clost to follow up\u201d when they fail to complete all of their scheduled visits for the study period. We have used these procedures successfully in prior studies that have had a similar frequency of visits and length of follow up [40\u201347].\nReimbursements. We will reimburse all participants $20 for completing the enrollment questionnaire, $15 each for questionnaires at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months, and $25 each for questionnaires at 6 months and 12 months [24]. Between 6 and 12 months, all participants will also receive $5 for checking in at each monthly visit and providing a CO specimen. Thus, the total amount that all participants could earn for 1 year of participation exclusive of contingency management is $145. Intervention group participants could earn as much as $620 inclusive of contingency management ($145+$475), whereas control group participants could earn as much as $270 inclusive of the abstinence assessment visits ($145+$125)."

Our threshold estimates for feasibility outcomes are based on findings from prior studies [24, 25]. For example, for the outcome of adherence to the CO assessment visits, a prior study showed that 78% of participants attended half of the assessment visits. Another study showed that, on average, participants provided a CO reading for 60% of the total possible assessment visits [24, 25].

Primary outcome measures will include: 1) the proportion of participants who achieve biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence at 6 months; 2) the median number of carbon monoxide (CO) negative samples per participant at 6 months; 3) the median total number of counseling sessions attended as part of usual cessation care per participant at 6 months; 4) the proportion of the sample retained as a result of retention procedures over time (up to 12 months). Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence will be defined as 1) reporting not smoking a single cigarette in the past 7 days, not even a puff, 2) having CO levels\ufffd5 ppm, and 3) urinary anatabine and anabasine (i.e., metabolites of tobacco)<2 ng/ml [79] (analyzed by the UCSF Cancer Center Tobacco Biomarkers Core [80]). Urinary anatabine and anabasine are tobacco alkaloids that are useful as confirmatory biomarkers to verify abstinence among patients who are using NRT for smoking cessation and for whom urinary cotinine would not be appropriate [79].\nSecondary outcomes will include 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 2 weeks, 3 months\nand 12 months of follow up (i.e., 6 months after incentives stop), as well as prolonged abstinence, defined as participants 1) not smoking a single cigarette since their last visit, and 2) having CO levels\ufffd5 ppm from baseline to 3 months and baseline to 6 months [81].

            "text": "Mental health and substance use disorders among people experiencing homelessness, combined with poor access to healthcare, contribute to poor health outcomes [8] and add to the importance of addressing tobacco use in this vulnerable population. While prior efforts have focused on guideline-recommended cessation care\u2014behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy [12\u201316]\u2014adjunctive interventions to cessation care could help PEH initate and sustain quit attempts. CM provides external motivation to engage in a health behavior. This in turn may facilitate smoking cessation by increasing self-efficacy and encouraging the use of cessation medications [87].\nAlthough several studies have demonstrated feasibility of short-term contingency manage-\nment, [22\u201325] studies exploring sustainable ways to promote long-term abstinence are lacking. The proposed protocol addresses this gap by incentivizing and tracking tobacco abstinence for up to 6 months.\nOur trial has several strengths. First, the pragmatic nature of this pilot trial will allow us to\nassess the feasibility of an intervention integrated within clinical practice settings. If feasible, the intervention could be implemented at other safety-net clinics with relative ease. A largerscale, pragmatic RCT would then improve generalizability of findings to other safety-net practice settings. Second, our methodology innovatively leverages the EHR to recruit participants, establish a registry of enrollees to obtain information on cessation services utilization, and communicate with providers to optimize protocol adherence and consistency. Through the EHR, we will be able to track participant receipt of various cessation interventions in addition to missed opportunities, mitigating the need to collect this data from individual participants. While the existence of an EHR registry is sophisticated, it could be easily developed in clinics using EHR systems such as Epic and could also serve dual purpose by helping clinics meet Quality Incentive Program metrics [88]. Furthermore, the EHR infrastructure will facilitate the scalability of a full-scale RCT. Lastly, our study employs intensive outreach procedures specifically tailored to the study population to maximize recruitment and retention, which include: obtaining multiple forms of contact, conducting study outreach to visit participants at sites where they spend time, contacting clinical staff to locate participants, incentivizing checkin visits between months 6 and 12 after CM payments have stopped, and incentivizing participants to refer other patients to the study [40\u201347].\nOne common criticism of contingency management is that the intervention effects may\nwane after contingency management is terminated. We hope to circumvent this by offering contingency management for up to 6 months\u2014which is 3 months longer than most contingency management interventions in the general population [59] and 5 months longer than those among PEH [22\u201325]. Those participants who achieve abstinence for 6 months are less likely to experience waning of intervention effects. We will evaluate the extent to which\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278870 December 16, 2022 11 / 17\nabstinence at 6 months is sustained at 12 months of follow up, 6 months after termination of incentives.\nThis pilot pragmatic RCT will advance our understanding of the feasibility and acceptability\nof extended CM interventions for PEH. If found to be feasible, acceptable, and subsequently efficacious in a large-scale RCT, the extended duration CM intervention has the potential to reduce tobacco-related health disparities by increasing long-term abstinence among this vulnerable population."
