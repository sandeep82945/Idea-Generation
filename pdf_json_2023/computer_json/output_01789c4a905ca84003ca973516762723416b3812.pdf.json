    "abstractText": "In this article, we propose a new observer design for systems whose output is sampled in an aperiodic and asynchronous way and for which a continuous-time homogeneous observer of negative degree is available. The proposed method consists in adapting the existing continuous-time observer in order to cope with the fact that only sampled measurements are available instead of continuous ones. The obtained observer error is shown to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded for any upper bound on the sampling periods. Furthermore, the ultimate bound decreases as the upper bound on the sampling periods decreases. The stability analysis is based on a Lyapunov approach and the performances of the proposed observer are illustrated with simulations.",

The proposed method consists in adapting the existing continuous-time observer in order to cope with the fact that only sampled measurements are available instead of continuous ones. The obtained observer error is shown to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded for any upper bound on the sampling periods. Furthermore, the ultimate bound decreases as the upper bound on the sampling periods decreases.

            "text": "The study of nonlinear observers has been an active research area for several decades [1]. Indeed, they are powerful tools with a large number of possible applications since they allow to reconstruct all the states of a system from the model and the measured outputs only. This can be useful when all the states cannot be measured, for example when sensors do not exist which is the case in robotics to reconstruct sti ness [2] or in process control for some speci c variables [3]. Another reason can be that the sensors are too expensive in some cases such as an industry production for example. Another use can be to check that the available sensors are working correctly by using such observers for fault detection and isolation [4].\nMany approaches have then been developed to design such observers. One of the rst ideas has been to transform nonlinear systems into a linear ones so that observers can be constructed [5]. Transformations\nEmail addresses: e-mail: tomas.menard@unicaen.fr (Tomas M\u00e9nard), e-mail: emmanuel.bernuau@agroparistech.fr (Emmanuel Bernuau), emmanuel.moulay@univ-poitiers.fr (Emmanuel Moulay), patrick.coirault@univ-poitiers.fr (Patrick Coirault).\ninto more general forms have also been considered such as in [6] for example. General classes of systems such that observers can be designed have also been considered. For Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) uniformly observable systems, a high gain observer can always be constructed [7], though the change of coordinates can be di cult to nd. General classes of Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) uniformly observable systems have also been considered in [8]. Some other approaches rely on the speci c structure of the system, such as backstepping [9] or adaptive observers [10].\nHomogeneity has been considered more recently for observer design [11 13], though it has been introduced early in [14] and [15]. Homogeneity is an interesting property since it is well suited to approximation or domination design [16,17]. Other properties can also be obtained from homogeneity of systems, such as nite-time or xed-time stability for example [18,19]. Several structures of observers have been developed. One way is to use an inductive approach such as backstepping [20]. One can also rely on the fact that the considered homogeneous observer is close to an observer whose convergence is already established [21]. Another possible approach is to consider an Implicit Lyapunov Function (ILF) [22].\nIn the aforementioned works, the outputs are supposed to be available continuously, but this is rarely the case\nPreprint submitted to Automatica\nin practice. Indeed, most observers are implemented digitally on computers or micro controllers, the output is then usually sampled and the sampling times may be aperiodic [23]. This may be the case when there are packet dropouts in Networked Control Systems (NCS) [24] or in order to lower the load of a network when it is used by many agents at the same time [25]. One way is to use a fully discrete-time approach [26], but one loses the physical meaning of the states and only semiglobal stability might result. Another way is to use the emulation method [27], which means that a continuous observer is rst synthesized and discretized afterward. A third way is to adapt the continuous observer to obtain a so called continuous-discrete time observer which uses the discrete-time measurements and provide a continuous estimation of the states. Several designs have been proposed following this way. A rst idea is to use observers whose state is reset whenever a new measurement is received. A high gain approach has been used in [28] for a class of linear systems up to input injections and for a class of uniformly observer systems whose nonlinear part is input dependant in [29]. LMIs have been used to guarantee the stability in [30] for a class of nonlinear systems using reachability analysis, in [31] using an hybrid approach, for a class of systems whose dynamics is assumed to belong to a polytopic set of matrices in [32], for a class of linear systems with noise analysis in [33] and for the same class of linear systems but with a less conservative approach in [34]. Another idea is to use continuous observers based on an output error predictor which is reset when a new measurement is received. This approach has been rst used in [35] and then in [36] using a high-gain approach and in [37] by using LMIs. Both continuous and discontinuous observers have been combined in [38].\nIt has been shown recently that sampled homogeneous systems enjoy good properties. Indeed, depending on the degree of homogeneity either global practical stability or semi-global asymptotic stability can be obtained [39]. Furthermore, it has been shown in [40] that robustness with respect to exogenous disturbance in the dynamics is also obtained. Such results have also been obtained for time-delay systems which can be seen as a more general framework than sampled systems, such as in [41,42].\nIn this paper, we are particularly interested in the adaptation of homogeneous observers of negative degree (the precise meaning of homogeneous observer will be detailed in the following) in order to cope with the sampling of the output. Several features of the proposed design are worth being emphasized:\ni) the proposed observer error is globally uniformly ultimately bounded.\nii) a Lyapunov function is explicitly constructed for the continuous-discrete time observer.\niii) the vector eld representing the original systemmay be non-homogeneous, which is not the case of [39]. iv) simulations show that the performances of the proposed scheme are better than the one proposed in [39].\nThe paper is organized as follows. The class of systems and the di erent assumptions are stated in section 2. Section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the proposed continuous-discrete time observer. Some simulations are provided in section 4 in order to show the performances of the proposed scheme. Finally, section 5 ends the paper."

(4)\nRemark 1 Since the function U is homogeneous of degree dU with respect to the weights (\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n), several useful properties can be derived using Lemma 4.2 in [43]. Firstly, the function \u2202U/\u2202ej is homogeneous of degree\ndU \u2212 \u03b1j and continuous, hence there exists \u03baj \u2265 0 such that \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202U\u2202ej (e) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03baj n\u2211 l=1 |el| dU\u2212\u03b1j \u03b1l .

(6)\nRemark 2 It can be noted that the vector eld f is not assumed to be homogeneous. Nevertheless, in general, some homogeneous properties will be required to obtain a homogeneous Lyapunov function U for the error system. For example, such Lyapunov functions can be found for systems where f is composed of an homogeneous drift term f1(x), which is homogeneous of degree \u03b1 < 0 with respect to the weights (\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n), and a term f2(x, u) which will be dominated in the stability analysis, such as in [20] for example.\nRemark 3 While the form of observer (2) seems restrictive, it should be noted that it is typically obtained in other coordinates than those of the system and an estimate of the state can be obtained by inversing the change of coordinates."

Let E \u2208 Rn+1 and t \u2265 0, then there exists a unique k \u2208 N such that t \u2208 [tk, tk+1) and V (E, t) is de ned as\nV (E, t) = U(e) + exp(\u03b4(tk+1 \u2212 t))|e0| dU dh , (12)\nwith \u03b4 > 0.

In particular, it is required that some H\u00f6lder properties hold:\nAssumption 2 (i) For all x1 = (x11, . . . , x 1 n), x 2 = (x21, . . . , x 2 n) \u2208 Rn and u \u2208 R, there exists \u03bd1 \u2265 0\nsuch that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202h\u2202x (x1)f(x1, u)\u2212 \u2202h\u2202x (x2)f(x2, u) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2264 \u03bd1 n\u2211 i=1 |x1i \u2212 x2i | dh+\u03b1 \u03b1i .

(14)\nTheorem 1 (Ultimate Boundedness) Consider system (1) and observer (9) (10) subject to Assumption 2, then for any Tmax \u2265 Tmin > 0 the error system (11) is globally stable and there exist K \u2265 0, independent of Tmax, such that the set E =  e0 e1 ...\nen\n \u2208 Rn+1 : U(e) + |e0| dU dh \u2264 K(Tmax) dU \u2212\u03b1  (15)\nis globally attractive.\nRemark 4 Theorem 1 states that the proposed observer cannot explode in nite-time even if the upper bound on the sampling periods period increases. This is not the case for most of the existing observers since if the sampling periods increases too much, the observer usually becomes unstable. This of course does not mean that the observation error stay small since it increases as Tmax increases. Nevertheless, this is a very interesting feature since it allows\nto keep satisfactory performances even when approaching the limit where other observers become unstable as it can be seen in the example section. This can also be useful to allow a very fast recovery of the estimation for example when the sampling instants are irregular and the sampling periods become large at some moments.\nProof. The proof is divided into three steps. In Step 1, one shows that the Lyapunov function candidate V is decreasing when new measurements are available, that is for t = tk with k \u2208 N. In Step 2, one is interested in the behavior of the error dynamics when the dynamics is continuous, that is when t \u2208 [tk, tk+1) with k \u2208 N. An over-valuation of the derivative of V is then obtained. In Step 3, the results of Steps 1 and 2 are combined to show that the observer error is globally uniformly ultimately bounded.\nStep 1. Step 1 is rather direct, indeed, since the dynamics of e are continuous (e(t\u2212k ) = e(tk)) and since e0(tk) = 0, one has\nV (E(t\u2212k ), t \u2212 k ) = U(e(t \u2212 k )) + exp(\u03b4(tk \u2212 tk))|e0(t \u2212 k )|\ndU dh\n= U(e(tk)) + |e0(t\u2212k )| dU dh\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u22650\n\u2265 U(e(tk)) + exp(\u03b4(tk+1 \u2212 tk)) |e0(tk)| dU dh\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=0\n\u2265 V (E(tk), tk) (16)\nStep 2.

The system is initialized as x(0) = [\u221210, \u22125, 2]T . The sampling times belong to the interval [Tmin, Tmax] which will be de ned\nlater depending on the simulations. The output is assumed to be measured with a Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation equal to 2, it is illustrated on Figure 1. It can be seen that system (25) is homogeneous of degree \u22120.2 with respect to the weights (1, 0.8, 0.6) and an homogeneous observer is given by \u02d9\u0302x1(t) = x\u03022(t)\u2212 0.1dx\u03021(t)c0.8 \u2212 k1dx1(t)\u2212 x\u03021(t)c0.8 \u02d9\u0302x2(t) = x\u03023(t) + 0.1dx\u03021(t)c0.6 + 0.1dx\u03022(t)c0.75 \u2212 k2dx1(t)\u2212 x\u03021(t)c0.6 \u02d9\u0302x3(t) = \u22120.5dx\u03021(t)c0.4 \u2212 0.5dx\u03022(t)c0.5\n\u2212 dx\u03023(t)c2/3 + u(t)\u2212 k3dx1(t)\u2212 x\u03021(t)c0.4 (26)\nwith the gains chosen as k1 = 3, k2 = 3 and k3 = 1. The adapted continuous-discrete time observer as proposed in this paper is then given by \u02d9\u0302z(t) = \u2212k1dz\u0302(t)c0.8 \u02d9\u0302x1(t) = x\u03022(t)\u2212 0.1dx\u03021(t)c0.8 \u2212 k1dz\u0302(t)c0.8 \u02d9\u0302x2(t) = x\u03023(t) + 0.1dx\u03021(t)c0.6 + 0.1dx\u03022(t)c0.75 \u2212 k2dz\u0302(t)c0.6 \u02d9\u0302x3(t) = \u22120.5dx\u03021(t)c0.4 \u2212 0.5dx\u03022(t)c0.5\n\u2212 dx\u03023(t)c2/3 + u(t)\u2212 k3dz\u0302(t)c0.4 z\u0302(tk) = x1(tk)\u2212 x\u03021(tk)\n(27) The stability of the continuous observer and a homogeneous Lyapunov function can be obtained by following the approaches developed in [20] or [44] but are rather involved and then not reported here.

For the considered example, there is a convenient way to explain the ultimate boundedness of the proposed observer. Indeed, the predictor z\u0302 for the output error is nite-time stable and so it becomes zero after a nite time and the observer dynamics is then a copy of the system dynamics. This explains why the observer does not become unstable with a large Tmax contrarily to most existing approaches. The observer proposed in this paper is compared with the ones proposed in [39, Proposition 15] and [45] with the same gains k1, k2, k3. All the observers are initialized as x\u03021(0) = x\u03022(0) = x\u03023(0) = 0. The rst simulation is done with relatively small sampling times, that is Tmin = 0.05s and Tmax = 0.1s. As it can be seen on Figure 2 the three observers perform well. The quadratic errors are respectively equal to 0.77 for the proposed observer, 0.88 for the observer from [39] and 0.93 for the observer from [45].\nThe second simulation is done with Tmin = Tmax = 1s. In that case, it can be seen on Figure 3 that the proposed observer and the one from [45] perform well while the one from [39] is not very accurate. The quadratic errors are respectively equal to 2.28 for the proposed observer, 661.25 for the observer from [39] and 2.88 for the observer from [45].\nThe last simulation is done with Tmin = Tmax = 2.65s which corresponds to the maximum allowable sampling time for which the observer from [45] is stable. It can be\nseen that the proposed observer is the only one that performs well. The quadratic errors are respectively equal to 128.9 for the proposed observer, 2.5\u00d7 105 for the observer from [39] and 3.9\u00d7103 for the observer from [45]."

            "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a new observer for homogeneous systems of negative degree whose output is available only at some discrete instants. It has been proved that the proposed observer error is globally uniformly ultimately bounded for any maximum sampling time. The proposed observer has been compared with a classical continuous-discrete time observer which has a maximum allowable sampling period and it has been shown in simulation that the proposed observer still performs well while the classical continuous-discrete time observer is at its limit. While the proposed observer perform well for small sampling times, it is only ultimately\nbounded, so future works will be concerned with the extension of the proposed observer so that it is exponentially stable for small maximum sampling periods and still practically stable for larger sampling periods."
