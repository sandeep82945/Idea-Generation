During 1969\u201375 he served as assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Helsinki and from 1975\u201393 as professor of medicine at the University of Kuopio and senior physician at the Department of Medicine at Kuopio University Hospital. In 1982 he was appointed member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences. His extensive and important scientific contributions covered diabetes and CVD principally from an epidemiological perspective. Within the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) his contributions were focused on developing the speciality of CVD epidemiology and prevention.\nIn 1974 he was elected secretary of the Section on Epidemiology and Prevention of the International Society and Federation of Cardiology (ISFC) and served in that capacity for two periods until 1982 first under the chairmanship of Professor Jeremiah Stamler (Northwestern University, Chicago, USA) and in 1978\u201382 under the chairmanship of\nProfessor Geoffrey Rose (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of London, UK).\nIn the mid 1970s, when the section had about 150 European members, Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 thought that it would be useful to establish a European subsection to improve communication among European workers in this field. He and Geoffrey Rose proposed this to the Executive Council of the ISFC Section but it was not accepted.\nSince plans were in progress to reorganise the ESC by creating working groups in speciality areas of cardiovascular medicine, Rose and Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 realised that this would be the opportunity to create a European network among workers in the field of CVD epidemiology and prevention. They proposed to create a working group on epidemiology and prevention, and this was accepted by the ESC Board at the ESC Congress in 1976 in Amsterdam, with Geoffrey Rose and Karl-Heinrich G\u00fcnther (Charit\u00e9 Hospital, Humboldt University, Berlin, DDR) as the founding chairpersons. Kalevi Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 volunteered to act as its secretary (1976\u201379) and to formulate a proposal for its working rules.\nScientific meetings of the working group took place annually from 1978 to 2004 in academic surroundings; and the Working Group merged in 2004 with that of Cardiac Rehabilitation and Exercise Physiology into the European Association for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Rehabilitation renamed in 2016 the European Association of Preventive Cardiology, presently constituting an important part of the ESC.\nKalevi Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 initiated the Helsinki Policemen Study in 1966 as one of the first European prospective CVD studies. He was further involved as investigator, committee member, and/or councillor in various international landmark projects such as the WHO-MONICA project (MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease), the 4S trial (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study), the ESC EUROASPIRE surveys (EUROpean Action on Prevention and Intervention to Reduce Events), and the SCORE study (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation).\nHe was key to the organization and host of the first ISFC Advanced Ten-Day Seminar on CVD epidemiology, held in Tuohilampi, Finland in 1982, where the INTERSALT study was outlined and designed.\nHe was also on the faculty of the Ten-Day CVD Epidemiology Seminar for Spanish and Latin-American students that Ignacio\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurheartj/article/44/17/1491/7116655 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\n1492 CardioPulse\nBalaguer-Vintro and Susana Sans organized in El Paular, Rascafr\u00eda, Madrid in 1985.\nKalevi Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 was co-author of the milestone 1982 WHO technical report number 678 \u2018Prevention of coronary heart disease\u2019, which laid the foundations for both individual high-risk and population strategies of CVD prevention. Moreover, he was a key driver of a related report \u2018Prevention of coronary heart disease in Finland\u2019 convened by several Finnish institutions in 1987.\nDuring the ESC presidency of Professor Philip Poole-Wilson, and on Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4\u2019s initiative, experts in CVD prevention from the ESC, the European Atherosclerosis Society, and the European Society of Hypertension were brought together in a joint task force to publish in 1994: \u2018Recommendations on prevention of coronary heart disease\u2019 with himself as first author. That year, the ESC began to issue guidelines on different aspects of CVD. Kalevi Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 was deeply involved as part of the writing groups of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th joint guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice.\nFrom 1988 till 1994 Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 served on the ESC Board of Directors. His knowledge of the literature in the field of CVD was phenomenal, and his opinions always balanced and sound. Due to his scientific achievements and outstanding importance for CVD prevention, Kalevi Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 was awarded with the ESC gold medal in 2000.\nIn sum, Kalevi was an outstanding epidemiologist and academic leader who touched the lives of all his colleagues. We most remember his warm friendship and loyalty, and his generosity in sharing wisdom and support with friends and colleagues.\nIn private life, Kalevi was a violoncello player, a lover of music with particular interest in the opera and in symphonic concerts.\nKalevi Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 is mourned by his wife Ritva, his four daughters Eeva, Elina, Marja, and Sari, and his grandson Leo.\nGuy De Backer on behalf of close colleagues of Kalevi Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4 (see Acknowledgments).\nAcknowledgements Many thanks to Henry Blackburn, Dirk De Bacquer, Ian Graham, Lars Ryd\u00e9n, Susana Sans, Dag S.
