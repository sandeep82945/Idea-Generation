    "abstractText": "The inclusion complexes of cucurbit[n]uril, CB[n] (n = 6\u20138), with poly aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) Benzo(a)Pyrene (BaP), and fluoranthene (FLT) were investigated carefully in aqueous media. Fluorescence and 1H NMR spectroscopy were used to characterize and investigate the inclusion complexes that were prepared in the aqueous media. The most predominant complexes of both guests with hosts were the 1:1 guest: host complexes. Stability constants of 2322\u00b1 547 M\u22121, 7281\u00b1 689 M\u22121, 3566 \u00b1 473 M\u22121 were obtained for the complexes of BaP with CB[6], CB[7], and CB[8], respectively. On the other hand, stability constants of 5900.270 \u00b1 326 M\u22121, 726.87 \u00b1 78 M\u22121, 3327.059 \u00b1 153 M\u22121 were obtained for the complexes of FLT with CB[6], CB[7], and CB[8], respectively. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to study the mode and mechanism of the inclusion process and to monitor the stability of these complexes in aqueous media at an atomistic level. Analysis of MD trajectories has shown that both BaP and FLT form stable inclusion complexes with CB[7] and CB[8] in aqueous media throughout the simulation time, subsequently corroborating the experimental results. Nevertheless, the small size of CB[6] prohibited the encapsulation of the two PAHs inside the cavity, but stable exclusion complex was observed between them. The main driving forces for the stability of these complexes are the hydrophobic forces, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic effect, the \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interaction. These results suggest that BaP and FLT can form stable complexes with CB[n] (n = 6\u20138) in solution.",

Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to study the mode and mechanism of the inclusion process and to monitor the stability of these complexes in aqueous media at an atomistic level. Analysis of MD trajectories has shown that both BaP and FLT form stable inclusion complexes with CB[7] and CB[8] in aqueous media throughout the simulation time, subsequently corroborating the experimental results. Nevertheless, the small size of CB[6] prohibited the encapsulation of the two PAHs inside the cavity, but stable exclusion complex was observed between them. The main driving forces for the stability of these complexes are the hydrophobic forces, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic effect, the \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interaction.

            "text": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a large group of over 200 different compounds only made of carbon and hydrogen atoms containing two or more fused aromatic rings present in a mixture [1,2]. PAHs occur naturally in fossil fuels and as a byproduct of combustion or subjection processes involved in incineration and power generation [3]. They are nonpolar, with a highly hydrophobic and lipophilic nature, and occur as colorless, white/pale yellow solids with high melting and boiling points, and low vapor pressure [4]. PAHs are noxious and persistent organic pollutants, although they have low water solubility and exist in the environment at very low concentrations. They can easily cross the lipid membranes, are strongly bioaccumulative, and may interfere in normal DNA functioning. Hence, they are ecologically hazardous and can cause severe health hazards to humans, mainly in the form of cancer [5\u20137]. Since PAHs represent an emerging class of pollutants, and due to their recognized adverse effects, monitoring their levels is important in evaluating the risk associated with human consumption of food and various environmental exposure [5].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1136. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28031136 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1136 2 of 17\nBenzo(a)Pyrene (BaP) is among the most carcinogenic PAHs. It is a molecule with five fused, hexagonal rings [8] (Figure 1d). BaP exists as a vapor at high temperatures or as adsorbed particulate, and it persists for long periods in the atmosphere in the particulate phase. The best way to remove BaP from the atmosphere is by photochemical oxidation [9]. BaP has a genotoxic nature, it can accumulate in various organs [10], it has been listed as a priority pollutant [11]. BaP is pleotropic, and can affect many cell- and organ-based systems. Hence, there are probably many modes of carcinogenic actions operating to a different extent in vivo [12]. BaP is widely used as a marker for total carcinogenic PAHs [13]. Fluoranthene (FLT) is ubiquitous in the environment and has been detected in air, foodstuff, and in drinking waters [14]. FLT has high thermal and air stability, and excellent fluorescent emission, as a result of which it has attracted intense attention in the area of optoelectronics, especially for organic light-emitting diodes [15].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 19\nfere in normal DNA functioning.

PAH detection procedures suffer from several major drawbacks; therefore, to validate a new more sensitive, selective, cheap, and easy analytical procedure, this paper shines new light on the influence of this macrocyclic molecule in the spectroscopic behavior of BaP and FLT. The complexes between the guests and these cavitands are developed in an attempt to enhance the electronic properties of the guests such as the fluorescence. This will allow the establishment of a platform for the development of simple direct analytical methods for their quantification in complex matrixes such as food sample. The complexes in the solution were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, we utilized MD simulations in aqueous media to have a better insight into the major interactions between the guest and host and to identify the main factors stabilizing the complexes formed."

On the other hand, the structures of the hosts were extracted from the crystallographic parameters provided by the Structural Data Base System of the Cambridge crystallographic data center and were optimized by minimizing their energy using the PM6 semi-empirical method using MOPAC 2012 [26,27]. Molecular docking experiments were performed using the Autodock Iprogram (version 4.2) [28]. In this work, we used a Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) for docking the guest into the host\u2019s cavity to generate the inclusion complexes of the most appropriate conformation.

The lowest-energy structures were further optimized using the PM6 semi-empirical model. The MD simulations were carried out using the Desmond molecular simulations package, as distributed in the Schrodinger 2015 suite of programs. The OPLS_2005 all-atom force field with explicit solvent (TIP3P water model) was used throughout the calculations. Simulations were run with periodic boundary conditions, in an orthorhombic box with the solute, viz., placed in the middle at 20 \u00c5 distance from each of the box\u2019s edges. The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain covalent bonds between hydrogen and heavy atoms. Longrange electrostatic interactions were dealt with using the Ewald smooth particle mesh (PME) method [29]. The solvated molecules were subjected to sequential restraint solvent-solute minimizations and short MD simulations on NVT-NPT ensembles (as implemented in the default relaxation protocol in Desmond) coupled to the Berendsen thermostat. Finally, the production run was NPT run at 300 K and 1 bar. The simulations were then analyzed using the \u201csimulation event analysis\u201d module in the Schrodinger 2015 suite."

The fluorescence emission spectrum of BaP shows two intense characteristic vibronic structure emission bands at 405 and 420 nm and a broader less intense one at 540 nm when excited at 385 nm (Figure 2). At high BaP concentration, a structureless broad peak appears at 540 nm, we have noticed that this broad peak is vanishing at low concentration (less than 5\u00d7 10\u22127 M) and upon complexation. According to the literature, some organic molecules tend to form aggregates in aqueous media through \u03c0-\u03c0 type interactions between the aromatic rings [30]; specifically, BaP forms ground-state pairs that exhibit a redshift in the fluorescence spectrum compared to the concerning monomer [2]. Hence, we infer that this peak is for an excimer species. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 19\nFigure 2.

Ka is an association or binding constant of the complex, it is a measurement of the thermodynamic stability of the host\u2013guest complex at a given temperature in a given solvent [41]. The enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of the guests as a function of the added hosts fits well, assuming the formation of a 1:1 complex. The results are summarized in Table 1.

In addition to the host size, the packing coefficient (PC) can provide further explanation for this variation. PC is defined as the ratio of guest volume to the volume of the host cavity. It is considered one of the most important factors determining the stability of the host\u2013guest complex. It works as an estimator of the steric goodness of fit of host\u2013guest inclusion complexes. In general, stable inclusion complexes result when PC values are in the range from 45 to 65% [33,42]. Five-membered rings BaP perfectly match and pack the CB[7] cavity, giving a higher and more stable association constant than all of the other hosts. The large cavity of CB[8] allows the optimization of the water H-bond network to a degree that is structurally similar to bulk water, with the result that the energy contribution for water release is less from CB[8] than from CB[7] [34]. Despite its larger cavity, FLT superbly matches the CB[8] cavity. Surprisingly, the external CB[6]\u2013guest complex is highly stable, too; the host molecules act as a solvent, and the dipole moment of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1136 8 of 17\nthe fluorophore interacts with the reactive fields induced in the surrounding solvent which led to the strength of the resulting complex [43]."

            "text": "NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the interactions of the host\u2013guest molecules by providing detailed information on the molecular structure [44], and it can provide evidence for the inclusion of guests inside the host molecules by the monitoring the alteration of the chemical shift values before and after complexation and by the changes that might affect the shape of the proton signals. The proton\u2019s chemical and the electronic environment of protons are affected by complexation with ensuing changes in the chemical shift values (\u03b4) [39]. A significant change in the \u03b4 of the protons of both guest and host can be observed in the solution of the pure component as compared to the solution of the complex. The resonance signals of the BaP and FLT protons in the 1H NMR spectrum changed with the addition of the three hosts (Figures 6 and 7). 1H NMR of pure BaP exhibit twelve different aromatic protons peaks ranging from 9.253 ppm\u20137.861 ppm, which are highly deshielded by the large anisotropic field generated by electron cloud in the ring\u2019s \u03c0 system [45]. The addition of CB[n] (n = 6\u20138) into the BaP solution induces spectral shifts suggesting changes in the surrounding electron or magnetic environment (Figures 6 and 7). The induced changes in the proton chemical shifts for BaP in the presence of these macrocyclic hosts are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. All BaP protons are shifted upfield upon complexation with CB[8], which means that the interior of the cavity provides magnetic shielding to the protons of the included guest. Nevertheless, CB[6] has a small cavity volume for B[a]P, but all B[a]P protons are shifted upfield in presence of this cavitand. BaP protons in its solution are highly deshielded by the \u03c0 ring system of the neighboring BaP molecule (BaP exists in excimer form [30]). Disturbance of this excimer by addition of CB[6] shifted these protons to the lowest deshielding effect, hence, \u2206\u03b4 < 0 was observed. With regard to CB[7], none of the protons underwent the same chemical shift (up- and downfield), this suggests that the chemical shift changes observed are due to ring currentinduced shifts resulting from the reorientation of the rings A and D relative to the ring B, C, and E in the inclusion complex. One interesting finding is that all BaP peaks are sharp and well resolved in the presence of the hosts, reflecting a slower rate of exchange due to the inclusion complexation [46]. The 1H NMR of pure fluoranthene (FLT) exhibited five different aromatic peaks that were in good agreement with the documented values, ranging from 8.143 ppm to 7.438 ppm, which were shifted upon addition of the three hosts (Figure 7), giving evidence to support complexation [47]. It is worth mentioning here that FLT is a non-alternate aromatic hydrocarbon-containing angle strain that has different physicochemical behavior from an alternant one [48]. CB[8] is the only host that shifted the guest proton signal up-field, as shown in Figure 7d, hence the interior of the CB[8] cavity provides magnetic shielding to the protons of the included guest. The CB[8] cavity width is slightly too small to allow horizontal encapsulation of FLT, so it is diagonally located with respect to the axis of CB[8] [34]. Diederich et al. confirms that all protons in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the host are shifted up-field [49]. All FLT protons are shifted downfield after the addition of CB[6] and CB[7]; Figure 7b,c. This result is indicative of complex formation. The observed downfield shifts of the guest protons can be attributed to the anisotropic effect change in their surrounding environment [50]. After complexation, the radius of gyration of our guest is small which moves the guest protons more near the deshielding cone of the benzene ring and they will be affected by it more than the cavity hydrophobic shielding effect. The analysis of which specific guest protons are shifted up- or down-field provides important structural information about the nature and the specific mode of the inclusion. The question is: do parts or all the guests reside inside the cavity? And which side of the molecule is inserted into the cavity of the host? The value and sign of \u2206\u03b4 are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 could provide answers to these questions. All protons of the guest have been shifted with the same sign which is decided by the host used, for\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1136 9 of 17\ninstance \u2206\u03b4 is >0 for the FLT-CB[6]/CB[7] complexes and <0 for the FLT-CB[8] complex. This indicates that they are exposed to the same impact. As mentioned in the literature, the variations in hydrogen chemical shifts are mainly due to the difference in the C-C (\u03c0) and the C-C (\u03c3) contributions [51].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 19\nless, CB[6] has a small cavity volume for B[a]P, but all B[a]P protons are shifted upfield in presence of this cavitand.

The existence of the complexes was supported by fluorescence spectrophotometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. All results indicated the formation of 1:1 host: guest complexes. Packing coefficient PC and size complementarity plays a vital role in the complexation mechanism. Changes in the 1H NMR signals and \u03b4 value of the guest protons signify that the chemical and electronic environment of these protons is affected due to complexation. Molecular Dynamic MD simulations indicated that all complexes were stable in aqueous media during the simulation time. CB[6] forms an external association stable complex, but CB[7] and CB[8] form encapsulate the guests inside their cavity. Formation of diffraction patterns different from those recorded for pure hosts and guests are guaranteed evidence of inclusion complex formation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.E. and F.O.S.; Methodology, A.A.A.; Software, F.O.S.; Investigation, A.A.A.; Writing\u2014original draft, A.A.A.; Writing\u2014review & editing, A.A.E., F.O.S. and A.O.A.; Supervision, A.A.E.; Project administration, A.O.A.; Funding acquisition, A.O.A.
