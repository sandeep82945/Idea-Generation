Community detection is an important and powerful way to understand the latent structure of complex networks in social network analysis. This paper considers the problem of estimating community memberships of nodes in a directed network, where a node may belong to multiple communities. For such a directed network, existing models either assume that each node belongs solely to one community or ignore variation in node degree. Here, a directed degree corrected mixed membership (DiDCMM) model is proposed by considering degree heterogeneity. An efficient spectral clustering algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of consistent estimation is designed to fit DiDCMM. We apply our algorithm to a small scale of computer-generated directed networks and several real-world directed networks.
