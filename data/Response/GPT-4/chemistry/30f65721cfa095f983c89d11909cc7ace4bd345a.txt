Isolation and Characterization of Specific Bioactive Compounds: The study identifies numerous compounds within C. gileadensis, such as Î²-myrcene, nonane, and caffeic acid phenyl ester, with significant biological activities. Future research could focus on isolating these compounds to determine their specific mechanisms of action, therapeutic potentials, and any synergistic effects when combined.

Clinical Trials for Specific Health Conditions: Given the extract's demonstrated activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, and COX-1 inhibitory effects, clinical trials could be designed to test the efficacy of C. gileadensis extracts or its purified compounds in treating specific conditions like inflammation, arthritis, and bacterial infections in humans.

Formulation Development and Stability Studies: Exploring the development of pharmaceutical formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules, topical creams) containing C. gileadensis extracts or its active compounds could be beneficial. Studies could also assess the stability, shelf-life, and delivery efficacy of these formulations.

Investigating the Extract's Effect on Drug-resistant Microbial Strains: Given its antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria, further research could explore the extract's effectiveness against drug-resistant strains. This could lead to new, natural antimicrobial agents in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance.

Exploration of Anti-cancer Potential: With the plant's rich phenolic and flavonoid content demonstrating antioxidant activity, there's potential for investigating its anti-cancer properties. Future studies could focus on evaluating the extract's or specific compounds' ability to inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines.
