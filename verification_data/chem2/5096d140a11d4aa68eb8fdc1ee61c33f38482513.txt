"The taxonomy, phytochemistry, and biological activity of S. minor were reviewed. Various biological activities and applications of S. minor, including its antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral properties, have been investigated. In an attempt to establish a connection between the various biological activities and the primary bioactive compounds of S. minor, this review detailed the nutritional and phytochemical profile of the herbaceous plant, focusing in particular on the polyphenolic components found in all parts (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds). This updated study, in our opinion, will encourage more research into the phytochemistry and biological impacts of S. minor."
