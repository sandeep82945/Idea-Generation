    "abstractText": "Integrative top\u2013down proteomics is an analytical approach that fully addresses the breadth and complexity needed for effective and routine assessment of proteomes. Nonetheless, any such assessments also require a rigorous review of methodology to ensure the deepest possible quantitative proteome analyses. Here, we establish an optimized general protocol for proteome extracts to improve the reduction of proteoforms and, thus, resolution in 2DE. Dithiothreitol (DTT), tributylphosphine (TBP), and 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide (HED), combined and alone, were tested in one-dimensional SDSPAGE (1DE), prior to implementation into a full 2DE protocol. Prior to sample rehydration, reduction with 100 mM DTT + 5 mM TBP yielded increased spot counts, total signal, and spot circularity (i.e., decreased streaking) compared to other conditions and reduction protocols reported in the literature. The data indicate that many widely implemented reduction protocols are significantly \u2018under-powered\u2019 in terms of proteoform reduction and thus, limit the quality and depth of routine top\u2013down proteomic analyses.",

            "text": "Given their complexity and diversity, it is becoming far more widely recognized that analytical methods that do not effectively address the resolution of the full breadth of species (i.e., proteoforms) beyond primary amino acid sequences simply lack the depth required to provide an accurate, comprehensive characterization of proteomes [1\u20134]. Integrative top\u2013down proteomics\u2014tightly coupling two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE; isoelectric focusing (IEF) followed by SDS-PAGE), liquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/TMS), is currently the only available analytical approach that fully addresses the depth needed for effective and routine assessments of proteomes. In this regard, 2DE-based top\u2013down proteomics has been widely employed for quantitative proteome analysis due to its well-established capacity to resolve many thousands of intact proteoforms from complex native proteome extracts [4\u201310]. Since its introduction, 2DE methodology has undergone rigorous review and assessment to improve resolution, detection/sensitivity, and thus, overall analytical rigour [11\u201324]. These continued refinements enable an even greater understanding of proteome complexity, thus increasing the depth of analyses with a routine focus on proteoforms rather than only canonical amino acid sequences. Integrative top\u2013down proteomics is thus the only approach that currently enables deep proteome analyses (i.e., across a large range of pI and molecular weights) and, therefore, genuine understanding of molecular mechanisms and the identification of rational biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Disulfide bonds between sulfhydryl groups of cysteine side chains often regulate proteoform folding and final structure. If not appropriately addressed, disulfide bridges\nProteomes 2023, 11, 10. https://doi.org/10.3390/proteomes11010010 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/proteomes\nProteomes 2023, 11, 10 2 of 17\ncan break and reform during 2DE, both intra- or intermolecularly. Such \u2018scrambled bridges\u2019 can result in additional, non-native species (i.e., \u2018spots\u2019) on a 2D map of a proteome [25]. Thus, an appropriate concentration of effective reducing agent(s) is essential. A thorough, routine workflow for 2DE involves reduction and alkylation prior to IEF (i.e., prior to the first dimension of separation), followed by a second reduction and alkylation step between the first and second dimensions (i.e., during equilibration, prior to SDS-PAGE) to most fully ensure that there are no intact disulfide bonds. The reduction of disulfide bonds can be achieved by an equilibrium reaction with excess free thiols such as 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) or dithiothreitol (DTT) or in nonequilibrium reactions with trivalent phosphorus reagents such as tributylphosphine (TBP) [26\u201329]. A large excess of a sulfhydryl-reducing agent shifts the equilibrium of the oxidation/reduction reaction toward the fully reduced state. Historically, 2-ME was used at high concentrations (i.e., 200 mM) to ensure the maximal shift of the thiol\u2013disulfide equilibrium toward the thiol form of the species [30\u201332]. However, considering the volatile and toxic nature of 2-ME, DTT has been widely adopted as an alternative reducing agent. The intramolecular, cyclic condensation during the oxidation of DTT drives the equilibrium toward the thiolreduced state of the proteoform more efficiently compared to 2-ME, allowing for lower concentrations of DTT to be employed relative to 2-ME and further increasing the popularity and use of DTT [26,28]. However, DTT is a weak acid that consequently becomes negatively charged and can migrate toward the anode during IEF. Therefore, it is argued that DTT may not remain at constant concentrations in the basic region of an isolated pH gradient (IPG) strip, which could lead to the reformation of disulfide bonds and the possible precipitation of some disulfide-rich proteoforms [27,33]. As a result, minor artifacts, such as blurred spots and comet-like streaks, as well as the appearance or disappearance of spots, have been reported [24]. Thus, DTT has been supplemented with the non-ionic TBP that will not migrate to avoid the potential reformation of disulfide bonds during IEF. TBP thus helps to maintain reducing conditions throughout the IPG to give improved focusing and decreased streaking (i.e., better resolution) [11,18,26,27]. Alternative phosphines, such as TCEP, have been reported to be effective at lower concentrations due to their water-soluble, non-volatile, and stable characteristics [34\u201336]. Yet, despite being a \u2018more water-soluble\u2019 alternative to TBP, TCEP is a charged molecule and, thus, like DTT, can migrate within the IPG strip during IEF. Additionally, molecular modelling suggests that the thiolate of DTT is less sterically hindered than the phosphorus of TCEP due to steric crowding of the carboxyethyl substituents on TCEP and that the latter thus results in lower accessibility/reactivity with proteoform disulfides [36]. Additional organic disulfides have also been explored to provide a potential solution to the horizontal streaking that can arise in the basic region during the first dimension of 2DE. The streaking has been previously attributed to variations in the number of oxidized thiols in proteoforms, and the complete oxidation of thiol groups to mixed disulfides could thus eliminate streaking. Using an excess of 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED, which has also come to be known as \u2018DeStreakTM reagent\u2019) prior to the first dimension has been claimed to reduce streaking in the basic region; unfortunately, the comparisons were to quite low concentrations of DTT (i.e., notably well below excess) [37,38]. Thus, taking previous findings into consideration, an aspect of 2DE that has not undergone a thorough systematic analysis involves the reducing agents used, either alone or in combination, in the resolution of proteoforms. The present study thus contributes to the ongoing assessment and refinement of top\u2013down proteomics by optimizing the concentration of reducing agents and thus, the proteoform resolution enabled by 2DE. To establish a protocol that is most likely to be broadly applicable (i.e., \u2018universal\u2019), we tested both mammalian and plant extracts for improved proteome resolution. Protein standards with known disulfide content, such as albumin, were also used to test for a quantitative relationship between DTT concentration and a number of disulfide bonds. As in previous studies, one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (1DE), the second dimension of 2DE, was first utilized to test reagents and optimize refinements, followed by implementation into a\nProteomes 2023, 11, 10 3 of 17\nfull 2DE protocol to quantitatively confirm and validate the findings [15,16,19,21]. Notably, improvements in the resolution of proteome extracts by 1DE, quantified by changes to the number of bands resolved and the intensity or resolution of a given band, likely represents effects on tens to hundreds of proteoforms per band [5,7,9,39]. The results indicate that, to date, many studies have been \u2018under-powered\u2019 in terms of proteoform reduction; optimizing the concentration and combination of reducing reagents significantly improves integrative 2DE-based top\u2013down proteome analyses (and likely analyses by other methods as well)."

For proteome extracts, in addition to the total number of resolved bands, well-resolved bands (i.e., visible, minimal streaking, no leading or trailing edges) over a range of molecular weights (MWs) were chosen for analysis of band intensity and full peak width at half-maximal height (FWHM). For protein standards, the main monomer band was chosen. Lane signal intensity and band intensity on gel images were analyzed using Image Lab, as previously described [6,21]. The \u2018Lane Profile\u2019 generated by Image Lab displays a cross-section of each lane, rotated 90 degrees to generate a chromatogram-like graph from the 3D display of the gel, with volume intensity on the y-axis and relative front (Rf) on the x-axis (Supplementary Figure S1 provides an example). Lane-based background subtraction was performed using a \u2018rolling ball\u2019 algorithm with the disk size set to 0.1 mm [43]. The total number of bands resolved was quantified as the total number of peaks on the chromatogram-like graph. A screen capture of the lane profile was taken with image size (1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels), and y-axis intervals were kept consistent between gels. To \u2018calibrate\u2019 the screen captures in ImageJ, the straight-line selection tool was used to create a horizontal straight line measuring the distance between 0.00 to 1.00 Rf and scaled to 1844 pixels.

            "text": "To assess potential improvement in the resolution of proteoforms in 2DE, 1DE was first utilized to systematically test concentrations of reducing agents, individually and in combination. Potential improvements in the resolution were detected by changes in the total number of resolved bands, individual band intensity (i.e., signal), and FWHM. Proteome extracts resolved by 1DE yield relatively diffuse bands, each of which represents what would be numerous spots in 2DE gels and, therefore, countless proteoforms. Thus, decreases in FWHM (i.e., improved band resolution or \u2018sharpness\u2019) and increases in the intensity of 1DE bands serve as criteria to predict increasingly concentrated, compact spots in 2DE (i.e., increased resolution). Inter- and intra-gel total lane signals for all 1DE experiments were measured to ensure each lane was loaded with an equal amount of total protein (Supplementary Figure S2 given as an example) to ensure that changes in resolution could be attributed to varying reducing agent components, rather than spurious differences in lane loading [19,21]. No significant differences in lane loads were seen. For simplicity and conciseness of data presentation, a single replicate (i.e., lane) of each condition is shown in the Results section, but all replicates and individual experiments with their complete respective gel images are available in supplementary data (Supplementary Figure S3).\n3.1.1. Initial Testing of DTT\nA broad range of DTT concentrations, 12.5\u2013200 mM, was initially tested to identify an effective concentration. An effective concentration is defined as the minimum concentration required for DTT to be in assumed excess, driving the equilibrium of the proteome to the fully reduced state and above which no further significant improvements in resolution are detected. As 12.5 mM DTT was previously used routinely [16,19,20], this was selected as the baseline for comparison. To assess the relationship between disulfide bond content and DTT, protein standards with known disulfide bond content were used: BSA (17 disulfide bonds) and CEA (1 disulfide bond) (Figure 1; see also Supplementary Figure S4 for CEL, having 4 disulfide bonds). For BSA, there was a significant increase in monomer band intensity as DTT concentration was increased up to 150 mM, and FWHM was significantly lower with \u226550 mM DTT compared to 12.5 mM DTT. For CEA, no significant differences in monomer band intensity were measured, but FWHM significantly decreased with \u226550 mM compared to 12.5 mM DTT. For 1DE resolved extracted native proteomes, bands across a range of MWs were selected based on visually apparent qualitative improvements, as well as closely resolved bands. Most significant changes in the resolution of green lentil proteome extracts were detected as decreases in FWHM as DTT concentration was increased up to and above 100 mM (Figure 2A\u2013C). Significant changes in the resolution of mouse brain proteome extracts were detected as increases in band intensity and decrease in FWHM as DTT concentration was increased up to and above 150 mM (Figure 2E\u2013G).

Discussion Although there have been previous reports assessing, to some extent, the use of reducing reagents in 2DE, there does not appear to be a direct assessment between different sample types treated with these reagents, either alone or in combination [27,35,37,38,46,51,52]. It is acknowledged that there will not be a \u2018perfect\u2019 one-size-fits-all method; however, the goal here was to establish an optimized general protocol to enhance 2DE resolution and thus a breadth of research supported by routine integrative top-down proteomic analyses [7\u20139,11,12,53\u201361]. The data clearly indicate that for native proteome extracts, reduction using 100 mM DTT + 5 mM TBP prior to sample rehydration into IPG strips is superior to the current \u2018standard\u2019 as well as to other reagents previously reported in the literature. The current standard of 130 mM DTT (e.g., [11]) during the equilibration between the first and second dimensions of 2DE proved superior to the other reagents/combinations tested. Thus, in contrast to some opinions [33] it is also apparent that reduction (and alkylation) is best carried out both before and after IEF. Since the adoption of DTT as an alternative to 2-ME, it has become a standard reagent for reducing disulfide bonds in many 1DE and 2DE protocols. However, despite its popularity, an appropriate, effective concentration to ensure complete reduction of proteoforms in native proteomes, particularly during IEF, appeared not to have previously been quantitatively established. As with many routine aspects of 2DE, and indeed many analytical protocols, this was another which seemed somewhat \u2018historically\u2019 based on whichever earlier protocol was inherited or adopted from the literature; thus, concentrations generally in the range of 1-100 mM have been widely employed [7,8,19,24,62\u201365]. To determine an effective concentration, we first aimed to test for a relationship between disulfide bond content and DTT concentration using commercially purified protein standards. Initially it was hypothesized that a higher number of disulfide bonds would require an increased concentration of DTT. This was demonstrated in the comparison of BSA (17 disulfide bonds) to CEA (1 disulfide bond), in which higher DTT concentrations were required for significant improvements in resolving BSA. Conversely, we also resolved\nFigure 8. Representative 2DE gel images of total green lentil proteome.

As with many routine aspects of 2DE, and indeed many an lytical protocols, this was another which seemed so what \u2018historically\u2019 based on whichever earlier protocol was inherited or adopted from the literature; thus, concentrati s generally in the nge of 1\u2013100 mM have been widely mployed [7,8,19,24,62\u201365]. To determine an effective concentrati , we first aimed to test for a relationship between disulfide bond content and DTT concentration using commercially purified prote n standard . I itially,\nProteomes 2023, 11, 10 13 of 17\nit was hypothesized that a higher number of disulfide bonds would require an increased concentration of DTT. This was demonstrated in the comparison of BSA (17 disulfide bonds) to CEA (1 disulfide bond), in which higher DTT concentrations were required for significant improvements in resolving BSA. Conversely, we also resolved chicken egg lysozyme (4 disulfide bonds; Figure S4), but no significant improvements were detected with increasing DTT concentrations. This was consistent with previous reports that DTT should be used in excess to ensure complete reduction (i.e., shift the equilibrium to the fully reduced state), regardless of disulfide bond content [26,28]. Furthermore, an effective concentration may not simply correlate with the number of disulfide bonds but rather also with reagent accessibility to disulfide bridges and perhaps additionally with the nature of amino acid domains surrounding the cysteines involved in the bridges. Furthermore, these prove to be critical concepts when resolving extracted native proteomes, as the number and accessibility of disulfide bonds are inevitably unknown. Thus, following the reduction of extracted proteomes with a range of DTT concentrations, the 1DE data indicated that 100 mM DTT was the minimal effective concentration needed for optimal analysis. Lower concentrations of DTT were not sufficient, essentially \u2018underpowering\u2019 the analysis to varying extents. Due to the weak acid and ionic character of DTT, TBP has been used to supplement DTT, specifically during the first dimension of 2DE. TBP reduces thiols in a stoichiometric reaction and, therefore, can be utilized at lower concentrations. TBP has been demonstrated in previous reports to improve resolution, indicated by minimized horizontal streaking and increased spot count [27]. Although TBP was not tested here on its own in 2DE, mouse brain and green lentil proteome extracts reduced with TBP alone yielded poorer resolution in 1DE, with fewer resolved bands compared to DTT supplemented with TBP. Previous reports have claimed the poor resolution and inconsistent spot patterns in the basic region of 2DE proteome maps are a result of incomplete reduction and inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds reforming near the cathode during IEF. The reduction mechanism of 2-ME gave rise to the idea that the oxidation of thiol groups to mixed disulfides may prevent reoxidation, and thus, HED was adopted based on claimed remarkable improvements in resolution, notably decreased \u2018streaking\u2019 and tailed spots [37,46\u201350]. The results here differ markedly from those earlier reports in that proteome extracts treated with DTT + TBP yielded significantly higher spot counts and better overall spot quality (i.e., less streaked, tailed spots). The likely explanation for such striking differences is that the earlier reports compared high HED concentrations (i.e., 100 mM) to completely inadequate concentrations of DTT (i.e., below excess or an established effective concentration, thus resulting in an incomplete reduction of disulfides) [37,48,50]. Certainly, a careful review of the original report of reduced streaking using HED reveals gel images (apparently single replicates) that were only evaluated qualitatively [37]. The data here (Figures 6\u20138) indicate that even the lowest concentration of DTT is largely superior in terms of ensuring the reduction of native proteome extracts and does not support the notion that reduction with HED results in the lower occurrence of streaking in the basic region; indeed, if anything, the qualitative assessment suggests slightly increased streaking in the mid pI range when HED is used. The unsatisfactory results with HED may be attributed to the reduction mechanism relative to that of DTT. The reduction of disulfide bridges by DTT produces a thermodynamically favoured six-membered ring that drives the equilibrium towards the reduced state [26,28] and, thus, may be more efficient at reducing disulfide bridges in proteoforms and ensuring complete reduction compared to HED. Previous reports have demonstrated intact disulfide bonds result in a more compact conformation of a proteoform, resulting in changes to electrophoretic mobility and SDS-binding [66]. The binding of SDS during the equilibration step in 2DE aids in proteoform solubilization and facilitates the transfer of proteoforms from the IPG strip into the SDS-resolving gel in the second dimension, thus providing a likely explanation for the much lower total signal and spot counts detected in proteome extracts reduced with HED compared to DTT.\nProteomes 2023, 11, 10 14 of 17\nOne potential limitation in our study is the selection of bands for the assessment of resolution in 1DE. Although reasonable attempts were made for a complete, thorough assessment, qualitative (i.e., visually apparent) improvements in resolution guided band selection for subsequent quantitative analysis. However, this method of selection may be limited in assessing changes in band intensity or FWHM. Nonetheless, as with our previous work to improve integrative top\u2013down proteomic analyses, testing a range of conditions first using 1DE enabled efficient and effective narrowing down of conditions to finally be vetted by 2DE. This represents a significant saving of time and resources. Secondly, this study focused primarily on the reduction of proteomes during the rehydration and equilibration steps of 2DE. It might also prove useful to test these reagents in the solubilization buffer used for proteome extraction to assess potential improvements in proteoform solubilization, resolution, and, thus, depth of proteome analyses. While comparable systematic analyses of alkylating agents might also be suggested, excellent work indicates that the excess acrylamide used here is quite likely the best available treatment [67,68]. To address the full complexity of proteomes, that is, routinely analyzing the constituent proteoforms beyond simply cataloguing canonical amino acid sequences, we must implement deep, quantitative analyses having the necessary analytical power and rigour [1\u20133,5]. Currently, this is best (and routinely) implemented using integrative top\u2013down proteomic analyses that fully utilize the complementary strengths of 2DE and LC/TMS [1,2,4\u201311,18,19,22,69]. In contrast to bottom\u2013up analyses, which infer the identity of only canonical protein sequences or mass-spectrometry-intensive top\u2013down approaches that, while sensitive and thorough, can generally only handle species of <20\u201330 kDA, integrative top\u2013down analyses using 2DE as the front-end of resolution enable deep proteomic analyses at the necessary level of proteoforms. The data presented in this study, along with decades of significant refinements and improvements, enable a genuine understanding of the complexity and diversity of the proteome by increasing analytical rigor [2,4,6\u201310,18]."

We acknowledge there is not a \u2018perfect\u2019 one-size-fits-all method; however, the goal here was to establish an optimized general protocol to enhance 2DE resolution and, thus, routine integrative top\u2013down proteomic analyses. Further optimization of these conditions is encouraged for the analysis of different native proteomes, and the \u2018optimized\u2019 reduction protocol established here is strongly suggested as a critical starting point to ensure the deepest possible quantitative proteome analyses, regardless of the analytical techniques employed. As with our previous work, we encourage further testing, refinement, and optimization even of \u2018established\u2019 protocols, again, regardless of the analytical techniques employed. Only such rigorous and routine assessments will ensure the truest possible proteome analyses as required to identify critical changes to proteoforms.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/proteomes11010010/s1; Figure S1: Representative chromatogram via lane profile of total green lentil proteome extracts with 100 mM DTT; Figure S2: Representative analysis of total lane signal to confirm equivalent total protein loads per lane; Figure S3: 1DE Gel Images; Figure S4: Chicken egg lysozyme reduced with 12.5\u2013200 mM DTT; Figure S5: BSA reduced with 100\u2013160 mM DTT; Figure S6: Proteome extracts reduced with 100\u2013160 mM DTT; Figure S7: Gel images of resolved mouse brain proteome extracts; Figure S8: Gel images of resolved mouse brain proteome extracts; Figure S9: Gel images of resolved green lentil proteome extracts.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.R.C.; methodology, B.W. and J.R.C.; validation, B.W. and J.R.C.; formal analysis, B.W.; investigation, B.W.; resources, J.R.C. and A.N.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, B.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, B.W., A.N. and J.R.C.; visualization, B.W.; supervision, A.N. and J.R.C.; project administration, J.R.C.; funding acquisition, J.R.C.
