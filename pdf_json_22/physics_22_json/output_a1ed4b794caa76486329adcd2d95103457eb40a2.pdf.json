            "text": "Spinless Mirror Chern Insulator from Projective Symmetry Algebra\nL. B. Shao,1, 2 Z. Y. Chen,1 Kai Wang,1 Shengyuan A. Yang,3 and Y. X. Zhao1, 2, \u2217\n1National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures and Department of Physics, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China 2Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China 3Research Laboratory for Quantum Materials, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore 487372, Singapore\nIt was commonly believed that a mirror Chern insulator (MCI) must require spin-orbital coupling, since time-reversal symmetry for spinless systems contradicts with the mirror Chern number. So MCI cannot be realized in spinless systems which include the large field of topological artificial crystals. Here, we disprove this common belief. The first point to clarify is that the fundamental constraint is not from spin-orbital coupling but the symmetry algebra of time reversal and mirror operations. Then, our theory is based on the conceptual transformation that the symmetry algebras will be projectively modified under gauge fields. Particularly, we show that the symmetry algebra of mirror reflection and time-reversal required for MCI can be achieved projectively in spinless systems with lattice Z2 gauge fields, i.e., by allowing real hopping amplitudes to take \u00b1 signs. Moreover, we propose the basic structure, the twisted \u03c0-flux blocks, to fulfill the projective symmetry algebra, and develop a general approach to construct spinless MCIs based on these building blocks. Two concrete spinless MCI models are presented, which can be readily realized in artificial systems such as acoustic crystals.\nIntroduction. The field of topological matter started with the discovery of the quantum Hall effect or the Chern insulator (CI) [1\u20133]. A Chern insulator requires the breaking of time reversal (T ) symmetry, which poses difficulty for its realization. For example, a strong magnetic field is needed for the quantum Hall effect [1]; and for the renowned Haldane model [3], its delicate flux configuration is not easy to achieve in practical systems [4]. Later, a significant breakthrough is the discovery of symmetry-protected topological insulators without breaking T . The prominent ones include the T -invariant topological insulator [5, 6] and the mirror Chern insulator (MCI) [7\u20139]. The T -invariant topological insulator has found realization in many materials, which led to the boom of the entire field in the past fifteen years [10\u201313]. Meanwhile, MCI initiated the field of crystalline topological states, which is still actively explored today [14\u201317].\nThere is a common wisdom regarding MCI: With T invariance, MCI must require spin-orbit coupling (SOC) [7, 18, 19]. Hence, MCI can only be realized in spinful systems, but not spinless systems. In other words, T -invariant spinless MCI does not exist. Because of this, while MCI has been realized in electronic systems of several materials [8, 9, 19], it was believed to be forbidden for artificial systems, such as acoustic/photonic crystals, electric-circuit arrays, and mechanical network systems, as these systems are intrinsically spinless. Qualitatively different from the symmetry-protected topological manybody wavefunctions, the artificial crystals can effectively simulate the topological band structures of one Bloch particle by their high tunability. However, despite the rapid growth of topological artificial crystals into a huge and active field in recent years [20\u201330], MCI has never been achieved in such systems so far.\nIn this Letter, we overturn this common wisdom. We show that spinless MCI does exist, and it can readily re-\nalized in artificial systems such as acoustic crystals. This discovery is made possible by advances in two aspects. First, we scrutinize the fundamental requirement for a MCI and clarify that the key factor is not SOC but the symmetry algebra. Explicitly, the only necessary condition is that the mirror operatorMmust satisfyM2 = \u22121 for MCI, provided that it commutes with T . Second, for spatial symmetries such as M, the algebra can be controlled by implementing lattice gauge field. Particularly, we show that spinless MCI can be achieved by the simple Z2 gauge field, meaning that the hopping amplitudes are allowed to take \u00b1 signs, which is something that can be readily engineered in artificial crystals [25, 31\u201336]. Under gauge fields, symmetries would satisfy so-called projective algebra, which can be designed to meet the requirement of MCI. The notion of projective symmetry algebra was applied to physics initially in the study of quantum spin liquids [37]. Its profound implications for topological states were only revealed very recently [38\u201340], and some predictions have already been successfully verified in experiments with acoustic crystals [35, 36]. Here, we find that distinct from the previous cases, MCIs need an essentially different mechanism and lattice design. We propose a general prescription to construct MCIs based on a twisted \u03c0-flux block. We show that for any CI model, we can generate an associated spinless MCI using the twisted blocks. We explicitly demonstrate our method via two famous CI models, namely the triangular-lattice model and the Hofstadter model. Our proposed MCI designs can be easily realized in artificial crystals.\nSymmetry algebras of MCI. Let us start by analyzing the symmetry algebra required for MCI. There are 2D and 3D MCIs. For a 2D MCI, the mirror symmetry is with respect to the 2D plane of the system. For a 3D MCI, the mirror Chern number is defined on a 2D subsystem, i.e., some mirror-invariant plane, in the Brillouin\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n05 65\n4v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .o\nth er\n] 1\n2 Ju\nl 2 02\n2\n2 zone. Hence, without loss of generality, we focus on 2D MCIs for clarity.\nWe find that the fundamental symmetry condition for a MCI is the following algebra [41]:\n[T ,M] = 0, M2 = \u22121. (1)\nTo understand this, we first note that with the M symmetry, states of the system can be separated into the mirror-even and mirror-odd subspaces. Particularly, the momentum-space Hamiltonian H(k) can be put into the block diagonal form\nH(k) = [ h+(k) 0\n0 h\u2212(k)\n] , (2)\nin accord with the two eigenspaces of M. If the algebra (1) holds, M has eigenvalues of \u00b1i. For eigenstates |\u03c8\u00b1\u3009 withM|\u03c8\u00b1\u3009 = \u00b1i|\u03c8\u00b1\u3009, we observe thatMT |\u03c8\u00b1\u3009 = TM|\u03c8\u00b1\u3009 = T (\u00b1i|\u03c8\u00b1\u3009) = \u2213iT |\u03c8\u00b1\u3009, since T is an antiunitary operator involving complex conjugation. This just means that T exchanges the two eigenspaces. Hence, we must have uh\u2217+(\u2212k)u\u2020 = h\u2212(k) for some unitary matrix u determined by T , i.e., T transforms h\u00b1(k) into h\u2213(k). Assuming that H(k) is gapped, we can calculate Chern numbers C\u00b1 for h\u00b1(k), respectively. Since T inverses the Chern number, h+(k) and h\u2212(k) must have opposite Chern numbers: C+ = \u2212C\u2212. Thus, although the total Chern number C = C+ + C\u2212 = 0, each block h\u00b1 can have a nontrivial Chern number, and accordingly C+ is defined as the mirror Chern number [7].\nFrom the above reasoning, we see that the essence for a nontrivial mirror Chern number is: T must exchange the eigenspaces ofM. For electronic systems with SOC, T = i\u03c32K\u0302I\u0302 and M = i\u03c33 in the spin space of each electron, where \u03c3\u2019s are the Pauli matrices. Hence, the algebra in (1) is naturally satisfied. In comparison, if M2 = +1 and [T ,M] = 0, as for typical spinless systems, then T would preserve the eigenspaces of M. This is because the eigenvalues \u00b11 ofM are real numbers that commutes with T . Although we still can write H(k) into the block diagonal form (2) for eigenspaces of \u00b11, both h\u00b1(k) are invariant under T , and therefore they each must have a zero Chern number, i.e., C\u00b1 = 0.\nWe have some remarks before proceeding. First, contrary to common perceptions, the relation T 2 = \u00b11 is not essential for MCI, since T inverses the Chern number in both cases. Second, it is clear from the analysis that the key factor here is not SOC but the symmetry algebra, particularly, whether M2 equals +1 or \u22121. Projective symmetry algebra. Although it seems from experience that spinless systems always have M2 = +1, we show that with certain Z2 gauge fields the condition in (1) can be realized as projective symmetry algebra in spinless systems.\nLet us start with some general considerations on a mirror symmetric system with a given Z2 gauge configuration. The field is described by a chosen configuration of\nM G\n+ +\n\u2212 \u2212\n(a)\n(b)\nM G\u2032 + \u2212\n\u2212+\nJI -JI\nJR\nJR\n(c)\ntwist\n\u03c0-flux\nFIG. 1. Two four-site tight-binding models. Red and blue lines denote negative and positive hopping amplitudes, respectively. The dashed horizontal lines in (a) and (b) are the reference lines for the spatial mirror refection M . The signs on the middle figures specify the gauge transformations G and G\u2032 for (a) and (b), respectively. The tight-binding models are invariant under M followed by G or G\u2032. (c) The model in (a) is a twist of a rectangle with flux \u03c0. The \u03c0 flux is depicted by a thin gray tube.\ngauge connections, i.e., signs \u00b11 of real hopping amplitudes. The gauge-connection configuration in general is not invariant under the spatial mirror reflection M , but will be changed to another equivalent configuration (another gauge choice), which is related to the original one by a Z2 gauge transformation G. G is specified by assigning a sign of +1 or \u22121 to the basis at each site. Then, the physical mirror operator will be represented as the combination\nM = GM, (3)\nnamely the spatial reflection M followed by the gauge transformation G. Since both M and G in real space are real matrices, [M, T ] = 0 in (1) is trivially satisfied. Moreover, since M2 = G2 = 1, to satisfy M2 = \u22121 in (1), we need the anti-commutation relation between G and M ,\n{G,M} = 0. (4)\nThe anti-commutativity is equivalent to MGM\u22121 = \u2212G, which just means that M inverses all signs at all sites for G. This observation is a guiding principle for the model construction.\nLet us consider a simple system consisting of only four sites, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Positive and negative hopping amplitudes are marked with blue and red colors,\n3 respectively. For the model in Fig. 1(a), the Hamiltonian is given by\nH = JR\u03c40 \u2297 \u03c31 + JI\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c32, (5)\nwhere \u03c4 \u2019s and \u03c3\u2019s be two sets of Pauli matrices which respectively operate on the row and column indices of the block. The mirror reflection M = \u03c41 \u2297 \u03c30 through the dashed horizontal line exchanges diagonal and antidiagonal hopping processes, and therefore the gauge connections are changed. To restore the original gauge connections, the gauge transformation G = \u03c43\u2297\u03c30 needed is specified in the middle figure of Fig. 1(a). Obviously, M inverses G with {M,G} = 0. Hence, Eq. (4) is satisfied, and the resulting projective symmetry algebra will be (1) needed for the MCI, where\nM = GM = i\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c30. (6)\nOn the other hand, the setup, H(b) = J1\u03c41\u2297 \u03c30 + J2\u03c43\u2297 \u03c31, in Fig. 1(b) does not work. In the middle figure of Fig. 1(b), the gauge transformation G\u2032 = \u03c40 \u2297 \u03c33 is invariant under M , and therefore [G\u2032,M ] = 0 rather than {G\u2032,M} = 0, and we have M\u20322 = +1 with M\u2032 = \u03c41 \u2297 \u03c33 in this case.\nThe arrangement in Fig. 1(a) is referred to as a twisted \u03c0-flux block, because, as shown in Fig.1(c), it is a twist of a \u03c0-flux rectangle with H(c) = \u2212J1\u03c41\u2297\u03c33 +J2\u03c40\u2297\u03c31. It is clear that both the \u03c0-flux and the twist are essential for achieving the symmetry algebra (1). In fact, there are eight possible Z2 gauge-connection configurations on this twisted \u03c0-flux block [see Fig. 2(b) and (c)], which are equivalent to each other through some Z2 gauge transformations, and therefore all can realize the projective algebra (1).\nGeneral method for constructing spinless MCI. We develop a general method for constructing spinless MCIs. Our construction is based on the twisted \u03c0-flux block. Since the blocks in Fig. 2(b) and 2(c) are gauge equivalent, it is sufficient to look into one of them. Consider the one in Fig. 1(a) with the Hamiltonian (5) and mirror operator (6).\nIt is enlightening to view the model in the eigenspaces of M, which can be achieved by performing the unitary transformation U = exp(\u2212i\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c30\u03c0/4). Under the transformation, M \u2192 UMU\u2020 = i\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c30. Now, \u03c43 corresponds to the index of the two eigenspaces of M with eigenvalues \u00b1i, and the Hamiltonian is transformed into the block diagonal form,\nUHU\u2020 = [ JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32 0\n0 JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32 ] \u03c4 . (7)\nMeanwhile, T is transformed to be UT U\u2020 = \u2212i\u03c41K\u0302, which, as expected, exchanges the two diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian, i.e., the two eigenspaces of M. We refer to the two diagonal blocks as eigenvalue layers.\nU\nU \u2020\nJI -JI\nJR\nJR Je i\u03a6\nJe -i\u03a6\n(a)\n(b)\nJR\n-JR\nJI JI\nJR\nJR\n-JI JI\nJR\n-JR JI JI\nJR\nJR\n-JIJI\nJR\n-JR -JI -JI\n-JR\n-JR JI -JI\n-JR\nJR -JI -JI\n-JR\n-JR -JI JI\n(c)\nFIG. 2. (a) The equivalence mapping between the twisted \u03c0-flux block and two complex hopping amplitudes. U is the unitary transformation diagonalizing M. (b) Four twisted \u03c0-flux blocks with M = i\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c30. (c) The other four with M = i\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c33.\nThen, JR\u03c31\u00b1 JI\u03c32 can be interpreted as hopping amplitudes Je\u00b1i\u03c6 between two lattice sites in each eigenvalue layer, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The hopping phase and strength are explicitly given by\nei\u03c6 = (JR + iJI)/J, J = \u221a J2R + J 2 I . (8)\nIt is important that starting from a spinless model with purely real hopping amplitudes, we are able to convert it to a system with complex hopping amplitudes. Conversely, for any prescribed complex hopping amplitude, we can construct a spinless twisted \u03c0-flux block such that one of its eigenvalue layer realizes the amplitude. Note that the hopping phase is a key ingredient for CI models. For instance, the Haldane model is characterized by the second neighbor hopping phase \u03c6 on a honeycomb lattice [3, 42, 43]. For the Hofstadter model, each square plaquette has a flux \u03c6 [44, 45].\nBased on this understanding, we have the following general method to construct spinless MCIs from any CI model. Given such a CI model HC(\u03c6) with a characteristic phase ei\u03c6, we can construct a spinless MCI HMC(\u03c6) protected by M and T by the invertible mapping illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Specifically, we take HC(\u03c6) and HC(\u2212\u03c6) as two independent layers. Then, we perform the mapping in Fig. 2(a) inversely, i.e., replace each pair of complex hopping amplitudes with phases \u00b1\u03c6 on the two layers by a twisted \u03c0-flux block. The resultant bilayer tight-binding model is just the wanted spinless MCI. For this system, the mirror operator isM = i\u03c42 with \u03c4 \u2019s operating on the layer degrees of freedom, and T = K\u0302.\nThe corresponding mapping for the momentum-\n4 0 2\n-2\nE n e rg y\n0 \u03c0/2-\u03c0/2 k\nt-\u03b4\n\ud835\udc521 \ud835\udc522 \ud835\udc523-t Jei\u03a6 t\nt+\u03b4\nJR\nJI\n-JI\n(b)(a)\nJR\nJR\nJI\n-JI JR\nJI\n-JI\nJRJR\nt-\u03b4 t+\u03b4 t-\u03b4\n(c)\nFIG. 3.

(b) The corresponding MCI model. Complex hopping amplitudes in (a) are replaced by twisted \u03c0-flux blocks. (c) The spectrum of the bilayer model with edges along e2. The parameter values are chosen as t = 1, \u03b4 = 0.5, JR = J cos\u03c6, JI = J sin\u03c6 with J = 2 and \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/5 [46].\nspace Hamiltonians can be immediately constructed. Let hC(k, \u03c6) be the momentum-space Hamiltonian for HC(\u03c6). Then, we introduce\nh\u00b1(k, \u03c6) = 1\n2 [hC(k, \u03c6)\u00b1 hC(k,\u2212\u03c6)]. (9)\nh+(k, \u03c6) [h\u2212(k, \u03c6)] is an even (odd) function of \u03c6. Since hC(k, \u03c6) and hC(k,\u2212\u03c6) are related by T symmetry, h+(k, \u03c6) [h\u2212(k, \u03c6)] are also even (odd) under T operation. Then, the T -invariant Hamiltonian HMC(k, \u03c6) for the bilayer MCI is given by\nHMC(k) = [ h+(k, \u03c6) \u2212ih\u2212(k, \u03c6) ih\u2212(k, \u03c6) h+(k, \u03c6) ] \u03c4 . (10)\nFinally, we should substitute \u03c6 by JR and JI according to Eq. (8). Here, M = i\u03c42, and T = K\u0302I\u0302 with I\u0302 the inversion of momenta.\nIn the above discussion, we have chosen the particular twisted \u03c0-flux block in Fig. 1(a) to demonstrate our idea. Other blocks in Fig. 2(b) and 2(c) can also be used. It is not difficult to see that these eight blocks can be put into two groups, with members in a group sharing the same representation of M: For those in Fig. 2(b), M = i\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c30; whereas for Fig. 2(c), M = i\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c33 [47]. It should be noted that if one uses more than one kind of blocks in a single model, then these blocks should be chosen from only one of the two groups to maintain the same representation for M.\nNevertheless, we emphasize that generically chiral edge states of the two mirror layers in Fig.2(a) will be simultaneously excited in real space, since mirror reflection relates two real-space layers. Concrete models. We demonstrate our theory by con-\nstructing two concrete spinless MCIs from well-know CI models.\nThe first one is based on the triangular-lattice CI model illustrated in Fig. 3(a). Let us denote the three\nt\nJ 2\u03c0\n5\n(b)(a) Je2i\u03c0/5 Je4i\u03c0/5 Je 6i\u03c0/5 Je8i\u03c0/5\nJR 1\nJR 1\n-JR 2\nJR 4\nJR 4 -JR 2 -JR 3\n-JR 3\nJ\nJ\n0\n0\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c0\n-2\nky\nE n e rg y\n(c) -JI 1\nJI 1 JI 2 -JI 3 -JI 4\nJI 3 -JI 2\nJI 4\nFIG. 4. (a) The Hofstadter model. The flux \u03c6 is 2\u03c0/5. Green, red and blue bonds denote complex, negative and positive hopping amplitudes, respectively. (b) The corresponding Hofstadter MCI model. The green bonds are replaced by the four twisted \u03c0-flux blocks in Fig.2(b). (c) The spectrum of the MCI model with edges along the y direction. The parameter values are chosen as t = J = 1, and accordingly JnR = J | cos 2n\u03c0/5| and JnI = J | sin 2n\u03c0/5| with n = 1, 2, 3, 4 [46].\nbond vectors as ea with a = 1, 2, 3. The hopping amplitudes along e1 are Je\ni\u03c6, and the phase ei\u03c6 characterizes the model. The other hopping amplitudes are real, and those along the e3 bonds change signs alternatively in the e2 direction. The hopping amplitudes along e3 is t, and the hoppings along e2 have a dimerized pattern with amplitudes t\u00b1 \u03b4. If J > t and \u03b4 6= 0, the model can realize a CI by tuning \u03c6, and the Chern number C = \u00b11 [47]. The corresponding spinless MCI model is illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Following our general method, it is a bilayer model with each original bond with phase \u03c6 replaced by a twisted \u03c0-flux block, and the Hamiltonian is in the form of (10) [47]. The spectrum with the open boundary conditions for an edge along e2 is shown in Fig. 3(c). We see a pair of left-handed and right-handed topological edge bands, which correspond to the unit mirror Chern number.\nThe second example is based on the renowned Hofstadter CI model [44, 45]. It is just a square-lattice model with flux \u03c6 per square plaquette. Here, we choose \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/5. The unit cells for the Hofstadter model and the corresponding MCI model are illustrated in Fig. 4(a) and (b). We choose to connect the two layers of the MCI by using the four different twisted \u03c0-flux blocks in Fig. 2(b), so that the required flux in each eigenspace layer of M can be realized [47]. The model has four energy gaps separating energy bands into five groups. Ordered by energy, the mirror Chern numbers for these five groups of bands are found as \u22121, \u22121, 4, \u22121 and \u22121 [47]. The topological chiral edge bands emerge accordingly, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Particularly, for the middle two gaps, each hosts two left-handed and two right-handed chiral bands, since the sums of mirror Chern numbers below them are \u00b12, respectively.\nDiscussion. We have disproved the common belief that MCI must require SOC and hence can only be realized in\n5 spinful systems. Essentially, we have clarified the most fundamental symmetry requirement for MCIs and how Z2 gauge fields can projectively modify the symmetry algebra to achieve the requirement in spinless systems. Although we have focused on 2D spinless MCIs, the discussion can be directly extended to 3D spinless MCI models.\nOur work greatly broadens the experimental relevance of MCIs. Our proposed spinless MCI models can be readily realized in acoustic crystals with engineerable Z2 gauge fields [32\u201336]. Particularly, an acoustic realization of the twisted \u03c0-flux blocks is given in detail in the SM [47]. Other artificial crystals, such as cold atoms in optical lattices [48, 49] and electric-circuit arrays [26, 27], may also be possible platforms for realizing our proposals.\n\u2217 zhaoyx@nju.edu.cn [1] K. v.

In this section, we derive basic results and supply technical details for the eight twisted \u03c0-flux blocks. They are divided into two four-block groups, each with a projective mirror operator. The following materials in this section is organized in accord with the two-group division. For convenience, we quote Fig. 2 of the main text here as Fig. S1.\nThe four twisted \u03c0-flux blocks in Fig. S1(b) is invariant under M1 = G1M , where\nG1 = \u03c43 \u2297 \u03c30, M = \u03c41 \u2297 \u03c30. (S1)\nObviously, they satisfy the anti-commutation relation {G1,M} = 0, and\nM1 = i\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c30. (S2)\nThe operation of the mirror symmetry M1 in this case is illustrated by Fig. 1(a) in the main text. By the unitary transformation U = e\u2212i\u03c0\u03c41\u2297\u03c30/4 as given in the main text,M1 can be diagonalized as UM1U\u2020 = i\u03c43\u2297\u03c30. Fig. S1(a) is just the second block of Fig. S1(b), and its Hamiltonian is written as\nH = JR\u03c40 \u2297 \u03c31 + JI\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c32. (S3)\nBy the unitary transformation U , the Hamiltonian can be transformed as UHU\u2020 = [ JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32\nJR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32\n] . (S4)\nHence, the Hamiltonian UHU\u2020 contains two blocks, which can be represented as the right panel of Fig. S1(a). We give the detail mapping of the four Hamiltonians for Fig. S1(b) in the following:\nH = JR\u03c40 \u2297 \u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c32 \u21d2 UHU\u2020 = (JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32)\u2295 (JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32) , H = JR\u03c40 \u2297 \u03c31 + JI\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c32 \u21d2 UHU\u2020 = (JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32)\u2295 (JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32) , H = \u2212JR\u03c40 \u2297 \u03c31 + JI\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c32 \u21d2 UHU\u2020 = (\u2212JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32)\u2295 (\u2212JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32) , H = \u2212JR\u03c40 \u2297 \u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c32 \u21d2 UHU\u2020 = (\u2212JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32)\u2295 (\u2212JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32) .\n(S5)\nFrom the above mapping of the Hamiltonians, the first blocks of each UHU\u2020 represent the systems of two sites with the hopping amplitudes as Je\u2212i\u03c6, Jei\u03c6, Jei(\u03c0\u2212\u03c6), and Jei(\u03c0+\u03c6), respectively. Here, we have taken JR = J cos\u03c6 and JI = J sin\u03c6.\nThe four twisted \u03c0-flux blocks in Fig. S1(c) are invariant under M2 = G2M with\nG2 = \u03c43 \u2297 \u03c33, M = \u03c41 \u2297 \u03c30. (S6)\nThen, we have\nM2 = i\u03c42 \u2297 \u03c33, (S7)\nby which the algebra [T ,M2] = 0, M22 = \u22121 of Eq. (1) in the main text is also satisfied. The operation of mirror symmetry M2 is illustrated in Fig. S2, which takes the second block of Fig. S1(c) as an example. Here, time reversal symmetry is represented as T = K with K the complex conjugation. For the second block of Fig. S1(c), the Hamiltonian can be written as\nH = JR\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c31 + JI\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c31.

The operation of M2 = G2M .\nObviously, it satisfies [M2,H] = 0. By the unitary transformation U = e\u2212i\u03c0\u03c41\u2297\u03c33/4, M2 can be diagonalized as UM2U\u2020 = i\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c30. Similarly, the Hamiltonian is transformed into diagonal block as\nUHU\u2020 = (JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32)\u2295 (\u2212JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32) . (S9)\nNote that time reversal symmetry is now represented in the eigenspace of M as\nUT U\u2020 = \u2212i\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c33K. (S10)\nThen, for the four twisted \u03c0-flux blocks in Fig. S1(c), the Hamiltonians are transformed as\nH = \u2212JR\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c31 + JI\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c31 \u21d2 UHU\u2020 = (\u2212JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32)\u2295 (JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32) , H = JR\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c31 + JI\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c31 \u21d2 UHU\u2020 = (JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32)\u2295 (\u2212JR\u03c31 + JI\u03c32) , H = JR\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c31 \u21d2 UHU\u2020 = (JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32)\u2295 (\u2212JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32) , H = \u2212JR\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c31 \u21d2 UHU\u2020 = (\u2212JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32)\u2295 (JR\u03c31 \u2212 JI\u03c32) .\n(S11)\n8 t-\u03b4 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc52 -t Jei\u03a6 t t+\u03b4 (b)(a)\n\u03b40\nnM=1 nM=-1\n(d)\n-JI -JI JIJI JRJR\nk\n0\n2\n-2\nk\n(e)\nEn er gy\n0 \u03c0/2-\u03c0/2\n0\n2\n-2\n(f)\nEn er gy\n0 \u03c0/2-\u03c0/2\nJ sin\u03a6\nt\nP\n0\nnontrivial\ntrivial\n(c)\nFIG.

The parameters in calculating (c) and (d) are set as t = 1, \u03b4 = 0.5, \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/5, and J = 2.\nThe first blocks of above resulting Hamiltonians UHU\u2020 are the system of two sites with the hopping amplitudes as Jei(\u03c0\u2212\u03c6), Jei\u03c6, Je\u2212i\u03c6, and Jei(\u03c0+\u03c6), respectively.\nTHE CHERN-INSULATOR AND MIRROR-CHERN-INSULATOR TRIANGLE MODELS\nIn this section, we provide detailed information for the triangle-lattice Chern insulator and the corresponding mirror Chern insulator.\nThe monolayer triangle-lattice model is illustrated in Fig. S3(a). The three edges of each triangle are ei with i = 1, 2, 3. The hopping coefficient along each e1 is Je\ni\u03c6. The dimerization along e2 is introduced with hopping amplitudes as t \u2212 \u03b4 and t + \u03b4. Hence, the unit cell consists of two sites as shown by the shadow area in Fig. S3(a), and the unit vectors can now be chosen as 2e2, e3. The hopping amplitude along e3 is \u00b1t, where the signs \u00b1 are marked by blue and red lines, respectively. Hence, the Hamiltonian of the monolayer triangular lattice is given as\nhC(k, \u03c6) = [2J cos(k \u00b7 e1 \u2212 \u03c6) + 2t cosk \u00b7 e2]\u03c31 + 2\u03b4 sink \u00b7 e2\u03c32 \u2212 2t cosk \u00b7 e3\u03c33. (S12)\nThe gap of energy spectrum is closed if\nt = J | sin\u03c6|, or \u03b4 = 0. (S13)\nFor \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0 and \u03b4 6= 0, the monolayer system has time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and the Chern number is zero. When varying \u03c6, the Chern number remains zero until the gap closes at t = J | sin\u03c6|. Thus, the Chern number is nonzero as t < J | sin\u03c6|. The phase diagram is shown in Fig. S3(c). When t < J | sin\u03c6|, the gap closing condition \u03b4 = 0 separates two nontrivial phases with different Chern numbers as indicated in Fig. S3(d). The energy spectra in Fig. S3(e) and (f) are calculated for the open boundary conditions along e1 and e2, respectively. They demonstrate the topologically nontrivial phase with chiral edge state.\nBy our general construction of the bilayer model in the main text, the hopping amplitudes of inserted twisted \u03c0-phase blocks are related to the complex hopping amplitude Jei\u03c6 as\nJR + iJI = Je i\u03c6.

(c) The mirror Hofstadter model. All hopping amplitudes are real, and positive and negative ones are marked in blue and red, respectively.\nThen, the Hamiltonian of this bilayer system can be directly obtained from Eqs. (9) and (10) of the main text as Htr(k) = [ htr+(k) \u2212ihtr\u2212(k) ihtr\u2212(k) h tr +(k) ] , (S15)\nwhere\nhtr+(k) = (2JR cosk \u00b7 e1 + 2t cosk \u00b7 e2)\u03c31 + 2\u03b4 sink \u00b7 e2\u03c32 \u2212 2t cosk \u00b7 e3\u03c33, htr\u2212(k) = 2JI sink \u00b7 e1\u03c31.\n(S16)\nFrom the relation in Eq. (S14) and the phase diagram of monolayer system in Figs. S3(c) and S3(d), it is now clear that the phases of bilayer system is irrelevant to JR in Fig. S3(b). When, t < |JI | and \u03b4 6= 0, the mirror Chern number is nonzero, and the model is a mirror Chern insulator.\nTHE HOFSTADTER AND MIRROR HOFSTADTER MODELS\nIn this section, we provide detailed information for the Hofstadter model and the corresponding mirror Hofstadter model.\nThe Hofstadter model with gauge flux \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/5 through each plaquitte is illustrated in Fig. S4(a). The horizontal hopping amplitude is t, and the vertical one is J . Then, the Hamiltonian is written as\nhHofC =  2J cos ky t 0 0 te \u2212ikx\nt 2J cos(ky \u2212 \u03c6) t 0 0 0 t 2J cos(ky \u2212 2\u03c6) t 0 0 0 t 2J cos(ky \u2212 3\u03c6) t tikx 0 0 t 2J cos(ky \u2212 4\u03c6)  . (S17) For this system, the Chern numbers of five bands are obtained as\n\u2212 1,\u22121, 4,\u22121,\u22121, (S18)\nordered from higher to lower energies, respectively. As shown in Fig. S4(b), there are four energy gaps with the numbers of chiral edge states as 1, 2, 2, 1 inside them, respectively.\nBy our general method, the Hamiltonian for the mirror Hofstadter model can be written as\nHHof(k) = \u03c40 \u2297 hHof+ (k) + \u03c42 \u2297 hHof\u2212 (k) (S19)\n10\n(J1R, J 1 I ) (J 2 R, J 2 I ) (J 3 R, J 3 I ) (J 4 R, J 4 I )\n(J cos 2\u03c0 5 , J sin 2\u03c0 5 ) (J cos \u03c0 5 , J sin \u03c0 5 ) (J cos \u03c0 5 , J sin \u03c0 5 ) (J cos 2\u03c0 5 , J sin 2\u03c0 5 )\nwhere the hopping amplitudes (JnR, J n I ) with n = 1, 2, 3, 4 of twisted \u03c0-flux blocks are given in Tab. I. The bilayer mirror Hofstadter model is illustrated in Fig. S4(c), where the four twisted \u03c0-flux blocks in Fig.S1(b) are inserted in each unit cell.\n11\nJR\nJR -JI JI\nJR\nJR -JI JI\nJR\nJR -JI JI\nJR\nJR -JI JI\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFIG.

The advantage of using artificial systems rests on the controllable hopping or coupling terms. For example, if there is no coupling between two fixed sites, just remove all the connecting materials between these two sites. For traditional electronic systems, this could be achieved by properly designing the local states with some sorts of symmetries such that the energy integral vanishes. To simulate electronic system by acoustic system, the eigen oscillation mimics the electronic wave function in solid systems. In this way, the equation of motion for electrons is simulated by the dynamic equation of the oscillation in acoustic system with the frequency playing the role of energy. To be precise, lattice sites in solid systems are replaced by acoustic resonators, while hopping between different sites is realized by coupling between different resonators. By connecting the acoustic resonators with wave guides or coupling tubes, the coupling amplitude can be easily controlled since it is completely determined by the radius of wave guide or coupling tube.\nTo control the sign of the coupling between different resonators, the dipolar mode far away from other modes of the resonator is chosen, which resembles the atomic p-orbital as shown in Fig. S5. So, let\u2019s begin with the coupling between two remote pz orbitals in solid system as shown in Fig. S5(a) and S5(b). Assuming the coupling coefficient is t and the onsite energy is \u03b50, the Hamiltonian of this small system can be written as\nH =\n[ \u03b50 t\nt \u03b50\n] (S20)\nwith two eigenstates\n|\u00b1\u3009 = 1\u221a 2\n[ 1\n\u00b11\n] (S21)\nfor E\u00b1 = \u03b50\u00b1 t, respectively. If t < 0, the low-energy state is bonding state while the high-energy one is anti-bonding state as shown by Fig. S5(a). The case for t > 0 is just opposite as shown in Fig. S5(b). As to the acoustic resonator, the dipolar mode manifests the sinusoidal distribution of air pressure inside the resonator, which just mimics the wave function of pz orbital. For hopping simulated by coupling different resonators with wave guides, there is a physical picture here. The wave guides introduce the perturbation to eigen modes of the resonators. In acoustic systems, the uniform distribution of air pressure always has lower frequency or lower energy than the sinusoidal distribution. Therefore, by considering the perturbation from the wave guides in Fig. S5(c), the bonding state has lower frequency than the anti-bonding one. From the lesson of Fig. S5(a) that the coupling coefficient is negative if the bonding state has lower energy, we obtain the effective coupling t < 0. Namely, there is a \u03c0 hopping phase for the connection structure of Fig. S5(c). The case of Fig. S5(d) is just opposite to that of Fig. S5(c). In this way, the Z2 gauge field can be readily realized in acoustic systems by properly designing the connection structures.\n12\nThe above strategy of controlling the coupling between acoustic resonators, as a proven technology, has been widely used in topological acoustic systems. We now turn to the realization of our models. It is clear that once the building blocks in Fig. S1 are simulated, our models are immediately realized. We illustrate the realization of the building blocks in Fig. S1(b) by Fig. S6, and the realization of building blocks of Fig. S1(c) is just similar. In Fig. S6, the red and blue connections between different acoustic resonators represent the connection structures of Fig. S5(c) and S5(d), respectively. As to the realistic experimental setup, the mature 3D-printing technique with photosensitive resin has been demonstrated to be a powerful method of realizing all these models in acoustic systems."
