    "abstractText": "a-Lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring sulfur-containing fatty acid with high antioxidant activity. It is also used to treat diabetes, nerve pain, weight loss, heart disease, and primary mitochondrial disorders. Moreover, numerous therapeutic agents have been studied for managing other clinical conditions, including for anticancer, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, and anti-AD treatments. The medicinal importance of ALA, especially its biologically active form (R-ALA), has attracted considerable attention from synthetic chemists in industrial and academic fields. In this review, we discuss synthetic approaches to ALA and RALA over the past 70 years (1952 to the present), which will help medicinal chemists further develop novel routes for their synthesis.",

ALA has a single chiral center at C6, resulting in two enantiomeric forms: R- and S-ALA.5 Notably, ALA exists in nature as the R enantiomer, which is the biologically active form. However, ALA is oen marketed in its racemic form because S-ALA shows no signicant biological side effects. The reduced form of ALA is an active metabolite, called dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), which can be converted to ALA under various oxidative conditions such as FeCl3/O2 and I2/KI.\nThe high medicinal importance of ALA, especially R-ALA,6 has attracted great attention from synthetic chemists in industrial and academic elds. The global ALA market size was valued at USD 106.89 million in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 3.86 percent during the forecast period, reaching USD 134.15 million by 2028. The extensive demand for ALA in global markets 3000\u20133500 tons per year necessitates the development of efficient synthetic approaches. Over the past 70 years, numerous synthetic approaches have been patented and reported. To the best of our knowledge, only a few reviews have summarized ALA's synthesis approaches.

In the functional modication approach, ALA can be readily synthesized from precursors bearing inherent C2\u2013C5 linkage and two terminal functional groups. Some of these precursors are commercially available, but some must be synthesized from simple building blocks or cyclic compounds, resulting in fragment assembly and ring-opening approaches. In the second part, stereoselective approaches to R-ALA are summarized and classied into four sections: chiral resolution (chemical and enzymatic), chiral pool, chiral auxiliary, and asymmetric catalysts (chemical and enzymatic) to introduce chirality into the molecule (Fig. 2b).\nScheme 2 Soper's synthesis of ALA.\n2.

            "text": "In 1952, Bullock et al. briey reported the rst total synthesis of racemic ALA.9 Later, they published the full article describing their synthetic approach which conrmed the structure of ALA.,10 Dicarbonyl compounds have great potential to be transformed into ve-membered disulde rings and carboxylic acids, which are key moieties in ALA. As shown in Scheme 1, compound 1, ethyl 6-chloro-6-oxohexanoate was selected as the starting material, because its inherent structure could be transformed into that of ALA through functional modications. Initially, the Lewis acid-catalyzed insertion of ethene, followed by the spontaneous elimination of hydrogen chloride, afforded unsaturated ketone 2. Treatment of 2 with thiolacetic acid afforded compound 3, whose ketone group was reduced to a tertiary alcohol group. Subsequent hydrolysis delivered compound 4, which reacted with excess thiourea and hydriodic acid to yield DHLA. Finally, DHLA was oxidized smoothly in the presence of oxygen and ferric chloride to deliver ALA. The yields of most of these steps have not been previously reported.\nInspired by this pioneering work, Soper et al. expanded the rst generation of synthetic approaches, especially enriching the paths from keto acids, such as compound 6, to ALA (Scheme 2).11 Keto acid 6 was synthesized from 1 according to Bullock's protocol. Having synthesized keto acid 6, three divided paths were developed, providing fundamental benets for the subsequent synthesis. Path I began with the NaBH4-mediated reduction of 6 to yield hydroxy acid 7 with\nScheme 1 Bullock's synthesis of ALA.\n36348 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36346\u201336363\na 95% yield. The esterication of 7 with tosyl, followed by treatment with benzyl mercaptan and a sodium hydroxide solution gave 6,8-dibenzylmercapto\u00f6ctanoic acid 8 in 17.5% yield over two steps. Aer deprotection, theDHLAwas obtained. The subsequent oxidation of DHLA directly delivered ALA. Path II was developed using tribenzyl mercaptocaprylic acid 9 as the key intermediate, obtained from 6 in the presence of benzyl mercaptan and anhydrous zinc chloride. The treatment of 9 with liquid ammonia and solid sodium in anhydrous ether afforded DHLA, which was then oxidized to ALA. Alternatively, they developed a more efficient two-step synthetic route to ALA from 6 (path III). Hydrogenation of 6 using a sulfur/cobalt sulde catalyst in the presence of H2 followed by the oxidation of DHLA afforded ALA in 12% yield over two steps.\nSince 6,8-dibenzylmercapto\u00f6ctanoic acid 8 and DHLA are useful intermediates for synthesizing ALA, an improved synthesis of 8 and DHLA was further developed by Reed et al. in 1955.12 As shown in Scheme 3, the synthesis also commenced with acid chloride 1, which was transformed into 8-chloro-6oxoctano\u00f6ate 10. Without purication, compound 10 was transformed into dibromo esters 12 and dichloro esters 13 as key intermediates. The former paths IV and V started from heating 10 to give a,b-unsaturated ketone 11. The treatment of ketone 11 with anhydrous hydrogen bromide, followed by reduction and bromination, generated dibromo ester 12, which was readily transformed into DHLA and 8. In path IV, ALA was synthesized in 60\u201368% yields based on DHLA via thiolation and oxidation. In path V, dibromo ester 12 was converted to 8 in 82% yield by treatment with sodium benzyl mercaptide, followed by alkaline hydrolysis. ALA was synthesized in high yield according to Soper's protocol. In addition, path VI readily converted dichloro ester 13 to ALA. Later, these paths were widely used to synthesize ALA and were published in many patents13 and in the literature.14\nWalton et al. reported the synthesis of ALA starting from 7- carbethoxy-2-heptenoic acid 14 by introducing a thiol group at\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The following two-step reactions involving NaBH4-mediated reduction and alkaline hydrolysis proceeded smoothly to generate 8-hydroxy-6thioloctanoic acid 17. The replacement of 17 followed by oxidation gave rise to ALA. R-ALA and S-ALA were synthesized using the corresponding chiral isomers of 15.\nIn 1987, Rao et al. developed a highly regioselective allylic oxidation of olens using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) and selenium dioxide (SeO2) to construct a secondary allylic alcohol, followed by the hydroboration\u2013oxidation of the terminal double bond to construct a 1,3-diol system. By using this method, as illustrated in Scheme 5.16 Olen methyl 7-octenoate 19 was synthesized from azelaic acid 18 via decarboxylative elimination using Pb(OAc)4/Cu(OAc)2/pyridine. In the presence of selenium dioxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, the regioselective allylic\nScheme 4 Walton's synthesis of ALA.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Finally, the conversion of 21 to dimesylate 22, reaction with Na2S/S, and hydrolysis of the ester completed the synthesis of ALA.\nThe Prins reaction is an acid-catalyzed condensation of olens with aldehydes to produce 1,3-diols, 1,3-dioxanes, or unsaturated alcohols. Among them, 1,3-diols and 1,3-dioxanes can be readily transformed into ve-membered disulde rings. In 1956, Braude et al. reported a route to ALA from hept-6-enoic acid 23 using the Prins reaction as the key step (Scheme 6).17 The Prins reaction of 23 generated a mixture of 1,3-dioxane 24 and acyl-protected 1,3-diol 25 in a ratio of 5 : 1. The conversions of Prins reaction products 24 and 25 into methyl esters 26 and 27 were performed to avoid lactonization during the synthesis of diol 28. Diol 28 was transformed into ALA as previously described. The authors reported that the overall ALA yield was 20\u201330%."

Subsequently, by employing this reaction as the key step, ALA was synthesized (Scheme 8).19 The synthesis began with the alkylation of ethylacetoacetate 32 and 5-bromopent-1-ene 33. The obtained intermediate 34 was reduced stepwise to 1,3-diol 35, whose alcohol groups were brominated to yield 6,8-dibromooctanoic acid 36. Oxidative cleavage of the terminal double bond in the presence of KMnO4 afforded compound 37 as a precursor to cyclic disuldes.

Thus, efforts were made to synthesize ALA from cyclic compounds, followed by introducing the C2\u2013C5 linkage and the carboxylic acid group at any stage of the synthesis.\nIn 1955, Wagner et al. reported a synthesis of ALA by adopting g-butyrolactone 52 as the starting material (Scheme 11).22 The rst sulfur-containing intermediate 54 was synthesized from lactone 52, which was then converted into its acid chloride 55. Acylation, elimination of the t-butyl group, and decarboxylation in the presence of a catalytic amount of TsOH transformed 55 to 57, followed by condensation with methyl acrylate. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of 57 under acidic conditions generated keto acid 59. The reduction of 59 to 61was accomplished in two steps. Finally, demethylation and subsequent oxidation occurred, leading to ALA. The yields of most of these steps have not been reported in the literature.\nAnother synthetic work was reported by Rao et al. in 1995 using Birch reduction as the key step (Scheme 12).23 The synthesis commenced with a Wittig reaction of terephthalaldehyde 62 and the ylide obtained from (3-carbomethoxy) propyl triphenylphosphonium bromide to yield an olenic intermediate. Subsequent Pd\u2013C-mediated hydrogenation, LAHmediated reduction, and protection of the alcohols with tetrahydropyran gave diTHP ether 63 in 62% yield.

In the last stage, ALA was synthesized according to a known procedure.\nIn 1957, Segre et al. selected ethyl cyclohexanone-2-acetate 68 as a precursor for ALA synthesis (Scheme 13).24 The synthesis featured the Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation as the key step. A series of protection, reduction, and deprotection transformed 68 into ketone 70, which was then treated with a solution of peracetic acid (containing active oxygen) to produce seven-membered cyclolactone 71 in 65% yield. The treatment of lactone 71 with thiourea in a strong mineral acid via alkaline hydrolysis of the isothiuronium salt easily yielded DHLA, which afforded the desired ALA aer oxidation.\nIn 1999, Paust et al. followed the Baeyer\u2013Villiger strategy to develop an optimized synthesis.25 As shown in Scheme 14, initially, the key intermediate 74 was synthesized in one stage from the base chemicals, cyclohexanone 72 and vinyl ethyl ether 73, catalyzed by di-tert-butyl peroxide.

Aer acid hydrolysis, R-ALA was obtained.\nScheme 15 Chavan's synthesis of ALA.\n36352 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36346\u201336363\nAlternatively, the resolution of racemic intermediates via a synthetic route is another method for synthesizing R-ALA. As shown in Scheme 17, S-83, a key intermediate for synthesizing R-ALA can be obtained by the optical resolution of racemic 6,8- dichlorooctanoic acid (DCA) 83 with (\u2212)-ephedrine.14,28\nThe aforementioned studies mainly involved esterication of the carboxylic group located four carbon atoms away from the stereogenic center, which remains a difficult task. In 2010, Kaku et al. developed the thermodynamically controlled deracemization of racemic monosubstituted cycloalkanones and utilized this methodology to accomplish the synthesis of R-ALA (Scheme 18).29 Using chiral 1,3-dioxolane as the chiral host molecule with sodium hydroxide in aqueous methanol, cycloalkanone 84 was converted into its R-isomers R-84 with 99% ee and 90% yield. R-84 was subjected to Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation using 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid and anhydrous sodium dihydrogen phosphate to afford lactone 85 in 93% yield. Ringopening iodination of 85 and subsequent mesylation afforded 86, which was transformed into R-ALA in the presence of sodium sulde and sulfur in DMF.\nKinetic resolution is a widely used method that provides easy access to catalysts, separation and recovery of catalysts, high enantiomeric excess, and high practical feasibility. Jacobsen's hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) method uses a readily accessible Co-based chiral salen complex as the catalyst and is an efficient approach for the preparation of highly enantioselective chiral epoxides and diols with high optical purity in excellent yields. In 2006, Bose utilized the HKR of 1 in the synthesis of R-ALA.30 As shown in Scheme 19, racemic epoxide 87 was treated with (R,R)-salen\u2013Co(III)\u2013OAc complex and H2O at ambient temperature to afford a mixture of 1,2-diol 88 in 43% yield and epoxide R-87 in 47% yield and 98% ee.

R-ALA was synthesized through the resolution of racemic ALA by enzymatic esterication of the carboxylic group, which consists of four carbon atoms away from the stereogenic center (Scheme 21). In 1997, Fadnavis et al. used the lipase from Candida rugosa (E.C.3.1.1.3) to catalyze the enantioselective esterication of racemic ALA with aliphatic alcohols in hexane.31 The enzyme shows enantioselectivity towards the S-ALA (72% ee). In 2009, Yan et al. reported that the lipase from Aspergillus oryzae WZ007 is another potential candidate for enzymatic resolution of ALA.32 In 2015, Liu et al. combined an ionic liquid co-lyophilized lipase with microwave irradiation to improve enzyme performance in the enantioselective esterication of ALA.33 Under optimal reaction conditions, the ionic liquid co-lyophilized lipase exhibited satisfactory enzyme performance (E value, 41.2; enzyme activity, 178.1 mmol h\u22121 mg\u22121).\nEnzymatic resolution involving a remote chiral center is a difficult task. The enzymatic resolution of racemic precursors for R-ALA is an alternative route. In 1996, Iyengar et al. reported a synthetic sequence for the preparation of 21, the precursor of R-ALA, using the kinetic resolution of 94 as the key step (Scheme 22).34 Kinetic resolution of racemic compound 94 with lipase from Candida cylindracea afforded S-94 with good enantiomeric purity and good yield (84% ee, 80% yield). Lithium aluminum hydride-mediated reduction and regioselective opening with iodotrimethylsilane gave rise to 95, the desired six-carbon synthon with a protected diol system. The alkylation of benzylmethyl malonate with 95 and subsequent debenzylation generated 96, which was converted into a diol 21 precursor via decarboxylation, and deprotection.\nIn 2014, Zhou et al. developed a lipase-catalyzed transacylation process to resolve ethyl 8-chloro-6-hydroxy octanoate 97 and produced two important chiral precursors, R-97 and 99, for the synthesis of R-ALA (Scheme 23).35 Aer systematically screening, the optimized condition of optical resolution was\nScheme 22 Iyengar's synthesis of R-ALA.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36346\u201336363 | 36353\nScheme 25 Golding's synthesis of S-ALA.\nScheme 23 Zhou's synthesis of R-ALA.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of 150 was carried out smoothly using Ti(OiPr)4/(+)-DIPT/tBuOOH, giving epoxy alcohol 151 in 82% yield and 96% ee. The reduction of 151 with Red-Al resulted in the selective formation of diol S-35 in 89% yield. Under conditions using MsCl/Et3N, S-35 was sulfonated. Ruthenium tetroxide oxidation of the terminal double bond formed carboxylic acid S67 in 75% yield over two steps. Finally, the disulde displacement of themethanesulfonate groups of the potassium salt of S67 afforded R-ALA in 52% yield.\nScheme 33 Menon's synthesis of S-ALA.\nScheme 34 Sutherland's asymmetric synthesis of R-ALA.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In 2000, Zimmer et al. used enantioselective allylation as the key step in the formal synthesis of R-ALA (Scheme 35).47 Starting with the readily accessible methoxycarbonyl aldehyde 152, (S)BINOL/Ti(OiPr)4 catalyzed enantioselective allylation was performed with commercially available allyltributylstannane 153, giving 154 in 73% yield and 98% ee. According to a previously reported protocol, R-ALA was targeted from 154.\nIn 2001, Sudalai et al. developed two asymmetric catalytic methods to synthesize R-ALA, as shown in (Schemes 36 and 37).48 First, asymmetric dihydroxylation was adopted as the key step in the construction of the chiral center of R-ALA. Olenic diester 1 was subjected to OsO4-catalyzed asymmetric dihydroxylation using hydroquinidine 1,4-phthalazinediyl diether [(DHQD)2\u2013PHAL] as the chiral ligand, affording chiral diol 156 in 95% yield and 96% ee. Diol 156was then converted into cyclic sulfate 157, which was reduced to give chiral alcohol 158 in 63% yield. Further selective reduction of one of the ester groups in 158 afforded S-21 in 85% yield, which was converted to R-ALA, according to a previously reported protocol.\nSudalai developed another synthesis commencing with the Swern oxidation of alcohol 159, affording aldehyde 160 in 75% yield (Scheme 37).48 The C\u2013H insertion of ethyl diazoacetate with 160 in the presence of a catalytic amount of anhydrous SnCl2 or the Reformatsky reaction of 160 followed by PCCmediated oxidation gave keto ester 161 in 65% yield. Under the atmosphere of H2 (400 psi), S-BINAP\u2013Ru-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 161 proceeded smoothly to generate 162 in 90% yield and 96% ee. The reduction of the ester functional group in 162 using NaBH4\u2013CuSO4 in EtOH yielded the diol intermediate, which was subsequently mesylated under standard conditions to yield 163. Carboxylic acid S-67 was obtained from 163 in three steps of deprotection and oxidation. Accordingly, the disulde displacement of S-67 delivered R-ALA.\nScheme 35 Zimmer's asymmetric synthesis of R-ALA.\nScheme 36 Sudalai's first asymmetric synthesis of R-ALA.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nIn 2004, Chavan et al. reported the synthesis of R-ALA by employing Claisen orthoester rearrangement and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation as key steps (Scheme 38).49 Initially, Claisen rearrangement of monoprotected allylic alcohol 159 with triethyl orthoacetate in the presence of catalytic propionic acid afforded unsaturated ester 164 in 94% yield. Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation using AD-mixa and the in situ cyclization of 165 furnished hydroxy lactone 166 in 95% yield and 93% ee. Lactone 166 was treated with triphenylphosphine, iodine, and imidazole to give iodolactone 167, whose reduction was followed by an in situ two-carbon Wittig reaction to give unsaturated ester 168. Under the conditions of W2 RANEY\u00ae and hydrogen, the benzyl protection and iodine were removed, and the double bond was reduced in one pot, giving diol S-51 as a known intermediate for the synthesis of R-ALA. R-ALA was synthesized according to the established protocol.\nIn 2002, Zimmer et al. developed the asymmetric synthesis of R-ALA using an enantioselective aldol reaction as the key transformation.50 As shown in Scheme 39, starting with the easily accessible substrate 169, enantioselective aldol reactions were performed with S-ketene silyl acetal 170 in the presence of R-BINOL, Ti(Oi-Pr)4 and phenol, affording chiral alcohol 171 in 76% yield and $97% ee. The subsequent NaBH4-mediated reduction of 171 generated the key intermediate 172 in 61% yield, which was converted into enantiopure R-ALA according to a previously reported protocol.\nScheme 38 Chavan's asymmetric synthesis of R-ALA.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 36346\u201336363 | 36357\nScheme 39 Zimmer's asymmetric synthesis of R-ALA.\nScheme 41 Kalkote's asymmetric synthesis of R-ALA.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The regioselective Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation of ketone 174 gave lactone intermediate 175, which could be reduced to chiral compound 176. Finally, treatment of 176 with sodium methoxide in methanol afforded chiral diol S-21 in 91% yield. The target R-ALA was obtained using known synthetic sequences.\nIn 2010, Kalkote et al. reported an organocatalytic enantioselective approach for the synthesis of R-ALA using an L-prolinecatalyzed sequential aminoxylation\u2013HWE olenation reaction of aldehydes as the key step.52 The synthesis began with commercially available diol 46 as shown in Scheme 41. The mono-hydroxyl protection of diol 46 and subsequent oxidation provided aldehyde 177 in 74% yield in two steps. Aldehyde 177 was subjected to the following L-proline-catalyzed aminoxylation/HWE olenation/hydrogenation sequence to yield chiral hydroxyester 178 in 58% yield and 97% ee. Aer the protection of 178, ester 179 was then reduced to aldehyde 180 with DIBAL-H and subjected to HWE olenation to obtain a,bunsaturated ester 181, which was hydrogenated to afford saturated ester 182. Finally, R-ALA was synthesized from 182 according to a previously reported protocol."

Subsequent reduction, acetal protection, alkylation and deprotection generated the diol S-51, which was in turn converted into R-ALA following published procedures.\nIn 1990, Dasaradhi et al. reported the stereo-controlled reduction of keto acetals by baker's yeast immobilized on calcium alginate beads to synthesize R-ALA (Scheme 44).55 The Cu-catalyzed bromoform addition of 190 followed by treatment with potassium acetate and 18-crown-6 initiated the synthesis of R-ALA, yielding compound 191 in 68% yield over two steps.

Ester 192 was enantiospecically reduced using a glucose solution containing Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCIM 3044) immobilized on calcium alginate beads to generate crude product 193 in 60% yield and 99% ee. R-ALA was obtained aer deprotection, NaBH4 reduction, mesylation, and hydrolysis R-ALA was achieved.\nIn 1996, Bezbarua et al. reported the synthesis of R-ALA by employing the baker's yeast reduction of ketones as a key step.56 As shown in Scheme 45, the substrate of baker's yeast reduction, ketone 195, was obtained from 2-nitrocyclohexanone 194. Ketone 195 was enantiospecically reduced using Baker's yeast to yield chiral alcohol 196. The selective hydrolysis of 196 with tetrabutylammonium iodide in CHCl3 afforded chiral diol S-21 in 80% yield, which was converted to R-ALA according to a previously reported approach.\nIn 1999, Bringmann et al. reported an approach to gain RALA by exploiting 3-oxodiesters 197 as a starting material (Scheme 46).57 The reduction of 197 took place using baker's\nScheme 45 Bezbarua's asymmetric synthesis of R-ALA.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nyeast, giving chiral alcohol 198 in 75% yield and 94% ee. R-ALA was achieved from 198 by using previously reported methods.\nIn 2015, Xu and Zheng et al. discovered a ketoreductase CpAR2 from Candida parapsilosis that was able to highly stereoselective reduce ethyl 8-chloro-6-oxooctanoate 1 to (R)-8chloro-6-hydroxyoctanoate 2 (in 85% yield with >99% ee), an advanced chiral intermediate to R-ALA, with a space-time yield of 530 g L\u22121 d\u22121 (Scheme 47).27a However, high biocatalyst loading (10 g L\u22121 of dry E. coli cells coexpressing CpAR2 and a glucose dehydrogenase BmGDH) is required. Generally, the biocatalyst loading should be less than 5 g L\u22121 for a green and economical chemical process. Thus, a directed evolution approach was adopted to increase the enzyme activity and thermal stability simultaneously.58 By using error-prone PCR, the combined mutant S131Y/Q252I was obtained, resulting improved activity (214 U mg\u22121 versus 120 U mg\u22121 for wild-type enzyme) and the half-deactivating temperature (T50, for 15 min incubation, increased by 2.3 \u00b0C). Gratifyingly, as low as 2 g L\u22121 of the lyophilized E. coli cells coexpressing CpAR2S131Y/ Q252I and GDH was sufficient to completely reduce 110 g L\u22121 of 1 and achieve the higher space-time yield (566 g L\u22121 d\u22121), affording the desired 2 in 85% yield with >99% ee.\nEnzymatic Baeyer\u2013Villiger Oxidations of ketone provide chiral lactones which are precursors to readily construct chiral alcohol and carbonyl groups via ring-opening. Two Baeyer\u2013Villiger monooxygenases were used in the synthesis of R-ALA, resulting in different stereoselectivities. As shown in Scheme 48, Adger et al. used Baeyer\u2013Villiger monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida NCIMB 10007 to catalyze the oxidation of 2- substituted cycloalkanone 70, yielding R-71 with good enantioselectivities (78\u201383% ee).59 Reductive ring opening was performed to yield R-21.

            "text": "This study demonstrates signicant progress made over the past 70 years in the eld of total ALA synthesis. Diverse routes and methods for synthesizing ALA have been described in the literature, including racemic synthesis, chemical and enzymatic resolution synthesis, asymmetric chiral pool synthesis, asymmetric chiral auxiliary synthesis, enzyme-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis, chemical-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis. While these methods generally focus on basic scientic research, few of them have proposed synthetic pathways for industrial production.\nAccordingly, with the ever-growing demand for ALA, practical, concise, and general synthetic strategies and advanced technologies will continue to be explored and exploited. For example, continuous-ow chemistry, enzyme engineering, and other new technologies could have broadly applications in the total synthesis of ALA to achieve efficient, economical, and energy-saving industrial production. The ability to combine new technologies advances numerous possibilities for creating cheaper and higher quality products to fulll the needs of the population. The development of these new technologies will undoubtedly benet future applications. Furthermore, new technologies and strategies will be implemented in the synthesis of ALA to provide ideas and insights for scientic researchers and peers, associated with these realms and aspects in the long run.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
