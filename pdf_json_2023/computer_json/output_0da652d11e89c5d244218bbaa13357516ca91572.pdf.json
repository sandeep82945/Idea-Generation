    "abstractText": "This paper proposes two nonlinear dynamics to solve constrained distributed optimization problem for resource allocation over a multi-agent network. In this setup, coupling constraint refers to resource-demand balance which is preserved at all-times. The proposed solutions can address various model nonlinearities, for example, due to quantization and/or saturation. Further, it allows to reach faster convergence or to robustify the solution against impulsive noise or uncertainties. We prove convergence over weakly connected networks using convex analysis and Lyapunov theory. Our findings show that convergence can be reached for general sign-preserving odd nonlinearity. We further propose delay-tolerant mechanisms to handle general bounded heterogeneous time-varying delays over the communication network of agents while preserving all-time feasibility. This work finds application in CPU scheduling and coverage control among others. This paper advances the state-of-the-art by addressing (i) possible nonlinearity on the agents/links, meanwhile hanPreprint submitted to Systems and Control Letters October 30, 2023 dling (ii) resource-demand feasibility at all times, (iii) uniform-connectivity instead of all-time connectivity, and (iv) possible heterogeneous and timevarying delays. To our best knowledge, no existing work addresses contributions (i)-(iv) altogether. Simulations and comparative analysis are provided to corroborate our contributions.",

In this setup, coupling constraint refers to resource-demand balance which is preserved at all-times. The proposed solutions can address various model nonlinearities, for example, due to quantization and/or saturation. Further, it allows to reach faster convergence or to robustify the solution against impulsive noise or uncertainties. We prove convergence over weakly connected networks using convex analysis and Lyapunov theory. Our findings show that convergence can be reached for general sign-preserving odd nonlinearity. We further propose delay-tolerant mechanisms to handle general bounded heterogeneous time-varying delays over the communication network of agents while preserving all-time feasibility.

Introduction\n1.1. Background\nDistributed algorithms have gained considerable attention because of recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and parallel processing. Distributed optimization over multi-agent networks, in particular, has emerged as an effective solution in large-scale applications ranging from machine-learning for large-scale data mining [1, 2] to power flow optimization over the smart grid [3, 4, 5, 6]. Distributed/decentralized algorithms outperform centralized ones in many aspects: no-single-node-of-failure, scalability, speed/efficiency, etc. Distributed or decentralized optimization allows for scaling the problem-solving process to handle larger and more complex optimization problems by distributing the computational load across multiple nodes. If one of the node fails, the others can still solve the remaining objective function and this makes distributed optimization inherently more resilient to node-failures. Distributed resource allocation can use parallel processing to speed up the optimization process. By dividing the problem into sub-problems and solving them concurrently, the overall solution can be obtained faster and computationally more efficient than a centralized approach. In this work, we propose a distributed setup for resource allocation over general multi-agent systems with constraints on the communication network or the agents.\n1.2. Challenges\nIn real-world applications, many model nonlinearities exist in practice, some of which stem from the inherent physical constraints, e.g., actuator saturation or quantized data exchange [7, 8], and some are purposely added, e.g., to improve the convergence rate [9, 10] or robustness to impulsive noise and uncertainties [11]. For example, in automatic generation control setup\n2\nfor power systems there exist ramp-rate-limit (RRL) due to limited rate of power generation by the real-world generators. In other words, the increase and decrease of the power generation cannot follow any rate but is limited. Most existing results in the literature cannot address this limit and therefore the generators cannot follow the rates assigned by these solutions. Another example is when the information exchange among the agents is quantized. Most existing linear solutions do not address quantized information exchange among the agents and, in this aspect, the algorithm is not realistic. Such unseen nonlinearities make networked optimization (both constrained and unconstrained) more challenging in terms of computation, accuracy, feasibility, optimality, and convergence. Further, the network itself might be subject to time delays, or asynchronous data-transmission [12, 13, 14, 15, 5]. The network also may lose network connectivity over some intermittent timeintervals (e.g., due to packet loss or link failure). The notion of constraint feasibility is another challenging issue. The equality-constraint ensures the resource-demand balance, and its violation may cause service disruption. This paper aims to address general nonlinear solutions while handling network latency, uniform network connectivity, and all-time feasibility. The objective function is also nonlinear and this nonlinearity might be due to addressing the box constraints as penalty terms.\n1.3. Literature Review\nThe literature on distributed optimization, both constrained and unconstrained, mainly assumes linear models and no delay for data exchange over the network. There exist a few nonlinear reinforcement-learning-based models for resource allocation and economic dispatch [16, 17]. These works find optimal allocation with no prior knowledge of the mathematical formulation of the actual generation costs. In [16] a Neural-Network is used to learn the relationship between the demand and the optimal output of each generation unit, while [17] combines the state-action-value function approximation with a distributed optimization based on multiplier splitting. Some existing works focus on one specific nonlinearity, e.g., quantized allocation/informationsharing [18, 19, 20, 21, 7, 22, 23] or saturated dynamics [7, 24]. Some others are devoted to address sign-based nonlinearities to improve the convergence rate, e.g., to reach the optimal value in finite-time [25, 26] or fixed-time [27, 9, 10]. Such fixed/finite dynamics are also prevalent in consensus literature [25, 28, 11] which also allow for robust and noise-resilient design. However, these solutions are designed for a specific case and cannot handle\n3\ncomposition of two or more nonlinearities. Moreover, in many applications, the network is dynamic (time-varying) due to, e.g., agents\u2019 mobility and may even get disconnected over some time intervals. Therefore, it is more practical to assume uniform connectivity, in contrast to all-time connectivity in many existing solutions [29, 30]. Latency is another networking issue that may cause the optimization algorithm to diverge. Few works in this literature address possible homogeneous delays at all links or asynchronous communication [15, 31], with no consideration of model nonlinearities. In the sum-preserving constrained optimization, another challenge (other than stability) is to preserve all-time feasibility [29, 6] (in contrast to asymptotic feasibility [32, 33, 15]). All-time feasibility implies that, as the solution evolves, the constraint on the states always holds. For example, in the economic dispatch problem (EDP), at any termination point of the algorithm, the sum of the power states must be equal to the load demand. Otherwise, it causes disruption, power delivery issues, and even system breakdown [29, 6]. Such all-time feasibility conditions cannot be addressed by dual-based solutions, e.g., alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers (ADMM) methods [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. These works claim to reach feasibility fast enough within the running interval of the algorithm. Besides, the mentioned nonlinearities, network variation, uniform connectivity, and latency have not been addressed by the existing ADMM solutions [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Some of the existing algorithms, on the other hand, solve specific quadratic-form problems, for example, consensus-based solutions for CPU scheduling [30] or economic dispatch [41]. In general, however, the objective could be nonquadratic, e.g., because of additional penalty terms and barrier functions to handle the so-called box constraints.\n1.4. Motivations\nWhat is missing in the existing literature is a general method to address \u201cmodel nonlinearitiy\u201d to solve (general) non-quadratic objectives while considering uniform connectivity, latency, and sum-preserving all-time feasibility altogether. The nonlinearity of the node dynamics might be due to, for example, ramp-rate-limit (RRL) of the generators in automatic generation control (AGC) [42]. The other common issue is quantized information exchange in real-world communication networks that motivates the use of algorithm which can handle such a nonlinearity. In this work, we kept the application general and we focus on general multi-agent systems with communication networks. The communication networks often introduce delays due to packet\n4\nprocessing, transmission time, and network congestion. Additionally, agents are subject to some processing time before state-update or message-sharing. Therefore, the information sent from one agent/node may reach the receiver agent with certain time-delay. These delays may cause divergence of the solution and/or feasibility and optimality gap. This motivates the need to introduce a delay-tolerant solution for real-world applications. Furthermore, the network itself might be subject to some changes and lose connectivity over intermittent time-intervals due to, for example, agents\u2019 mobility. This motivates the use of algorithms to handle uniform-connectivity instead of all-time network connectivity. Another motivation is to address all-time feasibility of the equality-constraint to ensure resource-demand balance at all times. This guarantees that there is no service disruption before the termination of the algorithm at any time. This work finds many applications, e.g., in CPU scheduling [43], coverage control [44], and plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging coordination [45] among others.\n1.5. Main Contributions\nIn this work, we propose two general nonlinear solutions for distributed constrained convex optimization: one addressing the nonlinearity of the nodes and one of the links. Sufficient conditions on the nonlinearity and network connectivity to ensure convergence are discussed. The Lyapunovtype proof analysis is irrespective of the specific type of nonlinearity. Therefore, the algorithm can address certain inherent physical model nonlinearity (e.g., quantization and/or saturation) or purposely added nonlinearity (e.g., signum-based) to design fast-convergent or robust-to-noise solutions. Our model can handle the composition of more than one nonlinear mapping. In power networks, for example, the saturated generator dynamics due to RRLs is not addressed by the existing methods [6, 46, 4, 26, 47, 41, 31] in the AGC setup. Our proposed general multi-agent network can be adapted to communicate and transmit quantized information, address actuator saturation, reach a tunable (or predefined) rate of convergence, embrace resiliency and impulsive-noise-tolerance, or any composition of such nonlinear models. We prove coupling-constraint feasibility and convergence subject to general upper/lower sector-bound nonlinearity. In other words, sufficient conditions on the model\u2019s nonlinearity are derived to not violate all-time sum-preserving feasibility (resource-demand balance) and convergence to the optimal value; see examples in Section 8.\n5\nWe discuss both continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) solutions. In the DT case, we design delay-tolerant solutions to handle finite arbitrary and heterogeneous time delays over the network. We prove constraint feasibility and convergence/stability under bounded step sizes and certain assumptions on the time-delays. Two approaches to handle network latency are given: i) Case I, updating over a longer time scale after receiving all delayed information, and ii) Case II, updating by all the information received at the same time scale as the DT dynamics. The proposed delay-tolerant solutions lead to no feasibility gap over switching and uniformly connected networks (instead of all-time connectivity) and in the presence of heterogeneous delays and model nonlinearity. This is in contrast to, e.g., the solution by [15] with some feasibility gap. The uniform connectivity is motivated by applications in mobile sensor networks, where the links may come and go as the mobile sensors (or robots) move into and out of line-of-sight (or broadcast range) of each other. The network may sometimes even lose connectivity due to link failure or even packet loss, while it maintains uniform connectivity over some finite time intervals. Finally, we apply our proposed solutions in distributed setup with (i) quadratic costs and (ii) non-quadratic costs with logarithmically quantized values.\nWe summarized our contributions in the following:\n(i) Possible inherent and additive nonlinearity in the model dynamics can be addressed by our proposed resource allocation model with general non-quadratic objective functions allowing for consideration of penalty/barrier functions.\n(ii) Our proposed delay-tolerant solution can handle possible heterogeneous and arbitrary delays of the links over general uniformly-connected networks. The values of delays might be different at the links and change over time while the network may lose connectivity over some intermittent time-intervals.\n(iii) Our proposed distributed resource allocation is all-time feasible implying that at all times the resource-demand balance holds even in the presence of time-delays and losing network connectivity. This is in contrast to dual formulation methods in which the feasibility gap asymptotically reduces over time. The all-time resource-demand feasibility prevents service disruption at any termination/assignment time of the algorithm.\n6\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous works in the literature address contributions (i)-(iii) altogether.\n1.6. Paper organization\nWe introduce the preliminary notions and some useful lemmas to set up the problem in Section 2. The CT solutions are proposed in Section 3 and their convergence is discussed in Section 4. The DT counterparts subject to time delays are discussed in Sections 5 and 6. Applications and more simulations on sparse dynamic networks are presented in Sections 7 and 8. Finally, Section 9 concludes the paper.\n1.7. General Notation\nIn this paper, we present the column vectors in bold small letters and scalars with small letters. The matrices are denoted by capital letters. For notation simplicity, \u2202fi and \u2202 2fi denote\ndfi(xi) dxi and d 2fi(xi) dx2i , respectively. See\nthe full list of notations in Table 1.\nThe communication network of agents (also referred to as the multi-agent network) considered in this paper is modelled by a (possibly) time-varying\n7\ngraph G(t) = {V , E(t)} with a set of time-dependent links E(t) and timeinvariant set of nodes V = {1, . . . , n}. A link (i, j) \u2208 E(t) represents possible information exchange (communication) from the agent i to the agent j, and further implies that the agent i is in the neighbouring set of the agent j, defined as Nj(t) = {i|(i, j) \u2208 E(t)}. The link (j, i) \u2208 E(t) is weighted by Wij > 0 and W (t) = [Wij(t)] \u2208 Rn\u00d7n\u22650 represents the weight matrix of the network G(t). Clearly, W (t) follows the structure (zero-nonzero pattern) of the adjacency matrix associated with G(t). In G(t), we define a spanning tree as a sub-graph of size n (covering all nodes) in which there is only one path between every two nodes [48]. This spanning tree is known to include minimum possible links for connectivity [48]. Define the Laplacian matrix L(t) = [Lij(t)] as,\nLij(t) =\n{ \u2211 j\u2208Ni Wij(t), for i = j,\n\u2212Wij(t), for i \u0338= j. (1)"

            "text": "This paper considers equality-constraint optimization problems in the primal nonlinear formulation over a multi-agent network. The objective of the problem is to minimize the cost function while satisfying the (weighted) resource-demand balance constraint. This balance equality-constraint ensures that the weighted sum of resources meets the demand by the user, otherwise it may cause service disruption in the application under consideration. The mathematical formulation is as follows:\nmin z\nF\u0303 (z) := n\u2211\ni=1\nf\u0303i(zi)\ns.t. z\u22a4a = b\n(2)\nwhere element zi \u2208 R represents the state variable at agent i, Column vector z = [z1; . . . ; zn] \u2208 Rn is the collective vector state1, and column vector a = [a1; . . . ; an] \u2208 Rn and b \u2208 R are the constraint parameters. fi : R 7\u2192 R is the local cost (or loss) function at agent i, and the overall cost function\n1In its most general form, the problem can be extended to zi \u2208 Rm with m > 1 (as in [49, 50]). Considering m = 1 is for the sake of simplifying the proof analysis in Sections 4 and 5.\n8\nis F : Rn 7\u2192 R. The problem can be also extended to consider box constraints on the states, i.e., zi \u2264 zi \u2264 zi. In this case, one can eliminate these extra constraints by adding proper exact (nonlinear) penalty functions to every local objective; for example, changing the local objectives to f\u03c3i (zi) = fi(zi)+c([zi\u2212zi]++[zi\u2212zi]+), with [u]+ = max{u, 0}\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2208 N, and c \u2208 R+. Some other example penalties and barrier functions are discussed in [51]. In general, such penalty (or barrier) functions are non-quadratic and nonlinear, which makes the objective function non-quadratic and nonlinear; see examples in [49, 29]. Feasible initialization algorithms under such local constraints are discussed, for example, in [6].\nThe problem is generally stated in the following standard sum-preserving form\nmin x\nF (x) = n\u2211\ni=1\nfi(xi)\ns.t. n\u2211\ni=1\nxi = b\n(3)\nwhich can be obtained from (2) by simple change of variables ziai =: xi, with box constraints transformed into aizi \u2264 xi \u2264 aizi for ai > 0 and reversed otherwise. We aim to provide general nonlinear dynamics to solve problem (3) over a multi-agent network for different applications. The proposed solutions need to be distributed, implying that the information available at each agent i includes its own information (for example, its state and local objective) and the data received from agents j \u2208 Ni (its direct neighbours). This work addresses the case that agents/links are constrained with some nonlinearity. Moreover, the proposed distributed solution remains feasible (i.e., \u2211n i=1 xi(t) = b, \u2200t \u2265 0) and delay-tolerant (under heterogeneous timedelays). Further, it is possible that the communication network changes over time and loses connectivity at some bounded time-intervals. The assumptions on the objective function convexity (to include possible penalty terms), the network connectivity, feasibility, and the time-delay model are essential in the problem setup, as discussed next.\n2.1. Useful Lemmas and Definitions on Convexity\nDefinition 1 (Lipschitz Condition). Let h : R 7\u2192 R represent a nonlinear mapping. Function h(y) is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a real\n9\nconstant Kh such that for any y1, y2 \u2208 R,\n|h(y1)\u2212 h(y2)| \u2264 Kh|y1 \u2212 y2|. (4)\nDefinition 2 (Strict Convexity). A function f : R 7\u2192 R is strictly convex if \u2200y1, y2 \u2208 R, \u2200\u03ba \u2208 (0, 1),\nf(\u03bay1 + (1\u2212 \u03ba)y2) < \u03baf(y1) + (1\u2212 \u03ba)f(y2). (5)\nIt is known that for a smooth strictly convex function, \u22022f(y) > 0 for y \u2208 R [52].\nAssumption 1. The local cost/objective functions fi(xi) : R 7\u2192 R, i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} are smooth and strictly convex, i.e., \u22022fi(xi) > 0.\nNote that the penalized objective function f\u03c3i is also Lipschitz since [u] + is Lipschitz for \u03c3 \u2208 N\u22652. Recalling the Taylor series expansion, the following holds.\nLemma 1. [46] Given a continuous strictly-convex function f(y), two points y1, y2, and \u2206y =: y1 \u2212 y2, there exist y := \u03bay1 + (1 \u2212 \u03ba)y2, 0 < \u03ba < 1 such that,\nf(y1) = f(y2) +\u2207F (y2)\u22a4\u2206y + 1\n2 \u2206y\u22a4\u22022f(y)\u2206y. (6)\nLemma 2. [52] For cost function fi : R 7\u2192 R, assume 2v < \u22022fi < 2u with 0 < v \u2264 u < \u221e2. Then, for two points x1, x2 \u2208 R, and \u2206x := x1 \u2212 x2, the following statements hold:\nF (x1) < F (x2) +\u2207F (x1)\u2206x+ u\u2206x\u2206x. (7) F (x1) > F (x2) +\u2207F (x1)\u2206x+ v\u2206x\u2206x.\nLemma 3. Let Assumption 1 hold. The unique optimal solution x\u2217 = [x\u22171; . . . ;x \u2217 n] to problem (3) is in the form,\n\u2207F (x\u2217) = \u03c6\u22171n, (8)\nwith 1n as the column vector of 1s, \u2202fi \u2208 R as the gradient of the local function fi(\u00b7), \u2207F (x\u2217) = [\u2202f1(x\u22171); . . . ; \u2202fn(x\u2217n)] \u2208 Rn, and \u03c6\u2217 \u2208 R.\n2The condition 2v < \u22022fi(xi) implies that the cost function fi is strongly convex, see Assumption 5 in Section 5.1.\n10\nProof. The proof follows from the KKT condition and the Lagrange multipliers method [52, 46].\nSimilarly, the unique solution of problem (2) is in the form\u2207F\u0303 (z\u2217) = \u03c6\u0303\u2217a. Note that, in the presence of the box constraints, the above lemma assumes that z\u2217 meets those constraints, i.e., zi \u2264 z\u2217i \u2264 zi for all i.\nThroughout the paper, we refer to the feasibility condition as described below.\nDefinition 3 (Feasibility). Define the feasible sets S\u0303b = {z \u2208 Rn|z\u22a4a = b} in (2) or Sb = {x \u2208 Rn|x\u22a41n = b} in (3). A feasible solution then is defined as x \u2208 Sb or z \u2208 S\u0303b.\nLemma 4. Let Assumption 1 hold. Initializing from any feasible set S\u0303b there is only one unique point z\u2217 \u2208 S\u0303b such that \u2207F\u0303 (z\u2217) = \u03c6\u0303\u2217a for \u03c6\u0303\u2217 \u2208 R. Similarly, there is unique x\u2217 \u2208 Sb such that \u2207F (x\u2217) = \u03c6\u22171n.\nProof. The proof follows from the strict convexity of the function F (x) (and\nF\u0303 (x)) based on Assumption 1. For detailed proof based on level-set analysis see [18, 49].\n2.2. Recall on Graph Theory\nAssumption 2. The following assumptions hold3.\n(a) Every link in G(t) is bidirectional with the same weight on both sides at all times. This implies that the weight matrix W (t) is symmetric and balanced for t \u2265 0.\n(b) G(t) is uniformly connected over time-window B > 0 (or B-connected), implying that there exists B > 0 such that the (edge) union graph GB(t) = {V , EB(t)} includes a spanning tree for every t \u2265 0 where,\nEB(t) = t+B\u22c3 t E(t).\n3In this paper, we generally assume that the network is undirected for the delay-tolerant case. Extension to balanced directed graphs is discussed later in Remark 5.\n11\nThe bidirectional condition in Assumption 2 holds, for example, when agents/nodes have similar broadcasting levels and their communication range is the same. Therefore, if i \u2208 Nj(t) then j \u2208 Ni(t) while the assigned weights are the same Wij(t) = Wji(t) at all time. Later in the paper, this assumption is extended to weight-balanced directed networks with\n\u2211n i=1Wij(t) =\u2211n\nj=1Wij(t) for some particular cases. This B-connectivity condition in Assumption 2 is considerably weaker than all-time connectivity in many works (e.g., the ADMM solutions [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]). In particular, this allows G to lose connectivity over some time intervals. In other words, the connectivity requirement needs to be satisfied over longer time intervals in the case of links arbitrarily coming and going over the dynamic network. Such an assumption is known to be the least-connectivity assumption in consensus and distributed optimization literature [53, 54]. An example contradicting this condition is the case when G(t) contains two separate sub-graphs G1(t) and G2(t) with no path between them for t > t0, implying that no consensus can be achieved between the two. Recall that the sparse connectivity in Assumption 2(b) is strong enough for our algorithm to ensure convergence over the network (as shown later).\nRemark 1. The network conditions in Assumption 2 are less restrictive than the existing literature. In particular, the weight-balanced and symmetric condition (a) relaxes the weight-stochasticity in [35, 30], while uniformconnectivity (b) relaxes all-time connectivity in [34, 6, 29, 46]. These further motivate analysis of dynamic networks under link removal and packet loss, with no need to re-adjust (update) the link weights for ensuring stochasticity [55].\nThe next lemma gives an intuition to relate the dispersion of the entries in x with the eigen-spectrum of L. This mainly follows from the CourantFischer theorem and, for example, gives an estimate on the disagreement value in consensus algorithms [56].\nLemma 5. Consider a symmetric Laplacian matrix L (of a graph G) and vector x \u2208 Rn. Define the so-called dispersion state vector as x =: x\u2212 1\n\u22a4 n x n 1n.\nThe following statements hold:\nx\u22a4Lx = x\u22a4Lx, (9)\n\u03bb2\u2225x\u222522 \u2264 x\u22a4Lx \u2264 \u03bbn\u2225x\u222522, (10)\n12\nwith \u03bbn and \u03bb2 as the largest and smallest non-zero eigenvalue 4 of L, respectively. The results also hold for a weight-balanced (WB) directed graph (digraph) G by substituting Ls = L+L \u22a4\n2 in (9)-(10) with L as the Laplacian\nof the digraph.\nProof. Following the definition of matrix L, vector 1n is in the null space of L. Using this, the proof of (9) is straightforward since 1\u22a4nx = 0. The proof of (10) follows from (9) and the positive definiteness of L. See more details in [56].\nCorollary 1. The results of Lemma 5, can be extended for handling two variables x =: x\u2212 1 \u22a4 n x n 1n and y =: y \u2212 1 \u22a4 n y n 1n as follows:\nx\u22a4Ly = x\u22a4Ly, (11)\n\u03bb2x \u22a4y \u2264 x\u22a4Ly \u2264 \u03bbnx\u22a4y. (12)\nNote that, for a (edge) union graph GB, \u03bbn \u2264 \u03bbnB and \u03bb2 \u2264 \u03bb2B. Link addition (may) increase the algebraic connectivity of the network [58, 56]. Therefore, given G = G1 \u222a G2, we have \u03bb2(G) \u2265 \u03bb2(G1), \u03bb2(G) \u2265 \u03bb2(G2). This can be extended, following the Assumption 2, to show \u03bb2(GB(t)) \u2265 \u03bb2(G(t)). One can relate this to the fact that the algebraic connectivity (for 0-1 adjacency matrices) satisfies \u03bb2(G) \u2265 1ndg (with dg as the network diameter) [57, p. 571].\n2.3. Time-Delay Model for the DT agents\nIn general, multi-agent systems rely on communication networks to exchange information and coordinate actions. These communication networks may introduce delays due to packet processing, transmission time, and network congestion. These delays are typically quantized in integer multiples of the communication time step. Additionally, each node might have its processing time before sending a message or updating its state. These transmission delays between agents can introduce time delays.\nHere, we define the time-delay model with k denoting the discrete time index. Following the notation in [59, 60, 61], by \u03c4ij(k) we denote the delay\n4Recall that in graph theory, for (undirected) connected graphs with link-weight equal to 1, \u03bb2 is the second smallest eigenvalue of associated Laplacian matrix L and is a realvalued positive number. It is also known as the Fiedler value or Algebraic connectivity [56, 57].\n13\non the transmission link from agent i to agent j at DT step k = \u230a t T \u230b+1 with T as the sampling step and \u230a\u00b7\u230b as the floor function. If a message sent from agent j at time tj reaches agent i before time ti > tj, then \u03c4ij = \u2308 tiT \u2309\u2212\u230a tj T \u230b\u22121 (with \u2308\u00b7\u2309 as the ceil function). Therefore, for ti\u2212tj < T there is no delay over the link (j, i). However, typically delays are defined in discrete-time and the sent message at time-step k and received before time-step k+ \u03c4ij +1 implies delay equal to \u03c4ij.\nAssumption 3. The followings hold for (integer) time-delay \u03c4ij(k) on link (j, i) \u2208 E(k):\n(i) \u03c4ij(k) \u2264 \u03c4 , where 1 \u2264 \u03c4 <\u221e is an integer representing maximum possible delays on the transmission links (\u03c4 = 0 means no delay). Upperbound on \u03c4 guarantees no lost information and implies that the data from agent i at time k eventually is available to agent j at step k+\u03c4+1 (in finite number of time-steps).\n(ii) \u03c4ij(k) may change at different time-steps k and is heterogeneous for different links, i.e., it may differ for agents and on different links. The time-delays are upper-bounded by some \u03c4 .\n(iii) The transmitted packets over every link are time-stamped and every agent i knows the time tj at which agent j sent the information over the link (j, i), i.e., the delay \u03c4ij(k) is known.\n(iv) For a shared mutual link between i and j, we consider the same delay for both sides, i.e., \u03c4ij(k) = \u03c4ji(k).\n(v) At every time k, at least one packet is delivered over the network (possibly with some delay), i.e., at any time step k we have \u03c4ij(k) \u0338= 0 for at least one pair (i, j) (and subsequently \u03c4ji(k) \u0338= 0 due to (iv)).\nRemark 2. Assumption 3 is less restrictive than many existing literature in distributed sensor networks. To clarify, part (i) only implies no packet loss and data dropout over the network. Part (ii) generalizes the existing literature with fixed delays at all links [56] by considering general heterogeneous delays as in [62, 59]. In other words, the delays may differ at different links. Part (iii) is a typical assumption in consensus literature [56] and data transmission networks for example for clock synchronization [63]. Part (iv)\n14\nimplies that both agents i, j process their shared information simultaneously5. It can be relaxed for asymmetric delays \u03c4ij \u0338= \u03c4ji, by considering max{\u03c4ij, \u03c4ji} at both sides. This is to fulfil the feasibility condition (as discussed later in Section 6). Part (v) is only to ensure that at every time-step k (at least) two nodes update their states.\nEvery agent needs to record its previous information at the last \u03c4 timesteps to match them with the received information from agent j \u2208 Ni at the next-coming time-steps. Further, define Ik\u2212r,ij as the indicator function capturing the delay \u03c4ij(k) \u2264 \u03c4 on the link (j, i) as follows,\nIk,ij(r) = {\n1, if \u03c4ij(k) = r, 0, otherwise.\n(13)\nDefine the temp graph G\u03c4 (t) = {V , E\u03c4 (t)} as the temporary graph representing the neighbourhood of agents at time t (and time-step k) based on the delays \u03c4ij. At time kT \u2212 T < t \u2264 kT if agent i receives a (possibly delayed) packet from j, then (j, i) \u2208 E\u03c4 (t) for kT \u2264 t < kT + T , otherwise (j, i) /\u2208 E\u03c4 (t).\nRemark 3. For switching networks with B > 0 in Assumption 2(b), (\u03c4+1)T needs to be less than switching period of G(t). This implies that in case of losing a link (i, j) due to a change in G(t), (at least) one delayed packet from agent i reaches neighbouring agent j before the link (i, j) disappears. Therefore, for any (i, j) \u2208 E(t) we have (i, j) \u2208 E\u03c4 (t), and thus, \u22c3k1T+B t=k1T\nG\u03c4 (t) =\u22c3k1T+B t=k1T\nG(t). In case of larger \u03c4 , (if possible) uniform connectivity of G\u03c4B\u03c4 (t) over a time-window B\u03c4 > B might be considered in Assumption 2."

Following the auxiliary\n5The assumption that \u03c4ij , \u03c4ji are known to both agents i, j is well-justified in information-theoretic perspective. This follows from Assumption 3(iii) and the assumption that when the packet data leaves the buffer it reaches the receiver with a fixed delay [64]. One may also consider the upper-bound on these delays as a more conservative approach.\n15\nresults in the previous section, it is clear that any x\u2217 for which \u2202f \u2217i = \u2202f \u2217 j for all i, j must be invariant under the proposed dynamics. To account for nonlinearities, in general, two models can be considered: (i) the link-based nonlinearities associated with every link/edge, and (ii) the node-based nonlinearities associated with every agent/node. The proposed continuous-time dynamics are based on local information available at each agent i and received from its neighbours Ni.\nNode-based Nonlinear Solution: x\u0307i = \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208Ni Wijg ( \u2202fi \u2212 \u2202fj ) , (14)\nLink-based Nonlinear Solution: x\u0307i = \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208Ni Wij ( g(\u2202fi)\u2212 g(\u2202fj) ) , (15)\nwhere Wij and Ni are time-dependent in general (Assumption 2). In the rest of this paper, we discuss the properties of (14)-(15) as the solutions of problem (3). For the sake of notation simplicity, we drop the dependence of Wij, Ni, and \u2202fi on t unless where needed. For g(x) = x, (14) and (15) represent the classic linear solution given in [46, 6]. However, unlike [46] (and many other papers in the literature) W is not necessarily bi-stochastic but is only symmetric with positive entries.\nAs compared to many existing linear dynamics proposed in the literature [46, 65, 66, 67, 68, 33, 47, 4, 14, 6, 50] or ADMM-based solutions proposed in the literature [35, 36, 37, 40, 38, 39], this work addresses nonlinearity g(\u00b7) at the nodes or the links. This nonlinearity might be due to inherent property of the system, e.g., quantized information exchange among the nodes (see Section 8) or the RRLs in automatic-generation-control setup (see Section 7). In this aspect, the existing simplified linear solutions do not work properly and may result in an optimality gap. On the other hand, our nonlinear model allows for improving the convergence rate and finite/fixed-time convergence by adding sign-based functions as nonlinearity g(\u00b7). This cannot be addressed by the existing linear solutions [46, 65, 66, 67, 68, 33, 47, 4, 14, 6, 50] or dualbased solutions [35, 36, 37, 40, 38, 39].\nWe make the following assumption on the nonlinear mapping g(\u00b7).\nAssumption 4. Function g : R 7\u2192 R is a nonlinear odd mapping with dg dx \u0338= 0 at x = 0 and xg(x) > 0 for x \u0338= 0, i.e., g(x) is strongly sign-preserving.\n16\nFurther, there exists Kg, \u03b5 > 0 such that Kg|x| \u2265 |g(x)| \u2265 \u03b5|x|, referred to as the sector-bound conditions6.\nMany existing nonlinearities satisfy the above assumption. As an example, a monotonically increasing Lipschitz odd function g(\u00b7) satisfies the conditions in Assumption 4. Some other examples are discussed in the rest of this section.\nRemark 4. Even though Eq. (14) and (15) represent separate nonlinearities at the nodes and the links, the results of this work hold for their combination (with both node and link nonlinearities satisfying Assumption 4). An example is given in Section 8.\n3.2. Examples of Practical Nonlinearities in Applications\nIn this section, we provide some practical nonlinear functions g(\u00b7). First, define y := \u2202fi \u2212 \u2202fj and the odd function sgn\u03bd(y) as\nsgn\u03bd(y) := y|y|\u03bd\u22121, (16)\nwhere | \u00b7 | denotes the absolute value and \u03bd \u2265 0. For \u03bd = 0, (16) gives the well-known signum function denoted by sgn(y) for simplicity. The following applications distinguish this work from many existing literature.\nApplication I: Quantization\ngl(y) := sgn(y) exp(gu(log(|y|))), (17)\nwith gu(y) := \u03b4 [ y \u03b4 ] and \u03b4 > 0 as the quantization level. In order to allow quantized information processing at agents and transmission links [7], one can substitute logarithmic quantizer gl(\u00b7) into (14) and (15). Note that uniform quantizer gu(\u00b7) is not \u201cstrongly\u201d sign-preserving but it is sign-preserving7.\n6As we discuss later, the condition \u03b5|x| \u2264 |g(x)| is needed for exact convergence (signpreserving versus \u201cstrongly\u201d sign-preserving) and |g(x)| \u2264 Kg|x| is only needed for the DT case.\n7Such uniformly quantized dynamics may result in (steady-state) residual and bias from the equilibrium, where the bias (residual) scales with the quantization level \u03b4 and gets arbitrarily close to zero for sufficiently small \u03b4. See [69, 20, 21, 43] for some discussions on quantized discrete-time consensus.\n17\nApplication II: Saturation\ng\u03ba(y) := { \u03basgn(y) |y| > \u03ba, y |y| \u2264 \u03ba,\n(18)\nwith \u03ba > 0 as the saturation (clipping) level. To account for the limited range of sensors/actuators (saturation) and restriction on transfer of analog/digital signals (signal clipping) [24, 70], the nonlinear function g\u03ba(\u00b7) can be substituted in (14) and (15). This might be due to physical restrictions to follow the limited rate of increase or decrease in the actuation input x\u0307i. An example in power grid applications is given in Section 7.\nApplication III: Finite/Fixed-time Convergence\ngf (y) := sgn \u03bd1(y) + sgn\u03bd2(y), (19)\nwhere 0 < \u03bd1 < 1, 1 < \u03bd2 (fixed-time) or 0 < \u03bd2 < 1 (finite-time). Using this type of nonlinear optimization model some existing work on consensus and optimization [10, 25, 9, 18] show that convergence can be achieved in finite/fixed-time. One may even adopt time-varying \u03bd1, \u03bd2 as in consensus algorithms [71] to reach convergence over a prescribed time irrespective of the initialization and system parameters.\nApplication IV: Robustification\ngp(y) :=\n{ 1\u2212\u03f5 \u03f5d\nsgn(y) |y| > d 0 |y| \u2264 d\n(20)\nwith 0 < \u03f5 < 1, d > 0. In order to design protocols robust to high-intensity outliers, for example in case of communication channels corrupted with impulsive noise [28, 11], one can replace the sign-preserving function gp(\u00b7) in (15). A similar model can be considered to suppress impulsive actuation nonlinearities in (14). However, since Eq. (20) is only sign-preserving (not \u201cstrongly\u201d), it may result in steady-state bias from the optimizer, i.e., convergence ensures x to reach a neighbourhood of x\u2217.\nNote that the sign-based nonlinear functions in Applications III-IV are mostly used in CT. The applications of our proposed solutions are not limited to these nonlinear models, but any g(\u00b7) satisfying Assumption 4 might be adopted. For example, the composition of mentioned nonlinear mappings (17)-(20) are also a valid choice for g(\u00b7) in (14) and (15), or many other sector-bound nonlinearities which satisfy Assumption 4.\n18"

Initializing by any x0 \u2208 Sb, the state of agents remain feasible under the CT dynamics (14) and (15), i.e., x(t) \u2208 Sb for all t > 0.\nProof.

Therefore, any feasible initialization x\u22a40 1n = b gives feasibility over time x(t)\u22a41n = b and x(t) \u2208 Sb for all t > 0.\nIn contrast to primal-dual solutions such as ADMM-based methods [35, 36, 37, 40, 38, 39], Lemma 6 proves all-time feasibility of our proposed solution. This means that at any termination time of the algorithm the solution preserves feasibility while in the existing ADMM solutions [34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 38, 39] there might be feasibility gap that converges to zero asymptotically. This implies that the solution by [35, 36, 37, 40, 38, 39] must be fast enough to gain feasibility before the termination of the algorithm.\nNote that for any x satisfying \u2207F (x) = \u03c61n, we have x\u0307i = 0 at every agent i. Therefore, such x is an equilibrium (invariant-state) of the solution dynamics (14) and (15). In the next theorem, we show that such x\u2217 is unique for both proposed dynamics. Note that we assume x\u2217 satisfies the local box constraints (if there are any).\nTheorem 1 (Uniqueness in CT). Suppose that Assumptions 1, 2 and 4 hold. Let x\u2217 denote the equilibrium under CT dynamics (14) and (15). Then, \u2207F (x\u2217) = \u03c6\u22171n with \u03c6\u2217 \u2208 R.\n19\nProof. By contradiction assume \u2207F (x\u2217) = (\u039b\u22171; . . . ; \u039b\u2217n) where \u039b\u2217 \u0338= \u03c6\u2217 and for (at least) two agents i, j,\n\u039b\u2217i \u0338= \u039b\u2217j \u21d0\u21d2 \u2202f \u2217i \u0338= \u2202f \u2217j , (22)\nDefine two agents \u03b1, \u03b2 as,\n\u03b1 = argmax q\u2208{1,...,n} \u039b\u2217q, \u03b2 = argmin q\u2208{1,...,n} \u039b\u2217q. (23)\nFrom Assumption 2, the union graph GB(t) is connected for every t \u2265 0, and therefore, there is a path in GB(t) from agent (node) \u03b1 to every other agent (node) including \u03b2. In this path, one can find (at least) two nodes \u03b1 and \u03b2 with the set of neighbours N\u03b1 and N\u03b2, respectively, such that\n\u039b\u2217\u03b1 \u2265 \u039b\u2217N\u03b1 , \u039b \u2217 \u03b2 \u2264 \u039b\u2217N\u03b2 , (24)\nwhere the strict inequalities in the above hold for (at least) one node in N\u03b1 and one node in N\u03b2. Therefore, from Assumption 4, x\u0307\u2217\u03b1 < 0 and x\u0307\u2217\u03b2 > 0 over any time-window of length B (for both proposed dynamics). This contradicts our equilibrium assumption x\u0307\u2217 = 0.\nIn the virtue of Lemmas 4, 6, and Theorem 1, for a feasible initial state x0 \u2208 Sb there exist only one equlibrium x\u2217 satisfying \u2207F (x\u2217) = \u03c6\u22171n under dynamics (14) and (15). In order to prove convergence to x\u2217, the following lemma is needed.\nLemma 7.

The proof for dynamics (14) is given in the proof of [49, Theorem 2]. Similar proofs hold for dynamics (15) with Lyapunov function F (x) := F (x)\u2212F (x\u2217) and recalling from Lemma 7 that ( \u2202fi\u2212\u2202fj )( g(\u2202fi)\u2212g(\u2202fj) ) > 0.\nIt is worth mentioning that the existing literature [46, 65, 66, 67, 68, 47, 4, 14, 6, 50] mostly work over all-time connected networks, while, from Theorem 1 and 2, our proposed solution works over uniformly-connected networks that may lose connectivity over some time-intervals. Note that from Theorem 1 to prove unique equilibrium of the solution we only need the union network GB(t) to be connected over some interval B. This makes our solution applicable over mobile multi-agent systems where the network is dynamic and the connectivity might be lost temporarily. This is in contrast to many existing solutions [46, 65, 66, 67, 68, 47, 4, 14, 6, 50] where the network is static and/or all-time connected."

Note that proof of uniqueness is irrespective of the weights and only depends on the network connectivity. Similar reasoning proves feasibility in Lemma 6 and convergence for CT dynamics (15) over WB digraphs. Distributed (weight) balancing algorithms can be adopted to design such directed networks [72].\n5.1. Rate of Convergence\nNext, to determine the rate of convergence of the proposed (delay-free) protocols, we further make the following assumption.\nAssumption 5. For the local cost functions fi(xi) : R 7\u2192 R, \u2022 there exists u < \u221e such that \u22022fi(xi) < 2u. This implies that \u2202fi(xi) are Lipschitz continuous.\n\u2022 (Strong-convexity) there exists v > 0 such that \u22022fi(xi) > 2v.\nTo incorporate a non-smooth penalty term or barrier function f\u03c3i for the box constraints [49, 29], e.g., [u]+ = max{u, 0}\u03c3 for \u03c3 = 1, one can replace it with smooth equivalent L(u, \u00b5) = 1\n\u00b5 log(1 + exp(\u00b5u)). This is a\ntypical reformulation in machine learning literature [1, 73]. It is known that L(z, \u00b5) \u2212 max{z, 0} \u2264 1\n\u00b5 and the two functions can become arbitrar-\nily close by sufficiently large \u00b5 [73]. [u]+ with \u03c3 \u2265 2 is another alternative smooth option [74]. Assumption 5 helps to explicitly derive a sufficient bound on the sampling step to ensure convergence. Based on this assumption, we reformulate Lemma 2 as follows.\nLemma 8. Assume the function fi : R 7\u2192 R to be strongly convex and 2v < \u22022fi(xi) < 2u (Assumption 5). Then, for two feasible points x(k + 1),x(k) \u2208 Sb, and \u2206x =: x(k + 1)\u2212 x(k),\nF (x(k + 1)) > F (x(k)) +\u2207F\u22a41 \u2206x+ v\u2206x\u22a4\u2206x, (33) F (x(k + 1)) > F (x(k))\u2212 1 4v \u2207F\u22a41\u2207F 1, (34)\nand similarly,\nF (x(k + 1)) < F (x(k)) +\u2207F\u22a41 \u2206x+ u\u2206x\u22a4\u2206x, (35) F (x(k + 1)) < F (x(k))\u2212 1 4u \u2207F\u22a41\u2207F 1, (36)\n23\nwith gradient dispersion defined as \u2207F 1 := \u2207F (x(k + 1))\u2212 1n(1 \u22a4 n\u2207F (x(k + 1)))1n.\nProof. The proof follows from Lemma 2. See details in [6].\nCorollary 2. As a direct result of Lemma 8, substituting x2 = x \u2217 in (34) and (36), for any feasible x \u2208 Sb and F (k) := F (k)\u2212 F \u2217,\n1 4u \u2207F\u22a4\u2207F \u2264 F (x) \u2264 1 4v \u2207F\u22a4\u2207F . (37)\nThe above corollary follows from the strong convexity of F and holds for general allocation dynamics; for example, a similar statement is given for the linear solution in [6]. Using Assumption 5 and Lemma 8, one can find the limit on the convergence rate under the proposed CT and DT protocols (assuming no latency, i.e., \u03c4 = 0). Recall that, for the CT case, F\u0307 = \u2207F\u22a4x\u0307. In the following, we state the results for (14) and the solution for (15) similarly follows. Using the definition of Laplacian in (1), one can rewrite (14) (with some abuse of notation) as x\u0307 = \u2212Lg(\u2207F ). Substituting this for x\u0307 and from Assumption 4 and Corollary 1,\n\u2212Kg\u2207F\u22a4L\u2207F \u2264 F\u0307 (x) \u2264 \u2212\u03b5\u2207F\u22a4L\u2207F, (38)\nwhere we used the following inequalities from Assumptions 4,\n\u03b5|(\u2202fi(k))| < |g(\u2202fi(k))| < Kg|(\u2202fi(k))|, (39) \u03b5|Dij(k)| < |g(Dij(k))| < Kg|Dij(k)|. (40)\nFor now, assume B = 0 and later we extend it to B > 0. Using (10) with \u03bb2 described in Lemma 5 and recalling the notation \u2207F in Lemma 8, we have\n\u2212Kg\u03bbn\u2207F \u22a4\u2207F \u2264 F\u0307 \u2264 \u2212\u03b5\u03bb2\u2207F \u22a4\u2207F , (41)\nand from (37)\n\u22124uKg\u03bbnF (x) \u2264 F\u0307 \u2264 \u22124v\u03b5\u03bb2F (x), (42)\nwhich is consistent with the linear case (\u03b5 = Kg = 1) in [6]. Recall that for\nF = 0 we also have F\u0307 = 0. Next, for the DT case, following Eq. (35),\nF (k + 1) \u2264 F (k) +\u2207F (k)\u22a4\u2206x+ u\u2206x\u22a4\u2206x,\n24\nwith \u2206x := x(k + 1)\u2212 x(k). To satisfy F (k + 1) \u2264 F (k), we need,\n\u2207F (k)\u22a4\u2206x+ u\u2206x\u22a4\u2206x \u2264 0.\nFrom Assumption 4 and following a similar line of reasoning to get Eq. (42), the above is satisfied if,\n\u2212 \u03b5T\u03bb2\u2207F \u22a4\u2207F + uK2gT 2\u2207F \u22a4 L\u22a4L\u2207F \u2264 0,\nwhere we substituted \u2206x = L\u2207F = L\u2207F and used Lemma 5 and Corollary 1. From the same Lemma 5 we have\u2207F\u22a4L\u22a4L\u2207F \u2264 \u03bb2n\u2207F\n\u22a4\u2207F . Therefore, the sufficient condition for convergence is,\n(uK2gT\u03bb 2 n \u2212 \u03b5\u03bb2)\u2207F\n\u22a4\u2207F \u2264 0, (43)\nwhich gives the sufficient bound on T as,\nT \u2264 \u03b5\u03bb2 uK2g\u03bb 2 n =: T\u03bb. (44)\nThen, the upper bound on the convergence rate of the residual follows from Lemma 8 and (37) as,\nF (k + 1)\nF (k) \u2264 1 + 4v(uK2gT 2\u03bb2n \u2212 T\u03bb2\u03b5). (45)\nThe above gives an estimate on the (linear) convergence rate of F for sufficiently small T satisfying (44) and also proves the convergence in Theorem 3. For the quadratic cost functions (as in the economic dispatch problem), we have u = v, and the above equations can be more simplified. Further, in case of B-connectivity instead of all-time connectivity (B = 1), one can derive Eq. (45) for F (k+B) F (k)\nover union graph GB and modify (44) as TB \u2264 T\u03bb with \u03bb2, \u03bbn as the eigenvalues of GB.\nRemark 6. Recall that, from Lemma 5 for WB directed graphs, values \u03bb2, \u03bbn in (43) (and in the subsequent equations) denote the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix Ls instead of L.\n25"

Following Assumption 3, the knowledge of every \u03c4ij is key to satisfy the feasibility condition in the delayed case, see (31) and (32). Note that D(k\u2212r) and Dg(k\u2212r) (with r as the delay) needs to be anti-symmetric. This follows from Assumption 3 and Remark 2. In other words, every agent i knows the delay r to match the received g(\u2202fj(k\u2212 r)) with its own previous information g(\u2202fi(k \u2212 r)) to find Dgij(k \u2212 r), and the same holds for agent j to find Dgji(k \u2212 r).\n6.1. Case I: information-update over a longer time-scale\nA straightforward solution in the delayed case is to have the agents wait for \u03c4 steps (with \u03c4 as the maximum possible delay) until they collect (at least) one delayed packet from the neighbouring agents (before processing for the next iteration) and then update their state8. This alternative approach requires knowledge of \u03c4 (or an upper bound). Obviously, due to the agents\u2019 slower update rate, this approach\u2019s convergence rate is low. In this case, we define a new time-scale k = \u230ak\u22121\n\u03c4+1 \u230b + 1 (see Fig. 1) and update the state of\neach agent i as follows,\n8Similar solution to handle delays in consensus protocols is discussed in [59, Remark 3].\n26\nAlgorithm 1 Delay-Tolerant solution: longer time-scale\n1: Input: Wijs, Ni, fi(\u00b7), T , \u03c4 2: Initialization: Set k = k = 1, randomly allocate feasible x(1) (e.g., via\n[6, Algorithm 2]) 3: Node i shares \u2202fi(1) with neighbors j \u2208 Ni 4: While termination criteria NOT true do 5: Set k \u2190 k + 1 6: If k\u22121\n\u03c4+1 = k\n7: Node i calculates Dgij(k) (or Dij(k)) based on received data g(\u2202fj(k)) (or \u2202fj(k)) from j \u2208 Ni 8: Updates xi(k + 1) via Eq.

(47)\nOver this \u03c4 + 1 time-steps (i.e., two consecutive update steps k1 and k2) on every link (i, j), every agent sends 1 message at step k and receives the messages from j \u2208 Ni by step k + 19, see Algorithm 1. This is used in the proof of convergence.\nTheorem 4 (Feasibility/Uniqueness/Convergence). Under Assumptions 1-4 and initializing from a feasible point x0 \u2208 Sb, protocols (46) and (47) converge to the feasible unique equilibrium point x\u2217 in the form \u2207F (x\u2217) = \u03c6\u2217\u22971n for sufficiently small T satisfying T < T\u03bb (with T\u03bb given as (44)).\nProof. The proof of feasibility and uniqueness follows a similar procedure as in the proof of Theorem 3 considering the longer time-scale k. Since\n9In an equivalent setup, agents may send their messages per scale k where, at the update scale k, receive at least 1 and at most \u03c4 messages. Then, the step size T needs to be down-scaled accordingly to satisfy the convergence criteria.\n27\nat every update step k only 1 message is received from every agent in Ni, following similar expressions to derive Eq. (44), the same criteria T\u03bb ensures convergence.\n6.2. Case II: using all delayed data at the same time-scale\nIn the most general time-delayed version of the DT protocols (25) and (26), agent i updates its state based on all available (received) information as,\nxi(k+1) = xi(k)\n\u2212 T \u2211 j\u2208Ni \u03c4\u2211 r=0 Wijg(Dij(k \u2212 r))Ik\u2212r,ij(r), (48)\nxi(k+1) = xi(k).\n\u2212 T \u2211 j\u2208Ni \u03c4\u2211 r=0 WijDgij(k \u2212 r)Ik\u2212r,ij(r), (49)\nNote that in (48), Dij(k \u2212 r) can be easily calculated as agent i records all its gradients \u2202fi(k) at the last \u03c4 steps and knows the time delay r of the received time-stamped message \u2202fj(k \u2212 r). In fact, the second \u2211 sums all the gradient differences based on all received data from Ni at step k, i.e., for all pairs of Dij(s) and s satisfying10,\n{k \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 s \u2264 k, s+ \u03c4ij(s) = k, j \u2208 Ni}. (50)\nor equivalently,\n{Ik\u2212s,ij = s, j \u2208 Ni}. (51)\nSimilar arguments hold for Dgij(k \u2212 r). Further, for Lipschitz g(\u00b7) with constant Kg < \u221e (and smooth fi(\u00b7)), from Definition 1, we have Dgij(k \u2212 r) \u2264 KgDij(k \u2212 r).\n10Recall that the processed information at the time-step k are received in the time-period (kT \u2212 T, T ]. Therefore, (51) can be rewritten as {k\u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 s \u2264 k, kT \u2212 T < sT + \u03c4ij(s)T \u2264 kT, j \u2208 Ni} in the asynchronous case, for example, the delays could be positive real values (instead of integers).\n28\nAlgorithm 2 Delay-Tolerant solution: the same time-scale\n1: Input: Wijs, Ni, fi(\u00b7), T , \u03c4 2: Initialization: Set k = 1, randomly allocate feasible x(1) (e.g., via [6,\nAlgorithm 2]) 3: While termination criteria NOT true do 4: Node i receives time-stamped g(\u2202fj(k \u2212 \u03c4 ij)) (resp. \u2202fj(k \u2212 \u03c4 ij))) from j \u2208 Ni 5: Records Dgij(k \u2212 \u03c4 ij) (resp. Dij(k \u2212 \u03c4 ij)) based on known delay \u03c4 ij 6: Updates xi(k + 1) via Eq. (49) (resp. (48)) 7: Shares \u2202fj(k + 1) with neighbors j \u2208 Ni 8: Sets k \u2190 k + 1 9: End While\n10: Output: x\u2217i , F (x \u2217) = \u2211n i=1 fi(x \u2217 i )\nRemark 8. Following Remark 3, for switching network G(k), the switching period needs to be longer than (\u03c4+1)T (or \u03c4+1 time-steps). This assumption implies that agent i receives at least one (possibly) delayed packet from every neighbour in Ni before losing its link due to network variation (ensuring Assumption 3(v)). Therefore, following the B-connectivity in Assumption 2, we need (\u03c4 + 1)T < B.\nNote that for the update at every step k, Assumption 3(v) says that at least one package over the network is delivered. Otherwise, xi(k) = xi(k\u22121) for all i and no update occurs. The solution is summarized in Algorithm 2. The feasibility/uniqueness under (48) and (49) follows similar to the delayfree case.\nLemma 9 (Feasibility/Uniqueness). Let Assumptions 1-4 hold. Initializing from feasible states x0 \u2208 Sb, under DT protocols (48) and (49), x(k) \u2208 Sb. Further, the unique equilibrium point x\u2217 satisfies \u2207F (x\u2217) = \u03c6\u22171n.\n29\nProof. Following (48) and (49), we get\nn\u2211 i=1 xi(k + 1) = n\u2211 i=1 xi(k)\n\u2212 n\u2211\ni=1 T \u2211 j\u2208Ni \u03c4\u2211 r=0 Wijg(Dij(k \u2212 r))Ik\u2212r,ij(r). (52)\nn\u2211 i=1 xi(k + 1) = n\u2211 i=1 xi(k)\n\u2212 n\u2211\ni=1 T \u2211 j\u2208Ni \u03c4\u2211 r=0 WijDgij(k \u2212 r)Ik\u2212r,ij(r). (53)\nFor any link (i, j) and (j, i) in G(k), from Assumptions 2, 3, and 4 we have Wij = Wji, Dgij(k \u2212 r) = \u2212D g ji(k \u2212 r), g(Dij(k \u2212 r)) = \u2212g(Dji(k \u2212 r)), and Ik\u2212r,ij(r) = Ik\u2212r,ji(r) for 0 \u2264 r \u2264 \u03c4 . This implies that,\nn\u2211 i=1 T \u2211 j\u2208Ni \u03c4\u2211 r=0 Wijg(Dij(k \u2212 r))Ik\u2212r,ij(r) = 0,\nn\u2211 i=1 T \u2211 j\u2208Ni \u03c4\u2211 r=0 WijDgij(k \u2212 r)Ik\u2212r,ij(r) = 0,\nand therefore, \u2211n i=1 xi(k + 1) = \u2211n\ni=1 xi(k) for all k \u2265 1. Therefore, initializing from x0 \u2208 Sb we have x(k) \u2208 Sb under both (48) and (49). This proves the feasibility. The proof of uniqueness follows similar reasoning as in the proof of Theorem 3 and 4 over the uniformly connected network GB(t) (or G\u03c4B\u03c4 (t) in Remark 3).\nRemark 9. Case I is more practical than Case II in applications with low capacity/buffer at the computing nodes. This is because at time k = k node i sends (and receives) one message to (and from) the nodes Ni. Note that, for large delays (and the same T ), this solution converges (although with a low rate) while Case II may not necessarily converge. Further, for unknown (or large) \u03c4 , Case II requires a high-capacity memory/buffer at the nodes to record the previous information (on the gradients). In case of limited (mslot) memory/buffer, the nodes may record and use a portion (last m) of the previous states instead, and discard the rest before k \u2212m (since they are\n30\ntime-stamped). This simply implies losing some links over G\u03c4 B 11 and follows from Remark 1 and 3 and Assumption 2.\nTheorem 5 (Sufficiency). Under Assumptions 1-4, and initializing from feasible state x0 \u2208 Sb, the proposed protocols (48)-(49) converge to the optimal solution of (3) for T (\u03c4 + 1) < T\u03bb.\nProof. First, consider homogeneous delays \u03c4ij = \u03c4 , where agents\u2019 states at any time-step k get updated next at k+\u03c4+1 and every \u03c4+1 steps afterwards (see Fig. 1). For this case, following Theorem (3), T < T\u03bb ensures the convergence. For general heterogeneous time-varying delays, \u2206x needs to be scaled by \u03c4 + 1, and accordingly, T\u03bb is down-scaled by \u03c4 + 1 to guarantee convergence. Consider two cases: (i) for time-invariant delays \u2211\u03c4 r=0 Ik\u2212r,ij(r) = 1 in (48), implying that only one delayed packet is received from every j \u2208 Ni. This implies the same bound as T < T\u03bb. For time-varying delays, from (13), 0 < \u2211\u03c4 r=0 Ik\u2212r,ij(r) \u2264 (\u03c4+1). This implies that \u2206x is scaled by \u03c4+1 and accordingly, from (29), T needs to be down-scaled by \u03c4 +1, i.e., T (\u03c4 +1) < T\u03bb. The proof for dynamics (49) similarly follows.\nFor time-varying but equi-probable delays r = 0, 1, . . . , \u03c4 in (13), one can claim that (in average) over \u03c4 + 1 trials node i receives one message from j \u2208 Ni (at every k) and the bound is T < T\u03bb.\nCommunication time-delay over the network is not addressed by the existing solutions [46, 65, 66, 67, 68, 33, 47, 4, 14, 6, 50]. However, latency is a common issue in many multi-agent systems including the distributed resource allocation setup. Therefore, most existing works in the literature may not work properly in the presence of time-delays in the data-transmission network. The mentioned literature may lose resource-demand feasibility and/or result in some optimality gap in the presence of time-delays. In this aspect, our proposed delay-tolerant model advances the state-of-the-art and provides solutions that can be implemented in practice."

            "text": "In this section, we consider resource allocation over the power generation networks and the smart grid, known as the economic dispatch problem\n11Convergence over lossy networks, following from Assumption 2 and remark 1, is another promising direction of our future research.\n31\n(EDP) [75, 26, 6]. The objective is to allocate optimal power outputs to the electricity generators to supply the load demand D (in MW) and to minimize the operating costs. In [76, 4, 26, 47, 41] this cost function is given as,\nF (x) = n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b3ix 2 i + \u03b2ixi + \u03b1i, n\u2211 i=1 xi = D,mi \u2264 xi \u2264Mi, (54)\nwhere xi \u2208 R is the output power at generator i. To include the box constraints, penalty terms are considered [49]. The parameters in the cost function (54) are defined based on the type of the power generators (coal-fired, oil-fired, nuclear, etc.), for example, see Table 2. The other parameter values are: \u03b1i = 0 and mi = 20. The min and max RRL values given in [77] are equal to 1 and 3 MW/min (for oil/coal-type generators).\nIn a more complicated setup, such a quadratic cost model is defined to adjust the power-demand mismatch over the grid (e.g., due to generator outage), known as the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) problem [49]. Given a known power mismatch, the idea is to allocate enough power to the generators to compensate for it while minimizing the power deviation cost. In this setup, the generators are subject to an extra physical constraint, known as ramp-rate-limit (RRL). This implies that the rate of increase or decrease of the produced power is constrained within certain limits and the generators cannot freely speed up/down their power generation. Such nonlinear constraints are a determining factor on the stability of the grid [42]. The solutions of the existing linear methods [46, 65, 6] may assign any rate of change x\u0307i to the power generators. Thus, they cannot address RRLs, which, in reality, the solutions cannot be followed by the generators. This may fail the feasibility and lead to sub-optimality. In contrast, considering the nonlinearity g(\u00b7) as saturation function (18), the proposed nonlinear solutions in\n32\nthis work can address RRL constraints where the limits can be tuned by the parameter \u03ba. A comparing example is given next.\n7.1. Allocation with No Delay\nAssume n = 50 generators with the supply-demand constraint D = 3200 MW . Initially, it is considered that xi = D n\n= 64 MW at every generator i. The parameters in (54) are randomly set from Table 2 using MATLAB randi function. For power allocation, as an academic example, we consider protocol (25) with saturated nonlinearity g\u03ba(\u00b7) with level \u03ba = 160 on the node dynamics and protocol (26) with gf (\u00b7) as the sign-based function (19) (with \u03bd1 = 0.4, \u03bd2 = 1.6) on the links. The network is considered as a random Erdos-Renyi graph (with link probability p = 0.2) with random symmetric link weights 0.005 \u2264 Wij \u2264 0.025. We provide a comparative simulation analysis to support our results. Both solutions are compared with some state-of-the-art solutions in the literature in Fig. 2 for T = 1; namely: linear [46], accelerated linear [66], finite-time [26], and single-bit [25] solutions. For the single-bit protocol [25] we decreased the link weights by 80% to reduce the chattering effect in Fig. 3. Note that the RRL constraint is only met by our saturated solution as shown in Fig. 3. In other words, in a real scenario the generators cannot follow the iterative solution by [46, 66, 26, 25] since their power generation rates at some intervals violate the RRLs. This may either cause feasibility gap or optimality gap in real world. But our saturated-based solution admits the RRLs. The min RRL value equal to 1 MW/min (or 1\n60 MW/sec) is considered that meets the requirement by all\nthe generators12. Box constraints mi \u2264 xi \u2264Mi on the generators are considered by adding smooth penalty terms with \u03c3 = 2. We modify the objective as f\u03c3i = fi(xi)+ c([xi \u2212Mi]+)2 + c([mi \u2212 xi]+)2 with c = 1. The evolution of power states under the sign-based dynamics is shown in Fig. 4, where both feasibility and power limit constraints are met. Note that our given assumptions ensure that at every time step the deviated power at nodes on two sides of every link is balanced such that the feasibility constraint is satisfied (i.e., the generated power equals the demand) at all times.\n12Even though we used the same min RRL in this simulation, this parameter can be further tuned for different generators in dynamics (14)-(15) via the link weights and the node degrees.\n33\n34\n35\nTo compare the computational complexity of the algorithms, the elapsed times (for one iteration) are given in Table 3. The simulation is done with MATLAB R2021b Intel Core i5 @ 2.4GHz processor RAM 8GB.\nIn Table 4, we compared the number of iterations to reach (a predefined) cost residual F = 1. For example, within this range around the optimal value the solution is considered good enough. Note that our proposed sign-based solution, as compared to other solutions, although having more computational complexity converges very fast and within fewer number of iterations.\nNext, we study the network density on the number of iterations to reach a certain residual (as the termination criteria of the algorithm). In Fig. 5, this termination point is F = 0.01 and the ER link probability is changed from 15% to 45%. The link weights Wij are chosen randomly in the range [0.02 0.12]. The simulation is averaged over 5 Monte-Carlo (MC) trials with T = 0.05.\n36\nThe convergence time/iterations to reach F = 10\u22122 versus network size n is shown in Fig. 6. The parameters are as follows: p = 30% as the ER link probability, Wij \u2208 [0.05 0.2], and 5 MC trials. Two different scenarios are considered for T : diminishing by size as T = 0.05(1 \u2212 n\u221220\n100 ) and fixed step\nsize T = 0.025. In Fig. 7, for the same termination criteria F = 10\u22122, the number of iterations for different step sizes T and link densities p are given. As we see in the figure, the convergence iteration multiplied by the step size is almost constant irrespective of the network connectivity (and eigen-spectrum) and the step size T . Note that the T values are chosen small enough for convergence, and for large values of T violating Eq. (44) the solution may not necessarily converge.\n7.2. Allocation with Delayed Information-Exchange\nNext, we consider a cyclic network of n = 5 generators under RRL limits \u03ba = 1\n60 MW/sec in the presence of time delays. The data in Table 2 is used\nwhich resembles IEEE 14-Bus test system [41]. The time-evolution of the generated powers and the Lyapunov function F (the residual) are simulated for random parameters. For the quadratic cost (54), u = max{\u03b3i} = 0.04. We have \u03b5 = 0.0166, Kg = 1, \u03bb2 = 1.38, T = 1 and \u03bbn = 3.61. Using Eq. (44), for any T < 0.045 the solution converges in the absence of delays.\n37\nThis is a sufficient bound and to some extent not very tight. Case I: In this case, using (47), we update the generator states at every \u03c4 steps as in Section 6.1. Following Remark 9, we consider information exchange over the longer time-scale k. The time-evolution of the Lyapunov function F (representing the residual) for some values of \u03c4 is given in Fig. 8. Clearly, the convergence rate decreases with the increase in the time delays.\nCase II: In this case, we update the generator states at every step based on all the received (delayed and non-delayed) information using (49) in Section 6.2. From Theorem 5, sufficient condition for convergence is T (\u03c4+1) < 0.045. For this simulation, however, we see that solution converges \u03c4 \u2264 3. We perform the simulation for both heterogeneous time-varying and time-invariant (fixed) delays as shown in Fig. 9.\n38\n39"

The network is not connected at any time, while it is B-connected over every B = 100 iterations (Assumption 2), i.e., \u22c3k+100 k G(k) is connected. We consider strongly-convex logarithmic functions fi(\u00b7) defined as [46],\nfi(xi) = 1\n2 \u03b1i(xi \u2212 \u03b3i)2 + \u03b6 log(1 + exp(\u03b2i(xi \u2212 \u03b7i))), (55)\nwith the coefficients randomly chosen as 0 < \u03b1i < 0.2, \u22120.2 < \u03b2i < 0.2, \u22120.3 < \u03b3i < 0.3, 0 < \u03b7i < 0.6, \u03b6 = 0.2, and random constraint parameters in problem (2) chosen as \u22122 < ai < 2 and b = 10. To optimize this objective we apply (26) (with T = 0.1) under logarithmic quantization gl(\u00b7) in Eq. (17). This locally Lipschitz function satisfies ( 1 \u2212 \u03b4\n2\n) z \u2264 gl(z)\nz \u2264\n( 1 + \u03b4\n2\n) z\nand, thus, Assumption 4 holds. We considered a composition of dynam-\nics (25)-(26) via g\u03ba ( gl(\u2202fi) \u2212 gl(\u2202fj) ) with \u03ba = 1. The time-evolution of\nthe residual F for different quantization levels \u03b4 is given in Fig. 10. We further compare the performance under different time-delay models by assigning random heterogeneous delays to the links. For Case II, two scenarios are given (i) time-varying, and (ii) time-invariant (fixed) delays. For Case I, from Remark 9, we consider updating over time-scale k using composition of dynamics (46)-(47). Simulations are shown in Fig. 11 with parameters: \u03b4 = 0.125, T = 0.05, \u03c4 = 2, 6. As shown in Fig. 11, the solution by Case II does not necessarily converge while the solution by Case I converges. This simulation shows that for small \u03c4 (satisfying Theorem 5) Case II leads to faster convergence. On the other hand, for larger \u03c4 Case I is a better delaytolerant mechanism.\nNote that the notion of information quantization and time-delays although prevalent in real-world networked systems cannot be addressed by the existing primal-based [46, 65, 66, 67, 68, 33, 47, 4, 14, 6, 50] and dual-based solutions [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. In other words, these existing literature assume ideal network condition and there is no guarantee that their solution converge under quantized information and/or data transmission delays.\n40"

            "text": "This paper proposes anytime-feasible (Laplacian-gradient) solutions subject to model nonlinearities to solve distributed sum-preserving resource allocation and coupling-constraint optimization over uniformly-connected networks (not necessarily connected at all times). The convergence to the optimal value is proved for general strongly sign-preserving nonlinearities. In addition, two scenarios are proposed to overcome heterogeneous delays over the network. For large delays and low buffers, we proposed to update the agents\u2019 states over a longer time scale after receiving (at least) 1 delayed packet over every link. On the other hand, faster convergence can be achieved, for smaller time delays, by updating at the same time scale of the communication and using all the received (possibly) delayed packets at each iteration. The results are given for undirected and balanced graphs with bounded and link-symmetric delays.\nAllocation strategies over lossy networks with link failure or packet drop are another direction of our current research. As future research directions, application to asynchronous scheduling under quantized dynamics [78], robust (and noise-resilient) sign-based [28, 11], or single-bit [25] dynamics are of interest. Recall that for non \u201cstrongly\u201d sign-preserving solutions, the \u03b5accuracy needs to be addressed to give an estimate of the optimality gap. Another future research direction is to extend the results to non-convex problems, which is a bottleneck and more interesting for the industry.\n41\n42"
