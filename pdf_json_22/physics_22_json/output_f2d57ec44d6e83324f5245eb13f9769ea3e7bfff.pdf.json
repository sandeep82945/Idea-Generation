Introduction The dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has been widely explored due to its low cost, flexibility, environment friendliness, simple fabrication process and suitability for outdoor as well as indoor applications[1-2]. DSSC can be implemented as a promising photovoltaic (PV) in indoor application [3-4]. The PV conversion efficiency of the DSSC primarily depends on the working electrode parameters. Photons harnessing efficacy of photoanodes are influenced by (i) surface area (ii) photons scattering capacity and (iii) molar absorption coefficient, in the region of absorption of the sensitizer [5-8].Once the photons are harvested, the converted electrons should be separated and transported effectively. To achieve this, the charge transport and interfacial charge transfer resistance should be minimized which are primarily depended on the structural design and porosity of TiO2 [9]. In addition the efficiency can be further enhanced if the spectral absorption can be increased by co-sensitization and broadening of the light response of sensitizer in the visible and infrared (IR) regions with high molar extinction coefficient [10]. Most commonly used high performance standard sensitizers (N719, N749, N3) demonstrate the spectral response in the region of 300-700nm [11].Unfortunately, these standard sensitizers are inefficient in capturing the higher wavelengths of the solar spectrum above 700nm. Utilization of solar energy in longer wavelength region is a challenging task, but can be achieved by using the outstanding optical and electrical properties of metal nanoparticles [12-13]. Silver (Ag) and gold (Au) as well as copper (Cu) and Aluminium (Al) have attracted attention to increase the molar absorption coefficient of sensitizer [14-18]. Furthermore, these metal nanoparticles are also acting as co-sensitizers by trapping the photons in the window region of the sensitizers [19]. This optical trapping over the electromagnetic spectrum regime (visible, IR) is viable by varying shapes and sizes of metal nanoparticles [20-21]. In addition to the optical trapping at the resonance wavelength, interband, intraband transition, and the radiative transfer from the metals nanoparticles in the form of photons or the hot electrons of metal nanoparticles are also observed to improve the efficiency [22-23]. The open circuit voltage (Voc) is an another important contributing factor to improve the energy conversion efficiency of DSSC. In general, the DSSC Voc depends on the Fermi level of TiO2 relative to the redox potential of the electrolyte [24-25]. The incorporation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) in the TiO2 host shift the Fermi level position of TiO2 towards more negative potential, which results in an increase in the Voc[26-27]. There are many earlier reports utilising AgNPs surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to improve the photon to electron conversion efficiency of DSSC devices; however, most of the earlier reports used single shaped AgNPs as seen in Table.1.\nTable.1. Summary of literature using silver plasmonic NPs on DSSC performance.\nPassivation layer\nMethod of incorporation of AgNPs in photoanode\nReference PCE (%) Plasmonic enhanced (%) Percentage Enhancement and source\nP25 AgNPs mixed with P25 to form apaste 2.83% 3.62% 28% [28]\nTiO2 paste solaronix AgNPs mixed with TiO2 paste 2.81% 3.84% 37% [29]\nTiO2 Drop casting of AgNPs on TiO2photoanode 7.1% 8.9% 25%[30]\nTiO2 AgNPs mixed with TiO2 paste 3.1% 4.4% 42%[31]\nTiO2 AgNPs mixed with TiO2 paste 1.42% 1.83% 28.87%[32]\nP25 AgNPs mixed with TiO2 paste 3.79% 5.06% 33.5%[33]\nTiO2 P25 TiO2 photoanode immersedinto AgNPs solution 2.75% 5.66% 106%[34]\nTiO2\nDipping of TiO2 photoanode into0.1 M AgNO3 aqueous\nsolution, followed by radiating ultra-violet .\n1.39% 2.03% 46%[35]\nSingle shaped nanoparticles such as sphere or rods have their own limitations because they have SPR band maxima with definite full width at half maximum in the small region of visible part of the spectrum [36-37]. In addition, matching the SPR band of single shaped AgNPs with the chosen sensitizer\u2019s optical absorption region is another critical task. Thus, recently research has turned towards to the multishaped AgNPs because they exhibit a broad SPR band at multiple wavelengths in the visible region and IR region of the solar spectrum [38]. Song et al., prepared multishaped AgNPs and applied them to DSSC to improve the photon to electron conversion efficiency. These multishaped AgNPs were incorporated using a layer by layer concept, and the composite film structure with mesoporous TiO2, exhibited efficiency improvement from 8.44% to 8.91% and 8.58% to 9.00% respectively which exhibits 5.5% and 4.9% more enhancement with respect to the DSSC without AgNPs [39]. The multishaped AgNPs were obtained using a chemical reduction method and tuned the wavelength region from 300-1000nm. In addition 60% enhancement in the light harvesting efficiency of the dye and 30% improvement in the power conversion efficiency of DSSC devices were achieved by Joshi et.al., [38]. In this study the multishaped Ag nanoparticles coupled plasmonic effect is applied to both increase the short circuit current (Jsc) and open circuit voltage. A simple synthesis route is described to obtain four different combinations of multishaped AgNPs which is targeted to turn their extinction cross section and cover the entire visible region of electromagnetic spectrum up to 1100nm. The impact of each multishaped AgNPs combination is studied to determine which aspects to improve the power conversion efficiency of DSSC were impacted. A detailed investigation was made of both the TiO2 (XRD) and AgNPs (UV-Vis spectrometry) to couple the impacts on the DSSC (I-V) with the combination of the morphologies (TEM and FESEM) of AgNPs. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations were performed for the unique shaped Ag nanoparticles and the combined multishaped Ag nanoparticles to study the contribution of local enhancement and to understand the plasmonic cooperation effects. Finally, the results of the DSSC devices are discussed in the context to PV applications. Materials and methods Materials used\nSilver nitrate, sodium borohydride, trisodium citrate, hydrogen peroxide ethanol, and double distilled water were used for synthesis of multishaped Ag nanoparticles without further purification. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO, sigma Aldrich di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2,2\u2032bipyridyl4,4\u2032dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) (N719,Sigma Aldrich) chloroplatinic acid solution 8 wt. % in H2O (Sigma Aldrich),4-tert-butylpyridine, iodide (I2), and lithium iodide (LiI) were used in the DSSC fabrication process. Synthesis multishaped Ag nanoparticles The simple chemical reduction method was adopted for synthesis of multishaped Ag nanoparticles. First, 0.09mM AgNO3 was added into 50 mL double distilled water under stirring and it is heated at 70\u00b0C for 10mins. Subsequently, 1.7mM trisodium citrate and 0.2mL of hydrogen peroxide was injected into the above mixer and stirred for 5mins. After 5mins, freshly prepared 0.5mM, 0.75mM and 1mM of NaBH4 was added into each mixer, which undergoes a colour change into light blue, pink and orange, which confirms the formation of AgNPs. To get Ag-blue NPs the 0.5mM NaBH4 procedure was repeated and the temperature was maintained for another half an hour. Preparation of photoanode The steps to prepare the photoanode are shown in Fig.1. The detailed synthesis process of dual morphology TiO2 consist of solid microspheres with nanoparticles were described in our previous work [40]. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) was cut into small rectangular pieces of 2 X 2cm2 and then ultrasonically cleaned with triton-X, distilled water and acetone, respectively. Cleaned FTO substrates were immersed into 90mM TiCl4 solution at 70\u00b0C for 30mins followed by annealing at 450\u00b0C for 30mins. TiO2 paste was prepared according to our previous work [41].The prepared TiO2 paste was printed on pre-treated FTO substrate by screen printing method with an active area of the device 0.25cm2. The coated TiO2 films were annealed at 450\u00b0C for 30mins. For the fabrication of plasmonics photoanodes, multishaped Ag nanoparticles were loaded on TiO2 photoanode using the drop casting method. The prepared TiO2 and plasmonics photoanodes were post treated with 90mM TiCl4 solutions at 70\u00b0C for 30mins, followed by annealing at 450\u00b0C for 30mins. Finally, the prepared electrodes were immersed into 0.5mM of N719 in anhydrous solution for 16 h in a dark ambient condition. The standard platinum counter electrode were prepared by drop casting of chloroplatinic acid solution in 2-propanol subsequently heated at 450\u00b0C for 30mins. The dye sensitized photoanodes and Pt counter electrodes were assembled using binder clips. The spaces between the electrodes were filled with iodine and lithium iodide based liquid electrolyte.\nFig.1.Schematic representation of stepwise preparation of plasmonic photoanode with multishaped AgNPs incorporated with N719 dye."

Morphology of the prepared TiO2 materials were analysed using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, TESCAN MIRA 3).The extinction cross section properties of silver nanoparticles were examined using a UV-Vis spectrometer (JASCO V670 Japan). The size and shape of the synthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by TEM analysis (TEM, FEI-TECNAI T20 G2). Photocurrent-voltage measurements of DSSCs were carried out using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun illumination (AM 1.5). The photovoltaic conversion efficiency (\u019e) was calculated according to the following equations.\nFF= Jmax\u00d7V max J sc\u00d7V oc\n\u0220 (%) = J sc\u00d7V oc P \u00bf \u00d7FF \u00d7 100\nSimulation background In order to obtain more insight in to local field enhancements as a function of the wavelength, the AgNPs were simulated using the FDTD algorithm as implemented in Lumerical.\nResults and discussion The normalized absorbance spectra of all the obtained multishaped Ag nanoparticles including pure N719 sensitizer are shown in Fig.2.Experimental absorbance spectrum shows N719 sensitizer has dual absorption maximum at 388 nm, and 532 nm. Each AgNPs exhibits its extinction cross section maximum at visible and near IR regions due to the free electron gas oscillation within the confined small volume displaced relative to the corresponding ion\ncore. Hence the restoring force by the column interactions due to the induced polarization is in resonance with the particular wavelength of excited electromagnetic waves [42]. All the synthesised samples exhibited plasmonic resonance bands maxima from 334nm-716nm. The origin of single, dual plasmonic band, tuning in the plasmon band position and the observed FWHW can be related to AgNPs shape, size, size distribution, inter/intra band transition and the effect of its microenvironment [43]. Ag-Light blue NPs exhibits two distinct plasmonic resonance bands, which are well resolved and equal in intense with definite full width at half maximum (FWHM). The higher energy plasmonics band appeared at 391nm with FWHM of 41nm is due to the combined contribution of spheres and transverse surface plasmon mode of rod shaped AgNPs [44-46]. The lower energy plasmon resonance peak at 617nm is due to the longitudinal plasmon mode of Ag nanorods [47-48].\nThe SPR band appears at 450nm with FWHM of 148nm due to the presence of spherical and oval shaped nanoparticles in the Ag orange. The SPR band appears at 513nm in Ag pink sol is due to the oval/triangle shaped AgNPs [38]. Initially, 0.5mM NaBH4 concentration favour the formation of spheres, rods and triangles. The increase of NaBH4 concentration to 0.75mM and 1mM completely limits the formation of rods, but it serves as an ideal medium for the formation oval and triangle shaped AgNPs. When the time is prolonged for another half an hour at 0.5mM NaBH4 concentration at the same temperature, plasmonic resonance maximum appeared at 716nm in Ag-Blue which is 99nm red shifted with respect to the lower energy plasmon band of Ag-Light blue particles. All the obtained plasmonic band positions and the corresponding shapes of the nanoparticles are shown in Table.2.\nTable.2. The consolidated plasmonic band position and the contributed shapes Sample colour\nConcentratio n of NaBH4 (mM)\nPlasmoni c band\nposition (\u03bb1)\nPlasmonic band\nposition (\u03bb2)\nPlasmoni c band\nposition (\u03bb3)\nContributed Shapes\nAg-Light blue\n0.5 334nm 391nm 617nm Spheres, rods and triangles\nAg-Pink 0.75 340nm 513nm - Oval and triangles\nAgOrange\n1 340nm 450nm - Oval and spheres\nAg-Blue 0.5 (prolonged reaction time with temperature ) 332nm 426nm 716nm Rods, triangles and spheres\nThe multishapes and sizes exhibited by the synthesized samples are grouped in TEM images in Fig 3. It can be seen that Ag- Light blue comprises collective contribution of spheres, rods and triangles. It consists of greater densities of spheres, which are almost uniform in size with a diameter of about 10nm. The triangles and rods are clearly seen with curved vertices. When increasing the concentration of NaBH4 to obtain Ag-Pink NPs, rod shaped nanoparticles are transformed into oval shapes, in addition with triangles. When further increasing the NaBH4 concentration to 1mM, further reduction in the oval shapes takes place, yielded major contribution of spheres with the diameters in the ranges of 10-16nm. Major proportions of rods were noted with increase in the length as compare to AgLight blue NPs and small amount of triangles and spheres are also noted from TEM images of Ag-Blue NPs. The increase in length to width (increase in aspect ratio) of the rods and the noticed aggregation might be reason for the bathochromic shift as detailed in UV-Vis spectrum [49]. The diffraction spots in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern indicates that the crystalline nature of synthesized multishaped AgNPs.\nFig.3.TEM micrographs at different magnification for different multishaped AgNPs and corresponding SAED patterns. (a-c)Ag-Light blue (d-f) Ag-pink (g-i)Ag-Orange\n(j-l) Ag blue. Fig.4. shows an elemental mapping analysis of Ag-Light blue nanoparticles decorated screen printed TiO2 active layer. The mapping analysis confirms that Ag nanoparticles are hierarchically distributed in the TiO2 matrix.\nFig.4 (a-d) EDAX mapping of TiO2 -Ag Light blue active layer. Inset shows the selected area for elemental scanning.\nHRTEM images of the TiO2-Ag-light blue are presented in Fig.5. The TEM micrographs indicate that the Ag nanoparticles are well scattered on the TiO2 passivation layer. The corresponding SAED pattern indicates the crystallinity of prepared TiO2 material.\nFig.5 (a-c) HRTEM images of TiO2 -Ag-Light blue. (d) SAED pattern of TiO2 -Ag-Light blue.\nFig.6. shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of pure TiO2 and TiO2-Ag- Light blue on the FTO substrate. The prepared TiO2 photoanode exhibits tetragonal structure of the anatase phase. Crystallographic diffraction pattern of Ag is not observed in Ag/TiO2 thin films due to the low concentration of Ag.\nFig.6 . XRD Patterns of bare TiO2 and TiO2-Ag-Light blue thin films. F-represents the\ndiffraction peaks originated from FTO glass substrate. Fig.7(a) shows fluorescence spectra of bare and Ag-TiO2 light blue photoanodes with\nan excitation wavelength of 300nm. 80% of florescence quenching in the Ag-TiO2 light blue photoanode confirms the reduction in the electron-hole recombination as radiative transfer [50]. This may due to the creation of Schottky barrier at the metal - semiconductor junction, which would serves as electron sink to decrease electron hole recombination [51-52].\nThe Raman spectra of bare TiO2 and TiO2-Ag-Light blue screen printed photoanodes are shown in Fig.7 (b).The Raman peaks located at 144cm-1, 197cm-1, 397cm-1, 517cm-1 and 638cm-1 are assigned to the anatase phase of TiO2 [53-54]. From Fig.7a. It can be observed that the TiO2-Ag-Light blue photoanode exhibits an enhancement in the Raman intensity which is more pronounced at 144cm-1 compare to bare TiO2. This increase in Raman intensity may attribute to the enhancement of local field [55].\nFig.7. (a) Photoluminescence (b) Raman spectra of bare TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 light blue photoanodes.\nUV-Vis absorbance spectra of bare TiO2 and AgNPs incorporated TiO2 photoanodes were measured to compare their abilities for light harvesting (Fig 8(a)). All the AgNPs incorporated photoanodes show enhancement in optical absorption in the entire visible region due to the plasmonic effect, which helps to trap solar photons that may help to boost the photon to electron conversion. The amount of dye anchoring on the TiO2/AgNPs surface was analysed using desorbance measurements. Fig.8. (b) shows the absorption intensity of N719 dye solution detracted from the different multishaped AgNPs incorporated TiO2 photoanodes. The enhancement of dye absorption is evidenced in the multishaped AgNPs/TiO2 photoanodes, which may due to the provision of more absorbed sites for anchoring dye molecules.\nFig.8. (a) UV-Vis absorbance spectra N719 dye/TiO2 thin films incorporated with different multishaped AgNPs.(b) Desorbance of N719 dye from the active layer.\nFig.9. represents the Nyquist plot of bare and multishaped Ag nanoparticles incorporated photoanodes of DSSCs. The observed same series resistance value for all the photoanodes suggests that the addition of AgNPs does not alter the sheet resistance of the\ncurrent collector. Compared to all the photoanodes TiO2-Ag-Light blue based DSSC exhibited the lower charge transfer resistance. It implies that incorporation of AgNPs in the TiO2 matrix reduces the electron-hole recombination in turn it increases the charge transport, resulting in improvement in the overall performance of the fabricated device.\nFig.9. Nyquist plot of Bare and multishaped AgNPs incorporated DSSC devices All the plasmonics DSSCs fabricated by the incorporation of multishaped AgNPs exhibit enhancement in the PEC efficiency by contributing to both increase in Jsc as well as improvement in Voc when compared to non plasmonics DSSC as shown in Fig.10. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table.3 As can be clearly seen in Fig.10 and Table.3, among all the investigated plasmonics DSSC, when the extinction maximum completely/partially overlap with the two absorption maxima of the sensitizer and covers the widow region of the sensitizer, the DSSC shows superior activity in PCE. Ag-Light blue and Ag-Orange NPs fit in the above category and have the highest performance. Ag-Pink NPs has better overlap with one of the absorption bands of the sensitizer, but is lacking in the new/broad SPR band in the widow absorption region and overlap at the higher energy of N719 dye. Ag-Blue NPs exhibits similar performance in PCE as Ag-Orange even though it has broad SPR band in the window region of dye up to 1100nm, because it exhibits minimum overlap with the second absorption maxima of the\nphotosensitizer. When multishaped AgNPs were introduced to plasmonics DSSCs, the morphology combination of spheres and rods (Ag-Light blue) offers better overall performance.\nTable 3 : Photovoltaic parameters of bare and AgNPs incorporated plasmonic DSSC devices.\nSample Jsc (mA /cm 2 )\nVoc (V)\nFF \u03b7 (%)\nBare - TiO2 10.51 0.74 0.68 5.28\nTiO2-Ag- Light blue 15.75 0.77 0.63 7.64\nTiO2 - Ag -Pink 11.56 0.77 0.67 5.96\nTiO2 -Ag -Orange 14.17 0.79 0.64 7.16\nTiO2 -Ag-Blue 11.38 0.80 0.69 6.28\nThis particular combination may offer help to the sensitizer for harvesting more photons by overlapping the SPR bands to its two absorption maxima. In addition to this, Ag light blue NPs offers further contribution in such a way that it extends absorption in the window region of the N719 dye. The increase in Voc as shown in Fig .9b can be accounted by the charging effect of Ag/TiO2 conjugate [56]. The free electron lies near to the Fermi level of metal nanoparticles are absorb photons and excited to higher energy levels in the conduction band. In the case of DSSC there will be a metal semiconductor interface that forms a Schottky junction, which act as potential barriers. The excited electrons requiring energy to overcome this barrier will move on to the CB of TiO2. Hence the Fermi level of TiO2 is shifted to the more negative potential. This negative potential shift due to charging of Ag/TiO2 increases the Voc with respect to redox potential of the electrolyte. The boosting in current density can be related to light trapping, charge generation, separation with reduced recombination and interfacial charge transport. The metal nanoparticles helps the DSSC harness photons in three ways: (i) plasmonic resonance increases the local electromagnetic field which are higher than of normal electric field; (ii) secondary sensitizers as its extinction covers that window region of the sensitizer, so that unutilised photons by the pure sensitizer can be utilised for photon to electron conversion by non radiative property of Ag nanoparticles; and (iii) non-radiative plasmonic relaxation path will increase photons optical path lengths inside that TiO2/sensitizer active layer, which in turn will increase the probability to harvest more photons as it was detailed in UV \u2013Vis analysis. In addition, the Ag metal nanoparticles Fermi levels are in such a way that the excited electrons in LUMO level of the chosen sensitizer in the present case could be injected to the conduction band of Ag nanoparticles so that it reduces the recombination by charge transfer and decreases the interfacial charge transfer resistance. The pathways of electron injection are represented schematically in Fig11. The outstanding optical and electronic properties of AgNPs helped to obtain a higher conversion efficiency of 7.64%, which is 45% higher that bare TiO2.\nFig.11.

            "text": "From the above experimental results, it was clear that the localized surface plasmon effect depends on size and shapes of metal nanoparticles. In a particular microenvironment the observed shift in the plasmonic resonance position depends on size and shape of Ag nanoparticles [57]. Among these two parameters resonance peak position can be coarsely tuned by its shape and fine tuning is possible by its size. The NPs were simulated using the FDTD algorithm and are shown in Fig.12. which represents that normalised experimental spectrum of Light blue AgNPs and simulated extinction spectra of sphere, triangles and rod AgNPs. The shape and size of the nanoparticles for the simulation were taken from TEM images of the Ag-Light blue nanoparticles. Sphere shaped nanoparticles with 10nm diameter exhibits a resonance peak position at 390nm. When the symmetry of the metal nanoparticles reduces the charge distribution of Ag metal nanoparticles will not be uniform; hence, there will be multiple resonance peaks as the other polar terms will arises when compared to the conventional dipolar behaviour[58]. The triangle shaped nanoparticles exhibits the extinction maximum at 648nm. The rods longitudinal and transverse modes have been simulated separately and the resultant are plotted in Fig. 12.\nFig.12. Simulated extinction spectra of sphere, rods and triangles AgNPs and experimental extinction spectra Ag- Light blue\nThe normalized transverse mode oscillation resonance is found in the same region as the spherical nanoparticles resonance. This means that the induced polarization among transverse mode requires higher energy to restore and falls in the region of around 390 nm and the longitudinal resonance is observed at 621nm. The theoretically simulated spectra are in good agreement with experimental spectra and confirms the cooperation effect of different shapes. As interpreted in the experimental spectrum of multishaped Ag-Light blue nanoparticles the equal intense lower and higher peaks must be due to the constructive contribution of sphere and the transverse mode of rods. Further, the other broad observed lower energy peak corresponds to the collective effect of longitudinal modes of rods and, triangles are observed. Hence this cooperation effect may facilitate increased photons harvesting in the broad spectral regime of the sun.\nFig. 13. represents the local electric field enhancement in the near vicinity of spherical\nnanoparticles. This chosen size with the higher symmetry exhibits the dipolar like radiation pattern. It is more pronounced at 390 nm due to its plasmonic resonance, which in turn creates more enhancement of the local electric field in the vicinity of AgNPs.\nFig.13. Electric field distribution of single spherical AgNPs in water medium at different excitation wavelength.\nFig.14. shows the electric field pattern around the triangle shaped AgNPs. As per the discrete dipole approximation, the local field enhancement starts after 500nm and obtained a maximum resonance at around 615nm.\nFig.14. Near field distribution of triangular AgNPs in water medium at different excitation wavelength.\nFrom Fig.14 it is clearly evidenced that the charges are accumulated at the edges of the bottom of the triangle, which is in agreement with the earlier reports [59]. The simulated transverse and longitudinal local fields of the Ag rod NPs are displayed in Fig.15.At higher energy excitation, the transverse mode dominates and it starts decreasing when the excitation moves from its resonance wavelength, but the longitudinal modes local field gets enhanced in the visible region. This shows a maximum around 730nm.\nFig.15. Near field distribution of longitudinal and transverse rods of AgNPs in water medium at different excitation wavelength.\nIn order to confirm the plasmonic cooperation effect of all multishaped nanoparticles, a simulation was performed to mimic the experimentally obtained Ag-Light blue nanoparticles. Fig.16.represents such a situation and clearly confirms the plasmonic cooperation effect of multishaped Ag nanoparticles as a function of excitation radiation, which is in agreement with the experimental UV-Vis spectra of Ag-Light blue NPs. Hence the obtained experimental output and the theoretical findings indicate that the coupled plasmonic effect contributed to boost the performance of DSSC devices.\nFig.16.

            "text": "Combinations of multishaped AgNPs were obtained by a single route facile chemical reduction method. The obtained AgNPs having the region of extinction cross section from 330nm to 1100nm and the tuning in the plasmonic resonance position with respect to size and shape were investigated. These multishaped AgNPs were incorporated in the multifunctional TiO2 matrix to improve the efficiency of the DSSC devices. The outstanding optical and electronic properties of the multishaped AgNPs enhance the current density by (i) harnessing photons as an antenna, (ii) assisting the sensitizer harvesting more photons, (iii) serving as carrier separators, and (iv) reducing recombination and offering less charge transfer resistance. In addition, the shifted the Fermi levels due to the charging effect of Ag/ TiO 2 boosted the open circuit voltage. In summary, out of all the multishaped Ag nanoparticles, the one having the combination of uniform spheres, triangles with rods served optimally to harvest more photons by overlapping its SPR band with an absorption maxima of the dye and extending its help to absorbing photons in the window region of the sensitizer by its plasmonic cooperation effect. The experimental results found for the benefits of the plasmonic effect was supported with numerical simulations on the shape and size of the AgNPs. The maximum photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 7.64% is obtained for DSSC\nusing the plasmonic NPs in which boosting in the efficiency was 45% compare to the reference non plasmonic DSSC device giving an efficiency 5.28%.
