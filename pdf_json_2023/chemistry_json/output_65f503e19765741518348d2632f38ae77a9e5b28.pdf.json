Both the tandem mismatches and the looped-out residue destabilize the stem-loop str uct ure locally. Their distribution along the 5_SL4 stem-loop suggests a role of these non-canonical elements in ret aining functionally import ant str uct ural plasticity in particular with regard to the accessibility of the start codon of an upstream open reading frame located in the RNA\u2019s apical loop. The apical loop\u2014although mostly flexible\u2014harbors residual str uct ural feat ures suggesting an additional role in molecular recognition processes. 5_SL4 is highly conserved among the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and can be targeted by small molecule ligands, which it binds with intermediate affinity in the vicinity of the non-canonical elements within the stem-loop str uct ure.

Accordingly, chemcal probing approaches have demonstrated that > 60% of the iral genome is engaged in secondary structure inside virions 2 ,3 ) . The 5 \u2032 -genomic end in particular, which includes the \u2032 -untranslated region ( UTR ) , and the 3 \u2032 -UTR of the genome ontain multiple highly structured stem-loop elements, whose onservation among all \u03b2-CoVs is substantially higher than hat of the coding part of the genome. These stem-loops have n essential functional role in viral RNA replication, subgeomic mRNA production and viral protein translation ( 4 ) . While the three-dimensional structures of virtually all olded viral protein domains and their complexes have been eported, experimental structures of the RNA genome are issing with the exception of stem-loop 2 in the 5 \u2032 -UTR 5 ) , which is 100% conserved between S AR S-CoV and S AR SoV-2 and the pseudoknot constituting the frameshifting elment within the coding region of the RNA genome ( 6\u20138 ) . o far, only 3D structure models derived from fragment asembly of RNA with full atom refinement ( F ARF AR ) ( 9 ) and olecular dynamics simulations ( 10 ) are available for a set of\nenomic RNA elements. For proteins, 3D structure determination has had substanial impact on the elucidation of their biomolecular functions ithin the viral life cycle and also on the development of antiiral inhibitors, e.g. targeting the two proteases Nsp3d and sp5 ( 11 ) , the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase ( 12 ) as well s the nucleocapsid protein ( 13 ) . Within the global consortium Covid19-nmr ( 14 ) , we have efined and investigated 15 individually folded RNA elements f the S AR S-CoV-2 genome\u2014located in the 5 \u2032 -genomic end, he 3 \u2032 -UTR and the frameshifting region\u2014by nuclear magetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopic studies and reported heir secondary structures ( 15 ) . These RNA elements have lso been screened against small molecule libraries ( 16 ) . For he further development of screening hits toward viral inibitors with high affinity and specificity, precise information n the 3D structure and dynamics of the target RNAs is indisensable. Here, we report the solution NMR structure of the ourth stem-loop within the 5 \u2032 -UTR of the genome ( 5_SL4 ) omprising nucleotides 86 to 125. 5_SL4 was initially preicted based on its high conservation within the Coronaviriae family ( 4 ,17 ) . In all \u03b2-CoVs, it contains an upstream ORF uORF ) , which appears to be under positive evolutionary seection pressure ( 17 ) and is suggested to weakly reduce transation of the viral proteins Nsp1-16 ( 18 ) . The putative funcion of 5_SL4 is to enhance fidelity of discontinuous trancription by presenting a structural roadblock by guiding the eplication\u2013transcription complex to the proper location ( 19 ) . ccordingly, the location and stability of this RNA stem-loop re more conserved than its sequence within the Coronaviriae family ( 20 ) . Furthermore, only recently, recognition of the UGUG motif in the lower helix of 5_SL4 ( residues 86 to 0 ) by the host RNA-binding protein 24 ( RBM24 ) could be emonstrated ( 21 ) . An interaction between a similar motif and BM24 has been shown to inhibit viral transcript translation or Hepatitis B and C viruses previously ( 22 ,23 ) . Interestingly, he consensus GUGUG motif exists twice in the S AR S-CoV-2 \u2032 -UTR, the second one located in 5_SL5b, 18 nts upstream f the start codon. However, although both sequences are loated in very similar secondary structure elements, no RBM24 inding to the 5b RNA element could be detected, whereas BM24 unambiguously bound to SL4 ( 21 ) . This observaion underscores the need for experimental structural and dy-\nnamic data as a basis for the predictive study of RNA and its interactions.\nFrom the secondary structure analysis, it is apparent that 5_SL4 contains non-canonical structural elements: three bulge motifs as well as a five-nucleotide loop, which are conserved in all S AR S-CoV-2 variants. Knowledge on the precise structure of these non-canonical elements is indispensable as they significantly contribute to stem-loop stability and, hence, to the folding landscape of the RNA element in general. Moreover, non-canonical nucleotide interactions interrupt the formation of the classical A-form RNA helix and thereby provide specific binding sites for cellular interaction partners as well as for potential anti-viral inhibitors of low molecular weight. 5_SL4 has been shown to be druggable by the class of amiloride compounds, which selectively bind to the non-canonical parts of RNA stem-loop structures ( 24 ,25 ) . The 3D structure of 5_SL4 should both aid in gaining further insight into the function of this stem-loop within the S AR S-CoV-2 genome such as, for example, interactions with host proteins, and in facilitating the structure-guided development of compounds targeting this RNA element."

An excellent agreement of the degree of alignment could be achieved for the two selectively 13 C, 15 N-labeled samples. Isotropic reference samples with the same RNA concentrations were prepared by adding appropriate amounts of the corresponding buffer solution ( 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.6 ) instead of the phage solution. 1 D HN and 1 D HC RDCs were obtained using IPAP separation schemes of the doublet components ( 30 ) . 1 D HN of the U and G imino groups were extracted from 1 H, 15 N-IPAPsofast-HMQC spectra ( 31 ) .

Combined H and C CSPs were extracted from\ncomparison of the 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts of the spectrum of free 5_SL4 to the end-point of the titration ( H and C , respectively ) using Equation ( 2 ) .\nCSP ( H , C ) = \u221a ( H ) 2 + (\nC\n4\n)2 ( 2 )\nInput restraints and structure calculation 1 H- 1 H distance restraints were obtained from NOE cross peak intensities extracted from 2D 1 H, 1 H-NOESY, 2D 15 NCPMG-NOESY and 3D aromatic and aliphatic 1 H, 13 CNOESY-HSQC spectra. NOE intensities were referenced to the average of H5 / H6 cross peak intensities of pyrimidine residues that were set to 2.4 \u00c5 and then classified into five classes of upper limit distance restraints ( 3.5, 4.3, 5.4, 6.5 and 7.5 \u00c5) . Nucleobase and ribose moieties with { 1 H}, 13 ChetNOE values < 1.2 were considered rigid. For residue U95 with a considerably higher hetNOE value of the nucleobase moiety, only intraresidual distance restraints were incorporated to account for the conformationally averaged NOEs of this residue. For nucleobase and ribose moieties of residues in the apical loop, which displayed elevated hetNOE values > 1.2, distance restraints were loosened to the next longest upper limit class.\nConfirmed hydrogen bonds of canonical Watson\u2013Crick and wobble G \u2022U base pairs were incorporated using two upper limit and two lower limit restraints between the donor hydrogen and the acceptor heteronucleus ( 2.0 and 1.8 \u00c5) and between the two heteronuclei ( 3.0 and 2.8 \u00c5) . The backbone torsion angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b6 as well as the glycosidic torsion angle \u03c7 of all canonical A-form residues were amply set to typical A-form helical values ( \u00b120 \u25e6) .\nResidues with 3 J ( H1\u2019,H2\u2019 ) coupling constants < 2 Hz and 3 J ( H3\u2019,H4\u2019 ) > 8 Hz were restrained to the C3\u2019- endo conformation, residues with 3 J ( H1\u2019,H2\u2019 ) > 8 Hz and 3 J ( H3\u2019,H4\u2019 ) < 2 Hz were restrained to the C2\u2019 -endo conformation. In addition and for residues, for which no 3 J ( H,H ) coupling constants could be determined due to spectral overlap, canonical coordinates were used to delineate the ribose pucker ( 32 ,33 ) .\nStructure calculation was carried out using CYANA v.3.98.13 ( 34 ) . A total of 100 structures were calculated using 32 000 refinement steps per conformer with 12 000 high temperature steps of torsion angle dynamics followed by 20 000 steps of slow cooling and 8000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. The 10 structures with the lowest target function were refined in explicit water using ARIA protocols ( 35 ) . MOLMOL ( 36 ) and PyMOL ( Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc. ) were used for structure visualization."

            "text": "To solve the three-dimensional solution-state structure of 5_SL4, we first performed NMR resonance assignments on both 5_SL4 and 5_SL4sh using standard NMR assignment procedures as described ( 26 ) . Initial resonance assignment and secondary structure elucidation investigations supported the assumed stem-loop structure of 5_SL4 ( 15 ) . All predicted Watson\u2013Crick base pairs as well as the three expected G \u2022U base pairs in wobble geometry could be confirmed. At that point, however, the structural arrangement of the two pyrimidine mismatches C92 \u2022C119 and C100 \u2022U112, the unpaired nucleotide U95 and the structure of the apical loop ( U104U108 ) had not been addressed. In particular, the structure of the non-canonical intra-helical elements can have a strong effect on overall stem-loop geometry, as they might induce kinks resulting in significant deviations from a predicted rigid rodlike stem-loop structure. In addition, the detailed structure of the non-canonical elements, in particular the loop, together with their conservation pattern allows for insights into their impact on viral function.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/20/11318/7288826 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nIn determining the structure of 5_SL4, we relied on NOEderived 1 H- 1 H distance restraints from a fully 15 N-labeled and two selectively 13 C, 15 N-labeled samples ( A, C and G, U ) of 5_SL4 to decrease signal overlap as well as a fully 13 C, 15 N -labeled sample of 5_SL4sh. For the lower part of the stemloop ( residues G -2 to 96 and G116 to C +2 ) , the upper limit distance restraints derived from NOE cross peaks extracted from the 5_SL4 samples were used, while for the apical stem loop ( residues C96 to G116 ) the distance restraints obtained from the better resolved NOEs of the smaller 5_SL4sh were incorporated into the structure calculation. We could obtain on average 12 interresidual NOEs per residue. However, in the proximity of the two tandem mismatches and the single unpaired U95, this number was significantly reduced, mainly due to the absence of observable imino proton resonances. This local lack of NOE data resulted in a considerable variability in the calculated global structures, ranging from a completely rod-like overall fold to L- and U-shaped structures ( Supplementary Figure S1a, left ) . To test whether this local scarcity in NOE data reflects real conformational flexibility, we exploited the { 1 H}, 13 C-hetNOE of the nucleobase H6C6 and H8C8 moieties along the sequence of 5_SL4 as probes for the NOE-relevant sub- \u03c4c dynamics of the individual nucleobases ( Figure 2 a ) . Distinctly increased hetNOE values ( > 1.2 ) indicate that the unpaired residue U95 and G105 to U108 of the apical loop are flexible, while all other residues including the four nucleotides of the two tandem mismatches exhibit lower hetNOE values suggesting stable structural arrangements. Analysis of the NOEs in the vicinity of the flexible unpaired U95 revealed a number of stacking NOEs between the adjacent G94-C117 and C96-G116 base pairs, demonstrating that U95 is looped-out of an otherwise continuously stacking helix ( Figure 2 b ) . Of note, U95 is completely conserved among the different S AR S-CoV-2 variants, suggesting a functional role, e.g. serving as a recognition hub for host or viral protein binding partners.\nTo analyze the global structure of the 5_SL4 stem-loop, we measured NH and CH RDCs. Incorporation of these RDC values into the structure calculation resulted in a global rodlike structure ( Supplementary Figure S1a, right ) as well as an improvement in the average pairwise heavy atom RMSD of all non-flexible residues of the ensemble of the 10 lowest target function structures from 10.3 \u00b1 5.8 \u00c5 to a final value of 2.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00c5. The combined NMR data show that 5_SL4 in fact forms a continuous straight stem with the unpaired U95 looped out, a rather unstructured apical loop and the two pyrimidine \u2022pyrimidine mismatches consistently located within the helical structure ( Figure 2 c ) . The NMR statistics of the structure of 5_SL4 are summarized in Table 1 .\nTo independently cross-validate the global NMR structure of 5_SL4 by a complementary method, we subjected the RNA to SAXS measurements. The ab initio- modeled SAXS envelope of 5_SL4 can be described as a roughly axially symmetric elongated stick with a radius of gyration ( R g ) of 21.3 \u00c5 and a maximal distance distribution ( D max ) of 69.5 \u00c5. These dimensions agree well with the 10 structures of the NMR bundle ( R g = 20.3 \u00b1 0.7 \u00c5 and D max = 71 \u00b1 4 \u00c5; Figure 2 d ) . The agreement between the back-calculated scattering of the structures of the NMR ensemble and the SAXS data is very good ( \u03c72 = 13.4 \u00b1 12.3; Supplementary Figure S1b ) . In summary, SAXS data support that 5_SL4 adopts a rod-like global structure.\nThe apical loop is flexible with residual structural features The apical loop of 5_SL4 consists of five nucleotides with the highly conserved sequence 5 \u2032 -UGCAU-3 \u2032 . The two 3 \u2032 -residues of the loop are part of the start codon of the uORF. High { 1 H}, 13 C-hetNOE values ( > 1.2 ) indicate that most of the loop residue nucleobase and ribose moieties are more dynamic than the stem ( Figure 3 a ) . In line with this observed flexibility, the apical loop is not converged in the NMR-bundle but largely disordered ( Figure 3 b,c ) . While { 1 H}, 13 C-hetNOE values report on the presence of sub-nanosecond flexibility of individual C-H moieties, they do not allow to draw conclusions on whether the observed dynamics originate from a correlated motion of all the affected residues, independent motions of the individual residues or a mixture thereof. Therefore, we have focused on residual structural features of the loop, which can be delineated from chemical shifts, NOE patterns and scalar coupling constants. U104\u2014the first nucleotide in the loop\u2014is the only structurally stable loop residue with low { 1 H}, 13 ChetNOE for both its ribose and nucleobase moiety ( Figure 3 a ) , canonical chemical shifts ( Figure 3 d ) and a sequential NOE pattern to the preceding C103 ( Supplementary Figure S2a ) . These data demonstrate a continuation of the canonical helical structure into the loop by one residue, with U104 stably stacking on top of C103. For G105 as well as C106, both 3 J ( H,H ) coupling constants and canonical coordinates point to a stable C2\u2019- endo ribose conformation ( Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Figure S2b ) . For C106 unusual upfield chemical shifts can be observed for H2\u2019, H4\u2019, H5\u2019 and H5\u201d ( Figure 3 d ) , suggesting a proximity of the C106 ribose to a nucleobase moiety. In the NMR structure bundle, the C106 moiety is most often located close to the nucleobase of A107. The proximity of a ribose moiety in C2\u2019- endo conformation to the nucleobase of the following residue is a typical feature of the Z-step structural motif ( 40 ) . This 2-nucleotide motif is characteristic for Z-DNA, but has also been identified in a large variety of structural contexts in natural RNAs such as riboswitch aptamer domains or ribosomal RNA ( 41 ) . It involves a lonepair\u2026\u03c0 interaction between the ribose O4\u2019 of the 5 \u2032 -residue and the nucleobase of the 3 \u2032 -residue ( Supplementary Figure S2c ) . To achieve this interaction, the 5 \u2032 -ribose moiety is reversed in its orientation. This head-to-head orientation can be observed for the C106 ribose moiety in a number of the structures of the NMR bundle. In a Z -step the 3 \u2032 -residue is preferably a purine with the nucleobase in syn -orientation. For 5_SL4, the moderate intraresidual NOE between H1\u2019 and H8 for A107, however, suggests that this residue adopts predominantly an anti- conformation. Taken together, the NMR data indicate that C106 and A107 form a subcategory of Z -steps referred to as Z anti -step at least transiently ( 40 ) .\nThe last residue of the 5_SL4 apical loop, U108, is very dynamic, with a flexible nucleobase moiety and completely averaged ribose pucker conformation. In the NMR structure bundle, U108 is mostly flipped-out of the loop, suggesting that the 5_SL4 pentaloop can be actually considered as a tetraloop with a one-nucleotide 3 \u2032 -extension. For the first four loop nucleotides, the observed residual structural features, the C2\u2019endo ribose pucker of loop residues 2 and 3, the Z-step conformation of loop residues 3 and 4 and the stable stacking of the first loop residue are all structural characteristics reminiscent of the YNMG tetraloop motif ( Y = C, U; N = any nucleotide; M = A, C ) ( 42 ) . This motif has been shown to\nFigure 2. NMR str uct ure and str uct ural details of 5_SL4. ( A ) { 1 H}, 13 C-hetNOE of the aromatic pyrimidine H6C6 and purine H8C8 moieties of 5_SL4.

Members of the YNMG tetraloop famly also share characteristic NMR spectral features. Thus, the\nupfield ribose proton chemical shifts of the third loop nucleotide found for the 5_SL4 C106 ribose moiety are also generally observed for members of the YNMG family such as the very stable UNCG motif ( Supplementary Figure S2d ) ( 44 ) , the CACG tetraloop of the Coxsackievirus D-loop ( 45 ) , and the UCAG ( U ) as well as the CUUG ( U ) pentaloops of a telomerase RNA mutant ( 43 ) and mouse hepatitis virus stem-loop 2 ( 46 ) . Furthermore, downfield chemical shifts of H2\u2019 and H3\u2019 observed for A107 are characteristic for the fourth UNCG loop residue ( 44 ) .\nAn additional structural characteristic of the YNMG motif is a hydrogen bond between the amino group of the A or C at position 3 and the phosphate group of the second loop residue ( 44 ) . Although a similar interaction cannot be observed directly in the apical loop of 5_SL4, the amino group nitrogen resonance of C106 is shifted downfield by \u223c1.5 ppm compared to the amino resonance of free monomeric cytidine ( Supplementary Figure S2e ) . In general, the amino nitrogen chemical shift is sensitive to hydrogen bonding interactions with a shift toward larger ppm values signifying a stronger hydrogen bond. In addition, also the temperature dependence\nFigure 3. Str uct ural details of the apical loop.

Two distinct resonances are observed for the two amino hydrogens when the rotation around the exocyclic C\u2013N bond is sufficiently slow, e.g. at low temperatures or in the presence of stabilizing hydrogen bonds. By contrast, at higher temperatures only one degenerate hydrogen resonance is present due to chemical exchange arising from increased rotation around the C\u2013N bond. For C106, the amino group signals can still be observed at temperatures of up to 30 \u25e6C, whereas the amino resonances of free cytidine vanish already at \u223c20 \u25e6C ( Supplementary Figure S2e,f ) . In contrast, for cytidines in Watson\u2013Crick G\u2013C base pairs, two distinct amino resonances can still be clearly observed at a temperature of 50 \u25e6C. We therefore conclude that the amino group of C106 forms a weak or transient hydrogen bond. Although the hydrogen bond acceptor group could not be determined experimentally, it is reasonable to assume that in analogy to the YNMG tetraloop motif, the acceptor is one of the nonbridging oxygen atoms of the G105 phosphate group.\nIn general, all loop sequences that have been included into the extended YNMG consensus motif so far have displayed base pairs between the first and the fourth loop residue. This comprised a trans Sugar \u2022Watson-Crick Y \u2022G base pair ( 44 ,45 ) , a sheared G A pseudo base pair without a direct hy-\ndrogen bond ( 47 ) and a Watson\u2013Crick C\u2013G base pair ( 46 ) . All of these base pairs are characterized by a syn or a high anti conformation of the fourth loop nucleotide. By contrast, the fourth residue of the 5_SL4 apical loop, A107, adopts an anti -conformation, an averaged ribose conformation and no indication of a stable base-pairing interaction with U104 can be found. The absence of a stable base pair between the first and the fourth loop residue likely rationalizes the decreased stability of the 5_SL4 apical loop compared to the YNMG ( N ) loop sequences, for which stable structures were reported previously. The transient nature of the structural features in the apical loop of 5_SL4 is also supported by the canonical A-form like chemical shifts of its phosphate resonances likely originating from a less defined or averaged conformation ( 26 ) . Accordingly, an overlay between the 5_SL4 NMR bundle and the NMR structure of a UUCG tetraloop shows that whereas the overall positioning of the first and fourth loop residue is similar, the distinct backbone conformation of the UUCG tetraloop is not reflected in the various different conformations of the 5_SL4 apical loop ( Figure 3 e ) . In conclusion, the apical loop of 5_SL4 can be described as dynamic with transient structural features which share certain similarities with a YNMG ( N ) motif summarized in Figure 3 f.\ns t s o o a W\na b s l w T a r\nM 5 c w t w t b b W p p g G g p { c ( i a ( t t h g m\nt e d a g f c d s c a 5 d a a d\nhelix.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/20/11318/7288826 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nInterestingly, in agreement with the structural features oberved in the NMR-experiments, molecular dynamics simulaions of 5_SL4 report a dynamic ensemble for the apical loop tructures comprising an YNMG ( N ) -like fold with a flippedut 3 \u2032 -residue. Within the molecular dynamics ensemble, a Z - r Z anti -step between the third and fourth residue is found nd a base pair between U104 and A107, which either adopts atson\u2013Crick or Sugar \u2022Hoogsteen geometry ( 10 ) . Given that the observed high sequence conservation of the pical loop is not imposed by requirements to form a stale structure, the question remains as to the underlying reaons for this conservation. It can be assumed that a stable oop structure would interfere with the function of the uORF, hose start codon comprises loop residues A107 and U108. he residual structural features identified could be involved in dditional functions of 5_SL4 such as providing an adaptive egion for transient interactions with viral or host structures.\nixed tandem mismatches _SL4 contains two mixed tandem mismatches ( TMs ) both onsisting of a pyrimidine \u2022pyrimidine mismatch and a G \u2022U obble base pair ( Figure 4 a ) . In the lower part of 5_SL4, he C92 \u2022C119 mismatch is preceded by the G91 \u2022U120 obble base pair ( TM1 ) . Further up in the 5_SL4 stem, he U112 \u2022C100 mismatch follows the U111 \u2022G101 woble base pair ( TM2 ) . Both tandem mismatches are flanked y a Watson\u2013Crick G\u2013C base pair on the G \u2022U side and a atson\u2013Crick U\u2013A ( TM1 ) or A-U ( TM2 ) base pair on the yrimidine \u2022pyrimidine mismatch side. For both G \u2022U base airs the usual wobble-geometry characterized by two hydroen bonds, one between the U-N3H3 imino group and the -O6 carbonyl group and one between the G-N1H1 imino roup and the U-O2 carbonyl group has been established reviously ( 26 ) . For both pyrimidine \u2022pyrimidine mismatches, 1 H}, 13 C-hetNOE values of both the ribose C1\u2019 and the nuleobase C6 spin are < 1.2 signifying a stable conformation see Figures 2 a and 3 a ) . The ribose puckers of all four pyrimdine residues determined from 3 J ( H,H ) coupling constants nd canonical coordinates of the ribose 13 C shifts is C3\u2019-endo Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S3a ) , and he characteristic aromatic-aliphatic NOE pattern is mainained along the mismatches as expected for an A-form RNA elical arrangement ( Supplementary Figure S3b,c ) . Taken toether, these data suggest that the pyrimidine \u2022pyrimidine misatches in TM1 and TM2 form defined base pairs. In general, pyrimidine \u2022pyrimidine mismatches are known o be polymorphic ( 48 ) . In a helical environment, their geomtry varies with the identity of the flanking base pairs. Major riving forces seem to be to maintain helical integrity, while t the same time securing optimal base stacking and hydroen bonding interactions. Considering the type of base pair ormed between C92 and C119 in TM1, neither of the two ytidine residues is protonated, as no imino resonance can be etected and nucleobase C4 chemical shifts suggest neutral N3 ites for both C92 and C119 ( 26 ) . Previous studies of intrahelial C \u2022C mismatches in other RNAs postulated the presence of dynamical base pair subjected to positional averaging ( 49\u2013 1 ) . In these cases, no amino group signals could be observed ue to the presence of chemical exchange. This exchange was ttributed to the two C-residues interchanging as donor and cceptor sites in more or less equal proportions with a hyrogen bond between the amino group of one and the N3\nof the other cytidine. Also for 5_SL4 the amino resonance of C92 cannot be detected due to exchange broadening. However, two weak, but distinct amino proton signals are found for C119 ( Supplementary Figure S4a ) . Thus, the C92 \u2022C119 mismatch in the 5_SL4 sequence context appears slightly asymmetric, with the amino group of C119 serving as the predominant hydrogen bond donor group. The NMR ensemble is also in agreement with conformational averaging with a preference for the conformation with the C119 amino group as the hydrogen bond donor ( Supplementary Figure S4b ) .\nFor the C100 \u2022U112 mismatch in TM2, no imino proton resonance is detectable for U112 in the 1 H, 15 N imino HSQC spectrum ( see Figure 1 c ) , suggesting that the U112 imino group is not involved in a stable hydrogen bond. By contrast, two distinct resonances can be observed for the C100 amino group with a nitrogen shift of 96.8 ppm ( see Supplementary Figure S2d ) . Compared to the amino group chemical shifts of free cytidine, the amino group nitrogen of C100 is thus shifted downfield by \u223c3 ppm, suggesting that it serves as hydrogen bond donor. Two distinct amino proton resonances can be observed up to a temperature of 35 \u25e6C, indicating that the hydrogen bonding interaction is weak compared to the one of cytidine amino groups in Watson\u2013Crick base pairs ( see Supplementary Figure S2e ) . In principle, the hydrogen bond acceptor group could be either the U112-O2 or -O4 carbonyl group. Uridine carbonyl chemical shifts are known to be sensitive to their involvement in hydrogen bonds with downfield resonance positions suggesting the presence of a hydrogen bond ( 43 ) . For U112 both C2 and C4 are found to resonate at an upfield position, thus no clear information on which carbonyl group is hydrogen bonded to the C100 amino group can be obtained from the carbonyl shifts ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Although both hydrogen bonding arrangements have been reported in earlier structures of C \u2022U mismatches, only the hydrogen bond between the C-amino group and the UO4 carbonyl group has been found in intrahelical single C \u2022U mismatches ( 44 ,52\u201359 ) . Incorporation of either the hydrogen bond to O2 or O4 of U112 into the structure calculation of 5_SL4 also resulted in a preference for the O4 carbonyl as hydrogen bond acceptor, since in this case the hydrogen bond could be introduced without violation of distance restraints.\nA structural comparison of the two tandem mismatches shows that in agreement with the different directionality of the G \u2022U wobble base pairs, their base stacking topology also differs ( Figure 4 a, left ) . G \u2022U wobble base pairs are known to be non-isosteric to U \u2022G base pairs. In particular, the twist angle preceding a G \u2022U base pair ( as in TM1 ) is larger than the canonical twist, while the one preceding a U \u2022G base pair ( as in TM2 ) is smaller, implicating sequence dependent effects on base stacking ( 60 ) . Accordingly, while in TM1 intrastrand stacking mostly occurs between the two mismatch base pairs and stacking to the adjacent Watson\u2013Crick base pairs is limited, the opposite is the case in TM2. In both cases the disruption of the A-form helix introduced by the G \u2022U mismatch in respect of helical twist and stacking interactions, appears to be compensated by the opposite geometry of the pyrimidine \u2022pyrimidine mismatch. Furthermore, C1\u2019-C1\u2019 distances differ only very slightly from canonical Aform geometry across both tandem mismatches ( Figure 4 a, right ) again suggesting that the mismatches adopt a conformation which causes minimal disruption of the A-form\nFigure 4.

For G \u2022U base pairs, the integral of the G imino resonance was considered in the analysis.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/20/11318/7288826 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nIn line with their different structural features, the stability of the two tandem mismatches differs as well. Imino group resonance integrals in 1 H, 15 N-HSQC spectra reflect the stability of the imino proton against exchange with the solvent water, which in turn depends on the stability of the hydrogen bonding interaction in which a given imino group is involved. For both TM regions, significant reductions in imino group resonance integrals compared to the stable stem regions are observed ( Figure 4 b ) , indicating that despite the moderate disruption of A-form geometry, both TM regions locally disrupt the stability of the 5_SL4 stem. The extent of this destabilization, however, is different for the two TMs. For TM2, two sharp imino resonances are observed for the 5 \u2032 -U111 \u2022G101-3 \u2032 base pair with resonance integrals similar to those of canonical stem residues, indicating that this U \u2022G wobble base pair is stable. By contrast, for 5 \u2032 -G91 \u2022U120-3 \u2032 in TM1, the imino group signal integrals are much reduced, indicating unstable base pairing. Furthermore, the imino group signal integral of U99 of the U-A base pair flanking TM2 is significantly larger than the one of U93 flanking TM1. Taken together, these observations suggest that TM1 is less stable than TM2. The local instability of the two TMs as well as their different relative stability observed in our NMR-investigation is in agreement with dimethyl sulfate ( DMS ) mapping data ( 61 ) , which reports increased reactivity of all three cytosines in the pyrimidine \u2022pyrimidine mismatches with C92 in TM1 showing the highest reactivity.\nC100 in the C100 \u2022U112 mismatch is transiently protonated Interestingly, we could not detect a N3 resonance for C100 under standard slightly acidic NMR-conditions ( pH 6.2, ( 26 ) ) . The absence of the N3 resonance suggests that this nitrogen is transiently protonated at pH 6.2, e.g. broadened by chemical exchange between a protonated and a non-protonated state. To test this hypothesis, we performed a step-wise pH titration. As shown by Legault and Pardi, the cytidine C4 chemical shift is extremely sensitive to the protonation state of the\nneighboring N3 shifting upfield by \u223c6 ppm on N3 protonation ( 62 ) . Indeed, the C4 of residue C100 shifted by exactly 6 ppm from 167.2 ppm at pH 6.2 to 161.2 ppm at pH 4.3 ( Figure 5 a ) . The pH dependence of the C4 shift of C100 can be used to fit a p K a of 5.3 \u00b1 0.1 for this residue ( Figure 5 a, inset ) . This value is shifted by one pH unit from the p K a of free cytidine mononucleotides ( p K a of 4.3, ( 63 ) ) . Thus, at a pH of 6.2, which was used in the structure determination procedure, C100 is only partially protonated with 11% of the protonated species. We therefore report the unprotonated structure in this investigation.\nAt a pH of 4.3, an additional imino resonance can be detected in the 1 H, 15 N-HSQC spectrum ( Figure 5 c ) , which can be assigned to the C100 H3N3 imino group by connecting the H5 to the N3 via the H5 ( C5 ) C4 and the H5 ( C5C4 ) N3 spectrum ( Figure 5 a\u2013c ) . Both the C100-N3 and its H3 resonance are found in the upfield region of the imino resonances typical for non-canonical interactions with oxygens as hydrogen bond acceptors. Based on the NMR structure, the most likely hydrogen bond acceptor for the C100-N3 imino group is the U112-O4 carbonyl group. The structural context of the C100 \u2022U112 mismatch with the hydrogen bond between the C100-amino and the U112-O4 carbonyl group brings C100N3 in close proximity to the U112-O4. The formation of this second hydrogen bond to the U112-O4 carbonyl group is supported by a slight downfield shift of the U112-C4 resonance at lower pH values ( Figure 5 a ) . In this detailed analysis, we observe a pH-dependent polymorphism of the C100 \u2022U112 base pair ( Figure 5 d ) : At higher pH, only one hydrogen bond is consistently formed between the C100-N4 amino and the U112-O4 carbonyl group. At lower pH, the N3 protonated form of C100 becomes increasingly populated and a bifurcated C + \u2022U base pair with two hydrogen bonds, one between the C + -N4 amino group and the U-O4 carbonyl group and one between the C + -N3 imino group and the U-O4 is predominant. Although the low-pH C + \u2022U base pair is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds, the temperature dependence of its amino proton resonances suggests that it is not significantly more stable than the neutral C \u2022U mismatch ( Supplementary\nFigure 5.

Thus, the gain in stability by an additional hydroen bond is apparently counteracted by a less favorable base air geometry with regard to base stacking, C1\u2019-C1\u2019 distance r overall hydrogen bonding geometry. tructure prediction of 5_SL4 using F ARF AR2 or proteins, three-dimensional structure prediction from priary sequences provided by programs such as AlphaFold has ade considerable progress ( 64 ) . These deep learning algoithms profit from the vast number of deposited protein strucures combined with neural network learning procedures. For NA, de novo sequence based predictions can be obtained\nrom Rosetta\u2019s Fragment Assembly of RNA ( F ARF AR2 ( 65 ) ) , hich uses a helix base pair step in combination with a fragent library. To assess the reliability of the F ARF AR2 preiction in the case of 5_SL4 we compared the NMR strucural bundle to a bundle of 10 F ARF AR conformers preicted based on the 5_SL4 sequence and previously estabished secondary structure ( 9 ) . As the experimentally deterined structure, F ARF AR2 consistently predicts a rod-like tem-loop structure ( Supplementary Figure S7a ) . However, the tructural details of the prediction differ significantly from the xperimentally determined structure. Thus, U95 is stacked inide the helical stem between the U94-G117 and the C96116 base pair in all F ARF AR2 structures, whereas the ex-\nperimental data clearly shows that this residue is excluded from the helix and flexible ( Supplementary Figure S7b ) . Interestingly, the asymmetric insertion of U95 into the helix in the predicted 5_SL4 stem-loops is incorporated without an appreciable kink in the overall structure. The overall straight rodlike shape is similar to the NMR structure, with the difference that the F ARF AR2 prediction results in slightly narrower and shorter structures ( Supplementary Figure S7c; R g = 19.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 and D max = 66.6 \u00b1 1.3 \u00c5) . An evaluation of the solution scattering from the F ARF AR2 and the NMR structure with the best agreement to the SAXS data ( \u03c72 = 23 and 2, respectively ) by the program CRYSOL ( 39 ) illustrates the better fit of the experimental NMR-structure to the SAXS-data ( Supplementary Figure S7d ) .\nA general overemphasis of stacking interactions in the prediction is also found for the apical loop, where both the first residue ( U104 ) and the last residue ( U108 ) are found inside the loop stacked on the respective closing base pair residue ( Supplementary Figure S7e ) . In addition, the remaining loop residues are found in different stacked conformations inside the loop. Overall, the F ARF AR2 prediction significantly overemphasizes the compactness of the apical loop conformation in contradiction to the high degree of conformational flexibility indicated by the NMR data.\nAs for the C92 \u2022C119 mismatch, two different conformations are predicted with similar frequency, both with one\nFigure 6.

Apparently, while the hydrogen bonding details of the C \u2022C mismatch are reflected in the F ARF AR2 prediction, the asymmetry of the mismatch environment is not sufficiently incorporated into it. For the C100 \u2022U112 mismatch, a base pair with two hydrogen bonds is consistently predicted by F ARF AR2, one between the C-amino group and U-O4 and one between the U-imino group and C-N3 ( Supplementary Figure S7g ) .\nIn summary, F ARF AR2 predicts an overall rod-like structure for 5_SL4 in agreement with the experimental data. The structural details of the interesting non-canonical elements, however, are characterized by an overestimation of both stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. Interestingly, despite the availability of the respective structural data, features like the preference for the Z anti -step in the apical loop, which are consistently observed by the NMR investigation and modeled in the molecular dynamics simulations, are not predicted by F ARF AR2. Considering that the 5_SL4 stem-loop with its small size and moderate number of non-canonical elements represents a rather simple prediction benchmark, the need for further improvement of the prediction scoring algorithms and cross-validation with experimental data such as accessibility data or hydrogen bonding information from NMR seems still\nadvisable, in particular when the structure constitutes the basis for drug targeting efforts.\n5_SL4 chemical shift and structural data as basis for structure-guided drug development As most of the stem-loop structures in the 5 \u2032 -UTR of the S AR S-CoV-2 genome, also 5_SL4 is highly conserved among the different S AR S-CoV-2 variants. In particular, the C92 \u2022C119 mismatch is completely conserved, the C100 \u2022U112 mismatch is only very rarely substituted by a G \u2022U, the looped out U95 is only very rarely deleted and A107 and U108 of the apical loop are completely conserved as they are part of the conserved uORF. Of the remaining residues of the apical loop, U104 is completely conserved, while G105 and C106 are only very rarely mutated to uridines ( 66 ) .\n5_SL4 has been recently found to be a druggable target for small molecule ligands ( 16 ,24 ) . The chemical shift assignment and the information on the three-dimensional structure of the elements of the S AR S-CoV-2 genome allow a more detailed characterization of small compound binders identified in these screening efforts. Amiloride has been previously identified as promising scaffold for specific RNA targeting ( 25 ) . Here, we have selected one of several identified binders from a library of dimethylamiloride ( DMA ) derivatives carrying fluoride atoms as additional NMR sensitive probes, DMA0043\n( p ( D 1\np c c t s w i g m m c o c m t s m G i w v R R r a a T c\nF O c p l d f C t s o c t t m e a s p n t l g\nD T t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/20/11318/7288826 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nFigure 6 a ) . Initial binding to 5_SL4 was verified by 19 F comound shifts in 1D NMR spectra on addition of the RNA Supplementary Figure S8a ) . To map the binding region of MA0043 on 5_SL4, we titrated selectively G,U- and A,C3 C, 15 N-labeled samples with increasing amounts of the comound. The binding event was followed by recording 1 H, 13 Correlation spectra for the aromatic CH-moieties. Thus, we ould monitor site-specific binding for each residue. On titraion with DMA0043, several peaks in the 1 H, 13 C-HMQC pectrum of 5_SL4 shift and / or become broader in agreement ith binding of the compound to the RNA with an affinity n the \u03bcM range ( Figure 6 b; Supplementary Figure S8b ) . Reions with large CSPs are located around the two tandem misatches, the looped-out U95 as well as around the two terinal G-C base pairs ( Figure 6 c ) . Given that the mismatches ould be regions with the function to locally destabilize the therwise rigid stem-loop structure, a ligand like DMA0043 ould interfere with this function by effectively stabilizing the ismatch region. Considering the small size of the compound, he extended regions on the 5_SL4 RNA, for which the NMRignals are affected by the presence of DMA0043, suggest ultiple interaction regions. Interestingly, also the terminal \u2013C base pairs show affinity for DMA0043 likely rationalzing the lack in specific binding observed for the compound, hich also showed affinity to several other stem-loops in pre-\nious screening assays ( 16 ) . This rationale for the unspecific NA binding properties of DMA0043 shows the value of our NA-based site-specific NMR analysis and can serve to diect further combinatorial chemistry efforts to develop tighter nd more specific binders. Thus, further diversification of the miloride scaffold as for example demonstrated for HIV-1 AR RNA ( 25 ) , e.g. by introduction of bulky substituents ould interfere with unspecific stacking interactions.\nunctional implications of the 5_SL4 structure ur structural investigation of 5_SL4 shows that its nonanonical elements are integrated into a more or less unerturbed A-form stem-loop structure. Given that both the ooped-out U95 as well as the two mixed tandem mismatches o not result in pronounced structural deviations from the Aorm RNA helix while they are conserved among the S AR SoV-2 variants, the question remains as to which function hese structural elements perform in the viral genome. We oberved that the regions around the mismatches and the loopedut residue are less stable than the surrounding stretches of ontinuous canonical RNA. For G \u2022U mismatches, which are he most frequently occurring mismatches in biological RNAs, heir structural deformability is believed to be crucial for olecular recognition ( 49 ) . The function of the non-canonical lements could therefore be to maintain the conformation and t the same time allow for plasticity of the long stem-loop tructure of 5_SL4 in processes such as interactions with viral roteins during the viral life cycle. In particular, effective scaning of the ribosomal 48S pre-initiation complex and translaion of the uORF with the start codon located in the apical oop of 5_SL4 likely depend on unstable non-canonical reions in its vicinity.\nata availability he coordinates of the 10 5_SL4 structures with the lowest arget functions of the NMR-bundle have been submitted to\nthe PDB under the accession code 8CQ1.
