On the other hand, for the radio-quiet ones, the SSC X-ray scenario is unlikely since it requires a magnetic field strength so low (i.e., B 10 \u03bcG; Zhang et al. 2018) that it is far below the value expected in the equipartition condition (i.e., B \u223c 100 \u03bcG; Kataoka & Stawarz 2005). Moreover, some of these sources indicate spatial discrepancy between the radio and X-ray emission regions (e.g.,Thimmappa et al. 2020; Orienti et al. 2020; Migliori et al. 2020). These features imply multizone/component radiations; for example, the synchrotron radiation of another electron population is considered a plausible X-ray origin (e.g., Hardcastle et al. 2004).\nThe X-ray synchrotron emission corresponds to the electrons with energies of a few tens of TeV, and the derived radiative lifetime of the electrons is of the order of 10 years. This means that the X-ray, particularly in hard X-ray, reflects the recent particle acceleration. Thus, X-ray observations are valuable to study the accelerated particles and the recent history of particle acceleration in hotspots. However, in general, a high angular resolution is crucial to detect hotspots by resolving them from the nuclei. In addition, a wide-band X-ray spectrum is required to determine the energy index and investigate possible cut-off/break features, which reveals the physical state in the hotspot. Most hotspots are detected with limited X-ray energy range and photon statistics, and then a detailed spectrum is not well known.\nThe hotspot located at the western jet terminal of Pictor A is one of the nearest and ideal hotspots to be investigated in X-rays. The hotspot located 4\u2032 from the nucleus exhibits one of the highest X-ray fluxes among the hotspots (see the compilations of Kataoka & Stawarz 2005 and Zhang et al. 2018). So far, some remarkable features have been reported in multi-wavelength (Thomson et al. 1995; Wilson et al. 2001; Isobe et al. 2017, 2020; Thimmappa et al. 2020). Tingay et al. (2008) discovered sub-kpc-scale radio structures in the hotspot and suggested that they are counterparts of the X-ray emission. Hardcastle et al. (2016) reported the possible month-scale X-ray flux decrease from the long-term Chandra observation and supported the idea that the fine radio structure is physically associated with the X-ray emission because of the compatibility between the time scale and the size of the fine structure. In addition to the flux decrease, they reported a possible spectral break around 2 keV. The flux decrease and spectral break led them to argue that X-rays are emitted by the highest-energy\nTable 1.

However, there remains room for further investigation due to the limited statistics and energy range.\nThe high-energy cut-off is predicted in X-ray bands if the X-rays originate from the highest energy electrons. In this paper, we utilize the hard X-ray observation performed by NuSTAR to investigate the cut-off feature. Ahead of NuSTAR data analysis, we present Chandra and XMMNewton data analysis to investigate the wide-band X-ray spectral shape with high photon counts and verify the flux decrease.\nThroughout this paper, we adopted the cosmological parameters of H0 = 67 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, m = 0.32, = 0.68 (Planck Collaboration 2020). At the redshift of Pictor A (z = 0.035, Eracleous & Halpern 2004), the luminosity distance is evaluated as 158 Mpc. The angular size of 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to the physical size of 0.71 kpc at the source rest frame.\n2 Observation and data reduction\n2.1 Chandra\nChandra (Weisskopf et al. 2000) performs high-resolution soft X-ray imaging and spectroscopy. The High Resolution Mirror Assembly of Chandra, realizing a sub-arcsecondscale point-spread function (PSF) size, is the best X-ray optics for us to investigate a detailed position and structure of the hotspot. The X-ray detectors of the Advanced charge-coupled device (CCD) Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS: Garmire et al. 2003) cover the energy range of 0.3\u2013 10.0 keV.\nChandra observed the Pictor A region 14 times between 2000 and 2015. The observation IDs and the dates are tabulated in table 1. These observation results are reported in other papers. The X-ray hotspot was found to be well associated with the radio one and identified by Chandra (Wilson et al. 2001; Thimmappa et al. 2020). Furthermore, Hardcastle et al. (2016) investigated all observations and reported an X-ray flux decrease of the hotspot.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pasj/article/74/3/602/6585093 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nWe re-analyzed the data of the observations to confirm the X-ray emission from the hotspot and re-evaluate the time variability, utilizing the software (ciao-4.13; Fruscione et al. 2006) and the calibration database (CALDB 4.9.5) that are newer versions than those previously used in the literature. We performed the data reduction using chandra_repro script. The exposure times obtained after the reduction are almost the same as those in Hardcastle et al. (2016), the total of which is 460 ks.\n2.2 XMM-Newton\nXMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) performs the high throughput imaging spectroscopy in a soft X-ray band with the three telescopes realizing a large effective area of 4500 cm2 at 1 keV, in total. Their field-of-view of 30 \u00d7 30 arcmin2 and PSF size of \u223c15\u2032\u2032 in half-power diameter (HPD) are well suited to the hotspot observation. Three X-ray CCD cameras (European Photon Imaging Cameras: EPICs) installed in the telescopes, two front-illuminated CCDs of Metal Oxide Semi-conductors (MOS1, MOS2; Turner et al. 2001) and a back-illuminated pn type CCD (PN; Stru\u0308der et al. 2001) cover the energy range of 0.2\u2013 10 keV.\nXMM-Newton observed the Pictor A region on 2001 March 17 and on 2005 January 14. The observation IDs are 0090050801 and 0206039010, respectively. Utilizing the data, Grandi et al. (2003) and Migliori et al. (2007) studied the eastern and the western lobes of Pictor A.\nIn the first observation, the MOS cameras were operated in the small window mode and failed to observe the western hotspot. The PN observed the hotspot, but near the detector gap. In the second observation, on the other hand, the hotspot was successfully observed by both MOS1 and PN, but was out of the field of view of MOS2 as it was operated in the small window mode. Therefore we analyzed the MOS1 and PN data obtained in the second observation. We performed the data reduction using the Science Analysis Software (SAS) version 19.0.0. The effective exposure times are 49 and 30 ks for MOS1 and PN, respectively.\n2.3 NuSTAR\nThe NuSTAR satellite (Harrison et al. 2013) realizes hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy. The two equipped co-aligned Walter-type I telescopes have almost the same field of view of 13 \u00d7 13 arcmin2, with an excellent PSF size of 58\u2032\u2032 in HPD. NuSTAR observes both the nucleus and the hotspot in a field of view and resolves them. The Focal Plane Module A and B (FPMA and FPMB) covers the energy range of 3\u2013 79 keV with the pixelized CdZnTe detector arrays.\nIn this work, we utilized the archival data aiming at the Pictor A nucleus (obs.ID 60101047002). The observation\nwas carried out between December 3 and 6 in 2015. For the NuSTAR data reduction and analysis, we used the software of NUSTARDAS ver. 2.0.0 and calibration database of CALDB ver. 20210524. We performed the data reduction using nupipeline script with the standard criteria for science observation, named \u201cSCIENCE.\u201d The resultant effective exposure is 109 ks.\n3 Analysis and result\n3.1 Image analysis\nBefore analyzing the NuSTAR and XMM-Newton images which are performed on the hotspot in this paper for the first time, we reviewed the spatial property of the hotspot on the Chandra image. We employed the observation of Obs.ID 4369, the aim point of which is located at the hotspot of our interest. The X-ray hotspot is clearly detected and is found to be slightly extended by 5\u2032\u2032, with a tiny central region providing the major contribution of the flux. In fact, the size of the hotspot is measured to be 1.\u2032\u20325 in HPD, which, we assume, corresponds to the \u201ccompact\u201d component named in Hardcastle et al. (2016). The morphology is consistent with the literature (Hardcastle et al. 2016; Thimmappa et al. 2020)."

We found no significant X-ray extension beyond the PSF, which is reasonable given the size determined by Chandra. There is no confusing source in the Chandra image.

The significance of this hard X-ray emission with NuSTAR was measured to be 30\u03c3 from the statistical error of the background.\nTo investigate the candidate hard X-ray emission of the hotspot, we evaluated the spatial properties quantitatively. We found that positions of the brightest pixels in FPMA and FPMB are 2.\u2032\u20325 and 2.\u2032\u20328 away from the position determined by Chandra, respectively. These are within the pointing uncertainty of NuSTAR of 8\u2032\u2032 (Harrison et al. 2013).\nThe apparent size is measured on the un-smoothed image (i.e., the raw image of figure 1b) as 35\u2032\u2032 in HPD, which is smaller than the NuSTAR PSF size of 58\u2032\u2032 in HPD. Therefore, the major emission from the object is considered to be a point-like object for NuSTAR. Since the evaluated soft X-ray hotspot size is negligible compared to the PSF of NuSTAR, the obtained image size is consistent with the hotspot. In addition, there is no other bright X-ray source around the hotspot in the Chandra image as mentioned above. Therefore, we safely conclude that the observed source is a hard X-ray counterpart of the hotspot. This is the first time that a jet termination hotspot has been detected in the energy range above 10 keV.\n3.2 Time variability analysis using Chandra data\nHardcastle et al. (2016) reported some interesting X-ray behavior\u2014a month-scale flux decrease of the hotspot. They suggested that it could be caused by energy losses of the highest-energy electrons. However, the flux decrease is accompanied by a spectral hardening, which may imply a flux decrease in the low-energy band (see, Hardcastle et al. 2016; Thimmappa et al. 2020). Here, we carefully examined the unexpected increase of molecular contamination on the detector surface, which reduces the effective area below the 1 keV band. In fact, a position dependence of the\nFig. 2. Count rates of the western hotspot and E0102. Upper panel: Low-energy band of 0.3\u20131.0 keV. Lower panel: High-energy band of 1.0\u20137.0 keV. The count rate of E0102 is scaled in comparison with the hotspot. The blue filled circle indicates the count rate of the hotspot and its number indicates a corresponding epoch. The open circle, open triangle, and open square indicate the E0102 at the mid-, high-, and low-Y positions, respectively. (Color online)\ncontamination is reported, although the time variation at the typical aim point is calibrated and corrected with the CALDB file (Plucinsky et al. 2018).\nWe investigated the time variation of the count rate of the hotspot in low-energy (0.3\u20131.0 keV), which is sensitive to contamination, and high-energy (1.0\u20137.0 keV) bands for comparison separately. We divided the observation data into nine epochs, according to Hardcastle et al. (2016), to show the time history of count rates in figure 2. In the low-energy band, the count rates in epochs 4, 6, 8, and\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pasj/article/74/3/602/6585093 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n9 are around 20% lower than those in the other epochs, while there is no significant fluctuation in the high-energy band.\nFigure 3 shows the source position on the detectors for each epoch. In epochs 4, 6, and 8, the hotspot is close to the chip gap or is observed by a different ACIS chip. In these cases, we cannot ignore the systematic uncertainties. To examine the apparent decrease in epoch 9, we also investigated the count-rate variation of a calibration source, the supernova remnant E0102, during this period. E0102 has been observed at three different locations on the detector, indicated as low-Y, mid-Y, and high-Y in figure 3. The obtained count rates are also shown in figure 2. We see the count rates on high- and low-Y positions have decreased since 2015. This trend implies that the contamination effect causes the apparent decrease of the count rates on lowand high-Y positions. The hotspot position in epoch 9 is near the high-Y location. Thus, we regard the apparent decrease in epoch 9 likely caused by artifacts (buildingup contaminants). The hotspot\u2019s location at epoch 8 is not exactly the same as that for E0102, but is located at the high-Y position where rapid increase of contaminants has been suggested. Therefore, the count-rate drop observed at epoch 8 would be caused not only by the effects of the chip gap but also by the possible contaminants. In this context, we argue that the flux decrease after epoch 8 might be affected by the detector response, particularly for the contaminants on the detector, although our\nargument does not completely exclude the flux variability reported in Hardcastle et al. (2016). It is important to evaluate the contamination build-up carefully, for more detailed investigations on the time variability. The results from the X-ray all-sky survey performed by eROSITA (Predehl et al. 2021) will provide us with an excellent opportunity for this purpose.\n3.3 Spectral analysis"

The spectra are connected smoothly, as expected from table 2 showing that the bestfitting parameters are almost consistent among different satellites within the calibration uncertainties (Madsen et al. 2017). Therefore, we performed a simultaneous fit using all the data. The data cover a broader energy range (0.2\u2013 20 keV) and have higher photon statistics than ever for this object. We simultaneously fitted the spectra by the absorbed power-law model with the fixed column density. The best-fitting model reproduced the spectrum well, with \u03c72/d.o.f. =577/551, as shown in figure 9. The derived bestfitting parameters, summarized in table 2, are consistent with the parameters derived from the individual spectrum.\nIn order to improve the fit, we fitted the data with the same model by allowing the hydrogen column density to vary. The best-fitting model eliminated slight residuals in 0.2\u20130.3 keV. The derived parameters are shown in table 2. This model gives \u03c72/d.o.f. = 563/550, indicating a statistically significant improvement with a null hypothesis probability of 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 calculated by the F-test. The derived column density of NH = (4.6 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 1020 atoms cm\u22122 is slightly higher than the Galactic value from HI4PI Collaboration (2016). In contrast, the others are statistically consistent with the case of the fixed column density. We see no spectral break in the wide-band spectra from which we excluded the Chandra spectrum below 1.5 keV.\nAs an advanced investigation, we searched for a spectral curvature. If the X-ray spectrum originates from an electron synchrotron emission, a high-energy exponential cut-off is naturally expected to correspond to the maximum energy of electrons. We examined the spectrum with a simple cutoff power-law model of tbabs*cutoffpl, and obtained the cut-off energy at >54 keV in the statistical significance level of 5% with \u03c72/d.o.f. = 608/552. As the energy of 54 keV is above the energy coverage of our data (0.2\u201320 keV), hereafter we adopt 20 keV as our conservative lower limit of the cut-off energy.\nIt is interesting to note the analogy with studies of supernova remnants (SNRs). Although X-ray synchrotron spectra in SNRs look similar to that observed in the Pictor A\u2019s western hotspot, they are interpreted differently\u2014the X-rays of SNRs are generally believed to be tails of power-law emission with an exponential cut-off below \u223c1 keV (see reviews in Helder et al. 2012; Vink 2012,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pasj/article/74/3/602/6585093 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nFig. 7.

(2021) revealed a power-law spectrum up to 30 keV, similar to the hotspot, and showed that it is reproduced by a power law with an exponential cutoff at \u223c0.5 keV. Therefore, one may think that the same interpretation could be applicable to the hotspot. However, the X-ray spectrum cannot be represented by the model of tbabs*srcut, which is the simple cut-off power-law model\nFig. 9.

            "text": "4.1 Origin of the X-ray emission\nThe X-ray emission mechanism of the Pictor A western hotspot has been discussed since the first clear detection by Chandra in Wilson, Young, and Shopbell (2001).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pasj/article/74/3/602/6585093 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nThe X-ray spectrum is brighter and harder than the extrapolation of the radio to optical synchrotron spectrum. It is known to be challenging to explain the X-ray via the SSC process because the X-ray and synchrotron radio emissions have different spectral indices and emission regions (Wilson et al. 2001; Thimmappa et al. 2020). It is considered plausible that the X-ray originates from a synchrotron emission of the electrons that is different from that corresponding to the radio to optical emission (see, e.g., Wilson et al. 2001; Hardcastle et al. 2004, 2016; Thimmappa et al. 2020).\nTingay et al. (2008) proposed that X-rays originate from the fine structures around the radio brightness peak, and Hardcastle et al. (2016) supported the scenario based on the time scale of the flux decrease. However, according to Hardcastle et al. (2016) and Thimmappa et al. (2020), a major part of the X-ray emission locates away from the radio fine structure. In addition, as has been checked in subsection 3.2, an instrumental effect (i.e., contamination) may contribute the observed flux drop, especially on the soft energy band, and thus the intrinsic variability may be reduced. Therefore, as pointed out by Thimmappa et al. (2020), it seems to be more reasonable that most of the X-rays are emitted from the thin shock front region.\n4.2 Accelerated electron energy distribution\nHotspots are believed to be sites of particle acceleration via the relativistic shock and a possible ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray accelerator (Hillas 1984; Kotera & Olinto 2011). Therefore the observational electron spectrum of the hotspot potentially provides us with essential information for the relativistic shock study.\nThe X-ray observations in a wide energy range with high statistics revealed the featureless power-law spectrum in 0.2\u201320 keV. The spectrum indicates that the X-ray emitting electrons are not responsible for the higher end of energy distribution (see section 3). Therefore we estimated the X-ray emitting electron\u2019s energy index (p), which is the important information on the acceleration process, from the X-ray photon index ( = 2.07 \u00b1 0.03) to be p = 2 \u2212 1 = 3.14 \u00b1 0.06.\nTo investigate the energy index of accelerated electrons, we should consider a synchrotron radiative cooling effect. If the cooling is effective in the observed energy range, the derived energy index of p is changed from the accelerated electron\u2019s one of pacc as p = pacc + 1 (see, Meisenheimer et al. 1989; Carilli et al. 1991). When a radiative lifetime in the energy band is shorter than a dynamical time scale, the cooling becomes effective (see, Inoue & Takahara 1996; Kino & Takahara 2004). The lifetime (\u03c4 syn) in a photon\nenergy of (Eph) is given from the magnetic field strength (B) as \u03c4syn 15 \u00d7 (\nEph 2 keV )\u2212(1/2) ( B 300 \u03bcG )\u2212(3/2) yr. (1)\nHere, we adopted the representative photon energy of 2 keV and the magnetic field of B = 300 \u03bcG calculated from the radio to optical synchrotron spectrum under the assumption of the minimum or equipartition energy condition (Meisenheimer et al. 1989; Isobe et al. 2017). On the other hand, the dynamical time scale must be longer than the light crossing time of L/c \u223c 3000 yr, where L is the hotspot size of \u223c1 kpc (Thomson et al. 1995; Perley et al. 1997; Tingay et al. 2008) and c is the speed of light. Therefore, the cooling is almost undoubtedly effective in the X-ray band, and the energy index of the accelerated electron is estimated as pacc = p \u2212 1 = 2.14 \u00b1 0.06. The index is close to the theoretical prediction in the diffusive shock acceleration under the strong shock condition of pacc = 2 or relativistic shock of pacc \u223c 2.4 (see, e.g., Bell 1978; Spitkovsky 2008).\nSeveral authors (e.g., Wilson et al. 2001; Aharonian 2002) have already pointed out the same electron energy index of the hotspot. However, the low statistics due to the only observation being that by Chandra allowed various X-ray spectral shapes. Our study tightly determines the Xray spectral shape and excludes the cut-off or cooling break feature in the X-ray band.\nIn addition to the spectral index, the maximum electron energy (Ee, max) is observationally estimated from the synchrotron cut-off energy (Ecut) as Ee,max 40 \u00d7 (\nEcut 20 keV )1/2 ( B 300 \u03bcG )\u22121 TeV. (2)\nFrom our study, there is a lower limit of the cut-off energy as Ecut > 20 keV (see section 3), which requires the lower limit for the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons Ee, max > 40 TeV.\nWe compared the maximum electron energy to blazars, which have spectral and environmental similarities with hotspots. Some observational and analytical studies estimated the maximum electron energy to be up to only a few TeV even in the TeV gamma-ray emitting blazars, which are believed to have the highest value among some types of blazar (see, e.g., Inoue & Takahara 1996; Kataoka et al. 1999; Kino et al. 2002; MAGIC Collaboration 2020). Therefore the synchrotron X-ray in the hotspots may reflect the highest energy electron in the AGN jet system.\nFor further investigations, we need to detect a higher energy spectrum and or other hotspots than in this study. Due to both lower X-ray flux and smaller angular offset from the nucleus in most hotspots than in the Pictor\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pasj/article/74/3/602/6585093 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nA western hotspot, it may be difficult for NuSTAR to detect other hotspots. We anticipate that future hard X-ray missions, which have better angular resolution and sensitivity than those of NuSTAR, for example, FORCE (Nakazawa et al. 2018), will vigorously promote this kind of study."
