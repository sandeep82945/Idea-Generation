1. **Investigate the use of additional features for device identification.** The proposed method relies on the data in the IE fields of PRs to identify unique devices. However, other features, such as the timing of PRs, the RSSI, and the ToA, could also be used to improve the accuracy of the method. Future research could explore the use of these additional features to further improve the performance of the proposed method.


2. **Develop a method for identifying devices that change their MAC addresses frequently.** Some devices change their MAC addresses frequently, which can make it difficult to track them using the proposed method. Future research could develop a method for identifying these devices and tracking them even when they change their MAC addresses.


3. **Explore the use of the proposed method for other applications.** The proposed method could be used for a variety of other applications, such as crowd counting, people tracking, and movement analysis. Future research could explore the use of the proposed method for these applications and investigate its performance in different scenarios.


4. **Investigate the use of the proposed method in combination with other technologies.** The proposed method could be used in combination with other technologies, such as computer vision and Bluetooth scanning, to improve the accuracy and robustness of device identification. Future research could explore the use of the proposed method in combination with these other technologies and investigate its performance in different scenarios.


5. **Develop a real-time implementation of the proposed method.** The proposed method is currently implemented as a batch process, which means that it can only be used to identify devices after the data has been collected. Future research could develop a real-time implementation of the proposed method, which would allow it to be used to identify devices as they are detected.
