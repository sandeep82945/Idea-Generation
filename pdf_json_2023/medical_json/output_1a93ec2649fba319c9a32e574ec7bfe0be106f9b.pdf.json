    "abstractText": "In response to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act being signed into law, several research groups in Colorado organized the First Annual PACT Act Research Symposium for Veteran Health. The 2-day symposium was interested in research relevant to military exposures with a primary focus on respiratory and mental health. Information on the PACT Act, data sources in the Department of Veteran Affairs and DOD, and research opportunities at the Veteran Affairs were presented. The morning session centered on respiratory health, highlighting research conducted over the last two decades regarding deployment-related respiratory diseases. Despite the high prevalence of mental health disorders among Veterans, information presented during the afternoon sessions on mental health highlighted the dearth of research to date regarding psychological health and military-related exposures. Policymakers, clinicians, and researchers were encouraged to adopt a life-course approach when conceptualizing physical and psychological exposures. On the second day of meetings, a smaller group of participants discussed next steps in military exposure research, as well as priorities for future research. Per the latter, recommendations for future research were made regarding the need for more precise exposure characterization, longitudinal data collection, and efforts to increase understanding regarding disease pathogenesis, as well as the impact of exposures across multiple organs. Such efforts will require interdisciplinary collaboration. *Veterans Health Administration, Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) for Veteran Suicide Prevention, Rocky Mountain Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center (RMRVAMC), Aurora, CO 80045, USA \u2020Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA \u2021Military and Veteran Microbiome: Consortium for Research and Education (MVM-CoRE), Aurora, CO 80045, USA \u00a7Department of Systems Engineering and Management, Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433, USA Department of Integrative Physiology, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309, USA \u00b6Center for Neuroscience and Center for Microbial Exploration, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309, USA **Center for Neuroscience, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA \u2020\u2020Veterans Health Administration, Eastern Colorado Health Care System, Rocky Mountain Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center (RMRVAMC), Aurora, CO 80045, USA \u2021\u2021Division of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA \u00a7\u00a7Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, USA Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, CO 80045, USA INTRODUCTION Many individuals who served in the U.S. Armed Services were exposed to military-related toxicants, either while stationed on a permanent base or in deployed locations ranging from Vietnam to Southwest Asia.

Health effects are variable and can affect multiple organ systems associated with many conditions (e.g., respiratory diseases, mental health diseases, cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, and chronic multisymptom illness [e.g., Gulf War Illness]).\nThe Sergeant First Class Health Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins (PACT) Act was signed into U.S. law on August 10, 2022 (PACT Act, public law 117\u2013168). The PACT Act includes significant expansion of benefits and associated services to U.S. Veterans exposed to toxicants including expanded eligibility to Veteran Affairs (VA) health care. Over 20 additional presumptive conditions were introduced related to exposure to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic exposures, as well as additional presumptive exposure locations for Agent Orange and radiation. In addition, per the PACT Act, the Veteran Health Administration is required to provide toxic exposure screening to every Veteran to identify cases and increase knowledge. Notably, the PACT Act also expands research, education, and treatment regarding toxic exposures.\nIn an effort to increase understanding regarding the current state of science and clinical practice relevant to the PACT Act, the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center (Aurora, CO) hosted the First Annual PACT Act Research Symposium for Veteran Health, May 3 and 4, 2023. The event was organized by the team at the VA Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center and partners in the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Research Service and at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus. The symposium focused on the research relevant to deployed military exposures with a morning session dedicated to respiratory health and an afternoon session on mental health. Speakers also discussed the PACT Act, VA data availability, current and planned clinical practices, and opportunities for engaging in research at the VA (see Table I for speaker information on May 3). Nearly 200 people participated in the hybrid (webinar, in person) event and 25 participating researchers gathered on May 4 to discuss the next steps. Full details on the event, including presentation slides and videos of the presentations, can be found online (https://www.mirecc.va.gov/visn19/pact_ act_symposium/index.asp)."

Two decades of post-9/11 DRRD research (epidemiologic, clinical, and translational) were summarized, along with data regarding health outcomes from toxic exposures in the First Gulf War Era Cohort Study. Current areas of DRRD research included respiratory health effects from jet fuel and polyaromatic hydrocarbon exposure; inflammatory effects of PM on human airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophage gene expression; and identification of proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic biomarkers of burn pit emissions and respirable PM exposures. Mechanistic studies are\nlaying the groundwork for emerging DRRD treatment trials, such as a study of L-citrulline supplementation in Veterans with suboptimally controlled deployment-related asthma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05259904).\nSeveral respiratory research themes emerged that currently require additional research: (1) better exposure characterization1; (2) DRRD clinical and longitudinal outcomes; (3) disease pathogenesis to inform evidence-based treatments; and (4) integrated multiorgan and multidisciplinary collaboration. Along with current efforts to characterize military exposures (e.g., Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry), additional approaches to understanding individual exposures are needed that can be incorporated into the VA standardized electronic medical record. Retrospective exposure characterization could be explored through biomarkers (e.g., omics, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, or Raman spectroscopy), research that is now being expanded in animal and artificial intelligence models. To better understand disease pathogenesis, the bidirectional interactions between lung\u2013brain, lung\u2013gut, and gut\u2013brain axes are areas of particular interest. Other research priorities identified by the group included the following: (1) risk factors, endotypes, and mechanisms of deployment-related asthma; (2) distal small airway inflammation leading to bronchiolitis, emphysema, and hyperinflation2; (3) exercise limitation and mitochondrial dysfunction3; (4) exposure and epigenetic effects of DDRD; (5) epidemiological trends and outcomes in those with DDRD; and (6) effects on mental health, aging, and neurodegenerative disease. There was enthusiasm for research on the integration of multiorgan system outcomes and effect modifiers secondary to military occupational exposures. Several participants endorsed a life course and an integrated exposome approach to account for inhalational hazards across multiple time points, environmental conditions (e.g., climate and pollutants), life events (e.g., trauma and stress), individual characteristics (e.g., gender and race), and individual lifestyle choices (e.g., diet, exercise, and substance use).4"

Such efforts would be expected to provide the foundational work necessary to develop innovative treatment approaches. For example, a proof-of-concept model of regional air pollution combined with longitudinal mental health surveys and disease outcomes may enable an increased understanding of the connections between pollutants and health outcomes. A bench approach through mouse modeling10 was also presented to identify mechanisms by which exposures and stress may interact to affect disease risk, severity, and prognosis. Finally, resources for collaboration, funding, and combined efforts with pre- and post-deployment support were discussed to improve outcomes while increasing the quality of life for current Veterans through rapid translation of new findings. The post-symposium meeting focused on identifying research priorities with a focus on inflammation (or the inflammatory process) as a key mechanism of action. There was a consensus regarding the importance of designing studies to evaluate the impact of exposures across organ systems (e.g., lung\u2013brain axis) with the goal of highlighting novel treatment targets and strategies (e.g., anti-inflammatory agents). Discussion also focused on the potential importance of targeting mitochondrial functioning and exercise rehabilitation.

A potential near-term solution included increased holistic screening and sample collection (e.g., plasma) at the point of clinical care. Specifically, this would require asking \u201cthe right questions\u201d at the \u201cright times\u201d (e.g., age at, duration of, and nature of exposures over time).

Sec. 507).\nInterests in the relationships between toxic exposures, respiratory diseases, and mental health outcomes were discussed in terms of the growing recognition regarding a lung\u2013gut\u2013brain axis influencing the immune reactivity of the central nervous system compartment, including the resident innate immune cells of the brain (e.g., microglia).12 Chronic multisymptom illness may involve signaling within the bidirectional lung\u2013brain\u2013gut axis.13 Understanding of multiorgan, multisymptom outcomes of toxic exposurerelated illnesses will benefit from a multidisciplinary and collaborative research team approach.\nExisting resources, such as the longitudinal samples within the Military and Veteran Microbiome: Consortium for Research and Education, which includes longitudinal (i.e., every 6 months) sampling of skin, oral, and gut microbiomes in association with extensive assessment of physical and mental health outcomes, or targeted expansion of these resources may prove to be useful for future studies. A major challenge moving forward is to determine with precision the influence of time-limited toxic exposures (e.g., over a period of 6\u201312 months), in the context of preexisting vulnerabilities,14 and potential differential outcomes of multiple, repeated toxic\nexposures and their interaction with other physical and psychosocial stressor exposures on health outcomes over the lifespan. Of particular interest in this regard are the impacts of military exposures on peripheral immune signaling, inflammation, and neuroinflammation, which are exaggerated with advanced age.15 A final step will be identifying multitargeted interventions with the potential to influence immune signaling and inappropriate disease-related inflammation, as well as minimizing negative health outcomes across the lifespan."

Indeed, participants in the event recognized other individuals and groups (e.g., Defense Health Agency, other DoD agencies, and international partners) that should be included in future events. Additional research must include individuals from diverse disciplines, biological (e.g., inflammation and gut\u2013lung\u2013brain axis) and biobehavioral/biopsychosocial (e.g., life events, mental health, and physical health). A funded multidisciplinary research consortium could accelerate the progress of bench-to-bedside translational efforts that could provide central biorepositories of samples and data and infrastructure with shared research personnel and resources to help break down traditional silos."
