"This entropyâ€“enthalpy compensation in the activation energy of the oxygen-evolution step is still insufficiently understood and requires further investigation (work in progress). To this end, the experimental determination of the entropy and enthalpy of activation for various organisms as well as for PSII with genetically modified H-bond networks could address both (i) a possible physiological role in the genetic adaptation of various organisms to different environmental temperatures; and (ii) the elucidation of the molecular determinants (in terms of differing amino acid environments) of the experimentally observable shifts between the enthalpy and entropy of activation, complemented by computational investigation."
