conclusions A synthetic co-culture composed of A. neopropionicum and C. kluyveri was demonstrated to produce valerate and heptanoate from solely ethanol and CO2 as substrates. In bioreactor cultivation, the co-culture tolerated concentrations of at least 300  mM ethanol (13.8  g L−1) and yielded a maximum of 37% OCCAs. Our results showed that controlling ethanol use is favourable for OCCA production, and that tuning of pH could further boost chain elongation in this co-culture. Moreover, experiments with pure cultures of C. kluyveri revealed the negative effects of propionate on its growth, which are reversed when acetate is present. Further work is needed to verify the hypothesis that C. kluyveri deals with propionate/propionyl-CoA toxicity by performing excessive ethanol oxidation, which would explain the observed shift towards even-chain products during chain elongation of propionate. In view of the results, we propose that the A. neopropionicum–C. kluyveri co-culture could be integrated with the syngas fermentation platform to upgrade ethanol to OCCAs. Altogether, our work shows the potential of synthetic microbial co-cultures to serve as platforms for innovative biotechnological processes.
