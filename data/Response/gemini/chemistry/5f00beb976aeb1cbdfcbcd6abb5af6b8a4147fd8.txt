1. **Investigate the potential of using SLs in combination with other eco-friendly approaches for CyanoHABs mitigation.** For instance, SLs could be combined with ultrasound, hydrogen peroxide, or copper sulfate to enhance their degradation efficiency and reduce the overall cost of treatment.


2. **Explore the use of SLs for the degradation of other harmful algal species.** Besides cyanobacteria, there are various other harmful algal species that can cause algal blooms, such as dinoflagellates, diatoms, and raphidophytes. Investigating the effectiveness of SLs against these species could expand their application range and contribute to a more comprehensive approach to harmful algal bloom management.


3. **Study the long-term effects of SLs on aquatic ecosystems.** While SLs are generally considered biodegradable and environmentally friendly, their long-term effects on aquatic ecosystems are not fully understood. Research in this area could assess the potential impacts of SLs on non-target organisms, such as zooplankton, fish, and aquatic plants, and evaluate their persistence and accumulation in the environment.


4. **Investigate the potential of SLs for the removal of cyanotoxins.** Cyanotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that can pose significant health risks to humans and animals. Exploring the ability of SLs to degrade or adsorb cyanotoxins could provide an additional strategy for mitigating the harmful effects of cyanobacterial blooms.


5. **Develop SL-based biosensors for the early detection of CyanoHABs.** SLs have been shown to exhibit specific interactions with cyanobacterial cells. This property could be harnessed to develop biosensors that can detect the presence of cyanobacteria in water bodies at an early stage, enabling timely intervention and preventing the development of harmful blooms.
