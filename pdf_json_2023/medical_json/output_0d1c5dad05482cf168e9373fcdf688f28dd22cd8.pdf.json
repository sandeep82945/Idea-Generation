            "text": "The genetic basis of adaptive traits has rarely been used to predict future vulnerability of populations to climate change. We show that light versus dark seasonal pelage in white-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii) tracks snow cover and is primarily determined by genetic\nvariation at Endothelin Receptor B (EDNRB), Corin Serine Peptidase (CORIN), and Agouti 5\nSignaling Protein (ASIP). Winter color variation was associated with deeply divergent alleles at these genes, reflecting selection on both ancestral and introgressed variation. Forecasted reductions in snow cover are likely to induce widespread camouflage mismatch. However, simulated populations with variation for darker winter pelage are predicted to adapt rapidly,\nproviding a trait-based genetic framework to facilitate evolutionary rescue. These discoveries 10\ndemonstrate how the genetic basis of climate change adaptation can inform conservation.\nOne-Sentence Summary: Future adaptation to snow cover depends on standing genetic variation for winter camouflage in white-tailed jackrabbits.\nPreservation of genetic diversity is a primary goal of conservation biology (1), reflecting the critical role that genetic variation plays in promoting rapid adaptation to environmental change (2, 3). While there has been progress in dissecting the genetic basis of adaptation in some species (4\u20136), rarely has such information been used to guide the conservation of populations (7, 8).\nThese shortcomings reflect the difficulties of genetic mapping in natural populations (9) and 5\nusing genotype-to-phenotype maps to facilitate adaptive responses (7).\nCircannual shifts in morphology, physiology, and behavior cued by changes in\nphotoperiod allow many species to buffer the challenges of seasonal environments (10). Seasonal molts to winter-white pelage and plumage have evolved in at least five animal families to\nmaintain crypsis in snow-covered environments (11). Winter coloration has been directly tied to 10\nsurvival in snowshoe hares (12, 13) and several species appear vulnerable to camouflage mismatch caused by global snow cover declines (14\u201318). We examined how snow cover variation has shaped the evolution and future adaptive potential of winter camouflage in whitetailed jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii), a North American species undergoing widespread\npopulation declines (19). 15\nWinter coat color tracks variation in snow cover across the white-tailed jackrabbit range Winter coat color varies from brown to white across the white-tailed jackrabbit distribution (11, 20). We used 1312 georeferenced records to estimate a species distribution model (Fig. 1 and\nFig. S1 and S2A) (21), and used climate covariates and 196 museum specimens with mostly 20\nwhite or brown pelage to build a probabilistic model of winter coloration across the range (Fig. 1A, Tables S1 and S2).\nConsistent with previous work (11), the probability of an animal having white pelage increased with snow cover duration and a correlate of snow seasonality (mean diurnal temperature range) and decreased with an index of snow transience (isothermality; Table S1). Our model predicted a mosaic of winter-white or -brown populations separated by zones of intermediate coat color\nprobabilities. We found a steep winter color gradient between the Rocky Mountains and the 5\nGreat Plains of Colorado (Fig. 1C), which included a previously described population with continuous coat color variation (20).\nThe genetic basis of winter coat color\nTo dissect the genetic basis of winter color variation, we sequenced (62.5; Table S3, Data S1 10\nand S2) and assembled a white-tailed jackrabbit genome (48.03 Mb scaffold N50; Table S3). We also sequenced 74 genomes from the coat color polymorphic zone in Colorado (Fig. 1C) to low coverage (~1.8; Table S4), of which seven genomes were also re-sequenced to moderate\ncoverage (~12.2; Data S1 and Table S6). Analysis of 239,834 unlinked single-nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) showed weak population structure partitioned across two genetic clusters 15\nnot broadly coincident with coat color variation (Fig. S3E; between-cluster weighted fixation index, FST = 0.036). Spectrophotometric analysis of six dorsal regions (Fig. S4) uncovered considerable variation in dorsal brightness, hue, and contrast (n=61, 51% variance PC1; Fig. S4, 5A and 5D), variegation (14.6% variance PC2; Fig. S4, 5B and 5E), and mottling (7.5% variance\nPC3; Fig. S4, 5C and 5F). White versus brown categories used in our binary phenotypic model 20\n(Fig. 1) consistently partitioned continuous color variation along PC1 (Fig. S4B). Genome-wide association tests between 5,557,716 SNPs and PC1 of the spectrophotometric data revealed significant associations robust to population structure on two scaffolds, each containing one gene involved in melanogenesis (Fig. 2 and Fig. S6).\nOne association centered on Corin Serine Peptidase (CORIN; Fig. 2B; P = 7.26  10-16),\na serine peptidase expressed in hair follicles that acts as a downstream suppressor of the Agouti Signaling Protein (ASIP) (22). Loss-of-function mutations in CORIN have been associated with enlarged pheomelanin bands and lighter pelage in tigers (23) and mice (24). The other\nassociation centered on the Endothelin Receptor B (EDNRB, Fig. 2D; P = 3.31  10-22), a G-5\nprotein coupled receptor essential to developmental migration and differentiation of melanocyte precursors (25, 26). EDNRB mutations cause white piebald spotting due to absence of melanocytes (27). For both genes, top associated variants were non-coding, consistent with a regulatory basis of seasonal camouflage variation.\nWe also performed association tests on all 74 jackrabbits, binning color as white or 10\nbrown, and found two additional associations. One overlapped a non-coding region (P = 1.29  10-14; Fig. S6B and S7) near genes from the alpha-2-macroglobulin gene family, which have been linked to reproduction (28\u201330), and may reflect a correlated seasonal trait. The other overlapped ASIP (P = 1.38  10-14; Fig. 6B), a well-known signaling protein that shifts\nmelanogenesis to lighter phaeomelanin production or inhibits pigment production (31). ASIP has 15\nbeen associated with discrete winter coat color polymorphisms in snowshoe and mountain hares (6, 32).\nWe next used mass spectrometry to generate high confidence genotypes for 59\njackrabbits with spectrophotometric data at 34 linked SNPs (average within-gene r2 > 0.93)\nacross CORIN (n=13), EDNRB (n=9), and ASIP (n=12) (Fig. S8; Data S1 and S3). CORIN (P = 20\n6.82 x 10-9) and EDNRB (P = 7.73 x 10-12) alleles remained strongly associated with PC1 (Tables S7 and S8), showing largely additive (Fig. 2C, E; all P > 0.05, dominance deviation test; Tables S9, and S10) and independent effects (P > 0.05; Fig. 2F, Fig. S9; Table S11). ASIP was not associated when including the other genes as covariates (Tables S7 and S8), but we detected\nepistatic interactions between the top associated SNPs at ASIP and CORIN (P < 0.05; Table S11), consistent with known molecular interactions between these genes (22). A linear model of the top associated SNPs from each gene explained 65% of phenotypic variation (model D, Table S12). While a precise estimate of effect sizes awaits more sampling, winter camouflage in white-\ntailed jackrabbits appears to be primarily determined by large-effect additive genetic variation at 5\nCORIN and EDNRB, with a minor contribution of ASIP.\nMultigenic winter camouflage adaptation is shaped by selection on ancient genetic polymorphisms and gene flow between species\nGenome-wide comparisons among white-tailed jackrabbit genomes revealed increased scaled 10\nabsolute genetic divergence between winter-white and winter-brown associated alleles of CORIN, EDNRB, and ASIP (Z-score \u2265 3; Fig.3A and Fig. S10), indicating that seasonal camouflage variation did not arise from recent mutations in white-tailed jackrabbits. To examine the history of these genes, we combined white-tailed jackrabbit genomes with 10 new and 19\npreviously published (6, 32\u201336) genomes (~7.5 \u2013 33.5; Table S6) from nine other Lepus 15\nspecies, including four showing seasonal camouflage (Data S1). Genome-wide analysis clustered white-tailed jackrabbits with three other color-changing species (Fig. 3B; Fig. S11; Table S13). CORIN, EDNRB, and ASIP showed discordant local genealogies whereby winter-brown alleles from white-tailed jackrabbits grouped with black-tailed jackrabbits, a winter-brown species,\nwhile winter-white alleles grouped with closely related winter-white species (Fig. 3B and Fig. 20\nS12). The estimated divergence time between the white and brown haplotypes exceeded three million years (myr) at all three genes [EDNRB = 4.2 myr (95% HPD 3.3-5.0 myr); CORIN = 3.3 myr (95% HPD 2.9-4.3 myr); ASIP = 3.1 myr (95% HPD 2.4-3.7 myr); Fig. S13], suggesting a common ancestor near the onset of Lepus diversification (37). Deep phylogenetic discordance at\neach gene could reflect gene flow from another species (38). Consistent with this, divergence across an ~88 kb interval overlapping ASIP was reduced between black-tailed jackrabbits and the white-tailed jackrabbit brown allele relative to simulated expectations (Fig. 3C, Fig. S14B-C and Table S14). By contrast, the white allele showed normal levels of divergence to other winter-\nwhite hares (Fig. 3D and Fig. S14D). Black- and white-tailed jackrabbits occupy similar prairie 5\nhabitats with overlapping ranges and show substantial genome-wide introgression (D-statistic = 0.19, P << 0.0001; 4% admixture, P << 0.0001). The persistence of introgressed alleles, a binary association (Fig. S6B), and a central role in color evolution (31) suggest that ASIP contributes to a component of color variation not captured by our measurements. This is the third instance of\nintrogression at ASIP contributing to winter camouflage in hares (Fig. 3B) (6, 32), suggesting 10\nthat some genes may be evolutionary hotspots for adaptive introgression (39).\nThe evolutionary processes shaping variation at CORIN and EDRNB were less clear.\nDivergence (dxy) between black-tailed jackrabbits and the brown-associated intervals of both genes were not unusually shallow (Fig. 3C), as expected with recent introgression. However,\ncloser inspection revealed local phylogenetic variation consistent with ancient gene flow (Fig. 15\nS14). While the causative mutations remain unknown, top associated SNPs at both genes fell outside putative introgression tracts. These patterns suggest a history of recombination among ancient color alleles at CORIN and EDRNB, likely maintained by long-term spatially varying selection (40). Collectively, these findings indicate that multigenic winter camouflage adaptation\n(Fig. 1), shaped by selection on standing and introgressed variation (Fig. 3), has long been 20\nimportant to white-tailed jackrabbit survival.\nFuture climate change vulnerability and adaptive potential of seasonal camouflage variation\nSeasonal snow cover is predicted to decline over the next century (41), which may reduce the adaptive value of winter-white coats (11). To understand how jackrabbit camouflage might evolve in response to climate change, we forecasted winter coat color probabilities for the year 2080 based on correlates of snow residence time, seasonality, and transience (Figs. S2D-F, 4A).\nWe used forecasts under a high CO2 emissions scenario (RCP8.5) to model challenging, though 5\nnot unlikely (42), conditions jackrabbits may experience in the future. Under this model, winterbrown coats (P(brown) \u2265 0.8) will be strongly favored across much of the southern (USA) range (~49% at P(brown) \u2265 0.8 in 2080; Fig. S2B, E, F), a 3.1-fold increase over historical conditions (16% at P(brown) \u2265 0.8). While the rate of mismatch will depend on which emissions scenario\ntranspires, future reductions in snow cover are likely to induce widespread camouflage mismatch 10\n(Fig. 4A) given strong correlations of forecasted parameters across emission scenarios (21).\nPrevious work proposed that standing variation for seasonal camouflage could promote\nrapid evolutionary rescue in species threatened by diminished snow cover (11). To understand if the genetic basis of camouflage inferred from Colorado populations may facilitate evolutionary\nrescue more broadly, we sequenced 69 additional white-tailed jackrabbit genomes from across 15\nthe range (~2.1; Table S5). Although winter phenotypes were mostly unknown for these\nsamples, we found low genetic structure (FST = 0.020 Colorado versus North Dakota; Fig. S15) and color-associated polymorphisms outside of Colorado at all three genes (Fig. S15). Moreover, the presence of white alleles at the three genes was positively correlated with snow cover\nduration across the range (r = 0.33-0.46, p < 0.05; Fig. S16). Therefore, multigenic color-20\nassociated variation appears functionally relevant and broadly shared across the range.\nNext, we simulated the capacity for populations with the largest forecasted mismatch\n(\u0394P(brown) = 0.75) to adapt to changes in snow cover. Focusing on large-effect variation at CORIN and EDRNB, we found that populations without winter-brown alleles trended towards extinction,\nwhile populations with winter-brown alleles could adapt rapidly. Evolutionary rescue was likely even under a high-emissions scenario and when adaptive winter-brown alleles were initially rare (Fig. 4B, Fig. S17 and S18). However, the efficacy of selection depended on genetic dominance. Fully recessive winter-brown variation, as found in other hares (6, 32), was associated with\nslower responses and larger population declines (Fig. 4B and Fig. S18). Thus, the capacity for 5\nevolutionary rescue to buffer against future population declines in this and other species confronted by seasonal mismatch (11) will depend on local demography, the genetic architecture of adaptive traits, and frequencies of adaptive alleles (3).\nTowards a framework for prioritizing and facilitating conservation efforts 10\nOptimism that standing variation could enable evolutionary rescue in the face of camouflage mismatch is tempered by widespread population declines in white-tailed jackrabbits caused by habitat alteration, extermination, shifts in predator communities, and climate change (19) coupled with the emerging threat of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (43). Using regional\nconservation assessments (19), we found that populations predicted to harbor winter-brown 15\nvariation (P(brown) \u2265 0.8) have disproportionally experienced local declines or extirpations (Pearson\u2019s 2 test P value = 2.2 x 10-16; Cram\u00e9r\u2019s V = 0.31; Fig. 4B and Fig. S2C). Given these\nthreats, our predictive map of climate-induced camouflage mismatch (Fig. 4A) provides an initial framework for prioritizing conservation efforts. Adaptive potential may be enhanced through\nlocal management actions aimed at reducing anthropogenic stressors and promoting connectivity 20\nbetween populations harboring critical winter-brown variation. Our findings also enable quantification of color-associated variation in vulnerable populations using any DNA source without knowledge of winter phenotypes. In the absence of connectivity or standing variation,\nour simulations suggest that local adaptation could be accelerated by modest amounts of humanassisted gene flow to mismatched populations (44).\nSafeguarding the adaptive potential of populations is central for conservation (1), yet the\ngenetic basis of adaptation is rarely incorporated into applied conservation planning (11, 45).\nLandscape genomic approaches have proven useful for uncovering adaptive genetic variation 5\nand climate change vulnerability without knowledge of phenotypes (46, 47). Our results show why a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of adaptive traits may also be needed to predict future responses of populations threatened by climate change and how such insights may be applied to facilitate evolutionary rescue.\n10"
