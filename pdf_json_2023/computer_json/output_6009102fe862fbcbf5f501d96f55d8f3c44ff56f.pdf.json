    "abstractText": "Purpose To study the influence of sex, age and thyroid function indices on dual\u2010energy computed tomography (DECT)\u2010derived quantitative parameters of thyroid in patients with or without Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (HT). Material and methods A total of 198 consecutive patients who underwent DECT scan of neck due to unilateral thyroid lesions were retrospectively enrolled. Iodine concentration (IC), total iodine content (TIC) and volume of normal thyroid lobe were calculated. Influences of sex, age and thyroid function indices on DECT\u2010derived parameters in overall study population, subgroup patients with, and those without HT were assessed using Mann\u2013Whitney U test, Student\u2019s T\u2010test, and Spearman correlation analyses, respectively, as appropriate. Results HT group showed significantly lower IC and TIC, while higher volume than No\u2010HT group (all p < 0.001). The volume was larger in male than that in female in overall study population and No\u2010HT group (p = 0.047 and 0.010, respectively). There was no significant difference in any DECT\u2010derived parameters between low (\u2264 35 years) and high (> 35 years) age group in all three groups (all p > 0.05). TPOAb and TgAb correlated positively with IC and TIC, and negatively with volume in overall study population (all p < 0.05). TPOAb and TgAb also correlated positively with IC in HT group (p = 0.002 and 0.007, respectively). Conclusion DECT\u2010derived parameters of thyroid differed significantly between patients with and without HT. Sex and thyroid function indices could affect the DECT\u2010derived parameters. Aforementioned physiological factors should be considered when analyzing the DECT\u2010derived parameters of thyroid.",

TPOAb and TgAb also correlated positively with IC in HT group (p = 0.002 and 0.007, respectively). Conclusion DECT\u2011derived parameters of thyroid differed significantly between patients with and without HT. Sex and thyroid function indices could affect the DECT\u2011derived parameters. Aforementioned physiological factors should be considered when analyzing the DECT\u2011derived parameters of thyroid.\nKeywords Thyroid, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, Iodine concentration, Total iodine content, Dual\u2011energy computed tomography\n\u2020Di Geng and Yan Zhou contributed equally to this work\n*Correspondence: Xiao\u2011Quan Xu xiaoquanxu_1987@163.com Fei\u2011Yun Wu wfy_njmu@163.com 1 Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No. 300, Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, People\u2019s Republic of China\n2 Department of Thyroid Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, People\u2019s Republic of China"

            "text": "Iodine\u00a0is an essential microelement that was closely associated with the synthesis of thyroid\u00a0hormone [1]. Several thyroid disorders can lead to the abnormal iodine\u00a0intake and metabolism, and subsequently result in the changes of the iodine concentration (IC) and total iodine content (TIC) within the thyroid gland (TG) [2, 3]. Previously, Binh et\u00a0 al. have reported that the IC of TG correlated negatively with the iodine uptake at 3\u00a0h after oral administration of 123I in patients with Graves disease [4]. It indicates that accurately assessing the IC of TG can effectively assist in evaluating the iodine turnover, and then predicting the curative effect. In the past, iodine uptake and function was usually assessed using thyroid scintigraphy, however radioactive iodine is needed for this method [5]. To find a relatively simple and robust method for quantifying IC and TIC of the TG is urgently needed in clinical practice.\nDual-source dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), equipped with two X-ray tubes producing two different X-ray spectra, enables iodine-water material decomposition and provides a material-specific imaging method called iodine map [6, 7]. Previous phantom studies have reported that there were strong correlations between IC measured by DECT and true IC [8, 9]. Although Iida et\u00a0 al. have reported a linear relationship between CT number and IC of the TG [10], the effects of density and effective atomic number of tissue constituent on Hounsfield unit values should not be ignored [11]. By contrast, measuring IC based on DECT-derived iodine map might assess iodine\u00a0 nutritional\u00a0 status of thyroid more accurately.\nRecently, the influences of physiological factors such as age, sex and thyroid functional status on CT or DECTderived parameters have been studied increasingly [12\u2013 15]. Yi et\u00a0al. has reported a positive correlation between thyroid CT density and age in children [12]. Meanwhile, Li et\u00a0 al. has found that the TIC in TG measured using DECT correlated positively with free triiodothyronine (FT3), but correlated negatively with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), while the mean IC of TG was positively correlated with both FT3 and total triiodothyronine (TT3) in euthyroid patients [15]. Besides that, Rho et\u00a0al. has reported that some diffuse thyroid disease (e.g. Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis [HT]) could also result in inhomogeneous low attenuation of thyroid on CT images due to hypo-function [16]. However, to the best of our acknowledge, the study evaluating the influence of physiological factors (e.g. sex, age, thyroid function indices) on the volume, IC, and TIC in TG measured using DECT in both healthy subjects and patients with diffuse thyroid diseases is still lacked until now.\nTherefore, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of sex, age and thyroid function indices on these DECTderived quantitative parameters in patients with or without HT."

We included the study population according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients with ultrasound-confirmed unilateral thyroid nodule, and with normal contralateral thyroid for further measurement; (2) patients without history of thyroid surgery or radioiodine therapy before ultrasound and DECT examination; (3) patients with available thyroid function results (e.g. FT3, free thyroxine [FT4], TSH, thyroid peroxidase antibody [TPOAb], and thyroglobulin antibody [TgAb]) tested within one week interval of DECT; (4) the imaging quality of DECT was adequate for subsequent analysis.\nFinally, a total of 198 patients were enrolled in this study including 116 patients without HT (No-HT) and 82 patients with HT (Table\u00a01). The diagnosis of HT was based on the pathological examination or the combination of clinical features, anti-thyroid antibodies and ultrasonographic characteristics [17]. Finally, there were 190 patients underwent puncture biopsy or surgery subsequently and obtained pathological specimens. Among 82 patients with HT, 20 patients were diagnosed based on the combination of clinical findings, levels of thyroid function parameters (mainly to TPOAb and TgAb), and patterns on ultrasound by an endocrinologist with 19\u00a0years of experience. As to the remaining 62 patients, the diagnosis of HT was established based on surgical pathology (60 patients obtained by subsequent postoperative pathology and 2 patients obtained by subsequent biopsy pathology)."

The extent of ROIs was slightly smaller than the border of thyroid lobe for avoiding the influence of partial volume effect. After ROIs were placed, the\nIC would be automatically obtained.

These immunopathologic\u00a0 mechanisms might be the potential reasons for the differences of DECT parameters between HT and No-HT patients.\nIn this study, males were found to have higher volume of normal thyroid lobes than females in the overall study population and No-HT group, which was in agreement with previous studies measured by ultrasound [21, 22]. In other words, sex had an influence on the thyroid volume except in HT group. We speculated that, in the subgroup of HT, the thyroid volume was more closely associated with the disease process of HT itself. Besides that, female held a higher\u00a0incidence of HT which was mostly characterized by goiter than male [23]. Summing up the above, the influence of sex was weakened in HT group.\nThe differences in DECT parameters between two age subgroups were not observed in our study, which indicated that age did not play an important role on IC, TIC and volume of normal thyroid lobe. Previously, Lee et\u00a0al. reported a negative relationship between thyroid volume and age [24], while other surveys did not show significant correlation between decreasing thyroid volume and increasing age [21, 25]. In the future, larger scale study was needed to clarify, the relationship between thyroid volume and age. Additionally, Pandey et\u00a0al. did not observe a significant correlation between thyroid CT density and age [14], which was similar to our results.\nWe found significant correlations between DECT parameters and TPOAb or TgAb concentrations, especially in the overall study population. Both two thyroid autoantibodies were produced by lymphocytes within the TG [26]. In previous studies, the titers of serum TPOAb and TgAb had been reported to be positively correlated with an increased inflammatory reaction. Both of them reflected the degree of lymphocytic infiltration in the gland, and had been proven to be a risk factor of hypothyroidism [27\u201329]. Thereby,\u00a0 the higher titers of serum TPOAb and TgAb would contribute to\u00a0lower IC and TIC, while higher volume of normal thyroid lobe. In addition, our present study indicated that there was a positive correlation between the volume of normal thyroid lobe and serum FT3 level in HT group, which was consistent with the study carried out by Kawasaki et\u00a0al. [30]. They reported that HT patients with large goiters tended to had relatively high serum FT3 levels, and they attributed this result to the elevation of thyroidal deiodinase activity in HT patients.\nPrevisous studies have indicated that DECT was useful in the preoperative differentiation between benign and malignant cervical lymph modes (LNs) in the patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) [31, 32]. However, as\nwe know, the proliferation of autoreactive T and B cells would lead to the reactive hyperplasia of cervical LNs in the patients with HT [33], which subsequently result in the enlarged size and increased enhancement in LNs showed on DECT. This situation would increase the difficulty in differentiating reactive from metastatic LNs, which might be associated with the higher number of dissected LNs while similar rate of malignant LNs in the patients with HT [34]. All these results showed that, being aware of the medical history of thyroiditis or thyroid function indicators was important when diagnosing the metastatic cervical LNs, however, these information were not always available when we are analyzing the DECT data. Our study found that DECT-derived quantitative parameters were affected by Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis status and correlated with levels of anti-thyroid antibodies. DECTderived parameters of thyroid could serve as a crucial reference for the radiologists to predict the thyroiditis status, and then individually and accurately evaluate the potential metastasis of LNs, thereby assisting the clinicians in establishing the surgical plans. Furthermore, this study also found that DECT-derived parameters were related to sex, but not to age, so the sex difference should be taken into account in the DECT imaging-based diagnosis.\nThere were several limitations in our study. First, this was a retrospective study with limited sample size. Further study with more study population was needed to confirm our results. Second, because of the ionizing radiation, we could only retrospectively enroll the consecutive patients who underwent DECT scan of neck due to unilateral thyroid lesions, and analyze the contralateral normal thyroid lobe. Although the thyroid lesions (mostly papillary thyroid carcinoma) usually did not markedly affect the thyroid function indices, potential influence might still exist."
