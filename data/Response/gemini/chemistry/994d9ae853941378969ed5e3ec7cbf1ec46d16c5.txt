1. **Investigate the effect of different pH values on the stability and structure of the cubic human insulin polymorph.** This could be done by performing XRPD experiments at different pH values and comparing the resulting structures. This information could be used to design new insulin formulations that are more stable at different pH values.


2. **Study the interactions between insulin and other molecules, such as zinc and thiocyanate ions, in the cubic crystal form.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular docking. This information could be used to design new drugs that target insulin and to understand how insulin interacts with other molecules in the body.


3. **Explore the conformational plasticity of insulin in the cubic crystal form.** This could be done using molecular-dynamics simulations or other computational methods. This information could be used to understand how insulin changes shape in response to different stimuli and to design new drugs that target specific insulin conformations.


4. **Investigate the role of the N-terminal region of chain B in the formation of the cubic insulin polymorph.** This could be done by mutating the N-terminal region of chain B and studying the effect of these mutations on the formation of the cubic polymorph. This information could be used to design new insulin analogs that are more stable in the cubic crystal form.


5. **Develop new methods for the crystallization of insulin in the cubic crystal form.** This could be done by screening different crystallization conditions or by using novel crystallization techniques. This information could be used to produce large crystals of insulin in the cubic crystal form, which could be used for structural studies or for the development of new insulin formulations.
