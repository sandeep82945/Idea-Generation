    "abstractText": "Working memory (WM) training typically leads to large performance gains in the practiced tasks, but transfer of these gains to other contexts is elusive. One possible explanation for the inconsistent findings of past research is that transfer may only occur when cognitive strategies acquired during training can also be applied in the transfer tasks. Therefore, we systematically varied the content domains and WM operations assessed by training and transfer tasks and, thereby, the extent to which similar cognitive strategies could be applied. We randomly assigned 171 young adults to 1 of 8 experimental groups who trained 1 of 2 working memory operations (storage and processing or relational integration ) with materials from 1 of 4 content domains (verbal, numerical, figural-icon, or figural-pattern), to an active or to a passive control group. Before and after 12 sessions of adaptive training within 2-3 weeks, performance was assessed in all eight WM tasks. Bayesian generalized-mixed effects models revealed improved performance in the trained tasks compared to the active control group. However, these improvements did not generalize to tasks measuring the same WM operation with different materials. Moreover, the comparison of the training groups with an active and a passive control group showed considerable differences, thus highlighting the importance of distinguishing between active and passive control. Overall, the findings revealed no evidence for transfer between tasks assumed to afford the same strategies. Therefore, the adoption of specific cognitive strategies alone is unlikely to be responsible for transfer of WM training gains between tasks.",

One possible explanation for the inconsistent findings of past research is that transfer may only occur when cognitive strategies acquired during training can also be applied in the transfer tasks. Therefore, we systematically varied the content domains and WM operations assessed by training and transfer tasks and, thereby, the extent to which similar cognitive strategies could be applied. We randomly assigned 171 young adults to 1 of 8 experimental groups who trained 1 of 2 working memory operations (storage and processing or relational integration ) with materials from 1 of 4 content domains (verbal, numerical, figural-icon, or figural-pattern), to an active or to a passive control group. Before and after 12 sessions of adaptive training within 2-3 weeks, performance was assessed in all eight WM tasks. Bayesian generalized-mixed effects models revealed improved performance in the trained tasks compared to the active control group. However, these improvements did not generalize to tasks measuring the same WM operation with different materials. Moreover, the comparison of the training groups with an active and a passive control group showed considerable differences, thus highlighting the importance of distinguishing between active and passive control. Overall, the findings revealed no evidence for transfer between tasks assumed to afford the same strategies. Therefore, the adoption of specific cognitive strategies alone is unlikely to be responsible for transfer of WM training gains between tasks.\nKeywords: working memory training, transfer effect, storage and processing,\nrelational integration"

Based on the assumption that the correlations between WM and other cognitive abilities reflect functional overlap, it has been hypothesized that training WM can improve not only WM performance but also complex cognition more broadly (e.g., Jaeggi et al., 2008; Klingberg et al., 2002; for a review see Schwaighofer et al., 2015). However, a growing body of studies in children (e.g., Ang et al., 2015), young adults (e.g., Clark et al., 2017; Foster et al., 2017; Harrison et al., 2013; Minear et al., 2016; Redick et al., 2013), and older adults (e.g., von Bastian et al., 2013) shows that the typically large gains in the trained WM tasks rarely generalize to untrained tasks measuring different yet related constructs (i.e., far transfer), and sometimes not even to untrained WM tasks assessing other WM content domains or operations (near transfer; e.g., De Simoni & von Bastian, 2018; Guye & von Bastian, 2017; Soveri et al., 2017; Sprenger et al., 2013). It is essential to note that the WM training literature may suffer from publication bias \u2013 the positive transfer effects found in the previous studies could be overestimated (e.g., Simons et al., 2016).\nHowever, one possible explanation for the limited transfer of improved performance\nin the trained tasks to other contexts is that trainees acquire strategies during training that are difficult to apply in other contexts. Hence, transfer might occur only if training and transfer tasks afford the same strategies (see also Gathercole et al., 2019). However, the extent to which transfer of training is task-specific (i.e., material-dependent) or process-specific (i.e., material-independent) is yet unclear. For example, Ericsson et al. (1980) showed that training with numbers did not improve the recall of letters, but Hilbert et al. (2014) found transfer between mirror-reversed letters and mirror-reversed numbers.

Each facet is further split into three categories. The content facet contains verbal, numerical, and figuralspatial WM; the operation facet distinguishes the three WM functions storage and processing, relational integration, and supervision. Storage and processing reflects the maintenance of briefly presented new information over a short period of time when simultaneously processing information. Relational integration refers to the ability to build new relations between information elements and integrate them into structures. Supervision corresponds to the shifting factor in Miyake et al.\u2019s (2000) model of executive functions. It involves the activation of relevant goal representations, suppression of distraction, and switching between task sets. Whereas storage and processing and relational integration are consistently found to be highly correlated due to taxing attention control (i.e., ignoring irrelevant information; Himi et al., 2019), supervision is often only weakly related to the other two operations (e.g., B\u00fchner et al., 2005; Hilbert et al., 2017, Oberauer et al., 2003; Oberauer et al., 2008; von Bastian & Oberauer, 2013). Therefore, following the rationale of functional overlap, transfer is most likely to occur between storage and processing and relational integration and, thus, the present study focuses on these two operations.\nStrategy Use in Working Memory Training\nSimilar to the general body of WM training literature, past training studies based on\nthe facet model of WM have also reported mixed evidence for near and far transfer after storage and processing and relational integration training (Lange & S\u00fc\u00df, 2015; von Bastian et al., 2013; von Bastian & Oberauer, 2013).

Similarly, Hilbert and colleagues (2017) observed transfer from verbal to numerical material and vice versa (within WM operations) but not between verbal/numerical and figural material. Von Bastian and Oberauer (2013) as well as Hilbert et al. (2017) speculated that trainees might have acquired task-specific strategies during training that were not applicable to the structurally different near transfer tasks. More precisely, Hilbert et al. assumed that this could be attributed to verbalization strategies acquired in the verbal and numerical tasks, which are not useful for solving the figural tasks. Indeed, there is evidence for content domain-specific differences in strategy use. Specifically, it has been shown that training can yield a significant increase in verbal strategy use when performing untrained verbal tasks (Dunning & Holmes, 2014). Likewise, visual strategies have been found to be effective in enhancing performance in visuospatial WM tasks (Stieff et al., 2020). Furthermore, serial order encoding of verbal or spatial information in WM is not domain-general (Ginsburg et al., 2017, Experiments 1, 2, & 3; Zimmermann et al., 2016). More recently, Forsberg et al. (2020) showed that instructing WM trainees with visualization strategies can considerably boost WM training performance in the absence of transfer to structurally different transfer tasks (see also Laine et al., 2018).\nConversely, if training and transfer tasks afford similar strategies, transfer may be\nobserved. For example, Comblain (1994) showed that training a rehearsal strategy with verbal materials (e.g., pictures of a noun) can improve performance in numerical (digit) and verbal (letter) memory span task performance. Hence, transfer may not be driven by functional overlap but overlap in cognitive strategies and routines that can be applied (see also Gathercole et al., 2019; Norris et al., 2019). Critically, this implies that transfer observed does not reflect increased WM capacity (i.e., the overall amount of information that someone can access and process in the present moment) but instead enhances WM efficiency by"

This efficiency may well be due to the application of the cognitive strategy used in a given context, meaning how information is processed internally. However, not all cognitive strategies (grouping, sentence generation, mental imagery, or rote repetition) are effective to the same extent (Bailey et al., 2014; Dunlosky & Kane, 2007), and people might not use the same strategy at all times (Morrison et al., 2016). Moreover, Hilbert et al. (2015) showed that individuals relying on verbal processing strategies can be distinguished from those relying on visual strategies in WM tasks. Evidence from the neuroimaging results suggests that the changes occur following training in the middle frontal gyrus (Olesen et al., 2004), which is also responsible for verbal cognitive strategy (Hilbert et al., 2015), corroborating the presumed relation between cognitive strategies and training-related effects.\nGaining a better understanding of how strategy acquisition impacts patterns of\ntransfer requires a task-analytic training procedure that isolates the cognitive processes that are trained and improved (see also Gathercole et al., 2019; Taatgen et al., 2013). So far, few studies have directly ascertained transfer of training with one particular material to other WM tasks with different materials (e.g., Fellman et al., 2020; Linares et al., 2019). For example, Hilbert et al. (2017) systematically varied the stimulus content domains using verbal, numerical, and figural materials for training the two WM functions storage and processing and relational integration. The results indicated transfer between verbal and numerical but not figural materials in tasks measuring the same WM function. Hilbert et al. suggested that processing letters and numbers equally affords silent rehearsal, a strategy frequently used to remember stimuli in WM tasks. However, silent rehearsal is not applicable to all types of visually presented stimuli, as they first need to be recoded into verbal information (see also Hilbert et al., 2015). To further test this proposition, the present study set out to replicate and"

We hypothesized that transfer of training occurs if training and transfer tasks involve the same cognitive strategies. For this purpose, we developed a process-based task-specific training regimen and examined the role of strategy by contrasting performance in tasks affording a verbal strategy to tasks that do not. Specifically, we expected that using a verbal strategy would be associated with transfer to tasks comprising easily verbalizable stimuli such as words, numbers, and icons but not to tasks with stimuli that are difficult to verbalize such as figural patterns. Building on Hilbert and colleagues\u2019 (2017) study design, we selected training tasks measuring the two WM operations storage and processing and relational integration and extended the content domains by distinguishing between figural materials that allow for applying a verbal strategy (icons) and figural materials that are difficult to verbalize (patterns) and, therefore, are unlikely to evoke the same cognitive strategy. Moreover, this study incorporated both an active and a passive control group, and an adaptive training paradigm to minimize the methodological limitations of Hilbert et al.\u2019s (2017) study.\nIn addition to testing for transfer between content domains, we also investigated\ntransfer between training the two WM operations storage and processing and relational integration. Notably, however, neither Hilbert et al. (2017) nor von Bastian and Oberauer (2013) observed such effects. The present study provides a further test of this hypothesis. This also allowed for exploring how the newly developed figural-icon tasks related to other, established WM tasks.

Fourth, the \u201cbrms\u201d package (B\u00fcrkner et al., 2021) was used to compute Bayes factors (BF) with flat prior settings (normal 0, 1). The \u2018hypothesis\u2019 function of this package computes an evidence ratio (i.e., the BF in favor of H0) for each hypothesis. BFs range on a continuous scale from 0 to \u221e, with a BF of 1 reflecting no evidence. BFs below 1 represent evidence for the null hypothesis, and BFs above 1 indicate evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis (for conventions for the interpretation of the size of BFs, see Wetzels & Wagenmakers, 2012). All figures were created using the \u201cggplot2\u201d package (Wickham, 2009)."

This means that each of the eight WM training groups and the passive group were coded 1 for each participant in the respective groups and 0 for everyone else. Participants with the value 0 in all group variables, thus, belonged to the active control group. Accordingly, the dichotomous growth variable models the difference between pre- and post-test for the control group. The difference in gain between pre- and post-test in each WM training group, compared to the active control group, are reflected by the regression weight of the interaction between the corresponding group dummy variable and the growth variable. Finally, the fixed intercept parameter represents the baseline mean in the active control group. The main effects of the group variable were not included in the model to keep the models sparse and because there was no reason to assume group differences at pre-test, due to the random assignment. In addition, we ran a second analysis, in which the passive control group was considered the reference group. All other parameters were remained the same."

Thus, participants generally did improve in their general task performance (i.e., they identified the critical constellations correctly) but they did not equally improve in reducing their false alarms (i.e., they were not able to detect the critical constellations).\nTo statistically assess whether performance changed with training, we evaluated\ntraining performance across the 12 training sessions with Bayesian linear mixed-effects models, using sessions as fixed-effect and participants as random-effect.

Notably, storage and processing showed an increase in verbalization and relational integration showed a decrease in visualization strategies between pre- and post-test. As expected, whereas most participants used visualization in the storage and processing figuralpattern task (62.60% at pre and 49.10% at post-test), verbalization was the primary reported strategy in the storage and processing figural-icon task (53.20% at pre and 59.60% at post-test).2 In contrast, most participants used verbalization only in the verbal relational integration task (54.40% at pre and 63.70% at post-test) but not in any of the other relational integration tasks. In addition, some participants reported to have used either both strategies, an alternative/different approach, and no strategy in both storage and processing, and relational integration tasks (see Table 5).

A possible explanation for this difference in strategies used is that information is presented sequentially in the storage and processing tasks, thereby encouraging people to spontaneously encode information semantically and construct episodes (Wyer, 2004). In contrast, in relational integration tasks, information was arranged in a grid and participants were instructed to consider the spatial relations between the items (e.g., three identical last digits appear either in a row, column, or diagonal line in a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix).

Although accuracy scores were used for the storage and processing tasks, training performance did not improve as much as expected. Specifically, performance of the storage and processing numerical group questions the training effectiveness. This training group showed performance decreases until the first few sessions, but after that performance increased. Possibly, because we deal more often with verbal, numerical, and icon (easy to verbalize) materials compared to visuo-spatial material in everyday life, participants of these groups already function close to the optimal level (accuracy close to .80) and have less room for improvement in the beginning of training.

(2017), although they used highly similar training tasks. However, Hilbert et al. did not test baseline cognitive performance, which may have led to biased effect sizes (Melby-Lerv\u00e5g et al., 2016).\nThe most obvious potential explanation for the absence of transfer effects in storage\nand processing and relational integration tasks is that intensive practice on specific content domains (narrow training) may simply not expand domain-general WM capacity. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that the variance observed in gains can substantially differ from the variance in the (baseline) scores (Hayes et al., 2015). More specifically, the latent-variable analysis (Figure 3) revealed that the latent storage and processing and relational integration factors accounted for 28% to 66% and 18% to 35%, respectively, of the variance in each of their four indicators. This suggests that each of the single tasks possesses unique variances which are not explained by domain-general storage and processing and relational integration. If training-related changes are specific to the variance not captured by the domain-general factor, no domain-general transfer will occur. A recent meta-analysis concluded that benefits of training with specific materials only might indeed be limited to training gains (Schwaighofer et al., 2015).\nMoving beyond capacity-driven transfer, we hypothesized that these highly task-\nspecific gains are due to the acquisition of strategies. We deliberately designed the tasks to facilitate transfer from verbal and numerical to figural-icons and vice versa, and we predicted that transfer would occur for tasks affording similar strategies (see also Gathercole et al., 2019). However, our results suggest that strategy use and affordability cannot fully explain the lack of transfer either. The present data did neither support that training can expand general cognitive ability (transfer effects to untrained different tasks) nor that the acquisition of strategies improved cognitive efficiency \u2013 (transfer effect on an untrained similar task).

Over the course of the training, one typically develops a strategy that involves the task-surface feature of this particular task and relies less on semantic and episodic aspects of long-term memory.

The language of the present self-report strategy questionnaire (fixed-choice format) might restrict the participants response and, therefore, lead to biases. However, the strategy variable of the current study is categorized relatively broadly as verbal and visual strategy to increase the precision of the self-report.

Alternatively, whereas all three tasks (verbal, numerical, and figural-icon) afforded verbal strategies, they might have differed in the exact types of verbal strategies that can be applied. More specifically, to understand this issue a real-life example might be helpful: In the numerical task, the digit \u20189\u2019 indicates not only a number, but may also hold some meaning (e.g., by using verbal strategies such as associating the digit \u201c9\u201d with the month September and, thereby associating with some personal semantic meaning, such as having been born in September). This makes it more distinct from other digits such as \u20187\u2019 or \u20188\u2019. Inherently, such a strategy would be helpful to remember more digits but would be highly stimulus-specific and, therefore, not transferable to other materials, even if all digits generally afford a similar verbal strategy. More generally, training with one of these three tasks may have led to using or developing a new yet highly specific verbal strategy that could not be applied to the other tasks affording other verbal strategies. Furthermore, in the present study, spontaneously generated-strategies may have mainly depended on task-surface features (e.g., grouping information with common feature), rather less relying on deep information processing such as self-reference elaborative type strategy (e.g., semantic connection with own life or personally experienced episodic aspects of longterm memory; Wyer et al., 2008) or the mnemonics strategy (e.g., chunking; for details, see McCabe et al., 2016). Future research would benefit from using a more fine-grained categorization of types of strategies.\nSimilarly, the theory of transfer (Barnett & Ceci, 2002) explains transfer as a function\nof the content of practiced elements (i.e., specific stimuli) and the context in which practice and transfer occurs (i.e., a situation). It seems that transfer only takes place if the stimuli and the context of the task are synchronized.

People may be able to distinguish between stimuli more clearly, but may not be able to keep many of them in WM simultaneously, resulting in lack of transfer.\nFurther, it is also possible that the absence of transfer effects was observed because of\nlow training intensity (i.e., the number of trials practiced in each session). The number of trials in the storage and processing and relational integration training sessions varied as a function of participants' performance and training group. Participants in the relational integration groups practiced more trials (on average 500 trials) in each session than those in the storage and processing groups (on average 50 trials), but the storage and processing tasks required more time to complete.

Accordingly, even though storage and processing and relational integration are positively correlated, it is not necessarily the case that repeatedly practicing on specific tasks goes hand in hand with improvement in the common processes shared with other measures as well. Moreover, correlation does not entail causation, as exemplified by Harrison et al.

Instead, the positive correlation may result from another underlying ability that is related to both constructs but is not trained. For example, people with higher intelligence scores would perform better in both tasks (hence the shared variance) but, because intelligence is not trained, no transfer is observed.

Prior studies found some evidence in support of, but also against, this claim. The extent to which transfer of training is task-specific (i.e., material-dependent) or processspecific (i.e., material-independent) is still subject to debate. One possible explanation for the inconsistent findings of past research is that transfer may only occur when cognitive strategies acquired during training can also be applied in the transfer tasks. To shed further light on this issue, we systematically varied the content and operation domains of WM assessed by training and transfer tasks and, thereby, examined the role of strategy by contrasting performance in tasks eliciting a verbal strategy to tasks that do not. Specifically, we expected that using a verbal strategy would be associated with transfer to tasks comprising easily verbalizable stimuli such as words, numbers, and icons but not to tasks with stimuli that are difficult to verbalize, such as figural patterns. The consistent absence of the expected effects throughout our analysis, leads us to the conclusion that WM training with a small number of tasks has little chance of having a significant impact on the broader WM domain.

The differences in verbal strategy relative to visual strategy use between the figural-pattern group and verbal/numerical/figural-icon groups were of interest for the current study. Some coefficients are ambiguous due to the uneven distribution of the strategies in the respective group.
