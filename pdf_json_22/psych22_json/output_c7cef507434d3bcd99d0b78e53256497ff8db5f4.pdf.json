    "abstractText": "Introduction: Humans have the ability to efficiently extract summary statistics (i.e., mean) from a group of similar objects, referred to as ensemble coding. Recent studies have demonstrated that ensemble perception of simple objects is modulated by the visual working memory (VWM) task through matching features in VWM. However, few studies have examined the extending scope of such a matching feature effect and the influence of the organization mode (i.e., the way of combining memory matching features with ensemble properties) on this effect. Two experiments were done to explore these questions.",

However, few studies have examined the extending scope of\nsuch a matching feature effect and the influence of the organization mode (i.e.,\nthe way of combining memory matching features with ensemble properties)\non this effect. Two experiments were done to explore these questions.\nMethods: We used a dual-task paradigm for both experiments, which included a VWM task and a mean estimation task. Participants were required to adjust a\ntest face to the mean identity face and report whether the irregular objects in a\nmemory probe were identical or different to the studied objects. In Experiment\n1, using identity faces as ensemble stimuli, we\u00a0 compared participants\u2019\nperformances in trials where a subset color matched that of the studied\nobjects to those of trials without color-matching subsets. In Experiment 2,\nwe\u00a0combined memory matching colors with ensemble properties in common\nregion cues and compared the effect with that of Experiment 1.\nResults: Results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed an effect of the VWM task on high-level ensemble perception that was similar to previous studies using a\nlow-level averaging task. However, the combined analysis of Experiments 1\nand 2 revealed that memory matching features had less influence on mean\nestimations when matching features and ensemble properties combined in\nthe common region than when combined as parts of a complete unit.\nConclusion: These findings suggest that the impact of memory matching features is not limited by the level of stimulus feature, but can be\u00a0impacted by\nthe organization between matching features and ensemble target properties.\nKEYWORDS\nensemble perception, visual working memory, memory matching feature, high-level ensemble, Gestalt principle\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 01 December 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1053358"

            "text": "Humans have developed a crucial ability called ensemble perception, in which a group of stimulus properties, ranging from low-level features (e.g., orientation, size, and color) to high-level properties (e.g., facial expression, face identity), are rapidly extracted to form summary statistics, such as a mean or a variance of stimuli (Ariely, 2001; Chong and Treisman, 2005; Haberman and Whitney, 2012; Whitney and Yamanashi Leib, 2018). Past studies have shown that this ability has a mutual effect along with visual working memory (VWM) and have found that summary statistics interact with remembered items within the memory representation (Brady and Alvarez, 2011; Bauer, 2017; Corbett, 2017; Corbin and Crawford, 2018; Utochkin and Brady, 2020; Williams et\u00a0al., 2021). With respect to the impact of ensemble coding on items stored in VWM, discoveries are that estimates of the memorized item were readily biased toward the mean of a subset in the same color as this item (Brady and Alvarez, 2011), or a subset in conformity with Gestalt principles (Corbett, 2017), or a group of homogeneity of items (Utochkin and Brady, 2020). Notably, recent work has focused on the influence of VWM on the process of ensemble coding (Bauer, 2017; Epstein and Emmanouil, 2017; Dodgson and Raymond, 2020; Williams et\u00a0al., 2021; Jia et\u00a0al., 2022).\nSeveral papers have explored whether VWM tasks affect ensemble coding and have come to various different ideas of conclusions regarding its impact (Epstein and Emmanouil, 2017; Dodgson and Raymond, 2020; Williams et\u00a0al., 2021). For example, Epstein and Emmanouil (2017) showed the precision of mean estimations remained when irrelevant items were remembered in a VWM task. However, a few studies have found the bias effect of average estimates emerged when a VWM task (Williams et\u00a0al., 2021) or a learning task (Dodgson and Raymond, 2020) was done prior to the averaging task and shared features with a part of the stimuli in an ensemble group. Williams et\u00a0al. (2021) provided an essential explanation for their aforementioned results that VWM influences perceptual averaging through a memory matching feature, while an averaging task without such matching features is unaffected by the memorized object. In the study of Williams et\u00a0al. (2021), observers were asked to estimate the mean orientation of a stimulus set containing two sets of similar line subsets in different colors while memorizing the colored irregular object. They found that average estimations of all lines were biased toward a subset with the same color as that of the irregular-colored item, suggesting the possibility that the VWM task affected mean estimations through matching features (Williams et\u00a0al., 2021). However, participants may deliberately devote more attention to memory matching objects and then bias the ensemble estimations. To rule out this possibility, Williams and colleagues compared ensemble biases between a brief duration (i.e., 150 ms) and a long duration (i.e., 500 ms) of the ensemble display in their experiment 3 (Williams et\u00a0al., 2021). Participants should have reduced bias in brief duration condition because voluntary attentional allocation would be\u00a0difficult for short presentation durations. The results showed no ensemble bias difference between short and long duration\nconditions and then excluded the possibility of cuing of attention. Furthermore, the importance of memory matching features in the influence of working memory on ensemble coding was further emphasized by the experiment of Epstein and Emmanouil (2017), who found no connection between the VWM task and the averaging task at the stimulus level without the presence of matching features. Results of their study showed that the accuracy of the size averaging task was unchanged according to levels of working memory load (i.e., remembering zero, two, or four items), nor was it affected by the VWM task. Considering these findings together, we\u00a0can conclude that the existence of an inter-task shared feature is crucial for the influence of a memorized item on averaging estimations for a group of properties (Epstein and Emmanouil, 2017; Williams et\u00a0al., 2021). Overall, these findings aligned well with the amplification hypothesis of perceptual averaging (Kanaya et\u00a0 al., 2018), which stated that physically salient elements are involuntarily and automatically weighted more than less salient elements in the contribution of average estimations (Kanaya et\u00a0al., 2018; Iakovlev and Utochkin, 2021). More importantly, Williams\u2019s study (2021) expanded extension of the amplification hypothesis by showing that memory matching items gained more attentional resources and became more salient compared to nonmatching items, which in turn weighted more in average estimations.\nAll the aforementioned studies have discussed or confirmed the influence of memory matching features on low-level ensemble coding (Epstein and Emmanouil, 2017; Williams et\u00a0 al., 2021). However, few studies have focused on high-level ensemble coding. Thus, little is known whether the matching feature effect from low-level ensemble coding extends to VWM tasks\u2019 influence on high-level perceptual averaging. As for ensemble perception and object memory, the discrepancy in properties of simple and complex stimuli leads to a hierarchical structure, including both low-level and high-level features (Haberman et\u00a0 al., 2015; Christophel et\u00a0al., 2017; Ding et\u00a0al., 2017; Whitney and Yamanashi Leib, 2018). High-level and low-level features differ in their functional roles in our environment (Ding et\u00a0al., 2017; Whitney and Yamanashi Leib, 2018). Low-level features, such as color, orientation, spatial location, and motion, form a cornerstone for object recognition as well as for taking in an understanding of a scene (Oliva and Torralba, 2006). With respect to high-level features, these are instrumental in offering significant social and emotional information (Cavanagh, 2011; Whitney and Yamanashi Leib, 2018). Having access to ensemble perception of high-level properties is integral to adapting in society, from identifying potential threats to perceiving the emotions of groups of individuals. Furthermore, Haberman et\u00a0 al. (2015) revealed direct evidence that different feature levels might have dissimilar ensemble perception mechanisms, finding that the correlation of summary statistics between high-level (i.e., emotion, face identity) and low-level (i.e., color, orientation) ensemble perceptual tasks was significantly lower than the correlation between those from within the same level. That is, there is not a single, domain-general mechanism supporting all ensemble representation types, and inversely, multiple domainspecific mechanisms work for various feature levels, suggesting a\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nhierarchical structure for levels of ensemble perception. Accordingly, in consideration of this hierarchical structure, matching features through the VWM task would lead to different effects in the highlevel ensemble perception. However, this prediction seems contradict to previous literature in which a similar amplification effect driven by physical saliences was evidenced in both low-level (e.g., orientations of lines; Williams et\u00a0al., 2021) and high-level (e.g., facial expressions; Goldenberg et\u00a0al., 2021; Goldenberg et\u00a0al., 2022; Yang and Baek, 2022) ensemble coding. This suggests that the amplification effect is independent of ensemble perception levels. Therefore, we\u00a0proposed that matching features in VWM would exhibit a similar bias effect on high-level ensemble coding as that on low-level perceptual averaging in Williams\u2019s study (2021).\nAdditionally, past research has shown that memory matching features are presented as task-irrelevant attributes of ensemble stimuli for the averaging task (Epstein and Emmanouil, 2017; Dodgson and Raymond, 2020; Williams et\u00a0 al., 2021). Thus, it seems that the amplification effect could be\u00a0 driven as long as matching features and averaged properties belong to an object. It is not clear, however, whether having these two types of features belonging to a physical object is essential for the occurrence of the matching feature effect or these two types of features could be\u00a0perceived as one object based on the Gestalt principle (e.g., common region). It is well-established that Gestalt principles in a bottom-up manner help individual objects to appear together as an integrated unit within VWM, integrating the distributed discrete items into coherent visual information (Xu, 2002; Woodman et\u00a0al., 2003; Xu, 2006; Xu and Chun, 2007; Hollingworth et\u00a0al., 2008; Peterson and Berryhill, 2013; Gao et\u00a0al., 2016; Kalamala et\u00a0al., 2017; Montoro et\u00a0al., 2017). In such a visual process, the VWM stored grouped items with Gestalt principles as one object without the single elements (Woodman et\u00a0al., 2003; Xu and Chun, 2007) and, therefore, elements grouped by Gestalt principles are remembered more easily than elements united without Gestalt principles (Xu, 2002; Woodman et\u00a0 al., 2003; Xu, 2006). For example, Xu (2002) found that the memorization of two properties combined as parts of one object was as effective as remembering two features seemingly belonging to two individual but connected parts whose combination conforms with the Gestalt principle (i.e., connectedness), indicating that the latter combination can be\u00a0regarded as a complete unit. Based on aforementioned influence of Gestalt principles over VWM, memory matching features and ensemble properties would be\u00a0united together perceptually with Gestalt principles (i.e., common region), even though physically organized with two individual parts. As a result, it is reasonable to presume that a similar memory matching feature effect would be\u00a0observed as the condition in which the matching feature stands as a part of the ensemble stimuli.\nTo test these hypotheses about matching features, and following the experiment of Williams et\u00a0 al. (2021), we\u00a0 used a dual-task paradigm composed of a VWM task and a mean estimation task. In each trial of Experiments 1 and 2, participants were asked to memorize one colored object in a memory display, and then to estimate the mean of the averaging task when remembering the\ncolored object\u2019s properties. Additionally, a common color between the memorized object and a subset of the ensemble display was set up as the memory matching feature. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the color can be\u00a0the basis of a grouping principle and help to form the hierarchical structure of ensemble representations, allowing for better observation of the bias effect of mean estimations if the memory matching feature functions (Brady and Alvarez, 2011; Luo and Zhao, 2018). The purpose of Experiment 1 was to explore whether the VWM task would influence high-level ensemble coding through the inter-task common feature. We\u00a0selected face stimuli as the high-level ensemble materials. Face stimuli contain many high-level features used as stimulus properties for the averaging task, such as face similarity (Peng et\u00a0al., 2021), face identity (Haberman and Whitney, 2009; Bai et\u00a0al., 2015), and facial expression (Haberman and Whitney, 2007). Among these properties, facial identity was an appropriate choice for the perceptual averaging for our experiments and could be\u00a0scaled to a 360\u00b0circular space. To combine color features (i.e., memory matching features) and ensemble properties belonging to an object, the facial skin color was also considered as the task-irrelevant property matching the color with the VWM object. In addition, in order to make the biasing dimension (i.e., the color of faces) independent of the estimation-task dimension (i.e., the identity of faces) as in previous studies (Iakovlev and Utochkin, 2021; Williams et\u00a0al., 2021), the ensemble display set was divided into two facialidentity subsets with the mean of each subset either clockwise or counterclockwise from the global mean in circular identity space. Then we\u00a0manipulated the memorized color to be\u00a0matched with one of the two subsets (clockwise or counterclockwise), or mismatched with neither subset. Consequently, an amplification effect would be\u00a0manifested if the estimated mean was biased toward the mean of either clockwise or counterclockwise subset depending on the memory matching color. In Experiment 2, the crucial manipulation was to transform an object which combined the matching feature and the ensemble property as two individual parts with physically separated features, but regarded as a unit with a common region, in such case, connected to each other within an identical space. More specifically, grayed-out faces with the identity information were placed inside boxes colored the same as that of the memorized individual. We\u00a0 predicted a strong bias effect on mean identity estimations, as seen in previous findings, even though matching features were physically separated from the identity face. Furthermore, we\u00a0expected that our findings would support the assumption that Gestalt principles could be\u00a0applied to the effect of the VWM on ensemble perception.\nExperiment 1"

All stimuli were shown on a uniform black background (RGB = 0,0,0). Each participant sat approximately 57 cm away from the computer monitor with their heads on a desk-mounted chin rest. At this viewing distance, 1\u00b0 of the visual angle on the display was approximately 36.25 pixels.\nThe experiment consisted of the irregular object memory task (i.e., the VWM task) and the mean identity estimation task. For each of the stimuli presented in a stimulus display, there were six distinctly separated colors selected from the RGB color space (i.e., blue = 63,108,151; purple = 142,80,141; red = 151, 61,87; brown = 148,85,47; olive drab = 102,110,52; dark green = 57,114,105). In the VWM task, stimuli were irregularly shaped 2D objects generated for each trial according to the following restricted conditions. Following the experiment of Cohen and Singh (2007), first, irregular objects were constructed with 12 evenly spaced angles from 1 to 360\u00b0. These angles were then used to generate the irregular object\u2019s vertices at random distances subtending 1.1\u00b0 to 2.2\u00b0 from the center.\nIn the mean identity estimation task, four colored face morphs were presented in an ensemble display and 1 gray face was presented in an adjustment display (i.e., ensemble probe). The face morphs comprised a set of 360 face identities for each predefined color and in grayscale by morphing (MorphAge 3.0; Abrosoft Software Corporation) among three distinct neutral female faces from the NimStim Set of Facial Expressions (Tottenham et\u00a0al., 2009), which are represented with schematics in Figure\u00a01 (A-B-CA). The face identity of these face morphs were circular stimulus spaces with 360\u00b0. To minimize the difference in the faces\u2019 physical features, the face morphs were scaled with luminance normalized using the SHINE toolbox (Dal Ben, 2019) in MATLAB.\nIn the ensemble display, four face morphs were each subtended 4.30\u00b0 \u00d7 6.00\u00b0 of the visual angle, occupying each quadrant 5.18\u00b0 from the fixation point (2 \u00d7 2 grid). The entire set\nof four faces was separated into two distinct equally-numbered identity subsets by two predefined colors around the mean identity of the whole set (\u221236, \u221212, +12, +36 relative to the global mean of the four faces). The identity values of one subset were clockwise to the global mean while those of the other subset were counterclockwise to the global mean. In an adjustment display, a randomly selected gray face from the 360 identities, and was subtended at 4.30\u00b0 \u00d7 6.00\u00b0 of visual angle at the center."

Participants were asked to study the form or color of an irregularly-shaped 2D object for the VWM task and to report the mean identity of a set of four faces for the mean estimation task. The experiment consisted of matching and mismatching trials. The irregular object\u2019s color in the VWM task matched the color of the clockwise subset for half of the matching trials (i.e., clockwise matching condition, CM) while the color of the VWM object matched that of the counter-clockwise subset for the other half of the matching trials (i.e., counter-clockwise matching condition, CCM). In the mismatching trials, neither of the two subset colors matched the color of the VWM object (i.e., mismatching condition, MM).\nFigure\u00a02 illustrates the procedure of a single trial and identity faces shown in the figure were represented with schematics. Each trial began with a fixation central cross (0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0) presented for a randomly varied interval of 800 to 1,200 ms. A memory display then followed, presented for 500 ms. Participants were asked to memorize the form and color of the irregularly-shaped object positioned at the center of the display. The color of the VWM object was randomly selected from the predefined colors. After a 1,000-ms blank screen, a set of four faces appeared in an ensemble display for 1,000 ms.

After the mean identity adjustment, recall of the studied individual item was tested. Participants were asked to judge whether the second object displayed in a memory probe was identical to or different from the object studied in the VWM display of the trial and to report their answer by pressing the \u201cS\u201d (same) or \u201cD\u201d (different) keys. The same trials and different trials occurred at an equal frequency. For different trials, either the color or the form could differ from the studied object (but both would never change simultaneously) with both options occurring at an equal frequency. Once the participant gave their answer by pressing the relevant key, the trial ended with a 500 ms blank inter-trial interval. Participants were instructed to be\u00a0as accurate and as quick as possible, but there was no time limit for their response.\nPrior to starting the experiment, all participants completed a practice block consisting of 12 trials (four trials from each condition) to familiarize them with the VWM and identity estimation tasks.

First, we\u00a0 analyzed the accuracy of the VWM task across three matching conditions (i.e., CM, CCM, MM), measured as the proportion of correct responses to the VWM object question (i.e., VWM accuracy). Analyses of mean identity estimations were limited to trials in which participants correctly recalled the first colored object that had been displayed in the VWM display. Following previous studies (Iakovlev and Utochkin, 2021; Williams et\u00a0al., 2021), in each trial, we\u00a0calculated\nresponse errors measured as the smallest difference between the participant\u2019s selected face in an ensemble probe and the actual global mean (Response error = estimate response\u00a0- actual mean) in the circular space of face identities. The resulted error distribution across trials were further employed to estimate two important indicators of ensemble perception via the CircStat toolbox using MATLAB (Bays et\u00a0al., 2009; Berens, 2009): the circular standard deviation (CSD) of error distribution as the estimated precision and the mean of error distribution (ensemble bias) as the tendency of the estimated mean. Accordingly, the positive bias would reflect a tendency to estimate the mean value toward the mean of a clockwise subset while the negative bias would reflect a tendency to estimate the mean value toward the mean of a counterclockwise subset. Participants were excluded if their proportion of correct responses in the VWM task and/or response errors in the mean identity estimation task were greater or lower than 2.5 SDs above the overall mean. Participants\u2019 trials were excluded if their performance in the VWM task and/or the mean identity estimation task was greater or lower than 2.5 SDs.\nLastly, classical and Bayesian statistical analyses were conducted using Jamovi (Version 2.2.5.0; The Jamovi Project, 2021) developed by R (retrieved from https://www.jamovi.org) and JASP (Version 0.10.0.0; The JASP Team, 2022).

Performances in the VWM task and the mean estimation task were consistent with the findings of previous studies on the effect of a low stimulus level on the ensemble coding task. Therefore, the influence of the matching feature does extend from low-level ensemble coding to high-level ensemble perception, suggesting that the inter-task shared feature effect is not limited by the stimulus feature level. As expected, although different ensemble levels might affect the precision and efficiency of summary statistics with distinctive visual processes (Haberman et\u00a0al., 2015), our findings suggest that the amplification effect caused by memory matching features is independent of ensemble perception levels, and different ensemble levels might be\u00a0identical in terms of their pattern of information storage and extraction.

Nonetheless, it is non-negligible that organization modes between matching features and the averaged properties modulated the extent of the memory matching feature effect on the estimated bias of perceptual averaging. In contrast to the stimulus organization in Experiment 1, the combination of the Gestalt principle in Experiment 2 weakened the bias effect of mean identity estimations but improved estimated precise on mean estimations. Moreover, in Experiment 2, the VWM task performance seemed unaffected by the matching color, and the accuracy of the matching conditions improved at an integral level. These results indicate that the effectiveness of the memory matching feature may reduce somewhat when facial identities and matching colors are physically separated, even when integrated according to the Gestalt principle."

            "text": "Although the impact of VWM on summary statistics was varied (Bauer, 2017; Epstein and Emmanouil, 2017; Williams et\u00a0 al., 2021), memory matching features appeared to play a meaningful and functional role in the influence of a single studied item over average estimations. Based on this, Experiment 1 explored the scope of the matching feature from a low-level feature (i.e., orientation) to a high-level property (i.e., face identity). The results of Experiment 1 developed the findings of Williams et\u00a0al. (2021), revealing that the influence of the matching feature could extend from mean estimations of low-level orientation to the perceptual averaging process of high-level facial identity, concluding that the memory matching feature effect occurs across all levels of ensemble perceptions. That is, when an irrelevant individual shares common information about stimulus features with the latter averaging task even that is detrimental to the task\u2019s goal, this information led to average estimations which deviated from the summary statistics of a set, but biased toward the mean of a part with the same feature. According to results of Experiment 1, shared features stored in VWM largely explain the bias effect of mean estimations, which can be\u00a0observed in a wide range of properties.\nExperiment 2 verified whether the way stimuli are combined between matching colors and ensemble properties modulated the influence of the memory matching feature on the averaging task.

Such results extended the \u201cmatching features\u201d to a broader context regarding the influence of matching feature maintained in VWM over mean estimations. Moreover, the bias effect of mean estimations by features in VWM was unstable and varied according to the specific stimulus integration for the averaging task. Taken together, the results of Experiments 1 and 2 support the notion that VWM tasks can influence average estimations by the matching features, modulated by the stimulus combination between task-irrelevant colors in VWM and ensemble target properties. Our findings provide novel evidence that the impact of VWM on the process of ensemble coding can be\u00a0explained by matching stimulus features between tasks from the stimulus level, which supports the idea that averaging processing can be\u00a0guided by top-down memory of a prior task or past experience in the visual field (Dodgson and Raymond, 2020; Talcott and Gaspelin, 2020; Ramgir and Lamy, 2022). In other words, participants remembered the irregular object\u2019s color in a goal-directed manner, and estimates were biased toward a subset in the same color as the studied object by a way of amplifying the properties highlighted by VWM. Previous studies have shown that this way of the averaging phase aligns with the amplification hypothesis, stating that physically salient items are more largely weighted than less salient items in the determination of summary statistics (Kanaya et\u00a0al., 2018). In our study, memory matching colors led to the amplification effect on mean estimations. Nonetheless, matching feature effect can also be\u00a0explained by the feature-weighting account (Maljkovic and Nakayama, 1994) or the episodic retrieval model (Thomson and Milliken, 2013), both of which stress the importance of shared features on consecutive phases. Both accounts refer to feature inter-trial priming whereby attention may be\u00a0 automatically captured by the color or positioning remembered from the previous trial, resulting from prior experience (Lamy and Kristjansson, 2013; Ramgir and Lamy, 2022). In the present study, these accounts applied to continuous tasks (i.e., the VWM task and the mean estimation task) with the same color feature. The feature-weight account suggests that the bias effect is due to the fact that estimates are easily biased toward a memory matching subset that becomes more activated due to being shared by the relevant feature from the previous target. Episodic retrieval model supports a lasting influence of shared features, specifically, and highlights that remembered features in VWM are stored as episodic memory traces, and impair average estimates if these memory traces match parts of identifiable features in an ensemble display.\nIn addition, our results also reveal that low-level memory features of a VWM task, as a non-negligible part of scene information, have an impact on perceived high-level properties when low-level and high-level features were concurrently present. In the field of visual categorization and recognition, combining low-level features with high-level ones has been shown to have a strong effect in terms of a visual perception hierarchy (Schindler\nand Bartels, 2016; Stoddard et\u00a0 al., 2019). Accordingly, in the present study, the matching colors were irrelevant and meaningless with regards to face identity recognition, but the results indicated that these task-unrelated low-level color features were included rather than neglected or separated in VWM when participants perceive high-level face identities. From the neural mechanism at play, these low-level and high-level features are not separated from each other in the earlier visual processing task (Yang et\u00a0al., 2019). Thus, low-level features cannot be\u00a0ignored when predicting scene visual information where the focus is on high-level features (Gelbard-Sagiv et\u00a0al., 2016; Ibarra et\u00a0al., 2017). Our findings offer evidence for the influence of low-level features of VWM extending to the ensemble perceptual task. In addition, these results do not object to but rather supplement the findings of Haberman and colleagues (Haberman et\u00a0 al., 2015). That is, there might be\u00a0 a central mechanism corresponding to the observed matching feature effect in ensemble perception of both low and high-level visual features although the precision and efficiency of summary statistics were different across various levels of visual features (Haberman et\u00a0al., 2015). Based on our findings, disparate features mutually affect each other when the connection of low-level properties and high-level properties is constructed in the same physical environment.\nAnother important detail of our study is the reconstruction between memory colors and ensemble identities. As the results of Experiment 2 mentioned, the way that features matched with the VWM object were integrated with the averaged properties in the common region, referred to as the Gestalt principle, and led to a similar common feature effect as seen in Experiment 1 which presented faces with different skin colors in an identity display. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown that the Gestalt principle helps combine memory stored features and ensemble properties as an integrated unit (Xu, 2002, 2006; Xu and Chun, 2007; Peterson and Berryhill, 2013; Luna et\u00a0al., 2016; Kalamala et\u00a0al., 2017; Montoro et\u00a0al., 2017). Such integration as a whole unit is essential for the influence of memory matching features on perceptual averaging performance. It is worth noting that a smaller memory matching feature effect was found in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1, which was found in the combined analysis. The decline in this effect might be\u00a0due to the distinctly perceived integration of the ensemble display in the two experiments. Such a combination in Experiment 2 might have seemed incomplete, but the Gestalt principle seemed to play a part in classifying and connecting different features distributed across different physical spaces. Another possibility could be\u00a0that less attention is spread out to the focal boundaries (i.e., on the identity faces) when a matching color is an attribute of the boxes positioned around the identity faces in the averaging task, as was done in Experiment 2. This would be\u00a0in line with the findings of Nishina et\u00a0 al. (2007) that awareness of task-irrelevant visual features depends on the task distance, with an increase of required attention as the spatial distance between them grows.\nIt is worth noting that there were a few inconsistent results of the CSD and the ensemble bias in both Experiments 1 and 2. For\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nthe CSD, there was only a significant difference between CCM and MM conditions in Experiment 1 while no difference was evidenced for the rest of the comparisons in Experiments 1 and 2. Although significant differences were observed between CCM and MM conditions, the effect size (Cohen\u2019s d\u00a0= 0.304) of these differences was close to the effect size (Cohen\u2019s d\u00a0 = 0.233) of differences between CM and MM conditions. Moreover, CSDs of CCM were not different from those of CM conditions. Therefore, CSD may not be\u00a0a sensitive indicator to reflect the amplification effect due to matching colors in VWM. Indeed, the findings of Williams\u2019 study (2021) also reported significant CSD differences in only one comparison (clockwise vs. control conditions) in Experiment 1. Similarly, a recent study by Iakovlev and colleagues (2021) found that the CSD did not show any difference among clockwise, counterclockwise, control conditions even when the set size increased from 4 to 16. Taken together, inconsistent CSD results between the CCM and CM conditions in our study might be\u00a0due to the insensitivity of the CSD to the amplification effect. For the ensemble bias, there were mutually significant differences among CM, MM, and CCM conditions in Experiment 1. However, the difference between MM and CCM conditions became insignificant in Experiment 2 while all other differences remained significant as in Experiment 1. By taking a close look, the bias in the CCM condition did not show significant differences between Experiment 1 and 2 (t(70) = 0.042, p\u00a0= 0.966, Cohen\u2019s d\u00a0 = 0.010). However, the bias in the MM condition changed from positive in Experiment 1 to negative in Experiment 2 while both did not show a significant difference from zero (Experiment 1: t(35) = 1.270, p\u00a0 = 0.213, Cohen\u2019s d\u00a0 = 0.212; Experiment 2: t(35) = \u22121.272, p\u00a0 = 0.212, Cohen\u2019s d\u00a0 = \u22120.212, respectively) and reflected unbiased estimations as expected. Thus, the inconsistent result regarding MM vs. CCM comparison was possibly due to fluctuated bias in MM conditions across experiments."
