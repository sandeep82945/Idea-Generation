    "abstractText": "Adsorbents synthesized by activation and nanoparticle surface modifications are expensive and might pose health and ecological risks. Therefore, the interest in raw waste biomass materials as adsorbents is growing. In batch studies, an inexpensive and effective adsorbent is developed from raw olive stone (OS) to remove methylene blue (MB) from an aqueous solution. The OS adsorbent is characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra\u2010Red (FTIR), and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013 Teller (BET) surface area. Four isotherms are used to fit equilibrium adsorption data, and four kinetic models are used to simulate kinetic adsorption behavior. The obtained BET surface area is 0.9 m2 g\u22121, and the SEM analysis reveals significant pores in the OS sample that might facilitate the uptake of heavy compounds. The Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models best represent the adsorbtion of MB on the OS, with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 44.5 mg g\u22121. The best dye color removal efficiency by the OS is 93.65% from an aqueous solution of 20 ppm at the OS doses of 0.2 g for 90 min contact time. The OS adsorbent serves in five successive adsorption cycles after a simple filtration\u2010 washing\u2010drying process, maintaining MB removal efficiency of 91, 85, 80, and 78% in cycles 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The pseudo second\u2010order model is the best model to represent the adsorption process dynamics. Indeed, the pseudo second\u2010order and the Elovich models are the most appropriate kinetic models, according to the correlation coefficient (R2) values (1.0 and 0.935, respectively) derived from the four kinetic models. The parameters of the surface adsorption are also predicted based on the mass transfer models of intra\u2010particle diffusion and Bangham and Burt. According to the thermodynamic analysis, dye adsorption by the OS is endothermic and spontaneous. As a result, the OS material offers an efficient adsorbent for MB removal from wastewater that is less expensive, more ecologically friendly, and economically viable.",

Therefore, the interest in raw waste biomass materials as adsorbents is growing. In batch studies, an inexpensive and effective adsorbent is developed from raw olive stone (OS) to remove methylene blue (MB) from an aqueous solution. The OS adsorbent is characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra\u2011Red (FTIR), and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013 Teller (BET) surface area. Four isotherms are used to fit equilibrium adsorption data, and four kinetic models are used to simulate kinetic adsorption behavior. The obtained BET surface area is 0.9 m2 g\u22121, and the SEM analysis reveals significant pores in the OS sample that might facilitate the uptake of heavy compounds. The Langmuir and Temkin isotherm models best represent the adsorbtion of MB on the OS, with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 44.5 mg g\u22121. The best dye color removal efficiency by the OS is 93.65% from an aqueous solution of 20 ppm at the OS doses of 0.2 g for 90 min contact time. The OS adsorbent serves in five successive adsorption cycles after a simple filtration\u2011 washing\u2011drying process, maintaining MB removal efficiency of 91, 85, 80, and 78% in cycles 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

Wastewater is treated using different methods, such as membrane separation13,14, electrocoagulation15,16, flocculation17, precipitation18, ozonation19, and adsorption20,21. These well-established methods frequently fail to lower dye concentrations to desirable levels and are not economical for dye removal. Therefore, it is crucial to find treatment methods that are more efficient and economically feasible12. Adsorption is a technique capable of removing several types of pollutants from wastewater, including industrial dyes22. Nowadays, many adsorbents, including carbon-based nano-adsorbents23,24, transition metal-based oxides25, MOFs26, polymer-based adsorbents27, and low-cost adsorbents are used to treat dye-containing wastewater. It is possible to use inexpensive adsorbents from various sources, such as agricultural waste biomass, to remove contaminants from wastewater28,29. For wastewater treatment, agricultural wastes and cellulosic biomass hold tremendous promise as alternatives to activated carbon in adsorption30,31. Examples of low-cost adsorbents include pine leaves, pine cones, rice hull, tectona grandis sawdust, prickly pear seed cake, apricot seed, and sugarcane bagasse. These adsorbents showed promising results in removing several dyes such as Methylene Blue, Reactive Orange 16, Crystal Violet, Methyl Orange, Astrazone Black and Rhodamine B21\u201327. Table\u00a01 presents the results of various reported studies of low-cost adsorbents on removal efficiency. Low-cost adsorbents demonstrated high removal efficiency (> 90%) for most of the dyes reported in Table\u00a01.\nThe olive stone is a lignocellulosic biomass with lipids, polysaccharides, phenols, hemicelluloses, and celluloses as the main constituents32. There are many innovative uses for olive stones. An fascinating and expanding utilization of olive stones is as heavy metal and dye adsorbents in wastewater treatment facilities33.\nThis work focuses on using olive stone as a low cost bio-waste material, and efficient adsorbent for removal of methylene blue (MB) dye from wastewater in a batch adsorption system under various experimental settings/ conditions, due to its availability as a waste resource. The olive stones are produced from locally\u00a0available material that can be reused for removing the environmental pollution by using the low price, and environmentally friendly bio-adsorbent material. The determination analytic methods of XRD, SEM, BET, and FTIR are utilized to analyze the adsorption data. In addition, Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms are examined for finding the most suitable isotherm model. The adsorption kinetics is also studied. Furthermore, the mass transfer and thermodynamic studies are investigated."

Due to unequal forces, the molecules or atoms on the solid surface adsorb because they have excess surface energy36,37. The adsorption of contaminants on the adsorbent surface occurs in three steps40: (1) contaminants move from the liquid film\u2019s boundary layer to the adsorbent surface as explained by the extra-particle diffusion model, (2) molecules diffuse either within the pores, below the surface, or both as explained by the intra-particle diffusion theory, and (3) contaminants adsorb through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding in a surface chemical reaction. Because the third step is the fastest one, the first and second steps of the surface adsorption process can influence the adsorption amount and rate. It should be noted that all three phases, occurring separately or simultaneously, contribute to the adsorption process.\nThe Weber and Morris (WM) model, also known as the intra-particle diffusion model, uses the intra-particle diffusion coefficient to determine the mass transfer rate of contaminant particles to the interior of the synthetic adsorbent38. The mechanism of surface mass transfer to the adsorbent pores is investigated using the WM model. The theoretical fundamental is Fick\u2019s mass transfer law. In practice, the pore-based diffusion of the particle may control the adsorption process. Normally, the adsorption process can be regulated by the diffusion of the particles inside the pores. The Bangham and Burt (BB) model can be effective in these cases39. Table\u00a02 tabulates the mass transfer models."

The weak attraction of the MB-positive ions to the protonated hydroxyl and/or carbonyl groups on the adsorbent surface may lead to the low removal efficiency. In other words, because hydrogen ions compete with the adsorbent for active sites, the electrostatic attraction between the cation dye and adsorbent surface is not strong enough53. According to Mulugeta and Lelisa54, more active sites for adsorption become available by the negative charges on the adsorbent surface. Numerous investigations have also revealed that this advantageous adsorption occurs around pH of 8\u20131055\u201358.\nThe point of zero charge (pHpzc) can be employed to evaluate the surface charge characteristics of the OS particles and the interaction between the functional groups of MB and the adsorbent. The isoelectric point (IEP) of the adsorbent is determined to be 5.5, at which point the net surface charge becomes neutral (Fig.\u00a04B). When the pH falls below 5.5, the adsorbent acquires a positive charge due to the hydrogen bond formation, potentially impeding the adsorption of MB by causing repulsive forces. Conversely, when the pH increases above 5.5 (e.g., 9), the OS surface becomes negatively charged, promoting the adsorption of cationic MB through electrostatic interactions59. This favorable basic environment can be attributed to the presence of OH and COO\u2212 groups on the adsorbent\u2019s surface."

It is clear that increasing the adsorbent dose increases the number of accessible adsorption sites, which increases the extent of adsorbed dye. Adsorption density decreases upon an increase in the adsorbent dose, because adsorption does not completely saturate adsorption sites61. Another possibility is that the high adsorbent dose causes inter-particle interactions, such as aggregation, which would reduce the adsorbent\u2019s overall surface area and lengthen the diffusional path62."

Thus, it can be concluded that 90\u00a0min would be a\u00a0sufficient time to achieve equilibrium in subsequent trials. Hence, this time period is adopted for all subsequent observations.\nStudying the key process variables demonstrates that OS is an effective material in removing the MB dye, with a good removal efficiency equal to 93.65% compared to other low-cost adsorbents such as pine leaves21 and pine cone22 with the removal efficiencies equal to ~ 80% and 63.83\u201394.82%, respectively, (Table\u00a01)."

The solute amount on the adsorbent surface determines the reaction rate, and the driving force is proportional to the total number of active sites present on the adsorbent surface71.

The n value determines the Freundlich isotherm adsorption intensity; n = 2\u201310, n = 1\u20132, and n < 1 correspond to good features, moderate adsorption, and bad adsorption, respectively71. Consequently, the intra-particle diffusion and heterogeneous surface are confirmed by the Freundlich isotherm with 0.4 < n < 1, which is in line with the Temkin isotherm. The adsorption of the MB chemical by OS occurs in two phases, as shown by the kinetics of the intra-particle diffusion model and the impact of contact time: (1) the adsorption of MB compounds occurs on the OS external surface, which is the instantaneous adsorption stage (film diffusion); and (2) the movement of MB compound within the OS pores is confined (particle diffusion). According to Table\u00a05, in addition to the surface adsorption characteristics, mass transfer mechanisms, such as intra-particle diffusion and external diffusion, and adsorption thermodynamics can contribute to the interactions between the MB compound and OS particles. The creation of an intra-bond between the OS and MB chemical controls the adsorption process on the OS in addition to surface interaction, particularly with low specific area. This explains the high adsorption capacity achieved based on the Temkin isotherm. The adsorption mechanisms are generally complicated and may include additional elements including temperature, ion exchange interactions, and dispersive force71,72."

            "text": "Olive stone, a waste product, is an inexpensive adsorbent capable of removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. This study assesses the removal of MB dye through batch tests. The MB dye adsorption on the OS follows the pseudo-second-order and the Elovich models based on the results and statistical analysis of various models. Modeling the adsorption isotherms with Langmuir and Temkin models offers a better fit. Additionally, the mass transfer mechanism of the surface adsorption for dye molecules on the OS adsorbent is examined using two mass transfer models. In the experimental phase of MB dye wastewater treatment, the tests are conducted to evaluate the effects of the solution pH, adsorbent dose, dye initial concentration, adsorption time, and temperature on the adsorption amount. According to the thermodynamic analysis, dye adsorption by the OS is endothermic and spontaneous. Overall, olive stone (as an adsorbent) effectively removes MB dye from aqueous solutions. Thus, it is a good choice for this purpose in wastewater treatment. This is because chemicallyprocessed adsorbents entail pollution risks. As a result, OS offers an adsorbent for MB removal from wastewater that is low-cost, more ecologically friendly, and economically viable. Systematic tests might be implemented successfully to increase the use of OS and sustainably treat MB-contaminated wastewater at small to large scales. For future work, it is recommended to conduct the adsorption tests at broad ranges of temperatures, pressures, concentrations/compositions, and types of contaminants in various water and wastewater streams."
