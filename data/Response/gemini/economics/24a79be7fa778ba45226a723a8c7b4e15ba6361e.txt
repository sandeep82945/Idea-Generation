1. **Incorporating dynamic demand:** The model currently assumes static demand, but in reality, demand for mobility services can vary over time. Extending the model to incorporate dynamic demand would allow for more realistic and responsive service design.
2. **Considering environmental impacts:** The model does not currently consider the environmental impacts of different mobility options. Incorporating environmental factors into the model would allow for the design of more sustainable MaaS systems.
3. **Exploring the role of data:** The availability of data is crucial for the effective design and operation of MaaS systems. Future research could explore how to leverage data to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
4. **Investigating the impact of regulations:** The regulatory environment can have a significant impact on the development and operation of MaaS systems. Future research could explore how different regulations affect the design and performance of MaaS systems.
5. **Developing decision support tools:** The model can be used to develop decision support tools that can help policymakers and operators design and operate MaaS systems. Future research could focus on developing user-friendly and accessible tools that can be used by a wide range of stakeholders.
