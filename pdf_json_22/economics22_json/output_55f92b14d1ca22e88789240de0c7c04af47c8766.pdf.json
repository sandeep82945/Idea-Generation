    "abstractText": "The natural gas price is an essential financial variable that needs periodic modeling and predictive analysis for many practical implications. Macroeconomic euphoria and external uncertainty make its evolutionary patterns highly complex. We propose a two-stage granular framework to perform predictive analysis of the natural gas futures for the USA (NGFUSA) and the UK natural gas futures for the EU (NGF-UK) for pre-and during COVID-19 phases. The residuals of the previous stage are introduced as a new explanatory feature along with standard technical indicators to perform predictive tasks. The importance of the new feature is explained through the Boruta feature evaluation methodology. Maximal Overlap DiscreteWavelet Transformation (MODWT) is applied to decompose the original time-series observations of the natural gas prices to enable granular level forecasting. Random Forest is invoked on each component to fetch the respective predictions. The aggregated componentwise sums lead to final predictions. A rigorous performance assessment signifies the efficacy of the proposed framework. The results show the effectiveness of the residual as a feature in deriving accurate forecasts. The framework is highly efficient in analyzing patterns in the presence of a limited number of data points during the uncertain COVID-19 phase covering the first and second waves of the pandemic. Our findings reveal that the prediction accuracy is the best for the NGF-UK in the pre-COVID-19 period. Also, the prediction accuracy of the NGF-USA is better in the COVID-19 period than the pre-COVID-19 period.",

            "text": "Natural gas usage has seen a continuous surge in the world energy systems due to sustainability challenges and to mitigate hazardous environmental impacts (Avraam et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). Economic activities are closely linked with natural gas prices. As a result, predicting natural gas prices becomes a highly arduous task of paramount relevance in the planning and operations of various key assets, including public utilities (Goncharuk & Cirella, 2020). Natural gas price predictions assist in regulatory decision-making regarding electric and gas utilities (Costello, 2010). Despite an uninterrupted growth of natural gas trade, bubbles in natural gas prices in the European Union, Asia, and the US markets have been documented (Li et al., 2020). Economic euphoria, geopolitical events, fluctuations of crude oil prices largely account for the same. Unavoidable lockdowns and curbs owing to the COVID-19 pandemic have further triggered uncertainty in the overall consumption of natural gas and (Cihan, 2022).\nThe literature reported the rambling price movements of natural gas played a pivotal role in political chaos in Venezuela, public protests in Iran, and political turmoil in Kazakhstan (Rostan &Rostan, 2021). Precise predictions of natural gas prices can help optimize resource utilization, reserves management, and drawing decisions on economic reforms. Natural gas pricemovements are susceptible to natural calamities and external economicvolatility (Huang & Etienne, 2021; Shi & Shen, 2021). Its co-movement and strong nexus with the crude oil price and stock market across different economies are also apparent (Ftiti et al., 2020; Mensi et al., 2021). Fluctuations of natural gas prices induce volatility towards gas-and-coal-fired electricity generation (Linn and Muehlenbachs, 2018). The potential implications of natural gas price predictions motivate us to develop a robust framework that yields highly accurate forecasts during the normal and new-normal timelines.\nNatural gas futures price forecasting has received less attention than crude oil. The literature is more focused on predictive analysis of natural gas consumption at industrial and household levels (Gao & Shao, 2021; Hu et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020). We retrieve some literature that deals with natural gas futures price forecasting. Variants of regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models have been used for predictive modeling of natural gas prices (Salehnia et al., 2013). The results revealed that the accuracy of the ANN models was the best. Historical prices coupled with news on the internet and search data are used to forecast natural gas prices (Tang et al., 2019). The latter two components impacted positively to achieve better predictions. AVariational mode decomposition-based approach is used to estimate the point and interval forecasts for natural gas prices (Jiang et al., 2021). The obtained forecasts were more reliable and stable than the other models. Some hybrid approaches are also proposed to forecast daily natural gas prices (Wang et al., 2020).Unfortunately, the dearth of predictive modeling work to predict natural gas prices during the COVID-19 pandemic is pretty apparent. It is also important to acknowledge that the previous studies have considered the larger sample sizes for model building. They are not tailor-made to identify the patterns for a shorter sample size, which imposes several practical decision-making restrictions.\nThis paper contributes in the following twoways: First, it proposes a unique residual driven ensemble machine learning approach. The residuals of the previous stage have been utilized as a technical indicator to perform predictive tasks. The inclusion of residuals of predictive modeling of the previous stage has transpired to be of utmost importance in drawing forecasts of supreme precision in the subsequent stage. Second, explicitly carrying out forecasting during the timeline of the pandemic covering the first and second waves is of enormous practical implications and acts as an acid test to check the robustness and capacity of any\npredictive structure. Thepredictivemodeling approachproposed in this studyhelps to produce quality forecasts during said periods. Also, it uses relatively small segments of data of the first and secondwaves of pandemics exhibiting a high degree of turbulence owing to apparent implications.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we discuss the pertinent literature in brevity to comprehend the trend and highlight the existing gaps to justify the positioning of current work. Data descriptions alongside the settings to ascertain the prediction quality during Pre COVID-19 and COVID-19 regimes have been elaborated in Sect. 3. The research methodology has been elucidated in Sect. 4. The outcome of predictive exercises has been presented and analyzed in Sect. 5. Finally, the paper is concluded in Sect. 6 by mentioning the key findings, limitations, and future research agendas."

            "text": "Owing to its contribution to the energy market, different aspects of natural gas modeling have received considerable attention from researchers. The co-movement patterns of natural gas and crudeoil priceswere studied (Mensi et al., 2021).Natural gas prices offereddiversification benefits. Scholars also studied the interplay of natural gas prices with other commodity and financial assets (Ameur et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021; Liao et al., 2021). On a similar note, the natural gas consumption prediction has garnered attention, as reported in the literature (Liu et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2020; Qiao et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020). Unfortunately, few studies are available so far in the literature for forecasting natural gas prices using machine and deep learning techniques despite being a widely used source of clean energy.\nAn ensemble predictive structure was proposed to analyze Henry Hub\u2019s natural gas spot prices using the least-squares boosting technique (Ali, 2020). The predictive performance was satisfactory. A similar framework was constructed to estimate the daily US natural gas price (Wang et al., 2020). Long short-term memory network (LSTM), Support vector regression (SVR), and improved pattern sequence similarity search (IPSS) models were used for generating initial forecasts that were combined using variance reciprocal framework to obtain the final forecasts. The approach was found to be extremely proficient in yielding high-quality predictions.\nA granular predictive model was proposed to predict monthly spot prices of natural gas (Li et al., 2021) of Henry Hub. The methodological framework incorporated variational mode decomposition (VMD) to disentangle the original series into granular components and combined particle swarm optimization (PSO) and deep belief network (DBN) to draw forecasts. The findings revealed that WTI crude oil spot prices and natural gas consumption largely governed the evolution of Henry Hub\u2019s natural gas spot price. A neoteric shortterm forecasting structure was proposed for natural gas price prediction (Wang et al., 2021). The granular framework utilized ensemble empirical mode decomposition to decompose the original series into subseries wherein an RNN model optimized through PSO was applied to fetch component-wise forecasts to draw the final aggregate forecasts. The framework performed better than the other benchmark models.\nMost of these studies rely on sophisticated mathematical modeling in conjunction with machine learning and computational intelligence techniques. Unlike natural gas price modeling, the evolutionary pattern of natural gas consumption has been critically delved into during the COVID-19 pandemic (Cihan, 2022). Although natural gas prices and consumption are not\nentirely independent and exclusive, the evolutionary patterns and overall dynamics of both variables are influenced by different macroeconomic and financial conditions. Therefore, extending models built for consumption patterns recognition to predict price movement may not be ideal in challenging circumstances. Hence, the development of a dedicated framework to estimate futuristic figures of natural gas prices becomes essential.\nThe review of related literature demonstrates an inclination towards granular and artificial intelligence-drivenmethodologies for predictive analytics of natural gas prices. Despite being an influential energy commodity with substantial nexus with other financial assets, modeling futures prices has seen meager attention. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to date to specifically estimate forecast in the COVID-19 period encompassing both first and secondwaves of infection.Unlike PreCOVID-19 phase, performing prediction in the COVID-19 regime is extremely difficult irrespective of the high-end model used for drawing predictions due to profound uncertainty, disruptions, and anticipation of the market crash. Thus, barring the contribution towards the research void, the current work also propounds a neoteric feature engineering framework to accomplish the objective that can be leveraged for predicting extremely chaotic and uncertain events. Precise predictions of the UK and the US natural gas futures can directly be utilized for risk mitigation through portfolio realignment. Therefore, the apparent absence of research and profound practical applications justify the underlying research significantly."

            "text": "We investigate the predictability of natural gas prices for the pre-and during-COVID-19 periods and see whether the current pandemic leads to more uncertainty in the pricing structure. Accordingly, we collect daily data for the NGF-UK and NGF-USA from Bloomberg. The \u2018During Covid-19\u2019 period is taken from December 31, 2019, the day of receiving the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Wuhan, China, to May 20, 2021. The span of the \u2018During COVID-19\u2019 period for this study is 506 days containing 367 observations each for both the considered series. In the \u2018Pre COVID-19\u2019 period, we consider data from August 09, 2018, to December 30, 2019, to keep the uniformity in the number of observations for both series.\nIn summary, we have only 367 observations in each of the pre-and during-COVID-19 periods. We present the temporal patterns of Natural gas futures for the UK and USA during the investigation periods in Fig. 1. The visual inspection implies that all four pricemovements are highly nonlinear. In the rest of the paper, we use \u2018UK-Pre\u2019, \u2018UK-During\u2019, \u2018US-Pre\u2019, and \u2018US-During\u2019 to denote the time series for the NGF-UK in the \u2018Pre COVID-19\u2019 period, NGFUK prices in the \u2018During COVID-19\u2019 period, NGF-USA in the \u2018Pre COVID-19\u2019 period, and NGF-USA \u2018During COVID-19\u2019 period, respectively.\nTable 1 provides the summary statistics and statistical tests results to establish the behavioral patterns of the datasets.\nFrom Table 1, we find that the test statistic values of Jarque\u2013Bera, Shapiro Wilk, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov, and Anderson\u2013Darling are highly significant for all the time series. So, the natural gas futures exhibit non-parametric behavior. The ADF test statistic values appear insignificant for all the series in pre-and during COVID-19 periods. Therefore, we conclude that no series is stationary. A highly significant test statistic value of the Ljung-Box test at lag 10 confirms the presence of a strong autocorrelation structure in all the time series in pre-and during COVID-19 periods. The test statistic values of both neural network tests substantiate the nonlinear behavior of all four time series. The Hurst exponent values are significantly\nhigher than 0.5 for all the time series. So, we find the existence of persistent trends in the evolutionary patterns of natural gas futures of the UK and the USA.\nSeveral statistical tests on the time series of natural gas futures of the UK and the USA reveal the presence of long memory and autocorrelation structure in pre-and during COVID19 periods. In such situations, a predictive framework developed based on technical indicators is proven to provide superior forecasts (Ghosh et al., 2019). This encourages us to use a technical indicator-based predictive modeling framework. We select 30 technical indicators for predicting natural gas prices (Ghosh et al., 2019; Hsu, 2011; Huang & Tsai, 2009; Jana et al., 2020), following the previous works. The brief description of the technical indicators used in this work are as follows: MA5, MA10, and MA20 denote 5-day, 10-day, and 20- day moving average, respectively; B5, B10, and B20 denote 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day bias, respectively; MTM5, MTM10, and MTM20 denote 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day momentum, respectively; ROC5, ROC10, and ROC20 denote 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day rate of change, respectively; LAG1, LAG2, LAG3, LAG4, and LAG5 denote 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, and 5-day back prices, respectively; EMA5, EMA10, EMA12, EMA20, and EMA26 denote 5-day, 10-day, 12-day, 20-day, and 26-day exponential moving average, respectively; UB, and LB denote upper and lower Bollinger band, respectively; LOSS denotes the difference between today\u2019s and next day\u2019s prices; DIFF denotes the difference between 12-day and 26-day moving average; MACD denotes the moving average convergence divergence; HP signifies the highest price of the day; LP represents the lowest price of the day; and WMS denotes the Williams overbought/oversold index.\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics\nUK-Pre UK-During US-Pre US-During\nMean 0.60 0.44 2.79 2.30"

In the second stage, we propose to include Res as an explanatory feature in addition to the previous 30 features."

We have invoked MODWT to execute the said decomposition for component-wise predictive analysis. MODWT has been preferred over conventional discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) as dyadic restriction and sensitivity to the circular shift of the latter are not applicable to the former.\nThe technique transforms a given function f (t) into amother\u03c8(t) and father\u03d5(t)wavelets at a defined scale. If Fit is the i-th time series value at time t, then the detail (\u03c8 ri j , k) and approximation (\u03d5riJ , k) can be written as follows:\nFit = SFiJ (t) + DFiJ (t) + DFiJ\u22121(t) + . . . + DFi1 (t) (1)\nwhere SFiJ (t) = \u2211\nk \u03d5\nFi J , k\u03c6J , k(t), D Fi j (t) =\n\u2211\nk \u03c8\nFi J , k\u03c9 j , k(t), \u03c6J , k(t) = 2\u2212J/2\u03c6 ( t\u22122J k 2J ) , and\n\u03c9 j , k(t) = 2\u2212 j/2\u03c9 ( t\u22122 j k 2 j ) .\nThe inverse wavelet transform is\nf (t) = \u221e\u2211\nl=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e W\u0303l, k \u00d7 \u03c8l, k(t) (2)\nwhere \u223c Wl, k = \u221e\u222b \u2212\u221e f (t)\u03c8l, k(t)dt is the discrete wavelet transform of f (t).\nThe decomposition can swiftly disentangle the linear and nonlinear parts of original time series observations into manageable subseries, preserving the fundamental features of financial time series such as spillovers, heteroscedasticity, volatility clustering, etc. (Das et al., 2018; Jana et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2019). The \u2018haar\u2019 wavelet transform has been used to implement MODWT to carry out four decomposition levels as it is memory efficient, fast, and precisely reversible with no edge effects. As a result, one approximation (S4) and four detailed components (D1, D2, D3, and D4) are generated. The RF is invoked to perform a forecasting task at each granular component to derive the final forecasts. Mathematically, the final forecast is derived using (3).\nFinal_Forecast RFi = Forecast_DRF1i + Forecast_DRF2i + Forecast_DRF3i + Forecast_DRF4i + Forecast_SRF4i (3)\nwhere Final_Forecast RFi represents the final forecast obtained from RF for a particular variable i; Forecast_D j RFi accounts for the obtained forecasts by RF on detailed components, and Forecast_S j RFi reflects the forecasted figure at approximation component by RF."

It relies upon the bootstrapping process to construct decision trees as a base learner to classify regression tasks. Classical regression trees are used as base learners in this algorithm. RF utilizes a random sub-spacing principle in growing the trees wherein the best feature to perform branching operations is selected from a random subset of features.

On the approximation component, Res has not turned out to be lying on the top three spots in terms of feature importance.\nThe features importance UK-During are almost like that of UK-Pre. Res has appeared to possess significant explanatory power for modeling nonlinear components. It would be interesting to compare whether the actual predictive performance reflects the same phenomenon or not. Among the technical indicators, LAG1 has turned out to be highly important as well.\nFor the US-Pre, Res has appeared to be crucial as well. Unlike the UK counterparts, Res has not appeared to be important for the D4 component. Nevertheless, it has transpired to play a critical role in explaining the variation for the approximation component. Its inclusion increases the overall explained variation component. LAG1 has emerged to be important among the set of technical indicators implying that natural gas futures for the US depend on its immediate past behavior.\nFeatures evaluation of US-During justifies the inclusion of Res. It is amply apparent that the said feature has appeared to be an extremely impactful feature that largely expounds the overall variability on all high-frequency detailed components. Likewise, in earlier instances, LAG1 has turned out to be a critical technical indicator also. Hence, it is evident that Res plays a pivotal role in explaining highly nonlinear trends that may be beneficial for prediction exercise in the pandemic time horizon. It becomes imperative to evaluate how the previous stage unexplained behavior can explain the future volatile traits. Natural gas futures of both the UK and USA across the regimes have significantly depended on immediate historical information.\nThe decomposed series obtained through MODWT contains one approximation (S4) and four detailed components (D1, D2, D3, and D4). Out of the four detailed components, D1 accounts for the most volatile part (high frequency). It contains the maximum unexplained component compared to the other three detailed components. So, the Res corresponding to D1 has the maximum importance as a feature used in the second stage and plays the most crucial role in the forecasting process."

            "text": "The proposed two-stage predictive framework utilizes the MODWT, Boruta, and RF algorithms. Time series corresponding to the NGF-UK and theNGF-USA is initially decomposed using MODWT. In the first stage, 30 independent features are used, whereas, in the second stage Res is added as the 31st independent feature. In each stage, the final forecast is obtained by summing the component-wise forecasts.\nThe original daily time series corresponding to all the natural gas futures are randomly portioned into training (70%), testing (15%), and validation (15%) datasets to conduct the predictive exercise. It may be noted here that there are only 367 observations for each time series. Therefore, the training dataset contains 256 observations to build the random forest model. The entire predictive performance is done using the \u2018rattle()\u2019 package in R. The number of trees in the model is set to 500, a default value in the package. In this study, we extensively investigate the predictability the natural gas prices in the pre-and during COVID-19 periods. The investigation roadmap is as follows:\na. We partition each of the NGF-UK and the NGF-USA into two time zones\u2014pre (August 09, 2018, to December 30, 2019) and during (December 31, 2019, to May 20, 2021) COVID-19 periods. So, there are four time series that are denoted by UK-Pre, UKDuring, US-Pre, and US-During. We then decompose each of them into five granular components using MODWT. So, we have a total of 20-time series. b. We apply the FR algorithm on thementioned 20-time series to obtain the stage 1 forecasts for UK-Pre, UK-During, US-Pre, and US-During based on the 30 selected features. The final forecast of this stage is obtained by aggregating the forecasts obtained from the granular decomposed components. c. We calculate the Res for all 20-time series and update the feature lists. d. Then, we calculate the stage 1 forecasts for all 20 decomposed time series based\non initially selected 30 features and the Res as the additional feature. Following a similar process, as followed in stage 1, the final forecast of the second stage is obtained. e. To compare the performance of the proposed two-stage framework, we obtain forecasts from the original UK-Pre, UK-During, US-Pre, and US-During time series without decomposing them and applying the RF algorithm.\nFinally, we calculate forecast errors and access the predictive performances for the training and the whole datasets for all the decomposed components, aggregate series, and the original series without decomposition considering. For the first two cases, we compute forecast errors and predictive performances for stage 1 (Res not as a feature) and stage 2 (Res as a feature). These results are presented in Tables 6, 7, 8. Also, the forecast errors and predictive performances based on the training dataset on MODWT-decomposed individual components for both the stages are shown in the \"Appendix\" to obtain more insights on the overall predictive performance of the proposed two-stage ensemble machine learning approach.\nWe discuss the forecasting performance of the proposed approach based on the forecast errors and predictive performances presented in Tables 6, 7, 8. As expected, the MAE and RMSE values for UK-Pre, UK-During, US-Pre, and US-During are superior for the training dataset with Res as a feature compared to the MODWT-decomposed series with Res not as a feature and without MODWT-decomposition. The forecasting errors are minimum for the NGF-UK in the pre-COVID-19 period. The corresponding MAE and RMSE values are 0.001732 and 0.002878, respectively. On the other hand, the forecasting errors are worst for the NGF-USA in the pre-COVID-19 period. Surprisingly, the forecast errors are smaller for the NGF-USA during the during-COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. However, the forecast errors are smaller for the NGF-UK in the pre-COVID-19 period compared to the during-COVID-19 period.\nThe predictive performances manifested through IA, NSF, and TI values indicate that the proposed approach is the best. The IA and NSE values are close to 1 for the whole series. For the training dataset, these values are slightly inferior as there are only 256 observations. Smaller TI values indicate superior predictive performance. The best TI values have been obtained for the whole series. As before, these values are marginally less for the training dataset. The predictive performances of the ensemble approach without MODWT decomposition are second best (Table 8). However, both the error components are relatively higher compared to the proposed approach under training and whole datasets.\nIn terms of the methodology, the forecast errors are least for the proposed MODWTbased ensemble technique with Res as a feature, followed by the MODWT-based ensemble machine learning technique with Res not as a feature as evident from Table 6 and 7 on both training and the whole datasets. FromTable 6 and Table 8, we find that the proposed approach outperforms the ensemble machine learning technique without integrating MODWT applied to all the four original series in pre-and during-COVID-19 periods. Even the MODWT-based ensemble technique with Res not as a feature also outperforms the ensemble technique. Another interesting fact is coming out from the comparison of the second part of Tables 7 and 8. TheMODWT-based ensemble machine learning technique with Res not as a feature offers no better performance than the ensemble machine learning technique. The MAE and RMSE values are higher in this case. In summary, we conclude that Res residual-driven MODWTbased ensemble machine learning approach for forecasting natural gas prices appeared to be the best compared to all other scenarios. This was possible because of the inclusion of Res of the first stage as a feature in the second stage for forecasting the future movements of natural gas prices.\nInterested readers may please refer to the \"Appendix\" for finding the forecast error and predictive performance based on the training dataset on decomposed components with Res as a feature and Res not as a feature (Fig. 3).\nTa bl e 6 Fo\nre ca st er ro r an d pr ed ic tiv\ne pe rf or m an ce\nba se d on\nth e tr ai ni ng\nda ta se to\nn M O D W Tde co m po se d se ri es\nSe ri es\nR es\nas a fe at ur e\nR es\nno ta s a fe at ur e\nM A E\nR M SE\nIA N SE\nT I\nM A E\nR M SE\nIA N SE\nT I\nU K -P re\n0. 00\n17 32\n0. 00\n28 78\n0. 98\n76 15\n0. 96\n11 27\n0. 00\n50 87\n0. 00\n25 18\n0. 00\n51 11\n0. 96\n88 57\n0. 91\n71 94\n0. 00\n50 92\nU K -D\nur in g\n0. 00\n19 43\n0. 00\n33 67\n0. 98\n60 98\n0. 95\n59 55\n0. 00\n57 76\n0. 00\n27 78\n0. 00\n42 01\n0. 96\n61 41\n0. 91\n00 27\n0. 00\n56 65\nU SPr e\n0. 00\n95 99\n0. 01\n82 12\n0. 97\n17 98\n0. 92\n46 49\n0. 01\n89 6\n0. 01\n19 84\n0. 02\n14 64\n0. 95\n77 51\n0. 89\n25 95\n0. 02\n04 34\nU SD ur in g\n0. 00\n65 45\n0. 01\n03 99\n0. 98\n97 94\n0. 96\n70 14\n0. 01\n35 29\n0. 00\n96 34\n0. 01\n38 70\n0. 97\n17 9\n0. 92\n36 65\n0. 01\n43 33\nTa bl e 7 Fo\nre ca st er ro r an d pr ed ic tiv\ne pe rf or m an ce\nba se d on\nth e w ho le da ta se to\nn M O D W Tde co m po se d se ri es\nSe ri es\nR es\nas a fe at ur e\nR es\nno ta s a fe at ur e\nM A E\nR M SE\nIA N SE\nT I\nM A E\nR M SE\nIA N SE\nT I\nU K -P re\n0. 00\n77 9\n0. 01\n12 9\n0. 99\n92 7\n0. 99\n71 0\n0. 01\n50 0\n0. 01\n24 4\n0. 01\n69 9\n0. 99\n83 5\n0. 99\n34 3\n0. 02\n16 7\nU K -D\nur in g\n0. 00\n84 2\n0. 01\n36 0\n0. 99\n90 8\n0. 99\n63 3\n0. 02\n14 0\n0. 01\n19 0\n0. 01\n81 4\n0. 99\n83 5\n0. 99\n34 7\n0. 02\n72 1\nU SPr e\n0. 03\n72 3\n0. 06\n95 3\n0. 99\n61 0\n0. 98\n41 2\n0. 02\n34 8\n0. 04\n69 1\n0. 08\n40 9\n0. 99\n42 2\n0. 97\n76 6\n0. 02\n83 2\nU SD ur in g\n0. 02\n97 2\n0. 04\n69 9\n0. 99\n76 0\n0. 99\n05 5\n0. 01\n88 8\n0. 04\n58 0\n0. 06\n65 0\n0. 99\n50 8\n0. 98\n07 5\n0. 02\n66 4\nTable 8 Forecast error and predictive performance based on thewhole datasetwithoutMODWT-decomposition\nSeries MAE RMSE IA NSE TI\nUK-Pre 0.01076 0.01500 0.99871 0.99488 0.01938\nUK-During 0.01093 0.01747 0.99848 0.99394 0.02649\nUS-Pre 0.04339 0.07496 0.99551 0.98225 0.02529\nUS-During 0.04109 0.06108 0.99585 0.98376 0.02453\nTable 9 presents the correlation between the predicted and actual values.

For the proposed approach with Res as a factor, the correlation value is maximum for the UK-Pre, followed by UK-During, US-During, and US-Pre. Correlation values obtained for the proposed approach are higher than the values obtained for the other two approaches.

We combine the MODWT decomposition technique and an ensemble machine learning algorithm to achieve the research endeavors. The introduction of the unexplained components in terms of the residuals of the previous stage to build a granular forecasting structure for the next stage is a substantial contribution that resulted in highly accurate predictions. The significant findings of this research are summarized next.\nThe natural gas futures markets of the UK and US have exhibited persistent trends that suggested the deployment of technical indicators as explanatory features. The feature, Res has enhanced the quality of forecasts by largely explaining the nonlinear granular components of respective original series. The efficacy of the two-stage forecasting approach is amply evident through the incorporation of Res as a feature. Despite being developed on a relatively small chunk of samples, the predictive architecture demonstrates the ability to yield high-quality predictions in challenging circumstances. The role of MODWT in improving the accuracy of obtained forecasts is imminent that conforms to previous cognate literature of MODWT based complex financial time series prediction (Jana et al., 2021). The prediction accuracy of NGF-UK in Pre COVID-19 phase has appeared to be better than the COVID-19 phase. On the other hand, the prediction accuracy of the NGF-USA has turned out to be better in the COVID-19 phase than Pre COVID-19 regime. So, there is no clear evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on the natural gas future prices was established through this study.\nThe most challenging part of this research was to obtain a superior forecast for the natural gas prices in the presence of a limited number of observations using machine learning. The availability of more observations will undoubtedly lead to superior predictive performance. The scope of the present work is limited to the UK and US natural gas futures markets.

The approach will offer more benefits for the time series that are more volatile and complex. The scalability of the presented framework makes it ideal for carrying out the predictive task for time series representing high-frequency intraday data as well.

The exercise can separately be performed during normal and new normal timelines using predictive residuals of the previous stage as a key component. The unique feature processing utility described here needs further exploration to predict extremely volatile events, including market crashes.\nAppendix\nSee Tables 10, 11.\nTa bl e 10\nFo re ca st er ro r an d pr ed ic tiv\ne pe rf or m an ce\nba se d on\nth e tr ai ni ng\nda ta se to\nn de co m po\nse d co m po\nne nt s w ith\nR es\nas a fe at ur e\nU K -P re\nU K -D\nur in g\nD 1\nD 2\nD 3\nD 4\nS 4 D 1\nD 2\nD 3\nD 4\nS 4\nM A E\n0. 00\n16 88\n0. 00\n16 39\n0. 00\n15 89\n0. 00\n12 83\n0. 00\n24 58\n0. 00\n13 52\n0. 00\n18 72\n0. 00\n17 18\n0. 00\n13 7\n0. 00\n34 05\nR M E S\n0. 00\n34 79\n0. 00\n30 45\n0. 00\n25 45\n0. 00\n19 45\n0. 00\n33 77\n0. 00\n29 47\n0. 00\n41 68\n0. 00\n33 46\n0. 00\n18 98\n0. 00\n44 78\nIA 0. 96\n49 02\n0. 98\n34 39\n0. 99\n23 52\n0. 99\n74 45\n0. 99\n99 35\n0. 97\n49 04\n0. 97\n00 36\n0. 98\n72 13\n0. 99\n84 46\n0. 99\n98 91\nN SC\n0. 89\n69 23\n0. 94\n58 63\n0. 97\n28 06\n0. 99\n03 03\n0. 99\n97 4\n0. 92\n27 02\n0. 90\n81 85\n0. 95\n53 72\n0. 99\n39 54\n0. 99\n95 64\nT I\n0. 00\n59 95\n0. 00\n51 81\n0. 00\n48 15\n0. 00\n46 48\n0. 00\n47 96\n0. 00\n54 09\n0. 00\n69 17\n0. 00\n55 26\n0. 00\n33 23\n0. 00\n77 07\nU SPr e\nU SD ur in g\nM A E\n0. 01\n33 65\n0. 00\n85 6\n0. 00\n82 52\n0. 00\n70 82\n0. 01\n07 37\n0. 00\n65 83\n0. 00\n69 19\n0. 00\n64 65\n0. 00\n54 12\n0. 00\n73 46\nR M E S\n0. 02\n72 55\n0. 01\n81 39\n0. 01\n43 99\n0. 01\n27 32\n0. 01\n85 33\n0. 01\n16 72\n0. 01\n11 67\n0. 00\n96 79\n0. 00\n81 54\n0. 01\n13 26\nIA 0. 90\n13 07\n0. 97\n16 55\n0. 98\n97 41\n0. 99\n65 77\n0. 99\n97 09\n0. 97\n25 54\n0. 98\n58 86\n0. 99\n33 94\n0. 99\n72 88\n0. 99\n98 46\nN SC\n0. 76\n24 75\n0. 91\n12 31\n0. 96\n35 9\n0. 98\n71 06\n0. 99\n88 43\n0. 91\n65 06\n0. 95\n31 64\n0. 97\n63 39\n0. 98\n96 75\n0. 99\n93 84\nT I\n0. 03\n39 21\n0. 01\n57 7\n0. 01\n83 66\n0. 02\n03 65\n0. 00\n63 81\n0. 01\n70 71\n0. 01\n58 42\n0. 01\n72 84\n0. 01\n27 43\n0. 00\n47 03\nTa bl e 11\nFo re ca st er ro r an d pr ed ic tiv\ne pe rf or m an ce\nba se d on\nth e tr ai ni ng\nda ta se to\nn de co m po\nse d co m po\nne nt s w ith\nR es\nno ta s a fe at ur e\nU K -P re\nU K -D\nur in g\nD 1\nD 2\nD 3\nD 4\nS 4 D 1\nD 2\nD 3\nD 4\nS 4\nM A E\n0. 00\n34 64\n0. 00\n30 16\n0. 00\n21 18\n0. 00\n14 9\n0. 00\n25 02\n0. 00\n34 47\n0. 00\n31 97\n0. 00\n22 34\n0. 00\n15 61\n0. 00\n34 51\nR M E S\n0. 00\n53 37\n0. 00\n45 22\n0. 00\n30 89\n0. 00\n21 52\n0. 00\n34 63\n0. 00\n51 11\n0. 00\n52 93\n0. 00\n39 32\n0. 00\n20 76\n0. 00\n45 92\nIA 0. 89\n81 86\n0. 96\n06 23\n0. 98\n86 74\n0. 99\n68 68\n0. 99\n99 32\n0. 90\n23 58\n0. 94\n82 0. 98\n21 25\n0. 99\n81 36\n0. 99\n98 85\nN SC\n0. 75\n75 03\n0. 88\n06 91\n0. 95\n99 22\n0. 98\n81 26\n0. 99\n97 27\n0. 76\n75 36\n0. 85\n19 47\n0. 93\n83 52\n0. 99\n27 61\n0. 99\n95 41\nT I\n0. 00\n56 44\n0. 00\n50 45\n0. 00\n47 6\n0. 00\n50 99\n0. 00\n49 14\n0. 00\n57 01\n0. 00\n63 3\n0. 00\n51 59\n0. 00\n32 37\n0. 00\n79\nU SPr e\nU SD ur in g\nM A E\n0. 01\n56 28\n0. 01\n42 77\n0. 01\n02 84\n0. 00\n80 04\n0. 01\n17 24\n0. 01\n34 37\n0. 01\n19 87\n0. 00\n87 72\n0. 00\n61 02\n0. 00\n78 71\nR M E S\n0. 03\n05 56\n0. 02\n51 09\n0. 01\n70 46\n0. 01\n41 65\n0. 02\n04 45\n0. 01\n91 98\n0. 01\n67 97\n0. 01\n20 81\n0. 00\n88 85\n0. 01\n23 89\nIA 0. 86\n65 41\n0. 94\n12 14\n0. 98\n55 91\n0. 99\n57 65\n0. 99\n96 45\n0. 90\n69 31\n0. 96\n58 05\n0. 98\n96 17\n0. 99\n67 84\n0. 99\n98 15\nN SC\n0. 70\n14 6\n0. 82\n99 12\n0. 94\n89 74\n0. 98\n40 39\n0. 99\n85 92\n0. 77\n41 47\n0. 89\n40 33\n0. 96\n31 4\n0. 98\n77 4\n0. 99\n92 63\nT I\n0. 03\n62 07\n0. 01\n72 46\n0. 01\n98 32\n0. 02\n18 54\n0. 00\n70 33\n0. 02\n06 94\n0. 01\n55 11\n0. 01\n73 83\n0. 01\n29 37\n0. 00\n51 41"
