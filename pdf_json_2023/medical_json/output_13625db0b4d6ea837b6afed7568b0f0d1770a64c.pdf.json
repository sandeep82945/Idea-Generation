It appears in gravity water waves, surface plasmon-polaritons, surface acoustic waves, and exhibits remarkable intrinsic spin-momentum locking, which has found useful applications for efficient spin-direction couplers. Here we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that the transverse spin of surface elastic (Rayleigh) waves has an anomalous sign near the surface, opposite to that in the case of electromagnetic, sound, or water surface waves. This anomalous sign appears due to the hybrid (neither transverse nor longitudinal) nature of elastic surface waves. Furthermore, we show that this sign anomaly can be employed for the selective spin-controlled excitation of symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb modes propagating in opposite directions in an elastic plate. Our results pave the way for spin-controlled manipulation of elastic waves and can be important for a variety of areas, from phononic spin-based devices to seismic waves.\nIntroduction.\u2014 Coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom, i.e., between the intrinsic rotation and external motion of waves or particles, plays an important role in modern physics. It underpins the field of spintronics [1, 2], topological insulators [3, 4], and transverse spin-momentum locking in surface electromagnetic [5, 6] and acoustic [7, 8] waves. The later phenomenon describes the robust link between the direction of propagation of the surface wave and its transverse spin [9, 10], i.e., the orthogonal direction of the intrinsic rotation of the wave field or medium particles. Recently, this effect was employed for highly efficient and reversable spin-to-momentum couplers using electromagnetic and acoustic surface or guided modes [7, 11\u201319].\nThe best known example of the transverse spin and spinmomentum locking is the rotation of water particles in watersurface gravity waves [20], Fig. 1(a). The normal to the water surface (or the wavefield intensity gradient) n, the wave propagation direction (momentum or wave vector) k, and the local water-particle rotation (spin angular momentum [21, 22]) s always form a right-handed triad: s\u00b7(n\u00d7k) > 0. As a result, the reversal of the wave propagation direction inevitably reverses the transverse spin (the particles\u2019 rotation direction) and vice versa. Similar spin-momentum locking occurs in surface electromagnetic (surface plasmon-polaritons) [23] and acoustic [24, 25] waves involving locally rotating electric field and medium particles, respectively [5\u201318]. Despite profound differences between the transverse (divergence-less) electromagnetic waves, longitudinal (curl-less) acoustic waves, and water gravity (divergence-less and curl-less) waves, the (n,k, s) triad is always right-handed, as shown in Fig. 1(a-c).\nIt is well known that surface elastic (Rayleigh) waves also involve elliptical orbits of the medium particles [26\u201328] and\nthus possess a transverse spin [29\u201332]. The efficient spin-todirection coupling using the spin-momentum locking in elastic waves was recently demonstrated [18]; and the rotational motion of the particles in a surface acoustic wave was detected via a rather sophisticated indirect method [33]. In addition, the ellipticity of the near-surface particle motion was studied in seismic Rayleigh waves [34\u201338].\nRemarkably, the spin-normal-momentum triad is lefthanded near the surface for Rayleigh waves: s \u00b7 (n\u00d7 k) < 0, Fig. 1(d). In comparison with water waves, the opposite rotation of the elastic medium particles is sometimes called \u201cretrograde\u201d [26, 28]. Furthermore, the direction of the particles\u2019 rotation, i.e., the spin sign, flips deep into the elastic medium.\nIn this Letter, we explain these spin-sign anomalies in surface elastic waves by their hybrid nature with both longitudinal (curl-less) and transverse (divergence-less) contributions to the wavefield. Such anomalies do not appear in the case of purely longitudinal or transverse waves. We experimentally measure these spin anomalies and provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, measurements of the reversal of the Raleigh-wave spin as a function of the depth. Moreover, we show that the anomalous spin sign in hybrid waves can provide novel functionalities to setups based on the spinmomentum locking. Namely, we demonstrate the selective excitation of oppositely-propagating symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb modes in an elastic plate by a chiral source.\nOur results shed light onto the nature of the anomalous behaviour of the transverse spin in elastic waves, provide a new tool for elastic spin-orbit coupling manipulations, and can find applications in condensed-matter systems involving phonon spin [39\u201342], elastic metamaterials [43\u201346], and various seismic-waves studies [28, 34\u201338, 47, 48].\nar X\niv :2\n30 8.\n01 95\n3v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. ap\npph\n] 3\nA ug\n2 02\n3\n2 solid water air \u2207 \u22c5 v = \u2207 \u00d7 v = 0\n\u2207 \u00d7 v = 0\n\u2207 \u22c5 E = 0\n\u2207 \u22c5 u \u2260 0 \u2207 \u00d7 u \u2260 0\nvacuum\nfree boundary\nfree boundary\n(a) (b)\n\u03c1 < 0(c) (d)\n\u03b5 < 0 x\nz\ny\nn\nk\n(a .u .)

(d) Elastic Rayleigh waves at the surface of an isotropic solid are described by a hybrid displacement field which has both longitudinal and transverse contributions, Eq. (2).\nSpin sign anomalies in surface Rayleigh waves.\u2014 The absolute and normalized densities of the spin angular momentum in monochromatic acoustic waves in nondispersive fluids or solids can be written as [7, 8, 21, 29\u201332, 49]:\nS = \u03c1\u03c9 2 Im(u\u2217 \u00d7 u) , s = Im(u \u2217 \u00d7 u) |u|2\n(1)\nHere \u03c1 is the mass density of the medium, \u03c9 is the wave frequency, u(r) is the wave-induced complex displacement amplitude of the medium particles, whereas the real timedependent displacement is given by Re(u e\u2212i\u03c9t). Equation (1) has a universal form, wherein S represents the real spin angular momentum of elastic vibration that is related to the mechanical torque, and |s| \u2264 1 describes the ellipticity of the field u [50]. Both S and s are directed along the normal to the polarization ellipse of u. This equation also describes the spin in water surface waves [22, 49], while the spin density in electromagnetic waves is expressed similarly with the electric wavefield E instead of the particle velocity \u2212i\u03c9u and the medium permittivity \u03b5 instead of \u03c1 [9, 10].\nConsider a surface wave propagating along the x-direction at the z = 0 surface and having the form \u221d exp(ikxx \u2212 \u03baz), kx > 0, \u03ba > 0, in the medium z > 0. Purely transverse waves (e.g., surface plasmon-polaritons with \u2207 \u00b7E = 0\n[23]), purely longitudinal waves (e.g., surface acoustic waves with \u2207\u00d7 u = 0 [24, 25]), and simultaneously transverse and longitudinal waves (e.g., gravity water waves with \u2207 \u00b7 u = \u2207 \u00d7 u = 0 [20]) are all characterized by an elliptical polarization of the wavefield in the propagation (x, z) plane and the corresponding transverse spin Sy \u2261 S < 0 forming the righthanded triad (s,n,k) [7\u201310, 15, 51], see Fig. 1(a\u2013c) [52]. Here and hereafter we consider only 2D (x, z) fields and the transverse spin having only the y-component, omitting the index y for the sake of brevity. Surprisingly, the transverse spin of surface elastic Rayleigh waves behaves quite differently, as shown in Fig. 1(d) [26\u201328]. First, S > 0 near the surface, so that (s,n,k) is a left-handed triad. Second, the spin sign flips at some distance from the surface: S < 0 for z > zc > 0.\nTo explain these two anomalies, we note that the Rayleigh wave is formed by a hybrid of longitudinal (compression) and transverse (shear) oscillations of the medium. Its wavefield can be expressed as a sum of longitudinal and transverse contributions:\nu = ul + ut , \u2207\u00d7 ul = 0 , \u2207 \u00b7 ut = 0 . (2)\nThese two contributions have different amplitudes and exponential decay rates: ul,t = Al,t exp(ikxx \u2212 \u03bal,tz). Substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), we find that there are purely longitudinal, purely transverse, and \u2018hybrid\u2019 contributions to the Rayleigh-wave spin [29]:\ns = 1\n|u|2 Im[(u\u2217l + u \u2217 t )\u00d7 (ul + ut)] = sll + stt + slt + stl .\n(3)\nFor 2D fields under consideration, sab = 2 Im(u\u2217a zub x)/|u|2, i.e., the \u2018pure\u2019 contributions sll and stt are determined by the elliptical polarizations of the fields ul and ut, while the hybrid contributions slt and stl are determined by the elliptical polarizations of the \u2018mixed\u2019 fields ult = (ul z, ut x) and utl = (ut z, ul x), respectively. The polarizations of these pure and mixed fields are shown in Fig. 2(a). Remarkably, the pure contributions to the spin are always negative: sll < 0, stt < 0, while the hybrid contributions are positive: slt > 0, stl > 0 (see Supplementary Materials [53]). Thus, it is the balance of these contributions that determines the sign of the Rayleigh-wave spin. Near the surface, the hybrid contributions always prevail and the spin becomes positive. However, the longitudinal, transverse, and hybrid contributions contain different z-dependences: \u221d exp(\u22122\u03balz), \u221d exp(\u22122\u03batz), and \u221d exp[\u2212(\u03bal + \u03bat)z], respectively. Since \u03bat < \u03bal, the hybrid contributions decay faster than the transverse one, and the sum of pure contributions start to prevail after some z = zc (zc \u2243 0.2\u03bbR, where \u03bbR = 2\u03c0/kx is the wavelength of the Rayleigh wave). Thus, the anomalous spin sign at z = 0 can be attributed to the existence of hybrid contributions, while the reversal of the spin direction at z = zc is due to the faster decay of the hybrid contributions compared to the pure ones.\nAlthough the near-surface spin/ellipticity in surface acoustic [16, 18, 33] and seismic [34\u201338] waves has been measured,\n3\nits z-dependence, sign reversal, and pure/hybrid contributions have never been observed experimentally. We performed experimental measurements of the (x, z)-plane vibrations in a Rayleigh wave with frequency f = \u03c9/2\u03c0 = 35 kHz propagating along the surface of an aluminum plate. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2(b). The x-propagating Rayleigh wave was excited by a PZT piezoelectric ring attached to the edge of the plate, z = 0, where the electric signal was generated by the function generator (RIGOL DG1032z) and then amplified by the power amplifier (Aigtek ATA-2022H). The plate thickness along the z-axis is 1.2m, which can be considered as infinite compared with the skin depth of the Rayleigh wave at 35 kHz.\nTo observe the spin-sign flip, we measured the 2D displacement field u at different z-points. In order to do this in an opaque material (aluminium) in the ultrasonic frequency range (which is close to the application of surfaceacoustic-wave devices), we used vibrations of seven triangular prisms attached to the original plate at z = (0.3, 0.8, 1.26, 1.7, 2.2, 2.7, 3.1) cm, see the inset in Fig. 2(b). By measuring the normal displacements of the two sides of each prism using two lasers Doppler vibrometers (Polytec OFV 2570) we extracted the 2D displacement vector. Namely, for the two lasers directed at angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 with respect to the z-axis and measuring the vibration signal u1 and u2, the resulting displacement vector has components ux = u1 sin \u03b81 + u2 sin \u03b82 and uz = u1 cos \u03b81 + u2 cos \u03b82.\nFigure 2(c) shows the results of these measurements of the z-dependence of the normalized spin density s = 2 Im(u\u2217zux)/ ( |ux|2 + |uz|2 ) . It clearly exhibits the spin-\nsign anomalies in perfect agreement with the theoretical calculations. We have also retrieved the separate contributions sab, which explain the origin of the nontrivial behavior of the Rayleigh-wave spin, from the measurements of the aluminium-plate strain. These results are shown in the Sup-\nplementary Materials [53].\nAnomalous spin-momentum locking in the thin-plate Lamb modes.\u2014 Importantly, the spin-sign anomalies in surface elastic waves are not merely curious facts but tools which could provide new functionalities to acoustic spin-based setups. To show this, we consider the spin-momentum locking using thin-plate modes. Such plates can support symmetric and antisymmetric lowest-order modes: short-range and long-range surface plasmons for metalic films [54] or S0 and A0 Lamb modes for elastic plates [27, 55]. Akin to Figs. 1(b)\u2013(d), Figs. 3(a)\u2013(c) show the transverse spin densities S for symmetric and antisymmetric electromagnetic, acoustic, and elastic modes. One can see that the electromagnetic and acoustic modes posses similar spin distributions with no qualitative difference between the symmetric and anti-symmetric modes. In turn, the elastic case exhibits a remarkable anomaly: the spin distributions have opposite signs for the S0 and A0 Lamb modes. Figure 4(a) shows that, akin to the Rayleighwave case, this anomaly is caused by the hybrid contributions (slt+stl) to the spin density, which have an opposite sign and prevails over the pure contributions (sll+stt) in the A0 mode, but not in the S0 mode.\nSince the spin sign reverses with the reversal of the wave propagation direction, it determines the intrinsic spinmomentum locking in surface waves, with useful spin-todirection coupling applications [5\u201319]. This means that sources with opposite circular polarizations in the (x, z) plane excite oppositely-propagating surface waves. Applying this to the modes in Fig. 3, one can see that a circularly-polarized source located near one of the plate surfaces will excite symmetric and antisymmetric electromagnetic or acoustic modes propagating in the same direction, but the S0 and A0 elastic modes propagating in opposite directions. This provides a new tool for the efficient selective coupling to the symmetric and anti-symmetric Lamb waves.\n4 solid free boundary\nfree boundary\nsymmetricanti-symmetric\nx\nz\ny\nS (a. u.) solid free boundary\nfree boundary\nair\n\u03c1 < 0\n\u03c1 < 0\nvacuum\n\u03b5 < 0\n\u03b5 < 0\nvacuum\n\u03b5 < 0\n\u03b5 < 0\nair\n\u03c1 < 0\n\u03c1 < 0 k\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFIG. 3. Transverse spin density in the lowest-order anti-symmetric (A0) and symmetric (S0) modes in electromagnetic (a), acoustic (b), and elastic (c) thin-plate/slit systems, cf. Figs. 1(b)\u2013(d). The A0 elastic Lamb mode has a reversed spin sign compared to its electromagnetic and acoustic counterparts.\nWe performed experiments confirming such selective excitation of the Lamb modes in an aluminum strip of thickness 2d = 6 cm. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 4(b). To create a circularly-polarized source, we installed a pair of PZT rings on two sides of a square aluminum block attached to the strip. The PZT rings can excite displacements perpendicular to its mounting surface, so that the two rings produced vibrations along the x and z axes. By adjusting the phase difference \u00b1\u03c0/2 between these vibrations, we obtained a right-hand/lefthand circularly polarized source with positive/negative spin s.\nIn both cases this source excited elastic modes propagating in opposite +x and \u2212x directions. Choosing a right-handed source with s = +1, we sent wavepacket-like signals with central frequency f = 20 kHz and duration T = 2.5\u00d710\u22124 s, corresponding to a five-cycled tone burst pulse [18]. By perforating small V-shape grooves in the sample [18] at x = \u221245 cm and x = 45 cm we confirmed that the +x and \u2212x propagating waves carry positive spin determined by the chiral source [53]. To measure the A0/S0 character of the right-/left-propagating waves, we measured the displacement uz(t, x) on the surface of the plate (using the laser Doppler vibrometer) versus time and x-coordinate (with 1 cm intervals) and Fourier-transformed the measured signals to the (\u03c9, kx)\nA0 mode S0 mode\nA0 mode S0 mode\n0120 -120 0\n60\n30\nA0\n0 max\nz/d\nx\nz\ny\nx > 0 x < 0\n|uz |\nS0\n(a)\nkx (m\u22121)\nf ( kH\nz )\ns s sh sp\nsh\nsp z/d\nS > 0 S > 0\nS > 0source aluminium strip\naluminium block PZT\n0\n60\n30\n(b)\n(c)\n0120 -120 kx (m\u22121)\nFIG. 4.

The parameters used here are: f = 20 kHz and d = 3 cm. (b) Schematics of the experimental setup for the spin-induced directional excitation of the Lamb modes. A circularly-polarized source with spin s = +1, placed at the edge of an aluminum plate, x = 0, z = \u2212d, excites oppositely-propagating A0 and S0 modes. (c) The experimentally measured Fourier (\u03c9, kx) spectra of the excited waves in the x > 0 and x < 0 zones of the plate versus the calculated spectra of the A0 and S0 Lamb modes. One can clearly see the spin-induced counter-directional propagation of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes.\nspace. The results of such measurements in opposite +x and \u2212x directions are shown in Fig. 4(c). Comparison with the dispersion curves of the S0 and A0 Lamb modes [53] clearly shows that our source with s = +1 excited the S0 mode propagating in the \u2212x direction and the A0 mode propagating in the +x direction. This confirms the spin-controlled counterdirectional excitation of the symmetric and anti-symemtric Lamb modes.\nThe polarizations of the A0 and S0 modes at the plate edges are actually elliptical rather than perfectly circular. These polarizations depend on the frequency and can even reverse the direction of rotation, i.e., spin (for the S0 mode at f \u2243 37 kHz). For details see the Supplementary Materials [53]. In\n5 our experiment we chose the central frequency f = 20 kHz such that the edge polarizations are close enough to opposite circular polarizations, and that it is below the cutoff frequency of higher-order modes.\nConclusions.\u2014 We have examined, both theoretically and experimentally, the unusual behavior of the transverse spin and spin-momentum locking in surface elastic waves. These properties exhibit several sign anomalies as compared with their electromagnetic, acoustic, and water-wave counterparts. We have shown that all these anomalies originate from the hybrid nature of surface elastic waves including the transverse (curl-less) and longitudinal (divergence-less) field contributions. We have experimentally measured the nontrivial distribution of the elastic spin density in surface Rayleigh waves. Furthermore, we have predicted and observed the unusual spin-momentum locking of the Lamb modes of a thin elastic plate. A chiral source located near an edge of the plate allows an efficient directional coupling to the counter-propagating symmetric S0 and antisymmetric A0 Lamb modes. Our results provide insights into fundamental physical properties of the spin and \u2018hybrid spin\u2019 in elastic waves and offer new tools for spin-controlled manipulation of surface elastic waves in condensed-matter, metamaterial, and seismic systems.\nIt is worth remarking that the normalized elastic spin, studied in this work, is closely related to the H/V ratio (ellipticity), which is one of the main parameters in studies of seismic Rayleigh waves [34\u201338]. In particular, the spin and H/V ratio have similar z-dependences and vanish in the same points. Our experimental technique can be further applied to inhomogeneous materials to compare with numerical calculations of the seismic H/V ratio and verification of the Earth models used there.\nThis work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFA1404400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 11935010, and 12172256), the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (20ZR1462700, 23ZR1481200, 23XD1423800), and the Opening Project of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Special Artificial Microstructure Materials and Technology.
