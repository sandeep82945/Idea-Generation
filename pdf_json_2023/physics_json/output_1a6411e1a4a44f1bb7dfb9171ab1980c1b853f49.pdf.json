Hu et al. reported an Mo, Mg co-modified Sn-\u03b2 catalyst for the catalytic transformation of glucose and fructose into alkyl lactate at moderate temperatures. The results show that both the Mo species and the synergetic effect between Mo and neighboring Mg species are important in enabling the retro-aldol condensation of fructose. The selection of solvent was also found to be important for both product yield and selectivity.\nThe conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added products is an urgent research field aimed at not only curbing carbon emissions but also realizing circular carbon economy. Zhang et al. summarize the recent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)based catalysts for the process of hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, methane, and other C2+ products. The design strategies of MOF materials are also provided in order to boost the overall efficiency of CO2 conversion and utilization processes.\nSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted significant attention in the research field of heterogeneous catalysis. However, the rational design of well-performed SACs still remains challenging. Zhai et al. discuss a rational design of a Pd1-Pd NPs hybrid structure on a 2,6-pyridinedicarbonitrile-derived covalent triazine framework. This synthesized strategy allows for the regulation of the ratio of Pd1 and Pd NPs, and the typical sample presents the optimal catalytic activity with a formate formation rate of 3. 66 molHCOOM \u00b7molPd\u22121 \u00b7 h\u22121.\nAtomically precise gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) have highly specific surface areas and many unsaturated active sites, such that they are widely explored in the development of new heterogeneous catalysts. Hu et al. summarize the photophysical properties of several Au NCs and discuss their application in different photocatalytic reactions. The typical properties, including discrete energy levels; tunable photophysical and electrochemical properties, including visible to near-infrared absorption; microsecond longlived excited-state lifetime; and redox chemistry are highlighted.\nMethane is the cleanest fossil fuel resource with low carbon emissions; in the pursuit of carbon neutrality, catalytic methane combustion (CMC) has attracted significant attention in the efforts to curb unwanted automobile emissions as well as in green energy generation. Gao et al. focus on the transition metal oxide catalysts applied in CMC due to their comparable catalytic performance with\nthat of precious metals. The authors also comprehensively summarize four different kinetic reactionmodels that have been proposed for CMC and future research prospects in this reaction field.\nAs mentioned, SACs catalysts constitute a research Frontier in heterogeneous catalysts. Liu et al. summarize SAC materials from the unique angle of their stability and activity at high temperatures. The authors collected the latest efforts in the development of thermally-stable SACs at elevated temperatures through the reverse-Ostwald ripening mechanism, especially for the approaches of atom trapping and vapor-phase self-assembly strategies. Other factors that can affect the thermal stability of SACs catalysts at high temperatures are also summarized, including the loading upper limit, the location of the metal single atom, the reducibility of lattice oxygen, and so on.\nWe are thankful to all authors for their meaningful works and to all the reviewers for their constructive suggestions and opinions. We expect that this Research Topic will encourage more researchers to discover and design novel catalysts in the future, as well as promote the in-depth development of well-performed catalytic applications."
