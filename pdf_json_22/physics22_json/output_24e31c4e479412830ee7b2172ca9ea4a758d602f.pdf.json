            "text": "SX Phoenicis (SX Phe) stars are typically found in the galaxy's outer regions, known as the galactic halo. Their luminosity changes over 1-2 hours. They are intriguing because they are very old but haven't turned into white dwarfs as expected. These stars exhibit short-period pulsation behaviour that varies on time scales ranging from 0.03 to 0.08 days (0.7 to 1.9 hours). SX Phe has spectral classifications in the A2-F5 range and magnitude differences of up to 0.7.\nGiclas et al. (1970) discovered BL Cam (=GD 428 in Simbad, 2MASS J03471987+6322422, Gaia\nDR2 487276688415703040), which was thought to be a candidate for a white dwarf. It is a pulsating star with a period of 0.039 days and an amplitude of 0.33 mag, according to Berg & Duthie (1977). McNamara (1997) classified it as a Population II star with a metal abundance of [Fe/H] = 2.4. Previous researchers have looked into its multiperiodic character (Fauvaud et al. 2006; Rodrguez et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2008). Hintz et al. (1997) measured 32.679 c/d for the first overtone and 0.783 for the period ratio of the first overtone to the fundamental mode. Previous authors (Zhou et al. 1999; Kim & Sim 1999; Zhou et al. 2001; Wolf et al. 2002) had also discovered the initial overtone at 31.6 cd, resulting in a period ratio of 0.810. Fu et al., on the other hand, did not detect the first overtone (2008). In a multi-site photometric investigation of BL Cam, Rodrguez et al. (2007) discovered 21 distinct pulsation frequencies (excluding the basic mode) with amplitudes ranging from 1.6 to 7.4 mag.\nAccording to Zong et al. (2019), the period content of BL Cam is dominated by 25.5790 (3) c/d and\nits two harmonics, as well as an independent frequency of 25.247 (2)c/d. An analysis of their times of maxima from the literature determined a periodic change which made BL Cam a binary system. Pena et al. (2021) has shown that the evolution of the ephemerides of the different authors was natural and correct given the shortness of the available data at their times. With a longer time, horizon, they demonstrated that the longterm variation is caused by a binary system.\nIn the present paper, we carried out photometric and spectroscopic observations for the star BL Cam.\nModel atmosphere analysis will be performed to determine the effective temperature and surface gravity of the star. Frequency analysis, O-C light curve, and period change of the star are investigated. The structure of the paper is as follows. The photometric analysis is presented in section 2, the spectral analysis is described in section 3, section 4 is devoted to the determination of the physical parameters and evolution state of the star, the conclusion reached is presented in section 5."

            "text": "The frequency analysis of the BL Cam light curves was carried out with the help of two codes: PERIOD04 (Lenz and Breger 2005) and Peranso V3.0.3.4 (www.cbabelgium.com/peranso). Both codes searched for significant peaks in the amplitude spectra using Fourier transformations of the light curves. Following the first frequency computation, we create the \"periodogram\" by fitting a sinusoid to the Period04 period and then subtracting the sinusoid from the original magnitude (pre-whitening). Then we calculate the periodogram again, but at this moment the first frequency will not be presented, so the highest peak in the periodogram will be the next frequency. We repeated this procedure many times if necessary to search for other peaks until no more peaks could be seen in the periodogram.\nTable 1 displays the results of all cases, including the frequency value (F), its corresponding amplitude\n(A), phase, and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The V-band light curve analysis reveals two peaks in the periodogram at 0.03909787d (25.5768439 c/d) (Figure 3, upper panel) and 0.02922582 d (34.2163162c/d) (Figure 3, lower panel), with no identified peaks in the other bands. \u03b4 Scuti stars have a frequency range of 3- 80 c/d, with frequencies less than 3 c/d possibly due to atmospheric effects or observational errors (Breger, 2000). The sum of the squared residuals (\u03c72) derived from a multi-parameter least squares fit of sinusoidal functions was used to calculate the error for each value. Figure 3 depicts the frequency spectra, Fourier fits on the observational points for all sets of observations and the spectral window of each star.\n2.3. O-C Light Curve and Period Change\nTo construct the O-C light curve we used the Hertzsprung (1928) method to determine the time of brightness minima or maxima. We used all the data published in the literature to fill in the gaps in the O-C diagram, if the scatter is about the same as the scatter in the raw data (about 0.2 mag.) we use it. Figure 4 depicts all of the maximum-light times used to investigate the period change. To derive the O-C differences for BL Cam from a computed linear ephemeris, we used the method described by Abdel-Sabour et al. (2020). We take care to establish a reference time of maximum light from existing photoelectric observations, and the adopted pulsation period is based on recent observations of the star from KAO data. The least-square fit by the parabolic elements of the star under consideration is given by the following relationship:\n2 0HJD =M +PE+QEmax . Where M0 is a new epoch, P is the new period, and Q is used to measure the period change values (dP dt\u2044 )\nin seconds per year (dP/dt=(2Q/P)365.25x24x60x60).\nTo fit the O-C residuals, we used a second-order polynomial least-squares method. To justify its validity over all epochs of observations, the new ephemeris was tested with all available photometric observations from ASAS, KWS, and KAO for the star. For the light maximum, the linear ephemeris equation of Hintz et al. (1997) was used, which is:\nmaxHJD =2443125.8026+0.03909783E The 55 new times of maximum light obtained for BL Cam are presented in Table2. The Least square fit for O-C with root mean square R2=0.954 is\n( ) ( ) ( )-8 -13 2-2MAX -5.0349HJD =7.994 14 x10 15 x10 E-3.2757 69 x10 E ,\nThe parabolic trend in O-C data reflects a regular period decrease or increase. After constructing the O-C diagram we found the increasing period rate given by equation 0.17028E-02 \u00b10.14378dP/dt= E-05 s/yr or\n1 (dP/dt)=0.0436 P -1yr , the standard deviation of the residuals of parabolic fit to the O-C values is 0d.002 with\na correlation coefficient of 0.97."

The spectra were taken with the Kottamia Faint Imaging spectropolarimeter (KFISP) mounted on the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory's 1.88 m telescope (KAO) (Azzam et al., 2021). The spectra were captured on a single night (25-11-2021). The data were reduced using the Astropy-affiliated package CCDPROC (Craig et al., 2017). We used van Dokkum and Pieter (2001) LACosmic routine to remove cosmic rays from the images processed by Astro-SCRAPPY (McCully et al., 2018). A special Python routine was used to extract the spectra and calibrate the wavelength. Using IRAF methods, the spectra were flux calibrated. The signal-to-noise ratio was calculated with specutils snr derived function (Earl et al., 2021). Table 3 shows the log of the spectroscopic observations. We plotted the BL Cam spectra in Figure 5.

As input models for LTE calculations, we used ATLAS9 grids (Kurucz, 1995), assuming solar metallicity, a microturbulent velocity of 2 km/s, and a mixing length to scale height ratio of 1.25. The effective temperatures span the model grid's temperature range of 250 K. The surface gravities of the models are of 1 log g 5  . The SPECTRUM code (Gray 1992, 1993) is used\nto synthesize LTE spectra (for the range   1500 \u2013 8000 \u00c5). SPECTRUM takes the columns for mass depth points, temperatures, and total pressure and calculates them at each stage in the process using a system of seven nonlinear equilibrium equations.\nWe developed a FORTRAN code that compares the flux values at each point on the spectrum. It then\ntabulates the differences to produce a single number that characterizes how good the fit is. Because the spectral resolution of the observed spectra differs from that of the grid, the synthetic spectra are convolved to achieve the same resolution. For this purpose, a Gaussian profile with FWHM = 5 A\u00b0 is used. We adjusted the wavelength scale to begin comparing the observed and grid spectra. We used the cross-correlation method to calculate the correlation coefficient, which gives us the line shifts. After that, we developed a code that minimizes the Euclidian distance between the observed spectra and the theoretical ones to compare the grid\nwith the observed spectra. The equivalent widths of the spectral lines are calculated numerically using the Runge-Kutta technique.\nFollowing the above procedure, we calculated the effective temperatures and the surface gravities of\nthe star at different phases listed in Table 3. The mean effective temperature and surface gravity of the star is\nadopted as effT 7625 300=  K and log g 4.30 0.37=  dex. Figure 6 shows the best fit of spectral lines at different phases in both red and blue parts of the spectrum. In most cases, we obtained a good fit for the line centers, while the large difference between the observed and the synthetic spectra occurs for the line wings.\nTable 4 listed the equivalent widths of some spectral lines at different phases. The maximum variations\nof the equivalent widths with phases are 26%, 9%, 7%, 7%, and 25% for the lines H , H , H , H , NaI\nrespectively. These variations raise the prospect that BL Cam is a binary star. We think that, high-resolution spectroscopic data is strongly needed to investigate the possibility of the binarity of the star.\nBL Cam."

The stellar radius is calculated from a polynomial fit to the temperature-radius relation of Gray (1992) as R/R\u2299= 1.494\u00b10.032. The masses M can be calculated from the relation of Cox (1999) Log M= 0.46 -0.10 Mbol as M = 1.338M\u0298 Consequently the luminosity as L/L\u0298= 3.642.

The results are presented in Table 4. For the low-frequency pulsations (\u03bd \u2264 25d-1)), there is a good agreement with Bowman (2016).\nIn Figure 7, we plotted the mass-luminosity relation (M-L) and mass-radius relation (M-R) for both\nzero-age main-sequence stars (ZAMS) and terminal-age main-sequence stars (TAMS) with Z = 0.014 of Girardi et al.

The tracks are plotted for the metallicity values Z=0.019 ([Fe/H] = -1.61) and Z=0.03 ([Fe/H] = -1.41). In the right panel of Figure 8, we plotted the isochrones appropriate for the effective temperature and luminosity of BL Cam, which indicated that the star has crossed the instability strip's red edge (RE).

According to the Fourier analysis of the light curves, the fundamental mode has two harmonics at 25.5768439 c/d and 34.2163162 c/d. We combined the new times of maximum light with those provided by previous literature to perform an O-C analysis for the period change for BL Cam, yielding 55 times of maximum light. The variation rate of the fundamental period derived from the long time scale of observations shows a negative period change.\nWe used LTE model atmospheres to simulate the observed spectra and to calculate equivalent widths\nof some spectral lines. By comparing the spectra to the appropriate synthetic spectra, the effective\ntemperatures and surface gravities at different phases are calculated. We adopted the effective temperature\nand surface gravity of BL Cam as effT 7625 300=  K and log g 4.30 0.37=  dex, which is in good agreement with earlier studies. Our analysis of the spectra of BL Cam indicated that the variations of the equivalent\nwidths of some spectral lines at different phases are 26%, 9%, 7%, 7%, and 25% for the lines H , H , H ,\nH , NaI respectively.
