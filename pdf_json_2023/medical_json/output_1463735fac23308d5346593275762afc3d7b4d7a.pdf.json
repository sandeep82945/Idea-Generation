    "abstractText": "Background Lung cancer is reported to be the leading cause of death in males and females, globally. Increasing evidence highlights the paramount importance of Lactate dehydrogenase D (LDHD) in different types of cancers, though it\u2019s role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still inadequately explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate and determine the relationship between LDHD and LUAD. Methods The collection of the samples was guided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). To ascertain various aspects around LDHD function, we analyzed different expression genes (DEGs), functional enrichment, and protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) networks. The predictive values for LDHD were collectively determined using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram. Evaluation of the immune infiltration analysis was completed using Estimate and ssGSEA. The prediction of the immunotherapy response was based on TIDE and IPS. The LDHD expression levels in LUAD were validated through Western blot, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry methods. Wound healing and transwell assays were also performed to illustrate the aggressive features in LUAD cell lines. Results The results showed that LDHD was generally downregulated in LUAD patients, with the low LDHD group presenting a decline in OS, DSS, and PFI. Enriched pathways, which include pyruvate metabolism, central carbon metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation were observed through KEGG analysis. It was also noted that the expression of LDHD expression was inversely related to immune cell infiltration and typical checkpoints. The high LDHD group\u2019s response to immunotherapy was remarkable, particularly in CTAL4 + /PD1therapy. In vitro studies revealed that the overexpression of LDHD caused tumor migration and invasion to be suppressed. Conclusion In conclusion, our study revealed that LDHD might be an effective predictor of prognosis and immune filtration, possibly leading to better choices for immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is associated with high incidence and mortality, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounting for approximately 40% of all global cases. According to the estimation by the American Cancer Society, about 127,070 people might succumb to lung cancer by the end of 2023, and this translates to 20% of the total cancer mortality [1, 2]. Currently, much has been done with regard to treatment methods for LUAD, considering that development of personalized treatment is underway. Some of the notable developments are the generalization of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy and target therapy [3]. However, only 20% of locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients can benefit from immunotherapy. This is explained by the heterogeneity and complexity that is associated with tumors [2]. As a result, the prognosis of LUAD remains poor, leading to a survival rate of around 18% over a period of five years [4]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers that have relatively higher sensitivity and specificity, so that the prognosis of LUAD can be improved.\nTumor cells use glycolysis to satisfy biosynthesis and ATP synthesis, even when adequate oxygen is available and this phenomenon is called the Warburg effect [5, 6]. During this distinctive energy production process by cancerous cells, lactate is formed at a faster rate [6, 7]. Previous reports have emphasized the importance of increasing lactate production, which worsen the prognosis in numerous carcinomas, including lung cancer. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is encoded by LDHA, LDHB, LDHC and LDHD and it is the key tetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of pyruvate to lactate either aerobically or anaerobically. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the carcinogenic function of LDHA and LDHB in various tumors [8\u201312]. For example, some studies have highlighted the notion that elevating LDHA levels in papillary thyroid carcinoma can promote tumorigenesis and metastasis via the AMPK signal pathway [13]. It is important to note that only a few studies have focused on the mechanism of LDHD in cancer so far.\nLactate dehydrogenase D (LDHD) is a flavoenzyme that is reportedly located in the mitochondrial [14]. Progressively increasing evidence showed that the expression and function of LDHD is tissue specific. LDHD levels are elevated in prostate cancer and uterine sarcoma, where the flavoenzyme serves as an oncogene [15, 16]. One study reported that the suppression of LDHD in cell renal carcinoma, significantly reduced the overall survival rate of the patients [17]. Currently, the expression and nonenzymatic mechanism of LDHD in LUAD have not been elucidated so it requires further exploration.\nThis study was conducted to investigate the expression and function of LDHD in LUAD. The results from the analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) showed a reduction in the expression of LDHD in LUAD. Moreover, the Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, and protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were used to evaluate the key genes and signal pathways that are involved in LDHD. The prognostic values of LDHD were assessed done using ROC curves and a nomogram model, based on clinicopathological information. Our study revealed an inverse relationship between immune cell infiltration and LDHD. It is impressive that better response to immunotherapy was observed in the high LDHD group. In\u00a0vitro, LDHD also contributed to migration and invasion. And the workflow was shown in Fig.\u00a01. This study presents a novel potential biomarker named LDHD, thereby contributing to immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy and the prognosis of tumor. This might contribute to improving the treatment of LUAD."

The transcriptomic data of 516 LUAD and 59 normal samples were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https:// portal. gdc. cancer. gov/) database [18]. The RNA-seq data was converted from the FPKM format to the TPM (transcripts per million reads) version for subsequent analyses. Additional normal expression data were obtained from the Genotype Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) (https:// www. gtexp ortal. org) database (n = 288). The expression of LDHD was validated using Microarray data from GSE32863, GSE63459, and GSE74706.\nDEGs Between LDHD high expression and\u00a0low expression Groups in\u00a0LUAD The median expression levels of LDHD were used to divide lung adenocarcinoma patients in the TCGA database into two groups as follows: LDHD high-expression group and LDHD low-expression group. The R package DESeq2(1.38.1) [19] was used to determine the expression differences between the two groups. The thresholds for the DEGs were |log2-fold change (FC)|> 2.0 and adjusted p < 0.05. And the top-10 DEGs was evaluated using a heatmap."

This tool\ninvolves three constituents, which are the cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF), and biological process (BP) [20]. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a collection of databases that are reservoirs for information on genomes, biological pathways, diseases, and chemicals [21]. The Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) evaluates the distribution trend of genes that are ranked by phenotype correlation in a gene table, so as to ascertain their role in disease [22]. The R package clusterProfiler (3.14.3) was employed in these functional enrichment analyses [23]. The c2.cp. v7.2.symbols.gmt data set in the Molecular Signature Database (MsigDB) was used as the functional gene set. Each analysis procedure was repeated 1,000 times. Gene sets with p < 0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were considered to be significantly enriched gene sets.\nProtein\u2013protein Interaction network The protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs with threshold value | log2FC |> 2.0 was constructed using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING, https:// string- db. org/) online database. The top-10 HUB genes were evaluated using the MCC algorithm of CytoHubba in Cytoscape (version 3.7.2) [24]. The top 50 binding proteins that interacted with LDHD were obtained from the STRING database, and the set parameters were as follows: minimum required interaction score (\"medium confidence (0.400)\") and active interaction score (\"experiment, text mining, database\"). The Cytoscape software (version 3.7.2) was used to visualize protein interactions, while the top-10 Hub genes were assessed using the CytoHubba plug-in."

ROC curves were created and calibration was done to assess the fitness of the nomogram. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) usually ranged between 0.5 and 1. As shown in the calibration figure, there was a 45-degree line that served as an ideal line.\nThe closer the time-dependent and ideal lines were the better the predictive ability of the nomogram [26]. The nomogram and calibration plot were generated by the RMS package (version 6.2\u20130) and survival package (version 3.2\u201310) was for predicting OS [27]. Time-dependent ROC analysis at 1-, 3-, and 5-year was performed using the R package time ROC (0.4).\nImmune infiltration analysis and\u00a0estimation of\u00a0sensitivity to\u00a0immunotherapy The immunescore was calculated by the estimation algorithm using the \"Estimate\" R package (1.0.13) [28]. The single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm served as a tool for evaluating the relative enrichment of infiltrating immune cells in LUAD. Samples from the gene expression profile of each tumor quantify the relative concentration of each type of immune cell grading, completed by the GSVA R package (1.34.0) [29]. The Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the correlation between LDHD expression and immune cells. Variations in immune infiltration levels between the LDHD high and low expression groups were determined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Further analysis was done on the correlation between LDHD and the immune checkpoints PD1, PD-L1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, and TIGIT [30]. The immunotherapeutic effect and immune escape based on the expression of LDHD were predicted from the Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) (http:// tcia. at/) and Tumor immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) database (http:// tide. dfci. harva rd. edu/) [31, 32]."

This study focused on the differences in LDHD levels in lung adenocarcinoma. After combing relevant data from GTEx and TCGA, we found LDHD expression was decreased in tumor tissues, which was also observed in 58 paired tissues (Fig.\u00a0 2B, C). Furthermore, the lower expression of LDHD was validated in GSE32863, GSE63459, and GSE74706 (Fig.\u00a0 2D-F). The clinicopathological differences between the high and low expression groups of LDHD were also found, including primary therapy outcome and number pack years smoked (Table\u00a01). Overall, the obtained results suggested the potential application of that LDHD as a diagnostic biomarker in LUAD."

In this study, we used Estimate and ssGSEA to determine the differences in immune infiltration. The results showed negative correlation between LDHD expression and the immuneScore (Fig.\u00a08A). Significant differences in expression were shown by ssGSEA in 14 immune cells. It is important to note that immunosuppressive cells (Tregs and Th2) were highly expressed in the low LDHD group (Fig.\u00a0 8B-C). The results from the Spearman correlation analysis were displayed in Fig.\u00a0 8C and Supplementary Figure S4.\nExpression of\u00a0immune checkpoint genes and\u00a0assessment of\u00a0sensitivity to\u00a0immunotherapy Classic emerging immune checkpoint genes were analyzed in the low and high LDHD groups. Interestingly,\nthe included genes were highly expressed in the low LDHD group (Fig.\u00a0 9A). Based on the relationship between LDHD and immune checkpoint genes, the sensitivity of LUAD patients to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy was further explored. TIDE is a web platform that works by modeling tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion, in order to predict ICB clinical response. The high LDHD group seemingly showed better sensitivity to immunotherapy, as shown by the higher immunotherapy responder rate, TIDE score, and exclusion score (Fig.\u00a0 9B-D). The immunophenoscore (IPS) further validated the fact that high LDHD tumor was associated with high immunogenicity and that the high LDHD group might benefit from the CTAL4 + / PD1- therapy (Fig.\u00a09E-H).\nLDHD was\u00a0lowly expressed and\u00a0influenced the\u00a0migration and\u00a0invasion in\u00a0LUAD First, LDHD expression was detected in six pairs of LUAD tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues by IHC. Compared to the corresponding non-cancerous tissues, the cancer ones exhibited lower LDHD expression (Fig.\u00a010A). Furthermore, Western blotting and qPCR confirmed that LDHD protein and mRNA levels in various human LUAD cell lines were lower in normal lung cell (Fig.\u00a0 10B). As a member of the lactate dehydrogenase family, LDHD is distributed in the mitochondria of A549 cells (Fig.\u00a0 10C). After the differential expression of LDHD, the effect on migration and invasion were detected in LUAD cells. Upregulation of LDHD could inhibit the migration and invasion in A549 and H1975 cells (Fig.\u00a0 10D-G). While in the LDHD silencing group, the ability of H1299 and H838 to invade and migrate were significantly higher (Fig.\u00a011)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Lung cancer is a deadly disease globally, with LUAD accounting for nearly 40% [3]. In recent years, increasing awareness of the immune escape mechanism led to the revolutionization of the treatment landscape of lung cancer through ICIs [33]. However only 20\u201340% of all patients will respond to ICI therapy and even fewer will have long-term disease remission [34]. This study proposed a simple but robust biomarker called LDHD, which was downregulated in LUAD patients, consistent with a suppression-expression in kidney tumors [17]. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to identify the prominent decrease, biological function, and immune landscape of LDHD in LUAD patients.\nFunctional analyses showed that DEGs and LDHDrelated genes were mainly enriched in the G2/M cell cycle and pyruvate metabolism. Zhang et.al showed that the inhibition of LDHA suppresses tumor growth by promoting the arrest of the G2/M cell cycle and apoptosis via the JNK signal [35]. Tumor cells prefer gaining ATP from aerobic glycolysis (an important feature of metabolic reprogramming), during which pyruvate is reduced to lactate in an LDH-driven reaction [36]. Increasing aerobic glycolysis provided more energy for the tumor cells, thereby immensely contributing to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance [37]. Therefore, the assumption that LDHD might participate in tumor growth, migration, and invasion was brought forward in this study. Interestingly, the experiments carried out latter validated our notion by showing that the elevation of LDHD could suppress migration and invasion of A549 and H1975 cells.\nLactate was regarded as a bridge between metabolic reprogramming and immune escape, yet it was previously considered a waste byproduct during aerobic glycolysis [38]. Increasing evidence show that lactate can acidify the tumor microenvironment (TME) and then exert immunosuppressive actions and promote tumor invasion, which is associated with immune escape [39]. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells are typical cells in TME. It is worth noting that different subsets of immune cells play various roles that contribute to anti-tumor effects. They can even skew into opposite phenotypes in response to stimulation by lactate [40]. Tumor-associated\nmacrophages can sense the presence of lactate, and then stimulate M2 polarization, thereby causing immunosuppression and proliferation of tumor cells [41]. Tregs play an important role in immune suppression and maintenance of an immune balance. Lactate can serve as fuel for Tregs so as to promote growth and suppressive function [42]. As an isoform of LDH, LDHD catalyzes the reversible conversion of pyruvate to lactate, in addition to helping in the elimination of methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic byproduct in glycolysis [16]. In line with these findings, prediction was made that LDHD might exert a synergistic effect on tumor escape through lactate.\nThis study further clarified the relationship between LDHD and prognosis, where suppressed LDHD expression was associated with worse prognosis. Furthermore, LDHD expression was represented as an independent protective factor by the univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Truth be told, a single factor can\u2019t provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the tumor prognosis, which is why a nomogram that contained LDHD expression and some important clinical information was employed. The ROC and calibration curves showed good efficacy of the prognostic model that was built [43]. Therefore, there was convincing evidence that LDHD was a negative independent predictor of prognosis.\nAs we mentioned earlier, immune cells with tumor microenvironment play diverse roles in immune surveillance. Here, ssGSEA revealed that the LDHD lowexpression group had higher enrichment of Th2 cells and Tregs, which exhibit tumor-promoting activities. Cytokines like IL-4 and IL-13, produced by Th2 cells, can polarize macrophages into M2 cells, which hamper anti-tumor immune response [44]. In tumor cells, the anti-tumor efficacy of effector T-cells can be retarded by Tregs as the upregulation of co-inhibitory receptors, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3). These receptors can cause T-cells to become exhausted [40]. Previous reports found that NSCLC patients who have higher levels of Treg or Th2 cells had a worse prognosis, and this possibly explains the poor prognosis in the\n(See figure on next page.)

B Levels of LDHD in the indicated lung cancer cell lines and normal cell were measured by a western blot assay. LDHD mRNA expressions in listed lung cancer cells and normal cell were shown, and results were quantified. C Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect location of LDHD in A549 cells. D RT-qPCR and western blot showed the over-expression of LDHD in A549 and H1975. E\u2013F Transwell assays showed that LDHD overexpression inhibited lung cancer cells mobility and metastasis. G Wound healing assay was performed to show the effect of LDHD overexpression on migration of H1975 and A549 cells. A strach wound was made on cell surface and cells were photographed at 0 h, 12 h.

Clinical guidelines introduced immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatment as the first-line therapy for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), without oncogenic driver alterations [2]. The TIDE score and IPS were evaluated to investigate whether LDHD can partly guide the medicine plan for ICIs therapy [47]. Based on the results from this study, a conclusion was made that the LDHD high group might benefit from ICIs therapy more, especially in CTLA4 + treatment, although the opposite group had higher expression of immune checkpoints. Apart from PD-1 or CTLA4 signaling, other inhibitory signals also promote immune tolerance [30]. So, when one immune checkpoint was blockaded, other negative factors were still existed, playing anti-tumor effect. This may explain the poor efficacy of a single ICI treatment in LDHD low group. LDHD was mainly located in inner membrane of mitochondria [16]. We also detected its location in A549 cells through immunofluorescence assays, and this was consistent with the previous report. In view of the abovementioned potential functions, it was proposed that LDHD might influence tumor progress by regulating mitochondrial metabolism, which then promotes migration and invasion. Although our study improved the current understanding of LDHD in LUAD, there are still some limitations to take note of. First, the data that was obtained from TCGA and GEO were limited and mainly focused from Western countries, so it may poorly represent Asian\ncountries. Second, the validation of the nomogram was not conducted by an external database. Finally, specific investigation of the underlying mechanism of LDHD was not undertaken. Therefore, further study should be taken to explore the particular action mechanism of LDHD in LUAD."
