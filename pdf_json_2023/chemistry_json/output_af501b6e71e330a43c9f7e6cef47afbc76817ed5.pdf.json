    "abstractText": "Renewable electricity-powered CO evolution from CO2 emissions is a promising first step in the sustainable production of commodity chemicals, but performing electrochemical CO2 reduction economically at scale is challenging since only noble metals, for example, gold and silver, have shown high performance for CO2-to-CO. Cu is a potential catalyst to achieveCO2 reduction to CO at the industrial scale, but the C-C coupling process on Cu significantly depletes CO* intermediates, thus limiting theCOevolution rate and producing many hydrocarbon andoxygenatemixtures. Herein, we tune theCOselectivity of Cu by alloying a second metal Sb into Cu, and report an antimony-copper single-atom alloy catalyst (Sb1Cu) of isolated Sb-Cu interfaces that catalyzes the efficient conversion of CO2-to-CO with a Faradaic efficiency over 95%. The partial current density reaches 452mA cm with approximately 91% CO Faradaic efficiency, and negligible C2+ products are observed. In situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical simulations reason that the atomic SbCu interface in Cu promotes CO2 adsorption/activation and weakens the binding strength of CO*, which ends up with enhanced CO selectivity and production rates.",

Cu is a potential catalyst to achieveCO2 reduction to CO at the industrial scale, but the C-C coupling process on Cu significantly depletes CO* intermediates, thus limiting theCOevolution rate and producing many hydrocarbon andoxygenatemixtures. Herein, we tune theCOselectivity of Cu by alloying a second metal Sb into Cu, and report an antimony-copper single-atom alloy catalyst (Sb1Cu) of isolated Sb-Cu interfaces that catalyzes the efficient conversion of CO2-to-CO with a Faradaic efficiency over 95%. The partial current density reaches 452mA cm\u22122 with approximately 91% CO Faradaic efficiency, and negligible C2+ products are observed. In situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical simulations reason that the atomic SbCu interface in Cu promotes CO2 adsorption/activation and weakens the binding strength of CO*, which ends up with enhanced CO selectivity and production rates.\nThe massive emission of CO2 caused by fossil fuel combustion has led to a dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, which has triggered global concerns about climate change1\u20134. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a sustainable approach to directly convert CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels under ambient conditions, which reduces CO2 emissions and alleviates the dependence on fossil fuels5\u20139. Among the products obtained from CO2RR, CO is one of themost important feedstocks that canbeused in the sustainable production of commodity chemicals10\u201312. To perform this reaction economically at scale, a catalyst capable of mediating the efficient formation of COwith high selectivity at high current densities is a prerequisite. Currently, gold and silver are themost active catalysts for this process, with near-unity CO selectivity under low to modest production rates. To maintain high CO selectivity, the partial current\nReceived: 16 September 2022\nAccepted: 10 January 2023\nCheck for updates\n1School of Materials and Energy, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, PR China. 2Hefei National Research Center for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, Key Laboratory of Strongly Coupled Quantum Matter Physics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Surface and Interface Chemistry and Energy Catalysis of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Department of Chemical Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, PR China. 3State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian National Laboratory for Clean Energy, Dalian 116023, PR China. 4Yangtze Delta Region Institute (Huzhou), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Huzhou, Zhejiang 313001, PR China. 5Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, PR China. 6School of Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 610054, PR China. 7These authors contributed equally: Jiawei Li, Hongliang Zeng, Xue Dong.\ne-mail: xiao@dicp.ac.cn; zengj@ustc.edu.cn; chuan.xia@uestc.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:340 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\ndensities of CO (jCO) of these noble metals are typically lower than 200mAcm\u22122 13\u201315. Further increasing the bias will simultaneously promote the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and thus suppress the CO Faradaic efficiency (FE). Other more abundant, less expensive metals generally have poor selectivity for CO2-to-CO\n16,17. Very recently, earth-abundant molecular electrocatalysts18,19 and single-atom catalysts20\u201322 have been demonstrated to exhibit an FE of CO formation comparable with those of noble metal catalysts. However, most of these catalysts, in which the catalytic metal sites are isolated and well-defined, have also failed to drive CO2-to-CO at a commercially relevant scale (at least jCO > 200mAcm\u22122) due to the partial reduction of the ligands around the atomically dispersed metal sites under a high applied potential23\u201326.\nCu possesses excellent activity towards CO2 activation, but the control over the selectivity of CO2RR on Cu is a major challenge given that it can produce at least sixteen different hydrocarbons/ oxygenates27\u201330. Generally, during the CO2RR, CO2 molecules first undergo adsorption and activation on surface atoms. Further protoncoupled electron transfer converts CO2* into COOH* (further evolves to CO*) or HCOO*, the key intermediates forming CO and HCOOH, respectively31,32. OnCu catalysts, proper binding energy toCO* endows Cu with the ability to couple CO* to generate other C2+ products (e.g.,"

This situation prompted us to consider whether substantially and acutely tuning the local electronic/ geometric configuration of Cu could inhibit C-C coupling without reducing intrinsic activity, thus achieving commercially relevant CO2 electrolysis to CO. We reasoned that weakening the binding strength of H* and CO* intermediates, and thus decreasing the CO* coverage, could potentially suppressHER andCO* dimerizationwhile promoting CO generation during the CO2RR, so as to be the solution of the CO activity-selectivity dilemma on Cu. Herein, we report an antimonycopper single-atom alloy (Sb1Cu) catalyst (Fig. 1a) with isolated Sb-Cu interfaces that catalyzed the efficient conversion of CO2-to-CO with an FE of ca. 91% at 500mAcm\u22122."

The chemical states of CuI and SbIII in the Cu-Sb sample were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Figs. 3\u20135) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) (Supplementary Figs. 6, 7), reconfirming the spontaneous oxidation of the samples. High-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) clearly identified isolated bright spots representative of atomically dispersed Sb atoms in the Cumatrix for Sb1Cu (Fig. 1b), suggesting the successful formation of isolated Sb-Cu interfaces. Scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) mapping (Fig. 1c) affirmed the even distribution of Sb in Cu without observable Sb aggregation. The concentration of Sb in Sb1Cu was ca. 5.0 at% (denoted as Sb1Cu-5), as determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The above analyses implied the formation of a Sb1Cu-5 single-atom alloy with well-defined isolated Sb-Cu atomic sites.\nTo obtain atomic coordination information of Sb in Sb1Cu-5 samples, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements of the Sb K-edge were carried out. As displayed in Fig. 1d, the peak at ~1.50\u00c5 was attributed to the Sb-O bond in the as-synthesized Sb1Cu-5 catalyst. No Sb-Sb bond was observed, indicating the isolated form of Sb atoms. The peak at approximately 2.10 \u00c5 was attributed to the Sb-Cu bond, which proved the successful formation of Sb-Cu atomic interfaces.Wavelet transformanalysis further corroborated the EXAFS fitting results (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). The Cu Kedge EXAFS results illustrated the coexistence of Cu-Cu bonds (~2.50 \u00c5) and Cu-O bonds (~1.75 \u00c5), indicating the formation of oxides on the surface of the Sb1Cu-5 catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 8), in agreement with the XRD and XPS measurements32. We also prepared Cu, Sb1Cu-1.5, and Sb1Cu-10 as controls using a similar strategy (see Methods). Notably, the Sb1Cu-1.5 catalyst presented the same Sb-Cu atomic interface but a lower site concentration than Sb1Cu-5 (Supplementary Figs. 2\u201312), while the Sb1Cu-10 catalyst showed Sb aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 13). In an effort to elucidate the electronic structure of the Sb1Cu-5 catalyst under reaction conditions, we conducted an in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study. Cu Kedge in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) demonstrated that CuI in the as-prepared Sb1Cu-5 was reduced to metallic Cu during the CO2RR (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 14). Unfortunately, we failed to detect Sb signals in situ, probably due to the strong background interference caused by the fluorescence of Cu and the aqueous environment. Thus, we further explored the atomic geometry of Sb1Cu-5 after CO2 electrolysis. As expected, we still observed highly monodispersed Sb atoms in the Cu host (Supplementary Figs. 15, 16) by HAADF-STEM, in agreement with XRD analysis for post-catalysis Sb1Cu-5 (Supplementary Fig. 17). Moreover, ex situ Sb K-edge EXAFS exhibited unchanged isolated Sb-Cu atomic interfaces, suggesting that these atomic sites should be robust during electrolysis (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 18, and Table 1). The above results, taken together, suggest that the active phase of Sb1Cu-5 during the CO2RR is metallic Cu alloyed with isolated Sb atoms.\nThe CO2RR performance of Sb1Cu-5 was evaluated in a threeelectrode flow cell using 0.5M KHCO3 as the electrolyte (see details in Methods). Gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and the liquid products were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and anion chromatography (AC). As manifested by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of Sb1Cu-5, the current density was much higher under CO2 flow than that in Ar atmosphere, indicating the participation of CO2 in electrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 19). NMR results showed that the solution-phase product only contained formate (Supplementary Fig. 20), and the GC analysis revealed CO and H2 as major gas-phase products (Supplementary Fig. 21). We further found that the Sb1Cu-5 catalyst exhibited high selectivity towards CO even at very high current densities. The\nmaximal FECO reached 95% at \u2212150mA cm \u22122, while FECO remained over 90% even at \u2212500mA cm\u22122 (Fig. 2a). The selectivity towards HER was suppressed to below 3%, while over 90% FECO was achieved at all applied current densities. The CO partial current density (jCO) reached a maximum of \u2212452mA cm\u22122 at \u22121.16 V vs. RHE with 90.4% FECO. In addition, we observed that the Sb1Cu-5 catalyst showed a lower onset potential for CO2-to-CO and much suppressed C-C coupling (>150mV onset potential for C2H4) compared to pure Cu using in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) (Fig. 2b)36. This leads us to believe that the intrinsic activity and selectivity of Cu was significantly modulated by the introduction of isolated Sb-Cu atomic interfaces. The stability test showed that FECO remained at approximately 95% after 11 h of continuous electrolysis at \u2212100mA cm\u22122 using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), and the cell voltage was quite stable without obvious fluctuation (Fig. 2c). In order to exclude the influence of structural decay of gas diffusion electrode during long-term electrolysis, we further evaluated the intrinsic stability of Sb1Cu-5 catalyst in an H-cell, exhibiting a stable cathode potential with ca. 90% FECO for 100 h (Supplementary\nFig. 22). The impressive performance for CO2-to-CO on Sb1Cu-5 outperforms the previously reported state-of-the-art CO-selective electrocatalysts37\u201339 (Fig. 2d, e, Supplementary Fig. 23, and Tables 2\u20134).\nWe next analyzed the possible mechanism for exclusive CO production on the Sb1Cu catalyst. We first compared the CO2RR performance of pure Cu, Sb, Sb1Cu-1.5, and Sb1Cu-10 catalysts. Various products were obtained in the Cu catalyst, as expected, which showed an increasing C2+/C1 ratio with increasing current density (Fig. 2f). It is worth noting that, compared with Sb1Cu-5 catalyst, Cu exhibited higher selectivity towards C2+ products due to the preferable C-C coupling at higher current densities (e.g., 42% at \u2212400mAcm\u22122). The performance of pure Sb is given in Fig. 2g, showing amaximumFECO of 34.8%. For the Sb1Cu-1.5 catalyst (Fig. 2h), owing to the formation of isolated Sb-Cu atomic interfaces, FECO reached 89% at \u2212100mA cm\n\u22122. However, larger amounts of C2+ products also appeared at high current densities (up to 27% at \u2212400mAcm\u22122) because only a smaller portion of the pristine Cu surface wasmodulated by Sb atoms and the coordination environments of most Cu sites remained the same. Owing to the formation of Sb aggregates, a relatively higher selectivity of formate was found on the Sb1Cu-10 catalyst (Supplementary\nFig. 24). These comparisons directly link the exclusive CO selectivity to the impact from alloyed Sb single atoms in the Sb1Cu catalyst.\nWe then sought to carry out kinetic analysis to further understand how the isolated Sb-Cu atomic interface steers the CO2-to-CO pathway on Sb1Cu-5. Tafel plots (Supplementary Fig. 25) revealed a faster kinetic process of CO generation on the Sb1Cu-5 catalyst (177mVdec\u22121) comparedwith pure Cu (253mVdec\u22121). The Tafel slope of 177mVdec\u22121 on Sb1Cu-5 indicated that the first electron transfer step of *CO2 was the rate-determining step (RDS)\n31. The slopes were larger than the frequently mentioned Tafel slope of 118mVdec\u22121 for CO2 activation RDS (Supplementary Table 5), which could be attributed to the differences in the numerical selection for the symmetry factor (\u03b1 = 0.5 for 118mVdec\u22121) regardingmore complicated electron transfer and chemical processes under realistic conditions40. Thus, we employed Fourier-transform alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) to gain further mechanistic insights into electron transfer processes during the CO2RR on Sb1Cu-5\n41. In FTacV, a large amplitude periodic alternating current (ac) waveform was superimposed onto the direct current (dc) ramp to generate higher harmonic components. The high harmonic ac components were highly sensitive to electron transfer kinetics and devoid of nonfaradaic background current contributions42, thereby leading to direct access to underlying electron transfer processes. The fourth harmonic components of FTacV obtained on Sb1Cu-5 in CO2-saturated 0.5M KHCO3 showed a well-defined reduction peak at approximately \u22120.60V vs. RHE,\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:340 3\nFig. 2 | CO2RR performance over Sb1Cu catalysts and Cu. a FEs of all CO2RR products at different current densities and the corresponding j-V curve of Sb1Cu-5. b In situ DEMSmeasurement of (up) CO and (down) C2H4 production during CO2RR on Cu and Sb1Cu-5 catalysts. c Stability test at \u2212100mA cm\u22122 current density in MEA for over 10 h, indicating an average CO FE of\napproximately 95%, as estimated by GC analysis.

Simulations of FTacV (see details inMethods) showed that the standard rate constant (ks) of the one-electron CO2-to-*CO2\n\u2212 the process was smaller than that for the one-electron *COOH-to-*COOH\u2212 (Supplementary Table 6), indicating the first electron-transfer step as the RDS. In addition, based on the fitting transfer coefficient (\u03b1 = 0.34) for CO2-to-*CO2\n\u2212, we estimated the Tafel slope to be 174mVdec\u22121 on Sb1Cu-5, which is close to the experimental value of 177mVdec\u22121 and thus, in turn, verifies our simulations. Taken together, the Tafel and FTacV analyses indicated an improved electron transfer process of CO production on Sb1Cu-5, highlighting the critical role of isolated Sb atoms in boosting CO2-toCO conversion.\nIn pursuit of a molecular-level understanding of the CO2-to-CO conversion pathway, we first conducted in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATRSEIRAS) to dynamically monitor the evolution of reactive intermediates. Figures 3b and 3c show the in situ ATR-SEIRAS spectra acquired for the Cu and Sb1Cu-5 electrodes during a negative-going potential sweep from \u22120.2 to \u22120.8 V vs. RHE. Upon applying the cathodic potential, a fingerprint infrared band appeared at 2000\u20132100 cm\u22121 for both Sb1Cu-5 and Cu catalysts, which was assigned to surface-bond CO (CO*). For either electrode, the CO* band frequencies redshifted with a negatively going potential due to the Stark effect. Notably, the CO* bands are redshifted and broadened on Sb1Cu-5, in comparison to the counterparts on Cu at given potentials. As the surface coverage could impact the frequency of vibrational bands via dynamical dipole coupling43, the lower frequency of the CO* peak on Sb1Cu-5 implied weakened CO* adsorption and much lower CO coverage relative to Cu (Fig. 3d). After increasing the bias to \u22120.8 V vs. RHE, the CO* peak vanished on Sb1Cu-5 but was still present on Cu, indicatingmore facile desorption of the CO intermediate from the Sb1Cu-5 surface to formgaseous CO. In addition, after suspension of the applied potential and sweeping adsorbates with Ar flow, Sb1Cu-5 showed a faster attenuation rate and shorter retention time of CO* compared with pure Cu, further confirming its better CO desorption ability (Supplementary Fig. 26). The same conclusions were also drawn from the in situ Raman spectra, where the peaks at 2000\u20132100 cm\u22121 were ascribed to CO* intermediates44 (Fig. 3e). As shown in Fig. 3f, the peak at 1060 cm\u22121, which is associated with \u03bd(CO3\n2\u2212) vibration45, was much weaker on Sb1Cu-5 than that on Cu at a given potential, inferring a surface environment of a lower pH value46. It has been demonstrated that a higher surface pH is conducive to promoting C-C coupling47. Thus, endowed with the capabilities of weak adsorption for CO* and facile desorption for CO, Sb1Cu-5 predominantly prefers CO evolution to CO* dimerization in the case of lower surface pH.\nDensity function theoretical (DFT) calculations were performed to further understand the enhanced FECO on Sb1Cu-5. As discussed previously48, a step surface ismore active for theCO2RR. Thus, theCu (211) surface model was first constructed (Supplementary Fig. 27). A single Sb dopant was substitutionally created to simulate a Sb1Cu-5 (211) surface. It was found that the electrochemical interface is close to a capacitor (Supplementary Fig. 28) regarding the correlations between the amount of electron transfer from the electrode to the water layer (\u0394q) and the relative work function change of the systems (\u0394\u03a6) at initial, transition, and final states49. Therefore, the activation barriers at varying potentials were explicitly calculated within a capacitor model with the \u201ccharge-extrapolation\u201d scheme50\u201352. Figure 4a shows that CO2 can be electroreduced to CO and HCOOH via COOH* orHCOO* pathway, respectively, at\u22121.0 V vs. RHE. The kinetic barrier of HCOOH formation is higher than that for COproduction on both Cu (211) and Sb1Cu-5 (211), which is consistent with the experiments that FEHCOOH is lower than FECO on both Cu and Sb1Cu-5. Figure 4b shows that all the adsorption energies of CO*, COOH*, and\nHCOO* on Sb1Cu-5 (211) are lower than those on Cu (211). The CO* desorption is easier on Sb1Cu-5 (211) compared to Cu (211), which can enhance CO production and selectivity. To further understand the effect of isolated Sb in Cu, the projected density of states (PDOS) was calculated for Cu (211) and Sb1Cu-5 (211) (Fig. 4c). The d-band center of the Cu atom is lower after Sb doping (from \u22122.07 to \u22122.17 eV), which explains well the weaker adsorption energy on Sb1Cu-5 (211) than that for Cu (211).\nAs C2+ products also have a lower FE for theCO2RR on the Sb1Cu5 electrode, the barriers of CO*-CO* coupling were calculated. As shown in Fig. 4d, the kinetic barrier of CO* dimerization on Sb1Cu-5 (211) is higher than that on Cu (211), thus resulting in slower production of C2+ products, and this is another reason for the high FECO on Sb1Cu-5. Microkinetic modeling further validated the enhanced FECO on Sb1Cu-5 (211), and the results are shown in Fig. 4e. The calculated FECO was comparable to the experimental results for both pristine Cu and Sb1Cu-5. It was found that CO* takes up 70% coverage of the total sites for theCO2RR on pristine Cu, whereas that on Sb1Cu5 (211) is only 7% (Supplementary Fig. 29). Finally, we further calculated the activity of CO production on Sb1Cu-5 (211) at varying potentials (Fig. 4f). As the potential decreases, all the barriers of electrochemical protonation gradually decrease, which will increase the reaction rate. A good linear correlation (slope = 1.05) was obtained between the experimental jCO and the theoretical rate of CO production, as shown in Fig. 4g. This indicates that the reaction mechanism and energetic trend above should be reliable.\nTo sum up, in this work, Sb1Cu catalysts were successfully synthesized using a co-reduction method, with isolated Sb-Cu atomic interfaces verified by HAADF-STEM and EXAFS. Sb1Cu-5 achieved an FECO of 95% at a current density of \u2212150mA cm\n\u22122 andmaintained >90% FECO at \u2212500mAcm\n\u22122. Distinct from Cu with major C2+ products at high current density, high activity and selectivity towards CO production on Sb1Cu-5 was elaborated by tuning the Cu electronic structure via forming an isolated Sb-Cu atomic interface, and the improved performance can be explained by the enhanced ability of CO2 activation andCOdesorption for Cu. This report provides a facile strategy to manipulate the reaction pathway through isolated heteroatom interfaces, which could be widely used in general element combinations and other electrocatalytic reactions."

We chose the projected augmented wave (PAW)56,57 and a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV.Geometry optimizationswereperformedwith a forceconvergence smaller than0.05 eV\u00c5\u22121. Cu (211) and Sb1Cu-5 (211) surface models were built with four layers comprising 48 atoms. The two layers at the bottom were fixed, while the other atoms relaxed. Monkhorst-Pack k-points of (4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) were applied for all the calculations onCu (211) and Sb1Cu-5 (211). TheCu site nearest to the Sb atom has been discussed in the main text. The Cu sites far from the Sb atom should be very similar to pure Cu. We further studied the reaction activity of the Cu site, which is the next-nearest to the Sb atom on Sb1Cu-5 (211), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 30. CO is also the main product due to the lower barrier compared to HCOOH and C2+ formation. However, the adsorption energy of CO* at the top site on Cu (next-nearest to Sb atom, \u22120.21 eV) was close to pure Cu (\u22120.20 eV), more stable than CO* at the top site of Cu (nearest to Sb atom, \u22120.11 eV). CO* accounts for 77% of the total sites for CO2RR. This is inconsistent with the results of spectroscopic measurements, where the lower frequencyof the CO* peakon Sb1Cu-5 impliedweakenedCO* adsorption and much lower *CO coverage relative to Cu (Fig. 3d). Hence, the Cu sites (next-nearest to Sb atom) on Sb1Cu-5 should not be the main active sites, as listed in the supplementary information. The Cu sites (nearest to the Sb atom)on Sb1Cu-5 should havemajor activity contributions, as shown in the main text.\nAll the adsorption energies were referenced to the gas phase energies of CO, H2O, and H2.

The reaction rate of CO2RR to C2+ products was estimated based on the Arrhenius equation and the CO* coverage at a steady state.\nThe FE was described by\nFE=%= n\u00f0i\u00deTOF\u00f0i\u00deP n i\u00f0 \u00deTOF\u00f0i\u00de\u00d7 100 \u00f05\u00de\nwhere n(i) represents the electron transfer number and TOF(i) is the turnover frequency obtained bymicrokinetic simulation for product i.\nWe have also strictly investigated the potential effects on the adsorption energy of CO*. An electric field was applied in DFT calculations. Based on a parallel-plate capacitor model, a linear correlation between the electric field and absolute potential was approximated as following:66\nE = \u03c3 \u03b5\u03b50 = CH\u00f0USHE UPZC\u00de \u03b5\u03b50 \u00f06\u00de\nwhere \u03c3 is the surface charge density and \u03b5 and \u03b50 are the dielectric constants of vacuum and water near the interface, which were set to 8.85 \u00d7 10\u221212 Fm\u22121 and 2 (unitless), respectively. CH refers to the Helmholtz capacitance (\u03bcF cm\u22122), which was set to 25\u03bcF cm\u22122. USHE is the electrode potential referenced to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). UPZC refers to the potential of zero charge (PZC) versus SHE, which was set to be \u22120.9 V67.\nThe SHE could be converted to the RHE by the following formula:\nURHE =USHE +0:059pH \u00f07\u00de\nThe calculated adsorption energies of CO* changed very little (<0.05 eV)with potentials between 0 and \u22121.2 V vs. RHE, which showed consistent trends for Cu (211) and Sb1Cu-5 (211). All insights and conclusions shown in themain text are still reliable. In addition, by varying potentials from \u22120.2 to \u22120.7 V vs. RHE, the calculated adsorption energies of CO* weaken from \u22120.13 to \u22120.11 eV on Sb1Cu-5 (211) and from \u22120.23 to \u22120.20 eV on Cu (211), which showed consistent trends with the results of the in situ ATR-SEIRAS spectra (Fig. 3b\u2013d).\nAdditional microkinetic modeling was performed to doublecheck the reliability of the present kinetic analysis. All conclusions are not affected. Overall, the potential effects on the adsorption energy of CO* were ignored in the calculation of free energy change."
