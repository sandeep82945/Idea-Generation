    "abstractText": "Polyaniline (PANI) was synthesized from liquid aniline, a nitrogen-containing aromatic compound, through the atmospheric pressure (AP) plasma process using a newly designed plasma jet array with wide spacing between plasma jets. To expand the area of the polymerized film, the newly proposed plasma jet array comprises three AP plasma jet devices spaced 7 mm apart in a triangular configuration and an electrodeless quartz tube capable of applying auxiliary gas in the center of the triangular plasma jets. The vaporized aniline monomer was synthesized into a PANI film using the proposed plasma array device. The effects of nitrogen gas addition on the morphological, chemical, and electrical properties of PANI films in AP argon plasma polymerization were examined. The iodine-doped PANI film was isolated from the atmosphere through encapsulation. The constant electrical resistance of the PANI film indicates that the conductive PANI film can achieve the desired resistance by controlling the atmospheric exposure time through encapsulation.",

            "text": "Polyaniline (PANI), a representative conductive polymer, is a nitrogen-containing aromatic compound [1,2]. It exhibits excellent conductivity, easy manufacturability, low cost, good biocompatibility, and environmental stability and is used in various applications, such as organic electronics, anticorrosion materials, electrorheological materials, and nanobiomedicines [2\u20136]. Conventional PANI synthesis mainly involves three processes: chain growth through aniline oxidation, dimerization, and oligomerization/polymerization [6]. It requires an acidic environment and oxidants, and the resulting \u03c0-conjugated polymer has low solubility despite the wet process [6\u20138]. Although monomers with various substituent groups can be employed to improve solubility, they reduce conductivity [9]. Plasma polymerization is a synthetic method that can overcome the limitations of the existing polymerization processes. The plasma used for polymerization has a low ion temperature and a high electron temperature; this type of plasma is called non-thermodynamicequilibrium plasma or nonthermal plasma [10,11]. Given that its nonthermal property\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1626. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15071626 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1626 2 of 15\ninduces high chemical activity without thermal damage, plasma polymerization is particularly advantageous for synthesizing temperature-sensitive organic polymers [11,12]. Recently, many studies have attempted to use atmosphere-generated nonthermal plasma that does not require vacuum equipment for material processing, including polymerization [13\u201315]. Atmospheric pressure (AP) plasma polymerization is attracting considerable attention as an extremely simple and eco-friendly method because AP plasma can replace chemicals or extreme synthetic environments, such as high temperatures, for the oxidation/reduction of monomers [16,17]. In particular, recent studies have demonstrated that AP plasma polymerization can produce polymer films using only electricity and monomers without the application of additional chemicals and heat [13\u201316]. In AP plasma polymerization, vaporized monomers are transferred into the plasma region, activated in the plasma medium, and crosslinked while leaving the plasma region [17,18]. Many studies have reported on the effect of applied power on multiple materials synthesized via AP plasma polymerization [19\u201322]. An important consideration for polymerization using AP plasma is the activation of monomers without breaking the chemical structure during the interaction between monomer molecules and plasma. When high applied power is used to generate a sufficient discharge in AP, the chemical structure of the monomer is weakened and an incomplete structure is synthesized because of excessive plasma energy [21\u201323]. The resulting degradation of the electrical and optical properties of the conjugated polymer eventually becomes a limitation for the functionality of the conjugated polymer as an electrode, light-emitting, and gas-sensing material in electronic applications [24,25]. AP plasma polymerization allows the precise control of the process and the resulting polymer by changing experimental parameters such as the working gas composition, plasma reactor configuration, discharge initiation/maintenance, and power source type [26\u201329]. In particular, the nonthermal plasma state during polymerization can be stabilized by controlling the amount of vaporized monomer molecules, the type and flow rate of additional neutral gas, and applied power. By applying additional gas to the AP plasma reactor, the plasma intensity and reactivity can be adjusted, and certain radicals, which can be expected to improve polymer properties, are also supplied. In this study, PANI was synthesized from liquid aniline, a nitrogen-containing aromatic compound, through the AP plasma process using a newly designed plasma jet array with wide spacing between plasma jets. During PANI synthesis, an auxiliary neutral gas, such as Ar, N2, or O2, was introduced in the plasma region to control plasma intensity and generate additional radicals. The effect of the addition of N2, which improves the quality of the nanostructured PANI film, was examined in detail. The influences of N2 gas addition on the synthesis process were investigated, and the morphological, chemical, and electrical properties of the synthesized PANI were then examined."

            "text": "Figure 2 shows the optical images of the glow discharge with the addition of auxiliary gas through the central tube of the APPJ and the resulting PANI films deposited on Si substrates. For AP plasma polymerization, Ar gas containing aniline vapor was added via the three triangular outer tubes to generate the discharge, and a nominal amount of gas was then applied to the central tube. Because each plasma jet in the triangular plasma jet array was separated from the others by a distance of 7 mm, the PANI film could be uniformly deposited on a Si substrate with dimensions of 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm without technical difficulties, as shown in Figure 2a. In this study, unlike our previous study [15], the influence of the auxiliary gas during plasma polymerization could be examined without changing the design of the guide tube or substrate stand, because an additional tube can be placed at the center of the triangular plasma jet array. Ar gas containing aniline was introduced into the plasma reactor at a flow rate of 2700 sccm, whereas the added neutral gas had a relatively low flow rate of 100 sccm. The glow emission behavior of the AP plasma and the uniformity of the resulting PANI film were extremely dependent on the type of additive gas. When a small amount of Ar gas, which was the same as the main gas, was added, the discharge characteristics did not change considerably during plasma polymerization, and a cloudy glow emission attributed to the diffusion of aniline particles with various energy levels was observed (Figure 2a). When this cloudy glow emission was extensive and uniform inside the plasma reactor, a uniform polymer film could be obtained. As shown in Figure 2b,c, the addition of O2 or N2 during AP plasma polymerization attenuated the cloudy glow emission. The cloudy glow emissions decreased because the monomers lost energy due to collisions with neutral gases. Such collisions can be attributed to the addition of a small amount of gas different from the discharge gas to the middle of the reactor, wherein many activated monomers were located. In particular, when O2 was added, the cloudy glow decreased, and only plasma jets were observed. When N2 was added, the blurred glow emitted a blue color, indicating that some of the neutral nitrogen was transformed into excited species by the plasma energy. The plasma typically generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) when O2 and N2 were added during the plasma process, respectively.

Electrical and Optical Characteristics during AP Plasma Polymerization The driving voltage, discharge current, and optical intensity were monitored, as\nshown in Figure 3, to examine the discharge behaviors during plasma polymerization. The driving voltage maintained a constant sinusoidal waveform with a frequency of 28 kHz and was not distorted due to electrical discharge. No change in electrical behaviors due to gas addition could be observed because the addition of a small amount of neutral gas did not fundamentally affect the discharge initiation and maintenance in the plasma reactor. Figure 3a shows the electrical behaviors monitored when Ar was added at a flow rate of 100 sccm.

The PANI film deposited through the proposed AP plasma polymerization process had a porous morphology that comprised crosslinked PANI nanofibers, as shown in Figure 5a,b. Normal PANI has a coarse granular form in which nanoparticles of various sizes are synthesized and aggregated [33,34]. PANI treated with heat or additives possesses a regular and ordered structure in which nanorods and nanofibers are crosslinked [33\u201335]. During AP plasma polymerization, certain aniline-derived radicals created by plasma energy served as effective additives to promote crosslinking. The crosslinking effects on the nanostructured PANI films appear as an increase in the total pore volume and a decrease in each pore size [33].

The chang in th resistance value of PANI fil is expected to be permanently avoided if encapsu ation t chnology that is more advanc d than the use of polyimide tape a d sealing film can be employed."

            "text": "In this study, changes in the morphological, chemical, and electrical properties of nanostructured PANI films with the addition of neutral gas for AP plasma polymerization were investigated. A separate gas tube was added to the center of the APPJ array device, and an auxiliary gas could be injected into the middle of the generated plasma. Adding a small amount of N2 for AP plasma polymerization not only improved the density and uniformity of the resulting nanostructured PANI film but also increased the growth rate of the PANI film. The latter effect is beneficial for rapid polymerization. Moreover, in contrast to the addition of Ar, the addition of a small amount of N2 could improve the resistance stability of the conductive PANI film. This property can be exploited to obtain constant electrical conductivity by isolating the conductive polymer film from moisture and oxygen in the ambient air via encapsulation. Adding a small amount of N2 gas was experimentally demonstrated to be a facile approach for improving the properties of conjugated polymer films without considerably affecting the maintenance of AP plasma undergoing polymerization and deposition simultaneously. Further careful investigations are required\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1626 13 of 15\nto understand exactly how nitrogen molecules/radicals increase the deposition rate of PANI films or the density of PANI nanoparticles in the film. N2 addition during plasma polymerization can be a practical approach for easily controlling the surface roughness of conductive polymers, thereby improving the capture of gas molecules when conductive polymers are used as the detection layer of gas sensors.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.Y.K., H.J. and H.-S.T.; methodology, H.J., K.K., H.O.S., C.-S.P. and E.Y.J.; validation, J.Y.K., Y.R.L., C.-S.P. and E.Y.J.; formal analysis, J.Y.K., H.J., Y.R.L., H.O.S., B.J.S. and E.Y.J.; investigation, J.Y.K., H.J., K.K., H.O.S., C.-S.P., B.J.S. and H.-S.T.; resources, J.Y.K. and H.-S.T.; data curation, J.Y.K., H.J., K.K., H.O.S., E.Y.J. and H.-S.T.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, H.J., J.Y.K. and H.-S.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.Y.K., H.J., E.Y.J. and H.-S.T.; visualization, J.Y.K., H.J. and E.Y.J.; supervision, H.-S.T.; project administration, J.Y.K.; funding acquisition, J.Y.K. and H.-S.T.
