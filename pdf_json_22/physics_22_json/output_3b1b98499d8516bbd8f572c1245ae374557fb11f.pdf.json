    "abstractText": "Purpose Longitudinal polarization is an important design aspect of the future 100 km-scale Circular Electron Position Collider (CEPC). Spin rotators are needed in the CEPC collider rings to make the beam polarization along the longitudinal direction at the interaction points (IPs). This paper focuses on the design of spin rotators for CEPC at the Z-pole (45.6 GeV). Methods The design of spin rotators in the CEPC at the Z-pole is based on solenoid magnets and horizontal bending magnets sections. The coupling of transverse motion introduced by solenoids is compensated with quadrupole lenses. Adjustments have been made to the layout to implement the spin rotators into the collider rings. Results Longitudinal polarized beamcanbe achieved at the IPswith the spin rotators.High degree of polarization is attainable, while the effect of spin rotators on orbital motion is acceptable. The detailed simulation results will be presented. Conclusion A solenoid-based spin rotator configuration is designed and integrated into the CEPC collider ring lattice. According to the simulation results, the polarization requirements can be satisfied.",

            "text": "As a future lepton circular collider, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is proposed for testing the underlying fundamental physics principles of the Standard Model (SM) and exploring physics beyond the SM [1]. In the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) [2], the CEPC is designed as a 100-km double-ring collider with two interaction points (IPs). The operated beam energies are 120 GeV as a Higgs factory, 80 GeV as aW factory and 45.6 GeV for the Z-pole.\nParticle physics experiments with longitudinally polarized beams in the CEPC are an important design aspect for an accurate check of the Standard Model. High longitudi-\nB Zhe Duan duanz@ihep.ac.cn B Jie Gao gaoj@ihep.ac.cn B Yiwei Wang wangyw@ihep.ac.cn\n1 Key Laboratory of Particle Acceleration Physics and Technology, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19B Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China\n2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China\nnal beam polarization (>50%) is required in the interaction points of the CEPC without sacrificing luminosity. In this paper, we focus on the realization of longitudinal polarization at the Z-pole. The possibility at even higher energies will be addressed elsewhere.\nTo realize longitudinally polarized colliding beams, we need to address two major issues, polarized beam generation and proper spin rotations in the collider ring. A highly polarized electron beam (> 80%) can be generated by a polarized electron gun [3], accelerated to full collision energy by the Linac and the Booster. There could be polarization loss during the acceleration in the Booster. A preliminary design of Siberian snakes is under investigation to overcome the depolarization in the Booster [4]. It is an independent research topic and therefore it will be not covered here. Finally the polarized beams are injected into the collider rings. Technically speaking, polarized positron sources are costly or less matured to be applied to CEPC-Z at the moment [4\u20136]. And in the vast majority of cases, single-beam polarization is sufficient, since annihilation occurs when the particles are of opposite helicity, like in the measurement of polarized lepton asymmetries at SLC [7]. An electron with a certain helicity will find a partner for itself. Therefore, it is sufficient to have only one of the colliding beams longitudinally polarized, for example, an electron beam. But there may be technologi-\ncal innovations in the future, which can provide a positron beam with a high degree of polarization and meet the bunch intensity requirements. Then the scheme of electron beam polarization maintenance in the Booster also applies to the polarized positron beam. Hence, we design the longitudinal polarization scheme for both e\u2212 and e+ beams. In this paper, spin rotators are designed for e+/e\u2212 beams in the CEPC collider rings at the Z-pole, to realize the longitudinal polarized beams at the IPs in the collider rings.\nA spin rotator is a device which can rotate the particle spins from the vertical direction to the longitudinal direction or vice versa in storage rings. A pair of rotators around each IP are required to keep the polarization vertical in the arcs and to realize longitudinal polarization at the IPs. Spin rotators have been successfully employed at HERA for electron and positron beams [8]. The design of the HERA spin rotators is known as the \u2018mini rotator\u2019 [9] which consists of a sequence of alternating vertical and horizontal dipolemagnets. In addition, spin rotators based on helical dipole magnets have been adopted in RHIC to achieve longitudinal polarization at the IPs [10]. However, the beam orbit excursion may be large in those spin rotators with pure transverse magnetic fields. Hence the magnet bore must be large enough to accommodate the excursions. Besides, vertical bendingmagnetic fields in the spin rotators also introduce vertical dispersion and thus an increase in the vertical emittance. This can lead to a reduction of the equilibrium beam polarization andmight not be compatible with high-luminosity e+/e\u2212 circular collider designs which favor very flat beams. In addition, a combination of solenoids and horizontal bending magnets can also form a spin rotator, hereafter referred to as \u201csolenoid-based spin rotators.\u201d\nA spin rotator including a dedicated horizontal bending magnet section and a dedicated solenoid section, is an alternative design first studied for HERA [11], where the spin matching conditions were first derived for solenoid-based spin rotators. Later, a similar concept was also applied for eRHIC [12]. Koop also discussed this kind of spin rotators for the SuperB project [13,14] later. Nikitin first pointed out such a scheme could be modified and applied in the CEPC at the Z-pole energy [15,16], using the fact that the interaction region design features a S-shaped twisted orbit in the median plane, i.e., the spin rotators can be arranged in an \u201canti-symmetric\u201d manner, which would cancel most of the depolarization effects due to quantum fluctuation [11]. Recently, a solenoid-based spin rotator has been designed for the electron longitudinal polarization in the electron-ion collider (EIC) [17]. The spin rotator scheme uses two pairs of solenoid magnets interleaved with dipoles on each side of the interaction region. And the design of spin rotators allows to realize the exact longitudinal orientation of electron spins in the whole energy range from 5 to 18 GeV, via adjustment of solenoid strengths without changing the machine\ngeometry [18,19]. ForSuperKEKB, avery compact spin rotator design has been proposed that consists of solenoid-dipole combined function magnets [20].\nIn order to avoid those problems introduced by transverse magnetic fields, wewill present our study of a solenoid-based spin rotator configuration in this paper. Then its integration into the CEPC collider ring is investigated. In this study, we used the CEPCCDR lattice at the Z-pole. The SAD code [21] was used in the design of the spin rotator and evaluation of its influence to orbital motion. The Bmad/PTC code [22,23] was used to evaluate the performance of the spin motion and polarization. It has been verified that lattice translations between SAD and Bmad/PTC provide consistent results by Zhou et al [24].\nThe theories of spin dynamics are reviewed in \u201cTheory\u201d section. Section \u201cSolenoid-based spin rotators\u201d presents the designs of solenoid-based spin rotators. In \u201cInsertion scheme\u201d section, the insertion scheme of the spin rotators is studied, and the simulation results for spin motion and orbital motion are presented. Finally, potential optimization of the spin rotators insertion is analyzed qualitatively."

N\u2191 and N\u2193 are the number of electrons in the up state and down state, respectively.\nThe precession of the spin vector S of a charged particle with the velocity v and spin- 12 in an electromagnetic field is determined by the Thomas-BMT equation [25,26]:\ndS dt = \u00d7 S\n= \u2212 e m0\u03b3\n[ (1 + a\u03b3 )B\u22a5 + (1 + a)B\u2016\n+(a\u03b3 + \u03b3 1 + \u03b3 ) E \u00d7 \u03b2 c2\n] (2)\nwhere B = B\u2016 +B\u22a5 , B\u2016 = (\u03b2 \u00b7B)\u03b2/\u03b22. \u03b2 = v/c.m0 and e are the mass and charge of the particle, respectively. a is the anomalous magnetic moment, a = 0.00115965 for electron and positron. \u03b3 is the relativistic factor. c is the speed of light.\nWhen t is replaced by the azimuthal angle \u03b8 , one special solution of Eq.(2) is the invariant spin field [27,28], n(u; \u03b8),\nsatisfying the periodic condition n(u; \u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = n(u; \u03b8), u is the phase space coordinate in terms of canonical variables of the orbital motion. The rate of spin precession around n is described by the amplitude-dependent spin tune \u03bds [27,28]. On the closed orbit, n(u; \u03b8) and \u03bds reduces to n0(\u03b8) and \u03bd0, respectively. In a planar storage ring, n0(\u03b8) is close to the vertical direction. And \u03bd0 \u2248 a\u03b30 where \u03b30 is the relativistic factor for the design energy.\nThe spin motion may be perturbed in a resonant manner when the following condition is satisfied,\n\u03bds = k + kx\u03bdx + ky\u03bdy + kz\u03bdz, k, kx , ky, kz \u2208 Z (3)\nwhere \u03bdx , \u03bdy, \u03bdz are the horizontal, vertical betatron tunes and synchrotron tune, respectively. Spin resonances with \u03bds = k, k \u2208 Z are called the integer spin resonances. Spin resonanceswith |kx |+|ky |+|kz | = 1and |kx |+|ky |+|kz | > 1 are called the first-order spin resonances and the higher-order spin resonances, respectively. In particular, synchrotron sideband spin resonances \u03bd0 \u00b1 \u03bdu +m\u03bdz = k, with | m |> 1 and u = x, y, z are considered very important in high-energy electron storage rings [29].\nIn an electron storage ring, a spontaneous buildup of radiative polarization may occur via the emission of spin-flip synchrotron radiation. This process is called the SokolovTernov effect [30]. However, the stochastic photon emission also leads to the spin diffusion effect [31]. The equilibrium polarization [32] is a balance between the Sokolov-Ternov effect and the spin diffusion effect; its direction is along \u3008n\u3009\u03b8 , which is an average over phase space at the azimuthal angle \u03b8 . Generally speaking, \u3008n\u3009\u03b8 is very nearly aligned along n0(\u03b8). The degree of the equilibrium polarization can be approximated by\nPeq \u2248 P\u221e 1 + \u03c4p\n\u03c4d\n(4)\nwhere P\u221e equals to 92.4% in an ideal planar ring. And the equivalent polarization build-up time is\n1 \u03c4tot = 1 \u03c4p + 1 \u03c4d (5)\n\u03c4p and \u03c4d are the time constants for the Sokolov-Ternov effect and spin diffusion effect, respectively. For the CEPC collider ring at the Z-pole. \u03c4p \u2248 260 h. According to Eqs. (4) and (5), if the equilibrium polarization equals to 50%, we can get \u03c4d \u2248 310 h and the equivalent polarization build-up time \u03c4tot \u2248 141 h.\nFor the CEPC collider rings, the top-up injection mode will be used tomaximize the integrated luminosity [2]. Timeaveraged beampolarization in an electron storage ring during\nthe top-up injection is [33]\nPavg = Peq 1 + \u03c4tot/\u03c4b + Pinj 1 + \u03c4b/\u03c4tot (6)\nhere Pinj is the injected beam polarization; \u03c4b is the beam lifetime. For colliding beams at the Z-pole, the beam lifetime is about 2 h, mainly limited by the radiative Bhabha effect which is correlated to the luminosity. Hence, if the equilibrium polarization is larger than 10%, \u03c4tot is longer than 28 h, still significantly longer than the beam lifetime. In this case, if the polarization of the injected beam is very high (for example, more than 70%), then the time-averaged beam polarization is approximately the injected beam polarization. In other words, to maintain a high time-averaged beam polarization, it is essential to realize a high injected beam polarization, while it is only required to achieve amodest equilibrium beam polarization in the collider ring."

And the axis of the rotation is along the vertical direction.\nWe use one typical design of solenoid-based spin rotators that consists of a solenoid section and a horizontal bending dipole magnet section. In the spin rotator upstream of the IP (RotatorU), the solenoid section rotates the spin vector from the vertical direction to the radial direction with a rotation angle of \u03c0/2. Then the horizontal bending magnet section rotates the spin vector by an odd multiple of \u03c02 , i.e.,\n\u03d5 = (2K + 1)\u03c0 2 , K \u2208 Z (9)\nwhich can rotate the spin vector from the radial direction to the longitudinal direction at the IP. Rotation of a spin vector from the longitudinal direction at the IP to the vertical direction in the arc can be realized by a spin rotator downstream of the IP (RotatorD), with a similar setup of RotatorU, but in a reversed order. Such a pair of spin rotators can realize longitudinal beam polarization at IPs, while retaining vertical beam polarization in the arc regions.\nThere are two possibilities of arrangement of a pair of spin rotators around each IP [11], in termsofwhether the spin rotators on both sides of the IP have the same polarity (symmetric arrangement, Fig. 1b) or opposite polarities (anti-symmetric arrangement, Fig. 1a), as illustrated in Fig. 1. Compared with the symmetric arrangement, the anti-symmetric arrangement can exactly rotate the spin vector back to the vertical direction in the arc even when not running at the designed energy. In addition, the anti-symmetric structure also matches the geometry of the CEPC collider ring in the interaction region (IR). Therefore, the anti-symmetric arrangement is preferred when the spin rotators are placed near the interaction region.\nTo rotate the spin vector by \u03c0/2 at E = 45.6 GeV, the required integrated field strength of the solenoid magnets is about 240T \u00b7 m. For example, if we consider a superconducting solenoid magnetic field of 8 T, the total length of the solenoid magnetic field is about 30 m. This requires a series of solenoid magnets."

However, the compact design of the solenoid compensation unit requires high magnetic field gradient of the decoupling\nquadrupoles. Reducing the high gradient of quadrupoles would inevitably take up more space.\nIn this paper, we designed another type of solenoid compensation unit (SCU) for the CEPC following the concept proposed in Ref.

(9), the spin rotation around the vertical axis from IP to the solenoid module must be (2K + 1)\u03c02 ; K is an integer, to enable the longitudinal polarization at the IP. This requires adjustments to the layout of the collider ring between the solenoidmodule insertions.We studied different insertion schemes to implement the solenoidmodule insertions into the lattice. At the beginning of this investigation, two different insertion schemes were studied, either inserting the solenoid sections into a short straight section inside the IR [35] or placing the solenoid sections in the adjacent long straight sections following the \u201csymmetric arrangement\u201d; both schemes however yield unsatisfactory results. The first scheme introduces strong perturbation to the layout of the IR and degrades the optics performance, though the depolarization effect is moderate. The second scheme introduces less perturbation to the optics, but suffers from strong depolarization, because the polarization direction rotates many turns by the horizontal bending magnets between the IP and the solenoid section, which enhances the spin diffusion effects. Finally, based on the pros of both insertion schemes, an optimized insertion schemewas found. The solenoid sections are placed adjacent\nFig. 2 A solenoid compensation unit. Magnet parameters are listed in each subfigure.M is the transverse transport matrix for each unit\nto the IR in Fig. 4, forming an anti-symmetric arrangement. This on the one hand eliminates the perturbation to the IR optics and, on the other hand, reduces the depolarization contribution between the IP and the solenoid section. This optimization scheme can achieve high level of beam polarization at the IP without affecting the stability of the beam orbital motion.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, a pair of spin rotators are implemented around each IP,which enables longitudinal polarization of the beam at both IPs. The polarity setting of the solenoid magnetic field in the spin rotators ensures that the directions of n0 in the two arc regions on the left and right of the IP are the same, and \u03bd0 \u2248 a\u03b30 still holds, which does not affect the beam energy measurement based on resonant depolarization. Figure 4 takes the positron ring as an example. The spin rotator settings in the electron ring and the positron ring are just symmetrical around the IP as plotted in Fig. 5. The helicity of the colliding polarized beams could be adjusted by\nvarying the helicity of the injected polarized beams from the polarized particle sources, which will be studied separately.\nThe layout and the optics of IR remain unchanged. Just upstream of the IR, we insert a bending angle compensation section \u03b81, a straight section (SS) of the same length as the solenoid module, a bending angle compensation section \u03b82 and the solenoid module (rotatorU) in sequence. Just downstream of the IR, we insert a bending angle compensation section \u03b81, the solenoid module (rotatorD), a bending\nangle compensation section \u03b82 and a SS in sequence. More details of the optimized insertion scheme are plotted in Fig. 5.\nIn Fig. 5, the default parameters in the interaction region (IR) of the CEPC lattice are\n\u2022 \u03b8c = 16.50 mrad, half of the crossing angle between e+ ring and e\u2212 ring at the IP; \u2022 \u03b8u = \u221219.21 mrad, the total horizontal bending angle from the IP to the end of the interaction region \u201cMIRU\u201d; \u2022 \u03b8d = 13.79mrad, the total horizontal bending angle from the IP to the end of the interaction region \u201cMIRD\u201d;\nThen the longitudinal polarization condition requires\na\u03b30(\u03b8u + \u03b81 + \u03b82) = \u2212\u03c0 2 a\u03b30(\u03b8d + \u03b81) = \u03c0 2 . (10)\nWe can get \u03b81 = 1.39 mrad, \u03b82 = 2.65 mrad when a\u03b30 = 103.5.\nThe lattice structure of SS is basically the same as that of the solenoid module. However, the solenoid magnets are replaced with drifts of same length. And the quadrupoles inside the SS are retuned to create a normal uncoupled optics which is matched to the collider ring.\nThe angle compensation sections \u03b81 and \u03b82 are designed as achromat modules. Each section consists of 4 identical FODO cells with \u03c02 phase advances for both planes, to ensure that the dispersion function inside the solenoid module is zero. The dipoles in these FODO cells are as long as the dipoles in the arc FODO cells. However, the magnetic field strength is about an order of magnitude weaker than the arc dipoles.\nWe then retuned several quadrupoles to recover the fractional part of the betatron tunes of the lattice. And the deflection angles of the dipoles in the rest part of the collider ring are reduced accordingly to ensure the total horizontal deflection angle of the entire ring is 2\u03c0 .

            "text": "Spin rotators can drive betatron sideband spin resonances and lead to a lower equilibrium polarization in the nearby region even for a perfect storage ring. The electrons and positrons execute betatron oscillations, and they are subjected to additional magnet fields as they go through quadrupoles and solenoids. And their spin precession acquires a small additional orbit-dependent component. In particular, between the solenoid sections around each IP,n0 is in the horizontal plane, the horizontal betatron oscillations in quadrupole magnets, lead to spin precession around the vertical direction, perpendicular to n0. Hence, this drives first-order betatron sideband spin resonances \u03bd0 = k \u00b1 \u03bdx .\nIn a realistic storage ring, the solenoid magnetic field may be not perfectly compensated due to magnet errors. These magnet errors also drive spin resonances and lead to a reduced equilibrium beam polarization. Assuming that these magnet errors follow aGaussian distribution in the solenoid compensation unit, we introduced relative field errors for solenoids and quadrupoles with a root-mean-squared value of 0.05%, and relative roll errors for quadrupoles with a root-meansquared value of 0.01%.\nWe compared the longitudinal projection of beam polarization at the IP and the equilibrium polarization at the Z-pole. As shown in Fig. 6, the longitudinal projection of n0 at the IP is symmetrically distributed on both sides of the designed energy, a\u03b30 = 103.5. The influence of the magnet errors is negligible. Figure 7 shows the compari-\nson between the equilibrium beam polarization simulated with SLIM inside Bmad, for the cases without magnet errors and with magnet errors. The equilibrium polarization degree can be very high when the beam energy is far from spin resonances. The magnet errors enhance the depolarization near-spin resonances. However, they have negligible effect on the degree of polarization when the fractional part of a\u03b30 is near 0.5. This shows the robustness of the design against machine imperfections. Besides, Fig. 8 shows the influence of higher-order spin resonances on equilibrium beam polar-\nization, relative to the simulation results with SLIM. Here, depolarization effects of the higher-order spin resonances are simulated by a Monte Carlo method based on PTC [36]. The spin resonance regions where the equilibrium polarization level is low becomeswider and higher-order synchrotron sideband spin resonances are visible.\nOther kinds of machine imperfections also affect the orbital motion and the degree of equilibrium polarization; a systematic approach of error correction is under development [37]. Evaluation of the influence of these errors on the equilibrium polarization for a CEPC lattice without spin rotators is reported in [38], which shows a relatively high beam polarization is achievable at the Z-pole energy after the error correction. In future studies, we will introduce machine imperfections for the whole collider ring with spin rotators and evaluate the performance after a dedicated correction scheme.\nThe time-averaged beam polarization is determined by the equilibrium polarization and the injected beam polarization according to Eq. (6), which can also be expressed as\nPavg = Peq 1 + PeqP\u221e \u03c4p \u03c4b + Pinj 1 + P\u221ePeq \u03c4b\u03c4p . (11)\nFor the CEPC at the Z-pole, \u03c4p \u2248 260 h and \u03c4b \u2248 2 h. If the injected beam polarization degree is 70%, the equilibrium polarization only needs to be greater than 1.8% to maintain the time-averaged polarization larger than 50%. There is quite a largemargin from the current simulation results of the equilibrium beam polarization, which reserves tolerance for other potential depolarization mechanisms, for example the influence from beam\u2013beam interaction [39], which will be evaluated separately. The above simulations indeed confirm the analysis that depolarization effects could be largely suppressed in such an anti-symmetric structure in Refs. [15,16]."

The optics of the collider ring before and after insertion of the spin rotators are shown in Fig. 10. The betatron motions are only locally coupled in the spin rotators, while the optics of the rest of the collider ring remains undisturbed.\nTo evaluate the influence of the spin rotators on the orbital motion performance, we consider three different cases. The first is the CEPC CDR lattice without spin rotators (denoted asCDR lattice), the second is theCEPCCDR latticewith spin rotator insertions to realize longitudinal beam polarization (denoted as Solenoid On), the third is the CEPC CDR lattice with spin rotator insertions, but the solenoids are turned off and quadrupoles are retuned to recover the lattice (denoted as Solenoid Off).\nTable 1 compares the key orbital parameters between these three cases. There is an increase in the integer parts of the betatron tunes of the latter two cases and some tiny differences in themomentum compact factor andU0. The circumference of the collider ring increases by approximately 2.8 km in the presence of the spin rotators. There is no difference in the orbital parameters between Solenoid Off and Solenoid On.\nFurthermore, we examine the effect of the spin rotator on the nonlinear performance of the lattice. The leading orders of the chromaticity have been corrected by adjusting the sextupoles in the arc sectionswith SAD.We tracked the particles for one transverse damping time (about 2600 turns) to obtain the dynamic apertures, which are shown in Fig. 11. Spin rotators in the collider ring lead to a moderate shrink of the dynamic apertures. Since the requirement on dynamic aperture at the Z-pole is 17\u03c3x \u00d7 9\u03c3y \u00d7 0.49% according to the CEPC CDR, the shrink is still acceptable. The change in the dynamic aperture for Solenoid Off is tiny compared to that\nfor Solenoid On. This means that the effect of the solenoid magnets on the nonlinear performance of the lattice is compensated by the quadrupoles in the solenoid compensation unit. The dynamic aperture can be further optimized using more families of sextupoles, which is a conventional step in the lattice optimization.\nAccording to the CEPC CDR, the CEPC will work at three different energy zones. In this paper, the spin rotator presented is specifically optimized for the Z energy, but not capable to realize longitudinal polarization at theW and Higgs energies. The possibility of a spin rotator design covering a larger energy range (for example covering theW energy and even the Higgs energy as well) is beyond the scope of this work. Here, we tentatively assume the solenoid magnets in the spin rotators will be turned off when working at theW andHiggs energy zones. Then, the quadrupoles in SCUs need to be retuned to create a normal uncoupled optics.

And the differences of those parameters are acceptable. The influences of these rotators on the dynamic apertures for W and Higgs energy zones are shown in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively. Here, the leading orders of the chromaticity have been corrected by adjusting\nthe sextupoles in the arc sections with SAD. Spin rotators in the collider ring lead to a shrink of the dynamic apertures for W and Higgs; in particular, the momentum acceptances are smaller than the requirements. Hence, more comprehensive optimization of the dynamic apertures is foreseen, using more families of sextupoles.\nPotential optimization of the spin rotators insertion\nIn the above study, we present a complete spin rotator design and its insertion scheme. However the insertion scheme still has the potential for further optimization, especially in terms of the total length.\nAs we described earlier, the dipole length in the bending angle compensation sections is the same as the arc dipole, while the magnetic field is an order of magnitude weaker. Hence, we can reduce the length of the bending angle compensation sections. For example, if we reduce the length of this sections by a factor of five, from 250 to 50 m, then the beta functions at the beginning and end of the sections will also be reduced by five times. We can insert triplet cells at both ends of the section to match the optical parameters to the rest of the collider ring. According to a simple calculation, each triplet is about 40m longwith regular quadrupoles. The length of one bending angle compensation section can be reduced from 250 to 130 m. Therefore, the increase of the lattice circumference can be reduced to about 1.8 km.\nBased on the assumption that both electrons and positrons can be generated by polarized particle source, we design spin rotators for e+ and e\u2212 rings for the CEPC. However, it is also beneficial for physics programs if longitudinal polarization is only achieved for electrons and if matured polarized e+ source is still not available. In this case, spin rotators are not needed in the e+ ring. Figure 14 shows the geometry of the e+/e\u2212 rings with spin rotators only in the e\u2212 ring. Upstream of the IR of the e\u2212 ring, the bending angle compensation section \u03b81 and \u03b82 are needed following the spin rotator (rotatorU). Downstream of the IR, only the bending angle compensation section \u03b81 is needed prior to the spin rota-\nTable 2 Comparison of several key orbital parameters between the CDR lattice and the CDR lattice with rotators at W and Higgs energy zone\nW Higgs\nCDR CDR+rotators CDR CDR+rotators\nTunes \u03bdx/\u03bdy/\u03bdz 363.11/365.22/0.039 379.11/381.22/0.039 363.11/365.22/0.065 379.11/381.22/0.065 Emittances x/ z 0.54 nm/1.94 \u00b5m 0.53 nm/1.95 \u00b5m 1.21 nm/2.66 \u00b5m 1.21 nm/2.65 \u00b5m Momentum compact factor \u03b1p 1.11 \u00d7 10\u22125 1.07 \u00d7 10\u22125 1.11 \u00d7 10\u22125 1.07 \u00d7 10\u22125 Circumference (m) 100016.35 102841.95 100016.35 102841.95\nSR energy loss per turn U0 (GeV) 0.34 0.34 1.73 1.72 \u03b2 function at IPs \u03b2 x/\u03b2 y 0.36/0.0015 0.36/0.0015 0.36/0.0015 0.36/0.0015\ntor (rotatorD).

Here the bending angle compensation section \u03b8 = 4.04 mrad, which can be incorporated into the IR. In this case, the increase of the collider ring length is only contributed by the four spin rotators.

However, the simulation of realistic misalignments, the modeling of the correction of the orbital imperfections and the depolarizing effects of the detector solenoids are very important for beam polarization at ultrahigh beam energies. These topics will be studied in the future\non the basis of this simulation framework and will be an integral part of investigation of feasibility of attaining high beam polarization at the CEPC.\nThere is still room for further optimization of the dynamic apertures and the length of spin rotators. As we discussed in \u201cPotential optimization of the spin rotators insertion\u201d section, the length growth of the collider ring can be reduced to 1.8 km for e+/e\u2212 longitudinal polarization and to 1.18 km for e\u2212 longitudinal polarization based on the current CEPC CDR lattice design. In case of a redesign of the CEPC lattice, if the crossing angle can be modified to 30.35 mrad and the IR region is adjusted accordingly, the total length occupied by the insertion of the spin rotator can be reduced to about 400m for longitudinal polarized e\u2212 beam alone or for longitudinal polarized e\u2212/e+ beams.\nAcknowledgements The authors are especially grateful to Dr. Sergei Nikitin for the helpful discussion and the proofreading.
