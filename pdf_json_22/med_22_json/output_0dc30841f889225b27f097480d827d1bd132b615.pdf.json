    "abstractText": "Understanding the public\u2019s perceptions of child pornography helps identify gaps in awareness and knowledge, impacts legislative decision making, quantifies stigmatization, and provides a baseline for identifying differences between lay and offender populations for clinical purposes. This research provides a comprehensive public survey assessing these issues. An Internet-based sample of 524 adults (mean age = 47 years, 51% female) within the USA were asked about their understanding and beliefs related to child pornography and individuals who view child pornography. The questions covered three topic areas\u2014general perceptions of child pornography, endorsement of child pornography beliefs, and opinions related to the legality of various forms of child pornography as well as the decision making related to sentencing and sex offender registration for child pornography consumers. The research found that the public viewed these offenses as more severe than most other crimes and that there was an overestimation by the public of risks related to recidivism and contact offending. Additionally, the research found that there was support for most of the current sentencing guidelines in the USA, including sex offender registration, and that there was limited support for treatment over incarceration.",

            "text": "There has been extensive work done on the public\u2019s perceptions and attitudes related to individuals who have committed sex offenses (Harper et\u00a0al., 2017), which can influence everything from the acceptance of and access to treatment (Brown, 1999; Wnuk et\u00a0al., 2006) to public policy related to tracking and registration (Kernsmith et\u00a0al., 2009; Schiavone & Jeglic, 2009). Instruments such as the Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offenders scale (Church et\u00a0al., 2008) have evolved and been conceptualized with three factors that have direct relevance to online child pornography consumers, specifically punitiveness, stereotype endorsement, and risk perception (Harper & Hogue, 2015b). This research evaluates the public\u2019s perceptions of child pornography and those who consume it using a similar conceptualization. Punitiveness\nis evaluated through perceived severity and acceptance of treatment, stereotype endorsement is evaluated by the endorsement of beliefs related to child pornographers, and risk perception is evaluated through estimates of recidivism and contact offending.\nThe term \u201cchild pornography\u201d is used in this research in lieu of the broader term child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) (Frange\u017e et\u00a0al., 2015). Because child pornography is more familiar to the lay public who were the respondents in this research, and because many of the questions relate to the legal concept which uses that term, this phrasing was used in this paper consistent with the Luxembourg guidelines (Terminology & Semantics Interagency Working Group on Sexual Exploitation of Children, 2016), except where the broader definition is needed to encompass child erotica. In the USA, child pornography is defined by federal law as any visual depiction of a minor (an individual under the age of 18) engaging in sexually explicit conduct (SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND OTHER ABUSE OF CHILDREN\u2014Definitions, n.d.).\nPublic perceptions of child pornography have far-reaching consequences, ranging from influences on sentencing guidelines and legislation to contributing to the social\n* Chad M.

Despite the far-reaching societal impacts, minimal empirical work has been done to assess the public\u2019s views on child pornography and child pornography consumers. Additionally, there are conflicting social trends that impact those perceptions. General viewing of pornography has become more acceptable and normalized (Diamond, 2009; Dugan, 2018), while views regarding the age of consent show a trend toward increasing rather than lowering the legal consent age (Cawson et\u00a0al., 2000; Graham, 2018).\nThe public\u2019s views on child pornography are generally an extension of societal and cultural views on sex offending in general, as well as child sexual abuse, and public policy in this space can be driven by emotion rather than evidence. Child sexual abuse, in particular, may invoke a more visceral emotional response than other sex crimes, with child pornography being an extension of that abuse. In reviewing child pornography laws (primarily in a Canadian and the USA context), Ryder (2003) noted that \u201cChild sexual abuse is a topic that evokes visceral disgust in all reasonable people\u201d (p. 102).\nThere are several relevant works associated with how the public generally perceives child pornography consumers. Hitikasch et\u00a0al. (2017), using a German community sample, found that child pornography viewing was rated at the same severity as distribution of child pornography, both of which were viewed as warranting as severe a punishment as sexual assault crimes. Mears et\u00a0al. (2008) used a telephone poll of adults in the USA that showed the majority of the public support incarceration for child pornography consumers (68%) and that there is significant support for both treatment and the use of sex offender registries for these offenses. Lam et\u00a0al. (2010) provided lay individuals (Canadian university students) two scenarios to evaluate, varying the age and gender of victims and offenders. They found that lay individuals overestimated the likelihood that a person possessing child pornography was a pedophile, and that they recommended more severe sentencing inversely related to the age of the victim. Additionally, looking at their awareness of the law, 88% of the individuals knew that distribution, and 84% that possession, of child pornography was illegal. Conversely, 45% were unsure that viewing child pornography was illegal and 7% believed it was legal. McCabe (2000) found that most USA citizens polled, 95%, knew that distributing child pornography was illegal, and 92% knew that possessing child pornography was illegal. Conversely, 92% believed that \u201cviewing computer-generated child pornography was okay\u201d (McCabe, 2000, p. 75), and 32% believed that downloading child pornography from a newsgroup was legal. Additional research polling adults in the USA showed support for the illegality of computer-generated child pornography, though at a level that was differentiated from real depictions of children (Kliethermes, 2015), however a survey using a German community sample found that 84% of participants believed\nthat computer-generated sexual imagery of minors should be classified as child pornography (Hitikasch et\u00a0al., 2017).\nHunn et\u00a0al. (2020) used vignettes to assess the Australian public\u2019s awareness of legality and their views on victimization. They found high awareness that possession of child pornography is illegal, but limited awareness that possessing virtual child pornography is illegal (possession for virtual child pornography is illegal in both Australia and the USA). In another study evaluating the attitudes of Australian university students, approximately 90% agreed that viewing child pornography had a direct impact on victimization, and 79% agreement that computer-generated child pornography should be illegal (Prichard et\u00a0al., 2016). Although not evaluating lay individuals, Francis (2015) asked judges and psychologists in the USA their opinions of individuals convicted of child pornography possession, finding that there were strong beliefs in high rates of recidivism and in the ineffectiveness of sex offender registration.\nIndividuals who possess child pornography are frequently stereotyped as mentally ill or having a \u201csickness\u201d on the basis of the act itself (US v. Schenberger, 2007; US v. Vanderwerfhorst, 2009). The research, however, provides a picture that is more nuanced. Some studies have found self-reported comorbid psychopathology in the form of personality disorders as high as 40% (Webb et\u00a0al., 2007), while rates of diagnosed mental illness among child pornography possessors has been shown to be as low as 5% (Wolak et\u00a0al., 2011). The primary psychopathology associated with individuals who commit child pornography offenses is pedophilia (both as a mental illness and as an undiagnosed exhibition of pedophilic interests), and Seto et\u00a0al. (2006) found the percentage of individuals who committed child pornography offenses that could be classified as pedophiles to be approximately 60% based on a phallometric response to viewing relevant images.\nRecidivism is another area with limited lay understanding that is consistent with distorted risk perceptions (Harper & Hogue, 2015b). Eke et\u00a0al. (2011) found the 4.1\u00a0year recidivism rate for individuals convicted of child pornography offenses committing another child pornography offense to be 6.8%. However, if their only prior conviction was child pornography-related (possession, distribution, or production), the rate dropped to 4.4%. In evaluating their risk assessment tool, CPORT, Seto and Eke (2015) found a similar rate, with individuals who committed only child pornography offenses recidivating at 7% in a 5\u00a0year follow-up period. Faust et\u00a0al. (2015) found an even lower rate of recidivism for individuals who committed only child pornography offenses (1.6%) at an average follow-up time of 4.8\u00a0years. Soldino et\u00a0al. (2020) found a similar 2% rate on a 5\u00a0year follow-up with individuals who committed only child pornography offenses. These rates represent re-arrest data and do not include individuals who continued to offend but were not caught again, and thus represent a lower bound approximation.\n1 3\nAnother common belief put forward relates to the victimization of those who offend as part of a cycle of abuse. Evidence, however, shows the majority of individuals who committed child pornography offenses had not been sexually abused as a child, with rates ranging from 11.7 (Faust et\u00a0al., 2015) to 26% (Webb et\u00a0al., 2007). No comprehensive quantification of the public\u2019s perception of childhood sexual abuse rates among individuals who committed child pornography offenses has been evaluated to-date.\nThe sexting trend and ubiquity of mobile phones with high quality cameras has changed the dynamics of victimization. Historically, all child pornography represented primary victimization (the sexual abuse or direct exploitation of a child) as well as secondary victimization (the continuance of sexual abuse through repeated distribution and viewing), though self-generated child pornography has altered that pattern (Leary, 2009). Specifically, there may be no primary victimization with self-generated child pornography, excepting cases of coercion or sextortion (Patchin & Hinduja, 2020), and the percentage of self-generated child pornography is growing (Internet Watch Foundation, 2020).\nSentencing and sex offender registration for individuals who commit child pornography offenses is another area of ongoing interest (Christensen & Tsagaris, 2020; Hunn et\u00a0al., 2018; Proeve & Wolf, 2019), and is influenced by both rehabilitative and punitive attitudes (Harper & Hogue, 2015b). The United States Sentencing Commission provides enhancements that increase the sentences of individuals convicted of child pornography offenses based on viewing habits. These enhancements occur based on the age of the victims portrayed, with an enhancement for possession of images of minors under the age of 12 and a second enhancement if the victim was an infant or toddler. They also occur based on the number of images or videos, and whether or not sadistic/masochistic content is present (United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, 2018). In addition to traditional sentencing enhancements, many localities require individuals convicted of child pornography offenses to register as sex offenders, despite little evidence of their efficacy and their collateral consequences (Drake & Aos, 2009; Pawson, 2002; Tewksbury, 2005). Public support for these registries remains strong, however, particularly with regard to child sex offenses, indicating a disconnect between perception and efficacy (Kernsmith et\u00a0al., 2009).\nThis work empirically measures and evaluates the public\u2019s perceptions of child pornography consumers and child pornography offenses. First, general perceptions of child pornography and child pornography consumers are evaluated. Second, the level of knowledge of the public on various issues surrounding child pornography is assessed against current research. Finally, perceptions associated with the legal implications of child pornography and how child pornography consumers should be evaluated for sentencing purposes is\npresented. This research represents the most comprehensive study to-date of public perceptions on child pornography and provides results that can be utilized to direct public education on issues related to child pornography to reduce the stigmatization of individuals who commit these offenses and better align public understanding with evidence."

Participants were recruited using the Qualtrics panel service, which provides pre-identified participants from a pool of individuals recruited and compensated by Qualtrics meeting specific criteria outlined by the researcher (Online Panels: Get Responses for Surveys & Research | Qualtrics, 2020). Qualtrics panels have been shown to have appropriate representativeness on the dimensions of interest and to be of sufficient quality for research with the appropriate controls in place (e.g., attention and timing checks) (Boas et\u00a0al., 2020; Miller et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThe survey population for this research was Englishspeaking adults (18\u00a0years of age or older) living in the USA. Prior to participation in the survey, panel members were provided with information on how the data collected would be used and both the benefits and risks associated with participation. Participants were required to affirmatively consent prior to starting the survey. Any individuals who chose not to continue with the survey were permitted to withdraw at any point prior to submission, and the results of those individuals were not retained. 624 individuals began the survey, and of those individuals 99 failed to complete the survey and their results were not recorded, resulting in 525 completed surveys.\nAs part of the survey execution, an initial soft launch with a small number of participants (n = 31) was conducted to confirm survey structure and train automated time metrics (as noted below) to address insufficient effort responding (IER)\n1 3\nconcerns (Kraiger et\u00a0al., 2019). Additionally, two attention checks were built into the survey, with one as a multiplechoice question and a second as part of a matrix question. Respondents failing the attention checks were automatically discarded by Qualtrics to improve response quality (Owens & Hawkins, 2019). Final completion times in seconds were recorded as part of the soft launch (M = 802, SD = 598), and any responses taking less than 203\u00a0s (one standard deviation from the mean) were discarded to eliminate individuals answering without taking adequate time to read the questions and responses (n = 1). A total of 524 total surveys meeting quality standards were retained for analysis.\nThe survey participants had a mean age of 47\u00a0years and identified their gender as 51% female and 48% male. The participants primarily identified as heterosexual (91%), followed by bisexual (4%) and homosexual (4%). The majority of the participants identified themselves as White or Caucasian (76%), and 15% identified as Black or African American, 8% as Hispanic or Latino, 3% as Asian, 1% as American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1% as Other, and less than 1% as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (participants were permitted to identify in multiple categories). Fifty-two percent of respondents were currently working, and 48% indicated they were in a non-work status, with the majority of those individuals (21%) indicating they were retired. For the highest level of education obtained, 23% completed high school or the equivalent, 24% completed some college but did not receive a degree, 11% received an associate degree, 25% received a bachelor\u2019s degree, and 15% received an advanced degree. Forty-eight percent of participants were married or in a domestic union, 31% were single, 14% were divorced or separated, and 6% were widowed. Participant income ranged from 0 through $15,500,000, with a mean income of $103,091. The principal detailed demographics of the respondents are shown in Appendix Table\u00a02."

The reference crimes were taken from the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) category list, which provides a ranking of crimes by judicial severity (Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics, 2020). The reference crimes, from most severe to least severe, were as follows:\n(1) Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter (2) Rape (3) Robbery (4) Aggravated Assault (5) Burglary (breaking and entering) (6) Larceny-Theft (except auto) (7) Motor Vehicle Theft (8) Arson\nThe reference crimes, along with child pornography possession, were presented in a randomized fashion to each of the participants, who were asked to rank them in terms of their personal perceptions of severity. The median rankings were then calculated for each of the crime categories.\nData related to the perceived victimization of the minors portrayed in child pornography was ascertained by asking what percentage of those portrayed were willing participants. The participants were additionally asked how difficult it is for individuals who view child pornography to stop, on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from \u201cExtremely Easy\u201d to \u201cExtremely Difficult.\u201d\nTwo additional questions were asked related to the ease of finding child pornography (to evaluate the public perception of the likelihood of \u201caccidental\u201d viewing) and perceived victimization. In lieu of Likert-type questions where low endorsement was likely, the questions were formulated to capture nuance related to common cognitive distortions (e.g., Virtual is Not Real and Internet is Uncontrollable) (Paquette & Cortoni, 2020; Steel et\u00a0al., 2020). For the perceived ease of finding child pornography, participants were given four statements related to the likelihood of coming across child pornography and asked which of them they most agreed with:\n\u2022 Anyone can accidentally come across child pornography while browsing the web. \u2022 Individuals visiting mainstream adult websites may accidentally come across child pornography. \u2022 Individuals visiting less mainstream adult websites may accidentally come across child pornography. \u2022 Only individuals that actively seek out child pornography will find child pornography.\n1 3\nTo evaluate the perceived impact of viewing child pornography on child victimization, participants were asked to select which of the following statements they most agreed with:\n\u2022 Viewing child pornography is directly responsible for creating child victims. \u2022 Viewing child pornography is indirectly responsible for creating child victims. \u2022 Viewing child pornography does not contribute to child victimization (Steel et\u00a0al., 2020)."

            "text": "Members of the public rated child pornography possession as more severe than all property offenses and all but the two most severe offenses against the person, rape and criminal homicide. Male participants ranked child pornography possession as slightly less severe than female participants, which is potentially explained by greater use and acceptance of general pornography by males (e.g., Hald, 2006). The higher severity ranking of child pornography possession associated with identification as Hispanic or Latino is harder to explain, and additional research, potentially incorporating other demographic factors such as religion, is needed to determine the reasons for that difference. There was no perceived difference in severity between viewing and possession, with a very low endorsement of viewing as being a lesser action than downloading and saving child pornography.\nThere is a current gap in research in evaluating how many minors shown in child pornography were willing participants in the act (separate from the illegal production, distribution, and viewing). Preliminary work indicates it may be a significant minority of images, given the patterns of redistribution of self-generated material (Internet Watch Foundation, 2015; Smith, 2012). Recent data from the Internet Watch Foundation indicated that approximately one third of the reports of web images they had received were self-generated (Internet Watch Foundation, 2020), though what percentage of those individuals were groomed or coerced is unknown and prior research indicates the percentage of self-generated images that involve coercion may be as high as two thirds (Quayle et\u00a0al., 2018). The public\u2019s perception that the majority of cases involved non-willing participants (which includes minors, where they cannot willingly consent), is reasonable based on historical production mechanisms, the relative recency of the sexting phenomenon, and the amount of coercion present in self-generated images. This is also consistent with the public\u2019s view that child pornography causes direct victimization, which 72% of respondents believed to the most accurate assessment from the choices provided.\nMore than half of the public sample supported the notion that individuals who view child pornography may come across offending material without actually searching for it, despite a lack of evidence that accidental viewing occurs in practice (Corriveau & Fortin, 2011), showing that this is a common, if inaccurate, belief. The public\u2019s belief in accidental viewing was higher than that in an offender population\u2014Seto et\u00a0al. found that a large proportion (40% in a police sample and 32% in a clinical sample) of individuals who committed child pornography offenses claimed that they accidentally came across it, though they noted that this explanation was inconsistent with other answers provided by many of those who committed child pornography offenses\nregarding their motives (Seto et\u00a0al., 2010). Merdian et\u00a0al. (2013) identified that approximately 10% of individuals who committed child pornography offenses claimed at least initial accidental access, and Winder et\u00a0al. (2015) identified similar themes in child pornography consumers\u2019 accounts.\nThe public\u2019s estimates of the various risk characteristics of child pornography consumers were substantially different than the actual rates, showing high public endorsement of inaccurate child pornography beliefs. For recidivism, the 72% estimate is an order of magnitude higher than the actual recidivism rates, which ranged from 1.6 (Faust et\u00a0al., 2015) to 2.7% (at 5\u00a0years) (Elliott et\u00a0al., 2019) to 7% (Seto & Eke, 2015). This is consistent with prior research asking university students to predict recidivism, which they predicted to be 69%, and with the public\u2019s view that stopping is difficult for child pornography consumers, which 62% estimated to be difficult (Lam et\u00a0al., 2010). The perceived risk of contact offending was higher (63%) than the 46% identified in a prior study of university students (Lam et\u00a0al., 2010), and again an order of magnitude higher than the actual rates, which were measured to be between approximately 3% (Elliott et\u00a0al., 2019; Faust et\u00a0al., 2015) and 4% (Seto & Eke, 2005). This is additionally higher than the estimated rate of identified contact offenses at the time of the index offense (12%) as well as the overall self-reported contact offense rate (55%) identified in a previous meta-analysis (Seto et\u00a0al., 2011), the studies in which primarily looked at individuals who had been arrested for child pornography offenses, representing an upper bound sample. The estimates of the percentage of individuals who commit child pornography offenses that are pedophiles (79%) was also higher than actual estimates of pedophilia of approximately 60% identified by Seto et\u00a0al. (2006) but consistent with higher estimates from other lay research (Lam et\u00a0al., 2010). This high estimate additionally shows a potential lack of public understanding of the differences between pedophiles and hebephiles, as well as a general underestimation of other influences that may drive child pornography consumption (e.g., novelty-seeking behavior).\nThe overestimates of contact offending, recidivism, and the presence of pedophilia were moderately correlated with the support for sex offender registration for child pornography offenses and provide explanatory power for the strong public support for sex offender registries, which was found to be higher (84%) than earlier research (68%) (Mears et\u00a0al., 2008), despite a lack of evidence of their effectiveness (Bouffard & Askew, 2019). The highest correlation with support for sex offender registration was with perceiving a high prevalence of pedophilia. This is consistent with the general and often vitriolic public dislike of pedophiles\u2014Jahnke et\u00a0al., for example, found that 28% of an English-speaking sample believed they would be \u201cbetter-off dead\u201d (Jahnke, et\u00a0al., 2015a, 2015b). Conversely, support for treatment instead of prison was generally low at 32% and had a weak negative\n1 3\ncorrelation with perceived risk related to contact offending, recidivism, and pedophilia prevalence. Tempering those views, the public estimated that approximately 62% of child pornography consumers were themselves abused as children. This is substantially higher than the actual rates, which were estimated to be approximately 21% (compared to 9% for the reference population) in a meta-analysis (Babchishin et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe results confirmed that there is strong public support for the illegality of virtual or computer-generated child pornography, as well as child erotica, indicating support for revised legislation in this area. As virtual becomes closer to real with improvements in technology, and the understanding that child erotica can be exploited equally by individuals who offend, and as the originalist arguments that the offenses be tied to underlying abuse are less frequent, there is the potential for revisiting the definitions of what constitutes illegal child pornography to include other forms of CSEM. Prior work has shown that individuals did not necessarily tie computer-generated child pornography to direct harm (Hunn et\u00a0al., 2020), indicating that other factors may be driving the substantial support for illegality, which additional research is needed to elucidate.\nFor sentencing purposes, there was generally strong support for using the severity of the content in determining sentence length, but mixed support for using the age of victims and the number of images as part of the consideration. This is somewhat consistent with the United States Sentencing Commission guidelines, which allow for a larger enhancement for sadistic and/or masochistic conduct (4 levels) and quantity (up to 5 levels) than age (2 levels) (United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines, 2018)2 In particular, the quantity-related enhancement may not be aligned with the viewing of images (as opposed to the possession), which is more difficult to ascertain.\nBecause most participants are unlikely to personally know someone convicted of possessing child pornography, misperceptions regarding the risk can be, at least in part, attributed to media representation, similar to that for sex offenders as a whole (Harper & Hogue, 2015a). The availability heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), provides that the ease with which we recall instances of a rare event can lead to overestimates of the probability that event occurs. The news media have been shown to favor extreme and atypical crimes, especially those involving vulnerable victims, which are recalled when the availability heuristic is engaged. This causes an overestimation of associated risks (O\u2019Connell, 1999). Because child pornography production offenses are the most extreme, and because there is a direct victim that\ncan be exemplified, there may be a tendency for individuals to recall these instances more freely and overestimate overall risk (Aust & Zillmann, 1996). Distorted media portrayals may also encourage further victimization. Negative portrayals of mental illness, for example, have been shown to impair help-seeking (Stuart, 2006; Wahl, 1992), and the additional stigma associated with an interest in child pornography may increase offender risk (Seidler, 2010). Additionally, the use of accurate terminology in the media is of high import\u2014 the high percentage of the public that perceived individuals who viewed child pornography to be pedophiles indicates a potential conflation of these terms. Encouragingly, prior research has shown that psychoeducation is effective in combating punitive attitudes with other sex offenders and may be of similar benefit in child pornography offenses (Kleban & Jeglic, 2012)."

While the quality problems inherent in Internet survey research are well known, the steps taken to validate responses and ensure attention are believed to have minimized these in this research. Additionally, the research was conducted during the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak, which may have influenced unemployment numbers within the demographic data (Coibion et\u00a0al., 2020).\nWhile attempts were made to use lay terminology, certain clinical terms were included such as pedophilia, whose clinical definition (which requires the attraction to pre-pubescent children) may be more restrictive than the common usage (which may encompass hebephilia). For the ranking criteria, the FBI\u2019s UCR rankings were used as they are already categorized based on severity and used for law enforcement reporting in the USA. Additional research using other child pornography crimes (other than viewing), as well as contact abuse categories, would provide further context on public perceptions of viewing in relation to other crimes against children."

            "text": "Providing a comprehensive view of the public\u2019s perceptions on child pornography consumers is critical as an input to both public policy and for clinical purposes. For public policy, this research identified major discrepancies between the perceived risk of child pornography consumers and the actual risk of both recidivism and committing contact offenses. Greater public awareness and targeted education in these areas is strongly needed. These misperceptions can impact legislation related to the illegality of CSEM, sentencing severity and sex 2 Each level indicates a more severe sentence based on tables of offenses.\noffender registration as well as decisions about prosecution instead of treatment, and better-informed decision making is warranted. They can also directly impact the continuing stigmatization of individuals who commit child sex offenses, which is high and provides a barrier to effective treatment and re-integration into society of those individuals (Jahnke et\u00a0al., 2015a, b; Vitis, 2018).\nFor treatment purposes, the public\u2019s endorsement of inaccurate beliefs and the explanations they provided for child pornography viewing serve as a baseline for comparison. Additional research looking at how they differ in an offender population can assist in identifying cognitive distortions, which can provide individualized treatment targets. Additionally, the confirmation of the public\u2019s negative views of individuals who view child pornography highlights the need for treatment to include coping strategies for the ongoing stigmatization of these individuals."
