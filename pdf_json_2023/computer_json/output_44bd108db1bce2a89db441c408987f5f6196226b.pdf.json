    "abstractText": "Numerous pieces of evidence have indicated that microRNA (miRNA) plays a crucial role in a series of significant biological processes and is closely related to complex disease. However, the traditional biological experimental methods used to verify disease-related miRNAs are inefficient and expensive. Thus, it is necessary to design some excellent approaches to improve efficiency. In this work, a novel method (CFSAEMDA) is proposed for the prediction of unknown miRNA\u2013disease associations (MDAs). Specifically, we first capture the interactive features of miRNA and disease by integrating multi-source information. Then, the stacked autoencoder is applied for obtaining the underlying feature representation. Finally, the modified cascade forest model is employed to complete the final prediction. The experimental results present that the AUC value obtained by our method is 97.67%. The performance of CFSAEMDA is superior to several of the latest methods. In addition, case studies conducted on lung neoplasms, breast neoplasms and hepatocellular carcinoma further show that the CFSAEMDA method may be regarded as a utility approach to infer unknown disease\u2013miRNA relationships.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNA molecules and play critical roles in gene expression programs and biological processes [1\u20133]. Many scholars have explored and studied the role of miRNAs in the human body [4]. Moreover, some new works in the literature have shown that the differential expression of miRNAs is associated with human disease pathogenesis, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease [5], cardiovascular disease [6], breast cancer [7,8] and many others [9\u201311]. Therefore, the study of the relationship between miRNA and disease is meaningful for the treatment of diseases and has become a hot topic in the field of bioinformatics. Some traditional biological experimental methods that are used to verify unknown miRNAs associated with a certain disease, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [12] and microarray profiling [13], often require a large investment of money and time and are inefficient. Now, the computing efficiency of computers has greatly been improved. We can design some excellent predictive models to identify unknown MDAs, which are efficient and economical. These associations can be used for further experimental verification. The current potential miRNA\u2013disease relationship identification methods can be divided into two types. The first type of method is based on a network algorithm that exploits the similarity of miRNAs and diseases from different perspectives. The pioneering model was designed by Jiang et al. [14]. The model applies a scoring system to rank the probability of disease-related miRNAs. By integrating Gaussian similarity, Chen et al. [15] designed the WBSMDA method to predict MDAs. In addition, due to WBSMDA being a global rank method, this method allows for calculating the connections of miRNA\u2013disease for all diseases simultaneously. Zeng et al. [16] used a bilayer network and applied\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5013. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28135013 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nthe structural consistency as a metric of network performance. Then the authors used structural perturbation to infer MDAs in the bilayer network. In [17], via non-negative matrix factorization, the authors proposed a ranking method. In particular, this method introduced the sparseness characteristic to make prediction more reliable. Yu et al. [18] developed KDFGMDA to infer unknown disease-related miRNAs. The KDFGMDA method first obtained triple information of existing databases and massive experimental data, then a graph representation model was trained to complete prediction tasks. Zhang et al. [19] proposed the FLNSNLI method, which is based on fast linear neighborhood similarity. The miRNAs and diseases are expressed in the form association profiles, then the fast linear neighborhood similarity and association profiles are used to measure miRNA\u2013miRNA similarity and disease\u2013disease similarity. Finally, the label propagation algorithm is applied to calculate the probability score. Some other interesting methods based on a complex network can be seen in [20,21]. The second category of methods is machine learning-based methods, which have been indicated to be powerful in many classification tasks, especially in bioinformatics [22,23]. For instance, Zheng et al. [24] developed the MLMDA method to predict microRNA\u2013disease associations. This method used the random forest classifier to predict via integrating heterogeneous information sources. Zhou et al. [25] used K-means clustering to balance the sample set, and used gradient boosting decision trees for feature extraction. Finally, the logical regression is applied to predict labels. Some deep learning methods are also designed for predicting MDAs. Chen et al. [26] inferred novel MDAs by the deep-belief network model. During the pre-training process, this method utilized all of the information. Liu et al. [27] proposed a new feature representation method, and used the random forest method to complete the prediction. Ai et al. [28] designed an end-to-end computational method by integrating the multi-source information and reformulating the score matrix. In [29], based on the deep neural network, the authors developed a new model named NCFM, which integrated the generalization of the neural network and the memorization of matrix factorization. The MDA-CNN method was proposed in [30]. This method first obtains interaction features. Then, an autoencoder is utilized to obtain the critical feature combination. Finally, after inputting the low-dimensional feature representation, MDA-CNN inferred the final label by using a convolutional neural network.Wang et al. [31] fully utilized unlabeled samples and pretrained the stacked autoencoders in an unsupervised manner. This method is suitable for the dataset with a small number of positive data and a large number of negative data. More and more deep neural networks are used for classification tasks and have achieved good results. Inspired by deep neural networks processing information layer by layer, Zhou et al. [32] developed the deep forest learning model, including the multigrained scanning module and cascade forest structure. Deep forest methods try to build deep models through non-differentiable modules and have fewer hyperparameters than deep neural networks. Furthermore, it is robust to parameter settings, and thus, even if we do not adjust the parameter settings, it still has excellent performance. Due to this, many various prediction tasks are well solved by using the deep forest method [33]. For instance, Chu et al. [34] developed a cascade forest (DTI-CDF) approach to infer novel interactions between the drug and target. Compared with other methods, such as DDR [35], the DTI-CDF model achieved better predictive performance. Zeng et al. [36] presented the AOPEDF method, an arbitrary-order proximity embedded cascade forest method, for predicting drug\u2013target interactions. The AOPEDF method integrated 15 different types of network information, and a deep cascade forest model with 6 estimators was used to complete the prediction task. In the field of MDAs, Dai et al. [37] proposed the MDA-CF method for predicting unknown MDAs. This method uses multiple types of information to represent the association between miRNA and disease, and applies a cascade forest model with four estimators to infer new MDAs. The prediction efficiency of the MDA-CF method is excellent.\nIn this work, we present a new method called CFSAEMDA to infer MDAs. In the proposed method, various types of information, including miRNA similarity (functional and Gaussian similarity) and disease similarity (semantic and Gaussian similarity), are integrated to construct a comprehensive feature descriptor of MDAs. Then, the latent feature information is obtained by using the stacked autoencoder. Finally, the modified cascade forest model is trained by inputting reduced features to accurately classify and infer novel MDAs. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 97.67%, and is superior to several of the latest methods and classical machine learning algorithms. In particular, the case studies of lung neoplasms, breast neoplasms and hepatocellular carcinoma show that 49, 50 and 47 of the top 50 predicted relevant miRNAs are confirmed by the latest works in the literature, respectively."

Three parts of them are utilized to train the CFSAEMDA model (training subset), and the residual one is used as the test subset. The final result is obtained by averaging the four test subsets. Our task is binary classification work. To evaluate the performance of CFSAEMDA fairly, we choose several common metrics, including accuracy (Acc), precision (Pre), sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and the F1-score (F1). The equations of these metrics are given by\nAcc = TP + TN\nTP + TN + FP + FN , (1)\nPre = TP\nTP + FP , (2)\nSen = TP\nTP + FN , (3)\nSpe = TN\nTN + FP , (4)\nMCC = TP \u2217 TN \u2212 FP \u2217 FN\u221a\n(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN) , (5)\nF1 = 2TP\n2TP + FP + FN , (6)\nwhere TP and TN are the number of miRNA\u2013disease with association and miRNA\u2013disease without association cases that were successfully identified, respectively. FP(FN) represents the number of miRNA\u2013disease with (without) association examples that are incorrectly identified. Furthermore, we also calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the precision\u2013recall curve (AUPR), respectively. The range of values for AUC and AUPR is [0, 1]. Normally, the higher AUPR and AUC values represent the better performance of the model."

The MDA-CF method achieved prediction by the cascaded forest model. The estimators in the MDA-CF method are set to two XGBoosts and two random forests. The AOPEDF method also used the cascaded forest model to predict potential MDAs, which includes two random forests, two XGBoosts and two extra trees.

We trained the model under identical conditions and used the test set to evaluate its performance. The predictive performance of each model is shown in Table 3. The CFSAEMDA method obtained an AUC of 97.67%, which is superior to MDA-CF (94.83%), AOPEDF (95.48%), DDIMDL (94.65%) and SVM (96.04%).

Many scholars are very interested in the study of diseases in humans, and effective early diagnosis is crucial to the treatment of diseases. We first removed all the association information of specific diseases, including known and unknown associations. Then we balanced the remaining samples for training. Finally, the trained model was used to output the prediction probability scores and sort them. The prediction results were confirmed using the HMDD v3.0 [39] database. Firstly, we chose to study the associations between lung neoplasms and miRNAs. Lung neoplasms are abnormal growths of tissue that form in the lungs. Among all cancers, the death rate of lung neoplasms is the highest in men and the second highest in women. Numerous works in the literature have shown that the generation of lung neoplasms is associated with some miRNAs. For instance, let-7 is involved in the pathogenesis, migration and diffusion of lung neoplasms [40]. Thus, it is necessary to conduct the investigation on the lung neoplasms-related miRNAs. According to the experimental results, 49 of the top 50 lung neoplasms-associated miRNAs are verified (see Supplementary Table S1). We then completed the association study of breast neoplasms. Breast neoplasm is cancer of the breast tissues, most commonly arising from the milk ducts. For women, breast neoplasm is the common type of cancer. Therefore, the early diagnosis of breast neoplasm is crucial to the treatment of the disease. The researchers found that breast neoplasm is related to the overexpression of circulating miRNA-146a [41]. Based on the experimental results, 50 of the top 50 breast neoplasm-associated miRNAs are confirmed by database (see Supplementary Table S2). Finally, hepatocellular carcinoma is chosen as the third case study. hepatocellular carcinoma tends to be the main cause of death for patients with cirrhosis. Among all cancer diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma is the third-leading cause of death. Furthermore, the differential expression of miRNAs contributes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we chose hepatocellular carcinoma as a case study. The experimental results show that 47 of the top 50 hepatocellular carcinoma-associated miRNAs are confirmed (see Supplementary Table S3). It should be pointed out that some novel MDAs were found by our proposed method. For example, hsa-mir-92b was not verified to be associated with breast neoplasms in HMDD v2.0. However, the CFSAEMDA method found this MDA, and HMDD v3.0 confirmed it. Other novel MDAs found by our method are highlighted in Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S3. The case studies show the potential of the CFSAEMDA approach in guiding biological experiments."

The adjacency matrix A(i, j) is utilized to represent the interaction information between miRNAs and diseases.

            "text": "3.2.1. Functional Similarity of miRNA\nBased on the assumption that different miRNAs associated with similar diseases have similar functions, Wang et al. collected and organized the miRNA functional similarity data [43]. The corresponding data can be downloaded from http://www.cuilab.cn/fil es/images/cuilab/misim.zip, accessed on 28 May 2023. Thus, in this paper, the matrix MFS(mi, mj) is utilized to describe the functional similarity two miRNAs.\n3.2.2. Semantic Similarity of Disease\nWe apply several directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to estimate the semantic similarity of diseases [44]. Specifically, each disease i can be represented as follows: DAGi = (i, G(i), E(i)). Here, G(i) denotes the node set of all diseases, and E(i) stands for the edges in DAG. Therefore, the semantic contribution value C1 of disease d to ancestor node k can be computed by\nC1d(k) = { max{\u00b5 \u2217 C1d(k\u2032)|k\u2032 \u2208 children of k}, if d 6= k 1, if d = k\n, (7)\nwhere \u00b5 denotes the semantic contribution factor and is equal to 0.5 [43]. Then the disease semantic value DS1(d) is given by\nDS1(d) = \u2211 k\u2208G(d) C1d(k). (8)\nThe disease semantic similarity DSS1 is described by\nDSS1(di, dj) =\n\u2211 k\u2208G(di)\u2229G(dj) (C1di (k) + C1dj(k))\nDS1(di) + DS1(dj) , (9)\nwhere di and dj represent two diseases. However, the diseases\u2019 semantic contribution value is different at the same level in the DAGs. Thus another method is applied to calculate the semantic similarity of diseases [45]; the specific formula is given by\nC2d(k) = \u2212 log NG(k)\nnd , (10)\nwhere nd is the number of diseases, and NG(k) represents the number of DAGs, including k. Similarly, the disease semantic value DS2(d) and the disease semantic similarity DSS2 can be calculated by DS2(d) = \u2211\nk\u2208G(d) C2d(k), (11)\nDSS2(di, dj) =\n\u2211 k\u2208G(di)\u2229G(dj) (C2di (k) + C2dj(k))\nDS2(di) + DS2(dj) . (12)\nTherefore, the final disease semantic similarity DSS is given by\nDSS(di, dj) = 1 2 (DSS1(di, dj) + DSS2(di, dj)). (13)\n3.2.3. Gaussian Interaction Profile Kernel Similarity of miRNAs and Diseases\nAccording to the literature [46], it can be found that functionally similar miRNAs are more likely to be associated with phenotypically similar diseases. The Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernel similarity between miRNAs mi and mj can be established by the following equation:\nKSM(mi, mj) = exp(\u2212\u03b1m||IP(mi)\u2212 IP(mj)||2), (14)\n\u03b1m = \u03b1\u2032m\n1 nm\nnm \u2211\ni=1 ||IP(mi)||2\n, (15)\nwhere \u03b1m controls the kernel bandwidth, IP(mi) and IP(mj) denote the ith and jth rows in matrix IP, nm is the number of miRNAs, and \u03b1\u2032m is equal to 1 [47].\nSimilarly, the GIP kernel similarity between diseases di and dj is calculated as follows:\nKSD(di, dj) = exp(\u2212\u03b1d||IP(di)\u2212 IP(dj)||2), (16)\n\u03b1d = \u03b1\u2032d\n1 nd\nnd \u2211\ni=1 ||IP(di)||2\n.

(ii) the stacked autoencoder is applied to extract latent information representation, and (iii) the potential MDAs are predicted by a modified cascade forest structure. The framework of CFSAEMDA is shown in Figure 3.\n3.4.1. Feature Representation\nIn this part, inspired by [27], the following strategy is used to construct the high-quality feature representation of MDAs. We obtained the 495-dimensional vector MSij representing the miRNA similarity network information between two miRNAs. The 383-dimensional\nvector DSij for each disease is also obtained. Then, the feature representation of miRNAs (Fm) and disease (Fd) are given by\nFm = (MS1D\u20321, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , MS1D\u2032383, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , MS495D\u20321, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , MS495D\u2032383)T , (20)\nFd = (DS1D1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , DS1D495, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , DS383D1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , DS383D495)T , (21)\nwhere the matrix D is the verified MDA network, Di is the ith row of D and D\u2032j is the jth column transpose of D. Fm is the feature representation of miRNAs with 495 \u00d7 383 row and 495 + 495 column. Fd is the feature representation of disease with 495 \u00d7 383 row and 383 + 383 column. The final high-quality feature representation of MDAs is given by the following formula:\nF = (Fm, Fd), (22)\nwhere F is a matrix with 189,585 (495 \u00d7 383) rows and 1756 (495 + 495 + 383 + 383) columns. Then, we randomly select 5430 associations from the unknown associations as a negative sample set to balance the sample set. Therefore, we have 10,860 samples with 1756 dimensional features.\n3.4.2. Stacked Autoencoder\nMachine learning models have high requirements for the dimensionality of the data input. Namely, the high-dimensional features seriously influence the prediction performance. The feature representation obtained in the previous section is of 1756 dimensions, which is highly dimensional. Therefore, in this article, the stacked autoencoder is utilized to learn the latent feature vectors. The stacked autoencoder is a deep learning model constructed by stacking multiple single autoencoders [48]. An autoencoder consists of an encoder and a decoder. In the encoding phase, the original feature representation is fed to the encoder to achieve feature compression and dimensionality reduction. The corresponding formula is given by\nz = fe(wx + b), (23)\nwhere x is the original high-dimensional feature input, w and b denote the weights and bias, fe(\u2022) represents the non-linear activation function of the encoder phase, and z is the output of the encoder. The purpose of the decoder is to use the latent representation z to reconstruct the input x. The corresponding formula is given by\nx\u0303 = fd(w\u2032z + b\u2032), (24)\nwhere x\u0303 is the reconstruction feature representation of input x; w\u2032 and b\u2032 represent the weight and bias of the decoder phase; and fd(\u2022) denotes the non-linear activation function. Finally, the autoencoder is trained to minimize the reconstruction errors, and the formula is given by\n`(x, x\u0303) = N\n\u2211 i=1 ||xi \u2212 x\u0303i||2, (25)\nwhere N is the number of sample sets. The autoencoder is trained to minimize the above loss function and update all parameters iteratively. Here, according to previous literature [49], the stacked autoencoder is constructed by stacking three of the same autoencoders. The latent feature output dimensions of the three autoencoders are set to 1024, 512 and 256, respectively. Namely, the dimension of reduced feature representations is 256. In addition, the Adam optimizer [50], an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions based on low order moment adaptive estimation, is used to update the parameters in the training process\nof the stacked autoencoder. The Adam optimizer is better than the stochastic gradient descent optimizer. In each hidden layer, the activation function is set to the tanh activation function, and the formula is given by\ntanh(x) = ex \u2212 e\u2212x ex + e\u2212x . (26)\n3.4.3. Modified Cascade Forest Structure\nIn this article, after extracting the latent vector representation, the cascade forest structure (see Figure 3) is utilized for prediction. This structure includes two parts: estimators and predictor, which can ensure the layer-by-layer processing of information. Here, at each level of cascade, we set four estimators, including one random forest [51], one completely random tree forest, one XGBoost [52] and one LightGBM [53]. Each estimator has 100 trees, and there are 400 trees in each cascaded level. The diversity of estimators is crucial for ensemble construction [54]. Given an instance, each estimater can produce an estimate of class distribution. For example, the random forest estimator averages the results of each tree to obtain the final class vector as illustrated in Figure 4. In our work, it is a binary classification task. Four estimators will generate eight-dimensional class vectors, which can be regarded as augmented features. Then, the class vectors are concatenated with the original feature vectors. In addition, each estimator will conduct 5-fold cross validation to prevent overfitting. After expanding to a new level, the performance of the entire cascade will be evaluated on the validation set. If there is no significant improvement in the performance, the cascade layer will automatically terminate. Namely, the complexity of the cascade forest model is determined by the datasets.\nThe traditional cascaded forest model obtains the final predicted value by averaging the prediction results of four estimators. In this paper, we modify the predictor to the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm [55], which has excellent predictive ability. The kernel function of SVM is set to the polynomial function. The modification of the predictor greatly improves the performance of the model."
