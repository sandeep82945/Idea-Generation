    "abstractText": "In this study, highly efficient ECL luminophores composed of iridium complex-based nanowires (Ir\u2013NCDs) were synthesized via covalently linking bis(2-phenylpyridine)-(4-carboxypropyl2,2\u2032-bipyridyl) iridium(III) hexafluorophosphate with nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (NCDs). The ECL intensity of the nanowires showed a five-fold increase in ECL intensity compared with the iridium complex monomer under the same experimental conditions. A label-free ECL biosensing platform based on Ir\u2013NCDs was established for Salmonella enteritidis (SE) detection. The ECL signal was quenched linearly in the range of 102\u2013108 CFU/mL for SE with a detection limit of 102 CFU/mL. Moreover, the relative standard deviations (RSD) of the stability within and between batches were 0.98% and 3.9%, respectively. In addition, the proposed sensor showed high sensitivity, selectivity and stability towards SE in sheep feces samples with satisfactory results. In summary, the excellent ECL efficiency of Ir\u2013NCDs demonstrates the prospects for Ir(III) complexes in bioanalytical applications.",

            "text": "Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is the luminescent emission resulting from highly exergonic electron transfer reactions between electrochemically generated oxidised and reduced species in the vicinity of the electrode surface [1]. ECL has some significant advantages; for example, no external light source is required, so the optical background noise is extremely low, and the sensitivity is very high. ECL has become a very powerful detection technique for a wide range of bio-related species via the ability to use ECL luminophores as labels in antibody/antigen or nucleic acid assays [2,3]. As a result, the technique has been widely used in the areas of clinical diagnostics, and life science research [4]. Recently, iridium(III) complexes have been investigated as alternative ECL reagents to the commonly employed ruthenium(II) complexes, due to various advantageous properties such as high photoluminescence efficiency, easily tuned emission colour, and large stokes shifts [5,6]. It was reported that (pq)2Ir(acac) showed greater ECL intensity than Ru(bpy)32+ with tri-n-propylamine (TPA) co-reactant under optimum conditions (pq = 2-phenylquinoline anion, acac = acetylacetonate anion) [7]. However, their application in bio-assays has been limited due to their poor aqueous solubility and the limited availability of derivatives with bio-conjugatable ligands. The in-depth studies of cyclometalated iridium (III) complexes and their application in bioassays are still a challenge. To address these challenges, the research focus has been devoted to synthesizing cyclometalated iridium(III) complex-based materials with higher ECL efficiency and water\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 459. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13040459 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 459 2 of 11\nsolubility, which is often accomplished by functionalizing their ancillary ligands using hydrophilic groups or by doping the iridium complex into a nanomaterial. For example, Li et al. have reported that [(ppy)Ir(dcbpy)+]PF6 can be applied for detection of cancer cells due to its water-solubility, enabled by the addition of a carboxyl substituted ancillary ligand [8]. Kerr et al., has synthesized water soluble Ir(III) complexes via functionalizing ligands with methylsulfonate or tetraethylene glycol groups [9]. Li et al., reported that water-soluble iridium(III) diimine complexes with appended sugar moieties can be used as efficient ECL luminophores for detection of antibiotics [10]. These characteristics help to improve the detection sensitivity of the ECL method. However, the synthetic process is complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, Liang et al. synthesized water-soluble nanoparticle by encapsulating Ir(III) complexes into organosilica nanoparticles [11]; however, the low emission intensity of the embedded Ir(III) complexes limited their further application. Employing apoferritin as a host, a water-soluble iridium complex-based bioprobe with strong ECL emission was designed by Yang\u2019s group through encapsulating factris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) complexes [Ir(ppy)3] in the apoferritin (apoFt) cavity [12]. Chen\u2019s group prepared water-soluble Ir nanorods (Ir NRs) via carboxyl-functionalization of tris (2-phenylpyridine) iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3); the Ir nanorods were applied as anodic emitters for detecting organophosphorus pesticides [13]. However, despite these advances, the development of Ir(III) complexes for biosensing in the ECL field remains in its infancy. Salmonellosis enteritidis, caused by Salmonella enterica (SE), is a food-borne pathogeninduced disease that poses a significant public health burden. The gut of various domestic and wild animals is the natural host for this pathogen [14,15]. Statistically, 70~80% of bacterial food poisoning in domestic situations is caused by salmonella [16,17]. Once animal products containing a large amount of salmonella (105~106 CFU/g) are digested by people, bacterial infection often results, and then food poisoning occurs under the action of toxins, leading to gastroenteritis, typhoid and paratyphoid [18,19]. Meat, eggs and other foods are all highly susceptible to contamination throughout the food supply chain from processing to sale. SE is considered as an important cause of bacterial intestinal disease in humans and livestock [20\u201322]. Therefore, achieving sensitive and accurate detection of SE is of high importance. Various methods including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [23,24], electrochemistry [25], fluorescence [26,27] and electrochemiluminescence [28,29] assays have been explored for detection of SE. Especially the ECL technique has been considered as a superior choice because of its remarkable sensitivity and controllability. To date, there have been no reports regarding Ir(III) complex-based ECL strategies for SE detection. Here, this work firstly prepared water-soluble Ir nanowires with a high luminous efficiency via a covalent linkage between a carboxyl-functionalized iridium complex and NCD, denoted as Ir\u2013NCDs. As shown in Scheme 1A, firstly, nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots were synthesized by a hydrothermal method using L-arginine and ethylenediamine as raw materials. Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots have plentiful amine groups, which enable facile amidation with the carboxyl bearing iridium complex, synthesizing Ir\u2013NCDs nanowires. The Ir\u2013NCDs exhibited superior ECL emission relative to the iridium complex monomer because of the enhanced contribution from NCDs to the ECL of the iridium complex. A novel label-free ECL platform was constructed with Ir\u2013NCDs as the ECL luminophore, with SE selected as the analytical target. As shown in Scheme 1B, the Ir\u2013NCDs nanowires are immobilized on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE), exhibiting efficient ECL. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) was subsequently dropped on the electrode surface to stabilize the film-form of Ir\u2013NCDs and maintain signal stability, followed by glutaraldehyde (GA), allowing facile attachment of the SE antibody to the film surface. In the presence of SE, the antibody specifically recognizes the antigen and forms an antigen\u2013antibody complex, insulating the GCE surface and hindering the electron transport process, thereby quenching the ECL signal. This label-free sensing strategy enabled the simple detection of SE with excellent selectivity and high stability.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 459 3 of 11\nBiosensors 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 12\nthe SE antibody to the film surface.

This mixed solution was then poured into a sealed Teflon lined reaction chamber, and the solution was then heated for 12 h at the programmed temperature of 180 \u25e6C. During the heating process, the color of the solution changes from clear to yellow due to the formation of NCDs. The solution was then filtered using a filter membrane, and the product was further purified by dialysis (membrane cutoff Mw = 2 kDa) to remove the raw material and other products. The NCDs product was dried by freeze-drying and stored in a refrigerator. Ir\u2013NCDs products are obtained by amidation of the carboxyl group of the iridium complex with the amine group of NCDs. The iridium complex is added to the synthetic NCDs solution, and the solution is mixed via ultrasonication until it becomes clear and transparent. EDC/NHS was added to activate the carboxyl group, and then stirred at room temperature for 16 h to obtain an orange-red product. The product is called Ir\u2013NCDs. As a control experiment, Ir complex and NCDs are simply mixed without the addition of EDC/NHS, negating the formation of the Ir\u2013NCDs. This Ir/NCDs mixture is used to compare ECL signals with Ir\u2013NCDs and confirm the ECL enhancement from the nanowire formation. The mass concentration of iridium atoms in the Ir\u2013NCDs was determined by an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP), and the molar concentration of the iridium complex was calculated by a linear regression equation (Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials)."

The high-resolution TEM image indicated a lattice spacing of 0.21 nm (Figure S2), which was consistent with the in-plane lattice spacing of graphene (100 facet).

The EDS mapping analyses were carried out to analyze the surface elements of the nanowires (Figure 1E\u2013I). As anticipated, the characteristic elements of Ir, C, N, and O were visible. The specific position and element distribution at spot 1 and spot 2 are shown in Figure S3. Additionally, the morphology of the iridium monomer in its solid state and solution was characterized by TEM (Figure S4). The iridium complexes formed a crystal structure in the solid state and were spherical in shape in solution, which further confirmed that the iridium complex can form nanowires due to the existent of NCDs. In ddition, the UV-visible and fluorescence spectra wer recorded to further confirm the successful synthesis of Ir\u2212NCDs (Figure S5). The fluorescence spectrum of the Ir\u2212NCDs showed two peaks at 430 and 580 nm, which was consistent with the fluorescence maximum emission wavelengths of NCDs and the Ir complex recorded separately.\n3.2. ECL Performance of Ir\u2212NCDs and Feasibility Study The ECL properties of the iridium monomer, Ir\u2212NCDs (covalent bond) and Ir/NCDs\n(simple mixture) were compared. As shown in Figure 2A, the iridium complex alone exhibits weak ECL emission. After the addition of NCDs to the iridium complex solution, the ECL intensity of Ir/NCDs is nearly two times higher than that of the monomer, and the ECL intensity of Ir\u2212NCDs is further increased to five times that of the iridium complex. These results suggest that the higher ECL efficiency of Ir\u2212NCDs may be attributed to the contribution of the covalently bound NCDs. NCDs are a new type of quantum dots, which are environmentally friendly and contain a large number of amine groups that can be used as a co-reactant reagent with the iridium complex, thereby enhancing its ECL emission. After the amidation reaction, the electron transport distance between NCDs and the iridium complex was shortened, and the ECL intensity of the nanowires was improved significantly. The mechanism of ECL emission is shown in Figure S6.\nThe effect on the ECL of the stepwise construction of the sensor was studied by taking SE as an example. The results are shown in Figure 2B.

Electrochemical Characterization of the Immunosensor To investigate the assembly process of the immunosensor electrochemically, cyclic voltammetry was performed in 0.1 M PBS containing 5.0 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] and 0.1 M KCl. As shown in Figure 3A, a decreased current response was found for Ir\u2212NCDs/PDDA, indicating that the current was suppressed due to the electron-blocking effect of the Ir\u2212NCDs/PDDA layer. After modification with GA, the current signal was further decreased, which is mainly due to the decreased electron transfer of the redox probe on the electrode surface. Weaker peak currents were observed after modifying with Ab. This is due to the successful assembly of the proteins on the electrode, which results in an additional electron-blocking layer of protein. After BSA modification on the electrode, the current value decreases further because BSA blocks the unreacted active sites. After the capture of SE at the electrode surface, a further subsequent decrease in current was observed due to insulting blocking of protein molecules by SE, which illustrates that the immunosensor for detection of SE was successfully constructed. To further confirm the successful assembly of stepwise surface modification on the electrode surface (Figure 3B), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 0.1 M PBS containing 5.0 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] and 0.1 M KCl using a frequency range of 0.1 MHz\u20130.1 Hz, an applied potential of 0.225 V, and an AC amplitude of 5 mV. According to previous reports [31], the equivalent circuit (as shown in the inset), was applied as of model to analyze the EIS spectra. The equivalent circuit included the electrolyte solution resistance Rs, the surface electron transfer resistance Ret, the Warburg impedance Zw and the double layer capacitance Cdl. The diameter of the semicircle of the Nyquist curve reflects the electron transfer resistance (Ret) at the electrode interface.

Optimization of Experimental Conditions To obtain the best performance of the immunosensor, the pH of PBS, scan rate, amount of PDDA and ratio of the nanowires and PDDA, reaction time, and temperature were optimized. The corresponding results are shown in Figure 4. Firstly, the pH of PBS (0.10 M) was optimized. An increasing ECL signal from the Ir\u2212NCDs nanowires was observed with the pH increasing from 5.0\u20137.5. When the pH surpassed 7.5, the ECL signal dropped gradually. Therefore, pH 7.5 was chosen as the optimal pH. The effect of PDDA with different mass fractions (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%) on the ECL signals was studied. As shown in Figure 4B, the ECL signals decreased obviously with the increasing PDDA mass fraction. Therefore, 0.5% was chosen as the optimal mass fraction. As shown in Figure 4C, the ratio of PDDA and Ir\u2212NCDs was also optimized. The responses of ECL signals increased with the ratio of PDDA and Ir\u2212NCDs from 1:3 to 3:1, At the ratio of 1:1 for PDDA and nanowires, the immunosensor achieved the maximum ECL intensity. Therefore, Ir\u2212NCDs:PDDA = 1:1 was determined as the optimum ratio. As shown in Figure 4D, the ECL signal decreased significantly with increasing SE binding time. These results indicate that more SE was specifically bound to Ab as the incubation time increased. When the reaction time reached 60 min, the ECL signal remained stable, indicating that the reaction was basically saturated at 60 min. Therefore, 60 min was selected as the best incubation time. In addition, it can be seen from Figure 4E that the ECL signal also changes with the incubation temperature.

A reliable, sensitive and selective label-free ECL immunosensor based on the Ir\u2013NCDs was proposed for detecting Salmonella enteritidis for the first time. Carbon dots provided an enhanced contribution to the ECL performance of Ir\u2013NCDs due to efficient intramolecular electron transfer processes. The fabricated ECL immunosensor was constructed through a specific assembly between antigens and antibodies. The immunosensor has sufficient stability and selectivity for determination of SE with a detection limit as low as 102 CFU/mL. Therefore, the immunosensor is expected to provide a new method for preparing a novel ECL luminophore and expanding the application of iridium complexes in bio-related analysis.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bios13040459/s1, Figure S1: Quantitative analysis of Ir\u2013 NCDs by ICP-Ms Measurement.
