It uses back propagation algorithm to solve the structural and complex problems of big data, so that the machine itself can change the data to represent each data. Layers, deep convolutional networks, and recurrent networks have all achieved great breakthroughs under the influence of deep learning [1]. Deep learning is applied to artificial neural networks, in which pattern recognition and machine learning have won major competitions. The biggest difference between deep learning and shallow learning is the depth of their credit paths, and they learn through these paths. The causal link between deep, unsupervised learning is widely spread in high-tech [2]. Deep learning algorithms still need to be continuously updated. In the update, great success has been achieved in several fields of vision and language. These algorithms have been able to be trained in deep learning models, but how are they trained without supervision? What goes down? Experimental investigations were conducted to this end, with results showing that unsupervised\npretraining steers training to the least attractive regions that support optimal generalization to the training set; evidence from these results supports the interpretation of training [3]. In order to solve the noncoding mutation effect of sequence identification in human genes, a deep learning algorithm framework was developed. This model framework can directly learn the gene sequence code in chromatin, so that the mutation situation can be predicted in advance, and this feature can be used to improve gene: the order of variation [4]. Deep learning is widely used in medicine. It mainly helps some problems in medical images. The depth is constantly improving to improve the functions of many medical machines. The application of deep learning in image anatomy, cell result inspection, and auxiliary diagnosis is reviewed. Basic knowledge provide some directions for future deep learning research [5]. To explore the causal relationship between factors affecting educational satisfaction in order to improve the quality of college music education, and to make recommendations for educational satisfaction by analyzing this causal relationship, the willingness to learn has a positive impact and a negative impact on the learning process, and research shows the need to improve the quality\nHindawi Journal of Environmental and Public Health Volume 2022, Article ID 6593850, 9 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6593850\nRE TR AC TE D of college music education by creating an educational environment that promotes motivation and immersion in learning, thereby increasing student satisfaction with education [6]. The colonial nature of music education in Nigerian universities is a serious issue, and he uses the framework of polycolonialism to see the Nigerian higher education system as a historical and contemporary relic of colonialism, where Nigerian universities are engaged in the production of musical knowledge. It is based on information from academic sources that must be critiqued, questioned, transformed, revised as needed, and studied in context, context, and comparison, and it has been suggested that decolonization of academic music education in any society implies a focus on creating, understanding, and sharing musical knowledge of diversity and affiliation [7]. College music education is closely related to culture. It is an important cultural heritage carrier of human beings, carrying the essence of human civilization. Our broad and profound national culture is the treasure house of Chinese culture. Education and cultural heritage go hand in hand. University music education is an important means to popularize ethnic music culture, and conservatories are the main link of ethnic music culture. Finally, the importance and role of ethnic music culture in the popularization of music in higher education are proposed, and specific implementation methods and means are proposed [8]. In order to study issues such as university music education, an in-depth look at several university music institutions in France, the UK, Poland, and other European countries, although similar institutions in the former Yugoslav capital deal with the same topics as the Zagreb Academy of Music, here, the other EU countries mentioned have well-organized university-level music institutions, only one, thus becoming one of the most important institutions of the Zagreb Academy of Music [9]. University music education is an important part of quality education in public universities. Based on the current development status of music education in many domestic colleges and universities, the relevant achievements of higher education in my country are sorted out, the shortcomings and roots of music education in colleges and universities are analyzed, and corresponding measures are put forward. The countermeasures and suggestions put forward concrete solutions [10]. Substance nonadherence is a very serious problem in public mental health, and numerous studies have been carried out on it. Using information on patterns, screening programs that identify those most likely to be nonadherent in this population may be more effective [11]. DBT can be well used to treat BPD patients in public mental health, and we propose a long-term experimental comparative study of six months versus only four days of treatment in hospital settings and in public mental health settings. It is a very good approach to provide DBT therapy to patients [12]. There are many models of public mental health services in the United States, and it has been suggested that analyzing the different patterns of inpatient and outpatient mental health service use among Asian Americans may shed light on the reasons for their widespread overuse; in particular, despite many studies showing that Asian Americans tend to underutilize mental health services, this study identifies racial differences between groups and subgroups using inpatient and outpatient mental health services and mental health referral resources and discusses their impact: these findings of clinical and research findings [13]. There is a survey of 50 people in Australia with public mental health problems, their average age is in their 30s, most patients are unmarried and unemployed, schizophrenia is common and expensive to treat, such records can help the healthcare system identify patients in this subgroup and guide management strategies for these often disadvantaged and disadvantaged patients [14]. Public mental health includes promoting mental health, preventing mental disorders and suicide, reducing mental health inequalities, and managing and organizing mental health services. Modern mental health public policy aims to improve mental health by influencing mental health determinants in all areas of public policy. The stigma of mental disorders is a pervasive phenomenon that creates barriers to seeking care and developing health services and has become an important issue in the public health response [15]."

            "text": "2.1. Definition of Deep Learning.Most modern deep learning models use neural networks. Cumulative neural networks, although they may consist of propositions or hidden variables, arranged hierarchically in deep genomic models, such as in deep learning. Each level of training changes a certain input type. Aggregate and abstract inputs in image recognition applications, the last one can design the shape of a human face. The caveat is that in deep learning, you will find which level the function is best suited for. The \u201cdepth\u201d in \u201cdeep learning\u201d refers to the number of levels of data transformation. In particular, the deep learning system is very deep in the credit allocation roadmap (CAP); for this network, the signal can pass through a layer multiple times, and the depth of the CAP can be unlimited. And there is no generally accepted depth threshold that differentiates surface learning from deep learning. Most researchers agree that WTPdepth > 2; in deep learning, a CAP depth of 2 is considered a general approximation since it can simulate any function. That is, more layers do not increase the network capacity of WTP. Deep models (CAP > 2) estimate features that can have more features than flat versions. Therefore, additional layers help to study properties. Deep learning architectures are often built using a layered approach, and deep learning can help you understand these abstractions and identify features that can improve efficiency. For supervised learning problems, deep learning works by transforming the data into a compact intermediary representation similar to the parent component and removing redundant representations, which is a significant advantage since unlabeled data contains more information than labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained without supervision include neural history and deep belief networks."

Students casually accept and please both and get information about scars when it does not matter when they get and get. Such a review results in memorizing exam prep exercises in a short amount of time, which does not help, and facilitates long-term understanding and retention of knowledge and information that students forget immediately after class. Superficial learners need external forces to stimulate learning. Often, grading, passing, and conferring degrees are usually done to facilitate student learning. The purpose of learning is not to fail or fail an exam. Students are only interested in the knowledge content of the next exam. Deep learning means that students can critically learn and incorporate new concepts and facts, into raw mental structures, by making connections between disparate ideas and integrating existing ones, mechanically compared to surface learning and passively acquire knowledge and store data separately. Deep learning emphasizes active and critical learning of learners. The learner must understand the full meaning of the content, including the connections between the content and with other topics and ideas, as seen by the definition of deep learning, which involves critical reflection and avoidance of passive acquisi-\ntion of knowledge, including integrating what students develop. The information needed is also lifelong learning. In terms of time and space outside the school, after various restrictions, everyone\u2019s demand for deep learning will be stronger.\n2.3. Applications of Deep Learning. Automatic speech recognition is the first and most interesting success case of deep learning, and LSTM neural network can learn tasks. In \u201cextremely deep learning\u201d at intervals of seconds, speech events are separated by thousands of discrete time steps. One of them is about 10ms. LSTMs with forget filters are comparable to task-based speech recognition. According to TIMIT, the initial success of speech recognition was only a small recognition task. Image recognition is as follows: like TIMIT, its small size allows users to try multiple configurations. There is a list of all the results of this collection, which first appeared in 2011, and the vehicle can perform multifaceted rotation monitoring after adding deep learning. Visual art processing is as follows: increasing the use of deep learning methods in various visual arts, closely related to the advancement of image recognition, the proven DNN function can generate engaging images based on random visual input fields and provide an interesting browsing experience. Natural language processing is as follows: neural networks have been used for language modeling since the early 2000s. LSTMs have helped improve machine translation and language modeling. Other techniques in this area include word sampling and word embedding. This can be seen as a layer of representation in deep learning architectures, representing positions as points in vector space relative to other elements in the dataset. Medical image analysis is as follows: deep learning provides results comparable to other methods. In medical applications such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation, and image improvement, mobile advertising is as follows: finding the right mobile audience for mobile advertising is always a challenge. This is because many data points need to be validated and processed before an ad server can be created and used. Use audiences to serve ads. Image restoration is as follows: deep learning can solve image problems such as distortion, high resolution, color correction, and film color correction. These applications include training methods such as field reduction for efficient retrieval of training images on image datasets and enhanced depth-of-field reproduction on newly created images.\n2.4. The Relationship between Deep Learning and the Human Cognitive Domain and Brain. Deep learning is closely related to a class of brain development theories proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s and adopted as\nTable 1: University music education.\nProblems with college music education Features Teaching methods\nCultivating students\u2019 minds Listen and learn To enable students to master music knowledge\nExercise learning and creativity Through sports and games Improve students\u2019 interest in music\nPositively influence their worldview Promote students\u2019 self-creation Deepen students\u2019 love of music\nRE TR AC\nTE D\ncomputer models. Making them the precursors to deep learning systems, these developmental models are generally characterized by the self-organization of available support in the brain for various learning dynamics. It is like neural networks used in deep learning models, and neocortical neural networks use a hierarchy of filters, where each layer processes data from the previous layer and redirects its output to another layer. This process produces a self-organizing stack of sensors that can easily adapt to the work environment, so-called trophic factor waves, where different regions of the brain connect in tandem, with one layer of tissue maturing before another. Wait until the whole brain is fully grown using various methods. On the other hand, to test the viability of deep learning models from a neuroscience perspective, we identified variables. In the inverse diffusion algorithm, which improves the processing realism, other researchers believed that unsupervised deep learning models such as hierarchical phylogenetic models and deep belief networks can estimate biological reality. In this context, neural network models have been linked to model-driven neural processing data in the cerebral cortex; although, there are no systematic comparisons between the organization of the human brain and deep neural encoding and similar reports, for example, that computations done by deep learning modules can be like real neurons and populations of neurons, and that deep learning models developed perform similarly to real neurons by showing the primate visual system measured at the individual and population levels."

The purpose of grouping is to group objects with similar properties. The data collected is unlabeled in most cases, and grouping can separate the data into different groups, the more similar the data within each group. And the data between groups is unique, and most grouping algorithms belong to partition-based grouping, density-based clustering from tables, density-based clustering, and instance clustering that are one of the most common techniques in traditional machine learning algorithms. Cluster analysis is popular for its usefulness, simple, and efficient. It has been successfully used in many fields such as document synthesis. In this study, we chose a K-means clustering algorithm to separate the number of meals and entropy of students. The algorithm is a partition-based grouping algorithm. It has the advantages of good efficiency, easy to understand, and fast calculation speed. The main idea of the K-mean clustering algorithm is as follows: first, a database is designed, k sample points are randomly selected from a database and take it as the center of the cluster, and the calculation formula is\nd x, Ci\u00f0 \u00de = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u3020 m\nj=1 xj \u2212 cij \u00c0 \u00c12\nvuut : \u00f01\u00de\nAbove, x is the data, Ci is the i-th cluster center, and m is their dimension. The error analysis and SSE calculation formula for this database are as follows:\nSSE = \u3020 k\ni=1 \u3020 x\u2208ci d x, ci\u00f0 \u00dej j2: \u00f02\u00de\nIn formula (2) \u2211ki=1\u2211x\u2208ci indicates that the data in SSE can be randomly selected from 1 to n, jd\u00f0x, ci\u00dej2 indicates that the data objects in the public mental health database extract a cluster center to the SSE for calculation and arrange the calculated SSE values neatly one by one to see if there are obvious wrong data values, if not, put all their values.

The problem of health is that the splitting of data is carried out on the information entropy, and then it is a mathematical formula:\nEntropy D\u00f0 \u00de = \u2212\u3020 m\ni=1 pi log2pi: \u00f03\u00de\nIf the attribute a in the public mental health database is\ndivided, the value of a may have\nV = a1, a2, a3,\u22ef,av \u00c8 \u00c9 : \u00f04\u00de\nBy discussing and calculating a with formula (3), the information gain of D in the public mental health database can be obtained: by discussing and calculating a with formula (3), the information gain of D in the public mental health database can be obtained:\nGain D, a\u00f0 \u00de = Entropy D\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 \u3020 V\nV=1\nDvj j D\nEntropy DV \u00c0 \u00c1 : \u00f05\u00de\nHowever, information gain likes more useful information value. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the famous C4.5 algorithm is proposed, which uses retrieval speed when selecting attributes, and the calculation formula is as follows. The detailed process of attribute selection is as follows: calculated attribute library. Choose a high level of gain. Then, choose the maximum gain division of these properties:\nGain ratio D, a\u00f0 \u00de = Gain D, a\u00f0 \u00deSI a\u00f0 \u00de : \u00f06\u00de\nIn\nSI a\u00f0 \u00de = \u2212\u3020 V\nv=1\nDV\nD log2 DV D , \u00f07\u00de\nthe CART algorithm uses the Gini index to select the most appropriate analytical properties and is faster to compute than to compile. The purity of the public mental health database D can be measured by the Gini index, and the calculation formula is shown in formula (8):\nGini D\u00f0 \u00de = 1\u2010\u3020 n\ni=1 p2i : \u00f08\u00de\nEquation (8) is expressed as the Gini index, which is used in the model to select the best analytical attribute value in the public mental health database. It is very high, this algorithm is very simple and easy to understand, and it is very consistent with the optimal properties of judgment data.\nThe concept of the algorithm is very simple, easy to understand, and easy to extract. Target data and digital information can be processed in a way that does not consider information and can handle external features, but also has the disadvantage of being easily overloaded. Second, it is easy to ignore the relationship between features.\n3.2. Optimizing the Public Mental Health Model. A single decision tree classifier for accuracy and diversity is prone to overload, and unstable classifiers lead to classification problems. Gradient boosted tree algorithms fill these gaps, and the final base classifier is generated to reduce the loss\nTable 3: Comparison of public mental health algorithms and models.\nCompliance Speed (1-10) Safety performance\nExcellent 8 High\nGood 6 Generally\nGood 5 Good\nGood 7 Good\nGood 7 Medium\nQualified 5 Generally\nRE TR\nAC TE D\ncaused by the old base classifier. The loss reduction process includes reducing the residual of the previous weak classifier in the gradient direction and the subsequent accumulation of the weak classifier to obtain a strong classifier. Its basic principles are as follows: Input: loss function L and public mental health model database: T = x1, y1\u00f0 \u00de, x2, y2\u00f0 \u00de,\u22ef, xm, ym\u00f0 \u00de,f g: \u00f09\u00de Output: additive model: \u0302f x\u00f0 \u00de = f M x\u00f0 \u00de \u00f010\u00de\nThe classifier at the beginning:\nf0 x\u00f0 \u00de = arg min\u03b3 \u3020 N\ni=1 L yi, \u03b3\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f011\u00de\nThese classifiers need to perform the following steps:\n(1) According to L, get the negative gradient in each database and use it as an estimated value:\nrim = \u2212 \u2202L y1, f xi\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n\u2202, f xi\u00f0 \u00de\n: \u00f012\u00de\n(2) Build a regression tree and get its leaf nodes Rmj, j = 1, 2,\u22ef, J , j. These leaves are quite the type of public mental health\n(3) Compute node leaves:\ncmj = arg minc \u3020 xi\u2208Rmj L yi, f m\u22121 xi + c\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f013\u00de\nFormula (13) is the function of calculating the leaves of nodes. It plays the role of branches in the system. The whole system is like a tree, and the type of public mental health is the branches and leaves of this big tree. It clearly shows the complexity and diversity of public mental health types, and using the form of leaves as a metaphor for psychological types can be very good for classification and statistics. All leaves on a tree trunk will be of the same type, and the same method can be used. To solve it, the complexity of the system is solved virtually, and the response speed of the system is improved.\n(4) Update the regression tree\nf m x\u00f0 \u00de = f m\u22121 x\u00f0 \u00de + \u3020 J\nj=1 cmjI x \u2208 Rmj\n\u00c0 \u00c1 : \u00f014\u00de\nOutput gradient boosting tree:\n\u0302f x\u00f0 \u00de = f m x\u00f0 \u00de + f M x\u00f0 \u00de \u00f015\u00de\nThe gradient boosting tree algorithm is generated based on the result of the previous tree, which can ensure the continuity of the object. There are many nonlinear transformations, which are very helpful for object transformation and the creation of multidimensional objects. In addition, the slope gradient tree overcomes the tendency of decision trees. It will be excessive, and it is not easy to produce outliers.\n3.3. Extract Scoring of Data. Filtering evaluates each attribute based on its difference or relevance. And select properties based on preset criteria or selected number of properties. The following are some popular filtering process algorithms, where the variance selection method selects objects based on the difference between each object and its target and the correlation coefficient method, the chi-square test, and the maximum data coefficient law for properties and objectives.\nThe variance selection method is used to express the degree of deviation of the random variable from the expected value. When using the variance selection method, the variance of each subject is first calculated using the variance formula, and vice versa, according to different needs analysis. Different standard selection rules are defined, and"

First, use the correlation coefficient formula to calculate the correlation coefficient for each target geographic feature; second, calculate the P value for the correlation coefficient. The P value is calculated based on the feature selection target value.

Evaluation Indicators. In order to obtain the public mental health assessment, we use the accuracy rate T and the false positive rate F as the evaluation indicators for the model we created.\nThe function expression of the accuracy rate T and the false positive rate F is as follows:\nT = A B \u00d7 100%, \u00f021\u00de\nFij = W H \u00d7 100%: \u00f022\u00de\nFinally, the values obtained by formula (21) and formula (22) are analyzed to summarize the result analysis:\nZ = T + Fij \u00c0 \u00c12 + ln zc: \u00f023\u00de\nEquation (23) evaluates the entire model. The range of evaluation is very wide. It is the final evaluation function of the system. It combines the previous accuracy rate T with the false positive rate F and randomly adds a new evaluation factor. This new factor is the opinion of the model, and the purpose of this is to make the model more humanized. If the overall result of Z is greater than 1, this indicates that this set of evaluation indicators gives a good evaluation in this model. If the overall result of Z is less than 1, then it shows that this set of evaluation indicators gives a bad evaluation in this model.\nThere are still many areas for improvement in this evaluation system, and we will continue to work hard to improve it in the future.\nTo analyze the correlation between college music education and public mental health based on deep learning, the public mental health model, clustering algorithm, and filtering algorithm are used. This model has a complete system, which records the information of public mental health into the database. There is also model optimization technology. Even a little error is normal. After all, there are too many factors to be considered in the system. With the continuous development of public mental health, the psychological characteristics and cognitive characteristics generated by this will also be constantly changing and updating, and the system saves these data in each area and solves them slowly."

The driving force of social development has entered a new era and must use a variety of abilities to face this situation. Colleges and universities need to expand music education in a diversified direction. At this time, deep learning is introduced to change the university music education model, cultivate versatile university students, and improve the competition in the labor market to enable them to participate in social and economic development. Through the survey, the relevant content of college music education was obtained, and the data are shown in Table 1.\nAccording to the data in Table 1, there are still some unresolved problems in college music education, but the existing education methods can allow students to absorb the knowledge of music education. In response to these problems, my country has increased investment in college education in recent years, using money to invest in it and then adopting the deep learning model to slowly change the status quo of college music education. The following data chart is the amount of investment in recent years and the changes in the direction and direction of college music education reform after investment.\nAccording to the data shown in Figure 1, we can see that my country\u2019s investment in college music education is increasing, which shows that my country attaches great importance to the education of music. By 2021, my country\u2019s total investment will reach 3.7 billion yuan. Among them, it is the highest. On the contrary, after the decline and rise of classical music, there is basically no change. My country\u2019s famous music still needs to be constantly updated. Compared with popular music, it is not very popular among young people.\nAccording to the data in Figures 1 and 2, my country\u2019s investment in college music education has increased every year, but this increased amount is not a blind investment but a selective increase in the amount invested in this amount. During the changes, the direction of change in university music education is also different, but in Figure 2, their totality is also rising again. In addition, compared with the previous shallow music learning, there are many benefits of deep music learning.\nAccording to the data in Table 2, it can be known that deep music learning is obviously better than shallow learning. Deep learning can change the attitude of students who do not accept music knowledge and turn them into active learning by themselves. Finally, we specifically investigated a university in our country, hoping to get more useful information from this.\nIn Figure 3, we can see that both boys and girls have chosen two activities: concert and musical instrument experience class. These are the two most helpful activities for music, and they are the most popular in their universities. Then we investigated them for the purpose of learning music, and we were very satisfied with the final result. Most of them were motivated by interest and wanted to learn music from their hearts.\nAccording to the data in Figures 3 and 4, no less than 55% of the students chose the concert, and nearly 40% of\nthe students chose the musical instrument experience category. While the percentage of lectures and seminars is relatively low, it can be seen from the data in Figure 4 that students often like to listen to concerts, which can also provide a good aesthetic experience, and they are also particularly interested in musical instrument courses. In Figure 5, 90% of the surveyed students choose music class because of their interest. No matter what the reason is, since they choose music class, it shows that they have a certain favorable impression of music."

Although the data presented by the algorithm is mediocre, however, each has its own characteristics and is sufficient for various operations in the model. There are many problems in public mental health, most of which are listed in Table 4.\nAccording to the data in Table 4, public mental health problems are becoming more and more serious. Anxiety is the most serious problem at present, and the lowest is psychological imbalance. Therefore, we need to solve the problem of people\u2019s anxiety and anxiety in a targeted manner, analyze the source of anxiety, and then resolve. For such a serious public mental health problem, we introduce deep learning to optimize and change this phenomenon and discuss and analyze the differences between different household registrations and different genders.\nPublic mental health has a great influence on people\u2019s environment. For example, in Figure 5, it can be clearly seen that there is a big difference in public mental health between people with rural hukou and those with urban hukou, followed by males and females. There are also differences between them. Men\u2019s mental health problems are lower than women\u2019s. This should be related to the reason why men\u2019s psychological pressure is greater than that of women. Finally, after they accept deep learning, their public mental health problems are declining, even in my country of public mental health problems has dropped to a global low, which indirectly illustrates the powerful role deep learning has played in it.\nAccording to the data in Figures 5 and 6, before deep learning was carried out, the public mental health types of the experimental subjects in the two figures were not optimistic. After deep learning, it can be clearly seen from the data that the public mental health level has changed. The psychological endurance of men is stronger than that of women, and people with urban hukou are better than those in rural areas. After deep learning is implemented in my country, the proportion of public mental health personnel in my country has dropped significantly. Our situation has improved markedly in other countries.\nRE TR AC TE D\nFrom the data in Figure 7, all types in my country are lower than other countries, which also reflects the key role of deep learning in it.

Regarding the problems of university music education and public mental health, we still need to continue to improve. A little research today is not enough to deal with the various problems that will arise in the future. We must continue to study in order to better go forward in the future.\nWith the continuous changes of university music education and public mental health problems, conventional solutions are no longer sufficient. At this time, we have adopted a method based on deep learning to study them and solve the current situation of university music education. After the frequent occurrence of mental health problems, an in-depth discussion of both of them aims to teach students that they can deeply understand the charm of music and fall in love with music and hope that they can develop in many aspects in their university life. Afterwards, efforts should be made to reduce the proportion of people with public mental health.\nData Availability\nThe experimental data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest regarding this work."
