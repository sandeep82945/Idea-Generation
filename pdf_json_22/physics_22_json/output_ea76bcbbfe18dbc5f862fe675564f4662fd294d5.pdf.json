            "text": "In this paper, we study the phenomenon of bulk-interface correspondence, whereby the interface between two distinct spectrally-gapped one-dimensional materials necessarily hosts a robust localized mode in the spectral gap. This is analyzed in both lattice and continuum models. Such modes arise from the interplay between two \u201cdistinct phases\u201d pieced together along an interface. They have many applications in the localization and transportation of wave energy and are extensively studied in the fields of photonics and phononics [17, 24].\nThe prototype was introduced by Su\u2013Schreiffer\u2013Heeger in their seminal work on polyacetylene polymer chains [29], in which an alternating sequence of single bonds and double bonds occurs on one side of a domain wall, while the reverse sequence occurs on the other side (see Eq. (3.15) for a sketch). The similarly influential domain-wall Dirac Hamiltonian, considered in [15, 16], has a \u201cmass term\u201d with differing signs on either side of the wall. Both were argued to have zero-energy localized solutions, without explicit use of topology or index theory ideas.\nFrom a modern perspective, we may label the possible \u201cbulk phases\u201d of a 1D material by suitable topological invariants (e.g. a quantized Zak phase [35], or the sign of a nonzero mass term). A subtle but crucial point is that only the difference of such invariants has unambiguous meaning [30], so it is the manner in which two systems are pieced together along an interface which determines the unambiguous \u201ctopological non-triviality\u201d of the combined system. For example, in generic dislocation models, such non-triviality is automatic from our Lemma 3.4, and will generally lead to an interface mode (Prop. 2.8, Theorem 3.7); no explicit calculation of the rather abstract (relative) topological invariant on either side of the interface is necessary.\nIndeed, in [15, 16, 29], one had two possible degenerate ground states, neither of which is preferred, but one or the other must be locally picked out under spontaneous breaking of a reflection symmetry. Likewise, for half-space continuum models, reflection symmetry and the choice of reflection plane for the boundary termination (for the same bulk Hamiltonian), play key roles for the existence of edge states, as has been known for a long time [34].\nIn recent literature, the bulk-edge correspondence for two-dimensional materials occupying a half-space has gained in mathematical precision and generality. For lattice models, see,\ne.g., [10, 12, 13], as well as [5, 19, 25] for the disordered case, and [31] for general boundary geometries; For continuum models, see, e.g., [4] for Dirac Hamiltonians, [8] for quantum Hall Hamiltonians, and [20] for general Riemannian surfaces. To obtain a similar result for onedimensional half-space lattice models, one has to impose a very restrictive \u201cchiral/sublattice symmetry\u201d assumption; see, e.g., [22] and \u00a72.3 of [25]. This latter correspondence is really the classical index theorem for Toeplitz operators in disguise, recalled in Section 3.1.\nThe interface mode problem, which is our actual focus, requires a more careful treatment of \u201ctopological invariants\u201d. Once clarified, we obtain a quick index-theoretic proof that the SSH interface model hosts an interface mode (Prop. 3.6), provided chiral symmetry holds. The interface mode of the domain-wall Dirac Hamiltonian can also be deduced from the Callias index formula [6]. However, these methods may be unsatisfactory because actual materials are more realistically modelled with differential operators without strict chiral symmetry. In this setting, the nature of their interface modes has recently attracted mathematical attention, e.g., [9, 11]. See also [1, 2] for phononic materials made of high contrast resonating bubbles.\nOutline and main results. This paper is split into two main parts, which may be read independently and in any order. The first part, Section 2, concerns inversion symmetric continuum models, Eq. (2.1), describing photonic structures (these are defined on real function spaces). If there is a spectral gap, we can define a \u00b1-valued bulk index, closely related to a quantized Zak phase. Our main result is that the interface of two gapped materials with different bulk indices will have exactly one in-gap interface mode (Theorem 2.7). This constitutes a bulk-interface correspondence.\nThe second part, Section 3, concerns inversion symmetric lattice models, defined over the reals. We explain how an auxiliary sublattice operator appears, and therefore a notion of approximate chiral symmetry. In Section 3 D, we clarify the relationship between various bulk indices used in the literature, and focus on the quantized Zak phase. As explained in Section 3 F, only relative Zak phases have well-defined meanings, and this motivates the interface model in Section 3 G, which has the SSH model as a special case. Our main results are: a bulk-edge correspondence, Theorem 3.3, and a bulk-interface correspondence, Theorem 3.7. These hold as long as the strictly nearest-neighbour terms dominate, but may be false otherwise.\nFinally, in Section 4, we discuss some differences between continuum and lattice models,\nas well as the outlook for future work."

Also, L is time-reversal symmetric in the sense that it commutes with the operation of complex conjugation.\nSuch operators were investigated in [33] and [21]. It was shown that a localized mode exists at the interface of two semi-infinite periodic structures with different bulk topological indices. We shall improve the argument in [21] and derive a stronger bulk-interface correspondence result that is able to characterize precisely the number of interface modes. The new argument is self-contained, and does not rely on the transfer matrix technique or the oscillatory theory of Sturm\u2013Liouville systems."

            "text": "We first recall some facts about the spectrum of the periodic ordinary differential operator L, and the regularity of its solutions. For each real-valued E, by the standard regularity theory of ODEs, we know that the solutions to the equation (L \u2212 E)u = 0 are absolutely continuous in R. Moreover, the function u \u2032(x) \u00b5(x) is also absolutely continuous. Here and throughout, we use the notation u\u2032(\u00b7) to denote the derivative of u with respect to the variable x. At a point of discontinuity of \u00b5, say x = x0, we interpret the value 1\n\u00b5(x0) u\u2032(x0)\nas either the left-sided limit limx\u2192x\u22120 1 \u00b5(x) u\u2032(x) or the right-sided limit 1 limx\u2192x+0 1 \u00b5(x) u\u2032(x). The two one-sided limits are equal by the regularity of the solution u(x). For ease of notation, we use the notation 1 \u00b5(x0) u\u2032(x0) for either of the two one-sided limits in subsequent analysis.\nThe spectrum of the operator L can be analyzed using the standard Floquet\u2013Bloch theory. Let B = [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] be the Brillouin zone and [0, \u03c0] be the reduced Brillouin zone. Denote by AC[0, 1] the space of absolutely continuous functions defined on [0, 1]. For each Bloch wavenumber k \u2208 B, we consider the following one-parameter family of Floquet\u2013Bloch eigenvalue problems,\nL\u03c8(x) = E\u03c8(x) x \u2208 [0, 1], (2.2)\nin the function space\nVk =\n{ u \u2208 AC[0, 1] : u(1) = eiku(0), u \u2032\n\u00b5 \u2208 AC[0, 1], u\n\u2032(1)\n\u00b5(1) = eik\nu\u2032(0) \u00b5(0)\n} .\nequipped with the following inner product\n(u, v) = \u222b 1 0 \u03b5(x)u\u0304(x)v(x)dx. (2.3)\nHere and throughout, u\u0304(x) denotes the complex conjugate of u(x). It is easy to check that for each k \u2208 B, the eigenvalue problem (2.2) is self-adjoint and attains a discrete set of real eigenvalues with finite multiplicity,\nE1(k) \u2264 E2(k) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Ej(k) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nWe have the following properties of the function Ej(k), also called the dispersion relation of the j-th spectral band. See [21, 26] for proof.\nLemma 2.1 (1) The function Ej(k) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to k \u2208 B.\n(2) Ej(k) = Ej(\u2212k) holds for each k \u2208 B. Moreover, Ej(k) can be extended to a periodic\nfunction in k with period 2\u03c0, i.e. Ej(k) = Ej(k + 2\u03c0).\n(3) Ej(k) are strictly monotonic on each of the half Brillouin zones (\u2212\u03c0, 0) and (0, \u03c0).\nFor each j \u2265 1, we define the band edges to be\nE\u2212j = min{Ej(k) : k \u2208 B}, E+j = max{Ej(k) : k \u2208 B}.\nThen the entire spectrum of the operator L on L2(R) is given by\n\u03c3(L) = \u22c3 j\u22651 [E\u2212j , E + j ],\nand corresponds to the essential spectrum of the operator. Moreover, L has no point spectrum.\nIf E+j < E \u2212 j+1, the spectrum contains a band gap between the j-th and (j + 1)-th bands. Note that by the monotonicity in Lemma 2.1, the band edges E+j , E \u2212 j occur at either k = 0 or k = \u03c0. Moreover, we have the following result. See Theorem 2.5 in [21] for a proof.\nLemma 2.2 For each j \u2265 1, we have either\nE+j = Ej(0), E \u2212 j+1 = Ej+1(0),\nor\nE+j = Ej(\u03c0), E \u2212 j+1 = Ej+1(\u03c0).\nNote that the eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue Ej(k) can be extended to a\nfunction on R, through the following formula\nu(x+ 1) = u(x)eikx.\nMoreover, the extended function still satisfies the eigen-equation L\u03c8(x) = E\u03c8(x) for all x \u2208 R. This extended function is called a j-th Bloch eigenfunction (or Bloch mode) and is denoted \u03d5j,k. For ease of notation, we shall use the same symbol for both the L 2[0, 1]- normalizable function, and its (non-normalizable) extended version.\nDefinition 1 We say that a Bloch mode \u03d5j,k has even-parity (odd-parity) if \u03d5j,k is an even (odd) function.\nLemma 2.3 Let L be a periodic operator of the form (2.1). Let E\u2217 be an eigenvalue of the Floquet\u2013Bloch eigenvalue problem of L in Vk=k\u2217 where k\u2217 = 0, or \u03c0. Then the following hold:\n1. The space of Bloch eigenfunctions in Vk=k\u2217 associated with E \u2217 has dimension at most\ntwo. Moreover, the eigenbasis can be chosen to be real-valued functions.\n2. If the above-mentioned dimension is one, then the eigenspace is spanned by a real-valued\nfunction which can be chosen to be either even or odd.\n3. If the above-mentioned dimension is two, then the eigenspace is spanned by two real-\nvalued functions, one of which is even while the other is odd.\nProof. We only prove the Lemma for the case k\u2217 = 0. The case k\u2217 = \u03c0 can be proved similarly.\nProof of (1). We consider the solutions to the second order ordinary differential equation L\u03c8 = E\u2217\u03c8. It is clear that a solution \u03c8 is uniquely determined by \u03c8(0) and \u03c8\u2032(0). Therefore, the space of solutions has dimension at most two. On the other hand, note that if \u03c8 \u2208 Vk=0 solves L\u03c8 = E\u2217\u03c8, then so do the real and imaginary parts of \u03c8. Therefore, the eigenbasis can be chosen to be real-valued functions.\nProof of (2). By (1), we can choose a real-valued eigenfunction \u03c8 that spans the space of Bloch eigenfunctions in Vk=0 associated with E \u2217. Since L is inversion symmetric, it is easy to check that P\u03c8 is also a real-valued eigenfunction in the space of Bloch eigenfunctions in Vk=0 associated with E \u2217. Therefore, we have P\u03c8 = \u00b1\u03c8, from which the claim in (2) follows.\nProof of (3). We first show that the Bloch eigenfunctions of L in Vk=0 associated with the eigenvalue E\u2217 cannot all be even. Otherwise, all the eigenfuntions have vanishing Neumann data and hence are linearly dependent (using the same argument as in (1)). Similarly, the Bloch eigenfunctions cannot all be odd. On the other hand, due to the inversion symmetry of the operator L, the Bloch eigenfunctions can be chosen to be either even or odd. Therefore, we can choose two real-valued functions, with one even and the other odd, such that they span the Bloch eigenspace.\nMotivated by the above Lemma, we introduce the following subspaces of Vk=k\u2217 with k \u2217 = 0\nor \u03c0:\nVk=k\u2217,e = {f \u2208 Vk=k\u2217 : f = Pf}, Vk=k\u2217,o = {f \u2208 Vk=k\u2217 : f = \u2212Pf}.\nIt is clear that Vk=k\u2217 is an orthogonal sum of the two subspaces Vk=k\u2217,e, Vk=k\u2217,o. Moreover, the above Lemma implies that the spectrum of L restricted to Vk=k\u2217 is the union of the spectrum of L restricted to the two subspaces.\nWe are now ready to investigate the change of parity for the Bloch modes at the two extremal points in a band gap. See also [21] for a different proof using the oscillation theory for Sturm\u2013Liouville operators.\nProposition 2.4 Let L be a periodic operator of the form (2.1). Assume that there is a band gap between the j-th and (j + 1)-th bands. Then the Bloch modes at (k\u2217, E+j ) and at (k\u2217, E\u2212j+1) have different parities, where k \u2217 = 0 or \u03c0.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we only prove the case k\u2217 = 0, where the maximum of the j-th band and the minimum of the (j + 1)-th band are attained at k = 0.\nStep 1. We apply a continuous family of perturbations to the operator L such that both time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry are preserved, and that the band gap between the j-th and (j + 1)-th bands can be closed. This can be done by considering the following family of operators Ls with coefficients\n\u03b5s(x) = \u03b5(x) + s(1\u2212 \u03b5(x)), \u00b5s(x) = \u00b5(x) + s(1\u2212 \u00b5(x)), 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1.\nWe denote by s1, the first value of s such that the j-th band gap closes. It is clear that 0 < s1 \u2264 1.\nStep 2. We consider the operator Ls1 . Using Lemma 2.2, we can deduce that the maximum of the j-th band and the minimum of the (j + 1)-th band the family of operators Ls are always attained at k = 0. Let (k = 0, E\u2217) be the touching point of the j-th band and (j + 1)-th band of Ls1 . By Lemma 2.3, E\u2217 is an eigenvalue of Ls1 in both subspaces Vk=k\u2217,e and Vk=k\u2217,o. By Lemma 2.3 again, we see that E \u2217 is a non-degenerate eigenvalue for Ls1 in both subspaces Vk=k\u2217,e and Vk=k\u2217,o.\nStep 3. We consider the eigenvalue problem of Ls in the subspaces Vk=k\u2217,e and Vk=k\u2217,o for s < s1 but close to s1. Using standard perturbation theory for eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators, we see that Ls has two eigenvalues in Vk=k\u2217 ; one is perturbed from E\u2217 in the space Vk=k\u2217,e, and the other from the space Vk=k\u2217,o. Note that the j-th band gap of Ls is open for s < s1. We see that for all s < s1 and sufficiently close to s1, the j-th and (j + 1)-th Bloch modes of Ls at k = k\u2217 have different parities.\nStep 4. Finally, notice that for all 0 < s < s1, the parity of the j-th Bloch mode at k = k \u2217 remains the same, and similarly for the (j + 1)-th Bloch mode. We conclude that the j-th and (j + 1)-th Bloch modes of L at k = k\u2217 have different parities."

            "text": "Let L be an inversion symmetric periodic operator of the form (2.1). Assume that there is a gap between the j-th and (j + 1)-th spectral bands of L, and let E be a real number in the band gap. Recall that the lower edge of the band gap, i.e. the maximum of the j-th band, E+j , is achieved at either k = 0 or \u03c0. With respect to this band gap, we define the following bulk index:\n\u03b3j =: the parity of the Bloch mode at E + j .\nFor L of the form (2.1), we observe that the lowest Bloch eigenvalue is zero and is attained at k = 0 with a constant, thus even, Bloch function. In the event that every spectral band below the j-th one is isolated, we can show that\n\u03b3j = (\u22121)j\u22121ei \u2211j m=1 \u03b8m ,\nwhere \u03b8m is the Zak phase for the m-th isolated band. As explained at the end of Section 3 D, the Zak phase has the following equivalent definition:\n\u03b8m = 0, if \u03d5m,0(x) and \u03d5m,\u03c0(x) attain the same parity,\u03c0, if \u03d5m,0(x) and \u03d5m,\u03c0(x) attain different parities. For the more involved case where the bands below the spectral band gap may cross each other, we refer to [21] for details on how \u03b3j is related to the number of crossings and the Zak phases of the isolated bands (if any).\nC Impedance functions in the band gap\nWe now briefly recall the concept of impedance function (see [21, 33]), which will be used in the proof of the existence of interface modes in the subsequent subsection. It is straightforward to see that for each E in the band gap, all the solutions to the equation\n(L \u2212 E)\u03c8 = 0 with finite L2-norm over the left half-line (\u2212\u221e, 0] span a one-dimensional space. Let \u03c8L,E be one of these solutions. We define the impedance function for the operator L defined over the left half-line to be\n\u03beL(E) := \u03c8L,E(0) 1\n\u00b5(0) \u03c8\u2032L,E(0)\n, if \u03c8\u2032L,E(0) 6= 0.\nIn the case where \u03c8\u2032L,E(0) = 0, \u03c8L,E has a Neumman boundary condition at x = 0 and we set formally \u03beL(E) = \u221e. Note that \u03c8\u2032L,E(0) and \u03c8L,E(0) cannot vanish simultaneously, otherwise \u03c8L,E \u2261 0. Also, \u03beL(E) defined above is independent of the choice of the solution \u03c8L,E. In a similar way, we define the impedance function for the periodic operator L defined on the right half-line [0,\u221e) by\n\u03beR(E) := \u03c8R,E(0) 1\n\u00b5(0) \u03c8\u2032R,E(0)\n.\nwhere \u03c8R,E is a finite L 2-norm solution over the right half-line [0,\u221e).\nWe now derive some useful properties of the impedance functions \u03beL(E), \u03beR(E).\nLemma 2.5 Let the operator L be of the form (2.1). Assume that there is a band gap between the j-th and the (j + 1)-th bands. Then the following hold for E \u2208 (E+j , E\u2212j+1):\n(i) If the Bloch mode at the band gap edge (k\u2217, E+j ) has odd-parity for k \u2217 = 0 or \u03c0,\nthen \u03beR(E) is strictly decreasing, with \u03beR(E) \u2192 0 as E \u2192 E+j and \u03beR(E) \u2192 \u2212\u221e as E \u2192 E\u2212j+1; On the other hand, \u03beL(E) is strictly increasing, with \u03beL(E) \u2192 0 as E \u2192 E+j and \u03beL(E)\u2192 +\u221e as E \u2192 E\u2212j+1.\n(ii) If the Bloch mode at band gap edge (k\u2217, E+j ) has even-parity, then \u03beR(E) is strictly\ndecreasing, with \u03beR(E)\u2192 +\u221e as E \u2192 E+j and \u03beR(E)\u2192 0 as E \u2192 E\u2212j+1; On the other hand, \u03beL(E) is strictly increasing, with \u03beL(E) \u2192 \u2212\u221e as E \u2192 E+j and \u03beL(E) \u2192 0 as E \u2192 E\u2212j+1.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we consider only the case k\u2217 = 0, and odd-parity Bloch mode at (0, E+j ). The proof for the other cases is similar. It also suffices to consider the function \u03beR(E), since \u03beL(E) can be treated similarly. To further simplify the notations, we assume without loss of generality that \u00b5(0) = 1 (\u00b5(x) is necessarily continuous at x = 0 due to the inversion symmetry assumption).\nStep 1. We first construct a smooth family of real-valued L2[0,\u221e) solutions, denoted by uE(x), to the equation (L \u2212 E)u = 0 for E \u2208 (E+j , E\u2212j+1). This can be done since the dimension of L2[0,\u221e) solutions to (L \u2212 E)u = 0 is equal to the constant one. We refer to [21] for a concrete construction. Noting that uE(0) and u \u2032 E(0) cannot be zero simultaneously, we may normalize uE by requiring that uE(0) 2 + u\u2032E(0) 2 = 1. We also note that as E tends to the band gap edges at E+j and at E \u2212 j+1, the function uE tends to the corresponding Bloch modes.\nStep 2. We claim that both uE(0) and u \u2032 E(0) cannot be zero for all E \u2208 (E+j , E\u2212j+1). We only prove that uE(0) 6= 0. The claim that u\u2032E(0) 6= 0 can be proved similarly. We prove by contradiction. Suppose uE(0) = 0 for some E \u2208 (E+j , E\u2212j+1). Using the inversion symmetry of the operator L, we can check that the function u\u0303(x) defined by u\u0303(x) = uE(x) for x > 0 and u\u0303(x) = \u2212uE(\u2212x) for x < 0 satisfies the equation (L \u2212 E)u\u0303 = 0 on the whole real line. Moreover u\u0303 \u2208 L2(R). Therefore, we see that E is a point spectrum of the operator L with eigenfunction u\u0303. This contradicts the fact that L has no point spectrum. This completes the proof of the claim.\nStep 3. By the result in Step 2, we can conclude that \u03beR(E) = uE(0) u\u2032E(0) is well-defined and is smooth for E \u2208 (E+j , E\u2212j+1). Moreover, \u03beR(E) cannot change signs in (E+j , E\u2212j+1). We now show that \u03beR(E) is strictly decreasing for E \u2208 (E+j , E\u2212j+1). Denote vE(x) = \u2202uE(x) \u2202E . By taking the partial derivative with respect to E on both sides of the equation (L\u2212E)uE(x) = 0, we obtain\n(L \u2212 E)vE(x) = uE(x).\nTherefore \u222b \u221e 0 (L \u2212 E)vE(x)\u03b5(x)uE(x)dx = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03b5(x)uE(x) 2dx > 0. Using integration by parts twice and the right decaying property of uE(x), we see that\u222b \u221e 0 (L \u2212 E)vE(x)\u03b5(x)uE(x)dx = \u222b \u221e 0 (L \u2212 E)uE(x)\u03b5(x)vE(x)dx+ v\u2032E(0)uE(0)\u2212 vE(0)u\u2032E(0)\n= v\u2032E(0)uE(0)\u2212 vE(0)u\u2032E(0).\nWe further obtain\nu\u2032E(0) (v \u2032 E(0)\u03beR(E)\u2212 vE(0)) = v\u2032E(0)uE(0)\u2212 vE(0)u\u2032E(0) > 0,\nwhere we used the identity\nuE(0) = \u03beR(E)u \u2032 E(0).\nBy taking partial derivative respect to E on both sides of the above identity, we obtain\nvE(0) = \u03be \u2032 R(E)u \u2032 E(0) + \u03beR(E)v \u2032 E(0).\nTherefore\nu\u2032E(0) (v \u2032 E(0)\u03beR(E)\u2212 vE(0)) = u\u2032E(0) \u00b7 (\u2212\u03be\u2032R(E)u\u2032E(0)) = \u2212(u\u2032E(0))2\u03be\u2032R(E).\nIt follows that \u03be\u2032R(E) < 0 for all E \u2208 (E+j , E\u2212j+1). This completes the proof of the claim.\nStep 4. Finally, using the fact that the Bloch mode at (k\u2217 = 0, E+j ) is odd, we see that\nuE(0)\u2192 0 as E \u2192 E+j . Therefore \u03beR(E) = uE(0) u\u2032E(0) \u2192 0 as E \u2192 E+j . By the result in Step 3, we conclude that \u03beR(E) < 0 for all E \u2208 (E+j , E\u2212j+1). On the other hand, By Proposition 2.4, the Bloch mode at (k\u2217 = 0, E\u2212j+1) is even. Therefore u \u2032 E(0) \u2192 0 as E \u2192 E\u2212j+1 and we can conclude that \u03beR(E)\u2192 \u2212\u221e as E \u2192 E\u2212j+1. This completes the proof of the Lemma.\nD Interface modes induced by bulk topological indices\nWe consider a photonic system that consists of two semi-infinite periodic structures, one for x < 0 and one for x > 0. The corresponding two periodic differential operators are assumed to be of the form (2.1):\nLj\u03c8 = \u2212 1\n\u03b5j(x)\nd\ndx\n( 1\n\u00b5j(x)\nd\u03c8 dx\n) , j = 1, 2.\nThe differential operator for the joint structure is given by\nL\u0303\u03c8(x) := L1\u03c8(x), x < 0,L2\u03c8(x), x > 0. (2.4) We investigate the existence of interface modes for the operator L\u0303. Here an interface\nmode is defined to be a function \u03c8 such that\n\u03c8 \u2208 L2(R) and (L\u0303 \u2212 E)\u03c8 = 0\nfor some real number E. In what follows, we denote the quantities associated with the operator Lj using the superscript j (j = 1, 2), such as the energy level E(j)m , the Bloch mode\n\u03d5 (j) m,k, etc. Before we proceed, we recall a Lemma that uses impedance functions to prove the existence of an interface mode. Its proof is straightforward.

Then there exists an interface mode at energy level E for the operator L\u0303 if and only if\n\u03be (1) L (E) = \u03be (2) R (E).\nWe now are ready to state our main result.\nTheorem 2.7 Assume that the following holds:\n(i) The operators L1 and L2 are of the form (2.1) and attain a common band gap\nI := (E(1),+m1 , E (1),\u2212 m1+1 ) \u2229 (E(2),+m2 , E (2),\u2212 m2+1 ) 6= \u2205\nfor certain positive integers m1 and m2.\n(ii) With respect to this common band gap, the bulk topological indices differ, \u03b3 (1) m1 6= \u03b3 (2) m2.\nThen there exists a unique interface mode for the operator L\u0303 defined in (2.4).\nProof. By Lemma 2.6, there is an interface mode of L\u0303 at energy level E if and only if\n\u03be(E) := \u03be (1) L (E)\u2212 \u03be (2) R (E) = 0.\nWithout loss of generality, we consider the case when the common band gap of the operators L1 and L2 is given by I = (E(1),+m1 , E (1),\u2212 m1+1 ). Moreover, \u03b3 (1) m1 = 1 and \u03b3 (2) m2 = \u22121 for the two operators. Then the Bloch mode \u03d5 (1) m1,k\u2217 at the band gap edge (k\u2217, E (1),+ m1 ), where k \u2217 = 0 or \u03c0, for the operator L1 is even while the Bloch mode \u03d5(2)m2,k\u2217 at the band gap edge (k \u2217, E (2),+ m2 ) for the operator L2 is odd. By Lemma 2.5, \u03be(1)L (E) < 0 and \u03be (1) L (E) \u2192 \u2212\u221e as E \u2192 E (1),+ m1 and \u03be (1) L (E) \u2192 0 as E \u2192 E (1),\u2212 m1+1 respectively. On the other hand, \u03be (2) R (E) < 0 and \u03be (2) R (E) \u2192 0 as E \u2192 E(2),+m2 and \u03be (2) R (E) \u2192 \u2212\u221e as E \u2192 E (2),\u2212 m2+1 respectively. Therefore, for E in the common band gap I, we see that \u03be(E) < 0 for E near E (1),+ m1 and \u03be(E) > 0 for E near E (1),\u2212 m1+1 . Moreover, \u03be(E) is strictly increasing since \u03beL is strictly increasing and \u03beR is strictly decreasing. It follows that there exists a unique root over the interval I for \u03be(E) = 0. See\nfunction \u03be (2) R (E) defined in the interval [E (2),+ m2 , E (2),\u2212 m2+1 ), and the blue curve is that of the\nimpedance function \u03be (1) L (E) defined in the interval (E (1),+ m1 , E (1),\u2212 m1+1 ]. The two curves intersect\nat a unique E \u2208 I =: (E(1),+m1 , E (1),\u2212 m1+1 ) which gives the interface mode\u2019s eigenvalue.\nFig. 1 for an illustration.\nAs an application of the above theorem, we consider a dislocation model.\nProposition 2.8 Let L1 be of the form (2.1). Assume that the spectrum of L1 has a band gap between the j-th and (j+ 1) band. Further assume that the maximum of the j-th spectral band and the minimum of the (j + 1)-th spectral band are achieved at k = \u03c0. Let L2 be the one-half shifted version of L1, in the sense that the corresponding coefficients \u03b52 and \u00b52 are related to those of L1 by\n\u03b52(x) = \u03b51(x\u2212 1/2); \u00b52(x) = \u00b51(x\u2212 1/2).\nThen there exists a unique interface mode in the band gap between the j-th and (j + 1) band for the glued operator L\u0303 as defined in (2.4).\nProof. It is clear that the spectrum of L1 and L2 have the same band structure. Using Theorem 2.7, we need only to show that the Bloch mode \u03d5 (1) j,\u03c0 for the operator L1 and the\nBloch mode \u03d5 (2) j,\u03c0 for the operator L2 have different parities. Indeed, up to a constant, the Bloch mode \u03d5 (2) j,\u03c0 is related to \u03d5 (1) j,\u03c0 by the following formula\n\u03d5 (2) j,\u03c0(x) = \u03d5 (1) j,\u03c0(x\u2212 1/2).\nIf \u03d5 (1) j,\u03c0 is odd, then\n\u03d5 (2) j,\u03c0(\u2212x) = \u03d5 (1) j,\u03c0(\u2212x\u2212 1/2) = \u2212\u03d5 (1) j,\u03c0(x+ 1/2) = \u03d5 (1) j,\u03c0(x\u2212 1/2) = \u03d5 (2) j,\u03c0(x),\ni.e., \u03d5 (2) j,\u03c0 is even. Similarly, one can show that \u03d5 (2) j,\u03c0 is odd if \u03d5 (1) j,\u03c0 is even. This completes the proof of the proposition.\nRemark 1 Generally, a shift of origin by 1/2 will change Zak phases by \u03c0 (e.g., [23]), as is apparent from the polarization interpretation of the Zak phase [32]; see Lemma 3.4 for the same shift in discrete models. Regarding the assumption that the band gap edge occurs at k = \u03c0, see Theorem 2.5 in [21], and Fig. 2 for an analogous situation in the SSH lattice model [29].\nRemark 2 Theorem 2.7 can be extended to electronic systems modelled by Schro\u0308dinger operators. More precisely, by replacing the operators Lj of the form (2.1) with the following ones\nLj = \u2212 d2\ndx2 + Vj, j = 1, 2,\nwhere Vj are real-valued piecewise continuous functions in one dimension that are periodic with period one and are even, the statement of Theorem 2.7 remains true. This follows from the same arguments."

The general S-invariant finite-range selfadjoint Hamiltonian is\nH = H(A1, . . . , Ar, V ) = r\u2211 i=1 ( Si \u2297 A\u2217i + (S\u2217)i \u2297 Ai ) + 1\u2297 V, (3.2)\nwhere Ai is the left-hopping matrix with range i, and V = V \u2217 is the on-site potential; they are 2\u00d7 2 matrices. For convenience, we will often simply write\nH = H(A, V ) = H(A1, . . . , Ar, V ).\nWhen r = 1, we have a nearest-neighbour model. The action of H = H(A, V ) on a\ngeneral C2-valued sequence \u03c8 = (\u03c8n)n\u2208Z is then\n(H\u03c8)n = A \u2217\u03c8n\u22121 + A\u03c8n+1 + V \u00b7 \u03c8n, n \u2208 Z.\nDue to S-invariance, we can Fourier transform H into the family of 2\u00d72 Bloch Hamiltonians,\nh(k) = A\u2217eik + Ae\u2212ik + V, k \u2208 B = [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]/\u2212\u03c0\u223c\u03c0,\nwhere each h(k) acts on the Bloch vector \u03c8(k) \u2208 C2. In the finite-range case, h will be a (matrix-valued) Laurent polynomial in eik. More generally, if H is approximately finiterange in the sense of being approximated in operator norm by Eq.

In total, Spec(H) is a closed interval, or a union of two closed intervals, and is purely essential spectrum. In the latter case, the two spectral intervals are separated by a spectral gap (E\u2212, E+), and we say that H is gapped.

It decomposes the Hilbert space into the direct sum of its +1 and \u22121 eigenspaces. We will use the symbols \u25e6 and \u2022 to represent degrees of freedom from each graded subspace.\nGenerally, a Hamiltonian operator H = H\u2217 is said to be chiral symmetric, with respect\nto \u0393, if H\u0393 = \u2212\u0393H holds. So H has an off-diagonal representation,\nH =  0 H\u2212+ H+\u2212 0  , H\u2212+ = H\u2217+\u2212, and comprises terms \u201chopping\u201d between \u25e6 and \u2022, but not between \u25e6, \u25e6 or between \u2022, \u2022. A chiral symmetric Hamiltonian has spectrum which is symmetric about 0. Furthermore, if H is Fredholm, then its index is defined to be the usual Fredholm index of H+\u2212. In other words,\nInd(H) := Ind(H+\u2212) \u2261 dim kerH+\u2212 \u2212 dim kerH\u2212+ \u2208 Z. (3.3)\nSo the index of H counts the number of zero-energy modes, with a + sign for \u25e6 and a \u2212 sign for \u2022. The index problem is to find a formula for Ind(H) in terms of a topological invariant associated to H.\nChiral symmetry: Index formula via winding number\nReturning to lattice models on `2(Z)\u2297C2, a sublattice operator is a grading operator of the form \u0393 = 1\u2297 \u03b3. The C2 at each unit cell is split into the \u00b1 eigenspaces of the 2\u00d7 2 matrix \u03b3. So we have a \u25e6 sublattice, and a \u2022 sublattice,\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nFor H(A, V ) to be chiral symmetric, the matrices A, V have to anticommute with \u03b3, thus they are off-diagonal (in a basis where \u03b3 = \u03c33). Then the Fourier transform of H(A, V ) has the form\nh(k) =  0 h\u2212+(k) h+\u2212(k) 0  =  0 h+\u2212(k) h+\u2212(k) 0  , k \u2208 B. (3.4) We call h+\u2212 : B \u2192 C of Eq. (3.4) the symbol function of H(A, V ). Since h(k)2 = |h+\u2212(k)|2 12, the eigenvalues of h(k) are \u00b1|h+\u2212(k)|. Therefore H(A, V ) has a spectral gap around 0 if and only if its symbol function h+\u2212 is nowhere-vanishing. The homotopy class of h+\u2212 : B \u2192 C\u2217, i.e., its winding number, is the bulk topological index for H.\nNote that `2(N) \u2282 `2(Z) is identified with the Hardy subspace H2(B) \u2282 L2(B) via Fourier transform. So H\u0302R,+\u2212 : ` 2(N) \u2192 `2(N) is identified with the compression of H+\u2212 : `2(Z) \u2192 `2(Z) to the Hardy space. In other words, H\u0302R,+\u2212 is identified with the classical Toeplitz operator on H2(B) \u223c= `2(N) with continuous symbol function h+\u2212. The C\u2217-algebra T of Toeplitz operators on `2(N) lies in a short exact sequence of C\u2217-algebras (see (4.9) of [3]),\n0 \u2212\u2192 K \u2212\u2192 T symbol\u2212\u2192 C(B) \u2212\u2192 0, (3.5)\nwhere K denotes the compact operators on `2(N). Similarly for Toeplitz operators acting on `2(N)\u2297C2, such as H\u0302R(A, V ). Writing M2(C) for the algebra of 2\u00d7 2 matrices, we have H(A, V ) Fourier\u223c= h \u2208 C(B) \u2297M2(C), while H\u0302R(A, V ) \u2208 T \u2297M2(C). Then Eq. (3.5) implies that the spectrum of H(A, V ) is precisely the spectrum of H\u0302R(A, V ) modulo the compact operators.\nTherefore, if H(A, V ) is chiral symmetric and has a spectral gap around 0, then the essential spectrum of H\u0302R(A, V ) is likewise gapped around 0. In this situation, H\u0302R(A, V ) is Fredholm, and we may ask for its index in the sense of Eq. (3.3), Ind H\u0302R(A, V ) \u2261 Ind H\u0302R,+\u2212. The Toeplitz index theorem (see, e.g., Theorem 4.4.3 of [3] for a proof) says that\nInd(H\u0302R(A, V )) = \u2212Wind(h+\u2212) = \u2212Ind(H\u0302L(A, V )). (3.6)\nActually, even more is true: either ker H\u0302R,+\u2212 = 0 or ker H\u0302R,\u2212+ = 0, see [7] and Theorem 4.5.4 of [3]. So the (unsigned) kernel dimension of H\u0302R(A, V ) is given by the absolute value of its index. Similarly for H\u0302L(A, V ). To summarize, we have proved:\nTheorem 3.1 Let H(A, V ) be an approximately finite-range Hamiltonian which is chiral symmetric and gapped (two-band model). Then\ndim ker H\u0302R = |Wind(h+\u2212)| = dim ker H\u0302L.\nIn nearest-neighbour models, one just has a second-order difference equation, Eq. (3.3), and Theorem 3.1 can be shown by direct algebraic means. In fact, one obtains a supplementary statement on the in-gap eigenvalues, proved in Theorems 1a\u2013b of [22], see also Theorem 10 of [27]:\nProposition 3.2 Let H(A, V ) be a chiral symmetric nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian with a spectral gap (around 0). Then H\u0302R(A, V ) does not have non-zero in-gap eigenvalues.\nWithout the nearest-neighbour assumption, in-gap eigenvalues of H\u0302R(A, V ) can appear in \u00b1E pairs. Although Theorem 3.1 still relates the zero-energy modes with non-trivial winding numbers, the spectral gap between such zero-energy modes and the rest of the spectrum will generally be much more narrow than the bulk spectral gap."

Given a connection on E\u2212, one acquires a U(1)-valued holonomy when parallel transporting a vector in E\u2212 around B.

Then we can ask for the choice of Bloch eigenvector \u03c8(k) in each E\u2212,k to be real with respect to PT, in which case the phase freedom is reduced from U(1) to O(1) = {\u00b11}. Thus, the space of PT-real Bloch eigenvectors in E\u2212 forms a principal O(1)-bundle over B. There are two possibilities \u2014 the trivial bundle and the Mo\u0308bius bundle, distinguished by the O(1)-valued holonomy (0, \u03c0-valued Zak phase). A \u03c0 Zak phase means that there is no globally continuous choice of PT-invariant eigenvectors for E\u2212 \u2014 one inevitably acquires a \u22121 mismatch after going around B.\nWe stress that the quantization of Zak phase has nothing, a priori, to do with chiral symmetry. Nevertheless, if H is chiral symmetric, then h has the form in Eq. (3.8) and it is easily seen to commute with the PT action (Remark 3) given by Eq. (3.10). So chiral symmetry implies PT-symmetry. But unlike the winding number, the Zak phase remains invariant even when chiral symmetry is broken, as long as PT-symmetry is retained.\nRemark 4 As we will be concerned with Hamiltonians which are separately P and T symmetric, we point out that the P symmetry implies that the quantized Zak phase is equivalently determined by the product-of-parities at k = 0 and k = \u03c0, see [14].\nE Inversion symmetric bulk-edge correspondence\nStrictly nearest-neighbour coupling\nLetH(A, V ) be P and T symmetric. So there is an associated sublattice operator \u0393 = 1\u2297\u03b3,\nwith {Q, \u03b3} = 0, according to Section 3 C. Let us reexamine the sublattice picture,\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nNotice that the nearest-neighbours of \u25e6 are always \u2022. So a hopping term between a pair of \u25e6 belonging to adjacent unit cells is actually a next-nearest-neighbour coupling. It is natural to require that the dominant terms in H(A, V ) are the strict nearest-neighbour couplings between adjacent \u2022, \u25e6, together with the on-site potential.\nTherefore, we define the strictly nearest-neighbour part ofH(A, V ), denotedHSNN(A, V ),\nto be given by the on-site potential together with the terms coupling adjacent \u2022 \u2190 \u25e6 and \u25e6 \u2192 \u2022. Explicitly, using a basis where \u03b3 = \u03c33, Q = \u03c31, we have\nHSNN(A, V ) = S\u2217 \u2297 0 0 t 0 + S\u2297 0 t 0 0 + 1\u2297 v0 s s v0  , (3.11) for some v0, s, t \u2208 R determined by (A, V ). By construction, HSNN(A, V ) is chiral symmetric up to the overall scalar v0. Observe that H SNN(A, V ) is P and T symmetric, and therefore, so is the remainder\nH far(A, V ) := H(A, V )\u2212HSNN(A, V ).\nWith these definitions, we can state and prove the following bulk-edge correspondence:\nTheorem 3.3 Let H(A, V ) be an approximately finite-range, P and T symmetric Hamiltonian. We assume that its strictly nearest-neighbour part, HSNN(A, V ), has a spectral gap of size 2\u2206 > 0 around some v0 \u2208 R, and that the remainder H far(A, V ) has norm smaller than \u2206 2 . If the Zak phase of H(A, V ) is \u03c0 (resp. 0), then H\u0302R(A, V ) has one (resp. no) in-gap eigenvalue inside the interval (v0 \u2212 \u22062 , v0 + \u2206 2 ).\nProof. As discussed above, HSNN(A, V )\u2212 v0 is chiral symmetric, and it has a spectral gap (\u2212\u2206,\u2206) by assumption. Its symbol function is a polynomial in eik of degree at most \u00b11, thus the winding number has magnitude at most 1. Theorem 3.1, together with Eq. (3.9), says that H\u0302SNNR (A, V ) has a (mid-gap) eigenvalue v0 precisely when the Zak phase of H SNN(A, V ) is \u03c0. Furthermore, this will be the only eigenvalue in the spectral gap of HSNN(A, V ), by Prop. 3.2, so it will be isolated from the rest of the spectrum of HSNN(A, V ) by a distance \u2206. If the Zak phase of HSNN(A, V ) is 0, there are no in-gap eigenvalues at all.\nNow restore the remainder term H far(A, V ). Since its norm is assumed to be smaller than\n\u2206 2 , the total operator H(A, V ) still has at least (v0\u2212 \u22062 , v0 + \u2206 2 ) as a spectral gap. Therefore the Zak phase of H(A, V ) remains well-defined, and coincides with that of HSNN(A, V ). Suppose this Zak phase is \u03c0, so we know that H\u0302SNNR (A, V ) has an in-gap eigenvalue with isolation distance \u2206. The half-space Hamiltonian has remainder term H\u0302 farR (A, V ) with norm smaller than \u2206 2 (compression to a Toeplitz operator preserves the norm, see Theorem 4.2.4 of [3]). So by spectral perturbation theory, see \u00a74.V.3 of [18], the total half-space operator H\u0302R(A, V ) = H\u0302 SNN R (A, V )+H\u0302 far R (A, V ) still has one eigenvalue in the interval (v0\u2212 \u22062 , v0 + \u2206 2 ). Similarly, if the Zak phase is 0, then (v0 \u2212 \u22062 , v0 + \u2206 2 ) remains a spectral gap for H\u0302R(A, V )."

However, the position labels for the \u25e6 sublattice get shifted by 1, while those for the \u2022 sublattice remain unchanged. Thus, we need to apply the unitary transformation U = diag(shift, id) to change conventions.\nLemma 3.4 Let H(A, V ) be a P and T symmetric gapped Hamiltonian, so that it has a 0 or \u03c0-valued Zak phase with respect to a given unit cell convention. Upon switching to the\nhalf unit-cell shifted convention, the Zak phase is shifted by \u03c0.\nProof. As explained in Section 3 D, the Zak phase may be computed as the product-ofparities of the lower energy Bloch modes at k = 0 and k = \u03c0. Let us write out these Bloch\nmodes explicitly. The matrix Q = \u03c31 has \u00b1 eigenvalues with respective eigenvector (\u00b11\n1\n) . So\nthe periodic Bloch modes (i.e. k = 0) with even/odd parity are\n(\u03c80,e)n =\n( 1\n1\n) , (\u03c80,o)n = ( \u22121 1 ) , n \u2208 Z.\nOne of these is the lower energy mode for H(A, V ) at k = 0. Similarly, the antiperiodic (k = \u03c0) Bloch modes with even/odd parity are, respectively,\n(\u03c8\u03c0,e)n = (\u22121)n ( 1\n1\n) , (\u03c8\u03c0,o)n = (\u22121)n ( \u22121 1 ) , n \u2208 Z.\nOne of these is the lower energy mode for H(A, V ) at k = \u03c0. From the above expressions, U = diag(shift, id) acts as the identity on \u03c80,e and \u03c80,o, whereas it exchanges \u03c8\u03c0,e with \u03c8\u03c0,o. Therefore, after applying U , the parity of the lower energy mode of H(A, V ) at k = \u03c0 is changed, resulting in a \u03c0-shifted Zak phase.\nLemma 3.4 shows that the bulk Zak phase invariant has no observable meaning without reference to a unit cell convention. This subtlety also arises for the winding numbers of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians, and was highlighted in [30]; see also [28] for a related discussion. In our bulk-boundary correspondence, Theorem 3.3, the boundary termination designates the unit cell convention.\nG Interface modes in SSH discrete models\nWe introduce the Hilbert space\n`2(\u2212N; C2)\u2295C\u2295 `2(N; C2), (3.12)\ncorresponding to the following partition,\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 | \u2022 \u25e6 | \u2022 \u25e6 | \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (3.13)\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 3 | \u2212 2 | \u2212 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nand study interface Hamiltonians Hint = Hint(AL, VL, AR, VR;BL, BR,W ), defined as\n(Hint\u03c8)n =  A\u2217R\u03c8n\u22121 + AR\u03c8n+1 + VR\u03c8n, n \u2265 2, B\u2217R\u03c80 + AR\u03c82 + VR\u03c81, n = 1, B\u2217L\u03c8\u22121 +BR\u03c81 +W\u03c80, n = 0, A\u2217L\u03c8\u22122 +BL\u03c80 + VL\u03c8\u22121, n = \u22121,\nA\u2217L\u03c8n\u22121 + AL\u03c8n+1 + VL\u03c8n, n \u2264 \u22122.\n(3.14)\nHere B\u2217L, BR are 1 \u00d7 2 matrices hopping from n = \u22121 to n = 0, and n = +1 to n = 0 respectively, while W \u2208 R is the on-site potential at n = 0. Put simply, once n \u2265 2, we have H(AR, VR), and once n \u2264 \u22122, we have H(AL, VL). The interface region covers n = \u22121, 0,+1, and involves also the hopping terms BL, BR and defect potential W . The nearest-neighbour interface model of Eq. (3.14) is easily generalized to (approximately) finite-range interface Hamiltonians, by replacing AL, AR with a sequence of hopping matrices, and BL, BR,W with a finitely-supported (thus compact) interface term.\nThe bulk parameters (AL, VL) and (AR, VR) are each assumed to satisfy the P-symmetry condition, Eq. (3.7), and T-symmetry, while the interface terms (BL, BR,W ) are arbitrary. So there is an associated sublattice operator on the Hilbert space (3.12), as indicated by the \u25e6, \u2022 symbols in Eq. (3.13).\nExample 3.5 If VL = VR = \u03c31 and AL, AR, BL, BR,W = 0, then we have, pictorially,\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 | \u2022 = \u25e6 | \u2022 = \u25e6 | \u2022 | \u25e6 = \u2022 | \u25e6 = \u2022 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nNeglecting n = 0, the operator Hint is just an infinite direct sum of \u03c31, and the bulk spectrum is obviously {\u22121,+1}. However, the interface degree of freedom is now a zero-energy mode.\nSu\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger model\nThe classic polymer interface SSH model [29] is a strictly nearest-neighbour model, pic-\ntorially represented as\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 \u2212 \u2022 = \u25e6 \u2212 \u2022 = \u25e6 \u2212 \u2022 \u2212 \u25e6 = \u2022 \u2212 \u25e6 = \u2022 \u2212 \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (3.15)\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 | \u2212 2 | \u2212 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nThe intracell hopping term, indicated by =, is VL = VR = V = s\u03c31 for some amplitude s \u2208 R. On the right side, the intercell left-hopping term \u2022 \u2190 \u25e6 is\nAR = A = 0 0 t 0  , t \u2208 R. On the left side, the intercell left-hopping term is \u25e6 \u2190 \u2022, but note that \u2022 \u223c ( 1 0 ) and \u25e6 \u223c ( 0 1\n) on this side, so we still have AL = A. The bulk Hamiltonians H(AL, VL) = H(A, V ) = H(AR, VR) are precisely of the P and T symmetric, strictly nearest-neighbour form considered in Eq. (3.11), with no on-site term v0.\nThe interface terms are\nBR = ( uR 0 ) , B\u2217L = ( 0 uL ) , W = 0, uL, uR \u2208 R.\nImportantly, the overall SSH model Hamiltonian,\nHSSH = Hint(A, V,A, V ;BL, BR, 0), (3.16)\nis chiral symmetric. Example 3.5 is an SSH model Hamiltonian with s = 1, t = 0 and trivial interface terms.\nTo understand the spectrum of HSSH, let us first turn off the interface terms, so that we\njust have a direct sum decomposition\nHint(A, V,A, V ; 0, 0, 0) = H\u0302L(A, V )\u2295 0\u2295 H\u0302R(A, V ).\nThe bulk Hamiltonian, H(A, V ), has nowhere-vanishing symbol function h+\u2212(k) = s+ te \u2212ik (thus H(A, V ) is gapped), if and only if |s| 6= |t|. When |s| > |t|, the winding number is 0, whereas it is \u22121 when |t| > |s|. By the index theorem, Eq. (3.6), H\u0302L(A, V ) and H\u0302R(A, V ) each has zero index (|s| > |t| case) or +1 index (|t| > |s| case). Clearly the n = 0 degree of freedom is a \u2022 zero mode. The total index (mod 2) in both cases is thus\nInd(Hint(A, V,A, V ; 0, 0, 0)) = 1 mod 2.\nNow, as we turn on the interface terms BL, BR, the chiral symmetry is preserved. Since the index is stable under such finite-rank perturbations, we still have\nInd(HSSH) \u2261 Ind(Hint(A, V,A, V ;BL, BR, 0)) = 1 mod 2.\nWe have proved:\nProposition 3.6 For hopping amplitudes s, t with |s| 6= |t|, and arbitrary interface hopping terms, the SSH interface Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.16), has a bulk spectral gap with an odd number of zero modes.\nThe existence of such interface modes was discussed in the seminal paper [29] with a passing mention of index theorems in a subsequent work [16]. To our knowledge, our proof of Prop. 3.6 is the first direct index-theoretic one.\nH Interface modes in dislocation model\nWhile SSH model Hamiltonians exhibit a very clean formulation of bulk-interface correspondence, the reliance on strict chiral symmetry is problematic when we wish to model realistic continuum systems such as the photonic systems of Sec 2, which only have P and T symmetry but no analogue of chiral symmetry.\nIn general, having (AL, VL) = (AR, VR) = (A, V ) in the interface model means that we put the \u201csame\u201d system on the left and right sides, but separate them by an extra half unit cell defect. Thus, we call Hint(A, V,A, V ;BL, BR,W ) a dislocation model Hamiltonian. With respect to a common origin, the Zak phases for the right and left systems will therefore differ by \u03c0, due to Lemma 3.4. Informally, we say that a \u201ctrivial\u201d system has been placed next to a \u201ctopological\u201d system.\nAs in Theorem 3.3, let us extract the strictly nearest-neighbour part HSNNint (A, V ). It has\nbulk part, HSNN(A, V ), having the form of Eq. (3.11), and the spectral gap is easily seen to be (v0 \u2212\u2206, v0 + \u2206), with\n\u2206 = \u2223\u2223|s| \u2212 |t|\u2223\u2223.\nAssuming that H far(A, V ) = H(A, V )\u2212HSNN(A, V ) has norm smaller than \u2206 2 , its restoration does not close the gap, and the Zak phases of H(A, V ) and HSNN(A, V ) will be the same. We are interested in the relation between this Zak phase and the in-gap eigenvalues of Hint.\nCase where Zak(H(A, V )) = 0.\nThis occurs when |s| > |t|. Pictorially,\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 | \u2022 \u25e6 | \u2022 \u25e6 | \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (3.17)\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 3 | \u2212 2 | \u2212 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nwith the two points in a unit cell being closer to each other, indicating that the intracell coupling is stronger than the intercell one. Ignoring interface terms, we have a direct sum\nHint(A, V,A, V ; 0, 0, v0) = H\u0302L(A, V )\u2295 v0 \u2295 H\u0302R(A, V ).\nNote that the middle term is v0, and we consider only the offset potential W \u2212 v0 as part of the interface terms.\nAssume that ||H far(A, V )||op < \u22062 . By Theorem 3.3, both H\u0302L(A, V ) and H\u0302R(A, V ) retain\na spectral gap (v0 \u2212 \u22062 , v0 + \u2206 2 ) even after the H\u0302 farL (A, V ), H\u0302 far R (A, V ) terms are restored. So Hint(A, V,A, V ; 0, 0, v0) has v0 as an eigenvalue, spectrally isolated by a distance \u2206 2 . This in-gap eigenvalue will survive the reintroduction of the interface terms, provided they are smaller than \u2206 4 in norm. For example, one typically chooses\nBR = ( t 0 ) , B\u2217L = ( 0 t ) , W \u2212 v0 \u2206.\nSince |t| < |s| and \u2206 = |s| \u2212 |t|, it is possible to satisfy the small interface term condition.\nCase where Zak(H(A, V )) = \u03c0.\nThis occurs when |t| > |s|, i.e., the intercell hopping dominates the intracell one. Picto-\nrially, instead of Eq. (3.17), we have\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 | \u2022 \u25e6 | \u2022 \u25e6 | \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u25e6 \u2022 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 2 | \u2212 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nIn the second line above, we introduce an alternative partition where the n 6= 0 unit cells are each shifted by half a unit cell. With this convention, the Zak phase of the left and right bulk systems becomes 0, while the n = 0 cell has three degrees of freedom.\nFirst, we ignore the terms hopping in/out of n = 0, so that the interface system can be separated into three independent parts. As before, H\u0302L(A, V ) and H\u0302R(A, V ) retain a spectral gap (v0\u2212 |t|\u2212|s|2 , v0 + |t|\u2212|s| 2 ), under the assumption that H far(A, V ) is smaller than \u2206 2 = |t|\u2212|s| 2 .\nFor the enlarged n = 0 cell, the on-site term is H0 =  v0 t 0 t v0 t\n0 t v0  , which has eigenvalues {v0 \u2212 \u221a 2|t|, v0, v0 + \u221a 2|t|}. So H\u0302L(A, V )\u2295H0 \u2295 H\u0302R(A, V ) has v0 as an in-gap eigenvalue, still isolated by a distance of at least \u2206 2 .\nNow restore the interface term, which involves s, BR, BL,W \u2212 v0 and other longer-range\nterms. Assuming this interface term has norm smaller than \u2206 4 , the in-gap eigenvalue will survive. Note that |s| < |t| and \u2206 = |t| \u2212 |s|, so it is possible to satisfy the small interface term condition.\nThe results of this Subsection are summarized as follows:\nTheorem 3.7 Let Hint = Hint(A, V,A, V ;BL, BR,W ) be a dislocation model Hamiltonian, with P and T symmetric bulk Hamiltonian H(A, V ). Assume that for some overall scalar term v0 and some \u2206 > 0, the strictly nearest-neighbour term H SSN(A, V ) has a spectral gap (v0 \u2212\u2206, v0 + \u2206), the term H far(A, V ) = H(A, V ) \u2212HSNN(A, V ) has norm smaller than \u22062 , and the interface term in Hint has norm smaller than \u2206 4 . Then Hint has one in-gap interface mode inside the interval (v0 \u2212 \u22064 , v0 + \u2206 4 ).\nRemark 5 Whether |s| > |t| or |s| < |t| indicates two distinct ways of opening a spectral\ngap, starting from the equidistant case, |s| = |t|. In [16, 29], this was called \u201csymmetry breaking\u201d induced by a staggered displacement field .\nRemark 6 We do not actually need (AL, VL) = (AR, VR) in Theorem 3.7. As in Theorem 2.7, we can allow H(AL, VL) to be any P and T symmetric Hamiltonian with the same Zak phase as H(AR, VR), as long as they share a common bulk gap, and the conditions on H SSN, H far and interface terms are correspondingly made more conservative."

Famous lattice models, e.g. SSH models, employ further assumptions such as strictly nearest-neighbour interactions, to greatly simplify the analysis while still exhibiting interesting features (e.g., interface modes). However, when we go further and make statements about entire classes of (e.g. interface, dislocation) lattice models constrained only by symmetries such as P, T, the link to realistic continuum models (e.g., [1, 2]) may become weakened.\nFor example, a \u201cpurely topological\u201d version of Theorem 3.7 might read: \u201cthe interface of a trivial and topological phase has an in-gap interface mode\u201d. This is false: Consider Example 3.5, which has bulk gap (\u22121, 1) and a zero-mode supported at n = 0. Increasing the interface potential term W pushes the in-gap eigenvalue into the bulk spectrum.\nComparison with Prop. 2.8 is instructive. In the continuum model, the lowest band is known to have minimal energy at k = 0 and even parity there. So when the lowest two bands are isolated from the others, the parity at k = \u03c0 suffices to determine the Zak phase of the lowest band (thus the bulk index \u03b31). Prop. 2.8 and Theorem 3.7 become very similar, but they differ in range of validity. For the lattice model, it will be interesting to analyze the conditions under which the in-gap interface mode of Theorem 3.7 is the only one inside the entire bulk spectral gap, as is the case for the continuum model."
