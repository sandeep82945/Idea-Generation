    "abstractText": "With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), low earth orbit (LEO) satellite IoT is expected to provide low power, massive connectivity and wide coverage IoT applications. In this context, this paper provides a massive grantfree random access (GF-RA) scheme for LEO satellite IoT. This scheme does not need to change the transceiver, but transforms the received signal to a tensor decomposition form. By exploiting the characteristics of the tensor structure, a Bayesian learning algorithm for joint active device detection and channel estimation during massive GF-RA is designed. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm has fast convergence and low complexity. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm its better performance in terms of error probability for active device detection and normalized mean square error for channel estimation over baseline algorithms in LEO satellite IoT. Especially, it is found that the proposed algorithm requires short preamble sequences and support massive connectivity with a low power, which is appealing to LEO satellite IoT.",

INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely applied in various fields, e.g., industry, agriculture, traffic and medicine [1]-[3]. As a typical machine-type communication, IoT have two important characteristics compared to traditional humantype communication. The first one is massive connectivity. It is predicted that in 2025, the number of IoT devices will reach 21.5 billion. In this context, massive machine-type communication (mMTC) has been defined as one of main use cases of 5G wireless networks, namely 5G cellular IoT [4]. The second one is wide coverage. IoT has been applied not only in urban areas, but also in remote areas, e.g., forest, ocean, mountain, and desert. However, these remote areas do not have effective terrestrial wireless coverage. To this end, low earth orbit (LEO) satellite IoT is proposed and receives considerable interests due to short propagation latency and small path loss [5]. In recent years, SpaceX and OneWeb companies launch a large number of LEO satellites to provide global coverage [6] [7].\nConsidering the bursty nature of IoT applications, random access protocol is adopted in IoT to save the energy [8]. For instance, 5G cellular IoT employs the famous ALOHA\nMing Ying (Email: 3180103509@zju.edu.cn) and Xiaoming Chen (Email: chen_xiaoming@zju.edu.cn) are with the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China. Xiaodan Shao (Email: shaoxiaodan@zju.edu.cn) is with the Institute for Digital Communications (IDC), Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.\nprotocol [9]. Meanwhile, various improved ALOHA protocols are also widely utilized in traditional satellite communications [10] [11]. ALOHA is a commonly used grant-based random access (GB-RA) protocol, which requires four transmissions between access point and active devices [12]. Firstly, each active device randomly selects a preamble sequence from a set of orthogonal sequences and sends the sequence to the access point. Next, the access point responds to each active device, authorizing them to send connection requests. After that, the active device sends a connection request to the access point for resource allocation to transmit data. Finally, if the preamble sequence that the active device sends is unique, the access point will authorize the corresponding request and send a contention-resolution message to inform the active device of the available resources. For LEO satellite IoT, due to long transmission distance (from 400 to 2000 kilometers), four transmissions lead to a high access latency. Especially in the scenario of massive connectivity, ALOHA may have a high access failure probability, which further increases the access latency. Moreover, the ASL spacemobilie launched a LEO satellite named bluewalker 3 recently. Such a LEO satellite can support the direct access of a massive number of mobile devices, which is an important trend of LEO satellite IoT. In the context of massive direct access, GF-RA is a promising protocol. To this end, grant-free random access protocol is introduced to LEO satellite IoT [13] [14]. Specifically, after sending their assigned preamble sequences, active devices transmit their data signals directly without the grant of LEO satellites. Thus, the access latency can be decreased significantly. Therefore, grant-free random access is appealing to LEO satellite IoT.\nThe key of grant-free random access is to detect active devices from the received preamble sequences [15]-[17]. Since the preamble sequences are not orthogonal in the scenario of massive connectivity, active device detection is not trivial. Considering only a small portion of devices are active in a time slot due to the bursty nature of IoT applications, active device detection is usually formulated as a compressed sensing problem. For such a problem, approximate message passing (AMP) is an effective approach [18] [19]. In [20], the authors analyzed the activity detection performance of AMP in cellular IoT. It is proved that as the number of base station antennas tends to infinity, the activity error probability of AMP asymptotically approaches zero. However, if the number of base station antennas is limited, AMP requires long preamble sequences in order to guarantee the accuracy of active device\n2 detection. With the goal of decreasing the required length of preamble sequences, covariance-based approaches are applied to active device detection [21] [22]. Specifically, the covariance information of the received signal is utilized to detect the active devices. In [23], over Rayleigh fading channels, the authors proposed an active device detection algorithm by maximizing the likelihood function of the received signal. Furthermore, a joint activity detection and channel estimation algorithm based on the covariance of the received signal was designed in [24]. Moreover, optimization-based approaches also can be used to detect the active devices. In [25], the authors first projected the received signal to a low-dimension space, and then employed a Riemann optimization method to judge the active devices. In [26], the authors proposed a new reconfigurable intelligent surface-aided massive access architecture and formulated joint active device separation and channel estimation as a coupled high-order tensor problem, which was addressed by using a Bayesian learning method [27].\nA common assumption to the above active device detection algorithms for grant-free random access is that the channels experience Rayleigh fading. Yet, for LEO satellite IoT, due to the existence of light-of-sight (LOS) transmission, the direct application of the above detection algorithms may lead to severe performance degradation. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, grant-free random access in LEO satellite IoT is still an open issue. Recently, tensor-based approaches are applied in unsourced random access [28] [29]. It is shown that such approaches are able to recover data codewords from the mixed received signals exactly. However, these works as [29] are all proposed for Rayleigh channel, which may not be applicable in the scenarios of Rician channel. In this context, this paper intends to design a simple but effective tensor-based grant-free random access scheme for LEO satellite IoT in presence of LOS transmission. The contributions of this paper are as follows.\n1) We propose a novel framework of massive grant-free\nrandom access for LEO satellite IoT. Such a framework does not need to change the transceiver of LEO satellite IoT, but only transforms the received signal to a tensor decomposition form. 2) We design a low-complexity joint activity detection and\nchannel estimation algorithm based on the proposed massive grant-free random access framework by exploiting the tensor structure of the received signal. 3) We analyze the convergence behavior and computational\ncomplexity of the proposed algorithm, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in LEO satellite IoT via extensive simulations.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the considered LEO satellite IoT network with the focus on the adopted massive grant-free random access protocol. Then, we propose a tensor-based Bayesian learning algorithm for joint activity detection and channel estimation, and analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm in Section III. After that, we present extensive simulation results in Section IV to evaluate the performance\nof the proposed algorithm.

            "text": "Considering the above channel characteristics of LEO satellite IoT, we propose a tensor-based GF-RA protocol. First, a unique preamble sequence of length L is designed for each IoT device. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the length L of preamble sequences can be factorized as L = \u220fd\ni=1 li for some d \u2265 2, li \u2265 2, i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d. Subsequently, a rank-1 tensor Ak of dimensions l1, l2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ld is generated as\nAk = a1,k \u25e6 a2,k \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 ad,k, \u2200k (5) where ai,k \u2208 Cli\u00d71, i \u2208 {1, 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7d} is a series of vectors Gaussian distributed with unit norm. Then, the preamble sequence ak for device k is constructed as\nak = vec(Ak) \u2208 C \u220fd i=1 li = CL\u00d71. (6)\nAccording to the property of outer product [28], we have\nak = a1,k \u2297 a2,k \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 ad,k. (7) Once device k is activated, ak is sent to the LEO satellite at the beginning of the time slot for joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE). Thus, the received signal Y \u2208 CL\u00d7M at the LEO satellite can be expressed as2\nY =\nK\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03b1k \u221a \u03bekh H k +N =\nK\u2211\nk=1\nakx H k +N, (8)\nwhere hk is the channel between device k and the LEO satellite described in (2), \u03bek is the transmit power of preamble sequence, N \u2208 CL\u00d7M is the additive white Gaussian noise with variance \u03c32n, and \u03b1k is the activity indicator with \u03b1k = 1 if the k-th device is active and \u03b1k = 0 otherwise. Considering the activity possibility pk, we have\n{\nPr(\u03b1k = 1) = pk Pr(\u03b1k = 0) = 1\u2212 pk .

Substituting (7) to (10),\n2The large carrier frequency offset (CFO) caused by high mobility of the LEO satellite is compensated before according to the deterministic LEO\u2019s trajectory [37], [38].\n4 the vectorized received signal y can be rewritten in terms of vectors ai,k \u2208 Cli ,1 \u2264 i \u2264 d as follows\ny =\nK\u2211\nk=1\na1,k \u2297 a2,k \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 ad,k \u2297 xk + n.

The orange cube denotes the observable variables, especially the received signal Y in tensor form, white cube denotes the AWGN W in tensor form, and white circle denotes \u03b2. The green rectangles denote the rank1 tensor of factor matrix X, and arrows describe conditional dependencies between variables.\nFig. 2, we construct the probabilistic model by using some probability density functions (pdfs) to interpret each unknown term in the problem (14). Firstly, let us investigate the device state matrix X. According to the LEO satellite channel characteristics in (1) and the activity probability in (3), especially the LOS component hLOSk and the NLOS component h NLOS\nk ,\nX can be modelled as the following circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian prior distribution for each column of X\np ( X|{\u00b5k}Kk=1, {vk}Kk=1 ) =\nK\u220f\nk=1\nCN (X(:, k)|\u00b5\u22121k 1M , v\u22121k IM ),\n(15)\nwhere \u00b5\u22121k and v \u22121 k are mean and variance for the LEO satellite channel of device k, respectively. Considering low activity probabilities of IoT devices, the device state matrix X is usually of column sparsity. In order to promote sparsity, we adopt gamma distribution to characterize the parameters \u00b5k and vk in (15) as below [40]\np ( {\u00b5k}Kk=1|i\u00b5 ) =\nK\u220f\nk=1\nGamma(\u00b5k|\u03b5, \u03b5) = K\u220f\nk=1\n\u00b5\u03b5\u22121k exp(\u2212\u03b5\u00b5k),\n(16)\np ( {vk}Kk=1|iv ) =\nK\u220f\nk=1\nGamma(vk|\u03b5, \u03b5) = K\u220f\nk=1\nv\u03b5\u22121k exp(\u2212\u03b5vk),\n(17)\nwhere \u03b5 > 0 is a small number which ensures the noninformativeness of the prior model, iv = [\u2212\u03b51K , (\u03b5 \u2212 1)1K ] and i\u00b5 = [\u2212\u03b51K , (\u03b5 \u2212 1)1K ] are natural parameters, which are used to describe the distributions of varibles v and \u00b5.\nThen, let us consider the squared error term \u2016Y \u2212 [[A1,A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ad,X]] \u20162F in problem (14). As N is additive white Gaussian noise, we can interpret Y as the following negative log of a likelihood function\np ( Y|X, \u03b2 ) \u221d exp\n( \u2212 \u03b2\u2016Y \u2212 [[A1,A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ad,X]] \u20162F ) , (18)\nwhere \u03b2 is the noise precision that can be modeled as gamma\n5 distribution, i.e.,\np ( \u03b2|i\u03b2 ) =\nK\u220f\nk=1\nGamma(\u03b2|\u03b5, \u03b5) = K\u220f\nk=1\n\u03b2\u03b5\u22121exp(\u2212\u03b5\u03b2), (19)\nwith natural parameter i\u03b2 = [\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5\u2212 1]. Finally, We use \u0398 to denote the aggregation of all the unknown random variables, that is, \u0398 = {X, \u03b2, {\u00b5k}Kk=1, {vk}Kk=1}. Combining (15)-(19), we can obtain the following joint pdf of \u0398 and Y by using Bayesian formulas\np ( \u0398,Y ) = p ( Y|X, \u03b2) \u00b7 p ( X|{\u00b5k}Kk=1, {vk}Kk=1)\u00b7 p ( {\u00b5k}Kk=1|i\u00b5) \u00b7 p ( {vk}Kk=1|iv) \u00b7 p ( \u03b2|i\u03b2)\n\u221d exp { \u2212 \u03b2\u2016Y \u2212 [[A1,A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ad,X]] \u20162F + ( d\u220f\ni=1\nliM) ln\u03b2\n\u2212 \u03b5\u03b2 + (\u03b5\u2212 1) ln\u03b2 \u2212 Tr[\u039b(X\u2212P)H(X\u2212P)]\u2212 K\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b5vk\n+ (M + \u03b5\u2212 1) K\u2211\nk=1\nln vk + (\u03b5\u2212 1) K\u2211\nk=1\nln\u00b5k \u2212 K\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b5\u00b5k\n}\n,\n(20)\nwhere \u039b = diag(v1, v2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vK) \u2208 CK\u00d7K and P = [\u00b5\u221211 1M , \u00b5 \u22121 2 1M , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b5\u22121K 1M ] \u2208 CM\u00d7K . With the joint pdf p ( \u0398,Y) in (20), we apply the Bayesian inference method to learn the unknown variables in \u0398 from the tensor data Y by maximizing the posterior distribution of \u0398, i.e., p(\u0398|Y), which can be computed as\np(\u0398|Y) = p(\u0398,Y) p(Y) = p(\u0398,Y) \u222b p(\u0398,Y)d\u0398 .

            "text": "The joint pdf p ( \u0398,Y ) we derive in (20) is excessively complex, which prohibits us to get an exact Bayesian inference algorithm based on the posterior distribution in (21) for the unknown parameters [43]. Particularly, it is intractable to compute the posterior distribution with multiple integrations in (21). In order to deal with this problem, we apply the variational inference method which constructs a variational distribution q(\u0398) to approximate the true posterior distribution p(\u0398|Y). To achieve this goal, q(\u0398) can be regarded as the solution which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, that is minimize\nq(\u0398) KL(q(\u0398)|p(\u0398|Y))\n, minimize q(\u0398)\n\u2212Eq(\u0398) { ln p(\u0398|Y) q(\u0398) } . (22)\nObviously, if there is no other constraints imposed on q(\u0398), the KL divergence will come to 0 as q(\u0398) = p(\u0398/Y), which leads us back to the original intractable posterior distribution in (21). To handle the problem (22), mean-field approximation [44] is employed as an useful method to get a tractable solution. For mean-field approximation, it requires an assumption that the variational pdf q(\u0398) can be represented in a completely factorized form, as q(\u0398) =\n\u220fJ j=1 q(\u0398j),\nwhere \u0398j is a set partition of \u0398, that is, \u22c3J j=1 \u0398j = \u0398 and\n\u22c2J j=1 \u0398j = \u2205, and J is the number of set partitions. With this factorization, problem (22) can be rewritten as\nminimize {q(\u0398j)}Jj=1\n\u2212E{q(\u0398j)}Jj=1 { ln ( p(\u0398|Y)\n\u220fJ j=1 q(\u0398j)\n)}\n. (23)\nNoting that the structure of {q(\u0398j)}Jj=1 is a fully factorized form, which motivates us to use the block coordinate descent method to gain a suboptimal solution of (23). Specifically, by fixing the rest variational pdfs {q(\u0398j)}j 6=i, \u2200i except q(\u0398j), q(\u0398j) can be optimized as\nminimize q(\u0398j)\n\u222b\nq(\u0398j) (\n\u2212E\u220f i6=j q(\u0398i)\nln p(\u0398,Y)+ ln q(\u0398j) ) d\u0398j.\n(24)\nBy solving the above optimization problem (24), the optimal\nsolution can be computed as [45]\nq\u2217(\u0398j) = exp(E\u220f i6=j q(\u0398i) ln p(\u0398,Y))\n\u222b E\u220f\ni6=j q(\u0398i) ln p(\u0398,Y)d\u0398j\n, \u2200j. (25)\nBased on the optimal solution q\u2217(\u0398j) in (25), we can derive a closed-form posterior update for variational pdfs of each unknown variable in \u0398.\nWe concentrate on deriving the variational distribution of the q(X), whose mean matrix is a tight approximation of the desired device state matrix X. Yet, the likelihood function proposed in (18) results in complex computation among the device state matrix X, which makes the q\u2217(X) difficult to derive. In order to overcome this difficulty, we define Y(d + 1) \u2208 CM\u00d7l1l2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ld as an unfolding operation for an (d + 1)thorder tensor Y \u2208 Cl1\u00d7l2\u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7ld\u00d7M along its (d+ 1)-th mode. By substituting (20) into (25), with the property of matrix trace \u2016A\u20162F = Tr(AAH) and only keeping the terms relevant to X, we get q\u2217(X) \u221d { E [ \u2212 \u03b2 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225Y \u2212 [[A1,A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ad,X]] \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 2\nF\n\u2212 Tr ( \u039b(X\u2212P)H(X\u2212P) )]}\n\u221d exp{\u2212Tr(X \u00b7 [ E[\u03b2]E[( d\u22c4\nj=1 Aj)\nT ( d\u22c4\nj=1 Aj)\n\u2217] + E[\u039b]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nC \u22121 X\n]\n\u00b7XH\n\u2212XC\u22121X [( E[\u03b2]Y(d + 1) (\nd\u22c4 j=1\nE[Aj ] )\u2217 + E[\u039b]E[P]\n)\nCX\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nMX\n]H\n\u2212MXC\u22121X XH}, (26)\nwhere d\u22c4 j=1 Aj = A1 \u22c4 A2 \u22c4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22c4 Ad denotes the multiple Khatri-Rao products. It is found that the device state matrix X obeys the circularly symmetric complex matrix Gaussian distribution CNM\u00d7K(X|MX ,1M \u2297 CX) with mean matrix MX and covariance matrix 1M \u2297CX .\nAs mentioned above, MX can approximate the desired device state matrix X. Thereby, we focus on the derivation of MX . As seen in (26), CX is involved in MX . In this context, we derive all terms in MX and CX in the following.\nFirstly, we calculate the expectation E[\u039b] consisting of\n6 E[vk], k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,K . By substituting (20) to (25) and removing the terms irrelevant to vk, we remain\nq\u2217({vk}Kk=1) \u221d exp{E[\u2212Tr(\u039b(X\u2212P)H(X\u2212P))\n\u2212 K\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b5vk + (M + \u03b5\u2212 1) K\u2211\nk=1\nln vk]}, (27)\nwhich is equivalent to q\u2217({vk}Kk=1) = K\u220f\nk=1\nq\u2217(vk) with\nq\u2217(vk) \u221d exp\n{\u2212vk E[X(:, k)HX(:, k)\u2212 2\u00b5\u22121k ( M\u2211\nm=1\nX(m, k)) +M\u00b5\u22122k + \u03b5]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\navk\n+ (M + \u03b5 \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nbv\n\u22121) ln vk}.\n(28)\nFrom (28), it is known that the optimal q\u2217(vk) obeys the gamma distribution as Gamma(vk|avk , bv). For the mean avk , we have\navk =MX(:, k) HMX(:, k) +MCX(k, k)\n\u2212 2E[\u00b5\u22121k ] M\u2211\nm=1\nMX(m, k) +ME[\u00b5 \u22122 k ] + \u03b5.\n(29)\nThen, according to the property of gamma distribution, the expectation of parameter vk can be calculated by E[vk] = bv/avk with bv = M + \u03b5.\nIn a similar way, let us think about the parameter \u00b5k to calculate expectations E[\u00b5\u22121k ] and E[\u00b5 \u22122 k ]. After plugging the proposed joint pdf (25) into (20) and only remaining the terms related to \u00b5k, we get\nq\u2217({\u00b5k}Kk=1) \u221dexp{E[\u2212Tr(\u039b(PHP\u2212XHP\u2212PHX))\n+ (\u03b5\u2212 1) K\u2211\nk=1\nln\u00b5k \u2212 K\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b5\u00b5k]},\n(30)\nDue to q\u2217({\u00b5k}Kk=1) = K\u220f\nk=1\nq\u2217(\u00b5k), we obtain\nq\u2217(\u00b5k) \u221dexp{\u2212\u00b5\u22122k ME[vk] \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\no\u00b5k\n+\u00b5\u22121k\n( 2E[ M\u2211\nm=1\nX(m, k)]E[vk]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nt\u00b5k\n)\n\u2212 \u03b5\u00b5k + (\u03b5\u2212 1) ln\u00b5k} (31)\nThere exist two additional terms \u00b5\u22122k and \u00b5 \u22121 k in the pdf (31) compared with gamma distribution, which make the calculation of E[\u00b5\u22121k ] and E[\u00b5 \u22122 k ] much more complicated. To this end, we expect to obtain an approximation of (31). In order to approximate (31), the term \u03b5\u00b5k is neglected since it is sufficiently small. Therefore, the expectation of \u00b5k in (31) can be derived. For simplicity, we use a\u00b5k and b\u00b5k to denote the coefficient of \u00b5\u22122k and \u00b5 \u22121 k . In other words, we have a\u00b5k = ME[vk] and b\u00b5k = 2 M\u2211\nm=1 MX(m, k) \u00b7 E[vk]\u2212 \u03b5.\nIn this case, E[\u00b5\u22121k ] and E[\u00b5 \u22122 k ] can be cast as (32) and (33)\nat the top of next page.\nFinally, to derive the expectation E[\u03b2], the posterior distribution of noise precision \u03b2 is updated by the following equation\nq\u2217(\u03b2) \u221d(( d\u220f\ni=1\nliM) + \u03b5\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nb\u03b2\n\u22121) ln\u03b2\n\u2212 \u03b2 E [ \u2016Y \u2212 [[A1,A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ad,X]] \u20162F + \u03b5 ]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\na\u03b2\n.\n(34)\nChecking q\u2217(\u03b2) in (32), it is easy to identify q\u2217(\u03b2) = Gamma(\u03b2|a\u03b2 , b\u03b2). Note that in (34), b\u03b2 is related to the number of dimensions and a\u03b2 estimates the residual of model fitting measured by the squared Frobenius norm. In order to calculate E[\u03b2], namely a\u03b2 in (34), we unfold the tensor and then expand the Frobenius norm as follows\nF =E [\u2225 \u2225Y \u2212 [[A1,A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ad,X]] \u2225 \u2225 2\nF\n]\n= Tr (\nd \u2299 i=1 ( AHi Ai )H \u00d7 ( MHXMX +MCX )H\n\u2212MX (\nd\u22c4 i=1 Ai\n)T\nY(d+ 1)H\n\u2212 Y(d+ 1) (\nd\u22c4 i=1 Ai\n)\u2217\nMHX\n)\n+ \u2225 \u2225Y(d+ 1) \u2225 \u2225 2\nF ,\n(35)\nwhere (35) holds true due to the fact of ( d\u22c4\nj=1 Bj)\nT ( d\u22c4\nj=1 Bj)\n\u2217 =\nd \u2299 j=1 BTj B \u2217 j [30], where d \u2299 j=1 BTj B \u2217 j = (B T 1 B \u2217 1) \u2299 (BT2 B\u22172) \u2299 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2299 (BTd B\u2217d) denotes the multiple Hadamard products.

However, it is\nconvex with respect to a single variational pdf q(\u0398j) if the others {q(\u0398i)|i 6= j} are fixed [40]. Hence, the proposed algorithm, which updates the optimal solution for each \u0398j , is a coordinate-descent optimization strategy in the functional space of variational distributions with each update of single unknown variable q(\u0398j) solving a convex problem. Consequently, this guarantees monotonic decrease of the KL divergence derived in (22), and also the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point. 2) Computational Complexity: For each iteration of the pro-\nposed algorithm, the computational complexity is measured in terms of matrix multiplications. That is, if A \u2208 Cm\u00d7n and B \u2208 Cn\u00d7m, then the computational complexity of matrix multiplication AB is O(m2n).

            "heading": "IV. SIMULATION RESULTS",
            "text": "In this section, we provide extensive simulation results to testify the performances of the proposed algorithm in LEO satellite IoT. The simulation parameters are set in Table II according to 3GPP TR 38.811 and TR 38.821. Generally, we use the error probability (Pe) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) to measure the accuracy of activity detection and channel estimation respectively, where NMSE is defined as ||X\u0302\u2212X||2F ||X||2F with X\u0302 being the estimate of device state matrix X.\nA. Impacts of Signal-to-Noise Ratio\nFirstly, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under various transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is defined as SNR , 10 log10(\u03be/\u03c3 2 n), where \u03be is the preamble transmit power and \u03c32n is the noise variance. In general, IoT devices are required to use low transmit power, such that they can have a long life cycle.\nIt is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 that under various transmit SNRs, the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point very fast. The required number of iterations is no more than 15. Hence, the proposed algorithm can be applied in LEO\n9 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nNumber of iterations Nit\n10-5\n10-4\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100 101 N M S E\nSNR=0 SNR=10 SNR=20 SNR=30\nFig. 4. Pe performances under various SNR. Related parameters are K = 500, pa = 0.1,M = 8, L = 400.\nsatellite IoT with time-varying environment. Moreover, with SNR=10 dB, it is possible to obtain low NMSE and Pe. As the transmit SNR increases, the NMSE and Pe decrease accordingly. In other words, we can improve the accuracy of channel estimation by increasing the transmit SNR.\nB. Impacts of Tensor Decomposition Rank\nIn this subsection, we explore the impacts of tensor decomposition on the proposed JADCE algorithm. In general, the length of preamble L can be factorized arbitrarily. However, for a given L, the number of factorizations d affects the performance of the proposed algorithm due to different degrees of freedom (DoF) per active device. Specifically, since a variable in Grassmannian of lines in dimension \u03c4i has \u03c4i\u22121 DoF [46], the average of sum-DoF of the active devices in the model can be calculated as E{DoF(K, pa)} = Kpa \u2211d\ni=1(\u03c4i \u2212 1). Therefore, given the total number of devices K and acitivity probability pa, the available DoF of d = 2 is higher than that of d = 3 and d = 4, leading to better detection and estimation performance. This is also confirmed by simulation results. As seen in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, with the increment of d, the NMSE and Pe performance degrades. Yet, the increment of d can reduce the computational complexity. Hence, we should choose a propoer d according to the requirements of LEO satellite IoT.\nC. Impacts of Preamble Length\nIt is widely known that the preamble length L has a great influence on the GF-RA performance of LEO satellite IoT. Given the requirements on NMSE and Pe, it is desired to use preamble sequences as short as possible, such that more duration in a time slot can be used for data transmission. Especially, for LEO satellite IoT, short packet is usually adopted to decrease the latency. In this context, it is necessary to improve the GF-RA performance with short preamble. In order to verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm, in this and following\n-10 -5 0 5 10 15\nSNR(dB)\n10-1\n100\nN M\nS E\nd = 2 d = 3 d = 4\nFig. 5.

Related parameters are K = 500, pa = 0.2, L = 225, M = 4.\nsubsections, we will compare it with three commonly-used JADCE algorithms, including Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm [18], Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SOMP) algorithm [47], and the algorithm in [43].\nAs shown in Fig. 7, as the preamble length L increases, the NMSE of the four JADCE algorithms decreases. In the whole preamble length region, the proposed algorithm performs best. Especially, as the preamble sequences become longer, the performance gain becomes larger. Similarly, for the Pe performance shown in Fig. 8, the proposed algorithm also performs best. For instance, at Pe = 10 \u22122, the proposed algorithm can decrease the required preamble length about 120 compared to the AMP algorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm is suitable to LEO satellite IoT.\nD. Impacts of Activity Probability\nLEO satellite IoT needs to support various IoT applications in different scenarios, e.g., ocean, mountain, and desert. In\n10\ngeneral, these IoT applications may have quite different device activity probabilities. In this subsection, we compare the proposed algorithm and the other baseline algorithms with different activity probabilities.\nAs seen in Fig. 9, for a given number of potential devices K = 500, as the activity probability Pa increases, the NMSE of the four JADCE algorithms increases. This is because the co-channel interference among active devices increases. The proposed algorithm still achieves the best performance, and the performance gain becomes larger as the activity probability increases. Moreover, it is shown in Fig. 10 that the proposed algorithm has the lowest Pe, and obtains Pe = 10 \u22124 even with Pa = 0.5. Thus, the proposed algorithm can satisfy the requirements of various IoT applications.\nE. Impacts of Total Number of Potential Devices\nWith the widespread applications of IoT, the number of IoT devices experiences an explosive increase. Hence, LEO\nsatellite IoT must admit a massive number of potential devices. In this subsection, we examine the capability of the proposed algorithm in the sense of massive connectivity. Fig. 11 shows the NMSE of the four JADCE algorithms with different numbers of potential devices for a given activity probability pa = 0.1. Intuitively, the NMSE of the four algorithms increases as the number of potential devices increases. Fortunately, the NMSE of the proposed algorithm increases very slightly when the number of potential devices increases from 200 to 800. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 12, the Pe of the proposed algorithm is also not sensitive to the number of potential devices. Hence, the proposed algorithm is able to support massive connectivity.\nIn summary, the proposed algorithm can support low power, massive connectivity and wide coverage of IoT applications. Therefore, it is appealing to LEO satellite IoT.\n11"
