While only a minor error in isolation this had widespread ramifications for the paper since a key unique aspect of the analysis was comparing the relative impact of stimulusand test-related factors on the association between nonverbal memory tests and identifying right (versus left) temporal lobe pathology. In addition, there were k = 10 papers on the BVRT, which is enough that it possibly meant that this could impact statistically on the results and therefore the interpretation and conclusions. The section within the Results entitled \u201cMeta-regression of Lateralization Effects By Stimulus Type and Test-related Moderators\u201d effectively required a complete rewrite. It was therefore considered essential to write this erratum. The remaining tests were thoroughly checked, and thankfully this type of error was not replicated elsewhere. In addition to the edits due to the coding error, there were some additional minor errors in the manuscript I have taken the opportunity to also correct.",

            "text": "Presurgical Patients Fig.\u00a03A shows that, for the additive meta-regression model, the moderators collectively did not have a significant effect on lateralization in presurgical patients (QM = 4.46, p = 0.48), and were not significant as individual moderators, ds < 0.06, ps > 0.35. Figure\u00a03B shows the interactive model was not significant overall, QM = 13.61, p = 0.26; however, there was a significant difference between two Stimulus groups (Faces > Designs, d\u00a0= -0.93, p\u00a0= .03), a significant effect of Format (Recall > Recognition, d\u00a0= 0.90, p\u00a0= .04), and a significant Learning x Format interaction (d\u00a0= -0.84, p\u00a0= 0.049).\nFig.\u00a0 3 Standardized effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d) and 95% confidence intervals of lateralization (left minus right TLE performance) for presurgical patients, by type of moderator analysis and individual moderator levels. Negative effect sizes indicate poorer performance for right than left TLE patients. Arrows indicate that the confidence intervals exceed the scale. Sample size (k, studies) inferential statistics, heterogeneity and fail-safe N measures are in Supplementary Table\u00a09. Contrasts used mean differences and t-statistic.\nThe results for Format were notable as Format was not significant in the additive model when the Stimulus factor was present (note that a Stimulus x Format interaction could not, by definition, be included in the interactive model as there were no Faces-Recall tests to complete all cross-combinations of Stimulus x Format). We therefore considered it possible that tests with design stimuli may be disproportionately explaining the right-lateralized Recall effect.\nTo explore these results further, contrasts with Bonferronicorrection to account for multiple comparisons (i.e., p = 0.05/2 = 0.025) showed that the right-lateralization effect for Faces-Recognition was not significantly larger than for Designs-Recognition, and the right-lateralization effect for Designs-Recall was not significantly larger than for\nDesigns-Recognition (see Fig.\u00a03D), together suggesting that the Stimulus effect (right-lateralized Faces) and Format effect (right-lateralized Recall) were independent.\nBonferroni contrasts to explore the Learning x Format effect (i.e., p = 0.05/3 = 0.017) showed a right-lateralization effect of Format (Recall > Recognition) that was stronger for tests with repeated learning trials than for tests with single learning trials (d = -0.10, p = .004), while the Format effect was not significant within individual learning trial (i.e., each of single and repeated learning trial types; see Fig.\u00a03E).\nFigure\u00a03C shows the results for specific moderator levels. Taken together, for presurgical patients, the small-sized performance decrement on nonverbal memory tests for RTLE versus LTLE patients was significantly moderated by both\nstimulus type and task-based factors (testing format on its own and interacting with learning format) of the nonverbal memory tests.\nPostsurgical Patients Fig.\u00a04A shows that for the additive meta-regression model, the moderators were significant as a group, QM = 20.43, p < 0.001, but there was only a borderline significant trend for the Stimulus effect on rightlateralization (Faces > Designs, d = -0.25, p = 0.052). No other moderators were significant. Figure\u00a04B shows the moderators were collectively significant for the interactive model, QM = 20.15, p = 0.003, with a significant effect of Format (Recognition > Recall, d = -0.38, p < 0.001), but no other moderators were significant.\nFig.\u00a0 4 Standardized effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d) and 95% confidence intervals of lateralization (left minus right TLR performance) for postsurgical patients, by type of moderator analysis and individual moderator levels. Negative effect sizes indicate poorer performance for right than left TLR patients. Sample size (k, studies) inferential statistics, heterogeneity and failsafe N measures are in Supplementary Table\u00a010. Contrasts used mean differences and t-statistic\nFor the same reasons as described in the section above for the presurgical sample, we used Bonferroni-corrected contrasts (i.e., p = 0.05/2 = 0.025) to determine whether this Format effect for the right TLR group was influenced by the borderline significant effect of Stimulus (see Fig.\u00a04D). These showed the right-lateralization effect for Designs-Recognition was significantly larger than for Designs-Recall, while the effect size for Faces-Recognition was not significantly larger than for Designs-Recognition (see Fig.\u00a04D). Therefore, when taken together, for postsurgical patients the lateralization effects (right < left performance) were affected by testing format (recognition > recall) that appeared to\novershadow and explain the effects of stimulus type (faces > designs).\nPostsurgical Change For postsurgical change, the additive meta-regression model showed that for left TLR patients the moderators were significant as a group, QM = 12.95, p = 0.01, with a significant effect of Format (Recognition more left-lateralized than Recall, d = 0.22, p = 0.4), but no other moderators were significant (see Fig.\u00a05A). The interactive model (Fig.\u00a05B) was also significant, QM = 15.15, p = 0.01, again with a significant effect of Format only (Recognition more left-lateralized than Recall, d = 0.25, p = 0.007).\nFig.\u00a0 5 Standardized effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d) and 95% confidence intervals of postsurgical change in performance (postsurgical minus presurgical) by hemisphere of TLR (left: black markers; right: white), type of moderator analysis and individual moderator levels. Negative effect sizes indicate poorer postsurgical than presurgical performance. Sample size (k, studies) inferential statistics, heterogeneity and fail-safe N measures are in Supplementary Tables\u00a011 (left TLR) and 12 (right TLR). Contrasts used mean differences and t-statistic\nTo determine whether this Format effect for the right TLR group was influenced by Stimulus (for the same reasons as described in the section above for the presurgical and postsurgical sample, see Fig.\u00a05D), we used Bonferroni-corrected contrasts. These showed no significant differences between Faces-Recognition and Designs-Recognition or between Designs-Recognition and Designs-Recall, suggesting that Stimulus did not confound the Format effect. For right TLR patients the additive and interactive analyses showed no significant lateralization effects."

            "text": "Page 12\nFor clarity we replace the entire second and third paragraph concerning the moderating effects of stimulus-related and task-related factors, and the initial section of the following paragraph, corrected version:\nThis study revealed several novel findings. Taking all nonverbal memory tests together, patients with RTLE performed slightly worse than patients with LTLE, in both the presurgical and postsurgical patient groups, with larger differences for the postsurgical group compared to the presurgical groups. For presurgical patients, lateralization effects (right < left) were consistently small and differed by stimulus type (faces > designs) and testing format (recall > recognition), in a manner that interacted with learning type, i.e., larger effect size change for repeated than single learning trials). For postsurgical patients, lateralization effects (right < left) also differed by format but in the opposite direction (recognition > recall), that appeared to overshadow and explain the borderline non-significant effects of stimulus type (faces > designs). Change in nonverbal memory performance following TLR showed an overall pattern of mild improvement in left TLR patients and no change in right TLR patients. In left TLR patients, the degree of improvement differed by format (recognition > recall) that appeared to overshadow and explain the borderline non-significant effects of stimulus type (faces > designs). In right TLR patients, the effect size was not significant and did not differ for any of the moderators. This advantage for recognition over recall was maintained when comparing postsurgical change for left and right TLR patients and did not appear to differ by the type of stimulus. Patient age (at the time of the assessment) had no significant effect on nonverbal memory performance in\nany patient sample, while patients with left TLR performed worse on nonverbal memory tests following surgery when the age of epilepsy onset was younger.\nOur meta-analysis shows that the testing format moderates the capacity of nonverbal memory tests to reveal memory decline following surgery (i.e., recognition > recall) for right TLR patients and that recognition tests better discriminate postsurgical change of left and right TLR patients. This suggests that a recognition format may more specifically test memory consolidation and storage functions linked to the medial temporal lobe than a recall format (Lowndes & Savage, 2007; Mayes et\u00a0al., 2007). In contrast, other test attributes including stimulus type, learning format and test delay did not impact the right-lateralization effect for the postsurgical change group (cf. Jones-Gotman et\u00a0al., 2000; Majdan et\u00a0al., 1996). For presurgical patients there was a more complex pattern that indicated a slight advantage of recall over recognition that depended on an interaction with learning type. The interpretation of this finding is less clear but suggests that for presurgical patients tests with particular combinations of learning and format type (e.g., learning with repeated trials, tested via recall) may on average slightly outperform tests with other combinations. Our findings support the recommendations of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE; Wilson et\u00a0al., 2015) report regarding the use of recognition testing alongside recall measures for comparison, from the same tests where applicable.\nPage 13\nFor the fifth paragraph under the heading \u201cLimitations and Further Research\u201d, we changed the original version of the first sentence:\nGiven the modest effect sizes of most tests examined and the lack of moderating effects of test-related factors on the capacity of nonverbal memory tests to indicate impairment in RTLE presurgical samples, there remains a clear and urgent need for improved tests to predict the effects of right temporal lobe pathology.\nTo the corrected version:\nGiven the modest effect sizes of most tests examined particularly for presurgical patients, there remains a clear and urgent need for improved tests to predict the effects of right temporal lobe pathology.\nFor the first sentence under \u201cConclusion\u201d we changed:\n\u201cThis comprehensive meta-analysis has shown the value of nonverbal recognition measures in detecting postsurgical change in right TLR patients.\u201d\nTo the corrected version:\nThis comprehensive meta-analysis has shown the value of nonverbal recall measures in detecting presurgical\nright TLE, and the value of recognition measures in detecting postsurgical performance in right TLR patients and postsurgical improvement in left TLR patients.\nThe original article has been corrected.\nPublisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."
