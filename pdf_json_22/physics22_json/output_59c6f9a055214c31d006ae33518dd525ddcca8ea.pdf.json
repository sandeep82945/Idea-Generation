In particular, several types of electronic interferometers have been considered in GaAs heterostructures, in order to protect the interfering electrons fromdecoherence. Nevertheless, it is now understood that several intrinsic decoherence sources fundamentally limit more advanced quantum manipulations. Here, we show that graphene offers a unique possibility to reach a regime where the decoherence is frozen and to study unexplored regimes of electron interferometry. We probe the decoherence of electron channels in a graphene quantum Hall PN junction, forming a Mach-Zehnder interferometer1,2, and unveil a scaling behavior of decay of the interference visibility with the temperature scaled by the interferometer length. It exhibits a remarkable crossover from an exponential decay at higher temperature to an algebraic decay at lower temperaturewhere almost no decoherence occurs, a regime previously unobserved in GaAs interferometers.\nThe field of electron quantumoptics relies on the analogy between the propagation of electrons in a quantum conductor and that of photons in quantumoptics experiments. This research field emerged in the late nineties with the possibility of manipulating electron beams in condensed matter systems while preserving their wave-particle nature. It has proven since then to grant a fundamental understanding of quantum electronics down to the single-particle excitation. The prototypical systems of electron quantum optics are two-dimensional conductors in the quantum Hall effect regime. This regime is reached under strong perpendicular magnetic field and is characterized by the existence of one-dimensional, chiral and dissipationless electronic channels propagating along the edges of the sample. Those quantum Hall edge channels canbedirectly viewed as the analogof opticalfibers for electrons. A large majority of these experiments has been performed in GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor heterostructures, where it has been shown that decoherence can stem from different sources: edge reconstruction by disorder3, intra-channel Coulomb interactions within a single edge channel4,5, and inter-channelCoulomb interactions between adjacent edge channels6\u20138. The lattermechanism is thought to be the main hindrance in realizing complex quantum circuits with quantum Hall edge channels in GaAs, and has received considerable theoretical and experimental attention. In particular, recent experiments have shown that it can be diminished by a somewhat cumbersome engineering of the edge channels9,10. Despite this, identifying decoherence sources remains an open problem, with e.g. several previouslyoverlookeddissipationmechanisms that have been put into light in the last few years11,12, and experimental observations that are still debated after more than a decade13,14. Probing decoherence in quantum Hall edge channels realized in different 2D materials potentially allows tackling this issue, by providing an apparently similar system whose intrinsic parameters (e.g. electron velocity, capacitive coupling and screening, geometry) are nonetheless sufficiently\nReceived: 8 October 2021\nAccepted: 30 August 2022\nCheck for updates\n1SPEC, CEA,CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CEA Saclay, 91191Gif sur Yvette, Cedex, France. 2Department of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34141, Korea. 3National Institute for Materials Science, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba 305-0044, Japan. 4NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1Morinosato-Wakamiya, Atsugi 243-0198, Japan. 5These authors contributed equally:M.

            "text": "In our PN junction, a graphene monolayer is encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride layers, and the density of the left and right halves are controlled independently using bottom and top gates, where the former (resp. latter) is covering the whole sample (resp. only the right half), as shown in Fig. 1a and the \u201csample description\u201d section in the SupplementaryMaterial. Under a perpendicularmagneticfield, the left half becomes a P region of filling factor \u03bdp = \u22121. Along the boundary of the P region, a spin-up channel circulates clockwise. The right half is an N region of \u03bdn = 2. Along its boundary, two channels having opposite spin circulate counterclockwise. As a result, the junction interface has the three co-propagating channels. The two spin-up channels have opposite valley-isospin1. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer is formed at the PN interface by applying the top and bottom side gates (see Fig. 1). Along the top edge, the injected current I0 is carried by the two edge channels of the N region. Half of the current, resulting from spin down carriers, cannot flow to the P region, because of large energy cost for spin flip. The other half I0/2 with spin up carriers, on which we focus hereafter, can contribute to the transmitted current IT. Therefore the transmission probability was measured as TMZ = IT / (I0/2). The filling factors \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 below the side gates are controlled independently. In the \u201clarge\u201d interferometer, \u03bdi = 1,2 = \u22121 (see the first panel of Fig. 1b). In this case, the spin-up channels from the P and N regions collide at the top and bottom \u201cedge\u201d intersections of the PN interface with the graphene edge below the side gates, leading to formation of their beam splitters (which are called valley splitters2). The atomic structure of the graphene edge causes sharp potential change at the edge intersection, hence, scattering between the spin-up channels having opposite valley-isospin15,16. The two spin-up channels co-propagating along the PN interface and their beam splitters at the top and bottom edge intersections constitute the large interferometer that exhibits transmission oscillations of period \u0394B = 20mT as a function of the magnetic field (note that this period is slightly different from the one reported in ref. 2 although it is the same device. Between the two measurements, the experimental setup has been deeply modified. It also corresponds to two different cooldowns with different gate voltages and edge electrostatics). The arm length of the large interferometer is estimated as L = 1.5\u03bcmfrom the samplegeometry (see the \u201csample geometry\u201d section in the Supplementary Material). When a side gate is further tuned to have \u03bd1 = 0 or \u03bd2 = 0, the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations disappear as reported in refs. 1, 2, but they reappear in certain ranges of the side gate voltage (see the \u201ctuning length of the interferometer\u201d section in the Supplementary Material). Two different periods \u0394B = 34.5mT and 81mT of the reappeared Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are observed (see the second and third panels of Fig. 1b), and they are much larger than the period \u0394B = 20 mT of the large\nFig. 1 | Experimental setup and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. a Schematic representation of the PN junction.

In the intermediate one, the top beam splitter is formed at the intersection with the edge, while the bottom splitter is at the intersectionwith the \u03bd =0 region in the bulk. In the small one, the two beam splitters are formed in the bulk. c TMZ oscillations of the large interferometer plotted at different temperature. The absence of temperature dependence of the average TMZ unambiguously ruled out the effect of the temperature on the intervalley scattering rate.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:5473 2\ninterferometer. The disappearance is due to the fact that an edge intersection, hence a beam splitter there, cannot be formed below the side gate of \u03bd =0, because of spatial separation of the channel of the P region from those of the N region by the \u03bd = 0 region. The interesting reappearance of the Aharonov-Bohmoscillations, accompanied by the periods much larger than that of the large interferometer, implies the formation of a beamsplitter not at the edge intersection but at another position below the side gate. The only possible position, where the channels fromtheP andN regions cancollide, is the \u201cbulk\u201d intersection of the PN interface with the \u03bd = 0 region inside the graphene bulk (see the schematic views in Fig. 1b). The resulting interferometers are smaller than the large one; in the \u201cintermediate\u201d interferometer, \u03bd1 = \u22121 and \u03bd2 = 0, while \u03bdi = 1,2 = 0 in the \u201csmall\u201d interferometer. Their interferometer length is estimated as L = 1.05 \u03bcm and 0.62\u03bcm from the location of the bulk intersections in the sample geometry (see Supplementary Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material). The ratios of the estimated lengths of the three interferometers match with those of their Aharonov-Bohmperiods; small mismatch can be interpreted that the spacing between the two interferometer arms (the two spin-up interface channels) slightly differs between the interferometers, depending on the filling factor of the side-gate regions. So it is concluded that a beam splitter is formed inside the bulk rather than at the edgewhen \u03bdi = 1,2 = 0. The originof the beam splitter (namely, the valley mixing) at the bulk intersectionsmay be atomic defects, as reported in recent STM experiments17 on the same source of graphene as ours (NGS graphenium flakes), or many-body states at \u03bd =0. The arms of the three interferometers are expected to be similar. The gate configurations of the three interferometers are the same in the regionbetween the side gates, anddifferent below the side gates. A recent calculation18 studying edge-channel reconstruction along a PN interface, based on the Chklovski-Shklovskii-Glazman model, estimates that for the gate configuration of our experiment, the spacing between the two arms is 102 nm / 90 nm in the presence/absence of the side gates. Note that this estimation is comparable with 110 nm/ 83 nm obtained from the experimental Aharonov-Bohm period of the large/small interferometer2. Therefore, the side gates change the properties of the arm not largely, and it is reasonable to compare the interferometers based on their arm length difference as the first approximation. We study the interference visibility Vis=(TMZ,max \u2013 TMZ,min)/ (TMZ,max + TMZ,min), where TMZ,max (min) is the maximum (minimum) value of the oscillation of TMZ (see Fig. 1c). We first discuss thermal decoherence. Figure 2a shows the interference visibility normalized by V0, that is the visibility at base temperature, as a function of\nFig. 2 | Scaling behavior of thermal decoherence. a Thermal decay of the interference visibility Vis in log scale for the three interferometers. V0 is the visibility measured at the fridge base temperature. The visibility is defined as: Vis=(TMZ,maxTMZ,min)/(TMZ,max+ TMZ,min)=Td/Ts with Td = TMZ,max- TMZ,min and Ts = TMZ,max+ TMZ,min. Td and Ts and their associated errors \u03b4Td and \u03b4Ts are obtained from the fit. Visibility\u2019s error bar is given by \u03b4Vis=(Ts*\u03b4 Td \u2013 Td*\u03b4 Ts)/ (Ts) 2. b Thermal decay of the interference visibility Vis in log scale for the two intermediate interferometer configurations. c The decay is redrawn with scaled temperature LT/L0 where T is temperature, L is the interferometer length, and L0 is the length of the large\ninterferometer. The decayof the three interferometer lies on the same curve, which is in good agreement with an intra-channel interaction model. In the theory, we choose the parameters of v =4.4 \u00d7 104m/s and g = 3.3.dVoltage spectral density as a function of the frequency for different refrigerator temperature. The red curves are the theoretical fits given by the Johnson-Nyquist noise of the circuit which is composed of the sample resistance in parallel with an RLC resonator. The gain of the amplification chain is extracted from the fit. e Average current noise as a function of temperature.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:5473 3\ntemperature. Notably, the interference persists above 1.5 K, a temperature much higher than the usual operating temperature of the GaAs edge channels. Below 1 K, the visibility decays not exponentially, but algebraically, which means that thermal decoherence is suppressed. The crossover temperature from the algebraic to exponential regime becomes higher for the smaller interferometers. We have also measured the interference visibility as a function of the temperature for the two intermediate configurations (\u03bd1 = \u22121, \u03bd2 = 0 and \u0394B = 34.5 mT or \u03bd1 = 0, \u03bd2 = \u22121 and \u0394B = 39 mT) and observe the same behavior (see in Fig. 2b). The graphene interface channels are quite robust against thermal decoherence even around 1 K and the coherence length, extracted from the exponential decay regime, is 1.24\u03bcm at 1 K.\nWe note that the algebraic decay does not originate from heating effects. Heating effects are excluded in our case by measurement of electron temperature through the Johnson-Nyquist noise (see the \u201cnoise setup\u201d section in the Supplementary Material). We use homemade cryogenic amplifiers combined to a LC tank circuit at 2.2MHz to avoid the 1/f noise generated by the amplifiers\u2019 HEMT and the parasitic noise induced by the dry dilution refrigerator vibrations. After a second stage of amplification at room temperature, the voltage fluctuations are digitized with an acquisition card and the noise spectral density is computed for different refrigerator temperatures (see Fig. 2d). The current fluctuations of the Hall resistance are given by SI =\n4kBTe RH\nwith kB the Boltzmann constant, Te the electronic temperature and RH = h 2e2 : The average value of SI is linear down to a refrigerator temperature of 25mK (Fig. 2e), confirming that electrons are perfectly thermalized.\nRemarkably, the visibility curves lie on a single curvewhenplotted with temperature scaled by the interferometer length L with a clear crossover from an algebraic to an exponential decay of the visibility that has never been observed in conventional semiconductors (see Fig. 2c). Namely, the visibility does not dependon temperature and the length independently, but only on the product of the two. The crossover temperature, which is inversely proportional to L, is 350mK in the large interferometer. Note that the scaling behavior is satisfied over the large length variation by 300%. This confirms the formation of the interferometers and the beam splitters at the bulk intersections when \u03bdi = 1,2 = 0, and also validates that the algebraic decay does not originate from electron heating. In the following we discuss the different decoherence mechanisms that lead to such a scaling behavior.\nThe algebraic decay implies suppression of thermal decoherence. The algebraic decay has not been reported in GaAs interferometers;\nthere has been a report on a non-exponential decay that may originate from heating effects14. By contrast, in our graphene interferometers being ten times smaller than the GaAs ones13,14, the universal crossover is clearly observed. The scaling behavior requires a decoherence mechanism to follow the scaling with the interferometer length or have a length scale much longer or shorter than the interferometer length. This excludes disorders or small charge puddles of the bulk from the mechanism. As possible mechanisms, one can cite interchannel interactions between adjacent interface channels and intrachannel interactions. The short-range inter-channel interactions can cause decoherence through fractionalization of electron flow into slow and fast modes as in the GaAs edge channels7,8. We will show in the following that this latter mechanism is negligible and that the interchannel interactions are dominated by the intra-channel interactions.\nTo compare an intra-channel interaction model with our experimental observations, we consider a simple capacitive Hamiltonian5,\nHint = EC P\n\u03b1 = l,r Q\u0302\u03b1=e Ng\n2 , \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Q\u0302\u03b1 = l,r is the charge inside the left and right interferometer arms respectively, Ng is a reference charge number determined by the gate voltages, EC = gv_= 2L\u00f0 \u00de is the charging energy, v is the drift velocity, and g is a dimensionless interaction parameter. Physically, when an electron enters an interferometer arm, charge density fluctuations in the arm provide which-path information through the capacitive interaction, reducing the interference. The interference visibility, computed with the intra-channel interaction model, satisfies the scaling behavior (Methods), exhibits a universal crossover from the algebraic to the exponential regime, andfits verywell the experimental thermal decay (Fig. 2c). The crossover happens at the temperature T ~ _v=\u00f0kBL\u00de comparable with the single-particle level spacing. In the algebraic regime below the crossover temperature, the electron thermal length is longer than the interferometer arms, hence the thermal charge fluctuations and the resulting decoherence by the interaction are suppressed.\nBy contrast, inter-channel interactions are negligible. We observe the evolution of the visibility with the temperature as we add additional PN interface channels by changing their respective filling factors. In Fig. 3, the visibility decay for (\u03bdn, \u03bdp) = (4,\u22121) ismoreor less similar to the (2,\u22121) case, and the decay for (2,\u22122) is stronger only slightly. Theoverall\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:5473 4\nsimilarities among the decay curves indicate that the inter-channel interactions are not the dominant source of the dephasing, although they may not be completely suppressed. This observation is supported by the geometry of the sample and the configuration of the edge channels. First, in the sample geometry, the vertical distance (30 \u2212 50 nm) between the gates and the graphene layer is shorter than the spacing (50 \u2212 60nm) between two adjacent edge channels leading to screening of the inter-channel interactions; the spacing is indicated, with assuming a symmetric PN junction, by the 110 nm spacing between the two arms estimated2 from the Aharonov-Bohm period. This is in sharp contrast with the GaAs edge channels, where the distance between the edge channels and the top gates is typically 90 \u2212 100nm. Note that in our geometry, theN region hasmore screening of the interchannel interactions than the P region, since it is more affected by the top gate. Second, in the (\u03bdn, \u03bdp)= (2, \u22121) case, the additional channel is sandwiched between the interferometer arms along the PN interface so that its interaction with the left armwill be similar to its interaction with the right arm if the interactions are present. When it interacts with the two arms equally, our theoretical calculation (see the \u201ctheoretical models\u201d section in the Supplementary Material) shows that no decoherence is induced by the interaction. Instead, to fit the thermal visibility decay in Fig. 2 by the calculation based on the inter-channel interaction, it is required that one arm interacts with the additional channel about 10 times more strongly than the other arm. This asymmetry is unlikely in our setup. In the (2, \u22122) case, on the other hand, another additional channel is formed outside of the interferometer in the P region, resulting in asymmetry in its interactionwith the two arms. In this case, the inter-channel interaction can cause, yet weak, decoherence. In the (4, \u22121) case, the two more channels are added in the N region in comparison with the (2, \u22121) case, and they are far apart from the interferometer arms, so decoherence by them will be negligible. These suggest that the inter-channel interactions do not provide the dominant decoherence mechanism. Next, we examine non-equilibrium decoherence by a finite bias voltage applied to the large interferometer at (\u03bdn, \u03bdp) = (2, \u22121). Figure 4 shows the voltage dependence of the visibility, which is called the lobe pattern14,19\u201321. In the pattern, a dip occurs near 220 \u03bcV and a single side lobe appears at larger voltages. Interestingly, Fig. 4 shows that the pattern depends onlyweakly on the beamsource, i.e., whether the bias voltage is applied to the upper right ohmic contact (biasing the two edge channels of the N region) or the upper left contact (biasing the single edge channel of the P region). This feature is in contrast with the GaAs interferometers at \u03bd = 2, whose lobe pattern depends largely on whether a bias voltage is applied to only one14,19,20 or the two edge\nregion. Note that the DC bias VDC is inverted in b for comparison. c Interference visibility as a function ofVDC in the cases a, b. It is measured at 9 T. The similarity of the lobe pattern between a, b implies that inter-edge interactions between the interface channels are weak.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:5473 5\nchannels21 because of inter-channel interactions. Note that our intrachannel interactions model qualitatively reproduces the lobe pattern (see the \u201ctheoretical models\u201d section in the Supplementary Material). This confirms that contrary to conventional GaAs interferometers, decoherence in graphene in the quantum Hall regime effect is dominated by intra-channel interactions.\nBefore concluding, wemention recent related works on graphene Fabry-P\u00e9rot interferometers22,23. In22 the thermal decay of the interference visibility of the Fabry-P\u00e9rot interferometer is discussed for different lengths of the interferometer. The decay is only exponential; no algebraic decay is found probably due to the presence of etch defined edges24. However, in a gate defined interferometer23, no saturation of the visibility at low temperature is observed. The extracted coherence lengthof 8.1 \u00b5mat 32mk is 4.78 times smaller than in the presentMZI. A smaller coherence length associatedwith a larger area may explain the absence of visibility saturation at low temperature in a graphene Fabry-P\u00e9rot."

Indeed, the onedimensional dissipationless quantum Hall edge channels form an ideal and tunable propagation medium for quantum coherent singleelectron wave-packets, the spatial trajectories of which encode the information to process. The basic building blocks of this so-called flying qubit approach were demonstrated in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. However, the limited phase coherence length in this material (\u223c20\u03bcm at 20mK) critically hampers the development of complex multi-qubit architectures needed for quantum information processing. To circumvent thismajor issue, a newparadigm in termsof material is necessary.\nIn this work we perform a detailed study of the decoherence processes in a graphene Mach-Zehnder interferometer. While we observe the usual exponential thermal decay of the visibility at high temperature, below a crossover temperature (\u223c350mK) the decoherence is suppressed. We expect that the presence of the top and bottomgates close to the graphene layer screens interactions between co-propagating edge states, a large source of decoherence. We finally reach a regimewhere intra channel interactions are themain source of decoherence. Thepossibility towork in a regimewhere decoherence is suppressed makes graphene a very promising platform for applications to flying qubits25\u201327, orbital entanglement generation28,29 and valleytronics30."

Nevertheless, it is also shown that the maximum visibility is 60%. It remains unclear why we could not reach 100%. We note I0 the injected current. The definition of the transmission TMZ depends on the injected current and the pn junction configuration. In the \u03bdL = \u22121 / \u03bdR = +2 configuration, there is a spectator edge state that does not participate to the interference. The interfering edge states carry the same spin while the spectator edge state carries an opposite spin. The energy cost to flip the spin at 9 T is given by the Zeeman energy g\u00b5B= 1mV that is much larger than the electronic temperature: T = 25mK corresponds to V = kBT/e = 1.2\u00b5V. Therefore, the spectator edge channel is fully reflected and half of the current cannot be transmitted leading to a definition of theMZI transmission TMZ = IT/(I0/\n2).
