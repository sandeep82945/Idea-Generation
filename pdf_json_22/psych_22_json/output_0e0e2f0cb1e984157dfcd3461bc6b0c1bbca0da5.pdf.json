    "abstractText": "The delayed access to cancer treatment due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic posed a unique challenge to breast cancer patients and caused a significant level of mental distress among them. In the current research, we examined the psychological impacts of COVID on a subpopulation of breast cancer patients from a hospital in Shaanxi province of China using Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R). Participants were 195 breast cancer patients at the outpatient clinic of Xijing hospital, Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi Province, China. We found that a treatment delay of more than 3 weeks may exacerbate breast cancer patients\u2019 psychological symptoms, such as somatization, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism, whereas a short-term delay of less than 3 weeks is less likely to have a significant effect on one\u2019s mental well-being. Additionally, breast cancer survivors, especially those at more advance stages, tend to experience more elevated psychological symptoms with longer treatment delay, and whose treatments continues to be delayed reported stronger psychological symptoms than individuals whose treatment are resumed, regardless of treatment type.",

In the current research,\nwe\u00a0 examined the psychological impacts of COVID on a subpopulation of\nbreast cancer patients from a hospital in Shaanxi province of China using\nSymptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R).

In response to the rampant spread of the virus, the central government of China imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, including the suspension of public transportation and temporary closure of schools, government offices, and factories (Wei et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, due to the strong transmission capacity and the high mortality rate of 12% in the epicenter at the early stage of its outbreak (Mizumoto and Chowell, 2020), COVID put unprecedented strain on the Chinese healthcare system.\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 10 November 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1003016"

Numerous studies have reported delays in all aspects of cancer care and treatments, including screening, diagnosis, surgery, and follow-up visits (Li et\u00a0al., 2020; Papautsky and Hamlish, 2020). The mental distress caused by the COVID lockdown, coupled with the existential concerns raised by delayed access to life-sustaining treatment, increase cancer patients\u2019 risks of experiencing adverse mental health impact.\nCOVID posed a unique challenge to breast cancer patients. Empirical research suggests that breast cancer patients, compared to healthy controls, are more likely to experience psychosocial distress and self-esteem crisis due to body image disruption (Pan et\u00a0al., 2014), and they may develop a stronger need for positive affirmations to alleviate body image anxiety. However, social distancing measures and quarantine policies hamper close interpersonal contacts and potentially reduce one\u2019s likelihood of obtaining positive affirmations, which may in turn cause mental distress. Also, research has shown that cancer survivors may experience feelings of uncertainty even after years of diagnosis due to fear of recurrence (Karlsson, 2014), which increases their chance of depression and anxiety (Parker et\u00a0 al., 2013). The pandemic has brought a substantial level of uncertainty to people worldwide. This uncertainty might be\u00a0 particularly intense for breast cancer survivors whose pre-COVID life following cancer diagnosis had already been inundated with unpredictability.\nApproximately 30% of breast cancer patients experienced mental distress before the advent of COVID (Fradelos et\u00a0al., 2017; Hajian et\u00a0al., 2017). Given that COVID tends to evoke existential anxiety and terror among the general public (Pyszczynski et\u00a0al., 2021), some breast cancer patients may be\u00a0 exposed to more substantial psychological stress than pre-COVID level because the virus reminds them of vulnerability and mortality. In addition, research suggested that COVID indeed put cancer patients\u2019 lives at stake. For example, a recent study has found that from January 2020 to February 2020, cancer patients in Hubei, Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID pandemic, had nearly a threefold higher fatality rate from COVID than healthy individuals (Dai et\u00a0al., 2020), and the efficacy rate of vaccination for cancer survivors who are immunocompromised might still be\u00a0 lower than non-cancer individuals (National Cancer Institute, 2021). The fact that breast cancer patients are likely to have an increased risk of severe illness and fatality may further exacerbate their existential terror. Thus, void of interpersonal contact and uncertainty, in addition to existential concerns, feeling of vulnerability, and the high mortality rate of COVID, are potentially risk factors for psychopathology during COVID.\nSymptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) has by far been one of the most widely used psychometrics to measure individuals\u2019 general psychopathology (Tian et\u00a0al., 2020), and extensive studies have found satisfactory psychometric reliability and validity of the\nscale (Prinz et\u00a0al., 2013; Carrozzino et\u00a0al., 2016; Chen et\u00a0al., 2020). Empirical research demonstrated a positive association between breast cancer status and general psychopathology based upon the SCL90-R factor scores (Pan et\u00a0 al., 2014). Studies also used SCL-90-R factor scores to measure the effect of COVID on the mental wellbeing of the general public. For example, Chinese nationals reported higher SCL-90-R factor scores from January 2020 to February 2020, when all cities were under partial lockdown and public facilities were closed, than the pre-COVID culture norm (Tian et\u00a0al., 2020).\nHowever, despite that some previous research examined the effects of COVID on the general psychological status of Chinese breast cancer patients (Bartmann et\u00a0al., 2021; see also Cui et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2020), to the best of our knowledge, no research thus far has investigated how molecular types, cancer stages, treatment status, and the length and types of treatment delay individually and collectively impact the psychological health of breast cancer patients. Severe mental distress as result of the interplay between COVID lockdown, existential anxiety, and delay of life-saving cancer treatment may become serious threats to breast cancer patients\u2019 physical and mental wellbeing. Therefore, it is imperative for psychologists and clinical researchers to identify the psychological impacts of treatment delay on breast cancer patients at various cancer stages with different molecular types and develop coping strategies to help them maintain psychological wellbeing during trying times such as COVID. In an effort to fill in the research gap, this study aims to a) evaluate the psychological wellbeing of a subpopulation of breast cancer patients from Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi Province, following the surge of COVID outbreak when their city was under partial lockdown, healthcare facilities were closed, and cancer care was temporarily disrupted, and b) examine how treatment status, cancer stage, length and type of treatment delay, and patients\u2019 specific molecular type independently and interactively affect breast cancer patients\u2019 mental health."

Due to the social distancing requirements during COVID, the study was conducted virtually, and the questionnaires were distributed to the participants via Wenjuanxing, the Chinese alternative of Qualtrics. The researchers were healthcare workers affiliated with Xijing hospital. The survey link was sent to a breast cancer patient WeChat support group which included 1,399 cancer patients and 6 healthcare workers. The patients were told that the study aimed to examine the effect of COVID on their mental health and the status of their cancer treatment, and they could voluntarily choose whether they would like to participate in the study or not. The initial\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nsample consisted of 199 breast cancer patients who previously obtained treatment at Xijing hospital but whose treatments were delayed due to COVID lockdowns. All participants signed an informed consent form that described the purpose of the study and the fact that if they agreed to participate in the study, their responses would be\u00a0 analyzed for clinical research, and their identifying information would be\u00a0collected but kept confidential. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) diagnosed with breast cancer, (b) aged 18 years or above, (c) able to read and comprehend simplified Chinese. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) patients with severe cognitive impairment (i.e., retrograde and anterograde amnesia), (b) previous diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (i.e., depression, schizophrenia, or post-traumatic stress disorder), or (c) multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. After eliminating participants who provided partial response or withdrew from the study, the final sample was comprised of 195 individuals.\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Xijing hospital, and the goal of the IRB is to prevent harm and protect patients\u2019 rights.\nSurvey tools and survey method\nUpon signing the informed consent form, participants answered questions regarding their age, marital status, education level, general health status, breast cancer stage, molecular type, and the duration of treatment. Then, participants reported whether there was a direct effect of COVID on their city on a two-point dichotomous scale, followed by a set of questions regarding the length and type of treatment delayed due to COVID as well as the current status of treatment. The treatment types included surgery, adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy \u00b1 target therapy, endocrine therapy, target therapy only, radiotherapy, advanced therapy, and routine check-ups. The current status of treatment was measured on a two-point scale: continue to be\u00a0delayed and resumed. The molecular types are classified as HR+ HER2\u2212, HER2+, and triple negative.\nThe validated Mandarin version of the SCL-90-R (Wang, 1984) was then given to the participants to evaluate their psychological status. The SCL-90 checklist is a self-report psychometric instrument that studies one\u2019s subjective symptoms of psychopathology, consisting of 90 items from nine symptom dimensions: somatization, interpersonal anxiety, obsessive\u2013 compulsive, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism (Sereda and Dembitskyi, 2016). Seven additional items measured participants\u2019 sleep and appetite disturbance. Each dimension was measured on a fivepoint Likert-type format (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely). Previous studies consistently reported that SCL-90-R is a valid inventory, with adequate construct validity and high factorial validity (see Ransom et\u00a0al., 2010; Ardakani et\u00a0al., 2016; Sereda and Dembitskyi, 2016). Additionally, according to our data, the scale was highly reliable and internally consistent (\u03b1 = 0.92). Thus, we\u00a0computed the mean of all subscales into the overall index of psychological symptoms, known as the general psychopathology score."

            "text": "COVID has spread to more than 70 countries and has become a global health crisis. The pandemic dramatically impacted people worldwide and has posed an unprecedented challenge to breast cancer patients\u2019 psychosocial well-being. Previous studies have applied the SCL-90-R psychometric measures to examine the psychological impact of COVID on the general public and cancer survivors. However, this study extended beyond previous literature and investigated the separate and joint effects of breast cancer stage, length and type of treatment delay, and molecular type on patients\u2019 psychological status.\nA major finding in this study is that cancer survivors at an advanced stage of breast cancer are more likely to experience psychological symptoms with longer treatment delay, and cancer patients whose treatments continues to be\u00a0 delayed reported elevated psychological symptoms than individuals whose treatment are resumed, regardless of treatment type. Additionally, a treatment delay of more than 3 weeks may exacerbate breast cancer patients\u2019 psychological symptoms, whereas a short-term delay of less than 3 weeks is less likely to have a significant effect on one\u2019s mental well-being. Therefore, to protect the physical and mental well-being of advanced-stage breast cancer patients during trying times such as COVID, delay in cancer treatment should not\nexceed 3 weeks. Also, our results suggest that perceived health status more significantly predicts one\u2019s psychological well-being than cancer stage. This finding has an essential implication as it highlights the importance of building health confidence in breast cancer care.\nGiven that strengthening health confidence may improve one\u2019s perceived health status, future research should develop interventions to improve cancer survivors\u2019 health confidence. This study also found that younger age was associated with higher interpersonal sensitivity and hostility. These results are in line with empirical research findings that altered body image due to cancer treatment leads to stronger body image concerns for younger women (Manier et\u00a0 al., 2018), which tends to reduce their self-esteem and, in turn, leads to fear of interpersonal interaction. This finding might be\u00a0valuable for caregivers, who should provide breast cancer survivors with positive affirmations to help them regain confidence and maintain meaningful social relationships with trustworthy friends.\nThe current study found a significant interaction effect of breast cancer stage and length of treatment delay on the general psychological health, such that longer treatment delay elevates participants\u2019 psychological symptoms, especially for those at more advanced stages. However, our data are preliminary, as the study\u2019s participants only consist of a subpopulation of breast cancer patients in China, whose post-COVID treatment experience may not be\u00a0representative of the experience of breast cancer patients in different regions of China. What is more, the sample size for some of our subgroups (i.e., Stage IV breast cancer) are relatively small,\nFIGURE\u00a03 The effect of delayed treatment type on general psychopathology score. The delay of chemotherapy had a significant effect on breast cancer patients\u2019 general psychopathology score.\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nwhich might have weakened the power of some of our analyses. A follow-up study could sample a larger number of breast cancer patients from various regions and religions to examine whether factors such as region-based differences and beliefs affect people\u2019s psychological health.\nAdditionally, research has shown that the median age of breast cancer onset for Asian women is 56 (Stapleton et al., 2018). However, a disproportionately large percentage of this study\u2019s participants were 55 years or below. This might be\u00a0due to the fact that the survey was administered online, and older people, in general, have worse eyesight and are less technologically adept than their younger counterparts. Thereby, although some people would be\u00a0willing to participate in the study if it was administered in the paper format or through a phone call interview, they did not attempt the online survey because of technological challenges. Some other people might have attempted the survey but could not finish due to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, or poor eyesight. Future replication studies could address the limitations by administering the survey in different formats based on participants\u2019 age and preferences. For people who have difficulties completing the survey online, a phone call survey could be\u00a0offered as an alternative.\nFurthermore, some participants might face stressors in their lives that others do not. For example, in addition to their cancer diagnosis and COVID-related existential threat, some people may be\u00a0impacted by additional stressors such as financial insecurity,\nloss of a loved one, or lack of support from their family members. \u00a0Thus, some breast cancer patients\u2019 elevated general psychopathology scores might not be\u00a0 the sole effect of their advanced stage or COVID-related treatment delay. A follow-up study could compare participants\u2019 psychological symptoms at the peak of the pandemic with the baseline level when COVID ends and the stressors due to cancer delays are removed to examine the extent to which delay in treatment contributes to participants\u2019 aggravated psychological symptoms."

            "text": "In summary, our study found that longer treatment delay is associated with higher somatization obsessive\u2013compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism among the participants, and treatment delay of more than 3 weeks leads to more acute psychological symptoms, especially for breast cancer patients at more advance stages. However, the results of the study is preliminary and left several questions unanswered. To rule out alternative explanations for some of our results, follow-up research should recruit participants from more diverse backgrounds and compare participants\u2019 psychological status with baseline level when stressors due to COVID-induced treatment delays are eliminated.\nTABLE\u00a02 Results of multiple regression analyses."
