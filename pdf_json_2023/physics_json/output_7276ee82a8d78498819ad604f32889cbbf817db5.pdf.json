EL-Deeb,b Ahmed A. Farghali,c H. El Molld and Abdalla Abdelwahab *ce\nThe slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limits the large-scale usage of the fuel cells. Thus,\nit is crucial to develop an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for the ORR. Herein, facile synthesis of three-\ndimensional nitrogen-doped carbon xerogel diamond nanoparticles, CDNPs support is reported. The as-\nprepared CDNPs support was functionalized with a Keggin-type polyoxomolybdate via the hydrothermal\nprocess (POM@CDNPs). As the characterization techniques revealed, this nanocomposite possesses\na three-dimensional structure, high density of nitrogen doping, and well-dispersed porous pyramidal\nmorphology of POM, making it a promising catalyst for ORR in alkaline medium. The POM@CDNPs\nnanocomposite exhibits an outstanding activity for ORR with a limiting current density that reaches \u22127.30 mA cm\u22122 at 0.17 V vs. RHE. Moreover, a half-wave potential of 0.773 V is delivered with a stability of about 99.9% after the 100th repetitive cycle as this catalyst forces the ORR to the direct-four-electron pathway. This work spots the advantages of hybridizing the sp3 of the nanodiamond with the sp2 of the\ncarbon xerogels to increase the conductivity of the support material. In addition, the role of the porous\npyramidal morphology of the POM on the activity of the nanocomposite was evaluated. This study\nsuggests using advanced carbon-based electro-catalysts with outstanding activity and stability."

In the fuel cells, two reactions are carried out at the anode and cathode. At the anode, a fuel such as hydrogen or methanol is oxidized, while at the cathode an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs. Unfortunately, the reaction kinetics of oxygen reduction is very slow, implying that high reduction potentials are required which in turn decreases the fuel cell's performance and limits their market use. Therefore, the use of an efficient electrocatalyst (EC) is crucial and of great importance for developing the ORR kinetics and the overall fuel cell performance.\nPlatinum, Pt, and its alloys are considered the most effective electro-catalysts (ECs) for the ORR which provide low ORR overpotentials, large current densities, and are selective for the direct four-electron pathway.4\u20136 However, platinum-based electro-catalysts are not considered the best solutions for increasing the ORR kinetics as they suffer from several drawbacks such as scarcity, high cost, and poisoning of Pt by the CO intermediate species which results in poor stability and durability.7\nDuring the past few years, the research is directed to nd a platinum-free electro-catalyst with satisfying activity and durability.

View Article Online chemical and thermal stabilities.8\u201310 Additionally, carbon nanomaterials doped with different transition metal oxides are used as a support material to enhance activity and stability.11\u201314\nCarbon nanomaterials can also be doped with nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorous, and the results showed that nitrogen-doped carbon has the best performance towards ORR among their alternatives.1,15 The development of ORR activity of carbon upon doping with nitrogen or another dopant is due to the increase of electroactive sites on high surface area and enhanced conductivity.\nIn ORR application, various carbon-based electrocatalysts were employed such as carbon nanotubes,16 graphene,17 and carbon xerogels. In this context, nitrogen-doped carbon xerogels (C) are novel carbon materials comprising sp2-bonded carbon atoms, high specic surface areas, and an open threedimensional porous structure. This porous structure allows for enhancing the transport and diffusion of ions, resulting in better ORR performance. Moreover, diamond nanoparticles (DNPs) are new carbon allotropes with a combination of sp2 and sp3 hybridization which possesses excellent electrical properties, high surface areas, and good mechanical properties.\nIn addition, polyoxometalates (POMs) are among the promising species that can be immobilized on a carbon matrix. They include a large class of inorganic oxides containing oxygen and transition metals with excellent activity in many applications.3,17,18 The advantages of using POMs as an electro-catalyst in ORR are their rich redox chemistry which gives rise to mixedvalence species, structural exibility, high thermodynamic oxidation stability, and fast and reversible multiple electron redox properties.19 Different carbon materials were used as the ideal support for the dispersion of POMs such as graphene,17 graphitic carbon nitride,18 and carbon black.20 But the use of POMs in ORR is still limited because of their low surface area, lower stability, and degradation in the aqueous media.19,21 Diana M. Fernandes et al. reported the preparation of polyoxotungstate immobilized on different carbon support nanomaterials in an alkaline medium.1 A diffusion-limiting current density of \u2212168.3 mA cm\u22122 mg\u22121 was obtained for Co4(PW9)2@N-CNT. Marta Nunes et al. prepared several nanocomposites by the incorporation of vanadium-substituted phosphomolybdate into different carbon supports. They found that the nanocomposite supported on graphene as PMo11V@graphene exhibited the best ORR performance.22\nTaking into account that POMs-based nanocomposites have shown high efficiency towards ORR and the nanocomposite containing POMs supported on nitrogen-doped carbon diamond hasn't been used before as an electrocatalyst for ORR. Thus, this work reports the successful preparation and application of polyoxomolybdate supported on nitrogen-doped carbon xerogel/diamond matrix for ORR in an alkaline medium. The porous carbon xerogels were prepared from the resorcinol\u2013formaldehyde monomers through the sol\u2013gel method. Then, the nitrogen-doped carbon xerogel diamond matrix was prepared by simply mixing and annealing the precursors in a tube furnace at 600 \u00b0C for 2 h under the N2 atmosphere. Finally, the nanocomposite of polyoxomolybdate supported on nitrogen-doped carbon xerogel/diamond\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The purpose of this work is to evaluate the importance of hybridizing the sp3 of nanodiamond with sp2 of carbon xerogels to increase the conductivity of the support material. Moreover, the effect of the morphology of the polyoxomolybdate on the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite to the ORR is evaluated."

The existence of several diffraction peaks was attributed to the incorporation of POM polyanion inside the CDNPs matrix. Higher peak intensities are noticed in the case of POM@CDNPs, indicating the increase in the degree of crystallinity and crystallite size. It is noted that the diffraction peaks assigned to POM between 8.95\u00b0\u201326.43\u00b0 are hardly observed in the POM@CDNPs nanocomposite, possibly due to the excellent dispersion, structure change, and low content of POM molecules in the nanocomposite.27\nThe investigation of the materials' porous structure was carried out using nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77 K, while the pore size distributions were calculated using the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT), Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm for C is typical of type I isotherm with little contribution from the type II isotherm. The C isotherm suggests that the majority of the pores are in the micropore range with few mesopores. In addition, there is\nFig. 4 FESEM images for (a) C, (b) CDNPs, (c) POM, (d) and (e) POM@CDN\n8094 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 8090\u20138100\na sharp increase in the N2 adsorption at low relative pressure P/P \u00b0 < 0.1, indicating the micropores lling and the formation of the monolayer. On the other hand, the N2 adsorption isotherms for CDNPs and POM@CDNPs, Fig. 3a, are combinations between type I and type IV isotherms with micro/meso pores contribution. This development in the mesopore character is very important in the catalysis application as it enhances the ionic diffusion inside the materials which in turn promotes the ORR activity. In Fig. 3b, a very low quantity of N2 gas is adsorbed, suggesting a very low surface area and large particle sizes for POM. These ndings are also conrmed by the calculations of the pore size distributions using NLDFT calculations, Fig. 3c and d. The development of the mesopore diameter is observed for POM@CDNPs with an average pore size of 3.29 nm. While for C and CDNPs most of the pores are in the micropore range. The data of specic surface area (SBET), micropore volume (V0) and pore diameter (L0) for the prepared materials are compiled in Table 1. Although the C has the highest specic surface area and micropore volume, its pore diameter is not as high as that of POM@CDNPs. The increase in pore diameter means higher adsorption of oxygen molecules.\nThe materials' surface morphologies were investigated using FESEM, Fig. 4. The morphology of three-dimensional (3D) interconnected particles was observed for both C and CDNPs materials, Fig. 4a and b.

For POM the N 1s spectrum shows peaks at binding energies of 398.6, and 401.7 eV, which are attributed to the imine bond (sp2 hybridized nitrogen C]N\u2013C) involved in triazine rings, and positively charged nitrogen as a quaternary amino group (\u2013NR3)\n+ in ammonium group, Fig. S6c.\u2020 For the comparison of POM@CDNPs with CDNPs in Fig. 6c, pyridinic-N (29.96 at%), pyrrolic-N (16.85 at%), graphitic-N (13.48%), and oxidized N (8.98%) still exist, with the shi to high binding energy as the corresponding peaks appears at 398.9, 399.9, 401and 403.3 eV, respectively. Additionally, an obvious peak of Mo\u2013N (33.70%) at a binding energy of 394.8 eV can be detected due to the strong binding of Mo with N.3 In general, Mo\u2013N and pyridinic N are regarded as electroactive sites, which would elevate the current density and enhance the electrocatalytic activity.31\u201333 Fig. S6d,\u2020 manifest the deconvoluted Mo 3d spectrum into two spin\u2013orbit doublets in POM.

These results are higher than that reported before for other similar reported electrodes, Table 2.\nDistinctly, these outcomes unveil the fostered inuence on oxygen reduction efficiency using POM decorated on CDNPs as an electro-catalyst. The observed difference in electro-catalytic activity may be due to the characteristic morphology and chemical structure of POM@NCD. As remarked by the SEM images, the nanocomposites of the prepared POM@CDNPs with POM immobilized at the surface of CDNPs and in between its matrix displayed high dispersion of POM clusters which is\npotentially responsible for its improved performances. Several reports have proved that N-doped carbonmaterials confer active sites for the immobilization of different species as well as improve the electro-catalytic behaviour towards ORR due to the generation of a new active site.1,24,36 So, the high electro-catalytic activity of POM@CDNPs can be assumed to synergy nitrogen doping of carbon materials and the dispersion of polyoxometalates.\nThe Koutecky\u2013Levich, (K\u2013L) plots were used to evaluate the ORR kinetics at several potentials and estimate the electron transfer capacity of the POM@CDNPs.
