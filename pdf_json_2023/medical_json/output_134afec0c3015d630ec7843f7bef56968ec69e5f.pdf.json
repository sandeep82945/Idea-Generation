            "text": "Pandemics are part of the group of natural disaster events triggered by socio-environmental phenomena and imbalances that affect populations. In this context, on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Having started in Wuhan, China, as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,1 the disease quickly turned into a major global challenge and in March 2020, it was declared as a pandemic, requiring a rapid health response.2\nUnderstanding the spread of potentially pandemic viral infect ious diseases is fundamental in order to support public health decisions. An important method of monitoring these diseases is genomic and epidemiological surveillance, which enables the rapid identif ication of these infectious agents. Since the beginning of the3 pandemic, the spread of the causative agent \u2013 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) \u2013 of COVID-19 has been monitored worldwide, with different surveillance strategies, by which the virus evolution can be observed and shared in real time.4\nIn Brazil, each Federative Unit (UF), including the Federal District, has a Central Public Health Laboratory (Laborat\u00f3rio Central de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica - LACEN), under the General Coordination of Public Health Laboratories (Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral de Laborat\u00f3rios de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica - CGLAB), within Health and Environment Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health. The LACENs have, as their main function, to assist the states in the areas of epidemiological, sanitary and environmental surveillance (Organic Law No. 8080).5 Consequently, these laboratories are involved in the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases of public health concern and are responsible for a significant portion of the diagnosis of emerging and re-emerging diseases, such as arboviruses and COVID-19.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, LACENs played a key role in identifying variants of concern, given that they receive samples from all regions of the country. However, in addition to the basic infrastructure, updating the bioinformatics tools necessary for data analysis is extremely important. This analysis still represents a major challenge for public health professionals, since it involves specific techniques from the area of scientific research and that are not widely used in practical experience at LACENs.\nIn an attempt to strengthen the action of national epidemiological surveillance through technology transfer, in September 2021, the first face-to-face training was held in Brazil, where the epidemiological and genomic data generated were analyzed by health professionals from LACENs, during the event entitled Bioinformatics Workshop on Virus Evolution and Molecular Epidemiology (VEME).\nVEME is a traditional course aimed at training participants in the use of bioinformatics tools"

Technology transfer between research institutions and health services results in updating and improving health system performance.\nPerspectives\nBased on the success of the reported technology transfer, a new module will be incorporated into the next edition of VEME (Panama 2022), entitled Virus Evolution to Public Health Policy Makers\nEpidemiologia e Servi\u00e7os de Sa\u00fade, Bras\u00edlia, 32(2):e2022614, 2023 3\napplied to epidemiology and virus evolution.

The event was conducted in both formats based on the concept of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), which aims to strengthen the interactions between science and society.7,8\nAs a didactic strategy for training and updating health professionals enrolled in the course, the most commonly used bioinformatics tools in high-impact research were selected: Genome Detective for genome assembly; MAFFT for sequence alignment; AliView for editing sequences manually; IQTREE, for estimating phylogenetic signal and constructing maximum likelihood trees; TempEst for estimating the temporal signal; BEAST for constructing dated trees; FigTree for visualizing generated phylogenetic trees; and R Studio for epidemiological analyses and data visualization.9-16\nVEME light took place between September 5 and 10, 2021, at Ouro Minas Palace Hotel, Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, according to the activity program described in Box 1.

The hotel offered a buffet service, with alcohol-based hand sanitizer available in order for all of them to use before putting on gloves (to serve themselves) and settling down in a room specially organized for the participants.\nThe course activities were carried out in a room named Sal\u00e3o Centen\u00e1rio, which was capable of accommodating 900 people, with tables arranged to maintain the necessary social distancing. Each student received a seat and a specific computer, for in silico practices. It was not allowed to change the equipment\nduring the event. The seats and computers were arranged to ensure a minimum distance of 2 meters between them. The hotel cleaning staff performed daily disinfection of the computers and tables using 70% isopropyl alcohol.

The remaining 15 students were\nf rom other countries: Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Senegal.\nFor the selection of students, gender equity was taken into account, in addition to the participation of two to three representatives of each of the 27 LACENs in the country. These professionals work directly with the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and data analysis. The training course enabled them to perform the necessary analyses for genomic surveillance (genome assembly, phylogenetic analyses, identification of viral variants) and as a result, several scientific publications authored by these professionals are currently underway.17-20\nAll 162 participants, as well as Ouro Minas Palace Hotel staff, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 before the start of the event. Only one hotel employee tested positive and was removed from his activities; among the other participants and hotel staff, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected, neither before nor at the end of the event, indicating the safety and effectiveness of all the measures adopted (Figure 1).\nEpidemiologia e Servi\u00e7os de Sa\u00fade, Bras\u00edlia, 32(2):e2022614, 2023 6"

            "text": "In recent years, at the initiative of the Ministry of Health, the LACENs have been implementing different Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) strategies to perform genomic surveillance. This process has enabled each LACEN to generate complete genomes of emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens, circulating and co-circulating in each state. In this scenario, the need arose to train healthcare workers in the use of bioinformatics tools, enabling them to analyze genomic data generated in their laboratories in real time. This would have facilitated the rapid dissemination \u2013 among public health authorities \u2013 of the number of genotypes and subtypes of the circulating viral strains detected by each of the 27 LACENs, so that control measures could be promptly implemented. Given the demand, this training course has initiated the technology transfer process and capacity building of public health professionals in Brazil for the real-time monitoring and analysis of genomic data.\nIt is worth highlighting that during VEME light, concepts of Responsible Research and Innovation RRI were addressed. It is a movement that aims to restructure the way science is integrated into society.7,8 In Brazil, the RRI acronym is not widely adopted and promoted; however, many everyday practices are in line with the spirit of RRI, which seeks a more responsive, reflective, inclusive, and socially responsible science and technology.\nThe concept of RRI involves f ive key principles: Education; Open Access; Ethics; Social Engagement; Gender Equality.7,8 These principles were put into practice during the training course, with education remaining the core of VEME.\nEducation is the basis for technology transfer and capacity building, enabling the dissemination and application of knowledge.21 During VEME, in addition to the participation of professors who are experts on that field and internationally recognized for their work, the classes were based on a practical learning approach.\nThe didactic strategy used ensured that the students could apply the tools in real time and that the content covered was more suitable for the practice of each LACEN. Furthermore, in order for each student and public health professional to master the tools presented, they were granted autonomy to apply and disseminate the knowledge acquired at the face-to-face VEME, in their state.\nVEME provided public health professionals f rom all Brazilian states with access to knowledge and tools used by leading research centers in the world. This training course has enabled faster detection and monitoring of circulating viral variants in the states, given that trained health professionals began performing real-time genomic surveillance and publishing their results in high-impact journals.17-20\nThe fact that the event organizers only advised the participants to stay at the hotel during the days of the event, without obligating them, and that there was no control over their entry and exit, is a limitation of this study. However, the spirit of collaboration of the professors and enrolled students was reflected in everyone staying at the training location, respecting the proposed safety protocols.\nThe implementation of technology transfer in a face-to-face course, during the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, was of great relevance for the training of public health professionals involved. The topics covered during the event enabled not only genomic data generation, but also their rapid analysis. This training process was fundamental for monitoring the evolution of the epidemic at the local level. Motivated by the success of this experience, a new module entitled Virus Evolution to Public Health Policy Makers will be incorporated into the next edition of VEME in Panama in 2022. This training course for health professionals in genomic data analysis represents a milestone in epidemiological surveillance, allowing Brazil not only to efficiently monitor endemic strains, but also to predict new outbreaks through active monitoring and real-time data analysis.\nEpidemiologia e Servi\u00e7os de Sa\u00fade, Bras\u00edlia, 32(2):e2022614, 2023 7\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nBarreto FK, Santos LA, Giovanetti M and Alc\u00e2ntara LCJ collaborated with the study conception and design, analysis and interpretation of the results, drafting and critical reviewing of the manuscript content.
