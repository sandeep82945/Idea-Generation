    "abstractText": "Procainamide (PA) and its in vivo metabolite, N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), display some pharmacological differences. Although it is agreed that PA is a class IA antiarrhythmic, it has been reported that NAPA is a pure class III antiarrhythmic that affects only the repolarizing phase of the cardiac action potential. This last concept, observed exclusively in dogs, gained wide acceptance, appearing in classic pharmacology textbooks. However, evidence in species such as mice and rats indicates that NAPA can affect cardiac Na channels, which is unexpected for a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug. To further clarify this issue, the effects of PA (used as a reference drug) and NAPA on the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) and half-decay time (HDT) of the cardiac action potential were examined in the isolated right papillaris magnus of the guinea pig heart. Both PA and NAPA affected Vmax at lower concentrations than required to affect HDT, and NAPA had weaker effects on both variables. Thus, NAPA displayed typical class IA antiarrhythmic behavior. Therefore, the concept that NAPA is a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug is more species-dependent than previously envisioned. In addition, we demonstrated that the differential pharmacology of PA and NAPA is explainable, in molecular terms, by steric hindrance of the effects of NAPA and the greater number of potent aromatic-aromatic and cation p interactions with Na or K cardiac channels for PA.",

Although it is agreed that PA is a class IA antiarrhythmic, it has been reported that NAPA is a pure class III antiarrhythmic that affects only the repolarizing phase of the cardiac action potential. This last concept, observed exclusively in dogs, gained wide acceptance, appearing in classic pharmacology textbooks. However, evidence in species such as mice and rats indicates that NAPA can affect cardiac Na+ channels, which is unexpected for a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug. To further clarify this issue, the effects of PA (used as a reference drug) and NAPA on the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) and half-decay time (HDT) of the cardiac action potential were examined in the isolated right papillaris magnus of the guinea pig heart. Both PA and NAPA affected Vmax at lower concentrations than required to affect HDT, and NAPA had weaker effects on both variables. Thus, NAPA displayed typical class IA antiarrhythmic behavior. Therefore, the concept that NAPA is a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug is more species-dependent than previously envisioned. In addition, we demonstrated that the differential pharmacology of PA and NAPA is explainable, in molecular terms, by steric hindrance of the effects of NAPA and the greater number of potent aromatic-aromatic and cation p interactions with Na+ or K+ cardiac channels for PA.\nKey words: Procainamide; N-acetylprocainamide; Cardiac action potential; Maximum upstroke velocity; Half-decay time"

            "text": "Procainamide (PA) is classified as a class IA antiarrhythmic drug because it decreases the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) of the cardiac action potential at lower concentrations, and increases the half-decay time (HDT) of the cardiac action potential at higher concentrations (1,2).\nIn vivo, PA is metabolized to the active metabolite N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) (3), which is generally considered a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug in pharmacology textbooks (1,2). This concept has arisen because previous electrophysiological studies demonstrated that NAPA increases the HDTof the cardiac action potential without affecting Vmax (4\u20137). However, only a single animal species, namely dogs, was used in all of these studies (4\u20137), and it is well known that the pharmacology of cardiac antiarrhythmic drugs is highly species-dependent (8). Indeed, some data regarding NAPA generated in other species do not agree with the\nconcept that NAPA is a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug. Accordingly, we obtained direct evidence that NAPA blocks Na+ channels in isolated mouse cardiac myocytes (9). It should be noted that Na+ channel blockade is not expected for a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug which, by definition, should only block cardiac potassium channels and consequently should only affect HDT (1,2).\nFurthermore, in our previous study (9) we compared NAPA with PA (used as a reference drug) and proved that the former was less potent. This observation was unusual because NAPA is more lipophilic than PA (4), and it is thus expected to be more potent than PA. This is because both PA and NAPA have the chemical structure of local anesthetics, namely an aromatic moiety at one end of the molecule connected by an alkyl chain to an ionizable amino group at the opposite end of the molecule (Figure 1A and B). Generally, the potency of local anesthetics varies positively with lipophilicity (10\u201312).\nCorrespondence: A.C. Oliveira: <acolivei@icb.usp.br>"

Thus, there is clearly a need to comprehensively reevaluate the cardiac pharmacology of NAPA by encompassing two successive and complementary steps.\nFirst, an electrophysiological/pharmacological study of the recorded intracellular action potential should be performed using a larger spectrum of NAPA concentrations than previously reported in the literature (4\u20137), and NAPA should be compared with a reference drug (PA in our case). The use of a reference drug proved to be an important item in the design of comparative studies involving antiarrhythmic drugs (13). The cardiac action potential should be scrutinized with respect to Vmax and HDT, because Vmax reflects the status of cardiac Na+ channels and HDT reflects the status of cardiac K+ channels. This strategy should permit the comprehensive evaluation of the effects of either PA or NAPA on cardiac Na+ and K+ channels.\nThe second step is collating the obtained comparative electrophysiological/pharmacological effects of PA and NAPA on the action potential to the known molecular mechanisms of Na+ or K+ channel blockade described in the literature. These mechanisms involve different types of interaction, i.e., hydrophobic, aromatic-aromatic, and cation-p interactions, for both Na+ (14\u201319) and K+ (20\u2013 24) channel blockers. Because these interactions are modulated by diverse physicochemical parameters that encode lipophilicity and electronic and steric properties of molecules, such parameters should therefore be comparatively studied for PA and NAPA. Because no study has examined these variables, we have done so in the present work."

Briefly, action potentials were evoked by stimulating the preparation using a small bipolar platinum electrode connected to an electronic stimulator via a stimulus isolation unit. Membrane resting and action potentials were recorded using conventional intracellular microelectrode techniques. Resting membrane potentials were recorded in the DC mode and action potentials were recorded in the AC mode. The recorded AC data were amplified 20 times, low pass filtered (10 kHz) and stored in digital form (50 kHz sampling rate) using an analog-to-digital converter (Lynx, Brazil) coupled to a microcomputer. The analog-to-digital converter was commanded by a software (AqDados 7.5, Lynx, Brazil) that propitiated the sampling and filing of the action potentials, on line, and retrieved the stored waveforms, off line. The software also permitted the manipulation, using cursors, of the retrieved digitized action potentials to measure electrophysiological variables of interest, which were: Vmax, (maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential) and HDT (the time taken for the action potential to repolarize to 50% of its peak value).\nVmax was obtained as follows. The stored digitized action potential recording was retrieved, and its rising phase was scrutinized, using cursors, to determine the steepest slope within any two vicinal points. In this region, the change in voltage between these two points was maximal throughout the whole rising phase of the action potential. Vmax was calculated as the quotient between this maximal value and the corresponding time required by the waveform to travel between the two points.\nBraz J Med Biol Res | doi: 10.1590/1414-431X2023e12073\nHDTof the action potential was also obtained from the stored digitized recording using cursors. It was defined as the time for the waveform to fall to 50% of the maximal amplitude value.\nTo perform the electrophysiological experiments, control recordings were initially obtained in cells bathed in a drug-free physiological solution. Next, the same muscle was bathed (at least for 30 min) with a physiological solution containing either PA or NAPA. Action potentials were generated following a resting time of 1\u20133 min, during which the muscle was permitted to rest, i.e., it was not stimulated.

First, the effects of PA and NAPA on Vmax and HDT of the cardiac action potential were systematically and comprehensively compared using electrophysiological techniques. Second,\nthese findings were comparatively scrutinized, in molecular terms, using lipophilicity and electronic and steric physicochemical parameters (28\u201333).\nEffects of PA and NAPA on Vmax and HDT of the cardiac action potential\nThe effects of PA and NAPA on Vmax and HDT of the cardiac action potential were interpreted assuming that modifications of Vmax reflect changes of cardiac Na+ channels whereas modifications of HDT reflect the drugs\u2019 blocking effects on cardiac K+ channels, especially cardiac hERG K+ channels, considering their physiological importance and that these channels are the most sensitive to blockade among the cardiac K+ channel subtypes (1,2).\nWhile PA decreased Vmax at all three concentrations tested (Figure 3), it only increased HDTat the intermediate and highest concentrations (Figure 4). Thus, under the aforementioned assumptions PA blocked cardiac Na+ channels at a lower concentration and it also blocked cardiac hERG K+ channels at higher concentrations, as expected of a class IA antiarrhythmic drug (1,2).\nIn addition, NAPA had weaker effects on Vmax and HDT than PA (Figures 3 and 4). It should be emphasized that NAPA decreased Vmax at a concentration that had no effects on HDT (Figures 3 and 4, comparing intermediate concentrations). In other words, Vmax was more sensitive to NAPA than HDT, under the experimental conditions used. Thus, based on the aforementioned assumptions NAPA was demonstrated to interact with Na+ channels and affect these channels more potently than it affected hERG K+ channels. Because NAPA affected both Vmax\nBraz J Med Biol Res | doi: 10.1590/1414-431X2023e12073\nand HDT, this compound cannot be considered a \u2018\u2018pure\u2019\u2019 class III antiarrhythmic drug under the experimental conditions used in this study, because this drug class is expected to affect exclusively HDT of the action potential (1,2).\nTherefore, it should be further stated that although we clearly detected the effects of NAPA on Vmax (Figure 3), this was not demonstrated in previous studies (4\u20137). The findings of these previous studies were, of course, absolutely correct. In our view, the discrepant results are attributable to species characteristics which can affect cardiac electrophysiology and, consequently, the cardiac pharmacology (8). Within this line of thought, the four previously mentioned studies (4\u20137) that found no effects of NAPA on Vmax were all performed in dogs. On the contrary, our study was performed in guinea pigs, supporting previous findings of different effects of NAPA on Vmax when species other than dogs and additional experimental approaches are considered.\nThus, we previously demonstrated that NAPA could block Na+ currents recorded by patch-clamp techniques in mouse cardiac myocytes (9). In addition, it has been reported that NAPA inhibits the binding of radioactive batrachotoxin to rat cardiac myocytes (35). The binding sites to batrachotoxin are believed to represent Na+ channels, considering that this toxin is a specific ligand for these channels (35). Further evidence of a possible action of NAPA on Na+ cardiac channels was provided by experiments using the electrically stimulated isolated atria to evaluate the refractory period of cardiac muscle. Thus, the available literature indicates that this refractory period, which is mainly modulated by the inactivation of cardiac Na+ channels, is increased by NAPA in the rat (36) and rabbit atria (37). The results of these studies are best understood by assuming that NAPA is active on cardiac Na+ channels.\nTaken together, the aforementioned findings indicate that the effect of NAPA on Vmax, observed in this work (Figure 3), which reflects its effects on Na+ channels, is a general trend that is exceptionally not observed in dogs, the species previously used in studies in which no effects of this compound on Vmax were observed (4\u20137).\nThus, the results of this electrophysiological study do not support the previously reported concept that NAPA is a paradigmatic pure class III antiarrhythmic drug (1,2). In fact, under the experimental conditions used in this study, NAPA\u2019s pharmacological profile more strongly resembled that of a class IA antiarrhythmic drug, because NAPA affected Vmax at a lower concentration than it affected HDT (Figures 3 and 4). To the best of our knowledge, this feature of the pharmacology of NAPA has not been described previously and it constitutes a pharmacological feature that is worth studying from a molecular viewpoint, as approached in the next section.\nMolecular basis underlying the differential potency of"

            "text": "In the previous section, an electrophysiological/pharmacological study suggested that NAPA was less potent than PA regarding their effects on cardiac Na+ and hERG K+ channels. Thus, the mechanism supporting these differential effects should be explored.\nIn pursuit of an answer, we considered the available data regarding the chemical structure of binding sites for blockers of either cardiac Na+ (14\u201319) or hERG K+ channels (20\u201324). Interestingly, both channels harbor binding sites featuring aromatic amino acids, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, which play key roles in the binding of blockers of those channels. The identity of these amino acids was determined by site-directed mutation studies. More specifically, in Na+ channels, the positions of the tyrosine and phenylalanine are, respectively, 1771 and 1764 (14\u201319), whereas in hERG K+ channels the amino acids are located at positions 652 and 656, respectively (20\u201324).\nConsidering the chemical structures of binding sites in cardiac Na+ and hERG K+ channels, as previously indicated, the possible mechanisms for the interaction of PA and NAPA with these binding sites were evaluated, comparatively, in light of the physicochemical parameters of these drugs. To ensure a comprehensive approach, the employed physicochemical parameters covered a large spectrum of properties, i.e., lipophilicity and electronic and steric parameters (28\u201333). Their numerical values are reported in Table 1, in the Material and Methods section. It is expected that this approach will reveal the molecular basis of the reason behind PA being more potent than NAPA.\nConsidering the lipophilicity parameters (log P, log D, and p), Table 1 shows that the values corresponding to NAPA were all greater than those corresponding to PA. This indicated that NAPA was more lipophilic than PA, as previously reported (4). Thus, the higher potency of PA over NAPA, found in this work, was theoretically unexpected, given the known positive correlation between potency and lipophilicity, regarding Na+ (14\u201319) and hERG K+ channel blockers (20\u201324). Therefore, the comparative pharmacology of PA and NAPA described in this work appears to violate this correlation. Clarification of this phenomenon, at the molecular level, is therefore required.\nIt should be noted that lipophilicity parameters modulate hydrophobic interactions that appear to explain the increase in potency with increasing lipophilicity in most circumstances, involving blockers of Na+ (10\u201312,14\u201319) and hERG K+ channels (20\u201324). However, hydrophobic interactions can be hindered by the size of the acting molecule, because the target sites for hydrophobic interactions are sometimes structured, for example, in the form of hydrophobic pockets, which set limits on the size of an interacting molecule. To delve deeper into this issue, the steric parameters of PA and NAPA were examined.\nBraz J Med Biol Res | doi: 10.1590/1414-431X2023e12073\nAs presented in Table 1 (right columns), four of the five STERIMOL steric parameters were larger for NAPA. The data indicated that the larger size of NAPA was concomitantly linked to increased lipophilicity (left columns). Therefore, it is fair to suppose that, in the case of NAPA, competition between the increase in size and the increase in lipophilicity existed, in which steric hindrance offset the increase in lipophilicity. This is one possible reason why NAPA was less potent than PA despite being more lipophilic.\nAfter examining lipophilicity and steric physicochemical parameters, electronic parameters were examined next to determine whether additional binding mechanisms of PA and NAPA to cardiac Na+ or hERG K+ channels contributed to the higher potency of PA over NAPA. Within mechanisms that are modulated by electronic parameters, the possible participation of aromaticaromatic interactions was examined because such interactions have already been considered to participate in the binding of other blockers to Na+ (14\u201319) and hERG K+ channels (20\u201324).\nAromatic-aromatic interactions (38) (also denoted p-p or p-stacking interactions) could indeed explain the present findings, in view of the possible interactions between the aromatic ring of either PA or NAPA (Figure 1A and B) and the aromatic ring of tyrosine or phenylalanine residues found in the binding sites of either Na+ (14\u201319) or hERG K+ channels (20\u201324). Within this context, it should be noted that aromatic-aromatic interactions are influenced by the reactivity of the involved aromatic rings (39). For PA and NAPA, this reactivity can be described by examining Hammett\u2019s sp. This value was negative for PA and null for NAPA (Table 1, middle columns). The negative value of Hammett\u2019s sp of the amino group in PA indicates that this is an electron-donating group (39), and it is therefore able to induce a redistribution of the charge in the substituted molecule, increasing its electron transferring capacity (39). This does not apply to NAPA, as Hammett\u2019s sp of its acetoamide group was null (Table 1, middle columns), which implies lower reactivity of the aromatic ring in NAPA, rendering the compound less capable than PA of undergoing aromatic-aromatic interactions with binding sites in cardiac Na+ and hERG K+ channels. Therefore, the weaker aromatic-aromatic interactions, in the case of NAPA, represent another possible explanation for its lower pharmacological potency than PA.\nAnother binding mechanism that must be considered in this work is the cation p-interaction, because this mechanism is apparently effective for a number of blockers of Na+ (14\u201319) and hERG K+ (20\u201324) channels. The mechanism should be considered in this work because of the amino-termini of PA and NAPA (Figure 1A and B). More specifically, because the amino-terminus is ionizable, the cationic species of PA and NAPA can\nundergo cation-p interactions (40) with the previously mentioned aromatic amino acids present in the binding sites of both cardiac Na+ (14\u201319) and hERG K+ channels (20\u201324). Regarding cation-p interactions, a physicochemical parameter, one molecular electronic property, that must be considered is pKa, as it can influence cation-p interactions. The pKa was larger for PA than for NAPA (Table 1, middle columns). Thus, under similar experimental conditions, a larger number of protonated species were present for PA than for NAPA, allowing PA to have more cation-p interactions between the protonated tertiary amine (Figure 1A and B) and the aromatic tyrosine and phenylalanine residues residing in the binding sites of cardiac Na+ (14\u201319) and hERG K+ channels (20\u201324). In summary, the electrophysiological analysis revealed that NAPA behaved as a class IA antiarrhythmic drug, at a qualitative level, as opposed to a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug as shown in other studies, in dogs (4\u20137). This discrepancy is probably the result of speciesdependence, a feature known to markedly affect the physiology/pharmacology of cardiac muscle (8). At a quantitative level, NAPA was less potent than PA. The analysis employed to disclose the molecular features responsible for the lower potency of NAPA compared to PA, based on the physicochemical parameters of these drugs, indicated that steric hindrance of NAPA effects was a possible, but not the only explanation for the lower potency of NAPA. In fact, aromatic-aromatic and cation-p interactions, which were more common for PA than for NAPA, also contributed to this finding and, together with steric hindrance, counteracted the higher lipophilicity of NAPA, which was expected to make it more potent than PA."
