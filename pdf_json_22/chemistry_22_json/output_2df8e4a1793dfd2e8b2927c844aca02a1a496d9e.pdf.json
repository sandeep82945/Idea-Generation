    "abstractText": "Photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) from spiked aqueous solutions, via a UV/TiO2 system, was investigated, and the optimum photocatalyst type (P25 Degussa) and dose (500 mg/L), as well as irradiation time (45 min), were established. The degradation process kinetics was studied, and a degradation rate constant of 3.14 \u00d7 10\u22125 M min\u22121 was calculated for CBZ, using the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood equation. Experiments performed in the presence of scavengers showed that the main reactive species involved in the degradation process are holes and free hydroxyl radicals; superoxide radicals also play a role in CBZ degradation. Eight transformation products of CBZ were identified, and a possible degradation pathway, consisting of four routes, was proposed. Toxicity and genotoxicity tests were also performed for both untreated and treated CBZ solutions, proving that the use of a UV/TiO2 system represents a suitable treatment approach for aqueous systems with CBZ content.",

            "text": "Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) enter bodies of water in various ways. Although most of them are present in low concentrations, they have complex structures and difficult degradation paths [1\u20133]. Despite the low concentrations, in longterm pollution, PPCPs may be the cause of multiple endocrine diseases, inducing changes in the biochemical functions of aquatic habitats and affecting the biochemical functions of aquatic systems [4]. Carbamazepine CBZ (commercially known as Taver, Tegretol, or Finlepsin) is used in the treatment of cases of epileptic seizure, psychomotor epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, pituitary diabetes insipidus, and rebellious hiccups, and it is discharged into the environment in a variety of ways. CBZ absorption in the body is low; only 1 to 2% is excreted in the urine, and 22% reaches the environment through the feces. However, conventional wastewater treatment plants are not capable of efficiently removing PPCPs and their degradation by-products [5,6]. CBZ was found in concentrations of about 0.2 ng/L\u201311.6 \u00b5g/L in water, 0.14\u2013237.1 ng/g dry weight (d.w). in sediment, 1.6 ng/g in fish liver (wet weight\u2014w.w.), 0.88 ng/g in fish muscle (w.w.), and 0\u20131.9 ng/g in bivalve spp. (w.w.) [7]. According to the globally harmonized system (GSH), the hazard statements attributed to CBZ are H302: harmful if swallowed [warning acute toxicity, oral]; H317: may cause an allergic skin reaction [warning sensitization, skin]; H334: may cause allergy or asthma symptoms, or breathing difficulties, if inhaled [danger sensitization, respiratory] [8]. The CBZ oral LD50 for rats was estimated to be 1957 mg/kg. CBZ overdose may cause various cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and urinary symptoms, as well as laboratory abnormalities, including leukocytosis, reduced leucocytes, acetonuria, and glycosuria [9]. The ecotoxicity effects of\nToxics 2022, 10, 168. https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics10040168 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/toxics\nToxics 2022, 10, 168 2 of 13\nCBZ were studied in various taxonomic groups, such as Lumbriculus variegatus (0.625 and 10 mg/kg (d.w.) for 28 days); Chironomus riparius (0.16 to 100 mg/kg d.w.); Potamopyrgus antipodarum (28 days, 0.4 to 250 mg/L). In the oligochaete and the snail, no effects were observed. For C. riparius, no observed effects were reported at concentrations ranging from 33 to 140 \u00b5/kg d.w., while a 10% effect was reported at concentrations between 70 and 210 \u00b5/kg d.w., based on the carbamazepine concentrations measured in sediments. These results suggest that CBZ may pose a potential threat for the survival of C. riparius, and possibly also for other aquatic insect populations in the field [10]. The most sensitive biological system to CBZ was the Vero cell line (monkey kidney cells), followed by Chlorella vulgaris, Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna, Allium cepa, and RTG-2 cells (salmonid fish cells). EC50 values ranging from 19 \u00b5M in Vero cells at 72 h to more than 1200 \u00b5M in other systems were obtained. Comparing the concentrations from natural systems and the toxicity quantified in laboratory experiments, CBZ is not expected to produce acute toxic effects in the aquatic biota [11]. A recent study reported the following acute toxic concentrations for CBZ: LC50 (96 h) Cyprinus carpio 42.60 mg/L, EC50 (48 h) Daphnia magna 21.87 mg/L, and IC50 bacteria 54.21 mg/L. The aquatic risk of CBZ was estimated to be insignificant or low [12]. Based on the CBZ log Kow 2.3\u20132.77, this compound has low potential for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. Significant concentrations of CBZ and its metabolites were recorded in urban groundwater and Spanish rivers. Moreover, the treatment of CBZ using wastewater treatment plants proved to be inefficient [13]. In Germany, CBZ was detected as human metabolites and transformation products in groundwater, surface waters, and wastewater. Research results proved that these contaminants presented a potential danger to mammals, including humans. A recent research study on CBZ levels, related to the demographic indicators in the groundwater of densely populated areas, showed some worrying statistical results. It appears that correlations exist between the CBZ residuals detected in the groundwater and the aging or social characteristics of a population. The demographic characteristics and drug use in an urban area could influence the quality of potable water sources [14]. Relatively recent studies showed that CBZ is one of the most detected pharmaceutical compounds in Romanian waters, appearing in concentrations varying from 5.4 to 15.1 ng/L [12,15]. This indicates that CBZ is not being efficiently removed by traditional wastewater treatment methods. Various methods for CBZ removal from wastewater were proposed, including biodegradation, chemical oxidation (presented within Table 1), adsorption, activated sludge processes, and gamma radiation coupled with microbiological treatment, each of them presenting some drawbacks. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were also investigated for CBZ degradation [16], and the preliminary results showed that they can be considered as promising methods for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants, such as CBZ.\nTherefore, in order to surpass the limitations of conventional wastewater treatment processes, the photocatalytic degradation of CBZ, using a UV/TiO2 system, was investigated.\nToxics 2022, 10, 168 3 of 13"

The temperature of the chromatographic column was maintained at 25 \u25e6C, and the injection volume was 10 \u00b5L. To identify degradation products, full-scan chromatograms were recorded, using both electrospray ionization sources in positive mode. The scan range was between 80 and 300 Da. The values of the ionization source parameters were capillary voltage of 4000 V, drying gas temperature of 300 \u25e6C, drying gas flow of 8 L/min, and nebulizer pressure of 40 psi.

The endpoints of tests were mortality percentages at 24\u2018h and 48 h in the case of Daphnia, and growth rate inhibition at 72 h in the case of algae.

The increase in photocatalyst dose led to an increase in CBZ degradation efficiency for [TiO2] doses, by up to 500 mg/L (due to the increase in active sites), followed by a decrease in CBZ degradation efficiency for [TiO2] doses higher than 500 mg/L. This can be explained by the negative influences of light scattering processes and the photocatalyst agglomeration tendency. On the other hand, as expected, the increase in irradiation time proved to have a positive impact upon CBZ degradation efficiency. In respect to the obtained experimental results, the optimum CBZ degradation parameters were set up as a photocatalyst dose of 500 mg/L and an irradiation time of 45 min."

The Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood equation is widely used to describe the kinetics of UV/TiO2 processes. The model was also applied for organic compound degradation in aqueous suspensions [26]. The target pollutant\u2019s degradation rate is described by the following equation:\nr0 = \u2212 d[CBZ]\ndt = krKads[CBZ]0 1 + Kads[CBZ]0\n(1)\nwhere: ro\u2014initial degradation rate of CBZ; [CBZ]0\u2014initial CBZ concentration; [CBZ]\u2014CBZ concentration at a given t time; Kads\u2014equilibrium constant of CBZ adsorption/desorption on TiO2 particles; kr\u2014CBZ degradation rate constant; t\u2014irradiation time. Equation (1) can be rearranged as a linear equation, as follows:\n1 r0 = 1 kr + 1 krKads[CBZ]0 (2)\nThe degradation rate constant kr and equilibrium constant of CBZ adsorption/desorption of photocatalyst particles Kads can be calculated from the Equation (2) graphic plot (Figure S2), where 1/kr represents the intercept and 1/krKads represents the slope of the graphical plot. The initial pollutant degradation rate r0 (M min\u22121) was calculated from the experimental data after 30 min of irradiation.\nToxics 2022, 10, 168 9 of 13\nIn order to plot Equation (2), the initial concentration of CBZ was varied between 1.54 and 8.75 mg/L. From the graph\u2019s slope and intercept, the following values were calculated: kr = 3.14 \u00d7 10\u22125 M min\u22121 and Kads = 1062 M\u22121. As the initial CBZ concentration increased (from 1.54 mg/L to 8.75 mg/L), the apparent reaction rate constant decreased (from 0.167 min\u22121 to 0.152 min\u22121). It should be noted that the results follow the same trend recorded by another study [24] that used a P90 photocatalyst and a CBZ concentration range of 5\u201320 mg/L. The degradation of CBZ obeys the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model, and the obtained kinetic data suggest that the hydroxyl radicals absorbed on the catalyst surface play a minor role in CBZ degradation."

This behavior suggests minimal involvement of hydroxyl radicals from the photocatalyst surface within CBZ photocatalytic degradation. This is also sustained by the low value of the adsorption/desorption equilibrium constant obtained using the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood equation. Holes and free hydroxyl radicals represent the main active species within CBZ photocatalytic degradation; the presence of EDTA and i-PrOH led to the highest decreases in CBZ degradation efficiency, of 44.69% and 47.66%, respectively. Superoxide radicals can play a role within CBZ photocatalytic degradation, and the presence of BQ led to a decrease in the CBZ degradation efficiency, to 68.34%."

The first possible degradation route consists of successive CBZ oxidations, with the formation of TP252-A, followed by ring contraction (from seven to six), with TP195 formation. The second possible degradation route consists of successive CBZ oxidations, with the formation of TP252-A, which is further transformed into TP250, through scindation of the initial hepta-heterocycle, followed by intramolecular cyclization of a new six-atom heterocycle.

            "text": "In the case of Daphnia, an acute toxic effect of 95\u2013100% for the initial CBZ solution was recorded after 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Toxic effects were also registered for irradiated samples after both 24 h and 48 h of exposure. However, the toxic effect decreased in comparison with the initial CBZ solution, from 95% to 10%, after 24 h, and from 100% to 70% after 48 h of exposure. This finding can be explained by the fact that the tested solutions did not have an immediate toxic effect, but, rather, a chronic effect. Another possible explanation could be the formation of toxic compounds during CBZ photocatalytic degradation. However, the acute toxicity of the irradiated samples was lower compared with that of the initial CBZ solution. The test showed that the toxicity effects decrease with the decrease in CBZ concentration in the tested solutions, and with the increase in UV irradiation time. Neither the initial CBZ solution nor the irradiated samples determined toxic effects upon algae (they did not affect algal growth). On the contrary, growth stimulation was observed, especially for samples treated for a longer irradiation time. The effects registered after 48 h and 72 h for the tested samples indicate adaptation/tolerance to the toxic compound, more accentuated for those treated for a longer irradiation time (with a lower CBZ concentration). The level of genotoxicity was measured by calculating the induction factor (IF). The analyzed samples presented an IF < 1.5 (1.20\u20131.28, respectively), indicating non-genotoxicity effects upon Escherichia coli bacteria.

Five types of commercial titanium dioxide catalysts were tested, and Degussa P25 was selected as the optimum. The influence of photocatalyst dose and irradiation time was investigated, and an optimum titanium dioxide dose of 500 mg/L and an irradiation time of 45 min were found to allow a CBZ degradation efficiency of 99.77%, with an apparent CBZ degradation rate constant of 0.1411 min\u22121. Appliance of the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model allows for the calculation of the CBZ degradation rate constant as kr = 3,14 \u00d7 10\u22125 M min\u22121, and the equilibrium constant of CBZ adsorption/desorption of the photocatalyst surface as Kads = 1062 M\u22121. The tests performed in the presence of various scavengers showed that the main CBZ degradation routes are those through holes and free hydroxyl radicals; superoxide radicals also play a role in CBZ degradation. Hydroxyl radicals from the catalyst surface play a minor role in CBZ degradation in the above-mentioned experimental conditions. Eight CBZ transformation products were identified and four possible routes for CBZ degradation were proposed, the majority of which consist of successive oxidation reactions. From the four proposed degradation routes, two were not found to be reported within the literature for the photocatalytic degradation of CBZ, but only for photolysis and photo-electro-catalysis. Toxicity assays proved that both the CBZ initial solution and irradiated samples presented acute toxicity upon Daphnia magna planktonic crustaceans, with treated samples being less toxic compared with the initial untreated CBZ solution. Both the initial untreated CBZ solution and irradiation samples present no toxic effects upon Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata green algae and no genotoxic effects upon Escherichia coli.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/toxics10040168/s1: Figure S1: linearization of CBZ degradation in UV/TiO2 system by pseudo-first-order kinetics, [TiO2] = 500 mg/L, [CBZ]0 = 8.75 mg/L = 3.71 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, irradiation time = 45 min; Figure S2: linearization of Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood equation for CBZ degradation via UV/TiO2 system; Figure S3: profiles of TPs evolution during CBZ degradation process, A\u2014TP peak area, A0\u2014CBZ initial peak area; Table S1: CBZ degradation efficiencies vs. photocatalyst dose and irradiation time, [CBZ]0 = 8.75 mg/L = 3.71 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, photocatalyst dose = 100\u2013800 mg/L, irradiation time = 15\u201345 min; Method S1: CBZ determination method validation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.A.C. and L.A.C.; photocatalytic experiments, M.A.C. and L.A.C.; analytical determinations, F.L.C.; toxicity and genotoxicity tests, S.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.A.C.; writing\u2014review, M.A.C.
