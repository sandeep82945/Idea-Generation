    "abstractText": "Polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLHNs) have been widely used as a vehicle for carrying anticancer owing to its unique framework of polymer and lipid combining and giving the maximum advantages over the lipid and polymer nanoparticle drug delivery system. Surface modification of PLHNs aids in improved targeting and active delivery of the encapsulated drug. Therefore, surface modification of the PLHNs with the cell-penetrating peptide is explored by many researchers and is explained in this review. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are made up of few amino acid sequence and act by disrupting the cell membrane and transferring the cargos into the cell. Ideally, we can say that CPPs are peptide chains which are cell specific and are biocompatible, noninvasive type of delivery vehicle which can transport siRNA, protein, peptides, macromolecules, pDNA, etc. into the cell effectively. Therefore, this review focuses on the structure, type, and method of preparation of PLHNs also about the uptake mechanism of CPPs and concludes with the therapeutic application of PLHNs surface modified with the CPPs and their theranostics.",

Innovation in the design and framework of drug delivery to carry the chemical entities to the different sites in the body and their characterization to carry the drug allows for the treatment of a wide range of clinical problems. Genes (DNA/RNA), synthetic substances, recently discovered pharmaceuticals, or altered versions of drug molecules from the past are examples of such\nchemicals. Optimizing nanotechnology as a carrier for drug delivery to the human system is crucial for the therapeutics of many different diseases [1]. In this regard, a wide variety of submicron materials has been synthesized to act on cancer cells. Lipid-based and polymer-based nanoparticles have been largely used in the development of delivery vehicles for anticancer drugs, contrast agents, and therapeutics as well as in theranostics [2, 3].\nPolymer-based nanoparticles have been widely studied in the cancer field. Various natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic polymers have been used for designing polymerbased nanoparticles. Two of the most popular biodegradable and biocompatible polymers are poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and chitosan, both of which have received FDA approval for oral and parenteral administration [4]. Although polymer-based nanoparticles have several benefits, including sustained and controlled release, higher drug loading capacity, and stability, they also have some disadvantages, including a lack of polymer solubility, the use of organic reagents, and drug interactions with the polymer\u2019s monomer units [5, 6]. * Vamshi Krishna Tippavajhala vamshi.krishna@manipal.edu; krissrcm@gmail.com * Mahalaxmi Rathnanand mahalaxmi.r@manipal.edu 1 Department of\u00a0Pharmaceutics, Manipal College of\u00a0Pharmaceutical Sciences, Manipal Academy of\u00a0Higher Education, Manipal\u00a0576104, Karnataka, India 2 Manipal College of\u00a0Pharmaceutical Sciences, Manipal Academy of\u00a0Higher Education (MAHE), Manipal\u00a0576104, India\nAAPS PharmSciTech (2023) 24:124\n1 3\n124 Page 2 of 24\nDecades of research have been done on liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) as a part of lipid-based nanoparticles used as a drug delivery vehicle. Liposomes showed advantages like low toxicity, biocompatibility (as phosopholipid either from natural or synthetic source is used in the structure), controlled drug release, targeted drug delivery, and largescale manufacture. They can encapsulate and distribute both hydrophilic and lipophilic substances. However, the main drawbacks include drug leakage from the carrier as well as oxidation and hydrolysis of liposomal phospholipids, which results in structural deterioration and burst drug release [7]. Another disadvantage of liposomes is their quick clearance by reticuloendothelial system (RES), although this can be avoided by using lipid PEG (polyethylene glycol), which will cover the particles and lengthen the duration they are in circulation\u00a0[8, 9]. Consequently, the ability to enhance vesicle performance by using both natural and synthetic polymers was quickly tapped into by liposome preparation technology."

            "text": "The combination of liposomes with polymeric nanoparticles such as polymeric micelles, polymersomes, polyplexes, and polymer protein/drug conjugates is a contemporary trend in the pharmaceutical industry which are found to have wide applications in targeted delivery of anticancer drugs. All of these systems strive to deliver therapeutic agents with maximal effectiveness while causing the least amount of harm to the body\u2019s healthy cells. They make it possible for drug\nmolecules to effectively and safely enter the target region while preventing any possibility of systemic side effects. Moreover, these particles act as a barrier against the immune system and RES, extending the duration that anticancer medications are in circulation. These particles can be given the desired features, such as those needed for imaging, stimulitriggered release, and prolonged circulation time [10, 11].\nLiposome hybrid nanocarriers known as polymer-caged or polymer-incorporated liposomes or polymer-modified liposomes are made of polymers that have been grafted or attached to their surfaces (Fig.\u00a0 1a). The creation of liposomes with enhanced shape, particle size, zeta potential, surface characteristics, and membrane flexibility is another advantage of using polymers; these features are crucial to how they behave in vitro and in vivo\u00a0[12, 13]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was conjugated to the lipid anchor in the first novel modification of liposomes, which significantly lengthened circulation time, stabilized stress levels, and provided protection from opsonins. These extra characteristics caused hepatic RES to drain more slowly, considerably extending circulation duration [14]. Table\u00a0I shows different clinical trial data that suggest the importance of the PEG modification on to the liposomes.\nPolymer-modified liposomes (Fig.\u00a01b) and cell-based bio-mimetic (Fig.\u00a0 1c) offer potent carriers and permit considerably more effective drug administration, and their application has witnessed a tremendous development in recent years as the next generation of lipid-polymer hybrid nanocarriers.

Bio-mimetic\u00a0nanoparticles based on cell membranes have demonstrated greater potential in establishing lengthy blood circulation, precise recognition for targeting, and immune evasion because natural cell membranes feature particular antigen and structure essential for biological processes\u00a0[15].\nRecent years have seen the emergence of cell nanoparticle hybrid vectors as a means of addressing significant difficulties in nanocarriers linked to the incorporation of nanoparticles into living cells (Fig.\u00a01d). Hybrid cell nanoparticle vectors were predicted to control drug release, particularly for substances affected by efflux transporters and passive diffusion. They were also created to lessen the toxicity of the integrated medicine to the carrier cells, protecting the health and tumor-homing capacity of normal cells\u00a0[16].\nAlthough there are many reasons to use polymers in liposome preparations, they can all be categorized into\nthe group to overcome some drawbacks of first-generation liposomes.\n\u2022 Increasing the residence time, stealth abilities, and physicochemical stability in biological fluids. \u2022 Modifying the drug release profile, minimizing payload leakiness, and increasing encapsulation efficiency. \u2022 Possessing mucoadhesive and mucopenetrating characteristics. \u2022 Possessing qualities that respond to stimulus. \u2022 Offering a flexible targeting platform.\nTo address the drawbacks of the aforementioned two vehicles, a new generation of nano dimensional carrier systems called polymer-lipid-hybrid nanoparticles (PLHNs) has been developed. It is a hybrid made up of both lipids and polymers. In this manner, the inherent properties of polymers and lipids can be combined in a way that simultaneously avoids the disadvantages outlined above.\nTable I Clinical Trial Data of PEG Modified Liposomes\nSL.

One such strategy is using cell-penetrating peptides on the surface of PLHNs which helps in transport and targets certain receptors that are over expressed in respective cancer pathology. Cell-penetrating peptides are also termed or referred to as protein-transduction domains (PTDs). They contain less than 30 amino acid residues with a net positive charge. CPPs are peptides that can transport active molecules into the cell through biologically active conjugates and act as a promising strategy for cancer diagnosis and treatment\u00a0[17].\nPeptides present on the cell membrane act by disrupting it and then they pass through the membrane, or reside at the membrane interface and fuse with the cell membrane. These classes of peptides are known as membrane active peptides (MAPs)\u00a0[18]. MAPs particularly have greater advantages like higher specificity and increased affinity for therapeutic agents and biomolecules, ease in synthesis, flexibility for any modification or changes, compatibility with other therapeutic agents, low immunogenicity, and favorable physicochemical parameters which makes them compatible\u00a0[17]. When we talk about membrane active peptides, we can say that majorly they are divided into 2 classes: the first one is antimicrobial peptides which destroy the cells and the second class is cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) which transport cargo (ability to load the therapeutic agents) across lipid bilayers\u00a0[18].\nThirty years ago was the first time the term \u201ccell-penetrating peptide\u201d (CPP) was used and it originated when a small cationic sequence was identified in HIV-1 protein that is Tat protein, which was called as TAT peptide. CPPs were first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster (Antennapedia, Antp) which was an organism model and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV Tat) retrovirus\u00a0[19]. This TAT peptide had the ability to carry active molecules or the protein into the cell and nucleus\u00a0[18, 20]. The first discovered CPP was cationic TAT (YGRKKRPQRRR) [17]\u00a0and second was penetratin (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK). Penetratin has the ability to carry large cargoes, including oligonucleotides, proteins, or other peptides, through intracellular components of the cell\u00a0[21].\nTherefore, CPP contains broad range of peptides with various mechanisms, efficiency, specificity, and intracellular targets in trans-membrane transport\u00a0[22, 23]. This broad range of CPPs makes its application in drug delivery and its transport characteristics difficult. Surface-modifying PLHNs with the CPPs to enhance transport characteristics are very useful which can be developed by selecting\ncertain CPPs for transportation purpose in order to deliver PLNHs with drug inside the cell for intracellular target of action\u00a0[20].\nIn this review, we have focused on structure of PLHNs, classification of PLHNs and CPPs, method of preparation of PLHNs and CPPs, oral absorption of PLHNs, therapeutic application of PLHNs, intracellular delivery mechanism of CPPs and finally therapeutic applications of PLHNs surface modified with CPPs."

The most common types of polymer used in the synthesis of PLHNs are PCL, PLGA, PLA, PbAE, and chitosan [26, 27].\u00a0These materials are also highly biocompatible and biodegradable\u00a0[28]. The lipid and polymer can be bound by different interactions like hydrophobic, van der Waals force, electrostatic interactions, or other non-covalent connections where the core of PLHNs is made of polymer with lipid coated in the surface\u00a0[29]. Based on the individual medicinal drugs, the outer lipid layer can be modified to promote effective uptake. To create a tailored drug delivery system, the outer lipidic membrane can also be changed by affixing particular antibodies, ligands, aptamers, and bioactive materials like DNA, RNA, or proteins that can be bound covalently or non-covalently\u00a0[30].\nAAPS PharmSciTech (2023) 24:124\n1 3\nPage 5 of 24 124\nClassification of\u00a0PLHNs\nThe structural organization of the polymer and lipid in PLHNs determines how they are classified."

In contrast, the organic solvent dissolves the polymer and hydrophobic drug. The aqueous lipid phase was added to this organic solvent mixture. Water-insoluble lipids can also dissolve in organic solvents. Lipid molecules self-assemble onto the hydrophobic polymer core and encapsulate the drug.

Due to its finger-like projections called villi, the small intestine absorbs many substances because of its increased surface area. Consequently, cholesterol esters, phospholipids, triacylglycerols (TAGs), and other lipids are absorbed through the intestinal epithelium. A variety of cell types exist in the small intestine, including enterocytes that contain micro-villi, goblet cells that secrete mucus, paneth cells that secrete antimicrobial enzymes and lysozymes, and endocrine cells. The epithelial cells also have M cells associated with the payer\u2019s patch which are involved in GLAT-gut-associated lymphoid tissue components\u00a0[46].\nNanoparticles are generally transported through the intestinal epithelium by 4 major process known as paracellular (transport of molecules between the cells), transcellular (transport of molecules through the cells), and transcytosis (receptor specific active transport of the molecules) by which they enter the systemic circulation through blood or lymph\u00a0[47].\nThe enterocytes absorb lipids from the liver\u2019s bile. As lipids reach the stomach, gastric lipase (pH-4.0) fragments them into diacylglycerols (DAGs) and fatty acids. Upon reaching the intestine, these lipids are hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase to form monoacylglycerols (MAG) and fatty acids. Cholesterase breaks down cholesterol esters into free cholesterol and fatty acids, and pancreatic phospholipase breaks down phospholipids into lysophospholipids and fatty acids. The enterocyte cells of the small intestine absorb these byproducts of the corresponding lipids. They are re-esterified by proteins like monoacylglycerol acyltransferases (MGATs), diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs), and acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs) to TAGs, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids, which are then packed into pre-chylomicron with apolipoprotein B-48 (apoB-48) or stored as intracellular lipid droplets. Pre-chylomicron transport vesicles (PCTVs) transport pre-chylomicrons from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus for maturation via microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (Fig.\u00a06). In the MTP, lipidation of TAGs, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids along Apo-B48 occurs within the pre-chylomicron. By exocytosis, the mature chylomicrons are transported to the lamina propria, where they are absorbed into the circulation by the lymphatic system\u00a0[48\u201350].\n1 3"

Based on flow cytometry, AO/PI staining, and upregulation of P53 and caspase-9, Tmx-Cu-LPHNPs induce pro-apoptotic effects.

It is also very critical to address MDR in order to improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. PLHNs have several advantages, including increased mechanical stability and shape control. Huang et al. developed polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLN) for the delivery of psoralen (PSO) to treat breast cancer. PSO-PLN exhibited a strong reversal effect on MCF-7/ADR cells according to in vitro experiments and was modestly localized in liver. As a result, PSO-PLN improves PSO\u2019s ability to release into the body continuously, which not only helps to reverse MDR but also improves the efficacy of treatment [62]. Yuan et al. also developed polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (LPN) containing psoralen (P) to improve the efficacy of doxorubicin in multidrug-resistant HepG2 cells. In multidrugresistant HepG2/ADR cells, psoralen LPNs (P-LPNs) increased the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) 17 times more than free DOX. Additionally, pro-apoptotic activity, elevated ROS, and depolarization were all observed in P-LPNs. According to mechanistic investigations, P-LPNs boosted the cytotoxicity of DOX by enhancing caspase-3 cleavage and cytochrome C release, which led to apoptosis in HepG2/ADR cells\u00a0[63]. By encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX) in the PLGA core and a NO photodonor (NOPD) in the phospholipid shell, Fraix et al. reported the delivery of nitric oxide (NO) via customized lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) under the control of visible light as a method of overcoming DOX resistance in melanoma. The release of NO by multi-cargo NPs is sufficient to obstruct the efflux transporters principally responsible for DOX cellular extrusion, according to research on M14 DOXresistant melanoma cells. DOX\u2019s anticancer activity was subsequently boosted by increased cellular retention\u00a0[64]. To overcome paclitaxel (PTX) MDR in lung cancer, Pramual et al. used a nanoparticle-mediated photodynamic treatment (NPs/PDT) method. They combined PTX with a photosensitizer known as pTHPP in PLGA-lipid hybrid nanoparticles. Various MDR models were used to assess the photocytotoxic effects of the nanoparticles, and the results through flow cytometry showed that combination hybrid system killed the cancer cells through apoptosis. The PLGA-lipid hybrid nanoparticles\u2019 ability to carry photosensitizers or chemotherapeutic drugs suggests that they have the potential to treat both drug-selected and metastasis-associated MDR lung cancer cells\u00a0[65].Ta bl e II A pp lic at io n of P LH N s i n C an ce r T he ra py D ru g C an ce r Pr ep ar at io n m et ho d Po ly m er s a nd L ip id s Si ze , z et a, P D I, an\nd EE\nRe f\nEm od\nin (E\nM O\n) B\nre as\nt c an\nce r\nN an\nop re\nci pi\nta tio\nn m\net ho\nd Po\nly m\ner : P\nLG A\n.

Pore formation includes the following processes: Firstly, the peptide chain interacts with the phospholipid membrane and attaches to it. This results in an increased concentration of peptides on the surface of the cellular membrane. As the concentration of peptides increases, the resting lipid bilayer membrane gets distorted.

Different mechanisms (Fig.\u00a010)\u00a0of the pinocytosis pathway are (i) macropinocytosis; (ii) clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME); (iii) caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CvME); and (iv) clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis\u00a0[89].\nMacropinocytosis Macropinocytosis is a form of lipid raft-dependent endocytosis that occurs more rapidly and is receptor independent. A large amount of fluid content is taken up, and this type of uptake is termed fluid phase endocytosis (FPE). Due to the simulation of growth factors or other signals, membrane ruffling occurs. Similar to phagocytosis, there is a cascade of steps that include signals and regulators belonging to the kinase group (such as Src, PI3) and GTPases (Rho family, Ras family, Rab proteins), and\ninduce the macropinocytosis process. These regulators trigger actin-mediated membrane protrusions. The so-formed protrusions collapse and eventually fuse with the cellular membrane. This fusion produces large endocytotic vesicles called macropinosomes. These vesicles named macropinosomes mature\u00a0[89\u201393].\nClathrin\u2011Mediated Endosomal Uptake CME is a form of endocytosis that is typically engaged in the uptake of LDL (low-density lipoprotein). The transportation of the active component from outside to inside the cell is via the endocytic pathway. All the processes make use of clathrin and the GTPase dynamin, as this process is receptor-dependent\u00a0[94].\u00a0The initiation of the CME process starts with the gathering of major proteins required for coat formation, i.e., clathrin triskelia, which forms clathrin-coated pits. This clathrin triskelion was composed of three heavy chains of clathrin along with closely bound light chains that are made up of clathrin\nAAPS PharmSciTech (2023) 24:124\n1 3\n124 Page 14 of 24\nand also an adaptor protein-2 (AP2). This AP-2 is a heterotetramer, which consists of alpha, beta-2, gamma-2, and \u03bc2 subunits [95].\nAn endocytotic process begins when a ligand binds to a specific cell surface with a strong binding interaction. Because of this strong interaction, clathrin starts assembling on the cellular surface in a polyhedral lattice. As a result of the invagination of the clathrin-coated surface, they tend to move towards the cytoplasm by forming pits that acquire a spherical shape along the membrane\u00a0[96]. Therefore CME contains 5 stages (Fig.\u00a011): (1) initiation of CME events, (2) cargo loading, (3) membrane bending/folding, (4) vesicle disunion, (5) disassembly of the outer coat.\nInitiation of\u00a0CME Events Initiating endocytotic events is the first step in this pathway. It is very critical for regulating the series of biochemical events because it paves the way for the formation of the endocytic vesicle. This is because they determine where the vesicle will be formed on the cellular membrane. The endocytic proteins start clustering on the plasma membrane, and because of this clustering, they form a vesicle on the cellular membrane. That is the major components of the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and the adaptor proteins like AP-2 interact with each other and favor the formation of vesicles\u00a0[97].\nThe allosteric regulation of AP2 and the change in conformation play a very prominent role in controlling the initial steps of CME. When the cystolic AP2, which is a protein, comes into contact with the cellular membrane, it interacts with the plasma membrane, which is rich in PI4,5P2, and because of this interaction, nucleation of clathrin assembly occurs. The cargo, as well as the PI4,5P2, also bonds to the EAPs (endocytic accessory proteins), which triggers the stabilization of the open conformation and prevents the early apportion of the clathrin-coated pits. This sustained interaction of the cargo molecules, PI4,5P2, and the EAPs contr ibutes to the growing stages of the clathrin-coated vesicles, and once the growth is complete, maturation of the so-formed vesicle takes place\u00a0[95].\nCargo Loading Cargo loading is the second step, right after the initiation of endocytic events. The principle driving this step is the assembly of the clathrin coat on the specific site on the plasma membrane as well as the assembly of the cargo molecules. This type of arrangement triggers the clustering of the cargo molecules onto the specific site on the membrane and contributes to the formation of the curvature on the plasma membrane resulting in a clathrin-coated vesicle.\nAfter the vesicle forms, particular cargo is incorporated into the vesicle, and the concentration of cargo molecules is very critical because if that concentration is not reached, it can lead to abortion of the clathrin-coated vesicles or scission of the vesicles\u00a0[98].\nMembrane Bending The following step of CME is membrane bending. The endocytosis process requires the bending of the membrane, which is contributed by several modules like the coat, the actin filaments, and the scission proteins. Clathrin first interacts with an adapter protein residing on the plasma membrane. This interaction leads to the assembly of clathrin onto the coat in an icosahedral manner. This results in the polymerization of clathrin and causes membrane curvature, or bending. Actin also plays an important role in membrane bending as the membranes undergo polymerization and attach to the surface and base of the growing membrane vesicle. The association of clathrin and actin filaments gives a driving force for membrane bending, and actin filaments undergo depolymerization in seconds once the process is complete\u00a0[89, 96, 97].\nVesicle Disunion As the word implies, vesicle disunion is the dissociation of the formed vesicle from the parent cellular membrane. The GTPase dynamin is primarily responsible for catalyzing the above-mentioned process. A GTPase dynamin arranges them around the neck of the forming vesicle in a helical fashion and dissociates the vesicle from the membrane. Dynamin is generally involved in membrane vesicle scission based on the following process. The first dynamin assembles in a helical manner around the vesicle in the form of a tightly bound oligomer. This results in the constriction of the so-formed vesicle neck. GTP hydrolysis results in membrane fission. Upon the addition of GTP, the dynamin further constricts the formed vesicle, which then undergoes a spontaneous transition into the half-fission state, and finally, to the fission state, releasing the free clathrincoated vesicle\u00a0[97, 99].\nDisassembly of\u00a0the\u00a0Coat Once the vesicle is dissociated from the membrane, the next step is the shedding or disassembly of the coat. This will enable the newly formed vesicle to fuse with the early endosome. The initially attached endocytic proteins released in this process can also be used for future events or saved for the next event. The ATPase also influences the disassembling activity, which results in the depolymerization of clathrin and dynamin\u00a0[95, 98].\nCaveolae\u2011Mediated Endocytosis Pathway Palade was the first one to describe caveolae in 1953. He described it as a flask or an omega-shaped substance that appears as a small cave-like structure attached to the cellular membrane.\nAAPS PharmSciTech (2023) 24:124\nPage 15 of 24 124\nIt was found that it played a very crucial role in endocytosis, lipid digestion, and cell signaling\u00a0[100]. Caveolae consist of a structure called caveolin, which is a dimeric protein. This caveolin can bind to cholesterol and insert it into the inner part of the cellular membrane in a loop-like manner, which further self-associates and forms a striated coat on the membrane, which undergoes growth\u00a0[89]. There are three members of the Cav family, namely Cav-1, Cav-2, and Cav-3. Cav-1 and Cav-2 are mostly found in fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, and pneumocytes, whereas Cav-3 communicates with skeletal muscle fibers and cardiac myocytes independently of Cav-1 and Cav-2\u00a0[101, 102].\nCaveolae-dependent endocytosis is largely dependent on the GTPase dynamin. Cav-1 ligands on a cellular membrane interact with the dynamin domain and disrupt the cytoskeleton arrangement of actin filaments. Due to this process, dynamin-II replaces the plasma membrane where vesicle internalization occurs. When this happens, dynamin undergoes oligomerization as well as GTP-dependent conformational changes and results in inserting itself around the neck collar (Fig.\u00a0 12), leading to the formation of new vesicles called caveosomes, which help in the transportation of cargo molecules. Afterward, the vesicles undergo vesicle disunion from the originally attached plasma membrane[100, 103].\nClathrin\u2011 and\u00a0Caveolae\u2011Independent Endocytosis Basically, this pathway involves in the uptake of lipids and fluids\u00a0[104]. Caveolae, as previously stated, are dimeric proteins that have a proclivity to interact with the cholesterol-rich domain and are cave-like structures on the plasma membrane with a diameter of 40\u201350\u00a0nm. As a result of their highly lipidic nature, these cave-like structures are very effective in the endocytosis process in any vesicle, sorting the membrane proteins and favoring their internalization\u00a0[105, 106].\nThe molecular-level process underlying this type of endocytosis can be dynamin dependent or clathrin independent. They make use of the scission GTPase dynamin,\nor they may function independently of dynamin without clathrin. The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton determine the stability and scission processes\u00a0[107]. Another process is by clathrin- and dynamin-independent endocytosis pathway, which makes use of endophilin-A2 and endophilin-A1. These endophilin directly facilitates endocytosis process by binding to the selected G protein\u2013coupled receptors\u00a0[108].\nClathrin-dynamin independent is also an endocytic pathway that is involved in the internalization process of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored proteins (GPI-APs) and fluid phase in multiple cell lines and tissues\u00a0[109]. In the electron microscope picture, uncoated, tubular intermediates\u00a0[110]\u00a0described as clathrin-independent carriers (CLICs), were evident, subsequently fusing to form GPI-AP-enriched early endosomal compartments (GEECs)\u00a0[111]."

There are several mechanisms by which cargo molecules reach the cytosol, mainly membrane disruption and ionic pair formation.\nBy interacting with the negatively charged phospholipid content of the cellular membrane, the positively charged CPPs can induce membrane disruption\u00a0[112]. Because of this interaction, pores are formed or can cause leakage in the plasma membrane, through which the CPPs are released. TAT is the most prominent example of this, as it causes leakage when it interacts with the plasma membrane\u2019s phospholipids\u00a0[113]. Another mechanism was the formation of an ion pair when the CPPs interacted with the negatively charged, high-lipid plasma membrane, resulting in the partitioning of the CPPs across the membrane lining and the release of the CPPs; a clear example of this is how the oligo-arginines reached the cytosol\u00a0[114].\nAAPS PharmSciTech (2023) 24:124\n1 3\n124 Page 16 of 24"

            "text": "Emil Fischer carried out the first effective coupling of two amino acids in 1903 using acyl chlorides, but at the time, no adequate amino-protecting group was available for the synthesis of longer peptides. Bergmann and Zervas\u2019 and other inventors\u2019 discovery of the benzyloxycarbonyl-protecting group enabled the production of the neurohypophysial nonapeptide hormone oxytocin, for which du Vigneaud won the Nobel Prize in 1955. The invention of solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) by Bruce Merrifield, a trailblazer in the field, eased the time-consuming and difficult stages of purification involved in solution phase synthesis\u00a0[115, 116].\nThe basic idea behind solid-phase peptide synthesis is resin preparation, in which the amino acid is joined to the resin by carboxyl, hydroxyl (or chloro), and amino groups to create ester- or amide-linked peptides, which give us a C-terminal acid or amide peptide, respectively. The first peptide loads into the resin with a straight, linear path from the C-terminal to the N-terminal. Here, where urethane derivatives are frequently utilized, many cycles of deprotection and amino acid coupling reactions will take place; the amino group is protected by temporary protecting groups (T), while the side chain of the amino acid group is protected by permanent protecting groups (Pn). Under benign circumstances, it is simple to remove the temporary protective group (T), preventing the peptide from becoming epimerized. Filtration and washing cycles are used to get rid of excess reactants. So, the required sequence of the peptide is achieved by repeatedly performing deprotection and coupling reactions. Finally, the peptide is released from the resin along with the Pn side chain. The desired sequence of peptides necessary for distribution via the phospholipid bilayer can be generated using this accepted methodology for solid-phase peptide synthesis\u00a0[115, 116].\nPolymer\u2011Lipid Hybrid Nanoparticles Decorated with\u00a0Cell\u2011Penetrating Peptides for\u00a0Therapeutic Applications\u2014Cancer Therapy\nThe hybrid system can take advantage of polymeric and lipid nanoparticles and can also encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. The targeting of this hybrid system can be achieved by conjugating or decorating the surface with the CPPs, which help to bind the specific receptors. On the other hand, it can also be used to overcome the MDR associated with certain types of cancer.\nOne such example is using a CPP called RGD peptide to decorate the surface of the PLHNs containing the\nhydrophilic or lipophilic chemotherapeutic agent to target the integrin receptors overexpressed in certain types of cancer. Integrin is a cell surface protein that is important for cell adhesion which is composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits non-covalently bond to each other\u00a0[117]. During angiogenesis, integrin is involved in regulating cell growth, survival, and migration. These integrins include the heterodimers \u03b11\u03b21, \u03b12\u03b21, \u03b14\u03b21,\u03b15\u03b21, \u03b16\u03b21, \u03b16\u03b24, \u03b19\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, and \u03b1v\u03b25\u00a0[118].\u00a0One of the models of endothelial apoptosis is the caspase activation model, in which RGD peptides directly activate caspases that trigger apoptosis, and the RGD peptide also has a binding site in an integrin that leads to apoptosis\u00a0[117].\nShi et. al. developed a hybrid system using a W/O/W emulsion solvent extraction evaporation process with PLGA as a polymer and soybean lecithin as a lipid. The surface was then coated with RGD CPPs in order to target integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 which is overexpressed in 90% of glioblastoma multiforme. Due to receptor-mediated endocytosis, the RGD surface decorated polymer-lipid hybrid system (RGD-L-P) exhibited a higher absorption efficiency (in C6 cells) than PLGA, lipid nanoparticles, and the hybrid system without the RGD surface coating. Better tumor spheroid penetration confirmed the RGD-L-P\u2019s ability to target C6 cells that express integrin 3. RGD-L-P loaded with docetaxel showed greater cytotoxicity in C6 cells due to rapid internalization facilitated by the RGD peptide sequence. Biodistribution studies using DiR were conducted using near-infrared fluorescence probes, which showed that DiR-loaded RGD-L-P showed better brain-localized fluorescence signals, suggesting better localization and specific binding. Altogether, these findings suggest that RGD-PLHNs are a potential drug delivery strategy for the targeted therapy of GBM\u00a0[119].\nIn order to administer isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a dietary supplement with natural anti-breast cancer properties but poor transport and limited bioavailability, Gao et al. also created a lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle. A method known as modified single-step nanoprecipitation was used to synthesize the hybrid system containing PLGA as a polymer and lecithin as a lipid. The surface of the hybrid system is conjugated with an iRGD peptide so as to preferentially bind \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin receptors and Nrp1 receptors (permeability-regulating receptors). Results showed higher cellular accumulation, cell toxicity, and apoptosis against breast cancer cells. Higher cellular accumulation was attributed to the surface conjugation of the iRGD peptide onto the hybrid system, which recognizes integrin receptors overexpressed in breast cancer cells, which resulted in rapid internalization and longer circulation due to the stealth nature of the hybrid system, resulting in enhanced inhibition of tumor growth\u00a0[120].\nWang et al. reported the used of RGD peptide with the paclitaxel (PTX) in the form of redox-sensitive lipid-polymer\nAAPS PharmSciTech (2023) 24:124\n1 3\nPage 17 of 24 124\nnanoparticles (LPNs) along with its prodrug form and also used cispaltin (CDDP) in order to deliver PTX in the form of dual-loaded drug delivery system. LPN was prepared using PLGA as a polymer and soybean lecithin as a lipid system by the emulsification-sonication method. Lung cancer cells and tumor-bearing animal models were used to assess the anticancer efficacy of PTX-loaded LPNs in vitro and in vivo. The IC50 values of the PTX-loaded LPN when compared others showed much stronger anticancer activity. The most effective anticancer effectiveness was also demonstrated by RGD-modified PTX or CDDP LPNs, which reduced mouse tumor size with less systemic toxicity\u00a0[121]."

There are at least 25 distinct integrins that can be created from the 18\u03b1 and 8\u03b2 subunits. Integrins function as crucial surface adhesion and cell signaling receptors, which have an impact on growth factor signaling, cell survival, proliferation, and migration\u00a0[118]. They may also have a significant impact on tumor behavior and metastasis. Therefore, targeting the over expressed integrins in many type of cancers helps in effective delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent. One such approach to target integrin receptor is using CPPs, called RGD peptide (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) which recognizes integrin receptors mainly integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b21, and \u03b1v\u03b25 which are over expressed in many types of cancer and therefore brings about effective targeting. Yang et al. used modified emulsification technique to develop and optimize lipid-polymer hybrid NPs for targeted delivery. The PLHNs core was made up of PLGA whose 90% of the surface was coated with lipid monolayer using egg lecithin (EPC) and DSPE-PEG. In addition, hybrid NPs loaded with 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide were created to target integrin 3-positive breast cancer cells. It abundantly expressed integrin 3 and as a result, head-to-tail cyclic RGDcontaining peptides, or c(RGDyk), have a high affinity for their overexpressed integrin 3 receptors, resulting in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Initial DSPE-PEG-OH synthesis was followed by succinic anhydride treatment and RGDyk peptide conjugation. This DSPE-PEGc(RGDyk) was conjugated to the surface of the prepared polymerlipid hybrid structure. The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity study revealed enhanced permeability to tumor cells\nvia endocytosis and an increased ability to kill cancerous cells due to the conjugation of the cell-penetrating peptide, c(RGDyk). The HCPT, which was encapsulated into hybrid NPs, showed higher drug loading compared to PLGA NPs alone\u00a0[122]. Using an emulsification solvent volatilization method, Zhao et al. reported the utilization of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide\u2013modified lipid shell and polymer-core hybrid nanoparticles (lpNPs) loaded with curcumin (Cur). PLGA-mPEG was used as the polymer core with lecithin/cholesterol surface\u2013coated lipids. In order to improve targeting, lpNPs were surface decorated with Chol\u2013PEG\u2013RGD. Cytotoxicity analysis results showed that the curcumin-encapsulated RGD adorned lpNPs maintained strong antitumor activities. A subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor model was significantly more sensitive to curcumin-loaded RGD-lpNPs for arresting tumor growth. The results of immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry analysis showed a higher number of apoptotic cells, a reduced number of microvessels, and a reduced number of proliferative cells in comparison to those using curcumin-free RGD-lpNPs. Curcumin-loaded RGD-lpNPs are a strong formulation of curcumin that targets tumors because of their enhanced antitumor effect in melanoma [123]. Zang et al. reported the used of PLHNs to administer doxorubicin (DOX) and sorafenib (SOR) simultaneously, shell-core lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) coated with the iRGD (CPPs) which can be used to achieve tumor-targeting delivery. Human liver cancer cells that expressed integrin showed synergistic cytotoxicity, pro-apoptotic potential, and enhanced internalization rates of both DOX and SOR after adding iRGD to the hybrid system. DOX + SOR with iRGD NPs had a longer circulation and bioavailability, according to in vivo pharmacokinetic research. More impressively, DOX + SOR with iRGD PLHNs markedly improved antitumor effectiveness in\u00a0mice models with hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts\u00a0[124].\nCD13 Receptor Targeting Many different forms of solid tumors exhibit high CD13 expression. A multipurpose protein receptor called CD13, tumors use it to grow, invade, and spread. One of the CPPs named kNGR (Asn-Gly-Arg) peptide can target by recognizing and binding to the overexpressed specific isoform of CD13 receptors in solid cancers\u00a0[125]. Gupta et al., in his project used kNGR peptide which was attached to lipid-polymer-based nanoparticles to deliver paclitaxel (PTX), an anticancer agent. Spectral analysis was used to construct and analyze the kNGR-PEGDSPE compound. The dual-targeted PLGA-lecithin-PEG core\u2013shell nanoparticles (PLNs-kNGR-NPs) were made using a modified nanoprecipitation process.

            "text": "PLNHs give excellent properties and greater advantages as a drug delivery vehicle for both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. The preparation method determines the type of PLHNs produced which can act either target the intestinal cells for the oral absorption or can also bio-mimic the systemic circulation in order to carry some specific drugs. CPPs when combined with the PLHNs not only aid their penetration, but also help in targeting several types of tumors, their microenvironment and the specific over expressed receptors. Therefore, we can conclude by saying that PLHNs conjugated with the CPPs act as a greater formulation overcoming several barriers.\nAbbreviations DNA:\u00a0 Deoxyribonucleic acid; RNA:\u00a0 Ribonucleic acid; SLN :\u00a0Solid lipid nanoparticles; NLC:\u00a0Nanostructured lipid carriers; RES:\u00a0Reticuloendothelial system; PEG:\u00a0Polyethylene glycol; PLGA:\u00a0Poly(lactide-co-glycolide); FDA:\u00a0Food and Drug Administration; PVP:\u00a0Poly-vinyl pyrrolidone; PVA:\u00a0Poly-vinyl alcohol; PG:\u00a0Polyglycerol; PLD:\u00a0Polyethylene glycol liposome doxorubicin; PLHNs:\u00a0Polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles; PTDs:\u00a0Protein-transduction domains; CPPs:\u00a0Cell-penetrating peptides; MAPs:\u00a0Membrane active peptides; HIV-1:\u00a0Human immuno-deficiency virus-1; PCL:\u00a0Polycaprolactone; PLA:\u00a0Polylactic acid; PbAE:\u00a0Poly(beta-amino-ester); siRNA:\u00a0Small interfering RNAs; RBC:\u00a0Red blood cells; ESE:\u00a0Emulsification solvent evaporation; O/W:\u00a0Oil in water; W/O:\u00a0Water in oil; W/O/W:\u00a0Water in oil in water; TAGs:\u00a0Triacylglycerols; M cells:\u00a0Microfold cells; GLAT:\u00a0Gutassociated lymphoid tissue; DAGs:\u00a0Diacylglycerols; MAG:\u00a0Monoacylglycerols; MGATs:\u00a0Monoacylglycerol acyltransferases; DGATs:\u00a0Diacylglycerol acyltransferases; CoA:\u00a0Coenzyme A; ACATs:\u00a0Cholesterol acyltransferases; PCTVs:\u00a0Pre-chylomicron transport vesicles; apoB48:\u00a0Apolipoprotein B-48; MTP:\u00a0Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; Cu:\u00a0Curcumin; Tmx:\u00a0Tamoxifen; LPHNP:\u00a0Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles; AO/PI:\u00a0Acridine orange/propidium iodidestaining; P53:\u00a0Tumor protein gene; MMP-2,9:\u00a0Metalloproteinase gene; ERL:\u00a0Erlotinib; BEV:\u00a0Bevacizumab; NSCLC:\u00a0Non-small cell lung cancer; HA:\u00a0Hyaluronic acid; NaCl:\u00a0Sodium chloride; DOX:\u00a0Doxorubicin; EDL:\u00a0Edelfosine; MTT:\u00a0 (3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide); LPNs:\u00a0Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles; CBP:\u00a0 Carboplatin; PTX:\u00a0 Paclitaxel; MDR:\u00a0 Multidrug resistance; PSO:\u00a0Psoralen; MCF-7:\u00a0Michigan Cancer Foundation-7; HEPG2 cells:\u00a0Hepatoblastoma cell line; ROS:\u00a0Reactive oxygen species; NO:\u00a0Nitric oxide; NOPD:\u00a0Nitric oxide photodonor; NPs:\u00a0Nanoparticles; PDT:\u00a0Photodynamic treatment; pTHPP:\u00a05,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4hydroxy-phenyl)-21H,23H-porphine; Cas9/CRISPR-associated 9:\u00a0 Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\u2013associated protein 9; TMZ:\u00a0Temozolomide; RGD:\u00a0Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid; cRGD:\u00a0Cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid; MGMT enzyme:\u00a0O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme; FUS:\u00a0Focused ultrasound technique; MB:\u00a0Microbubble; GBM:\u00a0Glioblastoma; BBB:\u00a0Blood-brain barrier; NIR:\u00a0Nearinfrared radiation; GSH- Pt (IV):\u00a0Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive platinum (IV); Pt (IV):\u00a0Platinum IV; SV40 protein:\u00a0Simian Vacuolating Virus 40 protein; NMR:\u00a0Nuclear magnetic resonance; CvME:\u00a0Clathrinmediated endocytosis (CME); iii) caveolae-mediated endocytosis; CME:\u00a0Clathrin-mediated endocytosis; FPE:\u00a0Fluid phase endocytosis; Src:\u00a0Steroid receptor coactivator; PI3:\u00a0Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinases; GTPase:\u00a0Guanosine triphosphatease; LDL:\u00a0Low-density lipoprotein; AP2:\u00a0Adaptor protein-2; PI(4,5)P2:\u00a0Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate; EAPs:\u00a0Endocytic accessory proteins; ATPase:\u00a0Adenosine triphosphatase; Cav:\u00a0Caveolae; CLICs:\u00a0Clathrin-independent\nTa bl\ne II\nI (c\non tin\nue d)\nSl .
