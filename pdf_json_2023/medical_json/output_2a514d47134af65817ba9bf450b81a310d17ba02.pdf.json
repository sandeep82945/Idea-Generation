            "text": "Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that broke out in China at the end of 2019 has taken hold of the whole world. COVID-19 is a flu-like illness characterized by acute respiratory symptoms. The COVID-19 virus is transmitted directly by respiratory droplets or indirectly by contact with surfaces contaminated by infected respiratory secretions1,2. Response to the infection can turn deadly, especially in older people and people with chronic illness and suppressed or weak immune systems. The World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11.03.202013. The coronavirus spread rapidly and caused panic and fear worldwide1,4. As of April 19, 2021, the number of confirmed cases worldwide was 141.057.106, with a total of 3.015.043 deaths. On the same date, the number of confirmed cases in Turkey was 4.268.447, with a total of 35.926 deaths5. Nurses have been working tirelessly over the last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic6,7. However, they are physically and emotionally exhausted due to the increased workload and experience fear because they come across grim news about the pandemic and are in constant contact with infected people. Therefore, they worry about contracting the virus and infecting their loved ones1,3,8. This situation may them more likely to provide low-quality care and make more medical errors. Therefore, authorities should evaluate nurses\u2019 physical and mental health during the pandemic and take measures to reduce their workload and provide psychological counseling and guidance to help them get through this tough time with as little stress as possible7,9,10. Professional commitment helps healthcare workers overcome the mental strain caused by the pandemic11,12. Nurses start developing professional commitment during their undergraduate years and build it up throughout their professional lives. Professional commitment determines how one practices one\u2019s profession. Nurses with professional commitment are more likely to be satisfied with their job and remain in the profession. Such nurses tend to provide better care, resulting in increased patient satisfaction6,13,14. Professional commitment has three dimensions: (1) willingness to make an effort, (2) maintaining membership, and (3) belief in goals and values14. The lower the professional commitment, the lower the care quality. Besides, nurses with low professional commitment experience disinclination and dissatisfaction when it comes to fulfilling their responsibilities, which may translate into less concern for patient safety and\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4314/mmj.v35i1.9\nmore medical errors12,14. Medical errors are unintentional undesirable situations that healthcare professionals can do during work. Medical errors can occur as a result of incompetence or negligence and cause harm to the patient15. Types of medical errors; drug and transfusion applications, hospital infection, patient monitoring and safety, falls and communication related medical errors. The main problem in medical errors is the violation of patient safety by acting against the principle of \u201cProviding benefit, not harming\u201d, which is one of the most important ethical principles. Nurses, who are responsible for the conduct of preventive, therapeutic and rehabilitative treatment and care services in health institutions, may tend to make medical mistakes while providing these services. This is because they are primarily responsible for medical practice and care16,17. Medical errors occur at any stage of health care and have physical, psychological, social, and economic consequences. Medical errors may be due to ignorance, inexperience, and carelessness. Healthcare professionals who experience burnout, fatigue, and sleep deprivation are more likely to make medical errors12,18,19. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between nurses\u2019 fear of COVID-19 and their professional commitment and tendency to make medical errors."

The demographic characteristics questionnaire: The demographic characteristics questionnaire was based on a literature review conducted by the researchers. The questionnaire consisted of ten items on age, gender, marital status, education, work experience, the number of patients cared per day, monthly total working hours before and during the pandemic, duty, and COVID-19 experience (having tested positive for COVID-19 before). The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S): It was developed by Ahorsu et al. (2020)2 and adapted to Turkish by Sat\u0131c\u0131 et al. (2020)22. The instrument consists of seven items scored on a five-item Likert-type scale (\u201c1 = Strongly disagree,\u201d \u201c2 = Disagree,\u201d \u201c3 = Neither agree nor disagree,\u201d \u201c4 = Agree,\u201d and \u201c5 = Strongly agree\u201d). The total score ranges from 7 to 35, which higher scores indicating greater fear of COVID -19. In the validity and reliability study of the scale, the Cronbach alpha value was found to be 0.8222. The Cronbach alpha value in this study was found to be 0.93. The Professional Commitment Scale (PCS): PCS was developed by Lu et al. (2000) to determine nurses\u2019 professional commitment23. The instrument consists of 26 items scored on a four-point Likert-type scale \u201c1 = Strongly disagree\u201d to \u201c4 = Strongly agree\u201d. The instrument has three subscales: (1) willingness to make an effort, (2) maintaining membership, and (3) belief in goals and values. The instrument was adapted to Turkish by \u00c7etinkaya et al. (2015)24. The Turkish version has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.90. The total scale score ranges from 26 to 104. The total \u201cwillingness to make an effort\u201d subscale score ranges from 13 to 52. The total \u201cmaintaining membership\u201d subscale score ranges from 8 to 32. The total \u201cbelief in goals and values\u201d subscale score ranges from 5 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher levels of professional commitment. The scale had a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.87 in the present study. The Scale of Tendency to Medical Errors (STME): It was developed by \u00d6zata and Altunkan (2010)25. The instrument\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4314/mmj.v35i1.9\nconsists of 49 items scored on a five-point Likert-type scale \u201c1 = Never\u201d to \u201c5 = Always\u201d. The instrument has five subscales: (1) medication and transfusion, (2) hospital infections, (3) patient monitoring and equipment safety, (4) falls, and (5) communication. The mean score is used for assessment. An increase in score indicates a low tendency to make mistakes. The Cronbach alpha value of the original scale was 0.9525. In this study, the Cronbach alpha value of the scale was found to be 0.98."

            "text": "In this study, in which the relationship between fear of COVID-19 in nurses and professional commitment and tendency to make medical mistakes was investigated, it was determined that there was a positive and significant relationship between fear of COVID-19 and professional commitment scale. It was observed that there was a positive and significant relationship between fear of COVID-19 and willingness to make an effort, which are sub-dimensions of the professional commitment scale, and belief in goals and values. In addition, it was determined that there was a positive and significant relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and the communication sub-dimension of the tendency to make medical mistakes. When the literature was reviewed regarding fear of COVID-19, professional commitment and medical error tendency, no study was found that addressed these three scales together. Nursing is one of the professions most affected by the pandemic, which has negatively affected many countries physically, socially, psychologically and economically in the 21st century. In this period, the increased workload of nurses due to the pandemic, the fear of COVID infection and transmission may cause them to leave their profession or make medical errors while performing their services. From this point of view, our study contributes to the literature by revealing the relationship between the fear of COVID, professional commitment and the tendency to make medical errors. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on our lives. Despite national and international preventive measures, the virus spread rapidly around the world, causing millions of infections, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. To date, there is no medicine for COVID-19. Another threat to global public health is the amplification of misinformation regarding vaccines on social media. On top of all those challenges, healthcare professionals also have to deal with physical and mental problems because they are in constant contact with infected people, and therefore, they are worried about contracting the virus and infecting their loved ones. In short, the pandemic has taken a tremendous physical and mental toll on healthcare professionals, leaving them face to face with fear and stress1,4,7,27,28. In this study, it was determined that nurses\u2019 fear of COVID-19 was moderate. Contrary to our research, in the study conducted with frontline nurses in China in 2014, it was reported that the fear of COVID is high, and that burnout, depression, anxiety and fear negatively affect the mental health of nurses in relation to each other4. In a study conducted with 314 frontline nurses in Arabia, it was reported that the level of fear was high and that fear and stress were related to each other8. The difference of these results from our study is thought to be due to the fact that they were conducted directly with nurses who care for COVID-19 patients. In studies conducted in the Philippines and Turkey, it has been reported that nurses\u2019 fear of COVID-19 is moderate, similar to our study28,29. However, it is a great challenge for them. Kheirandish (2020) reported that nurses were mostly worried about contracting the virus and infecting their loved ones or other patients3. Nurses are expected to overcome this fear and protect themselves against the virus while providing care and treatment. In our study, it was determined that the COVID-19 fear scores were significantly higher in women, those who had more than twenty patients who had daily care, and those who had not experienced COVID-19. In addition, a positive relationship was found between age and fear of COVID-19. It was observed that the scores did not differ significantly according to the education level and the period of experience in the profession. In a study, it was reported that, contrary to our study, the COVID-19 fear scores did not differ according to gender, but differed according to age, similar to our study. In the same study, it was reported that participants who received training on COVID-19 *Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed). **Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). FCV-19S: Fear of COVID-19 Scale. PCS: Professional Commitment Scale. STME: Scale of Tendency to Medical Errors.\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4314/mmj.v35i1.9\nexperienced a significantly higher rate of fear of COVID-19 than those who did not29. It can be thought that this situation is due to the fact that individuals who receive education are more aware of the seriousness of the infectious disease. In a study conducted with 100 executive physicians and nurses, women\u2019s psychological, somatic, social and economic phobia sub-dimensions were evaluated with a scale other than the COVID-19 fear scale used in our study, and it was reported that their fear of COVID-19 was high. It has been reported that the fear of COVID-19 is higher in nurses than in physicians, and the fear of COVID-19 decreases as the level of education increases30. The challenges brought about by the pandemic have taken a toll on nurses\u2019 professional commitment, which is affected by the increased workload, long shifts, stress, and disrupted social relationships9,28. Our participants had an aboveaverage professional commitment (Table 2), which has also been reported by earlier studies9,12. Professional commitment is one\u2019s attitude, belief, and behavioral intention toward one\u2019s job9,12,31,32. People with low professional commitment are more likely to leave their profession9,28,31. There was no significant difference in professional commitment levels between male and female participants , which has also been reported by earlier studies12,13,33. However, unlike our results, Mersin, al. (2020) reported that women had more professional commitment than men34. In our study, it is seen that professional commitment scores differ according to education (Table 3). Many studies support our research in this sense9,12,13,24. Contrary to our research, it was reported in a study that the occupational addiction of the participants did not differ according to the level of education35. Participants with 6 to 10 years of work experience had a higher PCS \u201cmaintaining membership\u201d subscale score than those with 11 to 15 years of work experience (Table 3). Uysal and Karakurt (2020) found a correlation between work experience and PCS \u201cwillingness to make an effort\u201d subscale scores12. Professional commitment helps nurses overcome workrelated problems and feel gratification in their professional life, resulting in patient satisfaction and safety. It also encourages them to fulfill their responsibilities and duties as members of the healthcare system9,14,31,36,37. Low professional commitment paves the way for patient safety violations, such as falls, medication errors, wrong interventions, misreporting, delayed care, etc. In other words, as professional commitment increases, the tendency to make medical errors decreases12,14. In this sense, our study is similar to the studies in the literature. In our study, it was determined that there was a high level of positive correlation between professional commitment and the tendency to make medical mistakes. In our study, it was observed that there was a weak positive correlation between PCS \u201cbelief in goals and values\u201d sub-dimension and STME \u201cpatient monitoring and equipment safety\u201d. The result of our study is similar to the literature12. In our study, it was determined that the tendency of nurses to make medical errors was low. In this sense, the literature supports our research38\u201341. It can be thought that this is due to the fact that nurses with undergraduate degrees are in the majority. Sweeney, LeMahieu, and Fryer (2017) conducted a survey on medical errors between 1990 and 2014 and reported that the most common errors were related to diagnosis (41.46%) and treatment (30.79%)19. Nurses in Turkey are not allowed to diagnose and administer medication without a physician order. Nurses administer medications and treatments prescribed by physicians, except in emergencies. They act in accordance with the verbal medical orders of attending physicians in unexpected situations. They take the necessary measures for patient and staff safety42. It is seen that many reasons such as insufficient number of nurses, insufficient care in care, heavy workload, short time allocated for each patient, high number of caregivers increase the probability of making medical errors38. In a study, it was determined that the factors causing medical errors were insufficient number of nurses (93.2%), excessive workload (92.3%), excessive patient burden (88.6%) and lack of knowledge (87.2%)43. In our study, it was seen that the tendency to make medical errors was affected by gender, education and the number of patients who were cared for. It was observed that the mean of propensity to make medical errors did not differ according to the experience of COVID. In a study conducted with 434 nurses, it was reported that the tendency of nurses to make medical mistakes changed significantly according to their education level, working style and liking the profession, but it was not affected by age, gender, and working time in the profession41. In another study conducted with 390 nurses, it was reported that 53.1% of the nurses made medical errors, the tendency to make medical errors was affected by age, gender, working time and working style (working in a day or night shift), and it was not affected by the education level and the unit they worked in40. In a study conducted with 237 nurses, it was reported that the tendency to make medical errors is affected by income, working time and the unit worked39."

            "text": "The study had some limitations. It cannot be generalized as it is a cross-sectional study. Culture, place of residence, lifestyle and psychiatric condition of the person can be effective on fear. Similarly, professional commitment may vary. Online data collection may have prevented participants from answering the questions as freely as they would have. Only volunteers were recruited. This was a cross-sectional study that focused only on nurses who were accessible through social media between January and April 2021. Therefore, we could not access nurses who did not have a WhatsApp or e-mail account. Nurses who had or had not had COVID -19 before were included in the study. But their vaccination status was not questioned. It is possible that the fears of those who have been vaccinated have diminished, and that those who have not had their fears persisted. This is an important limitation of the study."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "This study investigated the relationship between nurses\u2019 fear of COVID-19, professional commitment and tendency to make medical errors. The results of the study show that there is a weak positive correlation between fear of COVID-19 in nurses and professional commitment and tendency to make medical errors. The results point to a positive correlation between FCV-19S scores and PCS total and PCS \u201cwillingness to make an effort\u201d and \u201cbelief in goals and values\u201d subscale scores. This result indicates that nurses with a greater fear of COVID-19 are more committed to their job and more willing to make an effort, and believe in goals and values more. The results also show a positive correlation between FCV-19S scores and STME \u201ccommunication\u201d\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4314/mmj.v35i1.9\nsubscale scores, suggesting that nurses with a greater fear of COVID-19 are more likely to make medical errors related to communication. Female nurses have a greater fear of COVID-19 than their male counterparts. Nurses caring for many patients are more afraid of COVID-19 than those caring for few patients. Nurses who have not tested positive for COVID-19 are more scared of COVID-19 than those who have. Older nurses have a greater fear of COVID-19 than younger nurses. Nurses\u2019 professional commitment is affected by education, working hours, the number of patients cared per day, duty, and COVID-19 experience. Future studies should focus on physical and mental problems that nurses have been facing due to increased workload since the onset of the pandemic. In cases of COVID-19 and similar epidemics, both nurses and other healthcare professionals can be negatively affected by this situation, thereby reducing their commitment to the profession and their tendency to make medical mistakes."
