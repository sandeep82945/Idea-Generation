 Here are 5 potential future research ideas stemming from this paper:

1. Examine the role of fiscal policy coordination across countries in mitigating the negative spillovers of US monetary policy tightening. The paper suggests fiscal policy could complement monetary policy, but does not model fiscal policy interactions. Future research could analyze optimal fiscal policy responses. 

2. Incorporate financial frictions and banking sector risks more explicitly into the model. The paper finds equity prices fall more when US policy uncertainty rises, hinting at financial stability risks. An extension could model banking sector lending and risk-taking and how it interacts with uncertainty.

3. Analyze the distributional impacts of US monetary policy spillovers on emerging markets. The paper notes spillovers likely have heterogeneous effects. Future work could estimate distributional consequences across income/wealth groups. 

4. Explore alternative identification strategies for monetary policy shocks. The paper uses sign restrictions - future research could try external instruments or high-frequency identification to corroborate the baseline results.

5. Expand the sample to include more recent data. The paper's sample ends in 2019Q4, before the COVID pandemic. Updating the estimates using data through 2022 could provide insights into how spillovers have evolved.
