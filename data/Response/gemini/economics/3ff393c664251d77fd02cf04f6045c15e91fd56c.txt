1. **Investigate the impact of different bidding strategies on the market outcomes.** The paper assumes that all active consumers use a linear bidding strategy. However, other bidding strategies, such as quadratic or exponential bidding, could also be used. It would be interesting to study how the choice of bidding strategy affects the market outcomes, such as the clearing price, the allocated flexibility, and the PoA.


2. **Consider the impact of strategic behavior by the BRP.** The paper assumes that the BRP is a benevolent entity that acts in the best interests of the market. However, in practice, the BRP may have its own strategic objectives, such as maximizing its profit or minimizing its risk. It would be interesting to study how the strategic behavior of the BRP affects the market outcomes.


3. **Incorporate uncertainty into the model.** The paper assumes that the energy supply and demand are known with certainty. However, in practice, these quantities are often uncertain. It would be interesting to study how uncertainty affects the market outcomes. For example, one could consider a model where the energy supply and demand are modeled as random variables.


4. **Extend the model to consider multiple balancing markets.** The paper considers a single balancing market. However, in practice, there may be multiple balancing markets, each serving a different region or grid. It would be interesting to study how the interaction between multiple balancing markets affects the market outcomes.


5. **Develop a distributed algorithm for solving the game.** The paper proposes a centralized algorithm for solving the game. However, in practice, it may be desirable to use a distributed algorithm, which would allow the consumers to solve the game without sharing their private information with a central entity. It would be interesting to develop a distributed algorithm for solving the game and to study its convergence properties.
