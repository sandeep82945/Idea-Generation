We assume basic familiarity with computability theory and reverse mathematics, at the level of the background material in [8], for instance. On the reverse mathematics side, the two major systems with which we will be concerned are RCA0, the usual weak base system for reverse mathematics, which corresponds roughly to computable mathematics; and ACA0, which corresponds roughly to arithmetic mathematics. For principles P of the form (\u2200X) [\u03a6(X) \u2192 (\u2203Y ) \u03a8(X, Y )], we call any X such that \u03a6(X) holds an instance of P , and any Y such that \u03a8(X, Y ) holds a solution to X .\nWe begin by introducing some related combinatorial principles. For a set S, let [S]n be the set of n-element subsets of S. Ramsey\u2019s Theorem (RT) is the statement that for every n and every coloring of [N]n with finitely many colors, there is an infinite set H that is homogeneous for c, which means that all elements of [H ]n have the same color. There has been a great deal of work on computability-theoretic and reverse-mathematical aspects of versions of Ramsey\u2019s Theorem, such as RTnk , which is RT restricted to colorings of [N] n with k many colors. (See e.g. [8].)\nThe authors were partially supported by Focused Research Group grant DMS-1854279 from the National Science Foundation of the United States. Hirschfeldt was also partially support by NSF grant DMS-1600543, and Reitzes by NSF grant DGE-1746045.\nThe Thin Set Theorem is another variant of Ramsey\u2019s Theorem that has been studied from this perspective. It follows easily from Ramsey\u2019s Theorem itself.\nDefinition 1.1. Thin Set Theorem (TS): For every n and every coloring c : [N]n \u2192 N, there is an infinite set T \u2286 N and an i such that c(s) 6= i for all s \u2208 [T ]n. We call such a set T a thin set for c. TSn is the restriction of TS to colorings of [N]n.\nJockusch [9] showed that there is a computable instance of RT32 such that any solution computes the halting problem \u2205\u2032. As shown by Simpson [18], Jockusch\u2019s construction can also be used to prove that RT32 (and hence RT) implies ACA0 over RCA0. Wang [19] showed that TS, on the other hand, does not have this much power. Indeed, it has a property known as strong cone avoidance, which implies in particular that for every coloring c : [N]n \u2192 N and every noncomputable X , there is an infinite thin set for c that does not compute X . It also follows from strong cone avoidance that TS does not imply ACA0 over RCA0.\nAs shown by Seetapun [17], RT2k also fails to imply ACA0. Indeed, Liu [11, 12] showed that it does not imply the weaker system WKL0, which consists of RCA0 together with Weak Ko\u0308nig\u2019s Lemma, or the even weaker system WWKL0 consisting of RCA0 together with Weak Weak Ko\u0308nig\u2019s Lemma. Patey [14] showed that the same is true of TS.\nWe now turn to Hindman\u2019s Theorem. For a set S \u2286 N, let fs(S) be the set of sums of nonempty finite sets of distinct elements of S.\nDefinition 1.2. Hindman\u2019s Theorem (HT): For every coloring of N with finitely many colors, there is an infinite set S \u2286 N such that all elements of fs(S) have the same color.\nBlass, Hirst, and Simpson [1] showed that such an S can always be computed in the (\u03c9 + 1)st jump of the coloring, and that there is a computable coloring such that every such S computes \u2205\u2032. By analyzing these proofs they showed that HT is provable in ACA+0 (the system consisting of RCA0 together with the statement that \u03c9th jumps exist) and implies ACA0 over RCA0. The exact computability-theoretic and reverse-mathematical strength of HT remains open.\nThere has recently been interest in studying restricted versions of HT such as the following. (See e.g. [2].)\nDefinition 1.3. HT6n is HT restricted to sums of at most n many elements, and HT=n is HT restricted to sums of exactly n many elements. HT6nk and HT=nk are the corresponding restrictions to colorings with k many colors.\nDzhafarov, Jockusch, Solomon, and Westrick [5] showed that HT633 implies ACA0 over RCA0. Carlucci, Ko lodzieczyk, Lepore, and Zdanowski [3] did the same for HT624 . These principles are also complex in a more heuristic sense: There is no known way to prove even HT622 other than to give a proof of the full HT, which has led Hindman, Leader, and Strauss [7] to ask whether every proof of HT62 is also a proof of HT. This question can be formalized by asking whether HT62 (or HT622 ) implies HT, say over RCA0. A related open question is whether HT622 is provable in ACA0.\nThe principle HT=2 is quite different, as HT=2k follows easily from RT 2 k. Indeed, it was not clear even whether this principle is computably true until the work of Csima, Dzhafarov, Hirschfeldt, Jockusch, Solomon, and Westrick [4], who showed that it is not, and that indeed there is a computable instance of HT=22 with no \u03a3 0 2 solutions. (The same had been shown for RT22 by Jockusch [9], who also showed that every computable instance of RT22 has a \u03a0 0 2 solution, which implies that the same is true of HT =2 2 .) They also showed that there is a computable instance of HT=22 such that every solution has DNC degree relative to \u2205\u2032, and adapted this proof to show that HT=22 implies the principle RRT 2 2, a version of the Rainbow Ramsey Theorem, over RCA0. (See Section 3 for definitions.) In this paper, we study further versions of Hindman\u2019s Theorem, obtained by combining HT and its variants with the Thin Set Theorem.\nDefinition 1.4. thin-HT: For every coloring c : N \u2192 N, there is an infinite set S \u2286 N such that fs(S) is thin for c. We definite restrictions such as thin-HT6n analogously.\nIn Section 2, we give similar lower bounds on the complexity of thin-HT as Blass, Hirst, and Simpson [1] gave for HT, which suggests that thin-HT behaves like HT at least to some extent. Indeed, it seems possible that thinHT is equivalent to HT over RCA0. The situation for restricted versions is different, however. Clearly, thin-HT=n follows from TSn, but in fact so does thin-HT6n, due to the following fact.\nLemma 1.5. For each n and k, the following holds in RCA0 + TS n: Given ci : [N]mi \u2192 N for i 6 k, with mi 6 n for all i 6 k, there is a single infinite set T and a j such that ci(s) 6= j for each ci and each s \u2208 [T ] mi with i 6 k.\nProof. We use the fact that TSn implies TSm for each m < n, and proceed by external induction to prove the stronger assertion that for each j 6 k, RCA0 + TS\nn proves that there is an infinite set T and an infinite set C such that ci(s) /\u2208 C for each ci and each s \u2208 [T ]\nmi with i 6 j. We do the base and inductive cases simultaneously. For j+1 > 0, assume that that the assertion holds for j and let T and C be as above. For j+1 = 0, let T = C = N. Define d : [T ]mj+1 \u2192 N as follows. Partition C into infinitely many infinite sets A0, A1, . . . . Let d(s) = 0 if either cj+1(s) \u2208 A0 or cj+1(s) /\u2208 C, and for i > 0, let d(s) = i if cj+1(s) \u2208 Ai. By TS\nmj+1 , there is an infinite U \u2286 T that is thin for d. Let i /\u2208 d([U ]mj+1) and let D = Ai. Then U and D are infinite sets such that ci(s) /\u2208 D for each ci and each s \u2208 [U ] mi with i 6 j + 1.\nThis lemma allows us to get thin-HT6n from TSn by taking a coloring c : N \u2192 N and considering the colorings that map {a0, . . . , aj} to c(a0+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+aj) for each j < n.\nThere are also differences that have nothing to do with computability theory and reverse mathematics between thin-HT6n on the one hand, and thin-HT and HT6n on the other. The former remains true if we allow sums of non-distinct elements, but it is not difficult to show that the latter two do not. Similarly, the former remains true for colorings S \u2192 N, where S \u2286 N is any infinite set, while the latter two again do not.\nNevertheless, even thin-HT=2 still has a significant level of complexity. In Section 3, we show that all of the lower bounds mentioned above obtained in [4] for HT=2 still hold for thin-HT=2.\nIn Section 4 we mention some open questions arising from our results, and briefly discuss version of HT obtained by combining it with thin set theorems for colorings with finitely many colors."

            "text": "In this section, we show how to build on the proof of Theorem 2.2 of Blass, Hirst, and Simpson [1], which shows that there is a computable instance of HT such that every solution computes \u2205\u2032, to show that the same is true of thin-HT. We then derive a reverse-mathematical consequence of our proof.\nTheorem 2.1. There is a computable instance of thin-HT such that every solution computes \u2205\u2032.\nProof. As in the proof of Theorem 2.2 of [1], we write each number x > 0 as 2n0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 2nk with n0 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk, and define \u03bb(x) = n0 and \u00b5(x) = nk. A set S has 2-apartness if for every x, y \u2208 S with x < y, we have \u00b5(x) < \u03bb(y). Lemma 4.1 of [1] shows that from any infinite S we can compute an infinite set T with 2-apartness such that fs(T ) \u2286 fs(S) (and hence if fs(S) is thin for a coloring, so is fs(T )).\nLet x = 2n0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 2nk with n0 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk. Say that (ni, ni+1) is a short gap in x if there is an m < ni such that m /\u2208 \u2205 \u2032[ni+1] but m \u2208 \u2205 \u2032. Say that (ni, ni+1) is a very short gap in x if there is an m < ni such that m /\u2208 \u2205 \u2032[ni+1] but m \u2208 \u2205\u2032[nk]. Let sg(x) and vsg(x) be the numbers of short gaps and very short gaps in x, respectively. Note that sg is not a computable function, but vsg is.\nFix a bijection between N and the set of pairs (p, i) where p is prime and 1 6 i < p, and identify N with this set via this bijection. Define the coloring c by letting c(x) = (p, i) where p is the least prime that does not divide vsg(x) and vsg(x) = i mod p. We say that x has color (p, i) if c(x) = (p, i), and we also say that x has color (p, 0) or (p, p) if it has color (q, i) for some q > p, i.e., if every prime less than or equal to p divides vsg(x).\nLet Y be such that fs(Y ) is an infinite thin set for c. We can assume that Y has 2-apartness, by Lemma 4.1 of [1], as mentioned above. This condition ensures that if x, y \u2208 fs(Y ) and \u00b5(x) < \u03bb(y), and we express x and y as sums of sets F and G of distinct elements of Y , respectively, then F and G are disjoint, and hence x + y \u2208 fs(Y ). Say that S \u2286 fs(Y ) is \u03bb-bounded if there is a bound on the values of \u03bb(x) for x \u2208 S (which includes the case S = \u2205). Note that fs(Y ) itself is not \u03bb-bounded. Note also that the union of finitely many \u03bb-bounded sets is \u03bb-bounded. Say that a color j is almost absent from fs(Y ) if the set of x \u2208 fs(Y ) that have color j is \u03bb-bounded. (This definition includes the case j = (p, 0), or equivalently j = (p, p).)\nLemma 2.2. There are p and 0 6 i < p such that (p, i+ 1) is almost absent from fs(Y ) but (p, i) is not.\nProof. Let p be least such that there is a j for which (p, j) is almost absent from fs(Y ), which exists since fs(Y ) is thin. If p = 2 then (p, j+1) cannot be almost absent, since every number has color (p, j) or (p, j + 1). Now suppose that p > 2 and q is the preceding prime. Since (q, 0) is not almost absent from fs(Y ) and every number that has color (q, 0) has color (p, j) for some j, there is some k such that (p, k) is not almost absent. In either case, since having color (p, 0) is the same as having color (p, p), the lemma follows.\nFix p and i as in the above lemma.\nLemma 2.3. Let 1 6 j < p. Then S = {x \u2208 fs(Y ) : sg(x) = j mod p} is \u03bb-bounded.\nProof. Suppose S is not \u03bb-bounded. Let q0 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < qm\u22121 be the primes less than p. Since there are only finitely many sequences (k0, . . . , km\u22121) with ki < qi, there is such a sequence for which T = {x \u2208 S : (\u2200\u2113 < m) sg(x) = k\u2113 mod q\u2113} is not \u03bb-bounded.\nSince j 6= 0 mod p, and hence q0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 qm\u22121j 6= 0 mod p, there is a multiple n of q0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 qm\u22121 such that nj = 1 mod p (where q0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 qm\u22121 = 1 if p = 2). Since T is not \u03bb-bounded, there are x0 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < xn\u22121 \u2208 T such that each \u03bb(xk+1) is sufficiently large relative to \u00b5(xk) to ensure that (\u00b5(xk), \u03bb(xk+1)) is not a short gap. Then the short gaps in x0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + xn\u22121 are exactly the short gaps in x0, . . . , xn\u22121, so sg(x0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + xn\u22121) = sg(x0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + sg(xn\u22121). The latter is equal to nj mod p = 1 mod p, since each x\u2113 is in S, and is also equal to nk\u2113 mod q\u2113 for each \u2113 < m, and hence equal to 0 mod q\u2113 for each \u2113 < m, since n = 0 mod q\u2113.\nSince (p, i) is not almost absent from fs(Y ), there is a y \u2208 fs(Y ) that has color (p, i) such that \u03bb(y) > \u00b5(xn\u22121), and every number less than \u00b5(xn\u22121) that is in \u2205\u2032 is already in \u2205\u2032[\u03bb(y)]. Note that vsg(y) = 0 mod q\u2113 for each \u2113 < m, as otherwise c(y) would be of the form (q\u2113, k) for some 1 6 k < q\u2113. Now vsg(x0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+xn\u22121 + y) = vsg(y) + sg(x0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+xn\u22121), which is equal to i + 1 mod p, and to 0 mod q\u2113 for all \u2113 < m. So x0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + xn\u22121 + y has color (p, i + 1). As we can choose x0 so that \u03bb(x0) is arbitrarily large, (p, i + 1) is not almost absent from fs(Y ), contradicting the choice of i.\nSo by removing finitely many elements from Y if needed, we can assume that p divides sg(x) for all x \u2208 fs(Y ). We can now argue as in the proof of Claim 2 in the proof Theorem 2.2 of [1] to compute \u2205\u2032 from Y : Given n, find x, y \u2208 Y such that x < y and n < \u00b5(x). The short gaps in x + y are the ones in x, the ones in y, and possibly (\u00b5(x), \u03bb(y)). But if the latter is a short gap, then sg(x + y) = sg(x) + sg(y) + 1, which is impossible since p divides all three numbers. Thus n \u2208 \u2205\u2032 iff n \u2208 \u2205\u2032[\u03bb(y)].\nThe above proof can be carried out in relativized form in RCA0 except for two issues: One is that in RCA0 we cannot show that the union of finitely many \u03bb-bounded sets is \u03bb-bounded, which in general requires the \u03a001-bounding principle. Another is that being almost absent is a \u03a3 0 2 condition, so we cannot conclude in RCA0 that there is a least p such that there is\na j for which (p, j) is almost absent from fs(Y ). Since \u03a001-bounding follows from \u03a302-induction over RCA0, adding the latter to RCA0 is sufficient to get around these issues, so we have the following.\nTheorem 2.4. thin-HT implies ACA0 over RCA0 + I\u03a3 0 2.\nWe do not know whether the use of I\u03a302 in this theorem can be removed.\n3 Hard Instances of thin-HT=2\nIn this section, we show that all the lower bounds on the complexity of HT=22 obtained by Csima, Dzhafarov, Hirschfeldt, Jockusch, Solomon, and Westrick [4] still hold for thin-HT=2. (Of course, all upper bounds on the complexity of HT=22 automatically hold for thin-HT\n=2, as the latter follows easily from the former.) As in that paper, we use the computable version of the Lova\u0301sz Local Lemma due to Rumyantsev and Shen [15, 16]. In particular, we use the following consequence of Corollary 7.2 in [16] given in [4], with an addendum on uniformity as noted at the end of Section 4 of [4]. This uniformity, which in [4] is used only to obtain results on Weihrauch reducibility, will be essential in all our results, as their proofs will require applying Theorem 3.1 infinitely often.\nTheorem 3.1 (essentially Rumyantsev and Shen [16]). For each q \u2208 (0, 1) there is an M such that the following holds. Let F0, F1, . . . be a computable sequence of finite sets, each of size at least M . Suppose that for each m > M and n, there are at most 2qm many j such that |Fj | = m and n \u2208 Fj, and that there is a computable procedure P for determining the set of all such j given m and n. Then there is a computable c : N \u2192 2 such that for each j the set Fj is not homogeneous for c. Furthermore, c can be obtained uniformly computably from F0, F1, . . . and P (for a fixed q).\nWe will also rely in this section on arguments in [4] when they carry through in this case in an entirely analogous way.\nWe now introduce a notion of largeness that will be key to our iterated applications of Theorem 3.1. As in [4], we will be diagonalizing against \u03a302 sets, so this notion will be defined in terms of sets that are c.e. relative to \u2205\u2032. For a set A and a number s, we write s + A for the set {s + a : a \u2208 A}. We write We for the eth enumeration operator. Given e and s, for each x \u2208 W \u2205 \u2032\ne [s], let tx be the least t such that x \u2208 W \u2205\u2032 e [u] for all u \u2208 [t, s]. (I.e.,\ntx measures how long x has been in W \u2205\u2032 e .) Order the elements of W \u2205\u2032\ne [s] by letting x \u227a y if either tx < ty or both tx = ty and x < y. Let E n e [s] be the set consisting of the least n many elements of W \u2205 \u2032\ne [s] under this ordering, or Ene [s] = [0, n) if W \u2205\u2032\ne [s] has fewer than n many elements. If there is an s such that Ene [t] = E n e [s] for all t > s then let E n e = E n e [s].\nDefinition 3.2. For a binary function f , say that a set D is f -large if for all e and k such that E f(e,k) e is defined, we have |D \u2229 (s+E f(e,k) e )| > k for all sufficiently large s.\nNote that N is g-large for the function g(e, k) = k, and that f -largeness is preserved under finite difference. The following lemma captures the key property of this notion of largeness.\nLemma 3.3. From a binary function f and an f -large set D, we can uniformly compute a binary function f\u0302 and a splitting D = D0 \u2294D1 such that each Di is f\u0302 -large.\nBefore proving this lemma, let us derive some of its consequences, beginning with computability-theoretic lower bounds on the complexity of thinHT=2. A function f is diagonally noncomputable (DNC ) relative to an oracle X if f(e) 6= \u03a6Xe (e) for all e such that \u03a6 X e (e) is defined, where \u03a6e is the eth Turing functional. A degree is DNC relative to X if it computes a function that is DNC relative to X . An infinite set A is effectively immune relative to X if there is an X-computable function f such that if WXe \u2286 A then |WXe | < f(e).\nTheorem 3.4 (Jockusch [10]). A degree is DNC relative to X if and only if it computes a set that is effectively immune relative to X.\nThe proof of the following theorem shows how to obtain a hard computable instance of thin-HT=2 from Lemma 3.3.\nTheorem 3.5. There is a computable instance of thin-HT=2 such that any solution is effectively immune relative to \u2205\u2032, and hence has DNC degree relative to \u2205\u2032.\nProof. Let D0 = N and f0(e, k) = k. Given Dn and fn, let f\u0302n and Din be as in Lemma 3.3, let fn+1 = f\u0302n, and let Dn+1 = D 1 n. Note that the Dn are uniformly computable. Let c(x) be the largest n 6 x such that x \u2208 Dn. Then\nc is a computable coloring of N. If c(x) = n and x > n then x \u2208 Dn but x /\u2208 Dm for m > n, so x \u2208 D 0 n. Thus for each n, we have that the difference between c\u22121(n) and D0n is finite, and hence c \u22121(n) is fn-large.\nLet S be a solution to c as an instance of thin-HT=2, and let n be such that c(x + y) 6= n for all distinct x, y \u2208 S. For any e, if |W \u2205 \u2032\ne | > fn(e, 1)\nthen E fn(e,1) e \u2286 W \u2205 \u2032 e is defined, and hence c \u22121(n) \u2229 (s + E fn(e,1) e ) 6= \u2205 for all sufficiently large s. In other words, if s is sufficiently large then there is an x \u2208 E fn(e,1) e such that c(x + s) = n. It follows that E fn(e,1) e * S, and hence W \u2205 \u2032\ne * S, since E fn(e,1) e \u2286 W \u2205 \u2032 e . Thus we conclude that if W \u2205\u2032\ne \u2286 S then |W \u2205 \u2032\ne | < fn(e, 1). Since fn(e, 1) is computable as a function of e, it follows that S is effectively immune relative to \u2205\u2032, and hence has DNC degree relative to \u2205\u2032.\nNo infinite \u03a302 set can be effectively immune relative to \u2205 \u2032, so we have the\nfollowing.\nCorollary 3.6. There is a computable instance of thin-HT=2 with no \u03a302 solution.\nIt follows that thin-HT is not provable in WKL0, since the latter has \u03c9models consisting entirely of \u220602 sets. It was noted in [4] that HT =2 2 does not imply WKL0, and hence neither does thin-HT =2. Thus thin-HT=2 and WKL0 are incomparable over RCA0. In fact, as mentioned in the introduction, Patey [14] showed that TS does not imply WKL0, or even WWKL0, and we can easily adapt the proof of Theorem 3.5 to thin-HT=n for any n > 2, so we have the following.\nCorollary 3.7. For each n > 1, both thin-HT=n and thin-HT6n are incomparable with (W)WKL0 over RCA0.\nArguing as in the proof of Corollary 3.6 of [4], we have the following.\nCorollary 3.8. There is a computable instance of thin-HT=2 such that all solutions are hyperimmune.\nThe reverse-mathematical analog of the existence of degrees that are DNC over the jump is the principle 2-DNC, defined e.g. in Section 4 of [4]. Miller [unpublished] showed that 2-DNC is equivalent, both over RCA0 and in the sense of Weihrauch reducibility, to the following version of the Rainbow Ramsey Theorem, which was shown by Patey [13] to be strictly weaker than TS2.\nDefinition 3.9. RRT22: Let c : [N] 2 \u2192 N be such that |c\u22121(i)| 6 2 for all i. Then there is an infinite set R such that c is injective on [R]2.\nAs discussed in [4], the proof of Theorem 3.1 carries through in RCA0, from which it will follow that so does the proof of Lemma 3.3 that we will give below. Thus the proof of Theorem 3.5 also carries through in RCA0, except for one issue: Having |W \u2205 \u2032\ne | > m does not necessarily imply in RCA0 that Eme is defined. (The issue is that RCA0 does not imply the \u03a0 0 1-bounding principle.) However, we can get around this problem exactly as in Section 4 of [4], by using the principle 2-EI defined there, thus obtaining the following.\nTheorem 3.10. thin-HT=2 implies RRT22 over RCA0.\nWe can also obtain a Weihrauch reduction from RRT22 to a version of thin-HT=2 as in the final paragraph of Section 4 of [4], but we have to be a bit careful because in the proof of Theorem 3.5, the function witnessing that S is effectively immune relative to \u2205\u2032 is obtained uniformly not from S, but from an n such that c(x + y) 6= n for all distinct x, y \u2208 S. Let strong thin-HT=2 be the version of thin-HT=2 where a solution to an instance c consists of both a solution S to c as an instance of thin-HT=2 and an n as above. Then we have the following.\nTheorem 3.11. RRT22 is Weihrauch-reducible to strong thin-HT =2.\nWe do not know, however, whether this theorem remains true if we replace strong thin-HT=2 by thin-HT=2.\nNone of the above results depend on the addition function in particular, and can be adapted as in [4] to any function f : [N]2 \u2192 N that is addition-like, which means that\n1. f is computable,\n2. there is a computable function g such that f({x, y}) > n for all y > g(x, n), and\n3. there is a b such that for all x 6= y, there are at most b many z\u2019s for which f({x, z}) = f({x, y}).\nWe finish this section by proving Lemma 3.3.\nProof of Lemma 3.3. Let f be a binary function and D an f -large set. We will apply Theorem 3.1 to obtain a computable c : N \u2192 2. We then define Di = {n \u2208 D : c(n) = i}. The value of q will not matter here, so let us fix q = 1\n2 . Let M be as in Theorem 3.1.\nLet g be a computable injective binary function with computable image\nsuch that kg(e, k) 6 2 g(e,k) 2 and g(e, k) > M for all e and k.\nSay that s is acceptable for e, k if |D\u2229 (s+E f(e,kg(e,k)) e [s])| > kg(e, k) and\nfor every t < s such that (s + E f(e,kg(e,k)) e [s]) \u2229 (t + E f(e,kg(e,k)) e [t]) 6= \u2205, we have E f(e,kg(e,k)) e [s] = E f(e,kg(e,k)) e [t]. If s is acceptable for e, k then let Fe,k,s,0 be the first g(e, k) many elements of s+Ef(e,kg(e,k))[s], let Fe,k,s,1 be the next g(e, k) many elements of s + Ef(e,kg(e,k))[s], and so on, until Fe,k,s,k\u22121.\nLet F consist of all Fe,k,s,j for all e, k, all s acceptable for e, k, and all j < k. Then we can arrange the elements of F into a computable sequence of finite sets, each of size at least M . Fix x and m. If m is not in the image of g then there are no elements of F of size m. Otherwise, there is a unique pair e, k such that m = g(e, k), and all elements of F of size m that contain x are of the form Fe,k,s,j for some s 6 x. We can computably determine all such sets from m and x, and the definition of acceptability means that there are at most kg(e, k) 6 2 m 2 many such sets.\nThus the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1 hold, and hence there is a c, obtained uniformly computably from f and D, such that none of the sets in F are homogeneous for c. Let f\u0302(e, k) = f(e, kg(e, k)) and let Di = {n \u2208 D : c(n) = i}. Fix e and k such that E f\u0302(e,k) e is defined. If s is sufficiently large then s is acceptable for e, k, and Fe,k,s,j \u2286 s+E f\u0302(e,k) e for all j < k. For each j < k and i < 2, there is at least one x \u2208 Fe,k,s,j such that c(x) = i. Since the Fe,k,s,j are disjoint, |Di \u2229 (s + E f\u0302(e,k) e )| > k. Thus Di is f\u0302 -large."

Does thin-HT imply ACA0 over RCA0 (i.e., without assuming I\u03a302)?\nOf course, one way to give a positive answer to this question would be to show that thin-HT implies I\u03a302 over RCA0. If that is not the case, then it\ncould be interesting to try to determine the first-order part of thin-HT.\nQuestion 4.2. Is thin-HT provable in ACA0?\nQuestion 4.3. Does thin-HT imply HT, say over RCA0?\nIn the spirit of Hindman, Leader, and Strauss [7], we can also ask the less formal question of whether there is a proof of thin-HT that is not already a proof of HT.\nQuestion 4.4. Is RRT22 Weihrauch-reducible to thin-HT =2 (as opposed to strong thin-HT=2)?\nQuestion 4.5. What is the exact relationship between thin-HT=2 and each of TS2, RRT22, and HT =2?\nThere are also versions of the Thin Set Theorem for colorings with finitely many colors. For example, an instance of TSnk is a coloring c of [N]\nn with k many colors, and a solution to this instance is an infinite set T such that |c([T ]n)| < k. This principle and RTnk form the two ends of a spectrum of principles RTnk,j for 1 6 j < k, where an instance is a coloring c of [N]\nn with k many colors, and a solution to this instance is an infinite set T such that |c([T ]n)| 6 j. It would be interesting to pursue versions of HT based on these principles. One might hope to show, for instance, that there is a boundary between principles that \u201cbehave like HT\u201d, e.g. HT624 , which as mentioned in the introduction was shown to imply ACA0 in [3]; and those that \u201cbehave like versions of TS / RT\u201d, e.g. the thin version of HT624 , which can easily be shown to follow from RT24,2."
