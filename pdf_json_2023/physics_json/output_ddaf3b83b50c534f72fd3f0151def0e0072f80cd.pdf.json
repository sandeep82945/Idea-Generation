    "abstractText": "Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most abundant phthalate threatening public health-induced neurotoxicity. This neurotoxicity is associated with behavioral and biochemical deficits in male rats. Our study investigated the neuroprotective effect of ferulic acid (FA) on male rats exposed to DEHP. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups. Group I control rats received corn oil, group II intoxicated rats received 300 mg/kg of DEHP, group III received 300 mg/ kg of DEHP + 50 mg/kg of FA, and group IV received 50 mg/kg of FA, all agents administrated daily per os for 30 days. Anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, and recognition memory were assessed. Also, brain oxidative stress biomarkers, including brain malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as well as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were measured. Moreover, brain histopathology examinations associated with immunohistochemistry determination of brain caspase-3 were also evaluated. Furthermore, docking simulation was adapted to understand the inhibitory role of FA on caspase-3 and NO synthase. Compared to DEHP-intoxicated rats, FA-treated rats displayed improved cognitive memory associated with a reduced anxious state. Also, the redox state was maintained with increased BNDF levels. These changes were confirmed by restoring the normal architecture of brain tissue and a decrement in the immunohistochemistry caspase-3. In conclusion, FA has potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties that confirm the neuroprotective activity of FA, with a possible prospect for its therapeutic capabilities and nutritional supplement value.",

            "text": "Over recent decades, plasticizers have been used increasingly in industrial products such as automobiles, textiles, electronics, food packaging, and toys (Chang et\u00a0al. 2021). Among polyvinyl chloride plastic\u2019s most extensively utilized plasticizers is di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) (Ahmadpour et\u00a0al. 2021). It is the most ubiquitous phthalate compound detected in environmental and food samples (Liu et\u00a0al. 2023). Also, DEHP is one of the most prevalent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which is of special consideration because over 98% of the US population has measurable levels of DEHP and its bioactive metabolites (Hauser and Calafat 2005; Zota et\u00a0al. 2014). The Endocrine Society describes endocrine-disrupting substances (EDCs) as exogenous chemicals or mixtures of chemicals that interfere with any aspect of hormone activity (Zoeller * Rabie H. Fayed rhfayed@cu.edu.eg * Heba M. A. Khalil heba.ali315@gmail.com; heba.ali@cu.edu.eg 1 Veterinary Hygiene and\u00a0Management Department, Faculty of\u00a0Vet.

Medicine, Cairo University, Giza\u00a012211, Egypt 3 Pharmacology Department, Medical Research and\u00a0Clinical Studies Institute, National Research Centre, Giza\u00a012622, Egypt 4 Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, College of\u00a0Pharmaceutical Sciences and\u00a0Drug Manufacturing, Misr University for\u00a0Science and\u00a0Technology, 6Th\u00a0of\u00a0October\u00a0City\u00a012585, Egypt\n1 3\net\u00a0al. 2012). DEHP is contained in plastic materials without a chemical bond; hence, it can easily diffuse into the environment at high temperatures or upon contact with hydrophobic materials through different routes, including ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact, and even prenatally (Rocha et\u00a0al. 2017; Prasad 2021). Consequently, DEHP is regarded as a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that poses risks to public health (Ito et\u00a0al. 2019).\nMultiple\u00a0 studies\u00a0have\u00a0 reported\u00a0 that\u00a0DEHP\u00a0 is\u00a0associated\u00a0with\u00a0reproductive\u00a0system\u00a0dysfunction, developmental\u00a0 abnormalities,\u00a0 liver\u00a0 toxicity,\u00a0 and\u00a0alterations\u00a0 in\u00a0 thyroid\u00a0function (Cheon 2020; Mondal et\u00a0al. 2022). Meanwhile, some researchers have reported a strong association of DEHP with neurocognitive disorders (Lin et\u00a0al. 2015; Kim et\u00a0al. 2017) and neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as anxiety and memory impairment (Barakat et\u00a0al. 2018; Gascon et\u00a0al. 2015). Furthermore, perinatal exposure to DEHP could cause autistic-like behaviors in newborns (Li et\u00a0al. 2022) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children (Praveena et\u00a0al. 2020).\nDEHP-induced neurotoxicity in male rats has been confirmed, as male mice treated with low and high doses of DEHP exhibited behavioral deficits, including spatial memory impairments and anxiety-like behavior, and these effects were associated with androgen receptor (AR) downregulation in the hippocampus (Barakat et\u00a0al. 2018). In addition, DEHP is regarded as gender-specific because male mice, but not female mice, treated with DEHP exhibit spatial learning and memory deficiencies (Zhao et\u00a0 al. 2020). Further, DEHP has a detrimental influence on hippocampus development in male rats but not in female rats, as revealed by Smith et\u00a0al. (2011, 2015). Furthermore, male rats were sensitive to multiple doses of DEHP, as evidenced by an increase in Morris water maze (MWM) escape latency in males exposed to low and high doses of DEHP. However, females subjected to high doses of DEHP exhibited impaired working and spatial memory (Safarpour et\u00a0al. 2021). Also, postnatal exposure to DEHP did not affect the hippocampus of female rats (Smith et\u00a0al. 2011, 2015; Smith and Holahan 2014), indicating\u00a0 that males might be more susceptible to the neurotoxicity of DEHP.\nOxidative stress is characterized by an imbalance between the antioxidant system and pro-oxidant system resulting increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which are considered oxidizing compounds (Sies et\u00a0al. 2017). Multiple investigations have proven that oxidative stress triggers neurodegenerative disorders (Garcez et\u00a0al. 2022; Santos et\u00a0al. 2013). Furthermore, DEHP-induced neurotoxicity was linked with oxidative stress in the brain via an increment in MDA and intracellular ROS and a reduction in SOD\nand GSH brain levels (Wu et\u00a0al. 2019; Safarpour et\u00a0al. 2021).\nFerulic acid (FA) or (4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl) is a polyphenolic compound extracted from Ferula asafoetida. It can be found in fruits and vegetables, including broccoli, grapefruit, oranges, cereal bran, and beverages like coffee and beer (Silva and Poga\u010dnik 2020). Also, it is considered a powerful antioxidant that can scavenge hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and nitroso peroxide (Xie et\u00a0al. 2020). Moreover, FA can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and reach the hippocampus (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2011). Also, it inhibits neuroinflammatory responses and promotes hippocampal neurogenesis, exhibiting antiapoptotic, antitumor, and antithrombosis properties (Kaur et\u00a0al. 2022). Furthermore, FA was reported to increase neuronal survival (Kaur et\u00a0al. 2018) and has a protective function in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s (Di Meo et\u00a0al. 2020), as well as improving cognitive impairment (Hassanzadeh et\u00a0al. 2017; Wang et\u00a0al. 2017).\nExtensive research has shown that the heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase system (HO/BVR)\u00a0has a critical role in the central nervous system (CNS) (Mancuso and Santangelo 2014). It presents in two main forms, namely HO-1 and HO-2, and is responsible for enhancing cell stress response. Moreover, the deregulation of the HO-1 system was associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, neurotoxicity, and neuroinflammation (Nitti et\u00a0al. 2018). Mhillaj and his colleagues shed light on the implication of HO/BVR in improving the neurocognitive profile of FA-exposed rats (Mhillaj et\u00a0al. 2018). Also, Catino and his colleagues investigate the regulatory role of FA against trimethyltin-induced neuronal damage in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y via the Nrf2/HO-1 system (Catino et\u00a0al. 2015). Therefore, FA may be acting through upregulating the HO/BVR system.\nHerein, in our study, we investigate the therapeutic effect of FA and its capability to mitigate neurocognitive impairment and anxiety-like behavior induced by DEHP in male rats. That was achieved by measuring brain oxidative stress biomarkers, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and HO-1 levels with an assessment of brain histopathology and determining the immunohistochemical caspase-3 as an apoptotic marker of brain tissue. Moreover, functional and structural alterations of macromolecules within brain tissue cells were assessed using Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Also, in silico simulation was adapted to detect the pharmacokinetic behavior of the FA using ADMET and toxicity studies. Moreover, docking simulation was utilized to understand FA\u2019s binding affinity and inhibitory role on caspase-3 and nitric oxide synthase (NO).\n1 3"

It depends on the interaction between fear and curiosity exhibited by rodents when exposed to a novel but threatening environment (Raony et\u00a0al. 2021). The test was carried out in a wooden elevated maze consisting of two open arms and two closed arms 50 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 30\u00a0cm and 60-cm height from the floor, and the central platform united the four arms (Khalil et\u00a0al. 2021).

The test was conducted on a wooden apparatus consisting of three similar arms (120\u00b0, 40\u00a0cm long, and 35-cm height) identified as A, B, and C. In brief, each rat was randomly put at the end of one arm and allowed to move freely in all three arms for 5\u00a0min.

            "text": "DEHP is a ubiquitous toxicant in the environment with nonbiodegradable nature, leading to persistent environmental contamination and exacerbating the public health burden (Kumar et\u00a0al. 2021; Han et\u00a0al. 2022). Previous studies reported that exposure to DEHP causes neurotoxicity and neurobehavior deficits (Kang et\u00a0al. 2021; Nadeem et\u00a0al. 2021; Yang et\u00a0al. 2023). Therefore, our study investigates the neuroprotective effect of FA against neurotoxicity induced by DEHP. The current study demonstrates that FA therapy improves the behavior deficits of DEHP-intoxicated rats, including anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, and long-term memory. Also, brain oxidative stress biomarkers, BDNF, and HO-1 have been enhanced in the DEHP + FA group compared to DEHP-intoxicated rats. Moreover, FA has a high BBB penetrance, resulting in a neuroprotective effect against structural and functional alterations in lipid, protein, and nucleic acid levels in DEHP + FA rats compared to intoxicated rats, as shown in slico and FTIR spectroscopy. Further, FA restored the normal architecture of brain tissue\nwith a significant decrease in caspase-3 expression in the DEHP + FA group compared to the DEHP-intoxicated rats.\nNeurobehavioral deficits induced by DEHP were investigated using the EPM to evaluate anxiety-like behavior, Y-maze to assess spatial working memory, and NOR to measure long-term memory. DEHP-intoxicated rats exhibited anxiety-like behavior that was visualized by increased duration in the closed elevated arm with an increasing number of entries of the closed arm that indicates an anxious state of DEHP-intoxicated rats compared to other groups. Our results agree with previous studies (Barakat et\u00a0al. 2018; Minatoya and Kishi 2021). In contrast, few studies have found that prenatal or adolescent male rats exposed to low doses of DEHP did not exhibit anxietylike behavior (Sellinger et\u00a0al. 2020; Khalifa et\u00a0al. 2023). On the contrary, FA reversed the anxious state of DEHPintoxicated rats, confirming the neuroprotective effect of FA and supported by a previous study (Deng et\u00a0al. 2022).\nSimilarly, we evaluated rats\u2019 spatial working and longterm memory using the Y-maze test and NOR. DEHP-intoxicated rats showed impairment in SAP that was visualized in the Y-maze test. While in the NOR, there is a decline in the discrimination ratio and preference for novel object %,\n1 3\nindicating recognition and long-term memory deficit compared to control. These results agree with Ran et\u00a0al. (2019) and Safarpour et\u00a0al. (2021), which reported neurocognitive deficits in rats exposed to different doses of DEHP. On the\u00a0contrary, the working memory of male and female pups exposed to low doses of DEHP was not significantly affected (Safarpour et\u00a0al. 2021). Nevertheless, the administration of FA showed a significant improvement in the discrimination ratio and preference for the novel object %, which is crucial to long-term memory and learning ability. Our results agree with previous studies (Park et\u00a0al. 2022; Wang et\u00a0al. 2021).\nNitric oxide (NO) is a unique neuromodulator gasotransmitter implicated in multiple neurodegenerative illnesses, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). NO is considered an endogenous molecule synthesized\u00a0from L-arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and several of NO\u2019s central activities depend\u00a0on NOS (Dubey et\u00a0al. 2020). Further, NO is a crucial molecule for learning and memory since it modulates synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation, which are vital steps for learning and memory (Domek-\\ Lopaci\u0144ska and Strosznajder 2010). Also, NO produced by NOS or released from an endogenous S-nitrosothiol, GSNO, may upregulate the antioxidative thioredoxin system and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein via cGMP-dependent processes.\nNO has also been proven to have direct antioxidant effects by reacting with free radicals and iron-oxygen complexes (Dubey et\u00a0al. 2018). Furthermore, oxidative stress is one of the critical mechanisms of DEHP-induced neurotoxicity, leading to neurobehavior impairments (Tang et\u00a0al. 2015).\nIn our study, DEHP-intoxicated rats exhibited high lipid peroxidation levels (MDA) and brain NO, as well as a diminishment in GSH and SOD compared to other groups. Our results are in agreement with Safarpour et\u00a0al. (2021). Conversely, FA-treated rats displayed a significant decline in levels of MDA and NO and significantly improved levels of GSH and SOD. These results are consistent with previous studies (Bao et\u00a0al. 2019; Singh et\u00a0al. 2021), which confirmed that FA possesses antioxidant properties and could inhibit oxidative stress. In addition, HO-1 upregulation is considered a natural defense mechanism against oxidative stress in brain tissue (Nitti et\u00a0al. 2018). Herein, DEHP-intoxicated rats displayed reduced HO-1 levels compared to other groups. However, FA-treated rats exhibited a marked increase in HO-1 brain levels. This finding is in agreement with previous studies (Catino et\u00a0al. 2015; Mhillaj et\u00a0al. 2018).\nMoreover, the neuroprotective action of HO-1 is not limited only to its antioxidant activity but also to the\n1 3\nenhancement of neurotrophic factor production (Hung et\u00a0al. 2010). BDNF is a protein belonging to the neurotrophin subfamily that has a crucial role in various aspects of CNS, including neural survival, synaptic plasticity, spatial working memory, and long-term memory (Lu et\u00a0al. 2018). BDNF maintains neural survival and synaptic transmission, and its deficiency is associated with the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases (Smith and Holahan 2014). BDNF has been linked to the etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and its expression is reduced in the hippocampus and several cortical regions of Alzheimer\u2019s patients (Tian et\u00a0al. 2014). In our study, DEHP-intoxicated rats significantly reduced BDNF levels compared to the control group. These findings are consistent with prior research confirming reduced levels of BDNF in neurotoxicity rat models induced by other toxicants (Abbas et\u00a0al. 2022; Lee et\u00a0al. 2022). Moreover, our study agrees with Smith and Holahan (2014), who reported that postnatal administration of DEHP to male rats decreases the expression of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus by an average of 50% compared to control male rats. Also, it has been observed that prenatal toxicity by DEHP induces spatial learning and working memory deficits associated with the reduction of BDNF levels in either the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex, which are recovered by exercise training during childhood-adolescence in male rats (Wang et\u00a0al. 2020; Sun et\u00a0al. 2021). However, FA administration showed an improvement in BDNF levels. These results are in agreement with Sasaki et\u00a0al. (2019) and Nakayama et\u00a0al. (2020).\nSeveral studies have stated the significance of BDNF-NO interactions and established that both molecules have similar biological effects on neurons, such as in multiple neuronal systems\u2019 growth, development, and functionality (Tian et\u00a0al. 2014). It has been reported that endogenous NO regulates BDNF production. Moreover, BDNF stimulates neuronal NOS (nNOS) gene expression and NO generation, while NO synthesis elevates BDNF levels (Cheng et\u00a0al. 2003; Chen et\u00a0al. 2006). Additionally, NO enhances BDNF levels, stimulating neurogenesis in the hippocampus and improving memory (Lee et\u00a0al. 2002). Our findings are consistent with Beheshti et\u00a0al. (2021), who found scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment by disrupting oxidative stress redox such as increased NO, promoting neuroinflammation, and decreasing BDNF, which was mitigated by the Ta bl e 2 A D M ET p ro pe rti es o f f er ul ic a ci d by P ro To\nx on\nlin e\nto ol\nTo xi\nci ty\nEx cr\net io\nn M\net ab\nol is\nm D\nist rib\nut io\nn A\nbs or\npt io\nn\nC la\nss LD\n50 (m\ng/ kg\n) H\nep at\no to\nxi ci\nty A\nm es\nto xi\nci ty\nTo ta\nl c le\nar an\nce C\nY P3\nA 4\nin hi\nbi to\nr C\nY P2\nD 6\nin hi\nbi to\nr C\nN S\nB B\nB V\nD ss\nC ac\no2\nSk in\nIn te\nsti na\nl\n4 2.\n28 2\nN o\nN o\n0. 62\n3 N\no N\no \u2212\n2. 61\n2 \u2212\n0. 23\n9 \u2212\n1. 36\n7 0.\n17 6\n\u2212 2.\n72 93\n.6 85\n1 3\nrenin-angiotensin system (RAS). Furthermore, L-arginine, a precursor of NO, alleviated cognitive impairments, potentially due to a\u00a0NO-mediated improvement in insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM)-induced Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) (Miczke et\u00a0al. 2015; H. Dubey et\u00a0al. 2022a, b). Similar studies supported our results, such as Memarpour et\u00a0al. (2020) and Harikesh Dubey et\u00a0al. (2022a, b).\nMoreover, these changes were confirmed by several histopathological degenerative changes in all regions of the brain of DEHP-intoxicated rats: the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex in the form of pyknotic neurons and neuroglia with pericellular spaces and neuropil vacuolation. Disarrangement of pyramidal neurons from its linear arrangement was observed in the hippocampus. Our findings agreed with a previous study (Basha and Radha 2020), which reported shrunken and darkened pyramidal cells of the hippocampus CA1 region of rats orally gavaged di-n-butyl phthalate. Moreover, our results were supported by Ma et\u00a0al. (2015), who stated that the hippocampus of rats treated with diisononyl phthalate revealed disordered arrangements of neurons and deformations of cells. Due to its chemical structure, DEHP-induced neurotoxicity may be attributed to its ability to pass through the blood\u2013brain barrier, causing an increase in excitatory and decreased inhibitory amino acids (Seif et\u00a0al. 2017). On the other hand, the administration of FA resulted in marked recovery and maintenance of the normal architecture of neurons and neuroglia in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex. These findings settle the neuroprotective role of FA against DEHP neurotoxicity.\nCaspase-3 is a main proapoptotic mediator and marker of irreversible apoptosis (Khalifa et\u00a0al. 2017). Immunohistochemically, the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex-stained sections of DEHP-treated rats exhibited strong positive caspase-3 immunoexpression. These results agreed with Ma et\u00a0al. (2015), who mentioned that the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats treated with diisononyl phthalate showed a significant increase in caspase-3 expression compared to control rats. In contrast, it has been observed that administration of a low dose of DEHP did not significantly alter the expression levels of hippocampus caspase-3 in postnatally exposed male and female rats (Smith and Holahan 2014). However, the administration of FA significantly decreased caspase-3 immunoexpression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex compared to the DEHP group. These results conclude that FA had an antiapoptotic effect.\nOne of our interesting findings in the current study was the IR spectra retrieved from FTIR analysis. FTIR spectroscopy is a reliable biophysical tool that provides strong insight into macromolecule functional and structural alterations within tissue cells (Sedik and Amer 2022). In our\nstudy, we applied FTIR spectroscopy to investigate the neurotoxicity induced by DEHP in different animal groups and evaluate the role of FA to counteract the harmful effects of DEHP. IR spectrum from DEHP intoxicated rats revealed a marked reduction in the area and the intensity of amide I bands (\u03bd(C = O) of proteins) around 1654\u00a0 cm\u22121 and amide II bands (\u03b4 (N\u2013H) and \u03bd(C\u2013N)) of proteins around 1544\u00a0 cm\u22121 in the brain spectrum than the control group. This finding could signify the destructive effect of the DEHP and lead to a change in the composition of the whole protein pattern. This result agrees with a previous study (Ali et\u00a0al. 2018). Moreover, a marked reduction in the band areas around 900\u20131300\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the nucleic acid. DEHP also revealed an increase in the band area around 1735\u00a0 cm\u22121; carbonyl \u03bd(C = O) corresponds to lipids due to the drastic attack of free radicals produced from DEHP intoxication. The N\u2013H stretching of proteins was changed significantly in DEHP-intoxicated rats, leading to distortions in the intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the brain tissue proteins. Our findings aligned with a previous study (Forner-Piquer et\u00a0al. 2017). Administration of FA showed marked amelioration in the amide I and amide II bands, reducing the elevated band area towards proteins and lipids.\nADMET and toxicity studies were also performed to detect the pharmacokinetic behavior of FA and its toxicity level using the ProTox Online Tool (Banerjee et\u00a0al. 2018). Firstly. Skin permeability (Kp) is an important issue for improving drug efficacy. Kp of FA is \u2212 2.720\u00a0cm/h (less than \u2212 2.5) which predicts that FA has good skin penetrability. The Caco-2 permeability is used as an in\u00a0vitro model for the human intestinal mucosa to predict the absorption of orally administered drugs. A compound is considered to have a high Caco-2 permeability if it has log Papp values > 0.90\u00a0cm/s. FA has log Papp = 0.176, which is less than 0.9\u00a0cm/s, so it is predicted that FA has low Caco-2 permeability (Banerjee et\u00a0al. 2018). Also, the volume of distribution VDss value of the FA = \u2212 1.367, which is less than \u2212 0.15, so it can be predicted that FA could be distributed by providing an equal blood plasma level. FA can penetrate the BBB moderately as the log BBB value of the FA is \u2212 0.239, which means greater than \u2212 1. Log PS (the permeability of the blood-surface area of the CNS) value of the FA is \u2212 2.612, which is less than \u2212 3 that is unable to penetrate the CNS.\nMoreover, FA does not affect or inhibit the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes, so it can be predicted that it tends to be metabolized by the P450 enzymes in the body. Moreover, the log CLTOT value of the FA = 0.623\u00a0ml/min/kg predicts the renal excretion rate. Finally, FA belongs to category 4, and the AMES and hepatotoxicity prediction suggested its safety (Banerjee et\u00a0al. 2018).\nDuring drug discovery, the drug-likeness and rule of five proposed by Lipinski (2004) predict that poor absorption is more likely to happen if the drug does not exceed 5 hydrogen\n1 3\nbonds (2 in FA) and 10 H-bond acceptors (3 in FA); the molecular weight is greater than 500 (194.186 in FA), the calibrated logarithm P value is greater than 5 (1.4986 in FA), and the number of revolving bonds exceeds 15 (3 in FA). Therefore, it is highly favorable for FA to follow Lipinski\u2019s rule of five. Moreover, a docking study of FA was employed for the prediction of binding mode and to understand its inhibition ability on caspase-3 (PDB code 1RHR) (Gadelmawla et\u00a0al. 2022) and NO synthase (PDB code 4NOS) (Fischmann et\u00a0al. 1999).\nIn conclusion, due to its potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties, FA could mitigate the neurotoxic effect of DEHP. That could be visualized in improving anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, and recognition memory impairment. Furthermore, it could reestablish the brain redox system with increased BDNF levels in the brain tissue. Also, it could ameliorate structure and function changes in lipid, protein, and nucleic acid levels. Consequently, FA could restore brain architecture induced by DEHP. All these findings were confirmed by molecular docking studies on caspase-3 and NO synthase to understand the inhibitory ability of FA.\nThe limitations of our study are that the plasma and brain concentrations of DEHP are not evaluated. Also, the different antioxidant parameters and proinflammatory cytokines are not measured in different brain regions to correlate the biochemical results with the behavioral data. Therefore, further\u00a0research\u00a0is imperative to fill these knowledge gaps.\nAuthor contribution Rabie H. Fayed and Heba M. A Khalil contributed to the study\u2019s conception and design.
