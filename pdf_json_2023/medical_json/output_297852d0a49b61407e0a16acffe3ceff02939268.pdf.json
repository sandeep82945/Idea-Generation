            "text": "Pitted keratolysis (PK) is a corynebacterial infection of the\nsoles manifesting as multiple plantar pits caused by desmo-\nsomal alteration in the stratum corneum due to enzymatic\nactivity of P1 and P2 bacterial serine proteases [1]. Predis-\nposing factors include hyperhidrosis, occlusion, and reduced\nacidity of the skin surface [1].\nApart from the pits, patients may report burning sensa-\ntion and malodour. In some instances, PK may be accompa-\nnied with other corynebacterial infections such as erythrasma\nand/or trichobacteriosis axillaris [2]. Although the diagnosis\nis mostly based on clinical presentation, differentiation from\nclinically similar conditions, mainly including viral warts\nand tinea pedis, may sometimes be troublesome. In such\ncases, recognition of PK may be assisted by dermatoscopy\n(multiple crateriform indentations of the soles), Wood lamp\nexamination (coral red fluorescence of the pits), direct mi-\ncroscopy, and culture."

            "text": "UVFD is a novel diagnostic technique implementing UV\nradiation to produce fluorescent images based on Stokes\nshift phenomenon [3,4]. Coral-red excited emission spec-\ntrum is likely caused by the presence of Corynebacteria\nproducing coproporphyrin III [5]. We hypothesize that\nthe infection might begin within the acrosyringium as a\ncoral-red eccrine dots and clods that precede the develop-\nment of coral-red PRP and finally develop into coral-red\ncrateriform pits. The presence of the PRP pattern in mis-\ncellaneous dermatoses was summarized in Table \u00a0 1. The\nspecificity of our findings requires further confirmation\nin larger series of cases. In our opinion, these newly re-\nported UVFD clues might be helpful to promptly differen-\ntiate PK from its common clinical and/or dermatoscopic\nmimickers."
