1. **Investigate the use of other types of nanomaterials and/or sensor configurations for the classification of vegetable oils.** The study used screen-printed electrodes based on carbon nanotubes, graphene, and carbon nanofibers modified with gold nanoparticles. Other types of nanomaterials, such as metal oxides or conducting polymers, could be explored to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensors. Additionally, different sensor configurations, such as interdigitated electrodes or three-dimensional electrodes, could be investigated to enhance the performance of the sensors.


2. **Develop a portable device for the on-site classification of vegetable oils.** The current system is based on laboratory equipment, which limits its practical applications. A portable device that can be used in the field or at the point of sale would be a valuable tool for quality control and fraud detection. This could involve miniaturizing the sensors and integrating them with a data acquisition and processing system.


3. **Explore the use of machine learning algorithms for the classification of vegetable oils.** The study used multivariate data analysis techniques, such as principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis, for the classification of vegetable oils. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or artificial neural networks, could be investigated to improve the accuracy and robustness of the classification models.


4. **Investigate the relationship between the electrochemical response of the sensors and the chemical composition of the vegetable oils.** The study demonstrated that the electrochemical response of the sensors was correlated with the antioxidant activity of the oils. Further research could be conducted to investigate the relationship between the electrochemical response and other chemical properties of the oils, such as fatty acid composition, phenolic content, and tocopherol content. This could lead to the development of sensors that can be used to quantify these properties.


5. **Apply the developed sensors for the classification of other types of food products.** The sensors developed in this study could potentially be used for the classification of other types of food products, such as fruit juices, wines, and dairy products. This would require investigating the electrochemical response of the sensors to these products and developing appropriate classification models.
