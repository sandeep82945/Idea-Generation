    "abstractText": "Background It has been more than 20 years since the malaria epidemiologic shift to school\u2010aged children was noted. In the meantime, school\u2010aged children (5\u201315 years) have become increasingly more vulnerable with asymp\u2010 tomatic malaria prevalence reaching up to 70%, making them reservoirs for subsequent transmission of malaria in the endemic communities. Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria in schoolchildren (IPTsc) has proven to be an effective tool to shrink this reservoir. As of 3 June 2022, the World Health Organization recommends IPTsc in moderate and high endemic areas. Even so, for decision\u2010makers, the adoption of scientific research recommenda\u2010 tions has been stifled by real\u2010world implementation challenges. This study presents methodology, challenges faced, and mitigations used in the evaluation of the implementation of IPTsc using dihydroartemisinin\u2010piperaquine (DP) in three councils (Handeni District Council (DC), Handeni Town Council (TC) and Kilindi DC) of Tanga Region, Tanzania so as to understand the operational feasibility and effectiveness of IPTsc on malaria parasitaemia and clinical malaria",

Wards in the three study councils were the randomization unit (clusters). Each ward was randomized to implement IPTsc or not (control). In all wards in the IPTsc arm, DP was given to schoolchildren three times a year in four\u2011month intervals. In each council, 24 randomly selected wards (12 per study arm, one school per ward) were chosen as representatives for intervention impact evalu\u2011 ation. Mixed design methods were used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing IPTsc as part of a more comprehensive health package for schoolchildren. The study reimagined an existing school health programme for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) control include IPTsc implementation.\nResults The study shows IPTsc can feasibly be implemented by integrating it into existing school health and educa\u2011 tion systems, paving the way for sustainable programme adoption in a cost\u2011effective manner.\nConclusions Through this article other interested countries may realise a feasible plan for IPTsc implementation. Miti\u2011 gation to any challenge can be customized based on local circumstances without jeopardising the gains expected from an IPTsc programme.\nTrial registration clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04245033.

            "text": "Since 2000, the malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa has declined due to intensification and scaling up of control interventions [1]. However, this decline has catalysed a shift in the malaria burden toward children above 5\u00a0years [2\u20135]. In high-transmission settings, up to 70% of schoolaged children harbour malaria parasites [6]. Most of these children are asymptomatic, though malaria accounts for somewhere between 13 and 50% of all school absenteeism [7]. Thus, from an epidemiological point of view, school-aged children contribute substantially as parasite reservoirs to onward malaria transmission in the population [8].\nAccording to the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), malaria prevalence in Tanzania declined from an average of 18.1% in 2008 to 7.0% in 2017, marking an epidemiological transition from meso-endemic to hypo-endemic levels. However, this decline varies across and within regions and/or councils [9]. The nationwide school malaria survey conducted between 2014 and 2015 reported an overall prevalence of malaria of 21.6% by malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT), and ranged from < 0.1% to 53.0% among regions and from 0% to 76.4% among councils [3]. Therefore, the NMCP developed a Supplementary Malaria Midterm Strategic Plan (SMMSP 2018\u20132020) to customize malaria interventions by stratifying the burden of malaria in Tanzania mainland [9] in order to achieve goals set in the 2020 strategic plan and malaria elimination by 2030 [3, 10]. The SMMSP endorsed the implementation of the Intermittent Preventive Treatment in schoolchildren (IPTsc) in high endemic areas where, it predicted IPTsc to have limited\nadditional benefit on lowering prevalence but with higher impact on malaria cases averted. The SMMSP recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) alternative to the first-line treatment, and suggested dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) for such implementation.\nThe presence of a national school health programme (NSHP) that combines the schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminths (STH) control packages under an integrated neglected tropical diseases (NTD) programme [11], sets a precedent for future integration of malaria interventions into school health programmes [11, 12]. In addition, due to high primary school enrolment rate, schools act as platforms for health intervention delivery, including anti-malarial efforts. This study aim to explain the methods, challenges and mitigations used to evaluate the implementation of IPTsc using DP given three times a year, which provided evidence on the operational feasibility and impact of IPTsc on clinical malaria incidence in a high endemic area in Tanzania. The study also determined acceptability, impact of IPTsc on haemoglobin levels and asymptomatic parasitaemia in school-aged children. Similar methods can be adopted and replicated by other countries intending to implement IPTsc as per current World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation [13]."

The three councils border each other and have been classified as high malaria endemic strata by the NMCP [9] (Fig.\u00a01). Malaria transmission in this site occurs year-round, with two seasonal peaks following the long rainy season from March to May and the short rainy season from November to December (Fig.\u00a02). However, there are variations in malaria incidence among the three councils. In 2018, NMCP data showed Handeni DC had a much higher malaria incidence (413/1000 population) than the other sites (Handeni TC- [183/1000] and Kilindi DC [187/1000]). The existing mainstay for malaria control includes use of long-lasting insecticidetreated nets (LLINs) and prompt diagnosis and treatment with ACT, mainly artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria [14]. The intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) has also been implemented as a policy countrywide per WHO recommendation [14, 15]. As of 2018, Handeni DC, Kilindi DC and Handeni TC had 117, 111, and 33 public primary schools that enrolled 69,454, 61,258, and 19,549 schoolchildren, respectively. The three councils had 52 wards (20 in Handeni DC, 20 in Kilindi DC, and 12 in Handeni TC). There were only five private primary schools across the three councils, which enrolled a total of 627 schoolchildren. The study enrolled public primary schoolchildren from selected wards in the three councils with health teachers who had been involved in several mass drug campaigns implemented at schools by the NTD programme."

In all wards in the IPTsc arm (equivalent to half the number of wards in the councils), the interventional drug (DP) was given at an interval of four months, three times a year (March, July and November) in liaison with school schedules and seasonal transmission peaks (Fig.\u00a02).\nFor study evaluation on the intervention effectiveness, wards were selected from each council at random and distributed equally per study arm to act as representatives in the evaluation (Fig.\u00a0 3A). In these representative wards, one school was selected at random to provide evaluable children in the respective intervention. Following random selection, each school was anticipated to contribute 168 schoolchildren (a total of 4032 across all councils) to participate in monitoring or evaluation of the intervention under close supervision. Participants who became sick from uncomplicated malaria were treated with AL according to national treatment guidelines [14, 20]. Finger prick blood samples were collected from randomly selected schoolchildren for malaria microscopy (at baseline and during the last visit), and haemoglobin concentration measurement (at each visit) to determine prevalence of malaria and anaemia, respectively. Monthly reports on absenteeism and reported adverse events were collected in collaboration with schoolteachers, local health facility workers and the local community health workers (CHW)."

            "text": "IPTsc aims to treat and prevent malaria infections in school-aged children. The practice requires the administration of a full treatment course of an anti-malarial medicine at regular intervals to these children [13]. This will clear both asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria infections and, in turn, avoid the consequences of infection (e.g. anaemia, absenteeism, cognitive impairment) in school-aged children who are at high malarial risk [21\u201323]. Evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of the IPTsc strategy is robust in most subSaharan African countries [24]. As of June 3rd, 2022, the WHO recommends the rollout of IPTsc in moderate to high endemic transmission settings with Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence greater than 10% or an annual parasite incidence greater than 250 per 1000 [13]. However, these thresholds are not regarded as absolutes for determining applicability of the IPTsc recommendation [13].\nA fixed-dose combination (FDC) of DP (D-Artepp by Guillin Pharmaceuticals, China) has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). DP is registered by the Tanzania Medicines and Medical Devices Authority (TMDA) as an alternative drug for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. This drug is safe and efficacious at a body weight-associated dose of 60\u201373.9\u00a0mg/ kg, given once daily over 3\u00a0 days for uncomplicated\nmalaria [25, 26].

This explanation was critical to ensure the whole randomization process transparent to the local government officials. The list of wards in each council was entered into an Excel sheet from which a randomization code was made. The first half of selected wards were assigned to the IPTsc arm, while the remaining were assigned to the control arm. Again, in each study arm, half of the wards were randomly selected for effectiveness assessment; only one school was selected after randomization of the schools in the respective ward. Here, randomization was done by mixing small folded papers with one school\u2019s name on each piece. One of the CHMT members was then given an opportunity to pick any one of the mixed papers and read aloud the name of the school written on it. At this level, schools that were located in\nhard-to-reach areas were excluded from randomization following advice from the local authorities regarding convenience and logistics."

From the very beginning of study setup, the CHMT in each council was involved in a manner similar to that described by the NTD deworming programme. Along with the District Malaria Focal Person (DMFP), the District NTD coordinator, District Pharmacist, and the District school health coordinator (DSHCo), the study team developed a strategic plan for implementing IPTsc in each council. The resultant plan was to approach the communities via the district primary health care committee (DPHC) chaired by the District Commissioner in order to encourage local leaders to promote community awareness of IPTsc in various arenas including churches, mosques, school committees and parents\u2019 meetings, while also gaining local permission for intervention. At the school/village level, the study team invited village government leaders to centrally located sensitization meetings with school committees. The\nstudy team made regular visits at selected wards and schools, where collaborations with the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training (MESTVT) and the President\u2019s Office Regional Administration and Local Government (PO-RALG) at national and local levels were established.

Children were observed for 30\u00a0 min post-drug administration. If a child vomited within this time, he/she was given another dose and the information was documented. If a child vomited the study drug a second time, he or she was withdrawn from receiving the drug.\nIn the event a child missed IPTsc medication on day one, they were given an opportunity to start on the second day of the IPTsc round. If a pupil missed the second day\u2019s dose, the child was followed home by the CHW for information and administration of the second dose (this could be within the same day or on the third day). If a child missed two consecutive doses (i.e. day 2 and 3) then this was considered an incomplete course.\nIn this study, at least seven teachers were deployed depending on the number of pupils in a school.

A sample size of 140 schoolchildren was to be followed from each cluster/school to document cases of malaria. The study assumed correlation coefficient k = 0.2, a power of 80% and type one error (\u03b1) of 0.05. Hence, five clusters were required for each of the intervention and control arms. Similar parameters were assumed for Kilindi DC and Handeni TC, but with slightly lower incidence (183 cases per 1000). In this, seven clusters/ schools (distributed basing on number of wards ratio per council; 5 from Kilindi DC and 2 from Handeni TC) were required for each of the intervention and control wards from the two councils. To adjust for loss to follow-up, an attrition rate of 20% was considered from each ward/ school. Therefore, a total of 4032 schoolchildren from 24 schools (i.e.1680 from Handeni DC, 672 from Handeni TC and 1680 from Kilindi DC) were expected to be enrolled in the study (Fig.\u00a03A)."

Each class contributed 30 schoolchildren balanced by sex. Here, systematic random sampling was conducted, wherein boys and girls organized separately and a respective total number of schoolchildren (i.e. boys or girls) was divided by 15 to obtain the counting interval. A starting number was chosen from a random Excel-generated list of counting numbers (1 to 9) that was created for each school. Participants were then selected starting with an identified random number then followed by counting the interval obtained in between each new selection until the necessary number of participants, 15 per sex, had been achieved. In the event that a class had an even number of girls or boys or had less than 30 schoolchildren total, then another class with a greater number of schoolchildren would compensate for the missing ones (Additional file\u00a06: Appendix S6).\nAdditionally, for schoolchildren selected for evaluation of effectiveness of IPTsc, an informed written consent was obtained from their parent or guardian, which included an assent if a child was 11\u00a0years or older. For this evaluation, schoolchildren aged 5 to 15\u00a0years and of class one to six were eligible for enrolment. Parents, guardians and schoolchildren were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time. Baseline data on social demographics and well-being of schoolchildren were obtained from parents or guardians who had signed consent. At this stage, home visits were necessary for acquisition of global positioning system (GPS) satellite location data and verification of social demographic data\nwith regard to household characteristics. Given that only a portion of schoolchildren were to be enrolled for effectiveness evaluation, the team made one school visit a day before the school parents meeting, where possible eligible children were selected at random (at least 30 children per class, extras were chosen in case a parent could not attend the meeting), and told to bring their parents to a school meeting.\nDuring the parents\u2019 meeting, the study was explained in detail before a written informed consent was administered to those interested. If the parent or guardian of a pre-selected child missed a briefing meeting, he/she was followed up at home for briefing and consenting processes. Nonetheless, parents or guardians who had shown interest during the meeting and whose children were in the pre-defined list, were given priority to replace those who were either absent or did not show interest in the study. This was done to attain the required number of children per school, balanced by sex and class year, from whom biological benchmarks (i.e. reduction of parasitaemia and anaemia prevalence) were to be evaluated through routine testing for malaria and haemoglobin levels at four-month (a total of four visits) (Fig.\u00a05). School attendance and\u00a0clinical malaria monitoring During scheduled study visits, all children with symptoms (fever) were screened for malaria, regardless of study arm. If a participant missed school on the day of follow-up visit, the study team would conduct a home visit for the participant. In addition, two CHWs were assigned to each school selected for evaluation of IPTsc effectiveness; these were trained to diagnose and treat uncomplicated malaria using the standard guidelines. During follow up, if an enrolled child was absent, school health teachers were encouraged to contact the CHWs in their respective villages, who would then pay a home visit seeking reasons for the absenteeism. The information would be logged on a special attendance monitoring form (Additional file\u00a0 7: Appendix S7) by school health teachers. Any sick child, together with his/her parent or guardian, was advised to consult the CHW for a preliminary assessment and documentation of the events. In this assessment, the CHW would test for malaria using RDT. If malaria was diagnosed, the CHW would issue treatment according to the national malaria treatment guidelines [14]. All RDT-negative patients and RDTpositive children with severe symptoms were referred to a nearby health facility for further treatment. This was\ndone to not only accelerate diagnosis and treatment of malaria, but also ensure proper recording of all of participant\u2019s malarial episodes. This service was free of charge to participants.\nTo avoid duplicate information, all referred cases were given a special referral form (Additional file\u00a0 8: Appendix S8) that was recognized at the health facility. Given the information on the referral form, the health facility would not repeat rapid testing. Avoidance of redundant testing and diagnosis were especially important because the CHWs were supplied with RDTs and anti-malarial drugs (AL) from the same health facilities to which they referred complicated cases. The CHW would present a list of participants who were tested for malaria every week to a clinical officer in charge. The clinicians would then verify the test results and issue another pack to replace those already used. Health workers at the facilities in the study area were responsible for documenting the cases of malaria that were experienced by sick participants who happen to have attended at respective health facilities. Case record forms (Additional file\u00a09: Appendix S9) with incentives were presented to health workers for this purpose."

Children were classified as underweight/wasted if they were less than two standard deviations (SD) below the reference mean [37].\nMalaria prevalence reduction was calculated as the ratio of difference in prevalence achieved in the intervention arm to that of the control arm expressed in percentage. Longitudinal data analysis was performed\nusing a panel data arising from the effectiveness evaluation. Additionally, methods appropriate for a clusterrandomized trial [40, 41] were also used to determine the effect of the intervention stratifying schools into two groups according to baseline malaria prevalence (i.e. above 10% and below). The prevalence, or mean was calculated and the unadjusted risk ratio, or mean difference (intervention\u2013control), estimated in each stratum as described elsewhere [41]. A weighted average of the stratum-specific estimates was used to estimate an overall effect of IPTsc. In addition, measures for comparison of treatment arms were expressed as prevalence, mean difference and protective effect (PE), which was calculated as PE = 1 \u2212 (rate ratio of malaria parasitaemia, clinical malaria or anaemia) \u00d7 100% as was done elsewhere [41, 42]. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis was used to estimate the time to the first episode of clinical malaria.

            "text": "This study has outlined an approach that can simplify introduction of IPTsc and possibly other various school health programmes in settings similar to Tanzania. It could also be useful for planning integration of various interventions to reduce the implementation cost, especially on drug delivery and supervision. To implement IPTsc, the study team had to understand how other programmes were implemented. It was noted that successful programme introduction has to consider the targeted population platform (meeting point) and schedule that routinely gather the targeted population and the intended outcome for the planned intervention. For example, the Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) was introduced under the platform of routine antenatal care (ANC) among women who were receiving antenatal care on monthly basis and has resulted into successful introduction of IPTp-using sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) aiming at prevention of malaria infection during pregnancy and improving birth outcome. The same for IPT in infants (IPTi-SP, now termed as perennial malaria chemoprevention-[PMC]) has been implemented using the routine immunization programme; it also aimed at prevention of infection. A different approach has been used for the seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) that is largely practiced in West Africa in the Sahel region; was designed to prevent infection in children under-five in a period of high season of malaria infection.\nIn this, the gathering platform for children especially after completing the routine infant vaccination schedule was not available; they therefore made use of CHWs who would administer monthly anti-malarial medication (SPAQ) to children in their communities consecutively for 3\u20134\u00a0months. All these aspects have been successfully implemented [43, 44].\nWhen it comes to school-aged children, the study team had to capitalize the fact that nowadays school enrolment in most African countries has significantly improved [45\u201349] with more than 95% of school-aged children registered in primary schools. Schoolchildren are available in schools throughout the year, and are more likely to be residents of the same area for at least 7\u00a0years (the duration of primary school education in Tanzania) before shifting to other areas for secondary school education. Given the recruitment age starts at 5\u00a0 years it is more likely they graduate by 14\u201315\u00a0years. Thus, from epidemiological point of view and for feasible pragmatic implementation to shrink the malaria reservoir in endemic communities, schools become important platform for delivery of IPTsc. In fact, malaria in schoolchildren highly correlates to malaria infections in pregnant women and under-five children [23, 50], making a plausible hypothesis that IPTsc would likely reduce the burden not only to schoolchildren but also to the communities as was shown elsewhere [51]. In addition, the big advantage of IPTsc compared the others is the service driven approach, (i.e. IPTi and IPTp are dependent on an individual participant to present at a facility, therefore, making coverage lower especially in IPTp [52]), while, IPTsc is organized by the facility staff and supervised by teachers, something you cannot see or arrange for IPTi, or IPTp. Thus, schools may provide a low-cost means to deliver chemoprevention to school-aged children [13].\nThere are other programmes that run through schools: the school MDA has been widely practiced in African schools [11, 12, 53, 54], they are mostly delivered by school teachers who get trained to administer the drugs and collaborate with local health facilities for management of any adverse event [55]. These teachers can be trained to deliver IPTsc as was done in this study. Pragmatically, the frequency at which IPTsc has to be delivered on annual basis needs to be established. The monthly model (like IPTp) will not be realistic, as it will disrupt school curriculum. Therefore, getting to the timing of high malaria transmission season is essential. This will assure administering the drug at the very point needed to clear the parasites and prevent further infection in the specified malaria season. Thus, areas with two seasonal peaks following rainfall trends would likely need three rounds and those with single seasonal peak per year\nwould require two rounds of IPTsc delivery. Such intervals are likely to be pragmatically feasible, as it will allow teachers to proceed with other curriculum activities.\nThis study has laid out a proof of concept for operational ability of IPTsc in most endemic communities. The implementation approach and tools used in this study can be customized to fit the purpose in any community/ country interested on IPTsc. The conduct of IPTsc was successful despite having some operational challenges that were well mitigated to bring a successful operation worthy adopting by any other nation. The first challenge was on school closure due to COVID-19 pandemic, which led the team to postpone the start of clinical and IPTsc administration visits from March to July\u2013August, 2020, a time that was initially planned to be for round 2 of IPTsc. The shift did not affect the study since no clinical evaluation or drug administration had been conducted, so it was just a push on the plan forward. The monitoring following high rain season that normally starts March\u2013 May was then assessed following the third IPTsc round, so there was no strategic interruption on evaluation of IPTsc effectiveness.\nThe other challenge was in reaching out the communities to explain the study. Since the community is huge and some would not attend briefing meetings, meetings were conducted on each school where parents committee inviting village leaders and key opinion leaders to help propel information in every gathering that they may hold internally. In addition, political leaders such as the District Commissioners were well engaged to the operation of IPTsc, they would deliver a massage on every community gathering they encounter in the event they visited interventional wards. Such involvement of community leaders and political leaders played an important role in the conduct of IPTsc. Issues like school food donation from parents/guardians were as well addressed on every meeting as a message encompassing successful IPTsc administration in their respective schools.\nThe delivery of a three days anti-malarial regimen is indeed different from a one-day anthelminthic drug. Normally two teachers have been used to administer MDA against STH and schistosomiasis, the two would administer the drugs to all schoolchildren in a school, taking almost the whole day to finish. In this study, the study team invented the wheel by improving the number of teachers to be used per school. Seven teachers (one per class) was set as a default number, but basing on the fact that there are other schools with more schoolchildren enrolled, the number of teachers could reach to 17 per school for those with more than 1400 schoolchildren\nper school. This was done to enable a teacher to administer IPTsc drugs only for a short duration not disturbing the school curriculum. This made the operation effective since within an hour or two, the whole school would have finished drug administration. Incentive payment was made equally to all teachers involved, and was made once covering all 5\u00a0 days set for drug dispensing (five covering those who would miss in any day). In addition, two CHWs were included in the list; these were helpful on finding or dosing those who missed school on day of administration. A similar arrangement can be made to access school-aged children who are not enrolled at schools, thus addressing equity concerns."

Mitigation to any challenge can be customized based on local circumstances without jeopardising the gains expected from an IPTsc programme. After completing the feasibility assessment, the next step was to estimate cost-effectiveness including hours, in-kind investment of teachers, health staff, drugs procurement etc. in a real world (implementation) situation. The study team subsequently, developed an IPTsc scale up plan and a policy brief for the endorsement of IPTsc strategy in Tanzania.\nAbbreviations ACT Artemisinin\u2011based combination therapy ADR Adverse drug reaction AEs Adverse events AL Artemether\u2011lumefantrine CRF Case record form DBS Dried blood spot DP Dihydroartemisinin\u2011Piperaquine EMA European Medicine Agency GCP Good Clinical Practice GHI Global Health Institute GMP Good Manufacturing Practice Hb Haemoglobin IRB Institutional review board IRS Indoor residual spraying IPTi Intermittent preventive treatment in infants IPTp Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy IPTsc Intermittent preventive treatment in schoolchildren ITNs Insecticide treated nets ITT Intention to treat LLINs Long\u2011lasting insecticide treated nets MDA Mass drug administration MRCC Medical Research Coordinating Committee NSHP National School Health Programme NTD Neglected Tropical Diseases NIMR National Institute for Medical Research, Tanzania NMCP National Malaria Control Programme PCR Polymerase chain reaction\nPQ Piperaquine Pfkelch13 Plasmodium falciparum Kelch\u201113 gene pfcrt Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter Pfmdr1 Plasmodium falciparum Multidrug\u2011resistance gene\u20111 RCT Randomized controlled trial RDT Rapid diagnostic test SAE Serious adverse event SOP Standard operating procedure SP Sulfadoxine\u2011Pyrimethamine STH Soil transmitted helminths TMDA Tanzania Medicines and Medical Devices Authority DSHCo District School Health Coordinator TSHCo Town School Health Coordinator DMO District Medical Officer TMO Town council Medical Officer DNTDCo District NTD Coordinator DPEO District Primary Education Officer TPEO Town council Primary Education Officer.
