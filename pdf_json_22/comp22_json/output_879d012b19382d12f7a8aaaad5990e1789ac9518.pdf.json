    "abstractText": "Longitudinal studies point to the global erosion of trust in institutions and their business processes. As a result, the provision of trusted processes has become a new design criterion that exceeds the traditional Business Process Management (BPM) goals of time, cost, and quality, and also goes beyond security and privacy concerns. The notion of trust, however, has rarely been studied in the context of BPM. This paper initiates the conceptualization of trust in BPM by providing two new artefacts, i.e. a four-stage model for the design of trusted processes and a related meta model. Both have been derived from relevant theories and existing, general trust conceptualizations. Two exploratory case studies and secondary data have facilitated the identification of an initial set of application scenarios and trust requirements.",

            "text": "The recent Edelman Trust Barometer reports show a \u2018world of distrust\u2019 in institutions. The trust index for businesses, government, non-government organizations, and media remains low, with countries such as the USA having seen the highest decline in trust ever recorded in 2018 [1, 2]. Business processes are essential institutional artifacts and, as such, are not only severely exposed to this evaporation of trust, but badly managed processes are also a root cause of the drop in institutional trust [3]. Incidents related to organizations such as Facebook, Samsung, or Volkswagen and the spill-over effects into related industries demonstrate the need to make trust an explicit design concern. In addition to reactively dealing with the trust crisis (so called trust repair), there is also evidence that trust managed well has a positive correlation with economic performance and customer loyalty [4].\nTrust is required when uncertainty exists within a business process. It is the result of a subjective assessment of this uncertainty (belief), and only if sufficient confidence exists will the process be initiated (action) [5]. For example, a customer might require a process to be completed in a certain timeframe for the decision to order. However, there is only a promised, but no certain, delivery date. Depending on the customer\u2019s general propensity to trust [6, 7] and her believe that the process will be completed in the required timeframe, she will take the action and trigger the sales process by placing an order. In order to build the trust required, the organization could: (a) reduce process uncertainties where possible; (b) offer an insurance in case the process will be late;\nand/or (c) provide additional, trust-building information (e.g., \u201c98% of all processes are completed within 2 days\u201d).\nUnfortunately, the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline so far has little to offer when it comes to the conceptualization, design, or execution of trust-aware business processes. Trust as an artifact has not made it into process lifecycle models, BPM meta models, or BPM maturity models. There are three reasons for this. First, BPM has emerged in the age of institutional trust. Organizations, and their processes, were largely trusted and competed on economic criteria. This explains why the time\u2013 cost\u2013quality triangle still dominates the default set of process goals [8]. As a consequence, a process might be of high transactional excellence (i.e., performs well in terms of time, cost, and quality), but the lack of trust in the process prevents it from being adopted. Second, though substantial BPM research has been invested into compliance and, more recently, the trustworthiness of a process, this research only addresses internal, objective criteria. Trust, however, is an external, subjective assessment. It is a perceptual construct and assessed differently in the context of the same process by different stakeholders depending on their individual tolerance for unpredictability (so called uncertainty avoidance). In other words, BPM research has largely assumed rational behavior and focused on evidence (\u201cthe process has a defined Six Sigma score\u201d) - not confidence (\u201cthe customer believes that the process will deliver in time\u201d). Third, the digital economy has empowered and connected citizens and with it provided new forms of decentralized trust in addition to the previous reliance on institutional trust. This can be seen in platforms and marketplaces where social networks have enabled users to connect quickly with members of their trusted network when executing a process. Trust networks allow access to other users or a group of users as an additional source of trust beyond the typical interaction with an institution only. Furthermore, technological solutions such as Blockchain facilitate trusted processes by providing an infrastructure for secure, local transactions within processes [9]. Embedding these new forms of noninstitutional trust into BPM artifacts has rarely been the focus of research so far.\nThe rising importance of trusted processes, new sources of social and digital trust, and the related gap in the body of BPM knowledge motivated this research and its underlying research question, \u201cHow can trust be embedded in the design of business processes?\u201d The aim is to provide an additional trust layer to guide process analysts in the design of trusted business processes.\nIn order to address this research question, relevant trust research and underlying theories (e.g., uncertainty reduction, information asymmetry) were studied and deployed in the context of trusted processes (as opposed to the common focus on trust in organizations or people). The insights gained shaped the methodology proposed here. We derived illustrative processes with trust requirements from two exploratory case studies: a retail bank and a consulate providing services to its nation\u2019s citizens. In addition, secondary data has been used to identify exemplary processes with trust requirements.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the relevant trust-related terminology and reflects on its coverage in the context of BPM. Section 3 presents a four-stage model for the design of trusted processes, before Section 4 consolidates and interrelates these elements in a meta model. Section 5 summarizes the paper and discusses its limitations and possible future research directions."

            "text": "The notion of trust has been comprehensively discussed and researched for decades in a variety of scientific disciplines (e.g., sociology, psychology, economics, game theory). Soellner et al. [10] summarized the status of Information Systems research in the area of trust highlighting the different types of relationships between people, technology and organizations in which trust matters. In comparison, this paper will take a narrow view and not reflect on the diverse connotations of trust in a social context. Instead, it zooms into the requirements of trust in a corporate context, with a new focus on trusted business processes. Other perspectives such as the trust an organization has in its customer (e.g., in the context of a loan application), trust as it relates to the employees involved in a process or trust in the overall purpose or integrity of an organization are out of scope within this paper.\nRachel Botsman [11] defines trust as \u201ca confident relationship with the unknown\u201d. Therefore, trust only becomes relevant if there is uncertainty. Despite ongoing attempts to create fully automated, compliant, reliable processes, there remains a residual uncertainty within nearly all processes. In fact, 100% process certainty will be in most cases economically or technically impossible and, consequently, trust will nearly always be a success factor for process adoption, unless it is a mandated process (e.g., tax declaration). Botsman\u2019s definition allows decomposing trust into the two elements uncertainty and confidence. Uncertainty itself can be further broken down into process uncertainty, i.e. the likelihood that a process does not deliver as promised, and vulnerability, i.e. the uncertainty as it relates to the implications in case a process indeed fails to deliver.\nTrust might be needed because of an information overload (e.g., which book to buy?) or a scarcity of information (e.g., will the company deliver the item in time?). Trust is a social construct; that is, different stakeholders trust the expected performance of a process differently depending on their propensity to trust, their previous experiences with the process and contextual factors [6]. A trust judgment might be made intuitively and spontaneously or could be the result of a conscious analytical reflection. Trust can be personalized (e.g., trusting a process case worker) or generalized (e.g., trust in an organization or a specific business process).\nIn summary, and aligned with McAlister [12], we define trust in a process as the judgment of confident reliance on this process based on positive expectations of its future behavior. A trusted business process gives stakeholders confidence to place their faith into this process in light of an outcome that is uncertain to a degree. Thus, trust consists of a belief (confidence in a future process) and an action (commitment to initiate the process). A business process can be regarded as the trustee, and an external stakeholder who relies on the process is the trustor.\nTrust has a close relationship with quality and risk\u2014two artifacts that are intensively discussed in the context of BPM. First, quality describes the performance of the process itself and its outcome [13]. Related research and a plethora of widely used BPM methodologies (e.g., Lean Six Sigma) have been dedicated to understanding and improving process qualities. Quality and trust have a close relationship when it comes to reliability\nas a popular process quality indicator. Quality and trust are also both \u2018in the eye of the beholder.\u2019 However, while quality management is a mature process-aware discipline with engineering-like methods and tools, trust management is far less advanced. Furthermore, quality is often a promise made by an organization to its customer. Whether the customer believes that the company can fulfill this promise (i.e., whether the customer trusts the process) is out of scope. Finally, a process might be of a known subquality standard. As there is no uncertainty about it, it would have no trust requirements.\nSecond, risk is the probability or, more broadly, the threat of an occurrence with negative implications for a process [14]. Unlike trust, risk can often be quantified and is not prone to subjective assessments (e.g., its frequency may be derived from log files). Many types of risks along a process, however, are either not relevant to an external customer (e.g., the risk to underestimate the cost of a process) or not known to the customer. Trust materializes in the subjective decision to proceed with a process in light of a risk. This includes perceiving risks where they do not exist (e.g., the inability to assess the quality of a proven technology). Not all risk-taking behavior requires trust.\nThe dedicated body of knowledge on trust in the context of BPM is very limited. For example, Greenberg et al. [15] studied the role of trust in the governance of outsourcing business processes. In their research the authors integrate transaction cost economy with types of trust as discussed in the Information Systems literature and differentiate contact, contract, and control as the three main stages of a process deserving a trust investigation. Berner et al. [16] discuss the notion of trusted process information in their investigation of \u2018Process Visibility.\u2019 \u2018Trusted\u2019 as an attribute of process visibility is defined here as the degree to which the business process information is perceived to be valid, reliable and objective and a positive attitude is embraced towards the source."

            "text": "The design of trusted processes requires an understanding of related trust requirements. These are known as trust concerns, which capture those issues potentially preventing customers from engaging with a process. Trust concerns can be elicited either directly in the form of interviews or indirectly be derived by experienced process designers [17]. Mohammadi and Heisel [17] provide a comprehensive set of trust concern identification patterns. However, these are rather generic (e.g., \u201cI am concerned about the correct functionality of the services\u201d) and not tailored to the elements of a business process.\nIn our explorative case study work with two organizations (financial service, consulate) we identified a diverse set of trust concerns including issues such as: - Quality of a process activity: Will the forecasted balance of my account be correct? - Resource expertise: Does the person dealing with my case have the specific exper-\ntise needed? - Resource goal: Can I trust the organization to incentivize their broker so that they\nrecommend the right product to me? - Resource availability: Will I get my appointment at 9.30am, or do I have to\nconsider waiting for a while? - Data: Will you respect the privacy of my data that I provide along the process? - Process success rate: Will my application to re-naturalize be successful?\nAs it can be seen, trust concerns are stated from an end-user perspective. This is different to statements related to risk-aware business processes which are typically made from a process-provider view.\nIn order to consolidate trust concerns, trust profiles can be used to assign users to distinct trust persona [7]. A trust persona is a group of users with comparable trust concerns. For example, following the diffusion of innovation model [18], one could differentiate between the very early adopters (innovators) who have a high level of trust in a new process versus skeptical, late movers who only trust a process after they have seen sufficient evidence of its performance.\nNote that in addition to trust concerns, it is important to also recognize the existence of trust opportunities, i.e. proactively creating customer touchpoints that facilitate the development of trust. Examples for trust opportunities are Amazon reconfirming the desire to order, if a customer orders the same book for the second time or if a telecommunication company proactively downgrades a data plan to appropriately map it to the actual data consumption of its customer [19]. For the purpose of this paper, however, trust opportunities are out of scope."

While trust is in the eye of the customer, organizations have various options to improve the likelihood that their processes will be trusted. They can design trustworthy processes as a response to the articulated trust concerns; that is, processes that deserve to be trusted. Trustworthiness goes beyond security concerns [21] and is discussed in Computer Science as an attribute of technical systems, including characteristics such as privacy, reliability, availability, performance, usability, etc. With regards to the human and organizational capital involved in a process, trustworthiness includes features such as honesty, competence, commitment, benevolence, intentionality, or integrity (for an overview based on a literature review of attributes of trustworthiness see Chong et al. [22]).\nMohammadi and Heisel\u2019s [23] work on integrating trustworthiness requirements in business process models using BPMN is an important contribution of relevance for this research. Starting with identified trust concerns of the end user, specific trustworthiness properties are derived, and detailed recommendations are made for how to model these. However, there is no discussion on how to actually build trust.\n3.0 A Four-Stage Model for the Design of a Trusted Process\nThe BPM discipline has a tradition of developing dedicated perspectives to include emerging requirements and to separate concerns. These optional perspectives are complementing the core scope and methods of established process lifecycle models focused on the control flow and immediate artifacts such as data and resources. This type of research has previously included proposals to support perspectives such as risk-awareness [24], cost-awareness [25], creativity-awareness [26], privacy-awareness [27], or context-awareness [28] of business processes and is summed up in the notion of x-\naware BPM [29]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no BPM-related research that guides academics and professionals regarding the design of trust-aware business processes.\nIn accordance with the way the previously mentioned additional perspectives have extended BPM approaches, this paper adds a trust layer to the body of BPM knowledge consisting of a methodology and a meta model (Section 4) to formalize the integration. The methodology for trust-aware process design comprises four stages. The first stage covers the positioning of trust within the context of business processes whereas the following three stages, inspired by Botsman\u2019s trust definition above, address uncertainty, vulnerability and confidence as the core elements of trust. 1) Identify moments of trust: Identify the steps in a process where external stake-\nholders make a decision that requires trust. 2) Reduce uncertainty: Address operational, behavioral and perceptual issues so that\nthe overall process uncertainty is reduced. 3) Reduce vulnerability: Reduce the vulnerability of the customer in case the process\ndoes indeed not perform as expected. 4) Build confidence: Create a positive bias despite uncertainty and vulnerability."

            "heading": "3.1 Identify Moments of Trust",
            "text": "Trust is needed along a process when the external party is about to make a decision and uncertainty exists. For example, a customer might have proceeded in an online sales process to the point where items have been selected, put in the shopping basket, and a decision in the form of hitting the \u2018order now\u2019 button needs to be made. In this moment, the customer will have to trust that the items can be shipped by the desired delivery date, assuming that a late arrival would make these items unusable. This touchpoint when trust matters is called the moment of trust.\nA conceptualization of moments of trust, therefore, is required to capture the decision point and the uncertainty that the customer is concerned about. Similar to the modeling of risks [24], the latter requires to be selective as there could be a plethora of uncertainties at a moment of trust (e.g., Will my data be protected if I share these? Will the product be of the desired quality? Has the company complied with all standards?). As a moment of trust locates one or many trust concerns within a process, the severity of these concerns can be used as a measure of priority. As trust concerns are assigned to trust persona, the relevance of a moment of trust for different external stakeholders can be assessed. The proposed notion for moments of trust is as follows:\nName (moment of trust) [Object of uncertainty [process| activity|resource|data]: Name (trust concern1), Name (trust concernn)]\nThe following schematic (Figure 1) shows an example from one of our exploratory case studies of how moments of trust, trust concerns, and related trust persona could be embedded in a process. In this case, applicants for re-naturalized citizenship have two process-related trust concerns at the beginning of the process: (1) Applicants are concerned regarding the success rate of the process (Is it worthwhile to put in all the effort and to pay the application fee?) and (2) Will the process be finished in less than a year?\nThis moment of trust is only relevant for applicants who live outside the country, as there is an awareness that this fact has a negative impact on the success rate and increases the processing time. At the next step, all applicants have a shared data-related trust concern with regards to data security. As this is of relevance for all users, no specific trust persona is associated.\nBeyond what has been visualized here, one could envisage that an increased relevance and importance of trust might motivate organizations to assign dedicated trust owners (similar to the notion of risk owners) to specific trust concerns or moments of trust as part of their overall trust governance. A translation to specific notations (e.g., BPMN) has not been defined yet but is straightforward."

            "heading": "3.2 Reduce Process Uncertainty",
            "text": "Trust is only needed when the trustor is uncertain about the performance of the trustee (in this case, the process). If uncertainty is the root cause of a trust concern, reducing this root cause is the most effective way to manage trust. The less uncertainty there is in a process, the higher is the trust in the process.\nProcess uncertainty comes in three forms, (1) operational uncertainty and (2) behavioral uncertainty which both create actual process variation, and (3) perceived uncertainty which is grounded in the lack of process visibility.\nReducing Variation (Operational Uncertainty). BPM has a track record of addressing systemic process uncertainty. Uncertainty in a process can be the result of an uncertain activity (e.g., high variation in processing time for this activity), an uncertain resource (e.g., varying levels of qualification), uncertain data (e.g., securing data privacy), or overall process uncertainty (e.g., processing time).\nAs a common BPM approach, Six Sigma is dedicated to reducing variation; that is, maximizing certainty. The higher the Six Sigma score, the lower the deviation of the outcomes and, as a result, the higher the process certainty. For example, a high Six Sigma score for an airport security process would mean that passengers do not have to rely on a trust-based judgment of the likely processing time, but can expect a predictable throughput time. In the ideal form, uncertainty completely disappears, and a process\nwould show law-like performance. For example, if artificial intelligence (AI)-based interpretations of x-rays reach a level of 100% accuracy for certain types of diagnoses, this process activity converts from an uncertain, human-dependent task to an activity with certainty that equals the predictability of results on a calculator.\nUsing the case above (Figure 1), the process-related trust concern regarding the processing time could be addressed by scalable resources. For example, accounting firms providing tax advice tend to scale up their workforce using liquid workforces to ensure they can deliver on their promise (e.g., a 24-hour turn-around time).\nReducing Variation (Behavioral Uncertainty). Systems, processes, and business rules often provide freedom for staff in terms of how to perform their allocated tasks in detail. In these cases, staff are not guided by procedural rules but by standards reflecting the organizational commitment to integrity, sincerity, and honesty. Behavioral uncertainty occurs when the customer is unsure if staff will act according to these higher-order standards. For example, a mortgage broker might be more motivated by the commission than the customer value associated with a financial product. This cause of process variation can be addressed in two ways. First, a clear articulation of values and related cultural change management can lead to a higher commitment to relevant ethical standards. Second, behavioral uncertainty can be eliminated via automation with the assumption that the related systemic uncertainty is easier to control (e.g., roboadvice in the context of a lending process).\nIncreasing Visibility (Perceived Uncertainty). In addition to actual certainty, perceived uncertainty can compromise the trust position of a business process. In this case, a customer does not trust a process, not because the process is in fact uncertain but because the customer believes that the process is uncertain. Perceived uncertainty is grounded in information asymmetry [30] and best addressed by increasing the visibility of a process to overcome this asymmetry. For example, Volkswagen\u2019s glass factory makes the final stages of the manufacturing process visible to the future car owner, and open kitchens in restaurants make the cooking process visible to diners. These concepts increase the line of visibility along a process and eliminate perceived uncertainty as a factor for insufficient trust. Similarly, the ability to track delivery processes (open process monitoring), as practiced by many logistics or food delivery companies nowadays, increases the customer\u2019s knowledge of the actual arrival time and, as such, reduces uncertainty over time.\nIn addition to making the actual process status and its progress visible to the customer, tools such as predictive process monitoring and process forecasting can be used to increase the visibility; that is, reduce the uncertainty of future process events. For example, Uber publishes the average estimated time of arrival of its drivers as a real-time data feed at various airports."

            "heading": "3.3 Reduce Vulnerability",
            "text": "Not all forms of uncertainty within a business process can be eliminated. This could be due to technical reasons (e.g., a robotic vision algorithm has only a certain quality to detect items), the impossibility of anticipating all exceptions, reliance on human judgement, external factors (e.g., weather, traffic, suppliers), or other reasons. In this third\nstep of trust-aware process design the focus is on reducing the vulnerability; that is, the negative implication in case the process does not deliver as promised (e.g., a delivery is late). Vulnerability can be seen as the potential cost to a trustor in case the trustee does not perform as expected. The higher this cost, the more trust is required to proceed. In order to mitigate these costs, different types of vulnerability and corresponding compensations need to be differentiated. Three examples covering time, product, and price vulnerability are provided in the following to clarify this: 1) The costs of a process being late. For example, in 2018 the German Bundesbahn\nprocessed 2.7 million claims processes by travelers seeking reimbursements for their late trains. Such an arrangement requires an additional process capability. 2) The outcome of a process might not satisfy the customer\u2019s expectations. For example, many online retailers offer a free-of-charge return (e.g., Adidas\u2019 change-ofmind returns policy). This requires process-rollback capabilities. 3) The value-for-money equation is dissatisfactory. For example, a consulting company could re-configure its pricing algorithm in its invoicing process so that the fee is based on the value provided as opposed to being time-based. This form of vulnerability management requires a modification of a task within a process."

            "text": "Unfortunately, the bulk of BPM research stops at the design of trustworthy processes (e.g., Mohammadi and Heisel [17]). The conversion of a trustworthy process into a trusted process and the exploration of additional sources of trust, however, has been so far largely out of scope. Trustworthy processes become trusted processes if the customer has confidence that the process will deliver as promised. Das and Teng [31] also show that trust complements control as a confidence builder. The relationship between confidence and trust, and how the latter goes beyond the former, is comprehensively discussed by Mayer et al. [6, p. 713].\nReducing process uncertainty and vulnerability already has an indirect positive effect on confidence. However, there are also ways to directly increase customer confidence in a business process. The fourth and final stage of process-aware trust management therefore deals with mechanisms helping with the emergence of confidence.\nOnce the moments of trust and related trust concerns have been identified, it needs to be explored how a stakeholder\u2019s confidence in the relationship with the identified uncertainty and vulnerability can be increased. For this, it is proposed to identify alternative sources of trust. A source of trust provides confidence-building information on which a decision can be made. Depending on the characteristics of the process and the profile of the trust persona\u2014that is, individual preferences and attitudes\u2014certain sources of trust might be more important than others. In the following, six alternative sources of trust will be discussed. For each of these, it will be briefly shown how to use process-aware information systems for these sources of trust.\nDemocratic Trust: Trust the Majority. A quantitative source of trust is the articulation of confidence-boosting information covering the behavior or experiences of the majority of users at the moment of trust within a process. For example, in our explorative cases we found that some citizens proactively ask questions such as \u2018how many\napplications have been successful?\u2019 when considering whether to lodge specialized applications such as a request to re-naturalize as a citizen. The provision of such a figure, if high enough, could act as a confidence-boosting piece of information. A similar example of a trust-building piece of information would be a metric stating the (high) number of customers (in percentage) who have not returned products after purchasing a specific product (unseen) online. A variant of democratic trust would be the upfront provision of aggregated process information. For example, Uber uses the average arrival times of their drivers (e.g., 4 mins) as a trust-building mechanism for the service latency1 of their personal mobility process. Thus, democratic trust means trust in numbers and is nurtured via a reference to the positive experiences of the majority of process customers. Democratic trust is popular in platforms using rating systems.\nA process-aware information system (PAIS) could embed such sources of trust by consolidating and publishing previous process data (assuming they have confidencebuilding values). Similar to the idea that data usage is seen as a proxy for data quality, process usage could be seen as an indicator for process quality. This is similar to solutions that are used as part of product recommendation services (e.g., Amazon store).\nMore advanced systems would be able to consider the trust persona and offer only persona-specific information. For example, process success rates would be offered depending on the applicant\u2019s demographic class.\nDemocratic trust is of relevance in processes with limited decision complexity (limited number of alternatives) and with a high volume of users (so adequate majority scores can be sourced).\nLocal Trust: Trust in My Personal Network. A user might not trust the process or published frequencies (democratic trust, i.e., wisdom of the crowds). However, there might be trusted people whose (positive) experiences with the process could be confidence-building (i.e., wisdom of friends). This requires finding a way to transfer the trust into these contacts towards trust in the process.\nTrust networks capture relationships with trusted people. An existing trusted relationship can be activated as a source of trust in the context of a business process. A trust network can either be explicit\u2014that is, a user expresses in a trust statement (e.g., as a score between 0-1) the extent to which they trust another user \u2014or it can be implicit\u2014that is, trust is inferred from a relationship between two people. Examples of the latter are connections in social networks such as Facebook or LinkedIn. The assumption is that the mutual willingness to create a connection is grounded in mutual trust. If the user can be motivated to share their trust network at the moment of trust in a process, trusted users can be identified. For example, Airbnb Social Connections allow connecting Airbnb with Facebook during the booking process to see if someone from the potential guest\u2019s personal network is a personal friend of the host or has reviewed the host. Such a connection could be seen as trust-building for the person using the Airbnb booking process and reduces uncertainties regarding an essential resource in this process; that is, the host.\n1 The service latency of a process is the time between the triggering event and the first action\nof the process.\nA concern with this source of trust is that the trust network might reflect a filter bubble; that is, like-minded sources of trust and not objective sources are activated. Unlike democratic trust, this source of trust requires: (1) involvement of the user who has to be incentivized to share their trust network, (2) a track record of members of this trust network who have previously engaged with the process, and (3) the ability to identify these users. The quality of local trust depends on the size and accessibility of the trust network. Thus, local trust is more relevant for community processes (e.g., retail, entertainment, or personal services such as UrbanSitter) with limited privacy concerns as opposed to specialized processes (e.g., health care).\nGlobal Trust: Trust in Respected Users. In more advanced decision-making processes that go beyond simple yes or no decisions, majority statements (of a general population or sourced from a local trust network) might not be sufficient. Instead, what is needed is the confidence that can only be derived from a person with a high commonly accepted reputational value (e.g., intensive user of a specific process). This can be found, for example, in Amazon\u2019s book recommendations, Wikipedia\u2019s selection of editors, or LinkedIn endorsements.\nThis source of trust requires access to process users with a high reputational standing. The user could either leave a track of \u2018endorsed processes\u2019 or could be proactively contacted as a source of trust. An example for the former would be the training processes of amateur athletes who follow the training processes of recognized athletes. An example of the latter is the case when during the process of hiring a graduate the recruiting company contacts the academic experts who taught the relevant candidate.\nAs can be seen, global trust matters for processes when higher levels of expertise are needed to select a process variant (or a resource within a process). In these cases, the reputational standing and the specific expertise matter more than the personal connection (local trust) or the view of the majority of process users (democratic trust).\nSpecific Trust: Trust in People Like Me. In some cases, trust can only be derived from users who share a number of essential attributes with the user who is about to engage with a process. For example, the platform Patientslikeme.com is a network of more than 600,000 users that allows people with health issues to identify other patients with similar demographics and symptoms who have successfully overcome the identified health problem. A study of the behavior of a specific class of patients (e.g., 90% of them took a certain medication) can be a relevant source of trust for users when deciding about their very own therapy process. In these processes, confidence needs to be built within an individual user who could not derive trust from their trust network (as no member of this network has experience or familiarity with this medical issue). \u2018People like me\u2019 is a trust-building mechanism that, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, ranks third highest in terms of credibility [2].\nIn such a scenario, the decision-maker derives the trust required from an endorsement or the process behavior of a person with shared health circumstances or attributes. This type of reasoning underlies predictive process monitoring solutions that identify similar tokens from the process log file. In the context of trust management, this would require: (1) identifying similar tokens, and (2) recommendeding process paths based on the positivity of the outcome. For example, what therapeutical process did those\npatients (like me) choose that led to the desired outcome; that is, they overcame the medical issue?\nA PAIS will only be able to provide such data if rich insights about the process users do exist. Certain attributes might be derived based on the way the process is executed. Similar to democratic trust, the provider of the process becomes a broker to a new trusted source as opposed to local trust in the form of a trust network where the user has to bring trusted connections to the process.\nThese previous four forms of trust (democratic, local, global, specific) can be classified as social trust; that is, they derive trust via some form of social interaction. The next two forms of trust are based on forms of organizational trust and grounded in the process provider.\nInstitutional Trust: Trust in the Organization. This is the traditional source of trust. However, as indicated at the start of this paper, it is also the source of trust most in danger, as institutional trust has been on the decline [1]. Institutional trust in the context of BPM means that there is a flow-on effect of the (dis)trust into the institution to the (dis)trust in a business process provided by this organization.\nBuilding institutional trust is largely grounded in building trustworthy processes by ways of demonstrating compliance, commitment to security and privacy, sufficiently qualified and appropriately incentivized employees, etc. Trust-building beyond these \u2018hard\u2019 process facts could be finding ways of how the trust in the organization spills over to trust in the process. Well-known for this is the capability maturity model. Here an increased organizational maturity score is a proxy for process reliance.\nThe inclusion of institutional trust in a PAIS could come in the form of proactive statements that highlight the credibility of the various components of the organization (e.g., highlight maturity levels, qualifications of resources involved, ethical standards, etc.). Institutional trust may be the only form of trust for entire new processes in which no historical process data or data for social trust is available yet. Processes that become trusted because of institutional forms of trust are processes that benefit from the additional assurance that the organization can provide assets to the process, especially as a way to mitigate vulnerability (e.g., lending process in a retail bank).\nRobotic Trust: Trust in Machines. The sixth and last confidence-building element in a business process is related to reliable technology as a source of trust. Robotic trust becomes relevant when the technology used within the business process has developed a level of maturity that it is commonly trusted. Examples are the use of calculators in invoicing processes or navigation systems in delivery processes. Recent digital technologies (e.g., AI, Blockchain) take robotic trust to new levels and have enabled, for example, decentralized processes such as Powerledger\u2019s peer-to-peer energy trading process. It could be easily envisaged that very soon patients will trust an AI algorithm more than the viewpoint of a radiologist within a healthcare process.\nTechnologies such as robotic process automation are contributing to an increased reliability of a process and thus can be seen as a new form of robotic trust. In such processes, the customer derives the confidence required from the technology used more than from the trust in the corporation providing the process."

            "text": "In order to formalize the notion of trust-aware process design, a meta model summarizing and interrelating the constructs presented above is provided.\nTrust only matters when a process has uncertainties; that is, the user of the process cannot be sure that the process behaves as promised. Uncertainties in a process can be rooted in activities, resources, or data, matter at a moment of trust, and lead to trust concerns. The difference in the assessment of process uncertainties by different users is captured in a taxonomy of trust persona based on their trust profiles.\nOrganizations have three ways to address these trust concerns: reduce uncertainties, reduce vulnerability, and increase confidence. First, they need to address process uncertainties which manifest in three alternative forms: (1) they can reduce actual systemic uncertainties by addressing and ultimately reducing operational process variations (e.g., via Six Sigma); (2) organizations can address actual behavioral uncertainties by ensuring that the staff involved in the process are performing their tasks according to values such as confidentiality, integrity,\navailability, security, privacy, performance, and others; and (3) organizations need to address perceived uncertainties by making the process more visible as a way to overcome this type of uncertainty.\nSecond, organizations can mitigate uncertainties grounded in the vulnerability of an eventually non-performing process. This requires revising processes in a way that the costs of a process not performing to a customer\u2019s expectations are mitigated. Here we differentiate mitigating vulnerability as it relates to the process time, the process outcome, or the process cost. Both uncertainty management and vulnerability management lead to a trustworthy process.\nThird, organizations can provide sources of trust in order to further boost the user\u2019s confidence in the process. Depending on the process characteristics, the related decisions to be made, and the trust persona, these sources will be of different relevance. As such, we distinguish between democratic trust, local trust, global trust, specific trust, institutional trust, and robotic trust as sources of trust.\nThe extent to which a trust persona ends up trusting a process is a result of how well the three elements of trust management address the identified trust concerns. The summarizing meta model, showing the three clusters of user, uncertainty, and trust management, is presented in Figure 2."

At the same time, new forms of social and digital trust (e.g., Blockchain) are emerging and provide new opportunities to increase an organization\u2019s trust position. The BPM discipline, however, has not made trust a dedicated concern within its widely used artifacts, such as process lifecycle models, maturity models, or meta models. Motivated by this demand for and the absence of knowledge in this field, this paper summarized the related body of knowledge before proposing a four-stage model of trust-aware process design. Related literature incl. underlying theories of relevance has been presented, the core trust concepts have been introduced, and ways to identify moments of trust, to reduce process uncertainty and vulnerability and to increase confidence in the process have been discussed. A consolidating meta model formally interrelates these concepts and connects the presented trust constructs as an additional layer of concern to the essential notion of a process. Real-life examples derived from two exploratory cases studies and secondary date have shown the relevance and potential applicability of this model. This paper is conceptual in nature and, as a result, has to come with a set of limitations. First, further trust theories in disciplines such as sociology or economics could have been identified and improved the theoretical foundation of the trust constructs presented here. Second, a more thorough empirical investigation in the tradition of Action Design Research could have led to an iterative, empirically grounded development of the model. Third, and finally, the meta model presented is only a first step\ntowards a more formalized articulation of trust-aware process design (including proposals for trust notations in the context of business process modelling). As a first contribution to the domain of trust-aware process design, this paper could not cover a number of related topics that need to be addressed in future research to arrive at a more complete understanding and conceptualization of trust-aware processes. This includes, among others, rigorously interrelating trust with the known stages of the process lifecycle, addressing issues with regards to the actual measurement of trust and identifying relevant capabilities and including these in BPM maturity models. Substantial empirical work is required to assess the validity, reliability and overall relevance of the proposed model. Future empirical work could also lead to an initial set of trust profiles and typical trust concerns as well as ultimately lead to trust patterns; that is, process building blocks for the design of trust-aware business processes. Each proposed source of trust could attract further work, in particular in terms of its impact on users\u2019 trust, their implementation in PAIS and their alignment with process profiles; that is, what type of process requires what source(s) of trust? Researchers with a passion for BPM governance might reflect on the potential roles of trust designers and trust owners or how trust can be embedded in enterprise architectures."
