    "abstractText": "The increasing demand for high pixel acquisition rates in the fields of augmented reality, autonomous driving, and robotics has led to a growing interest in solid-state beam scanning solutions that do not rely on moving parts. As a result, modern photonics has been driving the development of passive beam steering technology to meet these demands. Recently demonstrated imagers based on focal plane arrays, nanophotonic metasurfaces, and optical phased arrays have enabled unprecedented pixel resolutions and measurement speeds. However, the parallelization of >100 lasers and detectors, which has been successfully implemented in commercial time-of-flight sensors, has not been widely adopted for passive scanning approaches. In this work, we demonstrate both inertia-free and parallel light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with microresonator frequency combs. We use 40 independent channels of a continuously scanned microresonator frequency comb operated in the chaotic regime in combination with optical dispersive elements to perform random modulation LiDAR with 2D passive beam steering. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

            "text": "Laser beam steering is one of the key challenges in the LiDAR field. The ongoing search for passive scanning solutions ranges from focal plane grating arrays1,2 and switching networks3 to optical phased arrays4 and nanophotonic metasurfaces.5 Yet, conventional optical dispersive elements, such as gratings and prisms, offer mature and simple solutions for wavelength based beam steering. A combination of a virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) and a diffraction grating\u2014also referred to as a 2D disperser\u2014was demonstrated for 2D passive beam steering6,7 and frequency mapping into a 2D array in the image plane of the spectrometer for molecular fingerprinting.8 The VIPA is a tilted etalon9 that manifests angular dispersion by over an order of magnitude more than conventional diffraction gratings.10 The subsequent mounting of a VIPA and a grating allows for vertical and horizontal passive scanning if the source frequency bandwidth is much larger than the free spectral range (FSR) of the VIPA etalon. Recently, Li et al.11 have demonstrated VIPA-based inertia-free\nfrequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) LiDAR with a broadband swept source.\nChip-scale optical microcombs can achieve 100 s of nm of optical bandwidth and are suitable for massively parallel laser ranging using either FMCW12\u201314 or random modulation continuous wave (RMCW)15 techniques. Such a degree of parallelization enabled six megapixel per second line rates for FMCW microcomb LiDAR with one-dimensional passive scanning.16 Yet, a demonstration of true passive 2D beam steering with optical microcombs has not been explored.\nHere, we report on parallel and inertia-free microcomb based LiDAR. We employ the recently demonstrated chaotic random modulation LiDAR approach,15 where the photonic chip based microresonator is operated in the chaotic modulation instability (MI) regime17 to offer broadband noise, flat-top spectra, and high conversion efficiency. Based on the manifold of microcomb light and an optical disperser, we demonstrate passive and parallel 2D beam steering of a random modulation LiDAR system.\nAPL Photon. 8, 056102 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0141384 8, 056102-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n18 January 2024 23:12:50\nRESULTS AND METHODS Concept of chaotic inertia-free LiDAR\nThe principle of inertia-free LiDAR with chaotic microcombs is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The photonic chip based integrated Si3N4 microring resonator18 driven by a continuous-wave (CW) laser generates a chaotic modulation instability frequency comb,19 where each comb line acts as an independent random LiDAR source.15,20 Two photoreceivers per each optical channel detect the randomlike varying light intensity, and the cross correlation between the reflected signal and the reference results in the time delay estimate or range of a given pixel. A commercial wavelength demultiplexer unit enables individual comb line access and detection in parallel.\nWe emphasize that our implementation employs an optical chaotic state of light that naturally occurs in Kerr microcombs.17,21 This state is distinct from the widely employed coherent comb states, such as dissipative Kerr solitons22 or dark pulses.23,24 The chaotic state exists on the blue-detuned side of the resonance and can be easily accessed via laser tuning. It possesses amplitude and frequency noise, whose effective bandwidth can be significantly larger (>10\u00d7) than the resonance linewidth, enabling its application in random noise cross correlation-based LiDAR, as shown in Ref. 15.\nTwo optical diffraction elements, VIPA and grating, realize the 2D inertia-free scanning. A description of the optical configuration of VIPA and grating can be found in Ref. 25. While the 100 GHz microcomb free spectral range (FSR) allows for beam diffraction by the grating in horizontal dimension, the VIPA with\nAPL Photon. 8, 056102 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0141384 8, 056102-2\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n30 GHz FSR is responsible for vertical scanning. Thus, the 2D disperser subsequently maps every frequency to a point in space. To leverage the angular dispersion of the VIPA, the microcomb needs to be scanned for 30 GHz. The scanning is effectively achieved by sweeping the comb offset frequency while maintaining a constant FSR. Simultaneous driving of the laser piezo-controller and the microresonator heater achieves the required frequency excursion (similar to broadband soliton scanning26) keeping the frequency detuning \u0394 between the pump and the cavity resonance locked [cf. Fig. 1(b)].\nWe pump the chaotic microcomb with 900 mW of CW light at 1550 nm and achieve a 20% nonlinear conversion efficiency on-chip featuring up to \u221210 dBm comb line power and a flattop spectrum (compared with a typical \u201csech\u201d profile of dissipative Kerr solitons15). We have 100 comb lines with the mean power of \u221211.5 dBm and a standard deviation of 2 dB in the spectral region covering 188\u2013198 THz. Each comb line has a characteristic GHzlevel amplitude noise bandwidth, compared with 50 MHz resonance linewidth, resulting in an \u223c15 cm axial depth resolution and unambiguous ranging (due to the random-like waveform). The MI comb is generated blue-detuned from the optical resonance, i.e., it is thermally stable,27 and it follows a simple (compared with DKS) initiation routine. The blue shaded region in Fig. 1(d) highlights the 40 comb channels [192\u2013196 THz or International Telecommunication Union (ITU) channels 20\u201360] utilized in the ranging experiments except for the filtered pump at 193 THz (ITU 30).\nThe novel LiDAR scheme relies on simple direct detection with cross correlation range inference, without the need for high frequency electro-optics or precise control over the optical waveform. In our implementation, the microcomb scanning rate (shown up to 100 Hz) determines the overall frame rate of the proposed LiDAR since the field of view is covered twice during one scan."

            "text": "Figure 2(a) illustrates the MI microcomb scanning principle. We scanned both the pump laser and the optical microresonator to achieve a broadband frequency excursion covering the VIPA FSR of 30 GHz. The arbitrary function generator (AFG) drove the CW laser piezo-controller with a triangular waveform and aluminum heater of the microresonator with a square root-like waveform. The optical resonance shift is proportional to the temperature change\n(in the leading order) corresponding to the power dissipation or applied voltage squared. The broadband scanning of the microcomb also requires constant laser-resonance detuning \u0394 to maintain the MI state with uniform comb line power. We previously showed15 that the MI operated in the pre-soliton switching regime carries the most intracavity power, resulting in the highest power per comb line, and an effective noise bandwidth, resulting in a better ranging resolution and accuracy. To minimize the detuning \u0394 variation, we locked the pump to the slope of the resonance (side of fringe locking) via proportional\u2013integral (PI) feedback control. We optimize the square root driving waveform of the integrated microheater by iterative predistortion to achieve linear (in the leading order) frequency chirping [cf. Fig. 2(b)] and uniform MI comb power emission.\nFigure 2(d) depicts the heterodyne beat spectrograms of the \u03bc = 2\u20134 comb lines (\u03bc stands for the comb line number relative to the pump) recorded by superimposing the comb lines with an external cavity diode laser. We detected the beat note with a 43 GHz balanced photodiode and digitized the photocurrent with a highspeed oscilloscope (80 Gs/s) in segmented acquisition mode at a 50 Hz comb scanning rate and 10 \u03bcs segment length (overall, 200 segments over two periods). The depicted spectrogram shows the Fourier transforms of the individual segments. The drift of the local oscillator during the measurement is less than 1 MHz. The evolution of the MI comb line spectra for the channel \u03bc = 2 is depicted in Fig. 2(e). We observe a constant power and bandwidth of the chaotic beat note. Figure 2(f) depicts the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the auto-correlation traces derived from the scanned MI comb channel \u03bc = 2. The 14 cm level determines resolution of the comb line at each step and confirms the locked detuning \u0394 (the reduced widths around 0.01 and 0.03 s correspond to the heterodyne spectrum folding around DC level).\nIn Fig. 2(g), we show the chaotic microcomb tuning at different tuning rates on the example of channel \u03bc = 13. The fastest tuning rate that we could achieve is 100 Hz, and it was limited by the response of the pump laser piezo-controller. The aluminum heaters were reported to have response at kHz frequencies level,29 which could further increase the frame rate of the novel passive LiDAR.\nChaotic microcomb inertia-free ranging\nFor the ranging experiments, we employed a monostatic configuration with one collimator serving as both transmitter and receiver. An optical circulator was used to separate the transmitted and received waveforms. The collimator aperture was 4 mm. We also used a focusing lens after the VIPA and before the diffraction grating. This slightly decreased the vertical scanning angle (due to the focusing of the vertically diverging beam) but improved the focusing of the beam on the target, thereby reducing the speckle upon reception. The comb was amplified up to 500 mW (total power of all of the comb lines) prior to the collimator. Since we used fibercoupled photoreceivers, the returned light was projected into a fiber mode, resulting in an intensity loss due to speckle. To overcome the digitizer noise level (\u223c5 mV) at the detection stage, we used a retroreflector and pre-amplifier.\nFigure 3(a) presents a point cloud of 39\u00d720 pixels acquired during 0.01 s\u2014full vertical swing or half of the scanning period (50 Hz).\nAPL Photon. 8, 056102 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0141384 8, 056102-3\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n18 January 2024 23:12:50\nFIG. 2.

(g) Heterodyne spectrograms for 25, 50, and 100 Hz scan rates (\u03bc = 13). RBW = 14.6 MHz.\nWe sequentially detected 39 comb channels (ITU 20\u201360, excluding the filtered pump channel), while the detection can be performed in parallel requiring a number of photodetectors and digitizers equal to twice the number of channels (signal and reference for each channel). Every channel recording consisted of 40 segments (20 \u03bcs each) corresponding to two vertical scans [up-swing and down-swing, cf. Fig. 3(c); recorded in the segmented acquisition mode of the oscilloscope similar to heterodyne analysis, Fig. 2(d)]. The demonstrated pixel measurement rate was limited by the available oscilloscope memory and the tuning rate of the external cavity diode laser. We used 1.5 GHz photoreceivers to record the chaotic intensity profiles and digitally computed cross correlations for delay estimation. The cross correlation trace comprises the target distance information and also the back-reflection from the collimator and circulator [cf. Fig. 3(d)]. The dispersed comb illuminated carton blocks\ncovered by retroreflecting tape at 2\u20133.6 m range away from the collimator. We achieve an \u223c14 cm depth resolution as analyzed from the cross correlation FWHM [cf. Figs. 2(f) and 3(f)]. This is a direct consequence of a chaotic MI nature, where every comb line possesses >1 GHz effective noise bandwidth without the need for external modulation or control. Furthermore, the chaotic LiDAR is capable of unambiguous range detection30 and has superior immunity to ambient light interference.31\nThe 2D disperser scanning as depicted in Fig. 1(a) corresponds to the case when the comb FSR equals to the VIPA FSR times an integer number. In our case, the VIPA and microcomb had 30 and 100 GHz FSR, respectively, and every third comb line was illuminated with a similar vertical angle since the accumulated frequency separation of three FSRs was ten times the VIPA FSR (3\u00d7100 = 10\u00d730 GHz), while every subsequent comb line had a ver-\nAPL Photon. 8, 056102 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0141384 8, 056102-4\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n18 January 2024 23:12:50\nFIG. 3.

Precise knowledge of the comb FSR and approximate VIPA FSR allowed us to calculate the relative vertical illumination angle shift for every comb line. The point cloud z axis has an arbitrary unit height value since we did not calibrate the absolute vertical angle corresponding to every segment of the linear sweep, although it is assumed to be linear in the leading order.10 We used a high-density reflective diffraction grating with 1200 lines/mm to diffract the light in the horizontal direction.\nFigure 3(e) depicts a point cloud pixels histogram. The distance precision is on the order of the Fourier-limited range resolution (\u223c14 cm) due to the multiple beam round-trips in the VIPA etalon, i.e., multiple reflections with different accumulated delays [cf. Fig. 3(b)] that can reach >10 cm with a VIPA thickness of 3 mm and finesse \u2131 of 100. In our experiments, these multiple reflections in the VIPA ultimately determined the ranging error \u224810 cm. Another potential drawback may come from the effective frequency noise bandwidth being comparable to the VIPA linewidth, i.e., ratio\nAPL Photon. 8, 056102 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0141384 8, 056102-5\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n18 January 2024 23:12:50\nof VIPA FSR to its finesse \u2131, which results in an extra angular divergence of a particular chaotic comb line, even when the comb is not scanned."

            "text": "We demonstrated chaotic microcomb based parallel inertiafree laser ranging. The proposed implementation requires minimum active components on the light transmitter side. A photonic integrated Si3N4 microresonator acts as a source of 40 and potentially >100 noisy comb channels for random LiDAR that are dispersed in 2D and can be detected in parallel. The possibility of the broadband comb frequency offset sweep and constant FSR enable such 2D scanning. In principle, a broadband source, such as amplified spontaneous emission, could be continuously filtered and used for scanning as well.\nWe showed that integrated aluminum micro-heaters enable agile frequency scanning of chaotic MI with 30 GHz excursion at 100 Hz rates (both limited by the laser piezo-response), while Si3N4 microresonators were reported to achieve \u223c200 GHz excursion and up to kHz scanning rates.26,29 The higher excursion allows for a VIPA with a larger FSR and, subsequently, a larger angular dispersion, while higher scan rates translate into faster acquisition frame rates. The recently reported integration of aluminum nitride and lead zirconate titanate with Si3N4 photonic circuits32 could provide tuning with a flat response and higher actuation bandwidth but would require a much higher voltage than aluminum heaters to cover a several gigahertz range. We note that a heterogeneous integration of the Si3N4 frequency comb with a InP/Si semiconductor laser33 has been demonstrated along with hybrid integrated solutions34,35 and on-chip optical amplifiers,36 paving the way for fully integrated LiDAR transmitters.\nThe combination of a VIPA and grating represents a simple yet mature 2D inertia-free scanning solution. It could provide a 1.9\u25cb \u00d7 7.7\u25cb field of view,11 while the grating field of view could be easily extended by employing more comb lines or frequency combs with a higher FSR. The VIPA tilt angle should be carefully chosen as it trades off single order operation vs angular dispersion and tuning curvature.10 Ultimately, any combination of passive optical dispersers can be considered. Non-etalon-based optical dispersers would eliminate the drawback of the multiple reflections and improve the ranging precision.\nThe sampling rate performance of the current scheme depends on the comb scanning period, pixel acquisition time, and VIPA finesse. The total number of acquired pixels for one comb channel during one vertical scan should be less than the VIPA finesse N < \u2131. However, the total acquisition time should also be less than the scanning period N \u00d7 \u0394t < T/2. For a tuning rate of 100 Hz and a VIPA finesse \u2131 = 100, the achievable sampling rate per comb channel is 20 kS/s at 50 \u03bcs pixel acquisition time. Megapixel sampling rates are feasible when more than 50 comb lines were employed, or when 50\u00d7100 pixels at 200 frames per second rates are used.\nPassive scanning is currently adopted as a commercial solution for true solid state LiDAR. Several LiDAR companies combine a 1D spectral scan approach based on optical dispersers with mechanical scanning for the second dimension.37,38 In addition, parallel illumination and acquisition\u2014widely employed in time-offlight LiDAR\u2014may solve the long-standing challenge of detecting\nmegapixel rates required for real-time applications in robotics, unmanned driving, and augmented reality. Finally, we have demonstrated parallel and inertia-free beam steering LiDAR based on chaotic microcombs."
