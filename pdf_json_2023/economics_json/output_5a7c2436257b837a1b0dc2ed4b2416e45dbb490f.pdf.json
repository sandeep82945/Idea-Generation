To achieve this, the recommendation process must carefully consider the region's\nnatural, environmental, resource, and economic characteristics. However, current recommendation\nalgorithms in the field of computer science fall short in adequately addressing the spatial\nheterogeneity related to environment and sparsity of regional historical interaction data, which limits\ntheir effectiveness in recommending sustainable development patterns. To overcome these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a method called User Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG).\nFirstly, we utilize the high-density linking capability of the pruned User Graph to address the issue\nof spatial heterogeneity neglect in recommendation algorithms. Secondly, we construct an Intent\nGraph by incorporating the intent network, which captures the preferences for attributes including\nenvironmental elements of target regions. This approach effectively alleviates the problem of sparse\nhistorical interaction data in the region. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nUGPIG outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms like KGCN, KGAT, and KGIN in\nsustainable development pattern recommendations, with a maximum improvement of 9.61% in Top-\n3 recommendation performance.\nKeywords: Sustainable development pathways; Ecological civilization pattern; Recommender system;\nKnowledge graph pruning; Intent Graph; UGPIG;"

            "text": "The sustainable development pattern, also referred to as the ecological civilization\npattern in China, represents a strategic approach towards attaining the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which entails meeting the needs of the present generation while safeguarding the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The primary objective is to enhance the quality of human life while ensuring that it remains within the carrying capacity of the supporting ecosystem. The recommendation of sustainable development patterns involves a customized process that considers the specific conditions of the target region, including natural factors, economic levels, and cultural development (Abisheva et al., 2018; S. Wang et al., 2021). By doing so, it aims to identify and select appropriate sustainable development patterns that are well-suited for the target region. The implementation of a suitable sustainable development pattern can enhance resource utilization, strengthen the protection of cultural resources, and foster the harmonious development of the economy, society, and ecological preservation within the target region. Therefore, the recommendation of suitable sustainable development patterns serves as a pivotal approach towards achieving SDGs (Bennich et al., 2020; Nhamo et al., 2019).\nThe task of recommending sustainable development patterns shares similarities\nwith recommendation systems in computer science. Both aim to leverage the historical behavior between users (target regions) and items (sustainable development patterns) to establish connections, uncover latent interests, predict preferences, and select the most suitable items for specific users (Mohamed et al., 2019; Tarus & Niu, 2017).\nRecommendation systems have demonstrated effectiveness in various domains such as e-commerce (J. Wang et al., 2018) , music (Hu et al., 2018) , and movies (Han et al., 2021). However, their performance in the geographic domain is limited due to the unique characteristics of geography, including temporal, spatial, and specific land attributes (Wang et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2022). Consequently, traditional recommendation models for goods, movies, and music are not directly applicable to recommending sustainable development patterns. Currently, sustainable development pattern recommendations heavily rely on experts and manual processes. However, as the consideration of geographic environmental factors and the long-term nature of ecological civilization recommendations increase, manual recommendations become increasingly challenging. There is a growing need for scientific, accurate, and automated approaches to recommend sustainable development patterns. This has become an important research topic, as the development of reliable and efficient recommendation methods can significantly contribute to achieving SDGs.\nCurrent recommendation systems applicable to sustainable development pattern\nrecommendations can be classified into three categories. The first category is contentbased recommendation, which suggests items to users based on the similarity between items calculated from their content. For example, in the case of movies, features such as genre, actors, directors, etc., can be extracted from metadata to calculate item similarity. However, sustainable development patterns are abstract concepts lacking attribute features found in real-world items. As a result, content-based recommendation methods are unsuitable for recommending sustainable development patterns. The\nsecond category is collaborative filtering-based recommendation, which can be divided into item-based collaborative filtering and user-based collaborative filtering. These approaches compute similarity between users or items based on their interaction records to make recommendations (Najmani et al., 2022). However, this approach overlooks the rich geographic features such as economy, culture, and natural resources. It solely relies on the interaction between the target region and sustainable development patterns, disregarding the heterogeneity of geographic features. The third category is knowledge graph-based recommendation. A knowledge graph represents a large-scale semantic network consisting of various real-world concepts as nodes and the relationships between them as edges (Zhu et al., 2022). Knowledge graphs have demonstrated significant value in applications like intelligent question answering, text understanding, and recommendation systems (Balloccu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021; Dubey et al., 2018). Each node represents an entity, while each edge represents a semantic relationship, forming a vast semantic network that provides rich semantic information. This allows for better exploration of connections between users and items, addressing the data sparsity and cold-start problems faced by collaborative filtering and contentbased filtering methods (Liu & Duan, 2021). Due to the sparsity of geographic space, recommending ecological civilization patterns in geographical scenarios faces more severe sparsity issues. Consequently, knowledge graph-based methods offer a promising approach for recommending sustainable development patterns. Knowledge graph-based recommendation systems can be classified into three types: embeddingbased methods, path-based methods, and unified methods (Liu & Duan, 2021), as\ndetailed in relevant works in Section 2.\nWhile knowledge graph-based recommendation systems have achieved success in\ndomains like music, movies, and products, they are currently unsuitable for sustainable development pattern recommendation scenarios. This limitation is evident in the following aspects: First, knowledge graph-based recommendation models construct knowledge graphs consisting of an item graph (H. Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016), which connects items with their features or attributes, and a user-item graph (H. Wang, M. Zhao, et al., 2019; X. Wang, X. He, et al., 2019), which links items with their attribute or feature links, as well as user-item interactions. However, these graphs often lack user-specific features. For instance, in the KGCL method (Yang et al., 2022) using the Yelp2018 1 dataset to construct a knowledge graph, only restaurant-centric features, such as Wi-Fi coverage or all-day availability, are considered for the item graph, disregarding user-specific features (Liu & Duan, 2021). In the context of sustainable development pattern recommendation, this means the neglect of regional features and the failure to consider the heterogeneity of geographical environmental factors. Second, in sustainable development pattern recommendation scenarios, user features comprise both continuous and discrete data, with continuous data being more prevalent. If user feature nodes are treated as entities in the knowledge graph, these continuous data entities are represented as single feature values. After inserting most continuous data entities into the knowledge graph, they only connect with the user entity itself and do not establish connections with other entities to aid in inferring user\n1 https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main\npreferences. Consequently, the associativity within the knowledge graph is relatively low. For example, in cases where the GDP feature between two regions is slightly different, a triple <user1, GDP, user2> may not be formed in the knowledge graph. However, in actual scenarios where the GDP between two regions is not significantly different, assuming the existence of a connection <user1, GDP, user2> can be reasonable. Third, in sustainable development pattern recommendation scenarios, the sparsity of geographical data is evident in the fact that the number of users is much larger than the number of items, resulting in sparser user-item interactions and exacerbating the problem of interaction sparsity in recommendation systems. To summarize, the issues of neglecting user features, low associativity within the knowledge graph, and sparse geographical data render existing knowledge graph-based recommendation methods in computer science unsuitable for sustainable development pattern recommendation. It is crucial to integrate regional development features and adapt knowledge graph recommendation methods accordingly to achieve scientifically accurate recommendations for sustainable development patterns.\nIn response to the limitations of existing knowledge graph-based methods, we\npropose a novel approach called the User Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG) approach. The UGPIG method aims to provide precise recommendations for sustainable development patterns by considering the historical interactions and geographical characteristics of the target region. Here is an overview of the UGPIG approach: Firstly, we focus on the target region and construct a Sustainable Development Pattern Knowledge Graph by gathering geographical features specific to\nthat region. This knowledge graph is referred to as the User Graph (UG). To enhance the UG's associativity, we prune and reconstruct the continuous data entity nodes, resulting in the User Graph after Prune (UGP). This process significantly improves the connectivity between various regional features, enabling better exploration of geographical heterogeneity features. The denser interconnections facilitate the identification of rich features and case studies, thereby supporting more precise recommendations. Secondly, we leverage the user intent method (X. Wang et al., 2021) to create an Intent Graph (IG), which analyzes the historical interaction features and intent features of the target region. The IG provides valuable insights into user preferences and intent related to sustainable development patterns. Finally, we simultaneously explore the geographical features of the target region on the UGP and integrate the information from both the UGP and IG using attention mechanisms. By combining the UGP and IG, the UGPIG method effectively captures the intricate relationships between users, geographical features, and sustainable development patterns. This comprehensive approach overcomes the limitations of existing knowledge graph-based recommendation approaches, allowing for more accurate recommendations that incorporate both user interactions and geographical characteristics. In conclusion, the UGPIG approach offers a novel and effective solution for recommending sustainable development patterns. It addresses the shortcomings of previous knowledge graph-based methods by considering user-specific features, enhancing the associativity within the knowledge graph, and incorporating geographical data. The integration of the UGP and IG allows for a more holistic\nunderstanding of user preferences and regional characteristics, leading to scientifically accurate and precise recommendations for sustainable development patterns.\nThe primary aim of this research is to examine the incubation conditions for\nsustainable development patterns, provide recommendations for appropriate sustainable development patterns in the target region, and ultimately facilitate regional sustainable development. This study makes two significant contributions:  We conduct a thorough validation of the impact of User Graph pruning and Intent\nGraph on the sparsity of geographical data and spatial heterogeneity. Specifically, we design and implement pruning steps for the knowledge graph in the field of geography, ensuring a more refined and representative User Graph. Additionally, we develop the Intent Graph, which effectively captures historical interaction features and user intent, enhancing the sustainable development patterns recommendation performance.\n We propose a novel recommendation method called UGPIG, specifically tailored\nfor the field of environmental geography. This method successfully addresses the sparsity issue among recommended entities and incorporates spatial heterogeneity into the recommendation process. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply UGPIG in a case study at the provincial level, showcasing its practical application and establishing a solid theoretical and methodological foundation for future research on intelligent sustainable development pathways.\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed explanation of\nthe three types of existing knowledge graph-based recommendation methods. Section\n3 introduces the main framework and implementation details of our proposed method, UGPIG. In Section 4, we present comprehensive performance experiments conducted to study the impact of model parameters. Section 5 focuses on analyzing the connotation of the intent vector in the Intent Graph and presents a case study conducted in Fujian Province. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude our work, summarizing the key findings and contributions of our research. 2. Related work\nIn this section, we will briefly introduce three recommendation methods based on\nknowledge graphs. In this paper, we focus on and draw inspiration from the third method, which is the unified methods.\nEmbedding-based Methods: These methods utilize knowledge graph embedding\ntechniques to map information from the knowledge graph into a lower-dimensional space, enriching the representation of items. There are two types of knowledge graph embedding techniques: translation-based models like TransR (Lin et al., 2015) and TransE (Bordes et al., 2013), and semantic matching models like DistMult (Yang et al., 2014). After learning the embedding information, it is used as prior knowledge to guide the recommendation process and predict user preferences for items. Based on the order of training the knowledge graph feature learning module and the recommendation module, embedding-based methods can be further divided into sequential training, alternating training, and joint training. For example, in the news recommendation model DKN (H. Wang et al., 2018), semantic representations of news articles are integrated through the knowledge graph feature learning module, followed by training\nthe recommendation module. This belongs to the sequential training approach. Similarly, joint training approaches include CKE (Zhang et al., 2016), while alternating training approaches include MKR (H. Wang, F. Zhang, M. Zhao, et al., 2019). Although embedding-based methods are straightforward, they often lack interpretability. The embedding methods map entities and relationships into a low-dimensional vector space, which can be challenging to interpret. In the context of sustainable development pattern applications, interpretability is crucial as it represents the importance of geographical factors.\nPath-based Methods: The main idea behind path-based methods is to construct a\nuser-item graph and leverage the connectivity between nodes in the graph to enhance recommendation performance. Depending on the usage of paths, path-based methods can be divided into two categories. The first category utilizes semantic similarity between users and users, users and items, and items and items under different metapaths to regularize the representation of users and items and calculate user preferences for items. Representative algorithms in this category include RuleRec (Ma et al., 2019). The second category focuses on explicitly embedding user-item path information and directly models the user-item relationship. For a user u and an item i, assuming there are n paths, each path can be represented as a vector through learning. Finally, by integrating the vector representations of all paths, user preferences or ratings for items are computed based on the representations of users, items, and paths. Typical algorithms in this category include KPRN (X. Wang, D. Wang, et al., 2019). Compared to embedding-based methods that only utilize first-order connectivity in the knowledge\ngraph, path-based methods have the advantage of mining higher-order connectivity information in the graph between users and items. However, path-based methods also have some drawbacks. For example, the design of meta-paths in terms of size and types relies on manual and extensive domain knowledge, which can be time-consuming. In the context of sustainable development pattern recommendation in geoscientific scenarios, the manual design of meta-paths is costly and not suitable for long-term usage.\nUnified Methods: unified methods have been a recent research trend, and our\nUGPIG method, along with three baseline models (KGCN (H. Wang, M. Zhao, et al., 2019), KGAT (X. Wang, X. He, et al., 2019), and KGIN (X. Wang et al., 2021)), falls into this category. To utilize the semantic information from embedding-based methods and the connectivity information from path-based methods, unified methods combine them to fully leverage the information from both sides for better recommendation performance. For example, KGCN aggregates the domain structure of entities in the knowledge graph and utilizes multi-hop neighbor structures of items to enrich the representation of entities and transmit high-order node information. Moreover, the process of propagating high-order information in joint-based methods can be seen as a process of discovering user preferences (Liu & Duan, 2021), providing the model with a certain level of interpretability. 3. Method\n3.1 Problem Formulation\nIn the recommended scenario of sustainable development patterns, let \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48 be a set\nof target regions, and \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c be a set of sustainable development patterns. The interaction matrix \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c \u2208 \u211d|\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48|\u00d7|\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c| represents the historical interaction between target regions and sustainable development patterns. If \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = 1, it indicates that target region \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62 \u2208 \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48 has previously adopted sustainable development pattern \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c, whereas \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = 0 indicates no historical interaction between region \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62 and sustainable development pattern \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 . Additionally, UGP refers to the knowledge graph of the target regions, which includes a set of entities \ud835\udcb1\ud835\udcb1 and a set of relationships \u211b (for specific examples, refer to Section 3.2.1). Through the IG, which connects target regions with their past adopted sustainable development patterns, the intent common intent vector set \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 is used. Here, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d represents an individual intent vector.\nOur goal is to learn a function \u2131, given the provided UGP, IG, and interaction\nmatrix \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c, to predict the score \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ufffd\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 for a target region \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62 and a sustainable development pattern \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56. By comparing the scores, we can obtain the top-K sustainable development patterns for the target region:\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ufffd\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = \u2131(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48, \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c) (1)\n3.2 Framework overview\nOur proposed UGPIG method, as illustrated in Figure 1, consists of three layers:\nthe Graph Construction Layer, the Information Aggregation Layer, and the Feature Fusion Layer. First, in Graph Construction Layer, considering the heterogeneity of geographical features among different regions, we employ techniques such as natural language processing and web text mining to gather sustainable development pattern case studies (representing historical interactions between target regions and sustainable\ndevelopment patterns) and geographical features of the target regions from various data sources such as official websites and news media. We construct the knowledge graph UG using the geographical features of the target regions and build the IG using the case studies of sustainable development patterns. We then prune and reconstruct UG to generate UGP, enhancing the relevance of the knowledge graph (details of the pruning operation can be found in Section 3.3.1). Next, in the Information Aggregation Layer, we aggregate information on UGP and IG separately. This involves extracting heterogeneous features of the target regions, historical interactions, and intent features. Finally, in the Feature Fusion Layer, we employ attention mechanisms to fuse the two sets of features obtained from the information aggregation layer. This approach considers both types of features and produces a representation of the target region that addresses data sparsity. By taking the dot product between the target region representation and the representation of sustainable development patterns obtained from the aggregation module, we obtain preference scores for the target region regarding the various sustainable development patterns."

            "text": "To recommend sustainable development patterns, it is essential to construct a\ncomprehensive semantic network that encompasses various resource information of regions and prominent sustainable development patterns, and establish their associations. Therefore, in this part, we first construct UG based on the information available in the database. Then, we prune and reconstruct the continuous features from the user's knowledge graph to form UGP. Subsequently, we utilize historical interaction data and manually defined intent vector group \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 to build IG. 3.3.1 Construction and pruning of User Graph\nAs shown in Figure 1, the Database represents the two approaches through which\nwe collect the necessary data: the web and official sources. Such as Baidu Encyclopedia and Resource and Environment Science and Data Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences2. We gather a vast amount of sustainable development pattern data from these two sources. After aggregating, aligning, and disambiguating the collected data, we obtain structured data required to build the UG and IG. In this process, UG is constructed using the geographical feature data of the target regions. UG is a semantic network composed of triples <target region, geographical feature, target region>. It does not include any sustainable development pattern information; it is solely composed of the target regions and their corresponding features.\nUser Graph: The User Graph is centered around the target regions, taking into\naccount the heterogeneity of geographical features across different regions. To address\n2 https://www.resdc.cn/\nthis requirement, six categories of indicators have been scientifically designed to represent the geographical features of the target regions. Specifically, these categories include 8 indicators related to the geographical location, 4 indicators related to the richness of resources, 5 indicators related to economic development, 5 indicators related to environmental friendliness, 3 indicators related to social development, and 4 indicators related to cultural factors. In total, there are 29 indicators, as detailed in Table 1. For a specific target region, various geographical features such as latitude and longitude, altitude, meteorological data, hydrological information, and soil characteristics are collected to construct the User Graph. Each regional entity is connected to these features through the relationships depicted in Table 1. Paths in the form of <target region, geographical feature, target region> are formed among different regions. These paths constitute a large semantic network. By mining the semantic information in the User Graph, we can fully consider the geographical features of the target regions and provide intelligent analysis and decision support for sustainable development pattern recommendations to individuals.\nsustainable development patterns, it is evident that the correlation degree of nodes in UG is very low. This is due to the fact that, as shown in Table 1, 68.97% (20/29) of the\nuser features consist of continuous data, and these continuous features in the knowledge graph often only connect with the target region itself. To improve the correlation degree of the knowledge graph, we can prune the continuous entity nodes from the knowledge graph and reintroduce them through a discretization process to reconstruct the knowledge graph and enhance its correlation degree. This leads to the generation of a new knowledge graph called UGP. As shown in Figure 2, the orange nodes represent target region nodes, while the nodes of other colors represent feature nodes of the target regions. Edges of the same color indicate the same relationship type in UG, and nodes of the same color represent nodes of the same type in UG. Taking the nodes in the figure as an example, some nodes belong to the same category of continuous features. Through the discretization process, it is discovered that these two nodes belong to the same level. Consequently, these two nodes can be pruned from the graph, and new nodes are created to connect with the target regions previously linked to the pruned nodes. The graph density before pruning is 14.29%, while after pruning, the density increases to 27.28%. Therefore, the correlation degree of the knowledge graph is enhanced as originally disconnected target regions now have new paths connecting them. Refer to Algorithm 1 for the specific pruning algorithm.\nAlgorithm 1 User Graph Pruning Input: Output: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.

If it is continuous, the algorithm prunes the feature node \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 from the graph. Then, it checks if the discretized node Discrete(\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63) corresponding to the continuous node \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 exists. If it exists, the algorithm directly connects the target region \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62 to the new discretized node Discrete(\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63). If it does not exist, the algorithm uses the CreateDiscreteNode function to create a new discrete node \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 and connects node \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62 to node \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63. Finally, if the node \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 itself is already a discrete feature, the algorithm moves on to the next pair (\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63) of target region and feature. The CreateDiscreteNode function aims to discretize continuous data by dividing it into different levels. Taking the example of the number of animal and plant habitats (ranging from 0 to 35), it can be divided into four levels: level 1 (0), level 2 (1-2), level 3 (3-4), and level 4 (above 5), based on the quantity of habitats. Similar approaches can be applied to discretize other continuous data as well. 3.3.2 Construction of Intent Graph\nIntent Graph\uff1aAs shown in the Graph Construction Layer in Figure 1, the IG is\ncomposed of the sustainable development patterns observed in the target regions and a shared collection of intent vectors among all target regions. In this context, the target region node \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62 (represented as an orange node) is connected to the shared intent vector node \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d (represented as a blue node) and the sustainable development pattern node \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (represented as a green node), forming the relationship <\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56>. The purpose of IG is to represent the dependency of relationships within the UGP using intent vectors \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d, analyze the connections between the target regions and sustainable development patterns, and provide a certain level of interpretability for the model. It is important to note that the collection of intent vectors \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 consists of more than one vector, as they are shared among all target regions. Unlike the approach described in KTUP (Cao et al., 2019), where each intent vector is bound to a relationship in the knowledge graph, each intent vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d in the IG is defined as a combination of all relationships in the UGP. This design allows the intent vectors to comprehensively represent the features and needs of the target regions, enabling a better capture of the associations between the target regions and sustainable development patterns.\nThe intent vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d is defined as follows:\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d = \ufffd \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d)\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\u2208\u211b\n(2)\nThe embedding representation of intent vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d is denoted as \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d, \u211b represents\nthe set of all relationships in UG, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d)represents the importance of relationship \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f to intent vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f represents the embedding representation of relationship \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f in the UGP, and \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d is a trainable matrix representing the weight between \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d . The calculation of \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d) is as follows:\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d) = exp (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d)\n\u2211 exp (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\u2032\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d)\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\u2032\u2208\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 (3)\nFurthermore, each intent vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d is independent of each other, indicating that\neach intent has different weights on the relationships in UGP. Each intent vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d represents a distinct intent, and there is a shared set of intent vectors among all target regions. Moreover, the degree of reliance on a specific intent vector p may vary across different regions. As shown in Figure 3, assuming there are three vectors in the shared set of intent vectors, the magnitude of \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd determines which intent is more important to the user. Each intent vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d has different weights on the relationships \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f in UGP. For more information about IG, please refer to (X. Wang et al., 2021)."

In the Top-3 recommendations, \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc391@3 shows an improvement of 9.61% compared to KGCN, 7.02% compared to KGAT, and 3.47% compared to the best baseline model KGIN. \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52@3 exhibits the highest improvement of 15.14%, surpassing the best baseline model KGIN by 8.86%.

In the Top-5 recommendations, \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc391@5 shows an improvement of 8.53% compared to KGCN, 7.23% compared to KGAT, and 2.16% compared to the best baseline model KGIN. \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52@5 exhibits the highest improvement of 19.06%, surpassing the best baseline model KGIN by 7.14%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method performs better regardless of the number of results.\nDue to the absence of attention mechanism in the convolutional operation of\nKGCN, the representation of entities in KGCN incorporates a significant amount of noise. KGAT reduces the interference of noise on entity representation by utilizing\nknowledge graph embedding technique TransR and attention mechanism, resulting in slightly better performance than KGCN. KGIN enhances entity representation by introducing intent vectors, thereby improving the performance of the recommendation system. Our method, UGPIG, builds upon KGIN by incorporating the exploration of geographic heterogeneity through UGP and enhancing the representation of target regions through graph pruning and attention blocks. This approach achieves the best performance. In summary, the breeding of sustainable development patterns relies primarily on the geographic features of target regions. Baseline models perform poorly because they do not consider the heterogeneity among different regions."

Specifically, following the parameter settings mentioned in section 4.2, when studying a particular parameter, we fix the other parameters and vary the value of that parameter to observe the changes in the model's\nperformance.\nImpact of neighbor aggregation size\uff1aBy varying the number of aggregation\nlayers L in the User Graph, we investigated the impact of layer depth on the model's recommendation performance. As shown in Table 5, we observed that as the number of layers increased, higher-order semantic information from the User Graph was captured, and the recommendation performance gradually improved. However, a decline in performance was observed when L=5, which we attribute to the introduction of noise and perturbation caused by the repetition of path information during the process of information aggregation.\nincreasing the number of intent vectors |\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43| allows for finer granularity in capturing user preferences. Consequently, the recommendation performance improves. When the number of intent vectors becomes too large, the granularity of the intents becomes too fine, resulting in a loss of useful information. As shown in Table 6, the performance of the recommendation system starts to decline when the number of intent vectors changes from 4 to 5.\nis shown in Table 7. As shown in Table 8, we denote the UGPIG method without graph\npruning as UGPIGw/o GP. It can be observed that the knowledge graph without pruning has low connectivity, and multi-hop paths among nodes can lead to a significant amount of redundant path calculations, resulting in lower performance of the recommendation system. By applying graph pruning, 38,075 geographic feature nodes were removed, resulting in a 0.854% increase in graph density. The performance of the recommendation system improved by 1.27%.\nthat does not use an attention block to fuse the features from IG and UGP as UGPIGw/o Att . IG and UGP belong to different semantic spaces, and their representations of the target regions are different. If we simply add them together to fuse the representations, we will lose their respective spatial information. By using an attention block, the two semantic spaces are mapped to the same space through matrices, preserving their unique information. Compared to not using an attention block, F1@3 improved by 1.61%."

As depicted in Figure 2, each vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d in the intent vector group \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 exhibits different weights for the relationships in UGP. Table 10 below presents the top 5 relationships with the highest weights for each intent vector.\nare related to Richness of Resources in Table1, indicating that \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d1 has a stronger preference for Richness of Resources. For \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d2 , three Geographical Location-related relationships appear in the Top-5, suggesting that \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d2 emphasizes the Geographical Location information of the target region. The Top-5 relationships of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d3 cover\nEnvironmental Friendliness, Geographical Location, Richness of Resources, Economic Development, and Cultural Factors, indicating a balanced intent for \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d3. In the case of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d4 , two relationships are related to Environmental Friendliness, indicating that \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d4 values the environmental information of the target region. Although each intent vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d has different weights for the relationships in the UGP, by examining the frequency and order of appearance of relationship types in the Top-5 relationships, we can observe a decreasing dependency of sustainable development patterns on Environmental Friendliness, Richness of Resources, Geographical Location, Economic Development, Cultural Factors, and Social Development. Firstly, areas with higher Environmental Friendliness and Richness of Resources, as well as superior Geographical Location, often possess better natural conditions and environmental awareness, making them more conducive to the development of sustainable development patterns and ensuring the sustainability of such patterns. Therefore, areas with a better starting point are more likely to achieve sustainable development. Secondly, economically developed areas typically have more abundant human and financial resources, enabling them to invest more funds and technological support, making it easier for them to implement sustainable development patterns and achieve better results. But relatively impoverished areas may face challenges such as insufficient funding and lack of technological support, requiring more government and social support to achieve sustainable development. Furthermore, Cultural Factors and Social Development also have certain influences on the realization of sustainable development. Areas with higher cultural qualities and social awareness are more likely to implement ecological\ncivilization construction from cultural and social perspectives. In areas with weaker cultural and social development, more efforts and time may be needed to promote sustainable development. In conclusion, the dependency of target region on Environmental Friendliness, Richness of Resources, Geographical Location, Economic Development, Cultural Factors, and Social Development gradually decreases when developing sustainable development patterns. This is the result of the comprehensive interaction among various factors, highlighting the need for tailored implementation of sustainable development patterns based on local conditions.\nBelow is a specific example. Figure 6 shows the Top-3 recommendations for\nShangri-La City using the UGPIG method, namely \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc566 Natural Park pattern, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5615 Characteristic Town pattern, and \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5637 Orchard Livestock pattern. Among them, the importance scores of the four intent vectors for Shangri-La City are 0.21, 0.21, 0.26, and 0.32, respectively. The score for vector \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d4 is the highest, indicating that \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d4 emphasizes the Environmental Friendliness of the target region. This aligns with the analysis results mentioned earlier, which suggest that sustainable development patterns have the highest dependency on Environmental Friendliness. The actual recommendation results in Shangri-La City support this finding. Unlike described in KGIN (X. Wang et al., 2021) where movie recommendations depend on a specific intent, the importance scores of the intent vectors in our case are very close. Although \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d4 has the highest score, it indicates that the recommendation of sustainable development patterns in geoscientific scenarios is a result of the collective influence of multiple intent vectors rather than relying on a single intent. Therefore, Shangri-La City obtains\nthe \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc566, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5615, and \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5637 patterns through the combined effects of the four intent vectors."

Through comparison, it points out the direction for the sustainable development of Fujian Province in the future. 5.2.1 Sustainable development direction planning\nIn Section 4.1, it was mentioned that the 94 third-level sustainable development\npatterns can be classified into six categories of second-level sustainable development patterns. These categories are: Nature Conservation Pattern, Ecological Restoration and Governance Pattern, Ecological Agriculture Pattern, New Urbanization Pattern, Ecological Industrial Pattern, and Green Consumption Pattern. With the consideration\nof geographic heterogeneity, we compare the top-5 recommended results for each county in Fujian Province using the UGPIG method with the second-level sustainable development pattern categories to which the past sustainable development patterns in Fujian Province belong. If there is coincidence between the two, it indicates that the government's past decision-making direction is appropriate. However, if there is a significant deviation, adjustments need to be made for future development directions. Specifically, there are four development directions: Clearly Oriented (coincidence degree = 100%), Unhurriedly Adjustable (coincidence degree > 50%), Expectantly Transitional (coincidence degree < 50%), and Urgently Transitional (coincidence degree = 0%). The formula for calculating the coincidence degree is as follows:\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = |\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62)\u2229R(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62)|\n|\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62)| (15)\nConsider the example of Siming District. \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62) represents the set of second-level\ncategories to which the past sustainable development patterns in Siming District belong, and \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62) represents the set of second-level categories to which the top-5 recommended sustainable development patterns belong. In Siming District, the past sustainable development patterns belong to three second-level categories: Ecological Restoration and Governance Pattern, Ecological Agriculture Pattern, and Green Consumption Pattern. However, the top-5 recommended sustainable development patterns belong to the categories of Nature Conservation Pattern, Ecological Agriculture Pattern, and New Urbanization Pattern. Among these, only the Ecological Agriculture Pattern is present in both the past development list and the recommended results. Therefore, the \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 is 1/3 = 33.33%. This indicates that\nSiming District's development direction is Expectantly Transitional.\nThe development direction planning results for the Fujian region are shown in\nFigure 7. Among the 84 districts and counties in Fujian Province, during the creation of the UKG, there were six regions where no historical interaction with sustainable development patterns was identified. These regions are represented as gray in Figure 7, indicating that they cannot be compared with existing representative sustainable development patterns due to the absence of historical data. Therefore, in this analysis, we consider a total sample size of 78. Overall, among these 78 samples, the proportion of districts categorized as \"Clearly Oriented\" and \"Unhurriedly Adjustable\" is 78.20%. This indicates that the majority of regions in their current development of sustainable development patterns take into account local geographical factors and follow objective development principles. However, there exists an imbalance in the development of ecological civilization at the local level. From Figure 7, it can be observed that districts classified as \"Urgently Transitional\" are predominantly concentrated in the northern region. Taking the example of Siming City and Ningde City, all the counties under Siming City fall into the transitional categories of \"Clearly Oriented\" and \"Unhurriedly Adjustable,\" while 33.3% of the districts in Ningde City are classified as \"Urgently Transitional.\" In Fujian Province, where sustainable development pattern development largely adheres to objective principles and exhibits an imbalance among local regions, the recommendations provided by sustainable development pattern analysis can serve as a reference for guiding sustainable development transformation in different regions."

In this section, we will analyze the ecological development in government planning documents and calculate the accuracy of the Top-5 recommendations generated by the UGPIG method. This will provide a better understanding of the scientific validity of the development direction planning obtained through the UGPIG method.\nFirstly, we define the accuracy of the Top-5 recommendations as follows:\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 = \u2211 |\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50)\u2229\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50)|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u2208\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\n5 \u2217 |\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37| (16)\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37 is the set of 78 counties in Fujian Province, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50) represents the set of Top-\n5 recommendations for county \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 , and \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50) represents the set of sustainable development patterns mentioned in the government planning documents for county d. This formula reflects the extent to which the Top-5 recommendations are reflected in the government planning documents of each region.\nAfter calculation, the accuracy of the Top-5 recommendations in Fujian Province\nis 79.74%. The results provide the following insights and conclusions regarding the ecological development of Fujian Province:\n\u2022High scientific and feasibility level of government planning: The government's\necological development plans show a high degree of similarity to the recommended sustainable development patterns based on data analysis. This indicates that the government planning process has adequately considered the changing trends in ecosystems and the impact of human activities on the environment.\n\u2022High credibility of the model: By measuring the accuracy against government\nplanning, we can validate the high credibility of our UGPIG method and further enhance the practicality of sustainable development pattern recommendations.\n\u2022Reinforcement of scientific and practical sustainable development: The similarity\nbetween government planning and the recommended sustainable development patterns suggests that the insights from government planning and the recommended sustainable development patterns can complement and promote each other in the process of\necological construction. This strengthens the scientific basis and practical effectiveness of sustainable development initiatives. 6. Conclusion\nThe proposed method in this paper, UGPIG, addresses the recommendation of\nsustainable development patterns. The method begins by constructing User Graph based on regional features and Intent Graph which incorporates user intent. It employs UG pruning within the knowledge graph to enhance relevance and generate UGP. Additionally, it leverages user information in both the Intent Graph and User Graph, aggregating the representations of the target region through attention mechanisms. This process generates scores for the sustainable development patterns in the target region, ultimately providing recommendations for specific areas. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of the sustainable development pattern recommendation model, particularly in considering geographical heterogeneity.\nHowever, it should be noted that the current implementation of UGPIG relies\nsolely on the relationships within the User Graph to construct the intent vector. This approach lacks the ability to provide high-quality interpretability in the form of intent vectors, which must be manually provided and cannot be automatically learned by the model. Furthermore, aggregating user information in both the Intent Graph and the User Graph introduces additional noise. Additionally, due to the lack of metadata for sustainable development patterns, enriching the representation of patterns with multimodal data such as images and text could be explored. Therefore, future research\nshould focus on addressing these challenges, including noise reduction, automatic determination of intent vector count, and the incorporation of multimodal representations for sustainable development patterns."
