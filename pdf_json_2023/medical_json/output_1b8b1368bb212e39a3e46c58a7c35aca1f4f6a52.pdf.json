            "text": "Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene (The Huntington\u2019s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993; Ross and Tabrizi, 2011). In HD, the most prominent pathological change is the selective neurodegeneration in the striatum despite the ubiquitous expression of mHtt throughout the brain and body (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998; Walker, 2007). Although the progressive accumulation of mutant HTT (mHTT) is known to contribute to selective neurodegeneration in the striatum (Vonsattel et al., 1985; Bates et al., 2015), the mechanism underlying this process remains to be investigated.\nRhes, also known as Ras homolog enriched in the striatum, is a GTP-binding protein that is encoded by the Rasd2 gene (Spano et al., 2004). It is involved in mediating dopamine-related behaviors and signaling pathways, serving as an inhibitor of motor stimuli in the striatum (Falk et al., 1999; Vargiu et al., 2001; Shahani et al., 2016; Napolitano et al., 2018). Additionally, Rhes plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy. It has been reported that Rhes may regulate the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Subramaniam et al., 2011), a key signaling pathway involved in cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. Moreover, Rhes has been suggested to induce autophagy through mTOR-independent pathways (Mealer et al., 2014), potentially impacting protein quality control and clearance.\nIncreasing evidence supports the pathogenic role of Rhes in the selective striatal degeneration observed in HD. In HD cell models, Rhes promotes the accumulation of mHTT protein and mediates its cytotoxicity (Subramaniam et al., 2009). Knockdown of Rhes is protective in the htt171-82Q primary striatal neuron model of HD (Seredenina et al., 2011). Rhes knockout mice were protected from neurotoxicity and motor dysfunction in a HD model elicited by 3-nitropropionic acid (Mealer et al., 2013). It is reported that genetic knockout of Rhes in the R6/1 HD mice significantly delayed the onset of HD-like symptoms like motor dysfunction and dystonia (Baiamonte et al., 2013). Moreover, Rhes deletion prevents striatal atrophy, brain weight loss, and psychiatric-like behavioral deficits in N171-82Q mice (Swarnkar et al., 2015). Conversely, ectopic overexpression of Rhes in the cerebellum of N171-82Q HD transgenic mice accelerates motor deficits and neurodegeneration (Swarnkar et al., 2015).\nHowever, conflicting data have been reported regarding the role of Rhes in HD. On one hand, Rhes levels are reduced in the brains of HD patients (Hodges et al., 2006). A study showed that genetic knockout of Rhes in wild-type mice affects body weight, motor coordination, and psychiatric behaviors (Spano et al., 2004; Heikkinen et al., 2021). Moreover, Rhes suppression led to increased anxiety-like behaviors and enhanced striatal atrophy in BACHD mice (Lee et al., 2014). On the other hand, overexpression of Rhes alleviates motor deficits and improves brain pathology in N171-82Q mice (Lee et al., 2015). Intriguingly, a recent study reported that genetic Rhes knockout does not substantially ameliorate or exacerbate HD phenotypes in HD Q175 mice (Heikkinen et al., 2021). Given these discrepancies, further in vivo investigations are required to determine the nuanced role of Rhes in HD.\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Rhes knockdown using CRISPR/Cas9 at different disease stages in HD knock-in (KI) mice. Through the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction, we observed that the depletion of Rhes in HD KI mice resulted in the accumulation of mHTT, decreased neuronal cell staining, and increased astrogliosis specifically in the 22-week-old (representing the presymptomatic stage) HD KI mice. However, no such effects were observed in the 36- week-old (representing the symptomatic stage) HD KI mice. Considering the involvement of Rhes in regulating autophagy, an essential process that clears misfolded protein, we examined the level of P62 and LC3-II, two known markers of autophagy activity. We found an increase in P62 levels and a reduction of LC3-II levels upon Rhes deletion in 22-week-old HD KI mice. Furthermore, Western blotting results revealed that the protein level of mTOR, phosphorylation of mTOR, and phosphorylation of beclin-1 remained unchanged, while beclin-1 was decreased. These results suggested that Rhes deletion may lead to a reduction in autophagy activity through an mTOR-independent manner. Our studies suggest a potential protective role of Rhes during the presymptomatic stage of HD KI mice."

            "text": "CRISPR/Cas9 both in vitro and in vivo\nRas homolog enriched in striatum, which is encoded by the Rasd2 gene, was targeted for knockdown via CRISPR/Cas9 technology by using four guide RNAs (gRNAs) designed to target exon 2 of the mouse Rasd2 gene (T1, T2, T3, and T4) (Figure 1A). These gRNAs were then subcloned into a px552 vector, which expressed the gRNAs under the U6 promoter and red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the CMV promoter (Figure 1B). The expression of RFP served as an indicator of Rasd2 gRNA expression. To assess the targeting efficiency of Rasd2 gRNAs, we transfected them along with a Cas9 plasmid into cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a). Analysis of the DNA using T7E1 digestion revealed that Rasd2 gRNAs efficiently edited the Rasd2 gene (Figure 1C). For further validation in vivo, we selected two gRNAs (T3 and T4) that exhibited higher editing efficiency in N2a cells.\nTo assess the targeting effect of Rasd2 gRNAs in vivo, we packaged the px552 gRNA into an AAV9 virus. Stereotaxic injection of AAV viruses expressing control gRNA or Rasd2 gRNA was performed in the striatum of Cas9 mice (Figure 2A), that express Cas9 ubiquitously under the CAG promoter (Liu et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2020). AAV-Rasd2-gRNAs of T3 and T4, either alone or in combination, were injected into one side of the striatum of 2-month-old Cas9 mice. The contralateral side was injected with AAV-control-gRNA, which did not target any known gene (Yang et al., 2017), to rule out non-specific effects caused by viral transduction. After 28 days, the brains of the AAV-injected mice were dissected, and the distribution of RFP fluorescence signal confirmed the predominant expression of Rasd2 gRNA in the striatum (Figure 2B).

This finding was further validated by immunohistochemical staining against Rhes in the AAV-injected brains (Figure 2D), confirming the efficient elimination of Rhes in vivo through AAVRasd2-gRNAs injection.\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org\nKnockdown of Rhes accelerates the aggregation of mHTT at the presymptomatic stage of HD KI mice\nPrevious studies have indicated that genetic knockout of Rhes during the embryonic stage can lead to abnormal physiological function in mice at a certain age (Spano et al., 2004; Heikkinen et al., 2021). Considering this, we decided to knockdown Rhes at different disease stages in the HD mouse model. The HD 140Q/Cas9 (referred to as HD KI) mice, which were generated previously by crossing HD 140Q KI mice with Cas9 transgenic mice (Liu et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2020), were used in our study (Figure 3A). These mice exhibit intranuclear mHTT aggregations in the striatum and behavioral defects starting at 7 months old (28 weeks old), similar to the HD140Q KI mice (Yang et al., 2020). AAV injection was performed at 14 weeks old and 28 weeks old, corresponding to the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages, respectively (Figure 3A). One side of the HD KI mouse striatum was injected with AAV-Rasd2 gRNA, while the contralateral striatum was injected with AAV-control gRNA. Eight weeks after injection, the injected brains were examined (Figure 3A).\nSince the striatum is the most affected brain region in HD and Rhes are mainly expressed in the striatum, we focused on the effect of Rhes knockdown on the striatum. To assess the impact of Rhes knockdown on the level of mHTT in the striatum, we examined the levels of mHTT in the injected mice. Intriguingly, in the 14-weeks-old-injected group, Western blotting showed a significant increase in the amount of mHTT aggregates in the AAV-Rasd2 gRNA injected side of the striatum after 8 weeks of injection, while no mHTT aggregation was observed in the AAVcontrol gRNA injected side (Figures 3B, C). However, in the 28-weeks-old-injected group, a substantial amount of aggregated mHTT was found on both sides of the striatum, with no significant difference (Figures 3B, C). In addition, no significant alternations were found on the level of fragments mHTT including exon1 mHTT, which were proteolyzed from full-length mHTT and play key roles in the pathogenesis of HD (Landles et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2020) (Figures 3B, C). To further validate these findings, the injected brain slices were subjected to immunohistochemistry using mEM48 staining. The results confirmed that AAV-Rasd2 gRNA increased the amount of aggregated mHTT in the 14- weeks-old-injected group (Figure 3D). These results indicate that knockdown of Rhes accelerates the aggregation of mHTT at the presymptomatic stage of HD KI mice.\nKnockdown of Rhes causes NeuN-positive cell reduction in the striatum of HD KI mice at the presymptomatic stage\nSince preferential neuronal loss in the striatum is an important feature in HD patient brains, we aimed to investigate the impact of Rhes knockdown on neuronal loss in HD KI mice. Immunohistochemistry results revealed a notable reduction in NeuN staining intensity in the striatum of the AAV-Rasd2\ngRNA-injected side as compared to the contralateral AAVcontrol gRNA-injected side in the 14-weeks-old-injected group (Figure 4A). However, in the 28-weeks-old-injected group, the difference in NeuN staining between the AAV-Rasd2 gRNAinjected side and the contralateral AAV-control gRNA-injected side was negligible (Figure 4A). Western blotting confirmed a significant decrease in NeuN levels on the AAV-Rasd2 gRNAinjected side compared to AAV-control gRNA-injected side in the 14-weeks-old injected group (Figures 4B, C).\nNext, we examined astrogliosis, another hallmark of neurodegeneration characterized by reactive astrocytes with increased GFAP staining (Yang et al., 2017). As expected, GFAP staining was significantly elevated in the striatum of HD KI mice during the symptomatic stage. However, knockdown of Rhes did not notably increase GFAP staining in the 28-weeks-old-injected group (Figure 5A). Conversely, in the 14-weeks-old injected HD KI mice, GFAP staining was significantly increased in the AAV-Rasd2 gRNA-injected side compared to the contralateral AAV-control gRNA-injected side (Figures 5B, C).\nKnockdown of Rhes leads to reduced autophagy activity during the presymptomatic stage\nRas homolog enriched in striatum has been previously implicated as a modulator of autophagy (Mealer et al., 2014), a vital process involved in the clearance of misfolded proteins. Our results suggested that the depletion of Rhes led to the accumulation of mHTT in the striatum of HD KI mice at 22 weeks old (8 weeks after injection), suggesting a potential disturbance in autophagy during the presymptomatic stage.\nTo investigate the impact of Rhes knockdown on autophagy, we first examined the levels of P62, an autophagy substrate that is used as a reporter of autophagy activity (Johansen and Lamark, 2011). Western blotting analysis of the Rasd2 gRNA-injected and control-gRNA-injected striatum showed a significant increase in P62 levels in the AAV-Rasd2 gRNA-injected side, while no significant change was observed on the contralateral AAV-control gRNA-injected side (Figures 6A, B). For further investigation, we check the status of LC3, the most widely used autophagosome marker. Western blotting results showed a decrease of LC3-II and LC3-II/LC3-I in the AAV-Rasd2 gRNA-injected side (Figures 6A, C). Increased P62 level and decreased LC3-II suggested reduced autophagy activity during the presymptomatic stage upon Rhes knockdown.\nPrevious reports have indicated that Rhes may bind and activate mTOR to inhibit autophagy (Subramaniam et al., 2011). Nevertheless, we did not observe changes in mTOR activity, indicated by unaltered levels of mTOR and phosphorylation of mTOR (Figures 6A, D), after Rhes deletion. Considering Rhes\u2019s potential role in regulating autophagy through an mTORindependent mechanism involving Beclin-1 (Kang et al., 2011; Mealer et al., 2014; Menon and Dhamija, 2018), we assessed the protein level of Beclin-1 and its phosphorylation. A decreased protein level of Beclin-1 (Figures 6A, E, F) was found in the AAV-Rasd2 gRNA-injected side, which further supports impaired autophagy during the presymptomatic stage.

            "text": "Modulating the protein level of Rhes has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for HD. However, conflicting findings regarding the role of Rhes in HD have been reported on multiple occasions (Subramaniam et al., 2009; Baiamonte et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2014, 2015; Swarnkar et al., 2015) using cell models or transgenic HD mouse models. Given that mHTT is the prime culprit for HD and its protein level influences the disease progression (Yang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019), we investigated the effect of Rhes deletion on mHTT level and neuropathology in the striatum at different disease stages in the HD KI mouse model. Our results showed that deletion of Rhes at an early age of the HD KI mice, resulted in increased mHTT aggregates, while at a later stage, there is no significant change of mHTT level or aggregates. It has been demonstrated that autophagy is the primary clearance system for aggregate-prone proteins such as mHTT, and Rhes may play a role in regulating autophagy activity (Ravikumar et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2008; Mealer et al., 2014; Li et al., 2019). Therefore, we hypothesized that the depletion of Rhes could also impact autophagy. When Rhes was knockdown in HD KI mice at 22 weeks old, there was a decrease in LC3-II level and an increase in P62 level. The increase in p62 levels is often observed when autophagosome synthesis or maturation or autophagic degradation is inhibited or compromised, while the decrease in LC3-II may indicate either a decrease in autophagosome synthesis or an enhancement of autophagic degradation (Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007; Johansen and Lamark, 2011; Yoshii and Mizushima, 2017). These results suggest that reduced or impaired autophagy activity may result from decreased autophagosome synthesis. Previous studies have reported that Rhes can modulate autophagy in both mTOR-dependent or independent manners (Kang et al., 2011; Subramaniam et al., 2011; Mealer et al., 2014; Menon and Dhamija, 2018). Nevertheless, we did not see changes in mTOR activity after Rhes deletion, which aligns with a previous\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 06 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 5 Knockdown of Rhes causes astrogliosis in the striatum during the presymptomatic stage of HD KI mice.

It has been reported that the release of Beclin-1 from Bcl2/Bcl-XL proteins seems to be an essential step for initiating the autophagic response (Kang et al., 2011; Menon and Dhamija, 2018) and Rhes may bind Beclin-1 and competitively displace Bcl2 from Beclin-1 to induce autophagosome synthesis (Mealer et al., 2014), it is plausible that Rhes deletion may disturb autophagy induction. In addition, reduced Beclin-1 may also cause autophagy deficiency (Yue et al., 2003; Salminen et al., 2013). Our Western blotting showed that Beclin-1 was decreased after knocking down of Rhes, although the one phosphor-Beclin-1 (pBeclin-1) antibody did not show a change of p-Beclin-1 (ser15), which might not be the correct phosphorylation site. These results suggested that the protective role of Rhes may stem from its involvement in regulating autophagy through mTOR-independent pathways during the presymptomatic stage of HD.\nOur results revealed that depletion of Rhes in HD KI mice via AAV transduction caused remarkable accumulation of mHTT at 22 weeks old (8 weeks after injection), but have no obvious effect at 36 weeks old HD KI mice (8 weeks after injection). Rhes has been reported to as a SUMO-E3 ligase and is capable of SUMOylating\nand stabilizing soluble mHTT in cell models (Subramaniam et al., 2009, 2010), it is plausible to suggest that the depletion of Rhes may result in reduced sumoylation of soluble mHTT, potentially promoting the aggregation of mHTT during the presymptomatic stage in HD KI mice. Furthermore, there was neurodegeneration (neuronal loss and astrogliosis) concurrent with the appearance of mHTT aggregations in the 22-week-old HD KI mice. These findings suggest that Rhes may play a protective role during the presymptomatic stage in HD KI mice. This is consistent with previous studies that showed Rhes deletion in BACHD transgenic mice enhanced striatal atrophy while overexpression of Rhes improved brain pathology in N171-82Q transgenic mice (Lee et al., 2014, 2015). It is possible that the function of autophagy remains unaffected during this stage, but when Rhes was deleted, it inhibits the autophagy activity, leading to aggregation of mHTT and exacerbation of neurodegeneration (neuronal loss and astrogliosis). However, during the symptomatic stage, the autophagy system in HD KI mice is already impaired (Brattas et al., 2021), and the deletion of Rhes might not worsen the situation.\nAlthough we have strong evidence for the Rhes affecting mHTT aggregates formation in the early stage of HD KI mouse brain striatum, some limitations exist. Firstly, one of the limitations\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 6 Knockdown of Rhes leads to reduced autophagy activity in the striatum during the presymptomatic stage of HD KI mice. (A) Western blotting analysis of P62, LC3, Phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR), mTOR, p-Beclin-1, and Beclin-1 in the AAV-control gRNA and AAV-Rasd2 gRNA-injected striatum at the age of 14+ 8 weeks, compared to the AAV-control-gRNA-injected side. Densitometric ratios of P62 (B), LC3-II/LC3-I (C), p-mTOR/mTOR (D), Beclin-1 (E), and p-Beclin-1/Beclin-1 (F) to the vinculin were presented. The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, Student\u2019s t-test, **P = 0.0074 (P62), *P = 0.0028 (LC3-II/LC3-I), *P = 0.0223 (Beclin-1), n = at least 3 per group.\nof this study is the relatively small sample size and future work with more animals is needed to enhance the robustness of our findings. Secondly, we only studied Rhes effects in one HD mouse model, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other models or human patients. The use of different mouse models with varying genetic backgrounds, transgenic or knock-in models, and different HTT constructs (exon1 or full-length) may contribute to the discrepancies observed in previous studies regarding the role of Rhes in HD. Thirdly, we focused on investigating the effects of Rhes depletion at two specific time points, which may not fully capture the dynamic changes in disease progression. In addition, Rhes is recently reported to transport mHTT from striatum to other brain regions (Sharma and Subramaniam, 2019; Ramirez-Jarquin et al., 2022). It is important to consider the potential spatial-temporal variations in Rhes function and its impact on neurodegeneration in future studies. Existing evidence indicates that Rhes is a multifaceted player in HD pathogenesis, participating through sumoylation, mTOR-dependent, or mTOR-independent manner to regulate autophagy and other processes. Therefore, intervening with endogenous Rhes in HD models and systematically assessing its impact on various functions could potentially provide valuable insights into its role in the development of HD. Furthermore, the majority of current studies on Rhes in HD have been conducted using HD mouse models, it would be valuable to explore the role of Rhes in patient-derived HD cell models or large animal models to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its involvement in HD pathogenesis."
