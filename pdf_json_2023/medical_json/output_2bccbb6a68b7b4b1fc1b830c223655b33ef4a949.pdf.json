    "abstractText": "As a non-traditional sample matrix, feather samples can be used to effectively monitor antibiotic addition and organismal residue levels in poultry feeding. Therefore, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to simultaneously determine the residue levels of 26 quinolones in poultry feathers. The feather samples were extracted by sonication with a 1% formic acid and acetonitrile mixture in a water bath at 50 \u25e6C for 30 min, purified by the adsorption of multiple matrix impurities, dried with nitrogen, redissolved, and analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. The linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), recovery and precision were calculated. The 26 antibiotics demonstrated good linearity in the linear range. The recoveries and coefficients of variation were 78.9\u2013110% and <13.7% at standard spiked levels of 10, 100 and 200 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. The LOD and LOQ were 0.12\u20131.31 and 0.96\u20132.60 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. The method also successfully identified quinolone residues in 50 poultry feather samples. The results showed that quinolones can accumulate and stabilize for a certain period of time after transferring from the body to the feathers of poultry.",

            "text": "Quinolones (QNs) are a class of synthetic antibiotics that has developed rapidly. Their compounds contain pyridine keto acid (1,4-dihydro-4-oxypyridine-3-carboxylic acid) as a basic structure with carbonyl, carboxyl and other groups [1]. This class of drug promotes the growth of animals, reduces costs because it prevents and treats the diseases of livestock and aquatic animals, and is widely used in aquaculture as a veterinary medicine and feed additive [2]. However, the massive use of quinolones has resulted in the accumulation of residues in poultry products, which are recycled to the human body and cause various hazards. An excessive intake of quinolones mainly manifests in direct toxic reactions (nausea, vomiting, vertigo, palpitations, and cardiovascular system problems), allergic reactions (skin damage and toxicity due to photodegradation products). Bacterial drug resistance to quinolones has also increased and attracted increasing attention [3]. Molecular mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance were found in a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli that was highly susceptible to nalidixic acid but resistant to fluoroquinolones. China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture issued Announcement No. 2292, which stipulates that the addition and use of four veterinary drugs is prohibited as of 31 December 2016 [4]. Since 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of enrofloxacin for the treatment\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3738. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28093738 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3738 2 of 17\nof bacterial infections in poultry as scientific evidence suggests that Campylobacter-resistant species have emerged in chickens and turkeys treated with antimicrobials [5]. The current detection methods for quinolone residues in livestock and poultry products are mainly focused on the muscles, liver and feces [6\u20139]. In poultry, after the body receives antibiotic treatment, the drug residence time varies in different body parts due to metabolism, and the residual level in tissues immediately falls below the measurable limit; hence, the timeliness of this monitoring method is limited [10]. This phenomenon is known as the paradoxical effect of quinolones: high concentrations of quinolones are less bactericidal. Moreover, the excretion rate of live animals is high, and the detection window of feces is short. Antibiotic residues can only be detected during dosing and for a few days after slaughter [11]. Feathers are often used as a source of waste or cheap protein feed in poultry breeding. The content of residual antibiotics detected in feather powder is higher than that of the conventional matrix [12]. Thus, feathers have been proposed as a substitute sample material for detecting antibiotic residues in a long time window, with the advantages of a stable drug presence, non-invasive nature, convenient transportation, and preservation [13]. Antibiotic residue surveillance is also important and includes early warning functions for the detection of public health events. Increasing needs demand the development of rapid and sensitive techniques for the detection of various antibiotics in trace amounts. Feathers could be an effective target tissue for antibiotic residue detection for an early warning against the presence of antibiotics. However, only a few studies have examined antibiotic residues using poultry feathers as a substrate. Feathers can be used to detect residues of antimicrobial agents because the drug may bioaccumulate in the internal structures of the feathers [14]. The combined structure, the feather primordium, then grows into a filament within a follicle, branches internally, and produces a down feather by hatching. A feather has a hollow tube sac structure, and drugs enter the feather shaft and feather branch through the metabolic power path. The drugs accumulating in feathers are not affected by other tissues, are stable, and can be detected even for a longer time limit when compared with drugs in other tissues of the body [15]. At present, the commonly used detection methods for quinolone residues are high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [16\u201318], an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [19\u201321], and UPLCMS/MS [22\u201324]. ELISA uses highly specific reactions of an antigen and antibody under the catalysis of an enzyme to carry out detection and analysis and has the advantages of good selectivity, strong specificity, and high sensitivity. HPLC is widely used to detect quinolone residues, but some compounds with good thermal stability have a relative shortage of separation and confirmation. UPLC-MS/MS combines the separation function of chromatography with the qualitative function of mass spectrometry. It can realize the qualitative and quantitative analyses of complex mixtures, simplify the pretreatment of samples, and retain the advantages of high selectivity and high sensitivity. UPLC-MS/MS has unique benefits for the separation and identification of compounds with a high boiling point, thermal instability, and poor volatility. These properties make UPLC-MS/MS an important method for quinolone residue detection. Relevant studies have been reported on the analysis of quinolone antibiotic residues in poultry feathers [25\u201327]. D.C. Love et.al. analyzed feather meal (n = 12 samples) for ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin, using EPA method 1694 and employing liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [14]. Larissa J.M. Jansen established a method for the analysis of six QNs in chicken feathers [28]. Apart from these examples, there is little information on the identification of quinolone drug residues in poultry feathers. The overall objective of this study was to establish a simple and effective method for the analysis of quinolone antibiotic residues in poultry feathers as a means of determining the approximate level of drug use in poultry during feeding.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3738 3 of 17"

Common proteases (e.g., trypsin, pepsin, and papain) have difficulty in breaking down feather samples effectively [35]. Enzymatic hydrolysis usually requires hot pressing, which is not conducive to the extraction and detection of target drugs. Acetonitrile can precipitate protein with less interference from impurities, but the coagulation of protein is not conducive to the effective extraction of target substance, resulting in relatively low recovery rate, and quinolones are more stable in a neutral acid environment [36]. Moreover, the enzymatic extraction method was excluded as it is timeconsuming and complicated. The recovery rate of the 0.1% TFA methanol solution in the third and fourth generations of quinolone antibiotics was low. The HCl and NaOH solutions were extracted and purified through a solid-phase extraction column to reduce the adverse effect of acid-base extraction on UPLC. However, generations 3 and 4 of quinolone demonstrated no good retention, resulting in a strong ion-inhibition effect and affecting the sensitivity and accuracy of the quinolone. At the same time, the purification process via extraction column is relatively complicated and time-consuming [37,38]. Based on the recovery rates of several extracts, 1% formic acid-acetonitrile was finally chosen as the extraction solution for quinolones in poultry feathers."

            "text": "The unpurified extract of acidified acetonitrile will lead to a strong matrix effect. Multiple mechanisms of impurity adsorption purification were selected to remove the interference of the matrix after the extraction of acidified acetonitrile to purify and better remove impurities from the extract and to solve the problem of the lengthy analysis time of the column-passing treatment [39]. Multifunction adsorption purification is a newly proposed method based on medium-dispersion solid-phase extraction [40]. Through a variety of functional adsorption materials, the main interfering impurities in the sample are adsorbed to effectively remove phospholipids, fats, and some proteins that may exist in the matrix, whereas the tested substances are left in the sample solution to achieve the purpose of purification and enrichment [24]. Nine adsorbent materials (Table 1) were selected for adsorption purification experiments. The specific experimental steps were as follows. Blank feather samples were obtained. In a 50 mL centrifuge tube, 1 g was accurately weighed, and the appropriate amount of QNs mixed in a standard solution and its internal standard solution was added to create content of 10 mg/kg relative to that in the tissue, which was vortex-mixed well. Then, 30 mL of acetonitrile extraction solution of 1% formic acid was added. After ultrasonic extraction, the solution was centrifuged at 8000 r/min for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred to the reagent bottle. Separately, 2 mL of the supernatant was taken, and 100 mg of nine different adsorbent materials were added and vortex-mixed for 30 s, ultrasonicated for 15 min, and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatant was passed through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter membrane and detected by UPLC-MS/MS. Meanwhile, 2 mL of the extract, without any sorbent material, was aspirated as a blank reference. As shown in Figure 3, C18 and SAX had substrate purification effects, as observed by examining the adsorption and purification effects of the nine different adsorbents on the feather extract. C18 is mainly based on the interaction of nonpolar carbon bonds, which is helpful for the elution and reverse-phase extraction of samples in nonpolar adsorption process. C18 was mainly adsorbed on phospholipids and moderately polar compounds. The sample solution treated with C18 was clearer. SAX is a strong anion exchange extraction adsorbed on anionic substances. The quaternary ammonium group is always in a cationic state; thus, it has a strong anion exchange function and selectively retains anionic organic compounds (such as compounds containing carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups). Therefore, C18 and SAX were selected as candidate materials for further research.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3738 6 of 17\nTable 1.

By adding C18 and SAX in different proportions, that is, when the ratio of SAX to C18 was 2:1, the extracted solution was clarified after adsorption purification, impurities were effectively adsorbed, and the matrix effect of the target compound was greatly reduced. Finally, the two solid adsorbents were mixed, and the mixing ratio was set to 2:1, according to the experiment. At the same time, the amount of adsorbent used was investigated, and the effects of different solid adsorbent dosages (5, 10, 20, 50, 80, and 100 mg) on the purification effect of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3738 7 of 17\nimpurities in 0.1 g feather extract were compared. The results showed that the purification effect of the impurities in the sample was not remarkably improved by continuously increasing the amount of adsorbent when the amount of solid adsorbent reached 50\u201380 mg. Therefore, the amount of adsorbent added was set to 50 mg. When the adsorbent was added for adsorption and purification, the interference substance in the matrix was effectively removed from the chromatographic peak of the substance to be detected, and the damage of impurities to the instrument and chromatographic column was reduced."

In this experiment, the MRM mode of mass spectrometry was used for monitoring, which effectively avoided the interference of impurity ions; at the same time, the internal standard quantification method was used. Therefore, the matrix effect was negligible. The matrix effect was investigated by comparing the results for the QN standard mixture (100 \u00b5g/L) dissolved in a 0.1% formic acid solution in water/methanol (90:10, v/v) and the extracted solution of the noncontaminated duck and chicken samples from different origins and/or different regions. The matrix effect was detected for QNs in duck and chicken feathers (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 10 drugs exhibited a weak signal suppression of 10\u201320%, and the signal suppressions of other drugs were lower than 10%. The duck feathers had a higher ion suppression activity than the chicken feathers. Therefore, due to sample type variability, the content of QNs in feather samples was determined by the IS method, though not all isotopically labeled ISs for each QNs were attained."

Selectivity was analyzed and evaluated by 20 blank feathers, and no interferences from other components were observed near the retention time range of QNs in these feathers [41]. Appropriate amounts of mixed standard solutions with seven different concentration points for each QN were added to prepare a standard series of solutions with mass concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 200 \u00b5g/L and containing 10 ng/mL of the endogenous marker. Under the selected chromatographic and tandem mass spectrometry conditions, the mass concentration (C, \u00b5g/L) of each analyte in the solution was linearly regressed with the MRM peak area A of each analyte. The typical linear regression equation and correlation coefficient (\u03b3) are shown in Table 2, which revealed that the 26 target compounds had good linear relationships within the linear range and the correlation coefficient was not less than 0.992. Ten blank matrix samples of different groups were weighed and determined after being processed through the extraction methods. The detection limit (LOD) was determined according to the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the MRM chromatographic peak, which was greater than 3, and the minimum quantitative limit (LOQ) was determined according to the S/N, which was greater than 10 times. The LOD and LOQ of the 26 target components were 0.12\u20131.31 and 0.96\u20132.60 \u00b5g/kg, respectively.

Two of the chicken feather samples contained ciprofloxacin at 17.13 mg/kg and 12.34 mg/kg, respectively. Eighteen duck feather samples did not contain quinolones. The detection results showed that the quinolone residues in poultry feathers were mainly third-generation quinolone residues, which may be related to the relative stability of the drug ciprofloxacin. In addition, with the rapid development of the scale of livestock farming and the increase in the urban population, the presence of antibiotics in the soil and bodies of water through metabolism poses a serious threat to the health of organisms. Conventional environmental testing relying on machinery, etc., can also serve the purpose. However, compared to biological monitoring, such as through feathers, it lacks bioavailability, and the cumulative effect of antibiotic drugs in organisms cannot be obtained from monitoring data. Changes that are difficult to monitor and difficult to detect can often be more easily monitored using biological means, such as poultry feathers, than physical and chemical means. For poultry, feathers are an important indicator of antibiotic use residues as well as contamination, and feathers have significant advantages over other tissues. The use of feathers meets the principles of conservation of living things, responds to environmentalism, and uses a non-invasive biological material. The feathers are easy to collect and store and can be collected from the same birds without affecting their health. The dangers of antibiotic residues in soil and water cannot be ignored, and conducting these biological studies will allow for a more visual recognition of the threat and a better application of poultry feather monitoring."
