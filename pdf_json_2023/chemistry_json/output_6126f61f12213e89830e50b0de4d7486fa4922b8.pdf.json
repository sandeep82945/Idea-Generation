    "abstractText": "Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the common malignant tumors of the male genitourinary system. Here, we constructed PTX@ZIF-8, which is a metal-organic-framework-encapsulated drug delivery nanoparticle with paclitaxel (PTX) as a model drug, and further modified the synthesized peptide dimer (Di-PEG2000-COOH) onto the surface of PTX@ZIF-8 to prepare a nanotargeted drug delivery system (Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8) for the treatment of prostate cancer. This study investigated the morphology, particle size distribution, zeta potential, drug loading, encapsulation rate, stability, in vitro release behavior, and cytotoxicity of this targeted drug delivery system, and explored the uptake of Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 by human prostate cancer Lncap cells at the in vitro cellular level, as well as the proliferation inhibition and promotion of apoptosis of Lncap cells by the composite nanoparticles. The results suggest that Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8, as a zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8loaded paclitaxel nanoparticle, has promising potential for the treatment of prostate cancer, which may provide a novel strategy for the delivery system targeting prostate cancer.",

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the common malignant tumors of the male genitourinary system, which has become the second most prevalent malignant tumor around the world [1]. Antiandrogen therapy plays an integral role in the treatment of prostate cancer. Orchiectomy is a traditional antiandrogen therapy with low cost, relatively few side effects, and the capacity to rapidly reduce and maintain low levels of testosterone [2]. In the early stage, prostate cancer can be treated surgically, but most prostate cancers are already in the progressive stage at the time of diagnosis, due to the lack of specific symptoms in the early stages of prostate cancer [3], making complete surgical removal of the tumor almost impossible. Also, most patients struggle to accept such a form of treatment. Some hormonal drugs including estrogens, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, androgen biosynthesis inhibitors, and androgen receptor blockers, which can also achieve lower testosterone, but they have significant side effects and, as the disease progresses, almost all patients will no longer be sensitive to androgens and\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1874. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15071874 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1874 2 of 16\ndevelop desmoplastic-resistant prostate cancer [4]. Therefore, the treatment of tumors with anticancer drugs has an irreplaceable place in clinical practice. Chemotherapy is one of the most extensively available methods to combat advanced prostate cancer, but its therapeutic efficacy is often inadequate due to poor specificity and associated toxicity [5]. Known as a broad-spectrum antitumor drug, paclitaxel (PTX) has become the mainstay of chemotherapy for clinical practice, as first- or second-line treatment for several types of cancer [6]. Paclitaxel blocks cell mitosis mainly by inducing microtubule protein polymerization, thus inhibiting proliferation and eventually promoting the apoptosis of tumor cells [7]. However, paclitaxel shows low aqueous solubility [8], poor bioavailability [9], and an inability to effectively differentiate between normal and tumor tissues, thereby suffering from strong adverse effects. To address the challenges of the clinical application of PTX, a large number of studies have been conducted to adopt nanocarriers for targeting delivery to tumor sites, improving pharmacokinetics, and reducing systemic toxicity. Metal-organic framework materials (MOFs), a type of nanocarrier emerging in recent years, are porous materials formed by coordination between organic skeletons and metal ions [10\u201312], with porosity, large specific surface area, and high adsorption properties, thus adopted for the delivery of insoluble drugs. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) is a MOF material with a tetrahedral space structure formed by the N atom in dimethylimidazole linked to the zinc ion through the coordination bond [13,14]. Compared with traditional drug delivery carriers such as liposomes, nanomicelles, and polymeric nanoparticles, ZIF-8 has the advantages of high stability and high encapsulation rate for chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, ZIF-8 is nontoxic and has good biocompatibility and biodegradability [15]. ZIF-8 has the pH-responsive biodegradation property [16], so the adoption of ZIF-8 as a drug delivery carrier ensures stability in blood circulation to avoid toxicity caused by premature drug release, and once entering the tumor cells, it will disintegrate in an acidic endosomal/lysosomal environment for controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, ZIF-8 is selected as a carrier material for chemotherapeutic drugs to construct a tumor precision-targeted drug delivery system, which can achieve the aim of reducing toxicity and increasing efficiency [17]. With the rapid development of proteomics, phage display, and peptide solid-phase synthesis in recent years, more and more novel peptides have been discovered or rationally designed, which greatly facilitate the development of targeted drug delivery systems based on peptides. Compared with the monomer of the peptide, the polypeptide significantly enhances the affinity and specificity with the receptor, with higher targeting efficiency to effectively avoid the off-target effect [18]. Peptide homodimers or multimers are formed by coupling identical types of peptides through suitable linkers [19]. Due to the bivalent effect of homodimers, peptide dimers can obtain a higher receptor affinity for homodimers, better tumor uptake, and longer tumor retention time [20]. Di-peptide, the dimerization of peptides (WQPDTAHHWATL) through the use of a lysine residue at the COOH terminus, was found to exhibit stronger specific affinity for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is highly expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells [21]. Also, Zhang et al. [22] in our lab have also demonstrated the specificity of this peptide for Lncap cells in a previous study. Accordingly, Di-peptide was served as the targeting peptide for the construction of nanodelivery systems targeting prostate cancer with a high affinity for PSMA. In this study, PTX@ZIF-8 nanoparticles were synthesized by the one-pot method, and then Di-PEG-COOH was modified on the surface of PTX@ZIF-8 by positive and negative charge interactions to obtain the targeted metal-organic framework drug delivery system Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8. This study investigated the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in terms of morphology, particle size distribution, zeta potential, drug loading, encapsulation rate, stability, and in vitro release behavior. In addition, the cytotoxicity and uptake of Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 nanoparticles on human prostate cancer Lncap cells were studied at the in vitro cellular level, as well as the promotion of apoptosis and proliferation inhibition of Lncap cells via the composite nanoparticles. It was concluded\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1874 3 of 16\nthat Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 nanoparticles could serve as a drug delivery platform with great potential to treat prostate cancer."

The drug-loaded nanoparticles PTX@ZIF-8 were conjugated with Di-PEGCOOH by the \u201celectrostatic self-assembly method\u201d to obtain Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs, which resulted in the increase of the particle size and the change of the surface charge of the nanoparticles from positive to negative charge. Studies have indicated that nanoparticles with a slight negative charge on their surface contribute to avoiding uptake by non-target tissues and are easy to accumulate in tumors. The morphology of PTX@ZIF-8 (Figure 2C) was observed under transmission electron microscopy as showing angular dodecahedra, while the surface of Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 (Figure 2F) had blunted angles and no longer remained clear dodecahedra, but seemed to be covered with a film, indicating that Di-PEGCOOH had covered the surface of PTX@ZIF-8 through electrostatic interactions to form the Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs.

As illustrated in Figure 7A, normal cells have regular round or oval nuclei, while after treatment with various PTX formulations, the cells appeared to have typical apoptotic-like changes, as shown by chromatin condensation and fragmented nuclei, which displayed dense blue fluorescence after staining. Furthermore, the images demonstrated that the amount of apoptotic-like lesion cells induced by Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 was more than that induced by free PTX and mPEG@PTX@ZIF-8. Subsequently, the Annexin-V/PI double staining method using flow cytometry was employed for further quantitative analysis of cell apoptosis. As shown in Figure 7B,C, the percentages of apoptotic cells in the free PTX, mPEG@PTX@ZIF-8, and Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 group were 33.92 \u00b1 2.334%, 41.17 \u00b1 0.085%, and 56.33 \u00b1 4.594%, respectively. The results established that free PTX, mPEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs, and Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs can effectively induce the late apoptosis of Lncap cells, but the apoptotic rates of mPEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs and Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs were significantly higher than that of the free PTX group (p < 0.01), which was consistent with the tendency of cell proliferation inhibition and also corresponded to the results of cell apoptosis observed under CLSM. Additionally, DiPEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs showed a superior ability to induce apoptosis than mPEG@PTX@ZIF8 NPs, possibly due to the specific binding of Di-peptide to PSMA receptors on the surface of Lncap cells and increasing the internalization of nanoparticles.

Traditional antiandrogen therapy, represented by orchiectomy and hormonal drugs, no longer meets the demand for treatment due to its unacceptability and severe side effects. Meanwhile, the rapid development of drug delivery systems has brought new approaches to the treatment of prostate cancer [24]. For example, Yang et al. [25] developed a dual-targeted nanomedicine (PTX-HMNC-EPEG-APSMA) combining specific molecular targeting and external magnetic targeting into a cooperative delivery system for prostate cancer treatment. In addition, due to high porosity, good drug loading capacity, pH responsiveness, and easy modification, ZIF-8 has gradually become a hot spot for drug delivery system research in recent years. The Zn2+ contained in ZIF-8 may also prevent the growth of prostate cancer [26] and it has been reported that Zn2+ as an adjuvant can enhance the killing effect of PTX on prostate cancer [27]. Furthermore, the specific cancer cell surface antigen PSMA is expressed at 1000-fold higher levels in Lncap cells than in normal cells, and its expression levels increase with disease progression [28]. Therefore, we designed Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs that specifically target the PSMA antigen on the surface of Lncap cells for the treatment of prostate cancer. In terms of the preparation process, Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs can be obtained by a simple one-pot method. Also, the nanoparticles have a suitable particle size distribution and potential, and possess good stability. In vitro release assays have shown that Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs can remain stable in a physiological environment, while rapidly cleaving and releasing the drug in an acidic environment, which means a reduced risk of premature drug leakage and thus fewer toxic side effects. Certainly, the carrier material should have good biocompatibility. The low toxicity of blank ZIF-8 to cells indicates its suitable safety. Due to the modification of peptide\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1874 14 of 16\ndimers, the Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs can specifically recognize the PSMA receptor on the surface of Lncap cells, thus entering the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and exerting cytotoxic effects. Overall, the good characterization and cellular-level therapeutic effects shown by the Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs are encouraging for subsequent animal studies. As the disease progresses, primary prostate cancer leads to a decreased sensitivity to androgens in almost all patients and progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [29]. It has been shown that the androgen signaling pathway plays an important role in prostate cancer progression even at the CRPC stage, and inhibition of the androgen receptor pathway signaling can improve the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs against CRPC [30]. Also, the delivery of siRNAs via ZIF-8 nanoparticles has been extensively studied [31]. Therefore, we expect that the Di-peptide-modified ZIF-8 system can be applied to the co-delivery of the androgen receptor siRNA and chemotherapeutic agents, which is an option for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer."

            "text": "In this study, we constructed novel metal-organic framework nanoparticles loaded with PTX modified with Di-peptide for the targeted treatment of prostate cancer, and evaluated their physicochemical properties and in vitro antitumor effect on Lncap cells. The data showed that Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs possessed appropriate particle size and potential with favorable storage stability. In addition, Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs could remain stable in normal physiological environments, while rapidly cleaving to release drugs by responding to the acidic environment at the tumor site. Also, the carrier material Di-PEG @ZIF-8 did not show any apparent toxicity to cells, and thus displayed a certain degree of safety and biocompatibility. Due to the high affinity of the surface-modified Di-peptide for the PSMA antigen on the surface of Lncap cells, Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs can be highly taken up by the cells and exert significant proliferation-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing effects. Meanwhile, Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 NPs could effectively inhibit the migration and invasion ability of Lncap cells, thus suppressing the tumor metastasis. On the other hand, since Di-peptide has a specific affinity for prostate cancer cells expressing PSMA such as the Lncap cell line, Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 can exhibit the powerful targeting efficiency for all PSMA-positive cell lines and also significantly increase the targeted therapy outcomes for PSMA-positive prostate cancers. In conclusion, our study suggested that Di-PEG@PTX@ZIF-8 could serve as a novel potential drug delivery system to encapsulate PTX or other chemotherapeutic agents for prostate cancer treatment.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.Z., Y.G., Z.G. and W.H.; methodology, H.Z., L.G., H.W., C.L.
