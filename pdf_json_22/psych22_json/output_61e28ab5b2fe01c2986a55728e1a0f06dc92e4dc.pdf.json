    "abstractText": "Neuroimaging studies have revealed that shift work disorder (SWD) affected the functional connectivity in specific brain regions and networks. However, topological disruptions in the structural connectivity of the white matter (WM) networks associated with attention function remain poorly understood. In the current study, we recruited 33 patients with SWD and 29 matched healthy subjects. The attention network test (ANT) was employed to investigate the efficiency of alerting, orienting, and executive control networks. The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was used to construct the WM structural networks. The graph theory analysis was applied to detect the alterations of topological properties of structural networks. Our results showed lower alerting effect and higher executive effect for patients with SWD. Using the link-based analysis, 15 altered connectivity matrices (lower fiber numbers) were found between the two groups. Meanwhile, the graph theoretical analysis showed that the global efficiency and characteristic path length within SWD patients declined in contrast with the healthy controls. Furthermore, a significantly negative correlation was found between the executive effect and global network efficiency. Our findings provide the new insights into the fundamental architecture of interregional structural connectivity underlying attention deficits in SWD, which may be a potential biomarker for SWD.",

However, topological disruptions\nin the structural connectivity of the white matter (WM) networks associated with\nattention function remain poorly understood. In the current study, we recruited 33\npatients with SWD and 29 matched healthy subjects. The attention network test\n(ANT) was employed to investigate the efficiency of alerting, orienting, and executive\ncontrol networks. The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was used to construct\nthe WM structural networks. The graph theory analysis was applied to detect the\nalterations of topological properties of structural networks. Our results showed lower\nalerting effect and higher executive effect for patients with SWD. Using the link-based\nanalysis, 15 altered connectivity matrices (lower fiber numbers) were found between\nthe two groups. Meanwhile, the graph theoretical analysis showed that the global\nefficiency and characteristic path length within SWD patients declined in contrast with the\nhealthy controls. Furthermore, a significantly negative correlation was found between the\nexecutive effect and global network efficiency. Our findings provide the new insights into\nthe fundamental architecture of interregional structural connectivity underlying attention\ndeficits in SWD, which may be a potential biomarker for SWD.\nKeywords: attention, shift work disorder, structural brain network, graph analysis, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)\nINTRODUCTION\nShift work disorder (SWD), involving circadian rhythm disorders, is characterized by the difficulty in falling asleep, sufficient sleep, and daytime fatigue, which result in the altered cognitive performance (1). One study has shown that the exposure duration of shift work was negatively associated with impaired cognition (2). Another study on the effects of shift work nurses on sleep and cognitive function has shown impaired attention for SWD (3). However, the knowledge about underlying mechanisms of the cognitive impairments on SWD is limited.\nAttention network test (ANT), developed by Fan et al. (4), provides an easy way to distinguish three independent attentional components within one integrated task. It is widely used to measure the attentional performance of healthy individuals and mental patients (5\u20137). The ANT study on sleep deprivation has shown an overall slowing of reaction times in the nocturnal session, along with impairments in orientation and executive function (8). However, the abnormal attention on SWD via the ANT is still unknown.\nTo date, numerous studies on functional abnormalities in SWD have been detected via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (9, 10). One study on night shift nurses has shown higher ReHo in the bilateral occipital lobe and left parietal lobe and lower regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the bilateral cerebellar hemisphere in contrast with the day shift nurses (10). Another study on SWD has revealed disrupted functional connectivity between default mode network and sensorimotor network, left frontoparietal network, and salience network (9). Nevertheless, there is no study focusing on structural changes in SWD. The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) opens a window to investigate the brain structural connectivity in vivo (11). In combination with a graph theoretical method, this advanced technique can offer insight into the brain\u2019s structural connection patterns. In recent years, graph theory has been widely used to analyze large-scale brain networks across the whole brain. Previous neuroimaging studies have brought the analysis of structural large-scale brain networks to healthy subjects (12), primary insomnia (13), and so on. One study on patients with depression has revealed the decreased shortest path length and clustering coefficient and increased global and local efficiency (14). Another study on primary insomnia has suggested that the insomnia patients showed increased local efficiency and decreased global efficiency (13). However, to our knowledge, the structural large-scale brain networks on SWD remain unexplored.\nIn the current study, we applied DTI tractography in combination with graph theory to examine the neuroanatomical substrates of the three attention systems measured by ANT in 33 patients with SWD and 29 healthy subjects. First, white matter connectivity, assessed with diffusion tensor imaging deterministic tractography, was modeled as a structural network comprising 148 nodes defined by the Destrieux atlas. Then, we calculated global, local, and regional efficiencies of structural brain networks for each subject. Finally, we conducted the linear regression analyses to investigate the relationship between the network efficiency and the three attentional effects."

All recruited participants were ordered to press a button as accurately and rapidly as possible to determine the direction of the target. Participants were presented with the target and flankers until they made a response or 2,000ms had elapsed. A cue would be presented for 200ms prior to the target. The task used three cue conditions: no cue, center cue, and spatial cue. Each participant completed three blocks in this experiment, each block lasting for 5min and 42 s and consisting of 36 trials, plus two buffer trials at the start. In each block, a total of six trial types were presented in a counterbalanced order. All subjects were trained before the formal experiment. Stimuli were presented, and behavioral responses were recorded using EPrime 2.0 software. Three attention networks were evaluated by calculating ratio scores of alerting, orienting, and EC issues. The formulas were as follows:\nAlerting effect= no cue response \u2013 center cue response. Orienting effect= center cue response \u2013 spatial cue response. Executive effect = incongruent target response \u2013 congruent target response.\nA higher executive effect score reflected a relatively poorer executive function. The total accuracy of each subject was calculated, and those with over 20% error rates should be excluded from this study. The trials with incorrect responses or with response time (RT) longer than 1,500ms or shorter than 200ms were also excluded to avoid the influence of the outliers. The procedure of ANT is shown in Figure 1."

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study exploringWM structural connectivity and associations with ANT in patients with SWD. Our results revealed lower alerting effects and higher executive effects for patients with SWD. Using link-based analysis, significant group differences were found for 15 links. Meanwhile, the graph theoretical analysis showed that the patients with SWD displayed declines on the Eg and Lp in contrast with the healthy controls. Moreover, the Eg value was negatively correlated with the executive effect. This study primarily demonstrated the disrupted WM structural brain networks underlying the abnormal characteristic of ANT in SWD.\nIn our study, we first conducted the comparisons between patients with SWD and healthy controls on efficiency of attentional networks. The lower alerting effects and higher executive effects were found on patients with SWD, which suggested declines in alerting and executive functions. Our results were in line with previous studies. One study on healthcare works showed impaired alertness and performance for night shifts due to circadian misalignment (22). Another study on shift work nurses showed that nurses after working night shifts performed worse concentration and more fatigue compared with after working day shifts (23). Furthermore, it was reported that healthy subjects with mental fatigue impairs pre-attentive processing (24). Hence, we speculated that the fatigue might explain the reasons for declines in alerting and executive functions.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 5 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 802830\nThe results from the link-based analysis showed 15 altered connectivity matrices (lower fiber numbers) in patients with SWD compared with healthy controls. The brain regions of disrupted structural connectivity were mainly involved in the frontal gyrus, putamen, and caudate. The frontal gyrus is known to be responsible for emotion processing, working memory, attention, and executive functions (25). One working memory task-related fMRI study on insomnia patients revealed deactivations in the frontal regions (26). In addition, the resting-state fMRI study on insomnia patients showed decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation values in the right middle frontal gyrus and the left orbitofrontal cortex (27). The putamen and caudate belong to the corpus striatum, which forms multisynaptic loops with cortical regions and is associated with motor, memory, and learning. One study on morphological changes in subcortical structures showed that the volume loss of the putamen was associated with impaired cognitive function in patients with chronic insomnia (28). Another study on patients with depression showed disrupted structural connections between the right orbitofrontal cortex and the right putamen, caudate, and inferior temporal gyrus (14). It is possible that the disrupted structural connectivity between frontal gyrus and subcortical nuclei underlies cognitive impairments in patients with SWD. Moreover, we also found lower structural connectivity between the left proper thalamus and left middle frontal gyrus, between the left proper thalamus\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 802830\nand left postcentral gyrus. The thalamus is recognized to be involved in maintaining alertness and vigilant attention, which is also a key hub of the cortical attention network (29). The study on sleep deprivation revealed increased thalamic activation after total sleep deprivation, which suggested that increased thalamic activation may compensate for the attention in order to complete the task (30). Notably, the more positive connectivity between the thalamus and cortical regions in patients with insomnia was found in comparison with the healthy controls, which also supported the hyperarousal hypothesis (31). In conclusion, these explorative findings may explain the structural connectivity mechanisms underlying the reduced alertness and executive function in patients with SWD.\nThe graph theoretical method of structural networks have indicated the shortest paths between brain regions and high clustering of connections, which balanced between the global integration and local specialization. In line with previous studies on structural and functional networks, our results also showed decline on the Eg and Lp between the two groups, which represented the disrupted small-world organization of the structural brain networks. Global network efficiency mainly\nreflected the capacity for network-wide communication and was regarded as the basis of integrative processing for cognitive functions. Patients with AD (32), primary insomnia (13), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (33, 34) all exhibited a decreased global efficiency of the wholeWMnetworks compared with healthy subjects. Nevertheless, the study on sleep deprivation showed the enhanced small-world property, which suggested a possible compensatory effect on the human brain (35). Moreover, the global network efficiency was negatively correlated with the executive effect, which meant the poorer executive function with the lower global efficiency of WM networks. One study on hypertension patients (36) exhibited the executive function impairment underlying a decreased global efficiency of the WM networks. Another study on healthy subjects (12) also showed a significant negative correlation between global efficiency ofWMbrain network and the executive effect. Hence, we speculated that the declined Eg and Lp may reflect the impaired WM structural network underlying the deficit of attention.\nHowever, there were still some limitations. First, we applied the Destrieux atlas to divide the human brain. However, recent\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 802830\nstudies have shown that higher-spatial-resolution networks of up to 10,240 parcels (37, 38) could supply an increased sensitivity to local properties. Further studies with higher-spatial-resolution networks may help provide more results on local properties. Second, the enrolled patients in our study only included twomale subjects, which failed to analyze the difference in WM structural networks in gender."
