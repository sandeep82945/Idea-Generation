    "abstractText": "In this study, we report the synthesis, characterization, and reactions of Cu(I) complexes of the general form Cu(L)(LigH2) (LigH2 = xanthene-based heterodinucleating ligand (E)-3-(((5-(bis (pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthen-4-yl)imino)methyl)benzene1,2-diol); L = PMe3, PPh3, CN(2,6-Me2C6H3)). New complexes [Cu(PMe3)(LigH2)] and [CuCN(2,6Me2C6H3)(LigH2)] were synthesized by treating [Cu(LigH2)](PF6) with trimethylphosphine and 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide, respectively. These complexes were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and X-ray crystallography. In contrast, attempted reactions of [Cu(LigH2)](PF6) with cyanide or styrene failed to produce isolable crystalline products. Next, the reactivity of these and previously synthesized Cu(I) phosphine and isocyanide complexes with molybdate was interrogated. IR (for isocyanide) and 31P NMR (for PPh3/PMe3) spectroscopy demonstrates the lack of oxidation reactivity. We also describe herein the first example of a structurally characterized multinuclear complex combining both Mo(VI) and Cu(I) metal ions within the same system. The heterobimetallic tetranuclear complex [Cu2Mo2O4(\u03bc2-O)(Lig)2]\u00b7HOSiPh3 was obtained by the reaction of the silylated Mo(VI) precursor (Et4N)(MoO3(OSiPh3)) with LigH2, followed by the addition of [Cu(NCMe)4](PF6). This complex was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography.",

            "text": "Molybdenum-copper carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (Mo-Cu CODH) is an airstable enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of CO to CO2. Mo-Cu CODH is a key enzyme in the metabolism of aerobic carboxidotrophic bacteria (such as Oligotropha carboxidovorans), allowing it to use CO as a sole source of energy and carbon [1]. The oxidation of CO is very efficient, and the enzyme detoxifies a significant fraction of total CO from the atmosphere [2]. Thus, there is a longstanding interest in the design of structural and/or functional models which could (a) provide insight into the reaction mechanism, and (b) lead to efficient CO oxidation and potentially CO2 reduction catalysts. The oxidized active site of Mo-Cu CODH contains square-pyramidal Mo(VI) coordinated to pyranopterindithiolene, [3,4] apical and basal oxo groups, and a basal sulfido bridging to a low-coordinate Cu(I) atom, whose coordination is accomplished by cysteinate and weakly bound water at the resting state (Scheme 1) [5,6]. The reduced active site likely contains Mo(IV)-basal hydroxide in an otherwise similar disposition [7]. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the coordination of CO takes place at the Cu(I) center, replacing weakly bound water [8,9]. Computational studies generally agree with the initial coordination\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3644. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28083644 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3644 2 of 13\nof CO to the coordinatively unsaturated Cu(I) site. However, the subsequent routes differ between different mechanisms, suggesting bridging thiocarbonate or carbon dioxide intermediates [10\u201317]. It is noted that the bridging thiocarbonate hypothesis relies to a large extent on a high-resolution structure of the product of the reaction of Mo-Cu CODH with alkyl isocyanide (CO analog/inhibitor), which undergoes oxidation and insertion into the Cu-S bond to form bridging thiocarbamate [5]. Since the report of the high-resolution structure of the Mo-Cu CODH enzyme, several structural models of Mo-Cu CODH have been reported; in all these models the metals were linked only by bridging sulfido (or oxo and sulfido) ligands [18\u201324]. Although selected closely related structural models were able to rationalize structural, electronic, and spectroscopic features of the active site, only a few have explored the reactivity with CO or CO-like substrates [24]. In our previous work, we explored a different approach toward a more robust functional model of Mo-Cu CODH, which brings two metals together using xanthene-based heterodinucleating ligands [25]. Recently, we have shown that the heterodinucleating ligand LigH2, which combines catecholate chelate for Mo(VI) and dipicolylamine for Cu(I), allows for the formation of mononuclear Cu(I) and Mo(VI) complexes at the designated sites [26]. The combination of LigH2 with both metals forms metastable Mo(VI)-Cu(I) complex (Et4N)[CuMoO3(Lig)] directly observable in solution by 1H NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). However, our attempts to isolate this complex in a solid state and/or study its reactivity were not successful, as it underwent facile decomposition. In the present work, we explore a different approach toward a functional model, which involves the initial formation of well-defined Cu(I) complexes containing an oxidizable CO-like (or related) ligand (CNR, PR3, CN\u2212, olefin), followed by treatment with (Et4N)2[MoO4]. We have also explored a different approach towards stable Mo(VI)-Cu(I) complex that involves the use of a different Mo(VI) precursor (Et4N)[MoO3(OSiPh3)].

These reactions were performed similarly to the previously described synthesis of metastable (Et4N)[CuMoO3(Lig)], [26] suggesting similar incorporation of {MoVIO3} at the initial step of the reaction. Following the addition, the reaction was analyzed by NMR, IR, and UVvis spectroscopy. Treatment of 2(PF6) with one equivalent of (Et4N)2[MoO4] produced yellow-brown solution. The 1H NMR spectrum indicated the formation of several new products. The UV-vis spectrum of the crude product does not appear to contain any d-d transitions anticipated for Cu(II), suggesting that no Cu(I) oxidation takes place. Although we were not able to separate the products, IR spectroscopy provides a convenient tool to specifically interrogate the oxidation of isocyanide to isocyanate. An isocyanate is expected to exhibit an intense absorption between 2200 cm\u22121 and 2300 cm\u22121 (RN=C=O stretch). However, the IR spectrum of the crude product demonstrates a single sharp resonance around 2129 cm\u22121, consistent with the isocyanide stretch in aryl isocyanides (ArN\u2261C) [30].

Thus, the 31P NMR spectrum of the product of the reaction of 3(PF6) with molybdate contains a single peak around \u22123 ppm (free PPh3 is ~\u22126 ppm, PPh3 in 3(PF6) ~3 ppm, P(=O)Ph3 ~28 ppm) whereas the product of the reaction of 4(PF6) with molybdate contains a peak around \u221246 ppm (free PMe3 is ~\u221262 ppm, PMe3 in 4(PF6) ~\u221249 ppm, P(=O)Me3 36 ppm). The findings above are consistent with coordinated phosphines and suggest that no oxidation of phosphines to the corresponding phosphine oxides takes place. The experiments above indicate the lack of in situ reactivity between Cu(I)-bound L (CNR, PR3) and [MoVIO3]2\u2212, and that is despite previously observed in situ nucleophilic attack of [MoVIO3]2\u2212 on the Cu(I)-bound imine [25]. We postulate that the lack of reactivity in the present system is due to the structural difference between the two heterodinucleating ligand systems (Figure 2). The iminopyridine system led to a relatively accessible threecoordinate Cu(I)-iminopyridine which, due to the coordination to the (xanthene-) amine, was positioned in the vicinity of Mo(VI)-oxo (Figure 2, left) [25]. In contrast, the coordination of the substrate to the dipicolylamine-coordinate Cu(I) leaves the metal four-coordinate, making it less accessible for attack. Furthermore, the coordination of the substrate L causes the displacement of the imine coordination which, combined with the more significant steric profile of dipicolylamine (vs. iminopyridine), leads to the anti-conformation of the Cu(I) fragment relative to the xanthene bridge (Figure 2, right). This factor is also likely to have a negative effect on reactivity.\nMolecules 2021, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 13\nThe reactions of the phosphine complexes 3(PF6) and 4(PF6) with molybdate were\ninvestigated similarly.

However, the complex had only limited stability in solution, and could not be obtained in a solid state; therefore, its subsequent reactivity was not investigated. In the present work, we targeted: (1) the in situ reactivity studies combining Lig, Cu(I), Mo(VI), and a potentially oxidizable ligand L (isocyanide, phosphine, cyanide), and (2) a more stable heterodinuclear MoVICuI complex which could be isolated and structurally characterized. Towards the first goal, we have prepared a series of Lig-supported Cu(I)-L complexes, treated them with [MoO4]2\u2212, and explored the nature of the product (L vs. L=O) using the corresponding spectroscopy. For both phosphine and isocyanide substrates, no oxidation was observed.

The diffraction intensities were measured using a Bruker Photon III CPAD area detector. Data were acquired at 100 K with an Oxford 800 Cryostream low-temperature apparatus. The data were processed using APEX4 software (v.2022.10-0, Bruker, Madison, USA). The structures were solved by Intrinsic Phasing using ShelXT [37] and refined with ShelXL [38] using Olex2 [39]. Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions using a standard riding model and refined isotropically; all other atoms were refined anisotropically. The structure of 2(PF6) contained one co-crystallized molecule of diethyl ether. The structure of 6 contained one co-crystallized molecule of HOSiPh3 and six co-crystallized molecules of acetonitrile. In addition, one of the tert-butyl groups of 6 was found to be disordered over two positions. The main refinement parameters are listed in Table 1.
