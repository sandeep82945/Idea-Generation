1. **Investigate the impact of climate change on Somalia's economic growth.** Climate change is a major threat to Somalia's economy, as it is expected to lead to more frequent and severe droughts, floods, and other natural disasters. These disasters can damage infrastructure, disrupt agricultural production, and lead to food shortages. A study could investigate the potential impact of climate change on Somalia's economic growth and identify policies that can help the country adapt to the effects of climate change.


2. **Analyze the role of the informal sector in Somalia's economy.** The informal sector is a large and important part of Somalia's economy, but it is often overlooked by policymakers. A study could investigate the size and scope of the informal sector in Somalia and its contribution to the country's economic growth. The study could also identify policies that can help to support the informal sector and promote its growth.


3. **Examine the impact of remittances on Somalia's economy.** Remittances from Somalis living abroad are a major source of income for many families in Somalia. A study could investigate the impact of remittances on Somalia's economy and identify policies that can help to maximize the benefits of remittances. The study could also examine the potential risks associated with remittances, such as the risk of inflation or the risk that remittances could be used to finance terrorism.


4. **Assess the effectiveness of Somalia's economic development policies.** Somalia has implemented a number of economic development policies in recent years, including policies to promote foreign investment, improve the business climate, and reduce poverty. A study could assess the effectiveness of these policies and identify areas where they can be improved. The study could also make recommendations for new policies that could help to promote economic growth and development in Somalia.


5. **Develop a long-term economic development strategy for Somalia.** Somalia needs a long-term economic development strategy that will help the country to achieve its economic goals. A study could develop such a strategy, taking into account the country's unique challenges and opportunities. The strategy could include policies to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the standard of living for all Somalis.
