    "abstractText": "The roots of Peucedanum japonicum (Apiaceae) have been used as an alternative to the roots of Saposhnikovia divaricata (Apiaceae) to treat common cold-related symptoms in Korea. However, a variety of Peucedanum species, including the roots of P. praeruptorum or Angelica decursiva (=P. decursivum), have been used to treat phlegm\u2013heat-induced symptoms in China. Hence, as there are differences in the medicinal application of P. japonicum roots between Korea and China, chemotaxonomic classification of P. japonicum was evaluated. Sixty samples derived from P. japonicum, P. praeruptorum, A. decursiva, and S. divaricata were phylogenetically identified using DNA barcoding tools, and chemotaxonomic correlations among the samples were evaluated using chromatographic profiling with chemometric analyses. P. japonicum samples were phylogenetically grouped into the same cluster as P. praeruptorum samples, followed by S. divaricata samples at the next cluster level, whereas A. decursiva samples were widely separated from the other species. Moreover, P. japonicum samples showed higher chemical correlations with P. praeruptorum samples or A. decursiva samples, but lower or negative chemical correlations with S. divaricata samples. These results demonstrate that P. japonicum is more genetically and chemically relevant to P. praeruptorum or A. decursiva and, accordingly, the medicinal application of P. japonicum might be closer to the therapeutic category of these two species than that of S. divaricata.",

            "text": "Bang-Pung (Saposhnikoviae Radix), a traditional herbal medicine, has been used to treat common cold-induced disorders and relieve pain, and it originates from the roots of Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk. (Apiaceae) in Korean and Chinese pharmacopieas [1,2]. The roots of Peucedanum japonicum Thunb. (Apiaceae) are exclusively registered as \u201cSik-Bang-Pung\u201d (Peucedani Japonici Radix; \u201cSik\u201d means cultivated) in the Korean herbal pharmacopeia [3]. As the roots of P. japonicum are recognized as an alternative to Bang-Pung (the roots of S. divaricata), it is interesting that two different herbs belonging to two separate genera are used for the same medicinal purpose. Another notable issue is that the plant P. japonicum and its roots are botanically and medicinally named \u201cBin-Hae-Jeon-Ho\u201d (bin hai qian hu; \u201cBin-Hae\u201d means the plant lives near coastal areas), a type of \u201cJeon-Ho\u201d in the Chinese literature [4,5]. Jeon-Ho, a medicinal name of Peucedani Radix, has been used to treat phlegm- and heat-induced respiratory disorders\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27051675 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675 2 of 16\nand it originates from the roots of P. praeruptorum Dunn (Baek-hwa-Jeon-Ho; \u201cBaek-Hwa\u201d means a white flower) or Angelica decursiva (Miq.) Franch. & Sav. (=P. decursivum (Miq.) Maxim.) (Ja-Hwa-Jeon-Ho; \u201cJa-Hwa\u201d refer to a purple flower) [2,3]. Hence, whether the roots of P. japonicum can be used for different therapeutic purposes in Korea and China is controversial. This is because the roots of P. japonicum are used for treatment of common cold-related symptoms in Korea, while different Peucedanum species, including P. japonicum, are currently used to treat phlegm- and heat-induced respiratory symptoms in China [5]. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the roots of P. japonicum for medicinal purposes. Moreover, an investigation of the chemical relationship between P. japonicum and S. divaricata, P. praeruptorum, and A. decursiva can be crucial to estimate the therapeutic efficacy-based medicinal categorization of P. japonicum. There are several types of adulterants still distributed in the market for various reasons, contributing to confusion owing to the differences in origin species depending on the country and morphological similarity, and misunderstandings also originate from common names of plants and their medicinal names. Various research methods have been applied to prevent this confusion. DNA-based genetic analysis is one such approach. This molecular biological research method targeting genomic DNA is not affected by the environment, and the reliability is high because of the clarity and reproducibility of the analyzed results [6]. In previous studies using DNA-based approaches for S. divaricata, P. japonicum, and Glehnia littoralis, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed using the international transcribed spacer (ITS) primer for genomic DNA [7], and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis-based sequence characterized amplified region markers were developed [8]. DNA barcode sequence (ITS and chloroplast DNA region) analysis has also been reported [9]. For Peucedani Radix, several DNA-based approaches, RAPD analysis [10], and ITS nucleotide analysis [11,12] have already been performed. Recently, the chloroplast genome has been used to understand the identities, phylogeny, genetic populations, and evolution of plants using next-generation sequencing [13,14]. These results demonstrated that DNA-based gene differentiation is an efficient and accurate method for applications. Therefore, DNA barcode analysis, comprising ITS combined with four chloroplast DNA regions, was performed for the identification of samples used in this study. Chemotaxonomic classification of the four aforementioned species using the chromatographic profiling method with chemometric analysis is a logical approach to investigate the chemical relationship between P. japonicum and the remaining three species. The chemical classification of S. divaricata and P. japonicum was performed by metabolic profiling analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and multivariate analysis [15]. S. divaricata root and its substitute, P. ledebourielloides root, have previously been distinguished using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometrybased metabolomics [16]. A high-performance liquid chromatography/photodiode array detector was used for the quantitative analysis of the marker compounds and the chemical differentiation between S. divaricata and P. japonicum roots and between A. decursiva and P. praeruptorum roots [17,18]. However, in contrast with diverse genetic studies, no studies have investigated the chemotaxonomic relationship between P. japonicum, S. divaricata, P. praeruptorum, and A. decursiva. Moreover, the P. japonicum, S. divaricata, P. praeruptorum, and A. decursiva samples used in the aforementioned articles were limited in their chemical analysis and were not apparently authenticated at the species level. The genetic authentication-based chromatographic profiling method is an emerging technique that is mainly performed by DNA-barcoding hyphenated chromatographic analysis. The combined method provides species-level accuracy of herbal samples, and therefore, a more reliable classification of those samples can be acquired by chemical analysis [19]. This technique has been applied to the chemical classification of diverse herbal medicines, such as Arnebia [20], Fritillaria [21], Phellodendron [22], and Daphne [23] species. Our group has also previously developed a \u2018genetic authentication-based chromatographic\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675 3 of 16\nprofiling\u2019 method for chemically distinguishing between Atractylodes species and Amomum species, using ITS sequencing, HPLC analysis, and chemometrics [24\u201326]. In this research, we collected samples of the aforementioned four species and confirmed their genetic authentication using ITS sequence-based DNA barcoding analysis to establish the chemotaxonomic relevance of P. japonicum (PJ), S. divaricata (SD), P. praeruptorum (PP), and A. decursiva (AD). Thereafter, chemical profiling of the samples was carried out using an HPLC\u2013diode array detector (HPLC\u2013DAD) and chemotaxonomic classification was performed by chemometric analysis."

Internal Transcribed Spacer Regions of Nuclear Ribosomal Cistron\nThe nucleotide sequences of the ITS (ITS1, ITS2, include 5.8 s) were used for identification of the species of distributed Peucedani Radix, Peucedami Japonici radix and Saposhnikoviae Radix. Around 689\u2013693 bp amplified nucleotide sequences were determined, based on the samples listed in Tables 1 and 2. The determined sequences were confirmed using the Blast in NCBI GenBank data. In total, 44 site differences were observed among the four species shown in Tables 1 and 2 (Table 3). A difference in 37 sites was observed between two species of Peucedani Radix (PJ and AD) with a 0.94 sequence identity matrix (Table S1). The two same genus samples, PP and PJ, had 16 site differences (sequence identity matrix 0.975; Table S1). SD and PJ had nine different sites (sequence identity matrix 0.986; Table S1). The results indicated that the ITS could be used as a clear and useful tool to identify the species of medicinal herbs in Tables 1 and 2.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675 4 of 16\n\u2018-\u2019: unknown.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675 5 of 16\n2.2. Chloroplast Genome-Based DNA Barcode Sequence Analysis\nFour chloroplast DNA barcode regions (rbcL, marK, psbA-trnH, and trnL-F intergenic spacer) were analyzed to supplement the results of the ITS. The psbA-trnH region had the most variable sites among the four plastid barcode regions (except the ITS region). On the other hand, the trnL-F intergenic spacer was the most conserved region among all of the analyzed DNA barcode regions (including ITS). Although four analyzed plastid loci had less abundant variable sites and were highly conserved compared to the ITS region, it could be useful to separate the species used in this study. To obtain more detail, a 390F/1326R primer set was used to amplify the matK, and the 933-base partial nucleotide sequences were determined. The total number of variable sites was 13; however, some of them were highly conserved. In particular, there were only two site differences between PP and PJ. Nevertheless, matK could distinguish four species sufficiently. For the rbcL with a rbcL a-f/724R primer set, 670-base partial nucleotide sequences were determined in all samples listed in Tables 1 and 2. Six variable sites were found, which was a well-conserved region among the five DNA barcode regions. The sequence identity matrix of rbcL was 0.992\u20131.000. In the rbcL region, PP and PJ showed identical nucleotide sequences (sequence identity matrix 1, Supplementary Materials Table S1). Except for this case, other species could be identified by comparing rbcL nucleotide sequences. The psbA-trnH with a trnH2/psbAF primer set showed different lengths of amplified product dependent on the species, and around 311\u2013345 base partial nucleotide sequences were determined. The psbA-trnH had the shortest aligned length among the five DNA barcode regions but showed the most variable sites (17) among the four chloroplast barcode regions, and had several indel sequences. Therefore, the sequence identity matrix ranged from 0.904 to 0.944. Between PP and PJ, the closest result was 0.944. A trnL-e/trnL-f primer set was used for the trnL-F intergenic spacer, and 444-base nucleotide sequences were identified. As mentioned earlier, the trnL-F intergenic spacer was the most conserved region, and the sequence identity matrix ranged from 0.99 to 1.00. Four variable sites were observed in AD alone, and the other three species showed the same sequence. A single region chloroplast DNA barcode analysis approach and be inaccurate in determining the species\u2019 identity. Therefore, the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL)-Plant working group also recommends two- or more locus combinations to initiate the barcode process for plant species. The recommended standard combination locus is rbcL-matK, because this combination is a practical solution to the complex balance between universality, sequence quality classification, and cost. [27]. However, this combination is not always efficient and, in this case, three- or more locus analyses are necessary. Therefore, the psbA-trnH and trnL-F intergenic spacer regions were additionally selected for analysis in this study. Both loci were quite short, which suggests that they could practically be used for the analysis of processed distributed samples. Unfortunately, the trnL-F intergenic spacer regions of the four species shown in Tables 1 and 2 were highly conserved. In contrast, the psbA-trnH is already known as one of the most variable genome segments in the angiosperm chloroplasts. As expected, it had most variable sites in this study, but it also had many indel sequences. Therefore, single-locus analysis was not efficient.\n2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis\nTo analyze the genetic relationship among the four species used in this study, the PhyML + SMS (Maximum likelihood-based inference of phylogenetic trees with Smart Model Selection) program was performed with concatenated nucleotide sequences of ITS and four chloroplast DNA barcodes. Four species commonly located in the Selineae tribe of the Apiacae family are clustered into two groups, genus Angelica and genus Peucedanum (including genus Saposhnikovia) (Figure 1). The results of genetic flexibility analysis of the four species show that PP and PJ are very close. Comparing the results with the plants of\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675 6 of 16\ngenus Peucedanum, PP and PJ, shows that they are not only the same genus, but genetically closer to other species. AD is located in the genus Angelica group and is relatively far in genetic distance compared to the other three species.Molecules 2022, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 17\n2.4.

Positive and higher coefficient (r) values between the PJ and the AD samples indicate a stronger inter-species correlation, as compared with the weaker inter-species correlation between the PJ and the PP samples, with lower r values. Negative and weaker r values between the PJ and the SD samples indicated that their inter-species similarity was lower than those with positive r values [30,31]. The chemotaxonomic classification of PJ, PP, AD, and SD samples based on phylogenetic authentication was successfully evaluated using chromatographic profiling combined with chemometric analysis, and their chemical characteristics were clearly reflected by their own species. The chemical correlation between PJ and the other three species was also investigated, and it was observed that PJ had a strong chemical relationship with PP and AD, depending on the measured chemometric analyses; however, its chemical relationship with SD was less or even negligible. As the therapeutic activity of herbal medicines can possibly be explained by their chemical constituents, the chemotaxonomic closeness between PJ and PP or AD might provide evidence for their analogous medicinal application to reduce phlegm and heatinduced respiratory symptoms. Meanwhile, the chemotaxonomic distance between PJ and SD presumably indicates their therapeutic dissimilarity with respect to relieving common cold-induced disorders. Further pharmacological and clinical studies are required to confirm these chemotaxonomic results. Nonetheless, there are a few limitations to this study, as follows: (1) sample numbers for AD or SD were insufficient, mainly owing to difficulties in collecting genuine species; (2) intra-species chemical variation in SD samples was prominent, presumably owing to diverse habitats [32,33], and this could be caused by environmental factors, including temperature, dryness/humidity, rainfall, soil conditions, and altitude, which definitely affect the production of secondary metabolites in herbal plants [34\u201336]; (3) insufficient research on chemical classifications among the aforementioned four species."

Sixteen samples of PJ, twenty-seven samples of PP, seven samples of AD, and ten samples of SD were collected from agricultural plantations, natural habitats, and markets in Korea and China, and were also supplied by the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (Table 1). The collected samples were morphologically authenticated by the authors (J.H. Kim and G. Lee). For genetic identification, 20 additional voucher samples were used as standard reference samples (Table 2). All voucher specimens (code No. PNUKM-2021PJ01\u2013PJ16, PP01\u2013PP27, AD01\u2013AD07, and SD01\u2013SD10) and extracted genomic DNA were deposited at the herbarium of the College of Korean Medicine in Wonkwang University and at the School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University.\n3.2. Preparation of Genomic DNA\nA NucleoSpin\u00ae Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) with PL1 lysis buffer was used to extract the genomic DNA of the samples in Tables 1 and 2. Some samples\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675 12 of 16\nrequired extra steps to treat 10% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide with 0.7 M NaCl added to remove high levels of phenolic compounds and/or polysaccharides.\n3.3. PCR Amplification for DNA Barcode Analysis\nFor DNA barcode analysis, PCR amplification was performed using a T-personal cycler (Biometra, Jena, Germany). Briefly, 1X AccuPower\u00ae GoldHotStart Taq PCR PreMix (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) with 600 nM primer set and 30 ng of genomic DNA were used for each PCR amplification. The primer set ITS1 (5\u2032-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3\u2032) and ITS4 (5\u2032-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3\u2032) [37] were used to amplify the ITS include 5.8 s.

The amplified products were separated and confirmed by electrophoresis by using 1.5% agarose gel added with Safe-ViewTM (abm, Richmond, VA, Canada).\n3.4. Determination of DNA Sequences of PCR Product\nAll of the PCR products were sub-cloned after being separated from agarose gels by use of a TOPcloner\u2122 TA Kit (Enzynomics, Daejeon, Korea). The DNA sequences were then determined through an interpretation performed by Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). To improve the accuracy of the results, the DNA barcode analysis was repeated three times, independently from the genomic DNA extraction stage.\n3.5. Analysis of DNA Sequences and Preparation of Dendrogram\nThe determined DNA sequences were first analyzed using Bioedit\u2019s ClustalW multiple sequence alignment (Bioedit, v7.0.9; available from http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/ page2.html, accessed on 28 November 2021) and reconfirmed with multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT (MAFFT, v7; available from https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/, accessed on 29 November 2021) [42]. To confirm the polymorphism represented by IUPAC symbols, all sequences were identified at least twice using a chromatogram of nucleotide sequences provided by the Bioneer sequencing service. The phylogenetic tree for the ITS region was analyzed using MAFFT (multiple alignment, v7.407_1), BMGE (alignment curation, v.1.12_1) [43] and PhyML (tree inference based on the maximum-likelihood, v.3.1_1) [44,45] workflow (PhyML/OneClick, available from https://ngphylogeny.fr/, accessed on 3 December 2021). Phylogenetic analysis of the combined five DNA barcodes (ITS and four plastid regions) was followed by the PhyML+SMS/OneClick method, which was performed in accordance with MAFFT, BMGE, and PhyML+SMS (maximum likelihood-based inference of phylogenetic trees with Smart Model Selection, available from https://ngphylogeny.fr/, accessed on 8 December 2021) [46]. All sequence results completed in the analysis were compared and confirmed with the NCBI GenBank using Blast [47]. The reference data ITS nucleotide sequences for analysis of the genetic relationships comes from NCBI Genbank and were represented by the accession number in phylogenetic tree. The Chloroplast barcode data were also collected from NCBI Genbank, including MT671397.1, NC033344.1, OL362112.1, MW436378.1, MW820164.1, MW900177.1, MT921980.1, MT921.997, and KX352468.1. Two species, Eryngium planum (EU169002, EU0706969, MT561039.1) and Sanicula canadensis (EU070746.1, KP642834.1, KP643255.1, KJ773865.1), were used as the outgroup [48].\n3.6. Preparation of Samples for HPLC Analysis\nThe pulverized PJ, SD, PP, and AD samples were homogenized using a 500 \u00b5m testing sieve (Chunggyesanggong-sa; Gunpo, Gyeonggi, Korea). The extraction was performed\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675 13 of 16\nusing a powder of 500 mg with 5 mL of methanol using an ultrasonic extractor (Power Sonic 520; Hwashin Tech, Daegu, Korea) for 30 min. The extract, filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m syringe filter (BioFact, Daejeon, Korea), was evaporated using a nitrogen-blowing concentrator (MGS2200; Eyela, Miyagi, Japan) and was re-dissolved in HPLC-grade methanol at a concentration of 20,000 \u00b5g/mL prior to HPLC injection.\n3.7. HPLC Conditions for Chromatographic Profiling\nChromatographic analysis was performed using an Agilent 1200 liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies; Palo Alto, CA, USA) consisting of an autosampler, degasser, solvent pump, and DAD. Data were processed using ChemStation (Agilent Technologies). The chemical constituents, including 13 marker compounds, were separated on a Capcell Pak Mg II C18 column (4.6 mm \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u00b5m; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) at 35 \u25e6C with 1 mL/min flow rate and 10 \u00b5L injection volume. The mobile phase consisted of water containing 0.1% TFA (A) and acetonitrile (B), with the following gradient elution: 15% (B) over 0\u20132 min, 15\u201350% (B) over 2\u201330 min, 50% (B) over 30\u201332 min, 50\u201375% (B) over 32\u201355 min, 75% (B) over 55\u201358 min, and then re-equilibrated to 15% (B) until the end of the analysis. Detection was performed using a UV detector at wavelengths of 235, 250, 275, 300, 310, 325, 335, and 350 nm. The precision of the analytical methods was determined by analyzing the retention times and absolute areas of selected peaks of PJ samples within one day (intraday precision) and over three consecutive days (interday precision). Precision was represented as relative standard deviations (RSDs), where RSD (%) = ((standard deviation/mean value) \u00d7 100).\n3.8. Chemometric Statistical Analysis\nThe genetically identified samples of PJ, PP, AD, and SD were analyzed using HPLC, and the chemical relationship between the samples was evaluated using chemometric tools, that is, principal component analysis, k-means cluster analysis, and Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis. In total, 100 peaks were selected as profiling peaks, which were >1.0% of the total peak area. Sixty samples and the absolute area of each profiling peak were used as a matrix for construction of the PC plot, the k-means cluster plot, and for the calculation of Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. The difference between the absolute area of each peak from the samples of independent species was evaluated using Tukey\u2019s test, with significance at p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001. Chemometric analyses and Tukey\u2019s test were conducted using the open source software R (v. 4.1.2; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing)."

The results from the phylogenetic analysis-hyphenated chemotaxonomic correlation suggested the transfer of PJ from SD to the category of PP or AD for medicinal applications. Further pharmacological and clinical study would be necessary to support the chemical re-categorization of PJ.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded online, Figure S1: Chromatograms of the samples of Peucedanum japonicum, P. praeruptorum, Angelica decursiva, and Saposhnikovia divaricata; Figure S2: Multiple comparison of absolute peak areas among the samples; Figure S3: Silhouette plot; Figures S4\u2013S7: Average Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients among the samples; Table S1: Sequence identity matrix; Table S2: Retention times and detection wavelengths of profiling peaks; Table S3: Precision of profiling peaks; Table S4: Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients among the samples.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1675 14 of 16\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.-H.K., E.-J.D. and G.L.; data curation, J.-H.K., E.-J.D. and G.L.; methodology, J.-H.K., E.-J.D. and G.L.; supervision, G.L.; visualization, J.-H.K. and E.-J.D.; writing\u2014original draft, J.-H.K. and E.-J.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.-H.K., E.-J.D. and G.L.
