    "abstractText": "Background Dentists started to follow the era of using single-shade resin composite restorations to avoid color shade selection. Our study was done to evaluate and compare the color stability of two single-shade resin composite materials. Methods Sixty samples were randomly allocated into two main groups (n = 30) according to the composite resin used: Group O: (Omnichroma) samples and Group V: (Venus Peral) samples. Each group was then divided into two subgroups (n = 15): group O1 and V1: samples immersed in coffee. Group O2 and V2: samples immersed in distilled water. Color changes (\u0394E) and roughness values (Ra) were evaluated at baseline, first, and 14 days of immersion. The color change was assessed using Vita Easyshade V, while surface roughness was assessed using a profilometer and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Data were collected and statistically analyzed using two-way variance analysis (ANOVA) and Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test (p < 0.05). Results Group O1 and V1 recorded the highest \u0394E00 (P = 0.002, 0.0001, respectively) and Ra values (P < 0.001) with no significant difference between both materials at 14 days. Conclusion Single shade resin composite with innovative chromatic material technology has dramatic color change and surface roughness that sacrifice esthetic success.",

Dentists have recently preferred ceramic and resin-containing restorative materials [2] based on their esthetic and biological properties [3]. The Esthetic successes of dental resin composite restorations depend primarily on their surface properties and color stability.\nUsing nanotechnology in dentistry, manufacturers are now introducing resin composite materials with singleshade systems instead of more complex color systems. These materials have color harmony with tooth structure due to their nanofillers and nanocluster content. Recently, single-shade resin composite, which can be used for all tooth shades, has been introduced to the dentist\u2019s use. The advantage of its color-matching ability is that it eliminates the need for a shade-taking procedure. It reduces composite inventory, minimizing chair *Correspondence: Raghda Kamh Raghda-kamh@eru.edu.eg 1 Conservative Dentistry, Al-Ahram Canadian University, Fourth Industrial Zones, Giza, Egypt 2 Conservative Dentistry, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt 3 Conservative Dentistry, Egyptian Russian University, Cairo, Egypt\ntime for the patient and the wastage of unused composite shades [4].\nComposite resins\u2019 color stability and surface roughness are essential for esthetic success [5]. Color changes have been associated with diet, chemical reactions, water absorption, and poor oral hygiene [5]. Consumption of certain beverages may affect the esthetic and physical properties of the resin composite, thereby destabilization the quality of restorations [6]. Beverages such as coffee, tea, cola, and wine cause different degrees of discoloration of resinous restorative materials [4]. It was reported that a surface roughness value below 0.15\u00a0\u03bcm. Decreases the adhesion of streptococcus mutans, while when this value is above 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm creates an accessible retention area for the attachment of the bacterial plaque [7].\nIn order to assess the color stability of restorative materials, many instrumental techniques could be used, such as; Digital cameras, Spectrophotometers, or colorimeters. Evaluating (\u0394E) is referred to Commission International De L\u2019\u00e9clairage (CIE) system [4].\nSurface roughness is considered one of the reasons for exterior discoloration [8]. Wear of dental resin composites denoting debonding of inorganic fillers from the resin matrix, which leaves voids, increasing the surface roughness and forming a surface susceptible to exterior stain [8]. Mechanical and Optical profilometers, SEM (scanning electron microscope), and AFM (atomic force microscope) are widely used devices to measure and evaluate the surface roughness of restorative materials. Dental experts preferred profilometers as no preparation is required on samples to measure surface roughness, and repeated measurements are enabled [9]. Moreover, AFM obtains high-resolution 3D nanometric images for the material surface, offering complete surface quantification [10].\nOur study examines the color stability and surface roughness of innovative chromatic resin composite after exposing them to commonly consumed beverages and coffee for 14\u00a0days using Vita Easyshade V, a contact stylus profilometer, and AFM. The null hypothesis was that there was no difference in the \u0394E and Ra of both singleshade composite resins after immersing in coffee for 14\u00a0days."

A Teflon mold and copper ring were fabricated with 2\u00a0mm thickness and 20\u00a0mm diameter with a centralized hole of (6\u00a0mm diameter and 2\u00a0mm thickness) in which the resin composite was bulk packed as one increment [4].\nAccording to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, the resin composite materials were dispensed, manipulated, and polymerized. A nylon thread was incorporated into the specimen before polymerization to allow their easy handling and their suspension in the immersion solutions during all aging periods. The resin composite was bulk packed inside the central hole of the split Teflon ring. To ensure that specimens would have flat polymerized surfaces free of bubble formation after curing, both top and bottom surfaces were covered with transparent polyester matrix strips (TOR VM, Moscow, Russia) and a microscopic glass slide (1\u00a0mm thickness) [4].\nSpecimens were polymerized for 20\u00a0 s on both surfaces (top and bottom) using a light-emitting diode unit (LED COXO DB-686 MOCHA) through the glass slide and the polyester matrix strip. LED light curing unit was used in standardized mode, emitting 1200mW/cm2 irradiance as measured with a radiometer (Kerr manufacturing product). Then the two wings of the ring were opened to remove the specimens. The dimensions of the specimens were checked with a caliper (Pirmadent Germany SS). All samples were finished and polished using Sof-Lex disks (three-step system), starting with medium grit, then fine grit, and finally superfine grit, all in a dry media for 15\u00a0s. Then rinsing and drying with a water/air syringe for a total of 6\u00a0s [11]. Specimens were stored in distilled water in tight vials for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0 C before the immersion procedures in the incubator [4].\nTest solution preparation With each type of resin composite, the 30 specimens were randomly allocated into two subgroups (n= 15 per subgroup), according to the immersion solution to be investigated. The two immersion solutions used were: distilled water (control solution) and coffee. The coffee solution was prepared by adding 3.6\u00a0 g of coffee using a digital spoon scale to 300\u00a0ml distilled water, then boiling for 10\u00a0min to have a standardized concentration [12]. Filter paper was used to remove any impurities of the prepared coffee before being poured into vials and left to be cooled. Specimens\nwere immersed through suspension with the nylon thread of 5\u00a0ml immersion solution. The immersion solutions were changed daily till the last assessment period. After placing specimens, the vial was sealed tightly with its cap to prevent any evaporation of the immersion solutions [4]. The containers were stored at 37\u00a0\u00b0C by placing them in a thermal control unit.After each storage period, the specimens were removed from immersion solutions and allowed to dry before color assessments. Then after assessments, the identical specimens were stored again in the vials containing daily fresh solutions for the following storage period [4].\nColor measurements testing Color shade assessment using Commission International de L\u2019Eclainge (CIELab) color system (L*, a* and b* values) at baseline before immersion, after one day, and after 14\u00a0 days by digital spectrometer device Vita Easyshade V (VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad S\u00e4ckingen, Germany). It is a portable spectrophotometer and a new fifth generation of Easyshade with a handpiece of fiber optic probe assembly for illuminating and receiving the reflected light from the sample. Results appear through a LED screen. The base unit has the calibration block into which the handpiece is seated. The Easyshade handpiece has a 5\u00a0mm diameter stainless steel probe [13]. measurements by Vita Easyshade started with a calibration process that was performed per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions [13]. The probe was perpendicular to the recorded specimen before pressing the measurement on, and the results were displayed. According to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions, two successive measurements were done and reported for each sample [13].\nColor difference (\u0394E\u221700) values were calculated using the following formula CIEDE2000 for each specimen against white backgrounds [14]:\nThe L * value represents the lightness of an object where the value of zero equals a perfect black while the value of 100 represents a perfect reflecting diffuser. The a* value is a degree of redness of the color (positive a*; + 80) or its greenness (negative a*; \u2212 80). Finally, the b* value counts for the degree of yellowness (positive b*; + 80) or its blueness (negative b*; \u2212 80). The smaller the \u0394E00, the lower the color change between the initial color measurement and the final color of the tooth. The perceptibility threshold (\u0394E00) was 0.8 whereas the 50:50% acceptability threshold (\u0394E00) was 1.8 [14].\nSurface roughness testing The surface roughness of the materials was tested using a contact stylus profilometer\nE00 L \u2217 1,a \u2217 1, b \u2217 1;L \u2217 2,a \u2217 2, b \u2217 2 = E 12 00 = E00\n(SJ- 210 Surface roughness tester Mitutyoyo Japan). Each specimen was fitted to the specimen holder, where the surface was to be measured in the horizontal direction; then, the specimen holder moved in a vertical direction up to the specimen surface, touching the measuring tip.

Recently, many manufacturers introduced a new single-shade resin composite as it has the advantage of reducing chair time and\nshade selection time [15]. Moreover, it was reported that any discoloration in the resin composite would affect the aesthetic [16, 17]. Hence, the current study presented the problems of color stability of resin composite after exposure to commonly consumed drinks of different storage periods. The null hypothesis in this study was rejected due to statistically significant differences in color and surface roughness values of both resin composite materials before and after immersion at evaluation with the Vita easy shade, profilometer, and AFM.\nThe color stability and surface characteristics of the two single-shade resin composites depend on the different compositions, fillers, particle size, and distributed resin matrix. A commercially available supra-nanofiller resin composite (omnichroma) was compared against a nanohybrid resin composite (Venus pearl). Nanotechnology applications introduced in the fillers size range within 0.1- 100\u00a0 nm to improve properties [18]. Studies evaluating the stability of single structured resin composite severely need more to assert its chemical performance. It was stated that details of the fabrication conditions for the organic filler distributed inside the Omnichroma resin could be more precise [19].\nThe esthetic and mechanical properties of resin composite are influenced not only by their chemical composition but also by the environment to which they are exposed such as chemical agents found in saliva, foods, and beverages either intermittently or continuously.

It is worth mentioning that artificial saliva and distilled water have the same effect on resin composite [22].\nIn this study, each step was made to standardize the methodology; the specimens\u2019 thickness of 2\u00a0mm for the light cure unit, and the curing time was adjusted to 40\u00a0s with 20\u00a0s exposure time for the top and 20\u00a0s for the bottom, respectively [23], miller strip and the standardized finishing and polishing procedures. Specimens were immersed in distilled water for 24\u00a0h before immersion in the tested solutions to complete polymerization [16].\nIn the current in-vitro study, a static immersion was done for all specimens for one day and 14\u00a0 days, equivalent to one month and 14\u00a0 months of consumption, respectively [16]. The increase in temperature will accelerate color change in the restoration [24]; specimens were incubated to adjust the temperature at 37\u00b0c all the storage time to simulate the oral environment. Coffee was replaced with a new proportion every 24\u00a0h to minimize bacterial growth.\nVisual perception of color is a psychological point-view and, unfortunately, depends on the observer\u2019s skill [21].\nIn order to overcome the problem of visual assessment of the color, many color-evaluating devices have been used as Colorimeters and Spectrophotometers that are more precise than the naked eye [21]. Color assessments in our study were done using a digital spectrometer device, Vita Easyshade V. This device is considered a reliable tool to measure the color change not only in clinical applications but also for research purposes in evaluating color interactions of human teeth and dental materials [25].\nColor measurement is usually done by using the CIELAB color system [14]. CIE L*a*b system is prevalent,\nproviding a standardized technique with helpful analysis of \u0394E* values accurately. This system can define small color changes accurately and have many advantages, including objectivity, repeatability, and sensitivity [21]. Selecting the CIEDE 2000 color difference formula (\u0394E00) that was used in this study as it could create a calculation of single-number shade pass or fail in evaluating minor to medium color discrepancies that are more sensitive than the previous CIE L*a*b system.\nSurface roughness refers to the finer irregularities of the surface texture that refers to the action of the production\nprocess or the material\u2019s features [8]. Currently, several available methods are present to measure the surface texture of any material, including contact stylus tracing, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Contact stylus tracing was used in the current study because it was fast, simple, and reliable for the comparative assessment of surface roughness properties of both tested single-shade composite resins [26]. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a technique for analyzing the topography of the surface. It is an effective technique for characterizing nanoparticles and nanomaterials because it offers qualitative and quantitative information on several physical properties such as size, shape, surface texture, and roughness with a demonstrating image for any surface type, including polymers, ceramics, composites, glass, and biological materials [27]. Regarding color stability, the specimens immersed in the coffee solution reported a more significant color change when compared to the specimens immersed in distilled water. This result could be due to the adsorption and absorption of the yellow stains, which have low polarity. This low polarity of yellow stain can penetrate\ndeeper layers of resin composite [21], in agreement with many studies [4, 16].\u00a0On the opposite side, a study found an acceptable color change after immersion in coffee for 48\u00a0h E < 3.3; this may be due to differences in immersion solution preparation methods and concentration [28].\nPerceptibility and acceptability thresholds determine if a color variation is perceptible and whether it is acceptable or not. The current study\u2019s perceptibility threshold (\u0394E00) was set at 0.8. In contrast, the 50:50% acceptability threshold (\u0394E00) was 1.8 [14]. In our study, it was clear that the perceptibility threshold values for all groups were higher than 0.8, as shown in Table\u00a0 2 and Fig.\u00a0 1.\nMoreover, the acceptability threshold values were higher than 1.8 after 14\u00a0days for all groups.\nGroup O2 and V2 demonstrated unacceptable color change after 14\u00a0 days of immersion in distilled water which was consistent with a study that had an unacceptable color change of resin composite after immersion in distilled water for five days [21]. Moreover, it has been reported that the water absorption of composite resins reaches its highest level in 7\u201360\u00a0days [16]. In contrast to Farah and Elwi, who found that immersion in distilled water for seven days resulted in imperceptible color changes (\u0394E \u2264 1) [29].\nNanohybrid (Venus Pearl) composite was more color unstable than nano-filled composite (Omnichroma). According to the data provided by the manufacturer (Kulzer GmbH) who claimed that, Venus Pearl with novel low shrinkage composition of tricyclodecane (TCD)-urethane monomer, which is characterized by big molecular size that demonstrate good chemical stability [3]. Nanohybrid (Venus Pearl) contains tricyclodecane TCD urethane-based monomer, giving high resistance to discoloration [3]. But lower filler content and presence of nanoclusters could be the reason for the less color resistance in comparison to the nanofilled resin composite (Omnichroma) [8, 9].\nBoth resin composite materials exhibited statistically significant difference behavior regarding surface roughness at baseline. The O groups showed superior surface smoothness than the V groups, which could be related to the smaller filler size 4 and higher filler loading [30], as mentioned in Table\u00a0 1. After one day, groups O2 and V2 were significantly the lowest, followed by group O1. While group V2 was significantly the highest. After 14\u00a0days, groups O1 and V1 were significantly the highest. At the same time, Group O2 and V2 were significantly the lowest.\nA strong and positive correlation between color stability and surface roughness results, as mentioned in (Table\u00a05) was cleared by the ATF images. It was explained by both resin composite materials\u2019 structure and chemical composition. Based on the fact that composite resins with smaller filler sizes exhibit smoother surface properties [31] and less color change [4].\nThe mean color values and surface roughness after 14\u00a0 days were the highest for both Groups O1 and V1. It could be due to increased interaction between the resin and the chemicals. More water penetration inside the resin with staining substances of the coffee solution occurred. These conclusions agree with many previous studies [4, 9, 16, 21].\nIt was stated that when inorganic fillers deboned from the resin matrix, this may leave voids, resulting in surface roughness, forming a surface susceptible to external stains [8, 32]. Additionally, the resin matrix plays an essential role in staining susceptibility [21, 33, 34]. Many studies stated that the ability of resin composite to discolor depends on the resin matrix\u2019s hydrophilicity and the material\u2019s ability to absorb water [32, 35]. Both materials have a matrix composition based on triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA). It was reported that TEGDMA monomer is responsible for color change due to high water absorption and increased coloration [4, 16]. In agreement with a study where the most color\nchange was related to the nanofilled single shade resin composite (Omnichroma) after immersion in coffee for one day in comparison to multi-shade resin composite that could be due to TEGDMA in its composition [4]. Different opposite studies\u2019 findings stated no correlation between color and roughness [36].\nAlthough the present study confirmed the detrimental effects of tested solutions on single-shade resin composite material, our study has several limitations. Similarly to other in\u00a0 vitro studies, there are factors affecting the restorations in the oral cavity: microbiota, saliva circulation, temperature, and pH changes. Therefore, the oral cavity could not be imitated precisely [16]."
