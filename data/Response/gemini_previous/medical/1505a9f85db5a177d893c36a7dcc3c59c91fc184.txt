1. **Investigate the use of RGB-D SLAM algorithms specifically designed for forest environments.** This could involve developing new algorithms or modifying existing ones to better account for the unique challenges of forest environments, such as the homogeneous color and texture of trees and the presence of dense understory vegetation.


2. **Explore the use of post-processing techniques to reduce the effect of misalignment error in RGB-D point clouds.** This could involve developing new algorithms or modifying existing ones to identify and correct misaligned points, either automatically or manually.


3. **Investigate the use of RGB-D devices with extended capture ranges.** This could involve using active projection RGB-D sensors with longer range capabilities or using passive triangulation RGB-D sensors with larger fields of view.


4. **Explore the use of RGB-D devices for the measurement of other forest attributes, such as stem taper, sweep, and height.** This could involve developing new algorithms or modifying existing ones to extract these attributes from RGB-D point clouds.


5. **Conduct a comprehensive inter-comparison of current and emerging low-cost RGB-D devices for forest measurement tasks.** This could involve developing a standardized testing protocol and comparing the performance of different devices in a variety of forest environments.
