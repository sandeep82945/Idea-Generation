    "abstractText": "Cisplatin-type covalent chemotherapeutics are a cornerstone of modern medicinal oncology. However, these drugs remain encumbered with dose-limiting side effects and are susceptible to innate and acquired resistance. The bulk of platinum anticancer research has focused on Cisplatin and its derivatives. Here, we take inspiration from the design of platinum complexes and ligands used successfully with other metals to create six novel complexes. Herein, the synthesis, characterization, DNA binding affinities, and lipophilicity of a series of non-traditional organometallic Pt(II)-complexes are described. These complexes have a basic [Pt(PL)(AL)]Cl2 molecular formula which incorporates either 2-pyrrolidin-2-ylpyridine, 2-(1H-Imidazol-2-yl)pyridine, or 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole as the PL; the AL is resolved diaminocyclohexane. Precursor [Pt(PL)(Cl)2] complexes were also characterized for comparison. While the cytotoxicity and DNA binding properties of the three precursors were unexceptional, the corresponding [Pt(PL)(AL)] complexes were promising; they exhibited different DNA binding interactions compared with Cisplatin but with similar, if not slightly better, cytotoxicity results. Complexes with 2-pyrrolidin-2-ylpyridine or 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole ligands had similar DNA binding properties to those with 2-(1H-Imidazol-2-yl)pyridine ligands but were not as cytotoxic to all cell lines. The variation in activity between cell lines was remarkable and resulted in significant selectivity indices in MCF10A and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, compared with previously described similar Pt(II) complexes such as 56MESS.",

While prevention may reduce the burden of cancer by up to 50% [3,4], safer, more effective, and affordable treatment options are required to reduce premature death in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) [4]. Improved therapies are necessary to address the challenges faced by advanced-stage cancer patients who often receive poor prognoses [5\u20137]. The burden of cancer has significant repercussions on both the broader societal and economic landscapes, even in cases where cancer enters remission [8,9]. Platinum(II)-based chemotherapy drugs, most commonly Cisplatin, Oxaliplatin, and Carboplatin, are used globally. However, many cancers are resistant to these drugs, and they have significant side effects, which can necessitate reduced doses, causing suboptimal outcomes [1,10,11].

Prior research studies by our group have centered on non-traditional structures of platinum complexes (PCs) with promising results [14,15]. Specifically, the example [(5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(1S,2S-diaminocyclohexane)platinum(II)] dichloride (56MESS) has received warranted research interest [16\u201319]. This non-traditional PC is of the type [Pt(PL)(AL)]2+ where PL is a polyaromatic ligand and AL is an ancillary ligand, usually diaminocyclohexane. The unique design of 56MESS and similar complexes has resulted in their mechanism being distinct from Cisplatin. Moreover, 56MESS and its derivatives elicit anti-proliferative effects against Cisplatin-resistant KRAS-mutated cells [20,21]. Many of these examples are significantly more potent than Cisplatin in 2D cell culture studies, have increased stability when oxidized to platinum(IV), and have improved selectivity indices in breast cancer cell lines [15,22]. In this study, we present a new series of unconventional PCs and assess their anticancer potential. These complexes exhibit a similar structure to 56MESS, [Pt(PL)(AL)]2+; however, the PL is a pyridine derivative, while the AL remains as chiral resolved diaminocyclohexane (Figure 1). The ligands investigated here have been used previously to probe the anticancer activity of Cu, Ru, Os, Pt, and Pd complexes [23\u201326]. These ligands, however, are yet to be used in a Pt(II) complex context where the pyridine ligand is bidentate and has a second chiral diaminocyclohexane ligand. It is hypothesized that pyridine derivatives influence complex solubility and cell permeability as well as affect reactivity toward different biomolecules through hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, and intercalation [25\u201327].

Further, UV data were used to calculate the molar absorption coefficient for each complex at two wavelengths. Molar absorption coefficients were calculated by titrating increasing concentrations of a complex and measuring the UV spectra of each increment. The six complexes have relatively low absorption in water and few real peaks in their spectra. Despite this, the extinction coefficients were successfully calculated with good agreement between the three repetitions (Supplementary Materials, Figures S28\u2013S33).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17150 6 of 13\nLipophilicity was calculated using RP-HPLC. A stock solution of each PC was injected at different isocratic ratios ranging from 70\u201390% solvent B (organic) at a flow rate of 1 mL\u00b7min\u22121 [32\u201334]. The complexes have low solubility in water, often requiring DMSO to make concentrated solutions. Yet the LogK\u2019 calculated using these experimental data indicated high lipophilicity, which is typical for 2+ charged complexes. Further experimentation found that these complexes show only an initial resistance to dissolution; they require time or heat to dissolve fully. When heat was applied, they would not precipitate out of the solution after cooling. This confirmed that a lack of persistence was the cause of the \u201cobserved\u201d low solubility in H2O. This suggests that these complexes have low waters of hydration when synthesized using the above method and thus take longer to dissolve than previous 56MESS-derived complexes that typically had high waters of hydration. In the context of Pt(II) anticancer agents, the complexes noted in this study are more lipophilic than comparable drugs in the literature. Their increased lipophilicity may indicate they have the potential to be administered orally, a characteristic usually associated with Pt(IV) complexes. Other factors, such as stability and cellular absorption, would need to be considered before the potential of these Pt(II) anticancer agents could be evaluated."

            "text": "The DNA binding capacity of PCs 1\u20136 was assessed using fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) experiments. To achieve this, the fluorescent signal of a DNA intercalator, in this case, ethidium bromide (EtBr), is measured as increasing concentrations of PC are added. As the PC displaces the EtBr, the fluorescence of the mixture is diminished, and the DNA binding capacity of the complex can be calculated from the fluorescence measurement. Calf-thymus DNA (ctDNA) was used and saturated with EtBr. The change in fluorescence is monitored as the complex is titrated into this solution. Once the decrease in fluorescence plateaued, the titration was ended. Experiments were performed in triplicate for each PC, and the DNA binding capacity is summarised in Table 2.\nThe results show that greater molar equivalence is needed to displace EtBr for complexes 1\u20133 than for 4\u20136. The fluorescence plateaued using fewer equivalents for 4\u20136 and resulted in a greater total change in fluorescence, indicating that these PCs were able to displace more EtBr than precursors 1\u20133. Therefore, the PCs are much stronger binders, as is additionally evident through the Ka and KSV values. The cytotoxicity of 1\u20136 was assessed using MTT assays that were undertaken in several different cell lines, including a non-cancerous cell line. The resulting GI50 values (Table 3) demonstrated that 5a/b and 6a have a similar if slightly improved, activity to Cisplatin in all cell lines tested. Surprisingly, the RR complex 6b did not have the same activity, with GI50 values increased by a factor of ten compared with its SS counterpart, 6a. Precursor complexes 1\u20133 did not have impressive cytotoxicity values, although they are somewhat\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17150 7 of 13\ncomparable with the cytotoxicity of Carboplatin. Their development may not be worth pursuing further due to their similarity to conventional Pt(II) complexes, which are known to be cross-resistant. Complexes 4a/b were also disappointing, with GI50 values in a similar range to the precursor complexes. Interestingly, 4a/b showed the greatest variation in activity between the 12 cell lines, suggesting that these could be used to create more targeted complexes. Complexes 4a/b and 6b also have higher selectivity indices than 5a/b and 6a, which further indicates their potential as useful tools for targeted therapies. In comparison, published anticancer agents containing similar ligands have not achieved such low GI50 values. For example, ruthenium complexes with piano chair benzimidazole motifs produced, at best, GI50 values of 11\u201319 \u00b5M in MCF-7 cells and 26\u201338 \u00b5M in A2780 cells [27]. Platinum complexes that similarly coordinate imidazole produced modest cytotoxicity with the best results between 17.5 and 58.8 \u00b5M in the cell lines tested, although no direct cell line comparisons were available [24,28]. The results of complexes from the literature are comparable with precursors 1\u20133 and less effective compared with complexes 4\u20136. We can, therefore, confirm that the design has improved the cytotoxicity of this family of ligands, and this improvement validates our drug design. This may be due to the increased lipophilicity of these complexes compared with other platinum derivatives or because they are designed for intercalation rather than covalent DNA binding.\nThe cytotoxicity correlates with the DNA binding affinity where 1\u20133 have the lowest DNA binding capacity and are less cytotoxic compared with complexes 4\u20136. Complex 6b is the exception, which, although it has moderate DNA binding properties, was significantly less cytotoxic. This suggests that DNA binding may contribute to the mechanism of action of these PCs, although other properties may hinder DNA binding capacity in vitro, thus reducing their cytotoxicity. Overall, the binding and cytotoxicity results show PCs 5\u20136 are the most promising and can be used as a scaffold for Pt(IV) prodrugs, while PCs 4a/b may be best utilized in Pt(IV) drugs designed for targeting to utilize their significantly increased potency in breast, brain and pancreatic cancer cells compared with the other cell lines tested."

The dead zero volume time was determined using potassium iodide as an external dead volume marker, with further details in the Supplementary Materials. The subsequent peaks were recorded, and K was calculated using Equation (6).\nK = tr \u2212 t0\nt0 (6)\nwhere K is the capacity factor, tr is the retention time of the analyte, and t0 is the dead time determined using a solution of KI in the same column. At least five different isocratic ratios were used to assess each PC, and each experiment was repeated three times. LogK\u2019 was then calculated and plotted against the concentration of ACN in the mobile phase. The resulting linear fits of these data were then used to calculate LogKw, expressed by Equation (7).\nLogK\u2032 = S\u03d5 + LogKw (7)\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17150 11 of 13\nwhere S is the slope, \u03d5 is the concentration of ACN in the mobile phase, and LogKw represents the capacity factor of the compound in 100% water (Figure S49). CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. The instrument was left to equilibrate for approximately 30 min, flushing the lamp with nitrogen prior to use. Spectra were obtained in a quartz cell with a 10 mm path length and were measured from 400\u2013200 nm with a data pitch of 1 nm, bandwidth of 1 nm, and response time of 1 s. For each spectrum of each PC, 40 accumulations were collected, and a water baseline was subtracted. Additionally, the spectra were smoothed using OriginPro (version 2023B) at nine points of smoothing."

            "text": "Six novel complexes, along with three precursors, were successfully synthesized and characterized. While the precursor complexes 1\u20133 showed significantly less DNA binding capacity and were less cytotoxic, the characterization of complexes 4\u20136a/b highlighted their potential as pharmaceutical leads. The six unconventional PCs retained the chirality of the diaminocyclohexane used in their synthesis, and each demonstrated good lipophilic properties; this attribute is critical for development into effective pharmaceuticals. Although all have similar DNA binding properties, PCs 5a/b and 6a were far more cytotoxic, with GI50 values superior to that of Cisplatin, although by only a small margin. In contrast, complexes 4a/b and 6b were not as cytotoxic but showed far greater variation in cytotoxicity between cell lines and revealed better selectivity indices. While not as promising as possible general anticancer agents, complexes 4a/b and 6b may have success when utilized in targeted therapies. Overall, the synthesis of these PCs is uncomplicated and produces structures with favorable initial pharmaceutical properties. These promising unconventional platinum complexes can be further derivatized and tailored to help identify effective and affordable cancer treatment options.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms242417150/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, data curation and writing\u2014original draft preparation, B.S.M.; investigation, B.S.M., J.S. and J.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, supervision and project administration, C.P.G. and J.R.A.-W.
