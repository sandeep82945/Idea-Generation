            "text": "Brain metastases (BM) are diagnosed in 40% to 70% of patients with metastatic NSCLC, during the course of the disease.1\u20133 Historically, BM were associated with poor overall survival and low quality of life (QoL).4,5 Nevertheless, owing to the introduction of targeted therapies for patients with an oncogenic driver and immune checkpoint inhibitors for most of the other patients, the overall survival probability of patients with NSCLC is increasing.1,6\nThroughout almost all disease stages, the screening for asymptomatic BM is advised in NSCLC guidelines, except for patients in a (very) early disease stage as the risk of BM is low in these stages.7\u20139 The two main reasons for screening are to adjust therapy if asymptomatic BM are detected in those with extracranial localized disease or to select the optimal treatment strategy in those with metastasized disease. In the former, this implies either oligometastatic treatment or switch from radical-intent therapy to palliative therapy. In the latter, a choice has to be made between upfront local BM treatment and systemic therapy followed by local treatment on (symptomatic) BM progression.10 Furthermore, regular brain imaging during follow-up is advised in patients at high risk of BM, to have a possibility to treat BM before they become symptomatic.9,11\nPrevious studies revealed that a diagnosis of BM, subsequently needing treatment with radiotherapy, has\na profound impact on patients and may cause feelings of anxiety or fear of dying, loss of control, impaired cognition, or changes in personality.12 Similar results were found for patients with a primary brain tumor diagnosis and their spouses.13 Nevertheless, it is not yet known whether this is also the case in asymptomatic BM. It has been found that follow-up scans (not specifically evaluated for brain imaging) may also have a negative impact on the QoL as these can induce feelings of scanassociated anxiety (scanxiety).14,15 It is not known whether this also accounts for the follow-up with brain imaging.\nEggen et al.16 report that anxiety for dying in patients with NSCLC and BM (N \u00bc 78, 53% with BM) is common but not necessarily attributed to the BM diagnosis. Nevertheless, the patients included in this study were diagnosed with symptomatic BM making it difficult to extrapolate the results to patients with asymptomatic BM. Currently, there is only limited understanding in how asymptomatic BM affect the psychological wellbeing and perceived QoL of patients and their relatives. More insight helps to obtain directions to optimize postdiagnostic psychological support and shared decision making with patients for whom there are conflicting data whether BM screening is necessary. Therefore, this qualitative study used focus group discussions to investigate the perspective of patients. In addition, the perspectives of their family members or close friends were explored."

In case no data saturation was established after these focus group sessions, an extra focus group would be organized.\nThe focus group was held in a meeting room in the hospital, in a quiet setting. Each focus group started with a 15-minute welcome in which participants completed a short questionnaire on sociodemographics (i.e., marital status, having children, and highest received education). Subsequently, predefined questions were asked on the feelings (fears and anxiety) about having BM, the impact of having BM versus other metastases, experience with imaging and scanxiety, and the use of coping strategies.

According to the patients, the diagnosis of NSCLC had a profound impact and caused feelings of distress and anxiety. Some patients felt that the accompanying diagnosis of BM intensified the experienced anxiety.\nTable 1.

Some patients described that their glass is always half-full, whereas others felt it was half-empty. This influenced how they coped with feelings of distress in daily life.\n\u201cI try to live in the moment and plan fun activities as much as possible. Sometimes I even take advantage of my disease. For example, when there is a concert and I can get a better seat because of my disease.\u201d Female, age 59 years, ALK translocation\n\u201cI simply can\u2019t accept the diagnosis and can\u2019t deal with it. (.). I worry about it a lot, especially at night. I\u2019m afraid for what the future will bring.\u201d Male, age 74 years, EGFR mutation\nThere was a wide variety of coping strategies used by the patients, their need for information, and preferences regarding shared decision making. Some placed all their trust in their treating physician and did not want to discuss treatment options (i.e., they did not prefer shared decision making). Others searched for detailed information on the internet and expressed that they liked to ask a lot of questions during medical consultation.\n\u201cI want a short consult and do not have many questions.\u201d Male, age 66 years, EGFR mutation\n\u201cWhen I go to the doctor\u2019s office, often with my whole family, it is an active consult where we address many of our questions.\u201d Female, age 61 years, EGFR mutation\nAnxiety caused by having BM seemed related to the time between the diagnosis of BM and participation in the focus groups. More specifically, patients with a short interval experienced more feelings of distress and anxiety compared with patients who had a longer interval between the diagnosis of BM and effective treatment and participation in the focus groups.\n\u201cIn the beginning I experienced anxiety about the possible symptoms that may develop due to the BM. Later, these feelings changed and I felt less worried because I can still do everything.\u201d Female, age 70 years, EGFR mutation\nCoping of the participating relatives also depended on their personality and need for information. The participating partners and close friends experienced difficulty with coping owing to the uncertainty that accompanied the NSCLC and BM prognosis. For example, they experienced that this had changed their future perspective and limited their ability to make plans for the future. Some described that the best strategy to cope with the uncertainty was to live by the day.\n\u201cIt feels like were are living with a time bomb.\u201d Female, age 63 years, EGFR mutation\nImpact of Imaging to Screen for and to Follow Up BM. All patients expressed a strong preference for regular imaging to screen for new or progressing BM, even if this could lead to the discovery of new BM, whereas local treatment of these BM is not always necessary. They experienced that not knowing about new BM is worse.\n\u201cEven though the local therapy did not start immediately and I did not have any symptoms of the discovered BM, I would still want to know that I have BM.\u201d Female, age 72 years, BRAF V600E\nAll patients considered imaging of the brain with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan as burdensome.\nThey felt that these scans take a long time to be performed while they need to lie very still. Sometimes, this led to physical complaints, such as a back pain. Despite the burden, most patients perceived that it is worth it because an MRI is more sensitive in diagnosing BM compared with a computed tomography (CT) scan. Only one patient felt that it is less important to diagnose the small BM.\n\u201cJust lie down, close your eyes and focus on something else or think about fun stuff.\u201d Female, age 70 years, ALK translocation\nThe patients did not express a preference about the interval of the follow-up imaging of the brain.\n\u201cHow often and when imaging should be done has to be decided by the physician.\u201d Male, age 75 years, ALK translocation\nDifference Between Having BM Versus Having Metastases at Other Sites. Most patients did not feel more distressed about BM compared with having other metastases. The experienced level of distress was linked to having relatives with specific types of cancer (including sites of metastases causing complaints) or other neurologic problems.\n\u201cMy niece died at a young age due to a brain tumor. So I was not that happy when I heard about the diagnosis of BM.\u201d Female, age 63 years, EGFR mutation\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of developing dementia. My neighbor had dementia and this is a doomsday scenario.\u201d Male, age 75 years, ALK translocation\nSome patients experienced more fear for disabling constraints of symptoms caused by other metastases. For example, one patient was more concerned of becoming paralyzed owing to bone lesions than feeling anxious for possible cognitive decline. Other participants also felt more afraid of symptomatic metastases in other places, such as bone metastases.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of bone metastases in the vertebra because you can get paralyzed. I\u2019m\ncertainly not waiting for that.\u201d Female, age 63 years, EGFR mutation\nInvolvement of Family and Friends. According to most patients, they had informed family and friends about the NSCLC diagnosis and the BM. Mostly, family and friends had not responded differently to the NSCLC or BM diagnosis. Especially, the first time after the diagnosis, family and friends reacted shocked and were supportive. According to most participants, the high level of involvement and support diminished over time.\n\u201cWe told everybody about the diagnosis. In the first months family and friends were very involved. However, over time their involvement diminished.\u201d Male, age 66 years, EGFR mutation\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a profound impact on the involvement of family and friends. The last focus group was organized during the pandemic (after it was allowed according to the local COVID-19 measures). The patients told that they had isolated themselves because they feared getting COVID19. Although they kept in contact with family and friends by means of telephone or digitally, some experienced feelings of loneliness.\n\u201cI experience a lot of support from close family and would receive daily text messages. However, I deliberately keep social distance to protect myself for COVID-19. At times, this is very lonely.\u201d Male, age 74 years, EGFR mutation\nThe participating family and close friends reported this as well. They told that giving and receiving support was challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also experienced it as difficult and impersonal to bring bad news by means of the phone or digitally. They missed the real-life and physical contact with family and friends.\nAfter the focus groups, some family and friends clearly expressed to highly appreciate having contact with peers during the focus groups. This was especially attributed to the feeling that they could openly talk about their experiences without having to weigh every word because the patients were not present. They also felt that there is only limited recognition for the psychological impact of lung cancer and BM on the involved relatives and friends."

            "text": "The results of this study reveal that a diagnosis of asymptomatic BM leads to feelings of distress and anxiety in patients and close relatives and friends, especially, in an early stage after the diagnosis. Most patients did not perceive the diagnosis of BM as more distressful compared with the diagnosis of other metastases. Although most patients experienced MRI as burdensome, most preferred MRI over CT scan. They attributed this to the sensitivity of the MRI in detecting BM. Patients did not express a preference for the timing of follow-up imaging and felt that it was up to the oncologist to decide. Our findings also indicate that patients and their close family or friends can use a wide variety of coping strategies and have diverse needs for information and shared decision making. This appeared to be related to their personality but also to the stage in the disease process. At first, family and friends often reacted shocked about the diagnosis of lung cancer and BM and were very supportive. Nevertheless, according to most participants, their high level of involvement and support diminished over time. The close relatives who participated in the focus groups experienced that there was only limited psychological support for themselves.\nAnxiety and distress are common in patients with metastatic cancer. Nevertheless, as far as we know, there is no knowledge about the impact of asymptomatic BM in patients with NSCLC on levels of anxiety and distress. A previous study by Eggen et al.16 (a cross-sectional pilot study with questionnaires and neuropsychological testing) revealed that death anxiety was reported in 43% of the participating patients with metastasized NSCLC (n \u00bc 78, 53% BM, all symptomatic). These levels of anxiety did not differ between the patients with and without BM; however, these were all patients with BMrelated symptoms.16 Furthermore, a study by Cordes et al.12 using the validated National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, comparing patients with BM from different solid tumors treated by radiotherapy, with patients with breast cancer without cranial involvement receiving adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy, revealed that the course of distress, anxiety, and depression did not differ significantly between those groups (p \u00bc 0.029). Our study reveals that the experienced levels of distress caused by BM were particularly evident after receiving the BM diagnosis but diminished over time, especially after nonprogressive disease owing to effective systemic therapy.\nOur study also provides unique insight in \u201cscanxiety\u201d and burden experienced by patients with metastatic NSCLC. Previous research revealed that approximately\nhalf of the patients with advanced cancer (n \u00bc 222) experience feelings of scanxiety.19 Our findings confirm that an MRI is experienced as more burdensome compared with a CT or positron emission tomographyCT scan because an MRI is accompanied by psychological and physical side effects (such as claustrophobia or scan-related noise) that adversely affect the scan experience.20 Nevertheless, similar to earlier findings of Bui et al.,21 (a qualitative study with semistructured interviews; 16 participants) our study reveals that most patients accepted this as part of the treatment trajectory. Most patients felt that especially waiting for the results of the scan was stressful. Our study also reveals that despite the burden most patients preferred an MRI because it is more sensitive in detecting BM compared with other imaging techniques.22\nThis study also allows insight in the psychological impact of BM versus metastases at other sites. Most patients did not experience more feelings of anxiety or distress owing to the BM. In contrary, some patients felt that the disabling consequences of other metastases were more frightening than the possibility of cognitive decline caused by BM. These findings correspond with earlier research of Ecclestone et al.,23 who revealed that patients with breast cancer and BM experienced a higher QoL versus patients with bone metastases (n \u00bc 174, 12 patients with BM).\nA unique element of this study is that it also allowed an exploration of the experiences and perspectives of close family and friends of patients with BM. These family and friends appreciated the focus groups and experienced it as a form of peer support contact. They deliberately stated to miss professional psychological support during the course of the disease. It is known that providing informal care to patients with cancer can be stressful, demanding, and burdensome.24 Providing informal care can inflict emotional, social, physical, financial, and spiritual strain on the involved relatives.25 The well-being of family and friends is important because stress in informal caregivers may also cause higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients.26 Therefore, the identification and management of caregiver burden are important considerations for a comprehensive cancer care program.\nFocus groups are frequently used in health research and allow a detailed understanding in the experiences of the participants by means of active discussion.27,28 The method promotes self-disclosure by enhancing group interaction, and this can help participants in sharing their views and attitudes.28 A possible disadvantage of focus group methodology is that participants may provide socially desirable answers instead of expressing an honest opinion. For example, participants\ncould hesitate to express thoughts that oppose the views of other participants. One-on-one interviews could overcome this limitation and could have aided to further deepen the findings of this study. A second limitation is that most of the included patients had an oncogenic driver mutation and were receiving systemic treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Overall, these patients have a better prognosis than patients with stage IV NSCLC without a driver mutation.29,30 This may have biased our findings as our results reveal that nonprogressive patients experienced less anxiety and distress. These results could have been different for patients without an oncogenic driver. Nevertheless, as incidence of BM is high in patients with an oncogenic driver, we think that our results are important.1 Furthermore, screening in the follow-up is often advised for this subgroup of patients, adding even more value to our results.11\nA third limitation includes the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. During local COVID-19 restrictions, the last focus group was organized later than anticipated. The advantage is that it provided us with the opportunity to explore how patients experienced that period, although this was not an aim of the study.\nPatients with NSCLC with asymptomatic BM experience high levels of anxiety and distress after receiving a BM diagnosis. The experienced levels of anxiety and distress diminish over time, especially when they have a nonprogressive disease trajectory owing to effective systemic treatment. Although most patients experience follow-up screening by MRI as burdensome, they accept this as part of the treatment trajectory and even prefer the MRI because of its better sensitivity. Another important conclusion is that the participating family and friends experienced the focus group as a psychosocial support, which is often lacking in daily care. In conclusion, from a patient perspective, the BM screening advice in clinical guidelines is supported, but in future clinical practice, more attention should be paid to psychological support, also for close relatives."
