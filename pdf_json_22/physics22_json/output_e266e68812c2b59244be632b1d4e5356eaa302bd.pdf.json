The study of moire\u0301 materials has so far been limited to structures comprising no more than a few vdW sheets, since a moire\u0301 pattern localized to a single two-dimensional interface is generally assumed to be incapable of appreciably modifying the properties of a bulk threedimensional crystal. Layered semimetals such as graphite offer a unique platform to challenge this paradigm, owing to distinctive properties arising from their nearly-compensated electron and hole bulk doping. Here, we perform transport measurements of dual-gated devices constructed by slightly rotating a monolayer graphene sheet atop a thin bulk graphite crystal. We find that the moire\u0301 potential transforms the electronic properties of the entire bulk graphitic thin film. At zero and small magnetic fields, transport is mediated by a combination of gate-tunable moire\u0301 and graphite surface states, as well as coexisting semimetallic bulk states that do not respond to gating. At high field, the moire\u0301 potential hybridizes with the graphitic bulk states owing to the unique properties of the two lowest Landau bands of graphite. These Landau bands facilitate the formation of a single quasi\u2013two-dimensional hybrid structure in which the moire\u0301 and bulk graphite states are inextricably mixed. Our results establish twisted graphene-graphite as the first in a new class of mixed-dimensional moire\u0301 materials.\nTwisting two sheets of monolayer graphene by a small angle results in the formation of a long-wavelength moire\u0301 potential that substantially alters the low-energy bands [3, 4]. The moire\u0301 bands become extremely flat and isolated near the \u201cmagic angle\u201d of approximately 1.1\u25e6, generating an array of strongly correlated states including magnetism and superconductivity [1, 2, 5\u20138].\nMoire\u0301 flat bands also form upon incorporating additional graphene sheets into the structure, recently observed in the magic-angle trilayer/tetralayer/pentalayer family [9\u2013 13] as well as in twisted monolayer-bilayer [14\u201317] and bilayer-bilayer graphene [18\u201322]. So far, the study of twisted graphene structures has mostly been limited to those assembled from monolayer and bilayer graphene building blocks, since thicker Bernal-stacked constituents contribute additional bands at low energy. Band structure modeling indicates that moire\u0301 bands are likely to persist to arbitrarily thick Bernal graphite structures, but remain localized at the twisted interface and coexist with conventional bulk graphite bands [23]. Moire\u0301 surface states have been observed previously in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments performed on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite with a rotationally faulted surface sheet [24]. However, it is currently not know whether and how these moire\u0301 surface states impact the electronic properties of the entire bulk graphitic thin film.\nHere, we investigate the transport properties of graphitic structures with a moire\u0301 interface created by a single rotational fault within the crystal. We primarily focus on the case where the moire\u0301 potential is localized to one surface of the structure, achieved by rotating a flake of monolayer graphene by a small twist angle atop a Bernal graphite thin film. We also compare to the case where the moire\u0301 interface is buried at the center of the graphitic structure. We show that a single two-dimensional moire\u0301 interface can strongly modify the properties of the entire graphitic thin film, owing to a number of unique properties arising from its semimetallic nature. At zero and small magnetic fields, we find that the electronic transport can be well approximated by parallel contributions of gate-induced surface accumulation layers and intrinsic bulk states. In the case where the twisted interface is located at an outer surface of the sample, the transport properties are dominated by moire\u0301 surface bands and differ considerably from Bernal graphite. At high magnetic fields, the moire\u0301 and bulk states become inextricably mixed by a standing wave ar X iv :2 21 1. 15 60\n6v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 8\nN ov\n2 02\n2\n2\nformed along the c-axis of graphite. The entire graphitic thin film becomes quasi\u2013two-dimensional in this regime, forming a novel mixed-dimensional moire\u0301 system.\nComparison of transport in Bernal and moire\u0301 graphite\nWe focus our study primarily on twisted graphenegraphite (i.e., t1+Z, where 1 indicates monolayer graphene and Z corresponds to the number of graphene sheets in the bulk thin film). We measure devices with graphite thickness varying from Z = 6 to 40 layers, and with twist angles between \u03b8 = 0.84\u25e6 and 1.31\u25e6. These\nstructures are encapsulated between flakes of boron nitride (BN), and capped by additional graphite flakes acting as top and bottom gates (see Methods for additional details). All transport measurements are performed at a base temperature of 1.7 K, unless otherwise noted. We first compare the transport properties of Bernal graphite with a representative twisted graphene-graphite device. Figure 1 shows this for the case of a 23-layer Bernal graphite device and a t1+10 device with \u03b8 = 0.84\u25e6. A schematic of the Bernal graphite device is shown in Fig. 1a, with top and bottom gate voltages denoted as Vt\n3\nand Vb, respectively.\nThe color map in Fig. 1b shows the longitudinal resistance, Rxx, of the device at zero magnetic field as a function of the voltage on both gates (each gate voltage is normalized by the corresponding BN dielectric thickness). The resistance changes by only a few ohms with gating, consistent with the expectation that the gates are only able to dope the outer few layers of the nearest graphite surface due to screening in the bulk. Consequentially, the primary resistance features we observe evolve either vertically or horizontally in the map. Although the resistance map exhibits fine structure that we do not fully understand, we find that transport is very similar upon sweeping each gate with the other held fixed. This behavior is anticipated from the mirror symmetry of Bernal graphite, with small differences likely resulting from a variation in mobility between the two surfaces. This can also be seen by comparing the black traces in the panels above and to the right of the resistance map, which show Rxx as each gate is swept with the other held at ground. We further see corroborating behavior in the Hall resistance, Rxy, measured in a small magnetic field of B = 0.2 T. In particular, Rxy exhibits a sign change around zero bias in each gate sweep, signifying a corresponding sign change in the charge of the free carriers residing in the surface accumulation layer.\nIn contrast to our observations in Bernal graphite, transport in our t1+10 sample differs considerably de-\npending on which gate is swept, as the mirror symmetry of the structure is broken by the rotated graphene sheet at the surface. Here, we denote the voltage on the gate facing the moire\u0301 (Bernal graphite) surface as Vm (Vgr) (see Fig. 1c). We see a much larger change in the resistance with gating in this device (Fig. 1d), with the highest resistance confined to a small region around Vgr \u2248 0. Transport is reminiscent of Bernal graphite when sweeping Vgr (see Rxx and Rxy traces in the top panel), but exhibits fundamentally new behavior when sweeping Vm (right panel). In particular, repeated Rxy sign changes indicate multiple instances in which the free carriers on the twisted surface switch between electron- and holelike. This behavior arises from the moire\u0301 reconstruction of the graphite band structure, marking the formation of a series of surface-localized moire\u0301 bands. These can be seen in calculations of the band structure of this material (Fig. 1e, see Methods for details). The bands are color-coded based upon their expectation value along the graphite c-axis, denoted as \u3008z\u3009, where a value of 1 (-1) corresponds to the moire\u0301 (Bernal graphite) surface. We find moire\u0301 bands localized on the outer graphene layers at the rotated interface (red colored bands), consistent with previous calculations performed for infinitely thick graphite slabs [23].\nDespite the differences between the Bernal and moire\u0301 graphite devices, the gate-dependent transport of both are dominated by their surfaces. Figure 1c illustrates this\n4 schematically for the twisted graphene-graphite device, where a charge carrier density of nm (ngr) can be induced on the moire\u0301 (Bernal) surface by tuning Vm (Vgr). The graphite bulk remains a compensated semimetal, with roughly equal electron- and hole-doping (ne and nh) that does not change with gating.\nLow-field magnetotransport properties of moire\u0301 graphite\nThe contrast between Bernal and moire\u0301 graphite becomes more obvious upon applying a small magnetic field along the c-axis. Figure 2a shows a dual-gate resistance map for the 23-layer Bernal graphite sample acquired at a magnetic field of B = 0.5 T. The resistance is largest when the voltage on both gates is approximately zero, consistent with prior reports of a large magnetoresistance (MR) in bulk graphite crystals [25]. Upon gating, we additionally find a large MR everywhere along the condition of overall charge neutrality, Vt/dt + Vb/db = 0, as evidenced by the diagonal resistance stripe in Fig. 2a. Measurements of the Hall resistance show a corresponding sign change across the line of overall neutrality.\nThese observations can be captured by a four-carrier Drude transport model, in which we assume that transport is mediated by coexisting electron and hole bulk carriers that do not respond to gating, along with gatemodulated surface accumulation layers controlled independently by the top and bottom gates (see Methods for full details). Extended Data Figure 1a shows the result of this calculation, taking the known mobility and bulk charge doping of graphite [25, 26]. The excellent agreement between our measurements and this calculation indicates that transport is primarily determined by the total free charge density in the material, even when the gate-induced charge is mostly localized at the outer surfaces. This behavior arises as a consequence of the low intrinsic bulk doping of graphite, as similar calculations performed with orders-of-magnitude larger bulk doping show virtually no gate tunability (Extended Data Fig. 1b).\nCorresponding measurements of the moire\u0301 sample reveal a more complex dependence of transport on gating (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2). Rather than a single resistance stripe, Rxx exhibits a maximum that evolves with a peculiar zig-zag trajectory upon gating. The contour of Rxy = 0 tracks closely with the Rxx maximum. Notably, the periodic resets we observe upon biasing Vm correspond closely with integer multiples of the gate voltage required to completely fill the four-fold degenerate surface moire\u0301 minibands, denoted by the band filling factor, \u03bd, on the right-hand axis (see Methods for definition of \u03bd).\nThis behavior can be qualitatively captured by a simple model building upon the magnetotransport properties of Bernal graphite. Transport in the moire\u0301 sample evolves similarly to that of Bernal graphite as the two\ngate voltages are tuned slightly away from zero, forming a small diagonal resistance stripe. However, as Vm is raised further, the surface moire\u0301 minibands evolve through a Lifshitz transition corresponding to a sign change in the mass of the free carriers. When Vm corresponds to full filling of the moire\u0301 band (\u03bd = \u00b14), the surface free charge density returns to approximately zero, and the transport once again mimics the local behavior surrounding Vgr \u2248 Vm \u2248 0. The sign of the Hall effect similarly flips as the doping at the moire\u0301 surface switches between electron- and hole-like, corresponding to instances in which Fermi energy crosses a moire\u0301 band extrema or a Lifshitz transition. For sufficiently large values of Vgr, the doping of the Bernal graphite surface exceeds the maximum doping possible in the narrow moire\u0301 band, and the sign of the Hall effect can no longer flip upon further biasing Vm.\nWe verify this picture by calculating the band structure of twisted graphene-graphite with tunable gate-induced surface potentials (see Methods for full details). We adopt the Thomas-Fermi approximation to account for the screening of external electric fields by the graphite bulk [27]. Fig. 2c shows the evolution of the band structure for various values of the potential at the moire\u0301 surface, Um. The Fermi energy is denoted by the black dashed line, and is held fixed at zero energy. We find that gating primarily changes the energy of the moire\u0301like surface states, whereas the graphite-like states in the bulk remain at fixed energy. In contrast, the energy of the moire\u0301-like bands remains fixed upon changing the potential at the Bernal graphite surface, Ugr, as shown in Fig. 2d. Instead, only graphite-like states change in energy, resulting in the filling of surface valence or conduction band states depending only on the sign of Ugr. These calculations support our interpretation of the zigzag feature observed in transport, since the sign of the free carriers induced at the sample surfaces flips only once upon changing the sign of Ugr, but inverts repeatedly as the moire\u0301 surface bands are filled upon changing Um. Extended Data Figures 3 and 4 provide a more detailed analysis of these band structure calculations.\nHybridized moire\u0301 and bulk states at high field\nSo far, we have found that the charge accumulation layers on the two surfaces do not directly hybridize with each other, and are thus controlled independently by the nearest gate. However, this behavior is known to break down in Bernal graphite at higher magnetic fields [28]. In the ultra-quantum limit, only the two lowest (nearly-degenerate) Landau bands cross the Fermi energy, and the electron motion is primarily limited to the c-axis [28, 29]. Electrons form a set of standing waves that penetrate across the entire bulk owing to the quasi1D nature of these Landau bands. These states are thus controlled equally by the top and bottom gates. All other Landau bands are gapped within the bulk, and although\n5\nthey can be populated at the surfaces by gating, they form a screening layer and can only be controlled by the nearest gate. As a consequence, we find that Landau fans acquired by sweeping a single gate exhibit two distinct sets of quantum oscillations (QOs). One sequence projects to approximately zero gate voltage at B = 0, irrespective of the bias applied to the other gate. These QOs correspond to surface-localized states. The second sequence projects to a non-zero gate voltage determined by the bias applied to the opposite gate, in particular following the line of overall charge neutrality. These QOs correspond to states that are extended across the entire bulk (Extended Data Fig. 5).\nThe moire\u0301 surface states in t1+Z graphite form Hofstadter bands at high field [30], which must smoothly evolve into the Bernal graphite Landau bands in the bulk. Despite this additional complexity, our magnetotransport measurements reveal that ungapped bulk states remain extended across the entire sample. We probe this\neffect by acquiring Landau fan diagrams while sweeping Vgr at various fixed values of Vm (Fig. 3a). Similar to our observations in Bernal graphite, we see two distinct sequences of QOs that project to different values of Vgr at B = 0. Selected QOs from the sequence corresponding to states localized at the Bernal graphite surface are denoted by black dashed lines, and project to Vgr \u2248 0 irrespective of Vm. In contrast, the QOs corresponding to the bulk extended states (denoted by blue dashed lines) project to different values of Vgr depending sensitively on Vm.\nFigure 3c shows the color-coded projections from many Landau fan diagrams overlayed atop the Rxy map acquired at B = 0.5 T. The projection point of the extended states (blue dots) oscillates with Vm, tracking closely with the Rxy = 0 contour measured at low field for \u22124 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 +4. These quantities diverge for larger values of \u03bd, however, we still see occasional sharp resets in the projection point of the QOs to values near Vgr = 0 even\n6\nat larger values of Vm (e.g., at Vm/dm \u2248 \u22120.2 V/nm). Overall, this behavior is enabled by the unique nature of the extended standing wave states in Bernal graphite. As illustrated schematically in the top left inset of Fig. 3d, the standing wave hybridizes the moire\u0301 surface states with the graphite bulk states and inextricably mixes the properties of the two. The low- and high-field zig-zag features we see in Fig. 3c arise from distinct physical mechanisms, yet exhibit remarkably consistent behavior that is primarily determined by the total gate-induced free charge in the sample.\nUnlike in Bernal graphite, the Landau fan diagrams in twisted grahene-graphite differ substantially depending on which gate is swept. In particular, we see QOs corresponding to the moire\u0301 bands only upon sweeping Vm (Fig. 3b). We denote selected QOs projecting to fullfilling of the moire\u0301 surface bands (\u03bd = \u00b14) with pink dashed lines, whereas QOs projecting to the charge neutrality point (\u03bd = 0) are denoted in purple. Figure 3c shows the B = 0 projection points of these states overlayed atop the Rxx map acquired at B = 0.5 T. Again, we see good agreement between the low- and high-field features. In particular, the low-field transport around Vgr \u2248 0 exhibits diagonal resistance features closely matching the evolution of the projection points of the high-field QOs at \u03bd = \u00b14 and 0. We also find that both the resistance and the QO projections depend only weakly on Vgr as the bias is raised further. These observations suggest that the moire\u0301 bands can be doped by changing Vgr when the bias is small, but that surface states on the Bernal face screen the effect of changing Vgr when the bias is large.\nDespite the obvious differences in the Landau fan dia-\ngrams acquired by sweeping each gate, Brown-Zak (BZ) oscillations [30\u201335] appear in both. These occur as maxima in the magnetoconductance, Gxx = Rxx/(R 2 xx + R2xy), and arise at rational values of the magnetic flux filling of the moire\u0301 unit cell. The oscillations are most obvious after averaging Gxx over the entire range of each gate voltage (denoted as \u3008Gxx\u3009 in Fig. 3d), thereby eliminating contributions from individual QOs at a given field. BZ oscillations are anticipated when sweeping Vm (red curve in Fig. 3d), since charge carriers are directly populating the moire\u0301 bands. In contrast, the BZ oscillations seen upon sweeping Vgr (blue line in Fig. 3d) are more surprising, since this gate does not directly fill the moire\u0301 bands. This effect is more clearly visible in a t1+17 device with \u03b8 = 1.31\u25e6, which exhibits very sharp magnetoconductance peaks averaged over Vgr (top right inset of Fig. 3d).\nThe BZ oscillations correspond to conditions in which charge carriers experience zero effective magnetic field, and thus exhibit straight trajectories in real space [35]. Although it is possible for the moire\u0301 to propogate through bulk graphite due to structural relaxations, this effect has been found to arise only at ultra-small twist angles [36], and is therefore unlikely to be relevant in our samples. Instead, the observation of BZ oscillations upon sweeping Vgr indicates that carriers doped into the Bernal graphite surface obey transport properties dictated in part by the moire\u0301 potential on the opposite surface, providing further evidence of the hybridization of moire\u0301 and bulk states at high field. We further find that this effect persists in devices where the moire\u0301 interface is buried at the center of the sample (Extended Data Fig. 6). In this case, the moire\u0301 bands are inaccessible by gating and can not be\n7 filled by either gate, but nevertheless generate strong BZ oscillations by hybridizing with the bulk states of each rotated Bernal graphite constituent."

            "text": "Our observations appear to be generic for t1+Z graphite, as we see qualitative similarities across different graphite thicknesses and twist angles. Figure 4 shows Rxx and Rxy maps acquired at B = 0.5 T for five samples with Bernal graphite components ranging from Z = 6 to 40 layers. The zig-zag resistance feature becomes increasingly obscured for thicker graphite, but we nevertheless see oscillations in Rxy that appear to correspond closely with four-fold multiples of \u03bd. The value of Vm required to establish the complete zig-zag feature scales with the twist angle, since bias needed to fully fill the moire\u0301 surface band is directly proportional to the twist angle. In the high-field regime, we see similar zig-zag evolutions of the Landau fan diagram projections for both the t1+6 and t1+17 graphite samples (Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8 and Supplementary Videos 3-5).\nOverall, our results establish a new class of \u2018mixeddimensional moire\u0301 materials,\u2019 in which a moire\u0301 potential localized to a single 2D interface fundamentally transforms the properties of an entire bulk crystal. This behavior may generalize to other layered semimetals with low intrinsic bulk doping, in which surface accumulation layers formed by gating can dominate the transport. Similar effects could therefore arise in materials such as WTe2 and ZrTe5. Our work additionally motivates experiments with more complex graphitic structures, including those with moire\u0301 patterns at both the top and bottom surfaces and those with moire\u0301 interfaces distributed throughout the bulk of the material. At high magnetic field, standing waves in the bulk may couple these coexisting moire\u0301 potentials in interesting and exotic new ways. Finally, new complex moire\u0301 geometries in bulk graphitic thin films may help to unravel the origin of the superconductivity found both in natural few-layer graphene allotropes [37, 38] and in a growing family of magic-angle twisted graphene structures."

            "text": "Device fabrication. Moire\u0301 devices were fabricated using the \u201ccut-and-stack\u201d method [39, 40]. t1+Z structures are made by finding an exfoliated bulk graphite thin film with a connected monolayer graphene region, isolating the two using an atomic force microscope tip, and then stacking one atop the other at the desired twist angle. The sample with the buried moire\u0301 was made by isolating two regions from a single 7-layer graphite sheet and stacking them atop each other. All samples were assembled using standard dry-transfer techniques with a polycarbonate (PC)/polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS)\nstamp [41]. All devices are encapsulated in flakes of BN and graphite, and then transferred onto a Si/SiO2 wafer. The temperature was kept below 180\u25e6C during device fabrication to preserve the intended twist angle. The number of graphite layers in each device, Z, was determined by atomic force microscopy measurements after encapsulation. Standard electron beam lithography, CHF3/O2 plasma etching, and metal deposition techniques (Cr/Au) were used to define the complete stack into a Hall bar geometry [41].\nTransport measurements. Transport measurements were performed in a Cryomagnetics variable temperature insert, and were conducted in a four-terminal geometry with a.c. current excitation of 10-200 nA using standard lock-in techniques at a frequency of 17.7 Hz. Some of the measurements acquired for the Supplementary Videos 1-2 for the t1+10 device were performed in a Bluefors dilution refrigerator at a nominal base temperature of 20 mK.\nTwist angle determination. The twist angle \u03b8 is determined by fitting the sequence of QOs arising upon sweeping Vm. The charge carrier density required to fill the moire\u0301 superlattice is given by ns = 8\u03b8 2/ \u221a\n3a2, where a = 0.246 nm. The value of ns is determined by tracing the QOs corresponding to full filling of the moire\u0301 surface bands to B = 0. The band filling factor, \u03bd, is defined such that \u03bd = \u00b14 at doping \u00b1ns, where the numerical factor of 4 corresponds to the spin and valley degeneracy of graphene.\nQOs projecting to full filling (\u03bd = \u00b14) are evident in all devices shown in Fig. 4 except for the t1+40 device. The twist angle for the t1+40 device was instead estimated through piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) imaging of the moire\u0301 pattern (Extended Data Fig. 9). PFM was performed on the transfer slide during the sample fabrication directly after picking up the 40-layer graphite and the monolayer graphene [42]. The twist angle is extracted by calculating the average of the three moire\u0301 lattice points in the Fourier transform of the PFM image. The twist angle in the t1+6 device was also independently confirmed in this manner.\nWhen observed, the BZ oscillation sequence provides an independent measure of the twist angle. Magnetoconductance peaks are expected to occur when the magnetic flux \u03c6 = 4B/ns is equal to p/q times the flux quantum \u03c60 = h/e, where h is Planck\u2019s constant and p, q are integers. We extract ns by fitting the observed peaks to a series of rational \u03c6/\u03c60 = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc. In all devices, we find that this value agrees with that extracted by tracking the QOs to within a few percent.\nTemperature dependence measurements. We track the evolution of the low-field magnetotransport in the t1+17 device in Extended Data Fig. 10. We see signatures of the zig-zag feature persisting up to at least 50 K. As the temperature is raised further, the structure in the Rxx map becomes washed out. Rxy continues to ex-\n8 hibit a sign change, but along a straight line with a slope that becomes more vertical in the map with higher temperature. At room temperature, transport is nearly unaffected by changing Vm, potentially due to lower mobility on the moire\u0301 surface compared to the Bernal graphite surface.\nTransport model of Bernal graphite at low field. We capture the low-field transport behavior of Bernal graphite with a four-component Drude model. Magnetotransport is characterized by the conductivity tensor \u03c3, with a corresponding current density j = \u03c3E under an electric field E. Each of the four carrier species are independent, and have a two-dimensional carrier density denoted as ni, where i is t, b, e, or h. In order, these correspond to the charges on the top and bottom graphite surfaces, and the intrinsic electron and hole free carriers in the graphite bulk. Each carrier species has an associated mobility, \u00b5i. In the absence of a magnetic field, the conductivity is a scalar and the contribution from the i-th carrier is \u03c3i = eni\u00b5i. In the presence of a magnetic field, the conductivity tensor is \u03c3 = \u2211 i \u03c3i where the contribution from the i-th carrier is\n\u03c3i = \u03c3i\n1 + (\u00b5iB)2\n( 1 \u03b7i\u00b5iB\n\u2212\u03b7i\u00b5iB 1\n) ,\nwith \u03b7i = \u22131 for electrons and holes, respectively. The resistivity tensor is \u03c1 = \u03c3\u22121, where the diagonal and offdiagonal elements separately represent the longitudinal (\u03c1xx) and transverse (\u03c1xy) resistivities.\nGraphite is a nearly compensated semimetal, and for simplicity we assume ne = nh. We take previously measured parameters of bulk graphite [25, 26], in which the three-dimensional bulk carrier density is n3D = 3 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123 and the mobility is \u00b5e = \u00b5h = 1\u00d7106 cm2/Vs. We assume the same value for the surface mobilities, \u00b5t and \u00b5b. The bulk electron and hole carrier densities correspond to a two-dimensional density of n2D = 2\u00d71012 cm\u22122 per graphene sheet. To model our 23-layer Bernal graphite sample, we assign 21 layers of n2D as the fixed bulk density, ne = nh = 21\u00d7n2D = 4\u00d7 1013 cm\u22122. We then vary the surface density of the two remaining layers, corresponding to changing the top and bottom gate voltages over typical experimentally accessible values.\nExtended Data Fig. 1a shows the results of the calculation, which qualitatively match the experimental observations in Fig. 2a. In particular, we see the largest resistivity along the line of overall charge neutrality, with a corresponding change in the sign of the Hall effect. We also see that the resistivity is largest when both of the surfaces are undoped, also consistent with our experimental results. The qualitative agreement between experiment and theory does not depend strongly on the precise values of the graphite parameters we assume. However, as an additional check, we repeat the calculation with unrealistically large bulk density, ne = nh = 2\u00d71015 cm\u221212\n(Extended Data Fig. 1b). In this case, we find that virtually no gate dependence can be observed in the longitudinal resistivity, which changes by only tenths of an ohm, compared to over a hundred ohms in the calculation performed with realistic graphite parameters. These calculations therefore establish that the gate-tunable transport we observe in graphite arises as a consequence of its modest intrinsic bulk doping.\nBand structure calculation. We first calculate the Hamiltonian for Z-layer Bernal graphite. We define |k, Al\u3009 and |k, Bl\u3009 as the Bloch states at the K point of layer l. By arranging the basis as |k, A1\u3009, |k, B1\u3009; |k, A2\u3009, |k, B2\u3009; ...; |k, AZ\u3009, |k, BZ\u3009;, the Hamiltonian around the K point is given by\nHZG(k) =  HD(k)\u2212 U1 \u0393(k) 0 \u0393\u2020(k) HD(k)\u2212 U2 \u0393\u2020(k) 0 \u0393(k) HD(k)\u2212 U3\n. . .  , with\nHD(k) =\n( 0\n\u221a 3 2 \u03b30(kx \u2212 iky)\u221a\n3 2 \u03b30(kx + iky) 0\n) ,\nand\n\u0393(k) =\n( \u2212 \u221a 3 2 \u03b34(kx \u2212 iky) \u2212 \u221a 3 2 \u03b33(kx + iky)\n\u03b31 \u2212 \u221a 3 2 \u03b34(kx \u2212 iky)\n) ,\nwhere Uj is the electronic potential at jth layer. We set the parameters (\u03b30, \u03b31, \u03b33, \u03b34) = (2.6, 0.36, 0.28, 0.14) eV [43].\nTo calculate the band structure of twisted graphenegraphite, we further place a single graphene layer on the Z-layer graphite and twist it by \u03b8. The effective Hamiltonian can be written as\nH =\n( HMG H \u2020 int\nHint HZG\n) ,\nwhere HMG is the Hamiltonian for the twisted monolayer graphene. Hint is the interlayer coupling term between the monolayer and the topmost layer of the graphite. We define |k\u2032, A0\u3009 and |k\u2032, B0\u3009 as the Bloch states of the twisted graphene at R(\u03b8)K, where R(\u03b8) is the rotation matrix in the xy-plane at an angle \u03b8. By using this basis, the Hamiltonian for the graphene can be represented as\nHMG =\n( U0\n\u221a 3 2 \u03b30(k \u2032 x \u2212 ik\u2032y)\u221a\n3 2 \u03b30(k \u2032 x + ik \u2032 y) U0\n) .\nThe Bloch wavevector of the twisted graphene and the Z-layer graphite are coupled when k = k\u2032 + qj (j = 0, 1, 2), where q0 = (0, 0), q1 =\n1 LM (\u2212 2\u03c0\u221a 3 ,\u22122\u03c0) and q2 =\n1 LM ( 2\u03c0\u221a 3 ,\u22122\u03c0), where LM is the moire\u0301 lattice constant.\n9 Under these constraints, the interlayer coupling is given by\nHint = 2\u2211 j=0 tint\n( \u03b1 e\u2212i 2\u03c0j 3\nei 2\u03c0j 3 \u03b1\n) ,\nand is otherwise zero. We take the parameters tint = 0.11 eV and \u03b1 = 0.5 [44], the latter of which captures the effects of lattice relaxations.\nWe additionally consider the effective model for Zlayer graphite twisted atop Z-layer graphite, such that the moire\u0301 interface is buried at the center of the material. The Hamiltonian is constructed following same analysis as above, but replacing HMG with HZG(k\n\u2032). The two rotated graphite constituents are coupled by Hint at their rotated interface.\nWe capture the effects of gating by adopting the Thomas-Fermi approximation to account for the screening of external electric fields by the graphite bulk [27, 45]. For small gate voltages, the electric field is given by\nUj = Ume \u2212jd/\u03bbs + Ugre \u2212(Z\u2212j)d/\u03bbs (j = 0, ..., Z)\nwhere \u03bbs \u2248 1.3d, and d is the interlayer distance. Um/gr is the potential for the moire\u0301/graphite surface.\nFinally, we numerically calculate the eigenvalues and eigenstates by truncating at a sufficiently large momentum and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. The electron of the n-th eigenvalue is distributed along the graphite c-axis as follows:\n\u3008znk\u3009 = \u2211 l \u2211 \u03c3=A,B zl|\u03c6nk,\u03c3l |2\nwhere the eigenstate is written as |\u03c8nk\u3009 =\u2211 \u03c3,l \u03c6nk,\u03c3l |k, \u03c3l\u3009 and zl = 2(z0 \u2212 ld)/Lz. Lz and z0 denote the width and the center of the system, respectively."
