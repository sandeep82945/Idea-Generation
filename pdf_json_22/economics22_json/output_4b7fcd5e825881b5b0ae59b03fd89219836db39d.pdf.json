    "abstractText": "Due to unreasonable pricing, farmers have low enthusiasm for reclaiming their homesteads, which can be used to generate construction land quota. This paper studies how to design a feasible pricing mechanism to stimulate the enthusiasm of farmers. First, we analyze the practice that the local government gives the developers with quota the selection, the right to select the location of the land to be auctioned. Then, applying sequential auction theory, we propose firstand second-price sealed-bid sequential auction models and design quota auction pricing mechanisms. Through theoretical and numerical analysis, we obtain the equilibrium strategy and analyze the impact of selection and on developers\u2019 bidding pricing on quota. The results show that the selection can enhance the developer\u2019s quota bidding price and farmers\u2019 income. And the higher the value of selection to the developer, the higher the quota bidding price and farmer\u2019s income. Contrarily, the larger the number of developers, the smaller the quota bidding price and farmers\u2019 income. Finally, the quota bidding price and farmers\u2019 income in the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction are higher than in the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction. Introduction In order to ensure sufficient arable land for cultivating food, the Chinese central government has implemented a construction land quota system to limit the amount of cultivated land developed into construction land by local governments. Under this system, the central government grants a certain number of construction land quotas to local governments every year as planned, and each local government can only develop cultivated land within this specified quota. With the rapid advancement of China\u2019s urbanization process, the demand for cultivated land development in cities has increased rapidly [1]. Although there are sufficient cultivated land resources in various regions, the central government plans to allocate scarce quotas. This can result in local governments having no right to develop arable land into construction land. A large number of development projects can thus be delayed or even canceled, hindering the progress of urbanization. At the same time, urbanization has attracted many people from rural areas into the cities, resulting in rural homesteads being left idle and causing a wastage of rural land resources. To solve this problem, Chongqing, Chengdu, and other cities, as well as a large number of domestic follow-up cities, have innovated the construction land quota system.

            "text": "In order to ensure sufficient arable land for cultivating food, the Chinese central government has implemented a construction land quota system to limit the amount of cultivated land developed into construction land by local governments. Under this system, the central government grants a certain number of construction land quotas to local governments every year as planned, and each local government can only develop cultivated land within this specified quota. With the rapid advancement of China\u2019s urbanization process, the demand for cultivated land development in cities has increased rapidly [1]. Although there are sufficient cultivated land resources in various regions, the central government plans to allocate scarce quotas. This can result in local governments having no right to develop arable land into construction land. A large number of development projects can thus be delayed or even canceled, hindering the progress of urbanization. At the same time, urbanization has attracted many people from rural areas into the cities, resulting in rural homesteads being left idle and causing a wastage of rural land resources.\nTo solve this problem, Chongqing, Chengdu, and other cities, as well as a large number of\ndomestic follow-up cities, have innovated the construction land quota system. Under this\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 1 / 25\na1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Deng Y, Meng W, Huang B, Liu J (2022) Auction mechanism on construction land quota with selection on land location.

Since the local government has turned rural construction land into cultivated land, the same area of cultivated land in the city can be developed into construction land [2\u20134]. In this manner, governments have obtained supplementary construction land quotas in addition to those allocated by the central government. In order to encourage farmers to reclaim, the local government sells the construction land quotas generated by the reclamation to developers in need, and the subsequent income belongs to the farmers.\nAlthough the additional quotas of reclaimed construction land can alleviate the problem of\ninsufficient quotas of construction land, the local government adopts the cost plus pricing method based on reclamation cost. This is unreasonable as the resulting price is too low, which has affected farmers\u2019 enthusiasm for reclamation. [5\u20138]. Such unreasonable pricing has been pointed out by domestic scholars [9\u201313]. Xu [14] combined the two stages of quota production and use, and tried to use the cost and surplus methods to build a quota price calculation model from the perspective of cost and income. The authors used the relevant data of Dezhou City and Jimo City for empirical calculations. Meanwhile, Chen et al. [15] improved the pricing method of Qiu and Qiu [16], taking the view that the transaction price of construction land quota should include the cost and market prices. Thus, they put forward the marketoriented transaction price system. Wen and Zhang [17] argued that the price of construction land quota should be the price of land for construction purposes. Feng et al. [18] and Liu et al. [19] posit that because the construction land quota trading market is mainly controlled by the local government rather than the market, its price hardly reveals the true value of the quota. These studies point out that the quota price should include the use price, the market price, and the price of land for construction. However, these studies have not yet fully understood the true value of this construction land quota, and have failed to provide effective suggestions on the pricing mechanism. The real value of the quota is manifested as that the undeveloped urban farmland can be developed as construction land immediately. Therefore, the value of the quota is an opportunity cost value, which is the developers\u2019 private information. This study holds that the sealed auction mechanism is one of the best ways to reveal the true value of the construction land quota. According to the practice transaction of construction land quota, only by having both quota and construction land can the land be developed. Therefore, it is more reasonable to use the two-stage sequential sealed auction mechanism.\nSequential auction theory is applied in reality to reveal the rationality of the real value of\ngoods [20\u201324]. Milgrom [25] solved the transaction pricing problem of radio spectrum in the United States by determining the true value of radio spectrum through the participation of bidders in the auction. De Silva et al. [26] applied the auction to the construction contract, and also considered the synergy between the projects. Finally, they argued that winners of early auctions are more likely to participate in later auctions. The authors provide evidence to support this prediction through continuous building auctions conducted by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation. Branco [27] and adopted two-stage sequential auctions, and believed that there was no fierce competition in the first stage, which created an advantage for the second stage auction and thus reduced the expected price. The latter, however, Menezes and Monteiro [28] came to the opposite conclusion that expected prices rose instead of falling. Leufkens and Peeters [29] compared the two sequential auction forms in the case of two bidders and believed that the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction was superior to the secondprice sealed-bid auction. Leufkens et al. [30] also compared two sequential auctions with three different scales of synergies in the case of four bidders through a series of experimental methods. The authors believed that the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction with small and\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 2 / 25\nmedium-sized synergies in regular procurement auctions was superior to the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction; however, when the synergies were very large, the two sequential auctions were very similar. These above studies have carried out in-depth examinations on sequential auction and compared the differences between the first- and second-price sealedbid sequential auction. However, there are few studies on the application of sequential auction method to the quota pricing mechanism.\nConsidering the practice that the local government gives the developers with quota the\nselection, the right to choose land to be auctioned. It is believed that the value of the construction land selected by developers is reflected by whether they have the right to select [31]. Wang and Yang [32] think that the construction land quota contains selection prices and that it is associated with the degree of selection prices and the economy\u2019s development: developers in more developed regions are willing to pay higher prices for selection. Meanwhile, Wu [33] believes that the selection saves the time value of the development of construction land, and realizes the combination of the owner of the quota and the user of the construction land. This is also the main reason why Liu et al. [34] believes that there is a time lag and low efficiency in the dispersion of urbanization in China. Lu [35] defined the income obtained from the quota selection of construction land as the selection income. The author constructed a mathematical model of the developers\u2019 participation quota and land auction and studied the existing problems in the construction land quota system. These studies highlight the importance of construction land quota selection for quota pricing. However, they have not made relevant research on how to price quotas when they have the right of select, and how the right of select affects the pricing of quotas.\nIn order to solve the problem caused by the insufficient construction land quota allocated by the central government, local governments encourage farmers to reclaim their idle homesteads to generate additional construction land quotas and sell them to developers in need. Consequently, to boost farmers\u2019 enthusiasm for reclamation, the government uses auctions to sell the reclaimed construction land quota. At the same time, to increase the value of this indicator to developers, as well as the developer\u2019s quotation, the local government gives the right of selecting the location of the land to be auctioned to the developer who has bought construction land quota from the government. In other words, the developer can select the land that best meets its needs from among the multiple the multiple alternative land provided by the government the multiple alternative land, and thereafter participate in its auction.\nThe remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the problem and\nvariables. Section 3 obtains and analyses the equilibrium solutions. Section 4 presents the numerical analysis to further verify the model and proposition. Section 5 presents the conclusions and policy suggestions."

However, it\nlacks a quota for construction land. Therefore, the government encourages farmers to voluntarily reclaim the rural vacant homesteads into cultivated land to produce the construction land quota and through the sealed auction method to sell to the need of developers. Meanwhile, the government stipulates that the developer who has obtained the quota in the firststage auction has the selection to select the intended plot as the construction land in the second-stage auction, within the scope of urban planning and general land use planning. Then the government holds a second auction to sell the selected construction land to developers who also participated in the first auction. Moreover, the project can only be developed when the developer is able to acquire the construction land quota and the construction land simultaneously.\nObviously, the value of the right of select is mainly reflected in the select of the expected\nconstruction land [36]. Because the developer who wins the construction land quota can select the prospective land. On the contrary, the developer who fails to win the quota cannot select the prospective land. Therefore, developers who fail to win the quota value the land to be auctioned at a lower price than before. The main reason for the lower than the original evaluation is that the matching degree of the land is reduced. The higher the mismatch degree, the greater the degree of land discount, and the greater the value of the selection for developers. Thus, all developers are willing to pay a higher price for the construction land quota."

            "text": "According to China\u2019s construction land quota system, the government can sell the construction land quota and construction land by auction. The developer who wins the construction land quota by auction has the right to choose the construction land. The use of the selection improvers the match between the land chosen by the developer and the construction land expected to be developed; that is, the developer can obtain higher utility [37]. Therefore, we establish a sequential auction model for construction land quota and construction land based on the Hedonic utility theory. The basic assumptions and auction process are as follows:\na. Assume that the risk-neutral seller (the Chinese government) sells two items by holding\ntwo successive auctions. The first (second) stage is the construction land quota (construction land) auction. Furthermore, the construction land quota and the construction land value are not correlated.\nb. Assume that the total number of bidders is n. Bidder i2{1,2,. . .,n} has a utility function u: R+!R, which satisfies u(0) = 0,u\u2019>0,u\"<0.Each bidder pursues utility maximization and has independent private value. One may assume that bidder i\u2019s valuation of the construction land quota is v1i and that of the construction land is v2i. These independently obey the uniform distribution on [0,\u03b5] and [0,1] respectively, where \u03b5<1, the distribution function is Fi(\ufffd), and the density function is fi(\ufffd).\nc. n risk-neutral bidders participate in the two stages of auction simultaneously and successively. The winner in the first stage holds the construction land quota, and can choose the\nland in line with the urban, rural, and land planning as the land for their own construction project. Furthermore, they can participate in the second stage of commodity auction. Therefore, the loser F in the first stage has a land depreciation coefficient rL;Fj 2 \u00bd0; 1\ufffd for the construction land. The land depreciation coefficient rL;Fj is due to the existence of the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 4 / 25\nquota selection of the construction land. This makes the construction land auctioned in the second stage less matched with the construction land expected to be developed by the developer without selection. Therefore, land depreciation occurs. The smaller rL;Fj is, the lower the degree of matching between the construction land auctioned in the second stage and the construction land expected to be developed by the loser in the first stage. Furthermore, the higher the land depreciation will be for the developers who have no selection. Therefore, all developers are more willing to obtain the selection to obtain the competitive advantage in the second stage. Further, assume that the willingness to pay for the loser in the first stage is v2F \u00bc rL;Fjv2F . The willingness to pay v2L for the winner of the first stage of obtaining construction land remains unchanged. Finally, the winner with the highest bid in each stage wins the goods in this stage.\nTable 1 summarizes the parameter symbols and meanings involved in this model."

The construction\nland quote is unrelated to the value of the land. Therefore, the quotation of the second stage does not depend on the transaction price of the first stage, but only depends on the bidder\u2019s value. Suppose there is an equilibrium in the second-stage auction, where the bidder pays the price b2i and the bidder of type S = {L,F1,F2,. . .,Fn\u22121} uses strategy \u03b2S. Further assume that \u03b2S is an increasing and differentiable function with an inverse function \u03d5S = (\u03b2s)\u22121. Obviously, there is bL\u00f00\u00de \u00bc bFj\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0, j = 1,2,. . .,n\u22121. Then, we can say\n\ufffdb \u00bc bL\u00f01\u00de \u00bc bFj\u00f01\u00de, which represents the highest bid jointly submitted by the bidders. If the risk is neutral and the utility function is linear, the winner L in the first stage obtains the net utility u(bL) = vL\u2212bL from the construction land. Then, the utility function of bidder L is:\nU2L\u00f0b2L\u00de \u00bc \u00f0v2L b2L\u00deb n 1 2L \u00f01\u00de\nTake the partial derivative of the utility function to obtain the first-order condition:\n@U2L @b2L \u00bc b2L n 1 \u00fe \u00f0v2L b2L\u00de\u00f0n 1\u00deb2L n 2 \u00f02\u00de\nUtility maximization makes the first partial derivative zero to obtain the following:\nb2L \u00bc n 1 n v2L \u00f03\u00de\nSimilarly, we find that the net utility of the construction land obtained by the loser Fj in the first stage bidding is u\u00f0b2Fj\u00de \u00bc rL;Fjv2Fj b2Fj , and the utility function of the bidder Fj is:\nU2Fj\u00f0b2Fj\u00de \u00bc \u00f0rL;Fjv2Fj b2Fj\u00deb2Fj n 1 \u00f04\u00de\nTake the partial derivative of the utility function to obtain the first-order condition:\n@U2Fj @b2Fj \u00bc bFj n 1 \u00fe \u00f0rL;Fjv2Fj b2Fj\u00de\u00f0n 1\u00deb2Fj n 2 \u00f05\u00de\nUtility maximization makes the first partial derivative zero to obtain the following:\nb2Fj \u00bc n 1 n rL;Fjv2Fj \u00f06\u00de\nThus, we have shown above that b2i = b(v2i) is only necessary to obtain the maximum value of utility.

That is b2L > n 1n v2L, @U2L @b2L < 0. Thus, b2L \u00bc n 1n v2L is a sufficient condition for the first stage winner to get the maximum. Similarly, b2Fj \u00bc n 1 n rL;Fjv2Fj is a sufficient condition for the first stage loser to obtain a maximum. In summary, the second stage bidding strategy of developer L who won the construction land quota in the first stage is b I 2L\u00f0vL\u00de \u00bc n 1 n v2L.

At this point, it is 1.

The latter is reflected in the difference between the expected residual before the auction in the second stage between the developer who has and has not obtained the quota.

In conclusion, in the second stage, the bidding strategy of the developer who won the construction land quota in the first stage is \u03b22L = vL. Correspondingly, developers who did not win the construction land quota in the first stage had a bidding strategy b2Fj \u00bc rL;Fjv2Fj . Now consider the first stage strategy. Each bidder\u2019s expected surplus in the second stage auction depends on the outcome of the first stage. Therefore, the value of the bidder in the first stage auction is the value of the first item plus parameter D II \u00f0rL;Fj\u00de. This represents the value of the selection that can be obtained by entering the second stage auction as the winner compared with the loser in the first stage; that is, the difference of the pre-expected residual D II \u00f0rL;Fj\u00de \u00bc DE\u00f0Ui\u00de. Since D II \u00f0rL;Fj\u00de is the same for both bidders in the first-stage auction, the first-stage auction is symmetric.

Furthermore, the winning developer\u2019s quotation in the second stage is also greater than the maximum quotation of n\u22121 losing developers. In this case, the price paid by the winning developer for the construction land quota is the quotation. Second, when developer i only obtains the quota of construction land, the winning developer\u2019s quotation in the first stage is greater than the maximum quotation of n\u22121 losers. Furthermore, the winning developer\u2019s quotation in the second stage is less than the maximum quotation of n\u22121 losers. In this case, the price paid by the winning developer for the quota of construction land is the quotation. Third, when developer i only obtains construction land, the winning developer\u2019s quotation in the first stage is less than the maximum quotation of n\u22121 losers. Furthermore, the maximum quotation of the losing developer in the second stage is greater than the winning developer and other n\u22122 losing developers. In this case, the price paid by the developer for construction land is zero. Therefore, the expected income of the quota auction of construction land in the first stage can be calculated.

            "text": "The equilibrium solution of construction land quota and the farmers\u2019 expected income under the first- and second-price sealed-bid sequential auctions is summarized in Table 4:\nAccording to Table 4, due to the existence of selection, all developers enter the second-\nstage construction land auction with and without selection. This induces a difference in expected income, thus improving the independent value of the first-stage construction land quota, namely the selection value. We find that the selection value of construction land quota can improve the quota equilibrium quotation and achieve the purpose of increasing farmers\u2019 expected income. In addition, we find that the number of developers participating in the auction will affect the quota and the balanced quotation of construction land. Numerous studies have also analyzed and discussed the number of developers [38\u201341]. Therefore, we posit:\nProposition 4. The selection improves the developers\u2019 equilibrium bidding price and\nfarmers\u2019 expected income.\nProof: First, we prove that the selection improves the construction land quota balanced quota-\ntion. Under the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction, according to Eq (11), the quota\nequilibrium quotation considering that the condition that there is no selection and when rL;Fj \u00bc 1 is:\nb I\ufffd 1i \u00f0vi\u00de \u00bc n 1 n vi \u00f020\u00de\nSubtracting Eq (11) from Eq (20), we get Db I 1i\u00f0vi\u00de \u00bc b I 1i\u00f0vi\u00de b I\ufffd 1i\u00f0vi\u00de \u00bc D I \u00f0rL;Fj\u00de. Because 0 \ufffd rL;Fj \ufffd 1 and n\ufffd2, we get D I \u00f0rL;Fj\u00de \u00bc 1 2n \u00f01 rL;Fj 2\u00de \ufffd 0 according to Eq (12).\nSimilarly, according to Eq (16), under the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, the equilibrium quotation for the construction land quota when the developer has no selection is b II 1 \u00f0vi\u00de \u00bc vi. Then, we can obtain Db II 1i\u00f0vi\u00de \u00bc D II \u00f0rL;Fj\u00de \ufffd 0 by subtraction. Therefore, no matter the first- or the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, the selection will improve the firststage developer\u2019s equilibrium bid for the construction land quota.\nNext, we show that the selection increases farmers\u2019 expected income. In the case of the first-\nprice sealed-bid sequential auction, in Eq (18), we set rL;Fj \u00bc 1 to obtain the farmer\u2019s expected income without selection:\nE\ufffd\u00bdRI\ufffd \u00bc n 1 n\u00fe 1 \u03b5n\u00fe1 \u00f021\u00de\nSubtracting Eq (21) from Eq (18), we get DE\u00bdRI\ufffd \u00bc E\u00bdRI\ufffd E\ufffd\u00bdRI\ufffd \u00bc 1 2n \u00f01 rL;Fj 2\u00de\u03b5n > 0.\nSimilarly, if rL;Fj \u00bc 1 is used in Eq (19), the expected income of farmers under the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction is E\ufffd RII\u00bd \ufffd \u00bc n 1n\u00fe1 \u03b5 n\u00fe1. Then, we can obtain DE\u00bdRII\ufffd \u00bc \u00f0n 2 2n rL;Fj 2 n 1 n rL;Fj \u00fe 1 2 \u00de\u03b5n > 0 by subtracting the formula. This proves that the selection increases farmers\u2019 expected income in the case of the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction. Further, when rL;Fj \u00bc 1, E \ufffd[RI] = E\ufffd[RII]. Then, the income equivalence theorem is satisfied. However, when rL;Fj 6\u00bc 1, E \ufffd[RI]6\u00bcE\ufffd[RII]. Then the income equivalence theorem is not valid; that is, the selection of construction land quota leads to the failure of the income equivalence theorem.\nQ.E.D. Proposition 4 shows that no matter the first- or second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, the selection can improve the equilibrium price of the developer on the construction land quota and farmers\u2019 expected income. Therefore, developers can achieve the right to choose the expected construction land by obtaining the construction land quota to reduce the degree of matching of the construction land in the second stage for developers who do not have the right to choose. Furthermore, they can obtain the bidding advantage in the second stage. For farmers, the hope is that the government can grant the construction land quota selection to improve their expected income. With regard to the government, it can give the right to use construction land quota selection. Furthermore, in the second stage, it should divide the developers participating in the auction into the selection and no selection classes. Intensify competition between construction land bidding stage developers to improve the equilibrium bidding of construction land quota, raising farmers\u2019 expected return, encouraging the enthusiasm of farmers reclamation, realize the reuse of a large number of idle homesteads in rural areas, and reallocating land resources is of great significance for promoting new urbanization in China.\nProposition 5. The greater the value of the selection to the developer, the higher the equi-\nlibrium price of the construction land quota and farmers\u2019 expected income.\nProof: First, we prove the relationship between the value of the selection and the equilib-\nrium quotation of the construction land: that is, we prove that the land depreciation coefficient rL;Fj is negatively correlated with the equilibrium quotation of the land. In the first- and\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 13 / 25\nsecond-price sealed-bid sequential auctions, the partial derivatives of Eqs (11) and (16) against the land depreciation coefficient rL;Fj can are @bI 1i @rL;Fj \u00bc rL;Fj n \ufffd 0 and @bII 1i @rL;Fj \u00bc n 2n rL;Fj n 1 n \ufffd n 1n \u00f0rL;Fj 1\u00de \ufffd 0, respectively. Therefore, whether it is the first- or the second-price sealedbid sequential auction, there is a negative correlation between the land devaluation coefficient and the balanced quotation of construction land quota. That is, with a decrease in rL;Fj , for a greater degree of construction land devaluation for the developers who have no right of selection, they will improve the balanced quotation of the quota to obtain the right of selection of the quota. This is because the smaller rL;Fj is, the lower the degree of matching between the construction land auctioned in the second stage and the expected construction land of the developer without selection, and the lower the applicability of the project to be developed by the developer. Therefore, the developer is willing to pay a higher equilibrium price for the quota selection.\nThen, we prove the relationship between the value of the selection and the balanced quota-\ntion of the construction land quota. That is, we prove that the land depreciation coefficient rL;Fj is negatively correlated with farmers\u2019 expected income. According to Eqs (18) and (19), rL;Fj 2 \u00bd0; 1\ufffd, and n\ufffd2, we can find that the first order partial derivatives of farmers\u2019 expected income to land depreciation coefficient under the first- and second-price sealed-bid sequential auctions are @E\u00bdRI \ufffd @rL;Fj \u00bc 1n \u03b5 nrL;Fj \ufffd 0 and @E\u00bdRII \ufffd @rL;Fj \u00bc \u00f0n 2n rL;Fj n 1 n \u00de\u03b5 n \ufffd n 1n\u00fe1 \u00f0rL;Fj 1\u00de\u03b5 n \ufffd 0, respectively. Thus, we prove that whether it is the first- or second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, the greater the value of the selection to the developer, the higher the farmers\u2019 expected income.\nQ.E.D. Proposition 5 shows that the greater the value of the selection to the developer\u2013that is, the smaller the land depreciation coefficient\u2013farmers can get higher expected income. A smaller coefficient means that the degree of matching between the construction land and the land expected by the developer without the selection is lower, and the degree of depreciation of the selected construction land to the developer without the selection is higher. Therefore, for the developers who have the right to choose, the selected construction land is the expected construction land of the proposed development project. This increases the degree of depreciation of the construction land to the developers who have no right to choose and improves their bidding advantages. For farmers, the higher the balanced price of construction land, the higher the expected income. For the government, it is necessary to expand the scope of alternative construction land to increase the matching difference between construction land and developers, thereby further intensifying the competition among developers. This will help improve the balanced quotation of construction land quota, increase farmers\u2019 income, effectively dispose of and make full use of idle land, standardize land market behavior, and promote the purpose of saving and intensive land use.\nProposition 6. The developer\u2019s equilibrium bidding price and farmers\u2019 expected income\nare always higher in the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction than in the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction.\nProof: First, we prove that the equilibrium quotation of the construction land quota is\nalways higher in the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction than that under the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction. Let D \ufffd b1i \u00bc b I 1i b II 1i denote the difference between the developer\u2019s equilibrium quotations for construction land quotas under these two types of auctions. From Eqs (11) and (16), we can show that \u0394\ufffd\u03b21i<0. That is, the developer\u2019s equilibrium price for construction land quotas is lower under the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction than that under the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 14 / 25\nNext, we prove that farmers\u2019 expected income is always higher under the second-price\nsealed-bid sequential auction than under the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction. Let \u0394\ufffdE [R] = E[RI]\u2212E[RII] denote the difference between the farmers\u2019 expected income under these two types of auctions. From Eqs (18) and (19), we can show that \u0394\ufffdE[R]\ufffd0. That is, farmers\u2019 expected income is higher under the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction than under the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction.\nQ.E.D. Proposition 6 shows that the developer\u2019s equilibrium quotation for construction land quotas and the farmers\u2019 expected income are always higher under the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction than in the first-price one. Therefore, for farmers, the hope is that the government will auction construction land quotas and construction land through the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, to obtain higher expected returns. For the government, providing the function of selecting the right of construction land quota and choosing the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction can increase the equilibrium bidding price of the construction land quota and farmers\u2019 expected income. The allocation of land provides a theoretical basis for promoting the overall development of China\u2019s urban and rural areas, optimizing the structure of urban and rural land use, and improving the rural land transfer system.\nProposition 7. The number of developers is negatively correlated with the equilibrium\nbidding price of construction land quotas and farmers\u2019 expected income.\nProof: First, we prove the negative correlation between the number of developers and the\nequilibrium quotation of construction land quotas. Under the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction, according to Eqs (11) and (12), the first-order partial derivative of the equilibrium quotation of construction land quota with respect to the number of developers is @bI 1i\u00f0vi\u00de @n \u00bc vi n\u00f01 rL;Fj 2\u00de n2 \ufffd vi n n2 \ufffd 0. Similarly, according to Eqs (16) and (17), the first-order partial derivative of the equilibrium quotation under the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction with respect to the number of developers participating in the auction can be obtained as @bII 1i\u00f0vi\u00de @n \u00bc \u00f0n 2\u00derL;Fj n n 1 n \ufffd n 1 n \u00f0rL;Fj 1\u00de \ufffd 0. Thus, under both auctions, the number of developers is negatively correlated with the equilibrium quotation of the quota.\nThen, we prove the negative correlation between the number of developers and farmers\u2019\nexpected income. According to Eq (18), the first-order partial derivative of the expected income of farmers with respect to the number of developers under the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction is:\n@E\u00bdRI\ufffd @n \u00bc 2 \u00f0n\u00fe 1\u00de2 \u03b5n\u00fe1 \u00fe n 1 n\u00fe 1 \u03b5n\u00fe1ln\u03b5 \u00f01 rL;Fj 2\u00de 2n2 \u03b5n \u00fe \u00f01 rL;Fj 2\u00de 2n \u03b5nln\u03b5\n\u00bc \u03b5n\u00fe1\n\u00f0n\u00fe 1\u00de2 \u00bd2\u00fe \u00f0n2 1\u00deln\u03b5\ufffd \u00fe\n\u00f01 rL;Fj 2\u00de\n2n2 \u03b5n\u00f0nln\u03b5 1\u00de\n\u00f022\u00de\nLet X \u00bc \u03b5n\u00fe1 \u00f0n\u00fe1\u00de2 \u00bd2\u00fe \u00f0n2 1\u00deln\u03b5\ufffd and Y \u00bc \u00f01 rL;Fj 2\u00de 2n2 \u03b5 n\u00f0nln\u03b5 1\u00de.

According to data from the Chongqing\nLand Exchange, the quota transaction price of construction land is much smaller than the transaction price of construction land at approximately 0.1 times the price of the land.

That is, under the condition of the selection of construction\nland quota, whether under the first- or the second-price sealed-bid sequential auctions, the number of developers participating in the auction is negatively correlated with the equilibrium quotation of the construction land quota.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 15 / 25\nQ.E.D. Proposition 7 shows that regardless of whether the first- or second-price sealed-bid sequentially auction occurs, the quota equilibrium quotation and the number of developers are negatively correlated. Therefore, the government grants the right to choose construction land quotas. At the same time, by reasonably controlling and improving the structure of the number of developers participating in the auction, the balanced quotation of the construction land quotas can be increased, and farmers\u2019 income and enthusiasm for reclamation can be improved. The problem of a large number of idle homesteads in the rural areas of our country today ensures the effective use of rural land resources and promotes the scientific development of urban and rural areas."

Based on the practice and the model, it is assumed that all developers\u2019 estimates of the quota and construction land are random numbers of [0.0.1] and [0,1] respectively. Meanwhile, the equilibrium quotation can be obtained by solving (Tables 5 and 6).\nThis study is based on Maskin and Riley\u2019s [42] method. Let n2[2,12]. Then, we carry out a numerical analysis of the transaction prices of construction land quotas in the first- and the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction as shown in Figs 1 and 2, respectively:\nThe triangle line and the star line in Figs 1 and 2, respectively, represent the developer\u2019s\ntransaction price for the construction land quota when there is an selection under the firstand the second-price sealed-bid sequential auctions, respectively. The dotted line represents the developer\u2019s price for construction land quota when there is no selection. Notably, whether it is a first- or a second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, the developer\u2019s transaction price\nfor construction land quotas with the selection is significantly higher than without the selection, thus demonstrating Proposition 4. In addition, there is a negative correlation between the number of developers and the transaction price of the quotas when there is a right to choose. This verifies the research conclusions of S\u00f8rensen [20], Wang and Liu [39], Zhang and Wang [40], and Jing and Li [41], among others, and demonstrates Proposition 7. Therefore, to achieve the goal of reducing and reusing a large number of idle homesteads in rural areas, the government increases the transaction price of the quotas by granting the right to choose the quotas while reasonably controlling the number of developers participating in the auction of the quotas.\nFig 3 show whether the first- or the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction is better for\nconstruction land quota transaction prices when there is a right of selection:\nNotably, for both auctions, the land depreciation coefficient and the transaction price are\nnegatively correlated. This conclusion is consistent with Leufkens et al. [43]. With the increase in the degree of matching between the construction land selected by the winning developer and the expected construction land, the greater the land degree of devaluation brought by the selection right to the loser developer, the greater the increase in the bidding difference between the winning and the losing developers in the second stage of construction land auction. This improves the transaction price of the construction land quota. Thus, proposition 5 is proven.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 17 / 25\nFig 3 also shows that the transaction price of construction land quota under the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction is significantly higher, which is contrary to the conclusion of Leufkens et al. [30]. This is because the private value assumed by Leufkens et al. [30] is certain. However, here, both the construction land quota and the construction land value are the developer\u2019s private information. Thus, proposition 6 is proven. In addition, in the first-price sealedbid sequential auction, since the quota transaction price is the developer\u2019s highest quotation, the higher the value of the construction land quota to the developer, the higher the transaction price. In the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, the quota transaction price is the developer\u2019s second highest quotation. Therefore, with a higher value of construction land quota to the developer, the developers with the second highest quotation will increase. Consequently, the price of the quota will approach the real price. Therefore, the transaction price of the construction land quota first increases and finally tends to be flat."

Thus, let \u03b5 \u2013 0.1. The relationship between selection rights and farmers\u2019 income under firstand second-price sealed-bid sequential auctions are more clearly illustrated in Figs 4 and 5:\nIn Figs 4 and 5, the triangle and star lines represent farmers\u2019 income when they have the\nright of selection under the first- and second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, respectively. The dashed line represents farmers\u2019 income when there is no right of selection. Notably, in either auctions, farmers\u2019 income is always significantly higher when there is a right of selection than when there is none, thus proving proposition 4. Meanwhile, with the increase in the number of developers participating in the auction, farmers\u2019 income will decrease. This happens no matter whether they have the right of selection or not, thereby proving proposition 7.\nThe farmers\u2019 income under the first- and second-price sealed-bid sequential auctions, and\nthe change of farmers\u2019 income with the land depreciation coefficient when there is the right of selection are shown in Fig 6:\nFig 6 shows that no matter the first- or second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, there is a\nnegative correlation between the land depreciation coefficient and farmers\u2019 income.

This improves the value of the quota selection and farmers\u2019 income. Thus, proposition 5 is proved. Meanwhile, the star line is clearly above the triangle line; that is, the revenue of the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction is significantly higher than that of the first-price one. This proposition extends the research hypothesis of Vickrey [44] and Myerson [45], and obtains the same result as Maskin and Riley [42], thus proving proposition 6. In the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction, farmers\u2019 income is the highest bid of the developer for the construction land quota. Therefore, the higher the value of the construction land quota is for the developer, the more clearly farmers\u2019 income increases. In the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction, farmers\u2019 income is the second highest quotation of construction land quota from developers. Therefore, with the higher value of construction land quota to developers, the developers\u2019 valuation of the second highest quotation will gradually approach the real price of construction land quota. Therefore, farmers\u2019 income tends to be flat in the end."

Furthermore, we compare the equilibrium bidding strategy of bidders and farmers\u2019 expected income under the two auction methods, and designs a more reasonable quota auction pricing mechanism. Finally, we use numerical analysis to verify the model and conclusions. The results show that the quota selection of construction land improves the bidding price of the quota and farmers\u2019 income. Furthermore, the value of the selection to developers is positively correlated with the bidding quotation of construction land quota and farmers\u2019 income. That is, the lower the degree of matching between the selected construction land and the developers without the selection, the higher the price developers are willing to pay for the quota and higher the farmers\u2019 income. Besides, the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction has higher construction land quota bidding price and farmers\u2019 income than the first-price auction. Third, there is a negative correlation between the number of developers participating in the auction, and the quota bidding quotation and farmers\u2019 income.\nThese findings show that local governments can improve the value of construction land\nquotas. In the transaction practice of construction land and its quotas, developers can choose the expected land, thus obtaining more valuable quotas. This will improve the quotation of the quotas, ensure the income of farmers reclaiming the idle homestead, and improve the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075.g005\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 21 / 25\nenthusiasm of farmers\u2019 reclamation, thereby accelerating the process of land use for rural construction in China. Furthermore, choosing the second-price sealed-bid sequential sealed auction can better reflect the value of construction land quota, relieve the pressure of urban construction land demand, improve the exit rate of rural idle homesteads, realize land resource reallocation, and solve the contradiction between the rapid growth of construction land demand and the idle waste of a large number of rural homesteads. In addition, we should improve the qualification requirements of developers, increase the number of developers participating in the bidding, improve the pricing system of construction land quota, increase farmers\u2019 reclamation income, narrow the gap between urban and rural areas, further help poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, and ensure the healthy and stable operation of construction land quota market.\nLastly, there are some limitations in this study and corresponding future research directions. The model used here studies a two-stage sequential auction and each stage only has a single item. However, in practice, there will be numerous homogeneous items auctioned at each stage. In the sequential auction of homogeneous items, there may be a decline in the prices of post-auction items and the phenomenon of \"abnormal price decreases\" [46]. This will impact the auction strategy of construction land quotas. These points require further research.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075.g006\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263075 January 25, 2022 22 / 25"
