    "abstractText": "In this research, the one\u2010step synthesis of novel porphyrin\u2010based nanocomposites was performed easily using a photochemical under visible light illumination strategy. As a result, the focus of this research is on synthesizing and using decorated ZnTPP (zinc(II)tetrakis(4\u2010phenyl)porphyrin) nanoparticles with Ag, Ag/AgCl/Cu, and Au/Ag/AgCl nanostructures as antibacterial agents. Initially, ZnTPP NPs were synthesized as a result of the self\u2010assembly of ZnTPP. In the next step, in a visible\u2010 light irradiation photochemically process, the self\u2010assembled ZnTPP nanoparticles were used to make ZnTPP/Ag NCs, ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, and ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs. A study on the antibacterial activity of nanocomposites was carried out for Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus as pathogen microorganisms by the plate count method, well diffusion tests, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values determination. Thereafter, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by the flow cytometry method. All the antibacterial tests and the flow cytometry ROS measurements were carried out under LED light and in dark. The (3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was applied to investigate the cytotoxicity of the ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, against Human foreskin fibroblast (HFF\u20101) normal cells. Due to the specific properties such as admissible photosensitizing properties of porphyrin, mild reaction conditions, high antibacterial properties in the presence of LED light, crystal structure, and green synthesis, these nanocomposites were recognized as kinds of antibacterial materials that are activated in visible light, got the potential for use in a broad range of medical applications, photodynamic therapy, and water treatment.",

As a result, the focus of this research is on synthesizing and using decorated ZnTPP (zinc(II)tetrakis(4\u2011phenyl)porphyrin) nanoparticles with Ag, Ag/AgCl/Cu, and Au/Ag/AgCl nanostructures as antibacterial agents. Initially, ZnTPP NPs were synthesized as a result of the self\u2011assembly of ZnTPP. In the next step, in a visible\u2011 light irradiation photochemically process, the self\u2011assembled ZnTPP nanoparticles were used to make ZnTPP/Ag NCs, ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, and ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs. A study on the antibacterial activity of nanocomposites was carried out for Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus as pathogen microorganisms by the plate count method, well diffusion tests, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values determination. Thereafter, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by the flow cytometry method. All the antibacterial tests and the flow cytometry ROS measurements were carried out under LED light and in dark. The (3\u2011(4,5\u2011dimethylthiazol\u20112\u2011yl)\u20112,5\u2011diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was applied to investigate the cytotoxicity of the ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, against Human foreskin fibroblast (HFF\u20111) normal cells. Due to the specific properties such as admissible photosensitizing properties of porphyrin, mild reaction conditions, high antibacterial properties in the presence of LED light, crystal structure, and green synthesis, these nanocomposites were recognized as kinds of antibacterial materials that are activated in visible light, got the potential for use in a broad range of medical applications, photodynamic therapy, and water treatment.\nIn recent years, experimental and industrial achievements in nanotechnology have spawned a new approach in applied sciences, resulting in the growth of interdisciplinary activities in industries, the environment, and medicine1\u20133. Due to the importance of preventing harmful bacterial damage, antibacterial agents are being developed. As a result, nanomaterials are very beneficial treatments regarded due to their particular qualities against bacterial infections caused by misuse of antibiotics, which has led to bacterial resistance and a global threat to human health. Furthermore, the creation of biocompatible antibacterial agents is one of the most pressing topics for scientists4,5. E. coli is a pernicious pathogen and a gram-negative bacillus. As well, the eradication of E. coli is becoming increasingly challenging. Humans get diarrhea from Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) bacteria after drinking contaminated water. As a result, a healthy drinking water supply is critical to human health6,7.\nThe porphin core\u2019s sturdy macrocyclic structure makes it a good anchoring point for metal atom complexation8,9. The studies of porphyrins synthesis, structure, assemblies, and applications have always intrigued the scientific community10. Porphyrins are species of supramolecules and have a wide range of photophysical and photochemical properties, high photosensitizing efficiencies, superior energy, electron transfer capacities, and excellent light-harvesting potential including strong light absorption in the visible region while their energy levels can be easily adjusted to match those of donor materials using a suitable molecular design11,12. Porphyrins are also widely utilized in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy13\u201315.\nOPEN\n1Inorganic Group, Department of Chemistry, Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran\u00a016846-13114,\u00a0Iran.\u00a02Organic and Nano Group (ONG), Department of Chemistry, Iran University of Science and\u00a0Technology\u00a0(IUST),\u00a0PO\u00a0Box\u00a016846-13114,\u00a0Tehran,\u00a0Iran. *email: rahimi_rah@iust.ac.ir; rostamnia@iust.ac.ir\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:8580 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34745-0\nFree radicals, or more likely singlet oxygen, can be generated by the light-exposed porphyrin. This process is dependent on the type of porphyrin as a photosensitizer and light source employed. These species are extremely reactive and can interact with nearly every cell component, including protein, lipid, and nucleic acid. Some reactive by-products, such as reactive oxygen species, can be produced as a result of this interaction (ROS). These species can cause further harm and cell death16.\nMetallic nanoparticles, particularly silver (Ag) nanoparticles, have been demonstrated to be potent antibacterial agents with a wide range of antibacterial activity17,18. Nanomaterials including copper, are of tremendous interest because of their widespread availability, inexpensive cost, and similarities to noble metal characteristics. As well it can also be used as a bactericidal and antimicrobial agent to coat hospital equipment19,20. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are emerging as ideal candidates because of their significant biomedical efficacy21,22. By combining materials with potential properties, new materials with better and more effective performance can be created. In this work, we synthesized multi-component nanocomposites containing ZnTPP nanostructures and several metal components in the form of ZnTPP/Ag NCs, ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, and ZnTPP/Au/Ag/ AgCl NCs by using the photochemical method. As well, we proved the effectiveness of these nanoparticles by examining these nanoparticles via LED lamp light on two types of human pathogenic bacteria. In addition, an important advantage of this nanocomposite is the better killing of E. coli compared to S. aureus bacteria in the presence of light can be mentioned for photodynamic therapy studies. Moreover, the antibacterial potential of synthesized nanocomposites was also studied using the MIC method against the most common drug-resistant microorganisms in the medical field which was examined in dark and LED light in the presence of nanocomposites. The synergistic effect of these metals was investigated in the available approach and recommended as a workable method for use in removing bacterial contaminants from drinking water and medicinal properties (Fig.\u00a01)."

In the synthesis of bi-metallic porphyrin-based nanocomposites, we utilized the values of the salt consumption ratio as follows (Fig.\u00a01): 100% of AgNO3, (50\u00a0mM) was used as a salt solution in the synthesis of the \u201cA\u201d nanocomposite. 50% of AgNO3 with 50% of CuCl2\u00b72H2O was applied in the synthesis of the \u201cB\u201d nanocomposite. By utilizing 33% of AgNO3, and 33% of CuCl2\u00b72H2O, and 33% of HAuCl4\u00b73H2O salts in the synthesis of the nanocomposite, we gained the compound which was attributed to the ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs (\u201cG\u201d nanocomposite).\nThe synthesized nanocomposite properties were studied identification in terms of the EDX spectrum, mapping analysis, UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy, FE-SEM images, PXRD pattern, FT-IR analysis, and TEM images. Furthermore, antibacterial properties are studied by an agar disk diffusion, MIC, MBC, and colony counter method in the presence of nanocomposite with LED light and dark. The role of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the antibacterial mechanism of the ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, the nanocomposite with the best antibacterial result, was studied by flow cytometry under LED light and dark as well. The cytotoxicity of ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs was evaluated on human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-1) cells by MTT test.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a02Ab the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of self-assembled ZnTPP (ZnTPP NPs) revealed the diffraction peaks at (001), (110), (200), (112), (020), (201), (400), (130) corresponding to the data from the published crystal structure (CCDC, Ref. code ZNTPOR03) octahedrons simulated which was shown in Fig.\u00a02Aa 28. In the XRD pattern of ZnTPP/Ag NCs (Fig.\u00a02Ac) four sharp peaks were indicated at 2\u03b8 = 38.24\u00b0, 44.44\u00b0, 64.69\u00b0, 77.64\u00b0 corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystalline surfaces of Ag nanoparticles, respectively29,30. Figure\u00a02Ad demonstrates the XRD pattern which was attributed to the ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs. The peaks at 27.96\u00b0, 32.40\u00b0, 46.40\u00b0, 54.96\u00b0, 57.64\u00b0 can be assigned to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400) AgCl crystalline surfaces31. Additionally, the peaks at 2\u03b8 = 38.32\u00b0, 44.40\u00b0, and 77.64\u00b0 were attributed to the (111), (220), (111) planes of metallic Ag nanoparticles32. Since the amount of copper in the synthesized ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs was below 5% by weight according to the EDS analysis, the peaks of copper are not seen in the XRD pattern of the sample (Fig.\u00a02Ad).\nIn the XRD pattern that was shown in Fig.\u00a02Ae, the peaks at 29.68\u00b0, 56.68\u00b0, and 59.32\u00b0 specified (111), (311), and (222) AgCl reflection planes. Moreover, the peaks at 39.96\u00b0, 48.12\u00b0, and 78.66\u00b0 can be attributed to (111), (220), and (311) crystalline surfaces of Au and Ag nanoparticles36.

The Soret band is an intense band ranging around 400\u00a0nm which is common for all porphyrins. Moreover, the\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:8580 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34745-0\nweaker bands in the region of 500\u2013600\u00a0nm that are quadruple bands for porphyrin free base and double bands for metalloporphyrins are Q bands. At zinc coordination and metal complex formation, the Soret band at 421.5\u00a0nm and two weak Q bands at 557 and 596\u00a0nm appeared. Additionally, after metal complexation, a red shift in the Soret band occurred. The molecular symmetry increasing from D2h to D4h led to a change in the number of Q bands from four to two in the metal complex which confirmed the ZnTPP formation (Fig.\u00a02Bb). The UV\u2013Vis spectrum for aggregated ZnTPP (ZnTPP NPs) is demonstrated in Fig.\u00a02Bc. The broad bands significantly are observed. It seems the existence of metal\u2013ligand coordination and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions involve the tuning of aggregations. Furthermore, in the electronic absorption spectra of other aggregated nanostructure compounds, ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, ZnTPP/Ag NCs, and ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs, the Soret band at 421.5\u00a0nm and two weak Q bands at 557 and 596\u00a0nm are observed (Fig.\u00a02Bd\u2013f) respectively. As shown in Fig.\u00a02Ca\u2013f, the IR spectra of H2TPP, ZnTPP, ZnTPP NPs, ZnTPP/Ag NCs, ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs, and were demonstrated respectively. In addition, it is known that the Ag and Au nanoparticles have the absorption peaks in the Soret (around 420\u00a0nm) and Q peaks (500\u2013650\u00a0nm) region of the metalloporphyrin compounds respectively37\u201339. Therefore, the possibility of the overlap of silver nanoparticles absorption with the Soret peak seems logical in the ZnTPP/Ag NCs, ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs.\nThe observed signals at 2850 and 2921\u00a0 cm\u22121 in the Infrared spectra of H2TPP, ZnTPP, and ZnTPP NPs, and all porphyrinic compounds, assigned to the vibrational stretching mode of aliphatic C\u2013H, and signals at 1265 and 1000\u20131350\u00a0 cm\u22121 indicated the vibrational mode of C\u2013N. The presence of the signals at 3317 and 966\u00a0 cm\u22121 are allotted to the stretching and bending vibration of N\u2013H within the pyrrole ring respectively. Moreover, the nonappearance of these two signals in the spectra of ZnTPP indicates the zinc coordination in the complex. The\nFigure\u00a02.

Moreover, regarding the spectrum of H2TPP, the signal at 1606\u00a0 cm\u22121, which is attributed to the C=N stretching vibration of pyrrole, splits into two peaks at around 1595 and 1652\u00a0 cm\u22121 indicating the presence of the Zn\u2013N coordination band in the spectra of the prepared ZnTPP NPs which have shifted to 1630 and 1750 nanocomposites formation24,40\u201342.\nThe FE-SEM images of synthesized ZnTPP NPs were demonstrated in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1 which confirms the octahedral morphology of ZnTPP NPs. Figure\u00a03a\u2013c shows the FE-SEM images of ZnTPP/Ag NCs. The existence of the sphere form of Ag nanoparticles was illustrated. The general and pointwise Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was accomplished (Fig.\u00a03d\u2013f). Moreover, in Fig.\u00a04a\u2013f the elemental mapping analysis of prepared ZnTPP/Ag NCs is shown indicating the presence of Ag NPs with a specified distribution. The FESEM images and EDS analysis of synthesized ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs were shown in Fig.\u00a05a\u2013c and Fig.\u00a05d\u2013f respectively. In the morphological investigation of nanostructures, the cubic-like of particles are seen which is attributed to the Cu compounds in matching with the elemental mapping analysis of prepared ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/ Cu NCs (Fig.\u00a06a\u2013g). Furthermore, other nanoparticles obtained Ag district are attributed to the existence of Ag and AgCl nanoparticles concluded compared with the results of the EDS and XRD analysis. In the FE-SEM images of ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs, the presence of Au nanoparticles is seen (Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c). The obtained general and pointwise EDS analysis confirm the particular districts which contain AgCl and Au nanoparticles individually (Fig.\u00a07d\u2013f). The specific distribution of nanoparticles has been specified in the elemental mapping analysis of prepared ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs (Fig.\u00a08a\u2013h).\nThe collection of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs, the synthesized nanocomposite with the best antibacterial performance, led to the investigation of the size and morphology of the particles of this nanocomposite. The nanoparticles with about 5\u201310\u00a0nm are observed interconnected with the nanocomposite structure (Fig.\u00a09a\u2013f). Evaluating the results of the analysis with the obtained FE-SEM and TEM images together confirms the formation of the obtained multi-component nanocomposites.\nAntibacterial activity appraisement of synthesized porphyrin\u2011based nanocomposites Procedure for antibacterial studies with nanocomposite. Samples and glassware were sterilized in an autoclave at 121\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min before each microbiological test. The average pH was kept at roughly 7.4, which is the physiological pH. The bactericide experiment included Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms such as S. aureus (ATCC 25923) and E. coli (ATCC 25922). For colony counting tests, MBC and the inhibition zone method, Mueller\u2013Hinton agar-containing plates were employed as a microorganism growth medium, also, Nutrient Broth media was used for MIC, as well as, the 0.5McFarland turbidity as a standard to the antibacterial test.

In this regard, the effect of treatments of synthesized ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl NCs on intracellular ROS for S. aureus (ATCC 25923) and E. coli (ATCC 25922) was investigated by flow cytometry under light and dark as well.\nAntibacterial activity screening (ZOI study). To investigate the antibacterial activity, the most practicable Agar well diffusion method approach was used. Therefore, the agar well diffusion can be used to test microbial susceptibility to these concentrations of 1\u00a0mL (10\u00a0mg) of nanocomposites in the presence of these two pathogen bacteria at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, Muller-Hinton agar was used as a foundation medium as well as a solid growth media for microorganisms. First, 0.5 McFarland turbidity suspensions of these two bacteria were generated. About 20 ccs of the medium are put aseptically into sanitized Petri dishes after cooling.using a sterile glass hockey stick, the culture (cell concentration was adjusted to 107\u00a0cells/mL) was dispersed across the surface of the solidified agar plates. Correspondingly (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2). The ZOI (zones of inhibition) surrounding the circle-tested samples assess their antibacterial efficacy against two important pathogens, E. coli, and S. aureus.\nFigure\u00a08.

The results of the zones of inhibition of diameter for E. coli and S. aureus in dark and under light conditions were represented in column charts in Fig.\u00a010.\nMIC and MBC determination. In this study, For the first time, we selected two 96-well microplates for the study of MIC and MBC with LED light and dark on two types of pathogenic bacteria E.coli and S. aureus, in the presence of ZnTPP/Ag NCs (A), ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs (B), and ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs (G), with serial dilution method, considering that the first well had the highest concentration of 5000\u00a0ppm (\u00b5g/mL) and Finally, we sorted the last well with the lowest concentration of 9.7\u00a0 ppm (\u00b5g/mL) nanocomposite and finally added (1 \u00d7 105\u00a0 CFU/mL)bacteria to each well to the Muller Hinton Broth (MHB) culture medium in both 96-well microplates. One well always had only the culture medium containing bacteria to control. Then one 96-well microplate was placed in LED light for 2\u00a0h and another microplate was placed in the dark for 2\u00a0h, then the microplate was incubated for about 18\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, then from 6 houses that had a clear Broth culture in order Determination of concentration of nanocomposites or other words MIC and MBC were poured on a plate containing Casein-peptone Soymeal-peptone Agar (CASO Agar) and after 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C incubator (Fig.\u00a011a,b, Supplementary Figs.\u00a0S3, S4) respectively.\nThe MIC test results in dark and under light conditions for E. coli and S. aureus were evaluated in Supplementary Tables\u00a0S2, and S3 respectively. A well microplate in which bacteria did not grow as MBC means and the lowest bactericidal concentration of nanocomposite bacteria were selected and the microplate house before MBC was selected as the highest bactericidal inhibitory concentration MIC. Figure\u00a011b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4, and Supplementary Tables\u00a0S4, and S5 represent the MBC plates and their result values respectively. Finally, ZnTPP/ Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs (B) nanocomposite had the highest antibacterial potency compared to ZnTPP/Ag NCs (A) and ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs (G) nanocomposites. Both pathogenic bacteria were reported as gram-positive and gram-negative. Samples A and B were observed in the LED light exposure with more antibacterial properties than in the dark state and G nanocomposites in the dark state with more antibacterial power than the LED light irritation. Figure\u00a012 demonstrates the results of the obtained MIC and MBC values for S. aureus (ATCC 25923) and E. coli (ATCC 25922) in dark and after 2\u00a0h exposure to LED light.\nPlate\u2011count method. The adjustment was made to a diluted 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. For the colony count procedure, 0.1\u00a0mL of DMSO was added to Mueller Hinton Broth culture media. The acquired opacity solution was then divided into two portions for each bacterium and placed in two different flasks. Nanocomposite (0.01\u00a0g) was added to one of the solutions under LED illumination and the remaining flask has in dark. Then the obtained results for S. aureus and E. coli in dark and under light conditions were fully evaluated in Supplementary Tables\u00a0S6, S7, S8, and S9 respectively. The Photographs of CFU of E. coli and S. aureus in the presence and absence of nanocomposites with LED light and dark after 10, 30, and 120\u00a0min are shown in Supplementary Figs.\u00a0S5, and S6 respectively. According to the results obtained from the viable count tests in the presence of A, B, and G nanocomposites and the very good performance of nanocomposites A and B in exposed to LED lamps than dark mode on the bacterium E. coli and S. aureus, at times 10\u00a0min, 30\u00a0min and 2\u00a0h can be mentioned according to the column charts which have been represented in Fig.\u00a013.\nG nanocomposite was reported to have slightly better antibacterial in the dark than in the light while the performance of B nanocomposite was phenomenal. The colony method also revealed the existence of inactivated (killed) E. coli (ATCC 25922) bacteria and S. aureus (ATCC 25923) in the presence of these nanocomposites.\nFigure\u00a010. Column charts representing the amounts of the zone of inhibition of diameter for S. aureus and E. coli, in the presence of A (ZnTPP/Ag NCs), B (ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs), and G (ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs), in dark and LED light after 24\u00a0h.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:8580 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34745-0\nFinally, they were found to be effective against two harmful bacteria strains. The reduction percentages for S. aureus and E. coli were expressive of the antibacterial activity of each nanocomposite in dark and under LED light (Fig.\u00a014).\nFigure\u00a011.

DCFDA (10\u00a0mL; Sigma, Life Technologies C6827) was aggravated to the cells and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 25\u00a0min. The DCFDA fluorescent probe reacts with intracellular H2O2 to procreate fluorescence emission which can be indicated by flow cytometry. Mensuration of the intracellular H2O2 production in SACS, ere and since culture, was done by flow cytometry using DCFDA. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then centrifuged at 2500g for 5\u00a0min. green fluorescence emission was measured between 500 and 530\u00a0nm using a flow cytometry machine.\nThe flow cytometry ROS evaluation was also done under dark and LED light as well. The multi roles of ROS in bacterial replication to antibacterial agents have been confirmed by evidence43. Here the results of the measurements of produced intracellular ROS in E. coli and S. aureus, after treatment with ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs have been represented in Figs.\u00a015, and 16 respectively.

For E. coli bacteria the ROS increased after treatment with ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs under both dark and light conditions while more increase under light occurred. For S. aureus bacteria, after treatment, the increase in ROS production was obtained in dark and light. Although the under-light enhancement was more than the dark condition for S. aureus bacteria as well, however, the surplus increase of ROS for E. Coli bacteria was seen under light.\nMechanism for antibacterial activity of nanocomposite. Flow cytometry was used to investigate the mechanism of antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite on E. coli and S. aureus bacteria. ROS is thought to be a key role in nanomaterial\u2019s antibacterial properties, as it can harm the cell membrane, phospholipids, and/ or membrane proteins directly. Among the biologically relevant ROS, superoxide (O2.\u2212) is arising from electron transfer processes43. Nanomaterials with the ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be a useful\nFigure\u00a014.

PDT relies on the production of 1O2 as the predominant cytotoxic ROS for its lethal effects. It reacts with more than one target within a cell including DNA bases, proteins, and cholesterol found in cell membranes. Porphyrin, as a photosensitizer, could cause the surrounding oxygens to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to a broad spectrum of light46,47. Ag and AgCl NPs have antibacterial synergies in ROS production48,49. In addition, Because of the visible bang gap of Porphyrin-based nanocomposites, they are favorable compounds to produce superoxide under an LED light. According to the reported article, the synthesized nanocomposite has antibacterial activities on E. coli and S. aureus, and the attendance of nanocomposite and in the presence of light has been linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The bacteria were harmed as a result of ROS generation damaging the membranes (Fig.\u00a017).\nFigure\u00a016.

The nanocomposite structure, morphology, and antibacterial capabilities have all been evaluated using a variety of analytical methods. Fe-SEM images confirmed the octahedral structure, as well as the great dispersion of, Au, Cu, and Ag NPs on the ZnTPP NPs surface. These nanocomposites also had outstanding antibacterial characteristics in the presence of light. Agar disk diffusions, MBC. MIC, colony counting experiment, and ROS Flow cytometry analysis were used to examine the antibacterial property of these nanocomposites against E. coli and S. aureus. All of the antibacterial tests and the intracellular ROS evaluation were examined in the dark and under LED light as well. ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs nanocomposite performed better in the presence of light with a MIC value of less than 9.5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, while ZnTPP/Au/Ag/AgCl NCs efficiency of this nanocomposite was better in the dark. The cytotoxicity of ZnTPP/Ag/AgCl/Cu NCs against HFF-1 cells was investigated. According to the findings, these nanocomposites could be used with almost consistent efficiency in water purification and industrial applications. Also, it has the potential to be utilized in biotechnology and therapeutics. The use of such nanocomposites in in\u00a0vivo curative applications such as photodynamic therapy is thus a promising approach."
