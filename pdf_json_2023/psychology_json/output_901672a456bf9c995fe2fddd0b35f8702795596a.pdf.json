    "abstractText": "A novel dual functional and visual rhodamine ethylenediamine bis(triazolyl silsesquioxane) (RBS) chemosensor was successfully synthesized using \u201cclick\u201d chemistry. The results have unambiguously demonstrated that RBS can act in fluorescent and colorimetric sensing of Cu2+ and Zn2+ by their respective coordination with triazole structures and, more importantly, it has also been found that triazole-amide of RBS could turn on chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) of Cu2+. Remarkably, the addition of Cu2+ triggered an enhanced fluorescent emission by 63.3-fold (\u03c6F = 0.41), while Zn2+ enhanced it 48.3-fold (\u03c6F = 0.29) relative to the original RBS (\u03c6F = 0.006) in acetonitrile (MeCN) solvent. The fluorescent limit of detection for Cu2+ and Zn2+ is similar and fall within 3.0 nM, while under colorimetric sensing the responses were 2.14 \u00d7 10\u20138 and 4.0 \u00d7 10\u20138 mol  L\u22121, respectively. Moreover, the effective sensing profile of RBS and extended applications of RBS\u2013Cu2+ and RBS\u2013Zn2+ for fingerprinting detection and imaging were observed with adequate sensitivity, stability and legibility under the dual visual responses.",

            "text": "The design and synthesis of novel nanoscopic molecules that can recognize and detect cations and show specificity for biologically relevant metal ions have gained attention during the last decade [1]. Particularly, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Fe3+ play vital roles in several biological, environmental and chemical systems. These metal ions are essential trace elements for both plants and animals, including humans. Literature medical data reiterates that excess accumulation of Zn2+ has the propensity to alter Cu2+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ absorption in humans and eventually lead to a series of health problems [2]. While several expensive and time-consuming spectroscopic analytical techniques could detect and discriminate Zn2+, Cu2+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ among many other metals [3, 4], a more accurate and sensitive probe would be beneficial for detecting these biologically relevant cations.\nWithin this context, fluorescent and colorimetric sensors are appropriate alternative probes for Cu2+ and Zn2+ sensing [5\u201310]. Among common fluorophores, rhodamine derivatives are widely employed for detection of metal ions due to their variably distinguished properties such as (i) the ability to generate cell- and tissue-permeant labels for biological imaging and sensing, despite the photophysical equilibrium between the non-fluorescent lipophilic closed form and the open form of strongly fluorescent rhodamine derivates [11\u201314] and (ii) the ability to re-design a red-shifted longer wavelength absorbance/emission spectrum from a green to pinkish red colour for a fluorogenic and/or chromogenic response [13].\nTo turn on the fluorescence emission of rhodamine probes, a spirolactam ring must be opened [14]. One of the methods to achieve this consists in introducing a strongly chelating metal ion [15]. Several photoactive moieties, including rhodamine, have been effectively conjugated with appropriate binding units using \u201cclick\u201d-generated 1,2,3-triazole-based chemosensors for Zn2+, Cu2+ and Fe3+ [16\u201320]. For effective and efficient practical application of rhodamine triazolyl-based fluorogenic probes, photostability is a highly required feature that, unfortunately, remains unresolved. Indeed, we recently pioneered the synthesis of fluorescent-labeled triazolyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) for applications in forensic science [21, 22]. Taking advantage of the great versatility of the Cu(I)catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azides and alkynes (CuAAC), the obtained POSS nanohybrids showed excellent photostability and thermal properties, and were able to image fingerprints with good selectivity, sensitivity and\nlegibility. Several factors that underpin the candidature of POSS include the photostability showed by its triazolyl hybrids, together with their biocompatibility, facile functionalization and nano-dimensionality (0.5\u20130.7\u00a0nm) [23\u201327]. As we engaged in unprecedented advances vis-\u00e0-vis proof of concept of our ongoing work, we present herein the strategic design and synthesis of novel rhodamine-labeled bis(triazolyl)-POSS (RBS) using the popular CuAAC for selective sensing of Cu2+ and Zn2+ and extended the application for fingerprint imaging via (RBS-M2+)\u2013amino acid interaction. As far as we are aware, this is also the first example utilizing two binding profiles of bis-triazolyl-POSS rhodamine for dual functionality and visuality."

That both compounds were successfully obtained was confirmed upon proper characterization and comparison with literature data (Figs. S2\u2013S6) [20, 22]. Thereafter, the novel rhodamine bis(ethylenediamine triazolyl POSS), (i.e., RBS), was obtained in 82% yield by CuAAC reaction between PA and RED. 1H NMR spectra confirmed the structure of RBS with evidence of bis(triazole) protons (\u03b4 7.61\u00a0ppm, 2H) and rhodamine aromatic protons (\u03b4 6.4\u20138.4\u00a0ppm, 10H) (Fig. S7). Similarly, 13C NMR, 29Si NMR and mass spectra (Figs. S8, S9 and S10, respectively) also supported the structure of RBS. However, it draws attention the presence of a signal centered at 65.9\u00a0ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum, which indicates the closed form of the spirolactam ring (Fig. S8) [20]. The presence of 1,2,3-triazole groups in the RBS probe was also corroborated by FT-IR, which prominently exhibited \u2013N=N group and \u2013C\u2013N bonds in addition to the characteristic Si\u2013O\u2013Si of the POSS (Fig. S11).\n1 3\nWe explored its photophysical properties in different solvents which included absorption/emission bands, molar absorption coefficients, Stokes shifts, fluorescent quantum yields, emission rate constants, singlet energies and lifetimes (Fig. S12 and Table\u00a0S1). The absorption band in the UV region was clearly dominated by the rhodamine-type chromophore. Values of Stokes shifts were found to be solvent dependent, being markedly higher for polar media. Regarding fluorescence quantum yields (\u03d5F), RBS presented extremely poor values in all solvents in comparison with the parental rhodamine B (for instance, \u03d5F = 0.40 in acetonitrile) [12]. This fact could be attributed to the nearby POSS moieties that may influence the radiative and non-radiative pathways of the material, with the occurrence of aggregate formation. In this sense, the emission decay traces of RBS were satisfactorily fitted by a biexponential function. This was in full agreement with previously reported data for similar POSS nanohybrids containing dansyl chromophores [22]. Thus, the shorter lifetimes would be ascribed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state, in which an electron transfer from the amino group to the xanthene \u03c0-system, followed by rotation of the alkyl groups was occurring [29]. Meanwhile, the formation of aggregates could be responsible for the longer lifetimes. As previously established for the\nrhodamine dyes that can easily form aggregates in solution [30], when a locally excited (LE) state cannot be mixed with a charge transfer (CT) (or electron transfer) state, the interconversion from the LE to the CT results in fluorescence properties that are highly sensitive to steric environments, i.e., aggregation. This fact was indeed reflected in the contribution of the longer lifetime component, being the same or even higher, at moderately polar solvents, strengthening a major participation of aggregate formation. With the photophysical data in hands, RBS might be a potential candidate to be successfully applied as an \u201cOFF\u2013ON\u201d metal sensor, since the possible coordination could evade formation of the aggregates and enhance the radiative pathways."

            "text": "To establish the sensing capacity of RBS, we first evaluated its photophysical properties, focusing mainly on the emission property changes due to the low sensitivity that UV\u2013visible (absorbance) measurements usually exhibit. A solution (20\u00a0\u03bcM) of RBS was visually colorless and almost non-fluorescent in common solvents such as THF, MeCN or n-hexane (HEX) (Table\u00a01). This observation indicates the predominant existence of ring closed spirolactam form\n1 3\n[20]. Upon separate addition of several metal ion solutions to RBS, only Cu2+ and Zn2+ exhibited a strong fluorescent band (580\u00a0nm) with Cu2+ having stronger emission band (Fig.\u00a02). Under incremental addition of Cu2+ to RBS, the\nabsorption spectra supported the fluorescence spectra as shown in Fig. S13.\nThis observation indicates that only Cu2+ and Zn2+ from among the tested metal ions could coordinately chelate with RBS and, eventually, emit reddish pink and yellowish green\n1 3\nfluorescence, respectively. RBS\u2013Cu2+ and RBS\u2013Zn2+ with enhanced fluorescent profiles corroborated with a 63.3-fold (0.41) and 48.3-fold (0.29) enhanced quantum yield when compared with the highest achieved by RBS in MeCN (Table\u00a01). These results provide a platform for Cu2+ and Zn2+ sensing in either biological or environmental condition accompanied by structural transformation occasioned by ring opening of the spirocyclic unit via a \u201cturn-on\u201d chelation-enhanced fluorescent (CHEF) mechanism [31]. It is worth mentioning that we also tested additional monovalent and trivalent ions (i.e., Al3+, Fe3+, Cr3+, Na+, Ag+ and K+). However, titration experiments resulted in non-coordinated uncomplexed colloidal suspensions, which made further photophysical experiments rather difficult. Therefore, we limited in this study the probe responses to representative divalent metal ions shown in Fig.\u00a02A.\nDue to the overriding sensing performance of RBS for Cu2+, we performed titration experiments. The results indicated that the probe displays significant \u201cturn-on\u201d responses upon incremental addition of Cu2+ (0\u201325\u00a0\u03bcM ranging from 0 to 10 equiv) (Fig.\u00a03A). The corresponding absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S14.\nThe saturation point was easily reached with the addition of just 7 equiv of Cu2+, indicating tight binding. However, the reversibility of, in particular, RBS\u2013Cu2+ formation is underscored by a reversible color transition from reddish pink back to colorless upon addition of EDTA which brought down the emission intensity to the same level as in the original uncomplexed RBS (Fig.\u00a03B). Thereby, the loss of the spectroscopic features of the system due to the induced decomplexation process would be indicative of the restoring of the spirocyclic form. The equilibrium interchange [14] between the open and closed spirolactam ring in reversible motif prompted by EDTA addition could be an index for monitoring metal complex formation and subsequent sensing of M2+.\nAmong the divalent metal ions tested for RBS sensing, Cu2+ and Zn2+ are, undoubtedly, notable in this work. However, where both metal ions co-exist, selectivity should be an important parameter for testing the performance of a novel probe like RBS. In this regard, we conducted a competitive experiment by monitoring the change in fluorescent intensities at 580\u00a0nm upon addition of 5 equiv of Cu2+ to a solution of different metal ions (5 equiv). The results are displayed in the chart (Fig.\u00a04A). High selectivity of RBS for Cu2+ from among all the metals tested was underscored by the significant fluorescent profile in a co-existing multi-metallic interference environment. Furthermore, confirmation of the continued selectivity and sensitivity dominance of Cu2+ sensing among multi-metallic interferences was further proved by the addition of RBS\u2013Zn2+ to various cations, which did not induce any noticeable changes in the relative intensities of other metal ions except Cu2+ (Fig.\u00a04B)."

            "text": "Photo and chemical stability are major pre-requisites for any chemosensor to be considered for biological and environmental applications [35]. Thus, we determined the stability of RBS\u2013Cu2+ and RBS\u2013Zn2+ over the physiologically relevant pH range (1\u201312) (Fig.\u00a07). Only RBS\u2013Cu2+ was found to be strongly pH dependent and recorded relatively weak fluorescent decline up to pH 5. However, there was an exponential increase in fluorescence up to pH 11, indicating that proper pH is a pre-condition for bio-application of RBS\u2013Cu2+. On the other hand, neither RBS nor RBS\u2013Zn2+\n1 3\nwas pH dependent, showing that RBS could not be used for Zn2+ detection under physiologically aqueous conditions. More detailed experiments are yet necessary to unequivocally correlate protonation/deprotonation rate constants and/or induction of molecular aggregation with the emission intensity profile over the pH scale for the different complexes.\nSecondly, to establish the photostability profile, we irradiated a solution of RBS\u2013Cu2+ and RBS\u2013Zn2+ at 356\u00a0nm up to 60\u00a0min. The absorption and emission as a consequence of the irradiation are comparatively illustrated in Fig.\u00a08. As it can be observed, RBS in its complex formation is adequately photostable in sensing both Cu2+ and Zn2+, as there are no significant absorption and emission changes at their respective maximum band peaks.\n1 3\nAlong with the adequate photostability shown by RBS in sensing Cu2+ and Zn2+, the fast sensing response time toward these metal ions should also be highlighted, within 11 and 13\u00a0min, respectively, and keeping constant thereafter for a reasonable period of time (Fig.\u00a09).\nAdditionally, the excited state of RBS\u2013Cu2+ and RBS\u2013Zn2+ showed adequate lifetime within 3.20\u00a0ns and 1.68\u00a0ns, respectively, which equally signified sensing stability (Table\u00a01). The recovery of both fluorimetry and colorimetry detections of Cu2+ and Zn2+ is on the high side (96.4\u201398.3%; values calculated from Fig.\u00a08 = [max\u2013min]/ [min] \u00d7 100) (Table\u00a01), corroborating the good stability, reliability and practicality of the dual sensing properties of RBS for these metal ions. These results underpinned to a large extent earlier studies [21, 22], reiterating triazolyl-POSS with scavenging photodegradation. Our designed bis-triazolyl-POSS anchoring rhodamine enhanced the photostability as a result of the strong binding profile of bis-triazoles to metal ions. The folding tendency of the triazole unit toward metal coordination depends on the bulkiness of the group at the terminal. In this sense, the inclusion of large POSS units facilitates the folding over the diamino linker favoring a stronger metal coordination."

Job\u2019s plot indicates that RBS\u2013Cu2+ and RBS\u2013Zn2+ have preferences for 2:1 and 1:1 binding stoichiometry, respectively (Fig.\u00a011). The observed discrepancy in the binding stoichiometry suggests different binding orientations with respect to bistirazole (\u2013N=N\u2013Cu\u2013N=N\u2013) and open spirolactam carbonyl of the amide/triazole (O\u2013Cu\u2013N=N). Plausibly, once the Cu2+ or Zn2+ is fixed in the cavity of RBS via the coordination\u2013bonding interaction, the electron cloud on the electronrich imine fragment will transfer to the large rhodamine ring system resulting in the ring opening of spirolactam amide to form a five-member or six-member ring [36]. The exclusive sensing of Cu2+ and Zn2+ owes to the stronger ability of these ions toward the ligand due to the optimal size of RBS cavity. We can further explain this phenomenon based on hard and soft acid and base interaction (HSAB) theory [36, 37] and chelation size [38], since Cu2+ and Zn2+ have\ncomparable chelating sizes. The predominating selectivity of RBS for Cu2+ is based on an analogy that the metal ion is a hard acid, which preferentially opts for a stronger \u201cN\u201d hard base in the triazole moiety [35].\nAs predicted, RBS was much more selective for Cu2+ than Zn2+ and free from cross reactivity with other competing metal ions. It should also be considered that an interference of Zn2+ could be significant where Cu2+ and Zn2+ co-exist in analytical samples for physiological applications. This prompted us to carry out further dual metal system experiments. The addition of Zn2+ to the RBS\u2013Cu2+ resulted in a 2.1-fold fluorescent intensity (see Fig.\u00a010, inset). Such enhancement may be due to the addition of Zn2+, which possesses the tendency to displace Cu2+ from the triazole\u2013triazole (N=N\u2013Cu\u2013N=N) coordination and, eventually, opt for amide\u2013triazole (O\u2013Cu\u2013N=N) coordination. As previously proposed [39], and supporting our analogy, the folding tendency of the triazole unit moves toward the amide segment and is favorable for Zn2+ coordination. Furthermore, the dangling bulky triazolyl-POSS could facilitate Zn+2 coordination during Cu2+/Zn2+ exchange."

For these studies, fingerprints of selected donors were imaged and detected via both fluorescent and colorimetric responses of RBS\u2013Cu2+ and RBS\u2013Zn2+ with high sensitivity, selectivity and legibility (Fig.\u00a012).\nDetailed observation of the ridge features showed Whorf, bifurcation and ridge ending, which to a large extent fulfill the requirements of fingerprint identifications in forensic science.\nA judicious balance of hydrophobic and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions have been recognized in previous reports [21, 22]. Accordingly, RBS\u2013M2+ was designed to possess multiple binding profiles which are subsequently available for interaction with the \u2013C=O and \u2013NH2 of amino acids in fingerprint oils (Fig.\u00a013). The whole ensemble, which consists of RBS\u2013M2+ in non-covalent interactions with \u2013C=O and \u2013NH2, formed a ternary complex that cooperatively work\n1 3\nto provide stabilized fingerprint detection and eventual imaging. Some fluorescent chemosensor systems have been developed to detect amino acids based on probe\u2013metal ion ensembles [15]. Importantly, brightness, contrast and visual legibility remained unchanged up to 1\u00a0year, when\ndeveloped with RBS\u2013Cu2+ under fluorescent response (2 equiv of Cu2+). However, dimmer and less contrast pink and green images surfaced at the end of the 6th month for RBS\u2013Cu2+ and RBS\u2013Zn2+, respectively, when colorimetric responses (10 equiv) predominate.\n1 3\nWe could ascribe the apparently lesser short-lived and dimmer image features obtained under colorimetric responses to unhidden open images that are frequently exposed to light, which eventually fade the pink and yellowish green fingerprint images over time. Obviously, the latent nature of fingerprint developed by fluorescent RBS\u2013Cu2+ (2 equiv) forestalls frequent exposure to light and eventually\nconfers extra stability to the reddish pink fingerprint image which spanned over 12\u00a0months."
