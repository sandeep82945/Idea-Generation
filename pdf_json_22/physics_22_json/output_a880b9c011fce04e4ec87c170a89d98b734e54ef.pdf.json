INTRODUCTION\nChiral symmetry is an intrinsic symmetry of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the massless limit of quarks and is spontaneously broken due to the nonzero quark condensate. The spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the SUL\u00f03\u00de \u00d7 SUR\u00f03\u00de into the flavor SU(3) generates eight Goldstone particles sorted into the pseudoscalar octet composed of f\u03c0; K; \u03b78g which are slightly massive due to the small u, d, s quark masses. If SSB also applies to the UL\u00f01\u00de \u00d7 UR\u00f01\u00de sector of the chiral symmetry, it breaks into UV\u00f01\u00de that corresponds to the baryon number conservation expects the existence of an additional Goldstone particle, namely, a light flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson. The \u03b70 meson is predominantly a flavor singlet but is too massive to be taken as a candidate for this Goldstone particle. The \u03b70 mass puzzle has a direct connection with the QCD UA\u00f01\u00de anomaly that the anomalous gluonic term, the topological charge density, breaks the conservation of the flavor singlet axial current even in the chiral limit. Even though the anomalous axial vector relation can be written as the divergence of a gauge variant axial vector, which is zero\nand implies a UA\u00f01\u00de symmetry, Kogut and Susskind [1] pointed out that its spontaneous breaking generates a massless mode that violates the Gell-Mann-Okubo relation and then renders \u03b70 more massive. With respect to the nontrivial topology of QCD vacuum, Witten [2] and Veneziano [3] proposed a mechanism for the original of \u03b70 mass that the nonperturbative coupling of the topological charge density and the flavor singlet pseudoscalar induces a self energy correction m20, which is proportional to the topological susceptibility \u03c7 of gauge fields. Using the physical mass of \u03b70, the value of \u03c7 is estimated to be around \u00f0180 MeV\u00de4, which is supported by lattice QCD calculations [4]. Another interesting property of \u03b70 is its large production rate in the J=\u03c8 radiative decays [5], which are abundant in gluons and are expected to favor the production of glueballs. This observation along with the original mechanism of \u03b70 mass manifests the strong coupling of \u03b70 to gluons and thereby prompts the conjecture that \u03b70 may mix substantially with pseudoscalar glueballs since they have the same quantum number. The KLOE Collaboration analyzed the processes \u03d5 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 and \u03d5 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b70 and found that the \u03b70-glueball mixing might be required and the mixing angle can be as large as \u00f022 3\u00de\u00b0 [6]. In contrast, another phenomenological analysis of the KLOE result gave the mixing angle \u00f012 13\u00de\u00b0 which is consistent with zero within the large error [7]. A phenomenological analysis of the processes J=\u03c8\u00f0\u03c8 0\u00de decaying into a pseudoscalar and a vector final states obtained the \u03b70-glueball mixing angle to be around 9\u00b0 by considering the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b70-glueballmixingmodel [8]. Obviously, the determined mixing angle varies in a fairly large range.

However, the quenched lattice QCD studies [13\u201315] predict that the mass of the pseudoscalar glueball is around 2.4\u20132.6 GeV, which is confirmed by lattice simulations with dynamical quarks [16\u2013 19]. This raised a question on \u03b7\u00f01405\u00de as a glueball candidate because of its much lighter mass. On the other hand, the strong hint for \u03b7\u00f01405\u00de to be a glueball candidate is the observation that there exist three isoscalar pseudoscalar mesons \u03b7\u00f01295\u00de, \u03b7\u00f01405\u00de and \u03b7\u00f01475\u00de such that one of them is surplus according to the quark model. If \u03b7\u00f01405\u00de and \u03b7\u00f01475\u00de are the same state [20], there is no need for a pseudoscalar glueball state in this mass region. Somemixing model studies also favor the pseudoscalar glueball to have a mass heavier than 2 GeV [21,22]. In this work, we will investigate the possible mixing of\nisoscalar pseudoscalar meson and the pseudoscalar glueball in Nf \u00bc 2 lattice QCD. The isoscalar pseudoscalar meson is named \u03b7 throughout this work, which is the SU(2) counterpart of the SU(3) flavor singlet (approximately \u03b70) in the Nf \u00bc 3 case. We have generated a large ensemble of gauge configurations with Nf \u00bc 2 degenerated u, d quarks at a pion mass m\u03c0 \u2248 350 MeV, so we can make a precise determination of \u03b7mass. The calculation of \u03b70 mass (and the \u03b70 \u2212 \u03b7 mixing) has been performed in several Nf \u00bc 2\u00fe 1 lattice QCD studies, whose results are in agreement with the physical value after the chiral extrapolation [23\u201326]. A systematic and comprehensive lattice study on the properties of \u03b7 and \u03b70 is presented in Ref. [27], where the masses, the decay constants and the gluonic matrix elements of \u03b7 and \u03b70 have been derived to a high precision. There are also many studies on the \u03b7 mass from Nf \u00bc 2 lattice QCD [19,28\u201330]. According to the Witten-Veneziano mechanism (WV), in the Nf \u00bc 2 case, pion mass and \u03b7 mass are related as m2\u03b7 \u00bc m2\u03c0 \u00fem20, where m20 is the correction from the topology induced interaction and is proportional to Nf. As a check of WV, we would like to take a look at this relationship and use the obtained m20 to predict the \u03b7\n0 mass in the physical case (a pioneering work following this way in the quenched approximation can be found in Ref. [31]). After that, we calculate the correlation functions of the \u03b7 operator and the glueball operator, from which the mixing angle can be extracted. The strategy of the study is similar to that used in the \u03b7c-glueball mixing [32]. As an exploratory study, we tentatively treat the pseudoscalar glueball as a stable particle and ignore its resonance nature in the presence of light sea quarks. Obviously, the numeric task involves the calculation of the annihilation diagrams of u, d quarks, so we adopt the distillation method [33] which enables the gauge covariant smearing of quark fields and the all-to-all quark propagators (perambulators) simultaneously. Since we also have the perambulators of the valence charm quark, we also calculate the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7c correlation functions and explore their properties.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we describe the lattice setup, operator construction and formulation of correlation functions. Section III gives the theoretical formalism of the meson-glueball mixing, where the data analyses and the results can be found. The discussion and summary are given in Sec. IV, and the preliminary results from \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7c correlation functions are presented here."

The anisotropy \u03be \u2248 5.3 is checked by the dispersion relation of the pseudoscalar \u03c0 (along with that of \u03b7 calculated using the distillation method, see Sec.

(1) gives \u03be \u00bc 5.58\u00f01\u00de which deviates from5.3 drastically. This can be definitely attributed to the influence of nearby P-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering states that have the same center-of-mass momentum as \u03c1. Sowe do not use \u03c1 meson to check the \u03be value. There are subtleties in the determination of the lattice\nspacing for our lattice setup. We intend to generate gauge configurations at a pion mass m\u03c0 \u223c 300 MeV. As the first step, we calculate the static potential\nV\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc V0 \u2212 ec r \u00fe \u03c3r \u00f02\u00de\nthroughWilson loops to determine ec and the string tension \u03c3a2s (in lattice units). Then the spatial lattice spacing as is determined in the unit of the Sommer\u2019s scale parameter r0 according to the condition r2 dVdr jr\u00bcr0 \u00bc 1.65, namely\nas r0\n\u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u03c3a2s 1.65 \u2212 ec\ns \u00bc 0.334\u00f02\u00de: \u00f03\u00de\nWe tentatively use the value r0 \u00bc 0.491\u00f09\u00de fm, which is determined at the physical point (in the chiral, continuum and infinite volume limits) [35], to set as of our lattice, from which the quark mass is tuned to give m\u03c0 \u2248 300 MeV. However, given this value of as, the mass of the vector meson \u03c1 is determined to be around 750 MeV, which is obviously lower than expected (note that m\u03c1 is 770 MeVat the physical pion mass m\u03c0 \u223c 135 MeV). This can be understood as follows. The measured value of r0=as actually also depends on the quark mass for a given lattice, such that an additional quark mass dependence is introduced to the values of m\u03c0 and m\u03c1 in terms of r0. Since our quark mass is substantially far from the chiral limit, it is more reasonable to use the value of r0 that is extrapolated from the physical pion mass to the comparable one in our situation. An alternative scale setting scheme is to choose another\nquantity that is insensitive to quark masses. Experimentally, there is an interesting relation between pseudoscalar meson masses mPS and the vector meson masses mV of the quark configuration qlq\u0304,\n\u0394m2 \u2261m2V \u2212m2PS \u2248 0.56 \u2212 0.58 GeV2 \u00f04\u00de where ql stands for the u, d, s quark and q stands for u, d, s, c quarks. The PDG results of the masses of these vector and pseudoscalar mesons [5] are collected in Table I along with their mass squared differences. Even though the reason is still unknown for this relation, empirically these values are insensitive to quark masses. On the other hand, the mass\nof \u03b7s, the ss\u0304 counterpart of \u03c0 (not considering the ss\u0304 annihilation effects in the calculation), is determined to be m\u03b7s \u00bc 0.686\u00f04\u00de GeV from lattice QCD by the HPQCD collaboration [36]. Even though \u03b7s is not a physical state, the mass squared difference m2\u03d5 \u2212m2\u03b7s \u2248 0.570 GeV\n2 also satisfies the empirical relation in Eq. (4). In this study, the dimensionless masses of \u03c0 and \u03c1 is determined to bem\u03c0at \u00bc 0.05055\u00f013\u00de and m\u03c1at \u00bc 0.12046\u00f020\u00de. In this sense, we assume the relation of Eq. (4) is somewhat general for heavylight mesons and use it to set the scale parameter at. Of course, one should take caution to use this relation since \u03c1 is experimentally a wide resonance and decays intoP-wave \u03c0\u03c0 states by 99%. On our lattice the lowest P-wave \u03c0\u03c0 energy threshold in the rest frame of \u03c0\u03c0 is 2E\u03c0\u00f0p\u00deat \u2248 0.1795 with \u03be \u2248 5.3, which is substantially higher thanm\u03c1at. This means \u03c1 in its rest frame is a stable particle, such that the mass value m\u03c1 is reliable. In practice, wemake the least squares fitting to the mass squared differences over the nn\u0304, ns\u0304, nc\u0304 and sc\u0304 systems where n refers to the u, d quarks, and get the value \u0394m2 \u00bc 0.568\u00f08\u00de GeV2, which serves as an input to give the lattice scale parameter a\u22121t \u00bc 6.894\u00f051\u00de GeV and the corresponding spatial lattice spacing as \u2248 0.1517\u00f011\u00de fm. We emphasize that the errors quoted in the values of at and as include only the statistical errors ofm\u03c0at andm\u03c1at, aswell as\nthe uncertainty of\u0394m2.Accordingly, theu,dmass parameter in this study gives m\u03c0 \u00bc 348.5\u00f01.0\u00de\u00f02.6\u00de MeV and m\u03c1 \u00bc 830.5\u00f06.3\u00de\u00f06.1\u00de MeV, where the second error is due to the uncertainty of a\u22121t . For most of this paper, we will not show the second error when listing our physical values. This means that most of the errors below are just statistical errors. Wewill bring the a\u22121t error back to physical values in conclusion. Using the m\u03c0 above, we have m\u03c0Ls \u2248 3.9 for this lattice setup, which warrants the small finite volume effects. The number of configurations of our gauge ensemble is 6991, which is crucial for the glueball-relevant studies. The details of the gauge ensemble are given in Table II.\n\u03b7-GLUEBALL MIXING FROM Nf \u00bc 2 LATTICE QCD PHYS. REV. D 107, 094510 (2023)\n094510-3\nFor the valence charm quark, we adopt the clover fermion action in Ref. [37], and the charm quark mass parameter is tuned to give \u00f0m\u03b7c \u00fe 3mJ=\u03c8\u00de=4 \u00bc 3.069 GeV. With the tuned charm quark mass parameter, we generate the perambulators of charm quark on our ensemble, from which the masses of \u03b7c and J=\u03c8 are derived precisely to be m\u03b7c \u00bc 2.9750\u00f03\u00de GeV and mJ=\u03c8 \u00bc 3.0988\u00f04\u00de GeV.

(1) for \u03b7c and J=\u03c8 up to the momentum mode n\u20d7 \u00bc \u00f01; 2; 2\u00de. As shown in Fig. 2, the dispersion relation is almost perfectly satisfied with \u03be \u00bc 5.341\u00f02\u00de and 5.307(5) for \u03b7c and J=\u03c8 , respectively. As a further check of our scale setting scheme, we also calculate the masses of D and D and get mD \u00bc 1.882\u00f01\u00de GeV and m D \u00bc 2.023\u00f01\u00de GeV on a fraction of configurations of our ensemble. The hyperfine splitting \u0394HFS\u00f0D\u00de \u00bc mD \u2212mD \u00bc 0.141\u00f02\u00de GeV almost reproduces the experimental values mD 0 \u2212mD0 \u00bc 0.14201\u00f07\u00de GeV and mD \u00fe \u2212mD\u00fe \u00bc 0.14060\u00f07\u00de GeV [5]. This manifests that our tuning of charm quark mass works well. The dispersion relation Eq. (1) is also checked to be correct forD andD with \u03be \u00bc 5.32\u00f02\u00de and5.31(3), respectively. The figure is similar to Figs. 1 and 2 and is omitted here to save space. Table III collects the results of \u03b7c, J=\u03c8 , D and D mesons. Along with the values of \u03be derived from the\ndispersion relations of \u03c0 and \u03b7, we can see that the values of \u03be for different mesons are in agreement with the value \u03be \u00bc 5.30 during the parameter tuning and are consistent with each other within 1%."

For this to be done, we adopt the distillation method [33] which provides a smearing scheme for quark fields (Laplacian Heaviside smearing) and the calculation strategy of the all-to-all propagators of the smeared quark fields that are distilled to be perambulators in the Laplacian Heaviside subspace of the spatial Laplacian operator \u2212\u22072. Since we plan to investigate the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7c correlation functions as well, we calculate the perambulators of u, d and c quarks on our large gauge ensemble in the Laplacian Heaviside space spanned by the N \u00bc 70 eigenvectors of \u2212\u22072 operator with the lowest eigenvalues.

We do observe the finite volume artifact that C\u03b35\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de approaches to a nonzero constant when t is large, as shown in Fig. 3. It has been argued that this constant term comes from the topology of QCD vacuum and can be approximately expressed as a5\u00f0\u03c7top \u00feQ2=V\u00de=T where a is the lattice spacing (in the isotropic case), \u03c7top is the topological susceptibility, Q is the topological charge, V is the spatial volume and T is the\ntemporal extension of the lattice [30,38,39]. This can be understood from the anomalous axial vector current relation that the O\u03b35 has a direct connection with the topological charge density operator. It is interesting to observe that C\u00f0\u03b34\u03b35\u00de\u00f0\u03b34\u03b35\u00de\u00f0t\u00de has normal large t behavior that it damps to zero for large t.

Figure 4 shows these effective mass functions. Benefited from the large statistics of our gauge ensemble, the effective mass plateau starts from t \u223c 10, and the signal-to-noise ratio keeps good for t beyond 20 in the case \u0393 \u00bc \u03b34\u03b35. By a combined fit of C\u03b35\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de and C\u00f0\u03b34\u03b35\u00de\u00f0\u03b34\u03b35\u00de\u00f0t\u00de using two mass terms, we obtain the best-fit mass of \u03b7 to be\nm\u03b7 \u00bc 714.1\u00f05.8\u00de MeV: \u00f09\u00de\nwhere the error is obtained through the jackknife analysis. Considering the uncontrolled systematic uncertainties in our calculation (the continuum extrapolation and the chiral extrapolation have not been performed), this value is compatible with other determinations [28\u201330].

Using this value and fphys\u03c0 \u00bc 130.2\u00f08\u00de MeV [41\u201344], \u03c71=4top is estimated to be \u03c71=4top \u00bc 183\u00f03\u00de MeV, which is very close to the phenomenological value 180 MeV and the lattice value 185.3(5.6) MeV [4]. In the physical Nf \u00bc 3 case at physical pion mass, the GMOR relation implies the mass of the singlet counterpart of the pseudoscalar octet should be m21 \u00bc \u00f02m2K \u00fem2\u03c0\u00de=3 \u00bc 0.170 GeV2.

This confirms again that the Witten-Veneziano mechanism for the flavor singlet pseudoscalar mass works fairly well both for the SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetry."

For a given quantum number, jni\u2019s establish an orthogonal and complete set, namely, P n jnihnj \u00bc 1 with the normalization condition hmjni \u00bc \u03b4mn. In principle, H\u0302 only exists heuristically, so we do not know the exact particle configurations of these eigenstates simply from the correlation function in Eq. (15). As far as the flavor singlet pseudoscalar channel is concerned in the Nf \u00bc 2 QCD theory, each of the state jni should be a specific admixture of bare \u03b7 states and bare glueballs if they exist theoretically (here we ignore the multihadron states temporarily) and can be taken as the states in the eigenstate set fj\u03b1ni; n \u00bc 1; 2;\u2026g of the free Hamiltonian H\u03020. Since we are working in a unitary lattice framework for u, d quarks, in principle this state set is orthogonal and complete with the normalization condition h\u03b1mj\u03b1ni \u00bc \u03b4mn. Now we introduce the interaction Hamiltonian H\u0302I to account for the dynamics of the possible mixing, such that jni of H\u0302 \u00bc H\u03020 \u00fe H\u0302I can be expanded in terms of j\u03b1mi as\njni \u00bc X m Cnmj\u03b1mi \u00f016\u00de\nwith P\nm jCnmj2 \u00bc 1. In this sense, one can say that jni is an admixture of states j\u03b1mi whose fractions are jCnmj2, respectively.

On the other hand, quenched lattice QCD predicted the mass of the lowest pseudoscalar glueball is around 2.4\u2013 2.6 GeV. This seems to be confirmed by the correlation function CGG\u00f0t\u00de of the optimized operator OG, which is expected to couple most to the ground state.

That is to say, we take the further approximation O\u2020\u03b35 j0i \u2248 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Z\u03b35;1\np j\u03b7i. Thus after inserting Eqs. (20), (21), (22), (23) to Eq.

In order to understand the almost constant error of CG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de, we consider its variance [45]\n\u03b42CG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de\u2261 hO2G\u00f0t\u00deO2\u03b35\u00f00\u00dei \u2212 C2G\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de: \u00f025\u00de The first term on the right-hand side can be viewed as a correlation function of the operator O2\u03b35 and O 2 G, both of which have the vacuum quantum number 0\u00fe\u00fe (in the continuum limit) and are expected to have nonzero vacuum expectation values hO2\u03b35i \u2260 0 and hO2Gi \u2260 0. Thus we have\n\u03b42CG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc hO2G\u00f0t\u00deO2\u03b35\u00f00\u00dei \u2212 C2G\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe hO2GihO2\u03b35i \u00f026\u00de\nwhere O2i \u00f0t\u00de\u2261O2i \u00f0t\u00de \u2212 hO2i i. The almost constant error of CG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de implies that the constant term hO2\u03b35ihO2Gi is large and dominate the variance. This is consistent with the argument in Ref. [45] that the variance of a correlation function is dominated by the possible lowest state, which corresponds to the vacuum state with Evac \u00bc 0 in our case. This motivates us to consider the temporal derivative of CG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de, namely,\n\u2202tCG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1 2at \u00f0CG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00fe at\u00de \u2212 CG\u03b35\u00f0t \u2212 at\u00de\u00de; \u00f027\u00de\nsuch that the constant term in CG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de and its constant variance can be canceled. This is surely the case. We plot \u2202tCG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de in Fig. 6, where one can see that \u2202tCG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de goes to zero when t is large and its relative error is much smaller.\nIn order for the mixing energies x1 and y1 to be extracted by using Eq. (24), one has to know the parameters m1, m3, m4, m\u03b7, mG, mG , ZG, ZG and Z\u03b35;1, which, based on the assumptions of Eq. (21), are encoded in the correlation functions C\u03b35\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de and CGG\u00f0t\u00de as\nCGG\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc X i ZGi\u00f0e\u2212mGi t \u00fe e\u2212mGi \u00f0T\u2212t\u00de\u00de\nC\u03b35\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc X i Z\u03b35;i\u00f0e\u2212m\u03b7i t \u00fe e\u2212m\u03b7i \u00f0T\u2212t\u00de\u00de\n\u2248 Z\u03b35;1\u00f0e\u2212m\u03b7t \u00fe e\u2212m\u03b7\u00f0T\u2212t\u00de\u00de \u00f028\u00de\nwhere we take i \u00bc 1, 2 for CGG\u00f0t\u00de and therefore G1;2 refer to G and G . It should be noted that the second state jG i should be considered even though we have built the optimal operator OG based on a large operator set (seen in Appendix), it turns out that there is still a substantial contribution of higher states in CGG. To manifest this, we plot the effective mass function meff\u00f0t\u00de of CGG\u00f0t\u00de in Fig. 7 by the definition in Eq. (8), where one can see that the ground state glueball G has not saturated CGG\u00f0t\u00de before the signals are undermined by errors. With this observation, we add the second term relevant to G to the first equation in Eq. (28) but do not consider its physical meaning. Since the mixing effect is expected to be small (our final results confirm this),we take the assumptionsm1 \u2248m\u03b7,m3 \u2248 mG and m4 \u2248mG . In the data analysis procedure, we first rearrange the Nconf measurements into 139 bins with each bin including 50 measurements, and then we perform the one-eliminating jackknife analysis on these data bins. For each time of jackknife resampling, we first extract m\u03b7, mG, mG , ZG, ZG , Z\u03b34\u03b35;1 and Z\u03b35;1 from CGG\u00f0t\u00de, C\u03b35\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de and C\u00f0\u03b34\u03b35\u00de\u00f0\u03b34\u03b35\u00de\u00f0t\u00de in the fixed time windows \u00bdtl; th GG \u00bc \u00bd1; 14 ,\nJIANG, SUN, CHEN, CHEN, GONG, LIU, and ZHANG PHYS.

Then we feed these parameters to \u2202tCG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de to determine the parameters x1 and y1.

(21), (22), (23) are up to a plus or minus sign, we can only determine the absolute value jx1j of x1. The parameters of the fitting procedure and fitting results are collected in Table IV. The goodness of the fit of Eq.

In mean time, making use of the T -odd property of CG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de, we average the t < T\n2 part and t > T 2 part and find the errors can be\nreduced drastically around t \u00bc 0 except for CG\u03b35\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de, as shown in Fig. 8, where the function of Eq. (24) with fitted parameters is also plotted with shaded curves. It is seen that the function describes the t-dependence ofCG\u03b35\u00f0t\u00de very well up to an unknown constant termwith opposite signs for t < T\n2\nand t > T 2 .\nSince jx1j is much smaller than mG \u2212m\u03b7, to the lowest order of the perturbation theory, we can estimate the mixing angle \u03b8 of \u03b7 and the ground state glueball G as\nj\u03b8j \u2248 sin j\u03b8j \u2248 jx1j mG \u2212m\u03b7 \u00bc 3.46\u00f046\u00de\u00b0: \u00f030\u00de"

Based on the experimental observation that the differences of mass squares of the heavy-light vector and pseudoscalar mesons are insensitive to quark masses, we propose a new scale setting scheme that the temporal lattice spacing at can be estimated by this quantity. In practice, we use the value m2V \u2212m2PS \u00bc 0.568\u00f08\u00de GeV2, which is a least squares fitting ofnn\u0304, sn\u0304, ss\u0304, cn\u0304 and cs\u0304mesonswithn referring to the lightu, d quarks. Our u, d quark mass parameter corresponds to a pion mass m\u03c0 \u2248 350 MeV. We calculate the perambulators of u, d quarks and the valence charm quark on our ensemble using the distillation method where the quark annihilation diagrams can be calculated efficiently. We calculate the mass of the isoscalar pseudoscalar meson \u03b7 to be m\u03b7 \u00bc 714\u00f06\u00de\u00f016\u00de MeV. The error in the latter bracket is introduced by the estimation of lattice spacing in Sec. II A. This mass value can be matched, through the Witten-Veneziano relation, to the SU(3) flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson massm\u03b71 \u2248 981 MeV, which is in good agreement with the \u03b70 mass m\u03b70 \u00bc 958 MeV if the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b70 mixing is considered. The mixing of \u03b7 and the pseudoscalar glueball is\ninvestigated for the first time on the lattice. From the correlation function of the glueball operator and \u03b7 operator, the mixing energy and the mixing angle are determined to be jx1j \u00bc 107\u00f015\u00de\u00f02\u00de MeV and j\u03b8j \u00bc 3.46\u00f046\u00de\u00b0 given the pseudoscalar glueball mass mG \u2248 2.5 GeV. This mixing angle is so tiny that the mixing effects can be neglected when the properties of \u03b7 (and also \u03b70 in the physical Nf \u00bc 3 case) are explored.\nJIANG, SUN, CHEN, CHEN, GONG, LIU, and ZHANG PHYS. REV. D 107, 094510 (2023)\n094510-10\nWith perambulators of light and charm quarks at hand, we also checked correlation functions of \u03b7 and \u03b7c, which are contributed only by annihilation diagrams. The \u0393 insertion are chosen to be \u03b35 and \u03b34\u03b35. The signal-to-noise ratios of these correlation functions are fairly good, and the effective masses of them defined by Eq. (8) are presented in Fig. 10, where the horizontal gray line illustrates the \u03b7mass in the lattice unit. Albeit the different behaviors at the small t range, all the effective masses approach m\u03b7 when t is large. Because of the influence from excited states of \u03b7 and \u03b7c, we cannot fit the curve by the simplification above, and optimized operators for these states are required to get better results. This kind of exploration can be performed in the future. To summarize, we find that there is little mixing between\nthe flavor singlet pseudoscalar (\u03b7 is our case) and the pseudoscalar glueball. The topology of the QCD vacuum plays a crucial role in the origin of \u03b7 mass due to the QCD UA\u00f01\u00de anomaly. This is in accordance with the common theoretical considerations [46]."

TheWilson loops of each prototype are calculated using smeared gauge links. We adopt six different schemes to smear gauge links, which are different combinations of single link smearing and double link smearing [14,15]. The spatial symmetry group on the lattice is the octahedral group O whose irreducible representation A1 corresponds to the spin J \u00bc 0; 4;\u2026 in the continuum limit. It is expected the glueball of J \u00bc 4 is higher than the J \u00bc 0 state in mass, so we can build operators in the A\u2212\u00fe1 representation to couple with the ground state pseudoscalar glueball. Let W\u03b1\u00f0x; t\u00de be one prototype of the Wilson loop under a specific smearing scheme, then the A\u2212\u00fe1 operator in the rest frame of a glueball can be obtained by \u03d5\u03b1\u00f0t\u00de\u00bc X x X R\u2208O cA1R \u00bdR\u2218W\u03b1\u00f0x; t\u00de\u2212PR\u2218W\u03b1\u00f0x; t\u00deP\u22121 \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere R\u2218W\u03b1 refers to differently oriented Wilson loops after one of the 24 elements of O (R) operated on W\u03b1, P is spatial reflection operation and cA1R are the combinational coefficients for the A1 representation. Thus we obtain a A \u2212\u00fe 1 operator set f\u03d5\u03b1\u00f0t\u00de; \u03b1 \u00bc 1; 2;\u2026; 24g based on the four prototypes and six smearing schemes. In order to get an optimized operator OG that couples most to the ground state glueball, we first calculate the correlation matrix of the operator set,\n\u03b7-GLUEBALL MIXING FROM Nf \u00bc 2 LATTICE QCD PHYS.
