1. **Investigate the role of trust in the relationship between credence attributes and WTPP.** Trust is an important factor in consumer behavior, and it is likely to play a role in the relationship between credence attributes and WTPP. For example, consumers who trust organic food producers are more likely to be willing to pay a premium for organic food.
2. **Examine the impact of uncertainty on the mediating role of utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes.** This study found that uncertainty moderates the relationship between utilitarian attitudes and WTPP, and between hedonistic attitudes and WTPP. However, it is not clear how uncertainty affects the mediating role of utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes. Future research could investigate this issue in more detail.
3. **Explore the role of other factors that may influence WTPP for organic food.** This study focused on the role of credence attributes, utilitarian attitudes, hedonistic attitudes, and uncertainty in WTPP for organic food. However, there are other factors that may also influence WTPP, such as income, education, and lifestyle. Future research could investigate the role of these other factors.
4. **Conduct a longitudinal study to examine the effects of credence attributes and WTPP on organic food consumption.** This study was cross-sectional, which means that it only examined the relationship between credence attributes and WTPP at one point in time. Future research could conduct a longitudinal study to examine the effects of credence attributes and WTPP on organic food consumption over time.
5. **Replicate this study in other countries.** This study was conducted in China. It is not clear whether the findings of this study would generalize to other countries. Future research could replicate this study in other countries to see if the findings are consistent.
