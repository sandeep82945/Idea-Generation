1. **Investigate the potential of natural cross-linking agents for the preparation of hydrogels with improved mechanical properties.**

Current research has shown that natural cross-linking agents can produce hydrogels with good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. However, the mechanical properties of these hydrogels are often inferior to those of hydrogels cross-linked with synthetic agents. Future research could focus on developing strategies to improve the mechanical properties of hydrogels cross-linked with natural agents, such as by using a combination of natural and synthetic cross-linkers or by modifying the cross-linking conditions.


2. **Explore the use of natural cross-linking agents for the preparation of hydrogels with controlled drug release properties.**

Hydrogels are promising materials for drug delivery due to their ability to absorb and retain large amounts of water. The release of drugs from hydrogels can be controlled by a variety of factors, including the type of cross-linking agent used. Future research could investigate the use of natural cross-linking agents to prepare hydrogels with controlled drug release properties, such as by varying the concentration of the cross-linking agent or by using a combination of natural and synthetic cross-linkers.


3. **Develop natural cross-linking agents for the preparation of hydrogels with enhanced biocompatibility and reduced immunogenicity.**

Some natural cross-linking agents, such as glutaraldehyde, can be cytotoxic and immunogenic. Future research could focus on developing new natural cross-linking agents that are more biocompatible and less immunogenic. This could be achieved by modifying the structure of existing natural cross-linking agents or by identifying new natural compounds with cross-linking properties.


4. **Investigate the use of natural cross-linking agents for the preparation of hydrogels with self-healing properties.**

Self-healing hydrogels are materials that can repair themselves after being damaged. This property is important for applications such as wound healing and tissue engineering. Future research could investigate the use of natural cross-linking agents to prepare self-healing hydrogels. This could be achieved by designing cross-linking agents that can form reversible bonds or by incorporating self-healing agents into the hydrogel matrix.


5. **Explore the potential of natural cross-linking agents for the preparation of hydrogels with stimuli-responsive properties.**

Stimuli-responsive hydrogels are materials that can change their properties in response to external stimuli, such as temperature, pH, or light. These hydrogels have potential applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and biosensing. Future research could investigate the use of natural cross-linking agents to prepare stimuli-responsive hydrogels. This could be achieved by designing cross-linking agents that can undergo reversible changes in response to external stimuli or by incorporating stimuli-responsive polymers into the hydrogel matrix.
