Higher yields accompanied by reduced N2O emissions are essential to synergistically reduce greenhouse warming and ensure global food security. In this study, we conducted a trial using two sowing patterns (conventional drilling sowing [CD] and wide belt sowing [WB], with seedling belt widths of 2\u20133 and 8\u201310 cm, respectively) with four N rates (0, 168, 240, and 312 kg ha-1, hereafter N0, N168, N240, and N312, respectively) during the 2019\u20132020 and 2020\u20132021 growing seasons. We investigated the impacts of growing season, sowing pattern, and N rate on N2O emissions, N2O emissions factors (EFs), global warming potential (GWP), yield-scaled N2O emissions, grain yield, N use efficiency (NUE), plant N uptake and soil inorganic N concentrations at jointing, anthesis, and maturity. The results showed that sowing pattern and N rate interactions influenced the N2O emissions markedly. Compared to CD, WB significantly reduced cumulative N2O emissions, N2O EFs, GWP, and yield-scaled N2O emissions for N168, N240, and N312, with the largest reduction seen at N312. Furthermore, WB markedly improved plant N uptake and reduced soil inorganic N compared to CD at each N rate. Correlation analyses indicated that WB mitigated the N2O emissions at various N rates mainly through efficient N uptake and reduced soil inorganic N. The highest grain yield occurred under a combination of WB and N312, under which the yield-scaled N2O emissions were equal to the local management (sowing with CD at N240). In conclusion, WB sowing could synergistically decrease N2O emissions and obtain high grain yields and NUEs, especially at higher N rates.\nKEYWORDS\nN rate, wide belt sowing, N2O emissions, grain yield, plant N uptake, soil inorganic N concentration, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "With an expanding world population, it is estimated that major cereal crops must increase by approximately 50% to meet the expected food demand by 2050 (vanDijk et al., 2021). However, limited land area for agriculture means that the only way to increase grain yield is to achieve a higher yield per unit of land area (Godfray et al., 2011). The nutrients compositions and quality of soil, especially nitrogen (N) nutrition, has a significant impact on crops productivity, thereby grain yield (Duan et al., 2019). It is foreseeable that more synthetic N fertilizers will be needed to meet the increasing grain yield demands of an increased global population (Kong et al., 2021).\nGlobal warming caused by greenhouse gases is currently a research hotspot (Kim et al., 2013; Seth and Misra, 2014). It may exacerbate the occurrence of abiotic stresses, such as salt, drought, and so on (Zhu, 2016; Shultana et al., 2022). Application of exogenous matters, like inorganic N, may alleviate these abiotic stresses (Krapp, 2015; Agnihotri and Seth, 2016).\nN2O, one of the most important greenhouse gases, is produced in soils, and approximately 60% of global N2O emissions originate from agriculture, mainly due to N fertilizer application to soils (Millar et al., 2018). N2O causes global warming, destroys the ozone layer, and increases ultraviolet radiation on the ground (IPCC, 2021). When seeking for the high yield or alleviating these abiotic stress in crop production, the application of N fertilizer may increase N2O emissions, because the soil NH4 + and NO3 \u2212 concentrations increase (Millar et al., 2018; Takeda et al., 2021), both of which are the substrates of nitrification and denitrification processes in soil and closely related to N2O emissions (Subbarao et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019).\nTherefore, increasing wheat yield while mitigating the cumulative N2O emissions caused by N fertilizer application is essential to ensure food security and slow global warming (Ying et al., 2019). The application of urease and nitrification inhibitors (Recio et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021), control-released fertilization (Ji et al., 2012), and partial substitution of chemical N with manure (Kong et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021) could synergistically increase wheat yield and reduce N2O emissions. However, these measures will increase production costs.\nCompared to conventional drilling sowing (CD), wide belt sowing (WB) is an optimized sowing pattern that increases the belt of wheat seedlings from 2\u20133 to 8\u201310 cm by altering the width of the furrow opener moldboard without increasing other costs. This improves spatial uniformity and reduces intraspecific competition within seedling belts (Liu et al., 2020; Lv et al., 2020), and results in enhanced water, N, radiation use efficiency, and grain yield of winter wheat (Li et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023). In particular, the enhanced ability to absorb N offers the possibility of reducing nitrous oxide emissions. However, there are insufficient data on how WB affects the N2O emissions of winter wheat.\nTherefore, we hypothesized that sowing winter wheat as WB instead of CD with N fertilizer input would result in improved grain yield alongside reduced N2O emissions. This would be due to the reduced concentrations of inorganic N in the soil through enhanced\nFrontiers in Plant Science 02\nN uptake. We evaluated the interaction between sowing pattern and the application of different N rates on grain yield and N2O emissions. To this end, we used two sowing patterns (CD and WB) at N rates of 0, 168, 240, and 312 kg ha-1 under field conditions. We also investigated the N uptake and soil inorganic N concentrations at jointing, anthesis, and maturity stages to elucidate the processes involved in decreasing N2O emissions using the optimized sowing pattern."

WB significantly reduced the values at N168, N240, and N312 compared to CD and had a lower exponential equation slope (Figure 2), indicating that WB could slow the increase in N2O emissions resulting from the increased N rate. Therefore, the reduction in cumulative N2O emissions in WB significantly improved as the N rates increased and peaked at an N312. In 2019\u20132020, WB decreased the values by 6.29%, 8.31%, and 11.90%, and by 5.00%, 7.58%, and 9.61% for cultivars T18 and T198 at N168, N240, andN312, respectively.

CD at N312 showed the highest cumulative N2O emissions. The GWP response of N2O emissions to sowing pattern and N rate showed the same trend as the cumulative N2O emissions (Figure S3).\nAs shown in Figure 3 and Table S3, the cumulative N2O emissions during the stages from sowing to jointing, jointing to anthesis, and anthesis to maturity were 0.10\u20130.36, 0.13\u20130.38, and 0.05\u20130.17 kg N ha-1 with averages of 0.21, 0.27, and 0.11 kg N ha-1 for cultivar T18.

The arrangement of the wheat plants in the field may significantly affect growth and N uptake (Lu et al., 2020). WB sowing increased the belt of wheat seedlings and reduced the intraspecific competition of plants within the belts (Liu et al., 2020). This benefitted the growth of tillers and roots and resulted in an efficient N absorption capacity during the whole wheat growing season (Lv et al., 2020). In the present study, WBmarkedly improved grain yield and NUE at N168, N240, and N312, due to the improved plant N uptake, in line with Wang et al. (2022) and Zheng et al. (2023). This may be related to the improved activity of N assimilation enzymes in WB sowing, because higher activities of N assimilation enzymes, such as nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, are beneficial for crop N assimilation and absorption (Chandna et al., 2012; Agnihotri and Seth, 2016; Gupta and Seth, 2019).

            "text": "N2O emissions exhibited seasonal variation, and some studies have found that the cumulative N2O emissions at each winter wheat growing stage gradually decreased and were concentrated during the sowing to the greening stage (Liu et al., 2015). Nevertheless, Ji et al. (2012) demonstrated that they were higher from the greening to maturity stage than from the sowing to greening stage. This discrepancy may be due to the differences in specific basal/ topdressing fertilizer ratios, temperature, rainfall, irrigation, or other factors. In our study, these emissions were concentrated at jointing to anthesis, followed by sowing to jointing, and anthesis to maturity. Furthermore, the reduced cumulative N2O emissions in the three growth stages followed a similar pattern in WB compared to CD. This was probably due to the 60% N topdressing (60% of total N fertilizer), irrigation at the jointing stage (60 mm), and suitable temperature (average 12.6\u00b0C) during the jointing to anthesis growth stage. These conditions favor soil nitrification and denitrification (Pan et al., 2022) and produce more N2O emissions.\nN fertilization contributes to N2O emissions (Rahman et al., 2021). Despite a linear relationship between the cumulative N2O emissions and N rates (Kim et al., 2013), there is overwhelming evidence in the literature indicating that cumulative N2O emissions increase exponentially as the N rate increases, including evidence for grain crops around the world (Shcherbak et al., 2014), tropical sugarcane in Australia (Takeda et al., 2021), and spring wheat in\nFrontiers in Plant Science 09\nNew Mexico (Millar et al., 2018). Therefore, mitigation of N2O emissions at higher N input may be more difficult because some simple measures, such as supplementing with phosphate fertilizer (Shen and Zhu, 2022) and changing from conventional to no tillage (Campanha et al., 2019), mitigated N2O emissions at relatively low N input, but not at higher N rates. An exponential relationship was also found in the present study. Although the sowing pattern did not influence the exponential relationship between an increase in N2O emissions and increased N rates, WB initially decreased the N2O emissions for N168, N240, and N312 compared to CD and slowed the increase in cumulative N2O emissions resulting from the increased N rate. As a result, WB had greater N2O emissions at N312 compared to CD, indicating that WB could be used to reduce N2O emissions at various N rates, especially higher ones. A similar relationship was also observed between the GWP of N2O emissions and interactions of N rate and sowing pattern.\nN2O EFs are used to estimate the direct N2O emissions in field crops, reflecting the differences in management patterns (Yue et al., 2019). The EFs in the present study were 0.09\u20130.22% when N rates increased from N168 to N312, like the reference values in Yan et al. (2015). Rahman et al. (2021) found that N2O EFs were linearly correlated with increasing N rates; however, other studies have demonstrated an exponential (Grace et al., 2016) or hyperbolic relationship (Kim et al., 2013) between EFs and N rates. Nevertheless, we observed a parabolic response, and the N rate at which N2O EFs theoretically peaked in WB (275.92\u2013295.49 kg ha -1 with 283.55 kg ha-1 on average) was lower than that in CD (293.20\u2013 319.00 kg ha-1 with 305.63 kg ha-1 on average).

A review of 12 leading cultivars used in China\u2019s major winter wheat cropping regions since the 1940s found that new wheat cultivars have a higher capacity to increase N uptake and reduce N2O emissions than older wheat cultivars (Ying et al., 2019). Chen et al. (2021) also demonstrated that new wheat cultivars reduce N2O emissions mainly through their higher productivity and N uptake and lower soil inorganic N availability. Similarly, the application of controlreleased fertilization also mitigates N2O emissions by maintaining the substrate content of inorganic N at a lower level in the soil than conventional fertilizers (Zhang et al., 2019).\nAt N168, N240, and N312, changing the sowing pattern from CD to WB markedly increased plant N uptake during the growth stages of sowing to jointing, jointing to anthesis, and anthesis to maturity and reduced the soil N concentrations at jointing, anthesis, and maturity.

Higher N fertilizer rates can often result in higher grain yields, resulting in a corresponding increase in N2O emissions (Millar et al., 2018). Unilaterally focusing on reducing the N2O emissions by reducing N rates may be counterproductive and lead to low grain yields (Duan et al., 2019). While meeting agricultural production needs, practices that minimize N2O emissions must be identified (Kim et al., 2022). Yield-scaled N2O emissions could be used as a benchmark to meet the critical global challenge of reducing N2O emissions while ensuring food security (Kong et al., 2021).\nField studies have reported an exponential increase between yield-scaled N2O emissions and increased N rates (Ma et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2012). We observed a similar relationship regardless of the sowing pattern, mainly due to the exponentially increased N2O emissions (R2 = 0.89, P < 0.01). Therefore, it is necessary to exploit efficient measures to reduce the yield-scaled N2O emissions when a specific N fertilizer is applied to achieve a high yield. New crop genotypes can increase plant N uptake (Chen et al., 2021), and other methods, such as new controlled-release fertilizers (Ji et al., 2012),\nFIGURE 7 Effects of sowing pattern and N rate on soil inorganic N concentrations during different growth stages of winter wheat.

All these measures would effectively decrease yield-scaled N2O emissions and improve yields. Meanwhile, in the present study, WB significantly reduced the yield-scaled N2O emissions at N168, N240, and N312 compared to CD due to the increased grain yield and reduced N2O emissions caused by the efficient N uptake and reduced soil N concentrations. Furthermore, we observed an increased reduction in yield-scaled N2O emissions in WB at high N rates, indicating that WB could play an important role in reducing such emissions when more synthetic N fertilizers are applied to in an effort to obtain high yields in the future. Besides, the yield-scaled N2O emissions were not significantly different between WB at N312 and the local management system (sowing using CD at N240); however, the grain yield was much higher. In conclusion, WB sowing can decrease N2O emissions and synergistically obtain high grain yields and NUEs, especially at higher N rates.\nAlthough the application of higher N rates can improve the yield of winter wheat, it also reduces NUE and increases N2O emissions, regardless of sowing pattern. Moreover, higher N fertilizer application may decrease profits and increase carbon emissions considering the manufacture and transport of agricultural products. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the joint goals of increasing grain yield and reducing N rate. Combining WB sowing with the use of new controlled-release fertilizers or partial substitution of chemical N with manure may be efficient pathways to synergistically improve grain yield and reduce N input in the future."
