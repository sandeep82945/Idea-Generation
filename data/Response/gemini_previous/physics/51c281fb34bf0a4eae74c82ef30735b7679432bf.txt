1. **Investigate the in vivo antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds:** The current study evaluated the antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds in vitro. Future research could extend these investigations to in vivo models to assess their efficacy and safety in a more complex biological system.


2. **Explore the structure-activity relationship of the isolated compounds:** The study identified seven known compounds from Helichrysum rutilans. Future research could investigate the structure-activity relationship of these compounds to determine the specific structural features responsible for their antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory activities. This knowledge could guide the design of more potent and selective compounds.


3. **Evaluate the potential synergistic effects of the isolated compounds:** The study evaluated the antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds individually. Future research could investigate the potential synergistic effects of these compounds when combined. This could lead to the development of more effective antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory formulations.


4. **Investigate the bioavailability and metabolism of the isolated compounds:** The study did not evaluate the bioavailability and metabolism of the isolated compounds. Future research could investigate these aspects to determine the extent to which the compounds are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body. This information is essential for assessing the safety and efficacy of the compounds in vivo.


5. **Explore the potential applications of the isolated compounds in cosmetic and nutraceutical formulations:** The study suggests that the isolated compounds have potential applications in cosmetic and nutraceutical formulations. Future research could investigate the stability, compatibility, and efficacy of these compounds in various cosmetic and nutraceutical formulations. This could lead to the development of new products with improved antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory properties.
