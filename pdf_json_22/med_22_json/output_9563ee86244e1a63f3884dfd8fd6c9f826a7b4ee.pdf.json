    "abstractText": "Channa striatus (CS), or snakehead murrel, is an obligate air-breathing freshwater fish. Besides its wound healing properties, CS has also been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in multiple studies. While there are anti-inflammatory medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), their long-term use is associated with an increased risk of peptic ulcers, acute renal failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Thus, it is essential to look at natural methods such as CS extract. While there is an abundant number of investigative studies on the inflammatory properties of CS, the quality of these studies has not been evaluated effectively. Thus, this review aims to summarise, evaluate, and critically appraise currently available literature regarding the anti-inflammatory properties of CS extract. This is done by performing a search using four databases, namely Google Scholar, Embase via Elsevier, Scopus, and Web of Science, with the following terms: Channa striatus AND inflammation. Fromour review, CS has been experimentally shown to positively affect inflammatory conditions such as gastric ulcers, dermatitis, osteoarthritis, and allergic rhinitis. Beneficial effects were also found on inflammation in the presence of tuberculosis and in situations that involve inflammation, such as wound healing. While CS clearly has potential for treating inflammatory conditions, much work needs to be done on identifying and isolating the active constituents before exact mechanisms of action can be worked out to develop future anti-inflammatory medications.",

Besides its wound healing properties, CS has also been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in multiple studies.

Fromour review, CS has been experimentally shown to positively affect inflammatory conditions such as gastric ulcers, dermatitis, osteoarthritis, and allergic rhinitis. Beneficial effects were also found on inflammation in the presence of tuberculosis and in situations that involve inflammation, such as wound healing. While CS clearly has potential for treating inflammatory conditions, much work needs to be done on identifying and isolating the active constituents before exact mechanisms of action can be worked out to develop future anti-inflammatory medications.\nKEYWORDS\ntraditional medicine, Channa striatus, inflammation, anti-inflammatory, natural product\nIntroduction\nChanna striatus (CS), or snakeheadmurrel, is an obligate air-breathing freshwater fish that inhabits all types of water bodies from small ditches to rice fields, rivers, and lakes (Figure 1). It can be found across tropical and subtropical Asian countries from Pakistan and India to Southeast Asia and Southern China (Hossain et al, 2008; Shafri and Abdul Manan, 2012). It belongs to the Channidae family, which has been around since 50million years ago, with an origin purportedly from the ancient Himalayan Valley (Madeleine, 2004)."

These pharmacological properties may be contributed by the fact that CS extract contains high levels of major amino acids such as glycine, alanine, lysine, aspartic acid, and proline, as well as fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid and arachidonic acid (Shafri and Abdul Manan, 2012; Zakaria et al., 2007; Zuraini et al., 2006). Glycine makes up human skin collagen and can also be a polypeptide involved in wound healing together with other amino acids such as alanine, leucine, and phenylalanine, all of which are found in CS extract (Zakaria et al., 2007). Most of these are found in the fillet, but some are found in CS fish roe as well. Roe protein concentrates prepared from CS were also reported to have high antioxidant activity, thus warranting its selection as a functional ingredient in preparing specialty food products (Galla et al, 2012).\nTraditionally, CS or more locally known as \u2018Haruan\u2019 fish, is encouraged to be consumed as part of a post-partum diet, especially for womenwho underwent a cesarean section, because it is believed that CS enhances wound healing as well as improves pain and trauma (Poh et al, 2005; Haniffa et al, 2014). In Malaysia, CS is commonly prepared by frying, roasting, or cooking with curry among the Malay community. Broth or fish tonic made from CS extract are also quite popular as an \u201cenergy-restoring\u201d diet (Shafri and Abdul Manan, 2012).\nInflammation is a tissue response to injury caused by hazardous chemicals, physical trauma, or pathological threats (Suhendi et al, 2019). Inflammation is a cascade of events promoted by inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serotonin, kinins, prostaglandins, and interferons (Larsen and Henson, 1983; Weissmann, 2013). Chronic inflammation is universally associated with various diseases such as obesity, cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disorders (Okin and Medzhitov, 2012). The prevalence of such diseases varies, with symptomatic osteoarthritis occurring in around 10%\u201313% of Americans older than 60 (Zhang and Jordan, 2010) and allergic rhinitis afflicting an average of 23% of adults in several European countries (Bauchau and Durham, 2004). While there are anti-inflammatory medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), their longterm use is associated with an increased risk of peptic ulcers, acute renal failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction (Marcum and Hanlon, 2010). Anti-inflammatory drugs also interfere with essential cellular pathways (Ghosh et al., 2016). Combined with the risks associated with their chronic use, they are ineffective for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, it is essential to look at natural methods such as CS extract. While there is an abundant number of investigative studies on the inflammatory properties of CS, the quality of these studies has not been evaluated effectively. Thus, this review aims to summarise,\nevaluate, and critically appraise currently available literature regarding the anti-inflammatory properties of CS extract. To our knowledge, this is the first review to evaluate the highly beneficial characteristic of CS extract, therefore establishing this review as a timely topic that may propagate the development of effective future anti-inflammatory interventions for a growing number of debilitating inflammatory diseases, with minimal consequences."

Diclofenac sodium was also given as a positive control. From the results, it could be concluded that the CS extract affects reducing edema volume. Based on statistical tests, diclofenac sodium, CS Powder (CSP), Nephelium lappaceum fruit peel extract (NPLE), and a combination of CSP and NPLE showed significantly different results (p < 0.05) compared with the negative controls. Interestingly, the combination treatment consisting of CSP and NPLE extract did not show a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than the single extract treatment. (Suhendi et al., 2019).\nHowever, we did find some discrepancies in the information given by this journal article. It is unclear if the study was done on rats or mice because these two words seemed to be used interchangeably.

It was found that CS extract exerted significant antiulcer activity in both models of gastric ulcer. CS extract did not change the volume and pH of gastric juice but reduced the total acidity of gastric juice at lower doses. The antiulcer activity by CS extract was reversed by N-methylamide (NEM) but not by NG-omega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME).\nTherefore, the antiulcer activity demonstrated by CS extract was modulated via its cytoprotective, but not anti-secretory effect, and in the presence of sulfhydryl compounds, but not nitric oxide (NO) (Azemi et al., 2018)."

A significant reduction of mouse ear thickness by the CS creams was observed compared to TPA alone group (negative control). All concentrations of CS creams produced comparable effects to hydrocortisone (H-cort), the positive control.\nHistological analysis revealed suppression of inflammatory cell infiltration and epidermal hyperplasia, noticeable under \u00d7400 magnification. The reduction of dermal edema can also be observed, which was more visible under \u00d7100 magnification. Gene expression analysis showed that all concentrations of CS cream downregulated the expression of TNF-\u03b1, with a significant reduction in a dosedependent manner (Isa et al., 2016).\nIn another study by Abedi et al. (2012), the antiinflammatory activity of CS-based cream on ear thickness and myeloperoxidase activity was studied using croton oil-induced ear edema. The effects were compared to hydrocortisone 1% cream as the positive control. It was found that all percentages of CS cream (1%, 5%, and 10%) significantly inhibited edema at 4 h and 24 h after croton oil application. Myeloperoxidase assays results showed that applications of these three dosages of CS cream blocked the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the dermis.

The levels of serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were also determined.

The study evaluated the effects of CS on tensile strength, epithelialization, and fibroblastic proliferation. CS extract treatment groups demonstrated better tensile strength and significantly higher epithelial and fibroblast cell counts than placebo control (Hassan et al., 2020). A similar study also found that CS has similar positive effects on tensile strength and epithelial and fibroblast cell counts in malnourished male Wistar Kyoto rats when given orally in tablet form and applied topically as a cream (Pasha et al, 2015).\nIn a separate study, the wound healing effect of CS extract spray was studied in Sprague Dawley rats. Here, CS extract was formulated in an aerosol system, producing a film for wound dressing. CS spray increased the tensile strength of the incision wound and sped up the wound contraction process. This showed that the CS water spray is effective and safe for application to incision and burn injuries (Laila et al., 2011).\nAnother study by Tamales et al, (2016) was done to study the effect of CS extract on the reepithelization count in the wound healing process. An incision was made in the buccal mucosa area of Galur Wistar rats, and CS extract was administered orally. It was found that CS extract treatment increased epithelial thickness count compared to the negative control, but the difference was not significant (Tamales et al., 2016).\nIn a randomized, double-blinded study amongst post-Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS) women, CS extract was found to have significant effects on IL-6, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), and Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) levels between the CS treatment group and placebo group. These factors are involved in different wound healing phases, which suggests that CS extract has potential wound healing properties (Omar et al, 2020). Ab Wahab et al. (2015) found that CS extract significantly improved visual analog scale (VAS) and patient satisfaction score (PSS) in post-LSCS women in a separate study. Although there was no significant effect on postoperative pain and wound evaluation scale (WES), CS extract produced a marked difference in wound cosmetic appearance (Ab Wahab et al., 2015).\nIn a separate randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled study among post LSCS women, however, there were no significant differences in the inflammatory markers during wound healing between the CS extract group and the placebo group (Shafii et al., 2017)."

There were no significant differences between groups regarding nasal discharge, sneezing, palate itchiness, and smell score.

These conditions were gastric ulcers, dermatitis, osteoarthritis, and allergic rhinitis. Beneficial effects of CS were also found in wound healing as well as on inflammation in the presence of tuberculosis. All the studies in this review used some form of CS extract rather than working with isolated extract constituents. Nevertheless, the studies in the review pointed out several constituents which could be responsible for the beneficial effect of CS extract. These include albumin (Suhendi et al., 2019), the fatty acids linoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, and N-arachidonylglycine, (Abedi et al., 2012), omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins A, B, E, and D, and minerals such as calcium, sodium, magnesium, and zinc (Paliliewu et al., 2013), omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (Susibalan et al., 2018). Excluding the ubiquitous vitamins and minerals, albumin and fatty acids appear to be leading candidates for the anti-inflammatory action seen in CS extract. The two constituents are related as although albumin has antioxidant properties due to its ability to scavenge free radicals, it is also capable of binding fatty acids (Roche et al, 2008). Thus, not only is albumin anti-inflammatory, but by binding fatty acids and facilitating its transport around the body (van der Vusse, 2009), albumin could be enhancing the anti-inflammatory effects of fatty acids. Omega-3 and 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Wall et al, 2010), the omega-9 fatty acid, oleic acid (Santamarina et al., 2021), and stearic acid (Pan et al., 2010) are also are known to be anti-inflammatory. Curiously, CS extract also contains arachidonic acid (Che Ku Daud et al, 2010), a known contributor to inflammation. It is possible that CS extract has\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08\na net anti-inflammatory effect overall due to its other constituents, or it could be due to CS extract also containing N-arachidonylglycine (Abdul Kadir et al., 2019), which is derived from arachidonic acid but inhibits inflammation instead (Succar et al, 2007).\nKnowing the possible active constituents of CS extract is only half the battle won as the mechanism by which it works is also essential. However, we found that a majority of the studies in the review attributed the positive effects of CS extract on the inflammatory conditions to its anti-inflammatory properties in general without identifying specific mechanisms. One of the rare studies in the review that did postulate a mechanism stated that CS extract has a cytoprotective effect by positively modulating the free radical scavenging action of non-protein sulfhydryl compounds (Azemi et al., 2018). Another study pointed to the inhibition of inflammatory cells due to a downregulation of TNF\u03b1 (Isa et al., 2016). Different research hypothesized the mechanism to be a downregulation of not only TNF-\u03b1 but also IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 (Paliliewu et al., 2013). The final study pointed towards a reduction in IgE levels and the chemokines, IL5 and IL-8 (Susibalan et al., 2018). While an in-depth discussion regarding the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory action is outside the scope of this review, the previously postulated mechanisms of action point to the involvement of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway due to the participation of IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, and IL -5 (Banerjee et al, 2017). Notably however, IL-10 is an antiinflammatory cytokine (Iyer & Cheng, 2012), and therefore its apparent downregulation could be due to a lack of need because of the overall anti-inflammatory effect of the CS extract, rather than the extract directly suppressing it.\nOn the other hand, the involvement of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 suggests an effect on the Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (Bradley, 2008). In the case of allergic inflammatory responses, the reduction in IgE levels is likely a consequence of a reduction in IL-5 levels, possibly by interfering with its production by T-helper 2 cells. This review also included articles looking into wound healing.While the study on wound healing did not look into the anti-inflammatory effects of CS extract specifically, inflammation is a normal part of wound healing. However, wound healing becomes impaired when the inflammation becomes excessive or persistent (Eming et al, 2007). Thus, the wound healing properties of CS extract could also be related to its ability to dampen the inflammatory response."

Beneficial effects were also found on inflammation in the presence of tuberculosis and in situations that involve\ninflammation in some capacity, such as wound healing. While we were able to suggest several anti-inflammatory pathways that CS might act upon, the use of CS extract by all the studies in this review rather than isolated constituents somewhat clouded the exact mechanisms of action. CS extract is anti-inflammatory overall, even though it contains arachidonic acid, which is pro-inflammatory. While CS clearly has potential for treating inflammatory conditions, more work needs to be done on identifying and isolating the active constituents before exact mechanisms of action can be worked out. Proirities should lie in studying the active compounds which contributes to the pharmacological activities of CS extract. Future pre-clinical and clinical studies can be done using these compounds instead of the crude extract. The candidates for active constituents pointed out in this review will hopefully help in the search for future antiinflammatory medications."
