    "abstractText": "Objectives: Cognition plays a central role for diagnosing and characterizing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, the complex associations among cognitive functions are largely unknown in DLB. To fill this gap, we compared the cognitive connectome of DLB patients, healthy controls (HC) and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Methods: We obtained data from the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center (NIA/NIH Grant U24-AG072122). We built separate cognitive connectomes for DLB (n=104), HC (n= 3703), and AD (n=1985) groups using pairwise correlations between 24 cognitive variables mapping multiple cognitive functions. The cognitive connectomes in DLB, HC, and AD groups were compared using standard global and nodal graph measures of centrality, integration, and segregation. Results: In global connectome measures, DLB patients showed a higher global efficiency (integration) and lower transitivity (segregation) than HCs and AD. Nodal connectome measures showed a higher global efficiency in most cognitive functions in DLB compared to HCs. Additionally, we found a lower local efficiency (segregation) and nodal strength (centrality) in memory variables and a higher participation coefficient in executive variables (centrality) in DLB compared with both HCs and AD. Conclusions: The cognitive connectome in DLB showed a signature dedifferentiation pattern of aberrant correlations. Executive, processing speed and attention functions played a central role in the cognitive connectome of DLB patients. Furthermore, the role of executive and memory functions in the cognitive connectome distinguished DLB and .

            "text": "Objectives: Cognition plays a central role for diagnosing and characterizing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, the complex associations among cognitive functions are largely unknown in DLB. To fill this gap, we compared the cognitive connectome of DLB patients, healthy controls (HC) and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).\nMethods: We obtained data from the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center (NIA/NIH Grant U24-AG072122). We built separate cognitive connectomes for DLB (n=104), HC (n= 3703), and AD (n=1985) groups using pairwise correlations between 24 cognitive variables mapping multiple cognitive functions. The cognitive connectomes in DLB, HC, and AD groups were compared using standard global and nodal graph measures of centrality, integration, and segregation.\nResults: In global connectome measures, DLB patients showed a higher global efficiency (integration) and lower transitivity (segregation) than HCs and AD. Nodal connectome measures showed a higher global efficiency in most cognitive functions in DLB compared to HCs. Additionally, we found a lower local efficiency (segregation) and nodal strength (centrality) in memory variables and a higher participation coefficient in executive variables (centrality) in DLB compared with both HCs and AD.\nConclusions: The cognitive connectome in DLB showed a signature dedifferentiation pattern of aberrant correlations. Executive, processing speed and attention functions played a central role in the cognitive connectome of DLB patients. Furthermore, the role of executive and memory functions in the cognitive connectome distinguished DLB and\nNOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.\nAD patients. These findings may help advance our understanding of the clinical phenotype in DLB, and continue to improve the challenging differential diagnosis between DLB and AD.\nBACKGROUND\nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common neurodegenerative\ndementias (1). The essential criterion for diagnosing DLB is a progressive cognitive decline (2). Furthermore, cognitive decline not only plays an important role in the diagnosis of DLB but also its differential diagnosis with other dementias (3\u20135). The typical cognitive profile of DLB includes alterations in attention, executive functions, and visual abilities, while other domains, such as memory, can be involved at later stages of the disease (2).\nThe traditional approach to investigating cognition in DLB focuses on a particular\ncognitive function and uses univariate statistical analysis to compare the performance with healthy controls or other relevant dementias such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) or Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia (6\u20138). Although the univariate approach can provide information on the cognitive profile of DLB patients, it falls short in elucidating the complex associations between cognitive functions. This limitation has enabled increased interest in multivariate approaches to study cognition in DLB and prodromal stages, promoting a more integrated understanding of cognitive functioning (9\u201312). In this line, it has been suggested that processing speed mediates the performance in working memory and memory in prodromal DLB (12). It has also been suggested that executive deficits may underlie problems in verbal fluency or that deficits in semantic memory and visual functions may influence the deficits observed in naming (13).\nThe \u201ccognitive connectome\u201d (14) is a new concept and methodology that\ncomprehensively explains the complex organization and relationships between cognitive functions. Using graph theory analysis on cognitive variables provides rich data on the centrality of specific cognitive functions in the connectome and information on the integration and segregation of cognition (15). While the cognitive connectome has been investigated in normal aging and some disorders such as epilepsy, acquired brain injury, vascular encephalopathy, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia (14\u201320), no study to date has characterized the cognitive connectome in DLB. The characterization of the cognitive connectome in DLB could have implications for advancing our understanding of its complex phenotype. Moreover, it could contribute to improve the differential diagnosis of DLB by integrating data profiles instead of evaluating each neuropsychological function separately in an \u201cunivariate\u201d manner. Such approach will better align with how clinicians interpret cognitive data.\nIn this study, we introduced graph theory analysis on cognitive variables in DLB\nto investigate its cognitive connectome. The first objective was to characterize the cognitive connectome in DLB by comparing it with a group of healthy controls (HCs). The second objective was to compare the cognitive connectome of DLB and AD patients, as this is the most common comparison for differential diagnosis of DLB in the clinical setting. We hypothesized prominent alterations of the cognitive connectome in DLB compared to HCs, particularly involving attention, executive, and visual functions. At the same time, the differences with AD patients would be more modest and likely extend to memory domains."

Patients aged \u2265 45 years and diagnosed with DLB or AD were included (2,22). Clinical severity was assessed with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (23). Core clinical features of DLB were determined by the clinician\u2019s judgment, including fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, probable REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and parkinsonism. We also included a group of HCs who demonstrated unimpaired cognition on clinical assessment.\nAll participants were required to have data available on all the cognitive variables\nselected to build the connectome (see next section). For all the participants, the exclusion criteria were having a clinical history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, craniocerebral trauma, substance abuse, and uncorrected vision or hearing problems. All participants gave written informed consent, and local Institutional Review Boards approved the study.\nCognitive measures and construction of the cognitive connectome\nThe neuropsychological protocol of the NACC database is fully described\nelsewhere (21). We included 25 cognitive variables mapping multiple cognitive functions, as follows: visuoconstructive functions, visual and verbal episodic memory, processing speed, attention, executive functions, language, and orientation.\nBefore constructing the cognitive connectome, we carefully inspected the\ndistribution and nature of all the 25 cognitive variables. We inverted the scores when necessary, so that higher scores always indicated a better performance and transformed variables with a heavily skewed distribution. Moreover, since age, sex, and education influence cognitive performance, we adjusted cognitive variables for these confounding factors using multiple linear regression or logistic regression (24). After these steps, data was inspected again to ensure that variables in the new dataset were normally distributed. We observed a variable which did not follow a normal distribution. This variable was finally included as an error variable and was especially informative in a pathological sample. Thus, we used Spearman correlation coefficients to define the edges of the cognitive connectome. At that point, we observed that one variable was barely correlated to the rest of the variables (i.e., repetition errors in phonemic fluency) and was thus excluded from the analysis since we aimed for modelling connectomes with highly correlated variables. The 24 cognitive variables were used to construct a cognitive connectome for each group, i.e., DLB, AD, and HCs (Table 1).\nFollowing two previous studies on cognitive connectomes in acquired brain injury\nand epilepsy, we used positive and negative correlations (15,20). Additionally, we excluded self-connections from the correlation matrices. Next, correlation matrices were binarized by thresholding coefficients at a range of densities based on the cognitive connectome of the HC group. Preliminary analysis of the cognitive connectome of HCs showed that MoCA variables tended to form a cluster of correlations, increasing the threshold density at which other nodes became connected. We thus built a simplified\nconnectome without MoCA variables to determine the range of densities. At the minimum density (10%), nodes tended to be connected to at least one other node.

Compared with the HC group, most correlations within and between cognitive functions were generally weaker in DLB. Visual inspection of the cognitive connectome in AD showed a predominance of weak correlations within and between cognitive functions. Comparisons between the DLB and AD groups revealed more moderate differences than the HC group. Most correlations within and between cognitive functions were weaker in DLB compared to AD, especially in visual and verbal memory functions.\nGlobal connectome measures analysis\nFigure 3 shows the quantitative differences of the DLB patients compared to the\nHC and AD groups in global connectome measures.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We characterized the cognitive connectome in DLB patients compared to by HCs\nand AD patients. Our results showed differences in centrality, integration, and segregation measures for DLB compared to HCs and AD groups.\nOur first objective was to characterize the cognitive connectome of DLB patients\ncompared to a HC group. Visual inspection of the cognitive connectome of DLB patients\nshowed that, compared to HCs, DLB patients had a diffuse pattern of uniformly weak correlations within and between cognitive functions. This diffuse pattern was corroborated by quantitative analyses of global and nodal connectome measures, characterized as a less segregated connectome in the context of a higher global efficiency. Because DLB patients performed worse than HCs in all cognitive domains, this combination of segregation and integration (efficiency) findings should be interpreted as a pattern of dedifferentiation (38). The dedifferentiation refers to a higher intercorrelation between cognitive functions and has been associated with reduced neural specificity to cognitive processes (38\u201340). Previous studies have found that higher global efficiency is related to lower cognitive performance in middle-age and older adults (14,41). The presence of uniformly weak correlations was also evidenced in quantitative analyses at a global and nodal level by the scarce differences found in the centrality measure of strength, which is based on the magnitude of correlations. The diffuse and dedifferentiation pattern found in DLB reflects greater connectome-wide interconnectivity and lower local interconnectivity between neighboring cognitive functions, making it difficult to differentiate segregated groups of cognitive functions in the cognitive connectome of DLB. This dedifferentiation pattern was associated with a worse performance across all cognitive functions in the DLB group. Specifically, the higher integration found in DLB cognitive connectome might reflect a tendency among pathological groups to show concordance in their dysfunction across a range of different cognitive functions (19). Interestingly, two previous functional and metabolic imaging studies also found a dedifferentiation pattern, supporting our findings (42,43) and suggesting that the results of our study could be a reflection of the impairments observed in brain network functioning. However, there are contrary results in other functional or metabolic neuroimaging studies applying graph theory (e.g.45\u201347). This is a reminder that although some studies have found associations between changes in brain network functioning and cognition (42), these are two different modalities for which one could not expect complete agreement in the results. In this context, complementing results across distinct modalities would improve our understanding of the relationship between brain networks and cognition connectome functioning.\nFurthermore, nodal measures pinpointed connectome impairments in specific\ncognitive functions. Specifically, we observed a higher participation in executive, processing speed, and attention in DLB, which indicates that these cognitive functions have a more prominent role as connector hubs in the cognitive connectome of DLB. Our results are in line with the prominent role of executive functions in regulating other cognitive functions (47), as well as the role of processing speed and attention as central functions that influence other cognitive functions (18,48,49), and expand these results suggesting that impairment in these cognitive functions could be driving the performance in other cognitive functions to a greater extend in DLB compared to HCs. Additionally, the central position of hub nodes in the connectome carries the risk of becoming highly disruptive to the whole connectome in case of failure (50). The fact that attention emerged as an important connector hub in DLB supports the idea that the cognitive fluctuations and the pronounced variation in attention present in the DLB group could have affected the characteristics of its cognitive connectome. The relevance of attention as connector hub highlights the potential of the cognitive connectome to capture the effect of cognitive fluctuations on other cognitive functions in DLB. Moreover, our results on cognitive hubs\nare in line with some neuroimaging studies showing consistent disruptions in attention networks and their connections to other brain regions (51). Furthermore, we also observed impairments in participation in visual and verbal memory variables in DLB compared to HC. In particular, the memory variables with higher participation coefficients had an important executive component (i.e., retrieval), whereas those with lower participation coefficients were related to consolidation processes. These results are in line with a review that suggested that deficits in recall in DLB are secondary to impairment of executive functions (13) and extend this information, suggesting that memory variables with an executive component could be more central in the cognitive connectome of DLB patients and thus, can be driving or influencing the performance in other cognitive variables to a greater extent than in the cognitive connectome of HCs.\nOur second objective was to investigate the cognitive connectome of DLB\ncompared to an AD group. While differences were less extensive than in comparison with HC in the visual inspection of the cognitive connectomes, the global comparisons between DLB and AD support the idea that the pattern of dedifferentiation not only characterizes DLB compared to cognitively normal people but also the AD group. Although previous studies indicated that AD also presents alterations in integration and segregation measures in the cognitive connectome (16,19), our results showed that this alteration seems more pronounced in DLB. This finding suggests that a pronounced dedifferentiation pattern could indicate DLB when compared to AD patients, which is especially relevant as DLB is often misdiagnosed as AD (52). It should be noted that, contrary to findings in the comparison between DLB and HC, we found differences in centrality at a global level between DLB and AD. Specifically, we observed a lower average strength in DLB compared to AD, which may be driven by the presence of generally weaker correlations in DLB, especially in visual and verbal memory functions. This result reinforces the idea that DLB shows a greater pattern of dedifferentiation. Differences in nodal measures between DLB and AD groups complemented the global results. When comparing DLB with AD, we found an alteration in centrality measures at a nodal level, particularly regarding nodal strength. More precisely, we observed a reduced nodal strength in DLB, especially in variables related to consolidation processes in verbal memory (e.g., MoCA-Recognition/Category cue). This reflects the less central role of consolidation processes in DLB as opposed to AD, with the higher impairment in consolidation processes in AD having a greater disruptive effect on the performance in other cognitive functions (8). In this line, previous studies with AD patients and the cognitive connectome analysis approach have reported an important role of memory functions in the connectome of AD and its reorganization in different stages of the disease (16,17,19). However, to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that this is a differential characteristic of the cognitive connectome between DLB and AD. In contrast, we observed less significant differences in centrality when considering the participation coefficient compared to nodal strength. This might suggest that graph measures computed from weighted networks (before binarization, e.g. nodal strength) may be more sensitive to subtle differences such as those between DLB and AD than graph measures computed from binary networks (e.g. participation). Specifically, we observed a higher participation coefficient in one executive variable, suggesting that this aspect is not only a feature of DLB compared with HC but is also differentiating DLB patients from AD patients. Specifically, a semantic fluency variable showed higher participation in DLB compared\nwith both HC and AD. It is worth noting that this variable not only has an important executive component but also performance in this task is determined by processing speed and attention which are typically impaired in DLB. Higher participation coefficients in this variable highlight the prominent role of executive functions as hubs that regulate other cognitive functions, especially in DLB. The significant differences in centrality measures between DLB and AD in our study, underscores the potential of cognitive connectome analysis to characterize the differential cognitive profile between distinct diagnostic groups as well as the relevance of the shift in centrality between cognitive domains to identify cognitive profiles indicative of underlying diseases (19). Furthermore, we found higher global efficiency in the DLB group in one executive variable at a nodal level which, following previous studies, could be related to lower performance (14,41). However, the results in global efficiency in this executive function contrast with the lack of differences observed in the ANCOVA, suggesting that graph theory can capture differences that were not captured by more commonly employed methods in cognition such as univariate analyses. Although we did not find differences between DLB and AD in local efficiency at a global level, our results suggest that there are differences at a nodal level. Of note, we found a predominant reduction of local efficiency in DLB in verbal and visual episodic memory variables. Similar to global efficiency, this reduction in local efficiency may reflect the characteristic higher performance in memory functions in DLB compared with AD (4).\nOur findings could have clinical implications. Knowing how cognitive functions\nare associated with each other and which are central to the cognitive connectome may help improve the challenging differential diagnosis between DLB and AD and help advance in designing more efficient interventions in DLB. Interestingly, a recent systematic review suggested that connectivity measures can potentially become suitable biomarkers for DLB (51). Our results extend this idea and suggest that cognitive connectome measures may also be promising indicators for the presence of DLB, especially considering that cognitive deficits can appear early in the disease (53).\nThis study has some limitations. The different number of cognitive variables\nrepresenting each cognitive function may have led to an underrepresentation of some cognitive domains. This study also lacks pathological confirmation for the DLB diagnosis. However, the longitudinal aspect of the NACC database will allow to have pathological confirmation when participants undergo autopsy.\nIn conclusion, we identified a cognitive connectome in DLB characterized by a\ndedifferentiation pattern compared with HCs and AD patients. Executive, processing speed, and attention functions played a central role in the cognitive connectome of DLB compared HCs. Furthermore, our data suggest that executive functions and memory functions and their complex associations with other cognitive functions play a distinct role in the cognitive connectome of DLB compared with AD. A novelty of our study is the use of graph theory to investigate the cognitive connectome in DLB. Our findings on the complex organization of cognition in DLB complement alterations in the brain network of DLB patients were revealed by neuroimaging studies. Moreover, our results reinforce the idea that connectivity measures, not only functional MRI but also cognitive, can potentially become suitable DLB indicators in the future. One of the next challenges would be the integration of the cognitive connectome with the more studied brain\nconnectome from structural and functional neuroimaging studies in DLB. Such integration could have relevant implications for research and the clinical field in DLB."
