            "text": "Fabrication of nanometer-sized particles (NPs) is a very popular and rapidly developing field for various branches of science such as physics, chemistry, biology and bioengineering [1, 2]. They are commonly used in daily life such as clothing, self-cleaning windows, hydrophobic-coated surfaces [3, 4, 5]. The nanoparticles ranging in size from 1 to 100 nm havemany advantages due to confinement of the features such as thermal conductivity, chemical stability, opticalelectrical and catalytic properties [3, 6] into a very small size as well as their larger surface area-volume ratios compared with their bulk form [7, 8, 9].\nAmong them, metal nanoparticles (especially Ag) are quite important for drug delivery because of their antimicrobial, antifungal and antibacterial effects [10, 11] and they are widely used in many technological and industrial areas such as optics, medicine, food safety and cosmetics [12, 13]. There are many techniques to fabricate metal nanoparticles that can be classified into; top-down and bottom-up processes [14]. Although mechanical milling, chemical etching, sputtering and laser ablation can be given as an example in topdown method; chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel and spray pyrolysis can be listed for gathering molecules or atoms by chemical reactions for bottom-up approach [15].\nObtaining nanoparticles by physical and chemical methods have been studied for a long time [16, 17]. However, these methods require organic passivation agents to prevent nanoparticles from aggregation. Most of passivation agents\n\u2217Corresponding author Email address: rsahin@itu.edu.tr (R.

Besides they require high cost and hazardous chemicals and special environmental conditions for synthesis such as temperature, pressure or pH.However, green synthesis of nanoparticles is cheap, straight-forward and less-toxic because of employing enviromentally friendly or toxic-free biological reagents such as plant, bacterial cell, algae and fungi for reduction from the metal salts [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Plant extracts have attracted great interest in the greensynthesis of different types of nanoparticles compared to other bio-molecules due to their easy availability, biocompatibility, cost-effectiveness, and high stability [26, 27, 28, 29]. The main components in a green synthesis are a plant extract of interest and the solution containing metal ion. The plant extract (such as mulberry leaves [30]) creates a medium to reduce ofmetal ions and provides a capping agent to stabilize the synthesized nanoparticles. Plant extracts mostly contain phenolic compounds, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids and protiens which provide low-cost and non-hazardaous bioreduction of metal ions to metal nanoparticles (i.e. Ag+ ions to Ag0) [31].\nSilver nanoparticles have been synthesized by many researchers using different plant extracts by green synthesis approach in the literature [32, 33, 34, 35]. In the studies, the researchers havemainly focused on the effects of experimental conditions on size and chemical composition of the fabricated silver nanoparticles. However, there is not much work to develop a detailed understanding about silver nanoparticle formation kinetics and mechanism in such complex plant extracts. A few studies were done on the kinetics on silver nanoparticle formation. Okafor et al. synthesized silver nanoparticles at 75 \u25e6C and investigated the reaction kinetics and biological activities [36]. Amini et al. fabricated silver nanoparticle with Avena Sativa aqueous extract and\nE.Z. Okka, T. Tongur, T.T. Aytas, M. Yilmaz, \u00d6. Topel and R. Sahin: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 1 of 9\nhydro-alcoholic extract at different temperatures and concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution. The resultsshowed that both diameter of the synthesized nanoparticles were inversely proportional to the temperature and the amount of nanoparticles depended on the AgNO3 concentration.Thesynthesis conditions did not affect the size of nanoparticles [37]. Prathna et al. tried to determine the temporal evolution of silver nanoparticles over time using experimental and theoretical models. Their results indicated that particles formation starts in as less as 2 hours reaction time. The agglomeration tendency increased at after the 4th hour of interaction. The particles conformed the Lifshitz-SlyozovWagner kinetics until 3.5 hours reaction time [38]. In another work Hussain et al. carried out kinetic measurement of fabricated silver nanoparticles by green synthesis method. Their results showed that silver-mirror reaction provides an easy rout to prepare quantum dots. The formation kinetics of silver nanoparticles is independent from glucose concentration and the nucleation rate was proportional with ammonica [39].\nIn the present study, we therefore investigated the formation kinetics of silver nanoparticles in Inula Viscosa extract to control the particle formation mechanism and to develop a detailed understanding about silver nanoparticle fabrication in plant extracts. Inula Viscosa is a self-growing species belonging to the Asteraceae family, which is common in theMediterranean region. It contains many bioactive components such as guainolides, sesquiterpenes, lactones, flavonoids and essential oils [40]. Therefore, it does not only exhibit reducing and stabilizing properties during nanoparticle synthesis but also has high biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-septic, antipyretic, antibacterial, anti-fungal [41, 42, 43]. In addition, Inula Viscosa reduces the drug resistance of cancer cells so it can be preferred in phototherapy for supporting chemotherapy [44].\nConsequently, the synthesized silver nanoparticles in Inula Viscosa extract are promising to have important biological activities such as antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-cancer etc. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by green synthesis approach using Inula Viscosa extract at room temperature. The effects of the synthesis conditions such as concentration, reaction time and light on silver nanoparticle formation, particle size and morphology by means of UVVIS spectrophotometry, STEM microscopy as well as Raman and FTIR spectrometry. The formation kinetics of silver nanoparticles were also studied by spectrophotometric method using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer."

Besides, formation and growth kinetics of silver nanoparticles in the Inula Viscosa extract were investigated to explore the optimum synthesis conditions. For this, three different initial silver (I) ion concentrations (1.15 mM, 2.30 mM and 4.60 mM) were employed for the same amount of Inula Viscosa extract and time-dependent nanoparticle formation was acquired by a\nUV/VIS spectrometer in the spectral range of 350-800 nm. Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra measured for above silver (I) ion concentrations. Characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of silver nanoparticles between 400- 500 nm is a unique evident for the presence of silver nanoparticles. Any shift in the peak position gives important information about the size and the formation mechanism of silver nanoparticles during a standard synthesis [45, 46]. From the absorption spectra in Fig.2, it can be seen that the peak positions stayed nearly unchanged within the standard deviation limits in time, especially for the higher initial silver (I) ion concentrations (See Figs.2a-d). The peak position at the higher concentrations (2.3 mM and 4.6 mM) keeps its spectral position constant as 450 nm through 24 hours (Fig. 2d). This means that silver nanoparticle formation regularly progresses with a significant size distribution under the concentrated silver (I) ion conditions. In the diluted synthesis conditions such as 1.15mM, the peak position reached a constant value within 2 hours and stayed stable along 24 hours even if a broad variation in the spectrum was observed in the first four hours (see Fig. 2a). However, increasing of silver nanoparticle concentration with progressing the reaction allows the nanoparticle formation reaction to proceed more regularly in the synthesis conditions with the higher concentrations (2.3 mM and 4.6 mM). Furthermore, the absorption spectrum was getting narrower in time (Fig. 2b and 2c). In addition, this is also observed by increasing initial silver (I) ion concentration. Therefore, this is a clear evident that higher silver ion concentration during the synthesis regulates the reduction reaction so that silver nanoparticles having same mean sizes can form in Inula Viscosa extract.\ninitial silver (I) ion concentrations.

Silver nanoparticles were also synthesized in dark conditions, however it was observed that the size and morphology of silver nanoparticles in Inula Viscosa extract was not affected from the lightened and dark conditions. Dark conditions only affect the silver nanoparticle formation rate, and so the nanoparticle concentration in the reaction media (see the dashed line in Fig.2, Fig.3(h) and Tab.1). Consequently, the synthesis of silver nanoparticles in Inula Viscosa extract is much dependent on the nature of the Inula Viscosa extract.\nThe previous study [41] shows that the Inula Viscosa plant contains flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, chlorogenic acid, rutin that a subgroup of polyphenols. It was known that flavonoids stabilize silver nanoparticles, yield homogeneous particle distribution and functioned as capping and reducing agent [47, 48]. Therefore it can be said that the flavonoids of Inula Viscosa extract ensured to obtain silver nanoparticles with a reaction of AgNO3 solution. Theeffects of the plant extract ingredients to silver nanoparticles formation were analyzed in detailed by FTIR measurements to support this assumption. The results were given in Section 2.2.\nGrowth kinetics of silver nanoparticles were also investigated based on the standard kinetic models to clarify the formation mechanism. Before kinetic analysis, the calibration curve was determined with UV-VIS spectrophotometer. It was found that absorption of silver nanoparticle indicates linear dependency between 0.23 to 2.4 absorption unit (see Fig.4). After determining the linear range, the absorbance values that the point of calibration curve were converted to concentration (mgL\u22121) bymeans of atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements to estimate silver nanoparticle concentration in the silver nanoparticle dispersions. For this purpose, 1 mL of silver nanoparticle dispersions being in the defined absorption range dried in oven at vacuum conditions. Then, the dried residues were dissolved with 0.2 mL pure nitric acid and diluted to 10 mL with deionized water. Thus, silver nanoparticles were converted to Ag+ ions with applied treatment. Finally, concentrations of silver nanoparticles were calculated with the calibration curve that was obtained forAg+ with flame-AAS at 328.1 nm. TheCoefficient\ntration of 2.30 mM.

As a result, the absorption values of prepared samples given in Fig.1 could be quantified and the concentration of silver nanoparticles depending on the reaction time could be obtained. Silver nanoparticle concentrations were also estimated by gravimetric method and the results appear within standard deviations. Fig. 5 shows how silver nanoparticle concentration changes depending on the reaction time and initial silver (I) ion concentration, and thus silver nanoparticle formation rate in Inula Viscosa extract. In Fig. 5, the nucleation and growth steps were observed similar to [39, 49].\nFormation kinetics of silver nanoparticles were evaluated by fitting of experimental absorption spectra to first and second order kinetic models as explained follows. ln (A\u221e \u2212 A0)/(A\u221e \u2212 At) and 1/(A\u221e \u2212 At) values were plotted as afunction of time, respectively.

In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 7 (a-c) that the uniformity in the particle distribution increases with increasing the concentration. This situation was also observed in the UV/VIS spectra of silver nanoparticles where the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bands get narrow with increasing the temperature. The SPR band of silver nanoparticles in UV/VIS spectra obtained for 24 h reaction time became sharper and shifted from 470 nm to 450 nm with the concentration increase (see Fig. 2 a-c).

The reflections from (142), (241) and (220) planes could be detected as very weak peaks in diffraction pattern belonging the particles synthesize with 1.15mM initial concentration due to the background noise at lower concentrations (Fig. 8). Highly intense peak at 32.25\u25e6 indexed to (122) suggests that majority of silver nanoparticles were formed with the same orientation (Fig. 8). The other peaks with lower intensities can be attributed to the presence of bio-organic phases on the silver nanoparticle surfaces as explained before [53]. All XRD results clearly show that silver nanoparticles were able to be synthesized with FCC crystal structure in Inula Viscosa extract.\nthe concentration of 1.15 mM, 2.30 mM and 4.60 mM\nWe also performed Raman spectrometric measurements to find out possiblemolecular interactions and chemical structure of silver nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 9.

Inula Viscosa extract provides both reducing and stabilizing agents to obtain silver nanoparticles, and contains several organic compounds/components having hydroxyl, carbonyl, as well as amino groups. [54, 55]. The peak at 240 cm\u22121 can be attributed to Ag-O or Ag-N stretching mode confirming the presence of the mentioned groups on the surface of silver nanoparticles [56]. In addition, the weak vibrational modes at 955 and 1081 cm\u22121 can be related to C-C and C-N bonds, respectively [57]. Two sharp peaks at 1364 and 1590 cm\u22121 correspond to symmetric and anti-symmetric C=O stretching vibration of carboxylic acid groups, respectively. The peak intensity in Raman spectra are proportional to the concentration. Any shift in the peak positions was not observed and they remained almost unchanged in their spectral positions (see Fig.9). It is wellknown that Inula Viscosa have many phenolic compounds [40, 41] and it was reported that quercetin and kaempferol are these of the most abundants in the aqueous Inula Viscosa extracts. These flavonoids have carbonyl and hydroxyl groups having high reducing capacity, phenyl rings, heterocyclic ring containing the embedded oxygen atoms and\nE.Z. Okka, T. Tongur, T.T. Aytas, M.

The broad peak at 3288 cm\u22121 in FTIR spectrum shows O-H bond stretching of hydroxyl groups on quercetin and kaempferol molecules. The peak at 1392 cm\u22121 belongs to O-H bending vibrations of phenol. The peaks at 1178 cm\u22121 to 1047 cm\u22121 are also responsible for stretching vibrations of OH groups. The peaks observed at 2913 and 2848 cm\u22121 belongs to C-H stretching vibrations. The presence of aromatic rings confirms with the peaks at 1627 cm\u22121 and 1469 cm\u22121 assigned to C=C stretching vibrations. The peak at 1729 cm\u22121 comes from the C=O stretching vibration of carbonyl group. The peaks at 719 and 667 cm\u22121 correspond to the aromatic C-H bending vibrations. Previous studies show that the functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, aldehyde, carboxylic acid groups of flavonoids responsible for the reduction and stabilization of silver nanoparticles [59, 60]. The FTIR results on the synthesized silver nanoparticles show clear evidence for the presence of the these reducing and stabilizing groups on the nanoparticle surface compared with the FTIR spectrum of pure quercetin [61]. Additionally, the FTIR spectrum of aqueous Inula Viscosa extract in literature also proves similar streching and bending vibrations indicates the same functional groups [62]. On the light of the supposed mechanism for similar systems in literature, silver (I) ions in aqueous Inula Viscosa extract are first bound to hydroxyl groups of flavonoids, and then reduced to metallic silver (Ag0) resulting in silver nanoparticles [61]. After the reduction reaction, the molecules present in the medium stabilize silver nanoparticles most likely through the interaction of silver with bonds in their aromatic rings [63, 47, 64]. The synthesized silver nanoparticles in this study are easily dispersed in water and stay very stable long period of time which shows silver nanoparticles to bewell-stabilizedwith cappingmolecules through the strong intercations, supported by FTIRmeasurements."
