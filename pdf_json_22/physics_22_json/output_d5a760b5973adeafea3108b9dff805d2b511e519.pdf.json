    "abstractText": "We use N 1\u20444 2 and cascading gauge theory holographic models to extract the general features of the gravitational susceptibility \u03ba of strongly coupled nonconformal quark-gluon plasma. We show that in theories with a relevant coupling constant the gravitational susceptibility is renormalization scheme dependent. We propose to use its temperature derivative, i.e., d\u03ba d lnT, as a scheme-independent characteristic of a quark gluon plasma. Although \u03ba is a thermodynamic quantity, its critical behavior can be drastically distinct in the vicinity of seemingly identical thermal phase transitions.",

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\nModern relativistic hydrodynamics [1] is a widely accepted framework to analyze strongly coupled quarkgluon plasma (QGP) produced in high energy heavy-ion collisions [2\u20136]. It is an effective theory of the conservation law of the fluid stress-energy tensor1 T\u03bc\u03bd,\n\u2207\u03bcT\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc 0; T\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc X\u221e n\u00bc0 T\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0n\u00de; \u00f01:1\u00de\norganized as an expansion in the gradients of its fourvelocity u\u03bc, T\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0n\u00de \u223c\u2207nu. It is deemed to be applicable close to equilibrium and in weakly curved background spacetimes.2 Specifically,3 at zero order in the gradients, the stress-energy tensor is that of the thermal equilibrium of the theory in Minkowski space-time,\nT\u03bc\u03bd\u00f00\u00de \u00bc \u00f0\u03f5\u00fe P\u00deu\u03bcu\u03bd \u00fe Pg\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u03f5u\u03bcu\u03bd \u00fe P\u0394\u03bc\u03bd; \u0394\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd \u00fe u\u03bcu\u03bd; g\u03bc\u03bdu\u03bcu\u03bd \u00bc \u22121; \u00f01:2\u00de\nwhere the pressure P is related to the energy density \u03f5 via the equilibrium equation of state P \u00bc Peq\u00f0\u03f5\u00de, and g\u03bc\u03bd is\nthe background space-time metric tensor. Additionally, the local temperature T and the entropy density s are introduced as\n\u03f5\u00fe P \u00bc sT; d\u03f5 \u00bc Tds: \u00f01:3\u00de\nAt the first-order in the velocity gradients constitutive relations between the stress-energy tensor T\u03bc\u03bd\u00f01\u00de and the four-velocity require two-independent transport coefficients\u2014the shear \u03b7, and the bulk \u03b6 viscosities:\nT\u03bc\u03bd\u00f01\u00de \u00bc \u2212\u03b7\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b6\u0394\u03bc\u03bd\u2207\u03b1u\u03b1; \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u0394\u03bc\u03b1\u0394\u03bd\u03b2 \u2207\u03b1u\u03b2 \u00fe\u2207\u03b2u\u03b1 \u2212 2\n3 \u0394\u03b1\u03b2\u2207\u03b3u\u03b3 : \u00f01:4\u00de\nThe sensitivity of the fluid to the space-time background curvature arises at the second-order in the velocity gradients. At the second-order in the gradient expansion, there are 5 second-order transport coefficients, if the fluid is conformal [9], and 15 coefficients for a general nonconformal theory [10].

Being a thermodynamic coefficient, it can, in principle, be computed from the corresponding gauge theory lattice implementation [16]. Instead, we use the holographic correspondence [17,18] and extract \u03ba from the retarded correlation function of the gauge theory stress-energy tensor [9]. We focus on two examples of holographic models:\n(i) the mass-deformed N \u00bc 4 supersymmetric SU\u00f0N\u00de Yang-Mills theory also know as N \u00bc 2 gauge theory [19,20];\n(ii) the N \u00bc 1 supersymmetric SU\u00f0N \u00feM\u00de \u00d7 SU\u00f0N\u00de cascading gauge theory [21]. Both theories are nonconformal\u2014in the former, the scale invariance is broken explicitly by the mass terms for the bosonic and the fermionic components of the N \u00bc 2\nhypermultiplet; in the latter, the scale invariance is broken spontaneously through the dimensional transmutation of the gauge couplings. Our holographic models are examples of top-down,5 rather than phenomenological, holography. Before we report our result, we review what is known in the literature. (i) The gravitational susceptibility of N \u00bc 4 SU\u00f0N\u00de\nSYM in the planar limit and at infinitely large \u2019t Hooft coupling constant was computed in [9]\n\u03ba N\u00bc4\n\u00bc T 2N2\n8 \u21d2 4\u03c02\u03baT s\nN\u00bc4\n\u00bc 1;\n2\u03c02T2 s d\u03ba dT\nN\u00bc4\n\u00bc 1; \u00f01:11\u00de\nwhere we also presented two benchmark quantities that would allow for comparison with other models.

However, the validity of the results presented there should be verified with the implementation of the holographic renormalization \u2014at least for the class of models we consider here the proper treatment of the holographic renormalization, including the finite counterterms and the corresponding issue of the scheme dependence, is crucial to obtain correct results.\nWe now summarize our results: (i) It is well known that in a quantum field theory (QFT)\nthe expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is renormalization scheme dependent. From the holographic perspective, renormalization of the boundary\n4See also [14,15].\n5While some observables, e.g., the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density, are universal in all holographic models in the supergravity approximation [22], certain exotic phase transitions are ubiquitous in phenomenological holography, but not in string theory [23,24].\n126024-2\ncorrelation functions is sensitive to finite counterterms\u2014one can crudely think that the energy density and the pressure of T\u03bc\u03bd\u00f00\u00de \u00bc diagf\u03f5; P; P; Pg in (1.2) are defined up to additive constants. If the theory, as well as its regularization and the renormalization, preserves supersymmetry, some of the finite counterterms can be fixed requiring the vanishing of the stress-energy tensor expectation value in a supersymmetric vacuum state, i.e., as T \u2192 0, see [30] for example. For a QFT in curved space-time and/or with time-dependent relevant couplings, there are even more possibilities for finite counterterms and thus the renormalization scheme dependence.6 These new counterterms cannot be fixed requiring Minkowski space-time supersymmetry. As we explicitly show in Sec. II, holographic models with relevant couplings for dimension \u0394 \u00bc f2; 3g operators\u2014e.g., the mass terms fm2b; mfg for the bosons and fermions\u2014 introduce the scheme dependence for \u03ba. Specifically, the gravitational susceptibility in such models is defined up to arbitrary constants f\u03b4f; \u03b4bg:\n\u03ba \u2192 \u03ba \u00fe \u03b4fm2f \u00fe\u00fe\u03b4bm2b: \u00f01:14\u00de\nThe corresponding finite counterterms involve the boundary curvature tensor, and thus are insensitive to Minkowski supersymmetry. From (1.14) it is clear that the renormalization scheme independent quantity is d\u03bad ln\u00f0T\u00de; to this end we propose to characterize the gravitational susceptibility of QGPs with R\u03ba,\nR\u03ba \u2261 2\u03c02 Ts d\u03ba d lnT \u00bc 4\u03c02 T s \u00f0\u03ba \u2212 \u03ba \u00de; \u00f01:15\u00de\nwhere the normalization is chosen with (1.11) in mind.

The results reported are for the\ncascading QGP with the unbroken chiral symmetry\u2014this phase becomes perturbatively unstable to chiral symmetry breaking fluctuations below T\u03c7SB [32].

The deconfined phase of the cascading gauge theory with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is unstable to energy density fluctuations (the sound waves) [34], thus we do not report the susceptibility in this phase as well.\n(iii) N \u00bc 2 gauge theory with mb \u2260 0 and mf \u00bc 0 completely breaks the supersymmetry.

Interestingly, we find that despite identical critical thermodynamics ofN \u00bc 2 and the cascading QGP, the gravitational susceptibility of the cascading gauge theory plasma at criticality is very different (see Sec.

We explain why \u03ba, but not \u03c4\u03c0, is renormalization scheme dependent in theories with \u0394 \u00bc f2; 3g relevant couplings. We discuss \u03ba and \u03c4\u03c0 of the cascading gauge theory and N \u00bc 2 QGPs in Secs. III and IV correspondingly.\nII. HOLOGRAPHIC COMPUTATION OF \u03ba\nGiven the second-order formulation of the relativistic hydrodynamics reviewed in section I, the \u00f0xy; xy\u00decomponent of the retarded stress-energy tensor Green\u2019s function in the limit of the small frequency \u03c9 and the small momentum q \u00bc jq\u20d7j takes the form [10]\n126024-4\nGxy;xyR \u00f0\u03c9; q\u00de \u00bc P \u2212 i\u03b7\u03c9\u00fe \u00f0\u03b7\u03c4\u03c0 \u2212 \u03ba\n2 \u00fe \u03ba \u00de|fflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl}\n\u2261T2\u0393\u0302\u03c9\n\u03c92 \u00fe \u00f0\u2212 \u03ba 2 \u00de|ffl{zffl}\n\u2261T2\u0393\u0302q\nq2 \u00feO\u00f0\u03c9q2;\u03c93\u00de; \u00f02:1\u00de\nwhere we introduced dimensionless quantities \u0393\u0302\u03c9 and \u0393\u0302q.

The computation of the Green\u2019s function (2.1) in holography was explained in [38]: (i) Consider the five-dimensional bulk gravitational\naction Sbulk, dual to some boundary QFT. The thermal equilibrium state of the boundary gauge theory is dual to a black brane geometry,\nds25 \u00bc \u2212c21dt2 \u00fe c22x2 \u00fe c23d\u03c12; \u00f02:3\u00de\nwhere ci \u00bc ci\u00f0\u03c1\u00de are functions of the radial coordinate \u03c1. We assume that \u03c1 \u2192 0 is the asymptotic boundary, while \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1H is a regular Schwarzschild horizon,\nlim \u03c1\u21920 c1 c2 \u00bc 1; lim \u03c1\u2192\u03c1H c1 \u00bc 0: \u00f02:4\u00de\n(ii) The retarded correlation function Gxy;xyR can be extracted from the quadratic boundary effective\naction for the metric fluctuations \u03c6\u00f0t; z; \u03c1\u00de\u2261 1 2 c\u221222 \u03b4gxy\u00f0t; z; \u03c1\u00de, \u03c6b\u00f0\u03c9; q\u00de \u00bc Z\nd\u03c9dq ei\u03c9t\u2212iqz\u03c6\u00f0t; z; \u03c1\u00dej\u03c1\u21920; \u00f02:5\u00de\ngiven by\nSboundary\u00bd\u03c6b \u00bc Z\nd\u03c9dq \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03c6 b\u00f0\u2212\u03c9;\u2212q\u00deF \u00f0\u03c9;q\u00de\u03c6b\u00f0\u03c9;q\u00de;\n\u00f02:6\u00de as\nGxy;xyR \u00f0\u03c9; q\u00de \u00bc \u22122F \u00f0\u03c9; q\u00de: \u00f02:7\u00de\n(iii) The boundary metric functional in (2.6) is defined as\nSboundary\u00bd\u03c6b \u00bc lim \u03c1\u21920 \u00f0S\u03c1bulk\u00bd\u03c6 \u00fe SGH\u00bd\u03c6 \u00fe Scounter\u00bd\u03c6 \u00de;\n\u00f02:8\u00de\nwhere S\u03c1bulk is the regularized bulk gravitational action, evaluated on-shell for the bulk metric fluctuation \u03c6, subject to the following boundary conditions:\n\u00f0a\u00de\u2236 lim \u03c1\u21920 \u03c6\u00f0t; z; \u03c1\u00de \u00bc \u03c6b\u00f0t; z\u00de;\n\u00f0b\u00de\u2236 \u03c6\u00f0t; z; \u03c1\u00de is an incoming wave at the horizon; i:e:; as \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1H: \u00f02:9\u00de\nAlso, SGH is the standard Gibbons-Hawking term over the regularized boundary. The purpose of the boundary counterterm Scounter is to remove divergences of the regularized boundary action S\u03c1bulk \u00fe SGH as \u03c1 \u2192 0, rendering the renormalized boundary action (2.8) finite. To evaluate \u0393\u0302\u03c9 and \u0393\u0302q we need the boundary functional (2.8) to quadratic order inO\u00f0\u03c92; q2\u00de\u2014thus we need the on-shell solution for \u03c6 to this order as well. It was shown in [39] that the equation for \u03c6 is simply that of the minimally coupled massless scalar in the background metric (2.3). Furthermore, the solution can be expanded as [39]\n\u03d5\u00f0t; z; \u03c1\u00de \u00bc e\u2212i\u03c9t\u00feiqz\u03d5b\u00f0\u03c9; q\u00de|fflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflffl} \u00f0a\u00de c1 c2\n\u2212i\u03c9Q\n|fflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflffl} \u00f0b\u00de\n\u00f01\u00fe \u03c92z2\u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00fe q2z3\u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00feO\u00f0\u03c9q2;\u03c93\u00de\u00de; \u00f02:10\u00de\nwhere\nQ\u2261 1 2\u03c0T : \u00f02:11\u00de\nwith T begin the Hawking temperature of the black brane (2.3). In (2.10) we highlighted components of the solution that take care of the boundary conditions (2.9).

The on-shell regularized bulk action S\u03c1bulk\u00bd\u03c6 is a total derivative,7 however, we need to discard the contribution from the horizon [38]. The subtle piece in the boundary functional (2.8) comes from Scounter\u00bd\u03c6 . This boundary counterterm action includes finite counterterms, that can lead to renormalization ambiguities in \u0393\u0302\u03c9 and \u0393\u0302q. Suppose that our holographic model has operators of conformal dimension \u0394 \u00bc f2; 3g, the dual bulk gravitational scalars are correspondingly f\u03b1; \u03c7g, with coupling constants \u03bb2 and \u03bb3.

It is clear that evaluating the logarithmic derivative d\u03bad lnT completely removes this scheme dependence. Furthermore, the \u00f0q2 \u2212 \u03c92\u00de structure of the renormalization ambiguity in (2.16) implies that the sum T2\u00f0\u0393\u0302\u03c9 \u00fe \u0393\u0302q\u00de from (2.1) is always renormalization scheme independent. As a result, see (2.2), the shear relaxation time \u03c4\u03c0 is renormalization scheme unambiguous as well. 10\nIII. CASCADING QGP\nFor a recent review of the cascading gauge theory see [41]. In this section we will follow notations of the above reference. We omit the technical details and highlight the results only. The effective five-dimensional gravitational action used to describe the chirally symmetric11 cascading gauge theory plasma contains the Einstein-Hilbert term, and four scalars dual to operators of conformal dimensions\u0394 \u00bc f4; 4; 6; 8g. There are no relevant operators, and thus, while the holographic renormalization of the theory is not unique [42], the gravitational susceptibility \u03ba of the theory is renormalization scheme independent. The black brane dual to the chirally symmetric phase of the cascading QGP is characterized by 13 parameters (see Eqs.

From the plots it is clear the that the near-critical susceptibility of the cascading QGP is given by (1.23); given (2.1), the latter implies (1.34).\nIV. N = 2 QGP\nIn this section we follow notations of [35]. We omit the technical details and highlight the results only. The effective five-dimensional gravitational action used to describe N \u00bc 2 gauge theory plasma contains the Einstein-Hilbert term, and two scalars dual to operators of conformal dimensions \u0394 \u00bc f2; 3g. Following the general discussion in Sec. II, we expect two-parameter family of the renormalization scheme dependence of its gravitational susceptibility.\n13This parameter is useful in comparing different holographic models among themselves, and with the lattice QCD data (when available). Its use was originally advocated for in [43].\n14The thermal state of the cascading QGP is constructed perturbatively in the limit ln T\u039b \u226b 1, see Appendix D of [41], followed by the corresponding perturbative solution of (2.12).\n126024-7\nThe black brane dual toN \u00bc 2 QGP is characterized by 8 parameters (see Eqs.

An interesting feature of the N \u00bc 2 QGP with m2b \u00bc m2f is that the limit T mb\n\u2192 0 is given by the conformal thermodynamics of a certain five-dimensional theory, compactified on S1 [45]. The local properties of plasma, such as the transport coefficients, are unaffected by the compactification. The precise matching of the N \u00bc 2 thermodynamics in the Tmb \u2192 0 limit with that of the CFT5 thermodynamics was explained in [46]; it can be easily extended to the matching of the Green\u2019s functions, with the (perhaps the obvious) result:\nlim T=mb\u21920\nR\u03bajN\u00bc2 ;mb\u00bcmf \u00bc R\u03bajCFT5 ;\nlim T=mb\u21920\nR\u03c4\u03c0 jN\u00bc2 ;mb\u00bcmf \u00bc R\u03c4\u03c0 jCFT5 ; \u00f04:7\u00de\nwhere in view of the renormalization scheme dependence of the gravitational susceptibility of the N \u00bc 2 QGP we use (1.15). The relaxation time \u03c4\u03c0 of the CFT5 plasma was computed in [47]\n\u03c4\u03c0TjCFT5 \u00bc 5\n8\u03c0\n2 \u2212\n\u03c0\n5\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 \u2212\n2ffiffiffi 5\np s\n\u00fe 1ffiffiffi 5\np coth\u22121 ffiffiffi 5 p \u2212 1\n2 ln 5\n\u21d2 R\u03c4\u03c0 jCFT5 \u00bc 1.15\u00f04\u00de: \u00f04:8\u00de\nWe reproduce (4.8), and additionally find\nR\u03c4\u03c0 jCFT5 \u00bc 5 4 : \u00f04:9\u00de\nIn Fig. 4 we collect the gravitational susceptibility parameter R\u03ba, see (1.15), for all the models we study: the N \u00bc 2 plasma with m2b \u00bc m2f (the gray curve), the\n126024-9\nN \u00bc 2 plasma withmb \u2260 0 andmf \u00bc 0 (the green curve), and the cascading QGP (the black curve). The black dot indicates the N \u00bc 4 SYM result (1.11), and the magenta dot indicates the CFT5 result (4.9). The red line is the nearconformal approximation to R\u03ba for the cascading gauge theory plasma. The vertical dashed blue line identifies the critical behavior with the vanishing speed of the sound waves, i.e., T \u2192 Tcrit (1.19) for N \u00bc 2 plasma with mf \u00bc 0, and T \u2192 Tu (1.21) for the cascading gauge theory plasma. In Fig. 5 we highlight the critical behavior of R\u03ba in the N \u00bc 2 QGP with mf \u00bc 0. Since in the critical region, see the right panel,\nT \u2212 Tcrit \u221d \u00f0c2s\u00de2; \u00f04:10\u00de\nand, see the left panel,\nR\u03ba \u221d \u2212 1\nc2s ; \u00f04:11\u00de\nwe extract the divergent critical behavior ofR\u03ba as in (1.20). In Fig. 6 we collect the shear relaxation time parameter R\u03c4\u03c0 , see (1.27), for all the models we study (the left panel): the N \u00bc 2 plasma with m2b \u00bc m2f (the gray curve), the N \u00bc 2 plasma withmb \u2260 0 andmf \u00bc 0 (the green curve), and the cascading QGP (the black curve). The black dot\n126024-10\nindicates the N \u00bc 4 SYM result (1.25), and the magenta dot indicates the CFT5 result (4.8). The red line is the nearconformal approximation to R\u03c4\u03c0 for the cascading gauge theory plasma. Notice that the shear relaxation time of the N \u00bc 2 plasma with mf \u00bc 0 becomes negative for T < 1.003\u00f00\u00deTcrit, represented by the vertical dashed pink line. In the right panel we show the critical behavior of the shear relaxation time of the N \u00bc 2 QGP with mf \u00bc 0 as T \u2192 Tcrit, R\u03c4\u03c0 \u221d \u2212 1 c2s , leading to (1.30).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI would like to thank Francesco Bigazzi for pointing out [44].
