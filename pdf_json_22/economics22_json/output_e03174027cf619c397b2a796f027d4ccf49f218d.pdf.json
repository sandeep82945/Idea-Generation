            "text": "The world\u2019s third biggest economy seems to have emerged from the pandemic comparatively unscathed. Priyanka Borpujari speaks to health workers who survived the frontlines about how, and at what cost\nPriyanka Borpujari freelance journalist\nOn 20 February 2020, the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 36 km south of the Japanese capital Tokyo, and turned into the world\u2019s largest cluster of people infected with a new disease: covid-19.1\nHospitals in Yokohama had trouble admitting all the passengers, especially since many of them were in severely ill, needing mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nThe biggest challenge, says Norio Ohmagari, who leads research at the National Centre for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo, was the low number of available beds. \u201cIt was quite obvious that we could not accommodate all covidpatients,\u201dOhmagari says. \u201cThe Tokyo governor requested private hospitals to accommodate them [70% of hospitals in Japan are privately run], but they were scared of this novel disease, with not much information, no vaccine, paucity of PPE [personal protective equipment], and no treatment.\u201d\n\u201cA national health crisis sadly cannot be separated from politicisation,\u201d says Kenji Shibuya, director of a covid vaccination medical centre in Soma city in Fukushimaprefecture and researchdirector at Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research. \u201cFor the countries that did well in managing the pandemic, the primary factor was their trust in the government. Unfortunately, that trust in the government and experts from the medical community was eroded in Japan.\u201d\nJapan recorded its first case of covid-19 in January 2020. Two years later, the world\u2019s third biggest economy and 11th most populous has recorded five million cases and 23 633 deaths\u2014far lower thanmany other high income countries. But the exact reasons for the island country\u2019s low numbers (box 1), and the effectivenessof thegovernment\u2019spandemic response, are still debated.\nBox 1: Why did Japan\u2019s covid-19 numbers remain relatively low?\nAmong the reasons cited are a public willingness to adhere to measures, as well as Japan\u2019s early adoption of the \u201c3Cs\u201d (avoiding close contact, closed spaces, and close conversations)\u2014built on the country\u2019s traditional approach to infectious disease control\u2014that anticipated what scientists now understand of the airborne nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In addition, facemasks were prevalent even before the pandemic, and most experts think a culture of politeness while travelling on public transport\u2014such as distancing\nand a hesitancy to talk aloud on the phone\u2014helped limit virus transmission, even as the country\u2019s vast train and subway systems continued to be crowded during the peak hours. Japan\u2019s low obesity rate has also been posited as a factor.2\nWinter 2020 The Japanese government declared its first \u201cstate of emergency\u201d on 7 April 2020,3 which lasted in some form throughout the rest of the year. It was one of the first countries to close schools nationally (in February 2020) and it also closed borders to foreign visitors and limited entry for Japanese residents fromabroad.\nThough there was criticism of the government\u2019s confusing messaging,4 Japan got through 2020 with just 239 000 officially confirmed cases and around 3500 deaths as the public largely complied with requests to work from home and refrain from travel and going out.\nBut December 2020 saw rising case numbers as new variants emerged. For the first time, Tokyo logged 10 000 cases in a month.5 Ohmagari remembers that ambulanceswere not able to secure hospital beds for their patients. At the time, rules stated that anyone who tested positive had to be admitted to hospital. Even though a considerable number of beds were allotted for covid-19 patients at the National Centre for Global Health and Medicine, it was not enough. Subsequently, the Tokyo metropolitan government ordered public hospitals to secure non-intensive care unit beds to accommodate covid-19 patients with moderate infection.\nOhmagari says that what happened was beyond anyone\u2019s expectation. \u201c[Theauthorities] didnot know that to accommodate moderate to severe patients, thewholehealthcare systemhad toundergoa change [in the rules] and adjust to new restrictions. We had tomodify thepatient care flow for non-covidpatients, and that was quite complicated.\u201d\nOhmagari also points to the many infected people who could not be admitted and whose health was deteriorating at home. \u201cWe should have had an observation system for them: an efficient system that would ensure that they would find a bed if their health worsens. But our existing system was overwhelmed,\u201dhe says. Eventually, in February 2021, the law was changed to ensure that private hospitals could be given directives to accommodate covid patients.6\n1the bmj | BMJ 2022;376:o778 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.o778\nFEATURE\nTokyo, Japan and Dublin, Republic of Ireland\npriyanka.borpujari@gmail.com\nCite this as: BMJ 2022;376:o778\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o778\nPublished: 31 March 2022\ncopyright. on 25 January 2024 at Indian Institute of T\nechnology P atna (IIT P atna).

            "text": "Japan began rolling out covid-19 vaccinations in February 2021, with health workers first in line.7 With the delayed Olympic Games now approaching, the then prime minister, Yoshihide Suga\u2014the second of what would be three prime ministers in two years\u2014stepped up efforts to massively expand vaccine coverage.8\nIn early May 2021, about 3% of the Japanese population was fully vaccinated,with 250000doses administereddaily. But by 25 June\u2014a month before the summer Olympics opened\u2014the country was administering a million doses a day.9 Two-dose vaccination now stands at 80% of the population.10\nIt was not an easy process for the public to get vaccinated, however. Because responsibility for vaccinating fell to each municipal government, the vaccination schedule was erratic across the country. Residentswere required to secure a vaccination inoculation ticket number online, and thenwait for a voucher andanother form to arrive by post.\nBut the website for access was complicated, phone lines were busy, and vaccination sites ran out of vaccines. Universities and corporations tried to fill the gap. Working with patients in all age groups at three clinics across Tokyo\u2014as well as foreign residents in Japan\u2014Eiji Kusumi says that the multiple hurdles of online reservation, language barrier (the website was in Japanese only), and the lack of IT skills among all populations \u201cworked well for the government,\u201d in the sense that there were only a small number of vaccines available at the time. \u201cLater, it made citizens feel that they are ignoredby the government, especially the younger people, since they were not able to get vaccinated anytime soon,\u201d says Kusumi."

Once again, there were not enough beds in Tokyo\u2019s hospitals.11 \u201cPublic hospitals were not accepting covid patients. Funds were given to theNationalHealthOrganisationand the JapanCommunity Healthcare Organisation, but they were not accepting covid-19 patients,\u201d says Kusumi.\nHis disappointment with the two medical bodies can be best understood in the way in which GPs like him were able to test patients but unable to admit them. \u201cOne of my patients, who was in his 50s, died in his home, while we were trying to secure a hospital bed for him with the local health office of Shinjuku,\u201d says Kusumi, adding that since only younger peoplewere seeking online consultations, there is a high possibility that many older people died in their homes without having seen any doctor.\nDuring the early days of the delta variant, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike blamed the city\u2019s adult entertainment industry for the rapid transmission.12 \u201cThis pushed people working late at night in these businesses to avoid vaccination, as a show of resistance, for being blamed as the enemy of the public,\u201d says Kusumi.\nWith the Olympics in full swing\u2014albeit with no spectators13\u2014Masataka Inokuchi, a vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association, declared the capital\u2019s circumstances as \u201ca disaster level emergency situation that is out of control,\u201d worrying about the medical system and paramedic response.14 Even as Tokyo\u2019s metropolitan government tried to increase hospital capacity and prepare rooms in empty hotels as temporary facilities for patients who needed to isolate, the situation worsened with a paucity of medical staff.15\nTakuro Endo, who was among the first doctors to treat covid-19 patients while working at Yokohama\u2019s St Marianna Hospital, says\nthat at first, the severely ill patients were predominantly older people. Japan has the largest proportion (29%) of over 65 year olds in the world. Then came the delta variant, and by September 2021, Japan\u2019s extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cases were the highest globally.16"

Throughout 2020, she did not meet her family, let alone friends. \u201cI watched anime at home. I did not go out to play basketball. Among my colleagues, none of us wanted to be the first one to be infected,\u201d she said.\nHer hospital had 18 intensive care unit beds, of which only four were reserved for covid-19 patients. \u201cThere was just one nurse to care for two covid patients. That meant that each time we had to look at the other patient, we had to change our PPE. This was toughest during the night shifts, which are 16 hours at a stretch, and we had to change the PPE every four hours,\u201d Suzuki said. According to thehealthministry, Japanneeded around8000nurses capable of treating covid-19 patients, but only about 3000 are qualified.17\nKusumi says he often dreamt of patients not finding beds. \u201cThe biggest stress was the powerlessness. Fortunately, none of my staff quit, because I was always telling them that we were doing the right thing: testing patients, providing online consultations, and doing the best we could.\u201d\n\u201cPositive PCR [polymerase chain reaction] tests exceeded 60% at my clinics\u2014that was 12 times more covid patients than the government data. But since only severely ill people were being sent to the hospital, such data were not recorded,\u201d says Kusumi, adding that the 30 doctors across his three clinics were mostly consulting patients online and could only prescribe medication to control the symptoms.\nShibuya says, \u201cEven before the pandemic hit, we needed a radical reform, to restrict the working hours of doctors as well as to consolidate real time information of available beds across hospitals. After two years, neither has progressed, and a huge number of doctors and nurses have suffered burnout.\u201d\nStudyinghealthcare systems across theworld, Endo identifies three weaknesses in Japan\u2019s healthcare system that affected its response to the pandemic: an inefficient emergency ambulance service; the absence of a centralised health system and the inability of the government to issue directives to private hospitals; and finally, a non-digitised health system and no inter-hospital communication, which prevents real time sharing of patient information.\nShibuya also blames the strict adherence to Japan\u2019s 120 year old infectious diseases law, which he says was \u201cwritten keeping quarantine in mind.\u201d For instance, mass testing was restricted because of the law\u2019s cluster control approach, which aimed to minimise the size of outbreaks. Suzuki told The BMJ she was first asked to take a covid-19 test in February 2021\u2014after a whole year of treating covid patients\u2014only when one of her colleagues developed a fever. Until then only temperature was checked regularly.\nEndo thinks that, in the beginning, the government avoided mass testing because of lack of capacity, while assuming that the healthcare system could manage all levels of cases. \u201cLater, that decision turned out to be not perfect. But it could not be criticised [at the time]. The strategy was based on what outcomes they were\nthe bmj | BMJ 2022;376:o778 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.o7782\non 25 January 2024 at Indian Institute of T echnology P atna (IIT P atna).

A complete disconnect between what the public health experts were saying and the medical practitioners.\u201d The former health minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki chaired a working group by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party\u2014which Shibuya was part of in an unofficial capacity\u2014that submitted a series of revisions for discussion in parliament, though Shibuya says none have been implemented so far.\nAs a member of the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine, Takashi Yamada (name changed), a doctor in Otaru, the third largest city in Japan\u2019s northernmost prefecture Hokkaido, says that the government had consulted doctors about the way forward with the pandemic, but their advice for a lockdown was rejected \u201cin favour of keeping the economy alive.\u201d Ohmagari says it was frustrating: \u201cI was invited by the government to give advice, but nobody takes the advice.\u201d\nEarly 2022 has seen another wave of cases fuelled by the omicron variant. But deaths remain low compared with previous waves, despite hospital occupancy rates in Tokyo in February reaching the 50% benchmark for declaring another state of emergency.18 At the time of writing, cases are subsiding, and the limited restrictions remaining were lifted on 21 March.\nPublic opinion polls hint at ongoing caution among the Japanese, however, many of whom would prefer some form of restrictions to remain.19 Shibuya says that a lot of Japan\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d can be put down to the public\u2019s compliance (box 1), but that cannot be sustainable for this pandemic or the next.
