The Teflon-line stainless steel autoclave (100 mL) was used to load the above solution and then placed in an oven at 160 \u2103 for 12 h.

Then the above mixture was transferred into a plastic syringe with a stainless needle connected to the channel of the electrospinning. The flow rate is 0.8 mL h-1, and the distance between the collector and the needle was ~15 cm by using 15 kV in the needle. After electrospinning procedure, the as-spun nanofibers were peroxided in air at 280 \u2103 for 2 h and carbonized under N2 at 800 \u2103 for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 \u2103 min-1. Subsequently, the carbonized fibers were oxidated in air at 350 \u2103 for 1.5 h. MnOx-CNFs was thus obtained. MnOx and amorphous carbon composite (MnOx-aC) were prepared by heat treatment Mn-BTC at the same condition for comparison. 3. Materials characterization The morphology and microstructure of the samples were checked by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS G500) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TALOS 200X). The crystal structure of prepared products was identified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Ka radiation. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ULTRA DLD) was used for\nS-4\ndetecting the chemical composition and electronic structure of materials. The pore diameter distribution and specific surface area of the materials were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET, ASAP2050). The X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) was performed at the beamline 02B02 and 11B of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), beamline 11U of National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL), and beamline 20A of Taiwan Light Source (TLS). For ex-situ characterizations (mainly XPS, XRD and XAS), the samples were handled using the standard procedures, including disassembled, rinsing and transfer. The electrodes at different states of charge were disassembled and washed by deionized water and anhydrous ethanol for further testing. The quantitative analysis of Mn L-edge XAS spectra was conducted by a linear combination of the distinct line shape of Mn2+/3+/4+ reference spectra using Anaconda software based on Python. The relative concentration of Mn in different valence states can be determined by means of minimizing the residual between the experimental results and the linear combination fitted results. 4. Electrochemical measurements The as-prepared MnOx-CNFs and MnOx-aC were mixed with acetylene black and PVDF in a ratio of 7:2:1 with NMP to obtain a slurry, and then coating the slurry on\nS-5\nstainless steel foil. The average loading mass of active material was ~ 1-1.5 mg cm-2. The CR2032 coin cells were assembled with as-prepared cathodes, zinc foil as anode, aqueous 2 M ZnSO4 and 0.2 M MnSO4 as electrolyte and nonwoven filter paper as the separator. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on LAND workstation at various scan rates from 0.4 to 2 mV s-1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in a frequency ranging from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz. The galvanostatic discharge/charge test and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) were performed in the voltage range of 0.9-1.85 V on a LAND battery testing system."
