1. **Investigate the effect of different milk processing conditions on the chemical composition and microstructure of milk using Raman spectroscopy.** This could help to optimize processing conditions to improve the quality and nutritional value of milk products.


2. **Develop a portable Raman spectroscopy system for rapid and non-destructive analysis of milk quality and composition.** This could be used for on-site testing of milk at farms, processing plants, and retail stores.


3. **Explore the use of Raman spectroscopy for the detection of adulteration and contamination in milk.** This could help to ensure the safety and quality of milk products.


4. **Investigate the relationship between the chemical composition and microstructure of milk and its sensory properties.** This could help to develop new milk products with improved flavor, texture, and appearance.


5. **Use Raman spectroscopy to study the interactions between milk components and bioactive compounds, such as probiotics and prebiotics.** This could help to develop new functional foods with improved health benefits.
