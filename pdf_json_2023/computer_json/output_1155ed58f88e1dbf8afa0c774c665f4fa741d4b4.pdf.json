            "text": "The National Ideological and Political Work Conference reiterated the significance of maintaining the utilization of three highly effective instructional tools, namely online classrooms, to augment the functioning of modern\nideological and political theory courses. This approach aims to enhance the inherent level of affinity and practical applicability of educational practices within ideological and political courses offered at institutions of higher education. Additionally, it seeks to cater to the requirements of students with specific needs. While consciously maintaining our initiative and sense of responsibility for good communication and work channels\nwith other educational courses in higher education, should combine the practice of studying ideological and political theory courses with the activities of various training courses [1]. Including the study of cultural ideas and the practice of reform of the Chinese political and economic system in this course may significantly enhance the development of the students' national confidence in traditional cultural knowledge. However, it will also be very effective in strengthening the development of these students' cultural and national pride, thus strengthening their cultural identity as it should be in a socialist country. Implementing reforms in the ideological and political education of colleges and universities will help students develop a scientifically correct and upwardly mobile outlook on life, values, and core morals from a young age. However, it will also help schools cultivate socialist values and contribute to students' positive and healthy growth. In recent years, ongoing efforts and advancement have been made in managing and designing curricula, and numerous studies and feasibility analyses have been carried out to set the stage and conditions for educational and teaching reforms. The user is inquiring about assistance in understanding a specific subject and effectively applying its fundamental components within the ideological and political dimensions of the curriculum. Furthermore, they express a desire to explore the efficient implementation of this notion in the realms of talent development and ideological and political education. It is crucial for experts involved in ideological education to thoroughly analyze and succinctly convey these factors. In addition to advocating for the revitalization and improvement of the traditional pedagogical approach, the implementation of ideological and political education reform holds the potential to greatly boost the effectiveness, scope, and impact of teaching practices, as well as the cultivation of exceptional individuals. In order to ensure the success and comprehensiveness of educational reform's ideological and political work curriculum, it is imperative to engage in rigorous research, ascertain the underlying causes and contributing aspects of the challenges at hand, and provide evidencebased remedies. Given this, it is essential to keep political and ideological work at the forefront of moral education throughout the entirety of the educational process for everyone. At the same time, their moral character can be ultimately improved. Human formation is a protracted, complicated process that combines duty, honor, and a thorough and effective process of changing one's attitude [2]. Therefore, in the context of the new era of Civic and Political Education, Reform Empowerment, and Cooperation Strengthening, this paper has the following implications for ideological and political education reform using fuzzy theory and algorithms: Second, and more importantly, for their future development, students can fully comprehend the country's political and ideological appeal, particularly its approach to development. First, ideological and political courses can aid students in creating a clear sense of purpose and advance the growth\nand way of life in the socialist nation. The primary objective of this educational reform program is to cultivate and shape students' values through the incorporation of \"genetic\" education and moral education into the curriculum. This integration is primarily achieved through classroom instruction, which serves as the main platform for promoting \"ideological and political sentiments\" and emphasizing educational values. There is a pressing need for political and ideological education reform. The importance of education in the modern world, as well as its advancement and reform, should be emphasized in future ideological and political courses. Ideological and political teachers should fully utilize ideological and political work components, focusing on the overall state of ideological and political work reform, developing high-quality personnel, and maintaining the correct values, mainly when teaching ideological and political subjects. Due to the Internet's rapid development, students are exposed to frequently updated and repeated information. Because of their generally limited intellectual capacity, they may be attacked by perverted ideas and refuse to learn the country's traditional culture [3]."

            "text": "The state is giving civics and political science education and learning more and more attention as the reform of the educational system progresses and develops. In order to encourage the individualization of talents and to guide their growth with the appropriate attitude and instruction, ideological and political curriculum reform was introduced and put into place [4]. Political and ideological education has drawn much attention recently. Curriculum reform serves as the fundamental pillar of ideological and political education, acting as the driving force behind the advancement of intellectual and political endeavors. Moreover, this process might be characterized as a silent educational and artistic endeavor that necessitates the completion of a \"triple comprehensive\" education. The implementation of research on political and ideological theory education should align with a novel educational framework in response to the ongoing reform of China's educational system. The interrelationship between various disciplinary teaching duties and human education holds significant importance within the ideological and political science curriculum. Despite the inclusion of comprehensive ideological and political moral education systems in the university's curriculum for ideological and political moral education and the higher education personnel training project, there is still a requirement for additional enhancements in the ideological and political science curriculum provided by our esteemed faculty. Effectively connecting political education and philosophy training with the demands of the current era is a critical part of advancing ideological and political education and nurturing the formation of political talent in contemporary China. Additionally, it is imperative to firmly guarantee\nthat educators in the present time possess exceptional knowledge acquisition, political acumen, values cultivation, and core moral values. It is imperative to recognize the educational and pedagogical significance of integrating ideological and political curricular material with topic instruction. By consistently researching the content of many subjects, may promote educational progress, boost the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and scientific inquiry. The introduction of ideology and politics in China occurred in 2017. This concept gained widespread acceptance and respect in universities as soon as it was presented. The realization of educational functions and the reform of ideological and political education can be facilitated by ideological and political work integrated into the curriculum. Training in theoretical and applied skills is a type of literacy education. Students can thus benefit from this course by better understanding socialist principles. Political and ideological education aids students in identifying and combating harmful ideologies, defining their personal development objectives, and overcoming complacency [5]. Various factors, such as age, level of education, political beliefs, moral characteristics, cultural literacy, and values, exert influence on the ideological and political competence of individuals. This competence represents the primary task and objective of authentic \"moral education\" and contributes significantly to the development of individuals' ideological and political understanding. The study focused on a selection of 200 Chinese higher education institutions, which were chosen based on data obtained from several schools, with a specific emphasis on the setting of national ideology and political education. The study's primary findings can be summarized as follows. (1) Political and ideological education reform needs to be correctly understood by ideological and political teachers. Of them, 16.5% (or 33) still need to finish ideological and political practice courses despite having written many practice essays. 41.5% (83) of the faculty members believe that curriculum-based research projects are popular and have started curriculum reforms to secure research licenses. According to 42% (84) of the respondents, ideological and political education opinions are irrelevant for students. It has been proven that some university ideology teachers are not guided by education's primary tasks and goals but are engaged in research, writing papers and solving ideological and political problems in their courses. In-depth research and analysis of these phenomena do not have the expected effect and impact on the ideological and political phenomena. They are not crucial for the understanding of ideological and political education. As shown in Figure 1.\nuniversity instructors specializing in ideology and politics, comprising around thirteen percent of the sample, demonstrate a requirement for comprehensive understanding of the curriculum as well as ideological and political theory. This observation highlights the necessity for university teachers to enhance and reinforce the effectiveness of their ideological and political education system across social, administrative, and educational dimensions. The integration of talent development and political and ideological work is a fundamental aspect of ideological and political education. As shown in Figure 3."

            "text": "3.1 Fuzzy theory algorithm\n(1) Fuzzy control For simple control systems, parameter setting must be done by professional managers. However, parameter setting is challenging for complex control systems, and the dynamic characteristics do not guarantee stability. The fuzzy control algorithm is intelligent, and fuzzy control adapts to the changes in robot position, speed, and the corresponding parameters [6]. It can effectively solve real-time changes and complex control problems, achieve adaptability, and meet the requirements of the diversity of system characteristics. Fuzzy means that the actual input is added to the fuzzy set to be displayed; knowledge base means that the number of uncertainties must be based on the knowledge base and inference; inverse cryptography means that the fuzzy subset after the fuzzy operation is the only explicit and finite exact value [7]. Professor Zaid combines classical sets with multi-valued logic circuits to express and deal with meaningfully fuzzy concepts using numbers or functions. Since the establishment of fuzzy set theory, much work has been done in logical fuzzy theory. Use binary logic to distinguish and judge classical sets representing well-defined concepts [8]. Fuzzy logic is a theoretical extension of binary logic that can deal with a set of fuzzy concepts. The fuzzy control flow is shown in Figure 4.\nmaps the image from the grayscale region to the fuzzy region [12].\n( ) max1 ijij ij x x\nE x E\n \u2212    = = +  \n   (1)\nIts ( )ijE x center represents the pixel's gray value concerning the maximum gray level X. When the value of\nE is ij  2, = 0.5, the corresponding grayscale value is called the transition point. This method can be used to determine the transition point. Then, the central member performs a nonlinear transformation in the fuzzy domain to improve the correlation. From the above equation, it can be seen that the nonlinear transformation is a function of reducing the number of bars below 0.5 and increasing it above 0.5, thus increasing the contrast [13]. The updated equation is as follows.\n( )\n33 ,0 0.5 =\n1 3 1 , 0.5\nij ij\nij\nij ij\n  \n      \u2212 \u2212  (2)\n3.2 Ideological and Political Education\n(1) Connotation The main aim of the curriculum for ideological and political education is to effectively integrate and advance the fundamental concept of \"ideological and political education\" in a complete manner. This is achieved through the amalgamation of political theories that guide educational ideologies, together with the implicit professional curriculum. The primary focus and aim of Chinese education presently is the cultivation of \"personality education\" as its central work and mission [14]. The integration of ideological and political work into the curriculum plays a pivotal role in accomplishing this mission and aim, as well as fostering talent development. The policy's intellectual and political framework, as viewed through the lens of the \"people,\" serves as the progenitor and successor to socialism, driving the attainment of the Chinese dream. It remains resolute in its commitment to upholding and abiding by party leadership for future generations. In addition to fulfilling the pedagogical objective of cultivating moral values, the course on ideological and political theory serves as a precise means to achieve this end. The term \"carry out ideological and political work in the talent training system\" pertains to the execution of endeavors and measures designed to advance and cultivate ideological and political growth within the context of the talent training system. The curriculum of ideological and political science serves as a means to apply the educational philosophy and goals of the new period, as observed through the lens of educational disciplines. The primary objective of the reform program is to optimize the advantages and distinctive characteristics of each\ndiscipline within the realm of teacher training. This program aims to augment the vitality of its ideological and political framework, while concurrently strengthening the overall management of ideological and political education. Educators of various ideological and political orientations collectively have the burden of performing their ideological and political duties alongside their scholastic commitments as outlined in the curriculum. Hence, it is imperative that the realm of education encompasses all instructors to ensure comprehensive cultivation and implementation of ideological and political endeavors inside the curriculum. It is imperative for ideological and political theory courses to sufficiently equip students for the study of ideological and political theory, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant topics and allowing ample time and space for effective learning within occupational training courses [15]. Contrarily, it involves incorporating pertinent ideological and political components into the professional curriculum, such as integrating art courses, the best of Chinese traditional culture, faith in culture, and the integration of scientific and technological disciplines, technology, national sentiments, and a sense of mission. This course's ideological and political content reflects the essence of \"moral education\" that permeates national, revival, and patriotism consciousness and reflects the ideas of socialist higher education with Chinese characteristics. (2) Content of ideological and political education reform Ideological and political design courses have been added to the curriculum. When setting learning objectives, ideological and political objectives are set in addition to identifying social skills, business abilities and development potential. Depending on the type of course chosen, appropriate cases are selected and ideological and political elements are incorporated. The teacher is a good guide for the students, and the program reinforces the role of classroom political assessment, increases the assessment of classroom student groups, and improves the student's ability to complete specific tasks in the course. Students learn in teams and as learners to improve their skills and experience the impact of skill sets. The evaluation of student levels should take complete account of ideological and political criteria; the final evaluation of students should consider the role of moral education and the establishment of students' core socialist values; students' learning attitudes and daily behavior should consider a certain percentage of students and their test scores. Online classroom content increase is an effective cultivation method to enrich students' learning methods [16]. It has unique advantages compared to traditional methods. Digital resources such as micro-videos and audio-videos are developed in the online classroom according to the type of course and students' psychological characteristics. To improve the ideological and political impact of the classroom and verify the design's effectiveness by disseminating and engaging what students like to do online. (3) Evaluation indicators\nThe key measure employed to assess the efficacy of ideological and political education programs is training effectiveness. The practical scientific assessment of teaching should be grounded in the curriculum or professional standards, with a focus on evaluating and analyzing the complete process of student learning. The resulting evaluation outcomes should then be utilized by ideological and political instructors to reflect upon and change their teaching methods. When formulating a teaching evaluation, it is imperative to take into account many key factors: the establishment of emotional connections and values, the understanding of ideological and political education, and the ability to incorporate ideological and political education in the assessment of students' practical teaching efficacy. When instructing ideological and political subjects, a combination of process evaluation and dynamic evaluation is employed, along with a blend of quantitative and subjective evaluation methods. The evaluation exercises ought to encompass several aspects, including the assessment of students, counselors, and ideological and political teachers. These exercises should also involve student selfevaluation, as well as the mutual evaluation between students and ideological and political teachers. Additionally, the evaluation of ideological and political teachers themselves should be considered [17]. The evaluation system includes, as shown in Figure 6."

            "text": "The determination of the central place of ideological and political theory courses within the curricular framework remains an ongoing consideration. Prominent scholars within the academic community have proposed the improvement of ideological and political science education in educational institutions through a reduction in instructors' instructional time. As a result, there has been a need for the comprehensive integration of essential subject matter from university-level ideological and political science courses into the curriculum of contemporary vocational and technical institutions. This involves the conversion of vocational and technical courses into auxiliary elements of ideological and political science education. This statement seems to be inaccurate. A higher education institution is an establishment that provides training for individuals seeking to acquire\nadvanced professional and technical skills. This concept places emphasis on the proficiency and comparative expertise of individuals within specific industrial domains. To effectively integrate an understanding of additional ideological and political variables, it is not feasible to haphazardly reduce the allocation of hours dedicated to course content and instructional time within a certain course. The allocation of time for professional courses restricts the extent to which the ideology and political theory course can be included. The interpretation of \"comprehensive quality education\" does not encompass the inclusion of all professors teaching ideological and political theory courses, regardless of their ideological and political affiliations. Although courses and programs in ideological and political theory are not typically offered within the curriculum of professional ideological and political theory courses, it is imperative that the philosophy and instructional approaches employed in specialized courses adhere to scientific principles. The primary focus and constituent that arises is the advancement of ideological and political philosophy [18]. Some universities and training centers think the course must achieve its goals. The problems of the current educational reform of the Civics course are shown in Figure 7.\n(3) Instructional strategies are nothing new. One of the pedagogical objectives of ideological and political school curricula is to avoid innovation in the study of ideology and politics. Political and ideological teachers are insufficiently knowledgeable about how the curriculum is ideologically and politically shaped, lack specific practical experience, and become stagnant in their teaching, all of which cause a deviation in their knowledge and understanding of how to teach about how the curriculum is ideologically and politically shaped, how to build and educate, and how to integrate teaching work with the concept of work successfully. Additionally, due to the rapid development of information technology, the teaching environment, mode, and current pedagogy have undergone significant changes. However, this course only partially enables students' independent learning before or after class, which impacts the efficacy of programs for the public's ideological and political education [20].\n4.2 Objectives and requirements of curriculum reform\n(1) Objectives Regarding learning objectives and those related to cognitive and professional skills, moral education objectives were added to develop students' thinking and behavioral skills. In terms of content, a new model of \"big ideas and big policies\" is being developed by applying values in theory and laboratory classes. The focus is on developing the correct career, worldview and values. Students are trained in self-education, family life, vocational and patriotic skills to acquire a multidimensional, warm and thick character. (2) Requirements There is a need to enhance the formation of comprehensive ideological and political frameworks. School administrators should additionally establish procedures to facilitate the implementation of these programs. It is imperative for them to clearly articulate the standards and objectives associated with these initiatives, develop comprehensive plans and tasks, and design appropriate curricula. It is imperative to implement a comprehensive and inclusive ideological and political education system that encompasses all subjects and assigns the responsibility of education to all ideological and political instructors. This approach is crucial for effectively integrating ideological and political education into the school curriculum. Teachers are the guides and role models of students' growth, and their ideological and political processes are essential for implementing the Platform. On the one hand, schools should encourage ideology teachers to recognize the importance of developing curricula and policies so that they can become people with a deep sense of education, high moral character, and rich experience; on the other hand, they should familiarize ideology teachers with the teaching\nphilosophy and work requirements of the ideology and politics subject, and correct their attitude toward the ideology and politics subject, so that they understand that \"other subjects surround ideology and politics.\" First, efforts should be made to raise the awareness of the majority of professional ideology and politics teachers about the importance of teaching ideology and politics so that they can actively participate in the reform of teaching ideology and politics. In the promotion work, educators must understand that professional education and training policies are not contradictory and separate but can integrate and cooperate. The educational goal of promoting the overall development of students can be achieved if professional ideology and political science teachers not only improve their students' knowledge but also guide and motivate them on a cultural and intellectual level. Furthermore, it is recommended that educators specializing in ideology and politics take proactive measures to enhance the availability of ideological and political education, hence enhancing the overall efficacy of teaching this particular subject matter. Ideological and political science teachers should not only master the subject knowledge but also the culture, paradigm and basic methods of the subject ideas, based on which they can engage in ideological and political work with composure. For example, ideology and politics teachers can combine classroom content with ideological education without losing the opportunity. Extended engagement in communication with students regarding post-graduation matters is also feasible. They can also organize extracurricular activities to improve students' intellectual qualities in practice. Finally, a model platform for teaching ideological and political science courses is proposed so that ideological and political science teachers can gradually master the teaching methods of ideological and political science from level to depth. For example, lectures on assessment of ideology and politics courses are held regularly, ideology and politics training for ideology and politics teachers are organized, demonstration activities are held, and opinions of experts and scholars are sought. All these are effective ways to help ideological and political science teachers accumulate experience and improve their ability to implement ideological and political theory courses."

It is imperative that students receive guidance in the development of professional ethics, the cultivation of essential skills, and the acquisition of knowledge in their respective fields of study. Emphasis should be placed on the establishment of\nengineering ethics, fostering a sense of national identity, and nurturing a creative mindset. Additionally, due attention should be given to the personal growth and advancement of students. Simultaneously, the evaluation is predicated by the qualitative advancement and valueadded of students. The construction of excellent campus culture includes the creation of China's excellent revolutionary traditional culture, excellent and harmonious campus cultural activities and the creation of excellent corporate culture. Strengthen the education of the advanced ideological traditions and cultural and spiritual traditions of the Chinese nation for the youth, cultivate and promote the advanced national spiritual culture with national patriotic consciousness as the core strength of the culture and establish the spirit of the Chinese nation of the times with adherence to reform, development, innovation and openness as the core political motivation. For the youth school education to land and take root, it must further highlight the characteristics of national campus culture and the establishment of ideological and political characteristics of the curriculum system. (6) Ideological and political education curriculum combined with innovative pedagogy is essential in cultivating outstanding talents. Curriculum innovation teaching is a prerequisite for cultivating high-quality technical talents. In engineering teaching, students should be instilled with the professional spirit and skills of practice, entrepreneurship, rigor, standardization and lawabiding, and cultivate their awareness of developing innovative thinking, which is reasonably integrated into the curriculum.

The integration of innovative ideological and political activity into curricula is vital to enhance the pertinence and efficacy of learning and educational pursuits. It is imperative to ensure the profound integration of these methodologies into current Western scientific and educational procedures. The effective utilization of information technology is crucial for the ideological and political curriculum education center to carry out teaching activities for this set of courses. It is important to enhance the ideological and political resources of this course and employ flexible teaching methods such as PBL courseware, summary, and case method approaches to facilitate knowledge sharing and skill development among students. The education system focused on ideological and political technology should strive to align with the digital means of ideological and political information technology education. Its objective should be to educate students in enhancing their engineering ideology and morality, fostering patriotic sentiments, and cultivating an innovative technology spirit. To achieve this, it is essential to leverage the\nadvantages of digital education and learning methods, thereby promoting the comprehensive development of digital ideological and political education resources and effectively implementing digital ideologies."
