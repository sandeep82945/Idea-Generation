    "abstractText": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the healthcare landscape drastically. Stricken by sharp surges in morbidity and mortality with resource and manpower shortages confounding their efforts, the medical community has witnessed high rates of burnout and post-traumatic stress amongst themselves. Whilst the prevailing literature has offered glimpses into their professional war, no review thus far has collated the deeply personal reflections of physicians and ascertained how their self-concept, self-esteem and perceived self-worth has altered during this crisis. Without adequate intervention, this may have profound effects on their mental and physical health, personal relationships and professional efficacy. Methods: With mentions of the coronavirus pervading social media by the millions, this paper set out to collate and thematically analyse social media posts containing first-person physician reflections on how COVID-19 affected their lives and their coping mechanisms. A consistent search strategy was employed and a PRISMA flowchart was used to map out the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: A total of 590 social media posts were screened, 511 evaluated, and 108 included for analysis. Salient themes identified include Disruptions to Personal Psycho-Emotional State, Disruptions to Professional Care Delivery, Concern for Family, Response from Institution, Response from Society and Coping Mechanisms. Conclusion: It is evident that the distress experienced by physicians during this time has been manifold, multifaceted and dominantly negative. Self-concepts were distorted with weakened self-esteem and perceived self-worth observed. The Ring Theory of Personhood (RToP) was adopted to explain COVID-19\u2019s impact on physician personhood as it considers existential, individual, relational and social concepts of the self. These entwined self-concepts serve as \u2018compensatory\u2019 to one another, with coping mechanisms buffering and fortifying the physician\u2019s overall personhood. With healthcare institutions playing a vital role in providing timely and targeted support, it was further proposed that a comprehensive assessment tool based on the RToP could be developed to detect at-risk physicians and evaluate the presence and effectiveness of established support structures. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Methods: With mentions of the coronavirus pervading social media by the millions, this paper set out to collate and thematically analyse social media posts containing first-person physician reflections on how COVID-19 affected their lives and their coping mechanisms. A consistent search strategy was employed and a PRISMA flowchart was used to map out the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\nResults: A total of 590 social media posts were screened, 511 evaluated, and 108 included for analysis. Salient themes identified include Disruptions to Personal Psycho-Emotional State, Disruptions to Professional Care Delivery, Concern for Family, Response from Institution, Response from Society and Coping Mechanisms.\nConclusion: It is evident that the distress experienced by physicians during this time has been manifold, multifaceted and dominantly negative. Self-concepts were distorted with weakened self-esteem and perceived self-worth observed. The Ring Theory of Personhood (RToP) was adopted to explain COVID-19\u2019s impact on physician personhood as it considers existential, individual, relational and social concepts of the self. These entwined self-concepts serve as \u2018compensatory\u2019 to one another, with coping mechanisms buffering and fortifying the physician\u2019s overall personhood. With healthcare institutions playing a vital role in providing timely and targeted support, it was further proposed that a comprehensive assessment tool based on the RToP could be developed to detect at-risk physicians and evaluate the presence and effectiveness of established support structures.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "The COVID-19 global pandemic has raged devastations on economies, social practices and have overwhelmed healthcare systems like never before in modern times [1\u2013 4]. Unprecedented waves of morbidity and mortality have seen a whirlwind of attempts to contain the infection amidst shortages in manpower and personal protective equipment [5, 6]. With their professional responsibilities pushed to the fore, it is perhaps easy to take for granted the profound humanity of these healthcare workers and the acute distress they are called to shoulder. Rates of burnout and post-traumatic stress have been astronomical [7\u201310]. Although \u00a0BBC interviews [11, 12] and various podcasts [13, 14] have provided glimpses into their harrowing professional lives, no review conducted thus far has given sufficient voice to their deeply personal stories\u00a0in particular,\u00a0how the crisis has affected their\u00a0perceptions of themselves. This notion of self-concept is significant as it is tied closely to self-image,\u00a0self-esteem, and perceived self-worth [15\u201319]. Without adequate intervention, this may have longitudinal ramifications on their mental and physical health, personal relationships and professional efficacy [20\u201323].\nAs George Agich observed, reflections serve as the intellectual concomitant of adaptive and coping behaviours in the face of internal and external disruptions to habitual routines [24]. On 28 February 2020 alone,\u00a0Forbes\u00a0reported that 6.7 million people mentioned coronavirus on social media [25] and analytics company Sprinklr reported over 19 million mentions of coronavirus-related terms just weeks later [26]. Some\u00a0of these were from personal reflections written by physicians. This paper thus\u00a0 set out to collate social media posts containing first-person physician reflections on how the precarious climate has affected their personal and professional lives. In tandem, it looked at the coping mechanisms that have fortified them. In the process, the paper identified a\u00a0key conceptual framework that may elucidate ways in which healthcare institutions could better proffer timely and targeted support."

With all aspects of life, social media and medicine focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, one physician acknowledged that her struggles were rooted in her inability to disconnect due to the pandemic\u2019s\u00a0 intrusive presence. Lack of time for self-care for another saw rashes burgeoning all over his chest, neck and arms.

Yet, multiple physicians notably reported greater disconnect from their patients, either due to the lack of human touch afforded by these online interactions or their diminished personability when suited up in protective gear. One described a dementia patient cowering in fear and wailing upon seeing her \u2013 \u2018I wasn\u2019t human,\u2019 she observed. The distortion of their faces, muffling of their voices and inability to maintain eye contact intervened with their duty and desire to care and comfort.

Well beyond the scope of this paper, comprehensive overviews and diverse perspectives have been offered by Carrithers et\u00a0 al. (1985) [54], Sarah Bishop Merrill (1998) [55] and Huyssteen et\u00a0 al. (2011) [56].

Personhood is broadly defined here as \u2018what makes you, you\u2019. Although particularly pertinent to issues surrounding euthanasia, abortion and dementia care [60\u201365], for the sentient person, it also calls into question one\u2019s personal belief in their right to life and willingness or ability to live. The RToP captures evolving concepts of personhood through porous circles that correspond with one\u2019s Innate, Individual, Relational and Societal Ring. The RToP draws attention to whether the elements that presently \u2018make you, you\u2019 will suffice to bolster you in\nthe face of extended suffering or if they serve as sources of duress themselves."

            "text": "The greatest strength of the RToP framework is that it encaptures personhood as an individualised, situationspecific and evolving concept. Here, sizes of the rings correspond to the number of elements contained within them, the most important positioned closest to the centre. If long-standing spiritual beliefs once ingrained no longer have significant bearings on the physician\u2019s personhood, this element may be removed from their Innate Ring, thus shrinking its size. If colleagues once distant grow closer due to shared harrowing experiences in the COVID-19 pandemic, these colleagues may shift from the Societal Ring to the Relational Ring.\nIn addition, the presence of coping strategies account for the rings\u2019 \u2018compensatory\u2019 nature. Whilst various forms of suffering serve as tensions that threaten the integrity of specific rings, coping strategies may serve as \u2018buffers\u2019 which continue to fortify the physician\u2019s overall concept of personhood. An example is visualised in Fig.\u00a01 where the overall size of the rings are maintained despite internal changes. As death anxiety threatens their spiritual faith, the Innate Ring shrinks in size and influence. As fraught ethical triaging disintegrates the cogency of their moral values and as racial attacks threaten their\nFig. 1 Compensatory Nature of Rings\nsocietal membership, the Individual and Societal Ring also shrink. However, the presence of strong intercollegial support from close co-workers may imbue them with a sense of personal value through validation of their efforts. The Relational Ring thus successfully buffers against loss of integrity in the other rings. This encapsulates the paramount importance of providing physicians with timely and targeted support.\nProviding timely, targeted support Studies have underscored the pivotal role of healthcare institutions and offered cogent means of bolstering the psychological resilience of physicians amidst this time of crisis [7\u20139, 30, 33]. Adopting the RToP framework and building upon salient themes drawn from these reflections, a comprehensive assessment tool could be developed, validated and used to quickly detect at-risk physicians with compromised self-concepts and poor coping strategies. For if prolonged, these may amplify their risk of psychopathological disorders and behaviours highlighted earlier. From an established list, physicians could identify prevailing elements within each of their rings, their relative importance to one another and the sources and strength of duress and buffers in place. Whilst clinical tools such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [82], PTSD Scale-Self Report for DSM-5 (PSS-SR5) [83] and UConn Racial/ Ethnic Stress & Trauma Survey [84] are scaled based on frequency or intensity of specific psychological states or events, the RToP tool instead offers a visual manifestation of their overarching personhood by illustrating\u00a0 the general integrity of each ring \u2013 either significantly weakened by personal sufferings or thickened by buffers established. Here, healthcare institutions could administer this tool and direct susceptible physicians to a dedicated team of medical social workers for urgent, targeted intervention. Personal coping strategies such as positive reframing and the various practices of self-care outlined in Table\u00a01 may be further encouraged.\nAs the full effects of this devastating pandemic may only be realised in years to come, the novel tool may also serve as a longitudinal intervention used to assess the presence and effectiveness of buffers established by local healthcare institutions. Many deficiencies have been highlighted in these reflections. These include the timely provision of adequate personal protective equipment, swab testing for high-risk physicians and up-to-date briefs to minimise feelings of professional impotence. In addition, childcare arrangements and lodging for those isolating from their families have proven to be much needed. As support should not only be reactive but proactively designed, nurturing intercollegial solidarity should be prioritised as it offers opportunities for role\nmodelling and the mutual trading of life experiences, advice and lighthearted camaraderie. The institution of such support structures will affirm these physicians that their needs are valid and their lives valued."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "Framed through The Ring Theory of Personhood, it is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has not only dramatically altered the day to day routines of physicians, but that these changes have had detrimental impact on intrinsic perceptions of who they are and their value to others. Whilst it is clear that social media platforms are brimming with insight and offer remarkable opportunities for self-expression, negotiation and a re-establishment of control, speaking up on such public interfaces as a healthcare professional is still contentious at best. The very act of posting on these platforms underlines a desire for discourse, interaction and validation. If local healthcare institutions offer timely, targeted support and actively avail avenues for honest conversations, this may ameliorate their strong need to express their personal grievances online. Simply put, physicians are requesting to be heard. Amidst the bleakness of their days, addressing their concerns head-on may offer them a greater semblance of hope and strengthen their self-concepts, self-esteem and self-worth.\nAbbreviation RToP: Ring Theory of Personhood.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13010- 021- 00113-x.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Appendix A.
