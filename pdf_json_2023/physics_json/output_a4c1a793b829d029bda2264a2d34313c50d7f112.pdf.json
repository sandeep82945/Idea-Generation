    "abstractText": "Prothioconazole (PTC) is a broad-spectrum triazole fungicide with one asymmetric center and consists of two enantiomers, R-(\u2212)-PTC and S-(+)-PTC. To address the concern of its environmental safety, the enantioselective toxic effects of PTC on Scendesmus obliquus (S. obliquus) were investigated. PTC racemates (Rac-PTC) and enantiomers exhibited dose-dependent acute toxicity effects against S. obliquus at a concentration from 1 to 10 mg\u00b7L\u22121. The 72 h-EC50 value of Rac-, R-(\u2212)-, and S-(+)-PTC is 8.15, 16.53, and 7.85 mg\u00b7L\u22121, respectively. The growth ratios and photosynthetic pigment contents of the R-(\u2212)-PTC treatment groups were higher than the Racand S-(+)-PTC treatment groups. Both catalase (CAT) activities and esterase activities were inhibited in the Racand S-(+)-PTC treatment groups at high concentrations of 5 and 10 mg\u00b7L\u22121, and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were elevated, which exceeded the levels in algal cells for the R-(\u2212)-PTC treatment groups. PTC could disrupt the cell morphology of S. obliquus and induce cell membrane damage, following the order of S-(+)-PTC \u2248 Rac-PTC > R-(\u2212)-PTC. The enantioselective toxic effects of PTC on S. obliquus provide essential information for its ecological risk assessment.",

About 84% of triazole fungicides are chiral, and most of them are sold and used in the form of racemates [2,3]. They may contain enantiomers, which ineffectively target organisms or are even harmful to non-target organisms [4]. Consequently, the ecological security and stereoselective bioactivities of chiral triazole fungicides should not be ignored, which play an important role in developing efficient and low-toxic green pesticides. Prothioconazole (CAS:178928-70-6, PTC), as a highly effective broad-spectrum triazole fungicide, is extensively used in agriculture to battle diseases in crops by inhibiting the ergosterol biosynthesis of fungi [1,5]. It has become a mainstream product in fungicides, ranking third in fungicide sales and first in cereal fungicides [1,6]. The widespread use of PTC has inevitably led to residue in various environmental matrices. PTC has been detected in small agricultural streams of Norway and Germany, where the median total concentration of 76 pesticides, including PTC, was 0.18 \u00b5g\u00b7L\u22121 in Germany, and rainfall events could increase their concentration by 10 times [7,8]. 36% of Serbia soil samples have PTC residues with a concentration of 0.08 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5g\u00b7kg\u22121 [9]. PTC and its metabolites were also detected in air samples from Germany [10]. The residues of PTC with high concentrations (365 \u00b5g\u00b7kg\u22121) were also detected in the bee pollen of Poland [11]. PTC has one asymmetric center and consists of two enantiomers, R-(\u2212)-PTC and S-(+)-PTC (Figure 1). It showed remarkable stereoselective bioactivities. R-(\u2212)-PTC was 85 to 2768 times more active than S-(+)-PTC and Rac-PTC against five target pathogens,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4774. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28124774 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4774 2 of 14\nincluding wheat phytoalexin, rice blast fungus, exserohilum turcicum, Alternaria triticina, and Fusarium avenaceum, with an EC50 ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 mg/L [12]. Similar higher antifungal activity of R-(\u2212)-PTC (6-262 times) was also observed by Zhang et al. (2019) [3]. Additionally, the degradation and accumulation of PTC enantiomers are also enantioselective. The faster degradation of R-(\u2212)-PTC in the soil was reported with a half-life within six days in comparison with S-(+)-PTC, while S-(+)-PTC preferentially accumulated in earthworms (Eisenia fetida) [13]. R-(\u2212)-PTC was preferentially degraded in tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers under greenhouse conditions [14]. The existing studies have focused on the activity evaluation and residual dynamics of PTC [1,3,12,14], while their toxicological effects of them were poorly understood, particularly in aquatic organisms.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15\nto 2768 times more active than S-(+)-PTC and Rac-PTC against five target pathogens, including wheat phytoalexin, rice blast fungus, exserohilum turcicum, Alternaria triticina, and Fusarium avenaceum, with an EC50 ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 mg/L [12].

Structures of PTC enantiomers.\nPTC has a high water solubility (300 mg\u00b7L\u22121) and is stable to hydrolysis (half-lives = 17.8\u201334.7 d) [1,15]. It was reported to have acute toxicity on Chlorella pyrenoidosa (EC50 = 9.33 mg\u00b7L\u22121) [12], Lemna mino L. (EC50 = 1.85 mg\u00b7L\u22121) [12], Daphnia magna (EC50\u201348 h =2.82 mg\u00b7L\u22121) [16], and Zebrafish embryos (LC50\u201396 h = 1.70 mg\u00b7L\u22121) [17]. PTC could induce developmental toxicity, cardiovascular effects, and oxidative damage in zebrafish [1,5,17]. It also adversely affected the growth and reproduction of Daphnia magna [16]. However, the enantioselective effects of PTC on aquatic organisms are very limited, and thus it is essential to further investigate their toxicological effects. Microalgae are the dominant and primary producers in aquatic ecosystems and play a vital role in oxygen production, as well as the nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycle [18,19]. Minor disruptions of them may cause huge impacts on the entire ecosystem [18,19]. Thus, the toxicity effect of chiral PTC on microalgae merits more attention. In this study, the toxicity effects of Rac-PTC and PTC enantiomers on S. obliquus were assessed. Different biomarkers, such as growth inhibition, photosynthetic pigments, oxidative damage, esterase activity, and membrane damage of S. obliquus, were investigated after PTC exposure. The responses of S. obliquus cells to PTC were further evaluated by flow cytometry. In addition, the interactions of PTC with S. obliquus were also analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This research facilitates a better understanding of the enantioselective toxic effects of PTC on S. obliquus and provides data for ecological risk assessments of PTC and the appropriate use of PTC.\n2. Results and Discussions 2.1. Enantioselective Growth Inhibition of PTC on S. obliquus\nThe effects of R-PTC, S-PTC, and Rac-PTC on S. obliquus growth were dosedependent, as shown in Figure 2. Compared to the control group, the growth inhibition ratio was enhanced with increasing PTC concentration in all groups except for 0.5 mg/L. Among them, the growth IR increased first and then decreased with increasing exposure time in the R-PTC-treated groups, with a maximum IR of 34.11%. A similar trend was observed at lower concentrations of S-PTC and Rac-PTC (\u2264 5 mg\u00b7L\u22121), while the growth IR was enhanced with time at high concentrations (10 mg\u00b7L\u22121), with a maximum IR of 63.69%\nFigure 1.

The toxicity of S-(+)-PTC was the highest, with a 72 h-EC value of 7.85 mg\u00b7L\u22121, followed by Rac-PTC (EC50 = 8.15 mg\u00b7L\u22121). According to the acute toxicity classification criteria of green algae, the toxicity of PTC to the S. obliquus of PTC showed low toxicity [15]. Likewise, Zhai et al. (2018) also found that S-(+)-PTC showed higher acute toxicity to Chlorella pyrenoidosa (EC50 = 89.4 mg\u00b7L\u22121) and Lemna minor L. (EC50 = 0.49 mg\u00b7L\u22121) in comparison with R-(\u2212)-PTC [12]. However, the toxicity of R-(\u2212)-PTC and S-(+)-PTC on Chlorella pyrenoidosa was reportedly less than Rac-PTC (EC50 = 9.33 mg\u00b7L\u22121), and their acute toxicity to Lemna minor L. was greater than Rac-PTC [12]. These discrepancies might be due to the different model organisms used in the experiment. A recent study found\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4774 4 of 14\nthat the acute toxicities of S-(+)-PTC and Rac-PTC to Chlorella pyrenoidosa were higher than R-(\u2212)-PTC, with 48 h-EC50 values of 9.64 and 12.21 mg/L, respectively [15]. This trend is in consistent with our observation on the stereoselective toxicity of PTC toward S. obliquus. Although the acute toxicities of PTC racemates and enantiomers to microalgae have been reported [12,15], the toxic effects and potential toxicity mechanisms have not been explored.\nTable 1.

            "text": "Photosynthetic pigments are the basis for algae photosynthesis, and their changes can reflect algae growth [20]. Chlorophylls play a crucial role in light capture, energy transfer, and light conversion into chemical energy, while carotenoids protect the production of chlorophyll and absorption of light energy, playing an important role in the stress signaling pathway [19,20]. Thus, the effects of the racemates and enantiomers of PTC on pigments were investigated. As shown in Figure 3, the relative contents of Ca, Cb, and Cc showed a dose-dependent reduction trend, except for 0.5 mg\u00b7L\u22121. Notably, R-(\u2212)-PTC could increase the contents of photosynthetic pigments at 0.5 mg/L as compared with the control. Likewise, an increase of Ca and Cc was also observed in the 0.5 mg\u00b7L\u22121 Rac-PTC treatment group. It might be due to the fact that algae possibly took advantage of a supply of carbon and nitrogen sources coming from the Rac-PTC and R-(\u2212)-PTC at low concentrations [21,22]. The diminution of the algae photosynthetic pigment content under high concentrations of PTC (>0.5 mg/L) was probably due to the peroxidative breakdown of pigments and membrane lipids by ROS [20,23,24]. A similar reduction trend was observed by Nong et al. (2021) when they studied the impacts of three common azole fungicides (myclobutanil, propiconazole, and tebuconazole) on chlorophyll synthesis in Chlorella pyrenoidosa [23]. In addition, significant enantioselective inhibition effects of PTC on Ca and Cc were observed at high concentrations (\u22655 mg\u00b7L\u22121) after 72 h of exposure, with the order of S-(+)-PTC > Rac-PTC > R-(\u2212)-PTC. Regarding Cb, the greatest remarkable decrease in the S-(\u2212)-PTC-treated groups were observed in comparison with the R-(+)-PTC and Rac-PTC treatment groups after 72 h of exposure.

To maintain the steady-state levels of ROS in the cell, an antioxidant enzyme participates in antioxidant protection processes. The CAT catalyzes the degradation or reduction of H2O2 to water and oxygen molecules [21,24]. In this study, the content of the CAT was increased first and then decreased with the increase of the PTC concentration upon treatment with Rac-PTC and S-(+)-PTC, while the CAT activity was enhanced with the increased concentration of R(\u2212)-PTC, except for 5 mg\u00b7L\u22121 (Figure 4A). The initial increase of the CAT induced by Rac-PTC and S-(+)-PTC might be due to hormesis [20,21], whereas the decrease in the CAT might be attributed to the overproduction of ROS, because it could destroy the intrinsic antioxidant defense of cells, resulting in lethal damage to the cells [21,23].

Considering the difference in CAT activities among the R-(\u2212)-PTC, S-(+)-PTC, and S-(+)-PTC treatment groups at high concentrations (\u22655 mg\u00b7L\u22121), the esterase activity was further analyzed by FDA staining in combination with flow cytometry to better understand the toxicity mechanism of PTC on algae. FDA is a nonfluorescent lipophilic molecule that can freely cross the plasma membrane and produce green fluorescence after hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases within living cells [25,26]. Therefore, the change of fluoresce in fluorescence intensity can reflect esterase activity. As shown in Figure 5, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFT) of FL1 decreased after treatment with 5 and 10 mg\u00b7L\u22121 of PTC with respect to the negative control, especially at 10 mg\u00b7L\u22121. The decrease in MFT might be due to the quenching of esterase activity or the destruction of cell membranes, reducing the absorption of the dye [25,26]. The effects of PTC on esterase activity showed enantioselectivity. R-(\u2212)-PTC showed the greatest MFT in contrast with S-PTC and Rac-PTC. This result, together with the above oxidative stress effect, indicated that the toxicity effect of S-PTC and Rac-PTC on S. obliquus was higher than R-PTC.\nFigure 4.

They are composed of cellulose, polysaccharides, phospholipids bilayer, proteins, carbohydrates, and other substances [27,28]. These biomacromolecules play an important role in the stability of the cell surface structure and cell function, which are vital signs in toxic evaluation [27,28]. They have spectral characteristic bands, such as lipids (1726 cm\u22121, C=O), proteins (N-H 3300 cm\u22121, Amide I 1639 cm\u22121, and Amide II 1541 cm\u22121), and carbohydrates (1200\u2013800 cm\u22121, C-O, C-H) [28,29]. The variations in peak intensities can reflect the changes in the biochemical composition of the algae surface upon PTC treatment [28]. Thus, the interaction and potential impacts of PTC on microalgae were analyzed by FTIR. Compared with the control, the intensity of the protein-related peak at 3300 cm\u22121 (N\u2013 H, Amide II) and the carboxylate group (COO-) of protein at 1450 to 1300 cm\u22121 were decreased when S. obliquus co-existed with 5 mg\u00b7L\u22121 Rac-PTC and its enantiomers for 72 h (Figure 6). Likewise, the protein-related band at 1650 cm\u22121 (N\u2013H, C-O, Amide I) [29] was shrunk in the Rac-PTC and R-PTC treatment groups. These decreases were accredited to the changes in the protein structures on the algae surface. Apart from protein-related bands, the intensity of the phosphorylated molecules correlation band (P=O, 1270 cm\u22121) was also decreased after the treatment of Rac-PTC and its enantiomers, which indicates that PTC could induce cell membrane damage [30].

An algal growth inhibition test was conducted according to the updated OECD guideline 201 [36]. Exponential growth phase algal cells were cultivated in 150 mL of a culture medium with a series of Rac-PTC or PTC enantiomer dilution concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg\u00b7L\u22121) in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with an initial cell density of 4.33 \u00d7 105 cells\u00b7mL\u22121 (OD685 = 0.018) for 72 h. To ensure optimum growth, the flasks were shaken five times, and their position\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4774 11 of 14\nin the incubator was randomly changed per day. Algal cell density was monitored at 685 nm by UV spectrophotometer (UNICO 2802 S, Franksville, WI, USA) and counted with a hemocytometer under an optical microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) per 24 h. Three replicates were performed for each treatment. The regression equation for the relationship between cell density (y \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 105 cells\u00b7mL\u22121) and absorption at 685 nm (x) was calculated as y = 90.16x + 2.71 (p < 0.01, R2 = 0.98). The effective concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition (EC50) were calculated by a probit equation based on the growth inhibition ratios induced by PTC. The algal growth inhibition ratio (IR) was calculated using the following equation:\nIRi(%) = Cci \u2212 Cti\nCci \u00d7 100%\nwhere IRi is the growth inhibition rate at time i; Cci is the cell density of the control at time i; and Cti is the cell density of the treated group at time i."

PTC racemates and enantiomers have acute toxicities to the concentration-dependent inhibition effects on algal growth and photosynthesis toward S. obliquus at 1\u201310 mg\u00b7L\u22121, with the order of Rac-PTC \u2248 S-PTC > R-PTC. The inhibition of algae growth by PTC was contributed partly by the interference with the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. PTC could induce oxidative damage to S. obliquus at high concentrations (\u22655 mg\u00b7L\u22121). It caused an imbalance between the antioxidant system and oxidative stress and impaired the cell morphology and membrane permeability of S. obliquus, especially the in Rac-PTC and S-(+)-PTC treatment groups. Additionally, PTC could interfere with the composition of biomacromolecules on the algae surface. These results revealed the stereoselective toxicities of PTC to S. obliquus and that the ecological risks of PTC should be assessed at the stereoselective level to reduce the hidden dangers of PTC to the environment.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, Q.X.; Formal analysis, C.T.; Investigation, Q.X.; Data curation, Q.X.; Writing\u2014original draft, Q.X.; Writing\u2014review & editing, Y.Z. and C.T.; Supervision, Y.Z.; Funding acquisition, Y.Z.
