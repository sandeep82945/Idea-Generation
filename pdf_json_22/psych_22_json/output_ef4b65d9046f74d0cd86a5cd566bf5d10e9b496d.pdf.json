    "abstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has created the need to develop psychological interventions to support people with dementia and their caregivers in the context of social distancing. This study sought to investigate, systematize, and report results of scientific studies published in the past 5 years on synchronous online psychological interventions using videoconferencing for informal caregivers of people with dementia. The PubMed, BIREME, and Web of Science databases were searched using the descriptors \u201ccaregiver,\u201d \u201cdementia,\u201d \u201conline,\u201d and \u201cintervention.\u201d Six international studies were included in the review. Results demonstrated, in general, that this modality of intervention was acceptable, feasible, and promoted benefits for the health, quality of life, and well-being of caregivers. A need was identified for further studies investigating synchronous online interventions that include follow-up and a control group to further the evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of this type of therapeutic intervention.",

            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "Dementia is a syndrome characterized by decline in one or more cognitive domains, beyond that expected in normal aging. There are an estimated 50 million people living with dementia worldwide and a further 10 million new cases every year, with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) being the most common type1. The condition affects not only the individual with the disease but also their caregivers and family members who assist them in carrying out activities of daily living2, as well as dealing with the challenges posed by disease progression.\nWomen, particularly daughters or wives, predominantly perform this role3, taking on multiple tasks and sometimes a triple workload that includes formal work, routine housekeeping, and caring for an elderly relative. This situation can lead to difficulties involving communication; division of tasks and relationships among family members; culminating in a high burden associated with stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; and disruption in the family balance4,5.\nGiven the numerous deleterious effects on the mental and physical health of caregivers, interventions have been devised aimed at improving the quality of life and well-being of this population. The main intervention approaches include (a) counseling and psychotherapy (individual, group, and family), (b) psychoeducation, (c) multicomponent interventions (combining several intervention strategies to address a range of caregiver needs), and (d) interventions based on full attention (employing mindfulness strategies and other meditation techniques)6.\nInterventions for caregivers can be in-person or face-to-face, by telephone, or over the Internet7. Those conducted on the Internet can be synchronous and/or asynchronous. Synchronous interventions offer the advantage of having a prescheduled time and day, helping the caregiver prepare for and take part in interventions. Asynchronous interventions have the advantage that they can be performed at any time of the day, allowing the caregiver to engage in the activities when free to do so. However, this latter approach requires self-discipline and good organizing skills in order to be effective. Huis in het Veld et\u00a0al.8 delivered an asynchronous intervention via email and videos involving 81 families of caregivers of persons with dementia. The study failed to obtain favorable results using this approach, reporting no improvement in the quality of life of participants. This poor outcome may have been due to the low engagement of family members regarding the materials delivered.\nBoots et\u00a0al.9 conducted a systematic review of online asynchronous and synchronous interventions for this\npopulation, concluding that Internet-based interventions are promising and can help improve caregiver well-being. The authors, however, highlighted that further studies are needed to develop and support protocols, as well as to confirm these positive findings.\nThe COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-19) pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has created a need to conduct health consultations remotely so as to reduce the risk of cross-contamination through close personal contact10. This situation has prompted the need to adapt interventions for remote application and apply them online by videoconferencing (VC). Referred collectively as \u201ctelehealth\u201d, these video calls take place live using software11 through which health professionals provide patients with advice and address their health needs.\nAgainst this backdrop, and given the current importance of implementing online synchronous interventions for caregivers of persons with dementia, the objective of this study was to investigate, systematize, and present the results of studies published in the past 5 years on group and/or individual therapeutic interventions by VC for informal caregivers of this patient group."

            "text": "The present integrative review of the literature entailed a detailed search of the PubMed, BIREME, and Web of Science databases between September and October 2020. Relevant articles published in the past 5 years were searched. The search string employed the following English descriptors combined using Boolean operator AND: caregiver, dementia, online, and intervention. Articles were first screened based on title, with subsequent analysis of their respective abstracts.\nAfter reading of abstracts, articles that met the following criteria were included: (1) original article, (2) published in Portuguese or English, (3) published in the past 5 years (January 2015 to September 2020) in indexed journals held on the selected databases, (4) studies involving the application of therapeutic group or individual interventions in human subjects online by VC, and (5) studies with interventions whose target population was informal caregivers of persons diagnosed with dementia. Criteria for study exclusion were (1) studies not including VC sessions with informal caregivers of persons with dementia, (2) studies not yet concluded, and (3) review articles, monographs, dissertations, theses, book chapters, or descriptions of intervention protocols.\nThe initial search of the databases led to the retrieval of 414 scientific studies: PubMed (n=165), BIREME\nAyoub MF, et al. Online psychological interventions for caregivers. 3\n(n=125), and Web of Science (n=124). After examination of titles, 70 studies were selected for reading of their respective abstracts. Based on the inclusion criteria, 13 articles were then selected for reading in full. After rejection of articles duplicated among the databases (n=8), five scientific studies were selected for inclusion in the review. A further complementary study was identified from references, giving a total of six articles for inclusion in the present review (Figure 1).\nTwo independent evaluators (first authors of the study) carried out a thorough analysis of the articles selected for full reading in order to appraise the suitability for inclusion in this integrative review of the literature, according to the abovementioned predefined selection criteria. The results of the two analyses by the evaluators were fully concordant on the studies shortlisted for inclusion in the review. The article contents were extracted according to the following categories: (1) author/year, (2) country of origin, (3) methodological design employed (staggered randomized waitlist, single group or with control group, involving both pre- and posttests or posttest only, including focus group or\notherwise), (4) participants who underwent intervention, (5) description of intervention, (6) main findings, and (7) conclusion."

            "text": "Of the six articles included in the review12-17, most were conducted in the United States12,14-17, while one study was carried out in Australia13. With the exception of the study by Moskowitz et\u00a0al.16, in which interventions were delivered individually, all studies12-15,17 involved group-based interventions.\nThe majority of interventions were psychoeducational14-17, while one investigation involved an emotion-support intervention13 and another focused on educational and psychosocial support12. Despite the variability in the types of intervention delivered, all sessions using VC (group or individual) were conducted by an instructor or facilitator for all studies (Table 1).\nOverall, studies showed that interventions by VC in informal caregivers of persons with dementia were feasible, and all programs implemented support measures to assist participants with the use of the technology. These measures included making available devices to access sessions by VC, such as tablets and personal computers12,13,16,17, individual training/guidance12-17, homebased visits to set up the computer software needed to run VC sessions or rectify Internet or hardware issues12, and provision of written instructions14,15,17.\nParticipant retention rates during intervention were high for all studies. More specifically, the study by Moskowitz et\u00a0al.16 (total of participants=170) had a high participation retention rate throughout the interventions for both the experimental group (89.0%) and control group (92.8%). Similarly, only three participants dropped out of the study by Banbury et\u00a0al.13 (total of participants=69), six in the study of Kovaleva et\u00a0al.15 (total of participants=36), seven in Griffiths et\u00a0al.14 (total of participants=64), and only one participant dropped out of the study by Austrom et\u00a0al.12 (total of participants=5). Even better results were reported by Paun and Cothran17,with none of the five participants discontinuing.\nAll the studies showed acceptability of the interventions, as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative results postintervention (Table 1). In this regard, Griffiths et\u00a0al.14 found significant improvement in scores on several measures of mental health of participants at posttest versus pretest (e.g., caregiver burden, depressive symptoms, and self-reported competence). In addition, positive effects were also evident at posttest in care recipients, such as a significant decrease in Figure 1. Flow diagram of literature search.\nAyoub MF, et al. Online psychological interventions for caregivers. 5\nnumber of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) that occurred daily or more often and average BPSD frequency. Moreover, Austrom et\u00a0al.12 also observed posttest improvement on measures of caregiver well-being (e.g., anxiety, depression, physical health, controlling upsetting thoughts, and response to disruptive behavior) (Table 1).\nMoskowitz et\u00a0al.16 noted a significantly greater improvement in scores for positive emotion, depression, anxiety, physical health, and positive aspects of care among participants delivered the intervention individually for regulating emotion (intervention group) versus control subjects (waitlist). The study by Banbury et\u00a0al.13, involving an intervention with socially or geographically isolated informal dementia caregivers, showed that, despite having little prior experience of using VC technology, most participants rated the tool positively. In addition, after completing the intervention, eight groups of carers continued to meet on a self-organized basis (Table 1).\nWith regard to the online modality of interventions, qualitative data from the study by Paun and Cothran17 revealed that the participants experienced no problems emotionally engaging with other participants and felt supported and less guilty about their decision\nto institutionalize family members with dementia. Mirroring these findings, most of the participants of the study by Kovaleva et\u00a0al.15 reported connectedness with the other carers and instructors and preferred the online mode of the program. Furthermore, the feedback given by participants on the intervention in the study of Austrom et\u00a0al.12 were also generally positive, with caregivers appreciative for convenience of being able to take part in the support group remotely (Table 1)."

Ayoub MF, et al.\ndementia caregivers. The study in question16 entailed implementation of a positive emotion regulation program and promoted significantly greater improvement in caregivers\u2019 mental health than that of control subjects (waitlist). However, the authors pointed out that, although delivery individually was likely a factor contributing to the high participant retention rates observed, the strategy is relatively high cost and difficult to reliably replicate on a large scale16. Thus, while individual remote delivery can aid access to participants for intervention implementation and data collection by researchers, group interventions appear to be more feasible than individual interventions.\nWhile the studies reviewed were heterogeneous for some aspects of the interventions (e.g., number of participants, number of sessions, and aims), they were similar in other respects (e.g., target population, use of VC, sessions delivered by instructors/facilitators, and assistance on using the technology). Also, for all studies involving group interventions, these groups were closed, that is, further participants were not included over and above the initial group recruited. This homogeneity across the studies aided the analysis of their respective results.\nOverall, the studies had high rates of retention of participants engaged in the intervention programs. This satisfactory adherence may have been due, in part, to the assistance given to participants on how to access and use the technology adopted, including provision of electronic devices, written instructions, and individual training. In the scientific literature, most previous studies in this field have involved face-to-face interventions, which are indeed the most typical modality employed. Therefore, the help given to participants in using the technology (e.g., VC software) appears to be a key element for success, as highlighted by half of the studies reviewed12,13,17, where caregivers positively rated the help provided on using the technology.\nThe studies reported positive effects on carers who underwent the interventions. The studies in which analyses of quantitative data were carried out12,14,16 confirmed improvements in the quality of life of caregivers, particularly with respect to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and physical health. Qualitative data also revealed the positive effects of interventions: reduced feelings of loneliness and blame17, connectedness among participants15,17, and the establishing of interpersonal networks among isolated caregivers after conclusion of the group intervention.13 Taken together, these results reiterate the potential of online interventions using VC for promoting health gains (physical and mental) and forming connections among participants of group programs.\nSimilarly, a previous review18 also showed that online interventions for caregivers of people with dementia promoted positive effects among caregivers, showing potential to improve well-being. The study also demonstrated that both the direct contact among participants and presence of a professional facilitating the intervention appeared to be key factors favoring the mental health of participants and attainment of the goals of the interventions, respectively. In this respect, all the studies included in this review12-17 involved at least one of these factors, whereas most12-15,17(5/6 articles) involved both. The presence of these factors is believed to have played a role in the positive results found for all the interventions reviewed.\nNotably, only one study16 included a control group for the purposes of comparison against the intervention group. The lack of a control group for the remaining studies in which quantitative analyses were carried out compromised the robustness of the method, precluding the drawing of causal inferences between the independent (intervention) and dependent (e.g., anxiety, depression, and burden) variables assessed. Moreover, none of the studies included or reported results on the follow-up of participants, rendering it impossible to determine whether the postintervention gains persisted over time. A follow-up analysis would have allowed assessment of the potential of interventions to promote long-term effects on caregivers.\nKovaleva et\u00a0al.15 found that the heterogeneity of the care situations among participants was identified by some individuals as a factor hampering a stronger connection with the other participants, while many carers expressed the desire for more information on the specific stages of the disease. The authors concluded that the program groups should be divided according to the profile of participants, for example, by disease stage of the care recipient. This finding suggests future online group psychoeducational interventions should be designed that taken these aspects into account, thereby promoting greater group cohesion and stronger connectedness among participants and allowing the specific needs of each stage to be met.\nOnly one of the studies reviewed12 reported availability of electronic devices and Internet access to all participants. Hence, although online remote synchronous interventions allow participation of a number of caregivers unable to attend sessions in person (e.g., during pandemics or because patient cannot be left alone), this raises questions on the more socioeconomically vulnerable caregivers who do not enjoy access to the Internet or electronic devices required for interventions. Future studies should explore feasible effective\nAyoub MF, et al. Online psychological interventions for caregivers. 7\nways of including these individuals in their intervention programs for dementia caregivers.\nAlthough the studies reviewed confirmed the feasibility and acceptability of online synchronous interventions by VC for caregivers of people with dementia, this review involved a relatively small number of studies (n=6), reducing the potential for generalization of results. Future studies could combine different key words to search a broader set of scientific databases and yield additional studies. Another study limitation was, of those studies incorporating quantitative data measure (n=3), only one employed a control group, reducing the power of results to some extent.\nInvestigations could be conducted that include follow-up of participants to determine whether the benefits promoted by interventions are maintained over"
