1. **Investigate the biosynthetic pathways of understudied polyketides.** Many of the polyketides produced by Aspergillus species have not been fully characterized, and their biosynthetic pathways are unknown. By studying these pathways, researchers can gain a better understanding of how these compounds are made and how they can be modified to create new drugs and other useful products.


2. **Explore the potential of Aspergillus polyketides for use in medicine.** Many Aspergillus polyketides have shown promising biological activities, including anticancer, antibacterial, and antifungal properties. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential of these compounds for use in medicine, including clinical trials to assess their safety and efficacy.


3. **Develop new methods for activating silent polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters.** Many Aspergillus species have silent polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters that are not expressed under normal laboratory conditions. By developing new methods for activating these gene clusters, researchers can access a vast reservoir of novel polyketides with potential therapeutic applications.


4. **Engineer Aspergillus strains to produce novel polyketides.** Once the biosynthetic pathways of Aspergillus polyketides are better understood, researchers can use genetic engineering techniques to modify these pathways to create novel compounds with improved properties. This approach could lead to the development of new drugs and other useful products with enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects.


5. **Investigate the ecological roles of Aspergillus polyketides.** Polyketides play an important role in the ecology of Aspergillus species, helping them to compete with other microorganisms and to adapt to different environments. By studying the ecological roles of polyketides, researchers can gain a better understanding of the complex interactions between Aspergillus species and their environment.
