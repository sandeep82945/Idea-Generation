It was recently shown that the addition of uric (UA) and/or ascorbic acid (AA) to the preservative medium beneficially impacts the storability features of RBCs related to the handling of pro-oxidant triggers. This study constitutes the next step, aiming to examine the links between hemolysis, redox, and metabolic parameters in control and supplemented RBC units of different storage times. For this purpose, a paired correlation analysis of physiological and metabolism parameters was performed between early, middle, and late storage in each subgroup. Strong and repeated correlations were observed throughout storage in most hemolysis parameters, as well as in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, suggesting that these features constitute donor-signatures, unaffected by the diverse storage solutions. Moreover, during storage, a general \u201cdialogue\u201d was observed between parameters of the same category (e.g., cell fragilities and hemolysis or lipid peroxidation and ROS), highlighting their interdependence. In all groups, extracellular antioxidant capacity, proteasomal activity, and glutathione precursors of preceding time points anticorrelated with oxidative stress lesions of upcoming ones. In the case of supplemented units, factors responsible for glutathione synthesis varied proportionally to the levels of glutathione itself. The current findings support that UA and AA addition reroutes the metabolism to induce glutathione production, and additionally provide mechanistic insight and footing to examine novel storage optimization strategies.\nKEYWORDS\nred blood cell, glutathione, oxidative stress, uric acid, ascorbic acid, storage lesion, accelerated aging"

            "text": "Stored red blood cells (RBCs) endure structural and functional/ metabolic deteriorations, collectively known as storage lesion, that are mainly attributed to metabolic decline and redox imbalance and have been found to be linked to the transfusion outcome (Yoshida et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2021). Some lesions concern typical RBC aging indicators, such as oxidative defects, altered cation homeostasis, and spheroechinocytosis (Antonelou et al., 2010; D\u2019Alessandro and Zolla, 2013). At the same time, since the RBC unit represents a closed system, the metabolic and oxidative stresses are intensified during storage (D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2015; Bardyn et al., 2018). For this reason, it is considered that stored RBCs undergo an accelerated senescence process, while the conventional, calendar way of measuring storage age does not seem to reflect their real physiological age (D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2019; Koch et al., 2019).\nRecent studies have shown \u201cheritability\u201d in some erythrocytic features during storage. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified several loci associated with hemolysis (Page et al., 2021; Fang et al., 2022) or metabolism (Moore et al., 2022) of stored RBCs, and similar conclusions also arose from classic twin studies (van \u2019t Erve et al., 2014a; van \u2019t Erve et al., 2014b). Correlation analyses support these findings (Reisz et al., 2017; Tzounakas et al., 2021), and enrich them with inter-correlations, namely, correlations between distinct parameters, either before/during storage, or between different time points of storage (D\u2019Alessandro et al.,\n2021; Thomas et al., 2021; Anastasiadi et al., 2022). Such information has the potential to indicate or hint at how variation in one parameter might affect another, and therefore, lead to a better understanding of the \u201cdialogue\u201d between discrete aspects of RBC life during storage. For instance, Oh et al., have shown that the levels of nitrite oxidation during early storage can partly \u201cpredict\u201d the release of free hemoglobin (Hb) and heme later on (Oh et al., 2015). Along the same lines, it has been suggested that hypoxanthine varies proportionally to hemolysis and echinocytosis (D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2018).\nOptimization of storage conditions and extension of RBC shelflife is still in the spotlight of blood transfusion research. Antioxidant enhancement to deal with the elevated oxidative stress during storage is a common effort to achieve this goal (Amen et al., 2017; Barzegar et al., 2022; Nemkov et al., 2022). Uric (UA) and ascorbic acid (AA) are efficient natural antioxidants, the effect of which upon stored RBCs has been studied both distinctly (Dawson et al., 1980; Raval et al., 2013; Sanford et al., 2017; Tzounakas et al., 2022) and in combination (Bardyn et al., 2020; Tzounakas et al., 2022). A recent study by our team has shown that the addition of the two antioxidants ultimately mitigates oxidative lesions in RBCs, as exemplified by reduced oxidative lysis andmembrane oxidation, and induces glutathione (GSH) synthesis through metabolic rerouting (Tzounakas et al., 2022). nonetheless, it has not been yet shown how the supplementation affects intra- and inter-associations between the levels of physiological and metabolic parameters throughout\nFIGURE 1 Intra-parameter correlations during storage.

A selection of six samples per category provided metabolomic, proteasomal, and immunodetection data.\nBriefly, regarding hemolysis parameters, spontaneously released Hb was measured in the supernatant using Harboe\u2019s method, while the three induced-lysis measurements were spectrophotometrically performed post exposure to (a) descending NaCl concentrations, (b) mechanical stress using stainless steel beads (Raval et al., 2010) and (c) phenylhydrazine (PHZ; 17 mM). The levels of intracellular ROS were fluorometrically assessed using the redox-sensitive probe 5- (and-6)-chloromethyl-2\u2032,7\u2032-dichloro-dihydrofluoresceindiacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) with and without external stimuli (tert-butyl hydroperoxide\u2013tBHP; 100 \u03bcM). Malondialdehyde was detected at 532 nm post formation of a chromogenic complex with thiobarbituric acid (Tzounakas et al., 2022), whereas extracellular antioxidant capacity (total, UA-dependent, and UA-independent) was evaluated via the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay (Benzie and Strain, 1996).\nAfter membrane and cytosol isolation by hypotonic lysis, the two fragments were subjected to incubation with fluorogenic proteasome substrates to measure the three proteasomal activities (chymotrypsin (CH)-, trypsin (TR)- and caspase (CASP)-like) via\nfluorometry (Anastasiadi et al., 2021). The membranes were also immunoblotted for a variety of membrane-binding proteins. Metabolomic analysis was performed in RBCs using an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS), as previously extensively described (Tzounakas et al., 2022)."

Since Pearson\u2019s test is sensitive to outliers, such values were excluded, and the analysis was performed again to minimize false positive correlation results. If the outcome of the analysis was not modified, the outlier was included back in the group. In the case of intraparameter correlations or parameters belonging to the same category (hemolysis, redox, and purine oxidation variables of Figures 1, 2) and presenting interconnections with each other, a Bonferroni-like adjustment was applied to increase the reliability of multiple comparisons.

Especially regarding hemolysis parameters, which are of great clinical importance for transfusion medicine, the possibility to (partly) \u201cpredict\u201d end-ofstorage levels based on early in-bag measurements might prove to be crucial. In Figure 1A the r values shown correspond to the control units, but similar correlations, with slightly different r values, arose in all supplementations (e.g., r values of ROS, day 7 vs. day 21: 0.667, 0.700, and 0.430 for UA-, AA- and mix-supplemented units, respectively; p < 0.05).\nOn the other hand, some intra-parameter correlations were affected in part on in all of the modified units. For example, in control units the levels of total extracellular antioxidant capacity of earlier time points (namely, 7 and 21) were found positively correlated to the ones of advanced time points (namely, 21 and 42); this was maintained in UA- and AA-enhanced units but it was \u201clost\u201d in mix supplementations (Figure 1B). In the same context, intra-correlations were observed in all supplementations between the early and middle levels of distinct parameters of glycolysis (e.g., in UA, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase: r = 0.938; in AA,\nFrontiers in Aging frontiersin.org03\nglycerate 3-phosphate: r = 0.829; in mix, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate: r = 0.943; p < 0.05) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP; Figure 1C), a finding that was absent in control samples. Of note, oxidative hemolysis presented correlation only between its early and middle levels and only in control samples (r = 0.504, p < 0.05). All these intra-parameter correlations point towards the dominance of a donor-signature, that is either universal (in all conditions tested) or revealed under specific storage solutions."

The addition of AA affected the link between the mechanical fragility of preceding periods and hemolysis of advanced time points (Figure 2A). Another differentiation in this crosstalk concerns the correlation between early/middle osmotic fragility and middle/late mechanical fragility, which is mainly evident in units containing UA (Figure 2A). Inter-correlations were also found regarding classic parameters of oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation of early storage presented positive links with ROS accumulation (in all enhancements) and oxidative lysis (in all groups) of the middle time point (Figure 2B). In the case of oxidative lysis, this link was completely lost in late storage values, while the pattern was sporadically maintained regarding ROS accumulation (Figure 2B).

While the end-storage levels of purine metabolites varied proportionally to those of day 21 in controls, this pattern was \u201cmoved\u201d to earlier time points in UA-enhanced units, resulting in correlations between purines of day 7 and day 21 (Figure 2C). It should be noted that while most of these inter-correlations were positive, the levels between xanthosine and metabolites downstream of uric acid were negatively correlated (e.g., allantoate/xanthosine in Figure 2C).

This was also extended between their middle and advanced storage levels. The proteasomal activity of early-storage was also negatively linked to oxidative stress markers of upcoming time points, as in the case of membranic TR-like activity and Hb oligomers (Figure 3B) or cytosolic CASP-like activity and ROS (day 7 vs. day 21: \u22120.840, \u22120.815, \u22120.822 and \u22120.897, r values for controls, UA-, AA- and mix-supplemented units, respectively; p < 0.05).

Moreover, in UA-modified units, early and middle storage folate metabolites (e.g., dihydrofolate) were inversely linked to middle and late storage oxidative markers, respectively, while in AA- and mix-enhanced units, the early levels of GSH precursors (e.g., alanine) were negatively related to late storage oxidative stress (Figure 4B).

            "text": "The maintenance of proportional storage, osmotic and mechanical hemolysis levels, among all time points in every condition tested, suggests that hemolysis is more a function of donor features than of additive solution modifications. According to previous studies, the osmotic fragility of stored RBCs is strongly donor-dependent since it varies proportionally to the circulation levels (Tzounakas et al., 2021), being moderately associated with genes implicated in RBC structure and volume (Page et al., 2021). The undeniable contribution of structural proteins and ion channels to mechanical fragility (Smith et al., 2018; Svetina et al., 2019), leads to the assumption that there is a corresponding donor effect. In the same context, twin studies support that genetic factors contribute substantially to spontaneous hemolysis during storage (Van \u2019t Erve et al., 2015). Overall, in the current study, despite the multiparametric nature of storage hemolysis (Van \u2019t Erve et al., 2015; Reisz et al., 2017), the donor effect prevails inside the blood unit throughout storage.\nThe proportional storage motif of intracellular ROS accumulation and membrane lipid peroxidation is a finding upon which our research team stumbles for the first time, but our previous correlation works mostly focused on pre-storage\u2013storage linkages. Therefore, the new environment, which is dissimilar to the in vivo in terms of redox equilibrium, might be bringing this specific donorsignature to the surface. Interestingly, a recent GWAS revealed a panel of metabolites strongly associated to the variation in genes implicated to RBC redox status, including the repair of oxidativelydamaged lipids (Moore et al., 2022). The fact that the extracellular antioxidant capacity \u2212previously shown to be proportional to the pre-storage levels (Reisz et al., 2017)\u2212 failed to maintain the correlation pattern in the mix-treatments, might be attributed to the excessive enhancement, which led to a \u201cburnout\u201d effect when both antioxidants were added (Tzounakas et al., 2022).\nRegarding metabolic aspects, classic twin studies and GWAS have shown a genetic control of glycolysis and PPP in stored RBCs (van \u2019t Erve et al., 2014b; Weisenhorn et al., 2016; Moore et al., 2022). In our cohort, this donor-signature is lost between the time points of storage in the untreated units. The detrimental effect of storage stresses on energy metabolism (Rogers et al., 2021) seems to prevent the appearance of such correlations. It is known that already by the first 2 weeks of storage, glucose metabolism is rerouted from glycolysis to PPP to counteract oxidative stress, while alterations in band 3 protein -a \u201cswitch\u201d for glucose metabolic flows- hold back its regulatory role in stored RBCs (Messana et al., 2000; D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2015; D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2017b; Issaian et al., 2021). nonetheless, the levels of distinct glycolytic and phosphate pentose metabolites varied proportionally from early to middle storage in supplemented samples, suggesting the achievement of an energy-related metabolic rewiring, as previously reported (Bardyn et al., 2020).\nFrontiers in Aging frontiersin.org07"

            "text": "Several RBC interactome/network analyses in a variety of RBC samples, ranging from distinct genetic backgrounds to stored erythrocytes, point towards the presence of hub nodes of biologically relevant parameters (Goodman et al., 2007; Issaian et al., 2021; Sae-Lee et al., 2022). In a similar context, the currently presented data showed that all types of hemolysis (except for oxidative one) are related to each other, while erythrocytes of high (or low) lipid peroxidation at earlier time points show increased (or decreased) ROS accumulation and oxidative lysis later on, a finding in line with the previously reported link between lipid peroxidation and hemolysis in murine models (Howie et al., 2019).\nThe striking absence of oxidative hemolysis from both intra- and inter-parameter hemolysis correlations, as well as from redox links to its late storage levels, makes room for intriguing explanations. Firstly, it seems that lysis after oxidative stimuli \u201cbelongs\u201d to a different branch of parameters (mostly redox-related) than the ones attributed to corpuscular phenomena, as supported by a recent GWAS (Page et al., 2021). In addition, having in mind that (a) until middlestorage RBCs age in a more \u201cordered\u201d way, at least in terms of energy and redox metabolism (Bordbar et al., 2016; Paglia et al., 2016; D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2017b), and (b) beyond this time point RBCs accumulate more and more defects (Bardyn et al., 2017; Francis et al., 2020; Barshtein et al., 2021), it seems plausible to support that oxidative lysis becomes even more multiparametric at late storage resting its strong interconnection with other variables (including storage hemolysis) (Kanias et al., 2017) difficult. Osmotic and mechanical fragilities are not usually found intercorrelated even though they seem to affect one another (Tan et al., 2010). The steady correlation profile between them in UA-units requires further examination, especially since a similar link has been reported in donors with higher UA-dependent antioxidant capacity (Anastasiadi et al., 2022).\nThe sole addition of UA fueled the intercorrelation of purine metabolites earlier during storage, while at the same time upregulating a significant part of their metabolism (Tzounakas et al., 2022). Such information provides the ability to monitor proportional changes in purine oxidation molecules with the potential to undermine post-transfusion RBC performance such as inosine and hypoxanthine (D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2017a; Nemkov et al., 2018), while the inverse correlation between allantoate and xanthosine seems to support our previous hypothesis, that under these conditions, UA acts on xanthosine rather than on classic stress-biomarkers (hypoxanthine, allantoin) (Kand\u2019ar and Zakova, 2008; Nemkov et al., 2018). Regarding heritability in purines, the storage levels of urate have been linked to the gene of folate receptor (Moore et al., 2022), a finding that seems tomatch the observed alteration of folatemetabolites in UA-supplementations (Tzounakas et al., 2022)."

            "heading": "4.3 GSH metabolism, antioxidants, and proteostasis anticorrelate with oxidation markers",
            "text": "In all groups, RBCs with the equipage to produce GSH seem to be resistant to oxidative defects in the following days of storage. GSH\nis a critical contributor to the RBC redox homeostasis both as a scavenger and as an enzymatic cofactor (Pompella et al., 2003; Galano and Alvarez-Idaboy, 2011), but its levels drop early during storage (Bordbar et al., 2016) impelling scientists to propose the addition of its precursors (or even GSH itself) in the blood units (Dumaswala et al., 2000; Whillier et al., 2011). The observed general correlations, combined with the elevated amounts of some GSH precursors and the diminished oxidative insults in modified units (Tzounakas et al., 2022), strengthen our theory regarding metabolic rerouting to produce GSH and thus, enhance the antioxidant defenses. This observation should be further evaluated, since tracing experiments have shown that stored RBCs present minimal GSH production (Whillier et al., 2011; D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2017b). Nevertheless, the fact that folate intermediates (in UA units) and GSH amino acid precursors (in AA and mix units) of day 7 vary proportionally to middle-storage GSH further reinforces our hypothesis, especially since these distinct route alterations were considered responsible for the impressive GSH levels in the modified units of day 21 (Tzounakas et al., 2022). This is additionally supported by the inverse correlations between GSH precursors/folate metabolites and oxidative stress phenotypes in the supplemented units. It should not be omitted that the superior GSH levels could also be explained by its potentially reduced sequestration by Hb (Fenk et al., 2022) due to the antioxidant intervention.\nAnother general correlation regarding oxidative stress markers was observed with extracellular antioxidant capacity and proteasomal activities of early storage. Donors who possess increased extracellular antioxidant powers have erythrocytes characterized by improved storability profile (Tzounakas et al., 2015), therefore the first association was rather anticipated. On the other hand, proteasome dominates the reported RBC interactomes (Anastasiadi et al., 2021; Sae-Lee et al., 2022) and there are indications that in RBCs it is tasked with decongesting the cell from oxidated proteins and especially Hb (Neelam et al., 2011; Abi Habib et al., 2020). There lies the fact that membranes with increased proteasomal activity are characterized by decreased membrane-bound oxidized Hb later during storage. In modified units, the same correlation additionally existed between middle and late stored RBCs. We can only hypothesize that antioxidant enhancement effectively protected (a) proteins, reducing the levels of over-oxidized protein crosslinks that cannot be processed by the proteasome machinery (Delobel et al., 2012) and (b) the proteasome itself (Delobel et al., 2016), making it more capable of dealing with oxidative stress beyond middle storage. Correspondingly, the binding of the antioxidant prdx2 to the membrane seems to safeguard its components from oxidation (Bayer et al., 2016; M\u00f6ller et al., 2023).\nThe link between membrane-bound IgGs and Hb-binding or membrane oxidation is interesting. IgGs become more abundant in RBC membranes during both in vivo (Magnani et al., 1988) and accelerated (Luten et al., 2004; Kriebardis et al., 2007) aging, due to the appearance of senescence antigens (Dinkla et al., 2012). One of the current theories regarding RBC aging supports that band 3 is \u201ctrapped\u201d in a rare conformation via the binding of IgGs extracellularly and denatured Hb intracellularly, forming a neoantigen (Badior and Casey, 2018). The observed linkage between membrane-bound antibodies and Hb is in line with this \u201cmolecular\nFrontiers in Aging frontiersin.org08\nclock\u201d theory. Only in the modified units, the membrane binding of Hb in early storage was related to oxidative phenomena in later time points. Having in mind that the enhanced blood units were characterized by decreased oxidative stress, this correlation might emerge only in low levels of oxidative lesions that can act as a statistical threshold. In any case, increased binding of denatured Hb to the membrane is a potent oxidation source, that contributes to protein defects, lipid peroxidation, and membrane/cytoskeleton integrity (Alayash, 2022)."

Moreover, they provide supporting information regarding donorsignatures, including RBC fragility and intracellular ROS, the intraassociation of which during storage is not affected by the different additive solutions, as well as hints about intervention targets to optimize storage conditions. A very promising example is proteasomal activity, the upregulation of which could differentiate the proteostasis network of stored RBCs to cope better with the oxidative insults in blood bank conditions. Whether such a hypothesis will prove to be fruitful remains to be determined by future studies."
