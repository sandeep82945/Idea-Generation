    "abstractText": "Nowadays, research on electric drive control has become popular because hybrid methods to collect the advantages of individual controllers. Moreover, these methods aim to reach better performance and robust control even in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances which are typically evident in high-speed dynamics where the influence of external disturbances and modeling errors are more evident. Therefore, in this paper, a novel hybrid controller is proposed between the super-twisting algorithm based on high order design (HO-STA) and terminal sliding mode control (T-SMC) applied on a permanent magnet synchronous motor PMSM. Whereas, it accounts to deal with the weaknesses of both terminal sliding mode control and super twisting algorithm (STA) and at the same time combining their advantages; furthermore, it provides exceptional characteristics, including fast finite-time convergence, stabilization of the performance and its reaching law developer based on new design which contributes to reducing the chattering problems afflicted by C-SMC. This proposed hybrid technique contributes to gaining robust control under variation between slow, medium, and high speed levels, no matter what load torque is applied or whatever PMSM parameters change. Moreover, it also offers optimum performance characteristics such as smaller settling time and steady state error. Whereas, the control efficiency is demonstrated by Matlab/Simulink simulation to confirm our design parameters.",

            "text": "Many various areas such as electric vehicles, aerospace, numerical control systems, and wind power generation are highly dependent on the permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) due to small volume, light weight, high efficiency, high power factor, fast response, wide speed range, and good accuracy [1\u20134].\nDespite its dominance over the other electrical machines like induction motor and its supremacy in actuation performance as mentioned above, it is a non-linear model, strongly coupled, and multivariable [5, 6].\nTraditional controllers have been applied like FOC, which depends on the PI regulator, but they aren't effective for a high-performance control when external system\ndisturbance, uncertainties, or variation of speed levels is required [7\u201310].\nThe researchers are focused on advanced controls, where each technique depends either on nonlinearity, optimization, robustness method like backstepping, adaptive, sliding mode, feedback linearization, passivity-based, optimal, and intelligent techniques to name few [11\u201314]. Furthermore, the conventional sliding mode technique is one of the most important techniques that have been successfully applied to the PMSM system because of its fast dynamic response, easy implementation, and its robustness in the high-performance control as mentioned above [15, 16].\nDespite these features of the sliding control, it suffers from the problem of chattering because of time delay and space lag of the switch, the error of the state detection, and other factors when applied to the actual system [17, 18].\nSeveral researchers have tried reducing this problem by proposing several ways based on SMC methods, for example, in the articles [19\u201322], the researchers developed a sliding mode control to use exponential switching law and sigmoid function.\nAlthough, it effectively contributed to the suppression of chattering in the slipping position, it is the convergence stability of the system, which is reduced to a certain extent, and there performance better against the sliding mode chattering and switching performance and robustness due to the sigmoid function and the exponential reaching law respectively.\nThe articles [23\u201326] contributed to reducing the steadystate error, the fast response time of the PMSM performance, and robustness to external disturbances like load torque variation and applied the integration of state variables into the conventional sliding mode surface to use integral sliding mode surface.\nBut the addition of the integral on the surface leads to a large overshoot, which affects the quality of the controller because it produces integral saturation of the integral sliding mode surface.\nThe articles [1, 27\u201329] used a terminal sliding mode control, which affords remarkable characteristics, including fast and finite-time convergence, however, since the convergence time is relatively long and the dynamic properties are worsen when the state of the system is far from the equilibrium point.\nSome other researchers solved the problems mentioned above by proposing a hybrid technique between the sliding mode control and other advanced technique like adaptive, intelligent, or optimal control.\nArticle [30] proposed a new design control between the sliding mode control based on the exponential reaching law and the passivity-based control. In their design, SMC is applied on the speed loop, while the passivity-based control is applied on the d-q currents loop.\nAlthough, this hybrid controller performs better than a classical SMC, it does not significantly improve the performance characteristics, as undershoot appeared on the speed performance during disturbance and uncertainties. Article [31] proposed a new design of high order based on a super twisting algorithm (NSTA) applied on the speed\nloop and leave classical control (FOC) applied on the currents loop, where a proportional term along with an adaptive term is used in addition to the original of NSTA.\nThis proposed controller contributed to solving low reaching speed, and poor anti-disturbance ability due to the square root calculation of proportional term in the original super twisting algorithm. However, the problem of overshoot and undershoot is a concern when applying at high speed or applying torque with increased steadystate error. In addition, the uncertainties like resistance will impede the performance and stability of the motor due to the application of classical control (FOC) on the current loop.\nArticle [32\u201335] used a hybrid technique between the terminal sliding mode and backstepping control to achieve speed regulation despite uncertainties and disturbances, this latter contributed to giving a relatively robust control and stabilizing the steady state error. However, the phenomenon of chattering, overshoot and undershoot are present during the change of speed and during the application of the torque.\nOther articles suggested some new super-twisting sliding mode based on intelligent proportional-integral control [36], adaptive control based on a super-twisting sliding mode [37], sliding mode control based on the fractionalorder method [38, 39], sliding mode based on intelligent control [40, 41], and hybrid control composed of adaptive, sliding mode and intelligent control [42, 43]. However, optimizing more performance characteristics of PMSM and applying robust control to achieve high-performance, robust to uncertainties, and external disturbances remain the researchers' main challenge.\nTo overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a High-order super-twisting algorithm based terminal sliding mode control (HO-STA based T-SMC) applied on the speed loop and the exponential reaching law based sliding mode control applied on the current loop. This hybrid design is found to exhibit improved speed performance characteristics and gives a robust control for the hardest sceneries as discussed above. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2, the modeling of the PMSM is shown. In Section 3, the design of hybrid control is proposed. In Section 4, simulation results and discussion are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Some conclusions are drawn in Section 5."

Fig. 3 and Table 2 show the region (a) presented in Fig. 2, where it presents speed performance of the PMSM during the start-up low speed (200 rpm) with a comparative study among the techniques mentioned above, where the HO-STA based T-SMC has the least settling time approx. to 4 ms, and smallest steady-state error.\nFig. 4 and Table 2 show the region (b) presented in Fig. 2, it gives the second level of the speed performance, which is characterized by the medium speed of the PMSM to 600 rpm. Despite this, the HO-STA based T-SMC\nmaintains its durability under the change of speed from low to medium in terms of the lowest percentage change for each lower settling time and the steady-state error.\nFig. 5 and Table 2 show the region (c) presented in Fig. 2, where it shows a changing the speed to the third level, which represents the highest speed of the performance to 1000 rpm, even with this variation suddenly in PMSM speed from medium speed to high speed, the proposed control maintains superior durability to the characteristics of the PMSM compared to STA-SMC and T-SMC.\nIn order to achieve the robustness of the proposed control under the influence of uncertainties, the change of PMSM parameters which are resistance and inertia to increasing rates was studied.\nFig. 6 shows this scenario, where the PMSM parameters are changed to 0%, 50%, 100%, 150% and 200% with apply a medium speed; moreover, the proposed control and STA-SMC and T-SMC are compared.\nTo clarify the change in the performance of the PMSM characteristics in light of the change of parameters in the above-mentioned ratios, the regions (a) and (b) of Fig. 6 are detailed in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 respectively. Fig. 7 and Table 3 are presented the rate uncertainty change in the settling time to each control, as the proposed control takes the lowest rate of uncertainty change, which is estimated to 0.03 step among each the percentage of parameters variation mentioned above.\nFig. 8 and Table 3 are presented the rate of steadystate error change to each control during the parameters variation of the aforementioned ratios; however, the proposed control keep also characterized by the lowest rate of steady-state error change. With the rates of change presented by this scenario; therefore, the proposed control takes preference over the robustness of the control.\nThe most important problems that affect performance are external disturbances which were addressed by both controls T-SMC then STA-SMC, which were applied by a lot of research; however, there appear on the level of the speed performance some overshoot or undershoot peaks with there remains a steady state error; to reduce\nthese peaks and the steady state error, this technique was proposed HO-STA based T-SMC, which contributes to improving the speed performance significantly compared to the aforementioned controls.\nWherefore, Fig. 9 shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique under the effect of the external disturbance, where the latter was represented by an applied load torque at different times with its value is 1 Nm with keeping the medium speed. The regions (a), (b) and (c) of Fig. 9 are detailed in Figs. 10, 11 and 12 respectively.\nFig. 10 and Table 4 are presented a comparative study with regard to the settling time among the proposed technique and the aforementioned controls; through these results, the proposed technique remains better compared to other controls in terms of settling time, which is estimated at 6.1 ms. Fig. 11 and Table 4 show the efficiency advantage of the\nproposed control compared to other controls, where during load torque applied on the PMSM, where the undershoot for the proposed control is almost three times less compared to HO-STA and six times less compared to T-SMC; moreover, its undershoot takes a period of 1 ms and represented the least estimated compared the other controls the above-mentioned.\nFig. 12 and Table 4 give a comparison of the steady state error among each studied control; also, the proposed\nTable 4 Performance characteristics of speed model under PMSM's external disturbance\nPerformance characteristics HO-STA based T-SMC STA-SMC T-SMC\nSettling time (ms) 6.1 9.3 14\nSteady-state error (%) 0.01 0.03 0.045\nUndershoot (%) 0.15 0.4 1\nUndershoot period (ms) 1 1.2 1.8\ncontrol contributed to reducing the steady-state error by three times compared to the STA-SMC, and by four and half times compared to the T-SMC, where its steady state error is estimated to be 0.01%."
