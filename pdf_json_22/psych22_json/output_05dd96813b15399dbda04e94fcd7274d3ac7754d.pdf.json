Researchers in the past discussed the psychological issue like stress, anxiety, depression, phobias on various forms, and cognitive issues (e.g., positive thinking) together with personality traits on traditional research methodologies. These psychological issues vary from one human to other human based on different personality traits. In this paper, we discussed both psychological issues together with personality traits for predicting the best human capital that is mentally healthy and strong. In this research, we replace the traditional methods of research used in the past for judging the mental health of the society, with the latest artificial intelligence techniques to predict these components for attaining the best human capital. In the past, researchers have point out major flaws in predicting psychological issue and addressing a right solution to the human resource working in organizations of the world. In order to give solution to these issues, we used five different psychological issues pertinent to human beings for accurate prediction of human resource personality that effect the overall performance of the employee. In this regard, a sample of 500 data has been collected to train and test on computer through python for selecting the best model that will outperform all the other models. We used supervised AI techniques like support vector machine linear, support vector machine radial basis function, decision tree model, logistic regression, and neural networks. Results proved that psychological issue data from employee of different organizations are better means for predicting the overall performance based on personality traits than using either of them alone. Overall, the novel traditional techniques predicted that sustainable organization is always subject to the control of psychological illness and polishing the personality traits of their human capital."

It started from using neural networks [1] to using supervised artificial intelligence techniques in 2020 by [2] psychological issue and personality trait indicators [3]. In Pakistan, researchers have predicted psychological and personality trait issues by using traditional statistical techniques, but no work is being done using artificial intelligence techniques."

            "text": "Humans are different from each other because personality is a combination of feelings, experience, thoughts, and emotions. It also specifies how one should interact with various individuals in various situations. Some people behave differently in the same situation because their personality is made up of multiple traits. Personality predicts our conduct and has a significant influence on our decision-making abilities. The variance in decision-making sense from person to person is simply due to personality [4]. It is difficult to predict human behavior as it varies from time to time and situation to situation, and personality is not fully exposed and understood. Every individual behavior differs from the other, like their decision because of the different personality they possess. The behavior of investors is the result of their attitudes, personalities, norms values, and other factors such as level of motivation [4]. All these factors become the cause of irrational decision-making. Previously, various studies have been conducted in order to examine the factors that influence individuals\u2019 financial and investment decisions. Out of the many factors, personality type is also a factor that influences financial and investment decision. However, financial or investment decisions at the level of individuals need to be generated by the conscious understanding of the individual\u2019s level of motivation, personality traits, and other psychological factors. The lack of understanding of these factors may lead to irrational financial and investment decisions. Along with this, the financial advisor also needs to understand the workings of these cognitive factors to reach a critically informed decision. The literature in the relevant field highlights the needs to focus on the proposition that psychological factors play an important role in the decision-making processes. However, different techniques have been used for predicting the personality issues and psychological issues as the following: discriminant analysis is a statistical technique that is used to recognize the relationship between dependent variables and one or more independent variables. The primary difference between regression analysis and multiple discriminant analysis is that in regression analysis, dependent variable is a continuous variable, while discriminant analysis deals with categorical dependent variable [5,\n6]. Moreover, using logistic regression differs with linear regression analysis in the use of dependent variable as logistic regression deals in dichotomous dependent variable [7]. In traditional statistical techniques used for predicting psychological issues, logit models also had a prominent place. Hence, the overall discussion about the machine learning is the science and art of programming computers so that they can comprehend patterns in data and develop algorithms for future prediction of data [8]. Patterns in data are identified by software, and an algorithm is developed. After that, algorithm is used for prediction on the basis of previously identified pattern in data. Supervised technique is a subpart of artificial intelligence and is specifically under the category of machine learning. As its name indicates, machine is made to learn under supervision. It means that a computer algorithm is constructed on the basis of training by input data that is being labelled for a specific output. In this way, computer learns the underlying similarities in data and recognizes relationships among the input data that is being used to train the machine. This training data set is a foundation for algorithm development, so this training data set should be well balanced and contains all such readings that are true representative of that data. To test its usefulness, a test data set is fed into that algorithm that results in measuring its accuracy [9]."

Costa and McCrae provide the big five model of personality, which includes extraversion (extremely chatty, lively), neuroticism (depressed, gloomy), conscientiousness (very organized), openness to experience (very creative), and agreeableness (kind and generous). In the literature, the authors used a questionnaire based on personality which supports the five-factor model [10]. Those who are well organized and highly creative and easily think and understand ideas and information are good in managing personal financial matters and investment decisions. Openness to experience, one of the dimensions of the big five model, contains both creative and thoughtful expressions. Another important dimension of this model also puts the impact on the investment decision, i.e., conscientiousness in which great efforts for expertise and achievements are involved [10]."

Talking about extraversion is a trait that signifies individual variances in a social meeting, confidence, and energy level. Individuals who are highly extraverted relish socializing with others, while expressing themselves in a group situation, they are easily comfortable and frequently show a positive attitude by expressing emotions such as eagerness and excitement [11]. Along with the previous trait, agreeableness is a trait of personality that is based on the concept where variances\nRE TR AC TE D\nin empathy, respectfulness, and acceptance of others are captured by agreeableness. Agreeable persons are highly sensitive towards other\u2019s happiness, treat others very well for their personal privileges and preferences, and always think positive about others. Displeasing individuals tend to have less respect for others and social standards of graciousness [11]. Moreover, conscientiousness also signifies variances in organization, productiveness and accountability, command, and structure followed by a highly conscientious person. They work determinedly to achieve their objectives, and they are highly committed while fulfilling their responsibility and compulsion, whereas unconscientious persons are easy to go with the disorder and are less motivated to complete tasks [11]. In addition, it is also observed that Neuroticism is also changes due to intensity of negative emotions. Highly neurotic persons are more inclined to anxiety, sorrow, and mood swings, and they are emotionally unstable [11]. And the last one is openness to experience where variances in intellectual curiosity, artistic sensitivity, and imagination are indicated by openness to experience. Highly open individuals are more creative and enjoy thinking and learning; they are art and beauty conscious and create innovative ideas. Close-minded people tend to have a narrow series of rational and creative interests [11]."

In order to find the psychological issues and personality traits of successful human being for improving the overall performance, a study was conducted in the USA in which they used psychological issues and personality traits as independent variables and performance as the dependent variable. It was found that psychological issues (stress, anxiety, depression, phobias on various forms, and cognitive issues) and personality traits (conscientiousness, openness to experience, and extroverts) are highly skilled, or we can say that they are overconfident in their skills. On the other hand, neuroticism and openness to experience look towards more returns. Openness to experience\nand neuroticism were found more in successful investors. A neural network is a series of algorithms that aspires to acknowledge underlying relationships in a data set through a procedure that imitates the way human brain operates. Researchers in the past used neural network technique for psychological issue prediction [12]. In this regard, neural network approach has been introduced to discriminant analysis for predicting human psychological issue that leads to organizational performance. Researchers compared the results with linear classifier, logistic regression, KNN, and ID3 and found it to be an accurate method of measurement. Moreover, according to [13], results of psychological issue model constructed by neural networks outperformed model constructed by multiple discriminant analysis. Keeping the above discussion, the authors will suppose the following hypothesis for testing and contribution.\nHypothesis 1a. Predicting psychological issues through neural network algorithm outperforms all the other technique used in this study.\nHypothesis 1b. Predicting personality traits through neural network algorithm outperforms all the other technique used in this study.\n6.2. Predicting Psychological Issues and Personality Traits through Decision Tree Model. The literature is saturated with many findings that discover statistical association among psychiatric difficulties, big 5 personality traits, and risktaking attitude in preadolescents. Using multiple regression using questionnaires as data, it was discovered that extroverts and openness to experience are strongly associated with risk-taking attitudes, whereas conscientiousness, neuroticism, and agreeableness cannot predict risk-taking attitudes. Thus, this study found that a higher level of extroverts and openness to experience, as well as a lower level of conscientiousness, is associated with a higher level of risk-taking attitude. As discussed in previous lines with a traditional methods, researcher\u2019s also used the decision tree model. So here, the decision tree model is a type of arithmetical calculation in which algorithms are build and those algorithms are said to be decision tree models in which inquiries and examinations are done in a calculative manner so that they may aid in holding subsequent tests. [14] used decision tree model for psychological test and organization risk measurement and got 91.2% accuracy result. Similarly, [15] also trains and tests the personality traits and psychological issue data to predict psychological issue indicators using random forest decision tree and obtains 90% average prediction accuracy. Thus, keeping the above discussion as a benchmark, the research develops and assumed the following hypothesis to work on.\nHypothesis 2a. Predicting psychological issues through decision tree algorithm outperforms all the other technique used in this study.\nRE TR AC TE D\nHypothesis 2b.

For instance, by using multiple regression, it was discovered that personality trait influences financial risk tolerance to some extent. It also pushes an impact on individual investment decisions. So the investment advisors should first study an individual\u2019s personality trait and risk tolerance level. Also, the government should take measures to reduce risk tolerance [16]. The most recent research on psychological disorders and personality traits is based on machine learning algorithms such as genetic algorithms, a type of modifying algorithm that uses natural progression strategies to solve generic problems. The genetic algorithms are projected in binary strings. However, this is not the sole form; depending on the issue being deployed, it can also be provided in alternative ways [17]. Furthermore, in the past, researchers presented genetic algorithms for psychological issue prediction and modeling. As a result of the above discussion, the following hypothesis will be trained and evaluated using Python [18].\nHypothesis 3a. Predicting psychological issues through genetic algorithms outperforms all the other technique used in this study.\nHypothesis 3b. Predicting personality traits through genetic algorithms outperforms all the other technique used in this study.\n6.4. Predicting Psychological Issues and Personality Traits through Support Vector Machines. On a sample of 300, primary research was conducted to study the influence of personality on socially responsible regression analysis and reliability test. They discovered that agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness to agreeableness control financial decisions in regard to socially responsible investment [19]. Support vector machines are supervised learning models with related learning algorithms that examine data for classification and regression analysis in machine learning. Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues created it in 1974 at AT&T Bell laboratories. Several researchers conducted psychological problem prediction using support vector machines [20, 21] and discovered that it was suitable for measuring patterns in data. The authors believe the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis 4a. Predicting psychological issues through support vector machine algorithm outperforms all the other technique used in this study.\nHypothesis 4b. Predicting personality traits through support vector machine algorithm outperforms all the other technique used in this study."

In this cross-sectional data, we used questionnaires as a data gathering instrument that require less expertise [24], and responses were captured using 5-point Likert scales. The target population is normally associated with the total number of individuals living in a particular country [25]. Therefore, in our study, target population is all literate individuals from nonfinancial companies in Pakistan.

The following are the results of evaluation of personality trait model built using neuroticism, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and openness to experience. In Table 3, the prediction accuracy rates for psychological issue model have quite stark difference in their rates.

The model developed using the combined data of both psychological issue and personality trait indicators outperformed the model developed using either psychological issue data individual or personality trait indicators for prediction. The model is predicted using five (5) psychological issue indicators and five personality trait indicators. The supervised artificial intelligence techniques used in this study are support vector machine, SVM RBF, logistic regression, decision tree model, and artificial neural networks. The percentage of accuracy of model increased up to 96.4% that makes it an outstanding model for prediction. Using alone psychological issue indicators for prediction displayed dismal results. Our results are in consensus with the study conducted in Taiwan [26], but contrary to research conducted in the USA [2]. Artificial neural networks are deemed to be the best performing technique among other supervised techniques as it has highest accuracy rate and least error rate. This model with positive results would serve as a beacon of light for initiating artificial intelligence in the field of human resource for uplifting the best human capital of Pakistan. To broaden its scope and verify its results, this research can also be conducted on other similar capacity countries to authenticate its results further or identify changes in results in relation to different markets and understanding this variation in relation to them.
