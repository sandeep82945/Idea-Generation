    "abstractText": "Photoredox catalysis has emerged as an alternative to classical cross-coupling reactions, promoting new reactivities. Recently, the use of widely abundant alcohols and aryl bromides as coupling reagents was demonstrated to promote efficient coupling through the Ir/Ni dual photoredox catalytic cycle. However, the mechanism underlying this transformation is still unexplored, and here we report a comprehensive computational study of the catalytic cycle. We have shown that nickel catalysts can promote this reactivity very efficiently through DFT calculations. Two different mechanistic scenarios were explored, suggesting that two catalytic cycles operate simultaneously depending on the concentration of the alkyl radical.",

            "text": "Carbon\u2013carbon cross-coupling reactions are one of the most prominent synthetic transformations in organic synthesis, and have a continued and increasing impact in both academia and industry [1\u20134]. Since their founding in 1970s [5], the development and extensive application of these reactions are historically attributable to the key role of palladium as a universal catalyst in the various steps of a wide number of strategies such as Heck reactions or Buchwald-Hartwig couplings [6]. However, the high cost and limited availability of palladium are critical challenges that require modifications in the catalytic systems, the most significant of which is the substitution of Pd by other alternative transition metals. In this context, the introduction of non-toxic and earth-abundant metals such as nickel has led to the discovery of new Ni-catalyzed reactions [7], where inactivated organic molecules (alkenes, dienes, alkynes, etc.) become powerful coupling partners [8]. Moreover, the exceptional reactivity of nickel due to its multiple oxidation states (Ni0, NiI, NiII, NiIII, and NiIV) [9] compared to the most common oxidation states in Pd (Pd0/PdII, PdII/PdIV) enables the Single Electron Transfer (SET) processes under suitable reaction conditions, expanding its chemistry to new limits. Thus, the combination of photoredox/metal dual-catalyzed reactions where radicals are generated via SET by the excited photocatalyst paved the way for the extension of the chemical space using milder reaction conditions and even removing the required prefuncionalization steps in the traditional approach [10,11]. Using this methodology, an extensive variety of radical precursors, including alkyl halides [12], carboxylic acids [13], silicates [14], trifluoroborates [15], oxalates [16], and even sp3-hybridized C-H substrates via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) have gradually witnessed its implementation in modern dual photoredox/nickel catalytic systems [17,18]. Within this framework, MacMillan and co-workers recently reported an unprecedented metal catalyzed cross-coupling methodology involving a dual Ni/Ir photoredox catalytic cycle starting from primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols (Figure 1A) [19].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9145. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24119145 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9145 2 of 9\nThis strategy grants straightforward access to a wide range of C-C scaffolds using aryl halides as coupling partners. More significantly, this method allows the activation of unreactive C(sp3)-OH substrates without requiring previous steps when commercially available N-heterocyclic carbene salts (NHC) are used. This transformation is based on two metal catalytic cycles. To begin with, the activation of alcohol substrates using NHC salts, producing a key alcohol-NHC adduct, leads to the formation of open-shell intermediates via the Ir-photocatalytic cycle (Figure 1B). At this point, the second step of the mechanism involves a nickel-catalyzed system in which Ni0 undergoes oxidative addition to an aryl bromide to form an aryl NiII species. Subsequently, the alkyl radical provided by the Ir-catalytic cycle is trapped, yielding NiIII species. Finally, reductive elimination occurs, delivering the deoxygenative arylation product and completing both the photoredox and nickel catalytic cycles (Figure 1B).\nInt.\u00a0J.\u00a0Mol.\u00a0Sci.\u00a02023,\u00a024,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 2\u00a0 of\u00a0 9\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nWithin\u00a0 this\u00a0 framework,\u00a0MacMillan\u00a0and\u00a0 co\u2010workers\u00a0 recently\u00a0 reported\u00a0an\u00a0unprece\u2010 dented\u00a0metal\u00a0catalyzed\u00a0cross\u2010coupling\u00a0methodology\u00a0involving\u00a0a\u00a0dual\u00a0Ni/Ir\u00a0photoredox\u00a0 catalytic\u00a0cycle\u00a0starting\u00a0 from\u00a0primary,\u00a0secondary,\u00a0and\u00a0 tertiary\u00a0alcohols\u00a0(Figure\u00a01A)\u00a0 [19].\u00a0 This\u00a0strategy\u00a0grants\u00a0straightforward\u00a0access\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0wide\u00a0range\u00a0of\u00a0C\u2010C\u00a0scaffolds\u00a0using\u00a0aryl\u00a0 halides\u00a0as\u00a0coupling\u00a0partners.\u00a0More\u00a0significantly,\u00a0this\u00a0method\u00a0allows\u00a0the\u00a0activation\u00a0of\u00a0un\u2010 reactive\u00a0C(sp3)\u2010OH\u00a0substrates\u00a0without\u00a0requiring\u00a0previous\u00a0steps\u00a0when\u00a0commercially\u00a0avail\u2010 able\u00a0N\u2010heterocyclic\u00a0carbene\u00a0salts\u00a0(NHC)\u00a0are\u00a0used.\u00a0This\u00a0transformation\u00a0 is\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0 two\u00a0 metal\u00a0catalytic\u00a0cycles.\u00a0To\u00a0begin\u00a0with,\u00a0the\u00a0activation\u00a0of\u00a0alcohol\u00a0substrates\u00a0using\u00a0NHC\u00a0salts,\u00a0 producing\u00a0a\u00a0key\u00a0alcohol\u2010NHC\u00a0adduct,\u00a0leads\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0open\u2010shell\u00a0intermediates\u00a0 via\u00a0the\u00a0Ir\u2010photocatalytic\u00a0cycle\u00a0(Figure\u00a01B).\u00a0At\u00a0this\u00a0p int,\u00a0th \u00a0second\u00a0step\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0mechanism\u00a0 involves\u00a0a\u00a0nickel\u2010catalyzed\u00a0system\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0Ni0\u00a0undergoes\u00a0oxidative\u00a0addition\u00a0to\u00a0an\u00a0aryl\u00a0 bromide\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0an\u00a0aryl\u00a0NiII\u00a0species.\u00a0Subsequently,\u00a0the\u00a0alkyl\u00a0radical\u00a0provided\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0Ir\u2010 catalytic\u00a0cycle\u00a0is\u00a0trapped,\u00a0yielding\u00a0NiIII\u00a0species.\u00a0Finally,\u00a0reductive\u00a0elimination\u00a0occurs,\u00a0de\u2010 livering\u00a0the\u00a0deoxygenative\u00a0arylation\u00a0product\u00a0and\u00a0completing\u00a0both\u00a0the\u00a0photoredox\u00a0and\u00a0 i el\u00a0catalytic\u00a0 ycles\u00a0(Figure\u00a01B).\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a01.\u00a0(A):\u00a0Specific\u00a0reaction\u00a0conditions\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0MacMillan\u00a0and\u00a0co\u2010workers.[19]\u00a0(B):\u00a0Simpli\u2010 fied\u00a0 scheme\u00a0 of\u00a0metallaphotoredox\u2010enabled\u00a0 deoxygenative\u00a0 arylation\u00a0 of\u00a0 alcohols.\u00a0 (C):\u00a0 Proposed\u00a0 nickel\u00a0catalyzed\u00a0mechanisms\u00a0explored\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0study.\u00a0\nDespite\u00a0 the\u00a0persistent\u00a0 interest\u00a0 in\u00a0nickel\u2010catalyzed\u00a0methodologies\u00a0over\u00a0 the\u00a0 last\u00a0 few\u00a0 decades,\u00a0their\u00a0understanding\u00a0at\u00a0 the\u00a0molecular\u00a0 level\u00a0 is\u00a0still\u00a0underdeveloped.\u00a0Unlike\u00a0the\u00a0\ni ure 1.

Sci. 2023, 24, 9145 3 of 9\nDespite the persistent interest in nickel-catalyzed methodologies over the last few decades, their understanding at the molecular level is still underdeveloped. Unlike the successful computational and experimental characterization of Pd-catalyzed systems [20,21], dual nickel/photoredox catalytic systems contain an inherent complexity that hampers a general understanding of the chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of a great number of protocols. To address this issue, DFT (Density Functional Theory) computational studies have emerged as a reliable tool to shed light on nickel chemistry mechanisms, and we have particularly focused our attention on the flexibility of Ni oxidation states along different reaction mechanisms [22,23]. In this line, the pioneering work by Molander, Kozlowski, and co-workers [24] focused on describing in detail a dual nickel/photoredox catalytic cycle and served as inspiration for further work in this field [25]. Herein, we aim to conduct a comprehensive DFT analysis of the nickel-catalyzed cross coupling of alkyl radicals and aryl bromides reported by MacMillan and co-workers, complementing our initial mechanistic study of alkyl radical generation from alcohols and NHC salts [26]. This DFT study brings up two distinct Ni-catalyzed alternatives, differing on the step where the alkyl radical is trapped by the Ni complex (NiII vs. NiI) (Figure 1C). This transformation involving a variety of nickel oxidation states will provide valuable insight into organonickel chemistry."

            "text": "We initially hypothesized a mechanistic scenario in which the Ni0 first engages the aryl bromide in the oxidative addition, leading to a NiII complex. Subsequently, trapping of the alkyl radical provided by the Ir-photocatalytic cycle produces the key NiIII intermediate, which ultimately delivers the deoxigenative arylation product via reductive elimination (Figure 1C, Proposal A). In addition, we also explored the alternative reaction between the aryl bromide and the NiI complex, generated upon Ni0 trapping of the alkyl radical, to afford the same NiIII complex (Figure 1C, Proposal B). Once the product is formed, the reduction of NiI to Ni0 takes place through SET by the reduced IrII photocatalyst. In the following sections, a more detailed explanation of the complete Ni-catalytic cycle considering the two alternative mechanisms is described. We first present the initial part of both mechanisms involving Ni0 oxidation to NiIII (Section 2.1) and then the reductive elimination step (Section 2.2)."

            "text": "We began our investigation by exploring a suitable Ni0 complex as the starting point for both mechanistic proposals. Thus, the Ni0 complex could display a coordination number of 3 featuring a trigonal planar geometry or a coordination number of 4 with a square planar geometry. In view of these alternatives, we have studied seven possible starting active Ni0 complexes (Figure 2). After analyzing this set of potential Ni0 active species, we noticed that compound F was clearly the most stable structure, and we set it as our starting point for the nickel catalytic cycle (\u221248.3 kcal/mol). In addition, product coordination is weaker (\u221238.7 kcal/mol), so there is no inhibition of the catalyst upon completion of the catalytic cycle.\n2.1.1. Mechanism A: Aryl Bromide Oxidative Addition to Ni0 and Radical Trapping\nThe reaction mechanism begins with the oxidative addition of F to yield a NiII complex. As shown in Figure 3, I, this transformation could occur through three distinct pathways: concerted (a), SN2 (b), and via halide abstraction (c). Regarding the concerted mechanism C, the Csp2-Br bond is cleaved while the Ni-C as well as the Ni-Br bonds are formed. Otherwise, in the SN2 transformation (pathway b), the aryl halide forms a C-Ni bond at the expense of the Csp2-Br bond cleavage. Finally, the halide abstraction mechanism (pathway c) is based on the Single Electron Transfer of the Ni0 to the \u03c3* Br-Csp2 orbital, resulting in a NiI-Br complex and an aryl radical that can undergo recombination to give 3. According to DFT calculations, the oxidative addition proceeds easily through a SN2 mechanism as it features a readily accessible transition state (TS1-2, 9.3 kcal/mol). In contrast, a concerted\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9145 4 of 9\nmechanism could not be found as bromide always went away from the Ni center. In addition, the halide abstraction pathway exhibits a very high barrier, so it can be discarded. Thus, surmounting TS1-2 leads to the formation of the cationic intermediate 2, which is slightly endergonic and can finally trap the bromide ligand and form the square planar NiII species 3 (\u221232.2 kcal/mol), a common configuration for d8 metals. Once the oxidative addition step was computed, we next evaluated the subsequent transformation consisting of the alkyl radical trapping step. In this way, we envisioned that the alkyl radical could approach the NiII complex from an axial position, thus minimizing the steric clash between the radical and the NiII planar geometry (TS3-4, \u221222.8 kcal/mol). The structure of this transition state presents a Ni-Csp3 bond distance of 2.76 \u00c5 and an angle of 104.8\u00ba regarding the Csp3-Ni-Br atoms. However, upon coordination of the alkyl radical, the Ni-Csp3 bond distance decreases to 1.97 \u00c5, and the angle changes to 169.2\u00ba, causing the reorientation of the bromine atom to an axial position. We next examined the coordinated isomers of complex 4 to find two different isomers with square pyramidal molecular geometry. In these cases (5, \u221231.1 kcal/mol and 6, \u221233.3 kcal/mol), one pyridine ring occupies the axial position due to the weaker coordination with nitrogen.

Mechanism B: Radical Trapping and Aryl Bromide Oxidative Addition to Ni0\nAlternatively, we explored the radical trapping of Ni0 in the resting state. This mechanistic pathway (Figure 3B) begins with barrierless alkyl radical trapping in order to yield the adduct 8 (\u221215.8 kcal/mol). The subsequent smooth and endergonic reorganization of 8 leads to the formation of the intermediate 9 (\u22126.9 kcal/mol). At this point, we studied the oxidative addition, and we found the transition state structure TS9-4, where alkyl is located in an axial position, leaving the equatorial position available for the bromine atom (4.9 kcal/mol), which can take place through a barrier of 21.3 kcal/mo .

Reducti Elimination: From NiIII to NiI\nThe second part of the mechanism (see Figure 4) starts at intermediate 6, as described above. At this point, the NiIII complex undergoes a reductive elimination to yield the coupling reaction product. We explored all the possible reductive elimination transition states from every Ni(III) intermediate (TS7-10, TS4-10, TS5-10, TS6-10). The reaction barriers are in all the cases very low (<7 kcal/mol). The last three mentioned transition states will converge into the same intermediate (10, \u221268.3 kcal/mol), while TS7-10 leads to the formation of a c tionic intermediat (10\u2032, \u221255.9 kcal/mol). From 10, the coupli g reaction product is released, forming the trigonal planar NiI-Br co plex 11 exergonically (\u221281.8 kcal/mol).

Single Electron Transfer (SET): From NiI to Ni0\nThis last step is based on the SET process catalyzed by the IrII complex, previously generated as a result of the oxidation of the alcohol-NHC adduct. Thus, intermediate 11 is easily reduced by the presence of the IrII photocatalyst, which is oxidized to IrIII, and the coordination of a second unit of the aryl bromide substrate to regenerate the catalytic cycle. We assume a low SET barrier, as Ir photoredox catalysts are usually very active in SET processes, and the overall thermodynamic free energy change of the reduction of 11 to F was calculated considering the oxidation of the photoredox catalyst from Ir(II) to Ir(III). In this w y, on e SET takes place, the c mplex species F is regenerated (\u221297.2 kcal/mol), allowing the start of a new Ir/Ni catalytic cycle."

This study completes the picture of the whole mechanistic cycle and shows how nickel, as a flexible metal in terms of oxidation states, can engage this reactivity very efficiently, promoting all the steps through low reaction-free energy barriers. We have evaluated two different mechanistic scenarios, and the conclusion is that both can operate simultaneously depending on the concentration of the different species in the reaction mixture.

Transition states were also verified by relaxing them to reactants and products and performing IRC calculations when needed. Additionally, a single-point calculation was performed using the M06 [29] functional and Def2TZVPP basis set to further refine the potential energies, following the methodology reported before in a related computational study [30]. Parameters for the thermal correction were obtained\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9145 8 of 9\nfrom the frequency calculations, and the 1M standard state correction was considered by adding 1.89 kcal/mol to all the species. Solvation was included in both optimizations and single-point calculations using the SMD implicit solvent (N,N-dimethyl acetamide) model [31]. A comparative study including other two different methods is included in the Supplementary Materials. 3D structures were illustrated using the CLYview program [32]. MECP calculations were performed using the easyMECP code [33].\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24119145/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, I.F.-A.; methodology, N.S., P.R.-C. and D.A.; formal analysis, N.S. and I.F.-A.; investigation, N.S., P.R.-C. and D.A.; resources, D.S. and I.F.-A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, N.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, N.S., D.S. and I.F.-A.; visualization, N.S.; supervision, D.S. and I.F.-A.; project administration, D.S. and I.F.-A.; funding acquisition, D.S. and I.F.-A.
