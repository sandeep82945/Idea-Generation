 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the impact of air frying versus oven baking on acrylamide formation in the cupcake model. Since acrylamide is another hazardous Maillard reaction product, it would be interesting to see how the two cooking methods differ in acrylamide generation. 

2. Examine the effects of other natural food additives besides green tea, such as spices, fruits or vegetables, on reducing the formation of AGEs and modifying food qualities in air-fried versus oven-baked foods. This could identify more options for developing healthier baked goods.

3. Study the shelf-life and nutritional qualities of air-fried versus oven-baked cupcakes over time. How do the two cooking methods affect starch digestibility, vitamin retention, lipid oxidation etc. during storage?

4. Investigate the microbial safety of air-fried versus oven-baked foods. Are there differences in bacterial or fungal growth during storage? Air flow may impact microbial loads.

5. Conduct sensory analysis with consumer panels to evaluate preference, texture, mouthfeel and other attributes of air-fried versus oven-baked cupcakes. This could provide insights into consumer acceptance of the different cooking methods.
