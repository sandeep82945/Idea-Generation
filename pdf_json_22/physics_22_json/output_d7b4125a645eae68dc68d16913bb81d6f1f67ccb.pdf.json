Resonant \u03bb 2.6 \u03bcm light for the 3D1 \u2192 3P0 transition mediates cooperative interactions between the atoms while the atoms are trapped in a deeply subwavelength optical lattice. The atoms then exhibit collective excitation eigenmodes, e.g., with a strong cooperative magnetic response at optical frequencies, despite individual atoms having negligible coupling to the magnetic component of light. We provide a detailed scheme to utilize excitations of such cooperative modes consisting of arrays of electromagnetic multipoles to form an atomic Huygens\u2019 surface, with complete 2\u03c0 phase control of transmitted light and almost no reflection, allowing nearly arbitrary wavefront shaping. In the numerical examples, this is achieved by controlling the atomic level shifts of Sr with off-resonant 3PJ \u2192 3D1 transitions, which results in a simultaneous excitation of arrays of electric dipoles and electric quadrupoles or magnetic dipoles. We demonstrate the wavefront engineering for a Sr array by realizing the steering of an incident beam and generation of a baby-Skyrmion texture in the transmitted light via a topologically nontrivial transition of a Gaussian beam to a Poincar\u00e9 beam, which contains all possible polarizations in a single cross-section.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033242\nI. INTRODUCTION\nExtreme wavefront control is the ultimate goal of manipulating light by material interfaces. However, the quest for precise optical control is often limited by vanishingly weak couplings of natural polarizable media to the magnetic component of light [1]. This shortcoming has driven the development of metamaterials and metasurfaces [2\u20134]. Thin artificial metasurfaces, in particular, can impart abrupt phase changes on transmitted and reflected light, leading to the development of Huygens\u2019 surfaces [5\u20139]. These surfaces are physical realizations of Huygens\u2019 principle, which states that each point in a propagating beam acts as an independent source of forward-propagating waves [10], with a more rigorous formulation modeling these sources as crossed electric and magnetic dipoles [11]. The resulting metasurfaces allow the phase, polarization, and direction of transmitted light to be engineered. However, metasurface functionalities have limitations: Fabrication inconsistencies lead to inhomogeneous resonance broadening, and absorptive losses are hard to avoid\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In addition, they operate almost entirely in the classical regime.\nMeanwhile, atoms trapped in a periodic subwavelength planar optical lattice have been shown in experiments to exhibit collective, spatially delocalized subradiant optical excitations [12], and related experiments on collective excitations have also been performed in other periodic structures [13,14]. Cooperatively responding optical systems of subwavelength atomic arrays have inspired a large body of theoretical studies, with examples including manipulation of subradiance [15\u201318], single-photon storage [19\u201321], atom and excitation statistics [22,23], optical cavitylike phenomena [24\u201326], collective antibunching [27\u201329], connected arrays [30], optomechanics [31], and parity-time symmetry breaking [32]. In particular, it was recently shown how a bilayer array of atoms could form a Huygens\u2019 surface via emerging collective excitations that mimic an array of crossed electric and magnetic dipoles, even when the atoms only undergo electric dipole transitions [33,34].\nAlthough the optical transmission experiment [12] was performed with alkali-metal atoms trapped in a Mott-insulator state of an optical lattice, there are several other promising atomic species. In particular, alkaline-earth-metal and rareearth-metal atoms provide great flexibility in the experimental control of their optical properties [35\u201337], and Mott-insulator states of 174Yb and 84Sr have been experimentally realized [36,38]. Sr and Yb exhibit many optical transitions, and their\n2643-1564/2022/4(3)/033242(11) 033242-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nnarrow optical resonances find applications, e.g., in atomic clocks [39] and in fermionic many-body physics [40]. In the bosonic isotopes of Sr and Yb, the nuclear spin vanishes, and the atoms provide prototype models for spatially isotropic J = 0 \u2192 J \u2032 = 1 optical transitions. Moreover, Sr exhibits a long-wavelength optical transition together with different magic wavelength resonances that provide optical lattice spacing much smaller than the probe resonance wavelength [41].\nHere we demonstrate how a long-standing challenge of generating optically active magnetism in atomic media can be implemented by analyzing in detail the specific electronic properties of bosonic Sr atoms. We show how cooperative responses of atoms exhibiting arrays of synthetic magnetic dipoles and electric quadrupoles are formed from electric dipole transitions and how these can be utilized for constructing a Huygens\u2019 surface of atoms. We analyze the \u03bb = 2.6 \u03bcm optical transition from the 5s4d 3D1 to the metastable 5s5p 3P0 state. The coupling of light to other than electric dipole transitions of an individual Sr atom is negligible. However, due to cooperative light-mediated interactions, collective excitation eigenmodes emerge in a bilayer array where the atomic dipoles can point in different directions. For one such mode, radiative transitions form an approximate circle of electric dipoles around a four-atom unit cell in each of the unit cells of the array. The cooperatively coupled electric dipole transitions of atoms at the corners of the unit cell then mimic an approximate loop of oscillating current, producing a magnetic dipole. With a different orientation of the electric dipole transitions, each unit cell exhibits an electric quadrupole. The scattering symmetries of these higher-order multipoles in the forward and backward directions are different from those of electric dipoles [42]. In a bilayer array, they can then interfere with electric dipoles in a planar array by providing complete transmission with no reflection to realize a Huygens\u2019 surface.\nBy applying carefully chosen control fields to the Sr atoms, we use in a numerical example off-resonant coupling to higher 5s6p 3PJ states to shift the 3D1 atomic level energies and control the simultaneous excitation of electric-dipole and electric-quadrupole collective modes. This generates a Huygens\u2019 surface with 89% transmission and complete phase control of the light field for a 31 \u00d7 31 \u00d7 4 lattice. We analyze the sensitivity of the wavefront shaping to experimental errors and show that an offset in one parameter can be compensated for by varying the remaining values; e.g., when the phase of the off-resonant control field is allowed to vary, an efficient Huygens\u2019 surface with high transmission (>80%) can be maintained by also varying the control-laser intensity.\nUsing the Huygens\u2019 surface, we demonstrate beam steering, changing the direction of the transmitted beam relative to the incident beam, which allows for optical sorting of light for subsequent processing. Moreover, we show how the Sr array can transform a topologically trivial Gaussian beam into a Poincar\u00e9 beam, containing all possible polarizations in a single cross-section [43]. The Stokes vector of this beam provides a nontrivial topological mapping from the transverse plane to the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, forming a baby-Skyrmion texture [44,45]."

However, transitions between singlet and triplet states are electric dipole forbidden in the absence of magnetic fields. The lowest triplet state 5s5p 3P0, therefore, forms a metastable effective ground state, leading to a J = 0 \u2192 J \u2032 = 1 transition with the 5s4d 3D1 states, with a wavelength \u03bb 2.6 \u03bcm and \u03b3 1.45 \u00d7 105 s\u22121 [46,47], where \u03b3 = D2k3/(6\u03c0 0h\u0304) is the Wigner-Weisskopf linewidth with D the reduced matrix dipole element and k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb. Additional resonances [41] are used to trap the atoms in an optical lattice at a magic wavelength. Trapping at the magic wavelength has the advantage of being robust against fluctuations of intensity and atomic positions [48]. However, atoms could also be strongly trapped in deep optical lattices in the Lamb-Dicke regime at other wavelengths."

To find realistic and feasible values for subwavelength trapping, we first explore the magic wavelength condition for the transition 5s5p 3P0 \u2192 5s4d 3D1, which provides a very short wavelength lattice solution for Sr [41]. The polarizabilities of the two states as a function of wavelength are given in Fig. 3. A particularly suitable magic wavelength solution was calculated in Ref. [41] at \u03bbm \u223c 415 nm. While the polarizability of the 3P0 level is well-known because of its metrological interest [46], the transitions from 3D1, and especially their decay rates, are much less frequently explored [51]. Hence, the appearance of the precise value of this magic wavelength has to be taken with great care.\nFor the polarizability computation of the 3D1 level, we identified two important transitions given in Table I. The magic wavelength \u03bbm allows for homogeneous trapping of atoms at the intensity minima of a standing wave with a\nperiod a \u03bbm/2 \u2248 207 nm, allowing for deeply subwavelength spacing a/\u03bb 0.08 when compared to \u03bb 2.6 \u03bcm, the resonance wavelength of the 3D1 \u2192 3P0 transition. In comparison, recent experiments with 87Rb achieved a ratio of spacing a/\u03bb 0.68 [12]. While this was sufficient to demonstrate the cooperative response, with subradiant collective decay rates below the fundamental limit of a single isolated atom, Sr arrays allow for multiple atoms within a subwavelength spacing.\nA three-dimensional (3D) optical trap with independent control over the spacing in each direction can be formed by varying the angle of the trapping beams, generating an accordion lattice [52\u201354]. Here, we use three pairs of laser beams, with each pair interfering to create a standing wave in the x, y, and z directions. Each laser is tuned approximately to the magic wavelength, such that all atoms experience an identical trapping potential regardless of internal state, with a slight offset in detuning to average out unwanted interference effects (see Appendix B). The result is a 3D lattice with spacing ax, ay, dz 0.08\u03bb. The bilayer geometry with square unit cells can then be implemented by selectively filling sites of this lattice, with dy = nay for integer n. While the atoms are trapped here at the magic wavelength, this is not a strict requirement as, for sufficient trapping strength, the atoms will not be inhomogeneously broadened in the Lamb-Dicke regime. In this case, the geometry could alternatively be realized by a 2D regular square lattice combined with a double-well superlattice in the x direction [55\u201358], or with optical tweezers [59], including at blue detuning using an optical bottle trap [60]."

Furthermore, when the interatomic separation is sufficiently small, light is scattered between atoms multiple times before escaping. Each atom is driven not just by the external field but also by that from every other atom, leading to strong dipole-dipole interactions and cooperative responses.

We now show how the optical transitions of bosonic Sr can be used to realize a collective optical magnetic response and responses to higher-order multipole moments. The deeply subwavelength trapping in the optical lattice allows strong magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole interactions.\nWe focus on a specific implementation of the trapping geometry described in Sec. II B with ax = ay = 0.08\u03bb, dz = 0.82\u03bb, and dy = 8ay. Each square unit cell in isolation has a variety of different excitation eigenmodes, each of which is dominated by a different multipole, including electricdipole, magnetic-dipole, electric-quadrupole, and magneticquadrupole contributions [33]. Collective interactions between unit cells lead to eigenmodes of the whole array that correspond to uniform repetitions of the unit-cell eigenmodes, representing a particular multipole moment. Numerically, we find a single unit-cell eigenmode for which the magneticdipole component on resonance is over 99%, with negligible\ncontributions from other electromagnetic multipoles (see Appendix C). The magnetic response arises as the orientations of the oscillating electric dipoles on each atom form a discrete approximation of a loop [see the inset of Fig. 4(b)]. A unit-cell excitation eigenmode with electric quadrupole dominating radiation is shown in the inset of Fig. 4(d). Here an electric quadrupole constitutes over 88% of the response, with the rest dominated by an electric dipole (see Appendix C).\nThe transmission and reflection spectra of an incident Gaussian beam close to the resonance of the mode corresponding to uniform in-phase magnetic dipoles on each unit cell are shown in Fig. 4(a). The occupation of this mode, defined as [15]\nLi = \u2223\u2223vTi b\u2223\u22232\u2211\nj \u2223\u2223vTj b\u2223\u22232 , (7)\nis displayed in Fig. 4(b), with the total occupation of all modes normalized at the resonance frequency. The magnetic mode is almost uniquely occupied on resonance, indicating a strong magnetic response. The transmission and reflection spectra of the uniform in-phase electric-quadrupole mode are shown in Fig. 4(c). Figure 4(d) shows the occupation of the corresponding collective mode over the entire lattice, again with almost unit occupancy on resonance.\n033242-4\nThe deeply subwavelength trapping geometry of bosonic Sr, with ax, ay = 0.08\u03bb, opens new avenues for engineering and manipulating light-matter interactions since magneticdipole and electric-quadrupole moments on each unit cell can themselves form a subwavelength lattice. For example, the bilayer of bosonic Sr atoms demonstrated here provides an experimental platform to realize previous proposals, such as a magnetic mirror [34], which reflects light without the usual \u03c0 phase shift present upon reflection from an electric-dipole array [71\u201373], or unidirectional storage of a single-photon pulse [21]. In addition, the small lattice spacing scheme of Sr could also be extended to more complex setups involving topologically nontrivial configurations, such as toroidal dipoles and anapoles [74]."

            "text": "The higher-order multipole response of tightly spaced bosonic Sr arrays can also be used to engineer an atomic Huygens\u2019 surface. Here, we describe a physical protocol using the electronic level and transition parameters of bosonic Sr for realizing optical wavefront control via a Huygens\u2019 surface. This is achieved by engineering the Sr atomic level shifts so that both electric-dipole and magnetic-dipole modes, or alternatively both electric-dipole and electric-quadrupole modes, are simultaneously excited. We calculate the effect of an additional off-resonant optical standing wave to synthesize the required level shift profiles and numerically find generally slightly better solutions for the electric-dipole and electric-quadrupole mode pair. Our scheme, therefore, provides a precise implementation of a bosonic Sr Huygens surface, which, by varying the transmitted phase across the array, could realize previous proposals for wavefront control of incident light, including focusing, beam-steering, polarization control, and optical angular momentum generation [19,33,34]. Huygens\u2019 surfaces have been engineered in metallic [5] and dielectric [6\u20139] systems. However, high absorption and fabrication imperfections pose severe challenges at optical frequencies. All absorbed light is reradiated for the bosonic Sr atomic array considered here (unit emission quantum yield), and each atom has an identical resonance frequency. The atomic response could also be manipulated at the quantum regime [19].\nWhile the Huygens\u2019 surface effect is typically produced by a combination of electric and magnetic dipoles, we generate it using electric dipoles and electric quadrupoles. The symmetric emission of the electric dipole moment in the forward and backward directions, combined with the antisymmetric emission of the electric-quadrupole moment, leads to destructive interference in the reflected light and constructive interference in transmission. We write the scattered field E\u00b1s in the \u00b1x\u0302 directions as E\u00b1s = E\u00b1s,d + E\u00b1s,q, where E\u00b1s,d (E\u00b1s,q) is the field from the electric-dipole (electric-quadrupole) mode. Then, on resonance, E+s,d = E+s,q \u2248 \u2212E and the total field E = E+s + E \u2248 \u2212E . Tuning the incident light off-resonance leads to transmission with no phase shift. As the resonance is crossed, complete 2\u03c0 phase control of the forward-propagating beam is achieved. Meanwhile, in the backward direction, the differ-\nent symmetries of the scattered fields from the electric dipole and quadrupole contributions ensure E\u2212s,d \u2248 \u2212E\u2212s,q, leading to near-zero reflection.\nThe collective eigenmodes generally all have different line shifts and linewidths, making their simultaneous excitation with equal scattering strength nontrivial. To excite two modes simultaneously, we vary the shifts of the m = 0,\u00b11 levels between atoms in each unit cell with the same periodicity as the lattice so that different unit cells experience the same level shifts. Using Eq. (1), we induce a vector and tensor polarizability (see Appendix A) via a control laser close to resonance with the 5s4d 3D1 \u2192 5s6p 3P0,1,2 transitions described in Table II. The transition 3D1 \u2192 3P2 is weak and will be ignored, whereas the other far-detuned dipole-allowed transitions will contribute to an extra m-independent shift that can be easily measured and compensated for experimentally. The latter will be ignored as well. In Fig. 5(a) [Fig. 5(b)] we show the light shift of the 3D1 Zeeman substates across the transition for a plane wave of intensity 1 W/cm2 and a light polarization of \u03c0 (\u03c3+). The level shift due to \u03c3\u2212 polarization is obtained by reversing the m = \u00b11 states.\nTo engineer the necessary level shifts, we employ a control beam that consists of a standing wave with a wavelength close to the transitions in Table II and tilted at an angle such that\n033242-5\nthe in-plane periodicity matches that of the atomic lattice. The control beam has the form Ec(r) = Ece\u0302c cos (kc \u00b7 r + \u03c6), with amplitude Ec, frequency \u03c9c = 2\u03c0c/(636.39 nm) + \u03b4\u03c9c, and wave vector kc. The wave vector kc = (0.64x\u0302 + 0.77y\u0302)kc, where kc = |kc| = \u03c9c/c, is fixed to give an in-plane periodicity dy/2. This leaves a number of free parameters numerically optimized to maximize the transmission. The control beam has freedom of phase \u03c6, intensity Ic = c 0|Ec|2/2, frequency \u03b4\u03c9c, and the orientation and ellipticity of the polarization e\u0302c. In addition, the lattice parameters ax, ay, and an overall constant Zeeman splitting \u03b4\u0304 = ( ( j)+ \u2212 ( j)\u2212 )/2 (achievable, e.g., with a constant magnetic field) are varied. This results in eight parameters to control the seven independent relative level shifts ( j)\u00b1 on four atoms, up to an irrelevant overall shift in the frequency of the Huygens\u2019 surface resonance, allowing for redundancy to account for experimental errors or constraints.\nWhile numerous solutions are possible, here we take \u03b4\u0304 = \u221213\u03b3 , Ic = 2.36 kW/cm2, and \u03b4\u03c9c = 2.7 \u00d7 1010 Hz, slightly blue-detuned from the 3 D1 \u2192 3P1 transition where level shifts are large, but still far enough from resonance to disregard spontaneous emission events. The phase \u03c6 = 1.1 gives a large variation in intensity across a unit cell, while the polarization e\u0302c = (0.7 + 0.2i)x\u0302 + (\u22120.6 \u2212 0.2i)y\u0302 + 0.03z\u0302 is chosen to provide significant scalar, vector, and tensor polarizabilities (see Appendix A). The resulting Huygens\u2019 surface transmission spectrum is shown in Fig. 6 for a plane-wave incident beam with uniform y polarization. Numerically, we find that the transmission is 89% across the full 2\u03c0 phase range.\nWhile the solution provided depends sensitively on each individual parameter, multiple similar solutions exist with different parameter values. Therefore, experimental uncertainty in one parameter can be compensated for by reoptimizing the rest. We illustrate this with an example shown in Fig. 7, corresponding to the case analyzed in Fig. 6. We consider the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d of the laser set to target the resonance where the transmission is the lowest and the gradient of the phase of transmitted light is the largest (with respect to the laser frequency). At the exact resonance, the Huygens\u2019 surface generates a \u03c0 phase shift in the transmitted light, but\nthe variation of the phase \u03c6 of the control beam from \u03c6 1.1 alters this. Keeping all other parameters fixed, we find a wide range of \u03c6 where an optimal solution can be restored by also varying the intensity Ic of the control beam, achieving the desired phase with 80% transmission for 0.57 \u03c6 1.26. This figure describes the minimum transmission in the spectrum for each solution (see Fig. 6). We also note that at Ic \u2248 2.35 kW/cm2, the solution becomes insensitive to small fluctuations in \u03c6. Other experimental errors can be compensated for by allowing more parameters to be reoptimized. For example, a mismatch in the detuning \u03b4\u03c9c, which changes the respective magnitude of the scalar, vector, and tensor polarizabilities, can be compensated for by simultaneously varying both the polarization and the intensity of the control beam."

This mechanism provides a vital resource to redirect light, e.g., for subsequent beamshaping or detection. The steering is achieved by applying a linear phase gradient, \u03b1 = \u03bayy + \u03bazz. For example, a normally incident field with phase exp (ikxx) is transformed to the outgoing field with phase exp [i(k\u2032xx + \u03bayy + \u03bazz)], with effective momentum components ky = \u03bay, kz = \u03baz, and (k\u2032x )2 = k2x \u2212 (\u03ba2y + \u03ba2z ). The resulting beam is steered away from the\n033242-6\nx axis by an angle sin\u22121(\u03ba/k), where \u03ba = \u221a\n\u03ba2y + \u03ba2z .

(8)\nBecause the transmission phase shift in Fig. 6 depends on the detuning of the laser from the Huygens\u2019 surface resonance and not the relative shifts between the m = 0,\u00b11 levels, the wavefront shaping can be achieved by adding a simple uniform phase gradient. For example, scalar polarizability generated by an additional off-resonant optical or microwave field propagating in the x direction with polarization \u221a 2/3e\u0302y + \u221a 1/3e\u0302z and with an intensity gradient in the transverse plane is sufficient. For the example in Fig. 8, the required level shift gradient in the y direction is 0.17\u03b3 /\u03bb = 0.07\u03b3 \u03bcm\u22121. In contrast to fabricated plasmonic or dielectric devices, the beam-steering angle could thus be changed in situ by varying the gradient or direction of the intensity variation."

The Poincar\u00e9 beam amplitude is formed from a linear combination,\nUP = U00e\u0302z + U10e\u0302y, (9) of a Gaussian and Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beam with orthogonal polarizations. Here, Ul p is the LG beam with integer azimuthal index l and radial index p, and an angular phase profile eil\u03c6 where \u03c6 = arctan (kz/ky) [76]. The different radial amplitude profile and azimuthal phase profile of the two components interfere, giving varying polarization of UP across the transverse plane of the beam.\nTo achieve this superposition with an atomic Huygens\u2019 surface, we illuminate it with an incident Gaussian with po-\nlarization e\u0302in = 0.8e\u0302y + 0.6e\u0302z. As the unit-cell electric-dipole and electric-quadrupole modes consist of atomic dipoles in the xy plane, the z component does not excite the Huygens\u2019 surface and is transmitted with no phase change (other z-polarized modes exist but are far off-resonance). A phase profile \u03b1 = \u03c6 on the y component leads to a zero along the x axis and an approximate LG profile with l = 1, with the resulting combination having the form of Eq. (9). The required scalar level shifts can once again be induced with an additional optical field, now with an azimuthal intensity variation. For example, passing light through a surface with an optical thickness proportional to the angle, such as a variable neutral density filter, with a discontinuity at a specific angle leads to a corresponding azimuthal phase profile in the transmitted y-polarized light.\nThe intensity and Stokes parameters of the resulting Poincar\u00e9 beam are shown in Fig. 9. For optical fields, the S2 Poincar\u00e9 sphere is parametrized by the Stokes vector S [77]. Here, we plot S = (s1, s2, s3)T with a nonstandard basis s1 = (U \u2212 V )/ \u221a 2, s2 = (U + V )/ \u221a 2, and s3 = \u2212Q, where Q = (|Ey|2 \u2212 |Ez|2)/|E |2, U = 2 Re(EyE\u2217z )/|E |2, and V = \u22122 Im(EyE\u2217z )/|E |2 are the standard normalized Stokes parameters describing horizontal, diagonal, and circular polarization, respectively. For the y-polarized U10, the amplitude is zero along the beam axis where the phase is undefined, and the remaining field consists solely of the z-polarized l = 0 component. Moving out from the beam axis, the amplitude of U10 increases, and, at some distance, it is equal to that of U00. The ei\u03c6 phase of the y-polarized light then leads to diagonal (\u03c6 = 0), left-circular (\u03c6 = \u03c0/2), antidiagonal (\u03c6 = \u03c0 ), and right-circular (\u03c6 = 3\u03c0/2) polarizations around this contour. The l = 0 component has a narrower spatial profile in the yz plane than the l = 1 component, and far from the optical axis, the beam is y-polarized.\nThe preparation of the Poincar\u00e9 beam also represents a topological transformation of a (topologically) trivial beam\n033242-7\nto one that forms a baby-Skyrmion texture [44,45]. For a baby-Skyrmion, the Stokes vector is assumed to take a uniform constant value everywhere sufficiently far away from the center of the texture. The baby-Skyrmion topology is then determined by an S2 \u2192 S2 mapping, indicating how many times the S2 compactified beam cross-section wraps over the S2 Poincar\u00e9 sphere,\nW = \u222b S d i 8\u03c0 i jkS \u00b7 \u2202S \u2202r j \u00d7 \u2202S \u2202rk , (10)\nwhere the integration is over the beam cross-section containing the texture, and i jk denotes a completely antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor. The field configuration in Fig. 9 corresponds to a nontrivial topological winding number W = 1, in which case the Stokes vector profile of the beam cross-section covers the Poincar\u00e9 sphere exactly once. BabySkyrmions, different from the full 3D Skyrmions [78\u201380], can optically appear as a result of different light-matter interfaces [81\u201384], and they are known in magnetic structures [85] and superfluids [86\u201388]."

Additional improvements in the performance of the Huygens\u2019 surface could be achieved by choosing the trapping laser frequency and polarizations, such that the optical lattice lasers also impose level shifts, increasing the control degrees of freedom at the expense of increasing the sensitivity to laser intensity fluctuations. Similar trapping geometries and site-specific level shifts could also be used to implement many other proposed schemes, including an atomic magnetic mirror [34], unidirectional storage of a photon pulse [21], or an excitation of a highly subradiant antiferromagnetic mode [89].

            "text": "The trapping geometry consists of three independent standing waves in the x, y, and z directions. The standing wave in the x direction is given by Em cos (2\u03c0x/\u03bbm)e\u0302y with a similar standing wave in the y direction obtained by interchanging x, y \u2192 y, z. The trapping in the z direction is achieved with two tilted beams, Em[e\u03021ei(kyy+kzz) + e\u03022ei(kyy\u2212kzz)], with kz = 0.6km and ky = \u221a k2m \u2212 k2z , and polarizations e\u03021 = (\u2212kze\u0302y + kye\u0302z )/km and e\u03022 = (kze\u0302y + kye\u0302z )/km. Interference between the beams can lead to a vector or tensor polarizability, leaving the shifts sensitive to fluctuations in the trapping intensity. To avoid this, each standing wave is detuned by 100 MHz, and the average polarization in each direction then leads to a level independent shift on each of the m = 0,\u00b11 levels of the 3D1 state."
