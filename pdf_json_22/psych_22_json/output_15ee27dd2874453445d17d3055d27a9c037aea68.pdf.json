    "abstractText": "Results: Of the patients, 64.5% were men, 60.9% required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during hospitalization, and the average age was about 48.23 \u00b1 14.33 years. Also, 40% showed symptoms associated with PTSD, 38.4% exhibited anxiety, 36.6% depression, and 36.12% exhibited fear of COVID-19. There were statistically significant differences between men and women, in PTSD (t = -3.414, df = 224, p = 0.001, x m = 5.10, x w = 6.32), depression (t = -4.680, df = 225, p=0.000, x m= 3.64, x w = 7.18), anxiety (t = -3.427, df = 152.53, p = 0.001, x m = 3.78, x w = 6.20), and fear of COVID-19 (t = -3.400, df = 224, p = 0.001, x m = 11.88, x w = 15.19). Furthermore, there were also statistically significant differences between the type of treatment during hospitalization (IMV vs. without IMV), in PTSD (t = 2.482, df = 223, p= 0.014, x IMV = 5.21, x WIMV = 6.08) and anxiety (t = -2.006, df = 223, p = 0.046, x IMV = 4.05, x WIMV = 5.44).",

A psychological evaluation focused on anxiety, depression, PTSD, and fear was conducted. Statistical analysis through the t-test for independent samples was performed.\nResults: Of the patients, 64.5% were men, 60.9% required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during hospitalization, and the average age was about 48.23 \u00b1 14.33 years. Also, 40% showed symptoms associated with PTSD, 38.4% exhibited anxiety, 36.6% depression, and 36.12% exhibited fear of COVID-19. There were statistically significant differences between men and women, in PTSD (t = -3.414, df = 224, p = 0.001, x m = 5.10, x w = 6.32), depression (t = -4.680, df = 225, p=0.000, x m= 3.64, x w = 7.18), anxiety (t = -3.427, df = 152.53, p = 0.001, x m = 3.78, x w = 6.20), and fear of COVID-19 (t = -3.400, df = 224, p = 0.001, x m = 11.88, x w = 15.19). Furthermore, there were also statistically significant differences between the type of treatment during hospitalization (IMV vs. without IMV), in PTSD (t = 2.482, df = 223, p= 0.014, x IMV = 5.21, x WIMV = 6.08) and anxiety (t = -2.006, df = 223, p = 0.046, x IMV = 4.05, x WIMV = 5.44).\nConclusion: Survivors of COVID-19 experience a high prevalence of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and fear, even 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Females and patients who did not require IMV during hospitalization are the most affected population, presenting more severe symptoms of these"

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak in China spread rapidly around the world, generating a major health emergency (Velavan and Meyer, 2020). At the time of writing this article, 496 million confirmed cases and 6.17 million deaths have been reported worldwide. COVID-19 is a condition caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and this infection present symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath (Ciotti et al., 2020).\nThroughout the course of the pandemic, it has been observed that some of the patients who had recovered from the acute phase of the infection began to present persistent symptoms, which constitute a new post-infectious syndrome called \u201cpost-COVID19 syndrome,\u201d which is defined as a set of signs and symptoms that develop after an infection compatible with COVID-19, persisting beyond 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis (Bender del Busto, 2022). This has also been observed in other infections such as Epstein\u2013Bar, Coxiella Burnetti, or Lyme disease (Boix and Merino, 2022).\nThe incidence of this syndrome has been reported mostly in patients with mild or severe COVID-19, regardless of the severity of symptoms in the acute phase. Between 10 and 65% of survivors who suffered mild or moderate COVID-19 present symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome for 12 weeks or more (Carod-Artal, 2018), in addition, more than 80 long-term symptoms have been identified, with duration and severity still unknown, but producing a negative impact on the health and quality of life at short and long-term (Bender del Busto, 2022; Boix and Merino, 2022).\nAmong the most frequently reported symptoms are physical, psychological, cognitive, and neurological alterations, such as chronic illness, fatigue, dyspnea, pain, cough, dysphagia, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), concentration problems, memory loss, sleep disorders, and headache (Halpin et al., 2021; Mazza et al., 2020; Moreno-P\u00e9rez et al., 2021; Nalbandian et al., 2021;\nXiong et al., 2021). On the other hand, it is estimated that 75% of survivors experienced at least one physical or psychological symptom 6 months after hospital discharge, where 23% reported feeling fatigue or muscle weakness, 23% reported depression or anxiety, and 26% reported sleep problems (Huang et al., 2021). A similar prevalence of psychological symptoms has been observed in the aftermath of other coronavirus infections, where nearly 40% of survivors of SARS and MERS epidemics in Asian and Middle Eastern countries reported symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, OCD, and PTSD after 1 month of the acute period of infection and even during follow-up 50 months later (Cheng et al., 2004; Lam et al., 2009; Moldofsky and Patcai, 2011; Du et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020).\nHospitalization due to COVID-19 is an event that generates an elevated level of stress, and the experience could even become traumatic. One of the prevalent psychological disorders among survivors is PTSD (Chen et al., 2021), which is caused mainly by exposure to a highly stressful or traumatic situation (Brady et al., 2000; Carvajal, 2002); it is commonly developed in the short or long term, and even in other infectious epidemics caused by SARS and MERS (Mak et al., 2009; Mak et al., 2010), survivors reported presenting symptoms associated with PTSD. Furthermore, comorbidities are frequently observed, especially in anxiety and depression, where comorbidity rates range from 21\u201394% for depression and 39\u201397% for anxiety (Ginzburg et al., 2010; Mak et al., 2009). The presence of comorbidities increases symptoms, aggravating the alterations and increasing the difficulties associated with psychological treatment (Chen et al., 2021).\nThe etiology related to post-COVID-19 syndrome includes a set of immunological alterations triggered during the acute period of infection. The exacerbated cellular inflammatory process increases the probability of developing psychological disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, or depression (Najjar et al., 2013; Miller and Raison, 2016), which when coupled with psychosocial vulnerability factors during recovery such as a continued fear of illness, contagion, uncertain future, stigma,\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org02\ndiscrimination, and traumatic memories of hospitalization and social isolation (Brooks et al., 2020; Carvalho et al., 2020; Mazza et al., 2020), could play a fundamental role within the onset, severity, and maintenance duration of psychological diseases associated with post-COVID19 syndrome.\nThe duration and prevalence of the psychological symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome are not yet known (Table 1). Thus, the aim of our study was to describe and compare the prevalence and severity of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and fear of COVID-19 in COVID-19 survivors, 3 months after hospital discharge in a Latin American context."

Psychological assessment was performed by trained and qualified psychologists using the following psychometric tests.\nThe Davidson Brief Trauma Scale (SPAN) (MeltzerBrody et al., 1999), an abbreviated version of the Davidson Trauma Scale, focused on assessing physiological and cognitive components present in PTSD symptomatology. It consists of four items, with a Likert-type response scale ranging from 1\u20135, obtaining a minimum final score of 4 and a maximum of 20. Final scores higher than 5 show a sensitivity of 0.69 and specificity of 0.95 for the diagnosis of PTSD (Meltzer-Brody et al., 1999). The validity and reliability in the Spanish-speaking population (Campo-Arias et al., 2020), obtained a Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin index of 0.714, Bartlett\u2019s chi square = 783.3 (gl = 6; p = 0.001), \u03b1 = 0.66, and eigenvalue of 1.99, explained about 49.7% of the variance. In the confirmatory factor analysis was obtained x2 = 5.921, df = 2, p = 0.052, RMSEA = 0.037 [CI\n90% 0.000-0.072], CFI = 0.955, Tucker\u2013Lewis Index = 0.985, SMRM = 0.011, a Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.66, and an Omega coefficient = 0.69.\nThe Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006) is based on seven items that evaluate the presence and frequency of symptoms associated with anxiety. The response options are offered on a Likert-type scale with values from 0\u20133, with the total score ranging from 0\u20133. The total score ranges from minimum values of zero tomaximum values of 21 points. Scores of 10\u201314 are associated with amoderate level of anxious symptomatology and values greater than or equal to 15 with severe symptomatology (Table 1). The validation in the Mexican population (Guti\u00e9rrez-Velilla et al., 2022) obtained a Cronbach\u00b4s \u03b1 = 0.82, a single factor explained 48.8% of variance, and the confirmatory analysis showed a model fit adequately (CFI = 0.0991, CMIN/DF = 1.924, RMSEA = 0.042, and SMRMR = 0.026).\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001) is an abbreviated version of the Patient Health Questionnaire. It consists of nine items aimed to assess the presence and frequency of symptoms associated with depression. The responses are based on a Likert-type scale with values from 0\u20133, allowing a minimum total score of 0 and a maximum of 27. Scores of 10\u201314 are associated with a moderate level of depressive symptomatology, from 15 to 19 with moderate\u2013severe levels, and scores greater than or equal to 20 with severe symptoms. Validation in the Mexican population (Arrieta et al., 2017) obtained a Cronbach\u00b4s \u03b1 = 0.80 and showed a model fit adequately (CFI = 0.91, Bentler\u2013Bannet non-normed index = 0.88, RMSEA = 0.09, and ROC = 0.85 (95% CI [0.84-0.94]).\nThe COVID-19 Fear Scale (FCV-19S) (Ahorsu et al., 2020): Mexican version of the COVID-19 Fear Scale (Garc\u00eda-Reyna et al., 2022). It is composed of seven items that assess the severity, presence, and frequency of physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses associated with the fear of COVID-19. The response options are through a Likert-type scale with values from 1\u20135, obtaining total scores of a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 35. High scores are related to a more severe fear response (Table 2). The internal reliability showed a Cronbach\u00b4s alpha of 0.90 and the confirmatory factor analysis showed a good model fit (x2 (7) = 29.40, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.03; SRMR = 0.010; and AIC = 71.40)."

Our results initially show that 93.4% of the survivors reported having at least one symptom associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome after their recovery, the most frequent of which were physical (82.7%), cognitive (37.9%), and psychological (25.1%). These observations are similar to those reported in other studies, where between 40 and 90%of patients withmoderate to severe COVID-19 presented at least one symptom associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome within the first 6 months after recovery (Huang et al., 2021; Nalbandian et al., 2021; Peghin et al., 2021).\nWithin the psychological aspect, symptoms associatedwith PTSD were observed in 40.2% of the survivors, 38.4% reported anxiety, 36.6% depression, and 36.12% fear of different aspects related to COVID-19. These results agree with those reported by other research studies where it was found that the prevalence of PTSD ranges from 30\u201340%, depression 20\u201340%, and anxiety 25\u201340% (Liu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Huilca Sergo, 2021; Nalbandian et al., 2021). Our study provides and complements information to address post-COVID psychological sequelae, which is a very important subject of study in the field of mental health.\nStatistically significant differences were found between men and women (p = 003), showing that women have a higher prevalence of severe symptoms associated with PTSD (2.5%), anxiety (7.5%), depression (7.5%), and fear (16.13%). These findings are related to what is found in the literature, where women tend to have a higher prevalence of psychological and emotional disorders (Lee et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2021), for example, the likelihood of developing PTSD increases and occursmostly inwomen (Schein et al., 2021). In addition, being female has also been associated as one of the predictors for higher\nPTSD symptom severity in COVID-19 survivors, in conjunction with other factors such as past traumatic events, prolonged symptoms, stigmatization, and a negative perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic (Huilca Sergo, 2021; Poyraz et al., 2021).\nAnother important aspect for the development of psychological alterations is related to the severity of the patients and hospitalization (Chen et al., 2021), when analyzing the presence of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and fear symptoms between patients who required IMV and those who only needed oxygenation during their hospitalization. Statistically significant differences were found in PTSD (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p< 0.05).Our results showed that the prevalence of symptoms associated with PTSD is higher in patients who did not require IMV (48.9%) and in patients with anxiety symptoms considered severe (10.2%), while depression scores associated with a moderate\u2013severe level were higher in these patients (8%), and the scores associated with fear before COVID-19 were very similar in both groups (9.5% in patients with IMV and 8% in patients without IMV). The percentages of symptoms associated with PTSD, anxiety, and depression present in those patientswhodidnot require IMVduring their hospitalization are in agreement with those obtained by Chen et al. (2021), who observed that hospitalized patients who reported greater symptoms of PTSD are those who, during their hospital stay, were exposed to negative news and that they are mostly patients who did not require IMV, being aware of disease processes such as delusions, agitation, persistent medical symptoms, and psychosocial factors such as constant concern for their own and family members\u2019 health (Janiri et al., 2021), and that during recovery, there could be factors for developing traumatic memories, compared to patients requiring IMV, who for most of their hospital stay are sedated. Our results also agree with those reported by Abdelghani et al. (2021) and Huilca Sergo, (2021) who found that patients with moderate to severe symptoms and who required hospitalization had a higher prevalence of moderate to severe PTSD symptoms 1month after hospitalization, and with the findings of Liu et al. (2020), who reported that patients who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit during hospitalization had no severe symptoms of PTSD, but moderate to severe symptoms of depression.\nAge is another important factor associated with the development of PTSD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. We found that PTSD symptoms affected most frequently younger patients compared with other age groups (p < 0.05). The prevalence of clinically severe PTSD symptoms affected about 18.3% of the younger patients, clinically severe anxiety symptoms was present in 10% of these patients, while 7% presented symptoms related to clinically severe depression. Our results are related to what is found in the literature, where stressful events affect young people more than old people (Cai et al., 2020). It has been observed that old people present a lower level of acute stress during stressful events than young people (Reynolds et al., 2016). In theCOVID-19 context, the patron is the same (Cai et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2022). On the other hand, anxiety and depressive symptoms are also most common in young people (Gambin et al., 2021; Solomou and Constantinidou, 2020). Age, along with other factors such as\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org08\nbeing female, and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms have been identified as risk factors for the development of PTSD, anxiety, depression, or other mental comorbidities (Chen et al., 2020, Nie et al., 2020, Ochnik et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2022).\nOne of the factors associated with the development of PTSD and other psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression is related to the loss of a family member or loved one (Huilca Sergo, 2021). In our study, about 42.7% of COVID-19 survivors reported having lost one or more family members due to COVID-19, being more frequent in women (52.6%). This is one limitation of our study, not exploring the association between the loss of a family member and the severity of PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and fear. According to what is reported in the literature, it is hypothesized that it could be a risk factor for the onset and modulation of these alterations (Liu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Huilca Sergo, 2021).\nAnother limitation of our study is that we do not have a control group that allows us to compare the results in a retrospective study, as many others have done (e.g., Taquet et al., 2021). However, our results are in accordance with those previously reported throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious epidemics, allowing us to\nprovide more data that demonstrate the impact that postCOVID-19 syndrome has on the mental health of survivors, and contributing information to those already existing in the Latin American context. However, more research is needed to understand the long-term development of these symptoms."

            "text": "Psychological symptoms are observed within post-COVID19 syndrome in about 25% of COVID-19 survivors even after hospital discharge. Symptomatology associated with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and fear tends to affect more women, while those survivors who did not require IMV during their hospitalization and the stressful experience that this involves tend to be more affected by PTSD and anxiety symptoms compared to those patients who required IMV. Knowing the prevalence and incidence of psychological disturbances such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD, allows prevention plans to be implemented before patients present a severe case of COVID-19, providing tools that successfully help in coping due to adaptive behavior after the acute period of infection. In addition, knowing the prevalence of these symptoms also makes it\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org09\npossible to design and implement cognitive and behavioral treatments for survivors who are mostly affected by symptoms associated with PTSD, anxiety, or depression, access more efficient treatments, reduce comorbidity, and even decrease associated risk factors such as suicide and addictions."
