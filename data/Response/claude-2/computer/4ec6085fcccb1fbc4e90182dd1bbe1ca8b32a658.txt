 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Expand the multilingual singable lyrics dataset to include more languages, genres, and musical information like notes and tempo. This would allow for more comprehensive analysis and genre-specific evaluations.

2. Incorporate musical features like rhythm, tempo, notes, etc. into the evaluation metrics. This could lead to metrics that better capture the musicality and singability of translated lyrics. 

3. Develop computational methods and models for generating singable lyric translations, using the evaluation framework to guide and assess the translations.

4. Conduct perceptual studies to validate the proposed metrics against human judgments of singability, naturalness, etc. This could reveal areas where the metrics need refinement.  

5. Analyze how different translation approaches like literal, poetic, etc. impact the singability metrics. This could uncover trade-offs translators make between semantics and singability.
