1. **Investigate the factors that influence the distribution of cannabis biomarkers between the liquid and solid phases of wastewater.** This could include factors such as the type of wastewater treatment plant, the influent wastewater characteristics, and the presence of other contaminants.
2. **Develop a correction factor that can be applied to the measured concentration of cannabis biomarkers in the liquid phase to account for the fraction that is present in the suspended solids.** This would allow for more accurate estimation of the total biomarker concentration in raw wastewater.
3. **Conduct clinical studies to obtain more accurate urinary and fecal excretion rates for cannabis biomarkers.** This information is essential for developing accurate back-calculation models to estimate cannabis consumption from wastewater data.
4. **Investigate the potential for using THC-COOH-D9 as an analogue to study the behavior and distribution of THC-COOH between the liquid and solid phases of wastewater.** This could provide valuable insights into the processes that govern the fate of cannabis biomarkers in wastewater.
5. **Develop a standardized analytical protocol for cannabis biomarker analysis in wastewater that takes into account the presence of biomarkers in both the liquid and solid phases.** This would ensure that data from different studies are comparable and that accurate estimates of cannabis consumption can be obtained.
