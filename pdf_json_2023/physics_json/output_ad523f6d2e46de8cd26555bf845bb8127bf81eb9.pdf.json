However, the mecha-8 nisms through which these enzymes affect the dynamics of biomolecular condensates have not been9 systematically explored. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism by which mutation of a DEAD-10 box helicase\u2019s catalytic core alters ribonucleoprotein condensate dynamics in the presence of ATP.11 Through altering RNA length within the system, we are able to attribute the altered biomolecular12 dynamics and material properties to physical crosslinking of RNA facilitated by the mutant helicase.13 These results suggest the mutant condensates approach a gel transition when RNA length is increased14 to lengths comparable to eukaryotic mRNA. Lastly, we show that this crosslinking effect is tunable15 with ATP concentration, uncovering a system whose RNA mobility and material properties vary16 with enzyme activity. More generally, these findings point to a fundamental mechanism for modulat-17 ing condensate dynamics and emergent material properties through nonequilibrium, molecular-scale18 interactions.19\nSignificance20\nBiomolecular condensates are membraneless organelles which organize cellular biochemistry. These21 structures have a diversity of material properties and dynamics which are crucial to their function.22 How condensate properties are determined by biomolecular interactions and enzyme activity remain23 open questions. DEAD-box helicases have been identified as central regulators of many protein-RNA24 condensates, though their specific mechanistic roles are ill-defined. In this work, we demonstrate that25 a DEAD-box helicase mutation crosslinks condensate RNA in an ATP-dependent fashion via protein-26 RNA clamping. Protein and RNA diffusion can be tuned with ATP concentration, corresponding to27 an order of magnitude change in condensate viscosity. These findings expand our understanding28 of control points for cellular biomolecular condensates that have implications for medicine and29 bioengineering.30\n1 Introduction31\nBiomolecular condensation is a form of cellular organization which has been implicated in a wide32 variety of cellular processes including embryonic development, ribonucleoprotein complex assembly,33 stress response, and misfolded protein storage [1]. The biochemical roles of biomolecular condensates34 are thought to include locally concentrating reactions, sequestration of biomolecules, and cytoso-35 lic concentration buffering [1][2]. These structures form when biopolymers, often a combination of36 RNA and protein, undergo a phase transition into a more concentrated liquid-like or gel-like state37 [3]. Specific protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions within these memebraneless38 organelles produce micro-structures which affect dynamics within biomolecular condensates [4, 5].39 Biomolecular condensate micro-structure and dynamics are expected to define their reaction kinet-40 ics, molecular size filtering, and composition [2]. Increased understanding of the connection between41 the molecular interactions of condensate components and condensate structure and dynamics is fun-42 damental to understanding their biochemical role within the cell and also key to their application43 in bioengineering.44\n45 One class of proteins, the DEAD-box helicase, has gained recent appreciation for the role it may46 play in regulating biomolecular condensate structure and dynamics [6\u20138]. DEAD-box helicases re-47 model RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions in an ATP-dependent manner [9, 10]. DEAD-box48 helicases have been identified as important for a variety of cellular processes such as mRNA nuclear49 export, RNA splicing, mRNA cap recognition, and ribosome assembly [10]. They are also believed to50 regulate condensate formation through their enzyme activity and they may additionally be capable51 of regulating the material state of condensates [6]. Mutating DEAD-box helicases within cells often52 results in aberrant host condensate localization, morphology, and dynamics [11\u201313]. Furthermore,53 mutations associated with human DEAD-box helicase DDX3 driven diseases such as medullablas-54 toma and DDX3 syndrome also promote abberant stress granule formation in human cells [14, 15].55 An open question remains whether this class of proteins impacts condensate dynamics via their56 interactions with single-stranded RNA, unwinding duplexed RNA, or a combination of these two57 activities. DEAD-box helicase ssRNA clamping has been proposed to induce gel-like condensates58 based on in vivo experiments, though we still lack direct evidence for this phenomenon beyond dis-59 rupted biomolecular dynamics [6, 7, 11, 16].60\n61 We address the role of ATP-dependent ssRNA binding using a model condensate forming DEAD-62 box helicase, LAF-1. The LAF-1 protein is a C. elegans DEAD-box helicase orthologous to human63 DDX3, S. cerevisiae Ded1p, and D. melanogaster Belle, and localizes to the P granule condensate in64 C. elegans germ cells and embryos [17, 18]. LAF-1 can phase separate in vitro to form condensates65 with liquid-like properties which incorporate RNA and whose properties depend on RNA length66 [19\u201321]. However the influence of LAF-1 enzymatic activity and nucleotide-binding on the material67 properties of the condensates it forms remains unstudied.68\n69 To understand the role of LAF-1\u2019s ATP hydrolysis in determining condensate dynamics, we charac-70 terize how a LAF-1 mutant alters condensate biomolecular dynamics and material properties in the71 presence of ATP and single-stranded RNA. Our results suggest the effect on condensate dynamics72 is the result of the time it spends in the midst of its ATPase cycle as opposed to the lower overall73 ATP turnover. We then gain mechanistic insight by comparing changes in protein versus RNA dy-74 namics within the condensed phase. Through varying RNA length, we observe a dramatic increase75 in effective viscosity for the mutant helicase relative to the wildtype enzyme which correlates with a76 slowdown in RNA mobility and changes in protein diffusion mode, strongly implying a crosslinking77 mechanism. Lastly, we show the effects on material properties and biomolecular dynamics are titrat-78 able with ATP concentration, with a transition point consistent with the helicase\u2019s ATP binding79 thermodynamics. These results both demonstrate a mode by which a commonly studied DEAD-80\nbox mutation affects condensate properties and shed light on a general mechanism for generating81 micro-scale structure within biomolecular condensates via interaction lifetimes, relevant for both82 bioengineering and human health and disease.83\n2 Results and Discussion84\n2.1 A Mutant Trapped in an ATP-Bound Intermediate Alters Condensate Dynamics85 and Material Properties86\nWhile LAF-1 has been shown to phase separate in the presence or absence of RNA, the behavior of87 LAF-1 condensates in the presence of nucleotide has not been previously described [19, 21]. To assess88 how nucleotides and ATP hydrolysis affects the microenvironment of LAF-1 condensates containing89 RNA, we purified LAF-1WT and two LAF-1 mutants whose mutations within the catalytic ATPase90 domain have been studied for their effects on ATP binding and hydrolysis in other DEAD-box he-91 licases. LAF-1 (E398A), LAF-1DAAD, was expected to have decreased ATPase activity through an92 inability to efficiently enter into its ATPase cycle [16, 22, 23]. LAF-1 (E398Q), LAF-1DQAD, was93 expected to have severely impeded ATP hydrolysis activity due to an inability to release the prod-94 ucts of ATP hydrolysis, resulting in the formation of long-lived LAF-1DQAD-RNA complexes in the95 presence of ATP [11, 24]. We confirmed decreased ATPase activity in these mutants via a kinetic96 assay measuring phosphate release in the presence of ssRNA (Figure S1). All three variants are97 capable of forming condensates in the presence of the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) poly-uridylic98 acid (PolyU) and ATP or ADP.99\n100 To assess whether the LAF-1 catalytic substitutions affected condensate dynamics, we utilized fluo-101 rescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Condensates with fluorescently labelled PolyU RNA102 and protein were prepared in the presence of ADP or ATP (Figure 1c). Small regions composing103 \u2264 20% of the condensate volume were photobleached, and the recovery dynamics measured (Figure104 1d). Recovery curves were normalized relative to initial droplet intensity, bleach spot intensity,105 and droplet intensity far from the bleach spot (Supplementary Information) [25]. All three LAF-1106 variants exhibit similar protein FRAP behavior in the presence of ADP (Figure S2a). When ATP is107 present instead, the LAF-1WT and LAF-1DAAD variants behave similarly to one another and to their108 counterpart systems with ADP (Figure 1e). However, the LAF-1DQAD system exhibits a drastic109 change in protein dynamics in the presence of PolyU and ATP (Figure 1e). At short timescales, there110 is fluorescence recovery with a similar timescale to the other variants, but to a much lesser extent.111 There is also a slower recovery timescale that allows the LAF-1DQAD protein to recover to roughly112 same final extent as the other variants. Protein recovery dynamics for all variants in the presence113 of ADP were fit to a single exponential, as were the dynamics of LAF-1WT and LAF-1DAAD in the114 presence of ATP (Figure 1f). For the LAF-1DQAD variant with ATP, we fit the protein recovery dy-115 namics to a double exponential to capture both recovery timescales (Figure 1f). The short timescale116 recovery dynamics of the LAF-1DQAD system with ATP matches the timescale of the other variants117 with either nucleotide. The second, longer timescale is over an order of magnitude greater than this118 fast timescale behavior. The emergence of a second timescale in the LAF-1DQAD FRAP raises the119 possibility that this slower state corresponds to its clamped state on RNA.120\n121 If the second timescale in the LAF-1DQAD protein FRAP data corresponds to the clamped state, it122 should track with the diffusion of RNA within the system. We next examined the FRAP response123 of labelled PolyU RNA within the different LAF-1 systems in the presence of ATP or ADP (Figure124 1g and Figure S2b). We fit the curves to single exponentials and extracted recovery timescale and125 mobile fraction fit parameters (Figure 1j). LAF-1WT and LAF-1DAAD have similar RNA FRAP re-126 sponses in the presence of ATP and ADP, and are similar to one another. LAF-1DQAD has a similar127 RNA FRAP response to the other variants in the presence of ADP. However, when ATP is present,128\nbut not slowed ATPase mutant LAF-1DAAD experiences altered dynamics in the presence of ATP. Two timescales are apparent in LAF-1DQAD recovery, with the faster timescale matching that of LAF-1WT . g) FRAP curves and h) extracted fit parameters for PolyU RNA in LAF-1-PolyU condensates indicate over an order of magnitude decrease in RNA diffusion in clamp-like LAF-1DQAD condensates in the presence of ATP. i) Tracking of fluorescent tracer particles in biomolecular condensates to measure rheological properties j) and k) Mean squared displacement plots for beads embedded in LAF-1-PolyU condensates indicate altered material properties for clamp-like mutant LAF-1DQAD in the presence of ATP, with diffusive, fluid-like dynamics for all other conditions.\nthe recovery timescale increases by over an order of magnitude (ADP: 9.0s, ATP: 250s) while the129 RNA mobile fraction remained roughly the same (ADP: 0.77, ATP: 0.80). This single timescale130 visible in the RNA recovery dynamics is roughly comparable to the second, longer timescale visible131 in the LAF-1DQAD protein recovery dynamics suggesting the slow protein timescale corresponds to132 a LAF-1DQAD species clamped to RNA.133\n134 Though both LAF-1DAAD and LAF-1DQAD have impeded ATPase activity, only LAF-1DQAD expe-135 riences any change in biomolecular dynamics, and only when in the presence of ATP. This indicates136 that the changes in biomolecular dynamics are likely due to the trapped conformation of LAF-1DQAD137 bound to RNA and ATP hydrolysis products, as opposed to simply decreased ATPase activity [11].138 Furthermore, the appearance of a second timescale within the LAF-1DQAD diffusion dynamics in139 the presence of ATP, which matches the RNA diffusion timescale of the system, also suggests that140 the LAF-1DQAD protein might be travelling with the RNA in this slower diffusion mode. The signif-141 icant slowdown of RNA mobility within the LAF-1DQAD condensates also poses the possibility that142 the LAF-1DQAD proteins trapped on the RNA may be acting as RNA crosslinkers within the system.143\n144 If crosslinking is occurring, there should be corresponding changes in the material properties of LAF-145 1DQAD condensates. Point tracking microrheology has been used to study biomolecular condensate146 rheology previously, including for the LAF-1 system [19\u201321, 26]. We embedded PEG-passivated147 fluorescent tracer particles with a 100nm diameter in LAF-1 condensates during condensate forma-148 tion, and measured bead positions over time (Figure 1i). From these trajectories, we calculated149 the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the beads and took a time-ensemble average over beads150 within individual droplets (Supplementary Information). In this way, we measured MSDs for beads151 in condensates of each of the three LAF-1 variants with PolyU RNA and ADP or ATP (Figure 1l152 and 1m). Beads in condensates of all three variants with PolyU RNA and ADP behave quite simi-153 larly (Figure 1j). The curves are diffusive in the long time limit, consistent with fluid-like behavior,154 and the subdiffusive behavior at short times can be accounted for through a constant noisefloor155 contribution (Supplementary Information). When ATP is present, though beads in the LAF-1WT156 and LAF-1DAAD behave similarly and diffusively, bead dynamics within the LAF-1DQAD system are157 effectively arrested over the course of their trajectories (Figure 1k). The slowly hydrolyzable ATP158 analog ATP\u03b3S does not elicit any difference in material properties for LAF-1WT when compared to159 ADP or ATP, providing an additional indication that ATPase activity itself is not responsible for160 the changes in condensate material properties seen with LAF-1DQAD (Figure S3). Thus the effects161 seen at the macromolecular scale via FRAP are recapitulated in a substantial change in the material162 properties of LAF-1DQAD condensates.163\n2.2 RNA Length Dependent Material Properties Reveals Hydrogel-like Properties of164 LAF-1DQAD Condensates165\nWe next sought to gain better insight into the material effects of the LAF-1DQAD mutation. Because166 varying concentration of biomolecules in condensates is not straightforward, due to the tendency for167 liquid-liquid phase separated systems to buffer concentrations, many of the traditional concentration-168 based experiments to probe polymer-based materials were not possible. Instead, we systematically169 varied RNA length in order to assess scaling relationships between RNA length and condensate170 material state. The RNA size distribution for the initial polydisperse PolyU sample was measured171 via capillary electrophoresis (Figure 2a). We fragmented the PolyU sample using magnesium and172 heat to generate samples with progressively shorter mean fragment sizes (Figure 2a). Point tracking173 microrheology experiments were conducted using the resulting RNA samples, keeping the weight174 fraction of RNA constant for all conditions. We then compared MSDs for beads inside LAF-1WT175 and LAF-1DQAD condensates in the presence of 5mM ATP (Figure 2b and Figure 2c). Beads within176 the wildtype condensate do not experience a significant change in their MSDs for the shorter length177 distributions, but at the longest mean RNA length the MSD is lower at all time-lags. The MSDs178\nfor all lengths are well described by a power law scaling exponent of 1. For all RNA lengths in179 the LAF-1DQAD mutant system with ATP, the bead MSDs are slower than their counterparts in180 the LAF-1WT condensates and also much more sensitive to RNA length. While the beads exhibit181 diffusive motion in LAF-1DQAD condensates with the four shortest RNA length distributions, the182 longest RNA length sample results in severely slowed bead dynamics where positional fluctuations183 are indistinguishable from noise. The slower bead dynamics and higher length sensitivity of bead184 MSDs in the LAF-1DQAD system suggested that the underlying material state of the system was185 changing in response to crosslinking by LAF-1DQAD.186\n187 To substantiate that the material state of the LAF-1DQAD system differed from LAF-1WT in the188 presence of ATP, we assessed the relationship between RNA length and viscosity. For those MSDs189 that exhibited diffusive scaling with time-lag, we extracted effective viscosities using the General-190 ized Stokes Einstein Relation (Supplementary Information). Though the systems with ATP are191 not in equilibrium, Van Hove correlation plots and velocity autocorrelation plots do not suggest192 active transport of the passive particles is occurring and thus we believe extraction of an effective193 viscosity is appropriate (Figure S4). A sharp increase in effective viscosity occurs for LAF-1DQAD194\nfor condensates containing RNA lengths longer than 250 nucleotides (Figure 2d). Both variants195 produce condensates with similar RNA-length-dependent effective viscosities in the absence of ATP196 (Figure S5). We observe no substantial changes in partitioning of biological macromolecules as a197 function of RNA length or ATP concentration (Figure S6). The sharp increase in effective viscosity198 as a function of RNA length (Figure 2d) is consistent with a near critical gel. Longer RNA lengths199 should support the formation of exponentially larger complexes in the presence of crosslinking. In200 such systems, as increasing cluster size begins to approach the percolation threshold for the system,201 a corresponding dramatic increase in viscosity is observed [27, 28]. We cannot rule out the possi-202 bility of larger crosslinked protein-RNA complexes becoming entangled as the source of the jump203 in effective viscosity. However, this is not necessarily incompatible with our model of RNA-RNA204 crosslinking facilitated by LAF-1DQAD and would similarly result in hydrogel-like material proper-205 ties [31].206\n207\n2.3 RNA Length Dependent Biomolecular Dynamics Indicates Formation of208 Supramolecular Complexes209\nWe next wanted to examine the molecular basis for crosslinking by examining biomolecular diffusion210 within the condensates as a function of RNA length. We measured FRAP curves for labelled LAF-1211 protein (Figure 3 a and b) and end-labelled PolyU RNA (Figure 3 d and e) in either LAF-1WT212 or LAF-1DQAD condensates using the different RNA fragment distributions. For LAF-1WT protein213 FRAP, the recovery curves are well fit by a single exponential and the timescale of recovery is shown214 in Figure 3d. For LAF-1DQAD protein FRAP, two timescales are apparent in the recovery dynamics215 and we fit the curves to a double exponential. The shorter fit timescale matches well with that of216 the LAF-1WT protein and was insensitive to RNA length (Figure 3d). The second timescale is larger217 by at least an order of magnitude from the first and increases with increasing RNA length. This218 is consistent with a model whereby a portion of the population of the LAF-1DQAD molecules are219 diffusing freely, resulting in a timescale similar to the LAF-1WT molecules. The second population of220 LAF-1DQAD forms a long lived complex with RNA such that this second timescale is a combination221 of the RNA diffusion timescale and the release timescale off of the RNA. This second timescale is222 thus expected to increase with RNA length, consistent with our data (Figure 3g).223\n224 We expected that the RNA length dependence of the slower timescale in LAF-1DQAD\u2019s diffusion225 should then correlate with RNA diffusion timescales. We measured the RNA FRAP timescales for226 the different fragment lengths in LAF-1WT and LAF-1DQAD condensates in the presence of ATP227 (Figure 3 d and e). The curves were fit to single exponentials, yielding recovery timescales which228 increase with RNA length for both variants (Figure 3 f). However, the scaling relationship between229 length and RNA recovery timescale is much higher for the LAF-1DQAD versus LAF-1WT . The230 scaling relationship for the wildtype is roughly that which would be expected for a dilute solution of231 RNA within the protein condensate [32]. The larger scaling relationship for the LAF-1DQAD mutant232 is consistent with the formation of supramolecular complexes due to protein facilitated crosslinking,233 such that the effective biomolecular size is larger than would be expected given the input molecules234 (Figure 3h). Importantly, the RNA FRAP timescales roughly match the slower timescale in the235 LAF-1DQAD protein FRAP, supporting the idea that the slower timescale in the protein FRAP236 corresponds to the RNA-clamped state of the protein. The plateau in the RNA FRAP timescale at237 very long RNA lengths could indicate that crosslinking of the entire system is accomplished above238 average RNA lengths of roughly 500 nucleotides and that the timescales above this point measure239 rearrangement timescales of the resulting gel.240\n2.4 Titratable Crosslinking with ATP Concentration in LAF-1DQAD Condensates241\nBecause the properties of the LAF-1DQAD were strongly dependent on the presence of ATP, we242 next determined whether titrating ATP concentration within the system produced tunable system243 properties. We first tested the ATP concentration-dependent FRAP properties of LAF-1 protein244 and full-length PolyU RNA for the LAF-1DQAD variant. Protein FRAP curves for LAF-1DQAD and245 full length PolyU RNA as a function of ATP concentration are shown in Figure 4a. For MgATP246 concentrations above 0 mM the curves were fit to double exponentials, with the extracted recovery247 timescales and mobile fractions as a function of MgATP concentration shown in 4c and d. For248 the shorter timescale, representing the freely diffusing protein within the condensate, the recovery249 timescale remains approximately constant over the range of MgATP concentrations tested. This250 shorter timescale also matches well with the single-exponential fit timescale of the 0mM MgATP251 condition. The second, longer timescale in the FRAP dynamics increases monotonically with ATP252 concentration. As ATP is titrated into the system, more LAF-1DQAD becomes trapped onto RNA,253 resulting in larger RNA clusters and therefore a slower second FRAP recovery timescale.254\n255 The increase in the second timescale of LAF-1DQAD FRAP was expected to correspond to an in-256 crease in RNA FRAP recovery timescale. We also conducted FRAP experiments as a function of257 ATP concentration with labelled full length PolyU in LAF-1DQAD condensates (Figure 4b). These258 curves were fit to a single exponential, and we extracted the fit timescale and mobile fraction de-259 picted as a function of ATP concentration (Figure 4d). The mobile fraction is relatively insensitive260 to ATP concentration, however the RNA recovery timescale monotonically increases as function of261 ATP concentration. This RNA recovery timescale-ATP concentration relationship strongly resem-262 bles the relationship and magnitude of the LAF-1DQAD protein\u2019s longer recovery timescale. This is263 consistent with a model whereby increasing ATP concentration results in an increase in the fraction264 of LAF-1DQAD engaged in a clamp like state along the ssRNA. An increase in clamped proteins re-265 sults in enhanced crosslinking within the system, which then results in slower average protein-RNA266 complex mobility (Figure 4f).267\n268 If ATP-induced crosslinking was increasing effective macromolecular sizes, we anticipated that such269 ATP-dependent changes in biomolecular mobility would translate to material properties of the270 droplets. We performed single particle tracking of beads embedded in the LAF-1 condensates,271 using an intermediate RNA length of roughly 310 nucleotides and a range of ATP concentrations.272 LAF-1WT condensates experience a slight increase in MSD as ATP increases, likely primarily due273 to ATP\u2019s hydrotropic properties as opposed to any active transport (Figure 4g, Figure S4) [33]. In274 contrast, beads within LAF-1DQAD condensates experience a decrease in dynamics as ATP concen-275 tration increases, with a sharp drop in MSD at ATP concentrations above 50 \u00b5M Figure(4g). As all276 MSD curves were roughly linear in the long time limit, we extracted effective viscosities for LAF-277 1WT and LAF-1DQAD condensates (Figure 4h). Upon increasing ATP concentration, we observe a278 progressive drop in effective viscosity for LAF-1WT condensates while LAF-1DQAD droplets exhibit279 a transition from low effective viscosity to high effective viscosity, reminiscent of the behavior seen in280 the FRAP data (Figure 4h. No heterogeneity is seen in the tracking data indicating either crosslink281 strength is homogeneously increasing or crosslink spacing is well below the bead size. The behavior282 in the LAF-1DQAD effective viscosity data resembles a hyperbolic relationship between ATP and283 effective viscosity, as would be expected if the ATP response followed the ATP binding thermo-284 dynamics of LAF-1. Upon fitting the LAF-1DQAD effective viscosity data to a Hill equation with285 Hill coefficient of 1, the effective dissociation constant is 0.89mM (+/- 0.83mM), consistent with286 previously reported DEAD-box ATPase KM data for other DEAD-box helicases in the presence of287 RNA as well as the KM for the LAF-1\nWT ATPase reaction (Figure S1) [34]. Taken together, this288 suggests that ATP binding by the LAF-1DQAD protein can be utilized to construct condensates with289 desired RNA mobilities and material properties. Additionally, these results demonstrate that ap-290 preciable changes in condensate properties can be achieved with only a small proportion of proteins291\nin a clamp-like state. This is the case in biological systems where any particular mutant DEAD-box292 helicase composes a minority of the total proteins in a given condensate, yet substantial effects on293 condensates are still observed with DQAD mutant helicases [11, 16, 35].294\n3 Conclusion295\nDEAD-box helicases have emerged as critical regulators of biomolecular condensates [6]. Here we296 contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how modulating DEAD-box helicase-RNA complex297 lifetimes changes condensate microstructure and dynamics. We show that the DEAD-box helicase298 DQAD amino acid substitution enables protein-mediated crosslinking of RNA in the presence of299 ATP. This has consequences for both protein and RNA diffusion within the condensed phase as well300 as the condensate material state. There are also strong indications that the system approaches a301 gel transition as RNA length is increased to lengths comparable to eukaryotic mRNA. Lastly, we302 demonstrate this crosslinking effect can be harnessed to produce condensates with desired properties303 in accordance with nucleotide concentration. The range over which the system exhibits sensitivity304 to ATP concentration is highly relevant for biological systems and suggests the LAF-1DQAD system305 can be harnessed for engineering biomaterials in vivo and in vitro.306\n307 Our work shows that amino acid substitutions which enhance helicase-RNA interactions can crosslink308 condensate RNA. In addition to helicase mutation, adaptor proteins may elicit helicase clamp-like309 states to produce crosslinking in cellular condensates [36\u201338]. DEAD-box helicases that have longer310 lived protein-RNA interactions as part of their wildtype activity may also exhibit crosslinking be-311 havior as part of their function, and be fluidized by adaptors which accelerate progress through312 their ATPase cycle [6, 7, 10]. It may also be possible to elicit a clamp like state via pharmacological313 methods to crosslink a target biomolecular condensate containing DEAD-box helicases [39, 40]. Im-314 portantly, our data suggest a general mechanism for regulating and tuning biomolecular condensate315 dynamics via nonequilibrium molecular interaction lifetimes, extending beyond DEAD-box helicases.316\n317 In addition to coupling ATP binding and hydrolysis to RNA binding and release, DEAD-box he-318 licases utilize this ATPase cycle to unwind duplexed RNA and remodel protein-RNA complexes319 [10]. This unwinding activity should have implications for condensate dynamics as high degrees of320 base-pairing decrease biomolecular mobility within condensates [5]. Here we show RNA binding321 has significant effects, but the interplay between crosslinking and unwinding and their integrated322 effects on condensate dynamics is unclear. Thus our results demonstrate the need to decouple RNA323 binding and unwinding activity when considering the effects of DEAD-box helicase mutations and324 ATP analogs on observed condensate phenotypes. Future work will focus on the involvement of325 dsRNA and unwinding activity in modulating condensate dynamics to produce a complete picture326 for DEAD-box helicases and their role as master regulators of biomolecular condensates.327\n4 Methods and Materials328\n4.1 LAF-1 Cloning, Expression, and Purification329\nThe LAF-1 protein coding sequence was ordered as a gBlock Gene Fragment (TM) and inserted into330 a pET28a(+) vector from Novagen. The LAF-1 mutants E398A (DAAD) and E398Q (DQAD) were331 developed using around the horn site-directed mutagenesis of the wildtype sequence and similarly332 inserted into pET28a(+) vectors. Each construct contained a C-terminal His6-tag.333\n334 Each of the LAF-1 variants was transformed, expressed, and purified as described previously [19].335 Briefly, each variant recombinantly expressed and purified from BL21(DE3) cells. The recombinant336\nproteins were then purified using nickel affinity chromatography and heparin affinity chromatogra-337 phy. Purified protein was then dialyzed into storage buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1M NaCl, 10% v/v338 glycerol, 2 mM DTT), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80\u25e6C until use. See supplemen-339 tary text for more information.340\n341 Before use, protein aliquots were thawed at room temperature and buffer exchanged into high salt342 buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1M NaCl, 1 mM DTT) using a 10 kDa cutoff centrifugal filter.343\n4.2 RNA Fragmentation and Capillary Electrophoresis344\nThe ssRNA analog Polyuridylic acid (PolyU) was aquired from Sigma Aldrich and stored as a345 stock at 10 mg/mL in nuclease free water. Heat and magnesium was used to generate shorter346 RNA fragments from this PolyU sample, using the NEBNext Magnesium Fragmentation Module.347 Following fragmentation and reaction quenching, the RNA was isolated and free nucleotides removed348 using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit. RNA was eluted using 14.5 \u00b5L of nuclease free water, resulting349 in RNA concentrations of between 300 and 750 ng/\u00b5L. To verify fragment size distributions, capillary350 electrophoresis was performed on an AATI Femto Pulse.351\n4.3 Fluorescent Labelling352\nLAF-1 protein was fluorescently labelled using Dylight-633 NHS Ester during purification, following353 elution from the heparin column. The protein was dialyzed into labelling buffer (100 mM phosphate354 buffer pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 2mM DTT, 1% v/v glycerol), concentrated to roughly 1 mg/mL, and355 labelled according to the manufacturers specifications. Excess dye was removed using Pierce dye356 removal columns. The protein was then dialyzed into storage buffer and then flash frozen. During357 use, labelled protein composed roughly 1% of the overall protein sample.358\n359 PolyU RNA was 3\u2019-end labelled with fluorescein as described in Zearfoss et al. (2012) [41]. For360 labelling fragmented RNA, smaller elution volumes were used during the RNA cleanup step in order361 to provide the recommended starting concentrations for 3\u2019-end labelling.362\n4.4 Fluorescence Microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching363\nFluorescence imaging was performed on an Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with an An-364 dor iXon 897E EM-CCD camera, a Yokugawa CSU-X1 Spinning Disk Confocal Scan Head, and an365 Andor FRAPPA photomanipulation system. A 100x Nikon objective with a numerical aperature of366 1.4 was used for all fluorescence imaging. LAF-1 condensates were formed in buffer containing 20367 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 200 mM NaCl, along with 0.075 mg/mL PolyU RNA of various lengths and368 variable nucleotide concentration. Droplets were incubated for 8 minutes at room temperature and369 then transferred into a PDMS chamber adhered to a slide and pre-passivated with 2% w/v Pluoronic370 F-127. For FRAP experiments, a spot size of 3 pixels, corresponding to roughly 0.42 \u00b5m, was used371 for photobleaching.372\n373 Analysis of FRAP timecourses was performed using custom packages written in MATLAB and374 incorporated feature finding scripts from Maria Kilfoil\u2019s MATLAB Point Tracking Software (Sup-375 plementary Information).376\n4.5 Point Tracking Microrheology377\n100nm Diameter carboxy-coated fluorescent microspheres were obtained from ThermoFisher and378 passivated using mPEG-750 as described in Valentine et al. (2004) [42]. LAF-1 condensates were379 formed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 200 mM NaCl, along with 0.075 mg/mL PolyU380 RNA of various lengths, variable nucleotide concentration, and the passivated fluospheres. Droplets381\nwere incubated for 8 minutes at room temperature before being briefly centrifuged and then trans-382 ferred into a PDMS chamber adhered to a slide and pre-passivated with 2% w/v Pluoronic F-127.383 Condensates larger than 5 \u00b5m and containing more than five beads were imaged using a custom384 built fluorescence microscope equipped with a 561 nm Coherent laser, 100x Nikon 1.45NA oil ob-385 jective, and an Andor iXon Ultra EMCCD detector. Image series were taken at a framerate of 100386 milliseconds using < 20 mW laser power.387\n388 Feature identification, filtering, and trajectory construction was performed using a MATLAB soft-389 ware package from Maria Kilfoil\u2019s research group [43, 44]. Trajectory analyses such as mean squared390 displacement, Van Hove correlation, non-Gaussian parameter, and velocity autocorrelation were391 performed using custom scripts in MATLAB (Supplementary Information).392\n5 Acknowledgements393\nWe would like to thank Peter Foster for helpful discussions throughout this project, Yoon Jung for394 assembly and maintenance of our in-house fluorescence microscope, and James White for reviewing395 the manuscript.

            "text": "LAF-1 was expressed and purified as in Elbaum-Garfinkle et al. (2016). The LAF-1 coding sequence with a C-terminal 6x-Histidine tag was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells on LB Agar plates containing 50ug/mL Kanamycin for selection. Single colonies were transferred to 5mL starter cultures of LB media containing 50ug/mL Kanamycin and grown at 37\u25e6C overnight. Starter cultures were transferred to 1L LB Kanamycin media the next morning and grown at 37\u25e6C until the OD600 was between 0.2 and 0.4. For induction, 1mM IPTG was then added to the cultures and the flasks were transferred to room temperature for an additional 16 hours. Cells were spun down at 8,000 x g, 4\u25e6C for 5 minutes, the supernatant removed, and pellets stored at -20\u25e6C.\nOn the day of purification, 1L cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 50 mL of Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 10% v/v glycerol) containing 14 mM betamercaptoethanol (BME) and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche). Lysozyme was added to 100 \u00b5 g/mL and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The lysate was then sonicated on ice with a tip sonicator at 15% amplitude for 5 minutes a\u0302\u20ac\u201c 15 seconds on 30 seconds off, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature.

The column was then washed with 50 mL of nickel wash buffer before the sample was eluted with 30 mL of nickel elution buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 14 mM BME, 10% v/v glycerol) in 500 \u00b5L fractions. Fractions were tested for their absorbance at 260 and 280 nm and fractions of interest were analyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel before being combined.\nThe nickel eluate was then diluted 5x with Heparin loading buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1% v/v glycerol) and loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin column (GE LifeSciences) which had been preequilibrated with 30 mL of Heparin loading buffer. Prior to dilution with\nHeparin loading buffer, the sample was diluted with Nickel Elution buffer to less than 1 \u00b5M such that the LAF-1 protein would not undergo phase separation in the Heparin loading buffer. The loaded column was washed with 50 mL of Heparin loading buffer and the sample was then eluted with 30 mL of Heparin Elution Buffer (20 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1% v/v glycerol). Fraction absorbance was read at 260 and 280 nm, fractions of interest were analyzed on an SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing recombinant LAF-1 were pooled together.\nFor storage, the sample was dialyzed twice in 500 mL of Storage Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1M NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 2mM DTT). Samples were concentrated to a protein concentration of between 8 and 12 uM and then 50 \u00b5L aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots were stored at -80\u25e6C.\nAll LAF-1 variants were purified as above. The LAF-1DQAD variant copurified strongly with RNA during the nickel affinity purification step, but the A260/A280 ratio dropped to normal levels following heparin affinity purification."
