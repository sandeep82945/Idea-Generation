"The findings of this systematic review have several implications for research. We have identified strategies that are less frequently used and strategies that do not have supportive evidence, which offer opportunities for future research. This includes physical strategies (massage, acupuncture, and exercise), psychological strategies, (yoga, rest, and psychotherapy), and self-initiated strategies (doing nothing, diet change, and dietary supplements). Research to establish evidence to support their use will be helpful in updating guidelines and helping optimize patient care when managing migraines. Limited recommendations for non-pharmacological strategies could be due to the current lack of studies that focus on non-pharmacological strategies. US and European guidelines focused mainly on pharmacological management, although non-pharmacological managements have a role for individuals with migraine. Therefore, more research is needed to address the lack of guidelines for non-pharmacological strategies for managing migraine."
