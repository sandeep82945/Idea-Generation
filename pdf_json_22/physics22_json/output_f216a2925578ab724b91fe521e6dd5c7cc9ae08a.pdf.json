    "abstractText": "The precise characterization and measurement of new nanomaterials and nano devices require in situ SEM nanorobotic instrumentation systems, which put forward further technical requirements on nanopositioning techniques of compact structure, cross-scale, nanometer accuracy, high vacuum and non-magnetic environment compatibility, etc. In this work, a novel cross-scale nanopositioning stage was proposed, which combined the advantages of piezoelectric stick-slip positioner and piezoelectric scanner techniques and adopted the idea of macro/micro positioning. A new structure design of a single flexible hinge shared by a small and large PZT was proposed to effectively reduce the size of the positioning stage and achieve millimeter stroke and nanometer motion positioning accuracy. Then, the cross-scale motion generation mechanism of the dual piezoelectric stick-slip drive was studied, the system-level dynamics model of the proposed positioning stages was constructed, and the mechanism design was optimized. Further, a prototype was manufactured and a series of experiments were carried out to test the performance of the stage. The results show that the proposed positioning stage has a maximum motion range of 20 mm and minimum step length of 70 nm under the small piezoceramic ceramic macro-motion stepping mode, and a maximum scanning range of 4.9 \u03bcm and motion resolution of 16 nm under the large piezoceramic ceramic micro-motion scanning mode. Moreover, the proposed stage has a compact structure size of 30 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 8 mm3, with a maximum motion speed of 10 mm/s and maximum load of 2 kg. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed stage, and nanometer positioning resolution, high accuracy, high speed, and a large travel range were achieved, which demonstrates that the proposed stage has significant performance and potential for many in situ SEM nanorobotic instrument systems.",

The precise characterization and measurement of these new nano materials and devices are challenging tasks that need in situ SEM (scanning electron microscope) nanorobotic instrument systems [5\u20138]. These systems, such as the nanomanipulation system, AFM (atomic force microscope), and nanoindentation instrument, etc. [9], are required to move, manipulate, and characterize micro-nano objects in the SEM of compact and vacuum environments. One of the key technical challenges of the nanorobotic systems is the need for cross-scale nanopositioning technology with a compact structure and compatible with a high vacuum\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2008. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13112008 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2008 2 of 19\nenvironment. Therefore, cross-scale nanopositioning with millimeter stroke, nanometer resolution and positioning accuracy, and large motion velocity has been a hot research topic. Currently, technologies that can achieve cross-scale nanopositioning with millimeter stroke and nanometer resolution include the macro-micro dual drive principle, inchworm drive principle, a piezoelectric ultrasonic motor, and stick-slip drive principle [10\u201317]. Among them, the size of the inchworm drive principle structure is larger, and control is more complicated, and it is not easy to integrate into the SEM [18]. The stick-slip drive principle has the advantages of high resolution, compact structure, large displacement stroke, vacuum compatibility, no electromagnetic interference, and no heat generation [19]. However, due to its own technical characteristics, the difference between the sliding friction force and maximum static friction force of the contact surface forms multiple cycles to control the displacement of the object, which is mostly used for positioning between two points. During this process, jitter is generated. After the actuator is amplified, it even generates a micrometer-level amplitude, and cannot perform nanometer-level steady-state motion. Similarly, the piezoelectric ultrasonic motor utilizes vibration to generate displacement, which is also easy to cause this phenomenon [20]. The macro-micro dual drive principle is composed of two motion states: fast \u201cmacro movement\u201d and precise \u201cmicro movement\u201d, which makes this technical form have a long movement range and fast response speed, and has attracted the attention of many scholars. A macro-micro dual-drive high-acceleration, high-precision XY positioning stage was proposed by Jie D et al. [21]. Macro motion uses a VCM (voice coil motor) to provide power input, and micro motion uses a PZT (piezoelectric ceramic transducer) to provide power input, which realizes high-speed movement in a space of 25 \u00d7 25 mm2, where acceleration exceeds 100 mm/s2 and the positioning accuracy in X and Y directions is better than 10 nm. However, the volume of this program is too large, according to the article that speculates on the choice of VCM; its size should be more than 150 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 100 mm3, and its \u201cmacro movement\u201d state is provided by VCM. It is easy to generate heat and generate electromagnetic interference, and it is not compatible with SEM. Many scholars have turned the macro-movement to the stick-slip drive principle, using the idea of combining macro-micro dual drive motion and the stick-slip drive principle instead of VCM drive, providing more possibilities for cross-scale nano-motion positioning. A two-dimensional manipulation stage driven by two PZT actuators in parallel was proposed by Yuki Shimizu et al. [22]. The straightness of the stage movement was ensured by a flexible piece, and a permanent magnet was used as the slider, which was a good solution to the problem of coupling interference of two-dimensional movement in the same driving plane. The stage can realize two-dimensional motion along the X-Y direction, and motion speed can reach 5 mm/s, with the size of 24 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 5 mm3, but effective strokes in the X and Y directions are only \u00b11 mm. An X and Y two-dimensional nanopositioning stage with large motion stroke and high resolution was proposed by Fujun Wang et al. [23]. They used a low coupling rate based on stick-slip drive using parallel decoupled drive units and a tandem configuration of sliders to achieve hybrid output decoupling. The bottom surface of the stage was a flexible hinge with X and Y two-dimensional coupling drive, and the PZTs were arranged as drive elements at the center of the four sides, respectively, and a jacking device was set up at the center of the stage to realize the decoupling of the motion in both directions and make the overall mechanism more compact. A simple, adjustment-free, and open-source XYZ nanopositioner developed by Hsien-Shun Liao et al. [24] utilized a magnet-based driving mechanism. The magnet simultaneously provided both a preload force and friction surface, resulting in a nanopositioner with compact size, low cost, easy assembly, and high-vacuum compatibility. The macro-micro dual drive principle requires the combination of two motion states; that is, two or more motion actuators are required, resulting in a large structure with a single-degree-of-freedom motion axis. Therefore, many scholars targeted their research to the two-level macro and micro motion combined nanopositioning stage, which can realize the macro motion of large strokes and micro motion of nanometer positioning resolution by delicate structures that separate and then couple the macro and micro motions. Though SEM compatible nanorobotic instrument systems are\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2008 3 of 19\nusually composed of one or more three-degree-of-freedom XYZ axis nanomanipulators, the above-mentioned traditional two-level macro and micro motion combined nanopositioning stage will lead to problems such as complex structure and large volume, control complexity, and poor adaptability of SEM of different vacuum chamber sizes and models. Therefore, monopole kinematic positioning technique compatible with a compact, cross-scale, nanopositioning, high vacuum, and non-magnetic environment is needed to solve the drawback stage. In this work, a novel cross-scale nanopositioning stage, based on a dual piezoelectric stick-slip driving stage principle is proposed, which applies the idea of the combined macro and micro motion positioning and stick-slip driving principle, by utilizing a small and large PZT as the \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201cmicro\u201d driver, respectively. The advantages of various cross-scale nano-motion positioning techniques, such as macro-micro, stick-slip, and piezoelectric scanning stages, are combined to achieve compact structure, cross-scale large stroke, and nanopositioning on a single axis. By studying the cross-scale motion generation mechanism of dual piezoelectric stick-slip drive, a system-level dynamics model of the motion positioning stage was constructed and the design of its mechanism was optimized. Finally, experiments were conducted on a prototype of the developed monopolar cross-scale nanopositioning stage. Nanometer positioning resolution, high accuracy, high speed, and large travel range were achieved, demonstrating that this stage has significant performance and potential in many in situ SEM nanorobotic instrument systems."

Analysis and Simulation of Flexible Hinge Structure The following three main factors affect the performance of the flexible hinge: the stiff-\nness, strength, and resonant frequency of the flexible hinge. i. Stiffness problem. Too little stiffness will increase the deformation under the preload\nforce affecting its life, reducing return speed, and lowering the dynamic response speed; too much stiffness will increase the resistance to the piezoelectric stack, and the output displacement transferred to the guide will be reduced, lowering the movement speed of the positioning stage.\nii. Strength problem. Flexible hinges mainly use the small deformation and self-return characteristics generated by elastic materials to improve the displacement resolution; too little strength will cause plastic deformation or even fatigue damage due to alternating loads.\niii. Resonant frequency problem. The PZT achieves periodic vibration under the excitation of a sawtooth wave voltage signal. If the working frequency of the PZT is greater than or equal to the frequency of any mode of the flexible hinge, it will cause the flexible hinge to produce a self-excitation or resonance phenomenon with the PZT, resulting in unstable stage motion. Therefore, the above three factors need to be simulated and analyzed to verify\nwhether the flexible hinge meets the requirements.\n3.4.1. Stiffness Analysis As the flexible hinge and the two PZTs have the same direction of transmission and drive, they can be regarded as an integrated structure. Therefore, the minimum stiffness of the two piezoelectric ceramics is 20 N/\u03bcm according to Table 1, which can be the stiffness standard of the flexible hinge. In this work, phosphor bronze was selected as the flexible hinge material because of its small density, good wear resistance, and high strength, among other advantages. The results of the stiffness simulation analysis are shown in Figure 9.

            "text": "The following three mai factors affect the performanc of the flexible hinge: the stiffness, strength, and resona t frequency of the flexible hinge.\ni. Stiffness problem. Too littl stiffness will increase the deformation under the preload force affecting its life, reducing return speed, and lowering the dynamic response speed; too much s iffness will ncr ase the resistance to the piezoelec ric stack, and the output displacement transf rred to the guide will be reduc d, low ring the movement speed of the positioning stage. ii. Strength problem. Flexible hinges mainly use the small d formation and self-return characteristics generated by elastic materials to improve the dis lacement resolution; too little strength will cause plastic deformation or even fatigue damage due to alternating loads. iii. Resonant frequency problem. The PZT achieves periodic vibration under the excitation of a sawtooth wave voltage signal. If the working frequency of the PZT is greater than or equal to the frequency of any mode of the flexible hinge, it will cause the flexible hinge to produce a self-excitation or resonance phenomenon with the PZT, resulting in unstable stage motion.\nTherefore, the above three factors need to be simulated and analyzed to verify whether the flexible hinge meets the requirements.\n3.4.1. Stiffness Analysis\nAs the flexible hinge and the two PZTs have the same direction of transmission and drive, they can be regarded as an integrated structure. Therefore, the minimum stiffness of the two piezoelectric ceramics is 20 N/\u00b5m according to Table 1, which can be the stiffness standard of the flexible hinge. In this work, phosphor bronze was selected as the flexible hinge material because of its small density, good wear resistance, and high strength, among other advantages. The results of the stiffness simulation analysis are shown in Figure 9. When a 50 N horizontal thrust was applied to the flexible hinge at the contact surface, the output displacement of the end of the flexible transmission member in the horizontal direction was 5.5767 \u00b5m. Calculated according to the simulation results, the stiffness of the transmission flexible hinge was 8.966 N/\u00b5m, which was less than the stiffness standard of the flexure hinge with 20 N/\u00b5m, and met the design requirements and ensured that the output displacement of the piezoelectric stack could be quickly transferred to the guide rail through the flexible transmission member with minimum displacement loss.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2008 10 of 19\nTable 1.

(a) Constructed stage and (b) experimental system for performance measurement.\nFirst, the \u201cmicro-motion\u201d function of the nanopositioning stage was tested, including the range of motion and resolution. Range of motion: The voltage applied by the large PZT was taken from 40 to 90 V. The test was repeated eight times, as shown in Figure 13a. The average value of the range of motion of the micromotion was 4.9 \u03bcm, which was different from the theoretical value of 5.5 \u03bcm, and the analysis was due to two reasons: (1) The PZT actuator acted on the flexible transmission and was also subject to its own reaction force, which hindered the output of the PZT displacement. (2) The output displacement of the PZT is transmitted to the guide through the drive transmission system and through the action of friction, which causes a loss of output displacement due to the presence of friction. Resolution: The experiment applied a sine wave signal to the positioning stage to test the resolution of the scanning mode of the positioning stage, setting the frequency at 1 Hz. The voltage started from 0 V and gradually increased with a gradient of 0.1 V until the voltage amplitude reached 0.6 V and the stage displacement output was stable, as shown in Figure 13b. The measured data were fitted to obtain the motion resolution of the positioning stage in the scanning mode of about 16 nm, which was better than the traditional piezoelectric stick-slip positioning stages, such as the stick-slip stage developed by Rakotondrabe et al., with resolution of 70 nm [28], and the commercialized stick-slip stage of model ANPX101 developed by Attocube System Inc., with a resolution of about 200 nm [29].\nFigure 12.

Before the step and speed test, we needed to test the influence of different driving signals (driving frequency, voltage amplitude, etc.) on the stick-slip drive, and the experimental results are shown in Figure 14. Eight groups were realized, and finally, the average value of the velocity was taken and plotted as the relationship curve in Figure 14c. The output displacement curve of the positioning stage under the action of the voltage signal with the driving frequency of 50 and 100 Hz is shown in Figure 14a,b, respectively.

Eight sets of experiments were conducted, and the average value of speed was finally drawn as Figure 14d. Analysis shows that the greater the frequency of the driving signal, the faster the motion frequency of the nanopositioning stage, and the greater the voltage amplitude, the longer the step length of the nanopositioning stage.

We further inputted a sawtooth wave signal with a frequency of 1 Hz and amplitude of 90 V to the\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2008 14 of 19\nsimulation model of Figure 4 to verify the correctness of the simulation method, as shown in Figure 15b. To analyze the effective output displacement of the positioning platform more intuitively, we further derived the simulation curve of the effective output displacement of the positioning stage, and the maximum average step size of the simulation result was 1.375 \u00b5m, as shown in Figure 15c. The correctness of the simulation model was verified. The minimum step: We applied a sawtooth wave voltage signal with a frequency of 1 Hz to the small PZT, and the initial voltage amplitude was set to 90 V. We reduced the size of the input voltage signal, in turn, until the minimum output displacement could be detected. When the minimum driving voltage of 10 V was detected, this output displacement was the minimum movement of the positioning stage. The displacement of 10 steps forward and 10 steps in reverse were 700 and 710 nm, respectively, as shown in Figure 15e,f. After calculation, the minimum step length forward and reverse was 70 and 71 nm, respectively. The displacement was more symmetrical and linearity was better. Maximum thrust: This is one of the important indexes to measure the performance of the positioning stage. Here, the electronic scale was chosen to measure the thrust, the maximum range was 2 kg, and the index value was 0.01 g. As shown in Figure 15d, at the beginning of the test, we ensured that one end of the positioning stage touched the electronic scale pallet. The positioning stage moved down to make electronic readings, and when the number displayed by the electronic scale reached the maximum and remained unchanged, the force at this time was taken as the maximum thrust.

Horizontal movement direction speed consistency: To detect the consistency of the forward and reverse movement speed of the positioning stage, as well as the difference, the positioning stage was driven by 50 Hz, with a 90 V sawtooth wave signal, and eight groups of forward movement data and eight groups of reverse movement data were obtained, as shown in Figure 15g. The experimental results are shown in Figure 15h; the speed consistency of the positioning stage in both forward and reverse motion was good. The reverse motion speed was slightly higher than the forward motion speed, mainly because the friction force between the guide rail and the flexible transmission parts was different in the forward and reverse motion of the positioning stage.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2008 15 of 19Micromachines 2022, 13, x 15 of 18\n(e) (f)\n(g) (h)\nFigure 15.

By adding different masses of weights on the guide rail, the masses were classified as 400 g, 800 g, 1.2 kg, 1.6 kg, and 2 kg. Setting the voltage amplitude of the driving signal to 90 V and the frequency to 1 KHz, the output displacement of the positioning stage in step mode at different loads was measured, and eight sets of data were obtained for each load quality experiment, as shown in Table 2. The output displacement of the positioning stage is plotted according to the data in Figure 16 and shows the relationship between the output displacement of the positioning stage and load quality. In order to more clearly express the influence of the load mass on the motion performance of the positioning stage in the horizontal direction, the average value of the output displacement of the positioning stage under each load mass was plotted as a histogram in Figure 16b. With an increase in the load mass, the output displacement of the positioning stage gradually decreased, and when the load mass increased from 1200 to 2000 g, the output displacement of the stage decreases from 0.7 to 0.28 \u03bcm, and the reduction was obvious. As there was a gap between the roller cage in the guide and the V-slide when the positioning stage was not subjected to a load, the output displacement decreased as the friction between the guide and flexible hinge increased with an increase in load. The forward motion speed of the positioning stage was collated with the load mass, as shown in Figure 16c. With an increasing load, the speed of the positioning stage gradually decreased, and when the load mass was 2 kg, the speed of the positioning stage was only 0.28 mm/s, so the maximum load capacity of the positioning stage was 2 kg, and the error was controllable. Continuing to increase the load would lead to a decrease in speed and difficult movement of the positioning stage.\nFigure 15.

With an increasing load, the speed of the positioning stage gradually decreased, and when the load mass was 2 kg, the speed of the positioning stage was only 0.28 mm/s, so the maximum load capacity of the positioning stage was 2 kg, and the error was controllable. Continuing to increase the load would lead to a decrease in speed and difficult movement of the positioning stage.\n(a) (b)\n(c)\nFigure 16.

            "text": "In order to meet the needs of advanced nanomaterials and structures in situ, researchers have used nano-manipulation and inspection instruments for precise and stable nanometer-scale motion accuracy, millimeter-scale motion stroke, vacuum non-magnetic compatibility, and compact form factor nano-positioning technology. We proposed a dual piezoelectric nano-motion positioning method using macro-micro combination, and a new compact cross-scale macro-micro combination dual piezoelectric stick slip monopole nano-motion positioning stage was constructed. The size of the nano-positioning stage was significantly reduced by integrating dual PZTs sharing a single flexible hinge mechanism. The experimental results showed that the positioning stage had a resolution of 16 nm in micro-motion mode, maximum micro-motion range of 4.9 \u00b5m, maximum step in macromotion mode of 0.9 \u00b5m, minimum step of 70 nm, maximum motion speed of 10 mm/s, maximum load of the positioning stage of 2 kg, and maximum motion range of 20 mm for the positioning needs of in-situ nano-operating instruments, such as nano-operating machines and AFMs compatible within the SEM. They provide a compact, cross-scale, nanoscale motion positioning, and vacuum non-magnetic compatible single-degree-offreedom motion positioning technology, giving a new monopole cross-scale nano-motion and positioning compact solution. It is noteworthy that the small PZT could output a displacement of 1.375 \u00b5m without preload, but the actual detection was only 0.9 \u00b5m. This is to ensure that the small PZT was not damaged during operation, so a certain size of preload was applied to it in the initial state to eliminate the gap between the ceramic and flexible transmission parts, so that the small PZT and flexible transmission parts were combined to form a second-order oscillation system. The output displacement was reduced under the action of the preload force. Secondly, the actual output displacement of the PZT was smaller than theoretical values due to the existence of the equivalent stiffness of the flexible hinge, as mentioned above. There are still some difficulties in the control and integration of the current nanopositioning stage, which should be addressed in future work. First, the \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201cmicro\u201d modes of the positioning stage are time-sharing and segmented control, and future work needs to softly control them, so that when a fixed position is given, the macro and micro movements can be smoothly and automatically switched through autonomous calculations, and the target point can be accurately and stably reached without jitter. Second, the positioning stage is currently an open-loop system with local step inconsistency. In the next study, we will consider designing the positioning stage as a closed-loop positioning system, choosing the scale as the displacement sensor to achieve real-time feedback of the displacement of the positioning stage. Finally, the positioning stage should be open to be compatible with multiple forms of mechanical interfaces to facilitate integration with a variety of nanopositioning stages.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.Z. and S.M.; data curation, Z.H.; formal analysis, J.Z., S.M. and Z.H.; funding acquisition, C.R.; investigation, J.Z., S.M. and Y.W.; project administration, M.P. and Y.W.; resources, M.P. and C.R.; supervision, C.R.; visualization, Y.W. and Z.H.; writing\u2014original draft, J.Z., S.M. and M.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.Z. and C.R.
