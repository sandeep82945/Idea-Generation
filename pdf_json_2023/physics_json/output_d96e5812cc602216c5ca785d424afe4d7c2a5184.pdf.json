    "abstractText": "Utilizing the Knoevenagel\u2013Michael tandem cyclocondensation reaction of barbituric acid/1,3\u2010 dimethylbarbituric acid, malononitrile, and aryl aldehydes, a sustainable methodology for the photosynthesis of pyrano[2,3\u2010d]pyrimidine scaffolds has been devised. The present study expounds on the development of a green radical synthetic approach toward this class of compounds. In this study, a novel halogenated dicyanobenzene\u2010based photosensitizer was utilized in an aqueous solution, exposed to air at room temperature, and activated by a blue LED as a renewable energy source for the purpose of generating energy. The primary aim of this endeavor is to employ a recently developed, easily obtainable, and affordably priced halogenated cyanoarene\u2010based donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A). The 3DPAFIPN [2,4,6\u2010tris(diphenylamino)\u20105\u2010fluoroisophthalonitrile]} photocatalyst, as a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), is capable of inducing single electron transfer (SET) upon irradiation with visible light, thereby offering a facile and efficient approach with a high degree of effectiveness, energy efficiency, and eco\u2010friendliness. The aforementioned phenomenon facilitates the exploration of the temporal changes that have occurred in the interactions between the surroundings and chemical constituents. The present study aimed to investigate the turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) for pyrano[2,3\u2010d]pyrimidine scaffolds. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that gram\u2010scale cyclization is a viable method for utilization in industrial applications.",

The present study expounds on the development of a green radical synthetic approach toward this class of compounds. In this study, a novel halogenated dicyanobenzene\u2011based photosensitizer was utilized in an aqueous solution, exposed to air at room temperature, and activated by a blue LED as a renewable energy source for the purpose of generating energy. The primary aim of this endeavor is to employ a recently developed, easily obtainable, and affordably priced halogenated cyanoarene\u2011based donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A). The 3DPAFIPN [2,4,6\u2011tris(diphenylamino)\u20115\u2011fluoroisophthalonitrile]} photocatalyst, as a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), is capable of inducing single electron transfer (SET) upon irradiation with visible light, thereby offering a facile and efficient approach with a high degree of effectiveness, energy efficiency, and eco\u2011friendliness. The aforementioned phenomenon facilitates the exploration of the temporal changes that have occurred in the interactions between the surroundings and chemical constituents. The present study aimed to investigate the turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) for pyrano[2,3\u2011d]pyrimidine scaffolds. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that gram\u2011scale cyclization is a viable method for utilization in industrial applications.\nIn contemporary literature, photoredox catalysis has been leveraged as an origin of pioneering methodologies within the domain of organic chemistry1\u20134. The field of photoredox catalysis, which involves the integration of metal-promoted reactions with photoredox cycles, has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry5. The strategic topic of research involves the utilization of inexpensive, readily synthesized, and efficient organic dyes to facilitate the development of novel, effective, and selective metal-promoted reactions6. Within this domain, the organic dyes must strive to supplant the extensively utilized inorganic complexes reliant upon Ir(III) and Ru(II). These complexes are notable for their protracted excited state durations, which may incline toward dynamic quenching when juxtaposed with organic molecules. Typically, organic dyes exhibit shorter excited state lifetimes, a significant impediment in the formulation of effective photoredox mechanisms. The scientific community has exhibited a significant interest in a distinct group of organic chromophores owing to their notable characteristics and effectiveness7. The molecules under consideration exhibit a unique characteristic known as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which is observed in molecules that have a negligible energy gap (typically less than 0.2\u00a0eV) between their lowest two excited states, i.e., S1 and T1. At ambient conditions, the phenomenon of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from the triplet excited state (T1) to the singlet excited state (S1) occurs in the molecules under consideration, facilitated by a thermally activated pathway. This results in the production of a delayed fluorescence phenomenon, which is commonly observed in such systems. The task at hand concerns the coupling of the notable efficiency of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) with the commendable quantum yield of fluorescence. The year 2012 saw a significant contribution to the field\nOPEN\nSchool of Engineering, Apadana Institute of Higher Education, Shiraz, Iran. email: mohamadpour.f.7@gmail.com\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:13142 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40360-w\nof organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the publication of a seminal paper by Adachi8. This paper reports on the successful development of dicyanobenzene molecules with desirable photophysical properties, and their demonstrated applications in OLEDs. Subsequent to these initial findings, analogous TADF chromophores have been implemented across diverse domains, such as photocatalysis7,9. Owing to the facile manipulability of their redox potentials and the protracted singlet excited states arising from TADF, isophthalonitriles represent a promising class of chromophores for deployment as organic photocatalysts, facilitating numerous chemical transformations10. The compound 2,4,6-tris(diphenylamino)-5-fluoroisophthalonitrile (3DPAFIPN) has been increasingly utilized in various synthetic procedures that are activated by visible light. Examples of such protocols include intramolecular cyclizations11,12 as well as the formation of C\u2013C13,14, N\u2013C15, and P\u2013C16 bonds5.\nOwing to its copious energy reserves, economical expense, and the potential to access sustainable energy sources, visible light irradiation is deemed to be a reliable method for synthesizing organic compounds17\u201319.\nIt is expected that pyranopyrimidines will demonstrate compelling pharmacological and biochemical characteristics such as an inhibitor of the antiallergic20, antihypertensive21, cardiotonic22, bronchiodilator23, antibronchitic24, and antitumor activities25.\nNumerous catalysts exhibit the capability to generate artificial pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine frameworks, such as DABCO-based ionic liquids26, L-proline27, iron ore pellet28, nano-sawdust-OSO3H29, Al-HMS-2030, TSA/ B(OH)331, Mn/ZrO232, cellulose-based nanocomposite33, DBA34, TBAB35, Fe3O4@SiO2@(CH2)3-Urea-SO3H/ HCl36, Et3N-Ultrasonic37, ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles38, microwave39, nickel nanoparticles40, CaHPO441, Zn[(L)proline]242, theophylline43, \u03b2-CD44, and CuO/ZnO nanocatalyst45. Various factors, such as protracted reaction times, the employment of costly reagents, intricate reactions, and diminished yields, exert significant impacts on waste handling and disposal practices. Moreover, the task of isolating homogeneous catalysts from reaction mixtures can present a formidable challenge. Today, the application of visible-light and photoreactions has attracted the attention of researchers46\u201357. The present study describes the utilization of photocatalysts in the production of heterocyclic compounds, emphasizing the implementation of environmentally sustainable practices. Based on the investigation, halogenated organic dye photo-redox catalysts are also readily attainable and economically feasible. The aforementioned technique results in the utilization of a robust donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A) cyanoarene as a potent organo-photocatalyst.\nThe primary research focus was on 2,4,6-tris(diphenylamino)-5-fluoroisophthalonitrile (3DPAFIPN), owing to its exceptional photophysical and photochemical properties. The advent of dicyanobenzene-based photosensitizers as a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and possessing remarkable photoelectric behavior, has expanded the range of available photocatalysts for organic chemists.\nThe current study has identified a novel halogenated cyanoarene-based photosensitizer, namely 3DPAFIPN, as a donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A) photocatalyst which operates via a consecutive visible-light-induced electron transfer process. The protocol herein utilizes the domino Knoevenagel\u2013Michael three cyclocondensation reaction involving barbituric acid/1,3-dimethylbarbituric, malononitrile, and aryl aldehydes. Furthermore, this reaction can exploit blue LED as an eco-friendly and renewable energy source in an aqueous medium.

The present investigation demonstrates that the co-presence of 3DPAFIPN and visible light is an imperative prerequisite for the successful synthesis of product 4b. In order to determine the optimum configurations, levels of blue light-emitting diode (LED) intensities at 3 W, 5 W, and 7 W were employed. Based on the findings of the study, it was determined that the implementation of blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a power output of 5 watts yielded the most favorable results. Experiments were performed on several substrates under idealized conditions, depicted in Table\u00a03 and Fig.\u00a02. The addition of a benzaldehyde substituent did not have a significant impact on the resultant reaction outcome. In the present reaction, the substitution of halide functionality was deemed permissible. The current state of the reaction permits both reactions that involve functional groups capable of electron donation and those that involve functional groups that exhibit electron withdrawal. The potential yield of ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted aromatic aldehydes is remarkably elevated in nature. The reactivity observed in both barbituric acid and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid was found to be identical. Table\u00a04 presents definitive value measures of the turnover frequency (TOF) and turnover number (TON). The two distinct types of yield, namely, Yield/ Amount of catalyst (mol), Yield/Time/Amount of catalyst (mol), are often expressed in the form of TON and TOF, respectively, in academic writing. Increased values of turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) have the capacity to enhance catalyst performance, as they reduce the amount of catalyst required to promote desirable yields. Regarding 4b, a TOF of 161.6 is considered high while a TON of 485 is regarded as high as well. The objective of the investigation was to optimize productivity and minimize reaction durations while mitigating catalyst usage to the lowest extent feasible.\nControl experiments. Figure\u00a0 3 illustrates the findings of the control experiments executed in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the tripartite visible light-induced reaction. The initial step in the Knoevenagel\u2013Michael cyclocondensation reaction involves the formation of arylidenemalononitrile (I), while the subsequent step entails its combination with (II). Under conventional conditions, the condensation of benzaldehyde (1) and malononitrile (2) was carried out with reduced water content, utilizing 3DPAFIPN in H2O under blue LED illumination. This resulted in the formation of arylidenemalononitrile (I). Subsequent to conducting experiments, it has been established that the interaction between arylidenemalononitrile (I) and barbituric acid radical (II) afforded the intended product, 4b, at an impressive yield of 97%, following standard procedure.

Figure\u00a0 4 presents a comprehensive depiction of the suggested methodology. Through the implementation of single electron transfer (SET) mechanisms, the cyanoarene organic dye 3DPAFIPN has been utilized to develop photocatalytic tools that harness visible light energy as a sustainable resource. The use of visible light hastens the process. The malononitrile radical is generated through a strategy stemming from the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, which augments 3DPAFIPN* and is activated by visible light. The radical adduct (C) and the radical anion of 3DPAFIPN undergo electron transfer (ET), leading to the formation of intermediates (D) as well as the ground state 3DPAFIPN. The intermediate (F) is formed via the hydrogen atom abstraction of intermediate (E) by the radical of malononitrile. The intermediates denoted as (F) and (D) undergo a Michael acceptor reaction, leading to the formation of (G). Subsequently, (4) is generated through intramolecular cyclization and tautomerization processes.\nTable 3.

The approach in question employs minute quantities of photocatalysts and precipitates prompt chemical transformations whilst abstaining from the production of residual substances. This modality can be utilized in circumstances that involve observable wavelengths of light. Atom-economical protocols exhibit pronounced potency and exert substantial influence on the industrial domain at multigram levels."

            "text": "The Knoevenagel\u2013Michael cyclocondensation reaction, a radical-induced process, has been utilized to green photosynthesize pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffolds from a combination of aryl aldehydes, malononitrile, and either barbituric acid or 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid. The present study utilized the novel halogenated dicyanobenzene-based photosensitizer; 3DPAFIPN as a donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A) photocatalyst which operates via a consecutive visible-light-induced electron transfer process. Under room temperature and in an air environment, the utilization of blue light emitting diode (LED) technology has been demonstrated to yield a sustainable energy generation mechanism within an aqueous medium. The presented method offers various advantages to the field of chemical synthesis. These benefits encompass a swift response time, nullification of perilous solvents, augmented product yields, streamlined reaction mechanism, durable conditions, and employment of a sustainable energy resource. The utilization of chromatography was not deemed necessary for the separation protocol. Through the preservation of the end result, it is plausible to accelerate a multigram-scale reaction of exemplar substrates. Thus, the approach can be implemented within a context that upholds long-term ecological and financial viability.\n3DPAFIPN (0.2 mol%)"
