ABSTRACT Introduction The reduction of coercion in psychiatry is a high priority for both the WHO and many member countries. Opendoor policy (ODP) is a service model for psychiatric ward treatment that prioritises collaborative and motivational measures to better achieve acute psychiatric safety and treatment objectives. Keeping the ward main door open is one such measure. Evidence on the impact of ODP on coercion and violent events is mixed, and only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) has previously compared ODP to standard practice. The main objectives of the Lovisenberg Open Acute Door Study (LOADS) are to implement and evaluate a Nordic version of ODP for acute psychiatric inpatient services. The evaluation is designed as a pragmatic RCT with treatmentasusual (TAU) control followed by a 4year observational period. Methods and analysis In this 12month pragmatic randomised trial, all patients referred to acute ward care will be randomly allocated to either TAU or ODP wards. The primary outcome is the proportion of patient stays with one or more coercive measures. Secondary outcomes include adverse events involving patients and/or staff, substance use and users\u2019 experiences of the treatment environment and of coercion. The main hypothesis is that ODP services will not be inferior to stateofthe art psychiatric treatment. ODP and TAU wards are determined via wardlevel randomisation. Following conclusion of the RCT, a longitudinal observational phase begins designed to monitor any longterm effects of ODP. Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) in Norway (REC South East #29238), who granted LOADS exemption from consent requirements for all eligible, admitted patients. Data are considered highly sensitive but can be made available on request. Results will be published in peerreviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences and meetings.

As part of this debate, the WHO has called for member states to replace coercive practices with collaborative practices entirely,3 while the Lancet World Psychiatric Association commission on the Future of Psychiatry4 has called for more and better evidence on coercive practices.\nOne part of this discussion concerns whether routinely locking the main doors to psychiatric wards counteracts psychiatric healthcare\u2019s therapeutic mandate and influences the attitudes of staff and general society towards psychiatric inpatients.1 5 6 Since the early 2000\u2019s, researchers from hospitals in Germany and Switzerland have reported\nStrengths and limitations of this study\n\u25ba Protocol enhancing accountability and replication of a potentially coercion- reducing service model in acute psychiatric wards. \u25ba The planned study will be the first randomised controlled trial on open- door policy in psychiatry in 25 years. \u25ba Generalisability is enhanced due to ethical committee permission to include all eligible patients with exemption from ordinary consent rules. \u25ba Weaknesses include vulnerability to historic and community events, a lack of standardised fidelity checklists for the intervention and the inability to mask allocated groups.\n(IIT P atna).

The open ward door motivates staff to rely more on\ntheir ability to engage patients in collaborative and therapeutic activities to keep patients on the ward than would be the case if the door was locked. Such collaborative attitudes and practices constitute a large part of the \u2018policy\u2019 component of ODP.7 8 2. The open door itself emphasises the ward\u2019s potential as a place of treatment and help for the patient, counteracting some of the stigma towards psychiatric wards as places of confinement to the benefit of other members of society. Not locking doors by default also communicates understanding that patients\u2019 fundamental rights to freedom provide a basis for building or maintaining a long- term therapeutic collaboration with healthcare services. 3. Patients\u2019 opportunity to exit the ward through the open door may counteract factors such as crowding or provocation by fellow patients associated with increased risk of in- ward violent events and coercive measures. 4. The open door could increase the opportunity for contact with family, friends and community health services.\nODP shares characteristics and practices with several other user- centred models of ward- based psychiatry such as collaborative staff attitudes, integrated treatment of dual disorders, communication skills training, violence risk assessment, violent event prevention and de- escalation and suicide risk assessment.9\u201311 Peer- support workers are also frequently present on ODP wards to facilitate a therapeutic dialogue between staff and patients.7 12 13\nSeveral observational studies of open- door policy psychiatric wards suggest considerable potential for reductions in the use of coercive measures when compared with traditional, closed- door services.14\u201318 These results reflect the generally positive results from the only known randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the topic, conducted in China over 25 years ago.19 Yet some attempts to replicate ODP20\u201322 have resulted in mixed or mildly negative results. In addition, ODP can be criticised for a lack of rigour and a lack of fidelity checklists,5 as the ODP literature7 permits hospitals some freedom of choice in which elements of ODP to adopt in order to facilitate implementation."

Acute psychiatric wards manage cases and disorders assessed too difficult or too dangerous to manage in the other settings. Unlike most other countries, Norway does not have dedicated forensic psychiatric units, but high security wards exist that admit patients with a record of causing serious injury or death.\nLegally sanctioned coercive measures in Norway include involuntary medication (acute tranquillising or sedative medication and long- term antipsychotic), seclusion/isolation, mechanical and physical restraints, involuntary observation and\u2014medical examination. A preferred alternative to seclusion/isolation is accommodating patient in a separate part of the ward or building with fewer other patients and increased staff per patient called \u2018shielding\u2019 (in Norwegian: \u2018skjerming\u2019).25 All coercive measures including \u2018shielding must be authorised by a senior physician or psychologist specialised in adult psychiatry, and patients must be monitored regularly by staff. Coercive measures are only to be used once all options for voluntary measures have been exhausted, and coercion must only be utilised as briefly and humane as possible. Norway\u2019s mental health act permits community treatment orders, that are usually enacted following involuntary acute psychiatric admissions.\nLOADS is conducted on a single study site, the Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital (LDH). The LDH catchment area includes three inner- city boroughs in Oslo, Norway: St. Hanshaugen, Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka, Gamle Oslo. In addition, around 12% of patients are admitted from surrounding boroughs. The catchment area for acute psychiatric admissions includes a population of around 270 000 inhabitants. This area includes Oslo\u2019s main railway station and the majority of the city\u2019s open drug scenes, areas that have Norway\u2019s highest per capita levels of social - and mental health problems.\n(IIT P atna).

The six floors of the L21F includes a psychiatric admissions ward/psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) on the ground floor, and five regular wards with ten beds each located on the floors above. In addition to the five regular wards, patients with a need for extraordinary resources during treatment, for example due to extra high risk of aggression or violence, can be referred to an eight- bed ward with more staff and less crowding. Patients treated on this high- resource ward are exempt from randomisation in this trial, but may be described in LOADS disseminations on a group basis.\nDuring a typical year the LDH Department of Psychiatry receives approximately 800 referred patients to 1100 acute admissions, of which around 40% are brief stays at the PICU/admissions ward. Patients in need of further acute ward treatment are transferred to one of five regular acute wards situated on the upper floors of the building where they stay for an average of 18 days. On these wards, around two- thirds of patients are involuntarily admitted, and a similar proportion have psychotic disorders (bipolar - or schizophrenia disorders).\nPatients can engage in music therapy, physical activity, art therapy, work therapy skills training, and sensory stimulation rooms. Except for a small rooftop terrace, gardens and other outdoor facilities can only be accessed by leaving the building via the ground floor. Staffing factor (full- time equivalents) is approximately two patients per nursing staff during daytime and 3\u20134 patients per staff during night- time."

The sequence was generated by the Principal Investigator (PI) on random. org and reflects the number of wards in each condition: 2/5 of the numbers are allocated to ODP and 3/5 to ordinary policy wards. The allocation will be administered by admission staff in a group setting during day shifts and evening shifts, and by the admissions ward head nurse during nightshifts. Random allocation and study arm is open label to staff, researchers (including PI) and patients as masking of ward service models is not considered feasible due to the significance of both staff and patients. Adherence to randomisation procedures is verified by LOADS management every month, and any discrepancies are discussed with the admissions staff.\nAs a healthcare services study conducted within the confines of the LDHs acute legal and medical responsibilities for referred patients, LOADS cannot pause inclusion due to scientific reasons, for example, if all beds in one or both study arms are full. If such situations occur, admission staff is instructed to preserve the integrity of the study by allocating patients according to principles not related to hypotheses or rationale of ODP versus usual care by placing patients in either (1) the first bed available or, (2) if all beds on all wards are full, to any available bed on any of the wards.\nTo ensure continuity of treatment for patients in the event of readmission, patients will only be randomised once during the trial period, after which allocation will follow the \u2018home ward\u2019 principle of admission to the ward or policy in which originally allocated.\nPatients with a court order of confinement or a history of repeated aggression during psychiatric treatment will be exempt from randomisation and instead admitted to the eight- bed, high- resource ward with extra staff. Descriptive data on this patient group will be compared with that of allocated patients to ensure transparency on criteria for treatment."

While the door mechanism permits patients to freely exit the ward, re- entry into the ward requires active assistance by staff after the patient rings the doorbell.\nThe \u2018policy\u2019 component is a staff attitude component designed to build trust and collaboration between patients and staff, and ultimately between patient and treatment services. This component includes several practices that are not unique to ODP but may be easier to perform systematically within the ODP than within the usual healthcare service framework. For example,\nempowerment of admitted patients is encouraged by repeated attempts at involvement in activities and treatment and offer of contracts for self- referral to frequently readmitted patients. Emphasis is placed on collaboration through shared decision making. Network meetings with the patient and any third parties to facilitate communication and collaboration. Priority is given to interventions and activities that can support longer- term recovery over short- term symptomatic relief."

Completed suicides on the LDH grounds occur at a rate of 1\u20134 events per year, making them difficult to analyse statistically.\nNon- inferiority hypotheses were chosen based on (1) the mixed results reported in previous studies and (2) because a less restrictive approach to patient freedom of mobility is a beneficial result even if coercive measures\nand adverse events go unchanged and (3) unlike previous comparative publications, the LOADS\u2019 \u2018usual treatment\u2019 has received recognition for achieving coercion prevention and reduction.28 In addition, there is uncertainty regarding whether 12 months will be sufficient for a complex intervention like ODP to take effect; while one report from Berlin suggests effects at 6 months,31 other studies have not reported significant effects on different outcomes until ODP has been implemented for much longer, for example, 24\u201348 months.32 33\nBackground data will be reported in order to provide readers with information on the social and material context of the main outcomes, such as patient or staff demographics.

A Reference group meets annually and consists of the Steering Committee and major stakeholders.\nData analysis and data sharing As a healthcare services trial, LOADS\u2019 data must be based on clinical records or other hospital data collected by clinical staff as part of treatment of admitted patients, supplemented by administrative data recorded as part of monitoring workplace productivity and safety measures.\nLOADS data extraction will commence by clinical administrative staff, who will clean and remove any directly\nidentifiable variables (such as names, dates of birth) of individual patients before making the cleaned dataset available to the PI on a local secure server. Reliance on hospital medical records means reliance on the hospital\u2019s procedures for quality control on clinical procedures and recording of events. Although Good Clinical Practice (ICH- GCP) audits or a data monitoring committee are not applicable to a healthcare services study such as LOADS, clinical administrative staff will audit data records for 20 random patient datasets for accuracy before data transfer to the PI. To monitor randomisation during the RCT, the PI will audit a minimum of 1 month\u2019s randomisation between RCT study arms and provide feedback to staff on errors in patient allocation.\nLOADS data are considered highly sensitive and entitled to a high level of protection by the LDH Privacy Ombudsman, as they are derived directly from records of all acute psychiatric admissions in the LDH catchment area. Requests for deidentified or anonymised data can be made to the contact author and must include a study protocol and detailed data protection plan. Approval is contingent on approval by the LDH Privacy Ombudsman."
