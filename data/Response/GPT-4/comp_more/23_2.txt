Development of Specialized LLMs for Critical Reasoning: Investigating the creation and training of large language models (LLMs) that are specifically tailored to enhance their ability in critical reasoning, particularly focusing on the elimination process of incorrect options. This could involve novel training paradigms that emphasize understanding the rationale behind choices, potentially improving models' performance in eliminative subquestions.

Cross-Domain Generalizability of Reasoning Skills: Exploring the transferability of critical reasoning skills across different domains and types of logical reasoning. Future research could involve developing datasets and models that can adapt critical reasoning capabilities from one domain (e.g., legal reasoning, scientific reasoning) to another, assessing the models' ability to generalize their reasoning skills.

Interactive Reasoning Models: Designing interactive LLMs that can engage in a dialogue with users to clarify ambiguities or request additional information when answering questions related to critical reasoning. Such models could ask follow-up questions to better understand the context or the user's reasoning process, potentially leading to more accurate and rationale-grounded answers.

Explainable AI for Critical Reasoning: Focusing on improving the explainability of LLMs in the context of critical reasoning. This research could aim to develop methods or frameworks that allow models not only to provide the correct answer but also to generate detailed, understandable explanations for why certain options were selected or eliminated, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of AI systems.

Augmented Rationale Generation and Utilization: Investigating advanced techniques for generating more detailed and supportive rationales and effectively incorporating them into the reasoning process of LLMs. This could include developing models that better understand and utilize both human-written and model-generated rationales, potentially through advanced comprehension of implicit rationales and external commonsense knowledge.
