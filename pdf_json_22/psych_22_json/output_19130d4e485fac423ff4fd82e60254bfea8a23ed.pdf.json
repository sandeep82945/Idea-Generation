The initial step involved a thorough situation analysis of the setting and circumstances of treatment of users with severe mental health illnesses, followed by the establishment of the community mental health team (CMHT)within the Special Psychiatric Hospital Kotor. The CMHT became responsible for the treatment of a group of clients with severemental health illnesses, based on the principles of \u201eFlexible Assertive Community Treatment (FACT \u2013 A Dutch model). Objectives: The main objective of this research was to establish whether there were substantial differences regarding the hospital readmissions in the group of patients treated by the CMHT, compared to usual mental health care in Montenegro. Methods: Within the RECOVER-E project, a sample of 202 patients, users of mental health services, were recruited in Montenegro. Patients were randomized into two similar-sized groups - intervention group, whose treatment was managed by the multidisciplinary CMHT, and control group where treatment as usual was continued. To estimate and follow-up the frequency of hospital readmissions, medical documentation was used. Results: Patients in the intervention group had less hospital days during the 18 months follow-up period. However, the differences\nbetween two groups regarding number of readmissions, and total length of hospital days were not statistically significantmeasured by independent T test. Conclusions: This study showed that CMHT care could reduce the total length of hospital days during the treatment of psychotic disorders even dough during the COVID 19 pandemic and lock down measures\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Exploring the relation between the neuronal expression of GABergic genes and cognitive impairment in living patients through modeling of schizophrenia is an important step to know more about the core of the pathophysiology of this disorder Objectives: Altered genetic expression of GAD 67 may have an important role in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia Methods: . Reprogramming of human fibroblasts into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSc) then neuronal differentiation was performed in 20 patients presenting with schizophrenia and 20 matched controls. Real time Polymerase chain reaction was done for measurement of genetic expression of GAD 65, GAD 67 and GABA beta 2. The Digit Symbol task, block design, block design task and similarities tasks from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale., Trail A and Trail B making tests in addition to ReyOsterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF) were applied to measure cognitive functions . Results: There were lower means of GAD65, GAD67 and GABA beta2genetic expression in the patients group with significant statistical difference between the 2 groups. The down regulation of GAD 67 in patients presenting with schizophrenia is positively correlated with impairment in executive functions. Conclusions: GAD 67 gene expression had the most significant correlations with the cognitive assessment in both patients and controls. The presence of those statistically significant correlations in both groups points to the possible role of GAD 67 gene functioning in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.
