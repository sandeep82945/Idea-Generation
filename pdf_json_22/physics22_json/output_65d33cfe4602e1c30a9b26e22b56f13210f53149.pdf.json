    "abstractText": "We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the random-bond Ising model (RBIM) on closed hyperbolic surfaces using Monte Carlo and high-temperature series expansion techniques. We also analyze the dual-RBIM, that is, the model that in the absence of disorder is related to the RBIM via the Kramers-Wannier duality. Even on self-dual lattices this model is different from the RBIM, unlike in the Euclidean case. We explain this anomaly by a careful rederivation of the Kramers-Wannier duality. For the (dual-)RBIM, we compute the paramagnet-toferromagnet phase transition as a function of both temperature T and the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds p. We find that as temperature is decreased in the RBIM, the paramagnet gives way to either a ferromagnet or a spin-glass phase via a second-order transition compatible with mean-field behavior. In contrast, the dual-RBIM undergoes a strongly first-order transition from the paramagnet to the ferromagnet both in the absence of disorder and along the Nishimori line. We study both transitions for a variety of hyperbolic tessellations and comment on the role of coordination number and curvature. The extent of the ferromagnetic phase in the dual-RBIM corresponds to the correctable phase of hyperbolic surface codes under independent bitand phase-flip noise.",

Breuckmann \u2020\nSchool of Mathematics, University of Bristol, Fry Building Woodland Road BS8 1UG, United Kingdom\n(Received 24 October 2022; accepted 6 January 2023; published 16 February 2023)\nWe analyze the thermodynamic properties of the random-bond Ising model (RBIM) on closed hyperbolic surfaces using Monte Carlo and high-temperature series expansion techniques. We also analyze the dual-RBIM, that is, the model that in the absence of disorder is related to the RBIM via the Kramers-Wannier duality. Even on self-dual lattices this model is different from the RBIM, unlike in the Euclidean case. We explain this anomaly by a careful rederivation of the Kramers-Wannier duality. For the (dual-)RBIM, we compute the paramagnet-toferromagnet phase transition as a function of both temperature T and the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds p. We find that as temperature is decreased in the RBIM, the paramagnet gives way to either a ferromagnet or a spin-glass phase via a second-order transition compatible with mean-field behavior. In contrast, the dual-RBIM undergoes a strongly first-order transition from the paramagnet to the ferromagnet both in the absence of disorder and along the Nishimori line. We study both transitions for a variety of hyperbolic tessellations and comment on the role of coordination number and curvature. The extent of the ferromagnetic phase in the dual-RBIM corresponds to the correctable phase of hyperbolic surface codes under independent bit- and phase-flip noise.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.107.024125\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe effect of quenched disorder to critical phenomena in spin systems has been the subject of intense study for almost half a century. One of the central models has been the random bond Ising model (RBIM), which serves as a model for certain spin-glass materials [1,2], certain localization problems and plateau transitions in the quantum Hall effect [3,4] but also has been shown to be relevant for the analysis of the performance of topological quantum error correcting codes when assuming certain noise models [5\u201310].\nThe RBIM in flat space has been understood quite comprehensively by now: While weak disorder is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense [11], increasing the disorder strength lowers the phase transition temperature until the \u201cNishimori point\u201d is reached. Beyond this, the system stays disordered for all temperatures. In more than two dimensions, the system for low temperatures and large disorder is in a spin-glass phase, with the Nishimori point being the tricritical point.\nThe present paper is now concerned with the properties of the RBIM in curved space.

Curvature is known, for example, to alter the critical. properties of statistical mechanics models [12], circuit quantum electrodynamics [13,14], and band theory [15\u201319]. The Ising model in curved space has, to the best of our knowledge, so far only been studied in the absence of disorder [10,20\u2013 23]. In this limit, the model undergoes a phase transition from a paramagnetic high-temperature to a low-temperature ferromagnetic phase, just as its flat-space counterpart. The transition is mean field in nature, but surprisingly it is not located at the fixed-point of the Kramers-Wannier duality, even on self-dual hyperbolic lattices. This observation implies either the existence of a second phase transition, for which no evidence was found numerically, or a violation of self-duality of the Ising model on self-dual hyperbolic lattices. We note that the existence of a second phase transition for the pure Ising model on the hyperbolic plane with free boundary condition has been proved [10,24,25].\nStudying the Kramers-Wannier duality in the presence of curvature is interesting on its own right [26]. However, as Polyakov pointed out already in 1987 (chapter 9 in Ref. [27]), its understanding will have consequences also for related constructions. This includes Polyakov\u2019s original example, the Fermionization of Ising spins [28], and, more recently, the mapping between the decoding of homological quantum error correction codes and statistical mechanics models [5\u201310].\nAs we show in this work, there is an anomaly in the hyperbolic RBIM. It turns out that it is not self-dual even on self-dual lattices but, in the disorder-free limit, is related by the Kramers-Wannier duality to what we call the dual-RBIM. Hence, in this paper we study both the critical properties of\n2470-0045/2023/107(2)/024125(13) 024125-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nthe random bond Ising model and its dual in hyperbolic space. Note that what we call the dual-RBIM it is not related to the RBIM by an exact duality in the presence of disorder.\nWe begin our study of both models by mapping out their phase diagrams using a combination of high-temperature series expansion techniques and Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the RBIM realizes a paramagnetic, a ferromagnetic, and a spin-glass phase with the Nishimori point as the tricritical point. All transitions (with the exception of the multicritical point) are compatible with second-order meanfield behavior. In contrast, the dual-RBIM in the disorder-free limit as well as along the Nishiori line undergoes a strongly first-order transition as evidenced through Metropolis and canonical simulations using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We numerically verify the duality of the two models in the disorder-free case and show that a duality conjectured by Takeda et al. [29] is fulfilled only approximately.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we give necessary notions and definitions; in particular the dualRBIM is derived in Sec. II B. In Sec. III we derive the hightemperature expansion for the RBIM and give details on the Monte Carlo simulations used. Section IV presents the results on the phase diagram and critical properties of the random Bond Ising model and Sec. V presents the same for the dual model. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the decoding of hyperbolic surface codes in Sec. VI. We conclude in Sec. VII."

            "text": "The hyperbolic plane is a two-dimensional (2D) manifold of constant negative curvature. It can be realized in terms of several models. Here we will employ the Poincar\u00e9 disk model, which is defined as follows. Consider a disk in R2 with unit radius and centered at the origin. Let x and y denote the standard coordinates of R2. Then the hyperbolic plane is given by the set of points\nH2 = {(x, y) \u2208 R2 | x2 + y2 < 1}, (1) with metric given by\nds2 = dx 2 + dy2\n(1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 y2)2 . (2)\nIt is immediate from Eq. (2) that length scales are highly distorted toward the boundary of the disk compared to the Euclidean metric, see Fig. 1.\nJust as regular Euclidean space can be tessellated by squares, triangles, or hexagons, hyperbolic space can be tessellated by regular polygons as well. In fact, it turns out that hyperbolic space supports an infinite number of regular tessellations. We can label regular tessellations by the Schl\u00e4fli symbol {r, s}, where r is the number of sides of the polygonal plaquettes and s is the number of plaquettes meeting at each vertex. For example, the hexagonal lattice has Schl\u00e4fli symbol {6, 3}. Its dual lattice can be obtained by reversing the Schl\u00e4fli symbol, i.e., the triangular lattice {3, 6}. These two examples, together with the self-dual square tessellation {4, 4} are all the\npossible regular tessellations of the Euclidean plane. The hyperbolic plane supports any regular tessellation {r, s} as long as 1/r + 1/s < 1/2. The {5, 5} tessellation of the hyperbolic plane in the Poincar\u00e9 disk model is shown in Fig. 1.\nIn order to approximate the infinite hyperbolic plane for numerical analysis, we can consider sequences of finite neighborhoods BR (disks) of increasing radii R. This is commonly done in the context of statistical mechanics models in Euclidean space for performing finite-size analysis. The models differ at the boundaries of the finite regions from the infinite Euclidean plane. However, the effects of this deviation vanish in the thermodynamic limit as vol(\u2202BR)/ vol(BR) \u2192 0 for R \u2192 \u221e. This is not the case in hyperbolic space where vol(\u2202BR) and vol(BR) have the same asymptotic scaling. This means that taking finite neighborhoods with boundaries can not be used to analyze the behavior of the infinite model. We solve this problem by considering families of boundaryless, finite surfaces (supporting the same tessellation) which are indistinguishable from the infinite hyperbolic plane in local regions of increasing size at any point.\nIntroducing periodic boundary conditions is a much more subtle process in hyperbolic spaces compared to Euclidean spaces. In particular, closed, orientable hyperbolic manifolds have a genus that is proportional to their area. This is seen most easily by considering a theorem due to Gau\u00df-Bonnet, which states that the geometry (curvature) of a 2D surface is connected to its topology. More concretely, it states that for any orientable surface S of genus g it holds that\n2 \u2212 2g = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b S \u03ba dA, (3)\nwhere on the right-hand side we integrate the curvature \u03ba at every point in S over the area of S. If S is Euclidean, then the curvature \u03ba is equal to 0 at every point. From Eq. (3) it then immediately follows that all orientable Euclidean surfaces are tori (g = 1). On the other hand, if S is hyperbolic, then \u03ba =\n024125-2\n\u22121 everywhere. Orientable hyperbolic surfaces hence have area(S)\n2\u03c0 = 2g \u2212 2, (4)\nso that larger surfaces necessarily have a higher genus. In Fig. 2 we show an example of a closed g = 3 hyperbolic surface, called Klein quartic, which supports a {7, 3} tessellation.\nAs it turns out, the subtlety that hyperbolic surfaces are topologically complex becomes important in the KramersWannier duality. This is because the Kramers-Wannier duality is sensitive to the number of closed loops (cycles) in the lattice and the higher genus of hyperbolic surfaces introduces more such loops, see discussion in Sec. II B.\nB. Duality in the hyperbolic Ising model\nWe consider the Ising model (for the time being without quenched disorder) on a lattice L = (V, E , F ). We denote by V the set of vertices, by E the set of edges and by F the set of faces of the lattice. Denoting nearest-neighbor bonds between two vertices i and j of the lattice by \u3008i j\u3009, the Hamiltonian of the Ising model is then given by\nH = J \u2211 \u3008i j\u3009 \u03c3i\u03c3 j, (5)\nwhere \u03c3 \u2208 {\u00b11} are Ising spin variables and we assume J < 0 for ferromagnetic coupling.\nIn Euclidean space, the Kramers-Wannier duality [30] relates the high-temperature expansion of the Ising model [Eq. (5)] to its low-temperature expansion of the same model on the dual lattice.\nIn particular, Kramers and Wannier showed an exact relation the two partition functions\nZ (T ) = Z\u0303 (T \u2217), (6a) where Z and Z\u0303 are the partition functions of the Ising model on the lattice and its dual, respectively, and T and T \u2217 satisfy\nsinh(2J/T ) sinh(2J/T \u2217) = 1. (6b) On a self-dual lattice, Z = Z\u0303 and thus the duality [Eq. (6)] constitutes an exact mapping between the behavior of the system at high and low temperature. In particular, assuming that a single phase transition occurs, this fixes the critical temperature to the fixed-point of Eq. (6b),\nsinh(2J/Tc) sinh(2J/Tc) = 1 \u21d2 Tc \u2248 2.2692J. (7)\nAn open question posed by earlier studies [20,23] was how Eq. (7) is violated in hyperbolic space. That is, if the KramersWannier duality [Eq. (6)] applies also to hyperbolic lattices, then one of the following must hold: Either all self-dual hyperbolic lattices (that is, tessellations of compact hyperbolic manifolds with Schl\u00e4fli symbol {r, s} with r = s) have the same critical temperature, given by Eq. (7), or there exist two phase transitions, related by Eq. (6b). In fact, as we will show below, the Ising model on tessellations of compact hyperbolic manifolds is not related by the Krammers-Wannier duality to the same Ising model on the dual lattice. In particular, it is not self-dual, even on self-dual lattices.\n1. Rederivation of the Kramers-Wannier duality\nTo understand this, let us perform a careful rederivation of the Kramers-Wannier duality. To this end, we first consider the high-temperature expansion of the Ising model on a lattice L = (V, E , F ). Let Z1 be the set of subsets \u03b3 \u2282 E such that in the subgraph induced by any such \u03b3 , every vertex has even degree. The subsets \u03b3 \u2208 Z1 are called cycles. It is well known that the partition function can be written as a sum over the set of all cycles of the graph (see, e.g., chapter 2 in Ref. [31]):\nZ (K ) = \u2211\n\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}N \u220f \u3008i, j\u3009\u2208E exp(K\u03c3i\u03c3 j ), (8a)\n= (cosh K )|E | \u2211\n\u03c3 \u220f (i, j) (1 + \u03c3i\u03c3 j tanh K ), (8b)\n= 2N (cosh K )|E | \u2211 \u03b3\u2208Z1 (tanh K )|\u03b3 |, (8c)\nwhere we have defined K = \u2212J/T and |S| denotes the size of the set S.\nNote that the set Z1 of cycles \u03b3 in Eq. (8) includes ones that are contractible as well as ones that are noncontractible. Two examples for such cycles, on a surface with genus 3, tessellated by the {7, 3} tessellation (cf. Fig. 2), are given in Fig. 3. On the right we show a contractible cycle on the primal lattice (solid lines) in blue. On the left we show, also in blue, a noncontractible cycle on the dual lattice (dashed lines).\nTo establish the duality, we also consider the lowtemperature expansion of the Ising model but on the dual lattice L\u2217 = (V \u2217, E\u2217, F \u2217) = (F, E ,V ). For regular tessellations of hyperbolic surfaces, the dual lattice is just obtained by swapping the first and second entry of its Schl\u00e4fli symbol\n024125-3\n{r, s}. This is also indicated in Fig. 3. The primal lattice (solid lines) is the {7, 3} tessellation and its dual (dashed lines) is the {3, 7} tessellation of the same surface.\nThe low-temperature expansion follows from expressing the partition function in terms of excitations on top of the (ferromagnetic) ground state. These are given by domain walls. For example, consider starting from an all-ferromagnetic state of the Ising model [Eq. (5)] on the (dual) lattice indicated by dashed lines in Fig. 3. The cost of flipping the spin on the central cite is given by the size of the domain wall indicated in red on the right of Fig. 3. Generally, let B1\u2217 be the set of all possible domain walls on the dual lattice. We can write\nZ\u0303 (K ) = \u2211\n\u03c3\u2208{\u00b11}N \u220f \u3008i, j\u3009\u2208E\u2217 exp(K\u03c3i\u03c3 j ), (9a)\n= 2 \u2211\n\u03c9\u2217\u2208B1\u2217 exp(K\u2217)|E \u2217|\u22122|\u03c9\u2217|, (9b)\n= 2 exp(K )|E\u2217| \u2211\n\u03c9\u2217\u2208B1\u2217 exp(\u22122K )|\u03c9\u2217|, (9c)\nwhere the second equality directly follows from the definition of B1\u2217. In the language of homology, the set B1\u2217 is given exactly by the set of coboundaries on the dual lattice.\nThe basis of the Kramers-Wannier duality, homologically speaking, is the fact that the set of cycles Z1 is in one-toone correspondence with the set of cocycles Z1\u2217 on the dual lattice L\u2217. This is also indicated in Fig. 3 where we show two examples of the correspondence of cocycles (red) and cycles (blue). The left side shows a noncontractible cocycle on the primal lattice (solid, red) and the corresponding cycle on the dual (blue, dashed). The right side shows a contractible cycle (a boundary) on the primal lattice (red, solid) and the corresponding cocycle (a coboundary) on the dual lattice (red, dashed).\nUsing this equivalence, Z1 = Z1\u2217, as well as Eq. (6b), and defining K\u2217 = \u2212J/T \u2217, we can then rewrite\nZ (K ) = 2 exp(K\u2217)|E\u2217| \u2211\n\u03b3 \u2217\u2208Z1\u2217 exp(\u22122K\u2217)|\u03b3 \u2217|. (10)\nAbove, the right-hand side is almost the low-temperature expansion of the Ising model on the dual lattice [Eq. (9)] at temperature T \u2217 [Eq. (6b)]. The difference between Eq. (10) and Eq. (9) is that the sum above is over all cocycles \u03b3 \u2217 \u2208 Z1\u2217, whereas the low-temperature expansion is a sum over domain walls \u03c9\u2217 \u2208 B1\u2217, that is, coboundaries or \u201ccontractible\u201d cocycles. Physically, we can rationalize this difference by looking at the example of a noncontractible cocycle on the left of Fig. 3 (red, solid). The corresponding cycle (blue, dashed) appears in the high-temperature expansion of the dual lattice (every vertex in it has even degree). However, there is no set of spins on vertices of the primal lattice that we could flip to get a domain of that form.\nHence, for Ising models on regular tessellations of closed manifolds, we have established what is the difference between their high-temperature expansion [Eq. (8)] and the low-temperature expansion on the dual lattice, at the dual temperature [Eq. (10)]. In the following we will show that (i) for tessellations of closed Euclidean surfaces (tori), this difference vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, yielding the\nKramers-Wannier duality [Eq. (6)], and (ii) the difference does not vanish for tessellations of closed hyperbolic surfaces, leading to a violation of Eq. (6).\nNote that the contribution of any cocycle in Eq. (10) has a weight exp(\u22122K\u2217)|\u03b3 \u2217|. For Euclidean lattices on an L \u00d7 L torus this implies that the contribution of any noncontractible cocycle is at least of order [exp(\u22122K\u2217]L. Focusing on such minimal-size cocycles, of which there are \u223cL, the difference between Eq. (10) and the low-temperature expansion of the Ising model vanishes in the thermodynamic limit,\nZ (T ) \u2212 Z\u0303 (T \u2217) \u223c L exp(\u22122K\u2217L) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 L\u2192\u221e 0. (11)\nThis then yields Eq. (6). In contrast, in hyperbolic space, the number of minimal, noncontractible cocycles goes as \u223cN [see Eq. (4)] while their length grows only logarithmically [32,33]. This means that the same difference goes as\nZ (T ) \u2212 Z\u0303 (T \u2217) \u223c N1\u22122K\u2217 , (12) which does not generally vanish as N \u2192 \u221e.\n2. The dual Ising model in hyperbolic space\nIn order to obtain a model that does fulfill the KramersWannier duality, we have to define a model where possible domain walls on top of the ferromagnetic ground state include all noncontractible cocycles.\nWe achieve this by a rather simple trick. Given an Ising model [Eq. (5)] on a tessellation of a closed hyperbolic surface S with 2g nonequivalent, noncontractible cocyles , we introduce one additional Ising degree of freedom \u03b7 per nonequivalent, noncontractible cocycle.\nWe then define the \u201cdual Ising model\u201d as\nH = J \u2211 \u3008i j\u3009\n\u239b \u239d \u220f\n| \u3008i j\u3009\u2208 \u03b7\n\u239e \u23a0 \u03c3i\u03c3 j, (13)\nwhere J < 0 as before is chosen to be ferromagnetic and we have chosen one representative per nontrivial cocycle . One example of such a representative on a hyperbolic surface with genus 3, tessellated by the {7, 3} tessellation, is shown on the left side of Fig. 3, where it is highlighted in red. The effect of flipping this Ising degree of freedom \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u03b7 is to reverse the sign of the coupling of each edge that is part of the representative . One can think of each variable \u03b7 to encode the boundary condition in one possible direction which can either be periodic (\u03b7 = 1) or antiperiodic (\u03b7 = \u22121). Because of this, the domain walls of the model defined by Eq. (13) include the nontrivial cocycles of the lattice and its partition is given by Eq. (10), that is, the dual-RBIM for p = 0 is indeed the Kramers-Wannier dual of the Ising model.\nThis model also gives another rational for the difference between duality of Ising models on tessellations of Euclidian and hyperbolic manifolds. Strictly speaking, the KramersWannier dual of the Ising model on finite tessellations of Euclidean manifolds is also given by Eq. (13). However, since all closed, orientable Euclidean manifolds are tori, the dual model has only two additional degrees of freedom compared to the original Ising model [Eq. (5)]. Hence, they have no finite entropic contribution in the thermodynamic limit and the dual\n024125-4\nmodel has the same thermodynamic properties as the original model. In contrast, on tessellations of closed hyperbolic manifolds, the number of additional variables in Eq. (13) is extensive (\u223cN) and hence changes the properties of the model, even in the thermodynamic limit.\nC. The random-bond Ising model\nThe RBIM, first introduced by Edwards and Anderson [1] to model the interaction of dilute magnetic alloys, serves as a simple model to study critical phenomena in systems with quenched disorder. The Hamiltonian for the RBIM on a lattice with nearest-neighbor bonds \u3008i j\u3009 is\nH = \u2211 \u3008i, j\u3009 Ji j\u03c3i\u03c3 j, (14)\nwhere \u03c3i \u2208 {\u00b11} are Ising spin variables and Ji j are random couplings. Whenever we refer to the Ising model in \u201chyperbolic space\u201d or on \u201chyperbolic lattices\u201d throughout this work, we refer to a model where spins are located on the vertices of regular tessellations of compact hyperbolic manifolds, with Schl\u00e4fli symbol {r, s}. This emphasis is important, since considering the same model on noncompact hyperbolic manifolds with, for example, open or closed boundary conditions will generally change its properties [24,25]. The couplings are distributed independently and identically. In this paper, we take their individual probability distribution to be the \u201c\u00b1Jdistribution,\u201d\nP(Ji j ) = p \u03b4(Ji j \u2212 1) + (1 \u2212 p) \u03b4(Ji j + 1), (15) so that each coupling is antiferromagnetic Ji j = +1 with probability p and ferromagnetic Ji j = \u22121 with probability 1 \u2212 p. Hence, on the infinite hyperbolic plane, p is equal to the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds. The free energy of the model, when considering quenched disorder is then given by\nF = [log(Z )], (16)\nZ = \u2211 {\u03c3 } exp\n\u239b \u239d\u2212\u03b2 \u2211\n\u3008i, j\u3009 Ji j\u03c3i\u03c3 j\n\u239e \u23a0, (17)\nwhere brackets [. . . ] denote the average over disorder configurations.\nFor p = 0, the model reduces to the ferromagnetic Ising model, which we have studied for regular tessellations of compact hyperbolic manifolds in a previous paper [23]. This model as a function of temperature undergoes a phase transition from a high-temperature paramagnetic into a lowtemperature ferromagnetic phase. Our study revealed that this transition is mean field in nature for all investigated tessellations. In the present work, we extend our previous work to the case of finite 0 < p < 1/2.\nWe also study the dual Ising model Eq. (13) in the presence of quenched disorder. In this case it becomes\nH = \u2211 \u3008i j\u3009 Ji j\n\u239b \u239d \u220f\n| \u3008i j\u3009\u2208 \u03b7\n\u239e \u23a0 \u03c3i\u03c3 j . (18)\nAs before, the \u03c3 j \u2208 {\u00b11} are Ising variables, as are the \u03b7 \u2208 {\u00b11}. While the \u03c3 j are located on the vertices of the\nlattice, each \u03b7 is associated with a nontrivial cocycle \u03b7 (cf. Sec. II B). The Ji j are random couplings drawn from the \u00b1J distribution defined in Eq. (15).\nThe Kramers-Wannier duality [Eq. (6)], as usual, is only valid is the disorder-free case. However, there exists a conjecture by Takeda and Nihsimori [29] relating the location of the Nishimori point of the RBIM with the position in the dual model,\nH (pN ) + H (p\u2217N ) = 1, (19) where H (p) = \u2212p log2(p) \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) log2(1 \u2212 p) is the binary entropy. As discussed in Sec. V, we see that the conjecture holds approximately but not within error bars.\nD. Possible phases and order parameters\nAt high temperature, both the RBIM and its dual are in the paramagnetic phase. As the temperature is lowered, at low disorder this gives way to a ferromagnetic phase which is continuously connected to that of the pure model at p = 0. The transition from the paramagnet to the ferromagnet corresponds to an instability of the mean of the magnetization distribution \u03c1(m). That means while in the paramagnet we have\n\u03c1(m) = \u03b4(m), (20) in the ferromagnetic phase\n\u03c1(m) = \u03b4(|m| \u2212 M ). (21) For large disorder, p \u2248 1/2, random systems can also develop spin-glass order at low temperature, which corresponds to an instability in the variance of the magnetization distribution, which is also called the Edwards-Anderson (EA) order parameter\nqEA = [m2], (22) where the magnetization vanishes ([m] = 0). At intermediate values of disorder, there is in principle also the possibility of a magnetized spin-glass phase [34,35], where the magnetization distribution has both finite width (qEA = 0) and mean ([m] = 0).\nThe schematic phase diagram of the RBIM and its dual on the hyperbolic plane is shown in Fig. 4. Note that for the dual model, we only indicate the phase boundary of the ferromagnetic phase. There could exist a spin-glass phase in principle, but the investigation of that is beyond the scope of this work. We also indicate the so-called Nishimori line [36], which is defined by the condition\nexp(2\u03b2J ) = p 1 \u2212 p, (23)\nthat is, the (relative) probability of frustrating a bond due to thermal fluctuations is equal to that of flipping its sign due to the quenched disorder. It is known that the multicritical point in the RBIM lies on the Nishimori line and that the phase boundary of any magnetized phase must be reentrant or vertical, that is, no magnetized phase can exist for pN < p [36].\nAs indicated, we expect the ferromagnetic phase of the RBIM to have a larger extent than that of its dual, since the additional cocycle degrees of freedom \u03b7 have a finite\n024125-5\ncontribution to the entropy, which is then strictly greater than that of the RBIM."

Biconnected graph expansion of inverse susceptibilities\nIt turns out that for susceptibilities of the form\n\u03c7k,l = \u03b2 1 N \u2211 i, j [\u3008\u03c3i\u03c3 j\u3009k \u2212 \u3008\u03c3i\u3009k\u3008\u03c3 j\u3009k]l , (28)\nit is favorable to perform the high-temperature expansion in the inverse susceptibility. The reason for this is that it can be shown [37] that the only nontrivial contributions come from biconnected graphs, that is, graphs which stay connected if any of their vertices (and the edges attached to it) are being removed. We show the first few graphs that contribute to the susceptibility \u03c7 = \u03c71,1 and EA susceptibility \u03c7EA = \u03c72,1 on the {5, 5} lattice in Fig. 5.\nThe inverse susceptibility can be expanded in terms of these graphs as a function of both inverse temperature v = tanh(\u03b2J ) and disorder strength \u03bc = 1 \u2212 2p. In practice, the variables in the systematic biconnected graph expansion are w = v2 and \u03b1 = \u03bc/v:\n\u03c7\u0303\u22121(w, \u03b1) = 1 + \u2211\ng\nc(g)W (g), (29)\nwhere the sum is over all graphs, c(g) is the coefficient of N of the number of embeddings of the graph g into the lattice, and W (g) for each graph is a function of both w and \u03b1. Expanding W as a function of inverse temperature w, one can show that for each order n, the coefficient of wn is a polynomial in \u03b1 of order n with integer coefficients. For example, the inverse susceptibility on the {5, 5} lattice is given by\n\u03c7\u22121(w, \u03b1) = 1 \u2212 5\u03b1w + 5\u03b12w2 \u2212 5\u03b13w3 + 5\u03b14w4\n+ (10\u03b1 + 10\u03b12 + 10\u03b13 + 10\u03b14 + 5\u03b15)w5\n+ O(w6). (30) Note that for \u03b1 = 1 (that is, v = \u03bc), we obtain the series on the Nishimori line up to order O(wn) = O(v2n).\nFor more details and a derivation of Eq. (29) see Ref. [37].\n024125-6"

            "text": "We analyze the generates series \u03c7\u0303 (w, \u03b1), usually for fixed \u03b1 as a function of w, using first-order homogeneous integrated differential approximants (FO-IDAs). One reason to choose FO-IDAs over simpler methods is that they are known to be less biased toward the lower-order coefficients of the expansion [38]. This is important, as the most relevant contributions on a {r, s} tiling come from graphs with at least r edges.\nThe analysis using FO-IDAs proceeds as follows: For fixed disorder strength \u03b1, we assume that the series \u03c7\u0303 is the solution of a first-order differential equation of the form\nQL(w) d\u03c7\u0303 (w)\ndv + RM (w) \u03c7\u0303 (w) + ST (w) = 0, (31)\nwhere QL, RM , and ST are polynomials of degree L, M, and T , respectively. By equating the series order by order with the coefficients of Eq. (31) we obtain a linear system of equations in the coefficients of the polynomials QL, RM , and ST . It can be shown that for any root wc of the polynomial QL, a solution of Eq. (31) has an algebraic singularity of the form (w \u2212 wc)\u2212\u03b3 [31]. The exponent of the singularity is given by\n\u03b3 = RM (wc) Q\u2032L(wc) . (32)\nGenerally, the results for wc and \u03b3 will depend on the choice of degrees L, M, and T . If we have the series up to order N , then we can choose all possible values satisfying L + M + T N \u2212 2. Following Ref. [38], we exclude approximants if\n(i) a root of RM is close to wc, giving rise to a small estimate of \u03b3 , or\n(ii) a complex root of QL with small absolute value smaller than wc is close to the real axis.\nWe observe that the convergence of the series is very good, since the approximants for different choices of L, M, and T are all close.\nB. Monte Carlo simulations\nTo corroborate our results from the series expansion and to compute additional observables, we also perform classical Monte Carlo simulations for some sets of parameters. To compute the disorder average [. . . ], we perform Monte Carlo simulations for using 1000 disorder realizations {Ji j}. For each realization, we simulate two independent copies {\u03c3 (1)j }, {\u03c3 (2)j } of the system.\n1. Equilibration in the (possible) presence of glassiness\nSince it is know that there is no spin-glass behavior on the Nishimori line [36], we expect that a standard local Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is sufficient to equilibrate the system at temperatures T > 2J log[p/(1 \u2212 p)]\u22121. When approaching the spin-glass phase, the local algorithm suffers from a drastic slowdown. Nevertheless, we are able to study the spin-glass transition since for that we do not need to equilibrate the system deep inside the glassy phase. To make sure that the system is actually equilibrated, we keep track of the autocorrelation time of all relevant observables (computed via binning analysis [39]) to ensure that we equilbrate the system for at least 10 times as long as the largest equilibration\ntime in the system and that we take 5000 independent samples per temperature value for each observable\n2. Finite-size scaling\nDue to the absence of a unique linear dimension in the compactifications of the hyperbolic plane, we perform finitesize scaling as a function of the number of sites N . This was initially proposed for a fully connected model [40] and has been used for hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions [41] as well as in our study of the pure Ising model in the hyperbolic plane [23]. The main idea is that a quantity A, close to criticality, follows a scaling form\nA \u223c |T \u2212 Tc|a F (N/Nc) (33) with a correlation number Nc. Assuming that a corresponding system of finite dimension d = dc, where dc is the upper critical dimension, has the same scaling behavior as its hyperbolic sibling, it follows that\nNc = \u223c|T \u2212 Tc|\u2212\u03bc, (34) with the critical exponent\n\u03bc = \u03bdMF dc, (35) and \u03bdMF is the mean-field value of the critical exponent of the correlation length \u03be .\n3. Observables\nTo map out the phase diagram and compute critical exponents, we study a number of observables, all of which are related to either the magnetization\nm(\u03b1) = 1 N \u2211 j \u03c3 (\u03b1) j (36)\nor the Edwards-Anderson order parameter\nq = 1 N \u2211 j \u03c3 (1) j \u03c3 (2) j . (37)\nFirst, to determine the location of the critical point and the critical exponent of the correlation number \u03bc, we compute the binder cumulants\ng = 1 \u2212 [\u3008m 4\u3009]\n[\u3008m2\u30092] , (38)\ngEA = 1 \u2212 [\u3008q 4\u3009]\n[\u3008q2\u30092] , (39)\nwhich, for different system sizes, cross at the transition to a magnetized and a spin-glass phase, respectively. The best estimate for the transition temperature Tc and the exponent \u03bc is given by performing a data collapse, using the fact that close to the transition the respective cumulant is given by\ng = G[N1/\u03bc(T \u2212 Tc)], (40) with some universal scaling function G.\n024125-7\nFor both order parameters, we also compute the corresponding susceptibilities\n\u03c7 = \u03b2N ([\u3008m2\u3009] \u2212 [\u3008m\u3009]), (41)\n\u03c7EA = \u03b2N ([\u3008q2\u3009] \u2212 [\u3008q\u3009]). (42) Again, the best estimate for Tc, \u03b3 , and \u03bc are obtained by performing a data collapse, since close to the transition the susceptibility is given by\n\u03c7 = N\u03b3 /\u03bcS[N1/\u03bc(T \u2212 Tc)], (43) with some universal scaling function S."

Compared to the RBIM on the Euclidean square ({4, 4}) lattice, we find a much larger ferromagnetic phase and a extended spin-glass phase. In contrast to the Bethe lattice, here we do not find evidence for a magnetized spin-glass phase, although our low-temperature data are not good enough to rule out a very small extent.\nTurning to explain our results in more detail, in Fig. 6 we show both the magnetization m as well as the Edwards-\nAnderson order parameter q (in the inset) as obtained from a MC simulation with system size N = 1920. While the magnetization is nonzero only in the ferromagnetic phase, the EA order parameter is nonzero in both the ferromagnet and the spin glass. We superimpose these plots with the critical points obtained using finite-size scaling of the MC data (open circles) and with the critical lines obtained from HTSE of the (EA) susceptibility (solid lines). In both methods, we can distinguish the transition from the paramagnet to a ferromagnetic phase and that to a spin-glass phase reliably. In the finite-size analysis of the MC data, a transition to the ferromagnetic phase is signaled by a crossing of both the binder cumulant of the magnetization, g [Eq. (38)], as well as a crossing of the binder cumulant of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, gEA [Eq. (39)]. In contrast, at the transition to a spin-glass phase, only gEA shows a crossing while g does not, since the magnetization m vanishes in the spin glass. Finite-size scaling along the Nishimori line indicates a transition at pN = 0.247 \u00b1 0.02 and finite-size analysis as a function of temperature at constant disorder shown a transition into a ferromagnet for p pN and a transition into a spin glass for p pN , making the Nishimori point the multicritical point.\nThis result is corroborated by HTSE analysis. Here a transition to the ferromagnet (spin glass) is signaled by the divergence ferromagnetic (EA) susceptibility \u03c7(EA). Note that since the nondivergent susceptibility at both transitions typically also has a weak singularity (a cusp), series analysis normally predicts a divergence for both susceptibilities but at different critical temperatures. In practice, we distinguish the two transitions by the fact which susceptibility is predicted to diverge at a larger temperature. Along the Nishimori line, that is, \u03b1 = 1 in Eq. (29), the two susceptibilities are equal and HTSE yields a critical point, wc = 0.256456 \u00b1 8.6 \u00d7 10\u22126, which corresponds to pN = 0.246793 \u00b1 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22126. For \u03b1 < 1, we find a transition to a ferromagnetic phase while for \u03b1 > 1 we find a transition into a spin-glass phase, again suggesting that the Nishimori point is indeed the multicritical point of the model.\nB. Phase boundaries for different tilings: Coordination vs curvature\nWe now use the high-temperature expansion to study how the paramagnet-ferromagnet and paramagnet-spin-glass phase boundaries vary for different tilings {r, s}. For low disorder, the critical temperature is mostly controlled by the coordination number s and for p = 0 even agrees quantitatively with that of the Bethe lattice with the same coordination [23]. Qualitatively, this behavior can be understood by considering that the transition into the ferromagnet at low disorder is driven by a competition between and the entropy of the paramagnet and internal energy of the ferromagnetic state,\nEFM = sN 2 [Ji j], (44)\nwhich is proportional to the coordination number s. This means that with larger s, the ferromagnet becomes more favorable at larger temperatures. As disorder is increased; however, [Ji j] also increases (approaching zero from a negative value) and so does the importance of s as a control parameter for\n024125-8\nthe transition temperature. Finally, [Ji j] \u2192 0 as p \u2192 12 and the critical temperature becomes a monotonic function of the curvature \u03ba , as seen in the inset of Fig. 7."

We show the average vertex magnetization m = \u3008\u03c3 j\u3009 and loop magnetization m\u03b7 = \u3008\u03b7 \u3009, as well as the Binder cumulants g and g\u03b7 for vertex and loop magnetization, respectively. The fact that the magnetizations for different system sizes cross at a single point, together with the pronounced dip of the Binder cumulants just before the transition are evidence that both quantities undergo a strongly first-order transition. This result is rather surprising, given that the magnetization of the Ising model on the same lattice undergoes an ordinary second-order transition, and the two models are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality.\nSince the {5, 5} lattice is self-dual and the KramersWannier duality [Eq. (6b)] is exact at p = 0, we expect the transition to occur at a critical temperature dual to the the critical point of the Ising model. Substituting Tc = 3.93 [23] into Eq.

In the ordered phase of the dual Ising model, the difference vanishes since the sum over cocycle variables does not contribute. This is shown in Fig. 10. The quantity F also has the advantage of indicating both phase transitions in one observable, since the free energy of the Ising model shows a visible kink at Tc. Both critical temperatures are again indicated in the figure by vertical dashed lines.\nB. Dual random bond Ising model\nIn the case of the random model, the dual-RBIM is not exactly dual to the RBIM and hence we have an a priori guess for the location of the critical point. Additionally, as is already the case in the pure model, the strongly first-order nature of the transition complicates its numerical investigation. We find that single-spin flip Monte Carlo is unreliable even for small system sizes. However, the Wang-Landau algorithm is still converging and hence we can infer the location of the critical point from the free-energy difference [Eq. (46)]. The difference for T < T \u2217c vanishes as a function of system size and diverges as a function of system size for T \u2217c < T , respectively. In Fig. 11, we show F as a function of disorder strength p along the Nishimori line [Eq. (23)]. The data are consistent with a transition at p\u2217N = 0.0228 \u00b1 0.001, which is indicated in the figure by a shaded area. The inset shows the best data collapse assuming the same correlation exponent \u03bc = 3 as in the RBIM.\nSubstituting the value of pN = 0.246793 \u00b1 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 obtained from the high-temperature expansion of the RBIM (see Sec. IV for details) into the duality relation conjectured by Nishimori [Eq. (19)] and solving for p\u2217N yields a value of p\u2217N = 0.029891 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 10\u22126. As observed for the RBIM on a range of Euclidean lattice geometries [29] this is somewhat\n024125-10\nclose to our numerical result but not compatible within error bars."

            "text": "Quantum error correcting codes are used in quantum computation to reduce the effects of decoherence. Certain infinite families of codes, together with associated quantum error correction protocols, can be shown to have a threshold. A threshold is a critical value of a noise parameter, below which the error correction protocol succeeds with probability approaching 1 with increasing code sizes.\nIt was argued in Refs. [5,7] that the threshold of the toric code corresponds to the phase transition point along the Nishimori line of the RBIM on the square grid {4, 4}. In Ref. [8] it was proved that this is indeed the case for quantum codes which encode a finite number of qubits. In Sec. IV C of Ref. [6] it was mentioned that the statistical mechanical models associated to quantum codes which encode an extensive number of qubits may exhibit multiple phase transitions. This behavior was studied in Ref. [46].\nThe quantum codes associated to the hyperbolic RBIM are called hyperbolic surface codes [47\u201349]. These codes do encode an extensive number of qubits, so that the proofs of Refs. [6,8] do not apply to them. In Ref. [10] the authors consider the hyperbolic RBIM and give a condition sufficient for error correction to be possible, which is equivalent to F \u2192 0, where F is the free-energy difference of the RBIM and the dual-RBIM, see Eq. (46). Hence, assuming all logical operators are equivalent, the phase transition of what we call the \u201cdual-RBIM\u201d along the Nishimori line corresponds exactly to the maximum likelihood decoding threshold of the hyperbolic surface code under independent bit- and phase-flip noise,\npth,ML = p\u2217N = 0.0228 \u00b1 0.0010. (47)\nThis can be compared to the threshold when using a minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder, which is pth,MWPM \u2248 0.0175 [50]. Using an optimal decoder rather than MWPM hence increases the threshold by about 27%.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nTo summarize, we have presented an in-depth study of the RBIM on the hyperbolic plane as well as the model, that is, its Kramers-Wannier dual in the absence of disorder. Resolving a conundrum raised in earlier work [20,23], we showed that this \u201cdual-RBIM\u201d is different from the RBIM even on self-dual lattices due to the extensive number of nontrivial cocycles of hyperbolic lattices. Combining high-temperature expansion techniques and Monte Carlo techniques, we mapped out the phase diagrams of both models, establishing the existence of a spin-glass phase with the Nshimori point as the tricritical point. Studying the critical properties of the high-temperature transitions, we showed that with the exception of the multicritical point, all transitions are mean field in nature. We verified the duality of both models explicitly in the disorderfree case and showed that the extended duality as conjectured by Takeda, Sesamoto, and Nishimori [29] is fulfilled only approximately. Finally, we commented on the relation of the above findings to the decoding of hyperbolic surface codes and argued that the critical disorder along the Nishimori of what we call the dual-RBIM corresponds to the maximumlikelihood decoding threshold of hyperbolic surface codes under independent bit- and phase-flip noise. This generalizes the statistical mechanics mappings of the decoding of zerorate quantum codes [5,6,8] to quantum codes with finite rate.\nThis work open up multiple interesting areas for future work. For example, beyond the scope of the current paper was a detailed investigation of the nature of the spin-glass phase in hyperbolic space and in particular its fate in the dualRBIM. Moreover, a detailed investigation of the phase-space structure of the dual model could yield valuable insights into the decoding of finite-rate quantum codes.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Ananda Roy for many helpful discussions in the early stages of this project.

            "heading": "APPENDIX: KRAMERS-WANNIER DUALITY AS FOURIER TRANSFORMATION",
            "text": "The Kramers-Wannier duality is in fact a Fourier transformation of the partition function. In this section we provide the formal argument.\n024125-11\nFirst, let us rewrite the partition function in terms of homological algebra. To this end, we require some definitions. Let\nC0 = {\u2211\nv\u2208V avv | av \u2208 Z2\n}\nbe the vector space containing formal linear combinations of vertices with coefficients in Z2 and similarly\nC1 = {\u2211\ne\u2208E aee | ae \u2208 Z2\n}\nthe Z2-vector space spanned by the edges. The coboundary operator \u03b40 is represented by a Z2 matrix whose rows are labeled by edges and columns labeled by vertices and (\u03b40)e,v = 1 if v \u2208 e and 0 otherwise. We may think of the coboundary operator \u03b40 as a discrete version of the gradient operating on Z2-scalar fields \u03c6 \u2208 C0. The boundary operator is defined as \u22021 = \u03b4tr0 . As in Eq. (9), we observe that the sum \u2211 i\u223c j \u03c3i\u03c3 j can be rewritten as |E | \u2212 2|\u03b40\u03c6|, where | \u00b7 | is the Hamming weight. To simplify notation, we introduce the function f (c) = exp(KN \u2212 2|c|). Hence, we can express the partition function as a sum over all gradients of Z2 fields. In order to Fourier transform f , we observe that the characters of Ci, interpreted as Abelian groups, are given by \u03c7d (c) = (\u22121)\u3008c,d\u3009. Hence, we obtain:\n\u2211 \u03c6\u2208C0 f (\u03b40\u03c6) = \u2211 \u03c6\u2208C0 1\u221a|C1| \u2211 \u03be\u2208C1 (\u22121)\u3008\u03b40\u03c6,\u03be\u3009 f\u0302 (\u03be ), (A1a)\n= 1\u221a|C1| \u2211 \u03be\u2208C1 f\u0302 (\u03be ) \u2211 \u03c6\u2208C0 (\u22121)\u3008\u03c6,\u22021\u03be\u3009, (A1b)\n= |C0|\u221a|C1| \u2211 \u03b3\u2208Z1 f\u0302 (\u03b3 ), (A1c) = 2N\u2212|E |/2 \u2211 \u03b3\u2208Z1 f\u0302 (\u03b3 ). (A1d)\nIn the second equation we used \u03b4tr0 = \u22021 and in the third equation we used that the sum over character values is zero, unless it is the trivial character. Note that Fourier transforming turned the partition function from a sum over coboundaries \u03b40\u03c6 \u2208 B1 into a sum over cycles \u03b3 \u2208 ker \u22021.\nThe Fourier transformed function f\u0302 can be expressed as follows:\nf\u0302 (\u03b3 ) = 1\u221a|C1| \u2211 c\u2208C1 f (c)(\u22121)\u3008\u03b3 ,c\u3009, (A2a)\n= 1 2|E |/2 \u220f e\u2208E [exp(K ) + (\u22121)\u03b3e exp(\u2212K )], (A2b)\n= (cosh K ) |E | 2|E |/2 \u220f e\u2208E {1 + (\u22121)\u03b3e\n+ [1 \u2212 (\u22121)\u03b3e ] tanh(K )}, (A2c) = 2|E |/2(cosh K )|E |(tanh K )|\u03b3 |. (A2d)\nSubstituting Eq. (A2) in Eq. (A1) gives Eq. (8). The argument given here can be written more abstractly as a Pontrjagin duality between the chain complexes associated with the lattice and its dual, see Ref. [[26], Section 4]. We also note that the Kramers-Wannier duality can be seen as a special case of more general dualities derived in algebraic geometry [51].\n[1] S. F. Edwards and P. W. Anderson, J. Phys.
