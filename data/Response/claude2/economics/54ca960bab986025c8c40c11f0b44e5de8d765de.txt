 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Study the impact of different buyer estimation bias distributions on sellers' information disclosure strategies. The current paper assumes a uniform distribution for the buyer's quality estimation bias. It would be interesting to analyze how different distributions (e.g. normal, exponential) affect the results.

2. Incorporate sellers' capacity expansion decisions. The paper studies sellers' information disclosure under given capacities. An extension could allow sellers to make capacity investment decisions and study the joint optimization of capacity and information disclosure. 

3. Analyze the effects of sellers' quality exaggeration. The current model assumes sellers' displayed quality truthfully reflects the actual quality. One could study how the results change if sellers can exaggerate quality through false advertising.

4. Consider sellers' service pricing jointly with information disclosure. The paper studies pricing in a separate stage after information disclosure. A joint analysis of service pricing and information disclosure could lead to new insights.

5. Examine information disclosure in the presence of platform commissions. The model does not consider commissions charged by the sharing platform. Adding platform commissions could affect sellers' disclosure incentives and enable new pricing mechanisms.
