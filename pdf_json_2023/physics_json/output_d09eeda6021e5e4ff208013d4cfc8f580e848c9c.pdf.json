    "abstractText": "Efficient selection and production of antibody fragments in microbial systems remain to be a challenging process. To optimize microbial production of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), we have chosen five model targets, 1) a hapten, Zearalenone (ZEN) mycotoxin, along with infectious agents 2) rabies virus, 3) Propionibacterium acnes, 4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a cancer cell 5) acute myeloid leukemia cell line (HL-60). The scFv binders were affinity selected from a non-immunized human phage display scFv antibody library and genetically fused to the N-terminus of emerald green fluorescent protein (EmGFP). The scFv-EmGFP fusion constructs were subcloned into an expression vector, under the control of T7 promoter, C-terminally tagged with hexa-histidine and expressed in different Escherichia coli (E. coli) hosts. This enabled the detection of cells that expressed the correct scFv-EmGFP fusion, termed fluorobody, via bright fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm. Among the three E. coli hosts tested, an engineered E. coli B strain called SHuffle B that promotes disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm appeared to be the most appropriate host. The recombinant fluorobodies were well expressed (2\u20138 mg/L), possessed the fluorescence property of EmGFP, and retained the ability to bind to their cognate targets. Their specific bindings were demonstrated by ELISA, fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA), flow cytometry, and fluorescent microscope imaging. The fluorobody expression platform in this study could be further adopted as a one-step immunostaining technique based on scFv, isolated from phage display library to numerous desired targets.",

            "text": "Various types of antibody (Ab) fragments have been engineered for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes (D\u00fcbel 2007). The two common forms of small Ab fragments are single-chain variable-fragment (scFv) and single-domain Ab (sdAb). The scFv consists of light and heavy chain variable domains of immunoglobulin of mammals, linked with peptide linker (G4S)3. The average size of scFv is about 27\u00a0kDa and contains 2 predicted disulfide bonds (Ferr\u00e8 and Clote 2005a). Phage display Ab technology is the most popular method for the generation of recombinant antibody (rAb) in the form of scFv or Fab. The key advantage of this technology relies on the simplicity but powerful affinity selection * Mehmet Berkmen berkmen@neb.com * Montarop Yamabhai montarop@g.sut.ac.th; montarop@sut.ac.th 1 School of\u00a0Biotechnology, Institute of\u00a0Agricultural Technology, Suranaree University of\u00a0Technology, Nakhon\u00a0Ratchasima\u00a030000, Thailand 2 New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA\u00a001938, USA\n1 3\n(bio-panning) procedure, and the direct linkage between the displayed Ab and its encoding gene within the phage genome (Kehoe and Kay 2005). Ab against desired target can be identified directly from diverse repertoires of Ab genes, generating high-affinity binding sites without the constraints imposed by classical method for generating either polyclonal or monoclonal Ab (McCafferty et\u00a0al. 1990), such as high costs, stability of hybridoma cells, or batch-to-batch variation. Moreover, this method allows further engineering of the antibody into various formats to suit desired applications (Rangnoi et\u00a0al. 2021), such as improved binding to Fc\u03b3RI receptor (Robinson et\u00a0al. 2015). Since the structure of the binding domain of the Ab is not glycosylated; contrary to therapeutic Ab which requires functional glycosylated constant domain (Fc), rAb can be expressed efficiently using expression systems which lack glycosylation machinery (Frenzel et\u00a0al. 2013). This research focused on scFv format because it is small and can be obtained directly from biopanning of phage display scFv library. One of the common expression system for the production of scFvs especially for research purposes is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is also a host for bacteriophage M13 (Spadiut et\u00a0al. 2014). As expected, the expression level of various scFvs varied greatly, depending on different clones, despite a similar (65% identity) domain framework (Min and Yamabhai 2021).\nFor high sensitivity detection of biomolecules and the analysis of their interactions, Ab labeling with fluorescent probes, especially, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) is one of the most widely used organic fluorophores in various applications (Hermanson 2008; Holmes and Lantz 2001). FITC can react with the free amino group of folded proteins, leading to stable thiourea bond and fluorescent Abs. However, the FITC may conjugate with the antigen-binding site of Abs, resulting in a partial or complete loss of reactivity of the Ab to its antigen (Sakamoto et\u00a0al. 2012). To overcome these drawbacks, fusion of an Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Tsien 1998) with an scFv fragment, termed fluorobody, has been developed by genetic fusion of scFv to GFP. In this system, a direct conjugation of an scFv with a single GFP molecule (1:1 ratio) via a covalent bonding can improve the accuracy of quantitative analysis (Schwalbach et\u00a0al. 2000). However, despite the use of fluorobodies as bio-probes in various detection formats, such as immunolabeling (Schwalbach et\u00a0al. 2000), flow cytometry (Petrausch et\u00a0al. 2007), fluorescent-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA) (Oelschlaeger et\u00a0al. 2002), the folding efficacy and the yield were generally poor (e.g., for fluorobody against s-triazine, 90% of the fusions were insoluble and only 25% could be refolded in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS) (Oelschlaeger et\u00a0al. 2002). The yields of fluorobody against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Griep et\u00a0al. 1999) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) (Casey et\u00a0al. 2000a) was ~ 100 to 200\u00a0\u00b5g/L in E. coli XL1-Blue-MRFX'\nKan and Sure cells, respectively. This is likely because scFv has internal disulfide bonds (Ferr\u00e8 and Clote 2005a), which require an environment containing enzymes that can promote the formation of correct bond formation between two cysteine molecules, such as the periplasm of E. coli. This requires the optimization of secretion of the scFv into the periplasm, where GFP is known not to fold (Ke et\u00a0al. 2016). Further, the over-expression of protein in the periplasm to high yields in E. coli is known to be difficult to achieve (Karyolaimos and de Gier 2021; Olichon and Surrey 2007). To overcome these obstacles, E. coli SHuffle strains, which has been genetically engineered to promote correct disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm (Lobstein et\u00a0al. 2012), was selected as hosts for the expression of fluorobodies in this study. EmGFP (emerald GFP), which is a 27\u00a0kDa protein, derived from wildtype GFP (Ilagan et\u00a0al. 2010) by introducing mutations (S65T, S72A, N149K, M153T, I167T), exhibits improved folding at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, is highly detectable, and has excitation maximum at 487\u00a0nm and emission maximum at 509\u00a0nm (Cubitt et\u00a0al. 1999), was used as a fluorophorefusion in this study. A suitable expression vector to produce scFv-EmGFP fusion or scFv-EmGFP fluorobody was also developed. The fluorobodies against diverse targets; namely, virus, mycotoxin, cancer cells and bacteria, were created and used as representative bio-detection probes with a myriad of applications in molecular biology. Finally, binding characteristic and their applications for quantitative and qualitative analysis in different assay formats were demonstrated."

The scFv genes were cut from phagemid pMOD-1 vector that was used to construct the library, and subcloned into NcoI and NotI restriction sites of pWS-Green expression vector, such that scFv DNA fragment is fused with 5\u2032 end of the EmGFP, resulting in the expression of scFv-EmGFP fluorobody. The construct is fused with FLAG tag, followed by 6xHistidine tag at the C-terminus for further detection and one-step purification (Fig.\u00a01a). An example of the three-dimensional models of anti-bacterial scFvEmGFP, namely, yPac1A8-EmGFP and yPgi3G4-EmGFP, is shown in Fig.\u00a01b.\nExpression of\u00a0scFv\u2011EmGFP fusions from\u00a0different E. coli strains\nIn order to determine the suitable expression host for scFvEmGFP expression, two scFv-EmGFP constructs, i.e., sAFH-3e3-EmGFP (Rangnoi et\u00a0al. 2021) and yrPCE1A7EmGFP were transformed into three different strains of E. coli, namely wild type (wt) DE3 and engineered SHuffle B and SHuffle K12 strains. The transformed E. coli appeared fluorescent green as shown in Fig.\u00a02a. The level of fluorescence intensity was much higher for all E. coli strains expressing scFv-EmGFP when compared to EmGFP alone, as indicated by flow cytometry analysis (Fig.\u00a02b). This is likely because for the empty vector, RBS is positioned distal from EmGFP start codon (43\u00a0bp) as illustrated in Fig.\u00a01a. When scFv gene was subcloned between NcoI and NotI, the length between RBS and start codon is reduced (6\u00a0bp) to be optimal for translation, resulting in high level expression of the scFv-EmGFP fusion, which could be observed from cell lysate as bright fluorescent green as shown in Fig.\u00a02a. Next, the binding of scFv-EmGFP fusion expressed from 3 different strains were determined by FLISA and ELISA. Two, fluorobodies (sAFH-3e3-EmGFP and yrPCE1A7-EmGFP) were used as examples of this study. As demonstrated in Fig.\u00a02c\u00a0and Figure\u00a0S1, fluorobodies from engineered E. coli SHuffle B strain exhibited the highest binding activity among the three expression hosts when compared with engineered E. coli SHuffle K12 and DE3. Subsequently, all scFv-EmGFPs constructs were expressed in E. coli SHuffle B strain which has been genetically engineered to promote the formation for disulfide bonded proteins in the cytoplasm (Lobstein et\u00a0al. 2012).\n1 3"

            "text": "In order to demonstrate the board diversity of our nonimmunized human phage display antibody library (Pansri et\u00a0al. 2009), we selected and identified scFv binders to various targets, ranging from small molecule hapten to virus, bacteria and human cells (Min and Yamabhai 2021; Pansri et\u00a0al. 2009; Pranomphon et\u00a0al. 2018; Pruksametanan et\u00a0al. 2012; Rangnoi et\u00a0al. 2011, 2021; Sompunga et\u00a0al. 2019; Vu et\u00a0al. 2017). Functionality of the selected scFv binders fused to GFP as an in-built feature were validating using FLISA, flow cytometry and immunostaining, to determine their potential uses for various downstream applications. In this study, we described a rapid and simple cloning method to construct a fluorobody comprising of scFv linked to the N-terminus of EmGFP and express the resulting scFv-EmGFP fusion in the cytoplasm of an engineered E. coli. The cloning procedure facilitates subcloning of insert obtained from phage display vector (pMOD), directly into this scFv-EmGFP fusion plasmid (pWSGreen), without PCR amplification. Positioning a start codon too far from the ribosomal binding site in an empty EmGFP (43 nt) vector is the advantage of this expression system because only the clones harboring plasmids containing scFv insert will bring the start codon closer to the ribosomal binding site (6 nt), which is optimal for initiation of translation, resulting in a bright fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm of E. coli.\nTo discover the optimal E. coli strain for expression of scFv-EmGFP constructs, wt E. coli BL21 (DE3), redox engineered SHuffle K and SHuffle B strains were used to express various fluorobodies. SHuffle B strains lacking the two reductive pathways (\u0394trxB, \u0394gor) and expressing cytoplasmic disulfide bond isomerase (dsbC) was the ideal expression host, due to the disulfide bonds in scFv (Cys24/ Cys98 and Cys160-162/Cys227-229), which are identified by DiANNA 1.1 web server (Ferr\u00e8 and Clote 2005a, b, 2006)), required for correct folding, stability, and binding (Fass 2012; Huang et\u00a0al. 2006; W\u00f6rn and Pl\u00fcckthun 1998; Zhao et\u00a0al. 2010). However, the redox state of the whole scFv-EmGFP fusion, having 6 cysteines, remains to be characterized. Since the functionality of various fluorobodies have been demonstrated in this study, it is fair to conclude that any aberrant disulfide bond that may have formed in the scFv-EmGFP fusion, does not interfere with its functionality.\nThe position of GFP fusion relative to scFv appears to be critical for the functionality of fluorobody, i.e., fluorescent intensity and antigen binding properties. Previous reports have shown that GFP-scFv format was superior to scFv-GFP format when expressed in non-redox engineered E. coli strains. However, the GFP-scFv must be secreted into culture media (Liu et\u00a0al. 2019) or periplasm (Casey et\u00a0al. 2000b), or produced as inclusion bodies (Sakamoto\net\u00a0 al. 2012). In this study, we show that 5 functional scFv-GFP could be efficiently produced as soluble fusion protein in the cytoplasm using redox-engineered E. coli. Therefore, it can be stated that functional fluorobody both in the form of scFv-GFP or GFP-scFv can be produced if appropriate E. coli host is used for fluorobody expression.\nThe Ni2+ affinity chromatography was not able to purify the fluorobodies to homogeneity as observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.\u00a03b) and previous reports (Griep et\u00a0al. 1999; Oelschlaeger et\u00a0al. 2002). However, we also demonstrated that the crude and partial purified fluorobodies could be used for ELISA, FLISA, competitive FLISA, flow cytometry, cell internalization assay and immunofluorescence staining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on using yZEN2A8-EmGFP for Zearalenone detection by competitive FLISA immunoassay. The IC50 value was approximately threefold lower (higher sensitivity) than that of competitive ELISA using scFv (Sompunga et\u00a0al. 2019). In addition to reduction of assay time, since competitive FLISA signal is not amplified by conjugated secondary Ab and the enzyme reaction, the accuracy of quantitative analysis could be enhanced (Jeong et\u00a0al. 2014; Sakamoto et\u00a0al. 2012).\nEven if the limit of detection (LOD) of fluorobody against bacteria is higher than that of scFv-6xHis, the key advantage of using scFv-EmGFP fusion is being a one-step detection probe. Further optimization of the scFv-EmGFP construct such as fusion of GFP unit at N-terminal of scFv, optimization of the length of scFv-GFP linker or replace the EmGFP with a wide variety of mutated chromophore (Heim and Tsien 1996) might lead to improved detection sensitivity and applicable for detection of multiple strains.\nApplication of fluorobody for flow cytometry analysis has been previously reported (Petrausch et\u00a0al. 2007). In their study, unlike our fluorobody produced in engineered E. coli expression system, the fluorobody was produced by yeast expression. Live cell imaging is useful for tracking cellular mechanism. The use of fluorobody allows a direct visualization of cells, avoiding the staining steps required for scFv detection. Here, we demonstrated that the y1HL63D6-EmGFP could be endocytosed into HL-60 target cells (Fig.\u00a06b). Similar application of scFv fusion to C-terminus of GFP for cell-based analysis of LDL uptake mechanisms using GFP-scFv against LDL has been reported (Cardinale et\u00a0al. 2004; Faulin et\u00a0al. 2014).\nCurrently, blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red, far-red, and infra-red fluorescent proteins are available for biomolecular applications (Day and Davidson 2009). Data presented in this study demonstrated that fluorobody platform is a suitable format for many diagnostic applications which can be extended to fusions to other GFP variants, for multiplex assays.\nIn conclusion, this research shows that our bacterial expression platform using engineered E. coli SHuffle B strain is suitable to produce fluorobodies for the detection of a wide variety of targets.\n1 3\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00253- 023- 12395-6.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge Natcha Pruksamethanan and Pensuda Sompunga for their technical assistants regarding the construction and characterization of fluorobody against rabies and ZEN, respectively.\nAuthor contribution WS constructed the scFv-EmGFP (fluorobody) expression vector, performed preliminary experiments, and wrote the first draft, TTM was responsible for the results of fluorobody against bacteria and 3D structure modeling, KR was responsible for the results of fluorobody against mycotoxin, TS was responsible for the results of fluorobody against cancer cell, MB supervised experiments on E. coli expression, 3D structure modelling and edited the manuscript.
