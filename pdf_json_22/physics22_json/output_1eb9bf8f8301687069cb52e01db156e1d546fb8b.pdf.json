            "text": "Accretion onto a magnetized star is a classical problem in astrophysics. This includes accretion onto neutron stars, (Basko & Sunyaev 1975; Ghosh & Lamb 1979; Ghosh et al. 1977; Bildsten et al. 1997; Mushtukov & Tsygankov 2022), accretion onto WDs - Intermediate Polars (Ferrario et al. 2015), and in young protostars (Shu et al. 1994; McKee & Ostriker 2007; Zanni & Ferreira 2009, 2013).\nIn an accepted picture (Lamb et al. 1973; Ghosh et al. 1977; Lipunov et al. 1992), steady state accretion disks tends to have the inner edge of the accretion disk near the corotation radius. The disk material first moves inward through the disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), and later on couples, through some kind of dissipative processes (Arons & Lea 1976) to the magnetosphere and flows onto the central star.\nMany models agree on the fact that for accretion to occur the truncation radius Rin of the disk is located inside the corotation radius (e.g., Miller & Stone 1997). For oblique case, accretion takes a form of funnel flows (Romanova et al. 2002; Bessolaz et al. 2008).\nIn this paper we consider effects of gravitational attraction and centrifugal barrier. As the plasma inside the inner edge of the disk is expected to be magnetically dominated, it can flow mostly along magnetic field lines. We consider several cases (pure dipole and/or magnetosphere distorted by the currents in the disk (see Abolmasov & Biryukov 2020, for a somewhat related treatment). Presence of the accretion barrier has been discussed in a number of works (Syunyaev & Shakura 1977; Lipunov et al. 1992; Spruit & Taam 1993; D\u2019Angelo & Spruit 2012). It was typically assumed that the barrier is located outside of the corotation. We demonstrate that it is slightly inside for the aligned case."

There is gravitational attraction acceleration\nFg = \u2212 GM\nr2 er (1)\n(er is a spherical radial unit vector). For matter bound to the magnetic field lines rotating with the star at frequency \u2126 there is also a centrifugal acceleration\nFc = r\u2126 2e$ (2)\n(e$ is a cylindrical radial unit vector). The total force acting on a particles is Ftot = Fg + Fc. For a particle trying to fall onto the magnetized central star along the dipolar magnetic field, the important parameter is the projection of the force Ftot along the local magnetic field. For some configurations the resulting force will try to pull the particles inward (hence accretion), for some cases the centrifugal repulsion (along the magnetic field) will dominates - the centrifugal barrier. In what follows we assumes that the disk plane is perpendicular to the spin of the central star - the spin is along z axis, the disk is in the x\u2212 y plane. Let\u2019s consider the aligned case, when the magnetic moment is aligned with the spin. In the (arbitrary) x \u2212 z plane the unit magnetic field is\nb =\n{ 3 \u221a 2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n5 + \u221a 3 cos(2\u03b8) , 1 + 3 cos(2\u03b8)\u221a 10 + 6 cos(2\u03b8)\n} (3)\n(this is unit magnetic field vector in Cartesian coordinates {x, z}, expressed as function of polar angle \u03b8).

The scaling sin\u22122/3 \u03b8 is known (Lipunov et al. 1992). Importantly, the centrifugal barrier is located inside the corotation radius, extending from (2/3)1/3Rc to Rc. Within the barrier particle leaving the disk would be pushed back by the dominant centrifugal force. (The field lines that extend to Rc crosses the null line at sin \u03b8 = (2/3) 1/8). Taken at face value: for an aligned rotator accretion from the co-rotation radius is impossible - the disk should extend to the inner radius Rin less than the radius of the centrifugal barrier Rcb, Rin \u2264 Rcb \u2264 Rc."

Penetration of the accreting material through rotating magnetosphere has been considered by a number of authors - theoretically (Arons & Lea 1976; Spruit & Taam 1993) and numerically (e.g., Long et al. 2005). The critical issue is the role of MHD instabilities in the transition layer. The magnetic field, being a \u201clight fluid\u201d is likely to become \u201cporous\u201d via development of tearing and or ballooning/flute instabilities. Rotation adds another complication: shearing of the inner edge of the disk. The question is whether instabilities would provide a nearly constant flow (similar to the case of Solar hedgerow prominences Chae 2010), will be dominated by rare major disruptions, or, most likely, a combination thereof. On the one hand, observations of the type-II X-ray bursts in accreting neutron stars seem to indicate rare major disruptions: the fluence in a type II burst is proportional to the waiting time to the next burst (Lewin et al. 1993). On the other hand the Rapid Burster occasionally behaves as a normal Low Mass X-ray Binary, not showing type II bursts - a possible interpretation is that during this state penetration of the material into the magnetosphere is dominated by by numerous small-scale instabilities. The fact that persistent X-ray luminosity (presumably due to continuous plasma penetration and time-average type-II X-ray bursts luminosity are of the same order (but may vary by a factor of a few Lewin et al. 1993) indicates that both precesses (quasi-steady and catastrophic accretion) are important. Our model is not much different from the standard one, that material is accumulated near the inner edge of the disk, and is damped occasionally - with the subtle difference that matter accumulation occurs not outside the corotation, but outside the centrifugal barrier at Rcb. A clear perdition is that the type-II X-ray bursters are nearly aligned rotators (e.g., van den Eijnden et al. 2017). This is consistent with the fact that the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335 does not show pulsations. Breaking of the centrifugal barrier is expected to be nearly axisymmetric in this case (see also Spruit & Taam 1993; Romanova et al. 2012; Bagnoli et al. 2015)."

First, disk shadowing is observed in some protoplanetary disks (e.g., Mayama et al. 2018). In the present model there are four regions of enhanced density with the magnetosphere: two accretion streams, plus two regions of trapped centrifugally-barriered material. Both can absorb/scatter radiation from the central star. But as they are symmetric, we expect two shadows on the outer disk. Two shadows per period are indeed inferred. Periodic intensity dips are observed e.g., in some T Tauri stars (\u201cdippers\u201d, Bouvier et al. 1999) and X-Ray binaries\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\n(Parmar et al. 1986). Both the streams and trapped material can lead to absorption of radiation from the central star, potentially producing two dips per period. Also, in the critical case, Fig. 3 top row, material from the edge of the disk can both be accreted (top hemisphere) and ejected (bottom hemisphere). This can potentially create four streams, two in each hemisphere. The centrifugally-barriered material will be periodically centrifugally expelled.

            "text": "We reconsidered the basic properties of accretion onto a magnetized central star using a number of idealized models for the magnetosphere: pure dipole and dipole plus diamagnetic disk. First, for the pure dipolar field, we find that for small magnetic inclination angles accretion from the disk extending down to just the corotation radius is impossible - the inner edge of the disk should be at Rcb = (2/3) 1/3Rc = 0.87Rc. For higher magnetic obliquity angles accretion proceeds along two counter-aligned streams, the funnel flows. The width of the funnel flows increases with magnetic obliquity, but they remain separated. If the inner edge of the disk is at radii smaller that (2/3)1/3Rc then accretion can proceed at every azimuth point, forming two accretion curtains each spanning \u2265 180\u25e6 near each pole. Second, we consider magnetospheres distorted by the disk - from the complete confinement of the field by the disk, to balanced configurations that produce no force on the disk. In these aligned cases the centrifugal barrier can be as deep as 0.71Rc (for the confined dipole), All the models we considered (pure dipole, purely confined dipole, and magnetically balanced disk) are surely mathematical idealization, but they are likely to \u201cbracket\u201d the more realistic cases. Pure dipole is the extreme resistive case (when the disk does not affect the dipolar magnetospheric structure); purely confined dipole is the extreme ideal case, when the confined field cannot break out through the disk; magnetically balanced disk assumes that the confined magnetic field was able to break out and relax to balanced configuration."
