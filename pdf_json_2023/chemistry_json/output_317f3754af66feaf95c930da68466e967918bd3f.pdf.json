    "abstractText": "The main aim of this study was to evaluate the oils from chamomile seeds as a new source of bioactive compounds suitable for human consumption. A green extraction technique with supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2) at pressures up to 450 bar and temperatures up to 60 \u00b0C was employed for the production of a high amount of biologically active oil. Additionally, exhausted waste material was re-extracted using sc-CO2 with the addition of ethanol. By optimization in operating pressure, temperature, production cost, fraction of milled seeds, and co-solvent addition, the amount of separated chamomile oil increased from 2.4 to 18.6% and the content of unsaturated fatty acids up to 88.7%. Oils contained \u03b1-bisabolol oxide A and B in amounts up to 1.4%. Linoleic acid was detected in an amount up to 711.1 mg/g and \u03b1-linolenic acid up to 27.5 mg/g. The total phenolic content in separated oil reached 80.4 mg GAE/g while the total flavonoid content reached 11.6 mg QE/g. The obtained chamomile oils showed antioxidant activity with an IC50 of up to 3.9 mg/mL. Among the 23 tested microorganisms, the antimicrobial activity of oils was the most pronounced against Gram-positive bacteria. The cytotoxic activity of oils was tested on normal and cancer-derived cell lines. Results indicated a significant potential for oil from chamomile seeds, produced in an eco-friendly manner, as a functional food.",

This highlights functional oils derived from plants that contain essential fatty acids, antioxidants, and phenolics (Fregapane et\u00a0al., 2020; Lyashenko et\u00a0al., 2019). The importance of functional oils in the diet and their health benefits gave consumers awareness of what they eat and how their diet can help reduce disease risks for better life quality (Fregapane et\u00a0al., 2020). These oils are commercially obtained from seeds (e.g., milk thistle and linseed) and nuts (e.g., pistachio and walnut). In the light of mentioned food trend, the present study was aimed at exploring chamomile seeds as a new source of functional * Stoja Milovanovic smilovanovic@tmf.bg.ac.rs 1 Faculty of\u00a0Technology and\u00a0Metallurgy, University of\u00a0Belgrade, Karnegijeva 4, 11120\u00a0Belgrade, Serbia 2 \u0141ukasiewicz Research Network- New Chemical Syntheses Institute, Al.

Chamomile plant is an annual herb with thin, joint, and fibrous roots. The hairy stems are branched and erected (height up to 0.3\u00a0m) with the narrow and long leaves divided into thread-like segments (Lebanna, 2005). Flower heads (diameter of 10 to 30\u00a0mm) are pedunculate, heterogamous, and separately placed (Mihyaoui et\u00a0al., 2022). The golden yellow tubular florets with 5 teeth are 1.5 to 2.5\u00a0mm long and always ending in a glandulous tube. The 11 to 27 white plant flowers are 6 to 11\u00a0mm long and 3.5\u00a0mm wide and arranged concentrically (Mihyaoui et\u00a0al., 2022). The receptacle is 6 to 8\u00a0mm wide, flat in the beginning, and conical. The seeds are yellowish-brown cypsela (i.e., one-seeded dehiscent fruit derived from a bicarpellate ovary with a single chamber) with 3\u20135 ribs (Mihyaoui et\u00a0al., 2022; Shil & Mukherjee, 2016; Skilbeck et\u00a0al., 2019). Although the chamomile plant has been consumed worldwide in the form of various teas for centuries, to the best of our knowledge, its seeds have never been used before for the production of functional oils suitable for human consumption.\nOne of the most popular chamomile varieties is Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile, Asteraceae), a traditional herb that can be used externally and internally for medicinal purposes due to its antibacterial, antifungal, anti-spasmodic, anti-allergic, antipyretic, analgesic, antiseptic, and carminative properties (Lebanna, 2005; Scalia et\u00a0al., 1999; Srivastava et\u00a0al., 2010). For local applications, chamomile extracts can be used as ointments and inhalations to treat skin rashes, nasal inflammation, ear and eye infections, etc. (Catani et\u00a0al., 2021; Srivastava et\u00a0al., 2010; Stanojevic et\u00a0al., 2016). Internally, chamomile infusions can be taken to battle indigestion, poor appetite, flatulence, diarrhea, and nausea (Lebanna, 2005; Srivastava et\u00a0al., 2010). It was reported that a mixture of chamomile essential oil and flour can treat the indurations of the spleen and liver (Lebanna, 2005). Chamomile can also decrease the pain associated with migraine, inflamed joints, arthritis, etc. (Catani et\u00a0al., 2021; Lebanna, 2005; Srivastava et\u00a0al., 2010). Furthermore, several studies have found that chamomile extracts inhibit normal cell growth while significantly reducing the viability of various human cancer cell lines (Al-Dabbagh et\u00a0al., 2019; Sak et\u00a0al., 2017; Srivastava et\u00a0al., 2010). The mentioned notable activities are ascribed to a complex mixture of different compounds found in chamomile extracts, mainly flavonoids, terpenes, esters, phenolics, and fatty acids (Lebanna, 2005; Povh et\u00a0al., 2001; Rahimi et\u00a0al., 2011; Srivastava et\u00a0al., 2010).\nThe interest in separating bioactive compounds from plants for new or improved applications has motivated researchers to find new renewable sources or develop new techniques such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). This technique, which has a \u201cgreen\u201d label, enables sustainable extraction with a decrease in solvent consumption and its recycling (Kulkarni et\u00a0al., 2017). One of the most significant advantages of using supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) as a\nsolvent for SFE is its complete removal from the final extract (Marques et\u00a0al., 2016). The SFE technique proved to be very efficient for the extraction of lipids and other non-polar compounds. For the extraction of polar compounds, the addition of a small amount of a polar co-solvent to sc-CO2 is required (Al-Suod et\u00a0al., 2019; Ferrentino et\u00a0al., 2019; Lebanna, 2005; Reverchon & Senatore, 1994; Scalia et\u00a0al., 1999). Several reports in the available literature described the separation of bioactive extracts from chamomile flowers, flower heads, and herb material using SFE (Al-Suod et\u00a0al., 2019; \u010ci\u017emek et\u00a0al., 2021; Kaiser et\u00a0al., 2004; Kotnik et\u00a0al., 2007; Lebanna, 2005; Omidbaigi et\u00a0al., 2003; Peki\u0107 et\u00a0al., 1995; Povh et\u00a0al., 2001; Rahimi et\u00a0al., 2011; Reverchon & Senatore, 1994; Scalia et\u00a0al., 1999; Zekovic, 2000). However, the present study is the first one to explore the separation of high-quality oils suitable for human consumption from chamomile seeds using the SFE process. For the first time, the obtained chamomile oils were characterized in terms of composition (fatty acids, total phenolic, and total flavonoid content), antioxidant activity, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic potential. This manuscript is an attempt to unlock the new food potential of the chamomile plant, a commercially cultivated sustainable biomass."

            "text": "Seeds were milled and sieved to obtain two fractions: Fr I with an average particle size of 0.20\u00a0mm (Fig.\u00a0S1a) and Fr II with an average particle size of 0.38\u00a0mm (Fig. S1b). First, Fr I was used for oil production and the obtained results can be seen in Fig.\u00a01a.\nTo obtain a large amount of oil during the extraction process, the operating pressure was increased from 300 to 450 bars, and the temperature was raised from 40 to 60\u00a0\u00b0C. However, results show that an increase in temperature led to a slight decrease in extraction yield from 2.7 to 2.4% (at 300\u00a0bar) and from 4.1 to 3.6% (at 450\u00a0bar). The same observation was previously reported for chamomile flowers extracted at temperatures 36 \u2212 64\u00a0 \u00b0C and pressures 80 \u2212 152\u00a0bar (Lebanna, 2005). In addition, it can be seen that an increase in pressure from 300 to 450\u00a0bar at 40\u00a0\u00b0C increased the extraction yield (Fig.\u00a01a). These results\n1 3\nconfirm that oil separation from chamomile seeds follows the change in solvent density, i.e., sc-CO2 solvating power (Milovanovic et\u00a0al., 2013; Pereira & Meireles, 2010). Specifically, an increase in sc-CO2 density from 830 to 975\u00a0kg/ m3 increased the extraction yield from seeds. An amount of separated oils from Fr I of chamomile seeds is in agreement with previously reported values for chamomile flowers and herbs such as 1.9, 3.4, and 3.8% obtained from chamomile flowers/flowerheads at a temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C and pressures of 90, 202.6, and 250\u00a0bar, respectively (Kotnik et\u00a0al., 2007; Lebanna, 2005; Reverchon & Senatore, 1994).\nBesides the amount of separated oil from chamomile seeds, the costs of its production were an additional parameter that was estimated for the selection of the best pressure and temperature extraction conditions. The estimation of costs for the first year of industrial production of chamomile seed oils, based on parameters presented in the \u201cCost Estimation for Chamomile Oil Production\u201d subsection and\ndata presented in Fig.\u00a01a, is shown in Table\u00a01. It can be seen that the variation in yearly labor costs did not have a significant effect on the manufacturing cost (COM) as the yearly price of electricity had. The lowest price of chamomile oil would have been achieved in the year 2020, when the price of wholesale electricity was the lowest. Similar to our calculations, it was reported that slight variations in the price of labor costs do not have a significant share in the total COM for high-volume extraction vessels (Huang et\u00a0al., 2020). In addition, a substantial contributor to the estimated price of chamomile oil production is the price of raw material, as previously reported (Huang et\u00a0al., 2020). The price of the produced oil ranged from 534 to 1714 EUR/kg, due to the relatively high price of chamomile seeds of ca. 10 EUR/ kg and relatively low extraction yield of up to 4%. Namely, previously reported estimated price for the milk thistle oil production ranged from 36 to 57 EUR/kg due to the seed price of ca. 2 EUR/kg and extraction yield of up to 26%\n1 3\n(Milovanovic et\u00a0al.,\u00a02022c). Also, it was reported that the estimated price for pistachio extract ranged from 713 to 876 EUR/kg due to leaves price of ca. 1 EUR/kg and an extraction yield of up to 0.3% (Aydi et\u00a0al., 2020). By comparing chamomile oil manufacturing costs, it can be seen that the lowest estimated price can be achieved for the extraction process conducted at a pressure of 450\u00a0bar and temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on this result, the stated pressure and temperature conditions were selected for further investigation.\nIn order to produce high amounts of high-quality oils, further extraction processes were performed by varying the seeds\u2019 pretreatment at optimal pressure and temperature (450\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C). For this purpose, Fr II, Fr I and Fr II with the addition of ethanol (denoted as Fr I + Et and Fr II + Et), and exhausted Fr I and Fr II with the addition of ethanol (denoted as FrE I + Et and FrE II + Et) were subjected to extraction. The chamomile seed structure and steps for its pretreatment enabled the preparation of two different fractions (Fr I and Fr II). Namely, chamomile seeds are composed of the pericarp, endosperm, and embryo. While the pericarp has a thickness of only 65 \u2212 72\u00a0\u03bcm, the embryo takes a major part of the chamomile seed (Shil & Mukherjee, 2016). During milling, seed walls crack releasing the seeds\u2019 inner content. The seed\u2019s kernel (endosperm and embryo) is easily crushed, while the pericarp gets only slightly damaged at the beginning of the milling (Milovanovic et\u00a0al.,\u00a02022b). This occurrence, combined with sieving, enables the separation and collection of material with smaller particle size mostly composed from seeds\u2019 kernel, i.e., Fr I (Fig.\u00a0S1a). After separation of Fr I, most of the remaining milled material is composed of chamomile seeds\u2019 pericarp, i.e., Fr II (Fig.\u00a0S1b). The color of the tested plant material differs between fractions (beige for Fr I and dark brown for Fr II).\nThese different ratios of pericarp to kernel in milled chamomile seeds could be one of the reasons for the different extraction results obtained for Fr I and Fr II presented in Fig.\u00a01b. Oil secretory glands that are located in the pericarp of chamomile seeds (Skilbeck et\u00a0al., 2019) can be responsible for the extraction yield of 18.6% obtained for Fr II (pericarp rich fraction) while the extraction yield for Fr I (kernel rich fraction) was 4.5-fold lower. A similar value of 19% extraction yield for chamomile seeds was reported for conventional extraction that employed hexane as a solvent (Pereira et\u00a0al., 2005). An additional difference between fractions is their particle size. Although Fr I had a smaller particle size, which is advised for improving extraction efficacy, Fr II contained so significantly higher amount of extractible compounds that not even a larger particle size could impede SFE. Namely, Kaiser et\u00a0al. (2004) stated that a decrease in chamomile flower particle size from 3.2 to 0.5\u00a0mm increases extractability due to the reduction in mass transfer resistance, which was not the case for the plant material tested in this study.\nBesides variation in the milled seed fraction selected for oil production, the addition of co-solvent was tested for improvement in the extraction yield and oil quality. It was interesting to see that the addition of ethanol to sc-CO2 led to a decrease in extraction yields for both Fr I (from 4.1 to 3.2%) and Fr II (from 18.6 to 13.1%) because the addition of a co-solvent during SFE usually increases the amount of separated extract from plant material. For instance, Kaiser et\u00a0al. (2004) reported that methanol as a co-solvent increased the extraction yield for chamomile flowers from 9.6 to 16.3% at 100\u00a0bar and 70\u00a0\u00b0C. However, this is not the case for oil-rich plant materials. Namely, it was reported that the addition of ethanol to sc-CO2 for separation of"

Sc-CO2 is a non-polar solvent and its ability to dissolve polar compounds is limited. The addition of a co-solvent to sc-CO2 ameliorates the extraction efficiency of polar compounds by increasing their solubility (Ferrentino et\u00a0al., 2019). This would mean that the content of polar compounds like polyphenols in separated oil increased while the content of nonpolar compounds like fatty acids decreased. This hypothesis was further tested by analysis of obtained oils.\nAfter the plant material (Fr I and Fr II) was exhausted at 450\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C using neat sc-CO2, an attempt was made towards separating the remaining compounds using ethanol as a co-solvent. Exhausted plant materials are a valuable source of bioactive compounds that could be reextracted using sc-CO2 with a co-solvent, which was previously demonstrated for milk thistle seeds primarily defatted using petroleum ether (Lukic\u00a0et al., 2022a). The result from the current study shows that chamomile seed waste material could be re-extracted, achieving extraction yields of 2.1 and 2.6% for Fr I and Fr II, respectively. The reasons for the separation of the additional oil are numerous. For instance, the operating time of the first SFE was not sufficient to enable complete plant material exhaustion; the oil could not pass through cell walls since a part of cells containing oil remained intact; remaining extractible compounds were more tightly bonded to the cell structure matrix; more polar components with higher solubility in ethanol remained in seeds after exhaustion with sc-CO2; remaining extractible compounds had a significantly lower affinity towards sc-CO2 compared to compounds primarily extracted, etc. (Lukic et\u00a0al., 2022a, b)."

            "text": "The results of GC/MS analysis for chamomile oils are presented in Table\u00a02. It can be seen that oils contain about 10.4 \u2212 13.1% of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and about 80.3 \u2212 88.7% of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA). This UFA content in chamomile oils is higher compared with UFA content in mango seed kernel oils (52 \u2212 56%) (Choudhary et\u00a0al., 2022) and melon seeds (83.7%) (Bimakr et\u00a0al., 2016). Chamomile seed oils also have higher content of poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) compared with olive seed oils (which was around 17.0%) (Ranalli et\u00a0al., 2009), fennel seed oil (12.8%) (Bettaieb Rebey et\u00a0al., 2019), and anise seed oil (25.0%) (Bettaieb Rebey et\u00a0al., 2019). It can be seen that the dominant compound is linoleic fatty acid, reaching values from 63.2 to 77.8%. Besides linoleic acid, the main constituents of oils were palmitic (from 9.2 to 11.6%) and oleic fatty acid (from 8.7 to 11.8%). Oil from chamomile seeds obtained by extraction with hexane contained 69.5% linoleic acid, 12.5% palmitic acid, and 13.1% oleic acid (Pereira et\u00a0al., 2005). When compared to the previously reported fatty acid composition of chamomile essential oil (Hmamou et\u00a0al., 2012), oils from chamomile seeds obtained in this study contained a similar amount of palmitic acid; a lower amount of stearic acid, \u03b1-linolenic acid, and oleic acid; and a higher amount of linoleic acid and palmitoleic acid. For instance, the content of linoleic acid in chamomile essential oil was 54.8% (Hmamou et\u00a0al., 2012). Also, it was reported that supercritical extracts from chamomile flowers contained 2.8% of both palmitic and linoleic acid (Rahimi et\u00a0al., 2011).\nIt was interesting to note that \u03b1-bisabolol oxide A and B were only present up to 1.4% in the oil obtained from Fr\n1 3\nI. These values are comparable to previously reported values found in supercritical extracts from chamomile flowers obtained at 250\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C (Rahimi et\u00a0al., 2011). However, Kotnik et\u00a0al. (2007) reported bisabolol content to be 0.025% in chamomile flowerheads obtained at the same conditions. Pekic et\u00a0al. (1995) also found up to 1% \u03b1-bisabolol oxide A and B summary content in the extract obtained at 80\u00a0bar and 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Results obtained in the current study are especially significant considering the anti-flogistic, antispasmodic, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, sedative, and vermifuge properties of \u03b1-bisabolol (Povh et\u00a0 al., 2001; Rahimi et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe use of ethanol as a co-solvent for extraction from Fr I and Fr II had a variable effect on the separation of fatty acids. While the addition of ethanol reduced the linoleic acid content of the oil from Fr I, it increased the \u03b1-linolenic acid content from 0.65 to 1.35%. For Fr II, the effect of ethanol addition on the content of mentioned unsaturated fatty acids was vice versa. Similarly, it was reported that ethanol as a co-solvent to sc-CO2 increased the content of linoleic acid while it decreased the content of oleic acid in oils from milk thistle seeds (Lukic et\u00a0al., 2022a) and brewer\u2019s spent grain (Ferrentino et\u00a0al., 2019). It is interesting to notice that chamomile oils obtained from exhausted plant material (FrE I + Et and FrE II + Et) contained almost the same fatty acids as oils obtained from native plant material. A similar observation was reported for supercritical oil from hemp seeds primarily extracted by cold pressing (Lukic et\u00a0al.,\u00a02022b).\nThe quantitative content of dominant fatty acids present in chamomile oils was determined using a GC/FID method, and the results are presented in Fig.\u00a02. It can be seen that the content of palmitic and oleic acids is only slightly changing with a change in chamomile seeds\u2019 pretreatment. However, the content of stearic and linoleic acids is changing with pretreatment achieving the highest values of 15.4 and 711.1\u00a0mg/g, respectively, in the oil obtained from Fr II. The detected content of linoleic acid present in oil from chamomile seeds is one of the highest ever reported. For instance, it was reported that the contents of linoleic acid in supercritical oil from milk thistle and dandelion seeds were 514.8 and 658.3\u00a0mg/g, respectively (Milovanovic et\u00a0al.,\u00a02022a, b). In addition, it was reported that commercial oils obtained by conventional methods also contain smaller amounts of linoleic acid such as linseeds (150\u00a0mg/g) (Matth\u00e4us & \u00d6zcan, 2015), peanut seeds (283\u00a0mg/g) (Matth\u00e4us & \u00d6zcan, 2015), soybeans (340\u00a0mg/g) (Rymer et\u00a0al., 2011), and cotton seeds (563\u00a0mg/g) (Matth\u00e4us & \u00d6zcan, 2015). To the best of our knowledge, only a higher value of linoleic acid content was reported for safflower oil (Orsavova et\u00a0al., 2015).\nThe content of \u03b1-linolenic acid in chamomile oils ranged from 0.5 to 27.5\u00a0mg/g. The highest amount was found in the oil obtained from Fr I with ethanol as a co-solvent (Fr I + Et) as shown in Fig.\u00a02e. Obtained values of \u03b1-linolenic acid content\nare comparable to supercritical extracts from, e.g., silverweed (which was in the range from 0.32 to 0.78\u00a0mg/g) (Luan et\u00a0al., 2022), wheat bran (37.3\u00a0mg/g) (Rebolleda et\u00a0al., 2020), or grape seeds (5.2\u00a0mg/g) (Barriga-S\u00e1nchez et\u00a0al., 2021).\nOnly two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans and both can be found in chamomile seed oils: \u03b1-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). This information is especially important considering the numerous beneficial effects of essential fatty acids on human health such as antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic activity (Orsavova et\u00a0al., 2015)."

Analysis showed that oils obtained from Fr I had total phenolic content (TPC) of 29.1\u00a0mg GAE/g and that oils from Fr II contained 20.3\u00a0mg GAE/g of phenolic compounds. These results were significantly higher compared with the recent report for TPC found in supercritical extracts from chamomile herbs obtained at 200\u00a0bar and 48\u00a0\u00b0C, which was 2.3\u00a0mg GAE/g (\u010ci\u017emek et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, values recorded in the present study are higher compared with TPC found in functional oils from other plant materials like pistachio (up to 12.2\u00a0mg GAE/g) (Fregapane et\u00a0al., 2020), walnut (up to 19.0\u00a0mg GAE/g) (Fregapane et\u00a0al., 2020), canola seed (around 0.4\u00a0mg GAE/mL) (Fadairo et\u00a0al., 2022), and brewer\u2019s spent grain (4.6 \u2212 8.4\u00a0mg GAE/g) (Ferrentino et\u00a0al., 2019).\nThe addition of ethanol as a co-solvent had a slight influence on TPC. The TPC value increased from 29.1 to 31.5\u00a0mg GAE/g for samples obtained from Fr I and from 20.3 to 20.5\u00a0mg GAE/g for samples obtained from Fr II, respectively. The obtained results are comparable to the content of phenolic compounds found in chamomile flower ethanolic extracts (Al-Dabbagh et\u00a0al., 2019; Catani et\u00a0al., 2021). The highest value of TPC (80.4\u00a0mg GAE/g) was recorded for the sample FrE I + Et that was re-extracted using co-solvent ethanol. It can be assumed that, after the removal of nonpolar compounds in the first extraction process, the remaining more polar phenolic compounds could be re-extracted in the second SFE with polar co-solvent.\nValues of TPC found in oils from chamomile seeds in the present study, which range from 20.3 to 80.4\u00a0mg GAE/g, are higher compared with previously reported TPC in oils obtained by SFE from various seeds. Namely, oil from milk thistle seeds contained 9.2 \u2212 14.2\u00a0mg GAE/g (Milovanovic, 2022b), dandelion seeds contained 5.5 \u2212 12.1\u00a0mg GAE/g\u00a0 (Milovanovic et\u00a0al.,\u00a02022a), grape seeds contained 0.1\u00a0mg GAE/g (Barriga-S\u00e1nchez et\u00a0al., 2021), purslane seeds contained 1.7\u00a0mg GAE/g (Sodeifian et\u00a0al., 2018), burdock seeds contained 1.2\u00a0mg GAE/g (Stefanov et\u00a0al., 2022), melon seeds\n1 3\n1 3\ncontained 42.8\u00a0mg GAE/g (Bimakr et\u00a0al., 2016), fennel seeds contained 0.5\u00a0mg GAE/g (Bettaieb Rebey et\u00a0al., 2019), and anise seeds contained 0.9 GAE/g (Bettaieb Rebey et\u00a0al., 2019)."

Namely, TFC in Fr I of 2.1\u00a0mg QE/g was higher compared with that in Fr II (0.3\u00a0mg QE/g). Addition of ethanol as a co-solvent increased TFC in chamomile oil from 2.1 to 4.2\u00a0mg QE/g and from 0.3 to 0.8\u00a0mg QE/g for Fr I and Fr II, respectively. The highest value of TFC (11.6\u00a0mg QE/g) was recorded for the sample FrE I + Et\nthat was re-extracted using co-solvent ethanol. This finding is in agreement with the results of Kaiser et\u00a0al.

These values are slightly lower compared to previously reported TFC found in ethanolic extracts from chamomile flowers, which ranged from 15.3 to 27.3\u00a0mg/g (Catani et\u00a0al., 2021). However, values obtained in the present study are similar or higher compared with previously reported TFC for oils obtained from various seeds using SFE.

Selected parameters for the method used in this study were validated by the analysis of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of vitamin C. This analysis showed that the required vitamin C concentration to scavenge 50% of DPPH radicals (IC50) was 10.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, which is in the range of literature reports. This test was used to assess the antioxidant activity of obtained oils. The results presented in Fig.\u00a03c as IC50 value show that the antioxidant activity of oils follows the trend of TFC (Fig.\u00a03b). The addition of ethanol as a co-solvent led to the separation of compounds that show stronger antioxidant activity. In addition, oil obtained from exhausted plant material (sample FrE I + Et) showed the best DPPH radical scavenging activity with IC50 of 3.9\u00a0mg/mL.\nValues of IC50 found for oils from chamomile seeds ranged from 3.9 to 16.0\u00a0mg/mL. These results are in agreement with previously reported IC50 of 2.1 \u2212 3.3\u00a0mg/mL for chamomile flowers essential oil (Stanojevic et\u00a0al., 2016). In addition, it was previously reported that a solution of an extract from chamomile herbs obtained at 200\u00a0bar and 48\u00a0\u00b0C in a concentration of 25\u00a0mg/mL inhibits DPPH radicals around 90% (\u010ci\u017emek et\u00a0al., 2021). Results obtained in this study are better compared with previously reported ones for oils from various seeds separated by SFE. Namely, it was reported that IC50 value for oils from milk thistle seeds was in the range 12.7 \u2212 24.4\u00a0mg/mL (Milovanovic, 2022b), hemp seeds was 9.2\u00a0mg/mL (Hong et\u00a0al., 2015), and burdock seed was 54.5\u00a0mg/mL (Stefanov et\u00a0al., 2022)."

Chamomile oils showed differential activity against the tested reference bacteria (MIC values from 0.02 to \u2265 10\u00a0mg/ mL) and yeasts (MIC = 1.25\u201310\u00a0mg/mL), which depended on the seeds\u2019 pretreatment. Oils demonstrated relatively low activity against Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values in the range from 5 to \u2265 10\u00a0mg/mL. All oils showed the highest activity against Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus with MIC values ranging from 0.3 to 0.6\u00a0mg/mL, 0.02 to 0.3\u00a0mg/mL, and 0.16 to 1.25\u00a0mg/mL, respectively. The same stronger activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative\nbacteria was previously reported for oils obtained from dandelion seeds (Milovanovic et\u00a0al.,\u00a02022a) and mango seeds (Choudhary et\u00a0al., 2022). It was also previously reported that essential oil from chamomile flowers has stronger activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus compared with Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Stanojevic et\u00a0al., 2016). The antifungal activity of tested chamomile oils was almost unified against Candida strains. Oils showed good activity against all tested yeasts with MIC ranging from 1.25 to 10\u00a0mg/mL.\nIt is interesting to notice that oils from Fr II, Fr II + Et, and FrE II + Et showed stronger antibacterial and antifungal activity even though they contained lower amounts of TPC, TFC, and DPPH radicals scavenging compounds compared with oils from Fr I, Fr I + Et, and FrE I + Et. One of the reasons for this occurrence could be the higher amount of linoleic acid present in oils from Fr II, Fr II + Et, and FrE II + Et. Namely, linoleic acid has been found to have antibacterial activity, particularly in inhibiting the growth of Grampositive bacteria (Dilika et\u00a0al., 2000; Kusumah et\u00a0al., 2020). It was reported that the MIC value of linoleic acid against Bacillus subtilis is 0.02\u00a0mg/mL (Kusumah et\u00a0al., 2020), Bacillus cereus is 0.01\u00a0mg/mL (Dilika et\u00a0al., 2000), and Staphylococcus aureus is 1.0\u00a0mg/mL (Dilika et\u00a0al., 2000). Similar MIC values were obtained in the present study for these bacteria. Nonetheless, additional research is required to determine which compounds have a dominant effect on the antimicrobial activity of chamomile oils.\nAntimicrobial substances can be regarded as bactericidal or fungicidal if the MBC/MIC or MFC/MIC ratios are lower than or equal to 4. If the MBC/MIC or MFC/MIC ratios are higher than 4, antimicrobial substances are usually regarded as bacteriostatic or fungistatic (EUCAST 2003). Based on the presented results, it can be concluded that chamomile oils showed bactericidal (MBC/MIC = 1\u20134) and fungicidal effects (MFC/MIC = 1\u20134) for most of the tested microorganisms. The bacteriostatic effect of oils was noted against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus (MBC/MIC = 4\u2013250)."

            "text": "The results of cytotoxicity testing for chamomile oils obtained by SFE are presented in Table\u00a04. It can be seen that overall, the highest toxicity was observed for FrE I\u00a0+ Et, with CC50 of 439.91, 331.96, and 511.32\u00a0\u00b5g/mL against VERO, FaDu, and RKO, respectively. Interestingly, antineoplastic activity of FrE I + Et against hypopharyngeal cancer was observed with SI of 1.33. The sample Fr I + Et showed a similar anticancer selectivity towards FaDu. Other chamomile oils showed higher toxicity on normal cells than cancer ones.\nAnalysis of the dose\u2013response influence on cell lines, shown in Fig.\u00a0 4, indicates nontoxic effect (viability\nof above 90%) of chamomile oils at a concentration of 125\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for Fr I, Fr I + Et, and FrE I + Et, whereas for Fr II, Fr II + Et, and FrE II + Et samples, the nontoxic effect was noticed at 250\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Based on the criteria of cytotoxicity classification (\u0141aska et\u00a0al., 2019), it can be concluded that chamomile oils were not cytotoxic to the tested cell lines (CC50 > 500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). A slight deviation\nfrom this conclusion was noticed for the Fr I and FrE I + Et samples that showed weak toxicity on VERO cells due to CC50 values in the range 201 \u2212 500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (\u0141aska et\u00a0al., 2019). Also, the samples FrE I + Et and Fr I + Et showed weak toxicity towards FaDu. Similarly, Catani et\u00a0al. (2021) reported that ethanolic chamomile extracts did not exhibit an effect on viability of normal colon cell (Caco2 cells) at\n1 3\na low concentration (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), while cytotoxic effects were observed with the higher extract concentrations (i.e., 300\u00a0\u03bcg/mL led to 30% inhibition and 500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL reduced viability by about 70%). In addition, it was previously reported that extracts from chamomile flowers obtained using methanol show a potential to be used in anticancer treatments (Al-Dabbagh et\u00a0al., 2019; Sak et\u00a0al., 2017). For instance, these extracts significantly inhibited the level of prerequisite angiogenesis markers both in HepG2 cells and ex\u00a0vivo (Al-Dabbagh et\u00a0al., 2019) and showed the\ncytotoxic activity on melanoma cells (IC50 40.7\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) twofold higher than on epidermoid carcinoma cells (IC50 71.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) (Sak et\u00a0al., 2017).\nThe results obtained in this study on composition and bioactivity of oils obtained from chamomile seeds suggest the possibility of its use as a functional food. According to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 on novel foods, products that are considered \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d in composition, nutritional value, and levels of undesirable substances, to an existing food that is already marketed within the EU,\n1 3\nhave a simplified procedure for marketing (Lyashenko et\u00a0al., 2019). This implies that chamomile seed oils could reach a rapid presence in the market."

            "text": "The current study demonstrated a novel strategy for separating functional oils from chamomile seeds. Variation in the extraction process parameters (operating pressure, temperature, milled seed particle size, and addition of co-solvent) enabled an increase in the amount of separated oil (2.4 to 18.6%) and variation in the oil chemistry. Unsaturated fatty acid content ranged from 80.3 to 88.7%, with linoleic acid dominating in amounts ranging from 497.3 to 711.1\u00a0mg/g. The addition of ethanol as a co-solvent to sc-CO2 decreased extraction yield and, on the other hand, increased the TPC and TFC in oils. It was also shown that waste seeds material remained after the SFE process could be re-extracted using sc-CO2 with ethanol. These oils show higher TPC, TFC, and antioxidant activity compared with extracts from native seeds. TPC in separated oil reached 80.4\u00a0mg GAE/g, while TFC reached up to 11.6\u00a0mg QE/g. The obtained chamomile oils showed antioxidant activity with IC50 up to 3.9\u00a0mg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of oils was the most pronounced against Gram-positive bacteria with MIC in the range from 0.02 to 10\u00a0mg/mL. Chamomile oils were not cytotoxic on normal cells. Based on the presented results it can be concluded that oils obtained from chamomile seeds using an environmentally friendly technique are bioactive and have significant potential to be used as functional foods.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11947- 023- 03038-9.\nAcknowledgements Stoja Milovanovic acknowledges the scholarship from the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA, Warsaw, Poland) (Ulam Programme 2020, the agreement number is PPN/ULM/2020/1/00023/U/00001).
