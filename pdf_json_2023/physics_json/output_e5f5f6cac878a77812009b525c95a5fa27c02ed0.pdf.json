            "text": "The role of ionic processes occurring in the atmosphere is still a challenging and controversial topic because of their potential effect on the formation and depletion of many chemical species relevant to climate models.1 Despite the fundamental role of neutrals in many chemical processes, ion\u2013molecule reactions2 are also important because these reactions destroy or produce species through faster reactions. In the troposphere and stratosphere ions are formed by Cosmic rays\u2019 energetic subatomic particles that enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere from space.3 The ionization rate due to cosmic rays is at its maximum value of about 20\u201340 cm 3 s 1 in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere layer (as shown for instance in Fig. 1 of ref. 3). Ionization of gaseous air molecules, mainly N2 and O2, produces primary ions which afterwards react with other atmospheric molecules. Moreover, secondary particles such as protons, electrons and muons, lose their energy ionizing species as they propagate downwards. Svensmark4 has studied for many years the connection between cosmic rays, clouds, and climate. These studies are based on the observation that when there is a change in solar activity and hence in the flux of cosmic rays there is a change in climate because cosmic rays influence cloud formations which affects Earth\u2019s temperature. Indeed, cosmic rays can produce ions that stabilize and favor aerosol formation which leads to clouds. CLOUD Project Experiments performed in Ginevra at CERN from 2006 were also prepared to understand the influence of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on aerosols and clouds, and their implications for climate.5 They want to find out which trace gases and ions are involved in aerosol particle formation. However, this topic, due to its complex nature, remains the object of controversial studies based on laboratory measurements and on satellite data analysis.6 In the atmosphere, composed of a mixture of gases, the main components are N2 and O2 but also trace gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, water, nitrous oxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide are relevant in the atmospheric chemical networks. These gases are present in very little amount but cannot be neglected. They are emitted in the atmosphere by natural or anthropogenic sources and could have a key role in a Istituto di Struttura della Materia - CNR (ISM-CNR), Area della Ricerca di Roma 2, Via del Fosso del Cavaliere 100, 00133, Rome, Italy b Istituto di Struttura della Materia - CNR (ISM-CNR), Area della Ricerca di Roma 1, Monterotondo Scalo 00015, Italy c Department of Physics, Sapienza University of Rome, P. le Aldo Moro 5, Rome, 00185, Italy d Institute for the Study of Nanostructured Materials-CNR (ISMN-CNR), Department of Chemistry, Sapienza University of Rome, P. le Aldo Moro 5, Rome, 00185, Italy.

Chlorofluorocarbon molecules are a classic example of such trace gases. They interact with sun light and produce chlorine radicals that catalytically destroy the ozone molecules.7 One of the main cation present in the upper atmosphere is hydronium ion, the seed of water organic cluster whose climate effects are debated.8 The formation of H3O\n+ should be considered especially in regions of the atmosphere, as upper troposphere9 where water and trace gases are present and secondary subatomic particles can trigger ionization. Indeed, the atmosphere is a complex system subject to sudden and heterogeneous spatial and temporal changes in its chemistry and dynamics. For instance, recently, a large amount of water vapor has been injected into the stratosphere by the eruption of the submarine volcano Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u2019apai that has increased the amount of global stratospheric water vapor by more than 5\u201310%.10,11 This rare event can affect the chemistry of the stratosphere for several years and it should be considered, given that water vapor is the most abundant trace gas able to influence the climate by absorption and emission of infrared radiant energy.12,13 Volcanic eruptions also eject other trace gases, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide that could have a role in alternative chemical networks active in this modified atmosphere.\nIn this scenario, the present manuscript focuses on an experimental and theoretical study of the ion chemistry of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide radical cation with water. These molecules, as observed in the reaction of sulfur dioxide radical cation with water,14\u201316 can catalyze a fast production of hydronium ions and hydroxyl radical OH, the main oxidant present in the atmosphere."

The beamline already described in previous works,17\u201319 is equipped with a Normal Incidence Monochromator (NIM) and an electromagnetic elliptical undulator/wiggler providing monochromatized radiation photons in the 8\u201340 eV energy range. In these experiments, the aluminium grating of the NIM, operating in the energy range 8\u201318 eV has been used, with an energy resolution of about 20 meV. The photon energy was calibrated against the autoionization features observed in the Ar total photoionization cross-section between the 3p spin orbit components.20 Carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide was introduced in the ion source through a leak valve and the molecules were ionized by synchrotron radiation at a pressure of about 10 6\u201310 5 mbar. The CO2 + or N2O + were then guided into the octupole reaction cell with several optical lenses at the nominal collision energy (CE) of 0 eV with an energy spread of about 100\u2013150 meV. Water was introduced\ninto the reaction cell (octupole) at room temperature and at different nominal pressures. The photoionization efficiencies curve (PIEC) of both N2O and CO2 were acquired by scanning the photon energy from their ionization energies to about 17 eV with a step of 0.02 eV and an acquisition time of 15 seconds per point. The PIEC of NO+ from N2O\n+ is also reported and acquired in the 14.0\u201318.0 eV photon energy range with a 0.02 eV step and an acquisition time of 10 seconds per point. Mass spectra were acquired at the photon energies of 13.5 (N2O) and 14.0 (CO2) eV before and after the introduction of water in the reaction cell and in the mass over charge (m/z) range 10\u201350. The measurements have been performed at different water pressures in the 10 6\u201310 5 mbar range and with acquisition time ranging from 1 to 5 seconds per point. Both reactions produce protonated molecules CO2H + (m/z = 45), N2OH + (m/z = 45) and H2O + (m/z = 18) with a tiny signal at m/z = 19 due to hydronium ion H3O\n+ that become the most intense peak at high pressures. The intensities of the reagent and product ions were then acquired by scanning the photon energy in the range of 13.8\u2013 15.0 eV and 12.9\u201313.7 eV for CO2 and N2O respectively, with a step of 0.10 eV and an acquisition time of 30 seconds per point. The pressure measurements are affected by an error of about 30%. For the sake of clarity, the in radicals and radical cation is omitted in the following sections. Linearity of the product/reagent ratio with the pressure has been verified at different photon energies up to about 8.0 10 5 mbar.\nMaterials. All the samples were used at room temperature.

Therefore, the bottleneck of the reaction is the formation of the molecular adducts as controlled by capture theory.22 Hence, the Minimum Energy Path (MEP) relevant for calculating the branching ratio of the HT vs. CT channels is the one that connects the molecular adduct with the products of the charge and hydrogen transfer reactions.\nIn particular the ab initio calculations have employed the Density Functional Theory Double-hybrid approach, which is able to describe the radical nature of the species reacting during the charge and hydrogen transfer processes.

The overall rate coefficients for the HT or CT (denoted by HT/CT) reactions are given by: kHT/CT = kLang kHTD/CTD.\nThese two last unimolecular rate coefficients can be written in the adiabatic rotation approximation of the microcanonical transition state theory27 as:\nkHT=CT \u00bc kLang\nr Ecomplex NvOH=X EvOH=X NvHX\u00fe=H2O\u00fe E v HX\u00fe=H2O \u00fe\nQrotOH=X QrotHX\u00fe=H2O\u00fe N tras HT=CT E kin HT=CT\n(3)\nwhere r(Ecomplex) is the density of states of the reactive complex at its Ecomplex energy, N\nv are the number of vibrational states for the products calculated at the vibrational energy Ev, and Qrot are their rotational partition functions at T = 298 K, Ntras are the number of translational states for the relative motion of the products for the two reaction channels HT and CT, with their respective reduced mass mHT/CT:\nNtrasHT=CT E kin HT=CT\n\u00bc 2\n3 p\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2mHT=CT r\nh\n0 BB@\n1 CCA 3\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi EkinHT=CT q 3 \u00fe1\n(4)\nThe kinetic energy is given by three terms:\nEkinHT=CT \u00bc 4kBT\np \u00fe Etrasexp \u00fe EtrasHT=CT (5)\nwhere, the first term is the thermal energy of the reagents, the second term is the experimental collision energy (75 meV) and the third term EtrasHT/CT is the relative kinetic energy produced during the reaction, and it is given by energy conservation with respect to the total reaction energy available:\nEINT hn\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe EHT=CT \u00bc EvOH=H2O\u00fe \u00fe E v HX\u00fe=X \u00fe EtrasHT=CT (6)\nwhere EINT(hn) is the internal energy which remains in the X + ion at the photon energy hn (see the ESI\u2020 Section S1 and Fig. S1 for N2O and Section S3 of the ESI\u2020 of ref. 28 for CO2), and EHT/CT is the reaction energies and Ev is the vibrational energy of the species.\nThe branching ratio (BR) of the HT channels have been analysed to get information on the vibrational\u2013translational energy partition of the products by comparing the experimental and theoretical BR.

The literature experimental rate coefficients k at 300 K are reported in Table 1.21 These data demonstrate that CT, PT and WW reactions are very fast and at the high pressure all products of the first two reactions, XH+ and H2O +, react\ncompletely with water leading to the sink ion H3O +. The thermochemical DH f data from the literature 29 allow for the calculations of the thermochemistry of all reactions in Scheme 1. In the case of CO2 the HT, CT and PT are exothermic by 60.0, 113.0 and 150.1 kJ mol 1 while in the case of N2O they are exothermic by 10.1, 26.9 and 113.9 kJ mol 1. Finally, reaction between H2O + and H2O is exothermic by 97.3 kJ mol 1. It is noteworthy to say that in the HT reaction with X = N2O only the oxygen atom [HONN]+ has been considered as the HT on N [HNNO]+ is endothermic by 15.4 kJ mol 1.\nIn order to check that there are not reaction barriers in the dissociation of the reactive complex, the Minimum Energy Path of the HT and CT reactions, both with carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, have been calculated starting from the structure of the minimum adduct [X H2O]+ (Fig. 2(a) and (b)) at the energies of 208.7 and 136.6 kJ mol 1 for CO2 and N2O, respectively. Once formed, the adduct ions can lead to CT or HT, with CT faster than HT. The reaction coordinate of CT is the distance between the oxygen atoms of water and nitrous oxide [H2O ONN]+ and one of the O of CO2 [H2O OCO]+. In the HT reaction, the O\u2013H bond of H2O has been considered as the reaction coordinate. The spin and charge evolution of the two systems along the MEP from the adduct [X H2O]+ ions are reported in Fig. 2(c) and (d). In the CT reaction, the charge and spin are mostly transferred to the water molecule in both adduct ions [H2O X]+. In the case of HT, the spin is entirely on OH while the charge, up to 2 \u00c5,\nFig. 1 (a) Mass spectrum of the reaction between the two reagents CO2 + + H2O acquired at the CE = 0, PH2O = 6.0 10 5 mbar and photon energy of 14.0 eV.

Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide have different ionization energies being (X2Pg) 13.777 0.001 eV and (X2P) 12.889 0.004 eV, respectively.30 Their PIEC, reported in the ESI\u2020 in Fig. S3 and S4, have been acquired together with the PIEC of NO+ (Fig. S5, ESI\u2020), the main fragment of nitrous oxide radical cation. In the case of CO2\nthe ionization efficiency is quite low at about 15.0 eV and no fragments have been observed up to this energy,21,31 and it is known that the first excited state A2Pu is at 17.331 eV. 32 As regard N2O, the picture is more complex since several autoionizing resonances between the ground X2P and the first excited state A2S+ (16.38 eV)33 of N2O\n+ start appearing at 13.9 eV. At about 14.77 eV the appearance of NO+ is observed (Fig. S5, ESI\u2020) due to the dissociation of excited N2O* which autoionizes into N2O +(X2P) and predissociates.34\nFor the above discussed reasons the reaction involving CO2 + + H2O and N2O + + H2O have been studied in the photon energy range from 13.8 to 15.0 eV and 12.9 to 13.7 eV, respectively, to investigate the effect of the photon energy on the reactivity without the presence of fragments, resonances or electronic excited states.\nTable 1 Literature experimental29 and theoretical (in bold) DH r (kJ mol 1) for the reactions in Scheme 1.

These measurements do not directly provide the experimental rate coefficients k of processes HT and CT as a function of hv as well as the internal energy of the ions acquired during the interaction with photons. Nevertheless, these important quantities can be derived by the experimental mass intensities recorded as a function of photoionization energy (Fig. 3(a) and (b)) together with the experimental photoionization spectra (Fig. S3 and S4 shown in ESI\u2020). These data allow the development of an appropriate kinetic model, described in detail in the ESI\u2020 (Section S2).\nThe experimental rate coefficients kHT and kCT as a function of photon energy derived for CO2 + + H2O and N2O + + H2O reactions are shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively. In both HT reactions, the derived experimental rate coefficients seem to be not influenced by hv in the explored photon energy range. This is also true for the CT in N2O\n+ + H2O, but the picture is more complex in the case of the reaction of water with carbon dioxide where a sinusoidal trend for kCT vs. hv is derived. In this case the rate coefficient increases from the threshold up to 14.0 eV, then goes down up to 14.6 eV and finally grows again up to 15.0 eV. These evidences suggest that the well-known complex vibronic structure of the ionic ground CO2 +(X2Pg) state in the energy range 13.8\u201314.7 eV could affect\nthe CT reactivity.35 Probably the HT is also influenced by the manifold vibronic band structures of CO2\n+, but errors do not allow highlighting this effect. Nevertheless, although our measurements are not state-selective for a specific vibrational level of the reagent ions, in the case of CO2\n+ is quite evident that vibrations in the ground state are involved in the photoionization process and affect its reactivity. Early studies,36\u201338 have already shown that the vibrational excitation of CO2\n+ has different effect, such as increasing the rate coefficient of CT with O2 and NO, while it decreases the rate coefficient in the HT with H2.\nThe vibrational content of the products (Evib) at the different photon energies, together with their relative kinetic energy (Etras) have been also evaluated following the procedure described in Section 2.2.2, and discussed in the following next Sections 3.1 and 3.2."

            "text": "+ with H2O The CT and HT reactions of water with N2O + as a function of the photoionization energies reveal a different scenario in the energy partition of the products at variance with the CO2 reactions. In Fig. 6(c) and (d) the energy distributions of the products in the two channels HT and CT, respectively, are reported. The data reveal that in this case the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the products plays a major role in the HT reaction (Fig. 6(c)). Here the N2OH\n+ is vibrationally excited only in its NNO in plane bending mode (see Tables S3 and S6, ESI\u2020), while all the other frequency modes are spectator during the reactions. The relative kinetic energies here are within a range of 1706\u20132501 cm 1. The CT channel shows a very different trend in water cation vibrational excitation compared to the CO2 reaction. Here there is no involvement of the frequency modes of H2O\n+ during the charge transfer process. The neutral N2O molecule is vibrationally excited in a range between 1797 and 2495 cm 1, whereas the relative kinetic energies vary between 1048 and 1990 cm 1 (see Table S7, ESI\u2020).\nIn conclusion, the products energy distribution analysis shows that in the CT reactions of CO2 + and N2O + with water, vibrationally hot neutrals CO2 and N2O products are formed. Considering the relevance of these molecules in the atmospheric environments, hereafter their relaxation mechanisms will be discussed and the radiative and collision quenching will be considered.\nThe calculated vibrational energies of CO2 and N2O (Tables S5 and S7, ESI\u2020) at the photon energies investigated have been used to evaluate their vibrational radiative power and lifetime by using the high-temperature molecular spectroscopic database HITEMP (Section S3 in the ESI\u2020).39 The vibrational radiative emission has been found to have radiation lifetimes higher than one second (see Tables S8 and S9 of ESI\u2020). On the other hand, the vibrational\u2013translational relaxation due to collisions with surrounding atmospheric molecules has lifetimes of the order ms40\u201342 at the upper tropospheric/stratospheric pressures of about 0.1 atm.43 Hence, the dominant quenching mechanism in this atmospheric environment is not radiative emission, but the collision of hot CO2 and N2O with the surrounding molecules. This relaxation mechanism is essentially similar to the energy transfer which CO2 undergoes after earth\u2019s IR excitation, and it points to the role of cosmic rays as not only effective in global climate cooling by triggering the formation of clouds, but also as a warming agent.6 On the other hand, the vibrational radiative emission mechanism becomes competitive with the collisional relaxation process only at lower pressures such those occurring in the outer space such as exosphere and the interstellar medium (P r 10 7 atm).44\nThe results of this work are important for the role, sometime controversial and not yet well understood, of all these molecules on climate models, as for instance when they are injected into the stratosphere by volcanoes. Recently, the submarine volcano Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u2019apai eruption has increased the amount of global stratospheric water vapor by ca. 10%.11 During the volcanic eruption a large amount of gases are\nFig. 6 Energy content of the products formed in the reaction involving CO2 + + H2O in HT (a) and CT channels (b).

Indeed, these molecules, which are greenhouse gases, can alter, among the others, the ozone layer, the stratospheric sulfate aerosol dynamic, cloud formation and in general the atmospheric chemistry.45\u201347 More specifically the H3O\n+ and OH species studied in the chemical network of the present work, have a relevant involvement in the atmospheric chemistry. Protonated mixed water organic clusters are among the most abundant cations in the stratosphere,48,49 and alter the Earth\u2019s radiative balance due to IR absortption.8 Hydroxyl radical OH is the key oxidant in the atmosphere50 and affect the oxidation of methane, the budget of ozone and the sulfate aerosol formation by reacting with SO2 thus with a potential climate effect.51,52 OH, primary formed by the reaction of O(1D) with H2O triggered by sunlight dissociation of O3 in O(\n1D) and O2, can also be formed by secondary processes. These processes are operative also during nighttime started either by neutral chemicals, mainly in the troposphere,50 or by ions, such as SO2 + CO2 + and N2O\n+ produced by cosmic rays. These ions can increase the rate coefficients of the reactions of several orders of magnitude53 with respect to the relative neutral reaction, resulting in a fast formation of reactive OH radicals and \u2018\u2018hot\u2019\u2019 CO2 and N2O that can relax losing their vibrational energy by collisions."
