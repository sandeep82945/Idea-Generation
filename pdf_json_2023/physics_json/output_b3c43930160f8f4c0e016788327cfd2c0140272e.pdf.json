    "abstractText": "Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are emerging as an important therapeutic target for patients with advanced, refractory cancers. Most selective FGFR inhibitors under investigation show reversible binding, and their activity is limited by acquired drug resistance. This review summarizes the preclinical and clinical development of futibatinib, an irreversible FGFR1-4 inhibitor. Futibatinib stands out among FGFR inhibitors because of its covalent binding mechanism and low susceptibility to acquired resistance. Preclinical data indicated robust activity of futibatinib against acquired resistance mutations in the FGFR kinase domain. In early-phase studies, futibatinib showed activity in cholangiocarcinoma, and gastric, urothelial, breast, central nervous system, and head and neck cancers harboring various FGFR aberrations. Exploratory analyses indicated clinical benefit with futibatinib after prior FGFR inhibitor use. In a pivotal phase II trial, futibatinib demonstrated durable objective responses (42% objective response rate) and tolerability in previously treated patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements. A manageable safety profile was observed across studies, and patient quality of life was maintained with futibatinib treatment in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Hyperphosphatemia, the most common adverse event with futibatinib, was well managed and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. These data show clinically meaningful benefit with futibatinib in FGFR2-rearrangement-positive cholangiocarcinoma and provide support for further investigation of futibatinib across other indications. Future directions for this agent include elucidating mechanisms of resistance and exploration of combination therapy approaches.",

            "text": "FGFR inhibitors mostly target the FGFR kinase domain, inhibiting FGFR signaling. Although several therapeutic modalities are being investigated for FGFR inhibition (reviewed elsewhere39), small-molecule FGFR inhibitors remain the most widely investigated. These inhibitors vary in their selectivity (specific to FGFR or multikinase) and mode of binding to the FGFR kinase domain (type I, type II, reversible, or irreversible).40 Reversible ATP-competitive FGFR inhibitors currently under investigation, including derazantinib, erdafitinib, pemigatinib, and infigratinib (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1), engage primarily in noncovalent interactions with amino acids in the hinge and surrounding regions of the ATP-binding pocket in the FGFR kinase domain. Irreversible inhibitors, such as PRN1371, futibatinib, and fisogatinib, form a covalent bond, generally with a conserved cysteine in the FGFR kinase domain.40,54\nSelective FGFR inhibitors have shown promising activity in various FGFR-aberrant cancer types. To date, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved erdafitinib\nin patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma harboring FGFR2/3 aberrations who were previously treated,55 and pemigatinib and infigratinib for second- or later-line treatment of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements.49,55 An emerging concern with these inhibitors is acquired resistance, which leads to disease progression.9,56,57 One mechanism of acquired resistance is the development of secondary \u201cgatekeeper\u201d mutations in the FGFR kinase domain that \u201cblock\u201d FGFR inhibitor binding through steric hindrance.9,39,56,58 Reversible inhibitors, such as erdafitinib, infigratinib, and pemigatinib, are largely ineffective against these mutations.56 Second-generation inhibitors that retain activity against these mutations and have a lower susceptibility to resistance are sorely needed.\nFutibatinib, a Potent, Irreversible FGFR1-4 Inhibitor Futibatinib is a structurally novel, highly selective, and potent FGFR inhibitor,11 which binds covalently and irreversibly to a conserved cysteine residue in the FGFR kinase domain within the ATP-binding pocket54 (Fig. 2). As this cysteine residue is conserved across all FGFR receptors, futibatinib inhibits the kinase activity of all 4 FGFR isoforms. The distinct binding site and irreversible binding render futibatinib less susceptible to drug resistance mutations than reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitors.\nPreclinical Development In vitro characterization of futibatinib against a panel of 296 kinases demonstrated high selectivity and potent inhibition of all 4 FGFR isoforms with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 1.4 nmol/L to 3.7 nmol/L.11 Futibatinib selectively inhibited cancer cell lines of diverse tissue origins\n14%\n0.30%\n9%\n6%\n16%\n5%\n2% 8%\n17%\n9% 12%\n2% 4%\n15%\n7% 70%\n7% 3% 5% 15%\n5%\n9%\n2% 0.30%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nBladder/NMIBC\nBreast\nColorectal\nGastric/gastroesophageal junction\nEsophageal\nSmall-cell lung cancer\nSquamous non-small cell lung cancer\nOvarian\nUrothelial\nGlioblastoma multiform\nEndometrial\nIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma\nMultiple myeloma\nCervical\nProstate\nFGFR1 amplification\nFGFR1 fusion\nFGFR2 amplification\nFGFR2 fusions\nFGFR2 mutations\nFGFR3 amplifications\nFGFR3 fusions\nFGFR3 mutations\nFGFR4 amplification\nFGFR4 mutation\nIncidence across cancer types\nFigure 1.

Additionally, futibatinib treatment led to significant dose-dependent tumor reductions and sustained FGFR kinase inhibition in FGFRaberrant human tumor xenograft mice models.\nIn vitro futibatinib treatment of gastric cancer cells was associated with a lower risk of developing drug resistance due to FGFR escape mutations than the reversible FGFR inhibitor AZD4547.11 Futibatinib also demonstrated greater inhibition of secondary FGFR2 kinase domain drug-resistant mutations, including the gatekeeper mutation V565I/L, than AZD4547, infigratinib, pemigatinib, or erdafitinib.11\nIn an unbiased library-based analysis, the activity of futibatinib and other FGFR inhibitors were examined against drug-resistant FGFR2 kinase domain mutations generated by random mutagenesis59 and transfected in a Ba/F3 cell system dependent on FGFR2 signaling for growth. Futibatinib showed the most robust inhibition of drug-resistant FGFR2 kinase domain mutations (also clinically relevant9,56,57,60) as well as the lowest propensity for emergence of resistant clones with prolonged treatment."

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), all related to liver\nenzyme elevations, occurred in 3 patients receiving futibatinib 24 mg QD. No DLTs were observed with TIW dosing. All QD doses tested showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, whereas TIW dosing was associated with saturation between 80 mg and 200 mg TIW. As renal handling of phosphorus is mediated by FGF23 signaling,62 serum phosphorus levels were evaluated as an on-target effect and chosen as a pharmacodynamic marker. While serum phosphorus levels correlated positively with futibatinib dose and exposure for both QD and TIW dosing, this correlation was stronger with QD vs. TIW dosing. Similar data were observed in a phase I doseescalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors from Japan (JapicCTI-142552).63 Based on these data, futibatinib 20 mg QD was selected as the recommended phase II dose.\nFutibatinib showed a manageable safety profile.61 The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were hyperphosphatemia, diarrhea, and constipation. In addition, encouraging preliminary antitumor activity was observed in this heavily pretreated population, particularly in those with intrahepatic CCA (iCCA). Across cohorts, 5 patients (6%) experienced partial responses (PRs) and 48% (n = 41) achieved stable disease (SD). Most patients with PRs or SD had tumors harboring FGF/FGFR aberrations; those with PRs included 3 patients with iCCA, all harboring FGFR2 fusions, and 2 patients with FGFR1-mutant brain tumors. Among patients with CCA, 75% (18/24) experienced a PR or SD.\nFutibatinib pharmacokinetics were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers in multiple open-label, phase I studies.

Coadministration of lansoprazole had no clinically relevant effect on futibatinib pharmacokinetics, indicating that futibatinib can be coadministered with PPIs.64,65\nOther phase I studies in healthy adult volunteers evaluated the involvement of futibatinib in the common drug metabolizing CYP3A pathway.66 DDIs were assessed between futibatinib and midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate), itraconazole (a strong dual inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp), and rifampin (a strong dual inducer of CYP3A and P-gp).65 Multiple doses of futibatinib did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam; therefore, futibatinib is not expected to affect the exposure of concomitant medications metabolized via CYP3A. However, itraconazole coadministration resulted in higher peak plasma concentrations and significant increases in plasma exposure of futibatinib compared with futibatinib alone, and coadministration of rifampin decreased futibatinib exposure. Thus, coadministering futibatinib with strong dual inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A and P-gp should be avoided because of potential significant DDIs."

Median duration of response (DOR) was 5.3 months and 6.9 months, respectively, and disease control rate (DCR) was 72% and 79%, respectively. In patients with FGFR2 fusion/rearrangement\u2013positive iCCA treated with either futibatinib 20 mg or 16 mg QD, the overall ORR was 25.4% (15/59). These data formed the basis for further study of futibatinib in patients with FGFR2-rearrangement\u2013positive iCCA.\nThe pivotal phase II FOENIX-CCA2 study investigated futibatinib in 103 patients with advanced unresectable iCCA harboring FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements after one or more lines of systemic chemotherapy.48 FOENIX-CCA2 surpassed its primary endpoint target with an ORR of 41.7% (43/103; 95% CI, 32.1-51.9), as assessed by independent central review (Fig. 3A). Responses were rapid and durable: median time to response was 2.5 months (range, 0.7- 7.4), median DOR was 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.6-17.0), and 72% (31/43) of responders had responses lasting at least 6 months (Fig. 3B). Objective responses were consistent across subgroups, including patients with poor prognostic factors, such as patients 65 years and older or who were heavily pretreated (\u22653 prior therapies). Preliminary survival data were promising; after a median follow-up of 17.1 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.0 months (95% CI, 6.9- 13.1) and median overall survival (OS) was 21.7 months (Fig.\n3C, 3D). The 1-year OS rate was 72%. Results were similar at extended follow-up (median 25.0 months) with a confirmed ORR of 41.7%, mature median OS of 20.0 months (12-month OS rate, 73%), and median PFS of 8.9 months.68 Based on these data, futibatinib was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for patients with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic FGFR2-fusion/ rearrangement-positive iCCA.69"

In the dose-escalation study, one responder had a history of disease progression on prior infigratinib before receiving futibatinib treatment for 15.6 months.61 In the dose expansion study, 5 of 28 patients with prior FGFR inhibitor therapy (17.9%) experienced objective responses with futibatinib.67 Duration of response ranged from 3.5 months (with response ongoing at data cutoff) to 20.4 months. Of the 5 responders, 3 had FGFR2 fusions, 1 a FGFR2 mutation, and 1 a FGFR2 amplification/rearrangement. An additional 15 patients previously treated with an FGFR inhibitor had stable disease. Of note, mechanisms of acquired resistance to prior FGFR inhibitor therapy were not captured because immediate pretreatment and post-progression biopsies were not required in the study.\nIn a separate analysis, clonal dynamics using cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were evaluated in 4 patients from a single site within the phase I patient population.60 These patients received prior infigratinib or Debio 1347, and each\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /oncolo/article/28/11/928/7216373 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024"

In 3 patients, analysis of ctDNA at progression on the prior FGFR inhibitor indicated the development of acquired resistance mutations: E566A, H683L, K660M, K715R, M538I, N550H, N550K, N550T, and V565F.60 Analyses of ctDNA at the start of futibatinib treatment and upon subsequent progression in all 4 patients suggested that futibatinib had differential activity against individual FGFR2 secondary mutations compared with the prior FGFR inhibitors. The mutation allele frequency of V565F increased upon futibatinib treatment, whereas levels of E566A and N550K were unchanged. These results suggest that the spectrum of acquired resistance mutations varies and may influence choice of therapy. In follow-up experiments, futibatinib retained activity against FGFR2 kinase domain mutations in preclinical iCCA models. The investigators concluded that these preliminary investigations support the clinical utility of futibatinib in patients with acquired resistance to ATP-competitive reversible FGFR inhibitors.\nThese analyses were consistent with preclinical experiments showing superior activity of futibatinib against acquired resistance mutations.11,59 However, data on mechanisms of futibatinib resistance remain limited and further research is needed to understand the role of futibatinib after progression on FGFR inhibitors."

            "text": "In addition to CCA, futibatinib activity has been observed in at least 7 other tumor types harboring 10 different categories of FGFR1-4 aberrations (Table 2). Among 19 patients with urothelial cancer in the phase I expansion study,67 3 patients had PRs (16% ORR), all with FGFR1/3-mutant tumors. The ORR in this urothelial cohort was numerically lower than that in trials of other selective FGFR inhibitors,46,71 possibly because these patients were heavily pretreated: 58% received \u22653 prior regimens, with 42% previously treated with an FGFR inhibitor. Based on these data, a phase II study (NCT04601857) was initiated to study futibatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.72\nFutibatinib showed activity in gastric cancer in 2 phase I studies. In the phase I expansion study, 2 of 9 patients achieved a PR (ORR 22%).67 One responder had an FGFR2 amplification and the other had an FGFR3 fusion. In the Japanese phase I dose-expansion study, patients with gastric cancer harboring an FGFR2 amplification with a copy number \u226510 experienced an ORR of 36.4% and DCR of 54.5% vs. 0% and 10% in those with FGFR2 amplification copy number <10.63\nResponses to futibatinib were also observed in primary central nervous system (CNS), breast, and head and neck tumors (Table 2).67 In the phase I dose-escalation study, 2 patients\nwith primary CNS tumors (glioblastoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma) harboring FGFR1 mutations experienced PRs,61 while in the phase I expansion study, 1 patient with glioblastoma harboring an FGFR1 fusion experienced a PR. A patient with triple-negative breast cancer with FGFR2 amplification from the phase I expansion study (16-mg cohort) and another with FGFR2-amplified breast cancer from the phase I study in Japan experienced durable responses with futibatinib.63,67 In a compassionate use program, a patient with an FGFR1-rearranged myeloid neoplasm treated with futibatinib had complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission.70 Notably, these phase I trials helped to identify previously uncharacterized FGFR aberrations and tumor types as potential FGFR inhibitor targets, including FGF-amplified and FGFR1-mutated urothelial carcinoma and FGFR-fusion positive head and neck cancer.\nAltogether, these data support further investigation of futibatinib in multiple FGFR-aberrant tumor types and as a disease-agnostic treatment for patients with FGFR-altered advanced solid tumors."

In the phase I expansion and phase II iCCA studies, any-cause grade \u22653 AEs were reported in 72% and 77% of patients, respectively; grade \u22653 treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 43% and 57% of patients, respectively, with grade 3 hyperphosphatemia most commonly reported in \u226510% of patients (phase I expansion, 22%; phase II, 30%). One grade 4 TRAE was reported in each study (increased gamma glutamyl-transferase and increased alanine aminotransferase). Serious TRAEs were reported in 6% and 10% of patients in the phase I expansion and phase II iCCA studies, respectively; no treatment-related deaths occurred in either study.\nThe most common AE across studies was hyperphosphatemia (Table 3)48,59,63,67 similar to findings with pemigatinib and infigratinib.49,51,74 Hyperphosphatemia is an on-target effect of FGFR inhibition because decreased FGF23\u2013FGFR1 signaling leads to increased phosphate reabsorption and hyperphosphatemia in proximal tubules.62 The numerically higher rates of hyperphosphatemia reported with futibatinib vs. pemigatinib and infigratinib49,51,74 may be related to betweenstudy differences in dosing schedules, safety assessments, and grade definitions.

In the futibatinib studies, hyperphosphatemia was graded by serum phosphate levels regardless of symptoms,48,67 which was not the case for the pemigatinib trial.49,51,74 In the 2 futibatinib studies, hyperphosphatemia was managed with phosphate binders (75%-78%), dose interruptions (17%- 20%), or dose reductions (8%-20%). All grade 3-4 events of hyperphosphatemia resolved, except in 2 patients in the phase I expansion study in whom resolution could not be assessed as they discontinued the study because of disease progression and withdrawal of consent.\nEye and nail toxicities are also considered AEs of special interest for FGFR inhibitors.48,49 Similar to agents targeting the MAPK pathway, FGFR inhibitors can cause central serous retinopathy (CSR)/retinal pigment epithelial dystrophy (RPED). Patients with CSR/RPED can be asymptomatic; however, more severe cases manifest with acute central vision decrease/loss and metamorphopsia.75 In the phase I expansion study, 26% of patients had eye-related AEs, most commonly dry eye (9%), and blurred vision (6%). All but 2 cases (grade 3 cataract [treatment-related]; grade 3 macular fibrosis/grade 4 ocular ischemic syndrome [unrelated]) were grade 1-2. Seven patients experienced grade 1-2 central serous retinopathy.67 In the phase II iCCA study, retinal disorders were reported in 8% of patients (grade 1-2 events).48 In the phase I expansion study, 20% of patients had nail toxicities, all but one (grade 3 onychalgia) grade 1 or 2. In the phase II study, 47% of patients developed nail toxicities (including nail disorder, onycholysis, nail discoloration, and paronychia), with grade 3 cases in 2%.48 Similar data on eye and nail-related toxicities have been reported with other FGFR inhibitors.76,77\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, clinically notable in patients treated with FGFR inhibitors, was reported in 13% (grade \u22653, 4%) and 21% (grade \u22653, 5%) of patients in the phase I expansion and phase II studies, respectively. No grade 5 AEs of special interest were reported in either study.\nAEs were mostly managed with dosing interruption and reductions. In the phase I expansion study, TRAEs led to dosing modifications in 44% of patients and treatment discontinuation in 4% of patients. In the phase II study, TRAEs led to dose interruption, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation in 50%, 54%, and 2% of patients, respectively.\nAn integrated analysis of futibatinib safety in 318 patients across the global phase I/II and Japanese phase I studies showed a consistent safety profile: grade \u22653 hyperphosphatemia occurred in 23% of patients, but nearly all grade \u22653 events resolved and only 3% discontinued because of TRAEs.78\nCollectively, these results indicate a monitorable and manageable safety profile for futibatinib, rarely requiring treatment discontinuation due to AEs."

Individual symptom measures on the EORTC QLQ-C30 were also stable except for constipation, which met criteria for a clinically meaningful change at cycle 4 only. Mean EQ-VAS scores were sustained and the status across all EQ-5D-3L dimensions remained the same or improved over this period. Most patients (82%-95%) maintained the same or better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score relative to baseline. Overall, these data suggest patient QoL was not negatively impacted by AEs while on futibatinib treatment."

            "text": "Based on phase I data, phase II studies are examining the safety and activity of futibatinib in various FGFR-aberrant cancer types including metastatic breast cancer and urothelial cancer (Table 4). A tumor-agnostic phase II study will investigate futibatinib as a disease-agnostic treatment option for patients with FGFR-rearranged advanced solid tumors. Building on the phase II iCCA study results, an ongoing open-label, randomized phase III study will assess futibatinib as a first-line treatment vs. gemcitabine\u2013cisplatin for patients with FGFR2 fusion/rearrangement-positive iCCA.\nFutibatinib combination studies are another important future prospect. The combination of FGFR inhibitors with immunotherapy is supported by preclinical evidence,80 and phase II trials are evaluating futibatinib combined with pembrolizumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (NCT04601857) and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT04828486). In preclinical models, futibatinib combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy, MEK inhibitors, or PI3K pathway inhibitors induced synergistic tumor regression81-83; trials evaluating the combination of futibatinib with AKT and MEK inhibitors are ongoing (JapicCTI-194864; NCT04965818). There is also rationale for the combination of FGFR inhibitors with VEGF inhibitors.84 Future exploration of futibatinib combined with other treatments could yield additional clinical benefits, particularly to combat tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance."

            "text": "FGFR dysregulation drives oncogenesis across a broad range of tumor types. Although many FGFR inhibitors are currently in clinical development, futibatinib has a unique mechanism of action as an irreversible FGFR1-4 inhibitor with potential activity against acquired secondary FGFR kinase domain mutations. In early studies, futibatinib demonstrated activity in diverse tumor types harboring various FGFR aberrations. Based on durable responses and manageable safety in the phase II FOENIX-CCA2 study futibatinib was approved for patients with iCCA harboring FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements. These data, combined with the unique irreversible mechanism of action, set futibatinib apart as a leading second-generation FGFR inhibitor, while both preclinical evidence and exploratory clinical results suggest a role for futibatinib after failure of prior FGFR inhibitor treatment. Further studies are required to assess mechanisms of futibatinib resistance and combination therapy approaches using this agent."
