Exploration of Deferiprone's Role in Synaptic Plasticity and Connectivity: Given the alterations in synaptic and glutamatergic signaling phosphoproteins in 5-HTT KO mice, future research could investigate how deferiprone influences synaptic plasticity and connectivity. This could involve examining the structural changes in synaptic architecture and density, using techniques like fluorescence microscopy or electron microscopy, to understand how these changes correlate with behavioral outcomes in depression models.

Investigating the Combinatorial Effects of Deferiprone with Other Antidepressants: Since deferiprone shows antidepressant-like properties by affecting glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling, a promising area of research could be its combinatory effects with established antidepressants or fast-acting treatments like ketamine. This research could aim to evaluate whether deferiprone enhances the efficacy of these treatments, potentially leading to faster or more robust antidepressant effects.

Long-term Effects of Deferiprone Treatment on the Phosphoproteome: The current study focused on acute treatment effects. Therefore, studying the long-term effects of deferiprone on the phosphoproteome and behavior in both WT and 5-HTT KO mice could provide deeper insights into its antidepressant-like properties and molecular mechanisms over time. This research could help in understanding how chronic deferiprone treatment affects neuronal circuits involved in depression.

Role of Deferiprone in Other Brain Regions Implicated in Depression: Given the focus on the prefrontal cortex, exploring how deferiprone affects the phosphoproteome and global proteome in other brain regions implicated in depression, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, would be valuable. This could help identify region-specific effects and further elucidate the neural circuits involved in its antidepressant-like action.

Mechanistic Studies on Deferiprone's Iron-Independent Actions: The study suggests deferiprone acts in an iron-independent manner to exert its effects. Investigating the molecular mechanisms behind this iron-independent action could uncover new therapeutic targets for depression. This research could involve exploring deferiprone's interaction with specific kinases, phosphatases, or other proteins not directly involved in iron metabolism but crucial for its antidepressant-like effects.
