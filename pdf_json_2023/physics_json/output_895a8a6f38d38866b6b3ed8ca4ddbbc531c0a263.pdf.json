    "abstractText": "Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) encounter the challenge of balancing high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Ionic liquids, which are among the contenders to be used in high-performance supercapacitors, have difficulty infiltrating commercial polyolefin separators for combined applications. In this study, a novel SPE involving uniform infiltration in the micropores of commercial polyolefin separators with polyethylene oxide (PEO), lithium salt, and different proportions of added ionic liquid was developed. The composite membranes combining ionic liquid-filled SPE with polypropylene (PP) microporous separators simultaneously achieve excellent mechanical strength and high-ionic conductivity. The low wettability of pure ionic liquids and commercial polyolefin-based separators is addressed. The 70 wt% IL-filled solid electrolyte composite membrane (PLI(70)@PP) exhibits a high ionic conductivity (2.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 S cm\u22121), low resistance at the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface and excellent mechanical strength (128 MPa) at 25 \u00b0C. The all-solid-state supercapacitor using PLI(70)@PP exhibits a specific capacitance of 158 F g\u22121 at 0.1 A g\u22121 and stable cycle performance. The proposed method can be performed via high-volume roll-to-roll processing to obtain high-performance all-solid-state supercapacitors (ASSCs) for engineering applications.",

All-solid-state supercapacitors (ASSCs) are novel energy storage devices that feature fast charge\u2013discharge capability and excellent cycle performance. They have garnered considerable attention in recent years. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are integral components of ASSCs. Unlike traditional liquid electrolytes, SPEs do not pose risks such as ammability, leakage, toxicity, and corrosivity.1\u20133 However, the need for highionic conductivity and excellent mechanical properties makes SPEs a relevant research subject in the industrial application of ASSCs.4\u20138\nPolyethylene oxide (PEO) is a commonly used material in SPEs owing to its low weight, excellent exibility, and good interfacial compatibility.

Thus, scholars have focused on improving the performance of PEObased SPEs by modifying using inorganic nanoparticles and salts. These modications have advantages and disadvantages. Inorganic nanoparticles have the potential to enhance both the activity of polymeric chains and ionic conductivity of electrolytes. Nevertheless, their incorporation reduces the mechanical strength of the polymer.10\u201312 By contrast, salts can improve the mechanical strength and interfacial stability of electrodes;13\u201317 however, ensuring uniform salt dispersion could be considered aer commercialization.18\u201322 Other techniques, such as electrostatic spinning,23 hydrogel aerogel,24 hydrogel,25 threedimensional printing,26 and templates,27 have been reported to enhance the ionic conductivity of SPEs. Regardless of the method of modication, a primary objective is to simplify the preparation process, which contributes to the further scaling-up and application of solid-state electrolytes.\nThe separation and insulation properties of conventional SPE membranes fail when temperatures exceed the crystallization melting temperature of the membranes. Equipment without mechanical separators require strict temperature limits, and accidental overheating is a serious safety concern when evaluating equipment performance.3 This study investigates the reinforcement of commercial separators to achieve stability even at high temperatures.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

These substances demonstrate remarkable stability both chemically and electrochemically, possess negligible vapor pressure, and exhibit high ionic conductivity. Furthermore, ionic liquids are non-inammable. However, microporous separators typically used in commercial energy storage devices are polyolen-based materials, such as polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE). The existing commercial polyolen separators are unsuitable for ionic liquids owing to their hydrophobicity, poor inltration, and low wettability.31\u201334\nIn this study, we developed a composite SPE (recorded as PLI(X)@PP) by using a commercial PP separator as the internal reinforcement skeleton of the SPE. The porous PP separator is permeated and encapsulated by the PEO-based SPE (recorded as PLI(X)) in the composite electrolyte, which improves mechanical strength and thermal stability, and the PEO matrix is used as a carrier for adsorbed ions, which solves the low compatibility of commercial polyolen membranes' with ionic liquids. Ionic liquids establish pathways resembling ion channels via strong bonding interactions with the polymer chains of PEO,35 thereby enhancing the ion conductivity of PLI(X)@PP. The ionic conductivity is increased to full the actual application requirements by changing the ionic liquid content in the PLI(X). The so PLI(X) on the surface of PP increases the contact area with the electrode and aids in lowering the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface resistance. The electrical performance of the assembled supercapacitor is excellent. This work presents the development of a simple, low-energy PLI(X)@PP, which has the potential to employ large-scale roll-to-roll production."

This method is distinct from the conventional dispersed mixing of polymers and inorganic nanoparticles. The PEO matrix of the developed PLI(X)@PP membrane provided a channel for ions in separator pores. Additionally, the PP separators served as a structural backbone to provide strength. These two characteristics addressed the problems of incompatibility between IL and PP (Fig. S1\u2020), as well as the poor mechanical strength of the PEO matrix. The proposed preparation method also enables the\n34654 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34652\u201334659\napplication of a roll-to-roll process and product-scale production, making it suitable for numerous potential applications.\nOptical photographs of membranes with different proportions of IL show that the membrane transparency gradually increased with the addition of the IL (Fig. 2a). This phenomenon was caused by the photorefraction as the light penetrated the micropores, suggesting that more IL was present in the PP separators.\nSEM imaging revealed micron-sized pores on the surfaces of the PP separators (Fig. 2b); these pores facilitated the PLI(X) solution penetration. Additionally, the smooth surfaces of PP separators indicated that PLI(X) was also uniformly coated on the surface of PP (Fig. 2c\u2013i). Moreover, the membrane surface exhibited a folded morphology as IL increased in the PLI(X); this change was caused by the capillary force aer PLI(X) penetrated the PP micropores.40\nThe PP separator in the PLI(40)@PP cross-section was approximately 16 mm thick; so PLI(X) electrolyte layers (II and IV) on both surfaces of the separator with a thickness of approximately 5 mm (Fig. 2j) were observed.

The element distributions inside the separator were slightly sparser because the PLI(X) electrolyte only inltrated the separator pores (Fig. S3\u2020).\nIn addition, the gradually decreased element sulphur (S) (specic to LiTFSI) in the cross-section (Fig. S2\u2020) indicates that the percentage of LiTFSI decreased. This change was caused by the gradual rise in IL, indirectly explaining the variation in the optical photographs of the PLI(X)@PP membranes described previously.\nAn evaluation of the PLI(X) electrolyte thermal properties revealed a relatively sharp peak of heat absorption at 70.9 \u00b0C for pure PEO (Fig. 3a). The melting peak and peak width shied towards lower temperatures with the addition of LiTFSI and different IL concentrations to the PEO matrix (Table S1\u2020). A lower Tm is expected following the addition of salt to the polymer and has been associated with a decreased spherical crystal size and surface free energy.41,42 The DH of crystallization indicates the melting peak area (proportional to Xc) of the DSC curve. Reductions in Tm and DH with the addition of salt indicate a lower crystallinity and elevation of the amorphous region in PEO.43 Moreover, the segmental motion of the PEOmolecules and ion transport were both enhanced owing to the higher exibility and uidity of amorphous PEO chains.\nAs shown in Fig. 3b, mechanical tensile tests were conducted on the PP, PLI(X)@PP, and PLI(0) membranes. The maximum tensile strength for all three membranes was approximately 128 MPa, and the fracture elongation increased with the IL content. Compared to the PP separator, the fracture strength of the PLI(X)@PP membrane was slightly lower, but it exhibited better toughness. This tendency can be attributed to the inltration of the so PLI electrolyte into the micro-pores of the PP separator, which enhanced the plasticity of the PP separator matrix. Furthermore, the PLI(0) sample without a PP separator as a reference showed a fracture strength of only 1.8 MPa but a fracture elongation as high as 1100%. This result indicates\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthat the presence of the PP separator signicantly improved the strength of the electrolyte membrane.\nIn addition to the mechanical tests, the Nyquist plot of the PLI(X)@PP membranes is illustrated in Fig. 3c. A semicircular characteristic exists in the high-frequency region, and a linear characteristic can be observed in the low-frequency region, indicating a standard double-layer capacitance behaviour. In the region of high frequency, the curve intersects the x-axis at a decreasing rate, and the diameter of the semicircle shis towards the high-frequency area. This observation suggests that a higher IL content is efficient for diminishing the ESR and charge transfer resistance. In the low-frequency region, the linear slope, which represents the rate of charge diffusion, steepens with the increasing IL content, indicating that the charge diffuses faster in electrolytes with high IL content. The Nyquist diagram simulated by the equivalent circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 3d. Rs and Rf represent the ESR and charge transfer resistance, respectively. W1 represents the charge diffusion impedance, and the curve plotted in Fig. 3d shows the trend of decreasing ESR and charge transfer resistance with increasing IL content in PLI(X)@PP. As shown in Fig. 3e, the corresponding ionic conductivities of the PLI(X)@PP membranes are 9.6 \u00d7 10\u22126, 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22125, 5.1 \u00d7 10\u22125, 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124, 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22124, 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123, and 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 S cm\u22121. The positive correlation between the ionic conductivity and IL concentration may have been caused by the increase in the charge carrier density; IL enhances lithium salt dissociation and polymer segmental motion by weakening chain forces.44\u201346 Furthermore, the ionic conductivity of the PLI(X)@PP membranes exhibit a strong temperature dependence (Fig. 3f); the ionic conductivity of the PLI(X)@PP membranes increased as temperatures increased within the range of 25\u201370 \u00b0C. The elevated ion mobility and chain segmentation at 70 \u00b0C resulted in an ionic conductivity of nearly 10\u22122 S cm\u22121 for PLI(70)@PP, which is comparable with the highest reported values.47\nCE/PLI(X)@PP/CEs were assembled using two carbon electrodes and a PLI(X)@PP membrane. We performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests on the assembled CE/PLI(X)@PP/CEs, as shown in Fig. 4a. As the IL content increased, the CV curve area expanded, indicating an increase in the capacitance of the device. Charge\u2013discharge cycles of the CE/PLI(X)@PP/CEs were performed at 25 \u00b0C (Fig. 4b). The area under the galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge (GCD) curves increased with the IL content. This nding indicates that the specic capacitance of CE/\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34652\u201334659 | 34655\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 2\n7 N\nov em\nbe r\n20 23\n.

Moreover, the voltage IR decreased as IL increased, indicating the lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) of this specic ASSC. This characteristic can be attributed to the soer electrolyte layer, which lowered the interface resistance of the electrode, and it is consistent with ionic conductivity results.\nThe CV curves for the CE/PLI(70)@PP/CE were estimated at different scan rates and room temperature (Fig. 5a). At low-scan rates, the CV curves were rectangular; however, deviations from that shape occurred at high scan rates for ideal double-layer capacitors, possibly because of resistance and overpotential.48\nHowever, CV could not fully explain the electrochemical properties of the CE/PLI(70)@PP/CE. Therefore, the GCD measurements were performed at various current densities (Fig. 5b). The charge\u2013discharge curves exhibit triangular linear proles, typical of double-layer capacitors. The results conrm their superior capacitive properties. The charge\u2013discharge curves of the CE/PLI(70)@PP/CE at various current densities reveal that the area under the GCD curves decreased as the current density increased. The specic capacitance of the CE/ PLI(70)@PP/CE increased to 158 F g\u22121 at 0.1 A g\u22121 (Fig. 5c), a value at the higher end of reported values among polymer electrolytes mixed with IL (Table S2\u2020). The CE/PLI(70)@PP/CE demonstrated a high-energy density of 32.1 Wh kg\u22121 and power density of 75.6 W kg\u22121 with a current density of 0.1 A g\u22121; the energy and power densities were low at 13.8 Wh kg\u22121 and 1.06 kW kg\u22121 (Fig. 5c), respectively, with a current density of 1 A g\u22121. The developed membranes exhibit excellent energy and power densities compared with those reported in the literature (Fig. S4\u2020) and outperformed similar supercapacitors in terms of the energy density.49,50 A red light-emitting diode (LED) (2 V) could be lit for a few minutes aer charging the ASSC to 2.5 V (Fig. 5c).\nFig. 5 Electrochemical results for (CE)/PLI(70)@PP/CE: (a) CV curves at different current densities, (b) GCD curves at different current densities, (c) current density plots against specific capacity and energy density against power density, and (d) capacitance retention and coulombic efficiency across 1000 cycles.\n34656 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34652\u201334659\nOne thousand charge\u2013discharge cycles of the CE/PLI(70) @PP/CE were performed at a current density of 1 A g\u22121 (Fig. S5\u2020). The charge\u2013discharge cycle curves of the quasiisosceles triangle yielded a minimal increase in the IR aer 1000 cycles, thus indicating charge transport stability between the electrode and electrolyte interfaces.51 The discharge capacity of the CE/PLI(70)@PP/CE gradually decreased with the number of cycles (Fig. 5d). Its capacity retention aer 1000 cycles reached 90% of the initial capacity. The coulombic efficiency was high (99.37%) over 1000 cycles, demonstrating the excellent cycle stability of the device. By contrast, the capacity retention of the CE/PLI(70)/CE ASSC decreased considerably with cycling, reaching values as low as 60% aer 800 cycles. The difference in the cycle stability of ACCSs was revealed by comparing the semicircular diameter change of the EIS curve before and aer cycling. The CE/PLI(70)@PP/CE exhibited lower Rf and range of variation aer cycling than CE/PLI(70)/CE (Fig. S6a\u2020). Aer CE/ PLI(70)@PP/CE cycling, a slight increase in Rf (semicircular EIS diameter) was associated with a decrease in IL content within PLI(70)@PP (reduced F-element content in the EDS spectrum, Fig. S6b\u2020). The porous PP separator with network structure can hinder the local chain reorganization of the polymer electrolyte owing to its large surface area. This leads to the presence of highly amorphous regions in the polymeric matrix, favouring ionic migration.52 These results indicate that the PP separator provides a more stable support structure and ionic transport channel.\nThermal stability tests were conducted on the PLI(X) and PLI(X)@PP membranes (Fig. S7\u2020). All membranes show dimensional stability at temperatures below 40 \u00b0C. The PLI(70) membrane without the PP separator as the backbone melted into a viscous liquid at 50 \u00b0C, whereas the PLI(70)@PP membrane remained intact even at 70 \u00b0C. Additionally, no IL exudation was observed on the PLI(70)@PP membrane, indicating its stable morphology at high temperatures. This phenomenon suggests that the PP separator functions as a structural backbone, ensuring the morphological stability of the composite membrane at high temperatures, which forms the basis for maintaining stable electrical properties.\nThe mechanical and electrical performance of PLI(70)@PP were characterized at various temperatures (25\u201370 \u00b0C). Fig. 6a presents the mechanical performance of the PLI(70)@PP membrane at different temperatures, exhibiting a decrease in mechanical performance (Fig. S8\u2020) and an increase in elongation at higher temperatures. This nding can be attributed to the elevated temperatures causing increased movement of the PP molecular chains, which dominates the mechanical performance.\nFurthermore, concerning the electrical properties, Fig. 6b illustrates the EIS curves at various temperatures. In the highfrequency range, the curves demonstrate a decrease in the intercept with the x-axis, whereas the slope increases in the lowfrequency range. This characteristic suggests that higher temperatures can reduce the equivalent series resistance and charge transfer resistance of the device, potentially owing to enhanced interface compatibility between the electrode and electrolyte as the temperature increases.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The CE/PLI(70)@PP/CE electrode exhibits an increase in specic capacity during charge\u2013 discharge cycles at higher temperatures, as observed in Fig. 6d. This increase is likely to have resulted from the improved migration of PLI(70) into the AC electrode pores at elevated temperatures, resulting in the increased contact area between the electrolyte and electrode.53"
