    "abstractText": "We present ab initio calculations of the collisional broadening of the R(0) pure rotational line in CO (at 115 GHz) perturbed by O2. Our calculations are done in a fully quantum way by solving close-coupling quantum-scattering equations without any approximations. We also report a new, highly accurate CO\u2013O2 potential energy surface on which we did the quantum-scattering calculations. The calculated collisional broadening agrees with the available experimental data in a wide temperature range. The calculated collisional shift is negligible compared to the broadening, which is also consistent with the experimental data. We combine this result with our previous calculations for the same line in CO perturbed by N2 [J\u00f3\u017awiak et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 054314 (2021)]; the obtained air-perturbed broadening of the R(0) pure rotational line in CO and its temperature dependence perfectly agree with the HITRAN database. This result constitutes an important step toward developing a methodology for providing accurate ab initio reference data on spectroscopic collisional line-shape parameters for molecular systems relevant to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and for populating spectroscopic line-by-line databases. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nCarbon monoxide is one of the important trace gases used in the study of air quality and climate forcing.1 While CO itself is not a greenhouse gas, it affects ozone and methane concentrations, thus contributing to climate change.1\u20133 Remote sensing measurements of CO can also be used to monitor air quality and emissions from burning fossil fuels.4\u20136 The oxygen molecule, O2, is the second most abundant species in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, constituting 21% of dry air. Thus, collisions with O2 significantly affect the lineshapes of the less abundant absorbing compounds.\nThe first ab initio investigation of the interaction energy in the CO\u2013O2 system was performed by Grein,7 who studied several\ngeometries of the complex using the explicitly-correlated coupledcluster method, CCSD(T)-F12, with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. Tashakor et al.8 calculated the potential energy surface (PES) of the CO\u2013O2 system with the CCSD(T) method with aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets extrapolated to the complete basis set limit (CBS). The authors considered 1260 geometries of the complex, keeping the angle between the intermolecular axis and the bond axis of the O2 molecule fixed at 90\u25cb and 180\u25cb. Recently, some of the authors calculated a high-level ab initio fourdimensional (4D) PES for the CO\u2013O2 system,9 which was used for the analysis of the infrared spectrum of the complex.\nThe experimental investigation of the collisional broadening of the pure rotational transitions in CO has a long history. In 1986,\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 174310 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0115654 157, 174310-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 20:17:10\nmeasurements of CO, N2, O2 and air broadening of the R(0) line were published by Connor and Radford10 and by Colmont and Monnanteuil.11 In a later work, Nissen et al.12 employed time and frequency domain techniques to study the broadening of the same line by CO, N2, O2 and noble gases. Other papers focused on the foreign-gas broadening of the lines R(1),13 R(2),14,15 and R(4).16 A comparison of different line-shape models for the R(0) through R(4) pure rotational lines of 12CO and 13CO at room temperature can be found in the work of Puzzarini et al.17 The only theoretical investigation of line-shape parameters in the O2-perturbed pure rotational lines of CO was mentioned in Ref. 18. It was done for the R(4) line by Botanic, who, in unpublished work, used the semiclassical Robert\u2013Bonamy formalism19 and a simplified model of the interaction energy of the colliding pair based on the Lennard\u2013Jones potential.\nIn this paper, we report a new highly accurate ab initio CO\u2013O2 PES (available in the supplementary material). We use it to calculate the line-shape of the pure rotational R(0) line in CO perturbed by O2, using an exact close-coupling approach. We find that it is dominated by pressure broadening, with negligible collisional shift. Hence, we focus on the pressure broadening coefficient and its temperature dependence. The results are consistent with experimental data in the literature.10\u201312 Finally, combining this result with a previous ab initio calculation of the broadening of the same line by N220 allows us to determine the temperature dependence of the airperturbed broadening of the R(0) line in CO, which agrees with the HITRAN database.21\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we introduce the potential energy surface and briefly describe the method of decomposing it into angular and radial terms. In Sec. III, we discuss the scattering calculations and analyze the generalized spectroscopic cross sections we obtained. In Sec. IV, we describe the calculation of the pressure broadening coefficient, and then, in Sec. V, we compare the calculated O2-broadening with experimental data. We also compare the combined O2 and N2 broadening with the air-broadening coefficient from the HITRAN database. Finally, in Sec. VI, we summarize our results and put them in their broader context."

            "text": "In the scattering calculations whose description follows, we use a 4D PES depending on the inter-molecular distance, R, the angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 between the inter-molecular axis and the axes of the molecules, and the relative dihedral angle between molecules (Fig. 1). Notice that for \u03b81 = 0\u25cb, the CO molecule aligns with the C atom pointing to the center-of-mass of the O2 molecule.\nFor construction of the PES, both monomers were held rigid at their equilibrium bond distances (1.128 21 \u00c5 for CO, and 1.207 52 \u00c5 for O2). The final high-level PES was computed using explicitly-correlated unrestricted coupled-cluster theory, UCCSD(T),22 extrapolated to the complete basis limit, UCCSD(T)F12/CBS. The basis extrapolation was performed using the VTZ-F12 and VQZ-F12 bases23 and the l\u22123 formula.24 In our experience with dimer complexes composed of a few light atoms, the binding energy and relative energies of vdW isomers are typically converged to within 1\u20132 cm\u22121 with this procedure, which does not employ\nFIG. 1. Schematic representation of the CO\u2013O2 system in Jacobi coordinates.\ncounterpoise corrections or mid-bond functions. We have previously studied the effects of basis set convergence and corecorrelation on the isomers of this system and also studied the rovibrational levels in comparison with experiments.9,25 Those previous studies support the accuracy of our new PES. All ab initio calculations were performed using the Molpro electronic structure code package.26 Stable convergence to the restricted open-shell Hartree\u2013Fock (roHF) reference was achieved by first using Molpro\u2019s complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) (multi) algorithm with the occupation of the desired configuration specified, followed by a single iteration of the roHF SCF algorithm to prepare the orbitals for the UCCSD(T)-F12b procedure. As mentioned below, to avoid placing expensive high-level data in energetically inaccessible regions, a lower-level guide surface was first constructed. This was done using data at the UCCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12 level of theory. The guide surface is only used to aid in the efficient construction of the high-level PES, on which all evaluations used to study the dynamics were performed. Exploiting the system\u2019s symmetry, energies were only computed in the reduced angular range: 0\u25cb < \u03b81 < 180\u25cb, 0\u25cb < \u03b82 < 90\u25cb, and 0\u25cb < \u03d5 < 180\u25cb.\nAs we have done in the past for other vdW linear dimers,27\u201334 an analytical representation of the PES was constructed using an automated interpolating moving least squares (IMLS) methodology, freely available as a software package under the name AUTOSURF.35 As usual,36,37 a local fit was expanded around each data point, and the final potential was obtained as the normalized weighted sum of the local fits. The fitting basis and other aspects of the procedure were the same as for other previous systems and have been described in detail elsewhere.35,37,38 The shortest intermonomer center-of-mass distance considered is R = 2.3 \u00c5, and the ab initio data coverage in the fitted PES extends to R = 20.0 \u00c5, while the zero of energy is set at infinite center-of-mass separation between the monomers. To represent the long range (out to arbitrary distances), the PES switches smoothly to an analytic expression representing electrostatic and dispersion interactions between the fragments (both truncated after seventh order). The parameters were obtained by fitting them to the ab initio data with R > 8.0 \u00c5. Induction was neglected as the fitted parameters were small and did not improve the fit. For the high-level PES, 2936 symmetry-unique points were required to achieve an estimated root-mean-squared fitting error of 0.04 cm\u22121 for energies below the asymptote. To guide the placement of high-level data, a lower-level guide surface was constructed using\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 174310 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0115654 157, 174310-2\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 20:17:10\n1434 symmetry-unique points, distributed using a Sobol sequence39 biased to sample the short-range region more densely.\nFigure 2 shows a 2D representation of the PES (denoted R-optimized) as a function of the angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 for planar (\u03d5 = 0\u25cb) and crossed (\u03d5 = 90\u25cb) configurations. The plot describes the complete ranges of \u03b81 and \u03b82, relaxing the intermonomer distance coordinate R for each pair of angles. As can be seen in the figure, three stable isomers exist. The global minimum (GM) has a well\ndepth of 120.7 cm\u22121 and corresponds to a planar (\u03d5 = 0\u25cb) slipped parallel configuration with the O-atom of CO oriented toward the O2 molecule. For the GM, \u03b81 and \u03b82 are close to 100\u25cb. A second planar local minimum exists (LM1), with a well depth of 112.1 cm\u22121 and also a slipped parallel structure, but with the C-atom of CO oriented toward the O2 molecule. In LM1, the twist is more pronounced, with both angles found near 60\u25cb. Finally, a third minimum (LM2) corresponds to a non-planar nearly cross-shaped structure, with the CO fragment tipped very slightly (\u03b81 = 88.6\u25cb) so that the C-atom is closer to the O2 fragment. The geometric parameters of the three minima in the PES are given in Table I.\nFigure 3 shows the potential as a function of R upon approach for different fixed angular configurations, including those corresponding to the three minima of the PES. The variation in those cuts gives some indication of the anisotropy of the interactions. The strength and anisotropy of the PES describing the interaction between collision partners govern the scattering dynamics and, hence, the derived line shape parameters.\nTo use the PES in scattering calculations, one needs to separate the radial and angular dependence, which can be achieved\nJ.

The radial terms were calculated for all possible values of (l1, l2, l) up to (10, 8, 18) on a uniform grid of 916 values of R between 4.25 a0 and 50 a0. The integration over \u03b81 and \u03b82 was performed using the 22-point Gauss\u2013Legendre quadrature and integration over \u03d5 using the 21-point Simpson rule. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the CO\u2013O2 radial terms with terms obtained in this work with the corresponding terms for CO\u2013N2 calculated in Ref. 20."

In the case of the electric dipole transition, considered in this work, q = 1.\nWe use a newly developed Fortran quantum-scattering code, BIGOS,47 to carry out the calculations. BIGOS propagates the solutions using a renormalized Numerov Algorithm.48 The propagation was carried out on an evenly-spaced grid of 916 values between 4.5 a0 and 50.0 a0 with 15 steps per half de Broglie wavelength for various energies up to 200 cm\u22121.\nThe criterion for determining the maximum value of J needed for convergence, Jmax, was that the largest partial elastic and inelastic state-to-state cross sections for four consecutive values of J contributed less than 10\u22123 \u00c52. The final values of Jmax used in the scattering calculations started from Jmax = 100 for Ekin < 30 cm\u22121, reaching Jmax = 150 at about 70 cm\u22121, and Jmax = 210 at 200 cm\u22121.\nThe energy basis was fixed and consisted of 36 energy levels, as shown in Table II. The same basis was used for all the calculations. The choice is based on our tests, which showed that convergence of the cross sections required many closed channels for energies below 25 cm\u22121, while the cross sections for energies above 100 cm\u22121 the stated basis was enough to reach convergence of the cross sections below 1% with respect to a fully converged basis. The amount of memory and time required for the calculations grows considerably with basis size. Thus, in order to be able to perform the calculations for energies necessary to probe the regime where the cross sections follow a simple power law, we use an effectively truncated basis for energies above 130 cm\u22121, trading computation time for accuracy.\nThe energy basis described above allows for the calculation of scattering cross sections for the first four rotational states of the perturbing molecule, O2, that is, j2 = 1, 3, 5, 7. We found the imaginary\nTABLE II. Energy levels (in cm\u22121) used in the calculations of generalized spectroscopic cross sections.

Increasing its size from 36 (with j1max = 8 and j2max = 7) to 50 levels (j1max = 9 and j2max = 9) could change the broadening cross sections by up to 1.7%. Another factor influencing the results comes from the extrapolation of the kinetic energy dependence of Re \u03c310 . In the final calculations, we use the cutoffs stated in Table III, taking ab initio points below the cutoffs and using the fit function above them. To estimate the effect of their choice on the final results, we varied them in the range of \u00b120 cm\u22121. The results obtained that way differed by up to 0.6%. The final contribution to the uncertainty of the calculations comes from the choice of parameters of the propagator used to solve the close coupling equations (Rmin, Rmax, and step size). The starting point of the propagation, Rmin, should be set deep in the classically forbidden region, where interaction is strongly repulsive, while at the ending point, Rmax, the radial terms must vanish, allowing for application of the boundary conditions. We estimate the influence of Rmin and Rmax at 0.1% each. To choose the step size (expressed equivalently as a number of steps per half de Broglie wavelength), we ran sample\nTABLE IV.

The cited values are a result of fitting the measured air-broadening data for several bands simultaneously, including measurements for 1\u20130, 2\u20130 and 3\u20130 bands from Refs. 55\u201357 and expanding the results for all the air-broadened transitions of CO."

We calculated the generalized spectroscopic cross sections for the first four rotational levels of the perturber for energies up to 200 cm\u22121 from the close-coupling equations without the use of any further dynamical approximations.

This work is part of an effort concerning theoretical investigations of collisional effects on the structure of rotational lines involving molecules of atmospheric importance.\nApart from collisional broadening and its speed dependence, ab initio calculations can provide collisional shift (and its speed dependence), as well as the complex frequency of optical velocity changing collisions,52 which deteriorate the shape of molecular resonances. These quantities are often not large enough to be detected in the experiment, and thus calculations from first principles might serve as reference data for future measurements. We note here that the first two ab initio databases provided in Refs. 58 and 59 for H2\u2013He and HD\u2013He involve line shape parameters for thousands of lines, for which measurements of collisional parameters have never been performed. The work presented here constitutes the first step toward a similar database for the O2-perturbed lines in the CO molecule.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe new 4D CO\u2013O2 potential energy surface on which the calculations were performed is available as a supplementary material."
