    "abstractText": "Based on the well-known rotor-vibrator model and the particle-plus-rotor model, multiparticle-hole excitations from a collective even-even core described by the rotor-vibrator is considered to describe well-deformed even-even nuclei. Like the particle-plus-rotor model, the intrinsic Vierergruppe (D2) symmetry is still preserved in the rotor-vibrator plus multi-particle-hole description. It is shown that a series of experimentally observed 0+ states in these nuclei may be interpreted as the multi-particle-hole excitations in a complementary manner to the beta and gamma vibrations described by the rotor-vibrator model. As a typical example of the model application, low-lying positive parity level energies below 1.990 MeV in the eight experimentally identified positive parity bands; a series of 0+ excitation energies up to 0 16; and some experimentally known B(E2) values, E2 branching ratios, and E2/M1 and E0/E2 mixing ratios of 154Gd are fitted and compared to the experimental data. The results suggest that the multi-particle-hole-pair configuration mixing may play a role in these 0+ states.",

            "text": "As is well known, both the collective model and the interacting boson model (IBM) are very successful in describing spectroscopy of medium and heavy mass nuclei in low-energy regime [1,2]. Shape phase evolution in these nuclei has also been extensively studied [3\u20138]. Shell model description of deformed nuclei has also been studied extensively [9\u201311] based on the pseudo SU(3) model [12\u201314]. Up until now, most studies on low-lying spectra of deformed nuclei in both rare earth and actinide regions have focused on a few low-lying bands [15\u201323]. In [9\u201311], besides several low-lying bands, strongly enhanced M1 strengths and related 1+ states were focused. However, it can be observed from the experimental data of these well-deformed nuclei, typically in even-even 154\u2212160Gd, that there are many 0+ excited states populated below 3 MeV, which is also related to the long-term debate on the nature of the low-lying 0+ states [24\u201327]. Nevertheless, these 0+ states have not been fully taken into account in model calculations [15\u201323].\nAlthough rigorous shell model calculations with configuration mixing are needed in order to reveal the nature of the 0+ states, the collective rotation\u2013vibration model (RVM) [28] is the simplest, at least qualitatively, to describe the low-lying rotational bands, such as the ground-state, beta-, and gamma-vibration bands; although, these 0+ states described by the RVM are questionable with too high excitation energies of 0+u levels with u \u2265 4 compared to the corresponding experimental data [29]. Moreover, the particle-plus-rotor model (PRM) [1,30\u201334] is often adopted to describe well-deformed odd-A and odd-odd nuclei, where the rotor is used to describe the collective motion of the even-even core,\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2620. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14122620 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nwhile the deformed Nilsson model is used to describe the concerned like-particles. As an extension, in this work, we consider particle-hole excitations from the collective even-even core, with which the 0+ and other bands are modified by the multi-particle-hole excitations. Although the model Hamiltonian proposed can be applied to any well-deformed nucleus, only 154Gd is taken as an example in the fit, of which the main features persist when the model is applied to other deformed nuclei."

            "text": "We take the RVM Hamiltonian for the core of a well-deformed even-even nucleus. Instead of the RVM Hamiltonian, one can also use the Davydov\u2013Chaban version of the collective Hamiltonian [35], of which, however, the main features are quite similar to those of the RVM. According to the PRM prescription [1,30\u201334], the Hamiltonian with configuration mixing due to multi-particle-hole excitations from the core is approximated as\nH\u0302 = P (\nH\u0302RV + H\u0302 pro in + H\u0302 n in\n) P, (1)\nwhere H\u0302RV is the RVM Hamiltonian, which is approximated to be the same when a few particles and holes are excited from the core for simplicity; H\u0302proin (H\u0302 n in) contains proton (neutron), single-particle (p), and single-hole (h) energy terms and the interaction among K = 0 like-particle and like-hole pairs due to the fact that the nuclear shape described by the RVM is approximately axially symmetric, where K is the quantum number of the projection of the angular momentum along the third axis of the intrinsic frame and P is the projection operator, which projects onto 0p0h, 2p2h and 1p1h, 3p3h even parity K = 0 subspace of protons and neutrons. Namely, as an approximation, only 2p2h excitations established on the 0p0h and 1p1h basis of protons and neutrons are considered. The RVM Hamiltonian is given by [25,28]\nH\u0302RV = L2 \u2212 L2z\u2032\n2=0 + L2z\u2032 16B\u03b72 \u2212 h\u0304 2 2B\n( \u22022\n\u2202\u03be2 + 1 2\n\u22022\n\u2202\u03b72\n) +\n1 2 C0\u03be2 + C2\u03b72 \u2212 h\u03042 16B\u03b72 , (2)\nwhere B is the inertia parameter; C0 and C2 are the stiffness parameters; =0 = 3B\u03b220 is the moment of inertia, in which \u03b20 is the deformation parameter; L\u03c4 with \u03c4 = x\u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032 are the angular momentum operators of the core in the intrinsic frame; and \u03be and \u03b7 are variables in describing small \u03b2 and \u03b3 vibrations.

The last term of (3) and (4) describes the interaction of the 2p- and 2h-pairs, which is assumed to be level-independent with real constant gpro \u2248 gn = g < 0 in the calculation, where\nS+\u03c1,i = a \u2020 \u03c1,i \u2126i a \u2020 \u03c1,i \u2126\u0304i , S\u2212\u03c1,i = (S + \u03c1,i) \u2020,\nS\u2212\u03c1,\u2212i\u2032 = a\u03c1,\u2212i\u2032 \u2212\u2126\u2212i\u2032 a\u03c1,\u2212i\u2032 ,\u2212\u2126\u0304\u2212i\u2032 , S + \u03c1,\u2212i\u2032 = (S \u2212 \u03c1,\u2212i\u2032) \u2020 (7)\nare K = 0 particle- and hole-pair creation and annihilation operators, respectively. As is well known, the RVM Hamiltonian is invariant under the intrinsic Vierergruppe (D2) transformation. It is obvious that the D2 symmetry is still preserved when the interactions among 2p- and 2h-pairs are involved. Since only one proton (neutron) particle-pair or holepair is considered, the proton (neutron) pairing interaction is neglected due to the fact that the pairing interaction of only one particle-pair or one hole-pair is relatively weak [36,37] in this case.\nIn the calculation, similar to the approximation made in the PRM with the RVM description of the core, rotational energies of the particles and holes, and the rotationparticle and rotation-hole coupling terms are also neglected [28]. An eigenstate of the RVM Hamiltonian (2) is written as |n\u03b2, n\u03b3, K, L M\u3009, where n\u03b2 and n\u03b3 are the number of \u03b2 and \u03b3 phonons, respectively; L is the quantum number of the total angular momentum in this case; K and M are the quantum numbers of the angular momentum projected onto the z\u2032 axis of the intrinsic frame and z axis of the laboratory frame, respectively. The corresponding eigenvalue of (2) is given by [28]\nE n\u03b2 ,n\u03b3 ,K L = E0 2 ( L(L + 1)\u2212 K2 ) + E\u03b3 ( K 2 + 1 + 2n\u03b3 ) + E\u03b2 (n\u03b2 + 12 ),\nE0 = h\u0304 2 =0 , E\u03b2 = h\u0304 \u221a C0 B , E\u03b3 = h\u0304 \u221a C2 B , (8)\nfor n\u03b2 = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\u03b3 = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , K = 0, 2, 4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , and for given K,\nL = {\nK, K + 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , for K 6= 0, 0, 2, 4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , for K = 0. (9)\nWhen there are p\u2032\u03c1 (p\u03c1) Nilsson levels below (above) the Fermi surface, eigenstates of the model Hamiltonian (1) in this case can be expressed as\n|n\u03b2, n\u03b3, K; \u03bepro, \u03ben; L M\u3009 = N\u03beproN\u03ben ( 1 + \u2211i,j C \u03bepro j,i S + pro,jS \u2212 pro,\u2212i ) \u00d7(\n1 + \u2211i\u2032 ,j\u2032 C \u03ben j\u2032 ,i\u2032 S + n,j\u2032S \u2212 n,\u2212i\u2032 ) |n\u03b2, n\u03b3, K, L M\u3009, (10)\nwhere |n0, n\u03b3, K, L M\u3009 is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian of the core (2) and is assumed to be the vacuum state of particles outside of the core and the holes within the core, simultaneously; C \u03be\u03c1 ji is the expansion coefficient; and N\u03be\u03c1 is the normalization constant. In the following, except for the ground-state band with \u03bepro = \u03ben = 1, the other excited bands described by (10) are simply called 2p2h bands. In the calculation, the Fermi surface of protons or neutrons is determined by the last occupied Nilsson level of protons or neutrons at the ground state of the Nilsson shell model for a given even-even nucleus. Besides the eigenstates built on 0p0h shown in (10), there are those built on 1p1h excitation with a K = 0 1p1h pair, which are the next lowest in energy to be considered with\n|n\u03b2, n\u03b3, K; (\u2212i\u2032\u03c1, j\u2032\u03c1); \u03bepro, \u03ben; L M\u3009 = N\u03beproN\u03ben ( 1 + \u2211\u2032i,j C \u03bepro j,i S + pro,jS \u2212 pro,\u2212i )( 1 + \u2211\u2032i\u2032\u2032 ,j\u2032\u2032 C \u03ben j\u2032\u2032 ,i\u2032\u2032 S + n,j\u2032\u2032S \u2212 n,\u2212i\u2032\u2032 ) \u00d7\n|(\u2212i\u2032\u03c1, j\u2032\u03c1); n\u03b2, n\u03b3, K, L M\u3009, (11)\nwhere the summation is over the Nilsson levels not occupied by the single-particle and the single-hole, namely, j\u2032\u03c1 and \u2212i\u2032\u03c1 levels are excluded within the sum, and\n|(\u2212i\u2032\u03c1, j\u2032\u03c1); n\u03b2, n\u03b3, K, L M\u3009 = S+\u03c1,j\u2032\u03c1 ,\u2212i\u2032\u03c1 |n\u03b2, n\u03b3, K, L M\u3009\n(12)\nwith [1]\nS+ \u03c1,j\u2032\u03c1 ,\u2212i\u2032\u03c1 = \u221a 1 2 ( a\u2020\u03c1,j\u2032\u03c1 , \u2126j\u2032\u03c1 a\u03c1,\u2212i\u2032\u03c1 ,\u2212\u2126\u0304\u2212i\u2032\u03c1 \u2212 a\u2020\u03c1,j\u2032\u03c1 , \u2126\u0304j\u2032\u03c1 a\u03c1,\u2212i\u2032\u03c1 ,\u2212\u2126\u2212i\u2032\u03c1 ) , (13)\nin which j\u2032\u03c1 and \u2212i\u2032\u03c1 stand for the Nilsson levels occupied by the single particle and hole with the same parity, satisfying \u2126j\u2032\u03c1 = \u2126\u2212i\u2032\u03c1 . The excitation bands described by (11) are called 1p1h bands.\nThe expansion coefficients in (10) and (11) can be expressed as\nC \u03be\u03c1 ji = g E\u03be\u03c1 + 2\u03b5\u03c1\u2212i\u03c1 , \u2126\u2212i\u03c1 \u2212 2\u03b5 \u03c1 j\u03c1 , \u2126j\u03c1 , (14)\nwhere E\u03be\u03c1 should satisfy\nE\u03be\u03c1 = \u2211 \u2032 i,j g2\nE\u03be\u03c1 + 2\u03b5\u03c1\u2212i\u03c1 , \u2126\u2212i\u03c1 \u2212 2\u03b5 \u03c1 j\u03c1 , \u2126j\u03c1\n, (15)\nin which \u03be\u03c1 stands for the \u03be\u03c1-th root of (15), while the prime stands for the exclusion of occupied Nilsson level.

(17)\nSimilar to the multi-particle-hole configuration mixing schemes in the interacting boson model [38\u201340], the E2 operator is defined as\nT\u00b5(E2) = Qc\u00b5 + Q ph \u00b5 + \u2211\u03c1 \u03bb\u03c1P\u03c1 ( Qc\u00b5 + Q ph \u00b5 ) P\u03c1 + \u03bbpro,nPproPn ( Qc\u00b5 + Q ph \u00b5 ) PnPpro, (18)\nwhere P\u03c1 is the projection operator, which projects onto the 0p0h, 2p2h and 1p1h, 3p3h even parity K = 0 subspace of protons or neutrons; \u03bbpro, \u03bbn, and \u03bbpro,n are the configuration mixing parameters; Qc\u00b5 is the quadrupole operator of the RVM [25,28],\nQc\u00b5 = 3ZeR20\n4\u03c0 { D2\u2217\u00b50(\u03b8) ( \u03b20(1 + \u03b1) + \u03be(1 + 2\u03b1) + \u03b1(\u03be2 \u2212 2\u03b72) ) +(\nD2\u2217\u00b52(\u03b8) + D 2\u2217 \u00b5\u22122(\u03b8)\n)( (1\u2212 2\u03b1)\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03be\u03b7 ) } (19)\nwith R0 = 1.2 A1/3 fm for the nucleus with the mass number A and \u03b1 = \u221a\n20/(7\u03c0) \u03b20, while D2\u2217\u00b5\u03bd(\u03b8) is the Wigner D-function of the Euler angles \u03b8 \u2261 (\u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83) and Q ph \u00b5 is the quadrupole operator of the particles and holes. Since 1p1h bands are relatively high, if the 1p1h states (11) are not considered, only the diagonal part of Qph\u00b5 contributes, which can be expressed as\nQph,dig\u00b5 = D2\u2217\u00b50(\u03b8)\u2211 \u03c1\n( \u2211\ni q\u03c1i n \u03c1 i + \u2211 i q\u0304\u03c1\u2212in \u03c1,h \u2212i\n) (20)\nwith\nq\u03c1i = e\u03c1 r 2 0 \u2211 l,j,l\u2032 ,j\u2032 Wil\u2032 j\u2032\u2126W i l j\u2126\u3008No(l \u2032 1 2 )j\u2032\u2126|(r/r0)2Y20|No(l 1 2 )j\u2126\u3009,\nq\u0304\u03c1\u2212i = \u2212e\u03c1 r 2 0 \u2211 l,j,l\u2032 ,j\u2032 W\u2212il\u2032 j\u2032\u2126W \u2212i l j\u2126\u3008No(l \u2032 1 2 )j\u2032\u2126|(r/r0)2Y20|No(l 1 2 )j\u2126\u3009, (21)\nwhere No is the number of phonons of a major oscillator shell; r20 = 1.012 A 1/3 fm2; e\u03c1 is the effective charge of the particles, of which the hole is taken to be the same absolute value of that of the particle but with the opposite sign; Wil j\u2126 is the expansion coefficients of the i-th Nilsson level in terms of the eigenstates of the spherical harmonic oscillator; n\u03c1,h\u2212i is the number of holes in the Nilsson level \u2212i; (l j)j\u2032 stands for the angular momentum coupling; and the matrix element \u3008No(l\u2032 12 )j\u2032\u2126|(r/r0)2Y20|No(l 1 2 )j\u2126\u3009 is given by\n\u3008No(l\u2032 1 2 )j\u2032\u2126|(r/r0)2Y20|No(l 1 2 )j\u2126\u3009 = \u2211\nl\u2032\u2032ml ms\n\u221a 5(2l + 1)\n4\u03c0(2l\u2032\u2032 + 1) \u3008l\u2032ml ; 1 2 ms|j\u2032\u2126\u3009 \u00d7\n\u3008lml ; 1 2 ms|j\u2126\u3009\u3008lml ; 2 0|l\u2032\u2032ml\u3009\u3008l0; 2 0|l\u2032\u20320\u3009\u3008Nol\u2032|(r/r0)2|Nol\u2032\u2032\u3009, (22)\nwhere \u3008lml ; 12 ms|j\u2126\u3009 etc. are the SU(2) Clebsch\u2013Gordan (CG) coefficients, and\n\u3008Nol\u2032|(r/r0)2|Nol\u2032\u2032\u3009 = (No + 32 )\u03b4l\u2032 l\u2032\u2032 +\u221a (No + l\u2032 + 1)(N \u2212 l\u2032 + 2) \u03b4l\u2032\u2032 l\u2032\u22122 + \u221a (No + l\u2032 + 3)(N \u2212 l\u2032) \u03b4l\u2032\u2032 l\u2032+2.

            "heading": "3. Model Fit to 154Gd",
            "text": "Low-lying bands of 154Gd have been studied theoretically using the dynamic deformation model [15], the coherent state model [16], and the interacting boson model [17\u201323]. However, only the ground-state, beta-, and gamma-bands were discussed. In this section, we take 154Gd as an example to be fitted by the present model. The deformation parameters e2 = 0.22 corresponding to \u03b20 \u2248 0.232 and e4 = \u22120.04 for the Nilsson single-particle energies of 154Gd are taken from [44], with which a few Nilsson single-particle energies of protons and neutrons near the Fermi surface corresponding to proton number Z = 64 and neutron number N = 90 are shown in Table 1. The lowest four pure 1p1h excitation energies with two of neutrons and two of protons are also shown in the lower part of Table 1.\nNeutron-1h1p: \u2212\u03b5n(+)\u22124,3/2 + \u03b5 n(+) 1,3/2 = 2.353, \u2212\u03b5 n(\u2212) \u22121,3/2 + \u03b5 n(\u2212) 2,3/2 = 1.370. Proton-1h1p: \u2212\u03b5 pro(+) \u22124,3/2 + \u03b5 pro(+) 1,3/2 = 1.859, \u2212\u03b5pro(+)\u22121,5/2 + \u03b5 pro(+) 5,5/2 = 1.679.\nWe use the model Hamiltonian (1) to fit positive parity level energies below 1.990 MeV in the eight experimentally identified positive parity bands of 154Gd provided in the level scheme of [29], while the level energy of 5+3 state is taken from the recent thesis [45]. In the fitting, 20 Nilsson single-particle energies of both protons and neutrons near the Fermi surface are taken with p\u03c1 = p\u2032\u03c1 = 10. It is observed that the level energies (in MeV) only vary at the second decimal place if more Nillson single-particle energies are taken into\naccount when |g| \u2264 0.3 MeV, and can be readjusted by the interaction strength g. The calculation shows that the more the Nillson levels are taken into account, the smaller the interaction strength |g| required in order to obtain a best fit to the 0+ band head energies concerned. Therefore, the actual interaction strength |g| is smaller than that shown in Table 2. The first part of Table 2 shows the fitting results of level energies below 1.990 MeV in the eight experimentally identified positive parity bands provided in [29,45], where the band numbers are assigned in [29], and the underlined 4+7 and 4 + 8 level energies above 1.990 MeV in bands 11 and 12, respectively, are also shown. It should be noted that spin and parity of the level energy at 2.088 MeV assigned to be 4+8 in this work are not determined in experiments [29]. In the fitting, it is observed that the gap of the first and the second 2p2h excitation energies is always less than 0.3 MeV if the interaction strength |g| \u2264 0.3 MeV is considered. As the consequence, the first two 2p2h excitations may be the 0+3 and 0 + 4 band heads or the 0+4 and 0 + 5 band heads, of which the gaps are around 0.15 MeV. Accordingly, in Scheme 1 (S1), the 0+3 band head is fitted as the first 2p2h state. Hence, the beta-vibration energy E\u03b2 and the interaction strength g are adjusted according to the 0+2 and 0 + 3 excitation energies, respectively. In Scheme 2 (S2), the 0+4 band head is fitted as the first 2p2h state, for which the beta-vibration energy E\u03b2 is adjusted according to the 0+2 and 0 + 3 excitation energies, while the interaction strength g is adjusted according to the 0+4 excitation energy. The lower part of Table 2 provides the fitting results of a series of 0+ excitation energies up to 0+16 in the two schemes, where n\u03b2 stands for n\u03b2 = n and K = 0; n\u03b3 stands for n\u03b3 = n and K = 0; 2p2h stands for the 2p2h-band head with K = 0, n\u03b2 = 0, n\u03b3 = 0; and 1p1h stands for 1p1h-band head with K = 0, n\u03b2 = 0, n\u03b3 = 0. The lowest eight 0+ excitation energies obtained from the RVM are also provided. The fitting results of the levels in the eight bands in comparison to the experimental ones are shown in Figure 1.\nIn the fitting to the level energies,\n\u03c3(E) = ( 1 N N \u2211 i=1 (Eexpi \u2212 E th i ) 2 )1/2 (48)\nis used, where N is the number of data used in the fitting, Ethi is a level energy obtained from this work, and Eexpi is the corresponding experimental value. As far as the level energies in the eight bands are concerned, \u03c3S1(E) = 0.113 MeV and \u03c3S2(E) = 0.167 MeV indicate that S1 is a little better than S2 in fitting to the level energies. The fitting quality of the RVM is the same as that of S2 if the level energies in bands 11 and 12 are excluded. As is clearly shown in the lower part of Table 2, the 0+u (u \u2265 4) band head energies produced from the RVM are much higher than the corresponding experimental results, while 0+u (u \u2264 11) level energies are well reproduced in both S1 and S2.\nTable 3 shows the intra- and inter-band reduced E2 transition probabilities of the lowest three bands, namely, the ground-state band (n\u03b2 = 0, K = 0, n\u03b3 = 0), the 0+2 -band (n\u03b2 = 1, K = 0, n\u03b3 = 0), and the gamma-band (n\u03b2 = 0, K = 2, n\u03b3 = 0) calculated from S1, S2, and the RVM. The common feature of S1, S2, and the RVM results shown in Table 3 is that the B(E2) values of the intra-band transitions in the ground-state band are equal to the corresponding ones in the 0+2 -band. The root mean square deviation of these B(E2) values is defined similar to that of the level energies shown in (48) is \u03c3S1(B(E2)) = 0.322 e2b2 in S1, \u03c3S2(B(E2)) = 0.285 e2b2 in S2, and \u03c3RVM(B(E2)) = 0.344 e2b2 in the RVM. Hence, the RVM with particle-hole configuration mixing seems much better than the original RVM in describing the level energies and slightly better in the intra- and inter-band reduced E2 transition probabilities of the lowest three bands. Moreover, only the electric quadrupole moment of the 2+1 state of\n154Gd is experimentally available. Q(2+1 ) calculated from S1, S2, and the RVM are \u22122.755 eb, \u22122.850 eb, and \u22122.688 eb, respectively, which are all a little larger than the experimental value Qexp(2+1 ) = \u22121.82 (4) eb [29]. Table 4 shows the branching ratios B(E2; L+i \u2192 L \u2032+ f )/B(E2; L + i \u2192 L + f ). It can be observed that the B(E2) ratios of the transitions within the lowest three bands obtained from S1, S2, and the RVM shown on the left part of Table 4 are almost the same, among which most of the ratios are merely proportional to the square of the ratio of the related CG coefficients. Although there is discrepancy in comparison to the corresponding experimental values, the data pattern of these ratios follows that of the experimental data, which also indicate that most of these ratios are irrelevant to the particle-hole excitation. The most noticeable deviation occurs in the B(E2) ratios of the transitions from the 0+3 band to the beta-band and those from the 0+3 band to the ground-state band shown in the right part of Table 4. Most of these ratios obtained from S1 are too small, while they are too large in both S2 and the RVM. The fitting quality of the dynamic pairing plus quadrupole model [15,46] for these ratios [46] is quite similar to that of S2 or the RVM. As shown in Table 2, the 0+3 band head is assigned as the first 2p2h state, while it is the two \u03b2-phonon (n\u03b2 = 2) state in both S2 and the RVM.\nA model calculation with a mixing of the two configurations determined in S1 and S2 may improve the results but there will be many parameters involved. The two exceptions are the ratios B(E2; 4+5 \u2192 2 + 4 )/B(E2; 4 + 5 \u2192 4 + 1 ) and B(E2; 4 + 6 \u2192 4 + 2 )/B(E2; 4 + 6 \u2192 2 + 1 ). The former is 84.0, 26.4, and 25.5 times larger in S1, S2, and the RVM, respectively, than the experimental value, while the latter is about 18 times larger in S1, S2, and the RVM than the experimental value.\nHowever, there are only a few magnetic dipole moments of low-lying states, and B(M1) values of the transitions between low-lying states are experimentally available [42]. Therefore, experimentally deduced \u2206 \u2261 E2/M1 ratios reported in [41] are calculated in order to validate the theory. In principle, the two experimentally measured magnetic dipole moments and two B(M1) values can be used to fix the four gyromagnetic ratios in (28). In the calculation, g0, g1, and g2 are fixed by the two magnetic dipole moments and B(M1, 2+2 \u2192 2 + 1 ), respectively, while g3 is determined by a least square fit to the known E2/M1 ratios of the transitions from the 2+3 band to the ground-state band. The four gyromagnetic ratios thus determined, together with the two magnetic dipole moments and two B(M1) values, are shown in Table 5. It can be noticed in Table 5 that B(M1, 2+3 \u2192 2 + 1 ) in S1, S2, and the RVM is about 2 times smaller than the experimental value in order to obtain a\nbest fit to the E2/M1 ratios of the inter-band transitions from the 2+3 band to the groundstate band. The calculated results of the E2/M1 ratios in comparison to the experimental data [41] are shown in Table 6, in which the IBM results of these ratios [41] are also included for comparison. It is shown in Table 6 that the ratios of the inter-band transitions obtained from both S1 and S2 are the same, which is due to the fact that these ratios are independent of the configuration mixing parameters, while the only intra-band transition calculated in S1 is slightly different from that in S2, because the configuration mixing parameters and the contribution to the E2 matrix element from particles and holes are involved. The deviation from the experimental E2/M1 values defined similar to that of the level energies shown in (48) is \u03c3S1,S2(\u2206) = 2.15 eb/\u00b5N , \u03c3RVM(\u2206) = 2.17 eb/\u00b5N , and \u03c3IBM(\u2206) = 4.04 eb/\u00b5N , in which \u2206(3+1 \u2192 2 + 3 ) is excluded due to the uncertain experimental value. Therefore, except that the B(M1, 2+3 \u2192 2 + 1 ) obtained from S1, S2, and the RVM is about two times smaller than the experimental value, which was not calculated in the IBM fit [41], the S1 and S2 results are the best.\nThe mixing ratio B(E0; 0+i \u2192 0 + f )/B(E2; 0 + i \u2192 2 + 1 ) up to the 0 + 4 state and \u03c1 2(E0, 0+2 \u2192 0+1 ) \u00d7 103 are also calculated, which are shown in Table 7. It can be observed that the \u03c12(E0, 0+2 \u2192 0 + 1 )\u00d7 103 obtained from S1, S2, and the RVM is about two times larger than the experimental value, which is due to the fact that this value is almost independent of the particle-hole excitation. The main reason of why the mixing ratios of S1 differ from those of S2 is that 0+3 is the 2p2h state in S1, while it is the two \u03b2-phonon state in S2. Although the results of S1 seem closer to the the experimental data, the ratio B(E0; 0+3 \u2192 0 + 1 )/B(E0; 0 + 3 \u2192 0 + 2 ) deduced from S1 and S2 or the RVM is 27.62 and 0.020, while that deduced from the experimental data is 0.11, which shows once again that a configuration mixing of the two schemes may improve the model results.\nTable 7.

            "text": "In this work, based on the collective rotor-vibrator model and the particle-plus-rotor model, multi-particle-hole excitations from a collective even-even core described by the rotor-vibrator are adopted to describe well-deformed even-even nuclei, which is a primary attempt to reveal the nature of a series of 0+ states observed in these nuclei. It is shown that a series of experimentally observed 0+ states in these nuclei may be interpreted as the multi-particle-hole excitations complementary to the beta and gamma vibrations described by the rotor-vibrator model. As a typical example of the model application, low-lying positive parity level energies below 1.990 MeV in the eight experimentally identified positive parity bands; a series of 0+ excitation energies up to 0+16; and some experimentally known B(E2) values, E2 branching ratios, E2/M1 and E0/E2 mixing ratios of 154Gd are fitted and compared to the experimental results.\nIn fitting to the level energies below 1.990 MeV in the eight experimentally identified positive parity bands in 154Gd, two schemes with the 0+3 band head as the 2p2h state and that as the two beta-phonon state are considered. It is shown that the fitting quality of the two schemes is quite the same and much better than the original RVM, especially when higher excited 0+u bands with u = 6 and u = 7 are involved. Although the B(E2) values of the transitions within the lowest three bands obtained from S1, S2, and the RVM are quite the same and close to the corresponding experimental data, there is noticeable deviation in the B(E2) ratios of the transitions from the 0+3 band to the 0 + 2 band and those from the 0+3 band to the ground-state band. Most of these ratios obtained from scheme 1 is too small, while they are too large in both scheme 2 and the RVM. Although the E2/M1 ratios fitted by S1, S2, and the RVM are acceptable and better than those fitted by the IBM [41], B(M1, 2+3 \u2192 2 + 1 ) obtained from S1, S2, and the RVM is about two times smaller than the experimental value in order to obtain a best fit to the E2/M1 ratios of the inter-band transitions from the 2+3 band to the ground-state band. Except for B(M1, 2+3 \u2192 2 + 1 ), the E2/M1 ratios obtained from S1 and S2 are better than those obtained from the original RVM. Deviations in the mixing ratios B(E0; 0+i \u2192 0 + f )/B(E2; 0 + i \u2192 2 + 1 ) up to the 0+4 state also occur in the two schemes. Therefore, although there will be many parameters involved, a model calculation with a mixing of the two configurations determined in scheme 1 and scheme 2 may improve the results. Previously, it was pointed out that the 0+3 band head is a pairing isomer and can hardly be interpreted as the pure two beta-phonon state [46]. Similar conclusions on the 0+2 state with possible 2p2h configuration mixing were also drawn in [26,27]. As pointed out in [48], the pairing isomer can be viewed as an excited state with different deformation of the Fermi surface from that of the ground state, which is related to the so-called shape coexistence and configuration mixing [48]. Furthermore, it is concluded in [25,48] that strong proton-pair-neutron-pair correlations must be involved in low-lying 0+ states of well-deformed even-even nuclei. The analysis of the simplified multi-particle-hole configuration mixing schemes shown in this work further confirms these conclusions, although only a part of the pairing interactions among like-nucleon pairs [25,48] are taken in effect in the 2p- and 2h-pair interaction introduced in the present work.\nIt is obvious that many improvements can be made in order to provide more accurate model descriptions of well-deformed nuclei. For example, rotational energies of particles\nand holes, and the rotation-particle and rotation-hole coupling terms neglected in the present calculation, should be included resulting in the well-known K-band mixing [49,50], with which the B(E2) values of the intra-band transitions within the 0+3 and 0 + 4 bands, and the related inter-band transitions and E2/M1 ratios, may be improved. Configuration mixing of the excited core with different deformation from that of the unexcited one, together with the multi-particle-hole excitations with the different deformed bases, can be considered to reveal possible shape coexistence [48] and to improve the model description of the electromagnetic transitions. A more precise description in considering all valence proton and neutron pairs confined within a deformed single-particle potential with pairing interactions is also possible. By doing so, not only can the pairing interactions among both neutron and proton pairs, together with multi-particle-hole excitations from a closed shell, be fully taken into account, but also 1+ states formed from isovector proton\u2013neutron pairs leading to the scissor and twist modes [9\u201311] lying higher in energy and not considered in this work can be produced to study the strongly enhanced M1 transitions in well-deformed nuclei. With these improvements, a model calculation for a chain of isotopes may be carried out to investigate the consistency of shape phase evolution in these nuclei [6,7,16,37]. These possible improvements will be considered in our future work. Furthermore, besides experiment in measuring E2 and M1 transition rates and mixing ratios more precisely similar to that reported in [45,46,51], two-nucleon transfer reactions in measuring 0+ nucleon-pair transfer reaction rates in these well-deformed nuclei suggested in [25] are in demand, from which the nature of a series of excited 0+ states can be further analyzed.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, F.P.; numerical calculations and analyses, Y.W., A.L. and L.D.; writing\u2014original draft, F.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.P.D.; plus senior leadership and oversight, F.P. and J.P.D.
