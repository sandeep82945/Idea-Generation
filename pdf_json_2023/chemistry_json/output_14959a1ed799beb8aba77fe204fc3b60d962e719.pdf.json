    "abstractText": "Fungi have been used in the production of a wide range of biologically active metabolites, including potent herbicides. In the search for pesticides of natural origin, Aspergillus sparsus NBERC_28952, a fungal strain with herbicidal activity, was obtained. Chemical study of secondary metabolites from NBERC_28952 resulted in the isolation of three new asperugin analogues, named Aspersparin A\u2013C (2\u20134), and a new azaphilone derivative, named Aspersparin D (5), together with two known compounds, Asperugin B (1) and sydonic acid (6). The structures of these compounds were elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic data and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All of the isolated compounds were evaluated for their herbicidal activities on seedlings of Echinochloa crusgalli and Amaranthus retroflexus through Petri dish bioassays. Among them, compounds 5 and 6 exhibited moderate inhibitory activities against the growth of the roots and shoots of E. crusgalli seedlings in a dose-dependent manner, while 6 showed obvious inhibitory effect on seedlings of A. retroflexus, with an inhibitory rate of 78.34% at a concentration of 200 \u03bcg/mL. These herbicidal metabolites represent a new source of compounds to control weeds.",

A lot of measures, including cultivation, mechanical operations, and the application of chemicals, have been implemented to control weeds. However, the excessive use of chemical herbicides leads to residue seepage into the environment and the increased resistance of weeds to such compounds [2]. Given the present concerns about the negative impacts of chemical herbicides on human health and the environment, it is necessary to develop safer compounds to ensure the sustainability of crop production. Natural products have played an important role in the development of pesticides for crop protection [3]. An analysis showed that 41.8% of the pesticides listed in the registry of the Environmental Protection Agency were based on active ingredients developed with natural products [4]. Natural products might be a source of new herbicidal entities with potentially new modes of actions [5]. Fungi are considered as one of the richest sources of natural products among living organisms [6]. The phytotoxins produced by fungi are often suitable for the pathogenesis or infection of weeds [7]. Fungi of Aspergillus spp. have been shown to be excellent sources of new natural chemicals [8\u201312], some of which have shown promising herbicidal activities. For example, Asperalacid D, a new natural sesquiterpenoid from Aspergillus alabamensis, showed higher plant growth inhibitory activity on wheat\nPlants 2023, 12, 203. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12010203 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2023, 12, 203 2 of 11\nroot and shoot elongation than terbutryn [13]. Additionally, 8-methoxycichorine, 8-epimethoxycichorine, and N-(4\u2032-carboxybutyl) cichorine, three novel cichorine analogues with an isoindolinone skeleton, obtained from A. nidulans, exhibited superior phytotoxicity to cichorine on the leaves of Zea mays and Medicago polymorpha [14]. Dihydrosterigmatocystin, isolated from an alga-derived fungus, Aspergillus versicolor, caused leaf necrosis and plant wilting in Amaranthus retroflexus, with a MIC of 24.5 \u00b5M, i.e., almost four-fold stronger than that of glyphosate [15]. This indicates the potential for discovering novel herbicidal compounds from the secondary metabolites of fungi in the genus Aspergillus. During the course of screening for microbial secondary metabolites possessing bioactivities, we isolated some active compounds with new structures [16\u201318]. In an ongoing effort to discover bioactive natural products obtained from microbes, our attention was drawn to the fungus A. sparsus NBERC_28952 because of its potent herbicidal activity. In this study, we describe the isolation, structure, and herbicidal activities of the compounds obtained from NBERC_28952. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on this topic."

The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2, Figures S9 and S10) of the phenolic part of compound 2 were almost the same as those of 1. However, in the 1D-NMR and HSQC (see Figure S11) spectra of 2, the farnesyl side chain included four methyls (\u03b4C 23.0, 23.0, 16.5, 16.3), four methylenes (\u03b4C 69.4, 39.9, 39.8, 26.5), five methines (\u03b4C 140.1, 126.2, 124.8, 120.8, 32.1), and two quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 143.6, 136.6), in contrast to compound 1.

The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2, Figures S9 and S10) of the phenolic part of compound 2 were almost the sa e as those of 1. However, in the 1D-NMR and HSQC (see Figure S11) spectra of 2, the farnesyl side chain included four methyls (\u03b4C 23.0, 23.0, 16.5, 16.3), four methylenes (\u03b4C 69.4, 39.9, 39.8, 26.5), five methines (\u03b4C 140.1, 126.2, 124.8, 120.8, 32.1), and two quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 143.6, 136.6), in contrast to compound 1. The 1H-1H COSY cross-peaks (Figures 2 and S12) of H2-1\u2032/H-2\u2032, H2-4\u2032/H2-5\u2032/H2-6\u2032, and H8\u2032/H-9\u2032/H-10\u2032/H-11\u2032/Me-12\u2032 (Me-13\u2032) suggested the presence of three olefinic bonds at C-2\u2032/C-3\u2032, C-7\u2032/C-8\u2032, and C-9\u2032/C-10\u2032, respectively. HMBC couplings (Figures 2 and S13) of H2-1\u2032 (\u03b4H 4.80, J = 7.3 Hz) to C-2\u2032 (\u03b4C 120.8, d) and C-3\u2032 (\u03b4C 143.6, s), H-2\u2032 (\u03b4H 5.50, td, J = 7.3, 1.2) to Me-15\u2032 (\u03b4C 16.3, q), H2-4\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.97, t, 7.4) to C-2\u2032, C-3\u2032 and Me-15\u2032, H2-5\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.47, m) to C-4\u2032 (\u03b4C 39.9, t) and C-6\u2032 (\u03b4C 39.8, t), H2-6\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.88, t, 7.5) to C-4\u2032 and Me-14\u2032 (\u03b4C 16.5, q), H-8\u2032 (\u03b4H 5.71, d, J = 10.8 Hz) to C-6\u2032 and Me-14\u2032, H-10\u2032 (\u03b4H 5.53, dd, J = 15.2, 7.1 Hz) to C-8\u2032 (\u03b4C 126.2, d), H3-12\u2032/13\u2032 (\u03b4H 0.99, d, J = 6.8 Hz) to C-10\u2032 (\u03b4C 140.1, d) and C-11\u2032 (\u03b4C 32.1, d) established the structure of the farnesyl side chain as shown in Figure 1. Moreover, HMBC correlations of 2-OH (\u03b4H 12.84, s) to C-1 (\u03b4C 137.6, s), C-2 (\u03b4C 159.5, s), and C-3 (\u03b4C 113.6, s) further confirmed the substitution positions of the phenyl ring. NOEs (see Figures 3 and S14) from H2-4\u2032 to H-2\u2032, from H-8\u2032 to H2-6\u2032, and from H-9\u2032 (\u03b4H 6.21, ddd, J = 15.1, 10.8, 1.0 Hz) to H-11\u2032 (\u03b4H 2.33, sext, J = 6.8 Hz) supported the existence of E-configurations of all the double bonds. The structure of 2 was thus determined, and the compound was named Aspersparin A. The molecular formula of compound 3 was also determined to be C23H30O5 based on its HR-ESI-MS (m/z 387.2167, (M + H)+) (see Figure S15), which indicated that it was an isomer of 1 and 2. However, the 1D-NMR spectra (see Tables 1 and 2, Figures S16 and S17) and HSQC spectrum (Figure S18) showed some differences in the farnesyl side chain. 1H-1H COSY cross-peaks (see Figures 2 and S19) of H2-1\u2032/H2-2\u2032, H-4\u2032/H2-5\u2032/H2-6\u2032, and H-8\u2032/H-9\u2032/H-10\u2032/H-11\u2032/Me-12\u2032 (Me-13\u2032) suggested the presence of three olefinic bonds at C-3\u2032/C-4\u2032, C-7\u2032/C-8\u2032, and C-9\u2032/C-10\u2032, respectively. Supported by HMBC correlations (see Figures 2 and S20) from H2-2\u2032 (\u03b4H 2.46, t, J = 7.2 Hz) to C-1\u2032 (\u03b4C 72.2, t), C-3\u2032 (\u03b4C 132.3, s), C-4\u2032 (\u03b4C 127.5, d) and Me-15\u2032 (\u03b4C 16.3, q), H-4\u2032 (\u03b4H 5.24, td, J = 6.9, 1.1 Hz) to C-6\u2032 (\u03b4C 40.7 t) and Me-15, H2-6\u2032 (\u03b4H 2.04, overlapped) to C-5\u2032 (\u03b4C 27.3, t), C-7\u2032 (\u03b4C 136.4, s), C-8\u2032 (\u03b4C 126.2, d) and Me-14\u2032 (\u03b4C 16.6, q), H-8\u2032 (\u03b4H 5.77, d, J = 10.8 Hz) to C-6\u2032 and Me-14\u2032, H-9\u2032 (\u03b4H 6.21, ddd, J = 15.1, 10.8, 1.0 Hz) to C-11\u2032 (\u03b4C 32.1, d), and H-10\u2032 (\u03b4H 5.50, dd, J = 15.1, 7.0 Hz) to C-8\u2032 and Me-12\u2032/Me-13\u2032 (\u03b4C 23.0, q), the core structure of 3 was established. NOEs (Figures 3 and S21) from H-4\u2032 to H2-2\u2032 and from H-8\u2032 to H2-6\u2032 supported the presence of E-configurations for the double bonds at C-3\u2032/C-4\u2032 and C-7\u2032/C-8\u2032. The E-configuration\nPlants 2023, 12, 203 5 of 11\nfor C-9\u2032/C-10\u2032 was verified by the coupling constant (J = 15.1 Hz) of H-9\u2032 and H-10\u2032. The structure of 3 was thus determined, and the compound was named Aspersparin B. Compound 4 had a molecular formula of C25H34O6 according to HR-ESI-MS (m/z 453.2255, (M + Na)+) (Figure S22). NMR signals (see Tables 1 and 2, Figures S23\u2013S25) of \u03b4H at 5.32 (s, H2-8) and 2.86 (s, H3-2\u201d), \u03b4C at 63.2 (t, C-8), 170.6 (s, C-1\u201d) and 20.9 (q, C-2\u201d), together with HMBC correlations (see Figures 2 and S27) of H2-8 to C-3 (\u03b4C 113.4, s), C-4 (\u03b4C 137.0, s), C-5 (\u03b4C 111.3, d), C-1\u2032\u2032, and H3-2\u2032\u2032 to C-1\u2032\u2032 revealed the presence of a \u2013CH2OCOCH3 at C-4. The farnesyl side chain of compound 4 was assumed to be identical with that of compound 2; this hypothesis was supported by almost identical 1H-, 13C-NMR chemical shifts and NOE correlations of this compound (Figure S28). Thus, the structure of 4 was determined, and the compound was named as Aspersparin C. Compound 5 was isolated as yellow crystalline powder. Its molecular formula was determined to be C22H26O5 by HR-ESI-MS (m/z 371.1856, (M + H)+) (Figure S29), which implied ten degrees of unsaturations. The 1H-NMR spectrum (Table 3, Figure S30) indicated the presence of four methyl groups (\u03b4H 2.28 (3H, s, H3-10), 1.69 (3H, s, H3-9), 1.16 (3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz, H3-9\u2032), and 0.86 (3H, t, J = 7.3 Hz, H3-8\u2032)), five sp3 methylene protons (\u03b4H 1.20~1.56 (10H, m, H2-3\u2032, 4\u2032, 5\u2032, 6\u2032, 7\u2032)), three uncoupled olefinic protons (\u03b4H 8.72 (1H, s, H-1), 6.44 (1H, s, H-4), and 5.35 (1H, s, H-5)), and one sp3 methine proton (\u03b4H 3.58 (1H, m, H-2\u2032)). The 13C-NMR (see Table 3, Figure S31) and HSQC (see Figure S32) spectra displayed the signals of four methyl carbons (\u03b4C 24.6, 17.9, 13.8 and 13.0), five aliphatic methylene carbons (\u03b4C 33.3, 28.9, 27.5, 26.3 and 22.1), one aliphatic methine carbon (\u03b4C 43.3), three olefinic methine carbons (\u03b4C 153.2, 108.1 and 103.7), one oxygenated quaternary carbon (\u03b4C 87.7), five olefinic quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 165.2, 160.3, 146.0, 124.2 and 111.1), one ester carbonyl carbon (\u03b4C 168.3), and two \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone carbonyl carbons (\u03b4C 200.7 and 191.5). Three carbonyls and eight olefinic carbons accounted for seven degrees of unsaturation. The remaining three degrees of unsaturation supported the existence of three rings. HMBC correlations (Figure S34) of H-1 to C-3 (\u03b4C 160.3), 4a (\u03b4C 146.0), 8a (\u03b4C 111.1), H-4 to C-3, 5 (\u03b4C 103.7), 8a, and H-5 to C-4 (\u03b4C 108.1), C-7 (\u03b4C 87.7), and C-8a suggested the presence of an azaphilone skeleton. Moreover, the presence of a ketone aliphatic side chain was supported by the HSQC, COSY (Figure S33) and HMBC spectra. A comparison of the 1H- and 13C-NMR data of 5 with those of didehydrochermesinone B [21] showed that the former contained four more CH2 in the fatty chain. Accordingly, the planar structure of 5 was established. The absolute configuration of 5 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. An Olex2 plot is shown in Figure 4, illustrating the absolute configuration of 5 to be 7R, 2\u2032S with Flack parameter \u20130.07 (10) (CCDC 2219385).

Of the tested compounds, Aspersparin D (5) and sydonic acid (6) exhibited moderate inhibitory activities against the growth of the roots and shoots of E. crusgalli seedlings (with inhibitory rates ranging from 40% to 60%).

            "text": "Compounds 1\u20134 were asperugin analogues which showed weak inhibitory activities against the growth of E. crusgalli and A. retroflexus seedlings at the concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL. Compounds 1\u20133 were double-bond isomers with the same structure in the phenyl part, while compound 4 had a \u2013CH2OCOCH3 located at the phenyl ring. The bioassay results showed that 4 exhibited higher inhibition on the tested weeds than compounds 1\u20133. Therefore, the substituents on the benzene ring might play an important role in the herbicidal activities of asperugin analogues. This is the first report on the herbicidal activities of asperugin analogues. These compounds may prove to be promising in the research and development of natural or plant-derived herbicides. Azaphilones are a large family of metabolites derived from fungi with variable structures, exhibiting a wide range of biological activities [22]; however, at present, there are relatively few reports about their herbicidal activities [23]. As reported in our previous study [24], Chaetomugilin O, an azaphilone with tetrahydrofuranone, exhibited the most potent inhibition among the tested azaphilones of seedling growth of several weeds. In our study, Asperaprin D (5) was identified as a new azaphilone derivative with a tetrahydrofuranone group. The compound showed moderate inhibitory activity against E. crusgalli and A. retroflexus seedlings. Based on a comparison of the structures of Chaetomugilin O and Asperaprin D (5), we speculate that the presence of a tetrahydrofuranone group may\nPlants 2023, 12, 203 8 of 11\nbe an important factor for the growth-suppression activity of azaphilones, with the side chains connected to C-3 and C-7 also influencing the inhibitory effects. In any case, further studies on the structure\u2013activity relationship and structural modifications are needed to verify this hypothesis. Previous studies have examined the antibacterial activity [25] and cytotoxic activity [26] of sydonic acid (6), a bisabolane-type sesquiterpene produced by several fungi. In the present study, sydonic acid (6) was found to have herbicidal activities, showing moderate inhibitory effects on E. crusgalli seedlings and obvious inhibitory effects on A. retroflexus seedlings. This is the first time that compounds 5 and 6 have been reported as herbicidal fungal metabolites. These findings could expand the application of these compounds in the agricultural domain and broaden our knowledge on the possible structures of natural herbicides. However, whether the compounds are useful as mycoherbicides remains to be determined by further study via pot experiments in a greenhouse and field experiments."

Culture discs with an internal diameter of 5 were made with a sterile stainless-steel puncher mm. Five culture discs were inoculated into separate 500 mL flasks containing 100 mL of seed medium each. The seed culture was shaken at 120 rpm at 28 \u25e6C. After 96 h of cultivation, seed cultures (10%) were transferred to 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL medium with the following composition: 6.25 g/L malt extract, 6.25 g/L maltose, 1.0 g/L yeast extract, 0.625 g/L soybean peptone, 1.25 g/L KH2PO4, and 1.25 g/L MgSO4. The inoculated flasks were incubated at 28 \u25e6C for 96 h on a rotary shaker (120 rpm). The fermented material (10.0 L) was extracted using ethyl acetate (3\u00d7 10.0 L) following three 30 min periods of stirring [16]. The organic solvent was filtrated and then concentrated in vacuo to obtain a crude extract (3.6 g). The ethyl acetate extract was dissolved in acetonitrile and subjected to silica gel chromatography through progressive column elution with petroleum ether (PE\u2212EtOAc (5:1\u20131:1, v/v)) to obtain five major fractions (Fr.1\u2013Fr.5).
