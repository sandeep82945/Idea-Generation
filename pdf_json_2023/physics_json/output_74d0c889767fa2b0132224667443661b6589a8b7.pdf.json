            "text": "FXIIa is the principal initiator of the plasma contact system and can activate both procoagulant and proinflammatory pathways. Its activity is important in the pathophysiology of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE). Here, we describe a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the beta-chain from FXIIa (\u03b2FXIIa) complexed with the Fab fragment of garadacimab. Garadacimab binds to \u03b2FXIIa through an unusually long CDR-H3 that inserts into the S1 pocket in a non-canonical way. This atypical structural mechanism is likely the primary contributor in the inhibition of activated FXII proteolytic activity in HAE. Garadacimab Fab-\u03b2FXIIa structure also reveals critical determinants of high-affinity binding of garadacimab to activated FXII. Structural analysis with other bonafide FXIIa inhibitors, such as benzamidine and C1-INH, reveals a conserved mechanism of \u03b2FXIIa inhibition, a novel finding of this study. In summary, garadacimab Fab-\u03b2FXIIa structure provides crucial insights into its mechanism of action and delineates primary and auxiliary paratopes/epitopes. This work reaffirms the benefits of cryo-EM as a primary tool to study antigen-antibody complexes in near native state, particularly where other methods have fallen short."

            "text": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder whereby patients experience recurring episodes of swelling attacks, often accompanied with pain. It is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening disorder that impacts 1 out of 50,000 (Zuraw, 2008). Individuals suffering from this disease often have either low levels (Type I), or normal but dysfunctional levels (Type II), of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), a critical multifunctional serine protease inhibitor. The current standard of care for HAE involves the use of both on-demand and prophylactic treatments and is achieved through C1INH replacement therapies, kallikrein inhibitors, or bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists. C1-INH is a serpin, a primary endogenous regulator of both the classical complement activation and contact systems (Conway, 2015; Davis et al., 2010), and rapidly inhibits ~95% of activated FXIIa (de Agostini et al., 1984). FXIIa serves as the central component of procoagulant and proinflammatory plasma contact system. Garadacimab is a novel fully human recombinant monoclonal antibody inhibitor of human activated Factor XII (FXIIa) that has recently completed its Phase 3 trial for the prophylactic treatment of HAE patients with C1-INH deficiency. Results from the most recent clinical trial show that garadacimab was able to significantly reduce HAE attacks in patients aged 12 years and older and had a favourable safety profile (Craig et al., 2023).\nGaradacimab is the affinity-matured version of 3F7 which was the parental antibody identified using phage display and is a potent inhibitor of FXIIa and beta-chain of activated factor XII (\u03b2FXIIa) (Cao et al., 2015). It has been previously established that the antibody recognizes \u03b2FXIIa with high specificity (Larsson et al., 2014). In human plasma, 3F7 is preferentially bound to FXIIa over zymogen (Larsson et al., 2014). The antibody garadacimab binds with high affinity to human \u03b2FXIIa (KD = 140 pM), which is a ~44-fold increment over the parental antibody (Cao et al., 2018). Binding of 3F7 to \u03b2FXIIa was enhanced through mutations in the heavy chain complementarity determining region (CDR) 2. 3F7 heavy chain CDR2 residues (GIRPSGGTTVYADSVKG) were mutated to the underlined residues GIDIPTKGTVYADSVKG in the affinity matured garadacimab antibody. The molecular determinants that led to the increase in garadacimab affinity to \u03b2FXIIa were unclear. Mutation of D60K/V97K in \u03b2FXIIa abolished 3F7 binding. This data provided early insights that 3F7 binding to \u03b2FXIIa maps near the 99-loop and 60-helix of\n\u03b2FXIIa. Therefore, it was believed 3F7 functions by blocking the \u03b2FXIIa catalytic cleft (Larsson et al., 2014).\nCritical to the understanding of the intended pharmacological effect through inhibition of FXIIa are insights into the mechanism of action (MoA) of garadacimab. To this effect, xray crystallography was employed to gain a structural understanding of garadacimab Fab\nin complex with FXIIa. While reproducible needle-like small crystals of the complex were obtained, the crystals did not diffract. This is potentially due to poor packing in the crystal lattice. Simultaneously, a hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) study to elucidate the potential binding interface of garadacimab on \u03b2FXIIa was initiated. This provided evidence that garadacimab may in fact obstruct entry of the \u03b2FXIIa S1 pocket (Ow et al., 2023). Through solvent accessibility data coupled with HDX rate, we could highlight putative residues forming the binding interface. However, a deep understanding of the overall MoA of garadacimab and its biological implications was lacking.\nIn this investigation, we report a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of \u03b2FXIIa in complex with Fab fragment of garadacimab. The structure demonstrates an atypical interaction of CDR-H3 of garadacimab with \u03b2FXIIa that inserts deep inside \u03b2FXIIa to inhibit proteolytic activity. Structural modelling provided insights into how an endogenous inhibitor (C1-INH) and a therapeutic inhibitor (garadacimab) of FXIIa adopt a conserved mechanism to block access to S1 pocket, resulting in reduced proteolytic cleavage of substrates. Structural analysis also reveals critical determinants of the high-affinity binding of garadacimab to activated FXII. Overall, this study extends and improves our understanding of garadacimab, and its MoA, as well as delineates primary and auxiliary paratopes/epitopes."

            "text": "Structural basis for the inhibition of \u03b2FXIIa by garadacimab\nTo understand the structural basis for garadacimab-mediated inhibition of \u03b2FXIIa, we sought to perform cryo-EM analysis on the recombinant human plasma clotting FXIIa in complex with the garadacimab Fab fragment. Initial cryo-EM attempts of the garadacimab Fab- \u03b2FXIIa complex resulted in very packed monolayers of particles (Fig. S3A) and poor resolution of the resulting reconstructions (data not shown). To solve this issue, we followed the lead of a study utilizing a VHH specific for the human kappa light chain to assist x-ray crystallography efforts (Ere\u00f1o-Orbea et al., 2018) and added a variable heavy-chain (VHH) domain to the garadacimab Fab- \u03b2FXIIa complex, which increased the complex's mass from ~77 to ~90 kDa (Fig. S1). Analysis of the ternary complex, concentrated to ~10 mg/ml for cryo-EM sample preparation, using SEC-MALS revealed a higher molecular weight peak that we hadn't observed before, estimated to be roughly twice the size of the monomeric complex (Fig. S2).\nSingle particle analysis (SPA) of the data revealed heterogeneity in the conformation of the garadacimab Fab-\u03b2FXIIa complex, which aligns with the SEC-MALS results. We observed three distinct garadacimab Fab-\u03b2FXIIa complexes: a C2-symmetric dimer (65%), an asymmetric dimer (8%) and an apparent monomer (27%) (Fig. S4), which were resolved to 2.6 \u00c5, 3.8 \u00c5 and 3.9 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. S4). In all cases, the interaction between the \u03b2FXIIa and garadacimab Fab was constant (Fig. 1B, S5I-J), as such, we decided to use the highest resolution reconstruction for further interpretation of the epitope-paratope interface.\nNon-uniform refinement of the C2-symmetric dimer produced a density map with a global resolution of 2.6 \u00c5 (Fig. 1A, S3), with the epitope-paratope region resolved ~2.4 \u00c5. This resolution permitted the atomic modelling of both the \u03b2FXIIa and the Fab variable domains as well as the number of ordered waters involved in the epitope interface (Fig. 1B,2). Additionally, a density consistent with a bi-antennary core fucosylated glycan was observed at the bottom of the molecule, near the \u03b2FXIIa dimerization interface (Fig. S7A). Mass spectrometry (Fig. S7B) confirmed the glycan's identity, and a fucosylated HexNac core with three mannose units was built into the density with high confidence.\nConsistent with the previous HDX-MS data (Ow et al., 2023), garadacimab inhibits \u03b2FXIIa by binding to the \u03b2FXIIa loops neighbouring the S1 catalytic pocket entrance and preventing substrate binding through steric hindrance. The binding of the garadacimab Fab to \u03b2FXIIa buries a surface area of ~1054 \u00c52, with ~700 \u00c52 from the heavy and ~355 \u00c52 from the light chain. The paratope is composed of the CDR-H2, H3, L1 and L3 loops, mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2). The resolution of the map was sufficient to visualize several water molecules which participate in the solvent-mediated H-bonding.\nA chymotrypsin-based numbering system has been used for consistency with the established literature (Dementiev et al., 2018). Accordingly, CDR-H3 residues Arg102, Tyr105, Leu106 and Ile107 interact with the \u03b2FXIIa residues Gln60, Val97, Tyr99, Ala190, Trp215 and Gly216, with Arg102 being involved in the water-coordinated H-bond network with \u03b2FXIIa residues Ser98 and Trp215 (Fig. 2A-C. CDR-H2 residue Thr55 H-bonds to Gln60 (Fig. 2D). CDR-L1 and L3 residues Arg31, Asn32, Tyr33 and Leu96 interact with \u03b2FXIIa residues Ser95, Ser98 and Gln100 (Fig. 2E. A water-mediated H-bond between CDR-H3 and CDR-L1 also stabilizes the paratope. \u03b2FXIIa dimerization interface reveals H-bonds between Gly147-Gln192 and Asp149-Tyr151 with an additional solventmediated H-bond to Phe41 (Fig. 3).\nGaradacimab possess a conserved mechanism for \u03b2FXIIa inhibition\nWhile benzamidine serves as a non-covalent inhibitor of FXIIa, C1-INH is a primary endogenous covalent inhibitor, inhibiting ~95% of FXIIa (Dementiev et al., 2018; A de Agostini et al., 1984). In the absence of high-resolution structural information, it is unclear how FXIIa and \u03b2FXIIa protease activity gets downregulated by C1-INH. Typically, serpins such as C1-INH engage with the bonafide serpin protease through insertion of the reactive center loop (RCL) into the protease and forming a covalent bond. Atypical CDRH3 loop insertion into the substrate and inhibitor binding pocket of \u03b2FXIIa shares many similarities with C1-INH mode of protease recognition. To study this, we generated a model of the active form of C1-INH in complex with \u03b2FXIIa using Alphafold multimer (Evans et al., 2022; Mirdita et al., 2022). Remarkably, the model demonstrates the placement of the RCL into the same binding pocket as CDR-H3 (Fig. 4A, S8). P1 residue (Arg444) from the RCL sequence SVARTLLV of C1-INH is known to be a critical\ndeterminant of FXIIa activity (Dementiev et al., 2018). Mutagenesis studies have shown that perturbation of Arg444 leads to complete loss of FXIIa inhibition (Eldering et al., 1992). Superposition of garadacimab Fab bound \u03b2FXIIa structure, and the benzamidine bound \u03b2FXIIa (PDB id: 6b74), on C1-INH bound \u03b2FXIIa model revealed complete overlay of guanidine group of Arg444, phenyl ring of Tyr105 and benzene ring of benzamidine. Arg444 from the RCL also mimicked salt bridge formation of Asp189-Tyr105 (garadacimab Fab-\u03b2FXIIa complex) and Asp189-aminidium group (benzamidine-\u03b2FXIIa complex) (Fig. 4A). Moreover, it has been shown that 3F7 competes with C1-INH and blunted complex formation with FXIIa (Larsson et al., 2014) . Taken together, these data highlight that garadacimab, C1-INH and benzamidine possess a conserved mechanism for inhibiting FXIIa and \u03b2FXIIa."

            "text": "Structural relevance and Improvements to mechanism of action understanding\nOur cryo-EM structure of \u03b2FXIIa in complex with garadacimab Fab presents the first example of how \u03b2FXIIa function is inhibited. The interaction of Fab with \u03b2FXIIa demonstrates an atypical antigen-antibody complex. Typically, the CDRs contact solventexposed epitope residues on the surface of the antigen. In this case, garadacimab possesses an unusually long (17 amino acids) CDR-H3 which inserts deep into the S1 pocket making interactions with residues lining the S1 pocket as well as the catalytic triad. As a result, CDR-H3 paratope residues make several interactions with \u03b2FXIIa driving most of the affinity in contrast to CDR-H2 and CDR-L1. The residues in the CDR-H3 make a series of interactions with amino acids from the S1, S2 and S3 pocket of \u03b2FXIIa such as a \u201cstring of pearls\u201d (Fig. 2A). Arg102 forms a network of hydrogen bonds with water molecules, side chain-main chain interactions with Val97. Arg102 is also oriented such that it sits on the top of the catalytic triad via a crucial stacking arrangement with Tyr99 and Trp215 of \u03b2FXIIa. Tyr105 sits tightly packed in the S1 pocket making main chain associations with Ala190, Ser195 and Gly216. Interestingly, Tyr105 also forms a hydrogen bond with Asp189 and is stacked between Ile213 and Trp215 in \u03b2FXIIa. Leu106 serves as a lid on the top of S1 pocket that Tyr105 occupies. The final \u201cpearl of the string\u201d is Tyr114 forming main chain interactions with Pro96 and Val97 (Fig. 2A). These interactions demonstrate mechanistically how CDR-H3 governs affinity towards \u03b2FXIIa and form the basis of \u03b2FXIIa inhibition.\nThe insertion of CDR-H3 into \u03b2FXIIa appears to govern tight binding and selectivity, with stabilizing interactions provided by CDR-H2 and CDR-L1. This is in line with the affinity maturation strategy of 3F7, wherein only GIRPSGGTTVYADSVKG residues in CDR-H2 were mutated to underlined residues GIDIPTKGTVYADSVKG. These changes resulted in a ~44-fold increase in affinity. The introduction of a positively charged lysine in place of glycine at position 56 in CDR-H2 appears to increase main chain-main chain interactions as well as form new hydrogen bonds between the Arg60 side chain. Importantly, reorganization of the proline by mutation of Ser54 in the parental antibody has significantly matured the affinity through stacking interaction with Pro96 of \u03b2FXIIa\n(Fig. 2A). Comparison of 3F7-\u03b2FXIIa and garadacimab-\u03b2FXIIa binding kinetics data revealed that the interactions mediated by CDR-H2 have led to a slower dissociation rate, resulting in increased affinity (Cao et al., 2018). The high-resolution cryo-EM SPA of garadacimab Fab-\u03b2FXIIa complex also provides the basis for the potent inhibition of \u03b2FXIIa by garadacimab. Initial inspection of the overlay of uncomplexed \u03b2FXIIa (PDB id: 6gt6) (Pathak et al., 2019), benzamidine bound \u03b2FXIIa (PDB id: 6b74) (Dementiev et al., 2018) and garadacimab Fab bound \u03b2FXIIa did not show any significant conformational change in the overall structure (Fig. S6). Upon close inspection, it was evident that Tyr105 from CDR-H3 forms a salt bridge with Asp189 of \u03b2FXIIa in the same manner as the benzamidine (Fig. 4B). The mode of interaction is strikingly similar such that the phenyl ring of Tyr105 overlays exactly on the benzene ring of benzamidine. This points to a \u03b2FXIIa inhibition mechanism by garadacimab that is remarkably similar to the canonical inhibitor of serine proteases. The 99-loop in the benzamidine bound, and garadacimab complexed, \u03b2FXIIa appears to be in an identical conformation, wherein Tyr99 is in a closed form rendering the S2 pocket shut (Fig. 4B). This further demonstrates a conserved inhibition mechanism of \u03b2FXIIa. On the contrary, in the uncomplexed \u03b2FXIIa structure, this loop slightly moves away from the catalytic triad revealing an open form of Tyr99. Such a movement results in the opening of the S2 pocket and partial blockage of the S3 region. Altogether, this suggests that Tyr99 potentially serves as a switch for substrate binding.\nThe interactions mapped using the cryo-EM structure of Garadacimab Fab-\u03b2FXIIa were aligned against binding interfaces identified in our recent report using HDX-MS (Ow et al., 2023). Highlighted HDX-MS interfaces on \u03b2FXIIa show very good agreement with contact regions observed in the cryo-EM structure. Specifically, we demonstrate that the interfaces neighbouring the S1 catalytic pocket entrance (e.g. 60-loop, 99-loop, 180-loop and 220-loop) overlapped with regions shown to be blocked by the CDR-H3, CDR-H2 and CDR-L1 of garadacimab (Ow et al., 2023).\nIn conclusion, our study presents a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of garadacimab Fab-\u03b2FXIIa complex that most likely reflects how garadacimab engages with activated FXII. The structural analysis provides first insights into garadacimab governed inhibition\nmechanism of FXIIa. This appears to be in line with the downregulation of FXIIa proteolytic activity by its endogenous inhibitor, C1-INH."
