    "abstractText": "This paper formulates amathematical framework to describe the dynamics of SIS-type infectious diseases with resource constraints. We first define the basic reproduction number that determines disease prevalence and analyze the existence and local stability of the equilibria. Subsequently, we analyze the global dynamics of the model, excluding periodic solutions and heteroclinic orbits, using the compound matrix approach. The analysis implies that the model can undergo forward and backward bifurcations depending on critical parameters. In the former scenario, the disease persists when the basic reproduction number under resource constraints exceeds one. In the latter scenario, the backward bifurcation creates bistability dynamics in which the disease may persist or become extinct depending on the initial level of infected individuals and the resource abundance.",

            "text": "In history, mankind has witnessed several global epidemics of infectious diseases. These infectious diseases, without exception, have brought serious threats to the safety of human life and property, and even caused a huge impact on society and the regime. Typical cases include the smallpox outbreak in Europe in the 18th century [1], the Spanish flu in 1918 [2], and the COVID-2019, which is ravaging the world [3]. The prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases has become a hot issue of global concern. Although scientists from different fields have devoted themselves to the research related to the prevention and control of infectious diseases and have achieved many remarkable results, the research related to the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is still in its infancy, and there are many important challenges to be solved urgently [4, 5].\nThe intervention of mathematical models brings a new perspective to the study of the transmission mechanism of infectious diseases [6]. Mathematical models of infectious diseases date back to the work of Daniel Bernoulli in 1760, who predicted that universal vaccination against smallpox would increase average life expectancy by more than three years [7]. In 1911, Ronald Ross was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on the transmission of malaria between mosquitoes and humans, the first time in history that differential equations were applied to the study of infectious diseases [8]. In 1926, Kermack and McKendrick [9] established the first SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) compartment model to study the spread of the Black Death in London and the plague in Mumbai. Subsequently, they established the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) compartment model in 1932 and proposed the famous threshold theory for the spread of the epidemic [10]. Since the pioneeringwork of Kermack and Mckendrick, dynamic models of infectious diseases with different propagation laws have sprung up (e.g., SIRS model, Tang et al. [11]; SEIR model, Li and Muldowney [12]; SEIRS model, Bj\u00f8rnstad et al. [13]; MSEIR model, Hethcote [14]). In this work, we focus on studying the dynamics of infectious diseases with SIS compartment structures, such as common cold, influenza and dysentery.\nHow do infectious diseases spread? What determines the extinction of infectious diseases? There is strong evidence that human factors can significantly influence the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.Mathematically, there have been numerous studies exploring the mechanisms by which anthropogenic factors influence the dynamics of infectious diseases. See, for instance, immunization, Gao et al. [15], Starnini et al. [16]; isolation, Te Vrugt et al. [17], Bolzoni et al. [18]; media coverage, Cai et al. [19]; time delay, Agaba et al. [20, 21]. It is worth pointing out that in traditional mathematical modeling research on epidemics, medical conditions are usually considered as a fixed constant. In fact, when a large-scale outbreak of infectious diseases occurs, the supply of medical resources may be insufficient, and this scenario is especially prone to occur in economically underdeveloped areas. For instance, in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, the demand for medical supplies such as masks and ventilators could not be met in some countries. Overall, it is of great practical significance to consider the impact of resource constraints on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.\nIn this paper, we develop amathematical framework based on differential equations to describe SIS infectious disease dynamics. This framework allows us to study how do resource constraints affect disease persistence and extinction through feedback on effective incidence rate. The remaining sections are arranged as follows. In Sect. 2, the disease-resource model is derived. In Sect. 3, a rigorous mathematical analysis is developed to learn the global dynamics of the disease-resource model. Sect. 4 ends the paper with a conclusion."

            "text": "A general SIS compartment model can be described by the following system of ordinary differential equations\nS\u2032 = \u2212 \u03b2SI \u2212 \u03bcS + \u03b3 I , I \u2032 = \u03b2SI \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03b3 )I , (1)\nwhere S(t) and I (t) represent the population densities of susceptible and infected individuals at time t , respectively. The parameter denotes the constant input rate of the population, and \u03b2 represents the effective incidence rate of infected individuals, reflecting the ability of infected individuals to infect susceptible individuals. \u03bc is the natural mortality rate, and \u03b3 is the removal rate of infected individuals. Since S\u2032 + I \u2032 = \u2212 \u03bc(S + I ), we can verify that the compact set\nC1 = { (S, I ) \u2208 R2+ : S + I =\n\u03bc\n}\nis positively invariant of Model (1) given S(0) + I (0) = \u03bc . Therefore, instead of Model (1), we can study the following model\nI \u2032 = \u03b2 (\n\u03bc \u2212 I\n) I \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03b3 )I . (2)\nA simple calculation shows that Model (2) has the following explicit solution\nI (t) = 1 \u03b2\n( \u03b2\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3\n) I (0)e ( \u03b2 \u03bc \u2212\u03bc\u2212\u03b3 ) t\n1 \u03b2\n( \u03b2\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3\n) + I (0) [ e ( \u03b2 \u03bc \u2212\u03bc\u2212\u03b3 ) t \u2212 1 ] .\nTherefore, the global dynamics of Model (2) can be completely determined by the critical threshold\nR0 = \u03b2 \u03bc(\u03bc + \u03b3 ) .\n1. When R0 < 1, Model (2) always has a unique disease-free equilibrium I0 = 0, which is globally asymptotically stable.\n2. When R0 > 1, the disease-free equilibrium I0 is unstable, and Model (2) has a unique endemic equilibrium I \u2217 = \u03bc+\u03b3\n\u03b2 (R0 \u2212 1), which is globally asymptotically\nstable. The abundance of resources at time t (i.e., R(t)) is determined by the inflow and outflow of resources. We assume that the inflow rate of resources depends on the total population size, with a proportionality coefficient \u03b1. The outflow of resources consists of two parts: the basic resource consumption and the disease-caused resource consumption. The basic consumption of resources is mainly attributed to susceptible individuals, and the resource consumption rate of a single susceptible individual is m1R. The resource consumption due to illness depends on the scale of infected individuals, and the resource consumption rate of a single infected person ism2R. According to common sense, the infected individuals are more urgently resource-dependent than the susceptible individuals. Therefore, we assume throughout the paper thatm2 > m1. Based on the discussion above, the dynamics of resources can be described by\nR\u2032 = \u03b1 \u03bc \u2212 m1 \u03bc R \u2212 (m2 \u2212 m1)I R. (3)\nDepending on the type of resource, there are several ways to incorporate the effect of resource abundance on disease dynamics. In this work, we consider the scenario where resource abundance (such as masks, etc.) mainly affects the effective incidence rate, and assume that\n\u03b2(R) = \u03b20 1 + pR ,\nwhere \u03b20 represents the basic effective incidence rate in the resource-free state, and the parameter p > 0 describes the effect of resource abundance on the effective incidence rate.One can also consider scenarioswhere resource abundance affects other terms. For instance, when the resource represents medical devices such as ventilators, scenarios where resource abundance mainly affects the recovery rate of infected individuals can be considered. Based on the above discussion, we obtain the SIS infectious disease model under dynamic resource constraints as follows\nI \u2032 = \u03b20 I 1 + pR\n(\n\u03bc \u2212 I\n) \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03b3 )I ,\nR\u2032 =\u03b1 \u03bc \u2212 m1 \u03bc R \u2212 (m2 \u2212 m1)I R.\n(4)\nIn the following section, we assess the impact of resource constraints on disease transmission by analyzing the global dynamics of Model (4)."

(5)\nWe can draw the following intuitive results.\n(1) Model (4) always has a unique disease-free equilibrium\nE0 = (0, R0) = ( 0, \u03b1\nm1\n) .\nIn this case, R0 = \u03b1m1 defines the base supply balance of resources in the diseasefree state I0 = 0.\n(2) Model (4) can have up to two interior equilibria\nE\u2217i = (I \u2217i , R\u2217i ) = ( I \u2217i ,\n\u03b1 \u03bc\nm1 \u03bc + (m2 \u2212 m1)I \u2217i\n) , i = 1.2,\non the compact set C2. In this case, Model (4) has no interior equilibrium. (ii) If sign[Iep] = 1 (see Fig. 1b), the quadratic function g(I ) takes the maximum\ng(Iep) = g0 + [ (m2 \u2212 m1) ( \u03bc \u03b20 \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 ) \u2212 \u03b20m1 \u03bc ]2\n4\u03b20(m2 \u2212 m1) := gmax.\nRemark 2 The quadratic function g(I ) links the resource consumption rate to the density of infected individuals. It reflects fluctuations in the rate of resource demand as the density of infected individuals and the resource consumption rate increase. Intuitively, Iep can be regarded as the critical number of infected individuals. When the critical value is exceeded, the resource consumption rate is insufficient to increase the resource demand rate. Therefore, gmax can be regarded as the maximum possible resource demand rate. The horizontal line\n\u03bc (\u03bc + \u03b3 )\u03b1 p is related to the supply rate\nof resources and the ability of resources to suppress the effective incidence rate of diseases. It can be considered as the alert resource threshold. From a biological point of view, disease outbreaks may occur when the resource demand rate is above the alert resource threshold.\nNext, we present sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence and stability of the equilibria of Model (4). To proceed, we define the critical thresholds\nR1 = \u03b20 \u03bc(\u03bc + \u03b3 ) m1 \u03b1 p + m1 and R2 = gmax \u03bc (\u03bc + \u03b3 )\u03b1 p .\nSinceR0 = \u03b20\u03bc(\u03bc+\u03b3 ) represents the expected number of cases arising directly from one case in a population in which all individuals are susceptible. Therefore, R1 denotes the number of people infected by a patient during its average illness period with the intervention of medical resources. From a biological point of view, disease outbreaks occur when R1 > 1. The value of R2 determines the maximum number of interior equilibria. Note that gmax represents the maximum possible resource demand rate, and the horizontal line\n\u03bc (\u03bc+\u03b3 )\u03b1 p denotes the alert resource threshold. Therefore, when\nR2 > 1, there is a possibility of disease outbreaks. Mathematically, sinceR1 > 1 \u21d4 g0\n\u03bc\n(\u03bc+\u03b3 )\u03b1 p , it follows that the relation R2 > R1 always holds.\nTheorem 1 The deterministic model (4) always has a disease-free equilibrium E0, and can have up to two interior equilibria E\u2217i , i = 1.2, depending on the values of R1,R2, and the sign of Iep. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence and local stability of these equilibria are listed in Table 1.\nProof Define\nf1(I , R) = \u03b20 I 1 + pR\n(\n\u03bc \u2212 I\n) \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03b3 )I ,\nf2(I , R) =\u03b1 \u03bc \u2212 m1 \u03bc\nR \u2212 (m2 \u2212 m1)I R.

Simple calculation shows that Model (4) always has a unique disease-free equilibrium E0 = (0, \u03b1m1 ). When I # = 0, solving f1(I #, R#) = 0, we can obtain that\nR# = \u03b20 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b20 I # p(\u03bc + \u03b3 ) . (8)\nSubstituting (8) into f2(I #, R#) = 0 gives\nh(I #) :=\u03b1 \u03bc \u2212 1 p(\u03bc + \u03b3 )g(I #) = 0, (9)\nwhere\ng(I ) = [ m1\n\u03bc + (m2 \u2212 m1)I\n] ( \u03b20\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b20 I\n) . (10)\nTherefore, the number of equilibria depends on the intersections of the quadratic function g(I #) and the horizontal line\n\u03bc (\u03bc + \u03b3 )\u03b1 p in the first quadrant. By direct\ncalculation, we know that the symmetry axis I = Iep of the quadratic equation g(I ) is given by\nIep = (m2 \u2212 m1)\n( \u03bc \u03b20 \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 )\n\u2212 \u03b20m1 \u03bc 2\u03b20(m2 \u2212 m1) .\nNow, we can divide the discussion into the following cases. 1. When the symmetry axis Iep of the quadratic equation g(I ) is less than 0, i.e., sign[Iep] = \u22121, the quadratic equation g(I ) takes the maximum\ng(0) = m1 \u03bc\n( \u03b20\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3\n) .\nTherefore,Model (4) can have zero or one interior equilibrium (see Fig. 1a), depending on the ratio of\nR1 = m1\u03b20 \u03bc\n(\u03bc + \u03b3 )(\u03b1 p + m1) .\n(1) IfR1 \u2264 1, Model (4) has no interior equilibrium; (2) IfR1 > 1, Model (4) has a unique interior equilibrium E\u22172 . 2. When sign[Iep] = 1, the quadratic equation g(I #) takes the maximum\ngmax = g(Iep) = g(0) + [ (m2 \u2212 m1) ( \u03bc \u03b20 \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 ) \u2212 \u03b20m1 \u03bc ]2\n4\u03b20(m2 \u2212 m1) .\nIn this case, Model (4) can have up to two interior equilibria (see Fig. 1b), depending on the ratios of\nR1 = m1\u03b20 \u03bc (\u03bc + \u03b3 )(\u03b1 p + m1) and R2 = gmax\n\u03bc\n(\u03bc + \u03b3 )\u03b1 p .\n(1) IfR1 < 1 and R2 > 1, Model (4) has two interior equilibria E\u22171 and E\u22172 ; (2) IfR1 > 1, Model (4) has a unique interior equilibrium; (3) IfR2 < 1, Model (4) has no interior equilibrium.\nNext, we analyze the stability of the disease-free equilibrium E0 = (0, R0) = (0, \u03b1m1 ). By direct calculation, the Jacobian matrix of Model (4) at the disease-free equilibrium E0 can be obtained as\nJE0 = [ \u03b20 1+pR0 \u03bc\n\u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 0 \u2212(m2 \u2212 m1)R0 \u2212m1 \u03bc\n] . (11)\nThe two eigenroots of Model (4) at E0 are\n\u03bb1 = \u2212m1 \u03bc < 0\nand\n\u03bb2 = \u03b20m1 m1 + p\u03b1 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 < 0.\nTherefore, the disease-free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable provided\nR1 = \u03b20 \u03bc \u03bc + \u03b3 m1 m1 + p\u03b1 < 1.\nIn the following, we analyze the stability of the positive equilibria E\u2217i , i = 1, 2.

Based on the above discussion, we have the following results:\n(1) When Model (4) has a unique interior equilibrium E\u22172 = (I \u22172 , R\u22172), since g\u2032(I \u22172 ) < 0, we know that the interior equilibrium E\u22172 is locally asymptotically stable. (1) When Model (4) has two interior equilibria E\u2217i = (I \u2217i , R\u2217i ), i = 1, 2, since g\u2032(I \u22171 ) > 0 and g\u2032(I \u22172 ) < 0, we know that the interior equilibrium E\u22171 is unstable and the interior equilibrium E\u22172 is locally asymptotically stable.\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1. Remark 3 Theorem 1 suggests that the local stability of disease-free equilibrium E0 is completely determined by R1. In addition, the number of epidemic equilibria is determined byR1,R2 and sign[Ie p]."

IfR1 > 1, the unique interior equilibrium E\u22172 of Model (4) is globally asymptotically stable. In this scenario, the disease will persist. (1) Extinction.

In this scenario, the extinction of the disease depends on the initial population size and resource reserves.\nProof Since Pioncare-Bendixson property holds for Model (4), we only need to verify the nonexistence of nontrivial periodic orbit and heteroclinic orbit in IntR2+. If this is not the case, define the Euclidean ball as U \u2282 R2, where U\u0304 and \u2202U are the closure and boundary of the Euclidean ballU . Let V be the basin of attraction of E\u22172 in IntR2+, V\u0304 the closure of V in IntR2+. Then it follows from Index Theory for 2-dimensional system [22] that there exists a simple closed rectifiable curve \u03d5 \u2208 Lip(\u2202U \u2192 V\u0304) in V\u0304 , which is invariant with respect to Model (4). Denote\n\u03d2(\u03d5,V) = {\u03c6 \u2208 Lip(U \u2192 V) : \u03c6(\u2202U ) = \u03d5(\u2202U )}.\nThen \u03d2(\u03d5,V) is nonempty.

Since E0 /\u2208 V and any positive orbit from an initial point in R2+ but not in the positive R\u2212axis will enter IntR2+, it follows that there exists a constant > 0 such that\nlim inf t\u2192+\u221e I (t) > , lim inft\u2192+\u221e R(t) >\nif the initial points lie in V .

It then follows that\np\u03c6t = \u222b U | \u2202\u03c6t \u2202w1 \u2227 \u2202\u03c6t \u2202w2 |\n\u2264 \u222b U | \u2202\u03c6 \u2202w1 \u2227 \u2202\u03c6 \u2202w2 | exp (\u222b t 0 Df [2](x(s, \u03c6))ds) )\n\u2264p\u03c6 exp (\n\u2212m1 2\u03bc t\n) .\nTherefore, P\u03c6t \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. This contradicts the fact that P\u03c6 \u2265 \u03b4 for all \u03d2(\u03d5,V) such that \u03c6(U ) \u2282 since \u03d5 is invariant with respect toModel (4), and \u03c6t (U ) \u2282 for all sufficiently large t . This contradiction implies that no simple closed rectifiable curve in V is invariant with respect to Model (4). In particular, it rules out not only nontrivial periodic oribits but also homoclinic and heteroclinic loops since each case gives rise to a simple closed rectifiable curve in V . This completes the proof of Theorem 2. Remark 4 Theorem 2 shows that there are no nontrivial periodic orbit or heteroclinic orbit in Model (4). Therefore, the global dynamics of Model (4) is completely determined by R1,R2 and sign[Ie p]: (i) If sign[Ie p] = \u22121, then Model (4) undergoes a forward bifurcation as R1 passes through 1 from the left. During this process, the\ndisease-free equilibrium E0 changes from stable to unstable, and a stable endemic equilibrium E2 appears (see Fig. 2a). (ii) If sign[Ie p] = 1, then Model (4) undergoes a backward bifurcation as R1 passes through 1 from the right, where Model (4) can have bistability. Moreover, Model (4) undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation at R\u221212 (see Fig. 2b)."

            "text": "We provide a mathematical model to describe disease transmission dynamics under resource constraints. The effect of resource constraints is described by the reduction in effective incidence rate, which is expressed as a nonlinear function \u03b201+pR , where p represents the inhibitory strength of the unit resource on the effective incidence of the disease. We first verify the positive invariant set of the model, and then present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and local stability of the equilibria. Finally, by excluding the nontrivial periodic orbit and heteroclinic orbit, we obtain the global stability of the equilibria. Specifically, the global dynamics of the deterministic model (4) can be summarized as follows\n(1) Under the intervention of medical resources, if a patient is able to infect more than one person during the average illness, i.e.,R1 > 1, the disease will persist. (1) If the critical number of infected individuals is large enough (i.e., sign[Iep] = 1), the maximum possible resource demand rate is greater than the effective supply rate of the resource (i.e.,R2 > 1) andR1 < 1, then the disease is either persistent at high the level or extinct, depending on the initial level of the infected individuals and the resource abundance. (1) If either sign[Iep] = \u22121,R1 < 1 or sign[Iep] = 1,R2 < 1 holds, the disease will become extinct.\nAlong with the above insights, the theoretical framework has some limitations. It is well known that the spatial distribution of diseases can be non-uniform. Therefore\nincorporating spatial heterogeneity into the proposed framework would be an interesting topic. Furthermore, environmental stochasticity has been widely incorporated into various biological systems (e.g., epidemic and population systems [19, 26, 27]). While we provide a full picture of the dynamics of the SIS infectious disease model under resource constraints, we do not incorporate possible consequences of environmental stochasticity. Evaluating how environmental stochasticity, in conjunction with resource constraints, affects SIS infectious disease dynamics will be future work.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to express gratitude to the reviewers for managing the concentrated target and duration required to review this manuscript.
