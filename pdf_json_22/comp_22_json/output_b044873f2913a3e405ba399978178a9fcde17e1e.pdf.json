We demonstrate that absolute magnitudes, spectral types, and spectral indices can be determined from low-resolution SpeX prism spectra of L and T dwarfs without trigonometric parallax measurements and with precisions competitive with commonly usedmethods. For T dwarfs with sufficiently precise spectra and photometry, bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures can be determined at precisions comparable to methods that use polynomial relations as a function of absolute magnitudes. We also provide new and updated polynomial relations for absolute magnitudes as a function of spectral types L0\u2013T8 in 14 bands spanning Pan-STARRS rP1 to AllWISEW3, using a volume-limited sample of 256 brown dwarfs defined entirely by parallaxes. These include the first relations for brown dwarfs using Pan-STARRS1 photometry and the first for several infrared bands using a volume-limited sample. We find that our novel method with The Cannon can infer absolute magnitudes with equal or smaller uncertainties than the polynomial relations that depend on trigonometric parallax measurements.",

            "text": "Brown dwarfs are self-gravitating objects more massive than planets (&13 \ud835\udc40Jup; Spiegel et al. 2011) whose central temperatures and densities are not sufficient for hydrogen fusion to occur (.70 \ud835\udc40Jup; Dupuy&Liu 2017). These faint, substellar objects cool continuously as they age through L (\u22482000 K), T (\u22481000 K), and Y (\u2248300 K) spectral types. Spectroscopic analysis provides a useful tool for classification of brown dwarfs and is crucial for discerning their physical properties such as luminosity, temperature, and surface gravity. However, determining these parameters is complicated by their evolution through cooler temperatures and the challenges associated with characterizing precise atmospheric properties from spectra, limiting the information we can extract from modelling and fitting techniques. Absolute magnitudes of brown dwarfs are also essential data for constraining andmodelling evolution and physical properties, and for flux-calibrating spectra. However, absolute magnitudes require distance measurements that are observationally expensive for the many brown dwarfs that are too faint and red for Gaia (Best et al. 2020). A more efficient method to determine absolute magnitudes is to use empirical relationships with spectral types calibrated by objects with existing parallax measurements (e.g., Dupuy & Liu 2012; Faherty et al. 2016; Kirkpatrick et al. 2021). (In this paper, \u201cparallax\u201d refers to trigonometric parallax.) In Section 2 we present updated polynomial relations between spectral type and absolute magnitude based\n\u2605 E-mail: sjfeeser@utexas.edu \u2020 E-mail: wbest@utexas.edu\non a volume-limited sample in 14 bands. These include the first determined for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) 3\ud835\udf0b Survey (hereinafter PS1; Chambers et al. 2021) photometry and the first using a volume-limited sample for the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006) photometric system in \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udc3e bands, \ud835\udc4c and \ud835\udc3e bands for the Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) photometric system (Simons & Tokunaga 2002; Tokunaga et al. 2002), and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (AllWISE; Wright et al. 2010) photometric system. Spectral types, however, are heterogeneously determined and do not capture subtle differences in spectral features between objects, limiting the accuracy of these polynomial relations. Machine learning has been used in astronomical research as a tool to process, analyse, and extract new information from large amounts of data (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2014). For example, machine learning models such as The Cannon (Ness et al. 2015; Ho et al. 2017a) have been utilized to infer stellar parameters and abundances from spectroscopic data. These models employ \u201cstellar labels\u201d (i.e. measured quantities) from reference stars to infer unknown labels for a new sample of objects. Previous applications of The Cannon have used reliable measurements of physical quantities such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical abundances (Casey et al. 2017; Behmard et al. 2019), but any \u201cknown\u201d labels could be used to acquire new information from the spectrum of an object. Proven to work well at low signal-to-noise, The Cannon could become an effective means of obtaining new information from the spectra of brown dwarfs. (We note also that Aganze et al. 2021 recently used alternative machine learning methods to identify late-M, L, and T dwarfs in large, low-resolution spectroscopic surveys.

Starting with a sample of over 1200 L, T, and Y dwarfs with parallax measurements and PS1,MKO, 2MASS, and/or AllWISE photometry compiled from the literature, we extracted objects with declinations \u221230\u00b0 \u2264 \ud835\udeff \u2264 60\u00b0 and parallaxdetermined distances less than 25 pc, replicating the volume-limited sample of Best et al. (2021) but also including brown dwarfs with spectral types T8.5\u2013Y1. Brown dwarfs with ages .200Myr are still undergoing significant contraction and will exhibit inflated radii when compared to older brown dwarfs (Burrows et al. 1997). These young objects will therefore have relatively low surface gravity and photospheric pressure, causing them to differ spectroscopically and photometrically from field dwarfs (e.g., Liu et al. 2016). Older objects with lower metallicities will also differ from field objects, appearing bluer (Kirkpatrick et al. 2008). Therefore, we removed any object classified as young or a subdwarf by Best et al. (2021). Unresolved binaries that blend the spectra of two object can exhibit unusual spectroscopic features (e.g., Burgasser et al. 2010), so we also excluded known binaries, as well as objects that have not been confirmed as single using high-angular resolution imaging. Objects with spectral types indicating peculiarities or unusually blue or red colours were additionally excluded. Tables 1, 2, and 3 show the volume-limited sample and photometry we used. The numerical spectral type (SpT) represents the adopted value used for the analysis, with L0 = 10 and Y1 = 31. We used optical spectral types for L dwarfs when available and near-infrared (NIR) otherwise;NIR spectral typeswere adopted for T andYdwarfs. The final volume-limited sample contains 256 field objects; not all objects had photometry in all bands we analysed. For each band, we selected objects with parallax uncertainties \u226420 per cent and absolute magnitude uncertainties < 0.2mag. Some bluer bands, primarily \ud835\udc5fP1 and \ud835\udc56P1, have limited samples at later spectral types which restricted our analysis in these ranges."

Both methods produced visually reasonable fits with no major outliers in all bands. We then used the Monte Carlo approach of Dupuy & Liu (2012), re-sampling normally distributed absolute magnitude errors and uniformly distributed spectral type errors (between their quoted limits) to obtain 104 re-sampled points for each object. This approach allows us to account for the uncertainties of both absolute magnitudes and spectral type, the latter assumed to be \u00b11 unless indicated otherwise. With each data point randomly sampled about its respective uncertainties, we then performed a least-squares fit to\nall of the re-sampled points and obtained a final \ud835\udc5bth degree polynomial function for each band. We used the same degree for the MKO, 2MASS, and AllWISE polynomials as in Dupuy & Liu (2012): sixth degree polynomials for all MKO bands, \ud835\udc3d2M and \ud835\udc3b2M, and fourth degree for \ud835\udc3e2M and all AllWISE bands. The PS1 bands had not been fit previously; we used sixth degree polynomials for \ud835\udc67P1 and \ud835\udc66P1 bands, fourth degree for \ud835\udc56P1 band, and second degree for \ud835\udc5fP1 band.

Higher order functions produced nominal changes in the RMS about fits, and led to over-fitting in some cases."

In \ud835\udc3bMKO, \ud835\udc3b2M, \ud835\udc67P1, and \ud835\udc66P1 bands there is a more gradual decline or plateau in absolute magnitude through the L/T transition. This prominent feature corresponds to the evolution of condensate clouds in the photospheres of late-L dwarfs as they age and cool into T dwarfs, whose photospheres are relatively cloud-free. One explanation for this is the \u201cpatchy clouds\u201d model that suggests the disruption of clouds at \ud835\udc47eff \u2248 1200 K allows for hotter flux from cloud-free regions to dominate the total emitted flux (Ackerman & Marley 2001; Burgasser et al. 2002b). Another hypothesis, the \u201csudden downpour\u201d model, suggests that the rapid increase in efficiency of sedimentation causes the dusty clouds to condense out around \ud835\udc47eff \u2248 1300 K (Knapp et al. 2004)."

Figures 4 and 5 compare our polynomial relations to previously relations from Dupuy & Liu (2012), Faherty et al. (2016), and Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) for the MKO, 2MASS, and AllWISE bands. Since the fits of Dupuy & Liu (2012) and Faherty et al. (2016) do not use a volume-limited sample, our updated relations now provide a more robust standard for brown dwarf absolute magnitudes as a function of spectral type. The recent polynomials of Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) utilize a different volume-limited sample within 20 parsecs, but only for \ud835\udc3dMKO and \ud835\udc3b bands and mid-infrared Spitzer/IRAC bands. Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) furthermore take \ud835\udc3b band to be invariant across the MKO and 2MASS systems and combines them into a single polynomial, whereas we have determined independent fits for MKO and 2MASS \ud835\udc3b-band photometry.\nForMKO bands, our fits are consistent with the relations of Dupuy & Liu (2012) and Kirkpatrick et al. (2021). We find no significant difference at the L/T transition, and any variation at L and late-T spectral types are within 0.3 mag of Dupuy & Liu (2012). The Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) \ud835\udc3dMKO and \ud835\udc3b relations appear \u22480.5 mag brighter than ours for spectral types L2\u2013L8, possibly due to their inclusion\nof brighter mid-L outliers. Differences at late-T and early-Y spectral types for these bands may be accounted for by the presence of additional Y dwarfs in the all-sky volume-limited sample of Kirkpatrick et al. (2021). In general, detection of late-T dwarfs and early-Y dwarfs is limited to . 20 pc so our deeper, narrower sample contains fewer of these very faint objects. For 2MASS bands, we find our fits are consistent with previous work for early to mid-L (L0\u2013L7) and mid to late-T dwarfs (T5\u2013T8). We note some differences at the L/T transition, especially in \ud835\udc3d-band. For spectral types L8\u2013T4, our fit has a sharper increase in the \ud835\udc3d-band flux than Dupuy & Liu (2012), appears \u22480.5 mag brighter than Faherty et al. (2016), and occurs \u22481\u20132 spectral subtypes earlier than both. For AllWISE bands, our updated fits based on a volume-limited sample are very consistent with the polynomial relations of Dupuy & Liu (2012) and Faherty et al. (2016).\n3 MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WITH The Cannon\nThe Cannon is a data-driven approach designed to determine physical parameters, referred to as \u201cstellar labels\u201d, of stars from spectroscopic data (Ness et al. 2015; Ho et al. 2017a). Using known labels (i.e., any measured quantity such as effective temperature, surface gravity, or\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201322 (2022)\nelemental abundances) from a training set of stars,The Cannon develops a generative \u201cspectral model\u201d from their continuum-normalized spectra. The model assumes that stars with identical labels have similar spectra and the spectrum of each object is a smooth function of the labels that describe the object (Ho et al. 2017a). Models generated by The Cannon do not rely on physical models of the spectra, nor do they require accurate spectral types, which are heterogeneously determined and do not convey subtle differences in the spectral features that are unique to certain objects (e.g., peculiar objects). Furthermore, The Cannon can infer information directly from the spectra. Previous applications of The Cannon have derived stellar labels from spectra in the context of large, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys like APOGEE and LAMOST (Ness et al. 2015, 2016; Hogg et al. 2016; Ho et al. 2017a,b). It also has been shown to work efficiently and effectively on objects at lower signal-to-noise (20 . S/N . 50) with comparable accuracy to other physics-based approaches (Ness et al. 2015). Proven to work well with stellar surveys, The Cannon has not been evaluated for substellar objects like brown dwarfs. There are significant differences between the spectra of brown dwarfs and the stars used in previous applications of The Cannon; in particular, the prevalence of broad molecular absorption bands and (in most cases) the much lower resolution in brown dwarf spectra. Here we present our investigation into The Cannon\u2019s potential to infer physical properties of brown dwarfs, its limitations, and future possibilities for its use. We explore the application of The Cannon and verify its methodology with low-resolution brown dwarf spectra, beginning with a simple model and successively adding to\nits complexity. Our main goal in this paper is to provide a proof of concept, demonstrating that physical properties can be inferred by The Cannon from low-resolution spectra containing broad molecular absorption bands. We do not examine all possible models or determine the most optimal model, but our results suggest how The Cannon might most successfully be implemented."

Briefly, given a training set of spectra (hereinafter the reference set with associated reference labels), The Cannon performs a training step that generates the spectral model \ud835\udc54 described by\n\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 = \ud835\udc54(\u2113\ud835\udc8f |\ud835\udf3d\ud835\udf40) + noise (1)\nwhere \ud835\udf3d\ud835\udf40 is a coefficient vector, \u2113\ud835\udc8f is a label vector, and \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 is the flux at each flux element. The noise takes into account the intrinsic scatter of the model and the uncertainty associated with the flux at each wavelength. In this training step, The Cannon utilizes the labels of the reference set to predict the flux at each wavelength and determine optimal coefficients for the spectral model. That model is then used to infer labels (known as survey labels) from a set of survey objects (called the survey set) in what is known as the test step. In this test step, The Cannon uses the spectral model, with coefficients \ud835\udf3d\ud835\udf40 determined in the training step, to optimize the labels of the survey set. In practice, the reference objects and survey objects will be different. For our investigation, the reference and survey sets were the same, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of The Cannon in analyzing the spectra of brown dwarfs. Additionally, the reference set used to train The Cannon should ideally be higher in S/N than the survey set, and it has been demonstrated that The Cannon can adequately transfer labels from high S/N reference objects to lower S/N survey objects (Ness et al. 2015). To use The Cannon, the spectra need to meet the requirements outlined by Ness et al. (2015). All spectra must come from the same telescope and reduction pipeline, and their labels must come from consistent sources.Any labels (i.e. any physical quantity of the object) can be included so long as they meet this condition. The spectra (for both reference and survey sets) must be normalized in a consistent manner that is independent of S/N, be radial velocity aligned, be sampled onto a common rest-frame wavelength grid, and have the same line-spread function. Finally, each flux value must have an associated error (or inverse variance)."

To do this, The Cannon performs a \u201cpseudo-continuum normalization\u201d process in which continuum pixels are defined as pixels whose normalized flux values are consistently close to 1 for all training spectra and vary minimally with changes in the label values. These pixels are identified using a\n1 http://pono.ucsd.edu/~adam/browndwarfs/splat/\nrunning quantile of the spectra for user-specified wavelength ranges that are known to not be strongly affected by absorption features. Once these pixels are determined, The Cannon applies a continuum mask based on a fraction of the continuum pixels. For our data sets, we used label-dependent regions of the spectra (typically \ud835\udc3d, \ud835\udc3b, and \ud835\udc3e bands) to generate our models, and we chose 4\u20139 per cent of a running upper quantile (90th percentile) of the pixels in these regions as continuum pixels to be used for the continuum mask We then fit the continuum using an N-th order sinusoid or Chebyshev function. We note that the performance of The Cannon greatly relies on the manner in which the spectra is Cannon-normalized. We describe the specific choices we made for each model we tested in Section 3.2. Since The Cannon relies on the continuum normalization of the set, and brown dwarf spectra have little to no absorption-free regions, it proved challenging to determine the most appropriate application of this pseudo-continuum normalization step for our data sets. We learned that adjustments are necessary for an improved continuum mask and satisfactory fit, depending on the labels used and the objects in the reference set. We found the most appropriate method was typically to treat the \ud835\udc3d, \ud835\udc3b, and \ud835\udc3e bands as three distinct spectral regions for The Cannon to normalize separately. Overall, it is important to specify wavelength ranges to which the labels are correlated. For example, if photometry measurements are used as labels, the wavelength ranges for these bands should be included in the continuummasking steps.We determined the best values for the parameters described here through repetitive trials, checking the normalization plots and identified continuum pixels in each case."

(2015) and Dupuy & Liu (2017) that we used to determine the \ud835\udc47eff and log \ud835\udc3f reference labels, respectively.We included only objects with parallax uncertainty \u226420 per cent for a final set of 390 L and T dwarfs. We used this same set for the survey set as well, to evaluate the quality of the label transfer. Figure 7 shows diagnostic plots for this set comparing each label. We note the expected trends between \ud835\udc47eff , SpT , and log \ud835\udc3f: decreasing effective temperature and bolometric luminosity with increasing spectral type (early-L to late-T dwarfs) and the strong positive correlation of \ud835\udc47eff and log \ud835\udc3f. To identify the continuum pixels we used a 90th percentile cutoff across three wavelength regions: 1.10\u20131.35 \ud835\udf07m, 1.50\u20131.80 \ud835\udf07m, and 2.0\u20132.35 \ud835\udf07m. The ranges contain important label-dependent information in the \ud835\udc3d, \ud835\udc3b, and \ud835\udc3e bands while largely avoiding the H2O absorption features at \u223c1.4 \ud835\udf07m and \u223c1.9 \ud835\udf07m. 6 per cent of the pixels were identified for the continuum mask, which we fit with a second-order sinusoid function. Figure 7 can be used to visually assess the performance of the model. Comparing these diagnostic plots for the reference and survey sets, we see that the correlations between the reference labels are reproduced well in the inferred survey labels. Figure 8 compares the reference labels to the inferred survey labels for each object. The quality of the label transfer can be assessed by the scatter (i.e., RMS) and bias (i.e., offset) with respect to the equality (i.e., \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc66) line. These values are provided in Table 5 for each model. In general, The Cannon infers greater values (i.e., higher \ud835\udc47eff and log \ud835\udc3f, later\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201322 (2022)\nspectral type) for the survey labels than the corresponding reference values for this \ud835\udc401 model. We can compare these to the systematic uncertainties of the reference labels: 29 K for \ud835\udc47eff (Filippazzo et al. 2015), 0.05 dex for log \ud835\udc3f (Dupuy & Liu 2017), and (typically) 1 for spectral type classification. The uncertainty of the SpT label in The Cannon models is comparable to that of other spectral classification methods (e.g., Burgasser et al. 2010; Allers & Liu 2013), indicating that this model could be used as a tool to constrain the spectral types of brown dwarfs across broad surveys. (We note that specifying a single broad wavelength range across 1.1\u20132.3 \ud835\udf07m for continuum normalization decreases the scatter of the label transfer for \ud835\udc47eff and log \ud835\udc3f, but increases it for SpT by \u223c 0.3.) Overall, this model infers more accurate labels for T dwarfs than L dwarfs. This likely arises from the dramatic changes in spectral morphology that occur across types T0\u2013T8 (e.g., Kirkpatrick 2005), allowing The Cannon to more easily detect prominent features such as the shape of flux peaks and band strengths and determine more accurate label values, even at lower spectral resolution."

We used reference spectra from the same initial set of L and T dwarfs as in Section 3.2.1, this time extracting objects with absolute magnitude errors <0.2 mag in each band and parallax uncertainties \u226420 per cent for a final set of 339 objects.

This suggests that excluding H2O features in the pseudo-continuum normalization process may remove informative pixels whose flux correlates with the \ud835\udc3d, \ud835\udc3b, or \ud835\udc3e photometry labels, or that the overall spectral slope similarly correlates with the photometry.

            "text": "Spectral types, while useful labels for stellar and substellar classification, may not be as useful for The Cannon to model and infer from the spectra of brown dwarfs. The Cannonwas designed to work with labels that vary continuously with changes in flux in the spectroscopic pixels, whereas spectral types are typically discrete values determined by visually comparing spectroscopic features to a spectral standard. An alternative classification method utilizes spectral indices which are readily calculated from the flux in specified wavelength ranges and can identify differences between spectra that track with spectral types but using continuous variables (e.g., Burgasser et al. 2006). Such indices can also indicate binarity and unusual surface gravity (Allers et al. 2007; Allers & Liu 2013; Burgasser et al. 2010; Bardalez Gagliuffi et al. 2014). We therefore constructed a new Cannon model replacing spectral types with spectral indices. We extracted 338 L and T dwarfs, using the same absolute magnitude and parallax uncertainty cutoffs as in the \ud835\udc402 model but now replacing spectral types with three SpTsensitive indices for labels: \ud835\udc3b2\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3d , \ud835\udc3b2\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3b , and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3b4\ud835\udc3e (Burgasser et al. 2006). We used 0.90\u20131.40 \ud835\udf07m, 1.50\u20131.79 \ud835\udf07m, and 1.99\u20132.35 \ud835\udf07maswavelength regions for the continuummask, utilizing 6 per cent of all pixels and a first-order sinusoid function.\nIn addition to using the full reference set as the survey set (model \ud835\udc403; Figure 10), we also ran this model with survey sets of L0\u2013 L8 dwarfs and L8\u2013T8.5 dwarfs (models \ud835\udc403\ud835\udc3f and \ud835\udc403\ud835\udc47 ; Figure 11), in order to separately evaluate the model\u2019s performance on L and T dwarfs. The scatter and bias for each label are provided in Table 5 for all three models. We note a decrease in the scatter and bias for all labels with respect to the previous models that used numerical SpT as labels, indicating that The Cannon infers labels with higher fidelity when given spectral indices rather than spectral types as labels. The inferred \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3eMKO for both the \ud835\udc403\ud835\udc3f and \ud835\udc403\ud835\udc47 survey sets have a lower RMS than the total RMS of our polynomial fits (Section 2). It is clear that The Cannon determines more accurate labels for T dwarfs than L dwarfs, as the scatter for the L dwarf survey set in each label is two or three times greater than for the corresponding label in the T dwarf survey set."

We used the same labels as for the \ud835\udc403 model. We used 0.90\u20131.10\ud835\udf07m, 1.10\u20131.4 \ud835\udf07m, 1.50\u20131.79 \ud835\udf07m, and 1.99\u20132.35 \ud835\udf07m as wavelength regions for the continuum mask, now identifying \ud835\udc4c band as a distinct region. The T-dwarf model, \ud835\udc404\ud835\udc47 , contained 109 objects with spectral types L8\u2013T8.5 (inclusive), including the L8 and L9 dwarfs at the warm end of the L/T transition. Due to the limited number of T dwarfs with precise 2MASS photometry measurements, we excluded \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3e2M as labels for this \ud835\udc404\ud835\udc47 model.

This indicates that separating L and T dwarfs in the reference set and utilizing spectral indices rather than spectral types produces the most accurate models\nwith The Cannon. This also shows that The Cannon can effectively transfer labels from reference sets as small as \u2248100 objects, and that the modest S/N of the T dwarf spectra (typically 20\u201350) is not an impediment. Notably, the \ud835\udc404\ud835\udc3f model produces labels for L dwarfs with higher RMS and bias, even though the L dwarf reference set is larger and the S/N are typically higher than in the T dwarf reference set.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201322 (2022)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201322 (2022)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201322 (2022)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201322 (2022)"

We identified 10 such objects, most of which are L0 dwarfs with no unusual spectral features or other properties noted in the literature. We suspect that The Cannon is returning less accurate survey labels for these objects because the lie near the edges of our reference label spaces. Three objects do have unusual properties which we discuss here.\n2MASSI J0859254\u2212194926: This object is categorized as an optical L6 dwarf by Cruz et al. (2003, adopted by us) and a NIR L8\u00b12 dwarf by Thompson et al. (2013). It is a faint outlier in absolute magnitude for an L6 dwarf in 2MASS and WISE bands (Figure 2). The Cannon models that include SpT as a label return inferred values that are 1.2\u20132 spectral types greater than the reference value. We conclude that this object is best classified as an L8 dwarf.\nDENIS J1707252\u2212013809: This L2 dwarf (Mart\u00edn et al. 2010) is a weak binary candidate whose spectrum best fits components with L0.7 and T4.3 spectral types (Bardalez Gagliuffi et al. 2014). The Cannon models that use both L and T dwarfs in the reference set infer values for \ud835\udc47eff , log \ud835\udc3f, and photometry labels more than 2\ud835\udf0e cooler and fainter than the reference label space, and The Cannon models that include SpT as a label return inferred values that are 1.5\u2013 2 spectral subtypes cooler than the reference value. However, when the reference set is restricted to L dwarfs, the inferred labels are consistent with reference labels. Including T dwarfs in the reference set could allow The Cannon to identify spectroscopic features that correspond to lower temperatures and fainter magnitudes.\nSDSS J104409.43+042937.6: This object is \u22480.4 mag overluminous for its L7 spectral type (Knapp et al. 2004) in the near-infrared photometric bands when compared to its parallax-derived distance.

The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx; Crill et al. 2020) spacecraft, currently scheduled for launch in 2025, will survey the sky at wavelengths 0.75 < \ud835\udf06 < 5.0 \ud835\udf07m. For near-IR wavelengths (0.75 < \ud835\udf06 < 2.4 \ud835\udf07m), the spectral resolution will be \ud835\udc45 = 41 (Dor\u00e9 et al. 2014), about half that of the SpeX prism spectra we have analysed in this work. To simulate SPHEREx spectra, we removed every other element (i.e., 220 of the 440 elements) from the wavelength grid of the same \ud835\udc45 \u223c 75 spectrum we used in Section 3.1.1, re-interpolated the spectra onto this grid to obtain \ud835\udc45 \u223c 40, and reevaluated The Cannon models described in Section 3.2. For each model, we used the same labels, reference sets, and applied the same continuum estimation (i.e., wavelength ranges and percentile cutoffs) as described previously. The identified continuum pixels were fit using a first-order sinusoid function. When comparing the \ud835\udc45 \u223c 40 spectra models to their respective \ud835\udc45 \u223c 75 spectra models (The Cannon \ud835\udc401, \ud835\udc402, \ud835\udc403) all models that used the lower resolution spectra in the reference set resulted in an increase in scatter for \ud835\udc47eff\n(5 to 8 per cent), log \ud835\udc3f (4 to 8 per cent), and \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc42 and 2\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46 photometry (2 to 9 per cent).

Using lower resolution spectra in the\ud835\udc404\ud835\udc3f model, L0\u2013L8 dwarfs reference set, increases the scatter 18 to 23 per cent for\ud835\udc47eff , log \ud835\udc3f, and all \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc42 and 2\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46 bands. For the \ud835\udc404\ud835\udc47 model, L8\u2013T8.5 dwarfs reference set, we note a 5 to 8 per cent decrease in the scatter for \ud835\udc47eff and log \ud835\udc3f, no change for \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc42 and \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc42 photometry labels, and a 3 per cent increase in scatter for the \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc42 label. The Cannon can determine labels for L dwarfswith lower precision, but infers physical properties for T dwarfs at the same or slightly greater precision.

            "text": "We have demonstrated that the machine learning tool The Cannon can be used to accurately infer physical quantities (\u201clabels\u201d) such as effective temperature, photometry, and bolometric luminosity from low-resolution (\ud835\udc45\u223c75) SpeX prism spectra of L and T dwarfs. Previous applications of The Cannon have analysed high-resolution spectra of stars that could be consistently normalized to a continuum. We have proven that physical information can similarly be extracted from the spectra of brown dwarfs, which are characterized by broad molecular absorption features and a lack of continuum.\nThe Cannon can infer numerical spectral types, absolute magnitudes, effective temperatures, and bolometric luminosities at precisions that are competitive with other methods, without the need for new parallax measurements. We find that using spectral indices instead of numerical spectral types for reference labels improves (i.e., decreases) the scatter and bias of the inferred values for all survey labels. Our best models can determine labels for L dwarfs with precisions of \u2248100 K in \ud835\udc47eff , \u22480.12 dex in log \ud835\udc3f, and .0.30 mag in MKO and 2MASS \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3e photometry. Similarly, properties of T dwarfs can be inferred with precisions of \u224830 K in \ud835\udc47eff , \u22480.06 dex in log \ud835\udc3f, and .0.17 mag in MKO \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3e photometry. Spectral indices can also be determined at precisions of \u2248 0.01. These precisions for \ud835\udc47eff and log \ud835\udc3f in T dwarfs are comparable to methods that employ absolute magnitude-based polynomial relations (e.g., Filippazzo et al. 2015; Dupuy & Liu 2017), indicating that the The Cannon can reach the systematic uncertainty limit in the polynomial-determined reference labels. When comparing inferred labels to the absolute magnitudes determined with spectral type-based relations, we find The Cannon can infer photometry at lower uncertainties and without requiring trigonometric parallaxes. We briefly examine the efficacy of The Cannon models for future spectroscopic missions. Replicating the resolving power of SPHEREx, \ud835\udc45 \u223c 40, we predict The Cannon will successfully infer physical properties with similar or lower precision than models that use higher-resolution spectra. We have not yet fully explored the possible combinations of data sets and parameters for The Cannon, and we expect future work to improve upon our results. We have also investigated several factors that affect The Cannon\u2019s ability to infer accurate labels. First, The Cannon relies on a continuum estimation that is used to identify wavelength regions in the spectra that do not change significantly with the labels and are near unity flux (a \u201ccontinuum mask\u201d). Typically, regions that are strongly affected by absorption are not identified for The Cannon\u2019s continuum normalization. However, applying this continuum mask\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201322 (2022)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201322 (2022)\nfor brown dwarf spectra is challenging since they contain few or no absorption-free regions. We found that typically, identifying \ud835\udc3d, \ud835\udc3b, and \ud835\udc3e bands as three distinct wavelength regions to be continuumnormalized separately is most appropriate for this process. Second, the accuracy of the inferred label values are limited by the quality of the reference labels given to train the model. We have assumed that the reference labels used for these models are accurate, but in reality they contain some uncertainty and potentially some bias. Including label uncertainties in The Cannonmodels as well as utilizing tailored methods to obtain more accurate reference label values (e.g.,\ud835\udc47eff and log \ud835\udc3f from spectral energy distribution fitting) could improve the inference of properties for new spectra. In future work, label uncertainties could be used as variables in the label functions or as labels themselves."
