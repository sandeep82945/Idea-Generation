The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is:

"Preliminary data obtained by Ferreira et al. (2023) [19] have demonstrated that the in vitro antimelanoma effect of CBEO is Reactive Oxygen Species-dependent. Oxidative stress is implicated in the modulation of various intracellular signaling pathways, including MAPKs, NF-ÎºB, and PKB/AKT. Herein, our results provide evidence of the involvement of these signaling pathways in the apoptosis induced by CBEO on SK-MEL-28 cells."

This section suggests that future research could further explore the mechanisms by which CBEO induces apoptosis in melanoma cells, particularly focusing on the role of oxidative stress and its impact on intracellular signaling pathways.
