    "abstractText": "Classically, superoxide anion O2 and reactive oxygen species ROS play a dual role. At the physiological balance level, they are a by-product of O2 reduction, necessary for cell signalling, and at the pathological level they are considered harmful, as they can induce disease and apoptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis and autophagic cell death. This revision focuses on understanding the main characteristics of the superoxide O2, its generation pathways, the biomolecules it oxidizes and how it may contribute to their modification and toxicity. The role of superoxide dismutase, the enzyme responsible for the removal of most of the superoxide produced in living organisms, is studied. At the same time, the toxicity induced by superoxide and derived radicals is beneficial in the oxidative death of microbial pathogens, which are subsequently engulfed by specialized immune cells, such as neutrophils or macrophages, during the activation of innate immunity. Ultimately, this review describes in some depth the chemistry related to O2 and how it is harnessed by the innate immune system to produce lysis of microbial agents.",

            "text": "In medicine, a great interest in the study of cellular stress and free radicals has emerged in recent years, focused on deepening our knowledge of the mechanisms of cellular selfcontrol that allow us to improve the quality of human life and understand the origin of a large number of diseases [1]. Oxidative stress is a component of many diseases, including atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer, among others [2]. Simultaneously, ROS are essential for a variety of biological functions, such as cell survival, growth, proliferation and differentiation, and immune response. However, one of the major obstacles to understanding the role of these species is the lack of adequate methods to detect ROS/RNS in vivo, mainly due to their very short lifetimes and the presence of several antioxidants in cells [3]. In fact, radicals are continuously generated by most organisms as a result of the use of O2 as a terminal electron acceptor in the mitochondrial electron transport chains and in cytochrome P450 [4]. The term reactive species refers to two types of molecules: free radicals and nonradicals [5]. This set of molecules is formed as a result of cellular metabolism and is represented in biological systems by reactive oxygen species ROS and reactive nitrogen species RNS, which arise in both normal physiological and pathological processes. Not excluding that, there are also reactive species from other elements, such as chlorine RClS\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1841. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24031841 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1841 2 of 44\nand bromine RBrS, although ROS and RNS are the two major groups involved in redox biology [6]. The superoxide anion is a primary oxygen radical that is formed when an oxygen molecule acquires an electron. The initial formation of O2\u2022\u2212 triggers a cascade of ROS, some of which, such as H2O2, behave as key molecules in cell signalling, and others, such as HO, are damaging. Ultimately, the biological impact of these molecules will be determined by the amount of ROS, cellular defences and the capacity for cellular adaptation [7]. O2\u2022\u2212 is one of the most important reactive oxygen species ROS responsible for oxidative stress in bio-organisms and is generated as a by-product of the mitochondrial respiratory chain [8]. Because of its charge, superoxide has a low membrane permeability, it passes through anion channels, but this is inefficient, and superoxide reacts to a large extent in the physiological compartment where it is generated. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a group of highly reactive oxygen-containing chemicals produced exogenously or endogenously from the reduction of oxygen and include both radicals and non-radicals, one of which is superoxide. ROS present in the body are mostly of endogenous origin, although they can also be generated in response to external stimuli, such as ultraviolet light, ionising radiation, pollution, alcohol and tobacco consumption, drugs and toxic agents [9], Figure 1. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 45 body are mostly of endogenous origin, although they can also be generated in response to external stimuli, such as ultraviolet light, ionising radiation, pollution, alcohol and tobacco consumption, drugs and toxic agents [9], Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Nomenclature of reactive species and free radicals and other reactive oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine species.\nTo control ROS, the body uses several antioxidant mechanisms, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants [10]. Non-enzymatic low-molecular-weight antioxidant compounds include cellular glutathione, vitamins C and E, \u03b2-carotene, polyphenols and uric acid. Antioxidant enzymes include superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase, among others. SOD catalyses the dismutation of superoxide to H2O2. Mammalian cells contain three forms of SOD: Mn-SOD, cytosolic Cu, Zn-SOD and extracellular Cu, Zn-SOD. MnSOD is most abundant in the mitochondria, whereas Cn, Zn-SOD predominates in the cytoplasm [11]. Catalase is an important antioxidant enzyme that catalyses the reduction of H2O2 to H2O. Glutathione peroxidase is another important enzyme for the decomposition of H2O2. Polyphenols, ingested regularly through the fruit and vegetable diet, are a large family of natural organic compounds characterized by multiple hydroxyl phenolic units, with a polyphenolic structure, (several hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings), including four main classes: phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and lignans [12]. Evidence and research to date supports the role of polyphenols in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [13]. A significant part of their beneficial effects are based on the modulation of cell signalling pathways [14]."

The pH controls the distribution between HO2\u2022 and O2\u2022. Near the membrane, where this radical is produced, the pH is much lower than in the cytoplasm, so the acid form or hydroperoxide radical will predominate. Due to its non-ionic nature, it can enter the cell membrane and trigger lipid peroxidation processes [19]. The hydroperoxide radical is much more reactive, more oxidising than the superoxide radical, but in aqueous solution at physiological pH the non-protonated form, i.e., the superoxide radical, predominates. Perhydroxyl constitutes less than 1% of superoxide at neutral pH so its impact is more limited. Superoxide absorbs light in the ultraviolet range with a maximum at 245 nm and an extinction coefficient of 2350 M\u22121 cm\u22121, whereas hydroperoxyl absorbs at 225 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1400 M\u22121 cm\u22121 [20]. O2\u2022\u2013 is toxic, mainly because it damages proteins containing Fe-S centres, such as aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, among others. However, it can also be the generator of other reactive species even more toxic than itself, the iron released from iron and sulphur proteins can give rise to secondary products, such as hydroxyl radicals, and these, plus peroxynitrite, are thought to be the main contributors to superoxide toxicity. Superoxide dismutase SOD is the enzyme responsible for transforming this reactive species into one of a lower toxicity, such as hydrogen peroxide H2O2, Figure 6.\nFigure 6.

However, O2\u2022\u2013 can rapidly react with other radicals to give other reactive species [22].\n3. Sources of Superoxide Anion 3.1. Biological Sources\nOxygen is an element that has a dual physiological effect; it is essential for the development of aerobic life and has toxic effects inherent to its structure. Oxygen utilisation by aerobic organisms, under normal conditions, generates reactive oxygen metabolites that can lead to a state of oxidative stress if the pro-oxidant/antioxidant cell balance is disturbed. Superoxide is a primary radical formed when an oxygen molecule acquires an electron through enzymatic or non-enzymatic reactions [11], Figure 7.\nFigure 5.

Superoxide radicals are produced in complexes I and III of the electron transport chain by transferring electrons to molecular oxygen. Mitochondria, present in all aerobic cells, are the most important biological source of superoxide carried out by two components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, ubisemiquinone and the flavin semiquinone of NADH dehydrogenase. The superoxide radical is not able to cross the inner mitochondrial membrane so it is confined to the matrix where it reacts rapidly with the enzyme manganese-superoxide dismutase Mn-SOD and nitric oxide to form hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite, respectively [28], Figure 10.

However, their solubilities are increased by the addition of tetraalkylammonium salts, such as tetramethylammonium superoxide [54,55].

SOD disproportionation of superoxide to O2 and H2O2.\nAn important difference between SORs and SODs is that SORs contain only iron. OR and SOD enzymes have the ability to react selectively with superoxide in both the oxidised and reduced SOD and SOR states [69]. In particular, the reduced enzymes are rapidly oxidised by superoxide but not by O2, and the oxidised forms of SOD are rapidly reduced by superoxide. SOD enzymes catalyse the disproportionation of O2\u2022\u2013 by a very similar ping-pong mechanism, in which O2\u2022\u2013 acts alternately to reduce the oxidised metal ion and then to oxidise the reduced metal ion, the ping-pong mechanism requiring the enzyme\u2019s reduction potential E\u00b0 to lie between the oxidation and reduction potentials of superoxide. SOR enzymes perform only the latter of these two steps; that is, O2\u2022\u2013 performs the Fe2+ oxidation step but not the Fe3+ reduction step. Superoxide dismutase SOD is the enzyme responsible for transforming this reactive species into a less toxic one, such as H2O2, which is subsequently transformed into water by other enzymes. All aerobic species have developed multiple strategies to detoxify ROS. The first line of defence is the dismutation (transformation) of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide by the enzyme SOD which catalyses a dismutation reaction where one molecule of O2\u2022\u2013 is oxidised to molecular O2, while the other is reduced to H2O2. The enzyme superoxide dismutase is the cell\u2019s first enzymatic defence against superoxide radical production. To generate hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, this enzyme catalyses the dismutation of the superoxide radical. In mammals, this family consists of three members, which are located in clearly specific places, two inside the cell and one extracellular. In the cytoplasm, there is SOD1 or Cu, Zn-SOD [70], which contains copper and zinc in its catalytic centre. The second enzyme is located near the mitochondrial inner membrane. This is a SOD that binds manganese in its catalytic centre (SOD2 or Mn-SOD) [71,72]. Finally, there is one more, called SOD3 or EC-SOD [73], located outside the cell (in the extracellular matrix), and has copper and zinc and is the only extracellular protein that can remove O2\u2022. The first and most obvious similarity between these enzymes is that they all contain redox-active metal ions in their active sites: Fe2+/3+ in Fe-SOD and SOR, Mn2+/3+ in Mn-SOD and Cu1+/2+ in Cu,Zn-SOD. Although all three perform the same catalytic activity, they differ greatly in their structure and organisation. The enzymatic reaction is carried out by SOD in two steps, both of which are firstorder enzymatic reactions with respect to O2\u2022\u2013, Figure 31.\nM(ox) + O2 + H M(red) [H ] + O2\nM(red) [H ] + O2 + H M(ox) + H2O2\nNet reaction: 2O2 + 2H H2O2 + O2\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 31.

However, the second reaction was pH-dependent [78]. Cu,Zn-SOD is a dimeric enzyme with each monomeric unit containing a copper and zinc active site linked by a histidine imidazole. Copper is bound by three additional histidines with a distorted square planar structure and an additional water molecule. Zinc is bound by two histidines and an aspartate in addition to the imidazole bridge. Copper is the redox active metal and zinc appears to play a role in the overall stability of the enzyme and in facilitating a high-pH-independence of enzyme activity [79], Figure 33.\nThe reaction mechanism of SOD1 unfolds as follows: O2\u2022\u2013 arrives at the reaction centre and binds, by an electrostatic interaction, to arginine 143. O2\u2022\u2013- needs to donate its unpaired electron in order to be converted to molecular oxygen, as it is this electron that gives it its reactive and toxic nature. The electron is transferred to Cu2+, which transforms the metal to its lower oxidation state, or Cu+. This electron transfer causes the bond between Cu and histidine 63 to be broken, which causes the nitrogen in histidine 63 to be protonated. The O2 formed dissociates from arginine 143 and is released, Figure 34.\nFigure 32.

SOD1 catalytic centre.\nThe reaction mechanism of SOD1 unfolds as follows: O2\u2022\u2212 arrives at the reaction centre and binds, by an electrostatic interaction, to arginine 143. O2\u2022\u2014 needs to donate its unpaired electron in order to be converted to molecular oxygen, as it is this electron that gives it its reactive and toxic nature. The electron is transferred to Cu2+, which transforms the metal to its lower oxidation state, or Cu+. This electron transfer causes the bond between Cu and histidine 63 to be broken, which causes the nitrogen in his idine 63 to be protona ed. The O2 formed dissociates from arg nine 143 and s released, Figure 34. The second part of the reaction starts in a similar way to the first part, the O2\u2022\u2212 arrives at the catalytic centre, and once there, it binds by an electrostatic interaction with arginine 143. Together with this, the protonation of a water molecule H3O+ is generated in the vicinity of the catalytic centre. The electron that Cu received in the first part of the reaction is now transferred to the second O2\u2022\u2212 allowing the oxidation of the metal to Cu2+. The two electrons now possessed by the superoxide can immediately form two covalent bonds with two protons, which are donated, one by the protonated water molecule, and the other by the nitrogen of histidine 63, thus re-establishing the bond it originally formed with Cu2+. This allows the release of H2O2 and the regeneration of the enzyme, Figure 35.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1841 15 of 44 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 45\nFigure 34.

Desulfoferrodoxins are a homodimeric non-heme iron protein found in some sulphate-reducing bacteria and archaea [90,91]. Neelaredoxins, from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, have biofunctional properties as SOD and ROS. Desulfoferrodoxins and neelaredoxins have been isolated mainly in the Fe2+ and Fe3+ forms, respectively.

Reaction with Iron\u2013Sulphur [Fe\u2013S] Cluster The best-established detrimental effect of superoxide is the inactivation of iron/sulphur protein groups, such as aconitase, and bacterial dehydratases required for branched-chain amino acid synthesis. Mammalian aconitases (mitochondrial and cytosolic isoenzymes) are unique iron/sulphur-group-containing proteins in which the metal centre participates in the catalysis of a non-redox reaction. The [4Fe-4S] group exists in a cubic structure, with iron and sulphur atoms found in alternating corner positions. These groups are found in bacterial ferredoxins and within mitochondrial respiratory complexes. The detrimental effect of superoxide is the inactivation of iron/sulphurcontaining protein groups. These reactions have rate constants in excess of 106 M\u22121 s\u22121 and are highly selective for the superoxide [107]. Aconitase is an essential enzyme, particularly sensitive to oxidative damage and is preferentially modified and inactivated by mitochondrial oxidants during ageing and in pathologies involving mitochondrial dysfunction. It is one of the main targets of superoxide. Aconitase activity is also sensitive to nitric oxide, peroxynitrite and the carbonate radical [108]. Aconitase deficiency is associated with myopathies and low exercise endurance [109]. Certain variants of aconitase have been found to cause infantile cerebellar-retinal degeneration syndrome, which is characterised by various neurological and muscular symptoms [110]. Within the Cuban group of iron\u2013sulphur aconitases, only three of the four iron ions have cysteine thiolate ligands; the fourth iron ion (Fe\u03b1) is exposed to the solvent within the active site pocket and binds to the oxygen atoms of the water or substrates to be dehydrated. An example of binding of the ferro-sulphurised centre of aconitase with citrate is shown in Figure 43.\nMitochondrial aconitase is a ferrosulphoprotein located in the mitochondrial matrix that catalyses the reversible isomerisation of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate in the Krebs cycle [111], Figure 44. The reaction mechanism can be divided into three phases, a dehydration phase, followed by a rotation and finally a rehydration phase. In dehydration, the OH group attached to the Fe-S centre is protonated and eliminated, forming cis-aconitate. In order to rehydrate, the molecule needs to rotate 180\u00ba, which takes\nFigure 42.

The enzyme has an asymmetric binding site for citrate, allowing the substrate to bind only in a specific orientation, so the transfer of the OH occurs only if the appropriate orientation conditions are met [112]. The high reactivity of aconitase with superoxide ion is due to the presence of the [4Fe4S] centre with labile Fe in its active site [113]. The mechanism involves (i) electrostatic attraction of the superoxide to the solvent-exposed group, (ii) protonation to become a strong univalent oxidant, and (iii) single electron abstraction.

Superoxide and H2O2 added to NOX subunits have been shown to decrease O2\u2022\u2212 production, but only when added prior to subunit assembly [172]. Additionally, O2\u2022\u2212 derived from different NOx influences distinct downstream signalling pathways, which may be the reason for the co-expression of more than one isoform of NOX in specific cell types [173]. Phagocytes can release O2\u2022\u2212 both into the phagosome and the extracellular space due to expression of NOX2 on both the phagosome and the plasma membrane [174]. The activation of the mammalian phagocyte NOX2 is tightly regulated and predominantly depends on the engagement of surface receptors by dedicated ligands. Some cell surface receptors (Toll-like receptors (TLR), G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and TNF receptors (TNFR)), can prime the NOX2 activation [175]. Stimulation of other receptors, including Fc and integrin, result in direct activation of NOX2. As NOx is assembled, electrons pass from cytosolic NADPH to FAD and membraneintegrated heme groups and begin the reduction of molecular oxygen O2 to O2\u2022\u2212. Superoxide O2\u2022\u2212 is a highly reactive \u201cnon-diffusible\u201d specie that is enzymatically transformed to hydrogen peroxide. In granulocytes, H2O2 is quickly converted into hypochlorous acid HOCl [176] by the action of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) contained within them. HOCl has superior bactericidal characteristics to superoxide [177]. The role of superoxide in phagocytes differs depending on NOX2 expression and activity. After activation, neutrophils produce more O2\u2022\u2212 compared to monocytes and macrophages [178]. Dendritic cells (DC) express little NOX2 and consequently have a lower O2\u2022\u2212 and ROS production after activation [179]. In neutrophils, H2O2 generation in phagosomes activates the enzyme myeloperoxidase, catalysing the production of HOCl, which is oxidant and antimicrobial, and contributes greatly to the lysis of microbes [178]. After infection, excessive neutrophil activity causes tissue damage, so their deactivation or cell death is physiologically important and tightly regulated. This process is called pathogen-induced cell death and is also dependent on NOx activity [180]. Mononuclear phagocytes (primarily monocytes and macrophages) do not express MPO and thus contain more H2O2 in their phagosomes."

Metchnikoff won the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his description of phagocytosis and went so far as to propose that the key to immunity was to \u201cstimulate phagocytes\u201d [181]. Irrespective of their role in the immune system, macrophages clear about 2 \u00d7 1011 erythrocytes daily and are also involved in the removal of cellular debris generated during tissue remodelling, thereby eliminating cells that have undergone apoptosis. These clearance processes are a vital metabolic contribution, without which the host would not survive [182]. Macrophages (from Greek: large eaters, makros + phagein), are the first immune cells to encounter invading pathogens, and their goal is to engulf microbes, dead cells, foreign substances, cancer cells and cellular debris by phagocytosis [183]. These phagocytes are found essentially in all tissues, and historically, they have been given various names, as histiocytes, Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages, microglia and others, all of which are part of the mononuclear phagocytic system [184]. They play a key role in nonspecific defence (also called as innate immunity) and help specific defence mechanisms (adaptive immunity) by recruiting other immune cells (lymphocytes) [185]. If a person has dysfunctional macrophages, this causes diseases, such as chronic granulomatous disease, which leads to frequent infections, as this first line of defence against infection is not available [186].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1841 33 of 44\nHuman macrophages are about 21 \u00b5m in diameter and are produced by the differentiation of monocytes in tissues [187]. Macrophage activation is a response to a wide range of stimuli, including the nature of microbial agents, damaged cells, activated lymphocytes and inflammatory cells [188]. Classically activated macrophages require a priming signal in the form of interferon IFN-\u03b3 [189]. Priming of macrophages with IFN-\u03b3 reprograms cellular responses to other cytokines, such as type I IFNs and IL-10. Alternatively activated macrophages do not require any priming, because interleukins IL-4 and/or IL-13 can act as enough stimuli [190,191]. Alternatively activated macrophages change their morphology and chemical secretion pattern as a result [192]. The bioplasticity of macrophages is one of their main characteristics, resulting in extreme heterogeneity under physiological but also pathological conditions. Macrophages can be classified into two distinct subsets: M1, or classically activated, and M2, or alternatively activated [193]. This plasticity induces a phenomenon called polarisation, which regulates the functionality of macrophages and the role they will play in the tissues that host them [194]. M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory and polarized by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and/or cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3 and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF, and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1\u03b2 IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-\u03b1 [194]. They secrete high levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. M1 macrophages produce intracellular nitric oxide \u2022NO by inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS and superoxide anion O2\u2022\u2212 and subsequent reactive species, which are cytotoxic to microbial agents and fight infection [195]. M2 macrophages are polarized and activated upon exposure to certain cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 or IL-13, subsequently producing polyamines and/or proline, which are involved in cell proliferation and collagen production [196]. These M2 macrophages are associated with wound healing and tissue repair. The secretion of the inflammationinhibiting cytokine IL-10 is the hallmark of M2 macrophages, arginase-1 and more organic compounds [197]. This phenotype can be further subdivided into M2a, M2b and M2c, based on their specific functions. All three subtypes have anti-inflammatory properties, but M2a and M2b macrophages are considered immunoregulatory and are known to mediate the Th-2 response. M2c cells are immunosuppressive and are involved in extracellular matrix ECM remodelling. M2a and M2c secrete growth factors that promote the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and tissue regeneration [198]. Finally, it is increasingly clear that macrophages are involved in the progression of pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity and wound healing [196]. In cancer, M1 macrophages have anti-tumour functions, while M2 macrophages support angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of neoplastic cells. Most tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) adopt an M2-type phenotype, and their presence correlates with a poor prognosis [199,200]. Alongside O2\u2022\u2212 production, macrophages employ several direct antimicrobial mechanisms in the phagosome, such as reactive nitrogen species RNS, as well as delivery of cathepsins and other hydrolases [201\u2013204]. Indirect mechanisms involve inflammasome activation and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, which aim to organize subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as MHC-dependent presentation of pathogen-derived antigens [205]. When macrophages initiate the bacterial recognition process, O2\u2022\u2212 production starts in different cellular compartments [201]. One of the most important goals is the lysis of phagocytosed bacteria by the oxidative burst generated by the NADPH oxidase NOX2. The oxidative burst is the rapid release of O22- from various cell types, especially macrophages and neutrophils, and it requires a 10- to 20-fold increase in oxygen consumption by NOX activity. The oxidative burst in phagocytes is usually associated with killing bacteria, but in the case of alveolar macrophages, they usually produce lower levels of ROS than neutrophils and may need to be activated to exert their bactericidal properties. Instead,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1841 34 of 44\ntheir transient oxidative burst regulates the inflammatory response by triggering the synthesis of cytokines for redox signalling, resulting in an influx of activated neutrophils and macrophages."

            "heading": "8.2. Neutrophils",
            "text": "Neutrophils are a main cellular component of the innate immunity and play a dual role because they provide a rapid and non-specific response to the infectious progression and mediate between the innate and the adaptive immune systems. Neutrophils are short-lived granulocytes derived from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow [206]. Most haematopoiesis is related to granulopoiesis, and almost 60% of bone marrow leukocytes are granulocyte precursors [207]. Neutrophils are the main leukocytes circulating in the blood, and the first innate immune cells to be recruited to a focus of infection. Here, neutrophils have several defence strategies at their disposal, such as the production of superoxide O2\u2022\u2212, the release of antimicrobial factors and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) [208]. There are two main granule populations in mature neutrophils: (i) azurophils are the first to develop during granulopoiesis, they contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) and other proteolytic enzymes (cathepsins, proteinase-3, elastase), antimicrobial defensins and bactericidal proteins [209]; and (ii) a specific type of granules (peroxidase negative) that mature during differentiation contain membrane proteins, such as lactoferrin and collagenase, and are receptors for chemotactic peptides, cytokines, opsonins and adhesion proteins [210]. Mature neutrophils are released into the bloodstream, where they circulate for 10\u201324 h before migrating to tissues, where they remain for the next 1\u20132 days before undergoing apoptosis and being cleared by macrophages [211]. Neutrophils released into the systemic circulation constitute most of the circulating leukocyte cell population. Under normal conditions, the number of mature neutrophils is almost constant, but during an infectious process their population can increase up to 10-fold [212]. Some circulating neutrophils move through the walls of postcapillary veins through transient interactions with endothelial cells [213]. Their role is to look for signs of tissue damage, inflammation or the invading microorganisms themselves, as well as the presence of chemotactic or chemoattractant signals derived from the host and/or pathogen [214]. In the presence of pathogens, different host cells (such as monocytes and macrophages) secrete inflammatory and neutrophil chemoattractant mediators (such as the leukotriene LTB4 involved in inflammation, the interleukin IL-8, and the chemokine CXCL6, a small cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family, also known as granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 GCP-2) which bind to specific receptors on the neutrophil surface [215]. These signals direct neutrophils from the intravascular space to the site of infection in tissues. Another important fact is neutrophil priming described in the early 1980s. Its classical definition is the ability of a primary agonist, under stimulatory concentrations, to enhance superoxide production in response to a secondary stimulus [216]. Priming occurs at almost all levels of neutrophil function: adhesion, phagocytosis, cytokine secretion, leukotriene synthesis and degranulation. Priming is induced by cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, lipid-derived signalling molecules and physical cell\u2013cell contact and adhesion [217]. Following recognition of chemotactic signals and/or priming of neutrophils, neutrophils leave the peripheral circulation by transmigration through the endothelial wall, a process termed extravasation [209]. At the site of infection, neutrophils bind and ingest the invading micro-organisms by phagocytosis. Two main mechanisms account for the microbicidal properties of neutrophils: (i) The production of O2\u2022\u2212. Neutrophils possess the enzyme NOX which, when activated, produces superoxide anion, with strong antimicrobial properties. Superoxide can be released outside the cell, or inside the cell (in the phagosome); (ii) The coordinated release of proteolytic and antimicrobial granule content. The release of the contents of the primary and secondary granules has important antimicrobial significance. The granules contain MPO, lactoferrin, lysosomes and NGAL [218]. The\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1841 35 of 44\nenzyme myeloperoxidase MPO forms hypochlorous acid HOCl [176] after reaction of chloride anion with hydrogen peroxide. HOCl oxidises tyrosine residues to form the tyrosyl radical [128].\nBecause of their common origin, neutrophils and macrophages have common functions (phagocytosis) and similar kinetic performance during infections [218]. Neutrophils can influence macrophage differentiation into pro- or anti-inflammatory subtypes [218]. Interferon-\u03b3 released by activated neutrophils induces macrophage activation [219]. Neutrophils release MPO, which is taken up by residential macrophages expressing macrophage mannose receptors (MMR). The interaction between MPO and MMRs leads to the release of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, GM-CSF) by macrophages. The release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, G-CSF and GM-CSF at the site of macrophage infection increases the survival of recruited neutrophils from 6\u201312 h to 24\u201348 h [220]. The cytokine IL-17 is an element of the innate immune system released by CD4+ Th17, NK cells and neutrophils. IL-17 acts on neutrophils by increasing their number, survival and recruitment to the site of infection [221]. Neutrophils are the transport vehicle for intracellular pathogens carrying antigens to DCs and participate in the activation of the T-cell immune response by DCs [222]. The reaction of neutrophils and macrophages during infection triggers the production of innate defence regulatory peptide 1 IDR1, with similar activity to defensins or cathelicidins [223]. IDR1 stimulates the antimicrobial activity of macrophages [224]. Along with activation of innate or adaptive immune cells, neutrophils, by releasing arginase or ROS, can inhibit NK-cell or T-cell activation by depriving extracellular levels of L-arginine, necessary for T-cell activation [225]."

            "text": "Superoxide is produced mainly through metabolic reactions in which oxygen molecules are consumed. The control of O2\u2022\u2212 represents for the cell the neural point in the balance between oxidants and antioxidants. In a physiological equilibrium, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are useful substances involved in cell signalling. However, in a pathological state, ROS can be dangerous if the synthesis of these molecules is initiated in an uncontrolled manner. Consequently, they perform two tasks in the metabolism of the cell. The mitochondrial transport chain ETC generates superoxide under physiological conditions, increasing ROS production and oxidative stress. Mitochondria are the main source of intracellular O2\u2022\u2212 production, which can lead to mtDNA damage and increased superoxide production. Other internal sources that can induce superoxide are NADPH oxidase NOX, xanthine oxidase XO, lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, and cytochrome P450 CYP/cytochrome P450 reductase POR. Reactive stress occurs when an excess of free radicals overwhelms the body and cannot be neutralized by the antioxidant mechanism (enzymes or peptides, such as glutathione or superoxide dismutase (SOD), etc.). At the same time, ROS-induced toxicity is beneficial for the oxidative destruction of microbial pathogens during the activation of the innate immune system via specialized immune cells, such as neutrophils or macrophages.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.M.C.A. and C.A.J.; investigation, C.M.C.A. and C.A.J.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.M.C.A., C.A.J., J.M.P.d.l.L., E.P.-L. and F.J.P.; supervision, C.M.C.A., C.A.J. and J.M.P.d.l.L.
