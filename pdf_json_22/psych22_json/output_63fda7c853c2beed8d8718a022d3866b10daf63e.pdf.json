Phubbing has previously been associated with several negative relational and personal outcomes (i.e., reduced relationship satisfaction, low mood, and increased interpersonal conflict). The present study explored the consequences of partner phubbing on phubbee\u2019s (i.e., the recipient\u2019s) daily reports of relationship satisfaction and personal well-being. To extend current phubbing literature, we assessed how phubbees responded to being phubbed (ignoring, resentment, curiosity, retaliation, conflict) and their motivations for engaging in any retaliatory behaviours. Participants (N = 75) completed a 10day daily diary study, consisting of short baseline and daily measures (perceived partner phubbing, relationship satisfaction, depressed mood, anxious mood, self-esteem, anger/frustration, responses to phubbing, and, if applicable, motivations for retaliation). Results revealed phubbees reported lower relationship satisfaction and greater feelings of anger when daily perceived partner phubbing was high. Likewise, when perceived partner phubbing was high, phubbees reported greater curiosity, resentment, and retaliation. Revenge, need for support, and need for approval were all significant motivations for retaliation. Findings reinforced the emotional and behavioural impact of phubbing on the recipient.",

The way in which we interact with others has, as a result, adapted to keep up with the fastpaced digital climate. This may be particularly evident in romantic relationships in which smartphones allow both parties to establish (Cizmeci, 2017) and maintain romantic interest (Jin & Pen\u0303a, 2010).\nThe adverse effects of smartphone use on face-to-face interactions are evident, however. Research suggests smartphones interfering with in-person interactions may lead to conflict as individuals become increasingly suspicious of their partner (Cizmeci, 2017). The ease and accessibility of smartphones can, therefore, aid individuals in forming connections where proximity acts as a barrier but hinder face-to-face interactions when one party cannot control usage. Researchers coined this behaviour \u201cphubbing.\u201d"

Although a relatively new phenomenon, since the term first emerged in 2012, academic interest in phubbing behaviour has steadily increased (Capilla Garrido et al., 2021). Phubbing behaviours are related to a wider construct known as \u201ctechnoference\u201d: \u201ceveryday intrusions or interruptions in couple interactions or time spent together that occur due to technology\u201d (McDaniel & Coyne, 2016, p. 85). Such interruptions may be due to the compelling allure of smartphones and seem to be particularly detrimental within romantic relationships. This type of phubbing, i.e., partner phubbing (Pphubbing), has been associated with several negative outcomes. The aims of the present study are threefold: (1) to explore the influence of daily perceived partner phubbing on daily personal and relational outcomes, (2) to assess how participants respond to daily perceived partner phubbing, (3) to understand the motivations for choosing to retaliate against perceived partner phubbing.\nAccording to previous literature, phubbing increases couples\u2019 phonerelated conflict, subsequently lowering relationship satisfaction (McDaniel et al., 2018). Likewise, phubbing has been found to significantly reduce marital quality (Khodabakhsh & Ong, 2021). In an experimental study by Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas (2018),\n* Corresponding author.

Afterwards, they were assigned to one of three conditions in which they were: not phubbed at all, partially phubbed, or consistently phubbed. Findings demonstrated that being phubbed threatened individual sense of belonging, which was associated in turn with reduced communication quality and relationship satisfaction.\nBeing attentive in the presence of one\u2019s partner often has a large effect on how the individual perceives the current state of the relationship (McDaniel & Drouin, 2019). Phubbing, however, introduces a third competitor into the relationship. As the displacement hypothesis suggests, smartphones consume valuable time that could otherwise be spent with one\u2019s partner (Abbasi, 2018). Not only does phubbing evoke feelings of resentment and jealousy from the phubbee (Krasnova et al., 2016), but it also prompts them to re-evaluate satisfaction within the relationship."

            "text": "Research has explored the association between being phubbed and relationship dissatisfaction. Research has also examined the association between being phubbed and its impact on the phubbee\u2019s personal wellbeing. In a study of 243 Chinese married individuals, participants who perceived greater partner phubbing reported significantly lower relationship satisfaction. Additionally, lower relationship satisfaction indirectly predicted greater depressive symptoms (Wang et al., 2017). Another study explored the qualitative responses of 200 university students when phubbed; 83% reported annoyance in response to being phubbed and 66.5% reported feeling angry (Nazir, 2017). Likewise, Krasnova et al. (2016) found mediation effects of jealousy on perceived partner phubbing and relational cohesion; Perceived phubbing induced more jealousy-related emotions (62.3%), including anger in \u201cgeneration Y\u201d smartphone users. Notably, some individuals reported feeling indifferent (38.1%), implying mixed emotional responses towards perceived phubbing. The association between partner phubbing and lower personal well-being is replicated within the wider technoference literature. A 14-day daily diary study, conducted by McDaniel and Drouin (2019), explored the impact of technoference on couple interactions and individual well-being. Findings revealed that on days when technoference was perceived as high, individuals reported lower quality of interactions, increased conflict, and lower mood. Such findings are consistent with the notion that being phubbed is largely linked to negative emotional outcomes for its recipient.\nNegative emotions are often evoked when an individual feels socially excluded or ostracized in some manner (Chotpitayasunondh & Douglas, 2018). Feelings of exclusion, along with perceived partner responsiveness and perceived intimacy, were found to be significant mediators of perceived phubbing and relationship satisfaction (Beukeboom & Pollmann, 2021). Social exchange theorists argue relationships are based on \u201cinterdependency\u201d. From the first initial meeting to the formation of a committed relationship, individuals often evaluate the costs against the benefits of the relationship via actions displayed by their partner (Burgess & Huston, 2013). Equity theory (Hatfield & Traupmann, 1981) proposes a similar theoretical standpoint: Equal investment in the relationship (rewards/costs) helps to maximise outcomes (satisfaction). When one individual perceives unequal investment, this increases distress, and they work harder to maintain equity. Being phubbed by one\u2019s partner may be an indicator of unequal investment. When individuals experience partner phubbing, they perceive lower partner responsiveness, lower intimacy, and greater feelings of exclusion (Beukeboom & Pollmann, 2021; McDaniel & Wesselmann, 2021; Vanden Abeele et al., 2019). These negative evaluations may then be attributed to the failings of the relationship itself, resulting in lower relationship satisfaction (e.g., Chotpitayasunondh & Douglas, 2018; McDaniel et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017). Alternatively, the phubbee may perceive lower partner responsiveness and greater social exclusion as a sign of\ntheir own shortcomings. Feelings of distress and anxiety then arise due to not being deemed interesting enough to hold their partner\u2019s attention (Chotpitayasunondh & Douglas, 2018), resulting in lower self-esteem and emotional well-being (e.g., McDaniel & Drouin, 2019; Wang et al., 2017)."

            "text": "Although the emotional outcomes of partner phubbing on the phubbee have been examined in previous literature, little is known regarding retaliation against Pphubbing. How does the phubbee respond to such behaviour? And what are their motivations to do so/avoid doing so? Research shows that a common response to Pphubbing is to simply ignore it (Kelly et al., 2017). Some individuals chose to intervene when phubbed by their partner, others copied partner\u2019s phubbing behaviour (Krasnova et al., 2016). The motivations for each retaliation strategy remain unclear. One benefit of ignoring phubbing may be to retain the peace, regardless of the negative impact on phubbee\u2019s own well-being. Imitation of Pphubbing, on the other hand, implies a tit-for-tat strategy. Alternatively, in interviews conducted on Danish college students, participants admitted to phubbing others despite being aware of how annoying it was (Aagaard, 2020). These findings suggest imitation of partner phubbing may, instead, be attributed to a lack of self-control in the presence of technology, coined by Aagaard (2020) as \u201cdigital akrasia.\u201d Understanding the behavioural responses of the phubbee and disentangling motivations behind why the phubbee may phub others is therefore the primary focus of the current study.\nIn the present study, we aim to replicate previous findings of daily perceived partner phubbing on personal and relational outcomes (i.e., relationship satisfaction, depressed mood, anxious mood, self-esteem, anger/frustration). We also aim to address novel research questions on whether daily perceived partner phubbing facilitates retaliation behaviour in addition to other previously established responses, and what motivations phubbees endorse for imitating their partner\u2019s smartphone use (i.e., revenge, boredom, seeking support, seeking approval). To extend upon previous research which has been largely cross-sectional, we have adopted a daily diary approach.\nTo summarise, in this paper we explore how perceived partner phubbing influences one\u2019s daily reports of relationship satisfaction, anger/frustration, personal well-being, and responses to phubbing, including desire to retaliate, and motives for retaliation. Based on previous research, we predicted that on days when perceptions of phubbing are high, individuals will be more likely to report lower levels of relationship satisfaction (H1) and higher levels of anger/frustration (H2). We also predict on days when perceptions of phubbing are high, individuals will be more likely to report lower personal well-being (H3). In response to perceived partner phubbing, we predict that individuals will respond in the following ways (H4a): ignoring phubbing, feeling resentment, being curious, creating conflict and retaliating. Retaliation, in particular, is our novel prediction; On days when perceptions of phubbing are high, individuals will be more likely to engage in retaliatory behaviour (H4b). As part of this novel hypothesis, we anticipate the individuals who choose to retaliate against partner phubbing will have various motivations for doing so (H4c). Boredom, revenge, a need for support, and a need for approval were the motivations explored in this study. Through this, we gain a novel understanding of why individuals who are phubbed may engage in tit-for-tat retaliation.\nT.T. Thomas et al.\nComputers in Human Behavior 137 (2022) 107398"

During preregistration, the target sample size (150) was determined based on previous studies using the daily diary approach (e.g., Kushlev & Heintzelman, 2017). Due to time and cost limitations, however, this was not achieved. A power analysis was conducted using Murayama et al. (2022) \u201csummary-statistics-based power analysis for mixed-effects modelling\u201d web app. This was performed post hoc using multilevel data from the current study (N = 75) exploring the effect of daily perceived partner phubbing on daily relationship satisfaction (t = - 3.03). With an \u03b1 = 0.05 and power = .80, results proposed a sample of 67 would be required to detect an effect with 80% probability.\nIndividuals were recruited via social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), online forums, and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria required all participants be: (a) aged 18 or over, (b) currently in a romantic relationship \u2265 six months, (c) living with their current partner. Participants who had only completed the baseline survey were not included in the final sample. The initial sample included 77 participants, two of which were excluded due to incomplete baseline data and not meeting required relationship length.\nA total of 75 participants (M\u1d43\u1d4d\u1d49 = 32.00, SD = 10.24) completed the baseline diary and at least one daily diary. The majority of participants identified as female (52), with the remaining participants identifying as male (19). Two participants identified as non-binary and one as transmasculine. One individual chose not to disclose. When asked to describe their sexual orientation, 75% identified as straight, 15% as bisexual, 5% as lesbian, 3% as gay, 1% as asexual, and 1% as pansexual. Participants were also asked to report current relationship status. Dating was the least selected option (3%) with the majority of sample either in a committed relationship (52%) or married (45%); 29% had children whereas 71% did not. The average length of participants\u2019 relationship was approximately 8 years (SD = 8.08). Relationship length ranged from 6 months to 40 years.\nA large portion of the sample stated they were either employed full time (57%) or students (29%). Several participants selected \u201cother\u201d for occupation (8%), for reasons such as working two jobs or living with a disability. The remaining few stated they were employed part time (3%) or homemakers (3%).\nData collection ran from March to August 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns during this time, we asked participants to report own and partner remote working status. Fifty-three percent of the sample did not work from home at the time of data collection. However, 45% stated they were currently working from home. Likewise, 45% stated their partner was currently working from home, with 55% stating partner was currently not working from home. Such contextual knowledge is important in understanding how phubbing disrupts the quality of face-to-face interactions during working hours."

Prior to participation, participants were asked to read the study information sheet and provide informed consent.\nThe study was advertised as a diary study on \u201cMobile Phone Use in Romantic Relationships\u201d. During the study, participants were asked to complete one baseline diary followed by nine short daily diaries. All daily diaries were created and distributed online via Qualtrics. Participants completed an average of 5.11 days, including baseline. In total, the\nstudy took approximately one hour spanning across 10 days (5min/day). The baseline measures (Day 1) consisted of demographic questions (e.g., sexual orientation, employment status, relationship length), and measured both attachment style and narcissistic traits2. Individuals who completed the baseline diary and had not met the inclusion criteria were unable to continue with the study. The following daily diaries measured perceived partner phubbing, responses to partner phubbing, relationship satisfaction, personal well-being (i.e., depressed mood, anxious mood, self-esteem), and anger/frustration. The daily measures were randomised to prevent order effects.\nUpon completion of the baseline measures, participants were entered into a prize draw to win 1 of 3 \u00a350 Amazon vouchers. They were instructed that each daily diary completed would provide them with an additional five raffle tickets into the prize draw. This incentive was implemented to increase retention. Debriefing occurred once the participant had completed the study. They were provided with the aims and rationale for the study, as well as researcher contact information and relationship counselling signposting."

            "text": "The present study aimed to replicate and extend three primary research questions. Firstly, we explored associations between perceptions of partner phubbing and daily reports of relationship satisfaction, anger/frustration, personal well-being (i.e., self-esteem, anxious and depressed mood). Consistent with previous research (Beukeboom & Pollmann, 2021; Chotpitayasunondh & Douglas, 2018; McDaniel et al., 2018; Roberts & David, 2016; Wang et al., 2017), we found daily perception of partner phubbing was associated with lower phubbee relationship satisfaction. Likewise, daily perceptions of partner phubbing was associated with greater feelings of anger/frustration. As previous research suggests, phubbing is linked to various negative relational and emotional outcomes for the recipient. These include, but are not exclusive to, jealousy and anger. Therefore, our findings replicate that of previous literature (e.g., Krasnova et al., 2016; Nazir, 2017).\nTo explore the relationship between perceived phubbing and personal well-being, we examined several daily indicators: anxious mood, depressed mood, and state self-esteem. Daily perceived partner phubbing was not significantly associated with daily anxious mood, depressed mood, nor self-esteem. Previous phubbing research has explored possible moderator effects of relationship length and relationship satisfaction on the link between partner phubbing and\ndepression (Wang et al., 2017). Partner phubbing was a significantly greater risk factor for depression only for married couples over seven years. Partner phubbing was also indirectly associated with depression, depending on relationship satisfaction levels. Despite the fact that the majority of our sample was in a committed relationship or married and a significant association between partner phubbing and lower relationship satisfaction was found, we failed to replicate any previously shown associations with depressive symptoms. Likewise, being phubbed did not seem to factor into participants\u2019 self-esteem or anxious mood levels. These non-significant findings may be due to the nature of the personal well-being items. Items such as \u201cnot being able to stop or control worrying\u201d and \u201clittle interest or pleasure in doing things\u201d may be too extreme to be elicited by being phubbed."

            "text": "Our second research question assessed how phubbees responded to perceived partner phubbing. Findings partially supported our initial prediction, implying that daily perception of partner phubbing was associated with greater phubbee curiosity and resentment. It was not, however, associated with increased conflict (i.e., expressing unhappiness and arguing) or ignoring partner\u2019s actions. Findings did, however, support our main novel prediction, suggesting that daily perception of partner phubbing was associated with greater tit-for-tat retaliation from the phubbee. This suggests that partner phubbing may elicit a variety of responses from those at the receiving end. These individuals may express more interest in what their partner is looking at, hold resentment for partner\u2019s inattention, or ultimately phub their partner back. Effects of daily partner phubbing may, however, not be strong enough to evoke conflict within the relationship. This may also explain why partner phubbing was not associated with personal wellbeing, as participants may report a mix of emotional reactions (e.g., anger, curiosity, resentment) and retaliate in the moment but not internalise such issues for it to significantly affect personal well-being.\nOur final research question aimed to extend our understanding of reported phubbee tit-for-tat retaliation behaviour. We aimed to understand, for the first time, motivations behind retaliating against partner phubbing. Proposed motivations included revenge, boredom, a need for support and a need for approval from others. Perceived partner phubbing was positively associated with all assessed motivations, except boredom.\nFrom a theoretical perspective (Hatfield & Traupmann, 1981), phubbing indicates unequal investment of resources (i.e., time and attention) towards the relationship. The phubbing recipient may work to match this level of investment. In the current context, this may have involved engaging in tit-for-tat retaliation behaviour to maintain equity in the relationship. Understanding what motivates the recipient of phubbing to phub their partner is important for understanding the nature of phubbing behaviour. Phubbing begins when one\u2019s partner chooses to disengage from the current in-person interaction, marking them as the phubber. The phubbee may perceive this as a lack of attention and choose to phub them in return. As suggested in the present study, this may be motivated by revenge i.e., the desire for their partner to feel how they themselves felt, thus maintaining equity in the relationship. On the other hand, it may be that individuals look to seek social support or approval from others via their smartphones instead of their partner. Despite some previous findings implying phubbing occurs as a means to dispel boredom (Al-Saggaf et al., 2019) and boredom being reported by participants as the strongest motivator, we found no significant associations with daily perceptions of partner phubbing.\nAlthough there may be various motivators for retaliatory phubbing, findings suggest partner phubbing operates as a vicious cycle. This may explain why, over time, phubbing is associated with several negative outcomes (i.e., relationship dissatisfaction, increased anger, resentment and tit-for-tat retaliation). It is important to note, however, that several outcomes of perceived partner phubbing were not detrimental to the\nT.T. Thomas et al.\nComputers in Human Behavior 137 (2022) 107398\nphubbee. There was no significant effect on phubbees\u2019 personal wellbeing. Similarly, some individuals responded to partner phubbing by simply asking their partner what they were looking at. By doing so, they may have mitigated any conflict from occurring (Beukeboom & Pollmann, 2021). ."

Whilst this has formed a solid foundation for our understanding of phubbing and technoference, it is beneficial to explore the outcomes of partner phubbing using daily reports. Few phubbing studies have adopted the daily diary approach (e. g., McDaniel & Drouin, 2019). Utilizing the daily diary design meant we were able to assess outcomes of partner phubbing at both an individual (within-persons) and group (between-persons) level across multiple time-points. Secondly, student samples seemed to be the primary demographic of previous phubbing literature (e.g., Aagaard, 2020; Chotpitayasunondh & Douglas, 2018; Krasnova et al., 2016; McDaniel & Wesselmann, 2021; Nazir, 2017). As romantic relationships impact individuals at all stages in life, use of undergraduate/student samples limits the generalizability of any conclusions made. Thus, the present study addresses this limitation. A final and core strength of the current study is its exploration of responses to and retaliation against partner phubbing. Although research has explored various emotional and behavioural responses to phubbing (e.g., Aagaard, 2020; Krasnova et al., 2016; Nazir, 2017), we have explored this in further depth using a longitudinal approach and assessing tit-for-tit retaliation in particular. Furthermore, we have delved into possible motivations for phubbee tit-for-tat retaliation, a novel contribution to the current phubbing literature."

            "heading": "4.4. Limitations and future directions",
            "text": "There are some limitations to this study, however. Firstly, reliance on self-report measures increases the chance of social-desirability bias. Individuals may not have reported their daily emotional responses or motivations for retaliation truthfully. Alternatively, individuals may have reported dissatisfaction or anger due to other existing problems in the relationship which cannot be attributed to phubbing. A social desirability measure should be included in future research to address this (e.g., Hart et al., 2015). Use of self-report measures also means directionality of associations cannot be accurately inferred. It may be that participants perceive greater partner phubbing when they are already angry or feeling dissatisfied that day. Therefore, findings here cannot make any causal claims regarding the relationship between perceived partner phubbing and subsequent outcomes for the phubbee. A mixed methods approach may be able to partially address this limitation. By incorporating open ended qualitative questions, researchers would be able to disentangle emotional and behavioural consequences due to partner phubbing from other actions displayed by one\u2019s partner. Secondly, variables measured within the present study were only assessed from the phubbees\u2019 perspective. Longitudinal dyadic data from both individuals in the relationship would allow for a better holistic understanding of perceptions and outcomes of partner phubbing (Laurenceau & Bolger, 2012). Finally, marginal and conditional R2 values of effect size suggest greater variance was explained by both fixed and random effects rather than fixed effects alone. Some variables, despite being statistically significant, yielded small effect sizes."

            "text": "Sharing one\u2019s phone usage with a partner may mitigate any negative outcomes of phubbing (Beukeboom & Pollmann, 2021). When individuals were given an important reason by a confederate partner for\nphubbing, they reported lower feelings of exclusion compared to individuals who were given a trivial reason for phubbing (McDaniel & Wesselmann, 2021). An example of this would be the phubber communicating that they were replying to an important email with no direct intention for making their partner feel ignored. The phubbee may then be able to rationalize their perceptions of partner phubbing, mitigating its impact on relationship satisfaction and mood. Partner phubbing, within the present study, was associated with neutral responses (curiosity) as well as negative responses (anger, dissatisfaction, resentment, retaliation) from the recipient. Understanding how phubbing consequences can be mitigated may be especially important for couples hoping to adopt healthier relationship dynamics.\nThe present study also has implications for the current phubbing literature base. One\u2019s partner may indeed respond negatively towards exclusion and unresponsiveness from smartphone-related interruptions (Chotpitayasunondh & Douglas, 2018). Some findings relating to phubbing effects on relationship satisfaction and low mood remain consistent with previous literature (Chotpitayasunondh & Douglas, 2018; Kelly et al., 2017). Partner\u2019s inability to disengage from technology did not, however, influence relational conflict nor phubbees\u2019 individual well-being. Therefore, outcomes of being phubbed remain mixed: Phubbees do perceive lack of attention in face-to-face interactions negatively, but this may not have a significant long-lasting impact on the phubbee or the relationship."

Phubbee responses towards partner\u2019s phubbing (curiosity, resentment, conflict, ignoring, retaliating) and possible motives for tit-for-tat retaliation (boredom, revenge, support-seeking, approvalseeking) were also explored in this study. Interestingly, partner phubbing was significantly associated with the following phubbee responses: curiosity, resentment, and tit-for-tat retaliation. Partner phubbing has no significant effect on phubbees ignoring behaviour or creating conflict. Possible motivations for phubbee retaliation, albeit speculative, included using own phone as a means for revenge, support-seeking, or approval seeking. By exploring the consequences of excessive smartphone use, we were able to replicate some or challenge other findings of the existing phubbing literature. To our knowledge, we are the first to explore various retaliatory responses to phubbing using daily diary methods.\nCredit author statement\nTessa T.
