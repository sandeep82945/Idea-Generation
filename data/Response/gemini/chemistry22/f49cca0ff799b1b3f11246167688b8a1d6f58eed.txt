1. **Investigate the effect of different sintering atmospheres on the properties of Cu@Ag NMPs-filled microvias.** The current study used a 5%H2 + 95%Ar atmosphere for sintering. However, other atmospheres, such as pure nitrogen or pure hydrogen, may also be suitable. By investigating the effect of different sintering atmospheres, it may be possible to further improve the properties of the filled microvias.


2. **Explore the use of different Cu@Ag NMPs compositions.** The current study used Cu@Ag NMPs with a core-shell structure. However, it is also possible to synthesize Cu@Ag NMPs with other compositions, such as a multilayer structure or a gradient structure. By exploring the use of different Cu@Ag NMPs compositions, it may be possible to further improve the properties of the filled microvias.


3. **Investigate the effect of different particle sizes on the properties of Cu@Ag NMPs-filled microvias.** The current study used Cu@Ag NMPs with an average size of 0.8 Âµm. However, it is also possible to synthesize Cu@Ag NMPs with different sizes. By investigating the effect of different particle sizes, it may be possible to further improve the properties of the filled microvias.


4. **Explore the use of Cu@Ag NMPs in other applications.** The current study focused on the use of Cu@Ag NMPs in microvia filling. However, Cu@Ag NMPs may also be useful in other applications, such as printed electronics, sensors, and batteries. By exploring the use of Cu@Ag NMPs in other applications, it may be possible to further develop their potential.


5. **Investigate the long-term reliability of Cu@Ag NMPs-filled microvias.** The current study did not investigate the long-term reliability of Cu@Ag NMPs-filled microvias. However, it is important to understand how these microvias will perform over time. By investigating the long-term reliability of Cu@Ag NMPs-filled microvias, it will be possible to assess their suitability for use in real-world applications.
