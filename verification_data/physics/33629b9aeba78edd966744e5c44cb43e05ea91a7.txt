"The degradation mechanism of the different systems was inferred from the quenching experiments of free radicals and the detection of zeta potential, and it was found that the main free radicals of the anionic dyes in the different synergistic systems were exactly opposite, which might be related to the acidity and basicity of the dyes themselves, which are yet to be explored."
