Due to the non-perturbative nature of the strong interaction in low-energy region, atomic nuclei are usually modeled in terms of nucleon degrees of freedom instead. Therefore, the symmetries of atomic nuclei are determined by the Hamiltonian composed of nucleon-nucleon interactions. Like those of many macroscopic systems, nuclear Hamiltonian possesses the symmetries associated with geometric transformations in space-time coordinates, including translational and rotational symmetries, and space-inversion invariance. Furthermore, atomic nucleus is a quantum many-body system that is also characterized by the symmetries defined in abstract spaces, such as the spin and isospin symmetries as proposed by Wigner Wigner (1937) and the rotation invariance in Fock space corresponding to particle-number conservation. The exploration of these symmetries and their mathematical representations is essential to modeling atomic nuclei as it pro-\nJ. M.

The latter will be the main focus of this Chapter.\nThe exact solution to a nuclear many-body problem is computational challenging. One of the important approaches to atomic nuclei is the interacting shell model which represents nuclear wave function as a superposition of all possible symmetryconserving configurations. The shell model has achieved great success in understanding the structure of atomic nuclei, but its applicability has been strongly limited by the exponential growth of the number of configurations with nucleon numbers. To mitigate the computational challenge, symmetry techniques can be exploited to optimize model space for atomic nuclei with strong collective correlations Launey et al. (2016). Alternatively, symmetry has also been exploited to describe atomic nuclei in terms of collective degrees of freedoms, such as the collective models Bohr (1976); Mottelson (1976) developed by Bohr and Mottelson, and the interacting boson model Arima and Iachello (1975) developed by Arima and Iachello. In the former, the nuclear Hamiltonian is constructed in terms of collective coordinates characterizing certain shapes of the nuclear surface preserving the corresponding geometrical symmetries. In the latter, the Hamiltonian is constructed based on the algebra of symmetry group in terms of interacting bosons of different ranks which are composite operators for pairs of correlated nucleons. These two methods have turned out to be very successful in describing a wide variety of nuclear properties, especially nuclear spectroscopy of vibration and rotation excitations.\nThe content of this Chapter will be mainly about another type of nuclear models starting from the reference state of a mean-field calculation. Mean-field approximation has been frequently employed in modeling quantum many-body systems. An atomic nucleus is no exception. In this approximation, the atomic nucleus is described as a bound system of independent nucleons trapped in a mean-field potential determined self-consistently by themselves. The nuclear wave function becomes a single Slater determinant of single-particle or quasiparticle basis functions Meng et al. (2006), and the many-body problem is reduced to an effective one-body problem that can be easily solved. It turns out that this simplified nuclear wave function is often incapable of simultaneously describing essential correlations of an atomic nucleus and also satisfying the conservation laws. Therefore, certain conservation law is allowed to be violated in the mean-field potential to incorporate more correlations. In this case, the state of the system is referred to as a state of broken symmetry, and it is described by the wave function that does not possess corresponding quantum numbers. The use of such a symmetry-breaking wave function for atomic nucleus suffers from some drawbacks as the interpretation of nuclear spectroscopic data becomes obscure. To solve this problem, symmetry-restoration methods are introduced to recover missing quantum numbers. This strategy is the core idea of the symmetryprojected generator coordinate method (PGCM), in which the nuclear wave function is constructed as a linear combination of non-orthogonal basis functions that are projected out from \u201cdeformed\u201d mean-field wave functions Bender et al. (2003). Following this idea, many advanced nuclear models have been established, including the multi-reference energy-density-functional (MR-EDF) method Niks\u030cic\u0301 et al.\n(2011); Egido (2016); Robledo et al. (2019), Monte-Carlo shell model (MCSM) Otsuka et al. (2001) and the projected shell model (PSM) based on either a schematic pairing-plus-qudrupole Hamiltonian Hara and Sun (1995), or the effective interaction derived from a covariant density functional theory Zhao et al. (2016); Wang et al. (2022). These methods have been frequently employed to interpret nuclear spectroscopic data in different mass regions. A detailed introduction to symmetry breaking in nuclear mean fields and the restoration of broken symmetries with projection techniques can be found in textbooks Ring and Schuck (1980); Blaizot and Ripka (1986), and in the recent review papers Sheikh et al. (2021); Yao et al. (2022) and the references therein. Recently, this idea has also been implemented into ab initio studies of atomic nuclei based on the many-body expansion methods, including the symmetry broken and restored coupled-cluster theory Duguet (2015); Duguet and Signoracci (2017); Signoracci et al. (2015); Hagen et al. (2022), in-medium generator coordinate method (IM-GCM) Yao et al. (2018, 2020) \u2013 a new variant of multi-reference in-medium similarity renormalization group method Hergert et al. (2016), and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) Frosini et al. (2021a,b,c).\nThis Chapter provides a pedagogical introduction to the symmetries of nuclear Hamiltonian that are allowed to be broken in nuclear mean-field potentials to incorporate many-body correlations, with special emphasis on the methods that have been frequently employed to restore these broken symmetries to achieve an accurate description of nuclear-structure and decay properties. Some illustrative applications to selected nuclear-structure problems are also discussed. The frontier and recent exciting progress in modeling atomic nuclei based on symmetry techniques are briefly mentioned."

            "text": "Let us start with the basic knowledge of symmetry and group theory. Considering a set of transformations G = {e\u0302, g\u03021, g\u03022,\u22ef}, the set G forms a group if the following conditions are fulfilled for all the elements gi belonging to the group Stancu (1996); Frank et al. (2009)\nidentity \u2236 e\u0302g\u0302i = g\u0302ie\u0302 = g\u0302i, (1a)\ninverse \u2236 g\u0302ig\u22121i = e\u0302, (1b) closure \u2236 g\u0302ig\u0302 j = g\u0302 \u2208G, (1c)\nassociativity \u2236 (g\u0302ig\u0302 j)g\u0302k = g\u0302i(g\u0302 jg\u0302k). (1d)\nIn the group G, the element e\u0302 is the unity or identity element, and g\u0302\u22121i is the inverse of the element g\u0302i. The group G is called a finite group if the number of the element is finite, and this number is called the order of the finite group. There are also groups with an infinite number of elements. These groups can be either the discrete groups of infinite order or the continuous groups. For the latter, the group\nelement denoted as R\u0302(\u03d5) depends on a finite set of continously varying parameters \u03d5 = {\u03d51,\u03d52,\u22ef,\u03d5r}.\nIn quantum mechanics, group theory offers a systematic way of finding the properties of eigenstates under various transformation from the symmetries of Hamiltonian. The eigenstates form linear spaces providing matrix representations of the group transformations G. Specifically, for the Hamiltonian H\u03020 of a quantum system which is invariant under the transformations g\u0302, one has\n[g\u0302,H\u03020] = 0, \u2200g\u0302 \u2208G. (2)\nConsidering a linear space L composed of N orthonormal basis states {\u2223\u03a61\u27e9, \u2223\u03a62\u27e9, \u22ef, \u2223\u03a6N\u27e9}, any group element g\u0302 acting on the states induces a N \u00d7N matrix D ji(g), i.e.,\ng\u0302\u2223\u03a6i\u27e9 = N\n\u2211 j=1\nD ji(g)\u2223\u03a6 j\u27e9 \u2208 L, for \u2200\u2223\u03a6i\u27e9 \u2208 L, and \u2200g\u0302 \u2208G, (3)\nwhere the indices i, j run from 1 to N. The N \u00d7N matrices D(g) with the element determined by D ji(g) = \u27e8\u03a6 j \u2223 g\u0302 \u2223\u03a6i\u27e9 preserve the multiplicative structure of the group G and form a matrix representation of the group. The group G can have a different matrix representation denoted as D\u2032(g) if a different linear space L\u2032 is employed. If the two representations D(g) and D\u2032(g) are connected by a similarity transformation X for all the group elements, these two representations are called equivalent. By applying different similarity transformations X(i), one can generate many equivalent representations D(i), among which, if there is one with the following form,\nX\u22121D(g)X = [ D\u03bb1(g) T 12(g)\n0 D\u03bb2(g) ] , for \u2200g\u0302 \u2208G, (4)\nthen, the representation D(g) is called reducible. The block matrices D\u03bb1(g) and D\u03bb2(g) are two square matrices with dimensions d\u03bb1 and d\u03bb2 , respectively. It indicates that there is a subspace L1 \u2282 L, \u2200\u2223\u03a6\u03bb1l \u27e9 \u2208 L\n1 is transformed into another state g\u0302\u2223\u03a6\u03bb1l \u27e9 which also belongs to the subspace, and this is true for all the transformations of the group, namely,\ng\u0302\u2223\u03a6\u03bb1l \u27e9 =\u2211 k D\u03bb1kl (g)\u2223\u03a6 \u03bb1 k \u27e9, for \u2200g\u0302 \u2208G. (5)\nThe subspace L1 fulfilling the above requirement is called invariant subspace. Furthermore, if the matrix T 12(g) = 0 in (4), the representation D(g) is called fully reducible. In this case, the full L space can be written as a sum of two invariant subspaces L = L1\u2295L2 and the representation\nD(g) =D\u03bb1(g)\u2295D\u03bb2(g). (6)\nThis property has been frequently exploited to split a large Hilbert space into a set of independent subspaces with smaller dimensions. The representation D\u03bb (g) is called\nirreducible if there is no similarity transformation which brings the matrices D\u03bb (g) into block diagonal form simultaneously for \u2200g\u0302 \u2208 G. The irreducible representation is sometimes abbreviated as irrep for brevity. It is worth mentioning that an irrep of one full group may be reducible for its subgroup. For example, the spherical harmonics Y`m with m = \u2212`,\u22ef,` forms an invariant subspace of 2`+1 dimension for the rotational group SO(3) with the irrep of D`(g), which is however reducible for the subgroup SO(2) related to the rotation R\u0302z(\u03d5) in two dimensional space (along z-axis)\nR\u0302z(\u03d5) = e\u2212i\u03d5L\u0302z , L\u0302z = \u2212ih\u0335 d\nd\u03d5 . (7)\nIn other words, the irrep of D`(Rz) can be further reduced into a block diagonal form\nD`(Rz) = [ eim\u03d5 0\n0 e\u2212im\u03d5 ] , \u2200R\u0302z(\u03d5) \u2208 SO(2). (8)\nThe basis functions form multiplets of the orbital angular momentum, each of which constitutes a one-dimension irreducible invariant subspace for the SO(2) group.\nIf the group G is a finite group or a compact Lie group like the orthogonal group O(n) and the unitary group U(n), it can be proven that any matrix representation of the group G is equivalent to a unitary representation Stancu (1996) in which the matrices are unitary for all group elements. Supposing D\u03bbi j(g) and D \u03bb \u2032 i j (g) are two unitary irreps of the group element R\u0302(g), where the matrix element is determined by\nD\u03bb(\u03bb \u2032 ) kl (g) = \u27e8\u03a6 \u03bb(\u03bb \u2032) k \u2223g\u0302\u2223\u03a6 \u03bb(\u03bb \u2032) l \u27e9, (9)\nwith the indices k, l running from 1 to d\u03bb , one has the orthogonality relation\n1 nG \u2a0b dgD \u03bb kl(g)[D \u03bb \u2032 k\u2032l\u2032(g)] \u2217 = 0, (10)\nfor non-equivalent representations and\n1 nG \u2a0b dgD \u03bb kl(g)[D \u03bb \u2032 k\u2032l\u2032(g)] \u2217 = \u03b4\u03bb\u03bb \u2032 d\u03bb Xkk\u2032X \u22121 l\u2032l , (11)\nfor equivalent representations. The symbol \u2a0b dg stands for the summation or integral over all the elements of the group G, and nG is the order (the number of elements or the volume) of the group, d\u03bb is the dimension of the irrep, and X is the similarity transformation which connects the two irreps of D\u03bb and D\u03bb \u2032 . If the two irreps are identical, then the similarity transformation is just a unity matrix, i.e., X = 1.\nSymmetry breaking in mean-field approximations\nSymmetries can be classified according to the order of the groups, including the symmetries associated with discrete groups (such as parity, charge conjugation, time reversal, permutation symmetry) consisting of a finite number of group elements, and the symmetries associated with continuous groups (such as translations and rotations symmetries in space-time or gauge angle coordinate system) consisting of an infinite number (continuum) of elements. According to Noether\u2019s theorem Noether (1971), any continuous symmetry of the action (Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) of a physical system with conservative forces has a corresponding conservation law. The above-mentioned symmetries imply the conservation of total momentum (energy), angular momentum, and particle numbers in atomic nuclei, respectively. On the other hand, symmetries can also be classified according to the space where the symmetries are defined, including the symmetries defined in the space-time coordinate system and the symmetries defined in abstract Hilbert spaces.\nThe symmetry of a physical system could be broken explicitly or spontaneously. The former is due to the presence of an additional interaction term that is not invariant under the symmetry transformation, such as the isospin SU(2) symmetry in atomic nuclei which breaks into SO(2) symmetry. These symmetries are called dynamical symmetries in the sense that the nuclear Hamiltonian breaks the symmetries but preserves the symmetries defined by their subgroups Frank et al. (2009). The breaking of this type of symmetries in atomic nuclei is not necessary to be restored as it is determined by the nature of nuclear force. In the latter case, the Hamiltonian is kept to be invariant under the symmetry transformation, but the physical state chooses one of the multiple degenerate (ground) states which are not the eigenstates of (but connected by) the generator operator of the symmetry group. This spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon could be caused by the presence of external perturbations and the thermodynamic limit. In fact, any other choice of the solutions would have exactly the same energy, which for continous symmetry implies the existence of a massless Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson. The spontaneous symmetry breaking usually happens in infinite systems studied in condensed matter or high-energy physics, such as the superconductors, ferromagnets, and the Higgs mechanism that generates the masses of elementary particles Brauner (2010). In nuclear physics, the atomic nucleus is a finite system, for which, the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking arises only as a result of approximations. That is, if the nuclear many-body problem is solved exactly, symmetry should not be broken in nuclear states. This is exactly the reason why one needs to restore the symmetries broken by the employed approximations in nuclear models.\nIn the self-consistent mean-field approaches, such as Hartree-Fock (HF) or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB), a single Slater determinant is chosen as the trial wave function of an atomic nucleus which is determined with the variational principle, that is, the minimization of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian to the wave function. The variational principle which guarantees the solution corresponding to the local energy minimum within the restricted Hilbert space cannot ensure the symmetry structure of the Hamiltonian. As a result, the symmetries of a given nuclear\nHamiltonian are not fully retained in the solutions. If one constrains the solution to preserve a certain symmetry throughout the variational calculation, one may end up with a solution that does not incorporate sufficient correlations of atomic nuclei and cannot achieve a satisfying description of nuclear basic quantities, such as binding energies. Therefore, the mean-field approaches which allow for the breaking of the symmetries of the Hamiltonian in the mean-field potentials (also referred to as symmetry-breaking mechanism) during the variational procedure have been widely employed in nuclear physics. One of the celebrated successes of these symmetrybreaking mean-field approaches is shown in the description of nuclear deformation and pairing correlations Ring and Schuck (1980).\nIn molecular physics, an interplay between degenerate electronic states (singleparticle motions) and a molecular vibration (collective motions) gives rise to a spontaneous breaking of a molecular symmetry. This is the so-called Jahn-Teller effect Jahn and Teller (1937), which turns out to be a general feature of quantum many-body systems induced by a linear coupling between their microscopic and collective degrees of freedom Reinhard and Otten (1984). In open-shell nuclei, the degeneracy of eigenvalues of a (spherical) nuclear single-particle Hamiltonian around the Fermi level leads to the solution unstable with respect to shape vibrations. Additional correlation energies can be gained if the degeneracy of the singleparticle Hamiltonian is lifted by allowing the breaking of the symmetry. As a result, a \u201cdeformed\u201d solution emerges in the variational calculation.\nThe obtained wave function \u03a6(r1,\u22ef,rA;q) abbreviated as \u03a6(q) of a A-body nuclear system from for instance the HFB approach can be generally labeled with a set of collective coordinates denoted with the symbol q, see Fig. 1(a), which includes for instance the pairing amplitude \u03ba or particle-number fluctuation,\n\u2206N2 \u2261 \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223(N\u0302 \u2212N0)2 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 , \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223N\u0302 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 =N0, (12)\nand the dimensionless multiple deformation parameters,\n\u03b2\u03bb \u00b5 = 4\u03c0\n3AR\u03bb \u2211 i j\n(Q\u03bb \u00b5)i j \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223a \u2020 i a j \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 , (13)\nwhere the particle-number operator N\u0302 =\u2211i c \u2020 i ci with c \u2020 i ,ci being the single-particle creation and annihilation operators in a certain basis, respectively, and the multipole moment tensor operator Q\u03bb \u00b5 = r\u03bbY\u03bb \u00b5 . The nuclear size R = 1.2A1/3 fm, with A being the mass number of the nucleus. The value of \u00b5 = \u2212\u03bb ,\u2212\u03bb +1, . . . ,\u03bb . The onset of nonzero value of pairing amplitude \u03ba or \u2206N2 is the result of the mixture of single-particle creation and annihilation operators, leading to the violation of gauge rotation symmetry described by the U(1) group which will be introduced in detail later. Fig. 1(b) displays some cartoon pictures for nuclear shapes characterized by the deformation parameter \u03b2\u03bb \u00b5 .\n\u2022 The spherical shape corresponds to \u03b2\u03bb \u00b5 = 0 for all values of \u03bb ,\u00b5 . \u2022 The positive and negative value of \u03b220 corresponds to prolate and oblate de-\nformed shapes, respectively. Nuclear triaxiality is defined by the nonzero value\nof \u03b222. The occurrence of a nonzero quadrupole deformation \u03b22\u00b5 induces the mixture of single-particle states with different angular momentum, leading to the violation of rotational SO(3) symmetry \u2013 a special orthogonal group in three dimensions. \u2022 If the \u03b23\u00b5 \u2260 0 for \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9, the density distribution of the solution \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 has a reflection-asymmetric shape. The occurrence of nonzero octupole moments induces the mixture of single-particle states with positive and negative parities. The resultant wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 is thus not an eigenstate of the parity operator P\u0302.\nTherefore, the wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 from the mean-field calculations usually mixes different irreps \u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u27e9 of symmetry groups that may include the gauge U(1) symmetry, the rotational SO(3) symmetry, the space-reversal Z2 symmetry, etc. Thus, the mean-field wave function can be generally decomposed as follows,\n\u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 =\u2211 \u03b1 c\u03b1(q)\u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u27e9 . (14)\nwhere the symbol \u03b1 = {JNZ\u03c0,\u22ef} stands for a set of quantum numbers, such as angular momentum J, particle numbers (N,Z), parity \u03c0 , etc. The methods to extract the component \u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u27e9 with the correct quantum numbers \u03b1 will be introduced subsequently."

(16)\nThis is essentially the basic idea of the generator coordinate method (GCM) Hill and Wheeler (1953), and the rotation parameter \u03d5 can be interpreted as a generator coordinate which generates the wave functions in different orientations. The use of the trial wave function in (16) with the unknown expansion coefficient F\u03b1(\u03d5) as the variational parameter is equivalent to the projection of the states with good symmetry Blaizot and Ripka (1986). It will be shown later that the F\u03b1(\u03d5) can be derived analytically from the group theory which defines the so-called projection operator.\nThis procedure can be carried out in two different schemes. In the projectionafter-variation (PAV) scheme, both the mean-field wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 and the coefficient F\u03b1(\u03d5) are changing simultaneously to search for the minimum of the energy expectation to the symmetry-projected wave function \u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u27e9. In contrast, the wave function \u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u27e9 in the variation-after-projection (VAP) scheme is extracted from the mean-field wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 determined after the variational calculation. In other words, the variation of \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 and F\u03b1(\u03d5) is carried out sequentially. The parameter space in the VAP is generally larger than that in the PAV, thus the VAP is expect to provide a closer-to-exact solution. In particular, the VAP scheme can prevent the occurrence of sharp phase transition in the mean-field solution of atomic nuclei due to the artificial symmetry breaking Mang et al. (1976); Ring and Schuck (1980). However, the VAP scheme is more computation demanding and is thus frequently employed for parity and particle-number projections, scarcely for angular momentum projection.\nIn many applications, the wave function by either the PAV or VAP scheme provides a good starting point of a more advanced nuclear model. According to GCM, nuclear wave function is constructed as a linear superposition of all the symmetry-\nprojected wave functions \u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u27e9,\n\u2223\u03a8\u03b1\u27e9 = \u222b dq f\u03b1(q)\u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u27e9 . (17)\nHere the collective coordinate q is the generator coordinate which is integrated out and does not appear in the final GCM wave function. The coefficient f\u03b1(q), also known as collective wave function or generator function, is determined by the variational principle which leads to the following integral equation, referred to as Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation Hill and Wheeler (1953); Griffin and Wheeler (1957),\n\u222b dq\u2032 \u23a1 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a3 \u27e8\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u2223H\u0302 \u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q\u2032)\u27e9\u2212E\u03b1 \u27e8\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q\u2032)\u27e9 \u23a4 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a6 f\u03b1(q\u2032) = 0. (18)\nIt is worth pointing out that the projected wave functions \u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u27e9 do not form an orthogonal basis and thus the weights f\u03b1 are not orthogonal functions. In most cases, the function g\u03b1(q) is introduced as follows,\ng\u03b1(q) = \u222b dq\u2032 [\u27e8\u03a6\u03b1(q)\u2223\u03a6\u03b1(q\u2032)\u27e9] 1/2 f\u03b1(q\u2032), \u222b dq\u2223g\u03b1(q)\u22232 = 1, (19)\nwhich fulfills the normalization condition, and reflects how configurations mix in the GCM wave function \u2223\u03a8\u03b1\u27e9.\nTo distinguish the procedure of only performing a symmetry-restoration calculation with projection operators (even though this procedure also belongs to GCM) from the procedure of also mixing the projected wave functions with different collective coordinate q, the former procedure is referred to as symmetry restoration or projection, while the latter procedure is called symmetry-projected GCM (PGCM)."

There are two irreps P\u0302\u03c6(r) = \u03c6(\u2212r) = \u03c0\u03c6(r), where the eigenvalue \u03c0 =\u00b1 corresponds to even or odd parity, respectively. In atomic nuclei, parity is conserved in the strong interaction and thus it serves as one of the quantum numbers used to label nuclear states. In atomic nuclei of some particular mass regions with neutron or proton numbers around 34, 56, 88, and 134, the negative-parity states of vibration or rotation excitations are observed near their ground states. This phenomenon can be naturally explained in mean-field approaches that the onset of large octupole correlations is attributed to the existence of pairs of single-particle states with opposite parities around the Fermi surface such as g9/2\u2212 p3/2, h11/2\u2212d5/2 and i13/2\u2212 f7/2, j15/2\u2212g9/2 which are strongly coupled by octupole moments Butler and Nazarewicz (1996). The emergence of nonzero moments of odd multiplicity such as octupole moments induces the mixing of the states with different parity. As a result, the obtained nuclear wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 does not have a definite parity. According to (28), the normalized wave function with a definite parity \u03c0 can be recovered by projecting out one of the two irreps with a parity-projection operator,\n\u2223\u03a6\u03c0(q)\u27e9 = 1\n\u221a \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223 P\u0302\u03c0 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9\nP\u0302\u03c0 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 , (32)\nwhere the parity-projection operator P\u0302\u03c0 is defined as\nP\u0302\u03c0 \u2261 1 2 \u239b \u239d 1+\u03c0P\u0302 \u239e \u23a0 , (P\u0302\u03c0)2 = P\u0302\u03c0 .

Alternatively, one can define a many-body operator P\u0302 = exp(i\u03c0N\u0302\u2212) Egido and Robledo (1991) for the space-reversal operator P\u0302 , where the operator N\u0302\u2212 =\u2211\u2032k c \u2020 kck is similar to the particle-number operator, but with the summation over all the k restricted to the single-particle states with negative parity only.

This is a local transformation in the sense that the symmetry transformation is related to pairing vibration in which nucleon number A\u03c4 serves as the differentiate coordinate for the dynamics of the pairing vibration in the nuclear system.

The wave function \u2223\u03a6A\u03c4 \u27e9 forms an irrep of the group.\nSimilar to electrons in a superconducting metal, nucleons inside an atomic nucleus also exhibit pairing correlations, as supported by many evidences including the odd-even staggering of binding energies and the energy gap in the low-lying energy spectra of atomic nuclei Bohr et al. (1958). This pairing correlation can be excellently described with the BCS or HFB theory in terms of a quasiparticle vacuum state \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 which is constructed as an admixture of wave functions with different nucleon numbers. In other words, the obtained wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 is a\nsuperposition of different irreps of the U(1) group usually differing from each other by two nucleons. The use of this particle-number-violating wave function for an atomic nucleus may cause serious problems as it contains the component of neighbouring atomic nuclei. Some of these problems can be remedied with the help of particle-number projection (PNP) operator P\u0302A\u03c4 which can project out the component \u2223\u03a6A\u03c4 (q)\u27e9 with the particle number A\u03c4 ,\n\u2223\u03a6A\u03c4 (q)\u27e9 = 1\n\u221a \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223 P\u0302A\u03c4 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9\nP\u0302A\u03c4 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 , (37)\nwhere the particle-number projection operator is defined according to (24),\nP\u0302A\u03c4 = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03d5e\u2212i\u03d5A\u03c4 R\u0302(\u03d5).

The above integration can be carried out using the trapezoidal rule based on the Fomenko expansion method Fomenko (1970) in which the particle-number\nprojection operator becomes\nP\u0302A\u03c4 = 1 L\nL\n\u2211 m=1\nei(A\u0302\u03c4\u2212A\u03c4)\u03d5m , \u03d5m = m L \u03c0, (43)\nwhere the gauge angle \u03d5\u03c4 \u2208 [0,\u03c0] is discretized with L points. In atomic nuclei, the wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 is smeared out only a few particle numbers around its mean value, only a small value of L is sufficient to achieve a rather exact projection. Typically, the odd value of L = 7 or 9 is employed to avoid the singularity problem of choosing the point \u03d5 = \u03c0/2 Tajima et al. (1992); Donau (1998); Anguiano et al. (2001).\nAn alternative way to evaluate the integral over the gauge angle \u03d5\u03c4 is to carry out the integration analytically using the residues theorem, as employed by Dietrich et al. Dietrich et al. (1964). The projection operator P\u0302A\u03c4 in (38) can be rewritten in terms of a complex variable z = ei\u03d5\nP\u0302A\u03c4 = 1 2\u03c0i \u222e zA\u0302\u03c4 zA\u03c4+1 dz. (44)\nThe projected wave function becomes\n\u2223\u03a6A\u03c4 (q)\u27e9 = P\u0302 A\u03c4=2p \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 = 1 2\u03c0i \u222e d\u03b6 \u03b6 p+1 \u03c4 \u220f k=1 (uk +vk\u03b6 a+k a + k )\u2223\u2212\u27e9, (45)\nwhere the variable z has been replaced by \u03b6 = z2. The p = A\u03c4/2 is the number of pairs. The integration just picks the component with \u03b6\u22121, that is, the component with p pairs.\nThe advantage of using the residue theorem is that it provides an analytical way to explore the structural properties of particle-number projected wave functions. Besides, the variation after particle-number projection (PNVAP) can be carried in a similar way to the ordinary variational calculation Dietrich et al. (1964). Compared to the Fomenko expansion, the downside of this method is that it becomes difficult to be implemented in combination with the projection operators of other symmetries, like the rotational symmetry described by the SO(3) group."

(47b)\nThe component \u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 can be obtained by applying an angular-momentum projection (AMP) operator P\u0302JMM onto the symmetry-violating wave function. The AMP operator P\u0302JMM can be constructed as a product of two projection operators defined according to the Lo\u0308wdin\u2019s method Lo\u0308wdin (1964),\nP\u0302JMM =\u220f I\u2260J J\u03022\u2212 I(I+1) J(J+1)\u2212 I(I+1) \u220f K\u2260M J\u0302z\u2212K M\u2212K . (48)\nFrom Eqs. (46) and (48), one immediately finds\nP\u0302JMM \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 = cJM \u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 .

(1988)\nR\u0302(\u2126) = e\u2212i\u03b1 J\u0302z e\u2212i\u03b2 J\u0302ye\u2212i\u03b3 J\u0302z . (51)\nThe irrep of the SO(3) group is the Wigner-D function,\nDJMK(\u2126) = \u27e8\u03a6JM \u2223R\u0302(\u2126)\u2223\u03a6JK\u27e9 = e \u2212iM\u03b1 dJMK(\u03b2)e \u2212iK\u03b3 , (52)\nwhere the small d-function is defined as dJMK(\u03b2) = \u27e8\u03a6JM \u2223e \u2212i\u03b2 J\u0302y \u2223\u03a6JM\u27e9.

(54)\nThus, the operator P\u0302JMK can also be written as\nP\u0302JMK =\u2211 \u03c3 \u2223\u03a6\u03c3JM\u27e9\u27e8\u03a6 \u03c3 JK \u2223, (55)\nwhere \u03c3 characterizes all quantum numbers besides the J,M required to completely specify the states. From the above one arrives at the following relation\nP\u0302JMKP\u0302 J\u2032 M\u2032K\u2032 = \u03b4JJ\u2032\u03b4KM\u2032 P\u0302 J MK\u2032 , P\u0302 J\u2020 MK = P\u0302 J KM. (56)\nIn other words, the operator P\u0302JMK is a true projection operator only if M = K. In a general case, the operator P\u0302JMK with M \u2260 K is sometimes referred to as transfer operator. See such as Ref. Bally and Bender (2021) and reference therein for more discussions.\nThe wave function of a triaxially deformed nucleus (\u03b222 \u2260 0) with the good angular momentum J can be constructed as Yao et al. (2008, 2009)\n\u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 =\u2211 K gJKP\u0302 J MK \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9. (57)\nIn the simple case that the wave function \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 has axial symmetry, the K value is conserved. Otherwise, one needs to mix the components with different K values. The mixing coefficient gJK is determined by minimizing the energy of state which is given by\nE J (q,q) = \u27e8\u03a6JM(q)\u2223H\u03020\u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 \u27e8\u03a6JM(q) \u2223 \u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 = \u2211KK\u2032 g J\u2217 K g J K\u2032H J KK\u2032\n\u2211KK\u2032 gI\u2217K g J K\u2032N J KK\u2032\n(58)\nwhere the relation P\u0302JKMH\u03020P\u0302 J MK\u2032 = H\u03020P\u0302 J KK\u2032 is used. The Hamiltonian and norm kernels are defined below\nHJKK\u2032 = \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223H\u03020P\u0302 J KK\u2032 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 (59a) NJKK\u2032 = \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223P\u0302 J KK\u2032 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 . (59b)\nThe coefficient gJK is the solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem\n\u2211 K\u2032\nHJKK\u2032g J K\u2032 = E J \u2211 K\u2032 NJKK\u2032g J K\u2032 . (60)\nThis equation is equivalent to the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the space spanned by the nonorthogonal basis functions P\u0302JMK \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9.\nBefore ending this subsection, it is worth mentioning that the deformed state \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 becomes a stationary state if the atomic nucleus is very large Blaizot and Ripka (1986). Considering the nuclear system evolves with time t from the deformed state \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9, the wave function at the time t is given by\n\u2223\u03a8(t)\u27e9 = e\u2212iH\u03020t/h\u0335 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 = e\u2212iE0t/h\u0335\u2211 JM cJMe\u2212iJ(J+1)t/2J \u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 (61)\nwhere the \u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 is assumed to be the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H\u03020 (independent of time) with the eigenvalue EJ taking the following value,\nH\u03020 \u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 = EJ \u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 , EJ = E0+J(J+1)/2J . (62)\nIn the limit that the moment of inertial J \u2192\u221e for a very large nuclear system, the wave function in (61) becomes\n\u2223\u03a8(t)\u27e9J\u2192\u221e = e \u2212iE0t/h\u0335\u2211 JM cJM \u2223\u03a6JM(q)\u27e9 = e\u2212iE0t/h\u0335 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 . (63)\nThe above formulas indicate that the deformed state \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 from mean-field calculations is approximately a stationary state for a very large nucleus. In other words, for an infinite large system, the energy splitting between different J states vanishes, the direct couplings between any two rotated symmetry-breaking states \u2223\u03a6(q,\u21261)\u27e9 \u2261 R\u0302(\u21261)\u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 and \u2223\u03a6(q,\u21262)\u27e9 with \u21261 \u2260\u21262 are zero, i.e.,\n\u27e8\u03a6(q,\u21261)\u2223\u03a6(q,\u21262)\u27e9 = \u03b4(\u21261\u2212\u21262). (64)\nIt means that the time required for the nuclear system to pass from one orientated state to another orientated state becomes infinite long. It explains why the restoration of rotational symmetry is more important in light deformed nuclear systems than in heavy ones."

            "text": "As discussed before, the isospin symmetry is a dynamical symmetry in atomic nuclei, described by the special unitary group acting in two-dimension complex space, namely, the SU(2) group. It plays an important role in understanding the asymmetry between the energy spectra of mirror nuclei and nuclear \u03b2 decays. The isospin symmetry is largely preserved by the strong interactions with a small violation from weakly charge-dependent components and the mass difference between neutrons and protons. Besides, the main source of isospin breaking is the electromagnetic interaction. For the convenience of discussion, the total nuclear Hamiltonian\nH\u0302 = H\u03020+ H\u03021, (65)\nis separated into a sum of isospin-rotation invariant term H\u03020 and isospin-rotation breaking term H\u03021 dominated by the Coulomb interaction VC\n[H\u03020, R\u0302y(\u03b8)] = 0, [H\u03021, R\u0302y(\u03b8)] \u2260 0, (66)\nwhere the operator R\u0302y(\u03b8) = e\u2212i\u03b8 T\u0302y is defined as a rotation about the y-axis in the isospin space with the angle \u03b8 with the T\u0302y being the y-component of isospin operator. With the H\u03020 term only, the Hamiltonian commutes with the total isospin T\u0302 2. Nuclear states can then be labeled with the quantum number T , and the states \u2223T MT \u27e9 form degenerate multiplets consisting of 2T +1 components with different MT . With the VC, the degeneracy between the multiplet components is lifted. This phenomenon is shown to be a general feature in the spectra of isobaric isotopes.\nIn addition to the H\u03021 term which breaks the isospin symmetry explicitly, in the mean-field description of atomic nuclei with N \u2260 Z, the presence of the neutron or proton excess automatically yields isovector mean fields, i.e., different mean-field potentials for protons and neutrons. As a result, the isospin invariance is artificially\nbroken by the mean-field approximation even in the case that the isospin-invariant Hamiltonian is used Brink and Svenne (1970); Engelbrecht and Lemmer (1970). It indicates that more efforts are needed to take care of the isospin mixing in atomic nuclei (especially the neutron-rich nuclei with large neutron excess) if one starts from the mean-field approximation. Starting from an isospin-invariant Hamiltonain H\u03020, the breaking of isospin invariance in the mean-field solution is then due to the omission of neutron-proton correlations and can be recovered with the randomphase approximation (RPA) Engelbrecht and Lemmer (1970). From this point of view, the RPA provides an excellent framework to consider isospin-breaking effect in atomic nuclei, which is essential to achieve an accurate calculation of the isospin corrections for superallowed Fermi beta decay Liang et al. (2009).\nAlternatively, one can also take into account the isospin mixing effects with the isospin-symmetry projection operator Caurier et al. (1980); Satula et al. (2009). This projection method applies not only to the ground state but also to nuclear excited states. In this framework, the nuclear state \u2223n,MT \u27e9 with a proper isospin mixing can be spanned in terms of the irreps \u2223T MT \u27e9 of the SU(2) group,\n\u2223n,MT \u27e9 = \u2211 T\u2265\u2223MT \u2223\nanT MT \u2223T MT \u27e9 (67)\nwhere the \u2223T MT \u27e9 is generated by acting the isospin-projection operator P\u0302TMT MT on top of the mean-field wave function \u2223\u03a6N0Z0\u27e9\n1 which is chosen as the eigenstate of neutron- and proton-number operators Satula et al.

The coefficient anT MT defining the degree of isospin mixing is determined by the variational principles using the full Hamiltonian in Eq.(65). Usually, an isospin-mixing parameter \u03b1C is introduced. For the lowest-energy solution with n = 1, it is defined as \u03b1C = 1\u2212 \u2223an=1T MT \u2223 2 with T =MT .\n1 Note that a three-dimension isospin projection operator is needed if a particle-number-violating mean-field wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 is employed.\nApproximate treatments with power expansions\nExtracting the irreps of a symmetry group of a given nuclear Hamiltonian with the projection operator usually requires a multi-dimensional integration of many overlaps between two general Slater determinants for all the group elements. The calculation of these overlaps is generally very time-consuming. This is particularly true if the VAP scheme is employed where this kind of integration needs to be carried out at each iteration. Historically, some approximate treatments of the symmetryrestoration effect on nuclear energy have been proposed, such as the Lipkin Lipkin (1960) and Kamlah Kamlah (1968) power expansion methods.\nThe basic idea of these expansion methods is to eliminate the symmetry-violation effect on the energy eigenvalue by introducing a model Hamiltonian Lipkin (1960),\nH\u2032 = H\u03020\u2212 f (X\u0302), (69)\nfor which all the states \u2223\u03a6X0\u27e9 belonging to different irreps (labelled with X0) of the symmetry group G are degenerate. Here, H\u03020 is the original Hamiltonian, and the f (X\u0302) is chosen as a power series expansion of the operator X\u0302 ,\nf (X\u0302) = M\n\u2211 k=1\n\u03bbk(X\u0302 \u2212X0)k, X\u0302 \u2223\u03a6X0\u27e9 = X0 \u2223\u03a6X0\u27e9 , (70)\nwhere the operator X\u0302 is given by the generators of the symmetry group and can be chosen as for instance the angular-momentum operator J\u03022 or particle-number operator N\u0302 if the rotational SO(3) symmetry or the gauge U(1) symmetry is violated, respectively. To this end, the expansion coefficients \u03bbk are determined in such a way that the quantity \u27e8\u03a6X0 \u2223H\u0302\n\u2032 \u2223\u03a6X0\u27e9 is independent of the X0. The Lipkin\u2019s idea was adopted by Nogami Nogami (1964) to suppress the impact of particle-number fluctuation of the BCS wave function on the binding energy of open-shell atomic nuclei by truncating the expansion in (70) up to the k = 2 terms,\nf (N\u0302) = \u03bb1(N\u0302 \u2212N0)+\u03bb2(N\u03022\u2212N20 ). (71)\nThe above prescription is referred to as the Lipkin-Nogami method. The Lipkin method can be alternatively understood as an expansion of the energy of the symmetry-projected wave function, which leads to the Kamlah\u2019s method Kamlah (1968), where a general scheme to approximate the energy of momentum projection was derived, and it was shown that the cranking model is simply the variational problem in the first-order approximation to the energy of the angularmomentum projected state. Following Ref. Ring and Schuck (1980), this method is introduced for the case of a one-dimensional rotation R\u0302(\u03d5) = ei\u03d5X\u0302 , where the parameter \u03d5 can be either the Euler angle associated with angular momentum J 2 or the\n2 As shown in (50), a three-dimensional rotation operator should be employed in principle to defined the angular-momentum projection. The Kamlah expansion for the general three-dimensional rotation case was presented by Beck, Mang, and Ring Beck et al. (1970).\ngauge angle associated with particle number N. The energy of the projected state labeled with X0 is generally written as\nE X0(q,q) =\n\u222b d\u03d5e\u2212i\u03d5X0 \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223H\u03020ei\u03d5X\u0302 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9\n\u222b d\u03d5e\u2212i\u03d5X0 \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223ei\u03d5X\u0302 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 = \u222b d\u03d5e\u2212i\u03d5X0h(\u03d5) \u222b d\u03d5e\u2212i\u03d5X0n(\u03d5)\n(72)\nwhere the short-hand notations h(\u03d5) and n(\u03d5) were introduced for Hamiltonian and norm overlaps, respectively\nh(\u03d5) = \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223H\u03020ei\u03d5X\u0302 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 , n(\u03d5) = \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223ei\u03d5X\u0302 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 . (73)\nIn the case that the deformation or pairing correlations are strong in \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9, one expects the h(\u03d5) and n(\u03d5) to be peaked at \u03d5 = 0 and to be very small elsewhere in such a way that the quotient h(\u03d5)/n(\u03d5) behaves smoothly. In this case, one can expand h(\u03d5) in terms of n(\u03d5) in the following way\nh(\u03d5) = M\n\u2211 m=0\nhmK\u0302mn(\u03d5), K\u0302 = 1 i \u2202 \u2202\u03d5 \u2212 \u27e8\u03a6 \u2223X\u0302 \u2223\u03a6\u27e9, (74)\nwhere the Kamlah operator K\u0302 was introduced. In this case, the energy of the projected state becomes\nE X0 [M] = \u222b d\u03d5e\u2212i\u03d5X\u2211Mm=0 hmK\u0302mn(\u03d5) \u222b d\u03d5e\u2212i\u03d5X n(\u03d5) = M \u2211 m=0 hm (\u27e8\u03a6 \u2223(\u2206 X\u0302)\u2223\u03a6\u27e9) m , (75)\nwith \u2206 X\u0302 \u2261 X\u0302 \u2212\u27e8\u03a6 \u2223 X\u0302 \u2223\u03a6\u27e9. The expansion coefficients hm are determined by applying the Kamlah operators 1, K\u0302, . . ., K\u0302M and taking the limit \u03d5\u2192 0. One has the following relation\n\u27e8\u03a6 \u2223H\u0302(\u2206 X\u0302)n \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 = M\n\u2211 m=0\nhm \u27e8\u03a6 \u2223(\u2206 X\u0302)m+n \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 .

(82)\nThe wave function \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 is determined by minimizing the energy EX0 [2]. For the case of X\u0302 = N\u0302, the truncation at this order is nothing but the formulas proposed by Nogami Nogami (1964). For simplicity, the h2 is often kept to be constant and is determined after the variation.\nAs mentioned before, the truncation of the Kamlah expansion in (74) converges rather rapidly for the atomic nuclei with strong correlations for which case the overlap functions h(\u03d5) and n(\u03d5) are strongly peaked at the origin and the fluctuation \u27e8\u03a6 \u2223(\u2206 X\u0302)2 \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 is very large. For example, the wave function \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 with a large fluctuation in either angular momentum \u27e8\u03a6 \u2223(\u2206 J\u0302)2 \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 or particle number \u27e8\u03a6 \u2223(\u2206 N\u0302)2 \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 indicating the spread \u27e8\u03a6 \u2223\u2206\u03d52 \u2223\u03a6\u27e9 in the corresponding Euler angle or gauge angle is small. In other words, the orientation of the nucleus is almost fixed in space. For the nuclei with weak collective correlations (small fluctuation), however, one may need to include higher-order terms in the expansion Wang et al. (2014).\nFinally, it is worth noting that these approximate methods only provide a correction to energy. The resultant wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 is still an admixture of different irreps of the symmetry group and thus the quantum number X0 is not recovered. One\nstill needs to implement the projection operator to extract the component \u2223\u03a6X0(q)\u27e9 with correct quantum numbers from the symmetry-breaking wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 to study (electromagnetic multiple) transitions between different states."

(2011) with the PC-PK1 Zhao et al. (2010) force. The norm kernels without the particle-number projection are also shown for comparison. According to (27), the norm kernel determines the weight \u2223cJN0Z0(q)\u2223\n2 of the component \u2223\u03a6JN0Z0(q)\u27e9 in the mean-field wave function \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9. It is shown clearly that the spherical mean-field state with \u03b220 = 0 contains only the J = 0 component. Besides, one notices that the particle-number projection does not change the kernels of prolate deformed states with \u03b220 \u2265 0.4, indicating that particle numbers are not violated in these states. It is because of the collapse of pairing correlations in these states. In contrast, pairing correlation is shown to be strong in oblate deformed states with the deformation parameter \u03b220 \u2243\u22120.3, leading to a strong violation of particle numbers. As a result, these oblate states contain the component with particle numbers other than N0 = Z0 = 12 and the weight \u2223cJN0Z0(q)\u2223\n2 is significantly decreased when the particle-number projection is turned on.\nStarting from each mean-field state \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9, one can evaluate the energy of the symmetry-projected state \u2223\u03a6JN0Z0(q)\u27e9 for different value of J, and it is usually called projected energy surface. The results of different spin states are shown in Fig. 3, where the violation of particle numbers is treated in three different ways. The panels (a) and (c) show the results without and with the particle-number projection, respectively, while the panel (b) shows the approximate way to consider the symmetryviolation effect on the projected energy, in which the original Hamiltonian H0 is replaced with the following one\nH\u0302\u2032 = H\u03020\u2212\u03bbp(Z\u0302\u2212Z0)\u2212\u03bbn(N\u0302 \u2212N0), (86)\nwhere the Lagrange multiplier \u03bb\u03c4 is chosen to be the Fermi energy, which is determined by requiring the correct average particle number \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223N\u0302\u03c4 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 =N0(Z0). It has been shown in Ref. Yao et al. (2011) that the deviation of the average particle number from the correct one can be as large as 0.4 particles, both for neutrons and protons. The subsidiary term could bring an evident correction to nuclear total energy. Moreover, this deviation displays a pronounced dependence on both the angular momentum and deformation. One can see from Fig. 3(a) that the violation of particle numbers in oblate states produces a wrong ordering of the projected energy curves for which the J = 0 (red) one is even higher than the J = 6 (pink). With the correction considered in (86), the energy ordering of the energy curves becomes normal and closer to the results of the exact particle-number projection calculation.\nFinally, PGCM calculation was carried out by mixing all the axially deformed states, c.f. (17), where the collective coordinate q is discretized. One obtains discrete states with their energies indicated by dots centered at their mean deformations \u03b2\u0304J,\u03c3 defined as\n\u03b2\u0304J,\u03c3 =\u2211 qi\n\u03b2(qi)\u2223gJ,\u03c3(qi)\u2223 2 , (87)\nwhere gJ,\u03c3 has been defined in (19). It is shown in Fig. 3 that a rather well-defined rotational band (0+1 ,2 + 1 ,4 + 1 ,6 + 1 ) is built upon the prolate deformed configurations around \u03b220 = 0.5. The energy spectrum of this rotational band is slightly more stretched in the calculation with the particle-number projection."

The correction energy from the restoration of rotation symmetry for the deformed state \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 can be calculated as follows,\n\u2206EJ=0(q)) = E(q)\u2212EJ=0(q) = \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223H\u0302 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 \u27e8\u03a6(q)\u2223 1\u0302 \u2223\u03a6(q)\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e8\u03a6J(q)\u2223H\u0302 \u2223\u03a6J(q)\u27e9 \u27e8\u03a6J(q)\u2223 1\u0302 \u2223\u03a6J(q)\u27e9 . (93)\nSince this energy correction varies with nuclear deformation, the location of the energy minimum on the energy surface might be shifted after symmetry restoration. Given this situation, it is more natural to define the rotational energy correction as\nthe difference between the energies of the lowest mean-field state \u2223\u03a6(qmf)\u27e9 and the lowest angular-momentum projected state \u2223\u03a6(q0)\u27e9,\n\u2206EJ=0 = E(qmf)\u2212EJ=0(q0). (94)\nThe rotational energy correction \u2206EJ=0 for 605 nuclei from a MR-EDF calculation based on the SLy4 force is shown in Fig 5 as a function of the quadrupole deformation \u03b22 at the mean-field energy minimum or as a function of the nuclear mass number A, where both particle-number and angular momentum projection are implemented for axially deformed states. For simplification, the so-called topological Gaussian overlap approximation is employed for angular momentum projection Bender et al. (2006). It is seen that the \u2206EJ=0 is small for spherical/weakly deformed nuclei, and is about 3 MeV for either oblate or prolate deformed nuclei. Besides, the \u2206EJ=0s for light nuclei spread in between 1 MeV and 4 MeV. In contrast, the \u2206EJ=0 is close to 3.0 MeV in heavy nuclei. The size of energy correlation from symmetry restoration seems to be not sensitive to the employed energy density functionals Rodr\u0131\u0301guez et al. (2015); Zhang et al. (2022).\nTriaxiality in atomic nuclei with shape coexistence\nThe PGCM provides a powerful tool of choice to study nuclei with strong shape mixing (the wave function of one nuclear state is an admixture of prolate and oblate deformed shapes) or shape coexistence. The latter is a nuclear phenomenon that the low-lying states of an atomic nucleus consist of two or more states with similar energies which have well-defined and distinct properties and can be interpreted in terms of different intrinsic shapes. The occurrence of shape coexistence affects the evo-\nlution behavior of nuclear low-lying states with spin and isospin. Neutron-deficient krypton isotopes are typical examples.\nFigure 6 displays the low-lying spectra of 76Kr from the PGCM calculation by mixing axially deformed only or also triaxially deformed configurations, in comparison with data. It is shown that a restriction to axial states fails to reproduce the low-energy structures of the spectrum (including both excitation energies and electric quadrupole transitions), demonstrating the important role of including the triaxially deformed configurations in the description of the structure of the low-lying states of 76Kr.\nDynamical and static octupole deformation\nThe atomic nucleus 224Ra is usually suggested to be a stable pear-shaped nucleus based on the measured electric multiple (E\u03bb ) transitions Ahmad and Butler (1993); Butler and Nazarewicz (1996). According to the rotation energy spectrum of asymmetric diatomic molecular, one is expected to observe a rotational band with alternating parity for the states with even and odd angular momenta in 224Ra. However, this feature is shown only in the high-spin states of 224Ra, not in the low-spin states. It has been interpreted as the rotation excitations of a quadrupole deformed \u201crotor\u201d on top of octupole vibration motions.\nFigure 7 shows the calculated low-lying energy spectra of 224Ra. It is seen that the spectra and the E2, E3 transitions can be reproduced reasonably well using only the energy-minimum configuration. However, the energy displacement between the par-\nity doublets in the low-spin region can only be reproduced in the PGCM calculation by mixing the configurations around the equilibrium shape. As shown in Ref. Yao et al. (2015b), the collective wave function of the ground-state is broadly distributed in the deformation plane, indicating a large shape fluctuation. With the increase of angular momentum, the collective wave functions of positive-parity states become gradually concentrated around the energy minimum and close to that of negativeparity states, displaying the classical picture of the stabilization of nuclear shapes with the increase of rotation frequency.\nEvolution of shell structure in neutron-rich nuclei\nThe information on the evolution of shell structure can be learned from the properties of nuclear low-lying states. Generally speaking, a nucleus with a large shell gap is dominated by spherical or weakly deformed shapes with high excitation energy of the first 2+ state and low E2 transition strength between this state and the ground state. The description of the weakening of the neutron shell gap at N = 20 is challenging for many nuclear models. For example, the spectroscopic data for the low-lying states of 32Mg indicate that this nucleus is deformed in the ground state. However, it is predicted to be spherical in almost all the mean-field approaches.\nFigure 8 shows the systematic evolution of the excitation energy of 2+1 state and the electric quadrupole transition strength of 0+1 \u2192 2 + 1 in the neutron-rich magnesium isotopes from two multi-reference EDF calculations Rodin et al. (2006); Yao et al. (2011) and the ab initio VS-IMSRG calculation Miyagi et al. (2020). The data show that the N = 20 and N = 28 shell gaps are melted in magnesium isotopes. This phenomenon has been well described by the non-relativistic EDF D1S force, partially by the relativistic EDF PC-F1 force, but poorly by the current implementation of valence-space IMSRG based on the normal-ordering two-body approximation with a chiral NN+3N interaction. The description of nuclear large deformation and shape coexistence is still a challenge to nuclear ab initio methods."

            "text": "Symmetry and group theory play an important role in modeling atomic nuclei. In many mean-field-based nuclear models, certain symmetries of nuclear Hamiltonian are allowed to be broken in mean-field potentials to incorporate some essential many-body correlations, which leads to a symmetry-breaking nuclear wave function. This symmetry breaking is introduced artificially because of the employed approximations and the broken symmetries need to be restored. In this chapter, the basic idea of this symmetry-breaking mechanism in mean-field approaches and the methods used to restore the broken symmetries at the beyond-mean-field level have\nbeen introduced with some illustrative examples. In the meantime, the success of these methods in the description of nuclear low-lying states has been demonstrated.\nSymmetry restoration has been popularly implemented in energy density functional calculations. However, most of the currently employed nuclear energy functionals were parameterized at the mean-field level. The inclusion of beyond-meanfield effects from symmetry restoration and also configuration mixing may worsen the description of nuclear properties. A new parametrization of energy density functionals including in the fitting procedure the beyond-mean-field effects is required to improve further the accuracy of the calculation with nuclear multi-reference energy density functionals. Besides, it is worth mentioning that symmetry-restoration methods may meet the singularity and self-interaction problems if one starts from a general energy density functional Anguiano et al. (2001); Bender et al. (2009); Duguet et al. (2009). This discussion is not covered in this Chapter. Lots of efforts are devoted to finding out an energy functional free of these problems. This problem does not exist in the Hamiltonian-based approaches. Therefore, the implementation of symmetry-restoration methods into ab initio methods starting from a realistic nuclear force derived from for instance the chiral effective field theory proposed by Weinberg Weinberg (1991) becomes very attractive. The above-mentioned problems are not shown in these ab initio frameworks. This development has stimulated great research interest in the application of symmetry-restoration methods to nuclear structure and decay properties related to fundamental interactions and symmetries, such as the clustering structure in light nuclei, isospin-symmetry breaking correction in the superallowed \u03b2 -decay, Schiff moment in octupole deformed nuclei and the nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta decay."
