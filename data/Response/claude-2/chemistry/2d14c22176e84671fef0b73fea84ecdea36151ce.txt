 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate using different combinations of natural cross-linking agents (e.g. genipin + tannic acid) to create hydrogels with enhanced properties. The synergistic effects of multiple natural cross-linkers could be explored.

2. Develop hydrogels using new natural cross-linking agents not covered in the paper, such as proanthocyanidins, ferulic acid, etc. Expanding the library of green cross-linkers is useful.

3. Optimize reaction conditions (temperature, pH, concentrations, etc.) for natural cross-linker systems to maximize crosslinking efficiency and tailor hydrogel properties. More work can refine these processes.

4. Evaluate the long-term stability and degradation of hydrogels crosslinked with natural agents compared to traditional synthetic cross-linkers. This could reveal advantages of green cross-linkers.

5. Explore applications of natural cross-linker hydrogels beyond biomedicine, such as in water treatment, agriculture, food science, etc. The green materials could serve broader purposes.
