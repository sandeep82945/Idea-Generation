    "abstractText": "The treatment of contaminated water is currently a major concern worldwide. This work was directed towards the preparation of a composite hydrogel by entrapping cherry stones powder on chitosan, which is known as one of the most abundant natural polymers. The synthesized material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and by the point of zero charge determination. Its ability to remove two azo dyes models (Acid Red 66 and Reactive Black 5) existing in single form and in binary mixture was evaluated. Response Surface Methodology\u2013Central Composite Design was used to optimize three parameters affecting the process while targeting the lowest final contaminant concentrations. The best results were obtained at pH 2, an adsorbent dose of 100 g/L, and a temperature of 30 \u25e6C, when more than 90% of the pollutants from the single component systems and more than 70% of those of the binary mixtures were removed from their aqueous solutions. The adsorption process was in accordance with Elovich and pseudosecond-order kinetic models, and closely followed the Freundlich and Temkin equilibrium isotherms. The obtained results led to the conclusion that the prepared hydrogel composite possesses the ability to successfully retain the target molecules and that it can be considered as a viable adsorbent material.",

            "text": "With the continuous increase in demand for different products, industrialization in the recent decades has resulted in the use of more and more chemical compounds. Synthetic dyes are among the most frequently encountered of these compounds. Depending on their structure, they can be divided into several categories such as azo, vat, indigo, nitro dyes, etc., the first, azo, representing more than 60% of the market [1]. Since it is common for synthetic dyes to be used in the production of goods as textiles [2,3], cosmetics [4\u20136], food [7\u20139], plastics [10], drugs [11,12], etc., they are obtained in large quantities. Part of them end up in water, either through the products in which they are found or as part of the discharged effluents thus becoming a source of contamination. Even at very low concentrations, these pollutants, recognized as highly durable and water soluble and characterized by their own form and mechanism of action, cause serious injuries to human health and to the environment. Allergic reactions, association with systemic diseases, skin irritations [13], mutagenic and carcinogenic potential, high toxicity, respiratory and renal failure [14], cyanosis, tissue necrosis, and jaundice [15] can be cited as\nGels 2022, 8, 795. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels8120795 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2022, 8, 795 2 of 22\nnegative effects of dyes on humans. As well, dyes inhibit plant growth, cause reductions in pigment and protein content of microalgae, and have toxic effects on aquatic life, resulting in breathing troubles, movement difficulties, and malformations [16]. As a consequence, the removal of these emerging contaminants from wastewater has become a pressing issue and the need to maintain water quality has become a real challenge. In order to counterbalance these growing concerns, it is imperative that dyes are removed from aqueous media at sufficiently low levels. Usually, the elimination of dyes is attempted through a variety of biological, chemical, and physical methods. The first class of treatments is typically characterized by the degradation of dyes through metabolism or adsorption by biomass (bacteria, fungi, and yeasts) before the treated aqueous effluents are released into the environment [17]. Chemical treatments include methods such as oxidation processes [18\u201320], ozonation [21,22], electrochemical destruction [23,24], photocatalysis [25\u201327], etc. In terms of physical techniques, coagulation-flocculation [28,29], membrane filtration [30], nanofiltration [31], precipitation [32,33], etc., can be cited. Even though, on occasion, satisfactory results were obtained when combinations of biological, chemical, and physical methods were used [34,35], many of these methods are ineffective for some colored compounds. Reduced degradation is observed for biological treatments. Then again, chemical and physical processes are responsible for the generation of various secondary products which are regularly classified as harmful for the environment. Moreover, due to the complex structures of dyes and their often high molecular weight, there is always a challenge in selecting the adequate approach. As a result of the above related aspects, there is an amplified demand for the development of appropriate methodologies for the removal of dyes existing in wastewaters. Adsorption is considered to be an attractive alternative since it stands out through operation simplicity, avoidance of supplementary chemicals, and nonexistence of undesirable products [36]. Numerous adsorbents such as activated carbon [37\u201339], silicates [40], porous geopolymers [41], materials prepared from agricultural wastes [42,43] or obtained from biomass residue [44], materials containing nanoparticles of various oxides [45\u201347], composites [48,49], etc., are reported as favorable adsorbents. They possess important surface area, high pore sizes, and structures permitting high affinity with various compounds; therefore, they are listed as efficiently retaining colored contaminants from aqueous media. Considering the actual context of the continuing efforts towards developing new methods for water depollution, the novelty of the present paper resides in using an undervalorized by-product from fruits processing industrial sector to produce an adsorbent material and revealing that it is able to retain colored molecules from aqueous solution. Thus, the present research was undertaken to prepare a low-cost adsorbent by a simple method of entrapping a powder of cherry stones in a chitosan polymeric matrix. Morphological analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, and determination of the point of zero charge (pHPZC) were used for its characterization. Subsequently, the adsorption potential of the obtained value-added material was evaluated for the removal of two model azo dyes: Acid Red 66 (AR) and Reactive Black 5 (RB), which are found in single or in binary component systems. Then, a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) analysis was conducted on several parameters which affect the adsorption process (pH, adsorbent amount, and temperature). Finally, on the optimized established conditions, a kinetic study was carried out and kinetic models and equilibrium isotherms were tested and established."

Our preliminary tests revealed that cherry stones, as such, are not able to adequately retain the target contaminants. Even though there are ways of using them for\nGels 2022, 8, 795 3 of 22\nproducing activated carbon, for example. A chemical activation process conducted with zinc chloride at 700 \u25e6C was proposed by Angin et al. [50]. Olivares-Marin et al. [51,52] used dehydration agents such as potassium hydroxide or sulfuric acid and temperatures between 400 \u25e6C and 900 \u25e6C in order to obtain activated carbon from cherry stones. Duran-Valle et al. [53] submitted cherry stones to different gases action under elevated temperature obtaining a porous material. Nowicki et al. [54] conducted a pyrolysis process on cherry stones followed by physical activation at 800 \u25e6C under carbon dioxide. The tests on the use of the prepared material for the adsorption of different pollutants were very promising. In one of our previous papers [55], we have reported, also, that the adsorbent which results from calcinating cherry stones for 6 h at 600 \u25e6C is able to retain dyes such as Congo Red from aqueous solutions. Nonetheless, all of these methods, besides being time- and energyconsuming, present the major disadvantage of a very reduced yield (only 1.2% in our earlier study). As a consequence, in this work, we aimed, firstly, to prepare an adsorbent material by using cherry stones directly without passing them through the activation and/or calcination steps of activated carbon manufacture. Through our investigations, we have determined that, when this industrial by-product is used in a ground state, its adsorption capacity increases significantly. However, cherry stones powder is difficult to recover from an aqueous environment after the completion of the adsorption process. An alternative consists of entrapping the cherry stones into a carrier support. Chitosan (a polysaccharide derived from chitin) was chosen for this purpose. Apart from the fact that this natural polymer possesses, among others, attractive attributes such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, untoxicity, and antitumor, analgesic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties [56], it is known for its ability to form hydrogels. In our case, cherry stones in powder were carefully mixed for 24 h with a solution of chitosan in acetic acid. The suspension was then dripped in a methanol\u2013sodium hydroxide combination and left to rest at 4 \u25e6C for another 24 h. The hydrogel beads were heated at reflux in a methanol\u2013glutaraldehyde mixture for 6 h at 70 \u25e6C in order to ensure a good stability in acidic media. A schematic representation of the preparation process steps is exhibited in Figure 1. Gels 2022, 8, 795 4 of 23\nFigure 1.

In the case of CSCH adsorbent (Figure 4A), the band appearing between 3500 cm\u22121 and 3200 cm\u22121 was characteristic of the hydroxyl stretching vibration overlapped on the \u2212N\u2212H vibration of chitosan matrix.\nGels 2022, 8, 795 5 of 23\nFTIR spectra were recorde for the prepared material before and after the adsorption\nof the target compounds existing in the tested single or binary systems.

In the region of 1500 cm\u22121\u20131200 cm\u22121, bending vibrations of \u2212N\u2212H and of \u2212CH2 can be observed [57]. At approximately 1000 cm\u22121, vibration of the C\u2212O of the natural polymer or of cherry stones is visible [58]. The analysis of the FTIR spectra recorded after the retention of Acid Red 66 dye (Figure 4B), Reactive Black 5 (Figure 4C), or their combinations (Figure 4D\u2013F) showed the existence of functional groups such as diazene (at about 1500 cm\u22121) or sulfonate group attached to benzene (vibrations between 1400 cm\u22121 and 1000 cm\u22121) [59] specific to AR or the bands of C\u2212C, C=C, and N=N, which were observable from 1600 cm\u22121 to 1500 cm\u22121 [60,61] and were assignable to RB. These facts sustain the conclusion that the adsorption of the molecules took place. The last investigation conducted for the characterization of the synthesized material was the determination of the point of zero charge (pHPZC). When an adsorbent is introduced in an electrolyte aqueous solution, the ions existing on its surface dissociate and form complexes with those of the electrolyte solution [62]. Hence, at different pH values, the surface charge can be negative, positive, or null, and the adsorbent acts as a cation or anion exchanger, being able to retain various molecules. A surface charge equal to 0 does not signify the absence of charge but equality between the positive and negative charges [63]. From Figure 5, it can be remarked that the adsorbent obtained by entrapping cherry stones powder in chitosan has a pHPZC of 7.8. Similar values were reported by other studies [54,64] in which cherry stones were used for manufacturing adsorbing materials. Theoretically, at a working pH below pHPZC, the hydrogel beads interact with the negative charges of the pollutants while, at a pH above the pHPZC, more interactions will occur with the positive charge of the chosen molecules. Practically, an increase in pH from 2 to 4 leads to an increase in pHPZC. The existence of a plateau is perceptible when the pH is adjusted between 4 and 10. In this interval, the adsorbent possesses amphoteric properties, meaning that neither the acid addition nor the base addition in the initial dye solution will affect the equilibrium pH.

Secondly, with the acquired data, an optimization process is conducted via a software investigation. A mathematical model is generated, and its adequacy is tested by statistical analysis and confirmed by comparison with results registered when running experiments on the suggested conditions.\nGels 2022, 8, 795 6 of 22\nIn these circumstances, one of our aims was to determine the optimized values for the three main parameters (pH, adsorbent dose, and temperature) affecting the adsorption of target dyes. The final contaminant concentration was the following response function. For this study, a total of 27 experiments were conducted for each of the single dye systems (AR, RB) and for a binary system (50% AR + 50% RB). Table 1 shows the recorded data for the response function and the values predicted by the quadratic models generated by the employed software.\nThe mathematical models obtained for the response function (final contaminant concentration) of each set of experiments are expressed by Equations (1)\u2013(3).\nCAR = 8.66 + 6.27\u00b7X1 \u2212 2.08\u00b7X2 + 0.06\u00b7X3 \u2212 0.65\u00b7X1\u00b7X2 \u2212 0.29\u00b7X1\u00b7X3 +0.33\u00b7X2\u00b7X3 \u2212 0.74\u00b7X21 + 3.48\u00b7X22 + 0.92\u00b7X23\n(1)\nCRB = 10.74 + 8.16\u00b7X1 \u2212 1.25\u00b7X2 \u2212 0.23\u00b7X3 + 0.10\u00b7X1\u00b7X2 \u2212 0.19\u00b7X1\u00b7X3 +0.10\u00b7X2\u00b7X30.17\u00b7X21 + 3.92\u00b7X22 + 2.00\u00b7X23\n(2)\nC50% AR+50% RB = 19.46 + 5.87\u00b7X1 \u2212 0.22\u00b7X2 + 0.35\u00b7X3 + 0.76\u00b7X1\u00b7X2 \u22120.25\u00b7X1\u00b7X3 + 0.04\u00b7X2\u00b7X3 \u2212 2.28\u00b7X21 + 4.04\u00b7X22 + 0.43\u00b7X23\n(3)\nThe interdependent consequence of the terms depends on the coefficient signs: a positive sign implies synergy and that an augmentation of the response function occurs with the increase in the factors. On the contrary, a negative sign suggests that the variable is able to conduct to a diminishment of the response function.\nStatistical significance was tested by analysis of variance.\nGels 2022, 8, 795 7 of 22\nAs shown in Table 2, the values of lack of fit for all three dyes systems indicate the suitability of the obtained mathematical equations. In the case of the terms, a low p-value suggests that the specific terms are significant. For AR and RB single systems, the pH and adsorbent dose had the most important impact while, in the case of the binary dye system, it seems that the pH had the greatest influence on the retention of the pollutants on the adsorbent surface.\nThe models F-values (260.08 for AR, 1877.61 for RB, 34.43 for 50% AR + 50% RB) imply that they are significant, with the chances of being caused by the noise reaching only 0.01%.\nGels 2022, 8, 795 8 of 22\nCorrelation coefficients very close to the unit (0.9915 for AR, 0.9988 for RB, and 0.9394 for 50% AR + 50% RB) reveal that the models can satisfactorily predict the experimental results. The Predicted R2 (0.9784 for AR, 0.9974 for RB, and 0.8691 for 50% AR + 50% RB) were all in reasonable agreement with the Adjusted R2 (0.9877 for AR, 0.9983 for RB, and 0.9121 for 50% AR + 50% RB), with the difference being very reduced. The adequate precision (which measures the signal to noise ratio) was higher than 4 for all three systems (56.810 for AR, 144.678 for RB, and 18.784 for 50% AR + 50% RB), indicating an adequate signal.\nConsequently, the mathematical models can be considered as fitting for all systems. 3D response surface plots showing the factors impacts on the final dye concentration\nare displayed in Figure 6.\nGels 2022, 8, 795 9 of 23\nFigure 6. Aggregate impact of pH, adsorbent dose, and temperature on final concentration of AR (A), RB (B), and 50% AR + 50% RB (C).\nWhen conducting an adsorption process, the pH of the initial solution has a decisive\neffect. It impacts both the adsorbent properties and the characteristics of the molecules to\nbe adsorbed [65]. In this study, more than 90% of the target compounds were removed\nfrom the aqueous solution of single dye system and more than 70% was removed when\ntwo dyes were mixed in equal proportions. The removal efficiency decreased with the\naugmentation of pH to neutral, and also in alkaline media. Similar data are disclosed by\nother papers which reveal that acid conditions are suitable for the adsorption of this type\nof dyes [67,68].\nThe amount of the adsorbent added to emerging pollutants solutions also affects the\nadsorption effectiveness. The most elevated values of the removal efficiency in the case of\nthe analyzed dyes in single form or in combination were attained when the adsorbent\nconcentration was 100 g/L. Increasing the adsorbent dose augments the probability that\nthe active sites are occupied by the contaminants. After a certain limit (considered to be\nthe optimal adsorbent dose), saturation is reached and no considerable increase in dye\nretention on the adsorbent surface is observed [69].\nTemperature is another key parameter of the adsorption process. As explained by\nYadav and Dasgupta [70], the increased retention of the dye chosen for their experiments\nwhen the temperature was raised from 20 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C could be the result of the increased\ndye flux getting to the adsorbent material, and of a more important diffusion rate. The\ndecline in removal efficiency when the temperature was set at 40 \u00b0C could be the outcome\n20 25\n30 35\n40\n50 70\n90 110\n130 150\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nA R\n( m\ng /L\n)\nB: Adsorbent (g/L)C: Temperature (\u00b0C)\n3D Surface Design-Expert\u00ae Software Factor Coding: Actual\nAR (mg/L) 1.14179 22.4328\nX1 = B: Adsorbent X2 = C: Temperature\nActual Factor A: pH = 7\nTemperature, C Adsorbent, g/L\nA\n50 70\n90 110\n130 150\n2 4\n6 8\n10 12\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nA R\n( m\ng /L\n)\nA: pHB: Adsorbent (g/L)\n3D Surface Design-Expert\u00ae Software Factor Coding: Actual"

It impacts both the adsor t roperties and the char cteristics of the molecules to be adsorbed [65]. In this study, more than 90% of the target compounds were removed from the aqueous solution of single dye system and more than 70% was removed when two dyes were mixed in equal proportions. The removal efficiency decreased with the augmentation of pH to neutral, and also in alkaline media. Similar data are disclosed by\nGels 2022, 8, 795 9 of 22\nother papers which reveal that acid conditions are suitable for the adsorption of this type of dyes [67,68]. The amount of the adsorbent added to emerging pollutants solutions also affects the adsorption effectiveness. The most elevated values of the removal efficiency in the case of the analyzed dyes in single form or in combination were attained when the adsorbent concentration was 100 g/L. Increasing the adsorbent dose augments the probability that the active sites are occupied by the contaminants. After a certain limit (considered to be the optimal adsorbent dose), saturation is reached and no considerable increase in dye retention on the adsorbent surface is observed [69]. Temperature is another key parameter of the adsorption process. As explained by Yadav and Dasgupta [70], the increased retention of the dye chosen for their experiments when the temperature was raised from 20 \u25e6C to 30 \u25e6C could be the result of the increased dye flux getting to the adsorbent material, and of a more important diffusion rate. The decline in removal efficiency when the temperature was set at 40 \u25e6C could be the outcome of a reduced affinity of the dye to the adsorbent. Silva et al. [71] concluded that a high temperature is responsible for weakening the forces between the target molecule and the adsorbent surface, and has an undesirable impact on the process. Analogous information can be drawn from our investigation. Three temperatures were tested (20 \u25e6C, 30 \u25e6C, and 40 \u25e6C) and the best results were obtained for the middle value. All three parameters were optimized simultaneously in order to reach the smallest contaminant concentration in the aqueous solution after the finalization of the adsorption process. The resultant values were as follows: pH 2, adsorbent dose: 100 g/L, and temperature: 30 \u25e6C. Five supplementary experiments were conducted in these conditions. The adsorption of dyes on the synthesized material was visible (Figure 2B\u2013F). The removal efficiencies were 1.20 \u00b1 0.05 mg/L for AR, 2.40 \u00b1 0.1 mg/L for RB, and 7.12 \u00b1 0.09 mg/L for 50% AR + 50% RB system, sustaining the adequacy of the mathematical models and validating them."

            "text": "A better understanding of the adsorption process can be achieved by studying the kinetic behavior of the adsorbent. Investigations were conducted at pH 2 and a temperature of 30 \u25e6C by putting 10 mL of dye solution in a single system (AR, RB) or binary systems (25% AR + 75% RB, 50% AR + 50% RB, and 75% AR + 25% RB), in contact with an adsorbent dose of 100 g/L. The refractory compound concentrations were established at given time intervals ranging from 10 min to 240 min. Different known kinetic models, namely pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and Avrami, were tested and their accuracy evaluated. The first of the mentioned models can estimate the equilibrium time and quantity of the adsorbed pollutant by determining the time-scaling factor [72]. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model states that adsorption is based on chemical relations which take place between the adsorbate and the adsorbent surface. Parameters such as initial contaminant concentration, enthalpy, and entropy changes must be considered since they have a major impact on the adsorption [73]. There are studies specifying that, for high initial concentrations, the pseudo-first-order model is more suitable to express the adsorption kinetics, while the pseudo-second-order equation is recommended for defining the adsorption conduct at low concentrations [74,75]. The Elovich equation hypothesis is related to the fact that the chemical mechanism led the process, and is appropriate for situations including adsorbents with heterogeneous surfaces [76]. The Avrami kinetic model proposes that the reaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent occurs at the active sites surface. One of its factors gives details on the changes in the adsorption mechanisms as a function of time and temperature [77]. Very similar allures were remarked for all five tested pollutant concentrations (10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 40 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) for the two single systems (AR and RB) and the three binary systems (25% AR + 75% RB, 50% AR + 50% RB, and 75% AR + 25% RB). Therefore, we have illustrated, in Figure 7, as an example, only the kinetic behavior of the\nGels 2022, 8, 795 10 of 22\nresults obtained for a total initial pollutant concentration of 30 mg/L in the case of AR (Figure 7A), RB (Figure 7B), and their combination in equal proportions (Figure 7C).\nGels 2022, 8, 795 11 of 23\nFigure 7.

Kinetic parameters of adsorption of AR, RB, and 50% AR + 50% RB.\nGels 2022, 8, 795 11 of 22\nComparable conclusions were made by various other investigations conducted for the elimination of different combinations of dyes by adsorption on different composite materials. Rong et al. [78] analyzed the ability of an adsorbent of nickel oxide and graphene nanosheets to retain Congo Red from wastewater and indicated that the pseudo-secondorder kinetic model closely fit the experimental results. Abramian and El-Rassy [79] carried out the adsorption of Orange II on titania aerogel and showed that the process follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption of Reactive Black 5 dye on a low-cost adsorbent of macadamia seed husks was the subject of interest of Felista et al. [80], and their findings also designated the pseudo-second-order kinetic model as appropriate. Likewise, the adsorption of dyes existing in binary systems is well described by this type of kinetic model [81,82]. The evaluation of the statistical data (Table 4) equally endorses the indication that the Elovich and pseudo-second-order models are able to describe the contaminants adsorption on the hydrogel beads prepared by entrapping the cherry stones powder on the natural polymeric matrix of chitosan. The Elovich model fitting the experimental results implies that contaminants adsorption takes place by mass transfer with different activation energies for chemisorption. The adequacy of the pseudo-second-order equation emphasizes that chemical adsorption is the controlling mechanism of the target compounds retention, while the smaller correlation coefficients recorded for the pseudo-first-order model reveal that, even though physisorption can occur, it is not the dominant process."

            "text": "Adsorption isotherms are frequently employed for establishing the relation which occurs between the adsorption capacity reached by an adsorbent in the equilibrium state and the concentration existing initially in the pollutants aqueous solutions with the objective of determining the process mechanism. In the present work, three isotherm models with two parameters (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin) and two isotherm models with three parameters (Jovanovic-multilayer and Toth) were compared to the registered results. Langmuir isotherm characterizes the adsorption happening on adsorbent homogeneous sites. It suggests that: (i) a material possessing adsorption properties has a limited adsorption capacity; (ii) the active sites of\nGels 2022, 8, 795 12 of 22\nthe adsorbent are identical and can accommodate only one adsorbate molecule; (iii) there are no interactions between the retained molecules [83]. Freundlich isotherm is useful in the situation of adsorbents with heterogeneous surfaces, which retain high amounts of contaminants [84]. The Temkin equation analyses the interactions between the adsorbent and the molecule to be adsorbed. It is based on the supposition that the molecules adsorption heat diminishes in a linear mode and that the binding energies are uniformly distributed [85]. The Jovanovic-multilayer isotherm model refers to physical adsorption and implies that the adsorbent surface which is not occupied by the target compound will reduce proportionally with the decrease in the power of the compound partial pressure [86]. The Toth isotherm provides information for submonolayer coverage, its theory relying on the fact that the materials with heterogeneous surfaces are able to adsorb low-to-high concentrations of pollutants from aqueous media [87]. As in the case of the kinetic study, very similar allures were remarked for all five tested pollutant concentrations (10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 40 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) for the two monocomponent systems (AR and RB) and for the three binary component systems (25% AR + 75% RB, 50% AR + 50% RB, and 75% AR + 25% RB). Therefore, we have pictured, in Figure 8, as an example, only the equilibrium isotherms of the results obtained for a total initial pollutant concentration of 30 mg/L in the case of AR (Figure 8A), RB (Figure 8B), and their combination in equal proportions (Figure 8C).\nGels 2022, 8, 795 13 of 23\npossessing adsorption properties has a limited adsorption capacity; (ii) the active sites of\nthe adsorbent are identical and can accommodate only one adsorbate molecule; (iii) there\nare no interactions between the retained molecules [83].

Equilibrium isotherms of AR (A), RB (B), and 50% AR + 50% RB (C) adsorption on CSCH adsorbent.\nRegardless of the fact that Langmuir isotherm is considered one of the most frequently used equations describing the adsorption process of various types of compounds, our investigation showed that this model is not suitable for portraying the adsorption (data not shown) of chosen dyes existing in single or in binary systems.\nGels 2022, 8, 795 13 of 22\nThe analysis of the equilibrium isotherms parameters, reported in Table 5, reveals that, for the monocomponent dye system RB, the adsorption is favored by temperature, as the nF constant of the Freundlich isotherm is superior to 2. For both monocomponent dye systems, AR and RB, the ratio 1/nF Freundlich isotherm is subunitary, suggesting a chemisorption process. For the binary component system, it is superior to 1, indicating a cooperation adsorption and, thus, a high importance of the lateral interaction among compounds on the adsorbent surface. This can be explained by the fact that the functional groups, such as hydroxyl of the prepared material, are able to form coordinative bonds. In consequence, it can be noted that the adsorbent material prepared from cherry stones powder and chitosan has characteristics that are specific to a heterogeneous surface and that the adsorption process is conducted by chemisorption and cooperative adsorption.\nA good fit with experimental data can be observed for the Temkin model, its nT constant suggesting a lack of adsorbent surface homogeneity. The Jovanovic and Toth equations estimated the adsorption capacity; however, the values are rather different from those calculated experimentally, being higher in the case of the AR system and inferior for the RB system and for dye combinations. Our conclusions are comparable with those of other studies conducted for the removal of dyes by adsorption on different materials. Similar findings were published by Ali et al. [88], who explored the adsorption of indigo carmin and Congo Red dyes on calcinated layered double hydroxides, and by Ojediran et al. [89], who inspected the retention of malachite green on acid functionalized maize cob and pointed out that the adsorption does not obey the Langmuir model. Abramian and El-Rassy focused on the adsorption of Orange II dye on a porous titania aerogel [79] and revealed that the Freundlich isotherm is suitable for describing the process. Archin et al. [90] showed that the Temkin model is applicable for the adsorption of Methylene Blue cationic dye and of Acid Blue 25 anionic dye in single form or in binary mixture on activated carbon obtained from tobacco residues. Diaz de Tuesta et al. [86] tested the removal of Sudan-IV from oily wastewater by retention on activated carbons and presented the Jovanovic and Toth expressions as appropriate models for their adsorption experiments. The investigation of the statistical errors given in Table 6, along with the considerations discussed earlier, permit sustaining that the tested isotherm equations fit the experimental data in a satisfactory way. As a function of their adequacy and accuracy, the tried models can be ordered as follows: Freundlich > Temkin > Jovanovic > Toth.\nGels 2022, 8, 795 14 of 22"

            "text": "Depending on how the solid surface of the adsorbent interacts with the refractory compounds, the adsorption can occur by physical and/or by chemical sorption. As explained earlier, the adsorption performance was affected by the solution pH, temperature, and adsorbent dose. The best results were obtained at pH 2, at a temperature of 30 \u25e6C, with a concentration of adsorbent of 100 g/L. In these conditions, the adsorbent is positively charged while both dyes encompass negative charges due to the existence of nitrogen\u2013nitrogen bonds with aromatic rings, generally replaced by sulfonate groups in the case of AR, and with the sulfonate group present on the surface in the case of RB. The prepared material was able to retain the AR and RB from monocomponent systems or from binary systems based on electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, hydrogen, and \u03c0-\u03c0 bonds. The fact that the Elovich and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were found to accurately describe the adsorption implies that chemical sorption is controlling the process. The adsorbent and the adsorbate interact mainly by strong covalent bonds. The migration of dyes from the surface to the interior of the retaining material was observable. The relation between the adsorbate and the adsorbent at equilibrium was described closely by the Freundlich and Temkin models. This information shows, also, that chemisorption and cooperative adsorption conduct the adsorption process."

The adsorbent was prepared based on the method proposed by Altun et al., 2019 [58] with slight modifications. Briefly, 4 g of chitosan were put in contact with 200 mL of a 2% acetic acid solution on a Nahita magnetic plate (Auxilab, Beri\u00e1in, Spain). After dissolution,\nGels 2022, 8, 795 16 of 22\n2 g of cherry stone powder were added and continuously stirred for 24 h. The resultant mixture was dropped into a coagulation solution composed of 120 g of NaOH, 400 mL of distilled water, and 600 mL of methanol. The obtained hydrogel beads were let in this solution for 24 h in order to insure their complete coagulation. After that, they were washed with distilled water until they had a neutral pH and then placed in a laboratory beaker along with a solution containing 1.2 mL glutaraldehyde and 120 mL methanol, and were heated at reflux at 70 \u25e6C for 6 h. The prepared cherry stones-chitosan hydrogel beads (abbreviated CSCH) were stored in glutaraldehyde-methanol solution in a closed vessel at 4 \u25e6C. Prior to use, they were washed with ethanol and distilled water."

Then, it was positioned on double-adhesive carbon discs fixed on specific stubs of a TESCAN MIRA device (TESCAN Orsay Holding, Brno, Check Republic) equipped with TESCAN Essence software version 1.0.8.0. Normal secondary electron mode (SE) in high vacuum was considered for the investigation. Detection was ensured by a large field detector (LFD) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, a working distance of 14\u201340 mm, and a spot size of 6. The magnification range was between 500 \u00b5m and 50 \u00b5m. FTIR spectra were registered from 4000 cm\u22121 to 400 cm\u22121 (45 scans/min.) with a resolution of 4 cm\u22121 on an IRSpirit FT-IR spectrometer (Shimadzu, Bucharest, Romania) including a QATR accessory and a KBr beam splitter. The QATR plate was cleaned with ethanol between acquisitions. Air was used for background spectrum reference, which was recorded and compared with the anterior one. Determination of pHPZC was realized by solid addition method with potassium nitrate as background electrolyte following the procedure described by Balistrieri and Murray [91]. Summarily, volumes of 25 mL of KNO3 0.1 M were added in a series of Erlenmeyer flasks. An adjustment between 2 and 12 of initial pH values (pHi) was ensured. In each initial solution, 0.5 g of CSCH beads were added. After 24 h at room temperature, the solutions pH was measured again (pHf). A graphical representation of the evolution of differences between the initial and final pH values (\u2206 pH) against pHi served to establish the pHPZC of the samples."
