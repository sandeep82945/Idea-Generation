    "abstractText": "The brain is a complex system with functional and structural networks. Different neuroimaging methods have their strengths and limitations, depending on the signals they measure. Combining techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) techniques has gained interest, but understanding how the information derived from these modalities is related remains an exciting open question. Successful integration of these modalities requires a sophisticated mathematical framework that goes beyond simple comparative analyses. The multilayer network model has emerged as a promising approach. This study is an extended version of the conference paper \u201dResting State Brain Connectivity Analysis from EEG and FNIRS Signals\u201d [5]. In this study, we explored the brain network properties obtained from EEG and fNIRS data using graph analysis. Additionally, we adopted the multilayer network model to evaluate the benefits of combining multiple modalities compared to using a single modality. A small-world network structure was observed in the rest, right motor imagery, and left motor imagery tasks in both modalities. We found that EEG captures faster changes in neural activity, thus providing a more precise estimation of the timing of information transfer between brain regions in RS. fNIRS provides insights into the slower hemodynamic responses asso\u2217Corresponding author Email addresses: r.blanco@sanoscience.org (Rosmary Blanco), c.koba@sanoscience.org (Cemal Koba), a.crimi@sanoscience.org (Alessandro Crimi) Preprint submitted to Journal of Computational Science November 7, 2023 .

The multilayer approach outperformed unimodal analyses, offering a richer understanding of brain function. Complementarity between EEG and fNIRS was observed, particularly during tasks, as well as a certain level of redundancy and complementarity between the multimodal and the unimodal approach, which is dependent on the modality and on the specific brain state. Overall, the results highlight differences in how EEG and fNIRS capture brain network topology in RS and tasks and emphasize the value of integrating multiple modalities for a comprehensive view of brain connectivity and function.\nKeywords: EEG, fNIRS, Multimodal,, Multilayer, Networks, Resting-state, Motor imagery\n1. Introduction1\nContemporary neuroimaging methods depend on diverse source signals2 across various spatial and temporal scales. Neural activity is predominantly3 described by electrophysiological mechanisms and it is mediated by metabolic4 and hemodynamic processes. Unlike electrophysiological signals, metabolic5 and hemodynamic responses are much slower and reflect the indirect and6 secondary effects of neural activity. Noninvasive neuroimaging modalities7 are based on biophysical signals associated with either brain electrophysiol-8 ogy or hemodynamics/metabolism. The strengths and limitations of these9 modalities depend largely upon the spatiotemporal characteristics of the mea-10 sured source signals in relation to neuronal activity, as well as many diverse11 sensing and imaging methods applied to individual modalities. The comple-12 mentary features have motivated recent developments in integrating multi-13 ple neuroimaging modalities with a notable focus on the integration of EEG14 and fNIRS in recent years [47, 50, 26]. fNIRS relies on differential mea-15 surements of the backscattered light, which is sensitive to oxy- (HbO) and16 deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). EEG, on the other hand, captures the electrical17 brain activity derived from synchronous excitatory post-synaptic potentials.18 The former has high spatial resolution but is highly sensitive to scalp-related19 (extracerebral) hemoglobin oscillations. The latter allows the tracking of the20 cerebral dynamics with the temporal detail of the neuronal processes (1 ms)21 but suffers from volume conduction. Their integration holds the promise of22 achieving spatial resolutions on the order of millimeters and temporal res-23\nolutions in the range of milliseconds, representing an exclusive opportunity24 to explore the dynamics of brain activity. In this context, network neuro-25 science offers a valuable approach to model and investigate brain dynamics,26 as well as to explore the potential of multimodal approaches in inferring27 brain functions. Large-scale functional brain connectivity can be modeled28 as a network or graph. When different modalities are examined, it is com-29 mon to perform global comparisons [42, 58], which allows direct comparison30 of the properties of the different modalities. Regional and network-level31 relationships have been explored using electrophysiological and fMRI record-32 ings, suggesting that the relationship between the two modalities may be33 affected by distinct cytoarchitecture and laminar structure of brain regions34 [46]. Moreover, the relationship between hemodynamic and electromagnetic35 networks has been predominantly focused within different frequency bands,36 suggesting that hemodynamic connectivity cannot be explained by electri-37 cal activity in a single frequency band but rather arises from the combina-38 tion of multiple frequency bands [45]. However, how the electromagnetic39 and hemodynamic networks relate to one another remains an exciting open40 question. Given the increasing interest in multimodal imaging approaches,41 there is a need for a more sophisticated mathematical framework exceeding42 merely comparative analyses between modalities. Such a framework should43 discern the similarities or dissimilarities between the functional EEG and44 fNIRS networks. Within this context, the graph-based network analysis ap-45 proach is a powerful tool for characterizing topological properties of the brain46 networks. In addition, the multilayer network approach has emerged as an47 innovative mathematical framework that facilitates the integration of differ-48 ent biophysical information, displaying promising outcomes in the field of49 neuroscience [59, 13, 29]. The primary contribution of this study is to inves-50 tigate the correspondence between fNIRS-based functional connectivity and51 EEG functional connectivity, emphasizing the shared patterns and distinc-52 tions in the network structures of the two modalities through graph analysis.53 Additionally, we shed light on how the interplay between electrophysiolog-54 ical and hemodynamic activities varies between the resting state (RS) and55 task-related conditions. Lastly, we provide a more holistic perspective on56 brain functionality by using a multilayer approach to investigate whether57 the integration of complementary information from various sources provides58 a clearer picture of brain dynamics than the unimodal approach for inferring59 brain functions.60\n2. Materials and Methods61\nSynchronous EEG and fNIRS recordings during the resting state and62 motor imagery task from 18 healthy subjects (28.5 \u00b1 3.7 years) were obtained63 from an open dataset [49]. EEG data were recorded with 32 electrodes placed64 according to the international 10-5 system (AFp1, AFp2, AFF1h, AFF2h,65 AFF5h, AFF6h, F3, F4, F7, F8, FCC3h, FCC4h, FCC5h, FCC6h, T7, T8,66 Cz, CCP3h, CCP4h, CCP5h, CCP6h, Pz, P3, P4, P7, P8, PPO1h, PPO2h,67 POO1, POO2 and Fz for ground electrode). Those are referenced to the68 linked mastoid at a 1000 Hz sampling rate (down-sampled to 200 Hz). fNIRS69 data were collected by 36 channels (14 sources and 16 detectors with an inter-70 optode distance of 30 mm), following the standardized 10-20 EEG system,71 at a 12.5 Hz sampling rate (down-sampled to 10 Hz) as depicted in Figure 1.72 Two wavelengths at 760 nm and 850 nm were used to measure the changes73 in oxygenation levels. all the steps of the pipeline, starting from EEG and74 fNIRS data acquisition to the construction of the brain network, along with75 an overview of the methods used are summarized in Figure 2.76\n2.1. EEG and fNIRS data pre-processing77\nCompared to our previous study [5], we have introduced further prepro-78 cessing steps aimed at enhancing data quality, primarily for fNIRS signals.79 Following the implementation of this new preprocessing pipeline (details are80\nbelow), only 18 subjects out of the initial 29 have been retained as they exhib-81 ited high-quality signals in both EEG and fNIRS and were thus included in82 the subsequent analyses. A standardized pre-processing pipeline was applied83 to remove artifacts from EEG and fNIRS recordings using the MNE toolbox84 [22]. EEG data was first re-referenced using a common average reference85 and filtered (second-order zero-phase Butterworth type FIR low-pass filter)86 with a cut-off of 1 Hz. The infomax algorithm was employed for performing87 independent component analysis (ICA) in a semi-automatic manner to iden-88 tify and eliminate artifacts originating from biological sources such as muscle89 activity, blinks, and eye movements, as well as non-biological sources such as90 line noise and other environmental or instrumental interferences [39]. This91 involved visually inspecting various diagnostic measures of each independent92 component, including topography, epochs image, power spectrum, and epoch93 variance. Then the cleaned data were filtered (second-order zero-phase But-94 terworth type FIR highpass filter) with a cut-off of 45 Hz. The implemented95 pre-processing pipeline for fNIRS data included the conversion of raw data96 to optical density (OD) and the assessment of data quality through the com-97 putation of the scalp-coupled index (SCI). We then identified the channels98 displaying an SCI < 0.7, which were labeled as \u2019bad channels\u2019. Subjects99 exhibiting more than 50% of channels marked as bad were excluded. The100 OD signals were filtered by a finite impulse response (FIR) bandpass filter101 with cutoff frequencies of 0.02-0.08 Hz. Bad time segments containing exces-102 sive head movements were identified and rejected using the global variance103 in temporal derivative (GVTD) metric, inspired by the concept of Deriva-104 tive of Variance of Root Mean Square (DVARS) in fMRI [48]. Time points105 with GVTD values larger than three times the mean GVTD value across all106 time points were flagged, and 15-second time windows centered around these107 points were considered bad time segments. These segments were automat-108 ically annotated and removed from the recordings. In order to address the109 issue of systemic physiological effects on the fNIRS signals, we decomposed110 the OD signals into multiple components by principal component analysis111 (PCA) and evaluated the spatial uniformity of each principal component by112 the metric of coefficient of spatial uniformity ([31]). Given that high spa-113 tial uniformity is indicative of superficial skin responses ([62]), the principal114 component with the highest spatial uniformity value was identified and sub-115 sequently removed from the reconstructed signals.116\n2.2. Signal reconstruction117\nSource EEG and fNIRS data reconstruction in source space were per-118 formed using Brainstorm software [55] and custom Matlab scripts [2]. For119 EEG a multiple-layer head model (Boundary Element Method-BEM) and120 an MRI template available in BrainStorm (Colin27) were used to build a121 realistic head model (forward model) by the OpenMEEG tool [21], which122 takes the different geometry and conductivity characteristics of the head123 tissues into account. The dipoles corresponding to potential brain sources124 were mapped to the cortical surface. The surface map was parcellated with a125 high-resolution mesh (15000 vertices). Finally, a lead field matrix, expressing126 the scalp potentials corresponding to each single-dipole source configuration,127 was generated based on the volume conduction model [34]. For the fNIRS, a128 five-tissue segmentation of the Colin27 brain template was used for the sen-129 sitivity matrix (forward model) computation. The fluences of light for each130 optode were estimated using the Monte Carlo simulations with a number of131 photons equal to 108 and projecting the sensitivity values within each vertex132 of the cortex mesh. The sensitivity values in each voxel of each channel were133 computed by multiplication of fluence rate distributions using the adjoint134 method according to the Rytov approximation [53]. Then the NIRS forward135 model was computed from fluences by projecting the sensitivity values within136 each vertex of the cortex mesh using the Voronoi-based method, a volume-137 to-surface interpolation method that preserves sulci-gyral morphology [27].138 Given each forward model for EEG and fNIRS, the brain activity was es-139 timated by the mathematical formulation of the inverse solution using the140 Minimum Norm Estimate (MNE) method. The minimum norm estimator is141 defined as:142\nG = BLT (BLT + \u03bb2C)\u22121, (1)\nwhere G represents the reconstructed signal along the cortical surface, L is143 the non-zero element matrix inversely proportional to the norm of the lead144 field vectors, B is the diagonal matrix derived from L, capturing the weight145 of each source, C is the noise covariance matrix describing the statistical146 properties of noise, and \u03bb is the regularization parameter that controls the147 trade-off between data fidelity and noise suppression, which is crucial for148 obtaining meaningful and accurate reconstructions. For EEG data, we em-149 ployed the standardized Low-Resolution brain Electromagnetic Tomography150 (sLORETA) to apply the MNE method. In the case of fNIRS data, we151 utilized the depth-weighted minimum norm estimate (depth-weighted MNE)152\nmethod. This choice was necessary because the standard MNE method tends153 to bias the inverse solution toward more superficial sources due to its sensi-154 tivity to near-surface signals. The depth-weighted MNE method addresses155 this bias by accounting for the varying light sensitivity at different depths156 within the brain tissue.157\n2.3. Unimodal network construction158\nIn order to be able directly compare the EEG and fNIRS source-time159 series, we mapped them to the same 3D space using an atlas-based ap-160 proach (Desikan-Killiany) [17] identifying 44 Regions of Interest (ROIs) that161 cover both modalities. The EEG ROI time series were then decomposed162 into the typical oscillatory activity by band-pass filtering: \u03b4(1\u2212 4Hz), \u03b8(4\u2212163 7Hz), \u03b1(8 \u2212 15Hz), \u03b2(15 \u2212 25Hz), and \u03b3(25 \u2212 45Hz), while fNIRS source164 time series were converted into oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-165 genated hemoglobin (HbR) by applying the modified Beer-Lambert trans-166 formation [10]. The Functional Connectivity (FC) matrices for the 44 ROIs167 within EEG (for each frequency band) were derived through the utilization168 of Phase Locked Value (PLV), whereas for fNIRS (HbO and HbR) Pearson\u2019s169 correlation coefficient was employed to compute the FC matrices. This pro-170 cess generated a total of 7 connectivity matrices for each subject (5 for each171 EEG frequency band and 2 for hemodynamic activity of fNIRS) and for each172 condition (RS, RMI, and LMI), resulting in a total of 21 FCs.173 To facilitate the comparison and ensure that the thresholding process174 is more consistent across modalities, we first normalized the edge weights175 in both EEG and fNIRS FCs, and then, given our objective of investigating176 distinct topological features in brain networks obtained from EEG and fNIRS177 separately, we chose a thresholding method based on the percolation theory.178 This thresholding method has the advantage of preserving the topological179 properties of the original weighted networks by taking into account the whole180 network topology during the binarization process. We used the maximum181 threshold that maintains the topological integrity of the original network,182 which in this case is defined as the size of the largest connected component183 in the network [18].184\n2.4. Connectivity analysis of unimodal networks185\n2.4.1. Small-wordness186\nWe compared the topological characteristics of the group-level functional187 brain network derived from EEG and fNIRS for the three conditions (RS,188\nRMI, and LMI) through graph/network analysis using the brain connectivity189 toolbox (BCT) [44, 61]. To characterize the global topological organization190 of the whole-brain network, we chose Small-World propensity (\u03d5), Global Ef-191 ficiency (GE), Global Clustering Coefficient (GCC), and characteristic Path192 Length (PL) as features of interest.193 The small-world structure of a network characterizes its efficiency and194 cost-effectiveness. The mathematical formulation of the small-world index195 (\u03c3) is represented as \u03c3 = \u03b3\n\u03bb , which indicates small-world characteristics when196 \u03c3 > 1. However, since \u03c3 is defined as a ratio, when \u03b3 \u226b 1 and \u03bb > 1,197 networks will consistently show \u03c3 > 1. To overcome this limitation, we de-198 cided to adopt the metric of the small-world propensity. Specifically, the199 small-world propensity, denoted as \u03d5, quantifies how much a network\u2019s clus-200 tering coefficient (Cbrain) and characteristic path length (Lbrain) deviate from201 those of lattice (Clattice, Llattice) and random (Crandom, Lrandom) networks con-202 structed with the same number of nodes and the same degree distribution:203\n\u03d5 = 1\u2212 \u221a \u2206CC2 +\u2206PL2\n2\nWhere:204\n\u2206C = Clattice \u2212 Cbrain Clattice \u2212 Crandom\nand205\n\u2206L = Lbrain \u2212 Lrandom Llattice \u2212 Lrandom\nNetworks are considered small-world if they have a small-world propensity206 0.4 < \u03d5 \u2264 1. The concept of small-world propensity addresses several lim-207 itations found in previous scalar definitions of small-worldness. Firstly, it208 can incorporate weighted evaluations of the clustering coefficient and path209 length. Secondly, it is independent of network density, allowing for compar-210 isons of small-worldness between networks with significantly different den-211 sities. Lastly, this metric is informed by spatially-constrained null models212 [3].213\n2.4.2. Global graph metrics214\nAmong the global graph metrics, as a measure of functional integration,215 the GE is defined as the efficiency of information exchange in a parallel sys-216 tem, in which all nodes are able to exchange information via the shortest217\npaths simultaneously. Its inverse, the path length, is the average shortest218 path length between all pairs of nodes in the network. As a measure of func-219 tional segregation, the CC is the fraction of triangles around an individual220 node reflecting, on average, the prevalence of clustered connectivity around221 individual nodes.222 The graph measures were normalized by generating 100 randomized net-223 works (null models of a given network) while preserving the same number of224 nodes, and degree distribution. Then, for each measure, the ratio was calcu-225 lated as real metric over the matched random metrics. For the comparison of226 network topology features, we utilized the Wilcoxon test for paired data to227 assess the differences between EEG frequency bands with their corresponding228 fNIRS metrics, specifically (\u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 - HbO) and (\u03b4, theta, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 - HbR).229 Significance was established at a threshold of p < 0.05. To account for mul-230 tiple comparisons, we applied the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.231\n2.4.3. Edge-wise analysis232\nTo assess the similarities and differences in connectivity strength and233 patterns between EEG and fNIRS networks, we employed an edge-wise anal-234 ysis. Significant connections were identified by means of the cluster-based235 thresholding approach using the brain connectivity toolbox (BCT) [44, 61].236 For each edge of the 44 x 44 connectivity matrix, a two-sample paired t-test237 was performed independently between each modality (5 frequency bands and238 2 hemodynamic responses), and cluster-forming thresholds were applied to239 form a set of suprathreshold edges. The threshold was chosen based on240 Hedge\u2019s g-statistic effect size (ES) computed between each node of the two241 matrices, pairing each EEG frequency band FC with each fNIRS FC. The242 t-statistic corresponding to the Hedge\u2019s g score closest to 0.5 (medium ES)243 was chosen as the critical value (t-stat = 2.5, corresponding to p-values =244 0.01). Finally, an FWER-corrected p-value was ascribed to each component245 through permutation testing (5,000 permutations). Edges that displayed246 FWER-corrected p-values below the significance threshold of 0.05 were con-247 sidered positive results.248 We employed both a right-tailed t-test and a left-tailed t-test because249 of the absence of a priori assumptions regarding the direction of differences250 between the two EEG and fNIRS networks. The right-tailed test investigates251 whether the EEG network is greater than the fNIRS network, while the left-252 tailed test explores the possibility of the opposite relationship.253 Additionally, to assess whether the resulting significant networks exhib-254\nited similarities across different frequency bands, we computed the Pearson255 correlation coefficient to determine the similarity between each pair of result-256 ing matrices. For this purpose, a threshold of r = 0.5 was chosen arbitrarily257 as the criterion for defining such similarity, without optimizing this value. If258 two matrix pairs displayed an r-value < 0.5, it indicated that the relationship259 between the hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals varied depending260 on the specific frequency band.261\n2.5. Multimodal network construction262\nIn order to assess the potential advantages of integrating information263 from different modalities over using a single modality, we opted for a multi-264 layer network approach composed using custom-made scripts that integrate265 the Python libraries multiNetX [51] and NetworkX [24]. This involved con-266 structing a multiplex network of integrated EEG and fNIRS networks. The267 multiplex is a multilayer network employed to depict various interactions268 among the identical set of nodes. Each layer is distinguished by a distinct269 mode of interaction, and the interlayer connections exclusively link the same270 node across all layers. This mathematical framework proves valuable for en-271 coding information from brain networks generated using diverse edge weights272 as all layers are built using the same atlas. To mitigate potential bias due273 to the differences in link density and average connectivity across layers, we274 adopted a data-driven approach for the thresholding of the original EEG275 and fNIRS FCs, which were utilized in the construction of the multiplex net-276 works. Specifically, we generated binary networks in the shape of Minimum277 Spanning Trees (MST) by applying Kruskal\u2019s algorithm to the functional278 connectivity matrices associated with each EEG frequency band, as well as279 the fNIRS HbO and HbR data, as depicted in [6]. The MST is supposed to280 reduce the influence of spurious connections within the brain by considering281 strong connections that don\u2019t form cycles or loops to enhance the specificity282 of network topological characteristics. This configuration serves as the back-283 bone of the network and is unaffected by prevalent methodological issues284 including potential impacts of connection strength or link density on the285 inferred topological attributes of networks [52, 56].286 We integrated the MSTs to obtain an interconnected multiplex network287 (Full) for every subject. Each participant\u2019s multiplex thus consisted of L =288 7 layers: two for fNIRS (HbO and HbR) and five for EEG (\u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), with289 each layer containing the same set of N = 44 nodes, and M = N \u2013 1 = 43290\nintralayer links. The weights of the interlayer connections were set to 1, iden-291 tical to the intralayer connections, because there is no established method292 for determining biologically meaningful weighted interlayer links between dif-293 ferent modalities [6]. The resulting multilayer network was an LxN by LxN294 supra-adjacency matrix (Figure 3) with diagonal blocks encoding intralayer295 connectivity for each modality and off-diagonal blocks encoding interlayer296 connectivity. This multilayer was built for the three conditions (RS, LMI,297 and RMI), resulting in three multilayer networks. We then applied the same298 procedure to build the multiplex network exclusively for EEG (L = 5 lay-299 ers) by integrating the 5 FCs (\u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), and for fNIRS by integrating the300 2 HbO and HbR FCs (L = 2 layers). These multilayers were built for the301 three conditions, resulting in three multilayer networks for EEG and three302 multilayer networks for fNIRS.303\n2.6. Connectivity analysis of multimodal networks304\nTo investigate whether the integration of the information derived from305 different sources outperforms the unimodal approach in characterizing the306 topology of the whole-brain network, we compared the full-multilayers with307 the EEG- and fNIRS-multilayers by means of graph analysis. We chose the308 global multilayer graph metrics of Modularity (M), Global Efficiency (GE),309 and Path Length (PL) as measures of the effectiveness of the communica-310 tion, as those are the most commonly reported in the literature. M in graph311 theory refers to a measure that quantifies the division of a network into mod-312 ules or communities, where nodes within the same module are more densely313 connected to each other than nodes in different modules. It provides insights314 into the functional subgroups present in the network. High M values indicate315 a strong tendency for nodes to cluster together, while low values suggest a316 more random or uniform distribution of connections. All the global graph317 metrics were computed for each subject by aggregating these measures across318 layers to obtain one value per subject. A paired t-test for was used to assess319 the differences between full-multilayers and EEG-multilayers and between320 full-multilayers and fNIRS-multilayers network features. Significance was es-321 tablished at a threshold of p < 0.05.322 Additionally, we investigated whether the integrated information in the323 full-multilayer provides complementary or redundant information compared324 to a single modality (EEG-multilayer or fNIRS-multilayer). To achieve this,325 we calculated the nodal metric of Eigenvector Centrality (EC) to identify key326 nodes in the network, thus characterizing brain patterns. For each subject,327\nthe EC values were computed for each node in each layer separately and sub-328 sequently aggregated across layers to obtain one value per node, as described329 in [15]. We evaluated the (dis)similarity of brain activation patterns between330 the full-multilayers and each EEG- and fNIRS-multilayers using the Dice co-331 efficient of similarity, a statistic used to gauge the similarity of two samples,332 often used in image segmentation. For the calculation of this coefficient, we333 averaged nodal EC across subjects to obtain one value for each node per334 multilayer. This allowed us to assess the extent to which the multimodal335 approach aligns with the unimodal approaches in evaluating central brain336 regions during both resting state and task conditions. The high similarity337 suggests that, in a particular condition, information integration has a similar338 effect on capturing network structure compared to a single modality, indi-339 cating redundancy. Conversely, low similarity suggests that the integration340 of different modalities leads to differences in network structure, emphasizing341 the presence of complementary information.342 Then, we systematically computed differences in each task condition rel-343 ative to the RS as a baseline, enabling us to capture variations in brain344 activity during LMI and RMI for the Full-Multilayer, EEG-Multilayer, and345 fNIRS-Multilayer, separately. Subsequently, we extracted the cortical regions346 linked to the MI task according to the literature. These regions encompass347 specialized areas involved in motor planning and execution processes during348 MI, including the motor cortex (PreC), supplementary motor cortex (PaC),349 and somatosensory cortex (PoC). We also considered regions associated with350 MI, such as the temporo-occipital association areas (Cu, Fu, and MT), which351 are engaged in various cognitive functions, including attention, memory, and352 mental simulation of actions; the frontal and prefrontal associative cortex353 premotor cortex (SF) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (RoMF and CMF),354 involved in higher-order cognitive processes, including motor planning, mem-355 ory, and decision-making; the associative parietal areas (IP, SP, and SM),356 which contributes to various functions related to spatial awareness and sen-357 sorimotor integration.358\n3. Results359\n3.1. Unimodal networks360\n3.1.1. Small-worldness361\nThe primary aim of the study was to investigate the relationship be-362 tween fNIRS-based functional connectivity and EEG functional connectivity,363\nwith a focus on identifying commonalities and differences in their network364 structures. To achieve this we compared the topological characteristics of365 the group-level functional connectivity derived from EEG and fNIRS for the366 three conditions: RS, RMI, and LMI. For the assessment of the global topo-367 logical organization of the whole-brain network, the small-world propensity368 (\u03d5), Global Efficiency (GE), global Clustering Coefficient (GCC), and char-369 acteristic Path Length (PL) metrics were chosen. Topology analyses showed370 that all the EEG frequency bands (\u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) and fNIRS (HbO and HbR)371 have 0.4 < \u03d5 \u2264 1, which implies prominent small-world properties in both372 modalities and for each condition (Figure 4a). A real network would be con-373 sidered to have the small world characteristics if CCreal/CCrand > 1 and374 PLreal/PLrand \u2248 1. It means that compared to random networks, a true375 human brain network has a larger GCC and an approximately identical PL376 between any pair of nodes in the network. This was demonstrated for all377 EEG frequency bands by showing significantly higher GCC values than HbO378 (Figure 4b). It means EEG networks have better clustering ability and small-379 worldness than fNIRS. In particular, the \u03b1 band exhibited higher clustering380 in the RS condition, where this brainwave predominates. Conversely, during381\nRMI and LMI \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands showed higher GCC values, emphasizing the382 significance of these brainwaves in characterizing MI tasks.383\n3.1.2. Global graph metrics384\nOur observations revealed notable variations in GE, PL, and GCC values385 across different frequency bands and hemoglobin types (Figure 5, Table 1).386 We observed significantly higher GE values in the \u03b8 and \u03b2 bands compared to387 HbO, with no statistical differences in the LMI and RMI conditions . When388 comparing to HbR, higher GE values were evident in the \u03b8 band during RS,389 and in both the \u03b4 and \u03b8 bands during the RMI condition. No significant390 differences were observed in the LMI condition. During RS, EEG shows391 higher information exchange capacity in specific frequency bands compared392 to fNIRS, while in task conditions, the efficiency of distributed information393 processing in the brain network between the two modalities is more similar.394 For the PL measure, we observed significantly lower values in RS for \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b2,395 and \u03b3 bands compared to HbO, and \u03b8, \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands compared to HbR. In396 RMI, \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, and \u03b3 bands exhibited lower values compared to HbO, and all the397 frequency bands had lower values compared to HbR. For LMI, HbO and HbR398 showed differences in the \u03b4, \u03b1, and \u03b3 bands for fNIRS > EEG. The variations399 observed in these frequency bands further emphasize the complex interplay400 of modalities and conditions in shaping the brain\u2019s functional connectivity401 and network efficiency. Statistically higher values for GCC were exhibited402 in \u03b4, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 bands compared to HbO and all the frequency bands vs.403 HbR during the RS. Brain regions within these frequency bands are more404 likely to form tightly connected clusters, suggesting a higher degree of local405 connectivity or modularity during rest. During the task, for LMI, higher406 GCC values were shown in \u03b4, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 compared to both HbO and HbR,407 while for RMI, in \u03b4, \u03b2, and \u03b3 bands compared to both HbO and HbR. This408 finding implies that these frequency bands play a significant role in the local409 connectivity patterns within the brain network during cognitive tasks.410"

            "text": "The edge-wise analysis was applied via the cluster-based thresholding ap-412 proach to assess the similarities and differences in connectivity strength and413 patterns between EEG and fNIRS networks. This analytical method identi-414 fied subnetworks characterized by increased functional connectivity in HbO415 and HbR compared to EEG, as determined by a left-tailed t-test, across all416 frequency bands and conditions (RS, LMI, and RMI) at a predefined thresh-417\nold of 2.5. Specifically, during the RS condition, we identified a large sub-418 network with increased connectivity in \u03b4-HbO, \u03b1-HbO, and \u03b2-HbO (Figure419 6), and in \u03b4-HbR, \u03b8-HbR, \u03b1-HbR, \u03b2-HbR, and \u03b3-HbR (Figure 7). This sub-420 network exhibited preferentially interhemispheric and homotopic connections421 between various cortical regions, including the left precuneus (Cu), bilateral422 inferior parietal (IP), bilateral supplementary motor (PaC), post-postcentral423 gyrus (PoC), right middle temporal gyrus (MT), left medial frontal cortex424 (mOF), and bilateral pars opercularis of inferior frontal gyrus (Op). While,425 for \u03b8-HbO and \u03b3-HbO, two distinct subnetworks were identified. One subnet-426 work resembled the aforementioned large subnetwork, while the other com-427 prised the right superior frontal cortex (SF), superior parietal (SP), and428 superior temporal regions (ST).429 During the task conditions (RMI and LMI), both showed a shared promi-430 nent subnetwork characterized by increased connectivity in \u03b1-HbO, \u03b2-HbO,431 and \u03b3-HbO, as well as in \u03b1-HbR, \u03b2-HbR, and \u03b3-HbR (Figures 8, 9). This432 subnetwork exhibited similar characteristics to those observed in the RS con-433 dition. However, for \u03b8-HbO and \u03b4-HbO, as well as \u03b8-HbR and \u03b4-HbR, distinct434 subnetworks with increased connectivity were identified. One of these sub-435 networks, consistent for both tasks, established connections between regions436 such as the bilateral inferior parietal (IP), bilateral supplementary motor area437 (PaC), and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Op). The438 other subnetwork, linked regions that included the bilateral medial frontal439 gyrus (mOF), right middle temporal gyrus (MT), and the right pars orbitalis440 of the inferior frontal gyrus (Or) in RMI. For LMI, it interconnected the bi-441 lateral medial frontal gyrus (mOF), right middle temporal gyrus (MT), and442 the right pars orbitalis (Or) and triangularis (Tr) of the inferior frontal gyrus.443 We then proceeded to examine the extent of similarity within each pair of re-444 sulting matrices across different frequency bands. Pearson correlation values445 (r) > 0.5 were chosen as the cutoff for determining similarity. Our find-446 ings revealed that only \u03b8-HbO vs. \u03b2-HbO and \u03b8-HbO vs. \u03b4-HbO in the RS447 condition, and \u03b8-HbR vs. \u03b1-HbR, \u03b2-HbR, and \u03b3-HbR in the LMI condition,448 exhibited dissimilar subnetworks. In certain conditions and frequency bands,449 these FC matrices did not exhibit strong similarity, suggesting unique pat-450 terns in brain activity in these specific combinations of frequency bands and451 conditions.452 However, when performing the right-tailed t-test, we pinpointed out sub-453 networks demonstrating increased functional connectivity within the EEG454 network relative to fNIRS. These subnetworks displayed intrahemispheric455\nconnections characterized by more clustered and distinct patterns across var-456 ious frequency bands.457 In the RS condition, we observed fewer differences between the two modal-458 ities than in tasks, particularly in \u03b4-HbO and \u03b8-HbO, where only two sub-459 networks were identified. These subnetworks connected regions such as the460 left pars orbitalis and pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Or, Tr),461 the superior frontal gyrus (SF), and the pericalcarine cortex (PerCa) in one462 case, and the right inferior parietal (IP), medial orbitofrontal (mOF) right463 pericalcarine cortex (PerCa) in the other.464 For \u03b1-HbO and \u03b2-HbO, we observed six subnetworks of higher connec-465 tivity, with two of them resembling the \u03b4-HbO and \u03b8-HbO patterns (Figure466 6). Three shared intrahemispheric subnetworks exhibited more clustered pat-467 terns, connecting regions such as the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal468 gyrus (Op), pre-central gyrus (PreC), frontal cortex (Fpol), and rostral mid-469 dle frontal cortex (RoMF) of the left hemisphere in the first subnetwork.470 The second subnetwork linked the same regions in the right hemisphere,471 while the third subnetwork connected temporo-parietal areas (B, IP, SM)472 and para-central regions (PaC). Similar patterns were identified in the task473 conditions, both for LMI and RMI. Furthermore, highly clustered intrahemi-474 spheric subnetworks were identified in \u03b4-HbR, \u03b8-HbR, \u03b1-HbR, \u03b2-HbR, and475 \u03b3-HbR in all three conditions 7). The only non-significant result was observed476 in \u03b8-HbR during the RS condition.477 The similarity evaluation of these subnetworks across different frequency478 bands highlighted dissimilarity between \u03b4-HbO vs. \u03b8-HbO, \u03b1-HbO, and \u03b3-479 HbO in RS, between \u03b4-HbO vs. \u03b2-HbO, \u03b1-HbO, and \u03b8-HbO in LMI, and480 between \u03b4-HbO vs. \u03b8-HbO, \u03b1-HbO, and \u03b2-HbO, as well as \u03b8-HbO vs. \u03b2-481 HbO in RMI. Furthermore, subnetworks with r < 0.5 were predominantly482 identified during tasks in the case of \u03b8-HbR vs. \u03b1-HbR, \u03b2-HbR, and \u03b3-HbR483 for both LMI and RMI, while no such differences were observed in RS. In484 the case of \u03b4-HbR vs. \u03b1-HbR, \u03b2-HbR, and \u03b3-HbR in RMI, as well as \u03b4-HbR485 vs. \u03b1-HbR and \u03b2-HbR in LMI. Dissimilarity was also evident in RS between486 \u03b4-HbR vs. \u03b2-HbR and \u03b3-HbR.487\n3.2. Multilayer networks488\nThe last aim of this study was to investigate whether the integration of489 information from EEG and fNIRS provides a clearer picture of brain dynam-490 ics than the unimodal approach for inferring brain functions. To achieve this491 scope we chose a multilayer approach and compared the full-multilayers with492\nthe EEG- and fNIRS-multilayers by means of graph analysis. We chose the493 graph metrics, of Modularity (M), Global Efficiency (GE), and Path Length494 (PL) as measures of the effectiveness of the communication. By aggregat-495 ing these measures across layers, the RS, RMI, and LMI conditions revealed496 distinctive modularity patterns within the Full-Multilayer network. Specifi-497 cally, significantly higher modularity values were observed when comparing498 the Full-Multilayer to each of the EEG and the fNIRS networks in both RS499 and task conditions, indicating a more pronounced modular structure in the500 former (Figure 10). However, when comparing the Full-Multilayer network501 to the EEG-multilayer, in LMI and RMI conditions, its modularity values502 were only slightly higher, suggesting a degree of similarity between the two503 approaches. On the contrary, significantly lower M values were observed504 when contrasting the Full-Multilayer with the fNIRS-multilayer, as well as505 when comparing the EEG-multilayer with the fNIRS-multilayer.506 These results suggested that the integrated approach excels in revealing507 modular structures in the brain that might otherwise remain obscured by508 unimodal techniques. Interestingly, while the multilayer approach surpassed509\nfNIRS in terms of modularity, it also displayed slightly higher modularity510 values when compared to EEG. This suggests that the multilayer approach511 manages to capture more of the brain\u2019s modular organization compared to512 fNIRS alone, but it may share some commonalities with EEG in this regard.513\n514 In all three conditions, RS, LMI, and RMI, the Full-Multilayer network515 exhibited significantly higher GE values when compared to both the EEG516 and fNIRS networks, indicating its superior capacity for global information517 transfer.518 Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was also observed when519 comparing the EEG-multilayer with the fNIRS-multilayer in the three con-520 ditions, with the fNIRS network exhibiting lower GE values compared to521 the EEG one. This difference suggests that the EEG network may exhibit a522 more efficient global communication pattern compared to the fNIRS network523 in both RS and task conditions.524 It\u2019s noteworthy that the PL values showed an inverse trend. In all three525 conditions, RS, LMI, and RMI, significantly lower PL values were observed526 when comparing the Full-Multilayer network to both the EEG- and fNIRS-527 multilayer networks, suggesting more efficiency in terms of direct commu-528 nication pathways between network nodes in the former. However, in RS,529 no significant differences were found between the EEG and fNIRS multilayer530 network, while in LMI and RMI, the fNIRS network exhibited significantly531 higher PL values compared to the EEG. This suggests that, for electrical532 brain activity, the neural information is routed via more globally optimal533 and shortest paths compared to hemodynamic activity during a cognitive534 task. Thus, providing faster and more direct information transfer.535 Additionally, we investigated whether the integrated information in the536 full-multilayer provides complementary or redundant information compared537 to a single modality (EEG-multilayer or fNIRS-multilayer), in terms of spa-538 tial distribution of the active brain regions. We conducted this assessment539 by computing the Dice coefficient based on EC values to take into account540 the spacial information. The high similarity suggests that the integrated in-541 formation has a similar effect on capturing network structure compared to a542 single modality, indicating redundancy. Conversely, low similarity suggests543 that the integration of different modalities leads to differences in network544 structure, emphasizing the presence of complementary information.545 We observed, in the RS condition, a Dice coefficient of 0.91 when compar-546 ing the EC values of the Full-Multilayer with those of the EEG-Multilayer.547\nThis means that many brain regions exhibit similar EC values during RS,548 indicating redundancy between the two approaches. This implies that the549 EEG modality is suitable to characterize brain patterns in RS when used550 in isolation. In contrast, the comparison of Full-Multilayer EC values with551 fNIRS-Multilayer EC values yielded a Dice coefficient of 0.68. This sug-552 gests that the fNIRS approach captures somewhat different patterns of brain553 centrality during RS, implying that a multimodal approach can provide com-554 plementarity when different sources of information are integrated.555 Similar trends were shown during the task conditions. For both LMI556 and RMI, a higher coefficient of similarity was highlighted for EEG (Dice557 = 0.88 in RMI, Dice = 0.84 in LMI) indicating substantial similarity with558 full-multilayer, compared to fNIRS which showed lower values (Dice = 0.72559 in RMI, Dice = 0.63 in LMI), suggesting some differences with the integrated560 approach (Table 2). This indicated a certain level of redundancy and com-561 plementarity between the multimodal and the unimodal approach that is562 dependent on the modality and on the specific brain state, but also between563 the different types of tasks or the cognitive demand during the tasks.564\nThen, we systematically computed differences in each task condition rela-565 tive to the RS as a baseline, to capture variations in brain activity during LMI566 and RMI for the Full-Multilayer, EEG-Multilayer, and fNIRS-Multilayer,567 separately. Subsequently, we mapped the contrasts on the chosen cortical568 regions linked to the MI for all three multilayers.569 We found that during LMI, in the full-multilayer, 12 out of 26 cortical570 regions involved in MI were activated, including the supplementary motor571 cortex (PaC), premotor cortex (SF), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (RoMF,572 CMF), post-central gyrus (PoC), inferior parietal gyrus (IP), and temporo-573 occipital associative areas (Fu, Cu, MT, ST).574 In the EEG-multilayer, 8 out of 26 cortical regions including regions like575 the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (CMF), premotor cortex (SF), the post-576 central gyrus (PoC), and temporo-occipital association areas (Fu, Cu, MT,577 ST).578\nIn the fNIRS-multilayer, 5 out of 26 regions comprising areas like the pre-579 motor cortex (SF), pre-central gyrus (PreC), and the supplementary motor580 area (PaC), superior parietal gyrus (SP), and superior temporal gyrus (ST).581 During RMI, in the full-multilayer 6 out of 26 cortical regions involved in582 MI were activated, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (RoMF), mo-583 tor cortex (PreC), superior parietal (SP), and temporo-occipital associative584 areas (Fu, Cu, ST).585 In the EEG-multilayer, 6 out of 26 regions comprising the dorsolateral586 premotor cortex (CMF), motor cortex (PreC), and temporo-occipital asso-587 ciative areas (MT, Fu, Cu, ST).588 In the fNIRS-multilayer, 12 out of 26 regions including the somatosensory589 and motor cortex (PoC, PreC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (CMF, RoMF),590 supplementary motor area (PaC), premotor cortex (SF), superior and inferior591 parietal gyrus (SP, IP), and temporo-associative areas (ST, MT).592 These findings are summarized in Table tab:cortical-regions and indicate593 differences and similarities of activated brain regions during the task condi-594 tions across modalities.595\nTable 3: Active regions during LMI and RMI\nCortical Regions LMI in Full LMI in EEG LMI in fNIRS Supplementary Motor Cortex Yes No Yes\nPremotor Cortex Yes Yes Yes Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Yes Yes No\nPost-Central Gyrus Yes No Yes Inferior Parietal Gyrus Yes No Yes Temporo-Occipital Areas Yes Yes No\nCortical Regions RMI in Full RMI in EEG RMI in fNIRS Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Yes No Yes\nMotor Cortex Yes Yes Yes Superior Parietal Yes No Yes\nTemporo-Occipital Areas Yes Yes Yes\n4. Discussion596\nIn this study, our primary focus was to examine the correspondence597 between fNIRS functional connectivity and EEG functional connectivity.598\nOur emphasis was on discerning both shared characteristics and divergences599 in network topology between these two modalities across frequency bands600 through graph analysis. Additionally, we investigated how the interplay be-601 tween electrophysiological and hemodynamic activities varies between the602 resting state (RS) and task-related conditions (left and right motor imagery603 task namely LMI and RMI respectively).604 We observed a small-world propensity for both modalities in the three605 conditions (RS, LMI, and RMI). The small-world structure of a network606 characterizes its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our findings agree with607 previous results, supporting the assumption that small-worldness is a uni-608 versal principle for the functional wiring of the human brain regardless of609 the distinct mechanisms of different imaging techniques [3]. However, the610 brain supports both segregated and distributed information processing, a key611 for cognitive processing, which means that localized activity in specialized612 regions is spread by coherent oscillations in large-scale distributed systems613 [44]. The global clustering coefficient (GCC) measures the clustering ability614 within the network, while the characteristic path length (PL) assesses how615 efficiently information travels within the network. We showed that all EEG616 frequency bands had significantly higher GCCs than HbO and HbR, while617 all EEG and fNIRS networks exhibited PL values of approximately 1. This618 indicates that the electrical networks have a better ability to form clusters or619 subgroups of interconnected nodes in the brain, but also that both EEG and620 fNIRS networks exhibit an efficient information transfer across the network,621 thus resulting in a small-world topology. This topology was observed for622 both the RS and the task conditions. Notably, during the RS, the \u03b1 band623 exhibited higher clustering, aligning with its predominance during periods of624 rest and in agreement with previous studies. In contrast, during the tasks, we625 observed increased GCC in the \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands, frequencies closely associated626 with motor imagery tasks [45], [35], [20], [40].627 Moreover, the findings are consistent with the understanding that differ-628 ent brain networks are selectively engaged with specific frequency bands. For629 instance, the dorsal attentional network (DAN) and somatomotor network630 (SMN) are primarily associated with alpha and beta oscillations, and the631 ventral attentional network (VAN) is linked to gamma oscillations [38].632 Our observations revealed higher global efficiency (GE) for the EEG net-633 work compared to the fNIRS (HbO) network only during RS and only in \u03b8634 and \u03b2 frequency bands, while in \u03b8 band as compared to HbR. This suggests635 that during RS, EEG shows higher information exchange capacity in specific636\nfrequency bands compared to fNIRS. On the contrary, in task conditions,637 when compared to HbO, no differences were pointed out, suggesting that the638 efficiency of distributed information transfer in the brain network between639 the two modalities is more similar when increasing the synchronization of640 neuronal oscillations for sustained brain activation, such as during a cogni-641 tive task. In fact, functional similarity between neighboring units minimizes642 the required wiring and may contribute to the high efficiency of information643 transfer [8].644 These differences and similarities between the two modalities could be re-645 lated to the different sensitivities and the temporal dynamics of these modal-646 ities to neural activity. The highest temporal resolution of EEG allows to647 capture of faster changes in neural activity, thus providing a more precise648 estimation of the timing of information transfer between brain regions in649 RS, which could contribute to higher global efficiency. On the contrary,650 fNIRS provides insights into the slower hemodynamic responses associated651 with longer-lasting and sustained neural processes, comprising cognitive tasks652 that involve extensive coordination across various brain regions [36].653 Additionally, the variation observed in PL (lower values) and GCC (higher654 values) within the EEG network for almost all frequency bands compared to655 both HbO and HbR, suggests that, electrical networks have a better ability656 to form clusters of interconnected nodes in the brain and that the neural in-657 formation is routed via more globally optimal and shortest paths compared658 to hemodynamic activity. This provides faster and more direct information659 transfer [8]. These findings are consistent for both RS and task conditions,660 highlighting the complex interplay of frequency bands and brain state in661 shaping the brain\u2019s functional connectivity and network structure [45].662 Cognitive states involve the engagement of different oscillatory frequencies663 within cortical networks, often lasting mere milliseconds during resting states664 [7], [23] and those states often last only a few ms. It is widely accepted that665 the short- and long-range organizations of neural oscillations from different666 frequencies depend on how those oscillations work together and that more667 than one EEG frequency band has been associated with the same resting668 state network [38], [45], [20]. Therefore, there is an advantage of EEG in669 capturing these transient neuronal activations. In contrast, fNIRS is limited670 in its ability to distinguish these rapidly changing neural responses, given671 that the hemodynamic response is delayed by several seconds, thus reflecting672 the sum of several oscillatory network configurations. [38],673 The edge-wise analysis highlighted a large subnetwork with increased674\nconnectivity for the fNIRS network over EEG, exhibiting preferentially in-675 terhemispheric and homotopic connections between various cortical regions.676 Also, EEG networks demonstrated increased functional connectivity over677 fNIRS networks in intrahemispheric connections that are characterized by678 more clustered and distinct patterns across various frequency bands. The679 findings may imply that the generation of homologous connectivity is through680 direct structural connection, while intrahemispheric connectivity may reflect681 the synchronization of transient neural activation among distant cortical re-682 gions. Several studies suggested that oscillations at higher and lower frequen-683 cies may support short- and long-range connectivity patterns, respectively,684 and that slower oscillations are better suited than faster oscillations for sup-685 porting long-range connectivity in the brain, which in turn promotes high-686 order brain functions [12] [28] [32]. Indeed, we observed fewer subnetwork687 differences between the two modalities in RS condition than in tasks, partic-688 ularly in slower frequency (\u03b4-HbO and \u03b8-HbO), while during cognitive tasks689 highly clustered intrahemispheric subnetworks emerged for all the frequency690 bands.691 When assessing the similarities of these patterns across frequency bands,692 for the networks favoring fNIRS over EEG, we observed dissimilar subnet-693 works only in the RS condition for \u03b8-HbO vs. \u03b4-HbO and \u03b2-HbO, and only694 in LMI conditions for \u03b8-HbR vs. \u03b1-HbR, \u03b2-HbR, and \u03b3-HbR. These findings695 can be explained by the different sensitivities and temporal resolution of the696 two modalities and by the coupling of electrical and hemodynamic activity697 governed by the neurovascular mechanism. Transient increases in neuronal698 synchronization in the alpha, beta, or gamma frequencies are typically fol-699 lowed by a decline in the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (because of700 its usage), thus correlating with lower metabolic demand [41], [30].701 On the contrary, when investigating the similarity of these subnetworks702 across different frequency bands, for the networks favoring EEG over fNIRS,703 differences were highlighted between lower (\u03b4-HbO, \u03b8-HbO, and \u03b4-HbR, \u03b8-704 HbR) vs. higher frequency bands (\u03b1-HbO, \u03b2-HbO, and \u03b3-HbO, and \u03b1-HbR,705 \u03b2-HbR, and \u03b3-HbR) in both RS and tasks. The dissimilarity between specific706 frequency bands in the RS condition suggests that even during a supposed707 state of rest, the brain exhibits variability in activity patterns. This variabil-708 ity might be due to factors such as internal thought processes, background709 sensory input, or fluctuations in attention [38]. In contrast, during tasks ob-710 served dissimilarity can be attributed to the cognitive demands and specific711 neural processes associated with these tasks. Task-related dissimilarity could712\nbe due to the dynamic reconfiguration of neural networks to adapt to the cog-713 nitive demands of the tasks and may be indicative of how different cognitive714 functions engage distinct brain regions or networks [7], [45]. It was suggested715 that the preferential neural oscillation for network connectivity depends on716 the spatial distribution of the RSN nodes and structural connections in the717 brain [19], [54]. However, future studies may provide novel insights into the718 possible relationships between network topology and preferential oscillations.719 In the final objective of our study, we employed a multilayer approach720 to examine whether it outperforms the unimodal approach in characterizing721 the topology of the brain network, thus providing a clearer picture of brain722 functioning. Additionally, we probed whether the integrated information in723 the full-multilayer provides complementary or redundant information com-724 pared to a single modality. We compared the full-multilayers with the EEG-725 and fNIRS-multilayers by means of graph analysis. We chose the graph met-726 rics, of Modularity (M), Global Efficiency (GE), and Path Length (PL) as727 measures of the effectiveness of the communication. We found significantly728 higher M values when comparing the Full-Multilayer to each of the EEG and729 the fNIRS networks in both RS and task conditions, indicating a more pro-730 nounced modular structure in the Full-Multilayer. These results suggested731 that the integrated approach excels in revealing modular structures in the732 brain that might otherwise remain obscured by unimodal techniques. Inter-733 estingly, while the full-multilayer surpassed the fNIRS-multilayer in terms734 of modularity, it also displayed slightly higher M values when compared735 to the EEG-multilayer. This means that the full-multilayer captures more736 of the brain\u2019s modular organization compared to the fNIRS network alone,737 but it may share some commonalities with the EEG network in this re-738 gard. Beyond M, we also examined GE and PL within the networks. The739 Full-Multilayer consistently outperformed both the EEG-multilayer and the740 fNIRS-multilayer in terms of GE in all three conditions (RS, LMI, RMI),741 indicating its superior capacity for global information transfer. Notably,742 PL values showed an inverse trend. The Full-Multilayer consistently exhib-743 ited significantly lower PL values compared to both the EEG- and fNIRS-744 multilayer, underscoring its efficiency in terms of direct communication path-745 ways between network nodes. Several other studies have similarly determined746 that a multilayer network model contains non-trivial information that can-747 not be retrieved by considering individual layers independently [4], [13], [14].748 The primary rationale behind this phenomenon is predominantly conceptual749 and organizational. Vector labels, which encompass attributes assigned to750\nnodes or layers in the multilayer network, such as measures of connectiv-751 ity strength, gene expression profiles, or neurotransmitter levels in specific752 brain regions, provide a means of identifying meaningful subgroups within the753 comprehensive dataset. The analytic power of a multilayer network comes754 from comparing statistics across these subsets. The multilayer networks and755 network statistics are designed to operate across layers, thus the full multi-756 dimensional information can be retained, allowing for a richer analysis that757 could not be obtained from the aggregated single-layer network [60].758 Additionally, we investigated whether the integrated information in the759 full-multilayer provides complementary or redundant information compared760 to a single modality by means of the Dice coefficient of similarity.761 The results reveal differences between the multimodal and the unimodal762 approach. Specifically, during the RS, the Dice coefficient of 0.91 between763 the EC values obtained from the Full-Multilayer and those from the EEG-764 Multilayer indicates that many brain regions exhibit similar EC values, sug-765 gesting redundancy. This implies that EEG, when used in isolation, is suit-766 able for characterizing brain patterns during the resting state. Conversely,767 the Dice coefficient of 0.68 between the EC values obtained from the Full-768 Multilayer and those from the fNIRS-Multilayer suggests that the fNIRS769 network captures slightly different patterns of brain centrality. In this case,770 fNIRS appears to add information that is not present in EEG, suggesting that771 a multimodal approach can provide complementarity when different sources772 of information are integrated, thus enhancing the understanding of brain cen-773 trality during the resting state. Similar trends were observed during tasks774 involving motor imagery. For both LMI and RMI, EEG exhibited a higher775 Dice coefficient compared to fNIRS when compared to the Full-Multilayer.776 Overall, these results indicate the presence of some level of overlap and com-777 plementarity between the multimodal and unimodal approaches, which is778 influenced by the detection modality, specific brain state, and the type of779 activity performed. These findings underscore the importance of considering780 a multimodal approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of brain781 patterns in different contexts [43], [57], [25].782 To gain further insights, we systematically computed differences in each783 task condition relative to the RS as a baseline, to capture variations in brain784 activity during LMI and RMI for the Full-Multilayer, EEG-Multilayer, and785 fNIRS-Multilayer, separately. We mapped these contrasts on the chosen cor-786 tical regions linked to the MI for all three multilayers, to see if this approach787 outperformed the unimodality in capturing the centrality of the network.788\nWe found that, for both LMI and RMI, the full-multilayer identified a789 higher number of central nodes in the network than the EEG-multilayer,790 while compared to the fNIRS-multilayer only in LMI. The nodes identified791 and shared with full-multilayer were different from the EEG and fNIRS net-792 work. Specifically, fronto-posterior regions were detected by EEG-multilayer793 comprising the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporo-occipital associa-794 tive area, while fNIRS-multilayer captured brain activity in inferior parietal795 gyrus, post-central gyrus, and supplementary motor area. Remarkably, the796 premotor cortex was detected by both.797 We found that during LMI, 3 out of 6 cortical regions identified by full-798 multilayer, were captured by EEG-multilayer: DLPC, pre-motor cortex, and799 tempo-occipital areas. On the contrary, 4 out of 6 regions identified by full-800 multilayer involved, were captured by fNIRS-multilayer: SMA, pre-motor801 cortex, post-central gyrus, and inferior-parietal gyrus. Only one region over-802 laps between EEG- and fNIRS-multilayer. In RMI, 2 out of 4 regions identi-803 fied by full-multilayer, were also detected by EEG: motor cortex and temporo-804 occipital areas, while for fNIRS 4 out of 4: DLPC, motor cortex, superior805 parietal gyrus, and temporo-occipital area.806 Our results suggest that while there is a degree of overlap in activated re-807 gions across modalities, there are also unique contributions from each modal-808 ity. The full-multilayer approach, which integrates EEG and fNIRS data,809 captured a higher number of nodes activated during both LMI and RMI,810 than the unimodal approach. This indicates the potential for enhanced char-811 acterization of brain functions when different techniques are combined. For812 example, Battiston and colleagues (2017) [4] employed a two-layer multiplex813 network combining fMRI- and DTI-based connectivity networks to explore814 the recurrence of newly defined multilayer motifs. Their findings revealed sig-815 nificant variations in these motifs that were over-represented in the human816 brain, distinguishing them from previous findings solely based on structural817 connectivity. Similarly, in the work of Crofts and colleagues (2016) [11], a818 novel measure of structure-function clustering enabled them to probe func-819 tional connections that deviate from the underlying cortical structure.820 Our findings agree with previous studies demonstrating that a multi-821 layer representation of a human brain network can provide new insight into822 pathology. For example, greater classification accuracy in distinguishing be-823 tween healthy and schizophrenic patients was reported when compared to824 single-layer networks [16], or improvement in the discrimination between825 Alzheimer\u2019s disease and healthy populations [9].826\nMoreover, we observed that specific cortical regions were consistently ac-827 tivated across different modalities. This suggests that EEG and fNIRS, to828 some extent, can provide similar information about the neural processes oc-829 curring in certain cortical regions. This is advantageous when developing830 classification algorithms [63] or applications for brain-computer interfaces831 [37].832\n5. Conclusion, Limitations and Future Directions833\nOur study has successfully achieved its aim of comparing EEG and fNIRS834 and assessing the effectiveness of the multilayer approach. The results high-835 light differences in how EEG and fNIRS capture brain network topology in836 RS and tasks. EEG excels in capturing rapid changes during the resting837 state, while fNIRS provides insights into slower processes during cognitive838 tasks. These variations are linked to their distinct sensitivities and tempo-839 ral dynamics. The specific neural oscillations involved might depend on the840 brain\u2019s structure and resting-state network distribution. Future studies may841 provide novel insights into the possible relationships. From a multimodal842 perspective, we demonstrated that the multilayer approach offers advantages843 in revealing modular organization and improving global information transfer844 in the brain network. These findings have implications for neuroimaging re-845 search, highlighting the potential benefits of integrating multiple modalities846 for a more comprehensive understanding of brain function and organization.847 There are a number of limitations to the work presented here. A small848 sample size can limit the ability to draw robust conclusions. Despite metic-849 ulous preprocessing, data quality can vary between subjects and modalities,850 affecting the reliability of connectivity measures. EEG and fNIRS had lim-851 ited spatial coverage of the sensors on the scalp resulting in reduced brain852 regions with respect to the original Atlas. Motor imagery tasks exhibit high853 variability across subjects because of the difficulty of the task. We did not854 consider within-subject analysis which may account for this variability.855 From a more theoretical point of view, it is possible that the multilayer856 model itself could be expanded. For example, this framework allows for857 the integration of multiple modalities (e.g. EEG/fNIRS) and structural net-858 works. Previous studies have demonstrated that temporal networks exhibit859 distinctive phases of segregation and integration. Future investigations in860 dynamic multilayer analysis could delve into this phenomenon and explore861 how multilayer functional hubs facilitate the coordination of dynamical pro-862\ncessing. Finally, a practical implication of the current findings is that in863 future studies, researchers should carefully weigh the decision to employ a864 specific neuroimaging technique, taking into account its respective strengths865 and limitations and how this choice may impact their research outcomes.866\nAcknowledgements.
