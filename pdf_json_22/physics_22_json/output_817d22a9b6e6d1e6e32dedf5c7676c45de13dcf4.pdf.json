    "abstractText": "In this paper we address the problem of identifying contracting systems among dynamical systems appearing in mechanics. First, we introduce a sufficient condition to identify contracting systems in a general Riemannian manifold. Then, we apply this technique to establish that a particular type of dissipative forced mechanical system is contracting, while stating immediate consequences of this fact for the stability of these systems. Finally, we use the previous results to study the stability of particular types of Contact and Nonholonomic systems.",

INTRODUCTION\nContraction theory has appeared several times in the control literature (see [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5] for a survey on the subject). This subject has deserved some attention due to its potential applications in many areas ranging from bio-molecular systems to the design of controllers for mechanical systems (e.g., [6], [7], [8], [9]). In effect, contraction theory is a useful tool in nonlinear analysis to demonstrate stability properties of dynamical systems. Dynamical systems exhibiting contracting behaviour collapse exponentially fast into a single equilibrium point due to the fact that in a neighbourhood of an equilibrium point two initially distant solutions converge at exponential rate. As far as we know, the first time that contraction theory was studied in a coordinate-free setting using Riemannian manifolds was in [10], where the authors state and prove all the results using only intrinsic properties that do not rely on the particular choice of coordinates.\nThis paper tries to address the following fundamental question: \u201cOn which circumstances does a mechanical system exhibit contracting behaviour?\u201d. Some examples have been examined in the literature, for instance, in [10], the authors study the case of the damped harmonic oscillator and, in a slightly different setting, [9] examines specific examples of controlled mechanical systems. However, this question, as it is posed, is too general. On one hand, the important class of conservative mechanical systems do not have contracting behaviour.

Then, we examine the implications of this result in the contact formulation of dissipative system and in a special case of nonholonomic systems with symmetries.\nForced mechanical systems appear frequently in mechanical problems where a force that cannot be absorbed by the potential function is acting on the system. Typical examples of forces include friction, air resistance or external factors such as water currents or wind disturbances (see [11], [12], [13] for instance). We are specially interested in the former case. Both friction as well as air resistance are examples of dissipative forced systems where the force causes a consistent loss of total energy. The equations of motion for these systems a priori are non-variational, i.e., they are not derivable from minimizing the action function associated with a Lagrangian.\nContact Lagrangian systems have been developed in the last few years as an attempt to deal with dissipative systems in a unified framework (see [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]). In this framework, the action of the mechanical system is added as a variable to the phase space. Through a modification of the principle of least work ([15], [21], [22]), the modified variational principle outputs trajectories of a dissipative system evolving in a contact manifold [23]. This framework sheds some light on qualitative features possessed by dissipative systems. One of its main advantages is the existence of symmetries [15] and the possibility to apply reduction by symmetries techniques. It is worth mentioning that contact systems have also been used to model the evolution of thermodynamic variables [24], [25], quantum mechanics [19] and the evolution of finite state dissipative quantum systems [26].\nSome mechanical systems have a restriction either on the configurations the system may assume or in the velocities the system is allowed to go. Systems with such restrictions are generally called constrained systems [27]. In particular, nonholonomic systems [28], [29], [30] are systems for which the velocity is restricted. Similarly to a forced system, nonholonomic equations are non-variational. Some special examples of nonholonomic systems possess symmetries that allow to reduce the number of equations of motion ([31], [32], [33]). One of the most studied classes of examples is that of Chaplygin systems, in which both the Lagrangian function as well as the constraints are invariant with respect to some symmetry. Then one can take advantage of the symmetries to reduce the number of the equations of motion and the resulting (reduced) mechanical system happens to be a forced mechanical system. We take advantage of this\ncase to apply contraction theory to Chaplygin nonholonomic systems. See [34], [35], [36], [37] for a description of Chaplygin systems.\nIn this paper, we advance one step further in the direction of the coordinate-free description of contracting systems [10] and prove a sufficient condition for a system to be contracting on a general Riemannian manifold. Then, we show that forced mechanical systems satisfying some assumptions are contracting with respect to a Riemannian metric called the mechanical contraction metric. Hopefully, this result is the first building block of a general theory characterizing the situation for all forced mechanical systems. Then we discuss the implications concerning the stability of these systems and translate the result to the case of Contact Lagrangian systems. It is worth noting that we discuss briefly the implications for the stabilization of a Contact Lagrangian system, a question that remains to explore in the Contact literature. Finally, we take advantage of the existing symmetries in Chaplygin systems to identify examples that exhibit contracting behavior and examine the implications on the complete set of nonholonomic equations of motion. In particular, we address the question of stability for these systems.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we review the mathematical machinery used throughout the text. In Section 3, we review contraction systems in general Riemannian manifolds and we prove a new sufficient condition to find a contraction metric in Theorem 2. In Section 4, we get down to a particular type of forced Lagrangian system and, as the main result of the paper, we prove in Theorem 3 that under some assumptions these systems exhibit contracting behavior. In Section 5, we address a similar problem using the framework of Contact Lagrangian systems. And finally, in Section 6, we apply our main result to a special type of nonholonomic system with symmetries: Chaplygin systems."

            "text": "Suppose Q is a manifold of dimension n. Throughout the text, qi will denote a particular choice of local coordinates on this manifold and TQ denotes its tangent bundle, with TqQ denoting the tangent space at a specific point q \u2208 Q generated by the coordinate vectors \u2202\n\u2202qi . Usually vq denotes\na vector at TqQ and, in addition, the coordinate chart q i induces a natural coordinate chart on TQ denoted by (qi, q\u0307i). There is a canonical projection \u03c4Q : TQ \u2192 Q, sending each vector vq to the corresponding base point q. Note that in coordinates \u03c4Q(q i, q\u0307i) = qi.\nA vector field X on Q is a map assigning to each point q \u2208 Q a vector tangent to q, that is, X(q) \u2208 TqQ. In the context of mechanical systems, we find a special type of vector fields that are always defined on the tangent bundle TQ, considered as a manifold itself. A second-order vector field (SODE) \u0393 on the tangent bundle TQ is a vector field on the tangent bundle satisfying the property that T\u03c4Q (\u0393(vq)) = vq . The\nexpression of any SODE in coordinates is the following:\n\u0393(qi, q\u0307i) = q\u0307i \u2202\n\u2202qi + f i(qi, q\u0307i)\n\u2202\n\u2202q\u0307i ,\nwhere f i : TQ \u2192 R are n smooth functions. From now on, we will introduce concepts and properties that are valid for any manifold regardless of being a tangent bundle or not. To emphasize this, we will consider from now on any manifold M of dimension n. An equilibrium point of a vector field X on M is a point q\u0304 \u2208 M for which X(q\u0304) = 0. An integral curve of the vector field X is a curve \u03b3 : I \u2192 M with I \u2286 R such that \u03b3\u2032(t) = X(\u03b3(t)). The flow of X is a map \u03c6X : I \u00d7M \u2192 M for which the map t 7\u2192 \u03c6Xt (q) is an integral curve of X and \u03c6X0 (q) = q.\nA Riemannian metric g on a manifold M is a (0, 2) tensor such that for each fixed q \u2208 M , the map Gq : TqM\u00d7TqM \u2192 R is a symmetric positive-definite bilinear form on the vector space TqM . The Riemannian metric induces a norm at each base point q \u2208 M which we will denote by \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016g. With the definition of a norm, one can measure the length of a curve \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 M on M : L(\u03b3) = \u222b 1\n0 \u2016\u03b3\u2032(t)\u2016g dt. In\naddition, the distance between two points q0 and q1 is given by the infimum length among all piece-wise smooth curves connecting q0 and q1. The Lie derivative of a function f : M \u2192 R in the direction of the vector field X on M is given by the expression LXf = df(X). One can extend this notion to differentiate vector fields and tensors. In the first case, the Lie derivative of a vector field Y in the direction of X is given by the Lie bracket LXY = [X,Y ]. And in the second case, the Lie derivative of a tensor g in the direction of X is the (0, 2) tensor for which\n(LXg)(Y, Z) = X(g(Y, Z))\u2212 g(LXY, Z)\u2212 g(Y,LXZ).\nThe complete lift of a vector field X on M ([27], [38]) is a vector field on the tangent bundle TM denoted by Xc whose flow is T\u03c6Xt , where \u03c6 X t is the flow of X . If the local coordinates of X are X = X i \u2202 \u2202qi , then\nXc = X i \u2202\n\u2202qi + q\u0307j\n\u2202X i\n\u2202qj \u2202 \u2202q\u0307i .\nThe possible configurations of a mechanical systems are usually described by a manifold Q called the configuration manifold (for an introduction see [11], [12]). Given a Riemannian metric g in the configuration manifold Q, all the information about a mechanical system is contained in a function on the tangent bundle TQ called the Lagrangian of the system. Given a Lagrangian L : TQ \u2192 R, the equations of motion are given by Euler-Lagrange equations\nd\ndt\n\u2202L \u2202q\u0307i \u2212 \u2202L \u2202qi = 0.\nIf the mechanical system is subjected to external forces and impulses, this terms are dealt with independently from the Lagrangian. A force is a map F : TQ \u2192 T \u2217Q given in local coordinates by the expression F (vq) = F i(vq)dq i.\nIn the presence of external forces, the equations of motion must be modified according to\nd\ndt\n\u2202L \u2202q\u0307i \u2212 \u2202L \u2202qi = F i.\nThe kinetic energy of a system in a Riemannian manifold is given by a special Lagrangian function Lg : TQ \u2192 R defined by Lg(vq) = 1 2g(vq, vq). A mechanical system is said to be of mechanical type or is said to have a mechanical Lagrangian if it is described by a Lagrangian of the type L = Lg \u2212 V \u25e6 \u03c4Q, where V : Q \u2192 R is a smooth function called the potential energy.\nWe will consider throughout the text, mechanical La-\ngrangians of the form\nL(q, q\u0307) = 1\n2 q\u0307TMq\u0307 \u2212\n1 2 qTKq,\nwhere q, q\u0307 \u2208 Rn. In consequence, our discussion will be valid either for systems with configuration manifold Q = Rn or, if not, within a coordinate chart of a more general n-dimensional manifold. In addition, we will consider an external dissipative force of the form F (q, q\u0307) = \u2212bq\u0307idqi, where b > 0. In this way, the mechanical system satisfies the following equations of motion\nq\u0308 = M\u22121 (\u2212Kq \u2212 bq\u0307) .\nNote that the previous equations of motion can be seen as the integral curves of a SODE vector field \u0393 ([11], [12], [27], [29]) called a forced mechanical vector field. This force map is called dissipative since the derivative of the energy of the mechanical system along the trajectories decreases. In general, the energy is given by the expression EL = q\u0307 i \u2202L \u2202q\u0307i \u2212 L. In this case, we obtain d dt EL = \u2212b\u2016q\u0307\u2016\n2 < 0. A contact Lagrangian system is able to encapsulate dissipative behaviour in a single Lagrangian function, at the price of working in a higher dimension. The dynamics of dissipative systems may be described by a function called contact Lagrangian L : TQ\u00d7 R \u2192 R and by the equations of motion\nd\ndt\n\u2202L \u2202q\u0307i \u2212 \u2202L \u2202qi = \u2202L \u2202q\u0307i \u2202L \u2202z , z\u0307 = L,\nwhere (q, q\u0307, z) are the coordinates on TQ \u00d7 R (see, e.g. [15], [21]). Contact mechanical Lagrangians are of the type L = Lg\u2212V \u25e6\u03c4Q\u2212bz and, in particular, we will be interested in contact mechanical Lagrangians of the form\nL(q, q\u0307, z) = 1\n2 q\u0307TMq\u0307 \u2212\n1 2 qTKq \u2212 b m z,\nwith m, b > 0. The equations of motion are in this case\nq\u0308 = M\u22121 ( \u2212Kq \u2212 b\nm Mq\u0307\n)\n,\ntogether with z\u0307 = L. This approach has some geometric advantages ([14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [39]).\nLater, we will apply our main result to a special type of nonholonomic systems with symmetries: Chaplygin systems (see [34], [35], [36], [37]. A nonholonomic system is\na mechanical system whose velocities are constrained. In this text, we will consider only linear constraints on the velocities, implying that the velocity of the system is always contained in a subspace of the tangent space. This subspace, called the constraint subspace, is usually denoted by Dq and is locally given by an expression of the type \u00b5ai q\u0307\ni = 0. The nonholonomic equations of motion, as deduced from a Lagrangian function, are\nd\ndt\n\u2202L \u2202q\u0307i \u2212 \u2202L \u2202qi = \u03bba\u00b5 a i ,\nwhere \u03bba is a Lagrange multiplier that might be computed using the constraints (see [28], [29], [30]).\nNow, suppose that \u03a6 : G\u00d7Q \u2192 Q is an action of a Lie group G on a smooth manifold Q, denoted by \u03a6(g, q) = \u03a6g(q). Under mild assumptions (\u03a6 is a free and proper action) the natural projection \u03c0 : Q \u2192 Q/G is a surjective submersion onto the reduced space Q := Q/G.\nA generalized Chaplygin system is a nonholonomic system whose Lagrangian L : TQ \u2192 R is a G-invariant regular function for the lifted action of G on TQ, i.e., L(T\u03a6g(v)) = L(v), \u2200 v \u2208 TqQ. Moreover, the constraints Dq are also G\u2212 invariant, i.e., T\u03a6g(Dq) = D\u03a6g(q) and satisfy TqQ = Dq \u2295 Vq , where Vq \u2286 TqQ is the vertical subspace defined by the vectors vq whose projection by Tq\u03c0 vanishes. In this case, the constraint subspace is also called the horizontal subspace.\nGiven the properties satisfied by Chaplygin systems, every vector X \u2208 TqQ can be uniquely written as X = hor(X) + ver(X), where hor(X) is an horizontal vector field (resp. ver(X) is a vertical vector field), i.e., hor(X)(q) \u2208 Dq (resp., ver(X)(q) \u2208 Vq).\nThe horizontal lift of a vector field Y on the reduced space Q is the unique horizontal vector field Y H on Q that projects onto Y , i.e., Tq\u03c0(Y\nH(q)) = Y (\u03c0(q)). Analogously, the horizontal lift of a curve \u03b3 on Q is the unique curve \u03b3H on Q that projects to \u03b3 and whose tangent vector is horizontal at every instant.\nNow, given a generalized Chaplygin system, the nonholonomic equation of motion can be seen as the integral curves of a vector field \u0393nh \u2208 X(D). This vector field reduces to a vector field \u0393 = T (T\u03c0)(\u0393nh) called the reduced dynamics and whose integral curves are called the reduced trajectories. Conversely, the nonholonomic vector field is also the horizontal lift on the reduced vector field. In addition, the reduced vector field is a forced mechanical vector field for the reduced Lagrangian function l : TQ \u2192 R defined by l(X(\u03c0(q))) = L(XH(q)) for any X \u2208 X(Q) and some force map F : TQ \u2192 T \u2217Q related with the constraints (see more details in [34], [35])."

            "heading": "III. CONTRACTING SYSTEMS",
            "text": "First, we review the definition of a contracting system according to [10]. Note that, a contracting system is not only composed by a particular dynamics but also by an associated Riemannian metric and open subset.\nDefinition 1. A contracting system is a tuple (M,X, g,U) where M is a smooth manifold, X is a smooth vector field on M , g is a Riemannian metric on M , called the contraction metric, and U is an open subset on M such that there exists \u03bb > 0, called the contraction rate, for which\nLXg(vx, vx) 6 \u22122\u03bbg(vx, vx), \u2200x \u2208 U , vx \u2208 TxM. (1)\nUnder the hypothesis that the region U is K-reachable with K > 1, that is, for every pair of points x0 and x1 in U there exists a continuously differentiable curve \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 U satisfying \u03b3(0) = x0, \u03b3(1) = x1 and \u2113g(\u03b3) 6 Kdg(x0, x1), we have several results describing the qualitative behaviour of a contracting system. The following is the main theorem in [10] describing the implications of a system being contracting.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that (M,X, g,U) is a contracting system with contraction rate \u03bb > 0 and for some K > 1, U is a K-reachable forward X-invariant set. Furthermore, suppose that X is forward complete on U and denote its flow by \u03a6t(x). Then for each x0, x1 \u2208 U and t > 0 we have that\ndg(\u03a6t(x0),\u03a6t(x1)) 6 Ke \u2212\u03bbtdg(x0, x1).\nIn particular, we are interested in some consequences of the previous theorem such as the following Proposition from [10].\nProposition 1. In the conditions of the previous theorem, if assume in addition that (U , dg) is a complete metric space, then X has a unique fixed point x\u0304 \u2208 U and for each x \u2208 U , \u03a6t(x) \u2192 x\u0304 exponentially fast as t \u2192 +\u221e. Moreover,\nV (x) = \u2016X(x)\u20162g\nis a strict local Lyapunov function for the unique fixed point.\nSo far, we have established the most important consequences implied by contracting behaviour. The remaining of the section will be dedicated to establish criteria to find contracting systems. Below, we prove a sufficient condition to identify contracting systems.\nTheorem 2. If the symmetric (0, 2)-tensor LXg is negative definite on a compact set U\u0303 then (M,X, g,U) is a contracting system with U \u2286 U\u0303 an open subset.\nProof. Suppose that LXg is negative definite on U\u0303 . The proof is based on a topological argument. We will prove that if LXg is negative definite then there exists a small enough \u03bb > 0 making the symmetric (0, 2)-tensor LXg+2\u03bbg negative definite.\nIndeed, suppose that {hi}i\u2208N is a sequence of symmetric (0, 2)-tensors converging to a negative definite symmetric (0, 2)-tensor h, with respect to the norm\n\u2016h\u2016 = sup x\u2208U\u0303 sup \u2016vx\u2016g=1 |h(vx, vx)|.\nNote that this norm is well-defined, since U\u0303 is compact (see Lemma 3 in the Appendix for a proof). The fact that hi \u2192 h with respect to this norm means that for all \u03b5 > 0 there exists\nN \u2208 N such that \u2016hi\u2212h\u2016 < \u03b5. Therefore for any vx \u2208 TxM with x \u2208 U\u0303 and \u2016vx\u2016g = 1 we have that\n|hi(vx, vx)\u2212 h(vx, vx)| < \u2016hi \u2212 h\u2016 < \u03b5\nChoosing \u03b5 > 0 such that h(vx, vx)+\u03b5 < 0 which is possible since the function vx 7\u2192 h(vx, xx) has a maximum on the compact set \u2016vx\u2016g = 1, we guarantee that for i > N we have that hi(vx, vx) < 0. Now for any vx 6= 0 we have that\nhi(vx, vx) = \u2016vx\u2016 2 ghi\n(\nvx \u2016vx\u2016g , vx \u2016vx\u2016g\n)\n< 0\nfor i > N . Thus we have proved that the set of negative definite quadratic forms is open. Consider the curve\n\u03bb \u2208 [0,+\u221e) 7\u2192 LXg + 2\u03bbg.\nThen, since the set of negative definite quadratic forms is open, the curve must remain there for sufficiently small values of \u03bb. Choosing any open subset U inside U\u0303 , the result follows.\nRemark 2. The previous result gives us a simple way to determine whether a system is contracting. However, note that it gives us no estimate on which values the contraction rate may assume.\nA useful property to rewrite the contracting condition (1)\nis the following.\nLemma 1. Given a vector field X on a Riemannian manifold M with metric g we have that\nLXg(vx, vx) = 2X c(Lg).\nProof. Let (qi) be coordinates on Q and (qi, q\u0307i) be the natural coordinates on TQ. Let X = X i \u2202\n\u2202qi and Lg =\n1 2gij q\u0307 iq\u0307j . On one hand we have that\nXc(Lg) = 1\n2 Xk \u2202gij \u2202qk q\u0307iq\u0307j + q\u0307i \u2202Xk \u2202qi gkj q\u0307 j .\nOn the other hand\nLXg =\n(\nXk \u2202gij \u2202qk + gkj \u2202Xk \u2202qi + gik \u2202Xk \u2202qj\n)\nq\u0307iq\u0307j .\nSince g is symmetric, we may interchange indices i \u2194 j in the last term to get\nLXg = X k \u2202gij \u2202qk q\u0307iq\u0307j + gkj \u2202Xk \u2202qi q\u0307iq\u0307j ,\nwhich equals 2Xc(Lg).\nThus the contracting condition (1) becomes\nXc(Lg) 6 \u22122\u03bbLg (2)\nTherefore, the contracting condition can be written in terms of the contraction metric and its complete lift, and we can deduce when a system is contracting by only looking at the contraction metric and the geometry of the tangent bundle."

Then X is negative definite if and only if C and A\u2212BC\u22121BT are negative definite.\nSee [40] for a proof.

Suppose L : TQ \u2192 R is a Lagrangian of the type (3) subjected to the dissipative force given by (4) and such that K and M are symmetric positive definite real matrices. In addition, suppose that K and M\u22121 commute.\nLet q\u0304 be an isolated critical point of grad V which is also an equilibrium point of the equations of motion.

The condition that K and M\u22121 commute is achieved for instance when K and M are diagonal matrices.\nProof. Consider the Lagrangian function LG\u03b5 : T (TQ) \u2192 R determined by the kinetic energy.

It is easy to see that C is negative definite and invertible whenever \u03b5 < 1. Hence, let us suppose that \u03b5 < 1. It is not difficult to show that D\u03b5 is negative definite if and only if\nD\u0303\u03b5 = \u03b5(\u03b5\u2212 1)KM \u22121 +\nb2\u03b52\n4 M\u22122\nis negative definite.

Hence, for \u03b5 = 0, F0 = \u2212KM \u22121 is negative definite and for \u03b5 = 1, F1 = b2 4 M \u22122 is positive definite. Then by continuity reasons, there exists \u03b5 \u2208]0, 1[ such that F\u03b5 is negative definite.\nRemark 5. If M,K are in the conditions of Theorem 3, from Proposition 1, a Lyapunov function for dissipative mechanical systems is\nV (q, q\u0307) = \u2016\u0393(q, q\u0307)\u20162G\u03b5 .\nThus, for Lagrangian functions of the type (3) and dissi-\npative forces of the type (4), the Lyapunov function is\nV (q, q\u0307) =qTKM\u22121Kq + 2bq\u0307T (M\u22121K \u2212 \u03b5M\u22121K)q\n+ q\u0307T (K + b2M\u22121 \u2212 2b2\u03b5M\u22121)q\u0307\nFollowing Proposition 1, V is a strict Lyapunov function for the equilibrium point (0, 0) and all trajectories starting in nearby points converge exponentially fast to the equilibrium point."

Suppose L : TQ \u00d7 R \u2192 R is a contact Lagrangian of the type (7) and such that M is the diagonal matrix with all entries equal to m > 0 and K is a symmetric positive definite real matrix that commutes with M\u22121.\nThere exists a neighbourhood U of (0, 0) \u2208 TQ\u00d7R and a parameter \u03b5 such that (TQ,\u0393,G\u03b5,U) is a contracting system for the contact contraction metric G\u03b5.\nProof. First notice that since M is the diagonal matrix with all entries equal to m > 0, the equations of motion for are just\nq\u0308 = M\u22121 (\u2212Kq \u2212 bq\u0307) , z\u0307 = L.\nFollowing the same steps as in the proof of Theorem 3, we write \u0393c(LG\u03b5) where \u0393 is now the contact vector field and G\u03b5 is the contact contraction metric.\nThen\n\u0393c(LG\u03b5) = r0 \u2212 bwv TKq + bwv\u0307TMq\u0307 \u2212 b2w2,\nwhere r0 is the expression obtained in (6). Therefore, we must prove that the matrix\n\n\n\u2212b\u03b5KM\u22121 \u2212 b 2\u03b5 2 M \u22121 \u2212 12bKq\n\u2212 b 2\u03b5 2 M \u22121 (b\u03b5\u2212 b)In 1 2bMq\u0307\n\u2212 12bq TK 12bq\u0307 TM \u2212b2\n\n\nis negative definite. Using Lemma 2 and the fact that the upper left diagonal matrix is negative definite (as we have already seen in the proof of Theorem 3) all we have to check is that the real number x = \u2212b2 \u2212 BTA\u22121B is negative, where A is the upper left 2n \u00d7 2n matrix and BT = [\u2212 12bq TK, 12bq\u0307 TM ]. Notice that the second term is a quadratic form evaluated on the vector B. If (q, q\u0307) are restricted to a sufficiently small subset U containing 0, then the norm of BTA\u22121B can be made smaller than b2. Thus on U we have that x < 0.\nExample 2. Consider the mechanical system given by the contact Lagrangian\nL = 1\n2 q\u03072 \u2212\n1 2 q2 \u2212 bz.\nThe associated contact dynamical system is\nq\u0308 = \u2212q \u2212 bq\u0307, z\u0307 = L.\nThe contact contraction metric is now\nG\u03b5 =\n\n 1 b\u03b5 0 b\u03b5 1 0 0 0 b\n\n .\nAnd so we have to examine the nature of the quadratic form\n\u0393c(LG\u03b5) = \u2212b\u03b5v 2\u2212b2\u03b5v\u0307v+(b\u03b5\u2212b)v\u03072\u2212bqwv+bq\u0307wv\u0307\u2212b2w2,\nassociated to the 3\u00d7 3 matrix \n\n\u2212b\u03b5 \u2212 b 2\u03b5 2 \u2212 1 2bq\n\u2212 b 2\u03b5 2 (b\u03b5\u2212 b) 1 2bq\u0307\n\u2212 12 bq T 1 2bq\u0307 T \u2212b2\n\n .\nIf 0 < \u03b5 < 2 b2+2 , then the upper left 2\u00d7 2 matrix is negative definite. To show that the matrix above is also negative definite we need in addition that\nx = \u2212b2 \u2212BTA\u22121B < 0,\nwhere B is the vector with coordinates (\u2212 12bq, 1 2bq\u0307). Since the matrix A\u22121 also defines a quadratic form, if we squeeze the vector (q, q\u0307) to be small enough, then B will be also close to zero and x will approach the value \u2212b2. Therefore, there is a neighbourhood of 0 in which the matrix above is negative definite.\nRemark 6. As a sub-product of our approach, we may study the stability of contact systems with Lagrangian functions of the type (7) and where M,K are in the conditions of Theorem 4. In particular, from Proposition 1, a Lyapunov function for these systems is\nV (q, q\u0307, z) = \u2016\u0393(q, q\u0307, z)\u20162G\u03b5 .\nIn the last example, the Lyapunov function is\nV (q, q\u0307, z) = (1\u2212 2b2\u03b5)q\u03072\u2212 2b\u03b5q\u0307q+ b\n(\n1 2 q\u03072 \u2212 1 2 q2 \u2212 bz\n)2\n.\nFollowing Proposition 1, V is a strict Lyapunov function for the equilibrium point (0, 0, 0) and all trajectories starting in nearby points converge exponentially fast to the equilibrium point."

            "heading": "VI. APPLICATION TO REDUCED NONHOLONOMIC SYSTEMS WITH SYMMETRY",
            "text": "It is a well-known fact that when we have a symmetry, the number of equations describing the motion of nonholonomic systems may be reduced. Under certain conditions, the reduced system is Hamiltonian, meaning that it may be seen as the Hamiltonian vector field with respect to some Hamiltonian function defined on the reduced space ([35], [36], [37]).\nConsider, as an example, the vertical rolling disk with\npotential given by the Lagrangian function\nL = m\n2\n( x\u03072 + y\u03072 ) + I\n2 \u03b8\u03072 +\nJ 2 \u03d5\u03072 \u2212 1 2 (\u03b8 + \u03d5)\ntogether with the non-slipping constraints x\u0307 = R\u03b8\u0307 cos\u03d5, y\u0307 = R\u03b8\u0307 sin\u03d5 generating the distribution\nD =\n\u2329{\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8 +R cos\u03d5\n\u2202\n\u2202x +R sin\u03d5\n\u2202 \u2202y , \u2202 \u2202\u03d5\n}\u232a\nThis system is invariant under the action of translations, meaning that the group R2 acts on the configuration manifold Q = R2 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S1, according to the map \u03a6(r,s) : (x, y, \u03b8, \u03d5) 7\u2192 (x+ r, y+ s, \u03b8, \u03d5). Then both the Lagrangian function as well as the distribution are invariant with respect to the tangent lift of this action T\u03a6(r,s) : TQ \u2192 TQ. In fact, one may prove that this is an example of a Chaplygin system ([35]) associated to a projection \u03c0 : Q \u2192 Q := Q/R2 \u2261 S1 \u00d7 S1.\nThe complete equations of motion might be reduced using the projection by \u03c0. The reduced equations for this nonholonomic system are\n{\n(I +mR)\u03b8\u0308 = \u2212\u03b8\nJ\u03d5\u0308 = \u2212\u03d5\nwhich is a Lagrangian system with respect to the reduced Lagrangian l : TQ \u2192 R\nl = (I +mR)\n2 \u03b8\u03072 +\nJ 2 \u03d5\u0307\u2212 1 2 (\u03b8 + \u03d5).\nIn addition, suppose that a cyclic dissipative force is acting on the nonholonomic system in TQ of the type\nF = \u2212b ( \u03b8\u0307d\u03b8 + \u03d5\u0307d\u03d5 ) .\nThis external force respects the symmetry of the system and appears in the reduced equations of motion giving {\n(I +mR)\u03b8\u0308 = \u2212\u03b8 \u2212 b\u03b8\u0307 J\u03d5\u0308 = \u2212\u03d5\u2212 b\u03d5\u0307. (9)\nThe reduced system (9) is a mechanical system with a dissipative force in the conditions of Theorem 3. Therefore there is a neighbourhood U \u2286 TQ of the equilibrium point (0, 0, 0, 0) where the system is contracting for the metric\nG\u03b5 =\n\n   1 0 b\u03b5 0 0 1 0 b\u03b5 b\u03b5 0 I +mR 0 0 b\u03b5 0 J\n\n  \non TQ. Therefore, using Proposition 1, we conclude that trajectories of the reduced dynamics starting in U converge exponentially fast to the equilibrium point, with respect to the mechanical contraction metric G\u03b5 on TQ and for a suitable value of \u03b5.\nOn the original dynamics on TQ, this implies that the submanifold EP \u2286 D, locally defined by \u03b8 = 0, \u03d5 = 0, \u03b8\u0307 = 0, \u03d5\u0307 = 0 and the corresponding nonholonomic constraints x\u0307 = 0, y\u0307 = 0, is composed by equilibrium points of the nonholonomic system.\nNow, consider in the original tangent bundle TQ a Riemannian metric G satisfying the following conditions:\nG(XH , Y H) = G(X,Y ), G(XH , Z) = 0, \u2200X,Y \u2208 X(T Q\u0304) and Z \u2208 V, (10)\nwhere V is the vertical distribution. There exists more than one Riemannian metric satisfying these conditions. Note that the value of G on the vertical bundle is not fixed but it must be a symmetric non-degenerate tensor on vectors belonging to the vertical distribution. To such a choice of Riemannian metric on TQ we call an horizontal lift of the contraction metric G\u03b5.\nUsing any horizontal lift of the metric G\u03b5, we may deduce that any solution starting in a tubular neighborhood around the equilibrium submanifold EP converges exponentially fast to EP . Here, the distance of a point v \u2208 D to EP is given by\ndG(v, EP) = inf w\u2208EP dG(v, w).\nTheorem 5. Suppose that (L,D) is a Chaplygin nonholonomic system and suppose that the reduced dynamics is a mechanical system associated to a Lagrangian of the type (3). In addition, suppose that F is a cyclic force map and in the reduced equations appears in the form (4).\nThen there exists a tubular neighbourhood U of the submanifold EP of equilibrium points of the forced nonholonomic system (L,D, F ) such that any nonholonomic solution starting in U converges exponentially fast to EP , with respect to a metric G satisfying (10).\nProof. The distance of a point v in D to the equilibrium manifold as measured by G is always smaller than the length of an integral curve of \u0393nh that joins v and a point in the equilibrium submanifold. This curve exists in a tubular neighborhood of the submanifold EP , since it is the horizontal lift of a solution of the reduced dynamics that finishes in the equilibrium point. In addition, since this curve is horizontal, its length is the same as the length of the reduced curve as measured by the mechanical contraction metric G\u03b5, which tends to zero exponentially fast. Therefore, the distance on TQ must also converge exponentially fast.\nFrom Theorem 5, we deduce that any trajectory of the vertical rolling disk starting sufficiently close to the equilibrium submanifold\nEP = {(x, y, \u03b8, \u03d5, x\u0307, y\u0307, \u03b8\u0307, \u03d5\u0307) \u2208 D|\u03b8 = 0, \u03d5 = 0, \u03b8\u0307 = 0, \u03d5\u0307 = 0}\nconverges exponentially fast to a point in EP , with respect to an horizontal lift of the contracting metric."
