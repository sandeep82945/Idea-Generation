Results \u2022 Many American live in a banking desert or banking hinterland. Conclusions\n\u2022 This may make it harder on small businesses since they will not have as much access to \u201crelational lending.\u201d\n\u2022 The pandemic caused many businesses to layof their workers. \u2022 The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), was created in March 2020 to help\nstruggling small business owners retain their employees. \u2022 Loans were originally distributed through existing SBA 7(a) lenders.\nBanking Deserts and Research Question the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\nIntroduction \u2022 We examine how the preexisting geographic distribution of banks afected theData & Methodology disbursement of PPP loans. Results \u2022 We have three main hypotheses: Conclusions \u2022 Relative banking deserts and hinterlands received fewer PPP loans.\n\u2022 Loans went to relatively advantaged labor markets. \u2022 The smallest businesses (those with less than 50 and less than 10 employees)\nwere not the major benefciaries of the program.\nBanking Deserts and the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\nIntroduction Data & Methodology\nData & Methodology Results Conclusions\nBanking Deserts and the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\nIntroduction Data & Methodology\nResults\nConclusions\nData\n\u2022 PPP loan data come from the Small Business Administration (November 2020). \u2022 Number of loans, loan amount, number of jobs reported, and business address.\n\u2022 Banking data come from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration. \u2022 Number, type, and location of banks.\n\u2022 These data are combined with other county-level measures and then aggregated up to the commuting zone level.\nBanking Deserts and the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\nIntroduction Data & Methodology\nResults\nConclusions\nMain Specifcation\nYi = \u03b20+\u03b21Bank Concentrationi + \u03b22(Bank Concentration)i 2 + \u03b23Bank HQsi\n+\u03b24(BankHQs) 2 + \u03b25COVID19i + \u03b26NonWhite Shareii\nEmp.

Introduction \u2022 Diminishing returns to the number of banks are also present for the 2nd round of Data & Methodology loans (-0.317\u2217\u2217).\nResults \u2022 Bank Headquarters were not a signifcant factor in the second round. Conclusions\n\u2022 Hypothesis 2: \u2022 Commuting Zones with stronger labor markets received more loans, but the result is not as strong as the previous results (0.103\u2217). \u2022 Hypothesis 3:\n\u2022 The CZs with the a greater share of the smallest businesses still received fewer loans in the second round of funding (Less than 10: -0.096\u2217 ; Less than 50: -0.133\u2217\u2217\u2217).\nBanking Deserts and the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\nIntroduction\nData & Methodology Results\nConclusions\nFintech Sample\n\u2022 Part of the regulation change after the frst round of funding was allowing fntech companies to make PPP loans. \u2022 Fintech companies rely more on automation to make lending decisions.\n\u2022 Fintech companies are able to make loans remotely, so borrowers are not geographically constrained. \u2022 This may reduce the inequality of access that originally existed in the PPP.\nBanking Deserts and Fintech Results the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and \u2022 Hypothesis 1:\nStephan Weiler \u2022 CZs with fewer banks received more of the fntech loans (0.634\u2217\u2217\u2217).\n\u2022 These CZs also received a greater total amount per small business (0.724\u2217\u2217\u2217). Introduction \u2022 More jobs per small business were retained with the fntech sample in high Data & Methodology banking CZs (0.701\u2217\u2217\u2217).\nResults \u2022 Hypothesis 2:Conclusions \u2022 Places with a relatively stronger labor market did not get more of the fntech\nloans. \u2022 Hypothesis 3:\n\u2022 CZs with a higher share of small businesses with less than 10 employees were not disadvantaged for the fntech loans, but CZs with a greater share of small businesses with less than 50 employees did receive signifcantly fewer fntech PPP loans (-0.173\u2217\u2217\u2217).\nBanking Deserts and the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\nIntroduction\nData & Methodology\nResults Conclusions\nConclusions\nBanking Deserts and Conclusions the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\n\u2022 An existing relationship with a bank is benefcial for businesses. Introduction \u2022 Banks can utilize \u201csoft\u201d information and \u201crelational lending\u201d when making Data & lending decisions.Methodology Results \u2022 We fnd evidence that access to banks mattered for receiving PPP loans.\nConclusions \u2022 Places with a higher concentration of banks received a higher number of PPP loans.\n\u2022 This held when we examined the program in total, frst round loans, and second round loans. \u2022 Fintech loans improved access and went to places with fewer banks per person.\nBanking Deserts and Policy Implications the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\n\u2022 Access to banks should be taken into account for future similar programs. Introduction Data & \u2022 Fintech can be a solution to the issue of access and should be part of future Methodology\npolicy. Results Conclusions \u2022 More policies are needed to support community banks and increase access to\ncommunity banks.\n\u2022 Targeting the loans toward regions that faced particularly stark economic shocks would have help equalize the distribution.\nBanking Deserts and the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler Questions?\nIntroduction\nData & Methodology\nResults Conclusions\nKristopher Deming Stephan Weiler\ndemingkr@msu.edu stephan.weiler@colostate.edu\nBanking Deserts and the Paycheck Protection Program\nKristopher Deming and\nStephan Weiler\nNumber of PPP Loans by Bank Type\n(1) (2) (3)\nBanks + C.U.s per 10k people 1.002\u2217\u2217\u2217\n(0.0102)\n(Banks + C.U.s per 10k people)2 -0.527\u2217\u2217\u2217\n(0.000280)\nBanks per 10k people 1.030\u2217\u2217\u2217\n(0.0112)\n(Banks per 10k people)2 -0.552\u2217\u2217\u2217\n(0.000293)\nC.U.s per 10k people -0.019 -0.049 (0.0288) (0.0282)\n(C.U.s per 10k people)2 0.044 0.049 (0.0126) (0.0120) Comm.
