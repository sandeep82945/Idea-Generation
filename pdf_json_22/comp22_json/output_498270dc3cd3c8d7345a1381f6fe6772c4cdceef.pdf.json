    "abstractText": "Reactive power is the core problem of voltage stability and economical operation in power systems. Aiming at the problem that multi-objective normalization reactive power optimization function is dependent on weight, an integrated synthesis of adaptive multi-objective particle swarm optimization (ISAMOPSO) is proposed to achieve weight adaptive. Through seven test functions and three algorithm comparison experiments, it is proved that the ISAMOPSO algorithm has stronger global search capability and better convergence. Considering the optimal access position and capacity of distributed generation (DG), the ISAMOPSO algorithm is used for three-objective reactive power optimization. Finally, the results indicate that the ISAMOPSO algorithm can not only provide a variety of optimization schemes to meet different needs, but also realize dynamic reactive power optimization, which further proves that the algorithm can provide effective technical support for solving reactive power optimization problems in practical engineering.",

Introduction\nWith the proposal of the smart grid, it has become a developing trend that distributed generation (DG) gradually joins and becomes an essential part of the power distribution system [1,2]. Experts in the power industry generally agree that the adoption of DG technology is the main way to save money, reduce primary energy consumption, and improve the flexibility and stability of power systems [3\u20136]. However, the distribution network with the DG is a multi-power structure, and the capacity and location of the DG make the grid situation complicated when it is connected. The power flow and node voltage in the line will also be changed with the change of the power output of the DG [7,8], and even reverse power flow occurs. The distribution network is at risk of voltage overruns and voltage fluctuations [9]. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the control method of distributed generation in a distribution network to improve the reliability of the distribution network. Since the multi-objective reactive power optimization problem of distribution network with DG is a very complex non-linear problem, domestic and foreign scholars have proposed various simplified mathematical models and optimization algorithms to solve it. Many heuristics have been applied to reactive power optimization problems, such as genetic algorithms (GA) [5,10], particle swarm algorithms (PSO) [6,11,12], and deep learning algorithms [13]. Meanwhile, many scholars have improved these algorithms, which have improved the speed and accuracy of the algorithms to solve reactive power optimization problems to different degrees [14,15]. Considering that the influence of distributed generation joining the distribution network is complex and multi-layered, some mathematical\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1275. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14061275 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1275 2 of 21\nmodels of multi-objective optimization has been proposed. Taking Reference [16] and Reference [17] as examples, the optimization objectives are to reduce the system power consumption, improve the node voltage level and increase the voltage stability margin of the distribution network. After assigning a set of weights to several functions to be optimized and transforming them into a single objective function, the GA algorithm and PSO algorithm are used to solve the problem, respectively. The most common method in dealing with multi-objective problems is the simplification of multiple objectives, such as the weighting method, the \u03b5-dominant method, and the affiliation method. The single solution is very dependent on the selection of weights, especially in the case of being unable to subjectively judge the relationship between various objectives. It is difficult to determine the weight of each function to be optimized. In contrast, multi-objective optimization can effectively solve the multi-objective optimization problem, multiple solutions can be obtained after the iteration of the optimization algorithm, and decision-makers can flexibly select schemes according to the actual situation [18\u201320]. In Reference [21], a static reactive power optimization model with minimum network loss and voltage deviation is established and solved by the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Based on Reference [21], Reference [22] also considered the maximization of static voltage stability margin, established a three-dimensional static reactive power optimization model and solved it by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). However, the power output of DG varies with time, so it is more practical to consider dynamic reactive power optimization. Reference [23] established a dynamic reactive power optimization model for the distribution networks and solved it using an improved particle swarm algorithm, which was accompanied by excessive iterations and premature convergence. Aiming at the problem that single-objective reactive power optimization can only provide a single optimization scheme, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to achieve a comprehensive and adaptive three-objective optimization of distribution networks with the DG. In addition, it can provide a variety of control strategies to achieve dynamic optimization.\nThe contributions are highlighted as follows:\n\u2022 A new optimization method (called ISAMOPSO) is proposed based on the MOPSO. \u2022 The proposed ISAMOPSO\u2019s performance is evaluated by testing the selected benchmark\nfunctions. \u2022 The active power loss, voltage deviation, and reactive power compensation cost are\ntaken as the optimization objectives, and the multi-objective reactive power optimization mathematical model of the distribution network of a distributed generation is established. \u2022 The new proposed ISAMOPSO approach is applied to solve the reactive power optimization in the distribution networks with DG.\nThe remaining paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the model description of the distribution networks with DG. Section 3 proposes the ISAMOPSO and tests its validation and performance. Section 4 presents two case simulations on the IEEE-33 node system with DG to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ISAMOPSO. Section 5 presents the conclusions.\n2. Multi-Objective Reactive Power Optimization Model 2.1. Objective Function\nThe three most important objective functions in a power system are selected as the objective functions for reactive power optimization, which are active power loss, voltage deviation, and reactive power compensation cost.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1275 3 of 21\n2.1.1. Active Power Loss\nThe expression for active power loss is as follows:\nmin fPloss = Nbra\n\u2211 k=1\nGk(i,j) [ V2i + V 2 j \u2212 2ViVj cos ( \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )] (1)\nwhere fPloss is active power loss, Nbra is the total branch number, Gk(i,j) is the conductance of branch k connecting nodes i and j, voltage amplitude and voltage phase of the corresponding nodes V and \u03b8, respectively.\n2.1.2. Voltage Deviation\nThe expression for voltage deviation is as follows: min f\u2206V = NL \u2211 i=1 ( Vi\u2212V spec i \u2206Vmaxi ) \u2206Vmaxi = V max i \u2212Vmini\nVspeci = Vmaxi +V min i 2\n(2)\nwhere NL is the number of load nodes, \u2206Vmaxi is the maximum allowable voltage deviation of node i, and Vspeci is the expected voltage amplitude of node i.\n2.1.3. Reactive Power Compensation Cost\nThe expression for reactive power compensation cost is as follows:\nmin fcos t = fcos tC + fcos tDG = \u2211 s\u2208NC\nCCAPs \u2223\u2223Qqs\u2223\u2223+ SDG( r(1 + r)n\n(1 + r)n \u2212 1 C1 + C2\n) (3)\nwhere s \u2208 NC is the adjustable point of reactive power compensation equipment, Qqs and CCAPs are the actual input capacity and unit capacity investment of reactive power compensation equipment of node S, respectively. When CCAPs = 1, the total investment of reactive power compensation equipment is to minimize the investment of reactive power compensation, SDG is the capacity of distributed power, r is the discount rate, n is the service life of distributed power, C1 is the investment cost of distributed power, and C2 is the operation cost of distributed power.\n2.2.

PGi + PDGi \u2212 PLi = Vi Nb \u2211 j=1 Vj ( Gij cos \u03b4ij + Bij sin \u03b4ij ) QGi + QDGi + QCi \u2212QLi = Vi Nb\n\u2211 j=1\nVj ( Gij sin \u03b4ij \u2212 Bij cos \u03b4ij ) (4)\nwhere PG and QG are the active power and reactive power injected into the generator, PL and QL are the active power and reactive power consumed by the load, B is the admittance, G is the conductance, PG is the active output of DG, and QDG and QC are the reactive power capacity of DG and the reactive power capacity of reactive power compensation equipment.\n2.2.2.

ISAMOPSO Algorithm\nTo improve the global searching ability of PSO, the learning factor and inertia weight of PSO are improved adaptively.\n3.1. The Basic Principle of the PSO Algorithm\nThe core operation of the PSO algorithm is the nearest individual away from the particle to avoid a collision and guides particles to move toward the center of the target and group. The core principle of PSO mainly includes the update of speed and position. The update process is expressed as:\nvk+1i = \u03c9v k i + c1r1(x k pi \u2212 xki ) + c2r2(xkgi \u2212 xki ) (11)\nxk+1i = x k i + v k+1 i (12)\nwhere k is the number of iterations, i is the particle number, c1 and c2 are learning factors, and r1 and r2 are independent pseudorandom numbers, obeying uniform distribution on [0, 1]. \u03c9 is the inertia weight. vki is the search speed for a particle i at the kth iteration in the range [\u2212Vmax, Vmax]. xki is the position of a particle i at the kth iteration, and its range is [\u2212xmax, xmax]. xkpi is the optimal position searched so far by a particle i in the kth iteration. xkgi is the optimal position in the kth iteration of the entire particle swarm.\n3.2. Introducing Random Black Hole Strategy\nThe basic principle of introducing the black hole mechanism into PSO in [24] is to regard the particle population in the solution space as a planet in space, the fitness value of the particle as an attraction, and the real optimal solution as a black hole, and update the velocity and position of the particle according to the black hole mechanism. The principle is shown in Figure 1.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 24\nwhere k is the number of iterations, i is the particle number, 1c and 2c are learning\nfactors, and 1r and 2r are independent pseudorandom numbers, obeying uniform dis-\ntribution on [0,1] .  is the inertia weight. k\niv is the search speed for a particle i at the\nkth iteration in the range  max maxV V\u2212 \uff0c . k ix is the position of a particle i at the kth\niteration, and its range is  max maxx x\u2212 \uff0c . k pix is the optimal position searched so far by\na particle i in the kth iteration. k\ngix is the optimal position in the kth iteration of the\nentire particle swarm.\n3.2. Introducing Random Black Hole Strategy\nThe basic principle of introducing the black hole mechanism into PSO in [24] is to\nregard the particle population in the solution space as a planet in space, the fitness value\nof the particle as an attraction, and the real optimal solution as a black hole, and update\nthe velocity and position of the particle according to the black hole mechanism. The prin-\nciple is shown in Figure 1.\nDuring the iteration process, for each dimension d of each particle, a black hole is\nrandomly generated in the region with the dimension gdp corresponding to the global\noptimal solution as the center and r is the radius. A constant threshold p is set as the\nability of black to capture the corresponding dimension idx of the particle threshold\n[0,1]p . Set a random number [0,1]l for idx . If the random number l p , idx\nis captured by a black hole; if the random number l p , after introducing the random black hole strategy, the particle update formula is:\n( )3\n,\n2 0.5 ,\nid id\nid\ngd\nx v l p x\np r r l p\n+  = \n+ \u2212  (13)\nwhere 3r , l and p are random numbers with uniform distribution on [0,1]. l is the\nprobability of a particle idx appearing on its corresponding dimension, r is the radius\nof the black hole.\n3.3. Adaptive Adjustment of Inertia Weight and Learning Factor\nThe ordinary MOPSO algorithm can easily fall into the local optimum. By changing\nthe values of  , 1c and 2c in the iterative process of the algorithm, it can effectively\navoid the premature end of the iterative process without finding the optimal solution. The\ncalculation method is:\n( ) max40 0= 1 2\nt\nT r\n  + \u2212 (14)\n.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1275 5 of 21\nDuring the iteration process, for each dimension d of each particle, a black hole is randomly generated in the region with the dimension pgd corresponding to the global optimal solution as the center and r is the radius. A constant threshold p is set as the ability of black to capture the corresponding dimension xid of the particle threshold p \u2208 [0, 1]. Set a random number l \u2208 [0, 1] for xid. If the random number l \u2264 p, xid is captured by a black hole; if the random number l > p, after introducing the random black hole strategy, the particle update formula is:\nxid = {\nxid + vid, l > p pgd + 2r(r3 \u2212 0.5), l \u2264 p\n(13)\nwhere r3, l and p are random numbers with uniform distribution on [0,1]. l is the probability of a particle xid appearing on its corresponding dimension, r is the radius of the black hole.\n3.3. Adaptive Adjustment of Inertia Weight and Learning Factor\nThe ordinary MOPSO algorithm can easily fall into the local optimum. By changing the values of \u03c9, c1 and c2 in the iterative process of the algorithm, it can effectively avoid the premature end of the iterative process without finding the optimal solution. The calculation method is:\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 + r4 2 (1\u2212\u03c90) t Tmax (14)c1 = 2 cos 2 [ \u03c0t 2Tmax ] c2 = 2 cos2 [ \u03c0(Tmax\u2212t)\n2Tmax ] (15) where \u03c90 takes the constant on [0, 0.5], r4 takes the random number on [0, 1] which obeys uniform distribution, and Tmax is the maximum iteration number. Additionally, t is the current iteration number.\n3.4. The Diverse Selection of Leader Particles\nThe swarm induction strategy is introduced into PSO, and a disturbance is imposed on the population to increase the diversity of swarms. These disturbed particles as leading particles may lead the population to jump out of the local optimum to enhance its development ability. The individuals in the new sensing population are compared with the non-dominated individuals of the current generation, and the high-quality particles are selected for the next generation of particle swarm, and the formula is:\nXtur = Xnew + \u03b2Vmax \u00b7 sign(2(rand(1, N)\u2212 0.5)) (16)\nwhere Xtur is the particle position of the new sensing population, Xnew is the particle position of the next generation population, \u03b2 is the disturbance amplitude obeying uniform distribution [0, 1], Vmax is the maximum flight velocity of the particle, and the size of the perceived group is N. The particle with the largest fitness value was selected as the lead particle to guide the evolution of the next generation of the population. When a leading particle is selected, all particles in the non-dominant solution set are dynamically calculated according to the equations, which are expressed as: f itness = 1M \u2211 i=1 wi fi wi = \u03bbi M\n\u2211 i=1 \u03bbi\n, \u03bbi \u2208 (0, 1) (17)\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1275 6 of 21\nThe number of objective functions is M, and the value of the ith objective function is fi, and the \u03bbi obeys the uniformly distributed random number [0, 1].\n3.5. Cyclic Elimination Strategy of Crowding Distance\nBefore sorting the crowding distance, the Rt population is sorted non-inferiorly and divided into different dominating levels. By calculating the crowding distance instead of one-time deletion, the crowding distance is gradually deleted from small to large using the idea of a dynamic cycle. The schematic diagram of the operation process is shown in Figure 2.

Operation diagram of crowding distance ranking strategy.\ntR is divided into different classes according to the dominance relationship, where the 1F class is the highest, and the class decreases in the following order. If the number of members of 1F is less than N , then all the members of 1F are selected for the population Pt+1, and the remaining members are selected from 2F , 3F ... until the size of N . The number of members in 3F is greater than the number of remaining members in 1tP+ , so we need to perform crowding distance sorting at the same level of 3F and select the number of members into 1tP+ . The crowded distance ranking is used to calculate the density of other solutions around a solution, which is calculated as shown in (18).\n( )( 1). 1 .\n1 max. min.\nm m M\ni f i f i\nm m m\nP P P\nf f + \u2212\n=\n\u2212 =\n\u2212 (18)\nOnly one solution is deleted at each time, and the upper limit of deletion is determined immediately after deletion until the scale of +1tP is N . deleteN is the number of eliminations, which is expressed as:\n1 2 k=delete N NN N N+ + + \u2212 (19)\nwhere kN is the number of k-level non-inferior solutions, N is the size of the population +1tP , and the sum of the current number of k-level non-inferior solutions is just greater than N to achieve the elimination condition.\n3.6. ISAMOPSO Algorithm Performance Verification and Analysis The ISAMOPSO algorithm is used for the complex problem which is non-linear, multivariable, and under multi-constraint conditions. Therefore, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by a comprehensive evaluation index that reflects the convergence and distribution uniformity of the algorithm, including the Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) and the Hypervolume (HV).\nIGD is expressed as:\n( ) * * *, x P d x P IGD n \u2208= \n(20)\nwhere P is the real Pareto optimal solution set, *P is the non-dominated solution set solved by the algorithm, ( )*,d x P represents the minimum Euclidean distance between\nFigure 2. peration diagra of cro ding distance ranking strategy.\nRt is divided into different classes according to the do inance relationship, here the F1 class is the highest, and the class decreases in the following order. If the number of members of F1 is less than N, then all the members of F1 are selected for the population Pt+1, and the remaining members are s lected fro F2, F3... until the size of N. The number of members in F3 is greater than the number of remaining members in Pt+1, so we need to perform crowding distance sorting at the same level of F3 and select the number of members into Pt+1. The crowded distance ranking is used to calculate the density of other solutions around a solution, which is calculated as shown in (18).\nPi = M\n\u2211 m=1\nP(i+1)\u00b7 fm \u2212 P(i\u22121)\u00b7 fm fmax\u00b7m \u2212 fmin\u00b7m\n(18)\nOnly one solution is deleted at each time, and the upper limit of deletion is determined immediately after deletion until the scale of Pt+1 is N. Ndelete is the number of eliminations, which is expressed as:\nNdelete = N1 + N2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Nk \u2212 N (19)\nwhere Nk is the number of k-level non-inferior solutions, N is the size of the population Pt+1, and the sum of the current number of k-level non-inferior solutions is just greater than N to achieve the elimination condition.\n3.6. ISAMOPSO Algorithm Performance Verification and Analysis\nThe ISAMOPSO algorithm is used for the complex problem which is non-linear, multivariable, and under multi-constraint conditions. Therefore, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by a comprehensive evaluation index that reflects the convergence and distribution uniformity of the algorithm, including the Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) and the Hypervolume (HV).\nIGD is expressed as:\nIGD = \u2211 x\u2217\u2208P\u2217 d(x\u2217, P)\nn (20)\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1275 7 of 21\nwhere P is the real Pareto optimal solution set, P\u2217 is the non-dominated solution set solved by the algorithm, d(x\u2217, P) represents the minimum Euclidean distance between the solution on the Pareto optimal surface and the individual in the non-dominated solution set solved by the algorithm, and n is the cardinal number of P\u2217. The smaller the IGD value, the closer the non-dominated solution set is to the actual Pareto optimal solution set.\nHV is expressed as: HV = \u03bb \u222a|S|i=1 vi (21)\nwhere \u03bb represents the Lebeg measure, vi represents the hypervolume composed of reference points and non-dominated individuals, and S represents the non-dominated solution set. The larger the HV value, the stronger the dominance of a single solution, and the closer it is to the Pareto boundary. During the experiment, the performance of ISAMOPSO is compared with those of NSGA-II [25], MOPSO [26], and speed-constrained multi-objective particle swarm optimization (SMPSO) [27]; the swarm size is set to 100; the Maximum iteration is set to 10,000; and DTLZ1-DTLZ7 as test functions are run independently 30 times on the algorithm. The IGD performance index values and the mean values and standard deviations are listed in Table 1. It can be found that the mean value of IGD calculated by the ISAMOPSO algorithm is the smallest compared with the result of the other algorithm in the test functions DTLZ1, DTLZ2, DTLZ5, and DTLZ6, and the mean value of IGD calculated by the ISAMOPSO algorithm is slightly worse than that of SMPSO in the test function DTLZ3, and test functions, DTLZ4 and DTLZ7 are slightly worse than that of NSGAII. To more intuitively show the convergence and distribution of the optimal solution set obtained by various algorithms. The result with the best IGD value is selected to show the comparison between the approximate Pareto optimal frontier obtained by the four algorithms on all test functions and the real Pareto optimal front, as shown in Table 2. The results show that the non-dominated solution obtained by the ISAMOPSO algorithm is closer to the real Pareto optimal solution set than that obtained by other algorithms.\nThe HV performance index values and the mean values and standard deviations are listed in Table 3. The HV means calculated by the ISAMOPSO algorithm on the test function DTLZ1-DTLZ7 are greater than or approximately equal to the HV mean calculated by other algorithms, indicating that the dominant nature of the ISAMOPSO algorithm is stronger than that of its three algorithms, while the individual dominance of NSGA-II is stronger than the dominance of each individual obtained by the other two algorithms. Moreover, the Pareto optimal solution set obtained by the ISAMOPSO algorithm is closer to the real Pareto optimal front, indicating that the convergence and diversity of ISAMOPSO algorithm are better.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1275 8 of 21\nTable 2.

Influence of Distributed Generation on Distribution Network After the DGs are connected, the whole distribution network becomes a complex structure of multiple power sources, which is not only used to transmit power but also can generate power. The random power emitted by DG will cause the change in power flow, and some DGs with larger capacity will even cause the voltage instability at each node of the grid and the increase in network loss, which is closely related to the connection location and capacity of DGs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the location and capacity of DGs connected to the distribution network.\n4.1.1.

Meanwhile, the voltage increases significantly and even exceeds the limit value when the DG is incorporated into the 15th, 18th, 31st, and 33rd nodes, which are far away from the power supply side. The higher the DG capacity, the higher the node voltage of the system, as can be seen in Figure 4e,f,l,m. From Table 4, the network loss decreases with the increase in the capacity of the DG. The capacity of the DG should be between 20% and 40% of the total load. If the DG is incorporated near the power supply side, the capacity of the DG should be selected at 20% of the total load to reduce system power loss. Otherwise, the capacity should be 40% of the total load to increase the power flow transmission capacity and minimize the network loss so that the voltage distribution is more stable.\n4.1.2. Influence of Distributed Generation Position on Distribution Network\nUsing the control variables method, when the capacity of the DG is certain, the location of the DG in the IEEE-33 node distribution system should be changed to study the influence of the node voltage distribution. To improve the experimental reliability and summarize the general rule, six groups of independent experiments with different capacities were set up. The capacities of DG were 20%, 40%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% of the total load.

Meanwhile, the voltage increases significantly and even exceeds the limit value when the DG is incorporated into the 15th, 18th, 31st, and 33rd nodes, which are far away from the power supply side.

From Table 4, the network loss decreases with the increase in the capacity of the DG. The capacity of the DG should be between 20% and 40% of the total load. If the DG is incorporated near the power supply side, the capacity of the DG should be selected at 20% of the total load to reduce system power loss. Otherwise, the capacity should be 40% of the total load to increase the power flow transmission capacity and minimize the network loss so that the voltage distribution is more stable.\n4.1.2. Influence of Distributed Generation Position on Distribution Network Using the control variables method, when the capacity of the DG is certain, the location of the DG in the IEEE-33 node distribution system should be changed to study the influence of the node voltage distribution. To improve the experimental reliability and summarize the general rule, six groups of independent experiments with different capacities were set up. The capacities of DG were 20%, 40%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% of the total load. The voltage amplitudes of 14 nodes in each group of experiments are shown in the following (Figure 5):\n(a) (b)\n(c)\n(d)\nSymmetry 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 24\n(e) (f)\nFigure 5.

When the DG is incorporated\ninto the 15th and 18th nodes, the voltage amplitude of 33 nodes is higher the higher the\ncapacity of DG, but when the DG is incorporated into the 28th and 31st nodes, the voltage\namplitude of 33 nodes is nearly no change. When the DG is incorporated into the 21st and\n35th nodes, only the voltage of nearby nodes is affected. The closer the access location of\nDG supply is to the end of the line and the load center, the more obvious its effect on\nvoltage lifting, so it should be chosen to merge into the middle and rear sections of the\nmainline. From the above experiments, it is most appropriate to select the 12th, 15th, and\n18th nodes for the integration point, and the capacity of DG should be between 20% and\n40% of the system load.\n4.2.

Analysis and Discussion Results\nAccording to the conclusions on the influence of DG capacity and location in the IEEE-33 node distribution system, the DG is, respectively, incorporated into the 15th node and 31st node. It is assumed that each DG can output active power or compensate for the reactive power of the distribution network.

Conclusions\nTo solve the reactive power compensation problem of distribution networks with DG for economical operation, reduction in network loss, and reduction in voltage deviation, this study investigates the optimal size and siting of DG, establishes a multi-objective optimization model for optimal regulation in the distribution system, and uses the ISAMOPSO\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1275 20 of 21\nalgorithm as an optimization tool. The algorithm is compared with other algorithms and successfully applied to the IEEE-33 node system. In the static reactive power optimization experiment, the network loss decreases by 11.4%, the voltage deviation decreases by 18.7%, and the compensation cost decreases by 6.75% in the solution set obtained by the ISAMOPSO algorithm compared to the solution set obtained by the NSGA-II algorithm with the minimum Euclidean distance. In the dynamic reactive power optimization experiment, the multi-objective reactive power optimization strategy proposed in this paper takes into account the security and stability of the distribution network operation and the absorption capacity of DG. After optimization by the ISAMOPSO algorithm, the DG consumption rate reached 0.8383, the network loss for the whole day decreased by 21.08% compared with that before optimization and the voltage deviation for the whole day reduced by 4.18% compared with that before optimization. Thus, the ISAMOPSO algorithm proposed in this paper has good computational capability for solving non-convex, multi-objective, multiconstrained high-dimensional non-linear reactive power optimization problems in power systems, and can provide a set of Pareto-optimal solution sets as optimization schemes, each of which can optimize the operational performance of the system and provide a flexible reactive power optimization scheme for decision-makers.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S., H.Z., Q.Y. and Q.Z.; methodology, J.S.; software, Y.Z.; validation, J.S., C.L. and Q.M.; formal analysis, Q.M., Y.F. and Q.Y.; investigation, C.L.; resources, Q.Y.; data curation, Q.M., C.L. and Q.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.S.; visualization, Q.M., C.L.; supervision, J.S.; project administration, J.S.; funding acquisition, J.S.
