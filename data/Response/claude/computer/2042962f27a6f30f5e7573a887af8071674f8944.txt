 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on neural program repair:

1. Explore techniques to better capture long-range dependencies in code. The paper extracts short contexts around the buggy line, but capturing longer-range semantic relationships could help generate more correct patches. Methods like attention mechanisms or memory networks could be promising.

2. Investigate transfer learning across programming languages. The techniques are largely language-agnostic, so applying transfer learning from Java to other languages like Python could improve performance with less training data.

3. Develop more sophisticated training objectives beyond cross-entropy loss. Adding auxiliary losses that encourage semantic consistency or code functionality may produce higher quality patches.

4. Design better evaluation metrics beyond exact match. Metrics like BLEU from machine translation that compare semantic similarity could provide more nuanced assessment of patch quality.

5. Extend the techniques to handle multi-line bugs. The paper focuses on single-line patches, but applying the slicing and filtering ideas to multi-line bugs is an important challenge. Data augmentation could help obtain training data.
