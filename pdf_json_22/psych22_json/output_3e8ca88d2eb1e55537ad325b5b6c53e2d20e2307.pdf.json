We aimed to explore the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on psychological stress and quality of life in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: From September 2018 to November 2018, 20 communities (461 participants in total) were randomly assigned in an intervention or control group following a two-level cluster random design. The intervention group underwent CBT for 2 months, whereas the control group received routine follow-up. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD7), and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scales, respectively. Comparisons between the two groups were conducted using independent samples t-tests, and differences between the two groups before and after treatment were analyzed using paired samples t-tests. Results: There were a total of 454 participants in the final analysis. After 2 months of CBT intervention, the CBT group had a GAD-7 score that was 1.72 lower than the control group (1.47\u20131.99, p < 0.001), a PHQ-9 score of the CBT group that was 2.05 lower than that of the control group (1.74\u20132.37, p < 0.001). The CBT group had a total SF-36 score that was 10.7 lower than that of the control group (95% CI: 7.9\u201313.5, p < 0.001). In patients with different degrees of anxiety and depression, only those in the intervention group who had mild and moderate anxiety and depression symptoms showed a significant reduction in anxiety and depression scores following the intervention. Conclusions: CBT can relieve anxiety, and depression symptoms and increase the quality of life in subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis.

BMC Public Health (2022) 22:2160 Background Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and is a widespread and fatal chronic infectious disease. It is spread by droplets from the throat and lungs of acutely infected people. At present, approximately one-third of the global population has previously been infected with Mtb. Mtb carriers may remain infectious for life, although there is only a 10 to 20% probability that an individual transition from the incubation period to the active period [1]. Nevertheless, the incidence of tuberculosis is ranked at first position among all infectious diseases in the world and is one of the top ten causes of death [2]. In 2018, there were 866,000 pulmonary tuberculosis patients in China, which accounted for 1/11 of global pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 15,700 of these patients died of the disease. Tuberculosis remains a major public health problem globally [2]. 14,725 active pulmonary tuberculosis patients were registered in Xuzhou from 2016 to 2020. Because patients with pulmonary tuberculosis require a minimum of 6 months of regular treatment, psychological problems occur frequently [2, 3]. Anxiety and depression are two common psychological symptoms experienced by patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [4, 5]. Pulmonary tuberculosis patients who experience anxiety or depression have decreased treatment efficacy, physical skills, and reduced quality of life [6\u20138]. Psychological interventions can improve treatment compliance, quality of life, and treatment efficacy by reducing the psychological pressure on patients with tuberculosis [9, 10]. However, current existing treatment strategies for tuberculosis patients are more focused on chemotherapy treatments of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and disregard psychological treatments [6]. Cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) has been recommended as the preferred non-drug therapy for anxiety and depression in adults [11] and has been implemented successfully for the psychological treatment of chronic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [12], asthma [13], and diabetes [14]. CBT was a short-term psychotherapy method, which mainly removed bad cognition by changing the patient\u2019s thinking, belief and behavior, so as to eliminate negative emotions and behaviors. The use and impact of CBT has been steadily expanding since the advent of this method in the 1950s. The central premise of this therapeutic approach, pioneered by Baker [15] and Ellis [16], was that people\u2019s cognitions had a controlling influence on emotions and behaviors, and that the behaviors strongly influenced thought patterns and emotions. CBT was a problem-oriented therapy, usually in a short-term form. Treatment for less complex depression and anxiety disorders usually lasted 5\u201320 times. The duration of each treatment was 45\u201350 minutes. However, if there were concurrent symptoms or if the patient had symptoms of long-term treatment or refusal to treatment, more than 20 treatments may be required. At present, CBT has been widely used in the treatment of depression or anxiety disorder in clinical practice, and were effective. However, there have not yet been any reports on the use of CBT to treat psychological disorders in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The directly observed treatment and short-course chemotherapy (DOTS) strategy recommended by the World Health Organization [17] required community-based general practitioners to supervise the daily medication administration of tuberculosis patients. If general practitioners can learn and deliver CBT combined with DOTS, it will help to reduce the incidence of psychological disorders and improve the quality of life of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. In our randomized controlled trial, CBT was delivered by general practitioners to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis for 8 weeks to explore the effectiveness of CBT for treating psychological disorders and improving the quality of life in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.",

The intervention group underwent CBT for 2 months, whereas the control group received routine follow-up. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD7), and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scales, respectively. Comparisons between the two groups were conducted using independent samples t-tests, and differences between the two groups before and after treatment were analyzed using paired samples t-tests.\nResults: There were a total of 454 participants in the final analysis. After 2 months of CBT intervention, the CBT group had a GAD-7 score that was 1.72 lower than the control group (1.47\u20131.99, p < 0.001), a PHQ-9 score of the CBT group that was 2.05 lower than that of the control group (1.74\u20132.37, p < 0.001). The CBT group had a total SF-36 score that was 10.7 lower than that of the control group (95% CI: 7.9\u201313.5, p < 0.001). In patients with different degrees of anxiety and depression, only those in the intervention group who had mild and moderate anxiety and depression symptoms showed a significant reduction in anxiety and depression scores following the intervention.\nConclusions: CBT can relieve anxiety, and depression symptoms and increase the quality of life in subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis.\nTrials registration: ChiCTR-TRC-12001958 Date of Registration: 22/02/2012.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and is a widespread and fatal chronic infectious disease. It is spread by droplets from the throat and lungs of acutely infected people. At present, approximately one-third of the global population has previously been infected with Mtb. Mtb carriers may remain infectious for life, although there is only a 10 to 20% probability that an individual transition from the incubation period to the active period [1]. Nevertheless, the incidence of tuberculosis is ranked at first position among all infectious diseases in the world and is one of the top ten causes of death [2]. In 2018, there were 866,000 pulmonary tuberculosis patients in China, which accounted for 1/11 of global pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 15,700 of these patients died of the disease. Tuberculosis remains a major public health problem globally [2]. 14,725 active pulmonary tuberculosis patients were registered in Xuzhou from 2016 to 2020. Because patients with pulmonary tuberculosis require a minimum of 6 months of regular treatment, psychological problems occur frequently [2, 3]. Anxiety and depression are two common psychological symptoms experienced by patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [4, 5]. Pulmonary tuberculosis patients who experience anxiety or depression have decreased treatment efficacy, physical skills, and reduced quality of life [6\u20138].\nPsychological interventions can improve treatment compliance, quality of life, and treatment efficacy by reducing the psychological pressure on patients with tuberculosis [9, 10]. However, current existing treatment strategies for tuberculosis patients are more focused on chemotherapy treatments of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and disregard psychological treatments [6]. Cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) has been recommended as the preferred non-drug therapy for anxiety and depression in adults [11] and has been implemented successfully for the psychological treatment of chronic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [12], asthma [13], and diabetes [14].\nCBT was a short-term psychotherapy method, which mainly removed bad cognition by changing the patient\u2019s thinking, belief and behavior, so as to eliminate negative emotions and behaviors. The use and impact of CBT has been steadily expanding since the advent of this method in the 1950s. The central premise of this therapeutic approach, pioneered by Baker [15] and Ellis [16], was that people\u2019s cognitions had a controlling influence on emotions and behaviors, and that the behaviors strongly\ninfluenced thought patterns and emotions. CBT was a problem-oriented therapy, usually in a short-term form. Treatment for less complex depression and anxiety disorders usually lasted 5\u201320 times. The duration of each treatment was 45\u201350 minutes. However, if there were concurrent symptoms or if the patient had symptoms of long-term treatment or refusal to treatment, more than 20 treatments may be required. At present, CBT has been widely used in the treatment of depression or anxiety disorder in clinical practice, and were effective.\nHowever, there have not yet been any reports on the use of CBT to treat psychological disorders in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The directly observed treatment and short-course chemotherapy (DOTS) strategy recommended by the World Health Organization [17] required community-based general practitioners to supervise the daily medication administration of tuberculosis patients. If general practitioners can learn and deliver CBT combined with DOTS, it will help to reduce the incidence of psychological disorders and improve the quality of life of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. In our randomized controlled trial, CBT was delivered by general practitioners to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis for 8 weeks to explore the effectiveness of CBT for treating psychological disorders and improving the quality of life in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis."

Communities were selected using a random sequence, based on a prevalence of depression and anxiety in tuberculosis patients of 46.3 and 47.2%, respectively [11]. To ensure sufficient sample size, we calculated that with a prevalence of depression in patients with tuberculosis of 45%, each community would have at least 45 patients. Taking into account exclusions based on eligibility, we estimated that each community would have at least 50 patients. The study ran from September 2018 to November 2019. In August 2018, 183 pulmonary tuberculosis patients who required treatment for at least 4 months were recruited for the baseline assessment, and we found that 85 patients (44 in the intervention group and 41 in the control group) had anxiety or depression. From September 2018 to August 2019, newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were receiving treatment were assessed within 3 days of receiving a report from\nKeywords: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Pulmonary tuberculosis, Anxiety, Depression, Quality of life\ncommunity general practitioners. After patients received 2 months of CBT intervention, post-intervention assessments were performed within 5 days. All assessments took place at community health service stations and participants received a gift after each research. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines were followed by this study [18]."

In lesson 4, general practitioners learned how to conduct interviews and listen to pulmonary tuberculosis patients with enthusiasm and patience. This involved understanding and patiently answering questions raised by patients to convince them that all questions related to pulmonary tuberculosis can be answered effectively. Lesson 5 included evaluating the degree of each patient\u2019s anxiety and depression, determining the causes, identifying the methods to solve problems, selecting a method to practice according to the patient\u2019s situation, and evaluating the effect. Lesson 6 involved learning how to improve the poor habits and behaviors of patients and understanding the importance of a balanced diet, exercise, quitting smoking, and restricting alcohol. Learning 5A (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange) intervention to quit smoking [22]. Lesson 7 introduced pranayama, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation. Lesson 8 reviewed the course content and ways to teach patients how to record practice situations. It also included psychological preparation for persistent symptoms and how to deal with relapses.

It comprised seven items, with a total score ranging from 0 to 21 points, where a higher score indicates greater symptom severity. A score of 0 to 4 points indicates no anxiety, 5 to 9 points indicates mild anxiety, 10 to 14 points indicates moderate anxiety and 15 to 21 points indicates severe anxiety. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the GAD-7 was 0.84 [25].\nThe PHQ-9 [26] was used to screen for depression and assess symptom severity. The form comprised nine items, with a total score ranging from 0 to 27 points. A higher score was indicative of greater symptom severity. A score of 0 to 4 points indicated no depression, 5 to 9 points indicated mild depression, 10 to 14 points indicated moderate depression, 15 to 19 points indicated heavy depression, and 20 to 27 points indicated severe depression. The PHQ-9 has been used previously for the evaluation of depression in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Cronbach\u2019s alphas for the PHQ-9 was 0.82 [27].\nThe secondary outcome was quality of life at baseline and 2 months, which was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) [28]. The scale included eight dimensions: physiological function, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function, role-emotional, and mental health. A higher score reflected the better quality of life. The scale has been shown to have high reliability and validity for measuring the quality of life of pulmonary\ntuberculosis patients [28].

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that general practitioners can be trained to effectively deliver CBT for individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis. Results showed that CBT significantly\nreduced GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores and increased SF-36 scores in patients at 2 months, which was not observed in those who received usual care. Our study showed that CBT can alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms and improve the quality of life of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.\nCBT is an evidence-based intervention for the treatment of mental illness that includes psychological education, coping skills, cognitive reconstruction, catharsis, and homework exercises [32]. The intervention reshapes an individual\u2019s long-term distorted thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. Thus, the therapy has been recommended as the preferred non-drug therapy in the treatment of mental illness [33] and has been implemented widely for the treatment of mental illnesses combined with physical diseases [12, 14, 34]. On this basis, CBT is expected to be effective for the treatment of anxiety and depression as the two most common psychological problems in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [4, 5]; this was confirmed by our study. Although we used the same anxiety and depression assessment scales as previous studies, the level of improvement differed. Sun H [34] find improvement in anxiety was observed in patients treated with CBT relative to controls without CBT, but depression and quality of life improvement were not observed. One\nreason may be related to differences in comorbid basic diseases. An alternative reason may be related to the intensity of the intervention. Because the DOTS strategy used for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires general practitioners to interact with patients daily to ensure medication compliance, we required general practitioners to complete CBT within 1 month and provide further therapy to strengthen in the second month. While not excluding general practitioners face patients to take medication every day, patients ask questions and general practitioners give answers to the patients. Therefore, the intensity of our intervention was greater than that of other studies.\nWe found different degrees of anxiety and depression across patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, and improvements in anxiety and depression varied following CBT. Only pulmonary tuberculosis patients with mild and moderate anxiety and depression showed reduced symptoms following CBT; CBT had no effect on patients with severe levels of anxiety and depression. About onethird of depressed patients are reported to be ineffective to conventional antidepressant treatment, psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, called refractory depression [35]. Results indicated that patients with severe anxiety and depression require specialist intervention or supplementary medication. Therefore, we recommend that pulmonary tuberculosis patients who also experience severe anxiety or depression be promptly referred to a psychiatric department of a specialist or general hospital for treatment.\nQuality of life is a comprehensive reflection of a person\u2019s health, psychological status, independence level, social relations, personal beliefs, and other indicators. Anxiety and depression are the main risk factors for the poor quality of life in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [6]. Therefore, psychological interventions that can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression are likely to improve the quality of life of patients [36]. This is consistent with the results of our study. Because of the infectiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis, patients often feel ashamed or are unwilling to interact with society [37]. CBT can reduce the negative emotions of patients, which is equivalent to providing patients with social support. Some evidence indicates social support is also associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and improvements in effect [38]. Relaxation training can improve certain aspects of a patient\u2019s personality, enhance positive qualities, and adjust poor habits and attitudes [39], which in turn, will reduce anxiety and depression symptoms and improve quality of life [40].\nThis study has several shortcomings. A subjective scale was used for the assessment of anxiety and\ndepression, which may have an impact on the results. Furthermore, this study was not a second-level community randomized controlled trial, because there were fewer patients in the same time period from each community and individual intervention was used, rather than group intervention. To prevent contamination.\n\"we chose the same management approach for all patients across all communities. In theory, the effect of the individual intervention should be superior to the group intervention. However, because of the limited observation time, we did not compare the effects of pulmonary tuberculosis patients between intervention groups and control groups. Nevertheless, the negative event results suggested that the effects of the intervention group were better than that of the control group.\nThis study showed that CBT is effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. CBT can encourage patients to face the disease, return to society, and improve their quality of life. Because of the high prevalence of anxiety and depression in pulmonary tuberculosis patients, alongside the ease of use of the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, we recommend general practitioners to screen patients with pulmonary tuberculosis for anxiety and depression and promote the use of CBT as an intervention.\nAcknowledgements We thank Sarina Iwabuchi, PhD, from Liwen Bianji (Edanz) (www. liwen bianji. cn), for editing the English text of a draft of this manuscript.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions Conception and design of the study: XZ, ZD,PL.
