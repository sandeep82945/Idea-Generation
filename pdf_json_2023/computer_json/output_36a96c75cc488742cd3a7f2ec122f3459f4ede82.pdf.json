    "abstractText": "Abstract: We investigate the effects of different stochastic noises on the dynamics of the edge-localised modes (ELMs) in magnetically confined fusion plasmas by using a time-dependent PDF method, path-dependent information geometry (information rate, information length), and entropy-related measures (entropy production, mutual information). The oscillation quenching occurs due to either stochastic particle or magnetic perturbations, although particle perturbation is more effective in this amplitude diminishment compared with magnetic perturbations. On the other hand, magnetic perturbations are more effective at altering the oscillation period; the stochastic noise acts to increase the frequency of explosive oscillations (large ELMs) while decreasing the frequency of more regular oscillations (small ELMs). These stochastic noises significantly reduce power and energy losses caused by ELMs and play a key role in reproducing the observed experimental scaling relation of the ELM power loss with the input power. Furthermore, the maximum power loss is closely linked to the maximum entropy production rate, involving irreversible energy dissipation in nonequilibrium. Notably, over one ELM cycle, the information rate appears to keep almost a constant value, indicative of a geodesic. The information rate is also shown to be useful for characterising the statistical properties of ELMs, such as distinguishing between explosive and regular oscillations and the regulation between the pressure gradient and magnetic fluctuations.",

            "text": "Stochastic noises have interesting effects on nonlinear dynamical systems, including the change in stability, noise-induced stochastic resonance [1\u20134], pattern formation [5], and noise-delayed extinction [6]. In particular, their dual role of stabilising an unstable equilibrium point and destabilising a stable equilibrium point can be seemingly counter-intuitive. Furthermore, given the ubiquity of oscillations in diverse fields (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, fluid/plasmas systems, ecological systems, population dynamics, environment dynamics, etc.), the so-called oscillation quenching receives considerable attention, whereby oscillations are suppressed through oscillation death or amplitude death [4,5,7,8]. In the context of a coupled dynamical system, it can be caused by a subtle change in the coupling, such as time-delay, a parameter mismatch, etc. [9,10]. Some oscillations occurring in nature or a laboratory can be quite explosive, with the potential to cause undesirable damage to a system. An important example is quasi-periodic, limit-cycle oscillations in magnetically confined plasmas [11], such as edge-localised modes (ELMs) [12\u201321] and sawtooth oscillations [11]. Specifically, ELMs occur due to instabilities of pressure/current gradient at edge plasmas for a sufficiently high input power in the high-confinement mode (H-mode) regime (see, e.g., [22\u201325] and references therein) and take the form of sudden, quasi-periodic oscillations/bursts or more regular oscillations. The former, bursty, large-amplitude (Type I) ELMs can damage the fusion device walls, and thus\nEntropy 2023, 25, 664. https://doi.org/10.3390/e25040664 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nhave stimulated various research efforts to suppress or mitigate such ELMs. The two main mechanisms invoke the injection of particle or magnetic field perturbations externally (e.g., resonant magnetic perturbations or a pellet injection in DIII-D, JET, ASDEX-U, EAST, KSTAR tokamaks [16,17,20]). In particular, the effect of magnetic perturbation requires attention even at a very small kinetic level [26,27]. Some of the interesting experimental observations are that the ELM suppression and mitigation depend on electron pedestal collisionality, density, edge safety factor, plasma boundary shape, as well as the characteristics of the magnetic perturbation, such as the amplitude, toroidal and poloidal mode numbers, and the amplitude/frequency of (particle) pallets [18,19]. For resonant magnetic perturbations, a stochastic layer can form on the edge, promoting rapid radial transport. However, the direct impact of stochastic magnetic fields on ELM suppression/mitigation is not well understood, given its difficulty in experimental measurements. It is thus worth studying the effect of stochastic magnetic perturbation on ELMs in simple models to gain a key understanding. The main focus of this paper is to provide detailed study of the effects of stochastic particles and magnetic perturbations on ELMs. In our previous work [28], we proposed a stochastic ELM model based on a minimal deterministic ODE model of ELM dynamics in [12], which evolves the pressure gradient, magnetic fluctuation amplitude together with the ion radial-force balance relation where the electric fields are driven by the pressure gradient and the poloidal velocity. By varying the strength of the stochastic particle perturbation for a fixed small stochastic magnetic perturbation, we demonstrated their nontrivial effects on ELM dynamics, e.g., in altering the amplitude and period of oscillations. In this paper, we extend the analysis in [28] and perform a systematic study by varying the strength of both stochastic external particle and magnetic perturbations to elucidate their effects on the characteristics of ELM oscillations and associated power/energy loss. We will explore a smaller value of the stochastic noise than previously considered in [28] and also scan over different strengths of these stochastic noises. In particular, we aim to address the following main questions:\n\u2022 How are ELMs affected by stochastic particle and magnetic perturbation? \u2022 Which noise is more effective in reducing the maximum power loss due to ELMs? \u2022 How far from equilibrium is the system driven due to ELMs in the presence of the stochastic noises? \u2022 How are power loss and energy loss due to ELMs affected by the stochastic noises and input power? \u2022 How are power loss and energy loss due to ELMs captured by different statistical measures? \u2022 What are robust diagnostics to identify explosive versus regular small ELMs?\nIn order to answer these questions, we calculate time-dependent probability density, power loss, information geometry diagnostics [29,30], and entropy-related measures [31] for different cases. Specifically, our path-dependent information geometry [25,28,32,33] allows us to quantify the changes in time-dependent PDFs along the evolution path. The entropy production rate, which measures the rate of irreversible energy dissipation in a nonequilibrium system [32,34\u201336], will be explored for possible links between the maximum power loss, entropy production, and information geometric diagnostics. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. We present our stochastic ELM model in Section 2 and a brief recap of our information geometry diagnostics and other entropy diagnostics in Section 3 to make the paper self-contained. Sections 4 and 5 provide our numerical methods and results, respectively. We conclude in Section 6. Appendix A presents the results that are not included in the main text of the paper."

Figure 1 shows the time-evolution of x = P and y = \u221a EM in Equations (1)\u2013(3) in the absence of noise \u03be = \u03b7 = 0. It can easily be seen that the period of ELMs becomes smaller for larger \u03a6. For the smallest \u03a6/d = 0.6, x (in red) slowly rises before suddenly collapsing back to a small value. This is triggered by the onset of the burst (spike) of y (in blue) due to the instability of the L-mode solution (x < 1, y = 0). Between the bursts, y spends a long time around the unstable L-mode solution (x < 1, y = 0). We also see that the oscillations for larger \u03a6/d become more regular/sinusoidal and more symmetric.

Each plot contains results for different values of Qx [Qy] = 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 in red, 10\u22125 in blue, 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 in green, 10\u22124 in black, 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 in sky-blue, and 10\u22123 in magenta, for fixed Qy [Qx] = 10\u22125.\nOverall, for all values of Qx, Qy, the increase in the standard deviation over time is observed due to phase-mixing, while the amplitude of quasi-periodic oscillations gradually decreases over time. This oscillation quenching occurs more rapidly for larger values of Qx or Qy, and is more pronounced in the evolution of \u3008y\u3009 than that of \u3008x\u3009, probably because the instability (of y) is more susceptible to stochastic noises. Further, compared with Qy, Qx is more effective at quenching oscillation amplitude. For \u03a6/d = 0.6, in comparison with Figure 1, the uncertainty induced by the stochastic noise (Qx, Qy 6= 0) inhibits y from becoming smaller than a certain value depending on Qx and Qy. As a result, oscillations become less explosive, as can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. On the other hand, the period of oscillation tends to become smaller for larger values of Qx or Qy. A close comparison of the cases with varying Qx and Qy for \u03a6/d = 0.6 reveals that such shortening of the period is more pronounced for increasing Qy for fixed Qx (Figure 4) compared with the case of increasing Qx for fixed Qy (Figure 3). A similar trend persists for \u03a6/d = 0.8 (see Figures A1 and A2), although the period of oscillation is shortened to a lesser degree in comparison to the case of \u03a6/d = 0.6. This, together with the observation made above, indicates that Qx induces a more severe amplitude quenching while Qy is more effective at shortening the oscillation period, respectively.\nIn contrast, for \u03a6/d = 1.2 in Figures 5 and 6, Qx and Qy now act in such a way to increase the period rather than decrease it. (A similar tendency can be seen for \u03a6/d = 1.0 in Figures A3 and A4.) This is due to the main difference in oscillation characteristics for \u03a6/d = 0.6 and 1.2. Specifically, for \u03a6/d = 0.6, the oscillations occur less frequently and are explosive, and stochastic noise can turn such rare, explosive oscillations (large ELMs) into more frequent small events (small ELMs). On the other hand, for \u03a6/d = 1.2, oscillations are more regular, being more similar to linear oscillations where a stochastic noise can reduce the oscillation frequency through damping."

            "text": "We observed that in the long time limit, PL \u2192 \u03a6 in all cases. Thus, the normalised power loss PL = PL/\u03a6 in Equation (32) gives us a useful measure for comparing different cases of \u03a6. The normalised power loss PL is shown in Figure 7 for different cases. The upper [lower] panel shows the results for different values of Qx [Qy] = 3\u00d7 10\u22126 in red, 10\u22125 in blue, 3\u00d7 10\u22125 in green, 10\u22124 in black, 3\u00d7 10\u22124 in sky-blue, and 10\u22123 in magenta for Qy [Qx] = 10\u22125, respectively, so using the same colour scheme as before.\nOverall, the smaller \u03a6/d is, the larger the excursion of the normalised power from unity, with larger maxima and smaller minima, similar to what was observed in the deterministic case in Figure 2. This manifests a more explosive nature of the oscillations for smaller \u03a6. Compared with the deterministic case, the stochastic noise reduces the peak power loss, PmL = max(PL), yielding a smaller P m L for larger Qx and Qy. Other notable main effects of stochastic noise Qx and Qy seen in Figures 2 and 7 are as follows. First, as time increases, the peak value and oscillation amplitude of PL decrease, similar to what was observed in the mean values (Figures 3\u20136). Second, for a given \u03a6, the peak value PL monotonically decreases as either Qx or Qy increases. A more significant reduction in the maximum power loss is observed as Qx increases for a fixed Qy (the upper row in Figure 7), compared with the other case of increasing Qy for fixed Qx (the lower row in Figure 7). For instance, for \u03a6/d = 0.6, the values of the second peaks (just beyond t = 20) in power loss in Figure 7 are\nPmL = (4.11, 3.82, 3.28, 2.46, 1.77, 1.30) as Qx varies, PmL = (4.04, 3.82, 3.72, 3.38, 2.81, 1.98) as Qy varies. (33)\nThird, the effects of stochastic noise, noted above, tend to be more pronounced for smaller \u03a6. This means that the stochastic noises tend to be very effective in quickly suppressing the large power loss associated with large ELMs (\u03a6/d = 0.6). Finally, Qx and Qy shorten [lengthen] the period of the PL oscillations in the case of small \u03a6/d = 0.6, 0.8 [large \u03a6/d = 1.0, 1.2]. Fourth, the time averages of the normalised PmL take values ranging from 1.05 for \u03a6/d = 0.6 to 1.02 for \u03a6/d = 1.2, with some differences at the level of a few per cent. This suggests that the input power \u03a6 is a reasonable estimate of the time average of PL. However, as noted above, very large fluctuations in PL about the average values (see Figure 7) occur for more explosive cases (\u03a6/d = 0.6), leading to increased power loss due to ELMs.\nTo demonstrate how Qx and Qy reduce the energy loss WELM caused by such ELMs, we approximate WELM by the time-integral of the power loss that is larger than the input power \u03a6 as\nWELM/\u03a6 \u223c (\u2206t)(P m L \u2212 1)/2, (34)\nwhere \u2206t is the duration of the ELM, approximated by the distance between the times where PL = 1. The factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that the peak has a roughly triangular shape going up and down, so estimating WELM/\u03a6 as the area of the rectangle (\u2206t)(P m L \u2212 1) would clearly be an over-estimate. For instance, we again consider the second oscillation peaks in power loss for the case \u03a6/d = 0.6 in Figure 7, and extract that:\n\u2206t = (5.65, 5.93, 6.59, 8.03, 9.66, 11.31) as Qx varies,\n\u2206t = (5.72, 5.93, 5.96, 6.10, 6.51, 7.53) as Qy varies. (35)\nUsing Equations (33) and (35) in Equation (34) then yields:\nFinally, we check on the experimental observation that the power loss due to ELMs remains a constant fraction of the input power, WELM \u00b7 fELM = {0.3\u2212 0.4} \u00d7 \u03a6, where fELM is the frequency of ELMs [18,19]. To this end, we focus on the red curves in Figure 7, having Qx = 3\u00d7 10\u22126, Qy = 10\u22125 in the top row and Qx = 10\u22125, Qy = 3\u00d7 10\u22126 in the bottom row. We use the second oscillations in each case to extract PmL and \u2206t, which then allows us to calculate WELM/\u03a6. The next few oscillations give us the period TELM, so then fELM = 1/TELM gives us the final ingredient to compute the desired quantity (WELM/\u03a6) fELM. The first four rows in Table 1 use data from the top row of Figure 7, so Qx = 3\u00d7 10\u22126, Qy = 10\u22125. The next four rows use data from the bottom row of Figure 7, so Qx = 10\u22125, Qy = 3 \u00d7 10\u22126. The final four rows use data from Figure 2, so the deterministic system with Qx = Qy = 0. We can see that even quite small amounts of noise reduce the power loss, especially at the smaller \u03a6/d values where we obtain giant ELMs. For larger noise levels, the reduction in WELM and, thus, also the power loss becomes even greater, as seen previously in Figure 8. However, despite such dependence of WELM/\u03a6 on Qx, Qy, and \u03a6, the power loss due to ELMs (WELM/\u03a6) fELM in the last column in Table 1 is within the range of 0.33\u20130.39,\nwell consistent with the experimental observation 0.3\u20130.4 [18,19] noted above. In contrast, for a deterministic system (shown in Figure 2), this is no longer the case since (WELM/\u03a6) fELM = 0.33\u20130.75, taking the value 0.75 for the large ELM \u03a6/d = 0.6. These results thus suggest that the presence of stochastic noise is essential for reproducing the experimental results."

Figures 9 and 10 show the time traces of \u0393x, Lx, \u0393y, and Ly for different cases of parameter scanning for \u03a6/d = 0.6, while Figures 11 and 12 are for \u03a6/d = 1.2 (See Figures A5\u2013A8 for \u03a6/d = 0.8, 1.0.) In all cases, it is clearly seen that the larger Qx or Qy, the smaller \u0393x, \u0393y, Lx, and Ly. This is because larger stochastic noise makes the number of statistically distinguishable states smaller. Comparing the upper and lower panels in all cases, Qx seems to cause more decrease in Lx and Ly compared with Qy due to Qx\u2019s stronger oscillation quenching. Although the fine features of \u0393x and \u0393y are a bit different (e.g., with different oscillation periods), the overall evolution of Lx and Ly is remarkably similar, suggesting that x and y undergo similar changes in statistical states despite their different evolutions. To further quantify this correlation, Figures 13 and 14 plot the information phase-portrait, which plots \u0393y against \u0393x. The diagonal line \u0393x = \u0393y is overplotted as the black solid line. The oscillation around \u0393x = \u0393y reveals a regulatory interaction between x and y as a result of overshooting (due to inertial) and restoring forces (due to interaction). Recall that when \u0393x and \u0393y cross each other, the time scales of x and y match with a perfect balance. Such regulatory behaviour is most prominent in the case of \u03a6/d = 1.2 in Figure 14; the large deviation from \u0393x = \u0393y in Figure 13 is due to explosive oscillation (intermittency) as well as initial transients. Finally, the larger Qx and Qy are, the less prominent the crossing between \u0393x and \u0393y due to loss of phase information (See Figures A9 and A10 for \u03a6/d = 0.8, 1.0.)"

That is, for a smaller value of Qx, S\u0307Tx becomes larger while S\u0307Tx changes much less, and vice versus. Mathematically, this appears because S\u0307Tx has Qx in its denominator while S\u0307Ty has Qy in its denominator; QxS\u0307Tx would be less subject to change when Qx changes. (If x were an independent Gaussian variable, \u03932x = QxS\u0307Tx/\u03c32x + S\u03072x). Further, it is useful to note that this different behaviour of S\u0307Tx [S\u0307Ty] upon the change in Qx [Qy] sharply contrasts with the similar behaviour of \u0393x and \u0393y in Figures 13 and 14.

One key difference between these measures was noted that \u0393x is reduced somewhat similarly as either Qx or Qy increases, while STx is more severely reduced by Qx than Qy. In this section, we examine the statistical measure of the total system by calculating the information rate \u0393 from joint PDFs (see Equation (17)) and the total entropy production rates S\u0307T = S\u0307Tx + S\u0307Ty (see Equation (23)) and compare them with the power loss in Section 5.3. The results are shown in Figures 17 and 18, respectively, for those cases corresponding to Figure 7. Notably, Figure 17 exhibits a stair-case-like evolution in time where each large power loss during one ELM oscillation is associated with a region of an almost constant \u0393, the value of \u0393 suddenly decreases from one oscillation to another. If this constant \u0393 is to be interpreted as a geodesic [32], which was advocated as a signature of self-organisation, ELMs in the presence of stochastic noises can be viewed to occur by jumping from one self-organised state to another.\nOn the other hand, the overall behaviour of the total entropy production rate S\u0307T in Figure 18 is seen to be well-correlated with that of the power loss in Figure 7, with the maxima of S\u0307T and PL occurring at similar times, although in some cases, especially for Qy < Qx, S\u0307T shows double peaks in the early evolution."

            "text": "We conducted a detailed investigation into the effects of various stochastic noises on the statistical properties of ELMs using a time-dependent PDF method and path-dependent information geometry (information rate, information length). Overall, the amplitude of oscillation is diminished over time through the phase-mixing of different trajectories due to either stochastic particle or magnetic perturbations. However, particle perturbation is more effective in this amplitude diminishment compared with magnetic perturbations. In regards to the effects on oscillation frequency, the stochastic noise acts to increase the frequency of more explosive oscillations (large ELMs), while it decreases the frequency of more sinusoidal regular oscillations (small ELMs). In both cases, magnetic perturbations are more effective at altering the oscillation period. We provided a detailed study of how power loss is affected in different cases. Most of all, a dramatic decrease in power loss for explosive ELMs (small \u03a6) was observed as Qx and Qy increase, with a more significant effect of Qx. The peak power loss and the energy loss due to ELMs were estimated for different \u03a6, Qx, and Qy, revealing the important effect of stochastic noises on reducing such losses. However, despite the reduction in WELM/\u03a6 by Qx and Qy and their dependence on \u03a6, the power loss due to ELMs (WELM/\u03a6) fELM (in Table 1) for all cases gives 0.33\u20130.37, consistent with the experimental observation [18,19].\nIn contrast, for a deterministic system, a deviation from this relation was found for large ELMs. These highlight the importance of a stochastic ELM model for reproducing the experimental results. Furthermore, the power loss was shown to be strongly correlated with the total entropy production, indicating that the maximum power loss involves a large, irreversible energy dissipation in non-equilibrium. Despite such a strongly non-equilibrium evolution, each ELM oscillation seems to occur in a state where the information rate \u0393 (calculated from a join PDF) is almost constant, suggesting a geodesic-like behaviour (see [32] and references therein) over one ELM cycle. Envisioning the latter to be a signature of self-organisation \u0393 [32], the time evolution of ELMs in the presence of stochastic noises is proposed to consist of a sequence of sudden transitions between the different self-organised states. Another utility of the information geometry in capturing the ELM dynamics is further discussed. Specifically, a strong coupling between x and y in more regular oscillation is captured by a similar evolution of Lx and Ly, despite the differences in the details of the time-evolutions of the two variables [33]. Furthermore, the information phase-portrait (\u0393x versus \u0393y) shows that a strong coupling between x and y can be measured by the oscillation of \u0393x and \u0393y around \u0393x = \u0393y, suggesting the time competition in statistical space. It was also suggested that the correlation is better measured by these information geometric measures than the entropy production rates S\u0307Tx and S\u0307Ty that are affected differently by stochastic noise. It will be of interest to further extend our analysis to other nonlinear oscillators, including more than one oscillator, to quantify the correlation among different oscillators or emergent phenomena, such as synchronisation. This will require solving the Fokker\u2013Planck equation in higher dimensions, which will be computationally challenging, or further developing stochastic simulation methods for an accurate calculation of information geometry diagnostics [40]. Finally, it would be interesting to investigate more general ELM models.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.-j.K.; Methodology, R.H. and E.-j.K.; Software, R.H.; Formal analysis, R.H. and E.-j.K.; Investigation, R.H. and E.-j.K.; Writing\u2014original draft, R.H. and E.-j.K.
