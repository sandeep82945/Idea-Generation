The COVID-19 pandemic has brought tremendous disruption to various aspects of daily life, especially for parents of young children, ages 3\u20135, who face isolation, disconnection, and unprecedented changes to how they engage and socialize.

Yet, little research has investigated the effects of brain healthy parental practices of kindness with pre-school aged children. The current study examines whether an interactive, parent\u2013child kindness curriculum can serve as a potentiator for brain health as measured by resilience and child empathy levels. During a peak of the pandemic, mother participants between the ages of 26\u201346 (n = 38, completion rate 75%) completed questionnaires on parental resilience levels and parent-reported child empathic pro-social behaviors before and after engaging in a 4 weeks online, self-paced, kindness curriculum. Half of the group received additional brain health education explaining the principles of neuroplasticity, empathy, perspective taking, and resiliency. Mothers in both groups showed increased resilience ( p < 0.001) and reported higher levels of empathic behavior in their child ( p < 0.001) after completing the curriculum. There was no significant difference between groups. Comparison of mean resilience levels during COVID-19 to pre-pandemic general means indicated that mothers are reporting significantly lower levels of resilience as well as decreased empathetic behaviors in their children. These results support the notion that kindness is a powerful brain health booster that can increase resilience and empathy.

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic permeates family functioning and wellbeing, potentially leading to a significant negative impact on parents and their young children. Parents are facing imminent threats to their relationships, social support networks, and educational access for their children, leading to overwhelming feelings of worry, stress, and anxiety (Prime et\u00a0 al., 2020). Specifically, the parent\u2013child relationship is of utmost concern. Recent studies suggest that parents experiencing pandemicrelated fears may have difficulty managing negative emotions, which in turn, affects daily life, family discord, and ultimately, the parent\u2013child relationship (Daks et\u00a0 al., 2020; Di Crosta et\u00a0 al., 2020; Prikhidko et\u00a0 al., 2020; Saladino et\u00a0 al., 2020). As such, parenting young children can be\u00a0 challenging in and of itself, and now parents must combat additional stressors (i.e., financial, childcare, and health) due to the pandemic.\nStudies indicate that, during crises, resilience (i.e., an individual\u2019s ability to positively adapt in the face of adversity; Herrman et\u00a0 al., 2011) reported by women with children is considerably lower than during non-crises times and that stress levels are reported to be\u00a0exacerbated (Avery et\u00a0al., 2021; Taylor et\u00a0 al., 2021). A recent study investigating the relationship of social stressors and parent\u2013child engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic, found that mothers and fathers who reported more social stressors were less engaged with their children and their children exhibited more behavior problems compared to before the pandemic (He et\u00a0al., 2021). Fortunately, it has been shown that when parents maintain positive, responsive styles of caregiving, they can prevent and even reverse toxic levels of stress in the home caused by adversity (Blair and Raver, 2016). Stern and Cassidy (2018) found that the parent\u2013 child bond can be\u00a0 strengthened through an acknowledgment of empathic pro-social behaviors such as care and concern for others, which involves the capacity to comprehend the minds of others, to feel emotions outside one\u2019s own, and to respond with kindness to others\u2019 suffering.\nFurthermore, resilience research indicates that factors such as engaging in acts of kindness, developing trusting relationships, and responding compassionately to the feelings of others can help lay new neural pathways and improve quality of life (Haslip et\u00a0 al., 2019). Kindness, defined as actions intended to benefit others (Curry et\u00a0al., 2018) and considered as a pro-social relational construct, supports an intra and interpersonal focus on how one treats others, takes care of oneself, and interacts with the world around them. As such, parent-driven kindness interventions may prove fruitful in promoting resilience, as parents have the influence and opportunity to become the first teachers and models for acts of kindness with their children.\nThe global pandemic has put a spotlight on brain health and the great need for resources, education, and training. Brain health is defined as a state of performing at your personal best and thriving in your life context\u2014not simply the absence of disease. The term brain health as described by Chapman et\u00a0al. (2021) holistically encompasses the brain\u2019s functions which includes aspects of cognition (ex: problem solving, innovation, processing speed, and memory), daily\nlife (ex: responsibilities, sleep, nutrition, and exercise), wellbeing (ex: resilience, quality of life, and mood), social interaction (ex: empathy, kindness, and social support), and neural components (ex: brain blood flow and connectivity). In contrast, mental health is a term that more narrowly focuses on psychological and emotional wellbeing. Recent work has highlighted how the different components of brain health influence each other and by strengthening skills in one area, may also compensate for areas of weakness. A case study showed that after completing an online cognitive intervention, some of the outcomes were that the participant felt more satisfied with her social networks and saw improvement in measures of wellbeing, which included increased resilience and decreased stress (Chapman et\u00a0 al., 2021). Following this line of thinking, the current study seeks to understand how a kindness intervention may improve resilience.\nWith social distancing and stay-at-home mandates in effect, digital tools that are easily accessible and cost effective offer a solution to help families navigate the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies have demonstrated the value of digital interventions in allowing various populations, including families, to access evidence-based guidance on demand and through a modality (web-based) that they are already comfortable using to seek mental, behavioral, and brain health guidance (Lund et\u00a0 al., 2018; Caulfield and George, 2020; O\u2019Dell et\u00a0 al., 2021). Supplementary to intervention, other tools such as self-paced, at-home brain science education, could offer additional insight for parents seeking to better understand their own brain health. Yet, currently, there is limited data on the effects of brain science education on the resilience levels of parents with young children amid a pandemic. This study seeks to understand if an online kindness training may increase resilience in parents with preschool-aged children, promote empathic pro-social behavior in their children, and parents find the kindness activities relevant."

The aim of this study is to understand if practicing the pro-social skills of kindness may (1) affect resilience in parents and (2) affect empathic pro-social behavior in preschool-aged children.\nThe hypothesis for this study was that (1) parents who engage with Kind Minds with Moozie will increase resilience and observe increased empathic pro-social behaviors in their child, (2) additional brain science education for the parents would contribute to greater gains in resilience, and (3) parents would find kindness activities relevant during interactions with their preschool-aged children.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 805748"

Moozie, an ambassador of kindness, is presented as a lovable, gentle, digital cow to whom children can easily relate and from whom they learn valuable, lifelong lessons. The instructional design of the Moozie Teaches Kindness curriculum was developed to meet National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) standards for\nSocial\u2013Emotional and Cognitive Development with the target age group being 3 to 7 (NAEYC, 2019).\nResearchers selected and adapted the Moozie Teaches Kindness curriculum for this study based on its applicability to parents of preschool-aged children and focus on pro-social behaviors using the four kindness pillars that are paramount to brain health: Kindness to Others, Kindness to Self, Kindness to Animals, and Kindness to Earth. Each kindness pillar teaches parents how they can contribute to the development of empathic pro-social behavior of their child through parent-led activities which promote recognizing and naming feelings of self and others, sharing, taking turns, helping others, saying kind words, interacting with pets and/or outdoor animals, and being kind to nature in positive (recycling and conserving) and negative ways (littering and wasting)."

The scale has been developed and tested as a measure of the degree of resilience and has promise as a method to screen people for high, intermediate, or low resilience. The total score can range from 0 to 100 and the higher the score obtained, the greater the participants resilience. Each parent rated their own stress coping ability on a 5-point scale (0\u20134), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience in areas such as an individual\u2019s ability to adapt when changes occur, staying focused and thinking clearly when under pressure, and bouncing back after injury, illness, or hardship. The CD-RISC measure of resilience normative data indicates that the US general population median score is 82, with the first quartile (Q1: 0\u201373) describing the score range for the lowest group (lowest\n25% of the population), i.e., the least resilient, the second (Q2: 74\u201382) and third (Q3: 83\u201390) the intermediate scores, and the fourth (Q4: 91\u2013100) describing the highest or most resilient, i.e., above 75% of the population. This measure is found to have a very good internal consistency as measured by Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 (\u03b1 = 0.93).\nEmpathic pro-social behavior was measured using a National Institute of Health (NIH) Toolbox Empathic Behaviors Survey CAT Ages 3\u201313 v2.0 (EBS), a parent-report measure for children ages 3 through 12 that assesses parent perceptions of children\u2019s pro-social behaviors using a 10-item fixed length form. The EBS is a specific test within the NIH Toolbox\u2014 Emotion\u2014Social Relationships\u2014Positive Social Development (Salsman et\u00a0al., 2013). This parental proxy scale was developed to assess early behavioral indicators of positive social development (i.e., empathic pro-social behaviors). Each item administered has a 5-point scale with options ranging from never to always. An example of a parent\u2019s perception of the child\u2019s empathic pro-social behavior would be\u00a0 \u201cIn the past month, please decide: How often your child offers to help other children who are having difficulty.\u201d Higher scores are indicative of more parent reported child pro-social behaviors, with a normative mean T-score of 50. This measure is found to have a very good internal consistency as measured by Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 (\u03b1 = 0.90).\nRelevancy of the program was measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree) that parents completed after each of the online kindness modules. These five, three-question surveys asked parents to reflect and rate their experience in terms of content comprehension, relevance to parenting style, and likelihood of implementing the kindness practice into daily life (Table\u00a04). This relevancy survey was developed by the Kind Minds researchers to examine the saliency of this training for parents. Examples of the relevance questions include \u201cI understand how being kind to others plays a role in having a kind mind\u201d (comprehension), \u201cI find the concept of compassion relevant to my parenting style\u201d (relevance), and \u201cI will practice modeling and expressing empathy with my child\u201d (likelihood)."

One aim of this study was to integrate easy-tofollow brain science education with kindness activities delivered digitally. We\u00a0 hypothesized that parents who engaged with the online kindness activities with their preschool-aged children would boost parental levels of resilience and parent reported child empathic pro-social behavior levels. Results showed a whole group increase in resilience levels of mothers and mother-reported empathic pro-social behaviors in their children. This study supports the notion that practicing kindness can be\u00a0 a useful tool to help mothers become more resilient. The ability to overcome difficulties and cope with\nstress is critical, especially during a global pandemic. As such, changes in resilience, a personality trait aimed at complying with environmental changes and stress, may be\u00a0 a beneficial factor to consider (Block and Block, 1980). There is a need for additional research and salient early interventions for parents, including both mothers and fathers, as resilience can be\u00a0 a potentiator for improved mental, physical, and brain health.\nGiven that the baseline resilience levels of mothers in this study fell within the bottom 25% of the population (m = 69), there was opportunity for growth and intervention. One possible explanation is that the pandemic contributed to feelings of worry and fear, which may then affect mothers\u2019 resilience levels. Similar to the findings of our study, Mariani Wigley et\u00a0 al. (2020) used the same measure of resilience and investigated the support role of parents during the COVID-19 emergency. Results showed that parents were also found to have a low parental resilience score (m = 63.78) when their children were on average 8\u00a0 years of age. Compared to the mothers of preschoolers in this study, who reported higher resilience levels before and after the kindness training (m = 69, m = 75.9), our results suggest that maternal resilience levels may fluctuate not only due to environmental stressors, but also depending on child age. Therefore, implementing a kindness training during the earlier years of childhood may serve as a buffer against declining parental ability to adapt and bounce back in the face of stressful situations.\nPrior to receiving this online kindness training, mothers in both the kindness only and kindness with brain science conditions reported child empathic pro-social behaviors at levels lower than expected norms (T < 50). Upon completion of the online kindness modules, a significant increase in whole group child empathic pro-social behaviors was reported (m = 48.30), although the scores increased, they were still slightly below\nTABLE\u00a05 | Connor-Davidson resilience scale and NIH toolbox empathic behaviors survey means.\nM SE n\nCD-Risc Kindness Only T1\n69.59 11.34 17\nCD-Risc Kindness Only T2\n75.24 11.52 17\nCD-Risc Kindness with Brain Science T1\n69.67 8.00 21\nCD-Risc Kindness with Brain Science T2\n76.57 10.86 21\nEBS Kindness Only T1\n43.44 8.56 17\nEBS Kindness Only T2\n49.82 8.57 17\nEBS Kindness with Brain Science T1\n42.45 10.13 21\nEBS Kindness with Brain Science T2\n47.06 12.88 21\nA table of descriptive statistics displays the averages of participant scores in both conditions, kindness only and kindness with brain science, at T1 and T2.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 805748\nthe norm. One potential factor for consideration is that these low scores may be\u00a0due to the isolating nature of the COVID-19 pandemic as children might be\u00a0 restricted from engaging in social\u2013emotional learning activities outside of the home or have limited social engagement with peers in order for natural development of pro-social behavior through activities involving same-aged play, peer modeling, and social communication.\nRegarding differences between the kindness only and the kindness with brain science conditions, the authors hypothesized that both groups would demonstrate gains in resilience and parent reported empathic pro-social behavior and that the participants in the kindness with brain science condition would show greater increases in parental resilience. Analysis revealed both groups did increase in resilience and parent reported empathic pro-social\nbehavior in their children; however, there was no significant difference between groups. One potential reason for this finding may be\u00a0 that the measures were not well suited to capture the impact of the brain education provided. We\u00a0 did not include application questions for the brain science information provided. Research has shown that synthesis (gist reasoning) is an important process to abstract meaning from complex information and that gist reasoning can predict performance in daily function (Vas et\u00a0 al., 2015). Providing information alone may not have been enough to create measurable changes in resilience. Future studies should investigate the possibility of making the brain science educational aspect more thorough, with specific and direct applications. Mothers reported high relevancy upon completion of the online kindness modules. Study participants reported they found Kind Minds with Moozie to be\u00a0 comprehensible, relevant, and practical. Additionally, on average, parents in the kindness only condition spent 29.25 min and parents in the kindness with brain science condition took slightly longer at 33.14 min to complete the entire course over the course of 4 weeks. Given that the additional brain science education should have only resulted in a brief increase in the amount of time taken to complete each module, this small difference is expected. Nonetheless, with the time-consuming demands placed on parents during the pandemic, it is promising that this brief, online kindness training can be\u00a0completed in less than 1\u00a0h. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that mothers value practicing and instilling pro-social skills such as being kind to others, yourself, animals, and nature in their children and that kindness activities, which foster parent\u2013child interaction, are well received."

While a control group which would receive materials after the post-intervention measurement of resilience and empathic pro-social behaviors could have provided additional insights into the effectiveness of the online kindness training, the research team prioritized delivering the training in a timely manner due to the pandemic. This online kindness training was relevant for mothers considering the myriad of stresses and demands brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The digital design of the study was an efficient method for researchers to provide study activities to participants during a period of physical and social distancing, although participant feedback on the accessibility and ease of use of the technology was not collected. Additionally, the participant feedback surveys gathered insight regarding the comprehension, relevancy, and practicality of the kindness activities in daily life; however, the feedback did not address parent engagement levels or frequency of practicing the kindness activities with their children. These aspects could be\u00a0 assessed in future studies to gain additional information which would be\u00a0 useful for the implementation of the program and the evaluation of its feasibility. In regard to the participants, it was a homogeneous group, as more female participants enrolled in the study, and many came from similar educational and socioeconomic levels; therefore, the data collected were limited in representation to mothers of preschool-aged children. The study design could be\u00a0 strengthened by adding a follow-up time point to assess maintenance effects of gains in parent resilience and child pro-social behavior. Further exploration of how a more structured cognitive training combined with daily habits may affect greater change in parent resilience levels may be\u00a0 of interest in a larger-scale investigation. Continued effort to expand and enroll a third control group would lend itself to a more robust analysis of the impact and effects of brain science education on resilience, empathy, and cognition. Future recruitment processes should include a more focused diversification so that multiple demographics and both maternal and paternal figures are represented. Overall, study findings serve as a model for leveraging a neuroscience-based online kindness curriculum to empower parents with strategies to combat stress exacerbated by these unique times. There are broader public health implications for equipping individuals with tools to take a proactive and preventative approach to brain health, thereby influencing the social, academic, and neural development of the family unit (Feldman, 2015). The chronic and cumulative effects of stress on the brain can contribute to adverse childhood experiences and have been linked to parental resilience as a mediator. Borja et\u00a0 al. (2019) suggest that the resilience of some parents can prevent the heightened exposure of their children to adversities.\nContinued studies should further investigate specific methods and protocols utilizing kindness and resilience building activities that promote parent\u2013child interaction and relational development as a foundation to creating happier and more brain healthy families."

            "heading": "CONCLUSION",
            "text": "Identifying effective ways to reduce stress and increase resilience has become a mandate for people from a myriad of life, age, professional, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and especially among parents and their young children. Kindness is a familiar construct that goes beyond educational, psycho-social, and cultural boundaries; however, many current practices do not involve a curriculum devised specifically for the implementation by parents of preschool-aged children. The developing mind is instrumental in instilling strong, neural pathways that promote resilience and empathic pro-social behavior. Kind Minds with Moozie resulted in a valuable tool to provide structured support and didactic instruction to assist parents in supporting and promoting child empathic pro-social behavior and proved to be\u00a0 useful in support interventions for families exposed to adverse events as well as public health crises. Specifically, Kind Minds with Moozie could be\u00a0 used to plan intervention for caregivers (e.g., teachers and parents) aimed at improving resources to cope with life stressors. Thus, the present results highlight the significance of designing digital therapeutic tools and kindness training designed to improve both parental and child wellbeing."
