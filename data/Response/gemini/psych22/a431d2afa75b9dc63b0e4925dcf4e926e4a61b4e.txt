1. **Investigate the role of synaptic mitochondria in the pathophysiology of MDD.** The study found that Flx treatment of CSIS rats increased the expression of proteins involved in synaptic mitochondrial bioenergetics. This suggests that synaptic mitochondria may play a role in the pathophysiology of MDD and that targeting synaptic mitochondria could be a potential therapeutic strategy for MDD.


2. **Examine the effects of Flx on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of CSIS rats.** The study found that Flx treatment of CSIS rats increased the expression of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and release. This suggests that Flx may improve synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of CSIS rats. Future studies could investigate the effects of Flx on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of CSIS rats using electrophysiological techniques.


3. **Investigate the role of Camk2 in the pathophysiology of MDD.** The study found that CSIS increased the expression of Camk2, a protein that mediates intracellular signaling cascades and contributes to synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP). This suggests that Camk2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of MDD. Future studies could investigate the role of Camk2 in the pathophysiology of MDD using animal models and postmortem brain tissue from MDD patients.


4. **Examine the effects of Flx on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the hippocampus of CSIS rats.** The study found that CSIS increased the expression of polyubiquitin, a protein that serves as a recognition signal for the proteasome. This suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. Future studies could investigate the effects of Flx on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the hippocampus of CSIS rats.


5. **Investigate the effects of Flx on neurogenesis in the hippocampus of CSIS rats.** The study found that CSIS decreased the expression of BDNF, a protein that promotes neurogenesis. This suggests that CSIS may impair neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Future studies could investigate the effects of Flx on neurogenesis in the hippocampus of CSIS rats.
