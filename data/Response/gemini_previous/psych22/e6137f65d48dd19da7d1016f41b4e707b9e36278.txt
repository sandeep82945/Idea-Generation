1. **Investigate the effects of long-term sickness absence (LTSA) in more settings.** The current study focused on a representative cohort of employees in Germany. It would be valuable to replicate this study in other countries and occupational settings to determine if the association between workplace bullying and LTSA is consistent across different contexts.


2. **Distinguish between occasional and severe bullying.** The current study found that both occasional and severe bullying were associated with an increased risk of LTSA. However, the effect of severe bullying was stronger. Future studies should investigate the different health consequences of occasional and severe bullying in more detail.


3. **Employ longer follow-up intervals.** The current study followed participants for five years. However, it is possible that the effects of workplace bullying on LTSA may take longer to emerge. Future studies should employ longer follow-up intervals to determine the long-term health consequences of workplace bullying.


4. **Examine the role of other psychosocial factors in the relationship between workplace bullying and LTSA.** The current study controlled for several potential confounders, including age, gender, occupational level, smoking status, and physical demands at work. However, other psychosocial factors, such as social support and job control, may also play a role in the relationship between workplace bullying and LTSA. Future studies should investigate the role of these factors in more detail.


5. **Investigate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce workplace bullying.** Given the potential health consequences of workplace bullying, it is important to develop and evaluate interventions to reduce workplace bullying. Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of different types of interventions, such as training programs for managers and employees, changes to organizational policies and procedures, and the provision of support services for victims of bullying.
