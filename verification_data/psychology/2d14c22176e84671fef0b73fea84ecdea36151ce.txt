Given the extensive and detailed nature of the text you've provided, which covers a wide range of topics related to natural cross-linking agents and their applications in hydrogel preparation, it's clear that the text is a comprehensive review rather than a research paper with specific future research directions explicitly stated. However, based on the context and the typical structure of such reviews, we can infer potential areas for future research that might be implied within the text. Here are some inferred future research directions based on the provided text:

1. **Exploration of New Natural Cross-Linking Agents**: "Therefore, it is worth considering the use of natural cross-linking agents such as genipin, citric acid, tannic acid, epigallocatechin gallate as well as vanillin, which produce safer hydrogels for biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic use." This suggests a direction towards identifying and testing other natural compounds that could serve as effective and safe cross-linking agents.

2. **Enhancing the Properties of Hydrogels with Natural Cross-Linkers**: The discussion on the advantages of natural cross-linkers over synthetic ones, such as lower toxicity and environmental impact, implies a need for further research to enhance the mechanical, thermal, and biological properties of hydrogels cross-linked with natural agents.

3. **Application-Specific Research**: Given the mention of biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic applications, there's an implied direction towards developing application-specific hydrogels that meet the unique requirements of these fields, such as controlled drug delivery systems, wound healing dressings, and tissue engineering scaffolds.

4. **Improving Biocompatibility and Reducing Cytotoxicity**: The emphasis on the biocompatibility and low toxicity of natural cross-linking agents suggests a future research direction focused on further reducing the cytotoxicity of hydrogel materials for safer in vivo applications.

5. **Sustainability and Environmental Impact**: The concern over global warming and the environmental impact of synthetic cross-linkers points towards research into more sustainable production processes for hydrogels, including the use of green chemistry principles and life cycle analysis.

6. **Advanced Functionalities of Hydrogels**: The mention of self-healing properties, antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity indicates a direction towards engineering multifunctional hydrogels that can offer additional benefits beyond their primary application.

7. **Clinical Translation and Regulatory Approval**: The note on FDA-approved hydrogel products hints at the importance of research focused on the clinical translation of laboratory
