    "abstractText": "Background Melatonin is an endogenous substance which plays a key role in sleep induction by reducing sleep onset latency; it has been approved by the European Food Safety Authority as a food supplement for exogenous administration. Oniria\u00ae is a food supplement formulated as 1.98 mg of prolonged-release melatonin tablets; it displays a dual dissolution profile in vitro. Objectives The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the relative oral bioavailability of Oniria\u00ae, in comparison with immediate-release tablets (IRT) with a similar melatonin content as a reference. We also attempted to characterize the circadian rhythm of endogenous melatonin. Methods We performed an open-label, cross-over, randomized, phase I clinical study with two sequences and three periods involving 14 healthy volunteers. We characterized the endogenous melatonin circadian profile (period 1) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of both Oniria\u00ae and the reference melatonin (periods 2 and 3). Results Two phases were clearly differentiated in the PK profile of Oniria\u00ae. An initial one, from dosing up to 2 h, and a delayed one from 2 to 11 h post-administration. During the initial phase, both melatonin formulations were equivalent, with a Cmax value close to 4000 pg/mL. However, in the delayed phase, Oniria\u00ae showed significantly higher melatonin concentrations than the IRT (three times higher at 4\u20136 h post-administration). Moreover, Oniria\u00ae exhibited concentrations above the endogenous melatonin peak of 80 pg/mL for up to 2.5 h versus the reference formulation, potentially suggesting an effect of Oniria\u00ae, not only in the induction of sleep, but also in the maintenance. Conclusion Oniria\u00ae could be a highly promising food supplement, not only for sleep induction but also for the maintenance of sleep. * Dolores Ochoa Mazarro mdolores.ochoa@salud.madrid.org 1 Clinical Pharmacology Department, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM), C/ Diego de Le\u00f3n, 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain 2 Plataforma SCReN (Spanish Clinical Research Network), Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Madrid, Spain 3 ITF Research Pharma S.L.U, Madrid, Spain 4 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Hep\u00e1ticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain Key Points This study provides a comparison between the pharmacokinetic profile and oral bioavailability of a melatonin prolonged-release and a melatonin immediate-release formulation. Bioequivalence of Oniria\u00ae and Melatoplus\u00ae were not demonstrated based on the differences found in pharmacokinetic measures (Cmax, AUC). Oniria\u00ae showed up to three times higher levels of plasma melatonin 4\u20136 h post-administration. The two-phase release formulation of Oniria enabled melatonin levels to be kept higher than those of peak physiologic melatonin up to 8 h after dosing. 236 M. Rom\u00e1n Martinez et al.",

            "text": "Melatonin is an endogenous lipophilic hormone principally produced by the pineal gland [1]. It regulates the circadian rhythm and its synthesis is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Melatonin physiological synthesis is suppressed by light, resulting in low hormone plasma concentrations during the day (<\u00a010\u00a0pg/mL). Maximum peak hormone plasma concentration is around 2\u20134\u00a0a.m. (60\u00a0pg/mL) [2, 3]. Melatonin therefore plays a decisive role in the physiological control of the circadian sleep\u2013wake cycle [4, 5].\nSleep interruption is known to increase with age; consequently, total sleep time and sleep efficiency undergo a consistent decrease [6]. Moreover, melatonin production diminishes with age\u2014up to 50% in the elderly, in inverse correlation with the frequency of poor sleep quality, and it has therefore been suggested that melatonin deficiency is at least partly responsible for sleeping disorders [7].\nCorrect sleep is essential for physical and mental health. It is known that poor sleep quality constitutes a risk factor in certain conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart diseases, depression [8], limited cognitive ability [9\u201311] and lower physical performance.\nEndogenous melatonin presents linear kinetics. Following exogenous oral administration of an immediate-release formulation, melatonin half-life ranges from 45 to 65 min. It is rapidly metabolized and is completely eliminated in 3\u20134\u00a0h. In general terms, with a prolonged-release form, a delay in the peak dose can occur; this ranges from 90 to 210 min, depending on the type of preparation. The half-life may be also lengthened, reaching from 3.5 to 4\u00a0h [7]. Thus, prototypical prolonged-release forms provide slower and more sustained absorption than the immediate-release ones, the peak dose is delayed and of a lesser magnitude, and levels are maintained from 8 to 10 h, a datum similar to the physiological secretion curve of endogenous melatonin. Thus, this type of prolonged-release melatonin might be mimicking the physiological melatonin secretion curve [2].\nExogenous administration of melatonin as a food supplement was assessed and approved in 2010 by the EFSA (European Food Safety Agency) for the purpose of reducing sleep onset latency, thus favoring induction of sleep [12].\nOniria\u00ae is a new melatonin product formulated as prolonged-release oral tablets. Oniria\u00ae presents a dual dissolution profile in which approximately 50% is released in the first 20 min (initial phase), and the remaining 50% is maintained for up to 5 h (slower release phase) [13]. The present study attempted to investigate the relative oral bioavailability of this new formulation compared with an immediate-release formulation with a similar melatonin content. As a secondary objective, we characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of endogenous melatonin."

The concentrations reached after either of the two forms of exogenous melatonin administration increased almost 50-fold the endogenous melatonin peak, which was close to 4000\u00a0pg/mL as shown in Fig.\u00a03, Panel A. Similarly, Panel A reveals how the pharmacokinetic exogenous melatonin profiles are similar from dosing to 2\u00a0h after administration (initial phase). Fig.\u00a03, Panel B shows\nthe different pattern of the two melatonin formulations after reaching maximum concentration, thus demonstrating that Oniria\u00ae concentration remains higher at all sampling points from 2\u00a0h following product administration (delayed/retarded phase).\nIn the delayed phase, plasma melatonin concentration 4\u20136\u00a0h post-administration exhibited a significant increase with Oniria\u00ae compared with IRT (three times higher; Fig.\u00a04). In addition, Oniria\u00ae showed concentrations still surpassing the described endogenous melatonin peak of 80\u00a0pg/mL 6\u20138.5\u00a0h post-administration (2.5\u00a0h longer than the reference formulation) (Fig.\u00a04).\nTable\u00a02 concisely characterizes the kinetic parameters for both exogenous and endogenous melatonins in the whole study group, expressed as arithmetic means (\u00b1\u00a0SD), as well as interindividual variability.

In addition, an exploratory analysis was performed in the partial areas from hour 0 to hour 2 post-administration, where the absorption process takes place; and from hour 2 to 11 post-administration, in which greater availability of Oniria\u00ae was observed. Based on a model-independent approach, this mean ratio of Oniria\u00ae over IRT was 105.59 for AUC 0\u20132\u00a0h (90% CI 90.82\u2013122.77) and 165.92 for AUC 2\u201311 h (90% CI 137.11\u2013200.78). In summary, in the initial absorption phase (up to 2 h post-administration), the bioavailability of both formulations was similar. However, the relative bioavailability for Oniria\u00ae from 2 h to 11 h after administration was higher than that of IRT.\nIn the case of tmax, the median value for melatonin was 0.50\u00a0h for Oniria\u00ae and 0.75\u00a0h for IRT (15 min), with a range of 0.25\u20131.50\u00a0h for both formulations.\nThe calculated intraindividual coefficients of variation estimated were 19.31% for AUC 0\u2013t and 34.15% for Cmax."

A clinically negligible decrease of 0.37\u00a0g/dL (0.24\u00a0g/dL in men and 0.51\u00a0g/dL in women) was observed in hemoglobin level, which can be accounted for by the sampling conducted during the study."

            "text": "This phase I clinical trial was designed as a single oral dose, open-label, cross-over, randomized study comprising two sequences and three periods to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of two exogenous oral melatonin formulations. These products consisted of prolonged-release melatonin 1.98-mg (Oniria\u00ae) and immediate-release melatonin 1.99-mg tablets. Throughout the three periods, 14 healthy volunteers were hospitalized 14 h before product administration time (10:00\u00a0a.m.) and released 11 h after the baseline. The endogenous melatonin circadian profile (period 1) and the pharmacokinetics of both melatonin formulations (periods 2 and 3) were evaluated from plasma concentrations.\nRegarding endogenous melatonin levels (subjects with an age range of 20\u201345\u00a0years and a mean age of 29\u00a0years), a mean plasma peak of 80\u00a0pg/mL was reached in the time curve (Fig.\u00a02); these data are in line with previously published studies [22].\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of Oniria\u00ae corresponded to a dual two-phase formulation with an initial phase, observed up to 2 h after administration, of rapid and intense release, followed by a slower and gradual retarded phase up to 6\u20138 h after administration. These results are consistent with the in\u00a0vitro dual dissolution profile previously demonstrated for the product [13]. Conversely, the reference product displayed an early, one-phase, shortened release, which tallies better with the behavior of a classic immediate-release formulation [7].\nIn the exploratory analysis applied to the partial areas, we observed that from time 0 to hour 2, when the absorption process takes place, the bioavailability of both formulations was similar, although tmax for Oniria\u00ae was reached 15 min faster than that of the reference melatonin formulation (0.50\u00a0h vs 0.75\u00a0h, with a range of 0.25\u20131.50\u00a0h for both formulations). In contrast, in the partial area from 2 to 11 h (delayed phase), the relative bioavailability for Oniria\u00ae was\nhigher, showing levels above the endogenous melatonin peak for 2.5 additional hours in comparison with the IR melatonin formulation. Additionally, from 4 to 6 h post-administration, Oniria\u00ae provided plasma melatonin levels that were three times higher than those produced by IRT.\nConsidering that both formulations possess a different release profile, they did not prove to be bioequivalent when administered as a single oral dose under fasting conditions. Although during the initial phase the pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with two bioequivalent products, from 2 h post-administration (delayed/retarded phase) the pharmacokinetic profile started to differentiate due to the different release patterns of both melatonin products.\nTaking into account the similar melatonin content of both formulations (1.98 vs 1.99\u00a0mg), the immediate-release phase included in the dual profile of Oniria\u00ae would justify a similar Cmax and tmax in comparison with the IRT. Moreover, the slower release during the following hours might account for the eventual increase in AUC parameters and overall greater bioavailability of Oniria\u00ae in relation to the reference melatonin (Table\u00a02). A differential influence of other physicochemical variables, such as the differences between both formulations with regard to particle size, surface area, pH effect or overall dissolution rate cannot be completely ruled out.\nIn the present study, Oniria\u00ae produced levels of melatonin much higher than those achieved by endogenous melatonin; these were maintained for approximately 8 h postadministration. In other words, this appears to indicate that Oniria\u00ae can produce melatonin levels clearly higher than the endogenous melatonin plasma peak for as many as 6\u20138.5\u00a0h after administration, thus corresponding theoretically to a regular end-of-sleep period (5\u00a0a.m.\u20137.30\u00a0a.m. in case the product is taken at 11\u00a0 p.m., for instance).

Nonetheless, assuming that plasma concentrations above the endogenous melatonin peak are effective with regard to inducing and maintaining sleep, it is hypothesized that Oniria\u00ae could be effective not only for sleep induction, but also for maintaining sleep throughout the whole sleeping cycle. It might be of interest to conduct further studies to investigate the effects of Oniria\u00ae at both the pharmacodynamic and clinical levels, including its hypnotic effect (induction and maintenance). Despite the fact that there is no clear association between aging and melatonin absorption (although a high degree of interindividual variability [12, 23, 24] has been established), it is also of great interest to evaluate melatonin bioavailability in age groups susceptible to sleep disturbances.\nThe overall safety analysis of both formulations provided comparable results, a fact that is in accordance with the literature, although no statistical analysis of safety data was performed. All adverse events were resolved by the end of the trial. We detected no clinically significant anomalies in the analytical results, except for a small decrease in the mean hemoglobin value; this has no clinical relevance and can be accounted for by the blood extractions required for the trial. These results concur with those of previous analyses, which demonstrate the absence of any serious side effects following administration of exogenous melatonin, even at doses higher than those of Oniria\u00ae and up to 20\u00a0mg [25, 26]."
