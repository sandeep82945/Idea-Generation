    "abstractText": "the range of applications of digital surface models of the bones in science and industry is wide. threedimensional reconstructions of bones are used in biomechanics, biomedical engineering, medical image processing, orthopedics, traumatology, radiology, patient education, anatomy, anthropometry, forensic anthropology, ergonomics, usability and human factors engineering, or accident and injury analysis and prevention. No open access database or repository of skeletal surface models of the full lower extremities exists. therefore, the objective of this publication was to provide access to consistent complete bone models of the pelvis and lower limbs of multiple subjects, including biometric data. Segmentations and surface models of the bones of the lower extremities of more than twenty subjects were created from open access postmortem whole-body computed tomography scans. the database provides a broad range of applications by giving access to the data of the complete process chain, from the raw medical imaging data through the segmentations to the surface models.",

The surgical guidance based on bone models can be virtual, augmented25 or mixed reality26, or 3D printed27,28. Further fields of application are anatomy and patient education29,30, morphometrics31 and anthropometry32,33, forensic anthropology34,35, ergonomics, usability and human factors engineering36, accident and injury analysis and prevention37.\nHowever, to the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, no open access database or repository of skeletal surface models of the full lower extremities exists. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide access to consistent complete bone models of the pelvis and lower limbs of multiple subjects. The database is supposed to enable other researches to quickly develop, test and verify new methods, approaches, algorithms or proofs of concept without the time-consuming and labor-intensive work of data collection and curation, segmentation and reconstruction. The database is expected to help the scientific community to facilitate research and improve the reproducibility and comparability of studies by giving access to the raw medical imaging data, including the metadata of the subjects and the segmentations and surface models of the bones. Hence, different researchers and research groups can resort to the same datasets for the validation of methods and comparison of results. Different deep learning models for artificial intelligence-based bone reconstruction, for instance, could be benchmarked by applying them to the raw computed tomography (CT) data and comparing the automatic with the manual segmentations of the database. The database can also be used as additional training data for existing deep learning models38,39.\nRWTH Aachen University, 52062, Aachen, Germany. e-mail: scientific@mcm-fischer.de\nData DeSCriptor\nopeN\n2Scientific Data | (2023) 10:763 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02669-z"

The segmentations and models of the bones of the lower extremities were created from anonymized postmortem CT scans of the whole body originally published by Kistler et al. in the Swiss Institute for Computer Assisted Surgery Medical Image Repository (smir.ch) as open access Virtual Skeleton Database (VSD)40. The CT datasets were provided by the forensic institutes of the universities of Bern and Z\u00fcrich and shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license after ethical approval of the Cantonal Ethics Committee Bern41. Further information about the datasets can be found in the literature cited40,41. Due to ongoing difficulties in accessing the SMIR website, the author decided to reupload the original datasets without any changes to the open access hosting service Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.827036442.\nCAUTION. The VSD contains a few inconsistencies, such as duplicate CT datasets. The author of this publication is not connected to the SMIR or VSD and, therefore, not responsible for errors in the VSD. However, errors that the author recognized during the work with the VSD were logged and are reported in the reupload of the VSD42.\nSubject selection. Twenty subjects (ten male and ten female) were selected from the VSD for the creation of the bone models with the objective of covering a wide age range.\nThe inclusion criteria were:\n\u2022 Availability of age, body weight and body height. \u2022 Integrity and completeness of the lower body\u2019s skeletal anatomy.\nThe exclusion criteria were:\n\u2022 Difference between the gender specified in the metadata and the biological sex visible in the CT data. \u2022 Presence of artificial joints or bone fractures.\nThe average age, weight and height of the twenty subjects were 52 \u00b1 21 years, 70 \u00b1 13 kg and 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 m, respectively. An overview of the subjects is presented in Table\u00a01. Some subjects were processed before the inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined. Ten of the subjects did not meet the criteria. These ten additional subjects are also published as part of the database since they still might be useful for some applications, but they are tagged by a comment in the database so they can be easily identified by the user (see Table\u00a01).\nreconstruction of the osseous anatomy. The bone surfaces were semi-automatically reconstructed by thresholding (Fig. 1). Two hundred Hounsfield units43 were chosen as the lower threshold and the maximum Hounsfield unit value present in the volume data was selected as the upper threshold. Subsequently, a manual post-processing using the software 3D Slicer (slicer.org) with default smoothing settings was performed44. The bones were manually segmented at the joints if necessary. All joints were segmented. However, some segments contain multiple components as follows:\n\u2022 Sacrum including the coccyx (if not fused with the sacrum) \u2022 Hip bone (also called pelvic, innominate or coxal bone) \u2022 Femur \u2022 Patella \u2022 Tibia \u2022 Fibula \u2022 Talus \u2022 Calcaneus \u2022 Tarsals, including the cuboid, navicular and three cuneiforms \u2022 Metatarsals \u2022 Phalanges\nSeparate segments were created for the left and right leg. Some segments contain small sesamoid bones if present. This applies to the metatarsals for all subjects but, in some cases, also to other bones, such as the femurs.\nAfter the segmentation, the bones were reconstructed by manually closing holes present in the outer surface. No gap closing, hole filling or wrapping algorithms were used. The reconstructed surface models were exported as mesh files in the Polygon File Format (PLY) and imported into MATLAB using a conservative decimation and remeshing procedure\u00a0(Fig. 1). The Hausdorff distance between input and output mesh was limited to 0.05 mm for the decimator. The adaptive remesher permitted a maximum deviation of 0.05 mm from the input mesh with\nFig. 1 Workflow of the creation of the lower body\u2019s bony anatomy surface models.\n3Scientific Data | (2023) 10:763 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02669-z\na minimum and maximum edge length of 0.5 and 100 mm, respectively. The decimator and remesher are plugins of the software OpenFlipper (openflipper.org)45.\nCAUTION. Each reconstruction of anatomical structures from medical images is subject to cumulative spatial errors arising from each step of the process chain. While the section \u201cTechnical Validation\u201d should give an impression of the error that can be expected from the workflow described, users of the database should take into account the risk of larger reconstruction errors depending on the application intended.\nThe bone models of each subject can be visualized by running the MATLAB or Python examples. One subject is presented in Fig.\u00a02. The 3D reconstructions were created by the author as a private side project between 2017 and 2022. Parts of the database containing fewer subjects and only the pelvis and femurs were published previously as part of other studies of the author46,47. This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\nAnalysis of the surface models stored as MAT files. The database was searched for duplicate subjects using a two-stage registration process. Each pelvis was transformed into an automatically detected pelvic coordinate system based on the anterior pelvic plane using the iterative tangential plane method46. Subsequently, the sacrum of each subject was registered to the sacra of all other subjects using a rigid iterative closest points algorithm. Lower outliers of the root mean square error between the two registered sacra were examined. One duplicate subject was identified, excluded from the database and replaced by another subject."

The CT phantom data was used to evaluate the reconstruction process described above.
