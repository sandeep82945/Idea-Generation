    "abstractText": "Background: Nivolumab improved patients\u2019 survival in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). We aimed to evaluate resting energy expenditure (REE) (i.e., patients\u2019 basal metabolism) to predict efficacy. Methods: We conducted a monocentric, observational study of mRCC patients receiving nivolumab between October 2015 and May 2020. REE was measured prior to initiating immunotherapy using indirect calorimetry to determine hypo, normo and hypermetabolism. Primary endpoint was 6-month, progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints were response rate, PFS and overall survival (OS). Results: Of the 51 consecutive patients, 15 (29%) were hypermetabolic, 24 (47%) normometabolic, and 12 (24%) hypometabolic. The 6-month PFS was 15% for hypermetabolic patients and 65% for non-hypermetabolic patients (p < 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, hypermetabolism was the only baseline factor predicting 6-month PFS (OR 9.91, 95%CI [1.62\u201360.55], p = 0.01). Disease progression was noted as the best response in 73% of hypermetabolic patients and 26% of non-hypermetabolic patients (p = 0.02). Median PFS was 2.8 and 8.7 months (p < 0.01), and median OS was 20.2 and 35.1 months (p = 0.13) in the hypermetabolic and non-hypermetabolic groups, respectively. Conclusions: Our study identifies an association between mRCC patients\u2019 energy expenditure and nivolumab efficacy. The measurement of REE by indirect calorimetry in routine practice could help identify patients at risk of nivolumab failure.

            "text": "Renal cell carcinoma is the 6th and 10th most frequent cancer in men and women, respectively [1]. The prognosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has improved during recent decades with Vascular Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). In the frontline setting, recent studies demonstrated the superiority of sunitinib over ipilimumab plus nivolumab [2], pembrolizumab\u2013axitinib [3], cabozantinib\u2013nivolumab [4] and lenvatinib\u2013pembrolizumab [5], according to the International Metastatic Consortium Database (IMDC) risk subgroups. In the second line after previous TKI treatment, nivolumab as a monotherapy is the only approved ICI [6]. Despite these recent developments, survival remains poor in mRCC, with a survival rate of 5 years at 12%, and primary or secondary resistance to ICI occurring most of the time [7]. As of today, no robust predictive factor of response to ICI exists in mRCC. For example, the PD-L1 status, which is routinely used as a tumor-related biomarker of response in non-small lung cancer (NSCLC), has been inconstantly associated with response to ICI, and is not recommended in clinical practice [8\u201310]. There is an urgent need to identify the patients who will benefit from these treatments and those who are only at risk of toxicity or disease progression. Cancer-associated weight loss results from negative energy balance, due to decreased food intake, increased resting energy expenditure (REE), or both. REE can be defined as the amount of energy that is spent in one day by a resting individual. Hypermetabolism is defined as an increase in measured REE compared to calculated REE from standard formulas [11] and can affect up to half of cancer patients [12]. It is considered as an early and major contributor to cancer cachexia and was determined as an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC patients\u2019 survival [13]. Furthermore, hypermetabolism is associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines [14], and thus could possibly modulate the response to immunotherapy. We hypothesized that increased REE would result in a reduced ability of the patient to develop an active immune response following ICI infusion. This is because T-cell activation requires metabolic changes to leave the G0 stage and enter the G1 stage of the cell cycle, which includes enhanced glycolysis and is a highly ATP-dependent process [15]. We previously demonstrated that ICI have poor efficacy in hypermetabolic NSCLC patients with a worse prognosis compared to non-hypermetabolic patients [16]. In this context, we decided to evaluate the association between metabolism and efficacy outcomes in mRCC patients treated with nivolumab."

We enrolled consecutive patients who participated in the CERTIM (Immunomodulatory Therapies Multidisciplinary Study group) multidisciplinary risk assessment program for immunotherapy in the outpatient unit of the oncology department. This program is proposed to all cancer patients before ICI initiation and aims to provide personalized, supportive and optimized care. During this program, patients benefit from a multidisciplinary evaluation, including a nutritional assessment with a dietitian consultation and indirect calorimetry. Male and female patients of at least 18 years of age with histologically proven metastatic RCC and indication of nivolumab were eligible. Patients were followed until death or last examination. Follow-up period for the current analysis ended on 2 September 2020.\nCancers 2022, 14, 3214 3 of 12\nWritten informed consent was obtained for all patients.

Before the start of the measurements, patients rested quietly for 15 min while the indirect calorimeter was calibrated and a steady state was obtained [17]. Patients were asked to remain awake for the duration of the measurement. For each patient, oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured for 15 min by indirect calorimetry using a face mask connected to an oxygen analyzer (Fitmate, COSMED, Italy). The calorimeter was calibrated before each measurement. Measured REE (mREE, kcal/d) was determined from VO2 using Weir\u2019s equation [18], and the results were immediately displayed in software attached to the system. To evaluate the extent of REE alteration compared to healthy individuals, mREE was compared to predicted REE (pREE), calculated with revised Harris and Benedict equations [19]:\nMales: pREE (kcal/d) = 66.5 + 13.75 \u00d7 weight (kg) + 500 \u00d7 height (m) \u2212 6.78 \u00d7 age\nFemales: pREE (kcal/d) = 655 + 9.56 \u00d7 weight + 185 \u00d7 height \u2212 4.68 \u00d7 age\nHypermetabolism is defined as mREE over pREE \u2265 110%, normometabolism is defined as mREE/pREE between 90 and 110%, and hypometabolism is defined as mREE/pREE < 90% [11]. In our study, hypermetabolic patients were compared to the other patients (normometabolic and hypometabolic patients). During the multidisciplinary risk assessment program, multiple clinical and biological measurements were performed. Concomitant medication that could impact the immune response was recorded [20,21]. Risk groups for survival were defined as favorable, intermediate or poor using the IMDC classification [22]. Response to treatment was evaluated by computed tomography at two to four months after treatment initiation, at the discretion of the treating oncologist. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were defined as all-grade adverse events that could be related to nivolumab, according to the oncologist. A serious adverse event was defined as an adverse event requiring treatment interruption, corticosteroid use and/or hospitalization."

            "text": "To our best knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the association of resting energy expenditure and efficacy of ICI in mRCC. We found that non-hypermetabolic patients receiving nivolumab had better outcomes than hypermetabolic patients, with a 6m PFS of 65% and 15%, respectively. The objective response rate was also two-fold higher in the nonhypermetabolic group than in the hypermetabolic group, and hypermetabolism resulted in a significantly decreased disease control rate as compared to non-hypermetabolism. This report is the first study including a measurement of REE in mRCC patients treated with ICI. The diagnosis of hypermetabolism can be obtained in routine practice in the outpatient setting using indirect calorimetry, with a result immediately available for the physician. REE reflects the total amount of energy used by an individual per day. It depends, for example, on weight, sex and age, and its value varies from one person to another. A vast array of phenomena can increase REE in cancer patients. The energetic demand of the tumor itself, changes in inflammation and body composition, will result in increased REE. It is estimated that up to half of cancer patients may be hypermetabolic [12,16,25]. We confirmed in this study the high prevalence of hypermetabolism with 29% of patients being hypermetabolic. Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome with an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment [26]. Hypermetabolism has been correlated with clinical and biological markers of cancer cachexia such as weight loss, PS \u2265 2, CRP \u2265 10 mg/L and associated with reduced survival [12,13]. Hypermetabolism is an early feature of cachexia. Therefore, indirect calorimetry should be encouraged and performed early and systematically for need and risk assessments of cancer patients, prior to initiation of cancer therapies. Nivolumab was approved for the treatment of mRCC following the pivotal CheckMate025 study [6]. Patients\u2019 characteristics in both studies are comparable, with a high proportion of males, 16% in the unfavorable IMDC risk group, and patients that received mainly one or two prior lines of treatment before nivolumab. Efficacy outcomes for the overall population of our study were similar to the nivolumab group in the CheckMate-025 study, with 45% and 40% of 6m PFS, and 33% and 25% of objective response rate, respectively. Furthermore, primary resistance to nivolumab was reported in 39% of our overall study population (73% of hypermetabolic patients and 26% of non-hypermetabolic patients), and in 35% of the nivolumab cohort of the CheckMate-025 study. Interestingly, survival surrogates were better in the non-hypermetabolic group of our study than in the nivolumab group in the CheckMate-025 study: median PFS was 8.7 months in our study group versus 4.6 months in the CheckMate-025 study; and median OS was 35 months versus 25 months. In our study, we did not find any predictive marker of nivolumab efficacy other than hypermetabolism and occurrence of TRAE. In mRCC, no easily available biomarker of response to immunotherapy has been identified, but multiple studies are currently trying to evaluate the tumor, tumor microenvironment and host-related biomarkers. Promising biomarkers related to the tumor include molecular signatures, such as in the BIONIKK trial [27]. Host-related factors offer new potential biomarkers in mRCC such as the gut microbiome [28] and systemic inflammation reflected by NLR [29,30]. Finally, the IMDC risk group has been identified as a predictive factor of response to nivolumab plus ipilimumab [2]. The predictive value of TRAE has also been studied [31,32] but it cannot help as\nCancers 2022, 14, 3214 10 of 12\na predictive marker before initiation of treatment. Interestingly, we previously reported an association between patients\u2019 hypermetabolism and acute toxicity under nivolumab [33]. The main limitations of our study are its monocentric nature and its limited sample size. In our cohort, eight patients received nivolumab as frontline treatment, which may not have a comparable efficacy as in the post TKI setting [34\u201336]. The value of hypermetabolism as a biomarker of response under TKI treatment or ICI combination with ICI or TKI is currently unknown. We decided to include all mRCC patients in our cohort, including two patients with papillary histology subtype since we believe that metabolism is a host-related, histology-independent marker. Although the efficacy of ICI in papillary renal carcinoma may differ from that of ICI in clear cell carcinoma, these two non-hypermetabolic patients had stable disease as a best response. This study also has strengths. Despite a limited number of patients, there is a strong indication that hypermetabolism should be investigated as a marker of efficacy in larger cohorts. Our population is representative of the real-life setting in mRCC, with patient characteristics and outcomes consistent with the literature and similar to that of the pivotal CheckMate-025 study [22,37]. It can be highlighted that, in our study, hypermetabolism is not only associated with a poor PFS but also with a reduced tumor response rate, suggesting a direct link between whole-body energy and the possibility of a pharmacodynamic effect of ICI. Generating an immune response is a considerable bioenergetic challenge [15]. In order to respond appropriately to the tumors, T-cells have to metabolically switch between resting and proliferative states and actively acquire metabolic substrates from their environment to meet these energy demands [38]. Since hypermetabolism indicates that increased energy is spent by the patient in resting conditions, to maintain vital homeostasis, we hypothesized that hypermetabolic patients might have less remaining energy to fuel lymphocytes, and therefore may experience less lymphocytes-mediated tumor responses [39,40]. In conclusion, indirect calorimetry allows for an easy and reproducible measure of REE, and our findings point toward its interest as a marker of efficacy for immunotherapy in mRCC patients. Future studies will need to explore this biomarker in the frontline setting in different ICI combinations and determine the efficacy of strategies to reverse patients\u2019 hypermetabolism.\nAuthor Contributions: J.N.: data curation; methodology; formal analysis; writing\u2014original draft; writing\u2014review and editing; A.J.: methodology; formal analysis; writing\u2014review and editing; J.A.
