By connecting laboratory equipment to 84 the cloud, we introduce students to experimentation in pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical 85 organoids in two different settings: Using microscopy to monitor organoid growth in an 86 introductory tissue culture course and using high density multielectrode arrays to perform 87 neuronal stimulation and recording in an advanced neuroscience mathematics course. We 88 demonstrate that this approach develops interest in stem cell and neuroscience in the students 89 of both courses. All together, we propose cloud technologies as an effective and scalable 90 approach for complex project-based university training. 91 92 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT 93 94\nThe use of stem cell-derived cortical organoid models in academia and biotechnology has 95 drastically increased in recent years. Given these trends, there is a critical need for students to 96 be trained in organoid culture, differentiation, and analysis. To date, education curricula that focus 97 on organoids are theoretical. Taking advantage of cloud technologies, such as internet-connected 98 microscopes and multielectrode arrays, we propose approaches to introduce students to cortical 99 organoids using live experiments. We show that these approaches develop interest in the field 100 and prospects in students in biology and other STEM disciplines, such as mathematics and 101 computer science. 102 103 KEYWORDS: STEM Education; Internet-of-Things; Stem Cells; Neuroscience; Organoids; Brain 104 organoids 105 106\n4\nINTRODUCTION 107 108 Pluripotent stem cell (PSCs)-derived 3D cortical organoids are transforming the study of 109 human development, disease, and evolution (Kadoshima et al., 2013; Mostajo-Radji et al., 2020; 110 Nowakowski and Salama, 2022; Paulsen et al., 2022; Pollen et al., 2019; Velasco et al., 2020). 111 Organoids model several aspects of corticogenesis, including the emergence of cell types, such 112 as neuronal progenitors, projection neurons, interneurons, astrocytes, and other glia cell types 113 (Nowakowski and Salama, 2022; Paulsen et al., 2022; Pollen et al., 2019; Velasco et al., 2020); 114 as well as formation and maturation of neuronal networks (Cai et al., 2023; Fair et al., 2020; Sharf 115 et al., 2022; Trujillo et al., 2019). 116 117 The use of cortical organoids in academic research and biotechnology has drastically 118 increased in recent years (Salick et al., 2021). For example, cortical organoids are used as tools 119 for drug discovery (Salick et al., 2021), to study genetic mutations underlying disease (Paulsen et 120 al., 2022; Wang, 2018), and to study infectious diseases that affect the brain, such as Zika and 121 COVID-19 (Andrews et al., 2022; Garcez et al., 2016). Given their applications and the trends in 122 the use of these models in research and development, there is a growing need for students to be 123 trained in stem cell culture and cortical organoid generation, manipulation, and analysis. 124 125 Tissue culture courses are challenging to implement due to the high costs of infrastructure 126 and supplies associated with the course, as well as the danger of exposure of students to 127 biohazardous materials (Bowey-Dellinger et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2020). Indeed, the large 128 majority of undergraduate biology students are not trained in cell culture during their education 129 (Bowey-Dellinger et al., 2017). The students who are fortunate to learn tissue culture techniques 130 are usually trained in either plant cell cultures (Harahap et al., 2019; Siritunga et al., 2012) or 131 simple animal cell culture, such as growth and passage of established cell lines (Bowey-Dellinger 132 et al., 2017; McIlrath et al., 2015; Mozdziak et al., 2004; Phelan and Szabo, 2019) or primary cells 133 (Burdo, 2013; Catlin et al., 2016; Lemons, 2012; Haskew-Layton and Minkler, 2020). While 134 remarkable, these approaches are not sufficient to familiarize students with increasingly complex 135 models, such as PSC culture, differentiation, and formation of 3D models, including organoids. 136 137 Despite the high interest of students in the topic (Bajek and Drewa, 2011), classes that 138 focus on stem cell use and applications are mostly theoretical (Ferreira et al., 2019; Perlin et al., 139 2013. Pierret and Friedrichsen, 2009; W Sandoval, 2022). Courses with a lab component usually 140 take advantage of invertebrate organisms such as planaria worms (Accorsi et al., 2017; Ochoa et 141 al., 2019) or hydra (Larouche et al., 2020). On the other hand, courses that integrate mammalian 142 stem cell culture are limited to elementary models such as culture and rapid differentiation of 143 primary multipotent stem cells derived from the bone marrow of rodents (Jin et al., 2018), not 144 PSC-derived models such as complex tissues and organoids. These fail to meet the need for 145 students trained in high-level biomedical cell models. Indeed, students are usually first exposed 146 to PSC-derived models in special extracurricular undergraduate research experiences, such as 147 internships (Halverson et al., 2009). These research experiences are disproportionately 148 accessible to students from privileged backgrounds and institutions (Grineski et al., 2018). To 149 create a diverse workforce in the stem cell field we must find alternative approaches that can 150 effectively train underserved students (Hruska et al., 2022). 151 152 Internet-enabled technologies can be a powerful tool to overcome this gap. When 153 laboratory equipment is connected to the cloud, scientists and students can easily access and 154 manipulate these technologies remotely (Baudin et al., 2022a; Ly et al., 2021; Nagarathna et al., 155 2022; Parks et al., 2022). Moreover, this approach allows exceptional platform scalability, allowing 156 dozens or hundreds of users simultaneously (Baudin et al., 2022b). In the classroom, internet-157\n5\nenabled technologies have been used to drive project-based learning (PBL) approaches in a 158 variety of settings, including the use of microscopes for remote observations of behaviors of model 159 organisms and cell cultures (Baudin et al., 2022b; Hossain et al., 2016; Ly et al., 2021); the use 160 of sensors to monitor environmental conditions (Tabuenca et al., 2023; Tsybulsky and Sinai, 161 2022); and even the use of lab-on-a-chip microfluidic devices to perform bacterial detection in 162 water samples (Sano et al., 2023). 163 164 Here, we take advantage of internet-enabled technologies to introduce cortical organoid 165 PBL in two different university courses: an introductory tissue culture course, where students 166 monitor the growth of organoids in the presence of different drugs; and an advanced neuroscience 167 mathematics course where students stimulate and record from cortical organoids using 168 multielectrode arrays (MEAs). In both approaches, the students can perform PBL over several 169 days. We showed that internet-enabled PBL leads to a high level of interest in neuroscience and 170 stem cell biology in the students in both courses. Altogether we propose that internet-enabled 171 PBL can become an effective approach to deliver complex concepts in stem cell and organoid 172 culture. 173 174 MATERIALS AND METHODS 175 176 Ethics statement 177 178 The University of California Santa Cruz Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed this 179 work at the proposal stage and determined that it did not constitute human subject study. 180 Therefore, the work was IRB exempt. 181 182 Students 183 184 The students were part of two different courses: 1) The students who performed the 185 remote microscopy experiments were undergraduate students enrolled in the Techniques in 186 Tissue Culture course at the University of San Francisco. A total of 10 students were enrolled in 187 this course. 188 189 2) The students who performed the electrophysiology experiments were enrolled in the 190 BME118: Mathematics of the Mind course at the University of California Santa Cruz. A total of 24 191 students were enrolled in this course. 192 193 Surveys 194 195 All surveys were performed using Google Forms. The students received the link to the 196 survey from their instructors. All surveys were completely anonymous and we did not record any 197 identifiable information from any of the students. All students were informed that the answers to 198 the surveys were anonymous and would not influence their grades. 199 200 For the Techniques in Tissue Culture course, we performed one survey at the end of the 201 course. All 10 students who were part of the course responded to this survey. For the Mathematics 202 of the Mind course, we performed 2 surveys: one before the experiment, and one after the 203 experiment. For the pre-experiment survey, 18 students responded. For the post-experiment 204 survey, all 24 students responded. 205 206 Statistics 207 208\n6\nAll of the survey questions presented in figures 2, 3, 4, and 6 were statistically analyzed 209 in Python to determine the significance of responses. Significance was primarily measured using 210 a one sample, two-tailed t-test. The test determines in which survey questions student responses 211 are statistically different from neutral. In order to have an analyzable distribution, we numerically 212 labeled student responses, \"Strongly Disagree\" to \"Strongly Agree,\" from -2 to 2. Under the null 213 hypothesis for the one-sample t-test, student responses are neutral (mean 0). Of the 49 survey 214 questions asked, 92% of them were statistically significant (p-value 0.05). 215 216 To check if final outcomes were consistent between the two courses, postcourse 217 comparisons between the Stem Cell Techniques and the Mathematics of the Mind were 218 performed using Prism 9.5.1 (GraphPad Software). The students\u2019 answers were converted to a 219 1-5 points scale. Comparisons were performed using unpaired two-sample t-tests. Significance 220 was considered when p< 0.05. The results from all surveys compared showed now significance 221 between the distributions, meaning that the surveyed results remained consistent between 222 classes. 223 224 Given that we are working with discretized ordinal (ranked) data, the normality 225 assumptions of the t-test do not completely hold. In such instances, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test 226 is commonly used. We performed a one sample Wilcoxon signed rank test with a median 0 null 227 hypothesis. However, this nonparametric test was limited by the small sample size of our data, 228 10-24 students per survey. Other statistics that were measured for each survey question include 229 the data\u2019s mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, standard error, range, skew, and 230 kurtosis. 231 232 A complete summary of each of the survey\u2019s statistics, as well as the cumulative data 233 used to generate them, can be found at the following link: 234 https://github.com/braingeneers/IOT_Education_Stem_Cell_Paper/blob/main/Main_Code/surve235 y_statistics.ipynb 236 237 Embryonic stem cell culture 238 239 All experiments were performed in the ES-E14TG2a mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) 240 line (ATCC CRL-1821). This line is derived from a male of the 129/Ola mouse strain. Mycoplasma 241 testing confirmed lack of contamination. 242 243 ESCs were maintained on Recombinant Human Protein Vitronectin (Thermo Fisher 244 Scientific # A14700) coated plates using mESC maintenance media containing Glasgow Minimum 245 Essential Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 11710035), Embryonic Stem Cell-Qualified Fetal 246 Bovine Serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 10439001), 0.1 mM MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids 247 (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 11140050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Millipore Sigma # S8636), 2 mM 248 Glutamax supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 35050061), 0.1 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol 249 (Millipore Sigma # M3148), and 0.05 mg/ml Primocin (Invitrogen # ant-pm-05). mESC 250 maintenance media was supplemented with 1,000 units/mL of Recombinant Mouse Leukemia 251 Inhibitory Factor (Millipore Sigma # ESG1107), 1 \u03bcm PD0325901 (Stem Cell Technologies # 252 72182), and 3 \u03bcm CHIR99021 (Stem Cell Technologies # 72054). Media was changed every 2-3 253 days. 254 255 Vitronectin coating was incubated for 15 min at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL dissolved in 256 1X Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 70011044). Dissociation 257 and cell passages were done using ReLeSR passaging reagent (Stem Cell Technologies # 258 05872) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell freezing was done in mFreSR 259\n7\ncryopreservation medium (Stem Cell Technologies # 05855) according to the manufacturer's 260 instructions. 261 262 Cortical organoids generation 263 264 Mouse cortical organoids were grown as previously described by our group (Park et al., 265 2023). To generate cortical organoids we clump-dissociated ESCs using ReLeSR and re-266 aggregated in lipidure-coated 96-well V-bottom plates at a density of 5,000 cells per aggregate, 267 in 150 \u03bcL of mESC maintenance media supplemented with Rho Kinase Inhibitor (Y-27632, 10 268 \u03bcM, Tocris # 1254), 1 \u03bcm PD0325901 (Stem Cell Technologies # 72182), 3 \u03bcm CHIR99021 (Stem 269 Cell Technologies # 72054) (Day -1). 270 271 After one day (Day 0), we replaced the medium with cortical differentiation medium 272 containing Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 11710035), 10% 273 Knockout Serum Replacement (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 10828028), 0.1 mM MEM Non-274 Essential Amino Acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 11140050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Millipore 275 Sigma # S8636), 2 mM Glutamax supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 35050061) 0.1 mM 2-276 Mercaptoethanol (Millipore Sigma # M3148) and 0.05 mg/ml Primocin (Invitrogen # ant-pm-05). 277 Cortical differentiation medium was supplemented with Rho Kinase Inhibitor (Y-27632, 20 \u03bcM # 278 1254), WNT inhibitor (IWR1-\u03b5, 3 \u03bcM, Cayman Chemical # 13659) and TGF-Beta inhibitor 279 (SB431542, Tocris # 1614, 5 \u03bcM, days 0-7). Media was changed every other day until day 7. 280 281 On day 7 organoids were transferred to ultra-low adhesion plates (Millipore Sigma # 282 CLS3471) where media was aspirated and replaced with fresh neuronal differentiation media. 283 The plate with organoids was put on an orbital shaker at 60 revolutions per minute. Neuronal 284 differentiation medium contained Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 with 285 GlutaMAX supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 10565018), 1X N-2 Supplement (Thermo 286 Fisher Scientific # 17502048), 1X Chemically Defined Lipid Concentrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific 287 # 11905031) and 0.05 mg/ml Primocin (Invitrogen # ant-pm-05). Organoids were grown under 5% 288 CO2 conditions. Medium was changed every 2-3 days. 289 290 On day 14 and onward, we added 5 \u03bcg/mL Heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal 291 mucosa (Millipore Sigma # H3149) and 0.5% v/v Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) 292 Basement Membrane Matrix, LDEV-free (Matrigel GFR, Corning # 354230) to the neuronal 293 differentiation medium. 294 295 On day 21 and onward, we transferred the organoids to neuronal maturation media 296 containing BrainPhys Neuronal Medium (Stem Cell Technologies # 05790), 1X N-2 Supplement, 297 1X Chemically Defined Lipid Concentrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 11905031), 1X B-27 298 Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 17504044), 0.05 mg/ml Primocin (Invitrogen # ant-pm-299 05) and 0.5% v/v Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Basement Membrane Matrix, LDEV-300 free. 301 302 Microscopy experiments 303 304 The mouse cortical organoids were the basis of microscopy experiments. The microscope 305 used to image these organoids is a variant of a previously described microscope (Baudin et al., 306 2022), named the Streamscope. The Streamscope is a low cost and open hardware 6-well 307 microscope designed to perform simultaneous longitudinal imaging of cell culture in six separate 308 wells. It produces timelapse sequences tracking morphological changes in cell cultures. The 309 device is constructed from a combination of off-the-shelf and custom-made components. The off-310\n8\nthe-shelf components include a motor driver (Pololu Tic T825), a motor linear actuator module, 311 an LED light panel, and 6 USB cameras (HBVCAM 5MP module with Omnivision 5640 sensor.) 312 The rest of the microscope is composed of parts which can be 3D printed or CNC milled in-house 313 on consumer equipment or ordered from a third-party manufacturing service. 314 315 The organoids were transferred and adhered to a 6 well plate (6 well Nunc\u2122 Cell-Culture 316 Treated Multidishes, Thermo Fisher Scientific #140685). Adhesion was accomplished by 317 transferring 0.5 mL of Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Basement Membrane Matrix, 318 LDEV-free (Matrigel GFR, Corning # 354230) into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf Safe-Lock Tube (Thermo 319 Fisher Scientific #22363204) kept on ice. The organoid was transferred into the matrigel with a 320 wide bore pipette, pipetting up and down gently 5 times to ensure maximal coating. The matrigel 321 coated organoid was then transferred to the 6 well plate and allowed to adhere for 10 minutes at 322 37o C before adding in fresh neuronal maturation media. For the experiments, we tested the 323 effects of two drugs: 1\u03bcM of the proapoptotic drug staurosporine (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 324 NC1401148) and 1\u03bcM of the DNA topoisomerase type I inhibitor camptothecin (Thermo Fisher 325 Scientific # 501361118). In addition, the students had control organoids in which no drugs were 326 added. 327 328 Two plates of organoids atop two Streamscopes were used for this experiment, totalling 329\ntwelve potential wells worth of images. Images of each well were taken approximately every 60 330 seconds over a period of 5 days while the cultures were in the incubator. The images were 331 streamed through YouTube, allowing the users to access the data in real time, as well as after 332 the end of the experiment. 333\n334 After the experiment was terminated, images from each condition were turned into a 335\ntimelapse. The images for each well were converted into timelapses using Adobe Premiere. 336 Images were computer analyzed for features such as organoid area. 337 338 Organoid area measurements 339 340 To reduce the computational load on ImageJ, the software used to calculate the area of 341 the organoids, the time lapse images were subsampled into sparser timelapse images. Starting 342 with the 0-hour time point, images of organoids were sampled every 6 hours for 72 hours total. 343 By interpolating, adjusting threshold parameters in ImageJ and using the tracing tool, areas were 344 determined for each organoid at all time points. 345 346 Electrophysiology experiments 347 348 We plated mouse cortical organoids at day 22 on MaxOne high density multielectrode 349 arrays (Maxwell Biosystems # PSM). Prior to organoid plating, the multielectrode arrays were 350 coated in 2 steps: First, we performed an overnight coating with 0.01% Poly-L-ornithine (Millipore 351 Sigma # P4957) at 37o C overnight. Then washed the plates 3 times with PBS. We then performed 352 an overnight coating with 5 \u03bcg/ml mouse Laminin (Fisher Scientific # CB40232) and 5 \u03bcg/ml 353 human Fibronectin (Fisher Scientific # CB40008) at 37o C. 354 355 After coating, we placed the organoids on the chip and removed excess media. The 356 organoids were then incubated at 37o C for 20 minutes to promote attachment. We then added 357 prewarmed BrainPhys Neuronal Medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL recombinant human brain-358 derived neurotrophic factor (Stem Cell Technologies # 78005), 1X N-2 Supplement (Thermo 359\n9\nFisher Scientific # 17502048), 1X Chemically Defined Lipid Concentrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific 360 # 11905031), 1X B-27 Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 17504044), 0.05 mg/ml Primocin 361 (Invitrogen # ant-pm-05) and 0.5% v/v Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Basement 362 Membrane Matrix, LDEV-free. We changed the media every 2-3 days. 363 364 Using the Maxwell Biosystems software, activity scans were performed every 2-3 days. 365 We sampled signals from 1024 of the ~26,000 electrodes at a time in a sweeping formation across 366 the MEA at an interval of 30-45 seconds for each configuration. A base level of activity was 367 measured by electrical events which crossed the 5-root mean square (rms) noise threshold. If 368 activity was detected, 5\u201312-minute recordings were taken using Maxwell Biosystems\u2019 electrode 369 selection algorithm which maximizes clusters of electrodes around hotspots of high relative firing 370 rate. Neurons were identified by analyzing the neuronal footprint \u2013 the signal averaged waveform 371 across a patch of multiple electrodes surrounding the potential neuron. Neurons chosen to be 372 stimulated required detection of at least 10 threshold-crossing events. We chose stimulation 373 channels as the channels that recorded the highest amplitude signals from the neuron to have 374 the highest probability of evoking action potentials (Radivojevic et al., 2016). 375 376 Data processing 377 378 Raw electrical data from the MEA was saved during each of the experiments in the hdf5 379 format. This data was spike-sorted into individual units (putative neurons) using Kilosort 2 380 (Pachitariu et al., 2023). This process filters the data, whitens (Pachitariu et al., 2023), then 381 clusters neurons based on matching spike-waveform templates. For each identified neuron, this 382 process outputs a list of spikes times together with the spatial location on the MEA. To validate 383 the biological plausibility of the identified neurons, expert human curation was carried out through 384 the open-source software Phy (https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy). Putative neural units are 385 retained if they have key biological features such as a biologically consistent shape and duration 386 for their action potential waveforms. Each experiment recording was individually processed with 387 the same set of spike sorting parameters. Electric stimulation artifacts and noise were removed 388 during the curation. This data was delivered to the students in Python Numpy format allowing 389 easy subsampling. 390 391 Electrophysiology Experimental Design 392 393 Mathematics of the Mind students were introduced to the idea of analyzing 394 electrophysiological measurements by conducting analysis from a previous set of published 395 electrophysiological recordings in human organoids (Sharf et al., 2022). The students were taught 396 to utilize measures including spike-time tiling (Cutts and Eglen, 2014), correlation, inter-spike-397 intervals, and latency distributions to characterize neural circuit behavior. After this initial 398 homework assignment, students were asked to propose a circuit perturbation experiment using 399 electrode-supplied stimulation on live tissue to augment the underlying neural circuitry, where 400 they would analyze spontaneous activity before and after the perturbation. The setup of the 401 experiment involved a five-minute baseline recording, a five minute recording with student-402 designed stimulation, and a fifteen minute post-stimulation recording. The students were 403 specifically tasked with designing and coding their own stimulation paradigm to be executed 404 during their experiment, and proposing a hypothesis for changes that would occur between the 405 baseline and post-stimulation recordings. They were encouraged to be creative. 406 407 Stimulation Programming 408 409\n10\nTo make the task of stimulation paradigm design feasible and straightforward for the 410 Mathematics of the Mind students, a simple application programming interface (API) was 411 designed. The students were told that they could stimulate three neurons in any manner that the 412 API enabled, and they could select the approximate distance of the three neurons as a proxy for 413 connectivity. At a high level, the students craft sequences of stimulations using the API, and 414 choose a frequency to iterate through these stimulation sequences. The API enables the creation 415 of stimulation paradigms by three simple commands: \u2018stim\u2019, \u2018delay\u2019 and \u2018next\u2019. The \u2018stim\u2019 416 command has three parameters: 1) the list of neurons to stimulate, b) the amplitude in millivolts 417 to stimulate, 3) the width of the biphasic pulse. Recommended values of 150 mV for the amplitude 418 and 200 microseconds per phase for the biphasic pulse were given to students. The \u2018delay\u2019 419 command has one parameter: the time to delay in milliseconds. It pauses the stimulation. The 420 \u2018next\u2019 command effectively ends the current stimulation sequence. 421 422 RESULTS 423 424 Internet-connected microscopy enables the incorporation of organoid modules in a tissue 425 culture undergraduate course 426 427 PBL is an effective teaching approach for complex topics in biology, including teaching 428 students who have traditionally underperformed in STEM (Baudin et al., 2022b; Ferreira et al., 429 2019; Petersen, 2021; Sano et al., 2023). We have previously shown that low-cost in-incubator 430 internet-connected microscopes can perform longitudinal imaging of cortical organoids and allow 431 for the systematic tracking of organoid size and morphology over time (Ly et al., 2021), making 432 them ideal tools to perform remote PBL training in the classroom (Baudin et al., 2022b). 433 434 As a proof of principle, we integrated an organoid tracking module within the Techniques 435 in Tissue Culture course at the University of San Francisco, located at approximately 125 km from 436 the experimental site at the University of California Santa Cruz. This course has a strong hands-437 on component in which students learn basic techniques, including 2D culture of mammalian 438 cancer cell lines. The students are exposed to the theory behind organoid generation, but the 439 current curriculum does not have an organoid generation and culture experimental component. 440 In this iteration of the course, 60% of the students were 3rd year undergraduate students, 30% of 441 them were 4th year undergraduate students and 10% of them were students in their 5th year or 442 above. 443 444 To design a project of interest to the students, the professor who was leading the course 445 had a brainstorming session with the students ahead of the experiment. In this session the 446 students were asked to nominate potential drugs that they thought would affect organoid growth. 447 They nominated 2 drugs: staurosporine, a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor that is used in the 448 research setting to induce apoptosis (Chae et al., 2000); and camptothecin, a selective DNA 449 topoisomerase type I inhibitor that has been used to treat different types of cancers (Martino et 450 al., 2017). 451 452 To accommodate the students\u2019 requested project, we continuously imaged mouse cortical 453 organoids starting at differentiation day 26 using a Streamscope, an in-incubator low-cost 454 microscope that has the ability to both record image stills and video, which are then streamed 455 over the internet through YouTube (Baudin et al., 2022b) (Figures 1A-B). The organoids were 456 grown in the presence of either staurosporine or camptothecin. As control, organoids were grown 457 without the presence of any drug. The Streamscope imaged organoids every 60 seconds for 3 458 days (Figure 1A). This approach allowed us to constantly produce data and promote student 459 engagement. The students were divided into groups of 3-4 and were asked to measure the 460\n11\nmaximal organoid area over time. They were then asked to discuss the effects of the drugs as a 461 class. The students observed a reduction in organoid size in organoids that were treated with 462 staurosporine (Figure 1B). Consistent with the fact mouse cortical organoids of this age contain 463 mostly postmitotic neurons (Eiraku et al., 2008; Kadoshima et al., 2013; Park et al., 2023), the 464 students did not observe a reduction in organoid size in camptothecin-treated organoids (Figure 465 1C). We therefore show that internet-connected microscopes can effectively be used in the 466 classroom setting to perform PBL approaches using organoid cultures. 467 468 Remote cortical organoid culture leads to strong interest in stem cell topics 469 470 After the completion of the course, we surveyed the students to understand their 471 satisfaction with the technology and the course, as well as their interest in topics related to stem 472 cells and organoids. All students who were part of the course responded to the survey (Figure 2). 473 474 To measure their satisfaction and interest, we asked the students their level of agreements 475 with different statements. All students said that they enjoyed learning about organoids (Figure 476 2A), and 80% of them thought that performing these experiments helped them solidify the 477 concepts learned in class (Figure 2B). 478 479 We then asked the students how they felt performing experiments using remote 480 microscopy. We found that 80% of the students thought that performing remote microscopy 481 experiments was interesting (Figure 2C) and that it allowed them to use novel experimental 482 models (Figure 2D). Interestingly, only 50% of the students thought that they were able to 483 multitask while performing these experiments (Figure 2E), suggesting that for at least half of the 484 students, performing remote experiments requires them to concentrate to similar levels than in 485 person laboratories. Nevertheless, 70% of the students reported that they enjoyed performing 486 these experiments (Figure 2F) and all thought that data analysis was straightforward (Figure 2G). 487 488 When asked how this project affected their interest in learning about stem cells and 489 organoids, all the students reported that this project made them want to learn more about stem 490 cells (Figure 2H), while 80% of them reported that they want to learn more about organoids (Figure 491 2I). Finally, we find that 90% of the students would recommend this project to their peers (Figure 492 2J), while all students reported that they would recommend this class to others (Figure 2K). 493 Altogether, we conclude that internet-enabled microscopy is an effective approach to introduce 494 students to organoid culture, while increasing their interest in learning topics on stem cells and 495 organoids. 496 497 Electrophysiology software programs run on organoids in a neuroscience mathematics 498 course 499 500 A landmark in neuronal maturation is the acquisition of electrophysiological properties 501 (Fair et al., 2020). These properties follow a stereotypical cell-type specific identity (Cadwell et 502 al., 2016; Gouwens et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2015; Zeng and Sanes, 2017). Given the great diversity 503 of neurons in the cerebral cortex, it is expected that complex models, such as organoids, will have 504 different electrophysiological profiles representative of their cell type composition (Passaro and 505 Stice, 2021). Indeed, the emergence of complex networks in cortical organoids is an active area 506 of research that is expected to continue growing over the next few years (Cai et al., 2023; Fair et 507 al., 2020; Sharf et al., 2022; Trujillo et al., 2019). 508 509 One of the most exciting aspects of the emergence of neuronal circuits is that it provides 510 scientists with the ability to study how neurons in organoids \u201clearn\u201d by adapting to stimuli provided 511\n12\nto them (Zafeiriou et al., 2020). Neuronal plasticity can be evoked in cerebral organoids by 512 sending electrophysiological stimulus patterns (Zafeiriou et al., 2020). These patterns are written 513 using computer code. Therefore, an organoid's neuronal circuitry can be \u201cprogrammed\u201d to 514 produce different types of predictable neuronal responses. 515 516 To date, PBL-based teaching of electrophysiology concepts in the classroom have been 517 limited to either simulation of single neurons using web-based apps (Cannon and Hammond, 518 2008; Demir, 2006; Formella-Zimmermann et al., 2022; Yamamoto et al., 2023) or the use of 519 simple devices to activate and record neuromuscular electrophysiological signals in either 520 invertebrates or the students\u2019 own muscles (Ferreira et al., 2019; Hanzlick-Burton, et al., 2020; 521 Marzullo and Gage, 2012; Ramadan and Ricoy, 2023). While remarkable, these experiments do 522 not offer the capability to ask complex questions in circuit assembly and brain function. 523 Specifically, students do not have the ability to program their own experiments, where they see 524 how neuronal circuitry responds to their code. This is made possible using high-density 525 multielectrode arrays (HD MEAs), in which thousands of electrodes can stimulate and record from 526 a single circuit (Miccoli et al., 2019). For example, the MaxOne system from MaxWell Biosystems 527 has been used to record circuit activity in cortical organoids through its 26,400 electrodes 528 (Paulsen et al., 2022; Sharf et al., 2022). Yet, due to the high costs and experimental complexity 529 associated with these experiments, HD MEAs have not been introduced in the classroom. We 530 have previously developed an internet-connected electrophysiology platform that allows the users 531 to record from MEAs remotely (Voitiuk et al., 2021). This technology could become key for cloud-532 enabled PBL (Baudin et al., 2022b), in which students use experimental platforms that are not 533 located at or owned by their own institutions. 534 535 To deploy this technology for neuroscience education, we integrated it into the 536 Mathematics of the Mind course at University of California Santa Cruz. This course is a mixed 537 upper-level undergraduate and beginning graduate class where most enrolled students are from 538 quantitative fields such as computer science, physics, applied mathematics, and engineering. 539 Students were taught concepts and given supplementary readings within topics such as tetanus-540 induced potentiation dependent on connectivity (Jimbo et al., 1999), Hebbian theory (Hebb, 541 2005), spike-time dependent plasticity (Caporale and Dan, 2008) and homeostatic regulation 542 (Harnack et al., 2015). For the students to properly construct experiments, they were introduced 543 to applied electrophysiology techniques like spike sorting, a neurophysiology technique that 544 allows neuronal spikes to be clustered based on similarities (Quiroga, 2012). To understand how 545 performing live electrophysiological experiments impacted the students, we first surveyed them 546 after the introduction of these concepts but before performing the experiments (Figure 3). Of the 547 24 students enrolled in the class, 18 responded to the precourse survey. We found that the large 548 majority (83.7%) of the students had previous experience in mathematics and computer 549 programming (Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast, 66.6% of the students reported having little to no 550 previous stem cell biology experience (Figure 3C) and 94% of the students reported having little 551 to no previous experience with neuroscience (Figure 3D). 552 553 We then asked the students questions related to their interest in the class and the topics 554 discussed up to this point, and before the execution of live experiments. We found that 94.4% of 555 the students reported that they are interested in the applications of mathematics to biological 556 processes (Figure 3E), and all of them (100%) wanted to learn about Internet-of-Things 557 technologies (Figure 3F). Similarly, 94.4% of the students reported that this course required them 558 to think at a deep level or use critical thinking (Figure 3G). In addition, 83.3% of the students 559 thought that this course allowed them to examine questions that matter beyond the classroom 560 (Figure 3H). When asked about the biological side of the class, 77.7% of the students were 561 interested in learning about stem cells (Figure 3I) and 94.4% of them were interested in learning 562\n13\nabout neuroscience (Figure 3J). Similarly, 88.8% of the students claimed to be interested in 563 learning about \u201cconnectoids\u201d (Figure 3K), long-range connected organoids (Adewole et al., 2021; 564 Cullen et al., 2019; Kirihara et al., 2019). When asked about the technologies to be used in the 565 experiments, 66.6% of the students were comfortable using WetAI (Figure 3L), our custom 566 interface with the experiment (Baudin et al., 2022b), and 72.2% of the students claimed to be 567 comfortable using Jupyter notebooks to perform experiments (Figure 3M). We found that 61.1% 568 of the students said they were comfortable reading neuroscience literature (Figure 3N), while 569 44.4% of the students felt comfortable performing high density MEA experiments at this time 570 (Figure 3O). In addition, 66.6% of the students reported that they would be comfortable identifying 571 spike burst signals in high density MEA data (Figure 3P). Altogether, we observed that, consistent 572 with their academic background, most students are more comfortable with the quantitative aspect 573 of the class than with the biological section, although they demonstrate a high interest in learning 574 topics in stem cell and neuroscience. 575 576 Given the qualities of these students, we then asked them questions related to their 577 mathematics self-concept, as this metric has been previously shown to be a predictor of 578 performance (Colmar et al., 2019; Cribbs et al., 2021; Rueda-G\u00f3mez, et al., 2023). To do so, we 579 asked the students their level of agreement with different statements. We found that 61.1% of the 580 students agreed with the statement \u201cI am capable and skillful at Mathematics\u201d (Figure 4A), while 581 44.4% agreed with the statement \u201cBeing a good mathematics student makes me feel that my 582 classmates and teachers think more of me\u2019\u201d (Figure 4B). These results are similar to previous 583 reports of mathematics self-concept in university students (Rueda-G\u00f3mez, et al., 2023). However, 584 unlike previous reports, we find that half of the students (50%) agree with the statement \u201cIn the 585 mathematics exams I feel unsure, desperate, and nervous\u201d (Figure 4C), while the minority of the 586 students (44.4%) agree with the statement \u201cMy performance in mathematics largely depends on 587 the methodology and empathy with teachers\u201d (Figure 4D). This self-concept profile is consistent 588 with university students who are high achievers in online mathematics training (Rueda-G\u00f3mez, et 589 al., 2023), suggesting that our students were likely to succeed in a remote PBL experiment. 590 Finally, when asked whether they agreed with the statement \u201cMathematics is useful and 591 necessary in all areas of life\u201d, we found that 83.3% of the students agreed (Figure 4E), while 592 88.8% of the students agreed with the statement \u201cMathematics is useful and necessary for a 593 career in Biology\u201d (Figure 4F). The combination of the students\u2019 quantitative skills and interests, 594 as well as their self-concept consistent with high achievers in mathematics, allowed us to 595 conclude that this cohort of students is ideal for implementing remote PBL experiments using high 596 density MEAs. 597 598 As part of the class, we asked students to work in groups to design and program 599 stimulation patterns to be given to cortical organoids. They were asked to propose a hypothesis 600 on what changes they expected to see in network behavior following stimulation. The students 601 then analyzed the results of their stimulation patterns and presented their findings to the class. 602 Each group was assigned two organoids: one to be used as an experimental organoid, and one 603 control (Figures 5A-B). To help the students conduct their electrophysiology experiment, we 604 designed a simple application programming interface (API). Each team of students had the 605 opportunity to watch their stimulation experiment happen on the organoid live, in real time. The 606 experiments were hosted via Zoom, with the class TA presenting the changes in neuronal activity 607 that occurred while the organoids were being stimulated. 608 609 The API mentioned above provided students with considerable freedom in the types of 610 experiment they could construct. One notable group, for example, translated the rhythm of a 611 minimalist song: Steve Reich\u2019s Clapping Music (Figures 5C-D). In this song, two artists clap at 612 rhythms that synchronize and desynchronize throughout the song (Haack, 1991, 1998) (Figures 613\n14\n5C-D). The students wanted to see if this syncing of stimulation patterns might yield a Hebbian-614 like learning outcome. This rhythm has been previously used in mathematics problems in 615 combinatorics and group theory (Haack, 1991, 1998). The students translated each of the 616 clapping sequences to an electrode stimulation pattern using the API (Figures 5D). These 617 patterns were then applied to the experimental organoid (Figure 5E) and the students found that 618 the stimulation pattern had a measurable effect on neuronal behavior (Figures 5F). 619 620 The other groups created experiments of similar rigor and creativity (Figure 6). Three of 621 the five groups stimulated organoids with a high frequency tetanic pattern (Tamura et al., 2020). 622 This experiment was popular because it was explained to have a high chance of prominent 623 changes. Each group approached the problem using a unique protocol they designed. One group 624 used the freedom that the stimulation API provided to design an experiment which generated a 625 random walk over stimulation amplitudes, producing a unique sequence during each generation. 626 This group was interested in whether these stimulation sequences produced unique patterns 627 between neurons connected in a circuit. 628 629 The students were told to rigorously analyze the resulting data from their experiment to 630 determine whether the experiment\u2019s hypothesis was correct through techniques they were taught 631 throughout the class: correlation matrix, spike time tiling coefficient, interspike intervals, and inter-632 neuronal spike latencies. Most importantly, the students had to implement some form of original 633 analysis not taught during the class. This could either be a method learned from reading literature, 634 or a novel technique they design themselves. Most groups implemented either a basic statistical 635 test to verify their hypothesis, or an unsupervised machine learning technique to help interpret 636 results. However, some groups developed novel analysis methods. Of note, one group 637 implemented the underlying algorithm used in Principal Components Analysis (PCA) but using 638 the spike time tiling matrix as the input into the algorithm (Figure 6A-D). The group showed that 639 this new technique was able to discern the test from control organoid based on neural signals 640 (Figure 6D). 641 642 Organoid experiments lead to higher interest in stem cell and neuroscience research in 643 mathematics students 644 645 To understand how the integration of HD MEA recording and stimulation of neuronal cell 646 cultures in the classroom affects the students\u2019 interest in neuroscience and stem cell research, 647 we surveyed the Mathematics of the Mind students immediately after their presentations. All 24 648 students enrolled in the class responded to the survey. We found that 95.8% of the students said 649 that they enjoyed learning about organoids (Figure 7A), and 91.6% enjoyed performing these 650 experiments (Figure 7B). In addition, we found that 91.6% of the students thought that performing 651 remote electrophysiology experiments was interesting (Figure 7C), while 95.8% of the students 652 thought that the experiment selected helped solidify the concepts discussed in the class (Figure 653 7D). 654 655 We then asked the students for their perceptions after performing remote 656 electrophysiology experiments. We found that 83.3% of the students thought that performing 657 these experiments allowed them to perform novel and complex experiments (Figure 7E), while 658 87.5% of the students thought that this approach allowed them to do experiments that required 659 complex training (Figure 7F). 91.6% of the students thought that these experiments allowed them 660 to study new areas beyond their academic program (Figure 7G). 95.8% of the students 661 considered that performing remote experiments allowed them to do projects that are not available 662 to most students around the world (Figure 7H), while 62.5% of the students thought that 663 performing remote experiments allowed them to multitask more than in person labs (Figure 7I). 664\n15\n665 Then, we focused on understanding how performing these experiments influenced the 666 students\u2019 interest in neuroscience and stem cell research. We found that 83.3% of the students 667 thought that performing these experiments increased their interest in stem cells (Figure 7J) while 668 87.5% reported an increased interest in organoids (Figure 7K). Remarkably, we also find that 669 after this course most of the students report a higher comfort in reading and discussing scientific 670 literature in neuroscience (91.6%, Figure 7L), stem cells (79.1%, Figure 7M) and mathematics 671 (66.6%, Figure 7N). 672 673 Finally, we asked the students how this work affected their career prospects. We found 674 that 87.5% of the students would consider continuing further education in stem cells and 675 neuroscience (Figure 7O) and 79.1% would consider applying to jobs analyzing stem cell and 676 neuroscience data (Figure 7P). Altogether we conclude that our approach positively affected the 677 students\u2019 interest in stem cell and neuroscience. 678 679 Internet-connected organoids lead to equivalent outcomes in multiple courses 680 681 Given that the students in both the Techniques in Tissue Culture and the Mathematics of 682 the Mind courses reported positive feelings toward topics in stem cells and neuroscience after the 683 completion of the activities, we compared the post course survey answers of both courses. In 684 total, 8 questions were shared between both post course surveys. These included questions that 685 target the students\u2019 experience, their interest in the topic and their desire to gain further knowledge 686 in stem cells and neuroscience topics (Table 1). We find no statistical difference between any of 687 the answers from students in either course, suggesting that approaches that internet-connected 688 organoids are effective tools for both courses. 689 690 DISCUSSION 691 692 The impact of regenerative biology in the biotechnology and translational medicine sectors 693 has grown exponentially over the past decades (Jacques et al., 2020). Therefore, there is an 694 increased need for exposing students and young professionals to topics related to stem cells and 695 regenerative medicine, including training in experimental design and applications of the 696 technology (Sterner et al., 2020; W Sandoval et al., 2022; Wyles et al., 2019). Scalable 697 approaches that can keep students motivated and engaged during their training should be 698 prioritized to fulfill this demand (Wyles et al., 2020). The use of internet-enabled platforms can 699 inexpensively scale the number of targeted students and reach traditionally underserved 700 communities (Baudin et al., 2022b; Findyartini et al., 2021). Indeed, the use of virtual programs in 701 the topic of regenerative medicine have been explored, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic 702 (Wyles et al., 2020). Yet, in passive online teaching approaches maintaining students\u2019 interest is 703 challenging (Gares et al., 2020), and as a result, virtual courses often have a high dropout rate 704 (Wang et al., 2023). 705 706 PBL approaches in STEM are effective at retaining students, especially those of 707 underrepresented backgrounds (Ferreira et al., 2019). PBL courses are particularly successful 708 when they integrate themes that are trendy in society (Carosso et al., 2019; Cotner and Gallup 709 Jr, 2011). To this end, the high interest of the public and popular media in brain organoids (Presley 710 et al., 2022) can make them ideal tools to train the next generation of students in regenerative 711 medicine. Here, we took advantage of cortical organoids to design PBL modules and target 712 students both in the life sciences, as well as other STEM disciplines, including mathematics, 713 physics, engineering, and computer science. Both groups of students reported that performing 714 the experiments in organoids helped solidify the concepts discussed in class. Furthermore, we 715\n16\nshowed that this approach increased the interest in topics related to neuroscience and stem cell 716 research of both groups of students. In addition, non-biology students showed a higher interest 717 in continuing their education in these topics. Moreover, the internet connectivity of our laboratory 718 hardware allowed the students to perform the experiments remotely, up to 125 km from the 719 experimental site. Additionally, this internet connectivity enables us to scale the number of users 720 at a marginal price (Baudin et al., 2022b; Ly et al., 2021). These two properties open the possibility 721 of massively deploying cloud-enabled technologies for training in neuroscience and regenerative 722 biology. 723 724 We piloted this approach by adding a cortical organoid-based remote experiment module 725 to two courses: a cell culture techniques and a mathematics course. However, organoids can be 726 used in a variety of other PBL courses. For example, cortical organoids of multiple species 727 (Mostajo-Radji et al., 2020; Pollen et al., 2019) can easily be integrated in an evolutionary biology 728 course. \u201cAssembloids\u201d, fused organoids of different brain regions (Pa\u015fca, 2019), can be used to 729 train students in systems neuroscience. Similarly, connectoids (Adewole et al., 2021; Cullen et 730 al., 2019; Kirihara et al., 2019), can be used in the context of teaching higher level interactions 731 between brain areas. Moreover, organoids can become important tools to teach chemistry in the 732 context of drug screens (Salick et al., 2021; Schuster et al., 2020). Bioengineering courses can 733 benefit from organoids experiments to teach biomaterials and sacrificial networks (Grebenyuk 734 and Ranga, 2019). Finally, deriving organoids from multiple body regions beyond the brain, could 735 be of benefit to physiology and pharmacology courses (Clevers, 2016). 736 737 While the work presented here is the proof of principle in two undergraduate courses, it 738 can easily scale to larger amounts of users. For example, with microscopy-based experiments, 739 larger classes can form subgroups of students who work together, multiplex experiments through 740 time scheduling, and poll students to vote for specific classroom-wide experiments. Importantly, 741 because the experiments are streamed through YouTube, there is no technical limit in the number 742 of users (Pires and Simon, 2015). Furthermore, because YouTube takes advantage of dynamic 743 adaptive video streaming technology (Suman et al., 2022), it can deliver a similar quality of 744 experience to students located in poor network conditions (Seufert et al., 2015). Indeed our group 745 has previously applied these strategies in multi-course projects scaling to over 130 students and 746 5 countries simultaneously, showing that this approach can develop STEM identity and transmit 747 complex topics in students in all the settings tested (Baudin et al., 2022b). 748 749 The scalability of electrophysiology projects would follow a different approach. While the 750 HD MEAs used in these experiments have a high cost ($200/chip) and require expensive capital 751 equipment, there are ~26,000 electrodes in the HD MEAs, which can be distributed to lower the 752 per user costs. Specifically, users can read from 1,024 electrodes simultaneously and of those 753 they can stimulate from 32. We can switch to a new set of 1,024 in seconds. This allows us to 754 multiplex the system in various ways: by assigning different sets of electrodes for recording and 755 stimulation to different subgroups within the class or individually to each student, depending on 756 class size. For extended experiments, each student or group can design a stimulation pattern 757 and our interface can apply these extended patterns to the same or different chips sequentially. 758 In addition to the multiplexing of experiments, we have developed a strategy to scale the use of 759 the software and lecture materials to reach more students. The coding lectures and homeworks 760 were aggregated into a single public repository for future education 761 (https://github.com/Braingeneers-Education). We integrated a newly developed cloud 762 environment, Github Codespaces to allow anyone to access course tutorials. The software is web 763 based, requiring no downloads, and can be run from any computer or tablet. 764 765\n17\nWe showed that the integration of cortical organoids to the classroom develops interest in 766 stem cell and neuroscience topics. However, this study has some limitations. First, the work was 767 performed in a small number of students, and larger studies including multiple classrooms from 768 around the world are necessary to understand how the local context affects students\u2019 experience. 769 Second, while the focus of this study was on measuring the user experience of students after the 770 introduction of remote cortical organoids experiments, future research is needed to understand 771 the potential of organoids as pedagogical tools to transmit complex neuroscience and stem cell 772 concepts. In the past, we used remote tissue culture as a viable alternative to in person training 773 in underserved locations and have shown that this approach is an effective pedagogical tool 774 (Baudin et al., 2022b). However, controlled experiments comparing multiple courses throughout 775 years are still needed to understand the true potential of organoids in the classroom. Third, our 776 interventions were short and students were surveyed soon after the experiments were concluded. 777 Many of the students graduated after the course. Therefore, it was difficult to track the students 778 long-term. We are currently working on courses that would introduce students to cortical 779 organoids early in their undergraduate degrees, which will enable us to measure the long-term 780 effects of these interventions. This is particularly relevant to remove the \u201cnovelty effect\u201d from 781 analysis. Indeed, other studies using computer-based technology, such as virtual reality 782 platforms, in PBL have shown the continued student engagement long after the introduction of 783 these technologies (Tsay et al., 2020). This is likely due to the \u201cfamiliarization effect\u201d as students 784 become more accustomed to the technologies (Rodrigues et al., 2022). Finally, while the 785 experiments can be performed in poor network conditions, they still require internet connectivity, 786 which can limit the accessibility of students in remote locations. New partnerships that leverage 787 engineering innovations, such as tethered balloons or drones, to deliver internet (Alsamhi et al., 788 2016; Belmekki and Alouini, 2022) can become crucial to expand the reach and impact of this 789 work. 790 791 In conclusion, we provided a proof of principle study using organoids as novel pedagogical 792 tools for undergraduate education. We developed PBL-based curricula using imaging and 793 electrophysiological tools. By connecting these technologies to the cloud, we were able to teach 794 the courses remotely, while at the same time scaling to allow multiple students to interact with the 795 same experimental platform. This approach led to a higher interest of the students toward stem 796 cell and neuroscience paths. Altogether, this approach has the potential to greatly expand training 797 in regenerative medicine and neuroscience and reach students currently underserved in their 798 communities. 799 800 DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT 801 802 The consent given by the participants does not allow for open storage of data on an 803 individual level in public repositories.

Students were 1249 assigned two cerebral organoids (a test and control) to use in an experiment they designed. The 1250 organoids were placed on an HD MEA, which was used to send their electrophysiology stimulus 1251 pattern. B. The students used online software to explore the data. The software shows the location 1252 of neurons across the two organoids it is interacting with, as well as stimulation sites. Students 1253 can select a neuron to view specific information from it, such as the spike raster. C. The 1254 experiment shown involved a team of students who decided to code the rhythm of Steve Reich\u2019s 1255 duet, Clapping Music. Each performers\u2019 pattern was sent to different neurons. Image is from 1256 Reich\u2019s music score. D. The students use the online software to verify that the stimulation pattern 1257 sent to the neurons follows the rhythm of the music. Red and blue represent the stimulation 1258 patterns sent to 2 different neuronal sites. E. The students were given the neuronal spike raster 1259 data from before, during and after the experiment. These graphs display the time points at which 1260 different neurons fire action potentials. Students can determine if the stimulus pattern they created 1261 evoked the predicted neuronal response by comparing the firing patterns between neurons. F. 1262 Example of the types of computational analysis students performed. To see if the stimulation had 1263 an effect on the neurons, this team performed a statistical test on the cosine similarity score, a 1264 metric of correlation. The test compared spontaneous activity directly after stimulation to that of 1265\n28\n10 minutes after. They noticed that there was a statistically significant difference in the distribution 1266 of the cosine similarities between the two timepoints. MCMC fit = Markov-Chain Monte Carlo fit. 1267 1268\nFigure 6. Example of Mathematics of the mind student-project applying tetanic pattern 1269 to cortical organoids. A.

C. 1272 Comparison of eigendecomposition on the spike time tiling matrix to other popular correlation 1273 techniques. Specifically, they considered how the method's reconstruction error compared to 1274 that of performing principal components analysis on the correlation matrix. D. 1275 Superimposition of the first eigenvector's values (represented as small circles in the blue-1276 yellow range) on top of their corresponding neural unit allowed the students to differentiate 1277 which neurons came from which organoid. 1278\n1279\nFigure 7.
