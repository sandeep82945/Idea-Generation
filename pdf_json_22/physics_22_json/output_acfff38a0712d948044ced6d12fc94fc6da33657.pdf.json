To describe the hydrodynamic interaction, both the Oseen-type and the Rotne-PragerYamakawa (RPY)-type mobilities are used. For the Oseen-type mobility, the simulation results quantitatively reproduce the asymptotic expression of the average velocity. For the RPY-type mobility, on the other hand, the average velocity is smaller than that of the Oseen-type mobility and the deviation is more pronounced for larger spheres. We also perform simulations of microswimmers having different sphere sizes and show that the average velocity becomes smaller than that of the equal size case. The size of the middle sphere plays an important role in determining the average velocity.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nRecently, Scheibner et al. introduced the concept of odd elasticity that is useful to characterize nonequilibrium active systems [1, 2]. Odd elasticity arises from antisymmetric (odd) components of the elastic modulus tensor that violates the energy conservation law and thus can exist only in active materials [3] or biological systems [4]. Unlike passive materials, a finite amount of work can be extracted in odd elastic systems through quasi-static cycle of deformations [1, 2]. It was also shown that antisymmetric parts of the time-correlation functions in odd Langevin systems are proportional to the odd elasticity [5]. The concept of odd elasticity can be further extended to quantify the nonreciprocality of active micromachines (such as enzymes or motor proteins) and microswimmers [6, 7]. According to Purcell\u2019s scallop theorem for microswimmers [8], nonreciprocal body motion is required for locomotion in a Newtonian fluid. Within the Onsager\u2019s variational principle [9], it was shown that odd elastic moduli are proportional to the nonequilibrium force [10].\nMoreover, we have proposed a model of a thermally driven microswimmer in which three spheres are connected by two springs having odd elasticity [11]. It was theoretically shown that the presence of odd elasticity leads to a directional locomotion of the stochastic microswimmer. We have analytically obtained the average velocity under the assumption that the sphere size and the spring extensions are small enough compared to the natural length of the spring. As we show later again, the average velocity is proportional to the odd elastic constant whose sign determines the swimming direction.\nIn this paper, we report the results of numerical simulations of odd microswimmers to check the va-\n\u2217 komura@wiucas.ac.cn\nlidity of our analytical prediction [11]. For comparison, we use both the Oseen-type and the Rotne-PragerYamakawa (RPY)-type hydrodynamic mobilities in our simulations [12, 13]. To numerically integrate the multiplicative Langevin equations, we also employ the previously suggested formulation that assures the equilibrium distribution [14, 15]. Although our previous work considered only the case when the sphere size is identical [11], we also perform the simulations for odd microswimmers having different sphere sizes."

            "text": "Let us first review the model of an odd microswimmer [11]. As depicted in Fig. 1, we consider a threesphere microswimmer in which the positions of the three spheres of radius ai are given by xi (i = 1, 2, 3) in a one-dimensional coordinate system [16, 17]. These three spheres are connected by two springs that exhibit both even and odd elasticities [1, 2]. We denote the two spring extensions by uA = x2 \u2212 x1 \u2212 ` and uB = x3 \u2212 x2 \u2212 `, where ` is the natural length. Then the forces FA and FB conjugate to uA and uB, respectively, are given by F\u03b1 = \u2212K\u03b1\u03b2u\u03b2 (\u03b1, \u03b2 = A,B). For an odd spring, the elastic constant K\u03b1\u03b2 is given by [5\u20137, 11]\nK\u03b1\u03b2 = K e\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 +K o \u03b1\u03b2 , (1)\nwhere Ke and Ko are even and odd elastic constants in the two-dimensional configuration space, \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 is the Kronecker delta, and \u03b1\u03b2 is the 2D Levi-Civita tensor. The forces fi acting on each sphere are given by f1 = \u2212FA, f2 = FA \u2212 FB, and f3 = FB. We note that these forces satisfy the force-free condition, i.e., f1+f2+f3 = 0.\nThe above odd microswimmer is immersed in a fluid of shear viscosity \u03b7 and temperature T .

Ke, Ko\nFIG. 1. (Color online) Odd microswimmer in a fluid with viscosity \u03b7 and temperature T . Three spheres of radius ai (i = 1, 2, 3) are connected by two springs with natural length `. Each spring has both even elastic constant Ke and odd elastic constant Ko.\nwhere x\u0307i = dxi/dt and Mij are the hydrodynamic mobility coefficients. In the previous work, we used the Oseentype mobility [11]\nMOij =\n{ 1/(6\u03c0\u03b7ai) (i = j)\n1/(4\u03c0\u03b7 |xi \u2212 xj |) (i 6= j) . (3)\nThe Gaussian white-noise sources \u03bei have zero mean, \u3008\u03bei(t)\u3009 = 0, and their correlations satisfy the fluctuationdissipation theorem \u3008\u03bei(t)\u03bej(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2kBTMOij \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032), where kB is the Boltzmann constant. The total velocity of the microswimmer is given by V = (x\u03071 + x\u03072 + x\u03073)/3.\nWhen all the spheres have the same radius a, the average velocity was obtained in the limit of uA, uB ` and a ` as [11]\n\u3008V \u3009 \u2248 7kBT\u03bb 48\u03c0\u03b7`2 , (4)\nwhere \u03bb = Ko/Ke. As discussed in Ref. 1, \u3008V \u3009 in Eq. (4) is the product of the geometrical factor, the explored area in the configuration space, and the speed of the rotational probability flux.\nIn the current simulation study, we also use the RPYtype mobility that takes into account the next-higher order term in the far-field approximation [12, 13]:\nMRPYij =  1/(6\u03c0\u03b7ai) (i = j) 1 4\u03c0\u03b7|xi \u2212 xj | ( 1\u2212 a2i + a 2 j 3|xi \u2212 xj |2 ) (i 6= j and |xi \u2212 xj | \u2265 ai + aj) 1 6\u03c0\u03b7a\u0303ij ( 1\u2212 3|xi \u2212 xj | 16a\u0303ij ) (i 6= j and |xi \u2212 xj | < ai + aj) . (5)\nThe last expression is used when the spheres overlap each other, and we employ a\u0303ij = (ai + aj)/2 for the effective Stokes radius [18]. Although this is not the unique form of the effective Stokes radius [18\u201320], the above choice is sufficient for our simulation because the motion of the microswimmer is restricted to a one-dimensional space."

To solve such Langevin equations numerically, we use the Ito\u0302 interpretation xi\n\u2217 = xi(t) and integrate the quantities [14, 15]\ndxi = Mij(x \u2217)fj(x \u2217)dt+ kBT \u2202Mij(x\n\u2217)\n\u2202xj dt + \u221a 2kBT\u039bk`(x\u2217)Qik(x \u2217)(Q\u22121)`j(x \u2217)dWj , (6)\nwhere dWj \u223c \u221a dt is the increment of a Wiener process and \u039bij = (Q \u22121)ikMk`Q`j is the diagonalized matrix [(Q\u22121)ij being the inverse matrix of Qij ]. The second term (proportional to kBT ) on the right-hand side of Eq. (6) guarantees the equilibrium distribution and is also required for nonequilibrium situations [14, 15].\nIt should be noted that both of the mobility matrices MOij and M RPY ij are not positive definite. Hence, we terminate the simulation when the eigenvalue of \u039bk` becomes negative because we need to take its square root in Eq. (6). In the actual simulations, such a situation occurred only for MOij when ai is large and the distances between the spheres |xi \u2212 xj | become small. (More details are explained in the caption of Fig. 2.) In the case of MRPYij , on the other hand, we did not encounter such a situation and all the simulation runs were completed without any termination.\nWe scale all the lengths by ` and use the spring relaxation time \u03c4 = 6\u03c0\u03b7`/Ke to make the time dimensionless, i.e., t\u0302 = t/\u03c4 . The dimensionless time increment is chosen as dt\u0302 = 0.01 for \u03bb \u2264 1 and dt\u0302 = 0.001 for \u03bb > 1. The simulations were performed for two different dimensionless temperatures, i.e., T\u0302 = kBT/(K\ne`2) = 0.01 and 0.001. Each run consists of 107 updates of the sphere positions. To calculate the average velocity \u3008V \u3009, we have taken the average over 2 \u00d7 103 and 4 \u00d7 103 independent runs for equal and different sphere size cases, respectively."

In Fig. 2(a), we plot the dimensionless average velocity \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 = \u3008V \u3009\u03c4/` as a function of \u03bb = Ko/Ke when a\u0302 = 0.3 and T\u0302 = 0.01. The black straight line is the scaled asymptotic expression in Eq. (4), \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 = 7T\u0302 \u03bb/8, whereas the red and blue circles are the simulation results obtained by using the Oseen-type (MOij ) and the RPY-type (M RPY ij ) mobilities, respectively. For the Oseen-type mobility, the simulation result agrees well with the asymptotic expression except for larger \u03bb values which give slightly smaller \u3008V\u0302 \u3009. This result confirms the validity of Eq. (4) for the above\n3\nparameters. For the RPY-type mobility, on the other hand, the simulation result is systematically smaller than Eq. (4) although the linear dependence on \u03bb is still maintained. This is indicated by the fitted blue dashed line that has a smaller slope. The reason for smaller \u3008V \u3009 is that the inter-sphere interaction for MRPYij is generally weaker than that for MOij . Notice that, in the analytical derivation of Eq. (4), we have used the condition a\u0302 1 while \u03bb does not necessarily have to be small.\nIn Fig. 2(b), we plot the average velocity \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 as a function of the sphere size a\u0302 when \u03bb = 1 and T\u0302 = 0.01. According to Eq. (4), \u3008V \u3009 does not depend on the sphere size a as shown by the black line. For the Oseen-type\nmobility (red circles), the simulation result is relatively in good agreement with the asymptotic expression up to a\u0302 \u2264 0.35. When a\u0302 > 0.4, however, the mobility matrix is no longer positive definite and most of the simulation runs were terminated. (This is why there is no red data plotted for a\u0302 \u2265 0.4 for the Oseen-type mobility. The ratio of terminated simulation runs for a\u0302 \u2264 0.35 is written in the caption of Fig. 2.) For the RPY-type mobility (blue circles), the simulation result coincides with the asymptotic expression up to a\u0302 \u2264 0.15. For a\u0302 \u2265 0.2 the simulation data systematically deviates from the asymptotic value and the deviation is more pronounced for larger spheres.\nWhen we reduce the temperature to T\u0302 = 0.001, the average velocity discussed above simply decreases by ten times. This is consistent with the fact that \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 is proportional to T\u0302 in Eq. (4). Since the \u03bb- and a\u0302-dependencies are essentially the same, we do not show the results for T\u0302 = 0.001."

            "text": "Next, we discuss the cases when the sphere sizes are different. This is currently possible only by performing simulations because there is no corresponding analytical prediction. In order to make fair comparisons, we investigate several cases for which the average sphere size is always fixed to (a\u03021 + a\u03022 + a\u03023)/3 = 0.2. We use the RPY-type mobility for all the cases and the parameters are set to \u03bb = 1 and T\u0302 = 0.01 as before. The simulation results of the average velocity \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 are summarized in Table I.

For comparison, we impose the conditions (a\u03021 + a\u03022 + a\u03023)/3 = 0.2 and a\u03021 = a\u03023 (fore-aft symmetric microswimmers).\nmetric microswimmers). For the case (B), on the other hand, all the spheres have different sphere size (fore-aft asymmetric microswimmers).\nIn Fig. 3, we plot \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 as a function of the middle sphere size a\u03022 for the case (A) in Table I. Within this comparison, we clearly see that \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 takes the largest value when all the spheres have the same size, i.e., \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 \u2248 7.68\u00d710\u22123 when 0.2\u20130.2\u20130.2. Hence, for the fore-aft symmetric microswimmers, the size of the middle sphere essentially determines their average velocity.\nFor the fore-aft asymmetric microswimmers in case (B), on the other hand, we first note that \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 is always smaller than that of the equal size case, i.e., 0.2\u20130.2\u20130.2. It is interesting to note that \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 almost coincides (within the error bars) between the two asymmetric microswimmers such as 0.1\u20130.2\u20130.3 and 0.3\u20130.2\u20130.1. (However, such a quantitative coincidence may not hold between 0.2\u20130.1\u2013 0.3 and 0.3\u20130.1\u20130.2.) Even for these fore-aft asymmetric microswimmers, the size of the middle sphere a\u03022 plays an important role and the behavior of \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 is similar to Fig. 3. The average velocity takes the largest and the smallest values for a\u03022 = 0.2 and 0.1, respectively.\nThe decrease of \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 for the different sphere size cases can be physically understood in the following way. In general, the change in the average velocity can be attributed to both active and passive origins. Within the comparison in Fig. 3, the overall hydrodynamic friction is similar because the average sphere size has been fixed, leading to the similar passive contribution. The fact that \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 dramatically reduces both for a\u03022 a\u03021 = a\u03023 (effectively one sphere) and a\u03022 a\u03021 = a\u03023 (effectively two\nspheres) is that the internal actuation due to odd elasticity does not operate efficiently for these cases. Hence the drop of \u3008V\u0302 \u3009 in Fig. 3 can be mainly explained by the lack of internal active drive in odd microswimmers having different sphere size."

            "heading": "V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "To conclude, we have performed the numerical simulations of the previously proposed odd microswimmers by using both the Oseen-type and the RPY-type mobilities. For the Oseen-type mobility, the simulation results quantitatively reproduce the asymptotic expression of the average velocity. For the RPY-type mobility, on the other hand, the average velocity is smaller than that of the Oseen-type mobility due to the weaker hydrodynamic interactions. Performing simulations for microswimmers having different sphere sizes, we showed that the average velocity becomes smaller than that of the equal size case. Moreover, the size of the middle sphere plays an important role in determining the average velocity for both fore-aft symmetric and antisymmetric microswimmers.\nHere, we give a rough estimate of the parameter \u03bb = Ko/Ke that is the most important quantity in our model. We consider the case when the concept of odd elasticity is applied to the structural changes of enzymes and motor proteins even though they are usually not microswimmers [5\u20137]. According to the experiments on a kinesin molecule [21], the even elasticity can be roughly estimated as Ke \u2248 10\u22124 J/m2. On the other hand, the active force due to kinesin is estimated to be f \u2248 10\u221211 N [21]. By roughly estimating the natural length to be ` \u2248 10\u22128 m, the odd elastic constant can be estimated as Ko \u223c f/` \u2248 10\u22123 J/m2. Then the ratio between the odd and even elastic constants is typically \u03bb = Ko/Ke \u2248 10. This is consistent with the plotted range of \u03bb Fig. 2(a). (Notice again that \u03bb in Eq. (4) does not necessarily have to be small.)\nEven though odd microswimmers are not yet realized experimentally, the concept of odd elasticity has been employed in odd active robots [22, 23]. We believe that the results of the current simulations will be useful in designing odd microswimmers in the future."
