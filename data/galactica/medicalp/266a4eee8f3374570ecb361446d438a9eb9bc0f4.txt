The present paper describes a 53-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a history of sudden chest pain followed by unconsciousness at home. The autopsy revealed the left vertebral artery (LVA)'s aberrant origin from the aortic arch between the left common carotid artery and subclavian artery in a male deceased during a medicolegal autopsy. The aortic origin of the vertebral artery is an unusual branching pattern. Knowledge about the vertebral artery's normal and variant arterial anatomy is essential for patients who undergo various surgical or interventional procedures. In the sudden death of cardiac origin, its anatomy and morphology also hold crucial value. Typically, the LVA arises from the first part of the left subclavian artery (LSA). Categories: Forensic Medicine conclusions The vertebral arteries originate from the subclavian arteries on both sides. However, the uncommon origin of the left vertebral arteries has been documented in the literature. In such a scenario, the LVA may originate directly from the aortic arch instead of the LSA. These anomalous origins are not always a cause of concern for the patient. However, sometimes it can cause changes in cerebral hemodynamics, leading to cerebrovascular complications.
