INTRODUCTION\nUnderstanding the dynamics of macromolecules and nanoparticles through crowded complex environments such as polymer matrix (solutions, melts, or networks), and colloidal suspensions, is of great interest to researchers, due to its implications across the scientific disciplines, including biophysics, materials science, chemistry, and medical engineering.1\u201310 Living cells are occupied by a variety of macromolecules, namely proteins, enzymes, chromosomefilled nucleus, etc., which are immersed in cytoplasmic fluid. The diffusion of these biomolecules plays pivotal role in various physiochemical processes, such as protein-protein association, enzyme reactions, gene transcription, and signal transmission.11\u201314 In vitro, several recent experimental studies have focused on the diffusion of passive agents like nanoparticles in viscoelastic medium, made of polymeric chains, mimicking mucus membrane, nuclear pore complex etc.2,15\u201318 In general, these studies based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and single-particle tracking (SPT) add to our understanding of the transport mechanism of specific molecules (drug-carriers), pathogens, proteins through biological hydrogels. The selective transport of these molecules greatly depends on their size, affinity towards the network, mesh-size and elasticity of the network etc.15,19\u201324\nTransport process becomes even more intriguing when the tracers are driven out of equilibrium. Examples include, motor assisted macromolecules,25,26 bacteria,27,28 spermatozoa,29,30 micro-tubules31, and active filaments28,32 along with numerous artificial microswimmers such as half-coated Janus spheres,33,34 chiral particles,35 active colloids,36 catalytic nanomotors,26,37 and vesicles.38 These objects are capable of generating directed motion by drawing\nenergy from their environments, such as either by consuming ATP,31,32 using chemical reactions,36,39 due to concentration gradient,27,39 self-electrophoresis,40 by light-induced asymmetric photodecomposition,39,41 or due to temperature gradients42. Obviously these objects are out of equilibrium and some of these exhibit self-propelled motion, examples include bacteria, active colloids, Janus particles etc.\nSome of the recent experimental and simulation studies focused on the transport mechanism of the self-propelled particle in viscoelastic and crowded media.33,34,43\u201353 Presence of crowders make the dynamics of these self-propelled probes quite complex. Not only the translational motion but the rotational motion of these active probes get enhanced as found in experiments33,54 and further supported by simulations.46 A similar observation has been reported in a theoretical and computational investigation of self-propelled tracers in densely packed nonmotile solid particles51. On the other hand, an experiment on E. coli in a polymeric solution demonstrated an enhancement in cell translational diffusion and a sharp decrease in rotational diffusion.55 Adding to these, some studies of the self-propelled particles in crowded media have predicted non-monotonous behavior of the rotational diffusivity with the area fraction of the crowders.46,56 Very recently there have been attempts to investigate the dynamics of self-propelled particles in polymer network by computer simulations.50,57 But still a comprehensive picture of active tracer dynamics over a range of activity in dense polymeric network is largely lacking.\nIn the present work, we investigate the dynamics of selfpropelled tracer particles inside a dense polymer network using computer simulations. The network is constructed on a diamond lattice, where each lattice site is occupied by a monomer (bead) and each monomer is connected to the four\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n03 62\n6v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nof t]\n7 D\nec 2\n02 2\n2 nearest neighboring monomers by finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) springs. The self-propelled tracer particles are modeled as a spherical active Brownian particles (ABPs) (Fig. 1). Here, the total volume occupied by the polymer network is \u223c 33% (see Section II for details), comparable to the crowder fractions in living cells, where 30\u201340% of the total volume is occupied by biopolymers, such as proteins, nucleic acids, ribosomes, and other crowders. In our simulations, the polymer network is not frozen and after equilibration, it has fluctuating mesh sizes ranging from 0.9 to 1.8\u03c3 . Though, our gel is constructed on a lattice, but the fluctuating mesh sizes provide some extent of heterogeneity, as found in case of real polymer gels. Our mesh-like structured environment is quite different from the previously considered polymeric systems in computational studies. Earlier, people have considered network formed by connecting polymer chains or double-spring polymer network models with well-defined mesh size and network topology.21,48,58,59 In particular, we aim at elucidating the tug of war between self-propulsion force and the binding affinity of the tracer with the network and on the process of transport. In addition, the size of the tracer and the strength of self-propulsion are expected to play important role. In the current study, we carry out Langevin dynamics simulations in the overdamped limit which is more realistic for all practical purposes. We found that the dynamics of the tracer crossover short-time subdiffusion to an intermediate-time superdiffusion. We attribute that subdiffusion is due to sticky confined motion of the tracer which eventually changes to superdiffusion in case of active tracers. There is a competition between the suppressed motion of the tracer inside a mesh and its tendency to escape from it due to self-propulsion. Interestingly, when the activity is high, the particle always undergoes superdiffusive dynamics at the intermediate time, while for weakly active tracer a short time subdiffusion emerges before it becomes superdiffusive. On the other hand, for the sticky passive tracer, the dynamics is never superdiffusive but subdiffusive before it becomes diffusive in the long time. The bigger tracers, if sticky, show stronger subdiffusion and if active also exhibits stronger superdiffusion compared to a tracer of smaller size. Our analyses of the self-part of the van-Hove correlation function of the tracers show that the the correlations increasingly become broader and non-Gaussian on increasing the magnitude of active force but approaches Gaussianity in the long time, if the activity is zero or moderate. Tracers with high self-propelled velocities tend to have even broader and flat distributions in the long time, indicating free unhindered transport through the network. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the model and simulation details. Results and discussion are presented in Section 3 and lastly, we conclude the paper in Section 4."

Next, a total of NP = 25 tracer particles (repulsive to each other) are randomly placed inside the polymer network to get better statistics (Fig. 1).

The total potential energy of the system\n3\ncan be written as V (r) =VFENE +VLJ +VWCA, where VFENE is spring potential for the polymer gel, VLJ is the attractive potential, and VWCA corresponds to repulsive interactions. fi(t) is the Gaussian thermal noise with the statistical properties,\n\u3008 f (t)\u3009= 0, \u2329 f\u03b1(t \u2032) f\u03b2 (t \u2032\u2032) \u232a = 6\u03b3kBT \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4 (t \u2032\u2212 t \u2032\u2032) (5)\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the system temperature, and \u03b4 represents the Dirac delta-function, \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent the Cartesian components. In Eq. 4, Fa is the amplitude of the active force (self-propulsion) which acts along the direction of a unit vector n and it changes randomly with time as follows\ndn dt = \u03b6 (t)\u00d7n, (6)\nhere, \u03b6 (t) is also a Gaussian white-noise random vector, having moments\n\u3008\u03b6 (t)\u3009= 0, \u2329 \u03b6\u03b1(t \u2032)\u03b6\u03b2 (t \u2032\u2032) \u232a = 2Dr\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4 (t \u2032\u2212 t \u2032\u2032) (7)\nwhere Dr denotes the rotational diffusion coefficient. The translational (Dt ) and rotational diffusion (Dr) coefficients of a spherical particle of size \u03c3 are related via Dr = 3Dt \u03c32\n. The polar form of the stochastic Eq. 6 can be obtained by transforming the Cartesian coordinates into the form of spherical coordinates (cos\u03c6sin\u03b8 ,sin\u03c6sin\u03b8 ,cos\u03b8);\nd\u03b8 dt = \u03b6ycos\u03c6 \u2212\u03b6xsin\u03c6 (8)\nd\u03c6 dt = \u03b6z\u2212\u03b6x cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 \u2212\u03b6y cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 (9)\nwhere \u03b6x, \u03b6y, and \u03b6z are the Cartesian coordinates of the Gaussian white noise \u03b6 . We can alternatively express the strength of active force Fa in terms of a dimensionless quantity, P\u00e8clet number Pe, defined as Pe = Fa\u03c3kBT . Therefore, Pe = 0 corresponds to the passive case and for the passive particles of polymer network. Thus, the self-propelled particles in our simulations are active Brownian particles (ABPs), having non-Gaussian intermediate time dynamics, even in the free space and therefore, differs from the model like active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle (AOUP), which is Gaussian by construction.53,57,63\u201367\nAll the simulations were carried out in LAMMPS, a freely available open-source molecular dynamics simulation package.68 The integration time step \u2206t = 5\u00d710\u22124\u03c4 is chosen to be a constant in all the simulations. All the simulations are performed using the Langevin thermostat and the equation of motion (Eq. 4) integrated using the velocity Verlet algorithm in each time step. First, we equilibriate the system by running the simulations sufficiently long, such that the average monomer-monomer distance (mesh size) is nearly constant in the range \u03c3mesh = 0.95\u22121.1, this also gives a rough measure of the mesh size for the polymer gel (Fig. S1). Thereafter, all the production simulations are carried out for 5\u00d7108 steps.\nIn our simulations, \u03c3 , \u03b5 , and m are taken as the fundamental units of length, energy, and mass respectively. Thus, the unit of time is \u03c4 = \u03c3 \u221am \u03b5 . All other physical quantities are therefore reduced accordingly, expressed in terms of these fundamental units, \u03c3 ,\u03b5 , and m, and presented in dimensionless forms.\n4"

            "text": "In order to study the influence of the self-propulsion on the dynamics of the tracer particles inside the polymer network, we compute the time-and-ensemble average of mean-square displacement (MSD) (\u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a) as a function of lag time \u03c4 .\nIn the first step, we quantify the time-averaged MSD from a single trajectory via:\n\u2206r2(\u03c4) = 1\nTmax\u2212 \u03c4 \u222b Tmax\u2212\u03c4 0 [r(t + \u03c4)\u2212 r(t)]2dt, (10)\nwhere Tmax is the total simulation run time, r(t) represents the position of the tracer at initial time t, and r(t + \u03c4) denotes that after lag time \u03c4 . This time-averaged MSD based on a single trajectory becomes unreliable, in particular, as the lag time \u03c4 becomes long. Therefore, we obtain the time\u2013ensemble\u2013average MSD by performing double averaging, in other words ensemble-averaging over the timeaveraging to get smoother MSD profiles,\n\u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a =\n1 N\nN\n\u2211 i=1 \u2206r2i (\u03c4), (11)\nwhere N is the total number of independent trajectories. We run two independent simulations each for 25 tracer particles for a given set of parameters, so in our simulations, N = 50. Initially, we simulate the passive (Fa = 0) and active (Fa 6= 0) tracer particle in a free space and compute \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a as a\nfunction of lag time \u03c4 to validate the set of parameters used for our simulations. We fit the numerically calculated \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a curves with the following analytical expression for an ABP (Fig. S2).44\n\u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a = 6Dt\u03c4 +\n2F2a\u03c4R \u03b32\n[ \u03c4 + \u03c4R ( e\u2212 \u03c4 \u03c4R \u22121 )] (12)\nHere Dt is the thermal translational diffusion coefficient, Fa is magnitude of the self-propulsion force and \u03c4R is the persistence time defined as \u03c4R = 1\n2Dr , where Dr is the ther-\nmal rotational diffusion coefficient. Therefore, one expects\u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a \u2248 6Dt\u03c4 for \u03c4 < \u03c4R, \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a = 6Dt\u03c4 + ( 2F2a e\u03b32 ) \u03c42 for\n\u03c4 ' \u03c4R, and \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a = (6Dt + 2F2a\u03c4R \u03b32 )\u03c4 for \u03c4 > \u03c4R (Fig. S2).\nThereafter, to investigate the effect of crowding on the dynamics of the tracer particle we compute \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a and time\nexponent \u03b1(\u03c4) defined as \u03b1(\u03c4) = dlog\n(\u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a) dlog(\u03c4) . First,\nwe consider the following set of parameters, \u03c3 = 1.0 (comparable to the mesh size) and k = 10 with varying Fa. We observe that the self-propulsion always leads to faster dynamics with increasing Fa, as evident from the plot of trajectories\nin three-dimension shown in Fig. 2A. The plots of \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a\nagainst \u03c4 in log-log scale and corresponding time exponents \u03b1(\u03c4) in log-linear scale shown in Fig. 2(B, C), respectively. For a very short time, the dynamics is almost normally diffusive (\u03b1(\u03c4) \u2248 1.0). The motion of tracer crosses over from the diffusive to subdiffusive (\u03b1(\u03c4)< 1) in slightly longer time scales when the active force is not high enough (Fa = 100). The subdiffusive behaviour is more pronounced for the passive case (Fa = 0) at the intermediate time. It is due to the confined motion inside the polymer mesh created by the surrounded monomers of the gel (Movie S1). Whereas, the active tracer makes a transition from subdiffusive to superdiffusive (\u03b1(\u03c4) > 1) motion from short to moderate time scale. This happens since the self-propulsion always helps the tracer to move from one mesh to another mesh and the tracer performs a persistent motion for a while, leading to superdiffusion (\u03b1(\u03c4)> 1) (Movie S2). There is competition between the confinement in the the polymer network, leading to subdiffusion, and the persistent motion of the active tracer, resulting superdiffusive dynamics. For very high activity (Fa = 100), the dynamics always transform from diffusive to superdiffusive in short to intermediate time scales, which indicates that the activity dominates over the cage effect. \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a of the\nself-propelled tracer particle grows faster with Fa, as demonstrated in Fig. 2B. In the long time, the direction of the selfpropulsion gets randomized due to the collisions and the particle undergoes a random walk that leads to a diffusive (\u03b1 \u2248 1) motion of the tracer and \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a becomes linear in time with\nan enhanced diffusion coefficient.\nFurther, we inspect the anomalous diffusion of the passive and active tracers in the polymer network by changing the tracer size \u03c3 = 0.5\u22121.5, keeping k and Fa constant. For the passive case, tracer particles with the smaller size \u03c3 = 0.5 than mesh size can pass through the cages easily without being much interrupted by the obstacles and the dynamics found weakly subdiffusive (\u03b1 \u223c 0.7), while tracer with the bigger size (\u03c3 = 1.5) than mesh size are transiently trapped inside the cages and \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a shows strong subdiffusion (\u03b1 \u223c 0.5)\nmotion at the intermediate time (Fig. 3A). It is expected that the effect of confinement becomes more profound on increasing the tracer size and due to that, the motion of the tracer slows down leading to strong subdiffusive behavior (Movie S3). MSD plots in Fig. 3A display that the curve for a relatively bigger tracer always lies below that for a smaller one throughout. A similar trend is observed in Fig. 3B for an active tracer (Fa = 50). For this high activity, (Fa = 50), a tracer with the smaller size \u03c3 = 0.5 always undergoes a superdiffusive regime before achieving the normal diffusion regime like an ABP in free space. Note that in case of a relatively bigger tracer, the time exponent \u03b1(\u03c4) first decreases to a value of \u03b1(\u03c4)\u223c 0.85, indicating a subdiffusive behavior, then increases to the value of \u03b1(\u03c4)\u223c 1.7, implying a superdiffusive regime. The subdiffusion behaviour of the probe with the larger size \u03c3 = 1.5 is more pronounced than the relatively smaller probe \u03c3 = 1.0 (Fig. 3C) in short time scales. The\n5 A\nB C\nFig. 2.

As time progresses, the tracer particle starts to feel the effect of the activity, and comes out from the cage, leading to the increase of \u03b1(\u03c4) (Movie S4). More interestingly, careful observation indicates that superdiffusion with the larger value of \u03b1(\u03c4) in case of bigger tracers, as depicted in Fig. 3C. As we discussed in Section II, the rotational diffusion coefficient Dr scales as \u03c3\u22123 for an ABP and the persistence time defines by \u03c4R = 2Dr\u22121, which implies that the rotation becomes harder for bigger particle and therefore, it moves more persistently along a direction as the tracer gets larger size.44,45 In Fig. 4(A,B), we quantify \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a\nof the passive and active tracers by changing the stiffness (k) of the polymer network for tracer with diameters \u03c3 = 0.5 and 1.5. On increasing the value of k, the particles of the polymer network become less mobile and form nearly static meshes, which suppresses the motion of the passive tracer particles. From Fig. 4A we notice that the effect of k is more significant for a bigger (\u03c3 = 1.5) tracer in comparison to the smaller one (\u03c3 = 0.5) since a particle with a smaller size can escape from the meshes easily, while the bigger particles are tightly placed inside the meshes and transiently trapped. It is noticeable that at a very\nhigh value of k, the exponent \u03b1 approaches a value of 0.45. On the other hand, self-propulsion always promotes the motion of active tracer to explore larger volume that too persistently inside the polymer network. Therefore, \u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a of the\nself-propelled tracers grow faster with Fa, as demonstrated in Fig. 4B. Interestingly, for higher activity (Fa = 50), the selfpropulsion controls the dynamics of the tracer and washes out the effect of network stiffness, leading to the overlapping of\u2329\n\u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a\ncorresponding to different values of k (Fig. 4B). Consequently, to measure the degree of subdiffusion and superdiffusion, we calculate the anomalous diffusion exponent \u03b1{sub, sup} as a function of Fa, as presented in Fig. 4C, where \u03b1sub and \u03b1sup are the minimum and maximum values of \u03b1(\u03c4) for subdiffusion (\u03b1(\u03c4)< 1) and superdiffusion (\u03b1(\u03c4)> 1) dynamics, respectively. In Fig. 4C, we see that \u03b1{sub, sup} increase with Fa since self-propulsion reduces the subdiffusion (\u03b1(\u03c4) increases) and enhances the superdiffusion. For bigger tracers, initially one sees strong subdiffusion, owing to its tight motion inside the mesh. However, eventually selfpropulsion takes over as the time progresses and dynamics becomes strongly superdiffusive. This is essentially due to the fact that the persistence time scales linearly with the volume of the tracer. We also report that both \u03b1sub and \u03b1sup decrease on\n6 A\nB C\nFig. 3. Log-log plot of\n\u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a\nvs \u03c4 of the (A) passive (Fa = 0) and (B) active (Fa = 50) sticky self-propelled tracer (\u03b5 = 2.0) for different\nvalues of \u03c3 = 0.5,1.0,1.5 at fixed k = 10. Log-linear plot of (C) \u03b1(\u03c4) vs \u03c4 of the plot (B).\nincreasing k. One can clearly see that the differences between the values of \u03b1sub and \u03b1sup, corresponding to different values of k are more profound for passive and weakly active tracers. On the other hand, values are extremely close for highly active tracers (large Fa). Thus, for the highly active tracers, the stiffness of the network does not control the dynamics, rather the activity does.\nRole of self-propulsion in assisting the escape of the tracer particles from the traps, created by the polymer network becomes visible in case of highly sticky tracer (\u03b5 = 4). If the tracer is passive and has strong affinity towards the polymer beads (\u03b5 = 4), a strong subdiffusion is observed with a lowest possible value \u03b1(\u03c4) = 0.5 (Fig. S3A). While if the tracer is self-propelled (Fa = 50), the value of minimum subdiffusive \u03b1(\u03c4) increases to 0.77 and a strong superdiffusion with \u03b1 = 1.52 at later time (Fig. S3B). On the other hand, for the non-sticky tracer interacting with the network monomers via repulsive WCA potential the dynamics is weakly subdiffusive (Fig. S3A) for the passive tracer and for the active tracer it is highly superdiffusive (Fig. S3B).\nIn typical single particle tracking experiments, one way to quantify the dynamics of the tracer is to construct of the tracer\u2019s van-Hove correlation or the displacement distribution from its recorded trajectories.17,69\u201371 From our simulations, we also compute the self part of the van-Hove correlation function (displacement probability distribution function). We compute it for one dimension (computing the same for three dimension is straightforward), which is defined as follows, P(\u2206x;\u03c4) \u2261 \u3008\u03b4 (\u2206x\u2212 (x(t + \u03c4)\u2212 x(t)))\u3009, where x(t + \u03c4) and x(t) are the positions of the tracer along the x direction at time (t + \u03c4) and t, respectively. Here, P(\u2206x;\u03c4) is essentially the histogram obtained from several independent trajectories. Thus, the distributions of the displacements are time-and-ensemble averaged. In Fig. 5, we report P(\u2206x;\u03c4) of the tracer with \u03c3 =1.0 inside the network having k = 10 for different values of Fa. We also depict trial fittings of these van-Hove distributions with a Gaussian distribution, Pg(\u2206x;\u03c4) = 1\u221a 2\u03c0\u3008\u2206x2\u3009 exp ( \u2212 \u2206x2 2\u3008\u2206x2\u3009 ) . Therefore, any deviation of the van-Hove distributions from the Gaussian curves indicates non-Gaussianity. Please note that here \u2329 \u2206x2 \u232a in\n7 A B\nC\nFig. 4. Log-log plots of\n\u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a\nvs \u03c4 of the (A) passive (Fa = 0) and (B) active (Fa = 50) sticky self-propelled tracer (\u03b5 = 2.0) for different\nvalues of k = 5, 15, 30, and \u03c3 = 0.5,1.5. Plot of (C) \u03b1{sub, sup} vs Fa: subdiffusion (\u03b1sub) and superdiffusion (\u03b1sup) exponents are represented below and above the dashed-line (\u03b1 = 1) respectively, for \u03c3 = 0.5,1.5, and k = 5, 15.\nPg(\u2206x;\u03c4) is also a fitting parameter and does not necessarily represent the actual variance for the tracer concerned. At short time (\u03c4 = 5) for the passive and weakly active tracer (Fa = 25), the distribution curves overlap but for higher values of Fa = 50,500, P(\u2206x;\u03c4)s become broader, which accounts for the larger displacement of the tracer inside the polymer network (Fig. 5A). As the time progresses, P(\u2206x;\u03c4) broaden further with increasing Fa, as displayed in Fig. 5(B-C). These van-Hove are not only broad but also flat over a length scale \u223c \u22123\u03c3 to +3\u03c3 for Fa = 100 at \u03c4 = 50 and \u221225\u03c3 to +25\u03c3 for \u03c4 = 500. This indicates that at higher self-propulsion the tracer moves between the meshes without getting trapped. In other words, shorter and larger displacements become equally probable. In addition, it can also be seen from the plots that the deviation from Gaussianity is more pronounced at the intermediate time. For very short or long time, the deviations are less. This is essentially due the local heterogeneity of the medium which washes out in the long time for passive or weakly active tracers. However, for a strongly active tracer (say Fa = 100) van-Hove distribution is broad and flat, even\nin the long time limit. Flattening of the van-Hove distribution in this case indicates that at such higher self-propulsion, the tracer moves like a free persistent walker over a wide length scale. We also evaluate the full-width half maxima (FWHM) of van-Hove distributions to examine the effects of tracer size \u03c3 and stiffness k of the polymer network on the P(\u2206x;\u03c4) for a range of active forces, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Higher the activity, broaden the curves are. FWHM always increases with increasing Fa. On the other hand, with increasing k and \u03c3 , P(\u2206x;\u03c4) becomes narrower, reflecting confined motion. Apart from this, the non-sticky tracers move faster than the sticky ones due to the repulsive interactions between the tracer and the gel particles, which results broader displacement distributions. On the other hand, P(\u2206x;\u03c4) becomes narrower with increase in the binding affinity of the tracer towards the polymer network (Fig. S4A). In the case of active tracer (Fa = 50), the distribution curves are relatively broader and the differences are small (Fig. S4B). This indicates that the effect of stickiness becomes insignificant on increasing the self-propulsion.\n8"

            "text": "Motivated by the phenomena of transport of biomolecules, bacteria and synthetic nanomotors through mesh-like environments, such as mucus membrane, nuclear pore complex, porous media,1,4,13,28,29,31,47,72 we use computer simulations to elucidate the mechanism of transport of active tracers through a model polymer network, created on a diamond lattice. Our results show that the dynamics of tracer particle always gets enhanced on switching on and increasing the self-propulsion force or activity. We have found that the dynamics of the passive tracer is always subdiffusive at an intermediate time, whereas the self-propelled tracer exhibits a transition from a short-time subdiffusion to an intermediatetime superdiffusion. In the absence of activity, the particle is confined inside the mesh, especially when comparable to or bigger than the mesh size. This leads to subdiffusion for a short time, but due to the self-propulsion, the particle escapes from its caged motion and exhibits superdiffusion in the relatively longer time. This transition between subdiffusion and superdiffusion thus can be attributed to the competition between the confined motion of the tracer due to its size and sticky interaction with the mesh particles and the self-propulsion it possesses. The persistence motion of the self-propelled particle increases with its size, as the persistence time for an active Brownian particle scales linearly with its volume. Therefore, a bigger tracer has a higher value of \u03b1(\u03c4) than the smaller one. Additionally, we found that the effect of the polymer stiffness is more profound in the case of a bigger particle as the smaller one can travel between the meshes without feeling the network. But on increasing the stiffness of the network, the dynamics of the monomers of the network slows down and suppresses the motion of tracers, comparable to or bigger than the average mesh size. This leads to a substantial decline in the value of \u03b1(\u03c4). At very high activity, e.g. Fa = 100, the persistent motion dominates, short-time subdiffusion disappears and the particle switches over gradually from diffusive to superdiffusive motion. To achieve a deeper understanding of the transport process, we also investigated the van-Hove correlation function and found that the distribution increasingly becomes broader with increasing Fa, implying a larger displacement of the active tracer with increasing activity. Especially, in the case of higher activity (Fa = 100), displacement distribution displays a broad and flat regime at an intermediate time, which might be the consequence of the larger persistence length of the tracer. Surprisingly, the displacement distributions deviate significantly from Gaussianity at higher self-propulsion, even at relatively longer time, indicating unrestricted transport of the tracer inside the network. In a future work, we plan to extend our current study to include asymmetrical self-propelled particles. We expect that our findings can be useful in understanding the mechanism of transport of active agents, such as bacteria, self-powered nano/micro devices in mesh-like complex environments."

The time-averaged mean-squared displacement (\u2329 \u2206r2(\u03c4) \u232a) is calculated.
