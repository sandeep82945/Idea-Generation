            "text": "Due to their mature processing technology and extensive application, lithium-ion batteries have played an important role in mobile energy storage since their commercialization.1 Especially in the last decade, the development of electric vehicles has further promoted the demand for lithium-ion batteries, and also put forward higher requirements for their energy density. However, the energy density of lithium-ion batteries is approaching the theoretical maximum, which is ultimately determined by the intercalation reaction mechanism. Among various alternatives, lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries based on a sulfur redox conversion mechanism have obvious advantages, including much lower cost, higher gravimetric/volumetric energy densities (2500 W h kg\u22121/2800 W h L\u22121) and environmental friendliness.2,3 Thus, they have attracted considerable\nfor Additive Manufacturing, Qingdao\nChina.

In practice, however, several challenges seriously hinder the practical use of Li\u2013S batteries, including poor ionic/electronic conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulde (Li2S),4 shuttle behaviors of lithium polysuldes (LiPSs)5 and safety risk of Li metal anode.6 These problems greatly reduce the battery cycle life and sulfur utilization. In addition, the redox conversion of sulfur species is kinetically tardy, which not only further aggravates the shuttle effect, but also causes large amounts of deactivated \u201cdead sulfur\u201d.7,8\nCarbon materials are oen used as sulfur hosts to tackle the above intrinsic shortcomings of the sulfur cathode, due to their diversied pore structure, high conductivity and high electrochemical stability.9\u201312 Among them, hollow carbon sphere is an earlier proposed sulfur host.13,14 Its large cavity can effectively encapsulate large amounts of sulfur and buffer its volume changes. Besides, the carbon shell acts as a physical barrier to prevent the direct contact between sulfur and bulk electrolyte, and further conne the produced LiPSs. However, the non-polar carbon surface has a poor affinity with the sulfur species.15\u201317 The dissolved LiPSs will still gradually diffuse out from the hollow cavity of carbon in the long cycle process, and cause the parasitic shuttle effect.18 Therefore, imparting sulphilic property to the carbon surface to enhance the interaction between carbon-based hosts and sulfur species is necessary. According to previous literature reports, polar transition metal compounds can chemically immobilize dissolved sulfur species and improve the stability of the sulfur cathode, such as metal oxides,19 metal carbides,20 metal phosphides,21 metal suldes14,22 and metal nitrides.23,24 More importantly, some compounds show obvious catalytic activity on the sulfur redox conversion, which could accelerate the conversion of sulfur\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In our previous study,15 necklace-like molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoparticles were used to modify the carbon ber network to obtain a sulphilic 3D carbon collector. The fabricated sulfur cathode with a sulfur loading of 10 mg cm\u22122 delivered an ultra-high areal capacity of 12.3 mA h cm\u22122 at 0.1C. Nevertheless, the preparation process of metal carbides usually requires high temperature treatment. Due to inhomogeneous carburization and inevitable high-temperature aggregation, the obtained carbides tend to be large and irregular particles.31 The resulting limited active sulphilic sites greatly decreases their chemisorption and catalytic ability. Another concern is the interfacial bonding between the carbide catalyst and the carbon. Poor interfacial binding greatly deteriorates interfacial electron transfer, further affecting the catalytic activity. Therefore, in the Li\u2013S battery application, there is an urgent need to develop a convenient method for preparing a carbon-based sulfur host with uniformly dispersed and tightly coupled carbide nanoparticles.\nIn this work, nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres strongly coupled with molybdenum carbide nanocrystals (MoC@N-HCS) were prepared by a simple metal chelate-assisted polymerization and heat treatment. When used as the sulfur host, this purposefully designed MoC@N-HCS has the following advantages: (1) the carbon shell is composed of a large number of carbon sheets, which increases the specic surface area and the active sites; (2) solid-state thermal reaction is a common but effective method to prepare carbon/carbide composites. The carbon produced by dopamine plays a role in limiting the growth of MoC, realizing its ultra-small size and high dispersion. The close coupling between MoC and conductive carbon enhances their interface electron transfer; (3) MoC nanocrystals have high conductivity and sulfur affinity, which can chemically adsorb LiPSs and catalyze their redox conversion. Combined with the hollow carbon structure, the shuttle effect can be effectively inhibited. As a result, the Li\u2013S batteries with these intimately coupled MoC@N-HCS hosts show a reduced charge/ discharge polarization, and deliver a decent rate capability of 566 mA h g\u22121 at 2C and long cycle stability over 300 cycles at 1C."

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 1, MoC@N-HCS is synthesized through a simple metal chelate-assisted polymerization method. First, a metal chelation reaction between the Mo7O24\n6\u2212 anion and dopamine hydrochloride happened in the water/ethanol solution, forming the chelates. Then, the mixed solvent produced water phase/organic phase micelles during the stirring process and the chelates polymerized along the micellar surface in a weakly alkaline environment. A hollow Mo-PDA spherical structure with the lamellar shell was formed (Fig. S1a and b\u2020). This resulting precursor spheres were thermally treated at 700 \u00b0 C to produce MoOx@N-HCS spheres. To adjust the content of MoC in the nal product appropriately and increase the sulfur storage sites, partial MoOx was dissolved and removed using concentrated hydrochloric acid. Aer pickling, the samples were further heat treated in a reducing atmosphere (10%H2/Ar). MoOx reacted with carbon to produce MoC nanoparticles. Due to the in situ and conned reaction in the carbon matrix, the obtained MoC has an ultra-small size and a uniform distribution, leading to the high exposure of sulphilic sites. Additionally, the conductive carbon nanosheets in the shell and the\n20812 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20810\u201320815\nnanocrystals have extremely intimate coupled interactions, realizing rapid electron migration between the interface. When used as a sulfur host, MoC@N-HCS hollow sphere can collaboratively achieve physical connement, chemisorption, and catalytic conversion towards LiPSs. In order to verify the importance of metal chelate in the polymerization process, we polymerized and carbonized dopamine under the same condition only without the addition of (NH4)6Mo7O24$4H2O. The resulting product is the solid carbon spheres with a diameter of 200\u2013300 nm (Fig. S3\u2020), which is used as a comparison sample for subsequent electrochemical tests.\nThe phase and component contents of the nal products were characterized and determined by XRD and TGA. As shown in Fig. 2a, except for the characteristic peak of carbon at 24.5\u00b0, several obvious peaks at 36.6, 39.3, 42.4, 61.7 and 74.4 are observed, corresponding to the (1 0 2), (1 0 3), (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6) planes of hexagonal h-MoC phase (JCPDS Card no. 89- 4305).32 The TGA curve is shown in Fig. 2b. Before 320 \u00b0C, the increase in mass is attributed to the conversion of MoC to molybdenum oxide in the air. Above 320 \u00b0C, carbon materials are oxidized in air and the mass is rapidly reduced. At 450 \u00b0C, the residual mass fraction is 50.8 wt%. Therefore, the content of MoC in the sample is 38.1 wt%. The N2 adsorption isotherm (Fig. 2c) recorded on MoC@N-HCS resembles type I and IV isotherm and a H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of adequate micropores and mesopores.33 The specic surface area of MoC@N-HCS based on the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller method was calculated to be 201 m2 g\u22121. The high specic surface area provides sufficient active sites for the adsorption of LiPSs. Fig. S4b\u2020 shows that the pore diameter of micropores and mesopores mainly concentrated in 1 nm and 5.6\u201312.9 nm.\nSEM images of the MoC/N-HCS show that the ower-like structure of Mo-PDA precursor was largely maintained aer twice annealing (Fig. 2d, e and S1a\u2020).

TEM image (Fig. 2f) further shows the internal structure of the carbon sphere more clearly, including the hollow carbon cavities and the carbon shell composed of carbon sheets. More importantly, lots of molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are homogeneously incorporated into the carbon sheet. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2g) conrms that the nanoparticle with high crystallinity has an ultra-small size of \u223c2 nm. The lattice fringe with a spacing of 0.21 nm is attributed to the (104) crystal facet of the MoC. Fig. 2h\u2013l further characterize the distribution of MoC on the surface of the carbon sphere. Elements carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and molybdenum are all consistent with the morphology of MoC@N-HCS hollow spheres in STEM images, indicating that MoC is evenly distributed in the entire spherical shell. The element oxygen comes from the amorphous oxide layer formed due to the oxidation of MoC in the air. The formed Mo\u2013O\u2013C like species may help to activate surface Mo sites for chemically binding dissolved LiPSs.21 The same conclusion can be obtained from the element line scanning of MoC@N-HCS (Fig. S2\u2020).\nThe sulfur is impregnated into MoC@N-HCS by the classical melt-diffusion process, and the mass fraction of sulfur in the composite is 68.2 wt% (Fig. 3a). The microstructure of the MoC@N-HCS/S composite was observed. As shown in Fig. S4,\u2020 the composite still maintains the original ower-like shape of MoC@N-HCS, and there is no obvious sulfur agglomeration, indicating that all sulfur is fully diffused into the shell and hollow cavity of MoC@N-HCS. To further investigate the sulfur distribution within the as-synthesized MoC@N-HCS, EDS analysis (Fig. 3b\u2013f) demonstrates that sulfur was homogeneously distributed within MoC@N-HCS. In this case, sulfur and MoC particles are evenly and fully combined. Aer sulfur loading, the specic surface area decreases to 3.4 m2 g\u22121 (Fig. S5a\u2020), and the original micropores and mesoporous pores disappeared (Fig. S5b\u2020), indicating that these pores were completely lled with sulfur.\nThe obtained MoC@N-HCS/S composite was mixed with Super P and binder to prepare sulfur cathode. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves are shown in Fig. 4a. During the cathodic scan from 2.8 to 1.7 V, two well-dened reduction peaks appear\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nat 2.25 and 1.96 V, corresponding to the generation of longchain LiPSs (Li2Sn, 4 # n # 8) and the reduction of long-chain LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S, respectively. In the subsequent anodic scan, two oxidation peaks occurred at 2.39 and 2.45 V, which corresponds to the reversible oxidation of Li2S and the nal conversion of long-chain LiPSs into sulfur.34,35Notably, there are no obvious current or potential changes of these reduction/ oxidation peaks in the rst three scans and the obtained curves are highly overlapped, proving superior reversibility and stability of the cell.36 Cycle and rate performance MoC@N-HCS/ S and N-CS/S are shown in Fig. 4b and c. The initial specic capacity of MoC@N-HCS/S at 0.3C reaches 985 mA h g\u22121, and the residual capacity aer 50 cycles is 699 mA h g\u22121, both of which are much higher than those of N-CS/S. Meanwhile, MoC@N-HCS/S delivers discharge specic capacities of 1193, 908, 799, 657 and 566 mA h g\u22121 at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 2C, respectively. In contrast, the specic capacities of N-CS/S at the above discharge rate are only 721.8, 491.3, 416.5, 289.4, 184.9 mA h g\u22121. The excellent cycle and rate performance are attributed to two points. On the one hand, MoC@N-HCS has a hollow structure, which can effectively store sulfur and buffer the volume expansion during the charge\u2013discharge process. On the other hand, the ultra-small molybdenum carbide nanoparticles enable the sulphilic surface of the carbon shell, realizing the effective strong chemical anchoring and fast redox conversion of LiPSs.\nFig. 4d and e show the charge\u2013discharge curves of N-CS/S and MoC@N-HCS/S at different rates. Results show that the corresponding discharge curves of MoC@N-HCS/S at all rates show two obvious platforms, while the second discharge platform of N-CS/S disappears at 2C. As shown in Fig. 4f, the polarization voltages of the charge\u2013discharge curves are analyzed and compared. It is found that the polarization of\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20810\u201320815 | 20813\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In addition, the discharge curve is divided into high-voltage platform capacity and low-voltage platform capacity. The ratio of low-voltage platform capacity to highvoltage platform capacity reects whether the long-chain LiPSs generated in the rst step can be further utilized effectively. As shown in Fig. 4g, the ratios of MoC@N-HCS/S cathode are higher than those of N-CS/S at all current densities. The above results indicate that the cavity structure not only stores sulfur, but also achieves physical connement for sulfur and its discharge products. MoC nanoparticles incorporated in the shell can chemically adsorb dissolved LiPSs and catalyze their rapid and full conversion to Li2S2/Li2S. In contrast, N-CS has a non-hollow structure, which is lack of sufficient storage space and reaction sites for generated LiPSs during the discharge/ charge process, leading to sluggish LiPS conversion and the serious shuttle phenomenon. Fig. 4h shows that the cell assembled with MoC@N-HCS/S cell exhibits good long-cycle stability. At 1C, the cell delivers an initial specic discharge capacity of 783 mA h g\u22121 and a remaining capacity of 472 mA h g\u22121 aer 300 cycles.\nMoC nanoparticles enhances the sulfur affinity of the carbon interface. To verify this, MoC@N-HCS was added to the Li2S6 solution for the chemical adsorption test. Nanocarbon materials commonly used in laboratories, rGO and Super P, are used as control samples. As shown in Fig. 5a\u2013d, aer resting for 12 h, the Li2S6 solution with MoC@N-HCS becomes almost completely colorless and transparent, while the solution with rGO or Super P is still light yellowish green. The corresponding UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S6\u2020) further proves that the LiPS concentration of the supernatant solutions with\nFig. 5 Digital images of the Li2S6 captured by different materials: (a) Li2S6 solution, (b) rGO + Li2S6 solution, (c) Super P + Li2S6 solution and (d) MoC@N-HCS + Li2S6 solution.

This result indicates that MoC@N-HCS has stronger chemical adsorption ability towards LiPSs, and more Li2S6 is chemically anchored to the surface of the MoC@N-HCS.37,38 To more deeply study the interaction between the embedded MoC nanoparticles and LiPSs, the samples before and aer the adsorption of Li2S6 were tested by XPS. Fig. 5e shows the full spectrum of elements before LiPS adsorption, and the sample contains O 1s, N 1s, C 1s and Mo 3d peaks. Aer LiPS adsorption, the S 2p peak appears at 162.6 eV,39 which indicates that LiPSs are strongly adsorbed on the MoC surface. In Mo 3d ne spectrum (Fig. 5f), Mo\u2013O and Mo\u2013C bonds are mainly included. Aer the adsorption of LiPSs (Fig. 5g), Mo\u2013S bonds appear at the positions of 229.9 eV and 233.9 eV, conrming the chemical interaction between MoC nanoparticles and Li2S6.40 Based on the above discussion results, the working principle diagram of MoC@N-HCS as a high efficient sulfur host is shown in Fig. 5h. Hollow carbon spheres have large cavities that provide storage space for active materials and also physically conne dissolved LiPSs. MoC nanocrystals closely coupled with the carbon sheets function as sulphilic sites, which chemical adsorb LiPSs, and catalyze their rapid redox transformation. More critically, the growth of MoC is limited by carbon substrate based on unique metal chelate-assisted polymerization and solid phase heat treatment method. Its high dispersion and ultra-small particle size further maximize its chemisorption and catalytic capability. Therefore, the resulting sulphilic hollow carbon spheres exhibit the above excellent electrochemical properties."

            "text": "In this work, a hierarchical carbon hollow sphere with embedded ultra-small molybdenum carbide nanoparticles was prepared by a metal chelate-assisted polymerization method. The obtained MoC@N-HCS as the sulfur host shows multiple advantages. The large cavity provides sufficient space for sulfur storage and physically prevents the outward diffusion of discharge products. More importantly, conductive MoC nanoparticles with ultra-small size and uniform distribution are intimately coupled with the carbon, making carbon surface sulphilic. Dissolved LiPSs are chemically anchored onto these MoC sites and undergo a rapid redox transformation. Based on the synergistic coupling of the above multiple functions, Li\u2013S cells with the MoC@N-HCS/S cathodes show excellent rate performance (566 mA h g\u22121, 2C) and cycle stability (300 cycles, 1C)."
