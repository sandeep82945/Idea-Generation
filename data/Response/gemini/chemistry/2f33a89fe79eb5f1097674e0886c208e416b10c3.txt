1. **Investigate the relationship between the metabolic differences and the pharmacological effects of different tissues of LJT.** This could be done by conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the biological activities of extracts from each tissue.
2. **Identify the key enzymes and genes involved in the biosynthesis of the major active components in LJT.** This could be done by using transcriptomics and proteomics approaches to compare the expression of genes and proteins in different tissues.
3. **Develop new methods for the extraction and isolation of the major active components from LJT.** This could involve optimizing existing methods or developing new ones that are more efficient and selective.
4. **Investigate the potential of using LJT extracts as a natural source of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents.** This could be done by conducting studies to assess the ability of LJT extracts to protect against oxidative stress and inflammation in vitro and in vivo.
5. **Explore the potential of using LJT extracts as a natural source of antimicrobial agents.** This could be done by conducting studies to assess the ability of LJT extracts to inhibit the growth of bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
