    "abstractText": "Background Due to the persistence of tobacco-related health disparities in the U.S., there is a need for innovative strategies to reach the underserved ethnic minority populations who are most at risk. As contemplations for health behavior modification tend to surge on Mondays, we explored the feasibility and effect of a Monday-enhanced smoking cessation program on quitting outcomes in a low-income ethnic minority community. Aims To compare a Monday-enhanced with a standard Communities Engaged and Advocating for a Smoke-free Environment (CEASE) program and understand the overall experiences of participants in the program. Methods In this mixed-methods study, affordable housing complexes (n = 4) and a church were randomly assigned either a Monday-enhanced (n = 3) or standard (n = 2) CEASE smoking cessation program. CEASE comprised twelve weekly group counseling sessions facilitated by trained peer motivators plus nicotine replacement products. Participants in the Mondayenhanced arm were encouraged to pick Mondays as a quitting day. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during the program and at 3-month post-graduation. Results Seventy-seven participants were enrolled in the study arms. In both groups combined, tobacco consumption reduced from 7.7 to 5.6 cig/day (mean reduction, 2.1; 95% CI: 0.9 to 5.1, p = 0.08). Although no significant difference in quit rate was observed between the two arms, more participants completed the follow-up survey in the Monday-enhanced than standard CEASE program [82.4% vs. 36.0%, p < 0.05]. While qualitative data suggested an overall satisfaction of participants with the program, motivation for quitting was higher in the Monday-enhanced CEASE program compared to the standard CEASE program. Conclusion The Monday-enhanced program is promising and may enhance participants\u2019 engagement and willingness to quit smoking, particularly in low-income ethnic minority communities. Further research should include larger sample sizes to better assess the efficacy of a Monday-enhanced program across diverse populations.",

            "text": "Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States (U.S.) [1]. In addition to the direct human costs, each year, smoking puts a significant financial burden on the healthcare system: cigarette smoking cost the U.S. over $600 billion in 2018 including over $240 billion in healthcare spending and almost $372 in lost productivitiy [1]. Despite significant gains made in\nreducing smoking prevalence over the past decades, there are still persistent and large disparities in tobacco use and associated health problems in certain racial, ethnic, and low socioeconomic status populations. Compared to the general U.S. adult population, the rate of cigarette smoking is higher in individuals who live below the poverty level and have lower levels of educational attainment [2, 3]. Racial and ethnic minority residents of assisted public housing living in inner cities are also among the most vulnerable populations for tobacco disparities. [1] In addition to lower access to treatment and higher stigma, predatory targeting by the tobacco industry has contributed to the existing tobacco disparities in the United States [4, 5]. * Shervin Assari assari@umich.edu Extended author information available on the last page of the article\n1 3\nA large body of evidence indicates that smoking cessation is a cost-effective health intervention [6]. Evidence-based smoking cessation interventions include behavioral modifications administered at the individual, group, or remote settings and approved pharmacotherapies. Studies show that several treatment methods are effective even if used alone, but the largest cessation rates are obtained by the combined use of both behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapies [7\u201312]. Group behavioral therapy and group counseling have been shown to be more effective in helping individuals to quit smoking than self-help and other less intensive interventions [13]. In a group therapy setting, a smoker gains benefits from behavioral techniques (i.e., modeling and reinforcement), from the mutual support and having a sense of belonging [14].\nTemporal landmarks, especially those that signal new beginnings (e.g., the New Year, first day of the month or week), encourage goal initiation and bolster individuals\u2019 motivation in pursuing their aspiration to implement behavioral changes. It is suggested that these landmarks may bring psychological disassociation from the individual\u2019s perceived imperfect self-image in the past [15]. A survey of Google Search queries conducted during 2005\u20132012 that included the word \u201chealthy\u201d and were classified as health-related by Google showed healthy searches peaked on Mondays and Tuesdays thereafter, declining until recovering modestly on Sundays. This finding suggested a so-called weekly clock for healthy contemplations [16].\nObserving these weekly rhythms, researchers have postulated that behavioral interventions such as smoking cessation programs could benefit from targeting those specific days when people are most interested in behavior change. Such a strategy would require adapting health programs to coincide with those days of the week [16]. There is, however, limited research on using these temporal landmarks, specifically Mondays, in tobacco cessation interventions. One study showed an increased self-efficacy to quit in an intervention arm using Monday as a day to quit or recommit to quitting smoking [17]. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence for this phenomenon and encourage using this concept in smoking cessation interventions."

CEASE mainly focuses on underserved and low-income populations that lack affordable, consistent, or accessible community healthrelated resources [18, 24]. The CEASE initiative from 2002, working through the Prevention Sciences Research Center (PSRC) of Morgan State University and several collaborative partnerships with the local communities, has implemented four phases of tobacco cessation programs serving several thousand residents in Baltimore City with the emergence of a tobacco cessation curriculum tailored to the underserved urban population.\nThe standard intervention included holding 12 weekly smoking cessation group counseling sessions for current smokers (study participants). These sessions were held on weekdays other than Mondays. Community members, called peer motivators, who were former smokers, were trained in counseling techniques, motivational interviewing, delivering the 12-week smoking cessation intervention, and principles of human subjects research ethics [25]. Peer motivator support and guidance were provided according to the CEASE Today tobacco cessation curriculum using a manual which comprised three modules: (i) motivation and preparation, delivered over 3\u00a0weeks; (ii) planning to quit, delivered over 6\u00a0weeks; and (iii) relapse prevention, delivered in 3\u00a0weeks [26]. The manual also had activities aligned with each module for engaging the participants. Training on the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products (patches, lozenges, and gum), provision of free NRT samples, and directions on how to get free additional supplies from the state Quit Line were provided by the peer motivators.\n1 3"

TMC is a non-profit collaborative public health initiative that promotes sustainable behavior change by dedicating every Monday to health. The program has been associated with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, and NYU Langone Health. It encompasses various health-oriented programs, including Quit and Stay Quit Monday (QSQM), Meatless Monday, Move it Monday, Destress Monday, The Kids Cook Monday, and Caregiver Monday [27]. As part of The Monday Campaigns, QSQM uses Monday to check in on an individual's progress with cessation or recommitment to quitting tobacco if that person has relapsed. QSQM is a tobacco cessation tool designed by The Monday Campaigns in collaboration with the Institute for Global Tobacco Control and the Lerner Center for Public Health Promotion at Johns Hopkins University. QSQM encourages people to quit, re-quit or recommit to quit smoking every Monday. Since its inception, various organizations have adopted its module with successful outcomes.\nThe Monday-enhanced CEASE program comprised the components of our standard CEASE program in addition to QSQM practices such as holding classes only on Mondays and asking participants to set their quit days on a Monday. Participants also benefited from QSQM materials and procedures, including Monday check-ins and Monday motivational messages. The Monday check-ins utilized specific questions to assess participants\u2019 performance and efforts to quit smoking during the previous week. The Monday motivational messages were presented in the form of visuals and fliers to motivate participants on various smoking cessationrelated topics. The peer motivators delivered the 12-week Monday-enhanced smoking cessation intervention using the CEASE today manual, the QSQM materials, and procedures.\nA mixed-methods approach was used to compare the effectiveness of the Monday-enhanced CEASE program with the standard CEASE program and to understand the experiences of participants with the program. The study sites were randomized into those using the standard CEASE curriculum or those adopting the Monday-enhanced CEASE curriculum. In the quantitative component, the Mondayenhanced CEASE program was compared with the standard CEASE to test and quantify the benefit of adding the QSQM component to our standard program. The qualitative component utilized focus group discussions (FGDs) and indepth interviews (IDIs) of participants, site coordinators, and peer motivators to understand their experiences with standard CEASE or Monday-enhanced CEASE programs. Their perceptions of the strengths and challenges of the\nprogram and their recommendations for program improvement were also sought."

The COVID19 pandemic resulted in a halt to further site enrollment; therefore, other interested sites could not be included at that point. In each of the five enrolled study sites, site coordinators who were contact persons representing participants at the site acted as a vital link between the peer motivators, the study participants, and the program partnership. Peer motivators and site coordinators established a reliable channel of frequent communication. Site coordinators helped create awareness and disseminate information about the program to their residents. They assisted with the program\u2019s logistics, such as ensuring the provision of meeting space, setting up meeting reminders, and following up with participants on their site. They also relayed feedback from the participants who were their residents to the research team. As the execution of the program coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated imposed lockdowns, the site coordinators played a key role in finding alternative ways to reach the study participants."

Participants who were 21\u00a0years and older and current smokers (smoked at least three cigarettes per day in the past week and have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime) were selected to participate in the program. Pregnant women, those who were not currently smoking or only smoking occasionally, and those deemed mentally impaired were excluded from the program. Those who met the enrollment criteria and provided informed consent were invited to participate in the weekly smoking cessation program administered over 12\u00a0weeks. For current smokers who were not interested in participating in the program, a self-help material (CEASE today tobacco cessation manual), NRT samples and instructions, and a list of available resources for tobacco quitting were offered. Randomization to either the standard or the Monday-enhanced\n1 3\nCEASE program was done at the site level. During the first session, participants completed a baseline survey and had their expired carbon monoxide (CO) levels measured to confirm their current smoking status. During the 12-week program, participants completed weekly progress forms, and 3\u00a0months after completing the program, a follow-up survey was conducted for participants. Quantitative data was collected during enrollment, weekly sessions, and follow-up 3\u00a0months after the program ended.\nIn the qualitative component, FGD subjects were recruited from each of the study sites via phone calls made by the peer motivators, flyers posted on boards or distributed through their communities, or by invitations from the site coordinators. IDIs were held with the program participants and the site coordinators. Participants were compensated with $20 as an appreciation of their time in FGDs and $50 for taking part in the IDIs. FGDs and IDIs were conducted until no significant new information emerged, and the investigators considered the information to be saturated. Three virtual FGDs, with four members per group, were conducted; two with CEASE participants facilitated by peer motivators and one with peer motivators facilitated by research team members. A total of twenty IDIs were held with the program participants facilitated by peer motivators. To avoid any potential bias, peer motivators were assigned to interview participants from sites other than those that they facilitated during the implementation phase of the program."

The primary outcomes of interest for this project at the 12-week post-program follow-up were smoking abstinence and the number of cigarettes smoked. The 12-week follow-up period was determined based on research showing a 6-month period as the consensus for an ideal abstinence and follow-up duration [28, 29]. Participants in our program were allowed to quit upon enrollment into the 12-week program. With a 12-week follow-up period after the program, they would have a total duration of 6\u00a0months to achieve smoking cessation.\nParticipants were categorized as \u201cquit\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t quit\u201d based on smoking abstinence verified by expired-air CO levels at the time of follow-up. A level of \u2264 7\u00a0ppm was considered as an optimal level for \u201cquit,\u201d while > 7\u00a0ppm was considered as \u201cdidn\u2019t quit.\u201d This level was estimated based on other literature, which showed a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 83% when using a cut-off CO level of 6.5\u00a0ppm to assess smoking status. Other studies show varying CO cut-off levels with varying sensitivities and specificities [30\u201332]. Questions measuring participants\u2019 Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (Fagerstr\u00f6m score) were asked at the time of enrollment. The Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine\nDependence (FTND) is a validated standardized smoking assessment for use in smokers. It includes six questions that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption (number of cigarettes smoked per day), the compulsion to use (time it takes after waking up to smoke first cigarette, difficulty in refraining from smoking in places where it is forbidden, cigarette that would be most difficult to give up), and dependence (smoking during the first hours of waking up, smoking even when ill and in bed). On the FTND, the yes/no items are scored 0 or 1 and multiple-choice items are scored from 0 to 3. The questions sum up to a total maximum of 10 points. The higher the points, the greater the nicotine dependence [33, 34]. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to measure breath CO at follow-up; therefore, we relied on participants\u2019 self-report to categorize them into those who \u201cquit\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t quit.\u201d The main independent variable of interest was program type. Participants were categorized as either attending the standard or Monday-enhanced CEASE program. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, including race, age, gender, employment status, marital status, and educational attainment, was collected. Retention, defined as attending six or more of the total twelve smoking cessation classes offered, was determined. Participants were categorized as \u201cnot retained\u201d if they attended fewer than six classes."

Information about the experiences, knowledge, and perceptions of those involved in the CEASE programs, i.e., standard and Monday-enhanced CEASE programs, based on the role they played in the program were obtained through the qualitative assessment. The goal was to compare the experiences of participants in the Monday-enhanced CEASE program with that of participants in the standard CEASE program and also to understand the overall experiences of participants, site coordinators, and peer motivators with the program.\nSeparate FGD and IDI guides were developed for program participants, peer motivators, and site coordinators. Participants\u2019 FGD guide consisted of questions about their experience with the program, program effectiveness, challenges, and recommendations for future programs. The peer motivators\u2019 FGD guide comprised questions that aimed to explore their experiences, feedback on program effectiveness, and their recommendations for future implementation of the program. IDI guides were developed for study participants and the site coordinators. The interview guide\n1 3\nfor participants consisted of questions and probes about their experience from recruitment, their awareness and perceptions of the quitting program and the QSQM concept, their level of satisfaction with the programs, the challenges they encountered, and their recommendations for future program implementation. The site coordinator interview guide included questions and probes about their experience with coordination, program logistics, and perceptions of the relationship between the program and its institution. It also inquired about the challenges, especially those imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and asked for their recommendations.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, interviews were conducted virtually via Zoom\u2019s video communication platform.

The initial codebook for analysis was developed and structured according to the open-ended interview guides used in the study. Two researchers coded each transcript separately and then crosschecked to verify the analysis and form a consensus of the coding for every transcript. Each interview group (CEASE participants, peer motivators, and site coordinators) was analyzed separately for emergent themes, and the data for participants was compared by study arm.

They also expressed that they were pleased to have the program in their communities. As one participant said,\n\u201c\u2026 I know some people do come in because the program is really good. It was very effective.\u201d Another said, \u201c\u2026 I felt like I had more energy, and I could breathe more; better than times when I go out on a walk for maybe fifteen minutes, and I'll be panting.\u201d\nEven though the overall satisfaction with the program was evenly distributed between participants from the standard CEASE and the Monday-enhanced CEASE groups, participants in the Monday-enhanced CEASE group expressed more motivation in quitting or cutting down on smoking than those in the standard CEASE group.\nOn program effectiveness, a large proportion of the participants thought that the program was very effective. One participant said:\n\u201cI really stopped smoking, \u2026 Yes, the activities are relevant to helping us quit.\u201d Others discussed the program\u2019s influence in helping them quit or cut down on smoking: \u201cYes, I haven\u2019t had a cigarette since February 2020.\u201d \u201c... that\u2019s what made me stop for four months.\u201d Some said that the program hugely increased their knowledge of the dangers of smoking and the harmful chemical components of tobacco products. \u201cI learned so much about what the cigarette really is, all the ingredients, what it does to you and just a lot of\ninformation in the booklet.\u201d \u201cShe really taught us a lot of stuff that we didn't know as far as smoking, stop smoking, withdrawal symptoms, and stuff like that so it was a really nice class.\u201d\nParticipants also shared their views on the performance of the peer motivators and provided feedback on the role they played and on the quality of their interactions. In addition, they shared their experiences of having peer support in a group counseling setting.\nParticipants of both groups were equally satisfied with the role that the peer motivators played in helping them quit or reduce their smoking. They said they were taught valuable lessons that helped them towards smoking cessation. Talking about her peer motivator, one participant said:\nWhen my coach came here, she demonstrated different things: we watched videos. We saw pictures. She wrote on the board the things that we needed to know and needed to do.\nTheir comments reflected the effectiveness of the peer motivators and the vital role they played in motivating the participants towards a smoke-free life:\nThe gentleman that did the program with us: He was exceptionally awesome. He was motivating. He was very lovable and I\u2019ll give him the highest regard and respect. The man helped me a great deal.\nOn group support, participants in both groups spoke favorably of the support they received from fellow participants. For instance, they supported one another in punctuality and in regularly attending the classes. They also held one another accountable and persuaded each other to stick to their quitting goals. Interestingly, some participants stated that others\u2019 success challenged them to try and achieve their own quitting goals:\n\u201cWe would look at each other and try to hold each other in a nice way accountable.\u201d \u201cI think it is very effective at the beginning because we all got to meet, we got to learn different things when we\u2019re together.\u201d\nRegarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the program, participants indicated that the pandemic negatively impacted the program\u2019s effectiveness in terms of quitting or cutting down on smoking. However, some blamed the perceived negative impact on the change in the format of the classes from in-person group meetings to group phone calls:\n\u201cDue to COVID, some of the programs have been slowed down. We did not have access to gathering all together\u201d \u201cWell because of the pandemic, and because of how they have the restrictions around here, we don\u2019t see each other that much anymore, and I miss in-person [interactions] that we had in my class\u201d \u201cit was better\n1 3\nwhen it was hands-on[in-person] because I had a better understanding and [the peer motivator] explained the questions to me when I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d\nSome others attributed the change in their smoking behavior to the added anxiety and stress directly or indirectly related to the pandemic:\nOnce the pandemic hit I wasn\u2019t thinking about not smoking; That was the least of my worries because my rental was an amount of money I couldn\u2019t afford, and I was worried about all of those things, so they just made me smoke more because I was stressed.\nSome related their lack of success in quitting smoking to the boredom and inactivity as a result of the lockdown due to the pandemic:\n\u2026 I do believe after this corona thing I can go out, work more; one needs to find something to do with one\u2019s time and that\u2019s why I said corona is a big reason why I\u2019m still smoking.\nWhile many participants regarded the COVID-19 pandemic as a hindrance to their quitting effort, one participant indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic motivated her to be more decisive in quitting smoking:\nIt affected me in a way that I think of quitting smoking more than I did before because it is more risky to continue smoking. Certainly, you don\u2019t want to keep smoking and then have COVID-19 \u2026.. from what I\u2019m told and what I know about COVID it attacks your lungs and cigarette smoking reduces your ability to process oxygen through your lungs which will make you more vulnerable."

Like I said, the success rate was high. It was a lot of interviews and residents who actually stopped smoking and some that I see that went from smoking a pack a day that went down to like three or four a day. So just for those weeks alone I really saw success in the residents.\nWhile the program intended to change smoking behavior of the study participants, site coordinators shared with us some pleasant indirect benefits of the program:\n\u201cThese programs bring an opportunity for people to get together as well and bond,\u201d said one site coordinator.\nAlso, one site coordinator said that the program helped her and other members of the facility management team learn about the underlying reasons for the smoking of their residents:\n\u201cWe also found reasoning behind why a lot of the residents do smoke,\u201d she said.\nWith regard to the impact of the COVID-19 program on the program and coping strategies, site coordinators shared about the many challenges they had in running the day-today operations of the facilities. One site coordinator told us:\n1 3\nI believe it was January of this year and month three we had to do a shutdown because of COVID and so, CEASE just like every other program had to make adjustments going back to what I said earlier about building the plane as it is in flight. So, everyone had to make adjustments, and CEASE did the same thing. I had to make adjustments, the residents had to make adjustments as well; So, I cannot say that they should have done this or that better. I think that they did exactly what the program was supposed to do in the midst of a pandemic so I have no complaints about it.\nAs the situation with COVID-19 evolved, the site coordinators, like other members of the management team, had to make adjustments. One of the site coordinators shared her experience by telling us:\nThey [residents] open the door, and we communicate like that. For the assessments for residents who want weekly calls or biweekly calls I had to call them; I ask them questions, mainly: [Do]you have your medication for the next two weeks? Do you have food? Do you have toilet paper? Do you have a support system? Who's in your support system? Um, have you talked to [them]?\nAnother site coordinator said:\nA virtual class which I\u2019ve been trying to get started. At least in our community space if the partners can\u2019t come in, we could meet virtually, and I could put up a screen or something so then there would be at least a community space to keep them six feet apart.\nOne study-site coordinator shared her experience by telling us:\n[What] we had to do was transition into doing a lot of \u201cgrab and go\u201d kind of thing so they would come to pick up their package[s] and leave. We no longer have the gatherings, and then we moved into [having] a lot of conferences; So, we did the conference calls where they could dial in at a certain time, and so our programs were left like that and we also started some virtual things and then once in the summer when they kind of eased up on some of the [mandates], we had limited groups of not more than six people, so we would do double programs so that other people have a chance to participate."

That would be the only thing I'm upset, [apart from being upset] that the pandemic hit, would be the hours. If the hours were more during the day."

            "text": "Overall, the qualitative findings revealed a good knowledge and awareness of the CEASE program by participants and site coordinators and participants had the desire and intention to quit smoking. In addition, there was a positive perception and general satisfaction of participants and study site coordinators with the program. Most participants, site coordinators and peer motivators found the QSQM concept relevant and useful. In the quantitative component, more participants in the Monday-enhanced CEASE arm were available for follow-up compared to the standard CEASE, which may suggest more engagement and retention in the program in the Monday-enhanced arm compared to the standard CEASE arm. In addition, even though it was not statistically significant due to the small sample size, more of the Monday-enhanced CEASE participants smoked fewer cigarettes or quit smoking at follow-up compared to the standard CEASE participants. The overall findings are suggestive of participants\u2019 inclination to quit or cut down tobacco use. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown constituted a major roadblock to the program, but the teams were able to work around the challenges to continue delivering the smoking cessation services. Site coordinators, peer motivators, and participants provided useful recommendations for future program delivery, including timing, use of virtual methods, and improved materials/messaging."

            "text": "In this mixed-methods study, we explored the feasibility and effect of incorporating the QSQM\u00a0concept into an existing CBPR tobacco cessation program on quitting outcomes among participants of a tobacco cessation program in a low-income setting. Quantitative study findings suggested that more participants in the Monday-enhanced group completed the program compared to the standard CEASE\ngroup. For both the Monday-enhanced and standard CEASE groups combined, there was a reduction in the mean tobacco consumption per day while no significant difference in quit rate was observed between the two groups. Qualitative data suggested that the Monday-enhanced CEASE group participants expressed more motivation for quitting and more satisfaction with the program compared to standard CEASE participants. This was in line with the quantitative findings, which were indicative of more retention in the program by Monday-enhanced CEASE participants.\nThe overall improvement in smoking cessation outcomes points to the relative effectiveness of the CEASE program for quitting or cutting down tobacco use. These findings are supportive of other studies that emphasized the effectiveness of CBPR in smoking cessation among diverse populations, especially low-income, underserved ethnic minority communities [23, 24, 37, 38]. Additionally, most participants expressed their satisfaction with the program. They indicated that they found the program very engaging and beneficial. Our qualitative findings support findings from other studies showing that participants are more comfortable and engaged in CBPR settings due to familiarity with the environment and trust [23, 37, 38]. In our study, participants spoke favorably of the social support they received from their fellow participants. Besides supporting one another in punctuality and attendance at the programs, they also held one another accountable concerning their quitting goals. When proactively encouraged, this type of informal peerto-peer social support might be relevant for increasing the involvement of participants in community-based programs. Previous studies have shown promising results of CEASE program in achieving smoking cessation results among hardto-reach low-income racial and ethnic minority populations by providing participants with social support, social networks, and social capital [23, 24, 39].\nThe study findings are suggestive of a higher participants\u2019 follow-up rate and greater motivation for quitting/cutting down cigarette use in the Monday-enhanced CEASE group compared with the standard CEASE group. This finding, albeit modest, is noteworthy. This may suggest that the QSQM messages and materials can be applied as an option and may even boost tobacco use cessation programs for possible improved outcomes. A good proportion of the participants posited that the QSQM messages and materials and the prospect of starting afresh on Mondays, were very helpful and motivational.\nThe use of temporal landmarks, such as the QSQM concept for health behavior change, is an emerging field of research with promising evidence [15, 16]. Some research indicate that behavioral interventions such as smoking cessation programs may benefit from taking advantage of specific days of the week when people show increased interest in health behavior change [16]. Public health practitioners and\n1 3\nresearchers including tobacco cessation researchers could leverage this concept of a weekly clock for healthy contemplations to achieve positive health behavior modification. The QSQM concept has an added advantage when compared to yearly landmarks such as New Year or birthdays because it allows for a shorter turnaround time in the likely event of failing to achieve the set health behavior goals. The Mondayenhanced CEASE program was designed to fall on a Monday in order to take advantage of the concept of starting afresh at the beginning of every week. The Monday-enhanced CEASE program also included Monday motivational messages and check-ins. Not much research is available on the effectiveness of applying this Monday concept specifically in tobacco cessation programs. One clinical trial demonstrated an increased participant self-efficacy towards future smoking cessation following the QSQM programs [17]. Additional research, particularly randomized controlled trials, would be necessary to support this QSQM concept and encourage its use in smoking cessation programs. The promising findings shown in our study may contribute to the limited literature available on this topic. The findings should, however, be interpreted in light of the study limitations."

            "text": "This program had several strengths, including leveraging on a well-established community-based smoking cessation program, namely, CEASE. Furthermore, the program was driven by peers, which contributed to participant engagement. Another strength of the program was the collaboration among various institutions/organizations resulting in multidisciplinary input from all partners and stakeholders. The limitations of the study included that the program coincided with the state of emergency declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a statewide stay-athome order. As a result, in-person classes could no longer hold. To mitigate this limitation, group phone calls using a conference calling platform replaced in-person sessions. Participants were provided a number to call in during their class time and the group calls were facilitated by their peer motivators. The lack of face-to-face interactions was challenging for some participants and some participants experienced technical difficulties while connecting to the group calls. This challenge could have negatively impacted the overall smoking cessation outcomes. Another important limitation of this study was the small sample size since further enrollment into the program halted due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, of the 64 participants who attended the first session, only 38 (59.4%) were captured at follow-up. To balance this limitation, we added a robust qualitative component in\norder to provide more depth in the understanding of the effects of the Monday-enhanced CEASE program. One limitation resulting from the randomization of sites into Monday-enhanced or Standard CEASE was that the only non-public housing site was different at baseline compared to the public housing sites, potentially resulting in a selection bias. The dropout rates were also the highest in this site and could be attributed to the fact that participants of that site were very mobile and not in a common residence like in public housing; therefore, it was harder to reach them during the pandemic. To minimize this limitation, peer motivators made several attempts to contact all participants who did not call into the classes. An additional limitation due to the COVID-19 pandemic was the inability to measure breath CO at follow-up and the reliance on participants\u2019 self-report to categorize them into those who \u201cquit\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t quit.\u201d Some studies show, however, that self-reported smoking status may be fairly reliable for predicting actual smoking status [40, 41]."
