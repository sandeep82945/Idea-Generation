 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the long-term impacts of organic and extensive farming as adaptation strategies to climate change. The paper found these strategies to be beneficial, but more research could examine their sustainability over longer time periods. 

2. Explore the effects of different policy and subsidy schemes on promoting climate change adaptation in agriculture. The paper discussed the limitations of financial incentives alone, so further studies could test alternative policy approaches.

3. Develop more sophisticated methods for modeling farmer decision-making and learning in response to extreme weather events. The paper used a simple model of learning - more complex agent-based models could provide greater insights.

4. Analyze the spatial heterogeneity in adaptation strategies across different farm types and regions. The current study looked at aggregated effects, but future work could examine geographical differences. 

5. Conduct empirical research with farmers to validate the modeling results on workload impacts and preferred adaptation measures. Surveys and interviews could provide real-world data to compare to the simulations.
