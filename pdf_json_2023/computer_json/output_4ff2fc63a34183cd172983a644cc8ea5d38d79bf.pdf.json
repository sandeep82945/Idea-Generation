    "abstractText": "There is an emerging interest in using agile methodologies in Global Software Development (GSD) to get the mutual benefits of both methods. Scrum is currently admired by many development teams as an agile most known methodology and considered adequate for collocated teams. At the same time, stakeholders in GSD are dispersed by geographical, temporal, and socio-cultural distances. Due to the controversial nature of Scrum and GSD, many significant challenges arise that might restrict the use of Scrum in GSD. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) by following Kitchenham guidelines to identify the challenges that limit the use of Scrum in GSD and to explore the mitigation strategies adopted by practitioners to resolve the challenges. To validate our review findings, we conducted an industrial survey of 305 practitioners. The results of our study are consolidated into a research framework. The framework represents current best practices and recommendations to mitigate the identified distributed scrum challenges and is validated by five experts of distributed Scrum. Results of the expert review were found supportive, reflecting that the framework will help the stakeholders deliver sustainable products by effectively mitigating the identified challenges.",

It provides approach to the organization to competent and skillful resources at a lesser cost and easy accessibility to the markets [2]. GSD also has some challenges, which is not part of (or not as prominent) in traditional co-located development i.e., geographical, temporal, and\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nsocio-cultural distances that can lead to meaningful communication, coordination, and collaboration challenges that must be controlled to achieve the benefits of GSD [3].\nThere is a rising interest of implementing agile practices in GSD projects to get the mutual benefits of both methods [1]. Scrum, as an Agile common and most important practice, recently admired by many software teams in Agile distributed development. According to survey the scrum method of Agile software development is used over by 89% of agile development teams [3]. From the latest survey about agile practice acceptance rate, it is stated that agile methods could be effectively used by considerably dispersed members of a team. Another survey stated that, from the several agile practices, Scrum practices have a greater acceptance rate. Hence, it can be argued that the Scrum, which is the main component of agile is becoming popular gradually and could be effectively used by the teams that are dispersed globally [4].\nAs scrum teams are self-organized, enabled on excellent team collaboration and communication. Hence, it is hard to directly implement Scrum practices in GSD because in GSD development, team members are distributed physically by time-based, geographical, and socio-cultural distances resulting in numerous challenges or issues that might affect teams\u2019 communication and collaboration process [1]. There are multiple challenges confronted by man organizations who are using scrum practices in GSD [5].\nWe conducted up-to-date SLR to identify the challenges confronted by distributed scrum teams and the mitigation strategies adopted by teams to overcome the confronted challenges. While conducting the pilot review, it was observed that some studies have already proposed frameworks to mitigate the challenges. Still, their proposed frameworks are for resolving some specific challenges i.e., in [2], a framework is proposed to mitigate communication challenges. Similarly, in [3] author proposed a framework to manage risks in distributed Scrum, and most of the frameworks identified in the literature was unevaluated. To our best knowledge, we did not find any study that has developed a framework by identifying the latest challenges of distributed Scrum with the framework to mitigate all the confronted challenges.\nTherefore, we aimed to identify and explore all the challenges by conducting up-to-date SLR and develop a framework to mitigate the identified challenges. The findings of this study will help the practitioners to understand the challenges that could be confronted while doing development in distributed scrum, and our proposed framework will help them to mitigate the challenges effectively to ensure sustainable development.\nThe rest of the paper is organized in the following different sections: Section 2 discusses the background and related work. Section 3 describes the research method. Section 4 describes the research questions. Section 5 discusses the proposed framework, while Section 6 presents the results and discussion. Section 7 focuses on validity issues. Finally, Section 8 concludes with the implications of the study and guidance for future research."

Using Scrum, the software is delivered in different increments called \u201cSprints\u201d (typically 2\u20134 weeks iterations). Every sprint starts with the planning of sprint and ends with sprint review. Sprint planning is a time-bound meeting from the scrum team and could be last for up to 4 hours. The meeting is devoted to the development of detailed plans for the sprint. After that sprint review meeting is conducted, that is attended by the stakeholders of the projects to assess the business conditions, the market, and the technology. The\nreview meetings possibly will also be last for more than 4 hours. A retrospective meeting could also be planned to evaluate the teamwork in finalized sprints. Day-to-day scrum meeting conducted by the team is 15-minute long in which every participant of the team addresses the questions what I did yesterday, what is my today\u2019s task, and what obstacles are there to perform my task? Scrum creates 3 artifacts: product backlogs, sprint backlogs, and burn-down charts. Backlogs contain requirements from customers, and daily burn down indicates the total remaining work [4].

Different challenges were identified, and a case study was performed. The outcomes of the case study show that distributed scrum has many benefits if it gets implemented successfully, and the members of the team are more satisfied with the newly distributed scrum as compared to traditional approaches, even though there are still some challenges that must be addressed and resolved in upcoming improvement efforts. The limitation of the paper is that the analysis of proposed patterns is not performed.\nPaper [8] performed a case study on the organization which is using scrum practices. 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted to find out the challenges of scaling Scrum. Different challenges are confronted while implementing agile practices such as Scrum-of-Scrums, area product owners, common retrospective, common sprint demo, and common sprint planning. It is found that practical implementation of scaling distributed scrum is not as easy as it seems in theoretical manners in books. The limitation of the study is that most of the interviews were conducted from the main site so, there are chances of bias as results might be different if other sites have been involved.\nIn [9] authors conducted SLR to determine the human-related factors that can negatively influence while adopting agile in GSD. 11 different challenges were found, and 6 out of 11 challenges found critical challenges having the frequency of \u226550%. The challenges that were found critical were: lack of communication with the highest frequency of (88%), lack of customer involvement having a frequency (83%), lack of management commitments with the frequency of (72%), lack of requirements analysis with the frequency of (56%), lack of knowledge sharing (56%) and lack of roles and responsibilities (50%). A hypothetical model was developed based on identified challenges, which shows the relationship between identified challenges and scaling agile in GSD.\nThis paper [10] discuss an explanatory case study conducted in Norway for four years, on one of the largest software development programs to find out how agile methods are evolved to use for large scale and distributed development and what are the challenges encountered while using agile method in large scale development. It is found that communication, coordination and collaboration, customer involvement, knowledge sharing, and architecture management are the most challenging areas while using agile methods in large-scale development. In paper [11], SLR is conducted to determine the themes and primary issues of distributed agile development. It is found that project planning and management, communication, coordination, collaboration, cultural and quality assurance issues are the major concerns that need to be addressed and resolved to execute agile methodology in a distributive manner effectively. This paper limits in a way that it includes only articles published in IEEE, so the findings of this paper are limited in scope."

We conducted SLR by reviewing articles from 2005 to 2021 by following Kitchenham [12] to identify all the challenges confronted by distributed scrum teams and mitigation strategies adopted by teams to overcome the challenges. Out of 3348 articles, we selected 56 articles by applying different filters that discussed distributed scrum challenges and mitigation strategies adopted by teams to overcome the challenges. Twelve significant challenges were identified through SLR, shown in Tab. 1.\nAfter identifying challenges, we conducted an industrial survey from 305 practitioners by following Kasunic guidelines [13] to validate the challenges identified through SLR to accept or reject the challenges. We used a 5-point Likert scale to ask questions, and two types of Likert scales i.e., agreement and frequency are used for that. The values used for both of Likert scales were ranging from \u201c\u20132 to 2\u201d and \u201c0 to 4\u201d.\nTo evaluate our scales\u2019 internal consistency and reliability to conduct a survey, we used Cronbach alpha\u2019s value. As we have used 2 different Likert scales so, the first calculated value of Cronbach alpha was \u201c0.85\u201d and covered seven factors from the total 12 factors. Another type of likert scale covered the remaining five factors, and the calculated value for this scale against five factors was \u201c0.86\u201d.\nWe set a criterion to accept and rejected each challenge and the challenges with an average value greater or equal to 0.90 for 1st type of likert scale got accepted, and from 2nd likert scale, factors with an average value greater or equal to 1.50 got accepted and remaining factors got rejected. Out of 12 factors, 8 factors got accepted by practitioners. Tab. 2 shows the challenges accepted and rejected through survey, and Fig. 2 shows the average weightage response against each factor.\nNext, a research framework is proposed by consolidating the best practice identified through SLR to mitigate the validated challenges through a survey. We conducted an expert review by interviewing 5 experts of distributed scrum, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and ensure that the proposed framework will be helpful in sustainable development."

Out of 12 challenges, eight challenges were accepted by following defined criteria based on average weightage response against each challenge. The remaining challenges were rejected. Tab. 2 shows the accepted and rejected challenges with average weight against each challenging factor and Fig. 2 shows the average weightage response against each factor.\nWe proposed a framework to mitigate the accepted challenges by consolidating the best practices identified through SLR and conducted an expert review by conducting interviews of 5 distributed scrum experts to identify the effectiveness of proposed framework. Results of expert review revealed that proposed framework will effectively contribute to sustainable development by using distributed Scrum. Fig. 3 shows our proposed framework."

            "heading": "8 Conclusion and Future Work",
            "text": "There is an emerging concern of using agile practices in GSD projects to get the mutual benefits of both distributive and agile methods. Scrum, as an agile most known methodology, is currently admired by many development teams. It is typically considered productive for small-scale projects with co-located teams because scrum teams are self-organized and enabled on excellent team collaboration and communication. However, GSD are usually distributed by distance differences, which results in numerous challenges or risks that might affect team collaboration and communication processes. For sustainable development and\nimplementation of distributed Scrum in GSD, there is a need to identify and mitigate all the confronted challenges in distributed Scrum. This study identifies challenges associated with distributed scrum development by analyzing past studies and validated by practitioners through a survey. A framework is proposed to mitigate the challenges validated by practitioners, and expert review is conducted by interviewing five distributed scrum experts to validate the proposed framework. The focus of this study was the identification of distributed scrum challenges and the proposal of a framework to mitigate the identified challenges for sustainable distributed development.\nAn extensive systematic literature review was conducted to ensure the maximum validity of the study. Selection criteria was defined to extract the studies, and 3348 studies were extracted initially from different renowned databases. After careful review of the studies, 56 articles were selected in response to RQ1 and RQ2. By performing a critical review on the studies, 12 major challenges were identified, and out of 12 challenges, distributed scrum practitioners accepted eight challenges through the survey. This study revealed that lack of communication, coordination, and collaboration among distributed scrum teams is the most critical challenge with frequency of 91%, and it leads to many other challenges.\nEfforts have been made to cover the maximum number of distributed scrum challenges and mitigation strategies available in the literature to propose a framework. Our proposed framework is expected to help distributed scrum practitioners to mitigate the confronted challenges while working in distributed Scrum effectively.\nWe plan to conduct an industrial case study by using the proposed framework to evaluate the further effectiveness of the framework and ensure sustainable distributed scrum development.\nAcknowledgement: The authors want to express their gratitude to the reviewers for their careful reading of the paper.\nFunding Statement: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this work through research group no.
