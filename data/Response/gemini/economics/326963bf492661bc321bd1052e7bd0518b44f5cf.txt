1. **Investigate the impact of cash transfer interventions on the frequency of sexual activity among adolescent girls and young women.** This would help to determine whether the impact of cash transfers on pregnancy is due to changes in contraceptive use, changes in sexual activity, or both.
2. **Explore the mechanisms through which cash transfer interventions reduce early pregnancy.** This could involve qualitative studies to understand the experiences of adolescent girls and young women who have participated in cash transfer programs, as well as quantitative studies to examine the relationship between cash transfers and other factors that are associated with early pregnancy, such as school attendance, economic empowerment, and decision-making power.
3. **Compare the effectiveness of conditional and unconditional cash transfer interventions in reducing early pregnancy.** This would help to determine whether the conditionality of cash transfers is necessary for their effectiveness, or whether unconditional cash transfers are equally effective.
4. **Examine the long-term effects of cash transfer interventions on reproductive health outcomes.** This could involve following up with adolescent girls and young women who have participated in cash transfer programs to see whether the effects of the intervention persist over time.
5. **Develop and test interventions that combine cash transfers with other strategies to reduce early pregnancy.** This could involve combining cash transfers with educational programs, health services, or other interventions that have been shown to be effective in reducing early pregnancy.
