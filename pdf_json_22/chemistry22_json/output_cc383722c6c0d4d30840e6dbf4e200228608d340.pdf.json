    "abstractText": "Cre recombinase selectively recognizes DNA and prevents non-specific DNA cleavage through an orchestrated series of assembly intermediates. Cre recombines two loxP DNA sequences featuring a pair of palindromic recombinase binding elements and an asymmetric spacer region, by assembly of a tetrameric synaptic complex, cleavage of an opposing pair of strands, and formation of a Holliday junction intermediate. We used Cre and loxP variants to isolate the monomeric Cre-loxP (54 kDa), dimeric Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and tetrameric Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9, 4.5 and 3.2 \u00c5, respectively. Progressive and asymmetric bending of the spacer region along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate interfaces between Cre protomers and illuminates the structural bases of biased loxP strand cleavage order and half-the-sites activity. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals constrained conformational sampling along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings underscore the importance of protein and DNA flexibility in Cre-mediated site selection, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for biased strand cleavage order, and recombination efficiency. Such considerations may advance development of site-specific recombinases for use in gene editing applications.",

Cre recombines two loxP DNA sequences featuring a pair of palindromic recombinase binding elements and an asymmetric spacer region, by assembly of a tetrameric synaptic complex, cleavage of an opposing pair of strands, and formation of a Holliday junction intermediate. We used Cre and loxP variants to isolate the monomeric Cre-loxP (54 kDa), dimeric Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and tetrameric Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9, 4.5 and 3.2 A\u030a, respectively. Progressive and asymmetric bending of the spacer region along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate interfaces between Cre protomers and illuminates the structural bases of biased loxP strand cleavage order and half-the-sites activity. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals constrained conformational sampling along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings underscore the importance of protein and DNA flexibility in Cre-mediated site selection, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for biased strand cleavage order, and recombination efficiency. Such considerations may advance development of site-specific recombinases for use in gene editing applications."

            "text": "We report Cryo-EM structural studies of DNA recognition and assembly of recombination intermediates by the enzyme Cre (causes recombination). Cre is a tyrosine sitespecific DNA recombinase (YSSR), originally discovered in the P1 phage, where Cre functions to ensure proper par-\ntitioning of prophage replicons during bacterial cell division (1\u20133). Exploitation of Cre in biotechnology applications has enabled precise removal or replacement of defective DNA through a highly controlled process that precludes DNA lesions elevating its candidacy as an effective gene editing technology (4\u20138). Cre excises, exchanges, or inverts double stranded DNA beginning with recognition of two 34-bp asymmetric loxP DNA sites. Each loxP site comprises two palindromic 13-base pair (bp) recombinase binding elements (RBEs) that are recognized in antiparallel fashion by two Cre proteins (Figure 1A and B). The RBEs are separated by an 8-bp asymmetric spacer that determines the orientation of each site and the outcome of recombination reactions (9\u201312). Four molecules of Cre assemble with two loxP DNA sites, in alternating fashion, and tyrosine residues of each protomer perform a series of strand cleavages, exchanges and ligations, forming covalent 3\u2032-phosphotyrosine and Holliday junction intermediates to generate recombinant products. Cre catalyzes this reaction without the need of additional factors or consumption of ATP, and thus, has emerged as a powerful tool for genome engineering in the laboratory (13). However, expanded use of the technology for targeting arbitrary or asymmetric recognition sites is hindered by our limited understanding of the molecular features that control site selection, DNA cleavage, and recombination (4\u20138).\nTetrameric Cre-loxP structure\nMuch of our understanding of the structural bases for site selection, assembly, and recombination of loxP DNA by Cre comes from a series of crystal structures of similar tetrameric assemblies (a quasi-equivalent trimeric complex has also been reported) (12,14\u201317). However, until now, high-resolution structural models of assembly precursors have not been available. Analytical ultra-centrifugation (AUC) and mobility shift assays have shown that Cre is monomeric in solution and cooperatively oligomerizes at nanomolar concentrations in the presence of a loxP DNA substrate (Figure 1C) (16,18). The available >20 crystal\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: +1 614 292 1377; Email: foster.281@osu.edu\nC\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Cre function and assembly intermediates. (A) Cre carries out excision, integration, cassette exchange, and inversion reactions on DNA containing pairs of loxP sites (black triangles) and manipulated DNA regions (blue/purple). The direction of the arrows indicates the orientation of each asymmetric loxP site (13). (B) The loxP DNA sequence with conventional nomenclature. The spacer sequence (red) is asymmetric (gray triangle) and thus defines the overall orientation of the loxP site and determines which are the left and right RBEs (recombinase binding elements). The top strand (TS) runs 5\u2032-3\u2032 from the left RBE and has the spacer sequence 5\u2032-ATGTATGC-3\u2032, whereas the bottom strand (BS) runs 5\u2032-3\u2032 from the right RBE and has the complementary spacer sequence 5\u2032-GCATACAT-3\u2032. Cre recombines DNA with a bias for cleaving opposing sites on the BS, at the right RBE, with later cleavage of the two TS (filled triangles) (68,72). (C) Wild type (WT) Cre assembles in a reversible, stepwise, and cooperative manner to form a Cre-loxP monomer, then a Cre2-loxP dimer, followed by antiparallel dimerization of dimers to form a (Cre2-loxP)2 homotetramer with each Cre protomer related by pseudo-fourfold symmetry. WT Cre makes and accepts protein\u2013protein contacts (point, pocket) in a circular fashion in tetrameric complexes. Equilibrium constants for each step were established by analytical ultracentrifugation and mobility shift assays (16,18). (D) Tetrameric, dimeric and monomeric Cre complexes used in these studies. Tetrameric complexes were prepared using CreK201A in complex with a full loxP site; additional stabilizing GC \u2018clamps\u2019 are shown in gray. Dimeric complexes were assembled using CreYin and CreYang variants featuring complementary \u2018point\u2019 and \u2018pocket\u2019 mutations, respectively. The palindromic RBE sequences are black, the asymmetric spacer red, and the stabilizing GC clamps in gray. Monomeric complexes were obtained with CreYin bound to a DNA hairpin with a single RBE and a symmetric loxA spacer (14,34).\nstructures of Cre or Cre-like recombinases in tetrameric complexes exhibit similar characteristics, as exemplified by the tetrameric, pre-cleavage complex between a cleavagedeficient variant, CreK201A and loxP (2HOI (16); Supplemental Figure S1): (i) The tetramer exhibits pseudo C2symmetry, in which the loxP sites are antiparallel and the protomers bound to the right RBEs are primed for DNA cleavage with their tyrosine nucleophile on helix M positioned within \u223c3 A\u030a of the scissile phosphate, while the protomers on the left RBEs are in an inactive conformation with their catalytic tyrosines \u223c6 A\u030a away from the scissile phosphate. In this bottom strand (BS) complex the primed protomers reside on the right RBEs, and the bottom strands are poised for cleavage. (ii) Each loxP DNA duplex is asymmetrically bent by \u223c108\u25e6. (iii) DNA bending is coincident with extensive protein\u2013protein interactions between protomers on the same duplex and across the synapse. These interactions include reciprocal cyclic trans docking of the C-terminal helix N and a loop between - strands 2 and 3 (the 2\u20133 loop) in a manner hypothesized to act as allosteric switches (14,19). This structural asymmetry in the C-terminus and inter-protomer interfaces observed in all tetrameric synaptic complexes of Cre suggest that protein flexibility is important for regulating protomer activity (20\u201326).\nloxP site recognition\nThe structural basis for loxP sequence specificity by Cre has been difficult to decipher. Tetrameric crystal structures have revealed that relatively few of the bases in the RBEs or spacer are directly contacted by amino acid sidechains (5,14,27\u201330). Biochemical studies using variant Cre and loxP sequences have identified specificity determinants that are not well explained by the contacts observed in tetrameric structures. These observations led to the conclusion that shape complementarity and water-mediated contacts are at least as important as direct readout in sequence selectivity by Cre (4,14,19,27,31\u201333). Nevertheless, in the absence of high-resolution structures of assembly intermediates, it has remained unclear whether additional protein\u2013 DNA contacts might play important roles in initial steps of site recognition that are not retained in the assembled tetrameric complex. For instance, NMR studies of the catalytic domain of Cre showed that the C-terminal region of the protein containing helix N docks in a cis autoinhibited conformation over the DNA binding site in the absence of DNA, and is displaced upon binding to loxP DNA, thereby extending into solution (34). The cryo-EM structures described below of Cre bound to DNAs containing one and two RBEs lend clarity to recognition and progressive assembly of synaptic complexes, and emphasize the roles of shape\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1753/6519361 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nrecognition, DNA deformation (indirect readout (35\u201337)), and protein\u2013protein interactions contributing to specificity."

            "text": "Control over the DNA cleavage activity of the four assembled Cre protomers is critical to faithful DNA recombination because activation of adjacent protomers would result in double-strand breaks and failed recombination. The mechanism for this control is particularly intriguing due to the close topological and stereochemical similarity of YSSRs to type IB topoisomerases, whose tyrosine nucleophiles are active to cleave DNA as monomers and exhibit low sequence selectivity (38). Both classes of enzymes sport highly conserved active sites comprised of conserved arginine and lysine residues that coordinate the scissile base and phosphate in similar manners (38). Tetrameric crystal structures of synaptic complexes and Holliday junction intermediates of Cre (and other YSSRs) have invariantly shown pseudo-C2 symmetry with opposing pairs of protomers adopting inactive and primed conformations, as defined above. Comparison of the primed and inactive protomers in these structures has drawn attention to the 2\u2013 3 loop and C-terminal helices M and N (Supplemental Figure S1) (14,27). Solution NMR studies of the C-terminal domain of apo Cre showed flexibility in the 2\u20133, J-K and M-N loops but not for helix N (34). However, the J-K loop is involved in direct DNA recognition and does not differ between primed and inactive protomers in crystals, refocusing attention on the 2\u20133 loop and M- N.\nNew insights from Cryo-EM structures\nIn the work described below, cryo-EM structures of the Cre assembly intermediates provide important insights into the mechanism of Cre activation. We designed two mutants, CreYin and CreYang, that when added to a full loxP site, in a 1:1:1 fashion, are expected to assemble into a Cre2-loxP dimer that maintains a native interface along the lox site but prevents interactions at the tetramer interface (Figure 1D, Supplemental Figure S1, Methods). Addition of CreYin to a DNA hairpin containing a single RBE allowed us to isolate the Cre-loxP monomer complex. Lastly, we assembled a pre-cleavage Cre4-loxP2 tetramer using the cleavage deficient CreK201A variant (16). These new structures illuminate the critical roles of protein and DNA deformation in enabling site recognition, trans-docking of the N helix, and formation of protein\u2013protein contacts involving the key regulatory elements 2\u20133 loop, M and N (Supplemental Figure S2). These insights simultaneously help us understand site selectivity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, and the basis for the observed bias for strand cleavage order. Additionally, our work highlights the use of conventional defocus methods for high resolution structure determination of low molecular weight (<100 kDa) macromolecular complexes by cryo-EM."

Using the crystallographic coordinates of the tetrameric pre-cleavage complex of CreK201A bound to loxP (2HOI), we engineered the variant CreYin by mutating the \u2018pocket\u2019 of the protein bound to the right RBE of the loxP site and deleted the \u2018point\u2019 of the protein bound to the left RBE of the loxP site to engineer CreYang (Figure 1C and D) (16). The Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies (PISA) tool from PDBe was used to identify buried residues and residues involved in hydrogen bonding and salt bridge interactions across the synapse at both of the possible interfaces (Supplemental Figure S1, chains A:H and B:G) (40,41). In the coordinates for 2HOI, residues D33 and R192 on the primed protomers (chains B and H), and residues R72 and R119 on the inactive protomers (chains A and G) had the most distinct and extensive hydrogen bonding and salt bridge networks: D33 forms salt bridges with R72 and R119, while R192 forms a salt bridge with E308. We then used the mCSMPPI2 webserver to perform saturating mutagenesis on the A:H and B:G interfaces to predict which mutations of the four residues listed above would provide the most destabilizing effect (42). Informed by this analysis, we selected two mutations: D33A and A36V on helix A to eliminate favorable electrostatic interactions with nearby residues, and R192A on the 1\u20132 loop to disfavor the coordination of N in the binding pocket of CreYin. Although varying A36 in helix A was not predicted by mCSM-PPI2 to be detrimental, we also included in CreYin the mutation of A36V, which was previously shown to be defective in synapsis (presumably a steric interference, but structurally unverified) (16). For CreYang, we flipped the charges on R72E and R119D to create a largely negative charged interface to disfavor interactions with D33, while L115D was selected to generate similar unfavorable charge-charge interactions and eliminate favorable apolar contacts.\nSite-directed mutagenesis, protein expression and purification\nCre mutants were generated from a pET-21a plasmid template (Novagen) containing WT Cre (provided by Gregory Van Duyne, University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA), using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) (14,16). DNA primers (Supplemental Table S1) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Each mutant was transformed into Escherichia coli T7 Express LysY/Iq competent cells (NEB) using electroporation in a 1 mm electroporation cuvette. Transformations were plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) (RPI) media plates supplemented with 100 g/ml carbenicillin (RPI) and 25 g/ml chloramphenicol (Fisher Scientific) and incubated overnight (16 h) at 37\u25e6C.

Binding reactions were equilibrated at room temperature for 30 min. 1 l of 10\u00d7 EMSA gel loading dye (60% glycerol, 40% binding buffer, 0.1% bromophenol blue) was added to each reaction and then loaded onto a prerun (120 V, 30 min) 6% native PAGE gel using gel running buffer. Samples were electrophoresed at 80 V for 75 min and imaged on an Amersham Typhoon Gel imager."

WT Cre, CreK201A, CreYin (D33A/A36V/R192A) and CreYang (R72E/L115D/R119D) were assayed against a linearized plasmid containing two loxP sites in direct repeat (Figure 2B). Cre excises the intervening sequence to produce a circular 1 200 bp product and a linear 4 000 bp product, which can be resolved on a 1% agarose gel (59,60). Cre recombines the substrate as expected (to \u223c65% completion due to the competing reverse reaction), whereas cleavage-deficient CreK201A does not (16). In addition, CreYin, CreYang and the CreYin/CreYang combination did not generate recombinant products.\nWe used EMSA to assay the Cre constructs for their ability to assemble with loxP DNA at concentrations approximating the equilibrium dissociation constant for synapsis of WT Cre (16). In this assay, each Cre mutant was combined with a 5\u2032-Cy5-labeled loxP DNA and electrophoresed on a 10% native page gel. For CreK201A, which has been shown to be capable of synapsis but not cleavage (16), we observed bands corresponding to free DNA, singly bound loxP DNA (monomers), fully bound loxP sites (dimers), and two loxP DNA sites coordinated by four Cre proteins (tetramers) (Figure 2C). Using 10 nM loxP DNA and various amounts of CreK201A we observe about 50% dimers and 50% tetramers, consistent with the published synaptic KD of \u223c8 nM; moreover, the monomer to dimer transition is highly cooperative as indicated by a very low population of monomers (16). Next, we tested a Cre deletion mutant ( N, residues 1\u2013330) that has been shown to be synapsis-defective (16). Upon addition of Cre N to loxP DNA, we can observe that most, if not all, cooperativity is lost, evident from the prominent monomer band, and the formation of tetramers is strongly disfavored (Figure 2C). Although CreYin and CreYang were designed to not interact favorably, they nevertheless are observed to form homodimers on DNA in a cooperative manner, with a low population of monomeric species; no tetrameric species were observed under these conditions (Figure 2C). When CreYin, CreYang, and loxP DNA were combined, a mixture of dimer species was observed, with more than one band corresponding to the dimer species on DNA. Because the electrophoretic mobilities of the CreYin/CreYang homo- and heterodimers on DNA were almost indistinguishable, this warranted investigation with higher-resolution analytical tools.\nTo quantify and characterize the composition of the CreYin/Yang heterodimers on DNA, we turned to native mass\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1753/6519361 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 2.

Gray shapes are assigned as proteoforms of these complexes. The summed relative intensities of the three complexes are indicated in the inset table.\nspectrometry (MS). MS uses soft ionization methods and non-denaturing solution conditions to record gas-phase mass spectra that preserve non-covalent interactions reflective of those in solution (61). We first screened each individual component\u2019s mass and purity (Supplemental Figure S3, Supplemental Table S2), and subsequently analyzed mixtures of CreYin, CreYang and loxP DNA. To increase the mass separation between CreYin (38 307 Da) and CreYang (38 342 kDa), we used uniformly 15N-labeled CreYang (38 844 Da, if fully labeled); mass analysis showed >95% labeling (Supplemental Table S1). The experimentally determined masses of CreYin and CreYang matched the theoretical masses, but some minor species were present for 15NCreYang and CreYin. These are likely truncations, modifications, or specific salt adducts (Supplemental Figure S3, Supplemental Table S2). The 15N-CreYang spectrum contains two charge state distributions with the higher charge state centered around +17 being indicative of unfolded or disordered protein (62). The determined mass for loxP-38 (loxP site with a GC clamp on each end) matched the theoretical mass. (Supplemental Figure S3, Supplemental Table S2). In all spectra, many of the peaks had additional mass spacing of \u223c22 Da attributable to sodium adducts.\nNative mass spectra were recorded of samples containing 0.10 M loxP and either (i) 0.50 M CreYin, (ii) 0.50 M 15N-CreYang or (iii) 0.25 M CreYin + 0.25 M 15N-CreYang in a solution of 200 mM ammonium acetate. For each sample, we observed signals corresponding to the molecular weights of complexes with protein:DNA stoichiometries of 1:1 (monomeric complexes) and 2:1 (dimeric complexes) (Supplemental Figure S4). When both CreYin and 15NCreYang were mixed with loxP, we observed abundant signals corresponding to both homo- and heterodimeric complexes with loxP DNA (CreYin-CreYin, CreYin-CreYang and CreYang-CreYang) (Figure 2D). Absent interactions between protomers, we would expect statistical population ratios of 1:2:1 for these complexes, and an additional bias in favor of the heterocomplex due to their complementary protein\u2013 protein interfaces. However, the number of gas-phase ions corresponding to CreYin + 15N-CreYang were only \u223c36% of the total ion count; this may reflect imperfect proportionality between ion counts and solution populations (63). Nevertheless, this compositional heterogeneity decreased the number of usable particles in subsequent cryo-EM reconstructions and may also have resulted in averaging of homoand heteromeric species (see below).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1753/6519361 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024"

Images were subjected to single particle analysis via 2D classification of motion corrected and CTF estimated particles, followed by 3D classification and non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC v3.0 (48,50). Additionally, 3D Variability Analysis was performed on the tetramer dataset (51). These resulted in 3D density maps with global resolutions (gold standard FSC cutoff of 0.143) of 3.91 A\u030a for the CreYin-loxA monomeric complex (Figure 3A, Supplemental Figure S5, Supplemental Table S3), 4.48 A\u030a for the CreYin-CreYang-loxP dimeric complex (Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure S6, Supplemental Table S3), and 3.23 A\u030a for the K201A-loxP tetrameric complex (Figure 3C, Supplemental Figure S7, Supplemental Table S3). Local resolutions varied from 3.3 to 7.1 A\u030a, from 4.1 to 7.0 A\u030a, and from 2.9 to 5.4 A\u030a, respectively. All single particle reconstructions were performed without the use of symmetry. Atomic models were built in an iterative fashion using Coot, ISOLDE and Phenix real space refinement (56\u201358). Protein residues 1\u201319 in all complexes had no resolvable density and were omitted from modeling. Data collection, data processing, and model building statistics are summarized in Supplemental Table S1.\nCreYin-loxA half-site map and model\nThe density map for the CreYin-loxA complex contains both domains of the protein, their interdomain linker, and the fully resolved loxA hairpin (Figure 3A). Helices B, D and J, participants in all the major groove protein\u2013DNA interactions (Supplemental Figure S9), and catalytic core (Supplemental Figure S9) were of the highest resolution (between 3.3 and 4.0 A\u030a), allowing for accurate sidechain placement into the map (64). Density is present for the 2 and 3 strands that form the anchor for the 2\u20133 loop, but no robust density was observed for the loop itself (residues 199\u2013 207, Figure 4A and B), which includes the active site residue K201. Likewise, clear density was observed for M and the catalytic tyrosine, placing the O of Y324 \u223c6 A\u030a from the scissile phosphate (Figure 4F), but no density existed to model N. Thus residues 199\u2013207 and 330\u2013343 were excluded from the model. The loxA hairpin phosphate backbone, major and minor grooves were well resolved, and in the higher resolution regions of the DNA individual ribosyl groups can be visualized. To better visualize the global DNA bend, the loxA hairpin model was extended with Bform DNA to contain a second RBE (Figure 5A, monomer, white RBE) (53,65). The loxA hairpin DNA exhibits an overall bend of 18\u25e6 with a maximal bend located at the RBE\u2013spacer junction (Figure 5A and C) (66).\nCreYin-CreYang-loxP map and model\nSingle particle analysis of the CreYin-CreYang-loxP assembly was complicated by the presence of homo- and\nheterodimers (loxP bound by CreYin-CreYin, CreYangCreYang and CreYin-CreYang), as evidenced by the EMSA and native MS experiments described above. During 3D classification, three populations of dimers emerged. The resolution of the three maps was insufficient to assign the identity of each bound protomer as CreYin or CreYang. However, in two of the three populations, the density for the N-terminal domain of one protomer was diffuse and displaced from its expected binding site in the major groove, and in the third population the N- and C-terminal domains of both protomers were positioned in the major groove of the loxP DNA (Supplemental Figure S6). We assigned this third class as being CreYin-CreYang-loxP heterodimers, and the two poorly-bound classes as homodimers on the expectation that engineered electrostatic repulsion between two CreYang protomers, or steric repulsion and loss of salt bridge between two CreYin protomers, would disfavor tandem docking of both N-terminal domains in these species. This assignment is also supported by the observation that the relative populations for each dimer class closely matched that of native MS experiments (Figure 2D).\nA particle subtraction routine was used to further refine the dimer map. After selecting for fully assembled heterodimers on DNA, it was apparent that the resulting reconstructed particle set had a third protein loosely bound (Supplemental Figure S6). This third protein was faintly visible in 2D classes and in 3D reconstructions as a smearing of density that originated from the end of helix M of the density assigned to the CreYang protomer. Complexes with a third Cre protein bound to Cre2-loxP were not detected by EMSA or native mass spectra; therefore, we used a particle subtraction routine to remove density of the third loosely associated protein; nevertheless, it seems likely that this type of interaction could be important in the context of synapsis of two Cre2-loxP dimers.\nIn the resulting map, we could identify two Cre protomers (Figure 3B, blue, orange) bound to a full loxP DNA site (Figure 3B, magenta). The loxP DNA helix was well defined in the map with an asymmetric global bend of \u223c48\u25e6 (Figure 5A and C); this bend is consistent with that measured by phase-sensitive gel mobility shift (67). However, the resolution of the map was insufficient to unambiguously assign the orientation of the asymmetric spacer of the loxP DNA; therefore, it is possible that the maps arise from a mixture of DNA orientations. Nevertheless, we modeled the loxP DNA with a BS orientation such that the helical deformation parameters (Supplemental Figure S8) of the dimer agree with structural and biochemical data showing the preference for BS complexes (68). Due to the limited resolution of this map, protein modeling was guided by secondary structural elements in the monomer (above) and tetramer (below). Density is clearly visible for the N helix of the CreYin protomer docked into the N binding pocket of CreYang. Compared to crystal structures and the tetramer (below), the M- N linker adopts an extended conformation, thereby comprising the only extensive interprotomer interactions in the dimer complex (Supplemental Table S4). The N helix of CreYang was likely removed via particle subtraction due to its association with a third protein, and therefore, residues 328\u2013343 were not modeled.

For much of the DNA, the density allowed for discrimination of purine and pyrimidine bases, and accurate placement of bases was enabled by clear density for the phosphate backbone, ribosyl groups and the bases themselves. Each loxP DNA is highly bent to about 83 degrees (Figure 5A, tetramer), most prominently at the right side of the spacer, which features six consecutive AT or TA base pairs (Figure 5C). Despite this, it is possible that the tetrameric reconstruction arose from averaging of synapses poised for top strand and bottom strand cleavage (Figure 1); if BS and TS cleavage complexes are overall isomorphous, particle classification with the resolution of acquired data would not be sensitive to nucleotide identity within the spacer sequence (69,70). Nevertheless, the tetramer is highly isomorphous to that of the crystallized pre-synaptic complex of CreK201A bound to loxP, with\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1753/6519361 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n/nar/article/50/3/1753/6519361 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 5.

As seen in this crystal structure and others of Cre in tetrameric complexes (12,13,26), each protomer bound to the right RBE adopts a primed conformation wherein Y324 is positioned close to the scissile phosphate on the BS, and the Y324 of the protomer bound to the left RBE is far from the scissile phosphate on the TS, adopting an inactive conformation (Figure 4F). Primed and inactive conformers in the tetramer are related by a pseudo C2 axis, such that each dimer can be seen as exhibiting half-the-sites activity. The density map was refined with no imposed symmetry, and a separate homogenous refinement in cryoSPARC with C2 symmetry did not yield a map with significant improvements in resolution (\u223c0.1 A\u030a). Overlay of each Cre2-loxP dimer in the tetramer resulted in an all-atom RMSD of 0.4 A\u030a, similar to that reported in other crystal structures of Cre (14,16,39).\nProgressive DNA deformations occur during assembly\nComparative analysis of the assembly intermediates reveals the roles of charge and shape complementarity in recognition of the loxP DNA sequence. Protein binding results in marked DNA deformations relative to canonical B-form DNA (Figure 5C) (53,65). Each RBE (Figure 5C, nonshaded regions) experiences similar deformations due to protein binding. Superposition of protomer models by - carbons, excluding the regions of varied structure ( A, M, N and 2\u20133 loop), yields an overall RMSD of 1.1 A\u030a (Figure 6). In all three structures, helices J, B, and D are in-\nserted into the major groove of the loxP DNA site at bases 6\u20139, 10\u201312 and 12\u201315, respectively (Figure 6). In addition, the 4\u20135 loop is inserted into the minor groove at bases 1\u20133 and the J-K loop is inserted into the minor groove at bases 9\u201310 (Figure 6). These interactions result in widening and narrowing of the major and minor grooves that is consistent among the assembly intermediates. The major and minor groove widths within the spacer region (Figure 5C, shaded region) vary between assembly intermediates and follow the global DNA bend that progresses along the assembly path. The protomers in the monomer and dimer complexes, and the inactive protomers in the tetramer, bury roughly 2100 A\u030a2 of surface area at their respective protein\u2013DNA interface. The primed protomers in the tetramer make more extensive DNA contacts burying roughly 2500 A\u030a2 of surface area (Figure 5B) due to engagement of 2\u20133 loop into the minor groove and increased interactions of side chains from E with phosphates of bases in the spacer region.\nEvolution of PPIs during assembly of synaptic complexes\nAssembly of Cre-loxP synaptic complexes is accompanied by formation of protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) that position motifs important for DNA cleavage by Cre. In the monomer and dimer structures, there is no visible density for the 2\u20133 loops of each protomer (Figure 4A and B) and two of the three N helices (Figure 4B and C). In the dimer, docking of N from CreYin on the right RBE into CreYang on the left RBE buries \u223c690 A\u030a2 of surface area (Supplemental Table S4), but there are no other significant interactions between the protomers. The N helices and 2\u20133 loops become structured upon synapsis, with each N helix docking onto neighboring protomers in a cyclic fashion in\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1753/6519361 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 6.

The 2\u20133 loops of primed protomers on the right RBE insert themselves into the DNA minor groove at the scissile base (Figure 4D). The 2\u20133 loops originating from the inactive protomers on the left RBE are not inserted into the DNA minor groove, and instead pack tightly in a reciprocal fashion against the M helix of the primed protomer whose N helix is donated to it. Together, the packing of inactive protomer 2\u20133 loops can be seen to confine the M of each primed protomer, while the primed protomer does not similarly constrain the M of inactive protomers, allowing those M-N linkers to adopt extended conformations (Figure 4D, Figure 6). Together with local differences in DNA geometry between the primed and inactive sites, these structural differences position Y324 of M at the BS scissile phosphate in the primed protomer of each right RBE (Figure 4F). Additional structural changes that accompany assembly include the reorientation of A: in the monomer and dimer structures A packs against helix B, whereas it rotates by about 90\u25e6 to pack against E of an adjacent protomer when forming the tetrameric complex (Figure 4E).\nConformational sampling of Cre tetrameric complexes\nA range of conformations were revealed in the CreK201AloxP complexes. 3D variability analysis (3DVA) (51) was carried out on the tetramer cryo-EM dataset using two principal components, of which PC1 yielded continuous heterogeneity associated with changes in the degree of loxP DNA bending (Supplemental Movie S1). We used ISOLDE to flexibly fit the consensus model into the start and end conformations of PC1 (Figure 7A) to better interpret the structural changes connecting the first and last frames (58). The bending angle of the DNA varies by about 10\u25e6 over the course of the modeled heterogeneity (Figure 7b) (66). In the first frame (F000), the loxP DNA is bent at about 75\u25e6,\nand there is no clear density for either inactive or primed 2\u20133 loops (Figure 7B and C). The angle of DNA bending increases to about 85\u25e6 in the last frame (F019) as the protomers rotate along the loxP DNA interface, and clear density for the 2\u20133 loop is observed (Figure 7B and C). Increased DNA bending and rigidification of the 2\u20133 loop is thus coincident with positioning of the primed protomer\u2019s Y324 near the scissile phosphate (Figure 7D)."

The cryo-EM structure of tetrameric CreK201A-loxP complex reaffirms the key attributes of an active, pre-cleavage complex revealed by prior crystallographic studies of the CreK201A-loxP complex and lends new insights into concerted conformational changes required for activation, DNA bending, and maintenance of half-sites activity (16). The structure of the Cre2-loxP dimer supports long standing hypothesis of initial regulation of halfsites activity and order of strand exchange.

In the cryo-EM density map of the Cre-loxP half-site complex, the J-K loop is ordered, consistent with a role in DNA binding. However, no density is observed for helix N and the 2\u20133 loop, presumably due to the absence of stabilizing protein\u2013protein interactions. This is consistent with their role in mediating protein\u2013protein interactions with neighboring protomers and structural variability in the inactive and primed conformations. Indeed, the 3.9 A\u030a structure is highly congruent with the inactive protomer in the synaptic complex, with an overall backbone RMSD of \u223c1 A\u030a (Figure 6), and Y324 is far from the scissile phosphate (Figure 4F). Since K201 resides at the tip of the 2\u20133 loop, the active site is not fully formed at this step of assembly. The monomeric Cre-loxP complex reveals the same major and minor groove protein\u2013 DNA contacts observed in protomers of fully assembled synaptic complexes (Supplemental Figure S9), indicating that sequence specific recognition of the RBE is realized upon a single Cre protein binding to a loxP half-site. Comparison of individual protein\u2013phosphate backbone contacts observed in the monomer (Cre-loxA complex) and in the active and inactive protomers of the tetrameric complex underscores the role of both base-specific contacts and shape recognition (indirect readout (35,36)) in site selection (Supplemental Figure S9). Thus, the cryo-EM structure of the monomer is consistent with the observed site-specific binding of Cre and the lack of topoisomerase activity due to absence of a fully formed active site from insufficient protein\u2013 protein interactions (13,26,38,71).\nHalf-sites activity and order of strand exchange inferred from pre-synaptic Cre-loxP dimers\nThe use of CreYin/CreYang pairs allowed for isolation and characterization of pre-synaptic Cre2-loxP complexes featuring a native protein\u2013protein dimer interface (Figures 3B and 4C). A defining feature of dimer assembly is trans docking by the N of CreYin onto its docking site on CreYang, accompanied by an increase in DNA bending and increased DNA deformations of bases proximal to and in the spacer (Figure 5A and C). Once two Cre protomers are assembled onto a loxP site, directional DNA bending results from the N of one protomer docking into its site on the adjacent protomer. Remembering that directionality of the loxP site is determined by the asymmetric spacer sequence, in a BS complex (Figure 4C) the loxP DNA is favorably bent within the AT-rich region to allow the N helix of the protomer bound to the right RBE (blue) to dock into the protomer positioned on the left RBE (orange); the N of the recipient protomer then extends out into solution in the opposite direction as the DNA bend. Thus, in the case of synapsis by two BS dimers only the protomers positioned to cleave the BS (Figure 4C, blue) can be activated for cleavage through packing with the 2\u20133 loops of the adjacent (orange) protomers. Conversely, if the loxP is bent in the opposite direction, the N from the protomer on the left RBE will dock on the protomer on the right RBE, and the dimer will be poised for TS cleavage.\nProductive synapsis occurs when two similarly bent dimers encounter each other in an antiparallel orientation\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1753/6519361 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n(69,70). In this model, tetrameric TS and BS complex formation is determined by the probability of a Cre2-loxP dimer forming bends that favor BS or TS cleavage, and then encountering another similarly bent dimer. Formation of BS-BS synapses would result in bottom strand first cleavage, TS\u2013TS synapses could cleave the top strands, whereas assembly of BS\u2013TS complexes would result in unproductive, or mutagenic recombination events (73). Assuming similar efficiency for recombination by either BS\u2013BS or TS\u2013 TS synaptic complexes, an \u223c80% preference for BS strand first recombination would be explained by a small 15% bias (kT ln (0.65/0.35) \u223c0.6 kT) toward formation of BSbent dimers [0.65 \u00d7 0.65 \u00f7 (0.65 \u00d7 0.65 + 0.35 \u00d7 0.35) = 78%] (72,74). An 88% BS preference (74) would correspond to a bend bias of \u223c1 kT.\nThe asymmetry of this protein\u2013protein interaction also illuminates the basis for half-the-sites activity of the enzyme (14,19). In tetrameric complexes, the packing of 2\u20133 of one protomer (Figure 4D, white) onto the M of an adjacent protomer (Figure 4D, yellow) activates it (white arrows) for cleavage. However, in the other (synaptic) interface, the packing of the 2\u20133 loops with the M of their adjacent protomers (red arrows) is insufficient to activate that pair of protomers for cleavage. Thus, the dynamics and conformational state (Figure 4A\u2013D and Figure 7C) of the 2\u20133 loop can be seen as acting as a switch driven by protein\u2013protein interactions, that results in activation of alternating active sites, thereby preventing double strand breaks. Therefore, the structure of the Cre2-loxP dimer provides new insights into the structural basis for cooperative DNA binding (by trans N docking), for the observed BS/TS cleavage preferences (biased spacer bending), and half-the sites activity due to poorly formed protein\u2013protein interfaces that fail to assemble a complete active site at either scissile phosphate."

            "text": "The new structures support a model in which protein and DNA dynamics play important roles in Cre-loxP synaptic complex assembly and activation (Figure 8): (i) Sequestration of helix N over the C-terminal domain DNA binding surface prevents premature oligomerization of Cre protomers, while flexibility in the linker facilitates C-clamp formation by the independently folding N- and C-terminal domains (34). A single Cre protein binds to an RBE and extends a flexible helix N into solution. Incomplete formation of the Cre active site, due to insufficient protein\u2013protein interactions to stabilize the 2\u20133 loop and helices M and N, results in a loosely bound complex incapable of premature DNA cleavage, while enabling DNA sequence scanning and intersegmental transfer (75,76). (ii) The N helix, extended and flexibly sampling multiple conformations, uses a fly-casting mechanism to capture a second Cre protomer on an adjacent RBE of the loxP site. Biased bending of the asymmetric spacer of doubly bound loxP DNA allows sampling of TS and BS complexes, each of which could be reversibly stabilized by docking of helix N from one protomer into its site on the other protomer in the dimer. Conformational sampling is enabled by inherent flexibility of the DNA, and of the protein: the 2\u20133 loop, helix , as well as helix A, which result in ill-formed protein\u2013\nprotein interactions in the dimer. (iii) Pairing of antiparallel duplexes with matching bends is mediated by fly-casting by the free N of each dimer to result in synapsis, wherein each synaptic complex is primed for either BS- or TS-first cleavage. Consistent with the observation of a third protomer recruited to dimer complexes, this model poses that synapsis occurs in stepwise fashion: (i) capturing of one protomer in a dimer by the free N of another dimer complex, thereby tethering two dimer complexes together; (ii) concerted dynamics that result in full capture of the second dimer. (iii) Productive synapsis of two like dimers is accompanied by additional DNA bending, and assembly of active sites through stabilization of protein\u2013protein interfaces by rearrangements of A, 2\u20133 and M\u2013N. Conformational sampling in the tetrameric complex, described by 3DVA, suggests that synapsis is not coincident with activation, and hints at a propensity for the conformational changes that follow initial DNA cleavage. Stochastic and concerted conformational sampling involving the flexible protein\u2013protein interfaces would also facilitate strand exchange and the subsequent isomerization step that exchanges primed and inactive protomer conformations.\nInsights into loxP site recognition\nThe potential for repurposing Cre recombinase for lesionfree DNA recombination in a cellular context has motivated broad efforts to understand the biochemical basis for its sequence specificity (12,13,77). Specificity could be achieved at the level of highly selective assembly of Cre tetramers on target sites, or by much higher recombination efficiency at those sites (i.e. kcat/KM). Optimizing these properties in a rational way requires knowledge of the structural features that drive both activities.\nRecombination assays with WT Cre and variants have shown that DNA sequence specificity is driven by some amino acid residues that in tetrameric crystal structures do not make direct contacts to DNA bases in the RBEs, as well as those that do (5\u20137,20,28\u201330,33,78\u201382). The structures of the Cre-loxP monomer, dimer and tetramer feature the same sets of contacts with the RBEs (from helices B, D, J, the J-K loop and the 4\u20135 loop; Supplemental Figure S9), and similar deviations from canonical B-DNA helical parameters (Figures 5 and 6; Supplemental Figure S8). These observations suggest that no major RBE recognition elements evolve during the assembly process, underscoring the dual importance of direct and indirect readout.\nDespite almost no direct interaction between Cre and bases in the spacer DNA, its sequence is nevertheless an important determinant for recombination by Cre (31,83,84). In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that even single base pair changes to the spacer region can reduce recombination efficiency to greater than 90% by wild-type Cre (83). Thus, it is reasonable that these changes might alter the structure or rigidity of the spacer region and thus its ability to adopt cleavage competent conformations (33,82).\nNevertheless, directed evolution experiments have produced Cre variants capable of efficiently recombining noncognate sites (5,7,78,80,82). These variants contain mutations mapping primarily to protein\u2013protein interfaces in tetrameric complexes, suggesting that such mutations in\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1753/6519361 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 8. Assembly pathway of Cre recombinase on loxP DNA. (i) Binding of the first Cre protomer to an RBE dislodges N from its autoinhibited conformation and induces a slight bend (\u223c18\u25e6) in the DNA; \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 identify protomers bound to the left or right RBEs (\u2018L\u2019, \u2018R\u2019), respectively. (ii) Fly-casting by the extended and flexible N (blue cylinders) captures a second Cre protomer on an adjacent RBE; this is accompanied by further DNA bending (to \u223c50\u25e6) to form top strand (TS) or bottom strand (BS) dimer complexes. Isomerization between TS and BS complexes can occur through reversible undocking of the N to form an extended intermediate; DNA re-bending and subsequent N docking generates either TS or BS dimers. (iii) Synapsis of two similarly bent Cre2-loxP dimers (TS or BS), facilitated by fly-casting by the free N on each dimer, results in initial tetrameric complexes that undergo further conformational sampling (dotted arrows) to form either TS or BS synaptic tetramers. (iv) The fully formed synaptic tetramers feature \u223c83\u25e6 bends in the DNA and alternating pairs of primed and inactive protomers; packing of the 2\u20133 loop (small, rounded rectangles) across the spacer activates the recipient protomers (red) to cleave either the TS, or BS. Additional conformational sampling of the synaptic complexes (evident in 3DVA analysis) may help promote cleavage and enable subsequent recombination steps. Gray arrows indicate the direction of the asymmetric spacer sequence (red). Cleavage sites on the top and bottom strands (TS, BS) are indicated by black arrowheads.\nearly rounds of selection might function by relaxing specificity for these altered sites, whereby cleavage-competent protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013DNA conformations can be sampled (5,6,33,82). This idea is supported by the observations of the variable DNA distortions and protein\u2013protein interfaces observed between the dimeric complex and in the 3DVA series for the tetrameric complex. Thus, the balance between protein\u2013protein interactions and DNA flexibility seems to be an important determinant for selecting DNA sites."
