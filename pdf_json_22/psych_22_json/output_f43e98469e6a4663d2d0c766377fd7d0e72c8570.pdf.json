Using the family triad dataset, this study\ninvestigated machine learning (ML) models to predict the risk of depression in\ncollege students and identify important family and individual factors.\nMethods: This study predicted college students at risk of depression and\nidentified significant family and individual factors in 171 family data (171\nfathers, mothers, and college students). The prediction accuracy of three ML\nmodels, sparse logistic regression (SLR), support vector machine (SVM), and\nrandom forest (RF), was compared.\nResults: The three ML models showed excellent prediction capabilities. The\nRF model showed the best performance. It revealed five significant factors\nresponsible for depression: self-perceived mental health of college students,\nneuroticism, fearful-avoidant attachment, family cohesion, and mother\u2019s\ndepression. Additionally, the logistic regression model identified five factors\nresponsible for depression: the severity of cancer in the father, the severity of\nrespiratory diseases in the mother, the self-perceived mental health of college\nstudents, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.\nDiscussion: These findings demonstrated the ability of ML models to\naccurately predict the risk of depression and identify family and individual\nfactors related to depression among Korean college students. With recent\ndevelopments and ML applications, our study can improve intelligent mental\nhealthcare systems to detect early depressive symptoms and increase access\nto mental health services.\nKEYWORDS\nmachine learning, depression, college student, family, risk factors\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "There is a growing concern about the high prevalence of depression among college students nationwide. According to a systematic review, nearly one-third of college students have experienced depressive symptoms, compared with 9% of the general population (1). In Korea, young adults aged 19\u201329 had the highest prevalence of depression (25.33%), followed by those aged 30\u201339 (24.16%), 40\u201349 (18.67%), 50\u201359 (18.67%), and 65 and older (13.24%) (2). The first signs of depression in college will have a significant impact on academic success and social relationships. Additionally, it will increase the risk of psychiatric comorbidity and suicide (3, 4), which is the leading cause of death in young adults (5).\nEarly detection of depression and treatment referral is crucial for alleviating the serious effects of depression (4). However, owing to the social stigma associated with mental disorders, Korean students are reluctant to seek mental health services, making the detection of clinical depression by psychiatrists rather limited (6). Therefore, using a patient-administered screening tool can help increase the screening rates of college students\u2019 depression and consequently help identify and diagnose depression before psychiatric appointments (7).\nThe Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) (8) is the most used and validated self-report screening tool for the potential existence of depression across a wide age range (9). The CES-D cutoff of 13 was designed specifically to screen for the risk of depression in the Korean population (10). Furthermore, several researchers have used the CES-D to investigate the risk and protective factors of depression.\nThe well-established risk factors for depression in college students include biological, psychosocial, and environmental factors (11, 12). Additionally, family factors in Korean culture require particular attention because the relationship between parents and children is highly valued owing to the practice of Confucianism (13), which has been influencing hierarchical relationships between parents and children. Korean children are expected to obey their parents, and Korean parents are more involved in the lives of their children than American parents (14, 15).\nNumerous studies have shown that family dynamics affect the susceptibility of college students to depression and its persistence (16\u201319). Kim et al. (17) examined the relationship between the depression of parents and that of their children. Children who perceive overly strict parenting are more likely to experience depression than those who perceive optimal parenting (18). Additionally, a systematic review revealed that parental cancer affects the stress and anxiety levels of children (19). However, most studies used traditional statistical methods, such as logistic regression, which heavily rely on the perspectives of the researchers. Researchers manually choose\nseveral variables relevant to a single model and sequentially analyze the relationships between them (20).\nWith recent advancements in technology and data science, artificial intelligence (AI), including ML techniques, has provided advanced analysis methods for developing prediction systems (20\u201322). These ML techniques enable more accurate classification and prediction by analyzing complex interacting associations amongmultiple datasets. However, few studies have applied ML algorithms to predict depression in older adults and depressive relapse in bipolar patients (21, 23). Furthermore, limited studies have explored the family-related risk factors for depression in the Korean family triad of fathers, mothers, and college-aged children. Therefore, this study investigated the performance of different ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and sparse logistic regression (SLR), to construct a predictive model in which the algorithm accurately predicts the risk of depression in the family triad dataset. Additionally, the best set of variables associated with the risk of depression among Korean college students was identified using SLR."

This study used all study variables and focused on the analysis results of the ML models to develop the best predictive model by identifying the best set of variables using 171 family data (513 individuals).\nThe family dataset consisted of families of college students, that is, father, mother, and children triads. The inclusion criteria for families were as follows: (a) must be older than 18, (b) must have a college student, (c) must have signed consent forms to participate from all familymembers, and (d)must be able to read Korean. Families with members suffering from mental illnesses were excluded.\nParticipants were recruited from universities and religious institutions (churches and temples) using flyers. They were informed that they would independently, and without interacting with family members, complete the questionnaires. To maintain data independence, they each sealed their completed questionnaire in an envelope. Of 197 families, 26 (13.2%) were excluded because outcome-related variables were missing.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org"

According to the variable type, a t-test or chi-square test was used, and p-values were suggested. To build a prediction model, we considered three ML techniques: SLR, SVM, and RF. Logistic regression is one of the most widely used techniques for predicting binary responses. However, it cannot handle high-dimensional data with a small sample size compared with the number of predictor variables (31). We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty to overcome this problem and benefit from variable selection (32). Logistic regression with a LASSO penalty (SLR) considers all variables as inputs and makes some coefficients zero while iterating the optimization procedure. Therefore, this algorithm performs a variable selection procedure because the final model has only a few non-zero coefficients and most variables have zero coefficients. This ensures that the algorithm develops an effective prediction model without experiencing high data dimensionality (31). SVMs are among the most well-known ML techniques for binary classification problems. The SVM searches for a hyperplane in high-dimensional space to effectively segregate data (33). RF is a representative ensemble technique for classification, which collects several fitted results from multiple constructed decision trees and outputs the result voted from most trees (34)."

This finding implied that SLR outperforms other methods in terms of ranking data, even though the thresholding value (0.5) is not optimal for class prediction in this application.\nTable 4 shows a final logistic regression fit for selected variables using SLR, and Figure 1 shows significant RF variables. The self-perceived mental health statuses of college students were the most significant variable in the logistic model for understanding and predicting their depression risk (p < 0.001). The depression of college students was negatively associated with their self-perceived mental health status [odds ratio (OR) 0.093, 95% CI 0.021\u20130.272], implying that college students with healthier mental health had a lower risk of depression. According to RF, the self-perceived mental health statuses in college students were the most significant variable for predicting their depression risk. Further analysis using logistic regression showed that fathers with cancer and conscientiousness of college students had a negative relationship with the depression risk in college students, whereas respiratory diseases of mothers and neuroticism of college students had a positive relationship with depression risk. Factors related to college students (conscientiousness and neuroticism of college students) were identified in the final logistic model and were also selected as important features in the RF.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The study provides evidence that the performance of ML algorithms can accurately predict college students who are at risk of depression in the context of parent-child relationships. The ML algorithm can help reduce bias and improve disease prediction accuracy using training datasets to train and test datasets to test (38, 39). The main strength of this study was the use of the family dataset to predict and identify family factors of depression in college students using ML techniques. With recent advancements and applications of ML, our study can help improve intelligent mental healthcare systems to detect early depressive symptoms and increase access to mental health services for college students.\nOur data are high-dimensional, where variables are more than samples. This data feature causes two problems. First, the estimates are poorly defined when using linear regressions. Second, despite having analysis results, the interpretation is difficult owing to numerous variables. This dataset feature\nenabled us to investigate additional analysis techniques, such as SLR, RF, and SVM.\nSparse multivariable logistic regression is a well-known ML technique that enables the application of multivariable logistic regression to high-dimensional data (31). This technique simultaneously conducts estimation and variable selection to obtain interpretable results with estimated effect sizes. Conversely, SVM and RF have been unaffected by the high dimensionality of the data. Recently, these techniques have been widely used to analyze high-dimensional data, and numerous studies showed that these techniques outperform regression models (21, 40). Both techniques use all available variables to develop a prediction model; however, their results are not easily interpretable as those of regression models, which list important variables along with their estimated effect size (41). However, the RF model provides a list of important variables based on how each variable is used by the algorithm.\nOur study demonstrated that SVM and RF outperformed sparse multivariable logistic regression in terms of prediction. Most of the metrics from these two methods were superior to those from the sparse multivariate logistic model. Particularly, RF demonstrated the best prediction performance. However, important variables can be identified from the results of sparse multivariable logistic regression, and its prediction performance is comparable with that of SVM and RF. This technique automatically selects significantly effective features using an algorithmic approach and estimates the effect size. Multiple model-selected variables are also included in the list of variables where an RF is suggested as an important feature. This finding suggested that considering the strategic use of multiple ML techniques from both prediction and inference standpoints is important.\nIn our study, mother\u2019s depression, respiratory diseases, and father\u2019s cancer, were identified as three family factors significant in predicting depression risk in college students. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that college students whose mothers had depression and respiratory diseases were more likely to experience depression. However, college students with fathers who have cancer have a lower risk of depression. These findings can be explained by the intergenerational effects of the parent\u2019s health status on depression in children. Children may feel stressed, powerless, and depressed in the presence of their mother\u2019s depression and fatigue leading to cough and breathlessness (42).\nMoreover, several studies have demonstrated that maternal depression increases the risk of depression in early adulthood through poor parenting. Depressed mothers are more likely to express negative emotions toward their children and interact negatively with them, which interferes with the bond between the mothers and their children (43\u201345). Children with insecure attachments frequently struggle to identify or control their emotions, which may result in depression (46).

This is incongruent with a previous study, which found that children whose parents had cancer experience higher levels of depression than those with cancer-free parents (47). These findings contribute new knowledge to our understanding of the relationship between paternal cancer and depression in children. One justification is that fathers who realize more value in spending time with their children than at work after being diagnosed with cancer may increase communication with them, which helps children develop resilience and prevents depression (48, 49). Another justification is that children build resilience and reduce depression when they positively deal with a stressful situation, such as a father being diagnosed with cancer, by interpreting the situation positively and creating meaning (50\u201352). Future research should focus on understanding the mechanisms of paternal cancer in children with depression. Depression in college students can be measured against different mechanisms of maternal and paternal psychological and mental disorders.\nWe discovered that five individual factors were important in predicting depression in college students: family cohesion, fearful-avoidant attachment, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and self-perceived mental health. Family cohesion and\nfearful-avoidant attachment were found to be important factors that contribute to determining depression in college students using the RF approach. According to earlier studies, college students who reported a high level of family cohesion had a lower risk of depression than those with lower levels of cohesion. The former group experienced comfort, support, and togetherness within their families (53\u201355). However, students with fearful-avoidant attachment, high anxiety about rejection, and avoidance of intimacy experienced more depression than those with secure attachment (56). Because students with fearful-avoidant attachments perceive low family cohesion, repairing parent-child attachments reduces depression by building trust and safety with parents and using them as emotional supporters (55, 57, 58).\nLogistic regression results demonstrated that neuroticism increased the risk of depression among college students, whereas conscientiousness decreased this risk. Neuroticism and conscientiousness, which are human personality traits, are associated with depression (59, 60). College students with higher neuroticism who tend to be emotionally unstable might often focus on their negative emotions, whereas those with higher conscientiousness, who tend to be goal-oriented, careful, and efficient, could efficiently direct their attention away from negative emotions (60, 61). Personality traits are difficult to change; however, training college students with neuroticism\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 06 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Predictors of college student\u2019s depression.\nin adaptive emotional regulation strategies should help them prevent depression.\nOur results implied that self-perceived mental health is a significant predictor of depression. The perception of mental health of an individual typically indicates their self-perceived mental health. These results were consistent with a previous study that demonstrated that poor self-perceived health is a risk factor for depression (62). College students who negatively perceive their mental health believe that they need professional treatment, but they refuse it because they believe that seeking help is a sign of weakness (63). However, if college students have good mental health, they do not feel the need to visit\nthe hospital (64). Therefore, it is important to objectively evaluate or detect signs of depression in the mental health of college students.\nOur study investigated the performance of the three ML algorithms and identified family and individual factors that could help predict depression in college students. Using AI technologies could reduce depression risk in college students and improve mental health. Our ML algorithms could use family data to screen college students for depression. Healthcare providers can use these ML algorithms to identify college students who may be at risk of depression and help them with early intervention.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 07 frontiersin.org\nThis study has some limitations. First, although three factors, mother\u2019s depression, college students\u2019 cohesion, and college students\u2019 fearful-avoidant attachment, were identified as important factors in the RF approach, the direction of the effects of these factors is unknown. Second, it was difficult to interpret the causal relationship between the important factors and depression using the cross-sectional data. Finally, although the severity of chronic disease was included in the variables, it was evaluated from a subjective perspective. This should be considered in future studies."
