    "abstractText": "A simple, one-pot regioselective method for the synthesis of a high-nitrogen tricycle, 2,3,4a,6,7,8a,9,10-octaaza-4,8-dioxo-3,4,4a,7,8,8a,9,9a,10,10a-decahydroanthracene, with a yield of 27% was developed on a starting urea basis as a result of studies focused on finding new, more efficient approaches to the synthesis of high-energy derivatives of dinitramic acid (DNA). This tricycle was further treated to furnish 2,3,4a,6,7,8a,9,10-octaaza-4,8-dioxo-3,4,4a,7,8,8a,9a,10a-octohydroanthracene9,10-ion-bis(dinitramide). The resultant salt of dinitramic acid exhibited inhibitory properties towards the burning rate of pyrotechnic compositions, reducing it by 30%, and possessed good thermal stability due to a high decomposition temperature above 260 \u25e6C and a low sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. The structural features of the new tricycle-based dinitramide salt were characterized via 2D NMR spectroscopy and double-focusing sector mass spectrometry (DFS).",

Introduction\nThe development of new high-energy materials around the world is closely associated with the derivatives of structurally different nitrogen heterocycles. These possess a high enthalpy of formation and enhanced density and are structurally rich in nitrogen that does need to be oxidized [1]. Moreover, energetic salts often have an advantage over nonionogenic molecules. In particular, ionic compounds frequently have a higher density than atomically similar, non-ionogenic molecules because of the Coulomb forces influencing the formation of ordered and dense lattice structures in molecular assemblies [2\u20136]. Therefore, the combination of a heterocycle with an explosophoric group holds much promise for creating high-performance energy-rich structures [7,8]. Given the heightened interest in the development of novel, environmentally friendly and safe explosives with different uses (airbags, mining industry, fire protection, etc.), the dinitramide salts of linear and heterocyclic compounds, based on urea and diaminourea, warrant special attention [9\u201312]. The high content of oxygen and nitrogen and their highenergy properties allow these compounds to be used in gas-generating compositions or as composite explosives [13\u201315]. Even though dinitramide is quite an unstable compound, dinitramide anions are the most stable and energetically beneficial because negative\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7437. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16237437 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7437 2 of 15\ncharge is delocalized. That said, the salts of metals and amine bases are an ionic form of dinitramide [16\u201320]. We previously reported the synthesis of new dinitramide salts, starting with carbohydrazide and a heterocyclic macrocycle (1), which inhibited properties with respect to the pyrotechnic composition burning rate [21\u201323] (Figure 1). In continuation of the research in this direction, we here propose investigating a structural analogue of compound 1 as the cation for the synthesis of new dinitramide salts. This analogue is a recently discovered tricycle, 2,3,4a,6,7,8a,9,10-octaaza-4,8-dioxo-3,4,4a,7,8,8a,9,9a,10,10a-decahydroanthracene (2), which is identical in elemental composition to compound 1 but distinct in constitution (Figure 1).\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7437 2 of 15\ntheir high-energy properties allow these compounds to be used in gas-generating compositions or as composite explosives [13\u201315].

Macrocycle (1) and tricycle (2).\nCompound 2 was first synthesized via the intramolecular cyclodimerization of bis(nitrosemicarbazone)glyoxal in aqueous medium and represents a flat condensed system analogous to the reduced anthracene, contains ethylene, carbonyl and hydrazine moieties, and consists of three six-membered rings of 1,2,4-triazine and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine at the same time [24]. The presence of different functional groups in the structure of tricycle 2 implies its high reactivity. The functionalization of the tricyclic compound using various nitrating agents allows the diversity-oriented synthesis of both the acid salts and di- and tetranitro derivatives of the reduced anthracene. In contrast, the corresponding diazide was isolated via nitrosation [25]. However, the synthesis problems of the starting 2, particularly the multistage process and low yields (at most 16% calculated on a starting urea basis), heavily hinder further research on expanding the compound\u2019s practical application. Therefore, the present study aimed to optimize the synthetic procedure for tricycle 2, develop a synthetic method for the corresponding dinitramide salt, and examine its explosive properties.\n2. Materials and Methods 2.1. General Information\nThe 1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired using Bruker Avance III 500 and Bruker AV-400 spectrometers (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA), operating at frequencies of 500.03 MHz and 400.13 MHz for 1H NMR, and 125.73 MHz and 100.61 MHz for 13C NMR, respectively. The chemical shifts were referenced to DMSO-d6 signals: 2.50 ppm for residual protons of CHD2 in 1H NMR spectra and 39.51 ppm for residual protons of CD3 in 13\u0421 NMR spectra. CDCl3 signals at 7.24 ppm were used as references for residual protons in 1H NMR spectra, as were signals at 77.16 ppm for 13\u0421 NMR spectra. The 15N NMR spectra were referenced to formamide as the external standard at \u03b4(15N) = 112.5 ppm.\nCompound 2 was first synthesized via the intramolecular cyclodimerization of bis (nitrose icarbazone)glyoxal in aqu ous medium and repres nts flat ondensed system analog us to the reduced anthracene, contains ethylene, carbonyl and hydrazin moietie , and consists of three six-membered rings of 1,2,4-tr azine and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine at the same time [24].

The 15N NMR spectra were referenced to formamide as the external standard at \u03b4(15N) = 112.5 ppm. Structural determination and signal assignment in the 1H,13C NMR spectra were performed using 2D heteronuclear techniques, including 1H,13C HMBC and 1H,13C HSQC. UV absorption spectra were acquired using a Varian Cary 50 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Varian, Belrose, Australia) in water, employing quartz cells (l = 0.5) at a temperature of 20 \u25e6C. Infrared spectra were recorded in KBr using an FT-801 Fourier spectrometer (Simex, Novosibirsk, Russia), with measurements performed in the range from 4000 to 500 cm\u22121. Elemental analysis was conducted using a CHNO FlashEATM 1112 analyzer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The melting point was determined using a B\u00f6etius PHMK instrument (Veb Analytik, Dresden, Germany). Decomposition temperature\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7437 3 of 15\nmeasurements were carried out using TGA/SDTA 851e and DSC 822e thermal analyzers (Mettler Toledo, Zurich, Switzerland) under a nitrogen atmosphere, covering temperature ranges of 25\u2013300 \u25e6C and 25\u2013500 \u25e6C, respectively, with a heating rate of 10 \u25e6C/min. Data obtained from these experiments were digitized and processed using the STARe 11.0 thermal analysis software. Mass spectrometry and precise measurements of molecular weights were conducted using a Thermo Electron Double Focusing System (Thermo Electron Scientific Instruments Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The samples, enclosed in metal vials, were introduced into the mass spectrometer via direct injection. When required, the sample vial could be heated within a temperature range from 25 to 360 \u25e6C. The mass spectrometer was utilized in the electron ionization mode, employing an electron energy of 70 eV. Precise measurements of ion masses were conducted using perfluorokerosene (PFK) standard lines as references.\n2.2.

Synthesis of compounds 2 and 3.\nThe decomposition of N,N\u2032-dinitrourea in water refers to a second-order reaction; crystalline N,N\u2032-dinitrourea in aqueous medium transitions to the aci-form [26]. It is well-known that the aci-form is a stronger acid that easily engages in salt-forming reactions with amines. As a result of the intermixing between the reactants, a ginger crystalline sediment of the bishydrazone salt of N,N\u2032-dinitrourea (3) precipitated almost immediately in a quantitative manner, which is consistent with the reported data [26\u201328]. Compound 3 differs in the IR spectrum from the starting reaction products and has an onium structure, while the presence of a strong broad absorption band near 3209 cm\u22121 corresponds to the H-N bond vibrations in the NH3+ cation. The intense signal of a vibrational band near 1692 cm\u22121 is typical of the associated form of the amide \u0421=\u041e. The bending vibrations (\u03b4asym) (H-N) show up at 1548 and 1501 cm\u22121. The absence of the absorption band near 3400\u20133300 cm\u22121 is suggestive of the N-\u041d bond being absent. Additionally, characteristic absorption bands are observed for asymmetric vibrations of the N-nitro group at 1605 cm\u22121 and for symmetric vibrations of the bond of the N-nitro group at 1289 cm\u22121. It is seen in Figure 2 that the 1H NMR spectrum of the obtained sample of compound 3 has no singlet protons of the NH2 group of the starting bis(hydrazone)glyoxal at 6.59 ppm, while the characteristic signal for the double-bond proton shifts to 5.76 ppm due to the impact of the dinitrourea anion, in which case a characteristic triplet corresponding to the NH3+ cation protons shows up at 6.96\u20137.22 ppm [25]. The splitting of the signal into a few equivalent peaks suggests an interaction between the proton in question and the other non-equivalent protons.

The splitting of the signal into a few equivalent peaks suggests an interaction between the proton in question and the other non-equivalent protons. Considering the multiplicity rule, it can be affirmed that the number of protons found on the neighboring atoms of the nitramide proton of NH-NO2 equals 2, that is, the NH2 group of bis(hydrazone)glyoxal interacts with the nitramide group to form a NH3+ cation. The absence of free NH and NH2 protons is suggestive of the same ionization of the nitramide nitrogen atoms of DNU and of a complete neutralization of the H-N acid to form the aci-form of the nitro group with the NH3+ cation in the solution, which is consistent with the literature data [29].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7437 6 of 15\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7437 6 of 15\nthe number of protons found on the neighboring atoms of the nitramide proton of NH-NO2 equals 2, that is, the NH2 group of bis(hydrazone)glyoxal interacts with the nitramide group to form a NH3+ cation.

The previous studies on the synthesis of tricycle 2 showed that the progress of intramolecular tricyclization requires an acidic medium that increases the activity of the acid proton, while a noticeable change in the medium acidity must be observed via the hydrolysis of DNU [30]. In order to confirm our assumption, we carried out a series of experiments on the interaction of aqueous bis(hydrazone)glyoxal with an excess of DNU in different molar ratios from 1:1 to 1:3 when heated to 70 \u25e6C for varied periods of time ranging from 3 to 7 h.

Physical and High-Energy Properties\nThe thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal analyses (DTA) in the polythermal mode under nitrogen conditions at a heating rate of 10 \u25e6C/min showed the good thermal stability of the resultant compound 4. A 2.6% weight loss of the sample was found to occur in a temperature range of up to \u2248100 \u25e6C. This was likely due to the evaporated hydrated water and coincides with similar effects for the other dinitramide salts [21\u201323]. In the DSC spectrum, a prominent decomposition peak is detected at 265 \u25e6C, accompanied by a heat release of 437 J/g. Additionally, a significant weight loss of 68.15% is observed, indicating a pronounced exothermic effect. The solid residue was 29.22%. According to existing literature, the decomposition peak at 199 \u25e6C in compound 4 is attributed to the decomposition of the constituent part of the dinitramide anion. On the other hand, the decomposition peak observed at 265 \u25e6C corresponds to the constituent part of tricycle 2. Synthesized salt 4 is a crystalline substance that is almost insoluble in water and alcohol and which explodes when heated; the physicochemical properties and sensitivities to impact and friction compared to starting ADN are summarized in Table 1.\nNote: The lower impact sensitivity limit is a minimum drop height at which explosion occurred in at least one of 25 tests and was measured using a drop weight impact testing machine by dropping a weight. Triggering was detected from a sound effect and/or soot formation on the rollers [34]. The lower friction sensitivity limit is a maximum applied pressure on a highly explosive charge placed between steel planes, under which no single explosion occurred in 25 tests upon a shock displacement of one plane relative to the other and was measured using a K-44-3 friction testing machine [35].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7437 12 of 15\nIt is seen in Table 1 that the synthesized salts 3 and 4 are of interest as safe high-energy compounds because they have reduced sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and enhanced thermal stability with negligibly reduced density when compared to ADN. To evaluate the catalytic or inhibitory effect of compound 4 on the burning rate of pyrotechnic compositions, we performed comparative tests on model compositions (wellknown pyrotechnic formulations exhibiting both low and high burning rates (u)) via the reported procedure [36]. The test results are shown in Figures 9 and 10. Materials 2023, 16, 7437 13 of 15\nFigure 10. The effect of compound 4 on the burning rate of the KNO3/Zr pyrotechnic composition at a pyrotechnic charge density of 2.75\u20132.95 g/cm3.\nThe obtained findings demonstrate that the burning rate decreases in both cases and is in direct relationship with an increase in the content of compound 4 in the KClO4/Al and KNO3/Zr systems. Table 2 presents comparative data on the relationship between the inhibitory effect and the additive content.\nThe results outlined in Table 2 demonstrate that compound 4 exhibits a pronounced inhibitory effect ranging from 5% to 30.23%.

In the current study, a novel regioselective approach for synthesizing 2,3,4a,6,7,8a,9,10octaaza-4,8-dioxo-3,4,4a,7,8,8a,9,9a,10,10a-decahydroanthracene, which is a promising high-nitrogen tricycle with a high nitrogen content, was discovered. 2. A never-before-seen structure of the corresponding bis-dinitramide salt was synthesized by reacting dinitramic acid with the tricycle followed by protonation of the H-N protons of the central ring. 3. The tricycle-based dinitramide salt is appealing as a safe high-energy material that has a low sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, enhanced thermal stability, and acts as a burning rate inhibitor of pyrotechnic compositions.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ma16237437/s1, containing IR spectra, DSC and TGA data, and burning rate test results for compounds 2, 3 and 4.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.S.G.; methodology, V.S.G.; software, E.E.Z.; validation, S.G.I. and I.V.E.; formal analysis, V.S.G., D.S.I., I.V.E. and A.A.N.; investigation, S.G.I., V.S.G., D.S.I., E.E.Z. and A.A.N.; resources, S.G.I. and A.A.N.; data curation, S.G.I. and I.V.E.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V.S.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, V.S.G.; visualization, D.S.I. and E.E.Z.; supervision, V.S.G.
