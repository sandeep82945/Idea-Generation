    "abstractText": "We analyze the strengths and limitations of steered discrete time quantum walks in generating quantum states of bipartite quantum systems comprising of a qubit coupled to a qudit system. We demonstrate that not all quantum states in the composite space are accessible through quantum walks, even under the most generalized definition of a quantum step, leading to a bifurcation of the composite Hilbert space into \u201cwalk-accessible states\u201d and the \u201cwalk-inaccessible states\u201d. We give an algorithm for generating any walk-accessible state from a simple-to-realize product state, in a minimal number of walk steps, all of unit step size. We further give a prescription towards constructing minimal quantum walks between any pair of such walk-accessible states. Linear optics has been a popular physical system for implementing coin-based quantum walks, where the composite space is built up of spin and orbital angular momenta of light beams. We establish that in such an implementation, all normalized quantum states are \u201cwalk-accessible\u201d. Furthermore, any generalized quantum step can be implemented upto a global phase using a single q-plate and a pair of homogeneous waveplates. We then give a quantum walk based scheme for realizing arbitrary vector beams, using only q-plates and waveplates.",

We demonstrate that not all quantum states in the composite space are accessible through quantum walks, even under the most generalized definition of a quantum step, leading to a bifurcation of the composite Hilbert space into \u201cwalk-accessible states\u201d and the \u201cwalk-inaccessible states\u201d. We give an algorithm for generating any walk-accessible state from a simple-to-realize product state, in a minimal number of walk steps, all of unit step size. We further give a prescription towards constructing minimal quantum walks between any pair of such walk-accessible states. Linear optics has been a popular physical system for implementing coin-based quantum walks, where the composite space is built up of spin and orbital angular momenta of light beams. We establish that in such an implementation, all normalized quantum states are \u201cwalk-accessible\u201d. Furthermore, any generalized quantum step can be implemented upto a global phase using a single q-plate and a pair of homogeneous waveplates. We then give a quantum walk based scheme for realizing arbitrary vector beams, using only q-plates and waveplates.\nI. INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM WALKS\nThe theory of classical random walks has been an indispensable tool to understand statistical phenomena, and has been ubiquitous in modeling of various stochastic processes[1\u20135]. In one-dimensional random walks, the walker tosses a coin and moves forward or backward by one unit, depending upon the outcome of the toss. The quantum mechanical counterpart of this are the discrete time quantum walks (DTQWs), where the walker and the coin obey the principles of quantum mechanics, and the motion of the walker and the toss of the coin are implemented as unitary transformations. Owing to quantum superposition effects, these walks display distinct statistical properties compared to their classical counterparts. Quantum walks have proved to be of immense utility in varied domains, like in quantum computation[6\u20138], quantum search [9], quantum algorithms [10, 11], generating random numbers [12], modeling topological phenomena [13\u201317] etc. In the DTQWs, the walker is modeled as a qudit, belonging to a potentially infinite-dimensional space called the \u201cwalk space\u201d, while the coin is modeled as a qubit, belonging to two-dimensional space called the \u201ccoin-space\u201d. In this context, another application of such quantum walks explored in recent years has been quantum state engineering (QSE) of high-dimensional quantum systems, which refers to constructing a desired quantum state starting from some simple-to-realize initial state. QSE is realized using DTQWs by carefully steering the quantum walk towards a certain state in the composite space and then projecting out the coin, such that the walker collapses into the desired state on the walk-space [18\u201322]. Such high-dimensional states have myriad applications, since, in general more can be accomplished in a qudit quantum system than in a qubit\n\u2217 gururaj@igcar.gov.in\nquantum system [23\u201325]. For instance, qudits are shown to be more powerful than qubits in tests exploring the foundations of quantum theory [26\u201328], in quantum machine learning [29] etc. In quantum cryptography, such states are shown to be more resilient to noise, and also offer a larger secret key rate [30\u201334].\nQuantum walks have been implemented in various physical systems[35]: NMR systems [36, 37], on ion traps [38, 39], in circuit QED[40] in neutral atoms [41], to name a few. In addition to these, photonic systems have also proved to be a very viable platform for implementing DTQWs, in that they have been demonstrated under various settings like, time-bin encoding[42], interferometers [43, 44], and spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum (SAM-OAM) of light beams. [45\u201347].\nIn this paper, we examine the viability of DTQWs in engineering of the quantum states of the composite-space itself instead of those of walk-space alone. In SAMOAM optical implementation of the quantum walks, these states physically correspond to what are called vector beams, which are light beams having spatially varying polarization distribution across their transverse planes. Such vector light beams have found numerous applications in varied fields[48\u201353]. In this paper, we recast the above-mentioned \u201cQSE using DTQWs\u201d formulation as a means of generating desired vector vortex beams starting from standard Gaussian light beams. The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we give theoretical background of the DTQWs, and then present mathematical formulation of QSE in DTQWs. Section III is devoted towards characterizing the quantum states obtained by quantum walks, and the quantum walks themselves. In section IV, we present a deterministic recursive algorithm for generating walk-accessible composite states, starting from some easy-to-generate product states. In section V, we introduce the notion of simplification of a quantum walk. We establish that given a quantum walk it is possible to construct another \u201csimplified\u201d quantum walk that is completely equivalent to ar X iv :2 20 5.\n04 87\n2v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 2\nM ay\n2 02\n2\n2 it, but consisting of quantum steps of identical step size. Given a pair of walk-accessible states, we also provide here method for obtaining a \u201cminimal quantum walk\u201d that transforms one to the other. In Section VI, we give a few numerical illustrations of the results presented in this paper. As a practical implementation of these ideas, in Section VII, we provide the scheme for generating desired vector beams using targeted quantum walks. In Section VIII, we conclude the paper by summarizing the results.\nII. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nFor carrying out a DTQW, we identity a quantum system with two different degrees of freedom (DOFs) : a qubit DOF called the \u201ccoin-space\u201d spanning the Hilbert space Hc and a qudit DOF called the \u201cwalk space\u201d whose states belong to a Hilbert space Hw. An arbitrary state |w\u3009 \u2208 Hc in the standard basis is given by\n|w\u3009 = w0 |0\u3009+ w1 |1\u3009 (1)\nwhere w0 and w1 are complex numbers. We associate with every state a unique state |w\u22a5\u3009 which is orthogonal to |w\u3009 defined in terms of components of |w\u3009 in the standard basis as:\n|w\u22a5\u3009 = \u2212w\u03041 |0\u3009+ w\u03040 |1\u3009 (2)\nwhere the overbar indicates complex conjugation. Any state orthogonal to |s\u3009 will differ |s\u22a5\u3009 only by an overall phase factor. It is to be noted that |(s\u22a5)\u22a5\u3009, the orthogonal state of |s\u22a5\u3009, is not |s\u3009 but -|s\u3009. We use the symbol |s;m\u3009 to represent the product state |s\u3009\u2297 |m\u3009, where |s\u3009 is a unit vector in Hc, and |m\u3009 is the mth standard basis vector in Hw.\nAn arbitrary pure state in the composite spaceHc\u2297Hw is given by [54, 55]\n|P \u3009 = m=e\u2211 m=b pm |pm;m\u3009 (3)\nwhere |pm\u3009 are unit vectors in the coin-space Hc, and pm are non-negative real numbers. Given a composite state of the form Eq. (3), we define the integer interval [b, e] as its \u201cposition span\u201d, by which we mean that the probability amplitudes at all positions greater than e or less than b are all zero."

            "text": "Speaking of generalizing the quantum walks, one method has been to employ different coin operator at each step, so that in place of Eq.

Another generalization of Eq. (7) has been to have different step sizes for forward and backward motion. For instance, in refs. [18, 19, 57, 58], the conditional shift operator employed was the one of moving forward or staying still, depending upon the state of the coin. Owing to the translational symmetry of the problem, this shift operator is shown to be equivalent to the standard shift operator, in the sense that the resulting composite states in the both cases are identical, up to a relabeling of the position states. It is to be noted that replacing an SU(2) coin with a unitary one will not give access to any different set of states: a composite state accessible with a unitary coin is also accessible with an SU(2) coin. Therefore in the rest of the manuscript, we shall restrict our attention to only SU(2) coins. Further, there are generalizations of the discrete time quantum walks where the coins are site-dependent [22, 59, 60] or history-dependent [61\u201363]. Such treatment are also beyond the scope of this manuscript, as we intend to consider only those systems which can be readily implemented in the linear optics setting."

The coinoperator C\u0302(s, c) is completely equivalent to the coin op-\nerator C\u0302(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) defined in Eq. (5), only parameterized differently. Here we have parameterized it by two unit vectors c and s of the coin-space. The action of coin-toss operator C\u0302(s, c) is to unitarily transform the orthogonal pair of states |c\u3009 and |c\u22a5\u3009 to another orthogonal pair of states |s\u3009 and |s\u22a5\u3009, respectively. The shift operator S\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s) leaves a fraction of the state unaltered, and with the remaining fraction, it moves forward in the position space by p units if the coin-state is |s\u3009, and moves backwards by the same number of units if the coin-state is |s\u22a5\u3009. Simultaneously, it also transforms the coin-states |s\u3009 and |s\u22a5\u3009 into ei\u03b4 |s\u22a5\u3009 and \u2212e\u2212i\u03b4 |s\u3009 respectively. The action of T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c) on the orthogonal states |c;m\u3009 and |c\u22a5;m\u3009 is given by:\nT\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c) |c;m\u3009 = cos \u0393 2 |s;m\u3009+ sin \u0393 2 ei\u03b4 |s\u22a5;m+ p\u3009 ,\nT\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c) |c\u22a5;m\u3009 = cos \u0393\n2 |s\u22a5;m\u3009 \u2212 sin\n\u0393 2 e\u2212i\u03b4 |s;m\u2212 p\u3009\n(12) We shall regard Eq. (12) as the definition of the quan-\ntum step T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c), being completely equivalent to Eq. (11). Its action of T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c) on any other product state |w;m\u3009 can obtained by expressing |w\u3009 in the basis (|c\u3009 , |c\u22a5\u3009) and acting it linearly on them. Its action on an arbitrary composite state can be found by acting it on each of the constituent terms. In the quantum step T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c), we call the state |c\u3009 as its coin-state and |s\u3009\nas its shift state. Here, p is an integer indicating the step size of the walk. The presence of \u0393 makes the quantum step very different from that of Eq. (4) as only a fraction of the state now undergoes the quantum walk, with \u0393 determining that fraction: \u0393 = \u03c0 leading to complete state transfer, while \u0393 = 0 corresponds to no change in the walk space. Such walks have been termed \u201chybrid walks\u201d in literature [64]. While \u0393 can range from [0, 4\u03c0),\nit is easy to see that T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c) = T\u03024\u03c0\u2212\u0393(\u03c0 + \u03b4, p, s, c) and therefore can be restricted to \u0393 to [0, 2\u03c0]. The quantum steps T\u03020(\u00b7, \u00b7, s, c), i.e., the steps with \u0393 = 0 refer only to SU(2) transformation from c to s, acting only on the coin-space:\nT\u03020(\u00b7, \u00b7, s, c) = C\u0302(s, c)\u2297 Iw (13)\nwhere C\u0302(s, c) is the operator defined in the first of Eq. (11). The step-size p and the relative phase \u03b4 in this case are immaterial, and hence they are suppressed in Eq. (13). We call these steps as the \u201cimproper steps\u201d, as against the steps with \u0393 > 0 and p 6= 0, which we call as the \u201cproper steps\u201d. The quantum step Eq. (12) is such that, in one proper step at most only two other states at a fixed distance (\u00b1p) from the current state, are accessed. We shall regard the step defined in Eq. (12) as the most generalized quantum walk step. This claim requires some justification, since we still have the same step-size p in both forward and backward directions. This definition of a quantum step is the most general, in the sense that any further relaxation in the definition will be inconsistent with the requirement of translational invariance. It is essential, for instance, that the coinstates at the mth and (m\u00b1p)th positions appearing in the\n4 right hand side of Eq. (12) be orthogonal to each other. Likewise, having distinct step sizes in the forward and backward directions is not consistent with translational invariance, unless \u0393 is fixed to \u03c0. In this manuscript, we have made a choice to force identical step size in the forward and backward directions, retaining the facility to have a variable \u0393 instead. This choice is motivated by the linear optics implementation, to be introduced in Section VII. It must be noted that the second relation in Eq. (12) is not independent, but follows directly from\nthe first, by requiring that T\u0302 act as an SU(2) operator in the composite space. We represent a collection of M such steps by the symbol W\u0302\nW\u0302 = T\u0302\u0393M (\u03b4M , pm, sm, cm) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 T\u0302\u03931(\u03b41, p1, s1, c1) (14)\nWe call these sequences of such steps W\u0302 as the \u201cquantum walk\u201d. The walk W\u0302 acts on the states from the left. We shall consider the dimension of walk-space to be larger than N = max(|b|, |e|) of all the involved composite states, and also larger than |p1|+ |p2|+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |pM | of all the involved steps.\nB. Identifying states obtained by quantum walks\nA quantum walk of M -steps, starting from an arbitrary home-state |u; 0\u3009, can be described as:\nW\u0302 |u, 0\u3009 = |U\u3009 = m=e\u2211 m=b um |um;m\u3009 (15)\nNote that not all steps in W\u0302 are of equal step size. The position span [b, e] of |U\u3009 depends on the details of the steps, and also on the initial coin-state |u\u3009. All that can be said is that max(|b|, |e|) \u2264 (|p1| + |p2| + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |pM |), where pi is the step size of the i\nth step. The state on the RHS is a unit vector of the form Eq. (3). We now derive a condition that such states have to satisfy. From translation symmetry, if W\u0302 |u; 0\u3009 = |U\u3009 then W\u0302 |u; d\u3009 = |U+d\u3009, where d is an integer and |U+d\u3009 is |U\u3009 shifted on the walk forward en-mass by d units:\n|U+d\u3009 = n=e\u2211 n=b un |un;n+ d\u3009 (16)\nSince |u; 0\u3009 and |u; d\u3009 are orthogonal, and since the walk operator W\u0302 is an SU(2) operator, we demand the resulting states |U\u3009 and |U+d\u3009 to also be orthogonal, \u3008U |U+d\u3009 = 0, for all d 6= 0. The non-trivial d being d = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , e\u2212 b, leading to e\u2212 b constraints: \u3008U |Ud\u3009 = m=e\u2212d\u2211 m=b umum+d\u3008um|um+d\u3009 = 0,\u2200d = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , e\u2212b (17) This result limits the composite states that can be obtained by quantum walks: not all states of the composite\nspace are accessible by quantum walks. We shall refer to the composite states satisfying the constraints of Eq. (17) as the \u201cwalk-states\u201d, and those composite states not satisfying them as the \u201cnon-walk-states\u201d. For instance, consider the product states in the composite space H. They are of the form |u\u3009 \u2297 |s\u3009, where |u\u3009 \u2208 span(|0\u3009 , |1\u3009) and |s\u3009 \u2208 span(\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , |\u22121\u3009 , |0\u3009 , |1\u3009 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ). Of these, the only possible translation invariant product states are of the form |u;m\u3009, where |m\u3009 \u2208 (\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , |\u22121\u3009 , |0\u3009 , |1\u3009 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ). Likewise, a composite state with only two non-zero OAM components, |W \u3009 = wb |wb; b\u3009 + we |we; e\u3009 is a walkstate only if the two constituent coin-states are orthogonal: \u3008wb|we\u3009 = 0. Likewise, a composite state |X\u3009 consisting of three constituent terms: |X\u3009 = xb |xb; b\u3009+ xm |xm;m\u3009+xe |xe; e\u3009 where b, m and e are integers and xb, xm and xe are real numbers such that x 2 b +x 2 m+x 2 e = 1, is a walk-state only if\nm = b+ e\n2 ,\n|xm\u3009 = 1\u221a\nx2e + x 2 b\n( ei\u03b4xe |xb\u3009 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03b4xb |xe\u3009 ) ,\n\u3008xb|xe\u3009 = 0\nwhere \u03b4 is an arbitrary phase. This is an interesting result, with respect to the state engineering aspect of the quantum walks. The first of these restricts the possible occupied positions of a three-term walk-state. It is not possible via quantum walks to access composite states where, for instance, only the |0\u3009, |1\u3009 and |3\u3009 position states are occupied. And this is true irrespective of the corresponding amplitudes of occupation x0, x1 and x2 and the coin-states |x0\u3009, |x1\u3009 and |x3\u3009. Consider now the four component state\n|Y \u3009 = yb |yb; b\u3009+ ym |ym;m\u3009+ yn |yn;n\u3009+ ye |ye; e\u3009 ,\nwhere b, m, n and e are integers and yb, ym, yn and ye are non-zero real numbers such that y2b + y 2 m + y 2 n + y 2 e = 1. It follows from Eq. (17) that |Y \u3009 is a walk-state, if and only if m \u2212 b = e \u2212 n. Further, if e \u2212 b 6= m \u2212 b(= e \u2212 n), then it is a walk-state only if the amplitudes satisfy the relation ybym = ye yn , and the coin-states satisfy the relations \u3008yb|ym\u3009 = \u3008ym|yn\u3009 = \u3008yn|ye\u3009 = 0 and \u3008yb|yn\u3009 + \u3008ym|ye\u3009 = 0.

If a walk W\u0302 generates |U\u3009, then |U\u00d7d\u3009 can be generated by changing the step size pi of each step T\u0302\u0393i(\u03b4i, pi,ui, ci) of W\u0302 by pi \u00d7 d. Recall that the action of a linear operator on an N - dimensional space gets fixed only by specifying its action on N linearly independent vectors. In case of the walk operator, however, once the action of W\u0302 on any state |u; 0\u3009 is specified, as in Eq. (15), then its action on any other state, be it a home-state, a product-state or a composite-state, gets fixed, owing to its being SU(2) and translationally invariant. Particularly, between orthogonal home-states we have the following relation:\nif W\u0302 |u; 0\u3009 = |U\u3009 , then W\u0302 |u\u22a5; 0\u3009 = |U\u22a5\u3009\n(19)\nwhere, for a given |U\u3009, the composite state |U\u22a5\u3009 is defined as\n|U\u22a5\u3009 = m=\u2212b\u2211 m=\u2212e u\u2212m |(u\u2212m)\u22a5;m\u3009 (20)\nwhere |(u\u2212m)\u22a5\u3009 is the state orthogonal to |u\u2212m\u3009. It is easy to see that the walk-states |U\u3009 and |U\u22a5\u3009 are orthogonal to each other. Further, they share the same characteristic vector, \u2212\u2192p (U) = \u2212\u2192p (U\u22a5). Given a walk-state |U\u3009, we can construct another walk-state |U\u22a5\u3009, and two other families of walk-states |U+d\u3009 and |U\u00d7d\u3009 by shifting and scaling the walk position labels respectively. Furthermore, any complex linear combination of the walk-states |U\u3009 and\n\u2223\u2223(U\u22a5)+d\u232a is also a legitimate walk-state for any d.

We now discuss the conditions that these walks states must satisfy if they are so related. The position-spans of |P \u3009 and |Q\u3009 are not of much help here: two composite states may well share the same position span, but might not have originated from the same walk, or they might have different position-spans but have originated from the same walk. For instance, the first and\nsecond states on the RHS of Eq. (12) have different position spans, [b, b+m] and [b\u2212m, b] respectively, but they have originated from the same walk, T\u0302 . One necessary condition that can be derived on the basis of positionspan is that N = max(|b|, |e|) of both the states be identical. We now derive another necessary condition. For this, we first recall that the states |p; 0\u3009 and |q; d\u3009 are orthogonal in the composite state, for any d 6= 0, independent of the relation between the coin-states |p\u3009 and |q\u3009.

(16).\nFor obtaining another necessary condition, given a composite state |U\u3009, with the span [b, e], we an define an N + 1-dimensional probability mass function \u2212\u2192p (U), where N = max(|b|, |e|) as:\n\u2212\u2192p (U) = (f0, f1, f2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , fN ) (21)\nwhere fm = um 2 + u2\u2212m, where um are amplitudes at the position m in the composite state |U\u3009.

A necessary and also sufficient condition for two walk-states |P \u3009 and |Q\u3009 being output of the same walk is that |\u3008P |Q\u3009|2 + |\u3008P |Q\u22a5\u3009|2 = 1."

TARGETED QUANTUM WALKS\nIt is to be noted that a quantum walk W\u0302 preserves the translational invariance of composite states: it takes walk-states to walk-states and non-walk-states to nonwalk-states. Given a step T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c), we define its inverse [T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c)] \u22121 as the operator that undoes the action of T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c). The inverse of a quantum step is also a quantum step. It is easy to see that:\n[T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c)] \u22121 = T\u0302\u0393(\u03c0 + \u03b4, p, c, s) (24)\nSince each step of this walk is invertible, the walk W\u0302 itself is invertible. So, given any walk-state there always exist quantum walks that takes it to any of the homestates. Further, we show that it is always possible to do it using exactly N number of p = 1 quantum steps, where N = max(|b|, |e|)."

We start with the simplest case first: when the composite state is of a single term |u;m\u3009. A quantum step T\u0302\u03c0(0, 1, s,u\u22a5) on |u;m\u3009 yields |s;m\u2212 1\u3009. Now, from here, taking m\u2212 1 steps of T\u0302\u03c0(0, 1, s, s\u22a5), we land on the home-state |s; 0\u3009:\n|s; 0\u3009 = T\u0302\u03c0(0, 1, s, s\u22a5) m\u22121 T\u0302\u03c0(0, 1, s,u\u22a5) |u;m\u3009 (25)\nWe now consider the case of reducing an arbitrary walkstate |U\u3009 to some home-state |u; 0\u3009. We achieve using a recursive method: we find a walk step T\u03021, that can convert the given state |U\u3009 of walk-spread [b, e] into a composite beam |U1\u3009 of a shorter spread [b + 1, e \u2212 1]. This is always possible if |U\u3009 is a walk-state. One set of parameters of T\u03021 that accomplishes this is given by (see appendix):\n|c\u3009 = |ue\u22a5\u3009 , \u0393 = 2 tan\u22121 (\nue ue\u22121|\u3008ue\u22a5|ue\u22121\u3009|\n) ,\n\u03b4 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a6(\u3008ue\u22a5|ue\u22121\u3009).\n(26)\nNow, note that the ensuing state |U1\u3009 is also a walkstate, having obtained through a quantum step on a walkstate. It can also be reduced to another composite state |U2\u3009 whose spread is [b+ 2, e\u2212 2], by using another walk step T\u03022, whose parameters can be computed in a similar manner as in Eq. (26). Proceeding this way for a total e\u2212b\n2 steps if b and e are of same parity, or for e\u2212b+1\n2 steps if they are of different parity, one lands in a separable state |u; p\u3009, where p is equal to b+e2 in the former case and b+e\u221212 in the latter case. Now, if p = 0, we are at home, and therefore have accomplished what we have\nset out to. Otherwise, transform |u; p\u3009 into |s; 0\u3009 in p steps as in Eq. (25). Therefore, in either case, in a total of N = max(|b|, |e|) steps it is possible to reduce a composite state of spread [b, e] into a home-state:\nT\u0302N \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 T\u03022T\u03021 |U\u3009 = |u; 0\u3009 (27)\nThe composite state |U\u3009 can therefore be constructed from a home-state |u\u3009 by taking the inverse of those N steps, in the opposite order:\n|U\u3009 = W\u0302min |u; 0\u3009 (28)\nwhere\nW\u0302min = T\u0302 \u22121 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 T\u0302 \u22121 N , (29)\nwith the inverse of a walk step T\u0302 given by Eq.

(1) can be elegantly described on the surface of a unit sphere called the Bloch Sphere (which in the polarization setting is termed as the Poincare sphere [65]). This treatment, in addition to providing a visualization of quantum states, also aids in giving a geometric picture of the action of SU(2) operators on such quantum states. In the polarization setting, the notion of Poincare sphere has been extended to represent the composite states like Eq. (3), but limited to only two terms [66],[67]. A well-known limitation of all these representations has been that they represent a quantum states only up to an overall phase factor. In this paper, we introduce a new graphical way of indicating coin-states |w\u3009 of the form Eq. (1). States of the form 1\u221a\n2\n( ei\u03b80 |0\u3009+ ei\u03b81 |1\u3009 ) are depicted as a sin-\ngle purple-colored circle, of radius proportional to 1\u221a 2 , with yellow and cyan colored arrows making angles \u03b80 and \u03b81 with the x-axis respectively. States of the form ei\u03b8\u221a\n2 (|0\u3009+ |1\u3009) are depicted with a purple-colored circle\nof radius proportional to 1\u221a 2 with a single white-colored arrow making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis. The rest of the states, we indicate in terms of the two complex numbers, w0 and w1, the component of |w\u3009 along |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 unit vectors respectively. We represent these complex numbers as two concentric green and red circles of radii proportional to |w0| and |w1| respectively. The phase of these complex numbers are indicated by yellow and cyan colored arrows over these circles, the angles they make with the horizontal indicative of their phases. This representation can be carried over to the composite states as well. We depict them as follows: on the y-axis we mark the walk-space basis states |m\u3009 from m \u2208 [b, e]. At every m with non-zero um, the corresponding coinstate |um\u3009 is depicted as described above, except that the radii of these circles is scaled by the amplitude um. This representation of composite states, while by no means as versatile as that of Poincare Sphere, will nevertheless serve us well to better illustrate the results derived earlier in the manuscript.\n8"

The position span of the emerging composite state is [\u22123, 3]. This state can therefore be obtained from the home-state in just three p = 1 steps, using the shrinking algorithm. This three-step minimal walk is depicted in Fig. (3).\nF. Illustrations of the shrinking algorithm\nAs illustration of the shrinking algorithm of subsection (IV A), we show the evolution of home-states into each of the four walk-states of Eq. (35). The characteristic vector (defined in Eq.

The two states differ only by an overall phase factor. Despite of that, the quantum walk W\u0302 that accomplishes the transformation, W\u0302 |U\u3009 = ei\u2206 |U\u3009, is far from trivial, unless \u2206 = 0 or \u03c0. This can be understood as follows: |U\u3009 can be taken to ei\u2206 |U\u3009 by transforming each constituent term |um\u3009 of |U\u3009 to ei\u2206 |um\u3009.

The walk that accomplishes this can be obtained by the minimization procedure elaborated above. The four step minimal quantum walk is shown in Fig. (5).

We identify the states |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 with |l\u3009 and |r\u3009, the left and right circular polarization states of light respectively. The states |h\u3009,|v\u3009, |d\u3009 and |a\u3009, defined following Eq. (35), will then correspond to horizontal, vertical, diagonal and anti-diagonal SoPs of light, respectively. In our numerical simulations, the |h\u3009 and |v\u3009 states correspond to the standard basis vectors [1, 0]T and [0, 1]T respectively. The left and right circular SoPs |l\u3009 and |r\u3009 would then correspond to the column vectors [1, i]T and [i, 1]T respectively. Unitary transformations between pairs of SoPs is affected using waveplates. In this paper, we represent them by the symbol p\u0302\u0393(\u03b1), where \u0393 is its retardance, and \u03b1 is the angle its fast-axis makes with the x-axis. The action of this waveplate on an arbitrary state of polarization |u\u3009 is given by:\np\u0302\u0393(\u03b1) |u\u3009 =\u2212 sin \u0393\n2 \u3008r|u\u3009e\u22122i\u03b1 |l\u3009\n+ cos \u0393 2 |u\u3009+ sin \u0393 2 \u3008l|u\u3009e2i\u03b1 |r\u3009\n(38)\nHere \u3008l|u\u3009 and \u3008r|u\u3009 stand for the left and right circular polarization components of |u\u3009. It is important to note it is always possible to transform one SOP to another SOP \u201cup to a phase\u201d using a single waveplate. That is: given a pair of SoPs |u\u3009 and |s\u3009, there exists a waveplate p\u0302\u0393(\u03b1) such that p\u0302\u0393(\u03b1) |u\u3009 = ei\u03b4 |s\u3009 where \u03b4 is an extra phase factor. The \u0393, \u03b1 of the waveplate needed for this transformation, and the additional phase factor \u03b4 generated in this process, can be derived from Eq. (38). Furthermore, it always possible to transform |u\u3009 to |s\u3009, without any additional phase factors, by using a three-plate gadget consisting of a half-wave plate inserted in between two quarter-wave plates ([69, 70]).\nA vector beam is a light beam whose SoP varies across its transverse plane. In this work, we shall confine our attention to only cases where the variation is only along\nthe azimuthal direction. We therefore ignore the radial co-ordinate in the rest of our discussion. The SoP of a vector beam will be represented as |u(\u03d5)\u3009 where \u03d5 is the azimuthal angle, measured from some reference axis, say the x-axis. It can be represented as in Eq. (1):\n|u(\u03d5)\u3009 = ul(\u03d5) |l\u3009+ ur(\u03d5) |r\u3009 (39)\nwhere ul(\u03d5) and ur(\u03d5) are complex functions of the azimuthal angle \u03d5, satisfying the normalization requirement |ul(\u03d5)|2 + |ur(\u03d5)|2 = 1. If the coefficients ul(\u03d5) and ur(\u03d5) depend identically on \u03d5 as e\nim\u03d5, for some integer m, we say the light beam carries an OAM of m units. We represent such states by the symbol |u;m\u3009:\n|u;m\u3009 = |u\u3009 \u2297 |m\u3009 = eim\u03d5 |u\u3009 (40)\nwhere m is an integer and |u\u3009 is an SoP of the form Eq. (1), having no azimuthal dependence. We refer to such light beams as scalar light beams. The SoPs along two different azimuthal angles on the transverse plane of such scalar light beams differ only in their overall global phase. An arbitrary vector beam of the form Eq. (39) can be decomposed as a superposition of a collection of such scalar beams, resulting in a composite state |W \u3009 of the form Eq. (3). The Jones vector of its mth OAM component and its amplitude can be extracted from |u(\u03d5)\u3009 as\num |um\u3009 = \u222b 2\u03c0\n0\ne\u2212im\u03d5 |u(\u03d5)\u3009 d\u03d5,\u2200m \u2208 [b, e] (41)\nThe limits b and e in Eq. (41) are the smallest and largest m that yield non-zero um. We shall confine our attention to only those u(\u03d5) for which the b and e are finite, i.e., only those vector beams which are constructed out of a superposition of a finite number of scalar beams. In such a case, there is a one-to-one correspondence between vector beams having a spatially SoP of the form Eq. (39) and composite quantum state of the form Eq. (3), |u(\u03d5)\u3009 \u2194 |U\u3009, with Eq. (41) establishing the mapping. The corresponding orthogonal states also follow the same mapping |u(\u03d5)\u22a5\u3009 \u2194 |U\u22a5\u3009, where |u(\u03d5)\u22a5\u3009 is\n12\nobtained through |u(\u03d5)\u3009 from Eq. (2), and |U\u22a5\u3009 is obtained through |U\u3009 using Eq. (20). A prominent method of generating such vector light beams has been using optical interferometers[71, 72] with spatial light modulators[73\u201376]. They have also been generated by employing inhomogenous waveplates called q-plates [77, 78] which are waveplates with uniform retardance, but whose orientation of the fast axis varies linearly with the azimuthal angle. We represent such qplates with the symbol q\u0302\u0393 (q, \u03b10), where \u0393 is called the retardance, q is called the topological charge, and \u03b10 is the offset-angle [79]. The import of these parameters can be understood by knowing its action on an arbitrary separable state |u;m\u3009:\nq\u0302\u0393 (q, \u03b10) |u;m\u3009 =\u2212 sin \u0393\n2 \u3008r|u\u3009e\u22122i\u03b10 |l;m\u2212 2q\u3009\n+ cos \u0393 2 |u;m\u3009+ sin \u0393 2\n\u3008l|u\u3009e2i\u03b10 |r;m+ 2q\u3009\n(42) A q-plate of topological charge q and retardance \u03c0 is called as the standard q-plate. It raises the OAM of the left circular component of the input light beam by 2q units and simultaneously reduces the OAM of its right circular component by 2q units. The inverses of p\u0302\u0393(\u03b1) and q\u0302\u0393 (q, \u03b10) are given by\np\u0302\u0393(\u03b1) \u22121 = p\u0302\u0393(\u03b1+\n\u03c0 2 ),\nq\u0302\u0393 (q, \u03b10) \u22121 = q\u0302\u0393 ( q, \u03b10 + \u03c0\n2 ) (43) A standard method for representing an SoP has been as polarization ellipses [68]. In this notation, the SoPs are depicted as ellipses, with ellipsisity e and orientation \u03c6 given by:\ne = \u2223\u2223\u2223|\u3008l|u\u3009|2 \u2212 |\u3008r|u\u3009|2\u2223\u2223\u2223 ,\n\u03c6 = \u03a6 (\u3008r|u\u3009)\u2212 \u03a6 (\u3008l|u\u3009) + \u03c0 4 .\n(44)\nThese definitions are not standard, but have been employed here due to their simplicity. The color of the ellipse indicates the helicity of SoP: states with |\u3008l|u\u3009| > |\u3008r|u\u3009|) are colored green and those with |\u3008l|u\u3009| < |\u3008r|u\u3009| are colored red. States with |\u3008l|u\u3009| = |\u3008r|u\u3009| are depicted as purple-colored arrows. Recall that the polarization ellipses representation depicts an SoP only upto a phase. In this paper, the azimuthally-varying SoP of the vector beams is depicted in both the methods: (i) as polarization ellipses and (ii) as concentric circles introduced in subsection (VI A). To map the two representations: the circular polarizations are represented by green and red circles in both the representations. Purple circles in the concentric-circles representation corresponds to purple arrows in the elliptical representation. In Figs. (6) and (7), we provide a quick overview of the action of \u0393 = \u03c02 and \u0393 = \u03c0 q-plates on four linearlypolarized scalar light beams. These serve not only in giving a quick recall of the functioning of q-plates, but\nalso in connecting our new notation of representing the SoPs, with the standard polarization ellipses representation."

Since the intial state is normalized, and the involved q-plates and waveplates are all unitary, an immediate constraint on the emerging vector beams |U\u3009 is that \u3008U |U\u3009 = 1 at all azimuthal angles \u03d5: \u3008u(\u03d5)|u(\u03d5)\u3009 = \u3008U |U\u3009 = \u2211 m,n umun\u3008um|un\u3009ei(m\u2212n)\u03d5 = 1 (45) This seemingly innocuous normalization requirement leads to e\u2212 b+ 1 constraints on the constituent polarizations and OAM amplitudes, which are exactly identical to that of Eq. (17). Therefore, this leads us to conclude that all normalized composite states in the SAM-OAM space of the light beams are walk-states. For instance, the vector beams corresponding to the six states of Eq.\n13\n(35) are depicted in Fig. (8). In each of these eight plots, we have plotted the right circular component |\u3008r|U\u3009|2 in red line, the left circular component |\u3008l|U\u3009|2 in green, and their sum, in blue, for |U\u3009 being one of the eight states |A\u3009 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , |H\u3009 respectively. It is evident that in all the six walk-states, the sum of the field intensity components, i.e., the blue plot, remains at 1 at all azimuthal angles, whereas in case of the non-walk-states |E\u3009 and |F \u3009, the total field intensity varies with the azimuthal angle, exceeding 1 at some azimuth and subceeding 1 at other azimuths. In the rest of this section, we shall focus our attention to such normalized vector beams only. The aim now is to generate vector beams using only waveplates and q-plates. With respect to DTQWs, the standard q-plates mimic the standard shift operator, Eq. (6), except that here apart from altering the OAM of the light, the standard q-plate also swaps the circular polarization components. A q-plate with \u0393 6= \u03c0 functions like a standard q-plate but only on a fraction sin \u03932 of the incident light beam. Currently, q-plates whose retardance \u0393 can be tuned by varying the applied voltage have been designed [80, 81] and are also commercially available [82]. In this context, the effective behavior of a collection of three waveplates and q-plates has been explored in Ref. [83] and Ref. [79]. To make connection between the q-plate and the quantum step of Eq. (12), we have the\nfollowing relation: q\u0302\u0393 (q, \u03b10) = T\u0302\u0393 (2\u03b10, 2q, l, l). It is possible to implement the quantum step T\u0302\u03c0, that T\u0393 of Eq. (12) with \u0393 = \u03c0, using a pair of waveplates and a single q-plate:\nT\u0302\u03c0(\u03b4, p, s, c) \u2261 p\u0302\u03932 (\u03b12)q\u0302\u03c0 ( p 2 , \u03b10)p\u0302\u03931 (\u03b11) (46)\nwhere the parameters of the plate are given as: \u03931 = 2 tan \u22121 ( |\u3008r|c\u3009| |\u3008l|c\u3009| ) ,\n\u03b11 = \u03c0\n2 +\n1 2 (\u03a6(\u3008r|c\u3009)\u2212 \u03a6(\u3008l|c\u3009)) ,\n\u03b10 = 1\n2 (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03a6(\u3008l|c\u3009)\u2212 \u03a6(\u3008l|s\u3009)), \u03932 = 2 tan \u22121 ( |\u3008r|s\u3009| |\u3008l|s\u3009| ) ,\n\u03b12 = 1\n2 (\u03a6(\u3008r|s\u3009)\u2212 \u03a6(\u3008l|s\u3009))\n(47)\nThe three-plate gadget involving a q\u03c0 plate introduced through Eqs. (46) and (47) can reproduce any T\u0302\u03c0 quantum step. Replacing the q\u03c0 plate with a q\u0393 plate, it can even reproduce any T\u0302\u0393 quantum step of Eq. (12), but only if \u03a6(\u3008l|c\u3009) = \u03a6(\u3008l|s\u3009). This may appear as an obstacle in our attempt to obtain desired vector beams by means of quantum walks. However, recall that the shrinking algorithm places no restriction on the shift state |s\u3009. We can exploit this freedom on |s\u3009, not only to overcome the restriction on phase, but also to get rid of one of the plates altogether. The choice of |s\u3009 = ei\u03a6(\u3008l|c\u3009) |l\u3009 satisfies the phase relation and also ensures that \u03932 = 0, so that it need not be used at all, and\none can work with only a pair of homogeneous waveplate and q = 12 q-plate per step. A gadget for varying Berek Plate [65]\nC. Illustration of targeted quantum walks\nWe first provide an illustration of the shrinking algorithm for transforming the states |G\u3009 and |H\u3009 of Eqs. (36) and (37) into standard scalar light beams. Recall that N = max(|b|, |e|) of both the states is 5, hence they both can be reduced in five quantum steps, that is, five pair of waveplates and q-plates. The characteristic vectors of these states are \u2212\u2192p (G) = ( 0, 15 , 1 5 , 1 5 , 1 5 , 1 5\n) and \u2212\u2192p (H) = ( 1 10 , 1 5 , 1 5 , 1 5 , 1 5 , 1 10 ) respectively, and therefore they cannot be output of the same walk for different home-states. Fig. (9) shows the transverse plane polarization profiles of both the beams, as they progress through each pair of plates. The \u0393 and \u03b1/\u03b10 of these plates are so chosen that every pair of plates shrink the OAM span of the vector beam by one unit from either end. We now look to generate the vector beams corresponding to the four walk states |A\u3009 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , |D\u3009 of Eq. (35). Since N = 2 for all the four states, each of them can be generated from standard scalar light beams by using just two pairs of waveplates and q-plates. This conversion is demonstrated in Fig. (10).\n14\n15\n16\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this work we have considered a bipartite quantum system comprising of a qudit degree of freedom, coupled with a qubit degree of freedom. In such a composite system, we have examined the set of quantum states that are accessible by quantum walks starting from some easy-toprepare product state. A major result coming out of the current work is that such broadest generalization of the definition of quantum walks does not give access to all the states on the composite Hilbert space. A simple criterion for identifying whether a given quantum state can be accessible through a quantum walk is provided based on the notion of translational invariance of a quantum state. Given such a walk-accessible state, a clear and deterministic algorithm for realizing it through discrete time quantum walks is also provided. The given construction is \u201cminimal\u201d, in that the given composite state cannot be obtained using fewer quantum steps of unit step size than what is given by the algorithm. To give a practical context to our theoretical results, in this paper, we have\ninterpreted them in the context of quantum walks on the Spin-and-Orbital angular momenta of light beams. We have demonstrated that, any azimuthally varying vector beam can be generated deterministically in such a quantum walk comprising of alternating waveplates and q = 12 q-plates. We believe that the results presented here will aid in designing better quantum-walk based algorithms for quantum state engineering, particularly in the linear optical implementation of discrete-time quantum walks."

            "text": "Here, given a walk-state |U\u3009 of position span [b, e], we find the paramters of the quantum step T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c) such that the composite state T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c) |U\u3009 has a position span of [b + 1, e \u2212 1]. Let |R\u3009 = T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, p, s, c) |U\u3009. The amplitude at the mth position rm and the coin-state there |rm\u3009 can be obtained by Eq. (12) as\nrm |rm\u3009 = ( um\u3008c|um\u3009 cos \u0393\n2 \u2212 um+1\u3008c\u22a5|um+1\u3009 sin\n\u0393 2 e\u2212i\u03b4\n) |s\u3009+ ( um\u3008c\u22a5|um\u3009 cos \u0393\n2 + um\u22121\u3008c|um\u22121\u3009 sin\n\u0393 2 ei\u03b4 ) |s\u22a5\u3009\n(A1)\nWe chose the parameters of T\u0302\u0393(\u03b4, 1, s, c) such that (i) (e + 1)th and eth positions of |R\u3009 are unoccupied, that is, re+1 = 0 and re = 0, and (ii) the b\nth and (b\u2212 1)th positions of |R\u3009 are also unoccupied, that is, rb\u22121 = 0 and rb = 0.\n\u3008c|ue\u3009 = 0,\ntan \u0393\n2 = ue|\u3008c\u22a5|ue\u3009| ue\u22121|\u3008c|ue\u22121\u3009| , \u03b4 = \u03c0 + \u03a6(\u3008c\u22a5|ue\u3009)\u2212 \u03a6(\u3008c|ue\u22121\u3009)\n(A2)\nNote that we are dealing with quantum walk steps of unit size, p = 1. The contribution to the amplitude at the (e+1)th position of |R\u3009 is therefore only from that of eth position of |U\u3009 alone. The first condition ensures that this contribution is 0. The amplitude of eth component of |R\u3009, on the other hand, gets contributions from both eth and (e\u2212 1)th components of |U\u3009. The chosen \u0393 and \u03b1 of T\u0302 are such that the two contributions are equal and out of phase, so that they cancel each other. In a similar manner, the condition that the bth and (b\u2212 1)th positions are unoccupied in |R\u3009 leads to the following three conditions on the step parameters:\n\u3008c\u22a5|ub\u3009 = 0,\ntan \u0393\n2 = ub|\u3008c|ub\u3009| ub+1|\u3008(ub)\u22a5|ub+1\u3009| , \u03b4 = \u03a6(\u3008c|ub\u3009)\u2212 \u03a6(\u3008(ub)\u22a5|ub+1\u3009)\n(A3)\nThe contribution to (b \u2212 1)th of |R\u3009 is from bth component of |U\u3009 alone, and the first condition ensures that this contribution is 0. The bth component of |R\u3009, gets contributions from both the bth and (b \u2212 1)th components of |U\u3009 and the \u0393 and \u03b1 of the step T\u0302 ensure that these two contributions cancel each other. The step of Eq. (A2), acting on a composite state |U\u3009 changes its position spread from [b, e] to [b \u2212 1, e \u2212 1] and, likewise, the step of Eq. (A3) changes the position span from [b, e] to [b+ 1, e+ 1]. We are interested in shrinking the span to [b + 1, e \u2212 1], so we seek a step whose parameters satisfy both sets of constraints simultaneously. For instance, the first of Eq. (A2) and the first of Eq. (A3) can be simultaneously satisfied only if \u3008ub|ue\u3009 = 0. This is not guaranteed for any arbitrary composite state of the form Eq. (3). We, however, are not dealing with arbitrary composite states, but the \u201cwalk-states\u201d satisfying Eq. (17), and for such states, it can be shown that the two set of conditions are indeed identical. We make a choice of |c\u3009 = |(ue)\u22a5\u3009, from which Eq. (26) follows.\n17\n[1] M.
