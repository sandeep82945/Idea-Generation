    "abstractText": "Researchers seeking for green chemistry to help safeguard and boost the economy and the environment by discovering unique ways to decrease waste and find substitutes for dangerous chemicals. In this study, a green potentiometric ion-selective electrode (ISE) was developed for measurement of tolperisone HCl (TOLP) in bulk and Pharmaceutical dosage forms in presence of diclofenac sodium and paracetamol as co-formulated drugs. This paper presents the manufacture and characterization of a disposable potentiometric ion-selective strip with an enhanced detection limit for (TOLP) measurement in its tablet dosage form either alone or in presence of the co-formulated drugs. Numerous ion pairs (IPs), such as TOLP-tetraphenylborate (TOLP-TPB), TOLP-phosphotungstic acid (TOLP-PTA), and TOLP-ammonium Reinecke (TOLPRKT) are tested in presence of different plasticizers. The optimal potentiometric response with a near Nernstian slope of 55.949 mV/decade was achieved within a linear concentration range of 5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 1 \u00d7 10 M using (PTA) and ortho nitrophenyl octyl ether (o-NPOE) as a plasticizer. The effect of the nanoparticles on the membrane stability was studied using the graphene nanoplatelets which have an effective role in the enhancement of some constructed sensors stability. Finally, the developed technique is validated for the estimation of TOLP with high accuracy and precision.",

            "text": "Tolperisone (TOLP) which is chemically designated as 2-Methyl- 1-(4-methylphenyl)-3-piperidin-1-ylpropan1-one hydrochloride (Fig.\u00a0 1), belongs to the centrally acting muscle relaxant group and it is prescribed for symptomatic treatment of spasticity, muscle spasm, and osteoarthritis[1]. The reason behind using TOLP in the management of osteoarthritis is suggested to be due to the myokines (released with muscle contraction during function) interaction with structures such as synovial tissue, cartilage, and bone at a molecular level. Two possible pathways by which skeletal muscles interconnect with neighboring joint structures have been hypothesized, including anti-inflammatory and pro-chondrogenic mechanisms [2]. TOLP should be cautiously prescribed to avoid its potential side effects. Thus, it is worthful to develop reliable and simple techniques for monitoring the concentration of TOLP in its pharmaceutical dosage forms. Literature review revealed that some analytical techniques such as chromatographic methods [3\u20136] and UV Spectrophotometry [7, 8] had been reported for estimation of TOLP in individual dosage forms and combination with other drugs. Even though good results were achieved, the proposed techniques are solvent and time-consuming and use costly instruments which are\nGraphical Abstract\nFig.1 Chemical structure of TOLP\nnot accessible in most laboratories for routine analysis [4\u20138]. Potentiometric ion-selective electrode (ISE) is a cost-effective analytical technique that can be employed for performing measurements in colored and turbid solutions [9, 10]. The classical (ISE) consists of a plastic membrane (usually made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) interpolated between two solutions. One of the two solutions is called the inner reference solution and it is composed of a constant concentration of the analyte; the other solution which is called the sample solution contains inconstant concentrations of the analyte. The potential of the constructed membrane is measured using two reference electrodes, usually Ag/ AgCl reference electrodes. Such strategy has numerous drawbacks: big size, large volume of the sample and special skills for construction [9]. The developments of solid-state ion-selective electrodes represent a possible approach to avoid the complications of the classical ISE as the solid-state ISEs have numerous advantages: simple configuration, small size, and small volume of the sample is required [11, 12]. The ion-selective membrane is directly contacted with the solid transducer surface so there is no need for the inner filling solution. In recent times, mass production of economical, movable, and reliable all-solid-state electrodes for pharmaceutical and environmental analysis has become a subject of interest [13]. Such electrodes have already been utilized for rapid and economic estimation of several pharmaceuticals and food additives [14\u201316] and biological valuable compounds [17].\nThis work aims to develop a disposable screenprinted ISE for measuring TOLP in pharmaceutical tablet dosage form alone or in presence of diclofenac sodium and paracetamol as co-formulated drugs. The ion exchanger and plasticizer were carefully chosen to optimize the potentiometric response. The electrode\u2019s potentiometric response was determined in accordance with IUPAC guidelines [18]. The developed electrodes were used as potentiometric indicator electrodes for the determination of TOLP in its pharmaceutical dosage forms."

After that; an accurately weighed amount of the resulted fine powder equivalent to 14.1\u00a0 mg was accurately transferred to 50\u00a0 mL volumetric flask that contains 30\u00a0 mL phosphate buffer (pH 4.50 \u00b1 0.05) and sonicated for 15\u00a0 min using the ultrasonic bath at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, then the solution was completed to the mark with the same solvent and filtered using 0.45\u00a0 \u03bcm disposable syringe filter. This solution is claimed to have a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\u20133\u00a0M TOLP. The selected sensor was used in combination with the Ag/ AgCl reference electrode to perform the potentiometric measurements and the concentration was calculated from the corresponding regression equation."

            "text": "Several aspects, including the kind of IP and the kind of plasticizer, influence the construction of polymeric membrane ISEs with an optimal potentiometric response. The IP is essential for thermodynamic ion exchange equilibrium to be established at the membrane/solution interface. As a result, it should be hydrophobic, essentially insoluble in water, and have reasonable stability over a wide pH range.\nIn\u2013the\u2014meantime, the immiscibility of the plasticizer in water is a must, it should be nonvolatile, and can dissolve the IP. TOLP-PTA as an ion exchanger and DBP as a plasticizer were used for the construction of (Sensor 1), this sensor gave a sub-Nernstian response of 51\u00a0mV/ concentration decade but unfortunately, this response was not reproducible. So, a thin layer of graphene nanoparticles was introduced under the casted membrane as a trial to overcome this problem. Since the graphene nanoparticles have intrinsic hydrophobicity and electric conductivity, moreover, it gives high potential stability [20] and this enhanced the reproducibility significantly and the slope increased from 51 to 53.019\u00a0mV/concentration decade (Sensor 2). Also, we had attempted to enhance the resulted slope by using a different plasticizer which is o-NPOE. Upon using this plasticizer the slope reached to 55.741\u00a0 mV/concentration decade (Sensor3) and the sensitivity was enhanced which reached to 5 \u00d7 10\u20135\u00a0 M instead of 1 \u00d7 10\u20134\u00a0M (Sensor1,2), this may be due to the higher dielectric constant of o-NPOE (\u025b o-NPOE = 24) [21] and the higher solubility of TOLP-PTA in this plasticizer in comparison with the DBP as it was noticed that mixing TOLP-PTA with DBP gave a turbid solution. Therefore, different amounts of TOLP-PTA were used to determine the optimal amount of the TOLP-PTA ion exchanger and to examine the constructed electrode\u2019s robustness. For each membrane composition, the calibration graph, the slope, and the linear range were determined. Over the concentration range of 5 \u00d7 10\u20135\u00a0\u2212\u00a0 1 \u00d7 10\u20132\u00a0M, the constructed sensors (Sensor 3 to 5) showed nearly small changes in slope (55.741 \u00b1 0.209) mV/ concentration decade. The slope was almost unaffected by the minor variation in the amount of TOLP-PTA demonstrating that the constructed electrode has reasonable robustness and the small variation in the quantity of TOLP-PTA in the membrane has little effect on the electrode\u2019s potentiometric properties as shown in Fig.\u00a02. Other IPs including TOLP-TPB and TOLP-RNK were also investigated and\nboth sensors displayed slope of 29.5 (Sensor 6) and 50.5 (Sensor 8) mV/concentration decade, respectively using DBP. When using o-NPOE as a plasticizer (Sensor 7), a slope of 29.9 mv/concentration decade was obtained, which is like the slope of Sensor 6. The dramatic decrease in the resulted slope of TOLP-TPB with both plasticizers may be attributed to the leaching of TOLP-TPB from the membrane upon contacting the electrode with the solution. So, Sensor 4 was used for further characterization. All the above-obtained results are summarized in Table\u00a01.\nEffect of\u00a0pH It is very important to measure the electrode potential in the pH range at which the variation in the potential due to variation in TOLP concentration is independent\non the pH. So, we studied the effect of the pH on the performance of the selected sensor using two different concentrations 1 \u00d710\u22124 and 1 \u00d710\u22123\u00a0 M. The pH of the investigated solution was varied utilizing HCl and/or NaOH solutions. In the pH range from 4 to 6, the emf was unaffected by the pH. At pH\u02c2 4, there was a very minor shift in emf values, which might be attributable to H+ interference. At pH > 6, there was a significant shift in emf values as shown in Fig.\u00a03.So that the measured solutions were prepared in phosphate buffer adjusted to pH (4.50 \u00b1 0.05)."

The reading was stable, and it was not changed even to a minor change over the investigated time indicating high potential stability of the selected electrode as shown in Fig.\u00a05.

Using (SSM), the selectivity coefficients of the TOLP sensor to a range of interfering chemicals were determined. As mentioned above, TOLP is formulated alone or combined with diclofenac sodium or paracetamol, so it is very important to investigate the interference of these drugs during the determination of TOLP, as a consequence, the logarithmic values of the selectivity coefficient were calculated using SSM for these two drugs and they were found to be \u2212\u00a03.45 and \u2212\u00a02.77 for diclofenac sodium and paracetamol, respectively as illustrated in Table\u00a0 2. These small logarithmic values of the selectivity coefficient indicating high selectivity of the electrode to TOLP in presence of these two drugs. When primary and interfering ions are present at the same time in practical applications, the electrode may behave substantially differently than when only one kind of ion is present. However, the results obtained during analysis of synthetic mixtures including varying ratios of the studied drug to co-formulated drug revealed that the chosen sensor may be utilized successfully for selective measurement of TOLP in the presence of either diclofenac sodium or paracetamol as co-formulated drugs as shown in Table\u00a0 3.
