    "abstractText": "This paper introduces the TRANSFORM project, which aims to improve access tomental health services for people with serious and enduring mental disorders (SMDs \u2013 psychotic disorders and severe mood disorders, often with co-occurring substance misuse) living in urban slums in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Ibadan (Nigeria). People living in slum communities have high rates of SMDs, limited access to mental health services and conditions of chronic hardship. Help is commonly sought from faith-based and traditional healers, but people with SMDs require medical treatment, support and follow-up. This multicentre, international mental health mixed-methods research project will (a) conduct community-based ethnographic assessment using participatory methods to explore community understandings of SMDs and help-seeking; (b) explore the role of traditional and faith-based healing for SMDs, from the perspectives of people with SMDs, caregivers, community members, healers, community health workers (CHWs) and health professionals; (c) co-design, with CHWs and healers, training packages for screening, early detection and referral to mental health services; and (d) implement and evaluate the training packages for clinical and cost-effectiveness in improving access to treatment for those with SMDs. TRANSFORM will develop and test a sustainable intervention that can be integrated into existing clinical care and inform priorities for healthcare providers and policy makers.",

Read, Bulbul Ashraf Siddiqi, Mamta Sood, Tanjir Rashid Soron and Helal Uddin Ahmed\nSummary This paper introduces the TRANSFORM project, which aims to improve access tomental health services for people with serious and enduring mental disorders (SMDs \u2013 psychotic disorders and severe mood disorders, often with co-occurring substance misuse) living in urban slums in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Ibadan (Nigeria). People living in slum communities have high rates of SMDs, limited access to mental health services and conditions of chronic hardship. Help is commonly sought from faith-based and traditional healers, but people with SMDs require medical treatment, support and follow-up. This multicentre, international mental health mixed-methods research project will (a) conduct community-based ethnographic assessment using participatory methods to explore community understandings of SMDs and help-seeking; (b) explore the role of traditional and faith-based healing for SMDs, from the perspectives of people with SMDs, caregivers, community members, healers, community health workers (CHWs) and health professionals; (c) co-design, with CHWs and healers, training packages for screening, early detection and referral to mental health services; and (d) implement and evaluate the training packages for clinical and cost-effectiveness in improving access to treatment for those with SMDs. TRANSFORM will develop and test a sustainable intervention that can be integrated into existing clinical care and inform priorities for healthcare providers and policy makers.

For instance, in Bangladesh 2.64% of gross domestic product (GDP) is spent on health, which is the lowest in the South Asia region,7 and of the overall annual health budget, only 0.05% is designated for mental health.8 Yet the world\u2019s population living in slums reached 1 billion in 2018, and is projected to hit 3 billion by 2030, with the majority located in LMICs where the treatment gap is already huge.9\nHelp-seeking for SMDs in LMICs is pluralistic, with traditional and faith healers often being the initial, and sometimes the only, port of call (e.g.10). The preferred first contact for mental disorders is traditional and faith-based healers for 69% of adults in Nigeria11 and 30% in Bangladesh.12 Traditional or faith-based healing may alleviate symptoms in mood and anxiety disorders13 and provide valued social and spiritual support, but very little evidence exists that such practices improve care or outcomes for SMDs.13\u201315 On\nthe contrary, reliance on traditional or faith-based systems can lead to treatment delays and poorer outcomes for people with psychotic illnesses.16 In many cases and across LMICs, it can also lead to coercion, including physical restraint, and human rights abuses.17\nWithin its Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed an intervention guide18 that aims to reduce the treatment gap by training non-specialist practitioners to screen for mental disorders, including serious mental illness (SMI), and provide treatment and appropriate referrals where needed. mhGAP strongly recommends the local contextualisation of training,19 especially cultural understandings of mental illness, which are a major determinant of help-seeking,20 but a systematic review of mhGAP in LMICs found that such contextualisation remains a challenge.21 Attempts at local adaptation of mhGAP have mainly been small scale.22,23 Large, community-based, stakeholder-driven, \u2018bottomup\u2019 approaches to developing and testing interventions that are community-owned and community-delivered are lacking across LMICs.\nIncreasing people\u2019s access to psychiatric services without first determining local sociocultural understandings of mental illness, its causes and local help-seeking is unlikely to produce meaningful and sustainable change in the outcomes of SMI in LMICs. We need a deeper understanding of contextually embedded explanatory models and social determinants of mental illness and how these affect pathways to care, before settling on a solution such as \u2018co-location\u2019 of biomedical care at sites where patients seek traditional/faith-based healing.24 There is limited evidence on delivery and effectiveness of such collaborations, despite previous attempts\nBJPsych Open (2022) 8, e185, 1\u20139. doi: 10.1192/bjo.2022.584\n1 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.584 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nto promote collaborations between faith-based healers and mental health services.25,26"

Establishing such collaborations is not without particular and context-specific challenges, including long-held beliefs about mental health and illness and the power differentials between traditional healers and biomedical practitioners.27 Our innovative, bottom-up approach, whereby intervention and training are co-developed by healers, primary care workers and mental health practitioners in a spirit of mutual respect, seeks to address these challenges and promote participatory inclusiveness from all stakeholders.\nMethod"

These sites have been chosen because they both have well-established, well-patronised traditional healing services and well-developed mental health services within reach. At both sites, services offered by the CHWs and other primary and mental health services (both secondary and tertiary care) are typical of the traditional and faith-based healing pathways that operate in many LMICs. As a result, they provide an opportunity to test an integrated model and examine the barriers that arise from the very different ways in which traditional/local and universal/biomedical perspectives see the world.

Our project sites and our methodology offer an opportunity to understand these complex matters and provide sustainable solutions that have the potential to affect the understanding of, and attitudes towards, help-seeking for SMDs.\nIbadan, Nigeria\nIn Ibadan, the study will be conducted in the five urban local government areas (LGAs), which house adjacent and overlapping slum communities and have large numbers of traditional and faith healers who offer healing to people with SMDs. People predominantly of Yoruba ethnicity live in these five LGAs, which have a combined population of 1 338 659 inhabitants.28 Many practise religious syncretism through the combination of traditional African religions with Islam or Christianity. Several ancient and popular shrines, which serve as places for the treatment of mental illness, are found in the study area, alongside Islamic and Christian healing sites. Healing methods include divination, prayers and the use of herbal medicines. Apart from shrines, there are residential homes where people with mental illness stay to receive traditional healing. Many people with SMDs are homeless and roam around, especially in areas with reported high levels of psychoactive substance use and violence.\nNigeria operates a federal systemwith three tiers of government: a central administration, 36 states with their capital cities and 774 LGAs. In line with the three tiers of government, there are three tiers of healthcare delivery services: tertiary healthcare, provided principally by the federal government and consisting of specialised services in teaching and other specialist hospitals; secondary healthcare, provided in general hospitals run primarily by state governments; and primary healthcare, constitutionally the responsibility of local governments.\nBasic healthcare services are provided in government-owned primary health clinics. There are between four and seven primary healthcare clinics in an LGA (district). The health workers who run the primary healthcare clinics are community health officers (CHOs) and community health extension workers (CHEWs), who are supposed to spend 70% of their time out of the primary healthcare centres and in the community. More infrequently, qualified public health nurses or midwives are also found in primary healthcare clinics. There are no dedicated mental health professionals at the primary healthcare level. Services are part of the public healthcare system and are ostensibly available free of cost. CHOs and CHEWs are permitted by law to identify, treat and prescribe medication for SMDs within the context of primary care using a standing order process. Owing to inadequate training and a lack of supervision, CHOs and CHEWs lack the capacity to manage persons with SMDs in primary healthcare and referrals are made to the nearest secondary or tertiary mental health centre.\nThe University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, a tertiary health centre (where the TRANSFORM investigators for Ibadan are based) is the flagship teaching hospital in Nigeria, with an array of clinical departments and specialist services, including psychiatry. This hospital is situated in the centre of an urban LGA close to the heart of the ancient city of Ibadan and is easily accessible by public transport. The Department of Psychiatry has 12 consultant psychiatrists, 30 resident doctors and a large multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatric nurses, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and disability specialists. The hospital has 64 dedicated beds for adult psychiatry and an 8-bed adolescent in-patient unit. For persons without health insurance, healthcare is accessed by out-of-pocket payment.\nThe State Specialist Hospital, Ring Road Ibadan, at the secondary level of healthcare, is the second referral facility that is publicly run and provides specialist mental health services to the community. The government offers highly subsidised healthcare, so this hospital serves those who cannot afford care at the UCH. The facility has 20 beds for psychiatry, 3 psychiatrists, 2 medical officers, psychiatric nurses and social workers in the mental health unit.\nDhaka, Bangladesh\nIn Dhaka, the study will be conducted in the Korail Basti (basti meaning slum). Korail is one of the largest slums in Bangladesh, located in the centre of the city, encroaching on parts Dhaka\u2019s most affluent neighbourhoods. The area of the slum is claimed to be between 180 and 220 acres.29 The majority of Korail\u2019s population (estimated to be around 200 000)30 subsist below the poverty line and work in low-income jobs. They have limited access to the city\u2019s healthcare services and there is little connection with the surrounding major roads.31\nThere is widespread stigma related to mental illness in Bangladesh.32Referrals ofpatientswithSMDs tomental health specialists by primary healthcare providers are near non-existent, as are mentalhealthcare facilities.33Manypeople living in the slumsuse traditional and faith-based healers. There are nine mosques within the Korail Basti, each with imams (Islamic priests) who are the \u2018go-to people\u2019 for mental health problems and support. One key religious healing practice is Kalami (a healing practice based on verses of the Qur\u2019an). The healing aims to cure problems through communication with jinn (spirits), and treatments can also include giving patients pani-pora (blessed water) to exorcise the jinn.34\nThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is Bangladesh\u2019s leading public institution dedicated to the treatment of mental health problems, along with mental health policy formation, research and training of mental health professionals. The facility is located 7.3 km from the Korail Basti. It serves as one of the cheapest clinical options for the Korail community and employs over 300 personnel to deliver out-patient, in-patient and emergency medical services for child and adult mental disorders. As the largest psychiatric teaching hospital in the country, NIMH provides training in psychiatry, psychology and medicine as well as engaging in research activities and mental health policy formation.\nNIMH has a total of 200 in-patient beds; 70% of these are nonfee-paying government-funded beds and the rest are private feepaying beds. In-patient and out-patient admissions range across all units, including adult psychiatry and community and social psychiatry. In 2019, 58 846 patients were provided with service through the out-patient department.\nBangladesh has a pluralistic healthcare system where healthcare services are delivered by different public and private sectors, and we are also exploring ways to embed other referral systems in Dhaka as part of the study.\nStudy delivery: proposed plan\nWork package 1: community-based ethnographic assessment (months 1\u201312)\nIn WP1, we will conduct a community-based ethnographic assessment using qualitative and participatory methods to explore local understanding of SMDs and help-seeking. We will use a variety of methods, including participatory mapping, free-listing and ranking exercises, walk-along interviews, observation and individual and natural group interviews to explore understandings and experiences of mental illness, poverty, daily life and the role of traditional and faith-based healing for SMDs, from the perspectives of\n3 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.584 Published online by Cambridge University Press\npeople with lived experience of mental illness, caregivers, community members, healers, CHWs and health workers. Our findings will be used to co-design, with people with lived experience, caregivers, CHWs and traditional healing practitioners, training packages for screening, early detection and referral to mental healthcare for individuals (aged 18 and over) with SMDs. This will be used to develop a matrix of help-seeking pathways and barriers and enablers to mental healthcare.\nWork package 2: developing training packages for traditional/faith healers and community health workers; raising community awareness (months 12\u201318)\nWewill hold workshops with traditional/faith healers and CHWs to co-produce two training packages. The training package for healers will aim to help them identify signs of SMD in individuals who seek their care. We will identify best pathways for them to refer people with signs of SMD to the local primary care centre or to a CHW. The intervention will be designed not to replace faith and traditional healing practices with biomedical care, but rather to serve as a complement to their role.\nFor CHWs, we will modify the mhGAP intervention and guide18 based on local contextual factors identified through WP1 and based on previous work,35 including local taxonomies of mental illness and ideas on causation and help-seeking. The CHW training will upskill them to deliver community-based interventions, including screening and early identification of those with SMDs, psychoeducation, promoting medication adherence, referral and navigation to secondary care services, support for carers and community health promotion. It will also include a component pertaining to effectively liaising with traditional/faith healers, particularly for identifying those with SMDs who need additional care.\nWe will also co-produce media in various formats, such as posters and radio adverts, to engage communities with the intervention. The content and methods used will be informed by findings from WP1.\nWork package 3: piloting and implementing the training intervention (months 18\u201324)\nWe will introduce the training intervention and discuss how it can be used in day-to-day practice with CHWs, traditional healers, faith healers and primary care practitioners. In particular, traditional and faith healers will be trained as key informants who can offer people with SMDs and their caregivers the additional option of seeing a CHW. This will be in three phases:\nPhase I: relationship-building\nDuring this phase, we will discuss:\n(a) recognition of the pivotal role of healers within the community and the value of their contributions (b) the challenges of recognising SMDs and providing highquality, rights-based care (c) the importance of collaborating and working harmoniously for all stakeholders, particularly for people with SMDs and their caregivers.\nPhase II: review of proposed training\nThis will cover:\n(a) an overview of the proposed plan and training content (b) willingness or reluctance of traditional and faith healers and\nCHWs to embark on training and ways to overcome any challenges\n(c) iterative development of training packages based on feedback (d) dealing with stigma of SMD, misperceptions about biomedical\ncare and healers, financial constraints in accessing care, managing non-adherence to treatment or drop out from care, supporting households through psychoeducation and dealing with crises (e) helping patients and families navigate the referral pathway (f) use of community resources to facilitate recovery, such as self-\ncare, supported employment, activities of daily living.\nPhase III: delivery of training\nFindings from phases I and II above, in addition to content generated from WP2, will allow the further refinement of the training package; the referral pathway and the support for ongoing care; and the identification of trainers. Following the refinement of the training package, two half-day interactive training workshops will be delivered to traditional practitioners and CHWs, with a halfday supervision session every 3 months. All training materials and delivery will be in the local languages (Bengali in Dhaka, and Yoruba in Ibadan).\nWork package 4: community identification, referral and outcome assessment of people with SMDs (months 24\u201348)\nOur aim for WP4 is to determine whether our interventions lead to an increase in numbers of people with SMDs accessing biomedical care. We will further ascertain these individuals\u2019 initial and followup mental health status and quality of life, reduction in caregiver burden, and changes in community attitudes and help-seeking for SMDs. We will collect data pre-intervention to identify the number of people with SMDs attending mental health services from the study site and their basic clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. Data collection systems will be in place for baseline and follow-up assessments of successive patients identified with signs of SMD and enrolled into the study over 12 months.\nWork package 5: health economic analysis and methodological development (months 24\u201348)\nThe overall research question for this WP5 is \u2018What are the costs and benefits associated with investing in initiatives that facilitate relationships between traditional healers and the formal healthcare systems to improve access to care for those with SMDs?\u2019 We will conduct primary data collection and analysis specific to the intervention developed in WP3. Our analyses will allow us to (a) generalise our work to interventions that aim to improve access more broadly, which will increase their impact and value to decisionmakers; and (b) inform the development of mental health economics in LMICs and help address the need for capacity-building in this field."

Analysis will be conducted first independently and then collaboratively to ensure reliability and validity within each site. The analysis will identify understandings and experiences of mental illness, poverty and daily life in the selected communities, as well as helpseeking for mental illness and practices of healers and health workers. The findings will inform the planning of the training interventions for CHWs and traditional/faith healers so that the interventions are contextually relevant and include the views of people with lived experience of mental illness and their families, healers and health professionals.\nFindings from WP1 will also inform the qualitative evaluation of process and outcome after the intervention using the Qualitative Impact Protocol (QuIP).36 The QuIP is a method for qualitative impact evaluation for community-led and communitydelivered interventions. It focuses on credible impact evaluation in relation to seeking to attribute outcomes to a specific intervention using interpretive methods. The QuIP uses a contribution analysis approach, combining quantitative monitoring of key indicators with qualitative, self-reported attribution of impact to provide sufficient evidence to test the theory of change behind the activity being evaluated.37 Importantly, although the QuIP evaluation can be designed by the study team, independent researchers, who are not associated with the intervention, will undertake the interviews to avoid confirmation bias and strengthen replicability.\nThe data collection for the process evaluation will include a replication of elements from the WP1 ethnographic assessment, including interviews with key participants on the referral pathway and group and individual interviews using participatory techniques. These will include people who accessed biomedical care and those who did not. In addition, interviews will be conducted with some of the previously interviewed natural groups when the listing and ranking and help-seeking matrix are repeated to assess whether there have been any changes in understanding. Data will be subjected to thematic analyses and these findings will inform the contextual interpretation of our quantitative findings.\nQuantitative evaluation\nInWP4, we will adopt a two-fold approach. Primarily, we will assess the impact of the proposed intervention on the (mental health) care pathway of individuals with SMDs and its potential effect on their health status. We will assess impact on the referral pathway by comparing referral rates made to the participating healers 12 months before and after intervention (training) is delivered. We will undertake a pre\u2013post regression analysis to quantify the referral difference at the healer level after adjusting for healers\u2019 and patients\u2019 characteristics. Both the crude and the adjusted rate change and its corresponding 95% confidence interval will be provided.38 The change in referral rate will be the primary outcome of interest for this study.\nWe acknowledge that some participants may be directed to biomedical services by a healer but, for various reasons, may not actually access biomedical care. To further evaluate the impact of a healer\u2019s referral, we will try our best to trace their referrals and find out whether potential participants used mental health clinics.\nIn addition to the primary outcome, a number of patient-related secondary outcomes will be analysed. At this (patient) level, analysis\nwill focus on clinical outcomes, functioning, participant and family satisfaction, medication adherence and attendance for clinical follow-up (Table 1 outlines the measures and time points for assessments).Uptake of healthcare will be evaluated longitudinally: at baseline (i.e. intake) and at months 1, 2 and 3. Similarly, clinical outcomes will be assessed longitudinally using the Global Assessment of Symptoms (GAS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and clinician-rated primary and secondary diagnoses. Carer burden will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention at month 3 using the Perceived Family Burden Scale (PFBS), and family satisfaction will be assess longitudinally using the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale (adapted to LMIC contexts). We will investigate service utilisation and associated costs using the abbreviated version of the Client Services Receipt Inventory (CSRI) \u2013 modified as used in our previous study.39 We will employ a linear mixed model to estimate longitudinal changes, adjusting for patient characteristics, time and baseline values/scores. Estimates and effect sizes will be reported, together with their 95% confidence intervals.\nWe will follow checklists such as the STROBE Statement to report our observational research. We are intending to develop a dedicated statistical analysis plan (SAP) with detailed description of the analyses undertaken (primary and sensitivity), the handling of missing values and model-assumption violations.

We will (a) develop and maintain an up-to-date project website and social media page(s) (to target different audiences/stakeholders); (b) present study findings at national and international psychiatric and mental health scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed publications; and (c) disseminate our findings as broadly as possible in Bengali and Yoruba through film, radio and street theatre developed with local creative partners and civil society advocacy groups. We will work closely with our partners to identify the dissemination and public engagement approaches that will work best in these settings, to increase the impact of our research, to further engage the target communities, raise awareness, reduce stigma and provide information on plural healthcare for SMD."

Patient and public involvement (PPI) is at the heart of TRANSFORM, and the entire study was conceived with people with lived experience of SMDs, their families, faith healers, charity organisations and the wider community. WP1 uses participatory approaches to understand local and contextual understandings of mental health, illness and help-seeking behaviour from the perspective of patients and carer groups and voluntary/charity/third-sector organisations, ensuring representation of hard-to-reach groups. The community were involved in proposing the research objectives and in the overall study design and will be central to the implementation of our intervention; and co-author O.J. is an expert on Yoruba history and Ifa divination, a traditional healer and co-investigator. All researchers and partners in TRANSFORM also have an extensive record of patient and carer involvement in research. We have a robust programme for monitoring and governance \u2013 research, ethics and financial \u2013 and our programme will adhere to the highest levels of ethical practice and probity, including PPI."

            "text": "The TRANSFORM study plans to build on lessons learned from previous research in this area, particularly from the University of Ibadan, which is a centre of excellence and WHO Collaborating Centre for mental health research. The University of Ibadan has been the site of a significant number of influential studies on SMI and help-seeking which have led to several high-quality publications, including, but not limited to:\n(a) INTREPID 1 and 2 \u2013 social epidemiological and qualitative research on methods of community case finding and helpseeking pathways for psychosis (funded by the Medical Research Council) (e.g.40) (b) PAM-D \u2013 formative qualitative research on local concepts of mental health and explanatory models (funded by the US National Institute of Health) (e.g.27)\n(c) COSIMPO \u2013 a cluster randomised controlled trial of a collaborative care model for psychosis with traditional and faithbased healers and primary care mental health workers (funded by the US National Institute of Mental Health).25\nTRANSFORM will build on these studies, elaborating and extending understanding through its distinctive methodology and approach, including:\n(a) evaluating impact and effectiveness as the primary outcome (b) targeting people with all SMDs, including severe depression,\nnot just psychosis (c) developing a help-seeking pathway and provision from the\ncommunity, through various care pathways (primary and secondary care) with follow-up (d) developing a clear referral pathway to existing mental health services (e) training primary care workers/CHWs to screen for SMDs and refer, rather than using specialist mental health nurses, in line with the integration of mental healthcare into primary care\n(f) increasing collaboration, understanding and respect between mental health workers, including psychiatrists, nurses and CHWs, and healers of different types through a strong focus on participatory methods and community engagement (g) comparison between Nigeria and Bangladesh rather than another country within Africa.\nTRANSFORM also aims to innovate methodologically through:\n(a) using mixed methods, in particular ethnography and participatory methods, in addition to qualitative interviews and quantitative methods (b) involving the community, including people with lived experience, caregivers and other stakeholders, from the outset and throughout the process through community advisory groups and other participatory methods, with a view to building in sustainability (c) using results of initial ethnographic research on existing helpseeking practices as well as the activities of healers and primary health workers to inform training (WP2), intervention (WP3) and evaluation (WP4 and WP5). (d) co-producing training with CHWs, mental health workers and healers (e) conducting both process and outcome evaluation using mixed methods, including ethnography and qualitative interviews to understand how, why and for whom the intervention was or was not successful."

            "text": "The sizeable differences in social and cultural context, lived experience, sociodemographics, infrastructure and availability of resources mean that models of care developed in high-income countries cannot be simply translocated to LMICs.39 TRANSFORM will co-develop a novel and sustainable referral pathway for people with SMDs to access biomedical care, while engaging with the benefits of existing pluralistic help-seeking pathways. We will tailor evidence-informed interventions to the local sociocultural context to address the increasing burden of SMDs in Nigeria and Bangladesh. By developing a novel intervention that is regionally relevant, TRANSFORM will develop and test sustainable interventions that can be integrated into existing clinical care and generate data (including health economic data) that will inform priorities for healthcare providers and policy makers.\n7 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.584 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSwaran P.
