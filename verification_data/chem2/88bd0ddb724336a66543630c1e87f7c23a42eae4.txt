"The results of the present study demonstrated that the application of the GC–MS metabolomics strategy to discover new potential biomarkers has been useful in the endometriosis diagnostic process and in clarifying the disease’s pathophysiology. Indeed, a specific pathological metabolic fingerprint, in line with our previous work, was established. Furthermore, increased concentrations of proline, β-hydroxybutyric acid, and threonic acid and a decrease in valine and alanine were found in the endometriosis patients compared to the non-endometriosis group."
