We 2 aimed to obtain improved analgesic effects when compared to \u03c31 receptor antagonists or H2S-3 donors alone. In an in vivo model of sensory hypersensitivity, thioamide 1a induced analgesia 4 which was synergistically enhanced when associated with the \u03c31 receptor antagonist BD-1063. 5 The selective \u03c31 receptor agonist PRE-084 completely reversed this effect. Four thioamide H2S-6 \u03c31 receptor hybrids (5a8a) and their amide derivatives (5b8b) were synthesized. Compound 7 7a (AD164) robustly released H2S and showed selectivity for \u03c31 receptor over \u03c32 and opioid 8 receptors. This compound induced marked analgesia that was reversed by PRE-084. The amide 9 analogue 7b (AD163) showed only minimal analgesia. Further studies showed that 7a exhibited 10 negligible acute toxicity, together with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. To the best of our 11 knowledge, compound 7a is the first dual-acting ligand with simultaneous H2S-release and \u03c31 12 antagonistic activities. 13\nKeywords: Sigma-1 Receptor, Antagonist, Hydrogen Sulfide Donor, Analgesia, Dual Ligands 14\nAbbreviations: \u03c3, sigma; KO, knockout; H2S, hydrogen sulfide; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; 15 KATP, ATP-sensitive potassium; [(\u00b1)-HP-mII, (\u00b1)-haloperidol metabolite II; MOR, \u00b5-opioid 16 receptor; DOR, \u03b4-opioid receptor; KOR, \u03ba-opioid receptor; WSP-1, Washington State Probe-17\n1; PBS, phosphate buffered solution; s.c., subcutaneous; hERG, human ether-a-go-go related 18 gene; MABP, mean arterial blood pressure; BBB, blood-brain barrier. 19\n1. Introduction 20\nPain is a global health burden, with millions of people suffering from chronic pain, and an 1 estimate of 18% of individuals in developed countries with chronic pain conditions. The current 2 cost of chronic pain to the healthcare system is significant, and arguably unsustainable 3 considering the rapid ageing of the population [1]. Current analgesics show limited efficacy in 4 many pain conditions or a number of side effects which limit their use and therefore, there is an 5 urgent need of novel analgesics [2]. 6 Sigma (\u03c3) receptors are involved in several biological processes and pathological conditions [3]. 7 Two subtypes are currently known, denoted as sigma-1 (\u03c31) and sigma-2 (\u03c32) receptors, having 8 different structure, biological function, and pharmacological profile [3, 4]. \u03c31 receptor is a Ca2+-9 sensing chaperone which acts as a regulatory subunit of several ion channels and G-protein 10 coupled receptors, with an important role on neurotransmission [5]. Several evidences support 11 the modulatory role of \u03c31 receptor in nociception, mainly based on the pain-attenuated phenotype 12 in \u03c31 receptor knockout (KO) mice and on the antinociceptive effect exerted by \u03c31 receptor 13 antagonists on pain of different types including inflammatory pain, osteoarthritis, neuropathic 14 pain induced by either mechanical injury or antineoplastics, and visceral pain [5]. 15 Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter involved in the modulation of the daily 16 cellular activities including inflammation, nociception and the regulation of the structure and 17 function of blood vessels such that the downregulation of H2S pathways is involved in the 18 pathogenesis of a variety of vascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis [6, 7]. 19 Under physiological conditions, cells produce small but significant amounts of H2S that 20 contribute to enhance the neutrophil/endothelium adhesion process, leading to neutrophil 21 migration toward the inflammatory site and thus inflammatory hypernociception [8, 9]. In 22 contrast to the pro-nociceptive role of endogenous H2S, the systemic pretreatment of mice with 23\nan exogenous H2S-donor (NaHS) inhibited nociceptive stimuli both in a lipopolysaccharide 1 (LPS)-induced inflammatory and in a zymosan-induced articular hypernociception model by 2 opening ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels [10]. The antinociceptive effect of the 3 exogenous H2S-administration has been found to be effective also in rodent models of visceral 4 pain and peripheral neuropathic pain induced by either traumatic nerve injury or anticancer drugs 5 [11-13]. 6 The gathered preclinical evidence for the role of \u03c31 receptor and H2S donors in pain has led to 7 the recent development of the selective \u03c31 antagonist E-52862 (S1RA), and the H2S-8 antiinflammatory compound ATB-346 (Figure 1). These compounds are currently undergoing 9\nphase II clinical trials for pain treatment with excellent safety profiles [14, 15]. 10\nHowever, treatments based on a single mechanism of action often lack of efficacy and targeting 13 multiple concurrent mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, by combination pharmacotherapy, 14 is routinely used to alleviate chronic pain as well in reducing side effects [16, 17]. Although 15 combination drug therapy represents the most simple and immediate way to combine drugs with 16 different mechanisms of action, this may have some disadvantages. Indeed, the pharmacokinetics 17 and pharmacodynamics of the two compounds should be compatible regarding latency for the 18 effect, time for maximum effect and time between doses, and also the compounds should be 19 compatible in terms of potential drug-drug interactions [18]. For this reason, polypharmacology 20\nthat relies on the use of a single multi-target pharmaceutical ingredient could have inherent 1 advantages over combination therapies, overcoming all these issues related with the combination 2 therapy. As an example, tramadol and tapentadol are well known analgesics with dual opioid 3 agonist and neurotransmitter reuptake-blocker mechanism of action. Moreover, different 4 multitarget drugs are being developed including some opioid-sigma dual compounds [19, 20]. 5 With the aim to identify novel analgesics endowed with multiple mechanisms of action for their 6 use thereof, here we aimed to find whether a H2S-donor combined with a \u03c31 receptor antagonist 7 moiety might induce a synergistically enhanced analgesic effect when compared to these 8 mechanisms acting alone. Here we report for the first time the development of hybrid ligands 9 able to bind \u03c3 receptors and to release H2S useful for pain treatment. Finally, we also performed 10 an initial assessment of the toxicological properties of the most promising hybrid compound. 11"

            "text": "2.1. Rational design 13\nThe choice of an adequate H2S donor has been done in order to ensure a high and effective H2S 14 release. Among the different classes of H2S-donors developed to date, thioamides seem to be 15 preferable having demonstrated a sufficient or higher release than other donors [21]. 4-16 Carbamothioylbenzoic acid 1a (Figure 2) was thus selected having a thioamide function bound 17 to the para position of benzoic acid. Generally, electron-withdrawing functional groups on the 18 phenyl ring led to faster H2S generation, while electron-donating groups led to slower H2S 19 release [22]. Our purposes were to produce chemical compounds able to give a fast-onset 20 analgesic effect although with a fairly stability before administration in order to maximize the 21 real concentration of H2S released to biological systems. 22\nThe new chemical entities (58a) were designed as analogs of the conventional antipsychotic 1\nhaloperidol (2a, Figure 2), a compound that shows a high affinity for \u03c3 receptors, showing also a 2 \u03c31 receptor antagonist functional profile with antinociceptive and anti-allodynic effects [23, 24]. 3 Different from 2a, (\u00b1)-haloperidol metabolite II [(\u00b1)-HP-mII (2b, Figure 2)] displays a 4 preferential affinity on \u03c3 receptors compared to dopamine receptors acting also as \u03c31 receptor 5 antagonist and producing an analgesic effect comparable to that of 2a [23-25]. Starting from 2b, 6 we conjugated the secondary hydroxy group with the 4-carbamothioylbenzoic acid as in 7 compound AD95 (5a), while the removal of the para-F-phenyl group produced compound 8 AD127 (6a). 9\nRecently, LMH-2 (3, Figure 2) has been reported as a novel analog of compound 2a exhibiting 12 high \u03c31 receptor affinity and good selectivity over \u03c32 receptor [26]. In an in vivo model of 13 neuropathic pain, 3 produced dose-dependent antiallodynic effects with more potency than 14 gabapentin. Based on these findings, we replaced the fluorine atom of 3 with the thioamide to 15\ngive compound AD164 (7a). While compound AD119 (8a) was designed as conformationally 1 constrained homologue of compound 7a where the amide nitrogen was embedded in a cycle and 2 thus tertiary. To better dig into the precise mechanism of the synthetized compounds, derivatives 3 AD162 (5b), AD160 (6b), AD163 (7b) and AD120 (8b) bearing an amide instead to the 4 thioamide function have also been prepared as negative controls. 5 The characterization of the synthesized ligands included an in vitro evaluation of (i) the binding 6 affinity against \u03c3 and opioid receptors, (ii) assessment of H2S release ability, and (iii) in vivo 7 studies in a model of sensory hypersensitivity. Moreover, we evaluated key aspects of safety 8 pharmacology for the most promising compound, as well as some relevant aspects of its 9\npharmacokinetic profile. 10\n2.2. Synthesis 11\nThe H2S-donor thioamide 1a and compounds 5\u22128 were synthesized according to the steps 12 illustrated in Scheme 1. 13\nScheme 1. Synthetic Strategy for the Preparation of Target Compounds. 14\n1 Reagents and conditions: (i) P4S10, EtOH, 100 \u00b0C, 5 h; (ii) NaBH4, EtOH, rt, 12 h; (iii) 4-2 chloro-1-butanol, KHCO3, ACN, reflux, 4 h; (iv) EDC, HOBT, DMF, rt, 6 h. 3\nThe H2S-donor scaffold 1a was prepared starting from commercially available 4-cyanobenzoic 4 acid by thionation with P4S10 and then conjugated with opportune alcohol or amine by coupling 5 reactions to give the final compounds 5a\u22128a. The reaction of intermediate 2b, obtained by 6 reduction of 2a with NaBH4, and 1a gave ester derivative 5a. Intermediate 4, attained by N-7 alkylation with 4-chloro-1-butanol, has been conjugated with 1a to give ester 6a. As regard the 8 synthesis of amides 7a and 8a, 1-benzylpiperidin-4-amine and 1-benzylpiperazine have been 9 used, respectively. Negative controls 5b\u22128b were obtained through condensation of the same 10 alcohols or amines with commercial 4-carbamoylbenzoic acid. 11\n2.3. Structure-affinity relationship studies 12\nCompounds were evaluated for affinity at \u03c3 receptors and for \u00b5, \u03b4 and \u0199 opioid receptors (MOR, 13\nDOR and KOR, respectively) through radioligand binding assays (Table 1). We also included 2a, 14\nDTG (9), (+)-pentazocine (10), BD-1063 (11), DAMGO (13), naltrindole (14) and ()-U50,488 1\n(15) as internal controls that were tested with the same membrane homogenates of the hybrid 2 compounds under investigation (Figure S1). All the reference compounds showed Ki values for 3 \u03c31 and \u03c32 receptors and the three opioid receptors comparable to those reported in previous 4 studies [27-32]. It is worth pointing out that compounds 1a,b were devoid of affinity for either \u03c3 5 receptors or the three opioid receptors examined. 6 The esterification of the secondary hydroxy group of compound 2b with the thioamide 1a as in 7 compound 5a, resulted in a substantial decrease in the affinity at both \u03c3 receptors. Indeed, as 8 reported in Table 1, compound 2b has a Ki\u03c31 of 2.7 nM and Ki\u03c32 of 2.4 nM while 5a esterified 9 with 4-carbamothioylbenzoic acid has a Ki\u03c31 of 156 nM and Ki\u03c32 of 311 nM. The elimination of 10 the p-F-phenyl group as in 6a increased the \u03c31 receptor affinity with respect to 5a, together with 11 an improved selectivity over \u03c32 receptor. Indeed, compound 6a had a Ki\u03c31 of 58 nM vs Ki\u03c32 of 12 266 nM. The sulfur atom seems to promote the affinity at both \u03c3 receptors with derivatives 5b 13 and 6b bearing the amide function showing lower affinity over both receptor subtypes with Ki\u03c31 14 of 173 nM vs Ki\u03c32 of 618 nM, and Ki\u03c31 of 126 nM vs Ki\u03c32 of 933 nM, respectively. 15 The replacement of the para-F-phenyl group of 3 with the thioamide scaffold as in compound 16 7a, determined a lowering of affinity towards both \u03c3 receptors when compared to the cognate 17 derivative. As reported in Table 1, Ki\u03c31 values of 6.0 nM and Ki\u03c32 of 190 nM were determined 18 for 3, whereas compound 7a showed Ki\u03c31 of 94 nM and Ki\u03c32 of 1,125 nM. 19 The conformationally constrained homologue of 7a, compound 8a having the amide nitrogen 20 embedded in a cycle, shows low affinity for \u03c31 receptor (Ki\u03c31 668 nM) and it completely loses 21 the capacity to bind \u03c32 receptor (Ki\u03c32 >10,000). Differently from compounds 5a,b and 6a,b, in 22\ncompounds 7a and 8a the replacement of the thioamide with the amide function as in negative 1 controls 7b and 8b determine a lower affinity for both \u03c3 receptor subtypes. 2 Overall, the introduction of the thioamide or amide functions lead to a worsening of the affinity 3 over \u03c3 receptors, although remaining, at least for the \u03c31 receptor, in the medium or low nM range 4 in most cases. 5 The interaction with MOR, DOR and KOR was measured in order to exclude additional 6 analgesic effects related with these three opioid receptors (Table 1). The 4-carbamothioylphenyl 7\n\u03c31 receptor derivatives 5a8a show low affinity toward MOR, and negligible for KOR and DOR 8 indicating selectivity for \u03c31 receptor over these opioid receptors. Similarly, amide derivatives 9 5b8b have provided to displace the radioligands only at high concentrations, resulting in a low 10\naffinity profile for the three receptors. 11\nHaloperidol (2a) 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 77 \u00b1 18 (\u00b1)-HP-mII (2b)b 2.7 \u00b1 0.8 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 LMH-2 (3)c 6.0 190 DTG (9) 124 \u00b1 19 18 \u00b1 1 (+)-Pentazocine (10) 4.3 \u00b1 0.5 1,465 \u00b1 224 BD-1063 (11) 14 \u00b1 2.7 204 \u00b1 31 DAMGO (13) 1.49 \u00b1 0.49 Naltrindole (14) 2.53 \u00b1 0.51 ()-U50,488 (15) 1.10 \u00b1 0.21\naEach value is the mean \u00b1 SD of at least two experiments performed in duplicate. bReference 1 25. cReference 26. 2\n2.4. Hydrogen sulfide release 3\nH2S release was assessed using a spectrofluorimetric assay based upon the reaction of H2S with 4 Washington State Probe-1 (WSP-1) to generate benzodithiolone and a fluorophore with 5 excitation and emission maxima of 465 and 515 nm, respectively. The results of H2S release in 6 phosphate buffered solution (PBS) at regular intervals of 15 min are reported in Figure 3. 7\n8\nFigure 3. H2S release measurement at regular incubation intervals in PBS buffer. Data are 1 presented as mean \u00b1 SD of at least two experiments in triplicate. 2\nFirst, we evaluated compound 1a and its amide derivative 1b as negative control for their ability 3 to release H2S. Thioamide 1a at 100 \u00b5M concentration was able to release H2S in a significant 4 and cumulative fashion over time. The amount of H2S released by H2S-donor scaffold 1a after 1 5 h incubation was 34.4 \u03bcM. No H2S release was detected for the analogue 1b (100 \u00b5M) bearing 6 an amide function used as negative control. These results exemplify the specificity of the 7 technique used. 8 Our data show that the aptitude to release H2S is fully preserved after the H2S-donor scaffold is 9 covalently conjugated in our compounds, since 5\u20128a showed a good ability in releasing a 10 significant amount of H2S in the \u03bcM range. In fact, all the synthesized compounds have shown 11 an equal or higher ability in releasing H2S than the prototypic compound 1a with the maximum 12 release recorded after 60 min of incubation that correspond with the latest recorder time point. 13 Compounds 5a and 8a released 51.7 and 46.7 \u00b5M of H2S respectively, after 1 h of incubation, 14 whereas compounds 6a and 7a released H2S at a slower pace, yielding values of 41.8 and 38.4 15 \u00b5M, respectively. 16\n2.5. Effects of compounds on capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity 17\nWe tested the effects of compounds 1a,b and BD-1063 on sensory hypersensitivity in mice. We 18 used capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity (allodynia) as a pain model, as it is well 19 known that the increase in sensitivity to pain in the area surrounding capsaicin injection results 20 from central sensitization, which is a key process in chronic pain development and maintenance 21 [33]. In addition, changes in capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity have been used to 22\nstudy the behavioral consequences of drug treatment in central sensitization in both humans and 1 rodents [24, 34, 35]. Importantly, capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity has been used 2 repeatedly to determine the \u03c31 agonistic/antagonistic properties of new compounds (including 3 clinical candidates) [36-38], as \u03c31 antagonists are able to decrease sensory hypersensitivity while 4 \u03c31 agonists reverse the effects of the former [35]. 5 The subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of either BD-1063 or 1a resulted in a marked dose-6 dependent reduction of mechanical hypersensitivity (Figure 4A), although 1a exhibited a higher 7 potency than BD-1063, with ED50 values of 6.12 \u00b1 0.34 and 10.31 \u00b1 0.49 mg/kg for 1a and BD-8 1063, respectively. The administration of the amide analogue 1b showed only limited effects at 9 the higher doses tested (Figure 4A). The administration of PRE-084 (12, Figure S1) was able to 10 reverse the effect of BD-1063 but not the effect of 1a (Figure 4B), indicating that \u03c31 receptor 11 agonism exclusively decreases the effect of \u03c31 antagonism on sensory hypersensitivity without 12 affecting the effect induced by the H2S release. 13\nDose dependency of the antinociceptive effects of the subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of 1a, 1 1b and BD-1063. B) Effects of BD-1063 and compound 1a alone and in combination with the \u03c31 2 receptor agonist PRE-084. Values are the mean \u00b1 SEM obtained from 6\u20139 animals per group 3 (**p<0.01 vs Ctrl, ##p<0.01 vs BD-1063; one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls 4 test). 5\nWe then evaluated whether the concurrent administration to mice of 1a and BD-1063 resulted in 6 a supra-additive (synergistic) effect on mechanical hypersensitivity. We tested the association of 7 both compounds in a 1:1 weight ratio and performed isobolographic analyses (see \u201cExperimental 8 Section\u201d for details). The value experimentally determined for the drug association (Zexp) at the 9 ED50 level fell on the additivity line and was undistinguishable from the theoretical value 10 predicted for an additive effect (Zadd) (Figure 5A and Table 2). Therefore, the interaction index 11 (\u0263) (which is calculated as Zexp/Zadd) yielded a value close to 1 (Table 2) and this is interpreted 12 as no interaction between treatments [39, 40]. However, when examining the in vivo effects of 13 the association between 1a and BD-1063 at the ED75 level we found different results, as the Zexp 14 was below the additivity line and was significantly smaller than the Zadd value, yielding a \u0263 15 value of 0.75 (Figure 5B, and Table 2). These results suggest that there is an apparent synergistic 16 effect of the drug association at the ED75 level [39, 40]. Interestingly, the drug combination 17 exhibited an even stronger synergism at the ED90 level, as the Zexp was even more distant to the 18 additivity line, and highly significantly different from Zadd, yielding a \u0263 value of 0.58 (Figure 19 5C, and Table 2). 20 These results indicate that the synergism induced by the administration of both compounds is 21 stronger as the expected antiallodynic effect is more prominent. Therefore, we performed further 22 experiments on the association of 1a and BD-1063, both at 5 mg/kg, as this combination 23\nproduced a robust synergistic decrease of mechanical hypersensitivity (approximately 80%) 1 (Figure 5D). To test for \u03c31 receptor involvement on the effects induced by the association of both 2 compounds, mice were treated with the selective \u03c31 receptor agonist PRE-084, revealing a 3 marked reversion of the effects. These results indicate that the \u03c31 receptor component played an 4 important role on the pronounced effects induced by the association between BD-1063 and 1a. 5 Notably, the effects of BD-1063 were not enhanced by 1b (Figure 5D) (i.e. in the absence of H2S 6 release). Taken together, these results suggest that the \u03c31 antagonism and the H2S release are 7 both needed for the marked effect on the sensory hypersensitivity induced by the association of 8 1a with BD-1063, and that we can control for the contribution of both mechanisms by using 9\nPRE-084 and testing analog compounds lacking the thioamide function, respectively. 10\nStatistically significant differences between Zexp and their respective Zadd: **p <0.01 3 (Student\u2019s t-test). 4\nWe thus tested the effects of compounds 58 on sensory hypersensitivity in mice. Compound 5a 5\nshowed a reversion of capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose dependent 6 manner, and with a very high potency. However, the negative control 5b induced very similar 7 effects when tested at the same doses (Figure S2A). Accordingly, the H2S release is not 8 participating in the range of doses in which compound 5a shows the ameliorative effect on 9 sensory hypersensitivity, and that the \u03c3 receptors component (or additional activities) are 10 exclusively responsible for the effects observed. The derivative 6a, lacking the p-F-phenyl 11 fragment of 5a, was not able to completely reverse the sensitizing effect of capsaicin even at 12 high doses (Figure S2A). 13 Compound 7a showed a prominent in vivo effect, markedly reducing capsaicin-induced 14 mechanical hypersensitivity, whereas the derivative 7b lacking the thioamide function had 15 minimal effect. This result is a clear evidence of the H2S contribution to the analgesic effect of 16 7a (Figure 6A). The administration of the \u03c31 receptor agonist PRE-084 nearly abolished the 17 effect of 7a at low doses of the later (20 mg/kg), but the effect of \u03c31 receptor agonism gradually 18 disappeared when increasing the dose of 7a, so that at the dose of 40 mg/kg the effect of PRE-19 084 was not significant (Figure 6B). It is important to note that the dose of 32 mg/kg s.c. of PRE-20 084 has been previously shown to fully reverse in mice the effects of high doses (64\u2012128 mg/kg) 21\nof S1RA [41, 42], a high affinity and highly selective \u03c31 receptor antagonist currently in clinical 1 trials for pain treatment [43]. The findings of these previous studies suggest that this dose of 2 PRE-084 is enough to fully mask the effects of \u03c31 receptor antagonism even if the antagonist is 3 administered at high doses. Therefore, our results showing that moderate doses of 7a are still 4 able to reduce mechanical hypersensitivity in spite of the administration of PRE-084 suggest that 5 additional mechanisms, such as H2S-mediated actions, participate on the reduction of capsaicin-6 induced mechanical hypersensitivity induced by this compound. In other words, compound 7a 7 elicits a qualitatively equivalent antiallodynic effect with respect to the combination of 1a and 8 BD-1063 (in both cases the effect can be reversed by PRE-084 and it seems dependent on the 9 release of H2S, as the amide controls were nearly ineffective), suggesting that \u03c31 antagonism and 10 H2S release simultaneously participate on the effects observed in both situations. The use of a 11 single multi-target compound is preferred over the combination of two drugs with a single 12 mechanism of action, since in this latter case, the two compounds must be compatible in terms of 13 pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions [17]. Therefore, in this sense, 7a is 14 superior to the combination of a pure \u03c31 antagonist and a pure H2S releasing compound. 15\n16\nFigure 6. Reduction of capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity by the systemic 1 administration of 7a and 7b in mice, and contribution of \u03c31 receptor to their effects. A) Dose 2 dependency of the effects of the subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of 7a and 7b. B) Effects of 3 compound 7a alone and in combination with the \u03c31 receptor agonist PRE-084. Values are the 4 mean \u00b1 SEM obtained from 6\u20139 animals per group (*p<0.01 vs Ctrl, **p<0.01 vs 7a; one-way 5 ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test). 6\nDerivative 8a was able to decrease mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose dependent manner. 7 When PRE-084 administration was associated to 8a, at the highest dose tested (40 mg/kg), it 8 resulted in a significant reversion of the effect, indicating the involvement of \u03c31 receptor 9 antagonism in the observed effect. However, the amide control 8b showed similar or even higher 10 analgesic effects when evaluated at the same doses (Figure S2A). It must be noted that 11 compound 8b had no affinity at \u03c3 receptors (Table 1), and in fact its effect was not reversed by 12 PRE-084 (Figure S2B). Thus, the observed in vivo effects induced by 8b are purportedly related 13 to off-target activity. It may be speculated that compound 8a, although showing a low affinity for 14 \u03c31 receptor (Ki\u03c31 668 nM), might provide a good analgesic in vivo activity due to the possible 15 enhancement of the H2S and \u03c31 receptor antagonism combination. 16\n2.6. Safety pharmacology study 17\nAdverse drug reactions are a major problem in drug development [44]. Therefore, once we 18 demonstrated the efficacy of the combination of \u03c31 antagonism and H2S release on an in vivo 19 pain model, we tested whether this was accompanied with an apparent toxicity. 20 The assessment of motor coordination is part of the core battery for CNS safety pharmacology 21 recommended by regulatory agencies [45]. The assessment of drug-induced motor impairment is 22\nparticularly relevant for the interpretation of the results from tests for nociception, since animals 1 need to have preserved motor coordination for the performance of the nociceptive responses, 2 which are typically reflex responses. Pharmacological treatment affecting motor functioning 3 might also attenuate nociceptive responses and thereby induce false analgesic-like effects [2]. 4 Therefore, we treated animals with 1a (5 mg/kg) + BD-1063 (5 mg/kg) or with 7a (40 mg/kg), at 5 doses able to induce a marked effect on mechanical hypersensitivity, and submitted them to the 6 rotarod test, which is the most standard test for motor coordination in preclinical research. As 7 shown in Figure 7, animals treated with these compounds showed no change in the latency to fall 8 down from the rotating drum in comparison to the baseline value (time 0), at any time-point 9 tested during the 4 h evaluation period. Hence, the results found on capsaicin-induced 10 mechanical hypersensitivity for either the association of the prototypic \u03c31 antagonist and H2S 11 releaser compounds, or our molecule 7a which combine simultaneously both mechanisms, 12 cannot be attributed to motor impairment. The lack of effect in modifying rotarod latencies of 13 these compounds was not due to any methodological pitfall, because the administration of 14 pregabalin, used as a positive control of a drug known to induce motor deficits [46], induced 15 significantly reduced rotarod latencies (Figure 7). 16\nCardiovascular events are among the most frequent adverse events leading to the failure of drugs 8 in development [47]. We therefore performed electrophysiological assays to test whether 9 compound 7a blocks the hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) potassium channel activity, 10 which is known to be related to potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias [47]. Compound 7a did 11 not block K+ current up to 1 \u00b5M concentration, and induced a 60% inhibition at 10 \u00b5M (Table 12 S1) with an estimated IC50 of 6.8 \u00b5M. This IC50 for hERG blockade contrast with the Ki for \u03c31 13 receptor binding, which as commented above is of 94 nM. Therefore, there is a wide window 14 between the affinity of 7a for one of its main targets and this troublesome off-target effect. 15\nTesting for hERG inhibition is part of the standard core battery of cardiovascular safety 1 pharmacology of regulatory agencies for new compounds [47], together with other important 2 parameters such as blood pressure [45]. This latter measure is particularly relevant for H2S 3 releasers, as it has been proposed that these compounds might serve to treat hypertension [48]. In 4 the context of a normotensive animal, drug-induced hypotension would be an unwanted side 5 effect. Therefore, we measured the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) by direct recording in 6 left carotid artery in animals treated with 7a [49], at doses able to induce a marked effect on 7 mechanical hypersensitivity (30 and 40 mg/kg, s.c.). No differences were found in blood 8 pressure between the groups of animals when receiving vehicle or compound 7a (Figure 8). 9\nTherefore, H2S released by analgesic doses of 7a is not enough to alter MABP. 10\n2.7. Stability and solubility profile 1\nThe water solubility and chemical stability for compound 7a were experimentally determined, 2 while partition coefficients theoretically calculated (Table 3). Compound 7a (free base) 3 displayed a water solubility of 1.25 mM (0.44 mg/mL) at rt. The chemical stability was evaluated 4 in vitro at 37 \u00b0C in an aqueous phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.4 and in saline solution at rt 5 monitored as reduction of thioamide 7a peak. Compound 7a showed optimal stability in aqueous 6 phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.4 having a t1/2 equal to 93 min allowing for a good time frame 7 for H2S activity once applied to biological systems. Furthermore, compound 7a resulted to be 8 stable in saline solution at rt. Indeed, compound 7a has a low onset for H2S release in saline 9 solution having a t1/2 equal to 250 min. This corresponds to a negligible loss of H2S due to 10 hydrolysis of the compound and potential H2S volatilization giving a useful time window for 11 compound handling and optimal in vivo administration. Partition coefficients logP and logD 12 were of 2.5 and 1.4, respectively, demonstrating an overall good distribution between 13 hydrophilic and lipophilic phases. Finally, compound 7a was evaluated in silico for its 14 brain/plasma distribution by a statistical method previously developed by the authors [50]. As 15 can be noted in Table S2, compound 7a shows four computed descriptors in the BBB+ scenario 16 (logP, polar surface area, oxygen atom count and ionization state), three in the BBB+/BBB- 17 scenario (hydrogen bound acceptor, nitrogen atom count and nitrogen-oxygen count), while two 18 in the BBB- scenario (logD and hydrogen bound donor) indicating a balanced distribution inside 19\nand outside the bloodbrain barrier. It is worth mentioning that \u03c31 receptors are expressed at 20 highest levels in the peripheral than in the central nervous system, and recent studies show that 21 these peripheral \u03c31 receptors play a pivotal role on pain processing [43]. Compound 2a has been 22\nalso included as reference compound (Table S3). It can be noted that compound 2a, with a 1 logBB of 1.34, has a more BBB+ oriented probabilistic scenario [50]. 2\naEach value is the mean \u00b1 SD of three experiments performed in triplicate. bn-Octanol/water 4 partition coefficients were theoretically calculated by the ChemAxon program JChem for Excel 5 19.9.0.467. 6"

            "text": "This study describes the development of novel hybrid compounds able to release H2S and to bind 8 \u03c31 receptor as candidates for pain treatment. We first started to investigate the role of the \u03c31 9 receptor antagonist BD-1063 or H2S-donor alone (1a) and the association of both mechanisms in 10 capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Later, four hybrid ligands have been developed 11 (5\u20128a) having a 4-carbamothioylphenyl moiety covalently joined to appropriate \u03c3 receptor 12 ligands. To better dig into the precise mechanism, cognate derivatives lacking the thioamide 13 function have been prepared as negative control (5\u20128b). All the compounds have been evaluated 14 for affinity at \u03c3 and opioid receptors and ability to release H2S. The analgesic properties of the 15 synthetized ligands have been evaluated, and a pair of compounds (7a,b) has been identified to 16 reproduce the effect of the combination of 1a and BD-1063 (i.e. the effect of 7a can be reversed 17\nby PRE-084 and it was dependent on H2S release, as the amide control was nearly ineffective). 1 The other pairs of compounds have been excluded for several reasons including imbalanced 2 sigma receptor affinity (5a,b), no maximal effect reached (6a,b), and off-target effects (8a,b). 3 The candidate with the desired in vivo pharmacological profile (7a) has been further evaluated to 4 assess its safety profile, including the blockade of hERG, an off-target related to cardiac toxicity, 5 changes in mean arterial blood pressure and motor-coordination by rotarod performance. The in 6 vitro pharmacokinetic profile has been also evaluated, including water solubility and chemical 7 stability. All these results suggest that the novel developed hybrid \u03c31 antagonist/H2S donor 7a 8 deserves further investigation for its potential use in the management of pain conditions. 9\n4.

Preparation of membrane homogenates from Sprague Dawley rats for MOR and DOR 10 binding assay 11\nSprague Dawley rat brains were homogenized in ice-cold Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The 12 suspension was centrifuged at 40,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-13 cold Tris buffer, incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min and centrifuged at 40,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. 14\nThe final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold Tris buffer and frozen at -80 \u00b0C in 1 mL portions 15\ncontaining about 10 mg protein/mL. 16\n4.2.6. Protein determination 17\nThe protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. The Bradford solution was 18 prepared by dissolving 10 mg of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250 in 5 mL of 95% ethanol. To 19 this solution, 10 mL of 85% phosphoric acid were added and the mixture was stirred and filled to 20 a total volume of 100 mL with ultrapure water. The calibration curve was built with bovine 21\nserum albumin as standard compound at 7 different concentrations ranging from 60 \u00b5g/mL to 1 210 \u00b5g/mL with blank correction. In a 96-well plate, 30 \u00b5L of the calibration solution or 30 \u00b5L 2 of the membrane receptor preparation were mixed with 240 \u00b5L of the Bradford solution, 3 respectively. After 5 min of incubation at rt, the UV absorbance was measured at \u03bb=595 nm 4 using a microplate spectrophotometer reader (Synergy HT, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). 5\n4.2.7. \u03c31 Receptor Ligand Binding Assays 6\nIn vitro \u03c31 receptor ligand binding assays were carried out in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) for 7 150 min at 37 \u00b0C. The thawed membrane preparation of guinea pig brain cortex (250 \u03bcg/sample) 8 was incubated with increasing concentrations of test compounds and [3H](+)-pentazocine (2 nM) 9 in a final volume of 0.5 mL. The Kd value of [3H](+)-pentazocine was 2.9 nM. Unlabeled (+)-10 pentazocine (10 \u03bcM) used to measure non-specific binding. Bound and free radioligand were 11 separated by fast filtration under reduced pressure using a Millipore filter apparatus through 12 Whatman GF/6 glass fiber filters (25 mm diameter), which were presoaked in a 0.5% 13 poly(ethyleneimine) water solution for 120 min. Each filter paper was rinsed three times with 3 14 mL ice-cold Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), dried at rt, and incubated overnight with 3 mL 15 scintillation cocktail into 6 mL pony vials. The bound radioactivity has been determined by 16 liquid scintillation counting. 17\n4.2.8. \u03c32 Receptor Ligand Binding Assays 18\nIn vitro \u03c32 receptor ligand binding assays were carried out in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) for 19 120 min at rt. The thawed membrane preparation of rat liver (250 \u03bcg/sample) was incubated with 20 increasing concentrations of test compounds and [3H]DTG (2 nM) in the presence of (+)-21 pentazocine (5 \u00b5M) as \u03c31 receptor masking agent in a final volume of 0.5 mL. The Kd value of 22\n[3H]DTG was 17.9 nM. Non-specific binding was evaluated with unlabeled DTG (10 \u03bcM). 1 Bound and free radioligand were separated by fast filtration under reduced pressure using a 2 Millipore filter apparatus through Whatman GF/6 glass fiber filters (25 mm diameter), which 3 were presoaked in a 0.5% poly(ethyleneimine) water solution for 120 min. Each filter paper was 4 rinsed three times with 3 mL ice-cold Tris buffer (10 mM, pH 8), dried at rt, and incubated 5 overnight with 3 mL scintillation cocktail into 6 mL pony vials. The bound radioactivity has 6 been determined by liquid scintillation counting. 7\n4.2.9. Opioid Receptor Ligand Binding Assays 8\nMOR and DOR binding experiments were carried out by incubating 400 \u03bcg/sample and 500 9 \u03bcg/sample of rat brain membranes, respectively for 45 min at 35 \u00b0C either with 1 nM [3H]-10 DAMGO or 2 nM [3H]-(2-D-Ala)-[Tyrosyl-3,5-]DELTORPHIN II in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). 11 For KOR binding assays, guinea pig brain membranes (400 \u03bcg/sample) were incubated for 30 12 min at 30 \u00b0C with 1 nM [3H]-U69,593. Test compounds were added in a final volume of 1 mL. 13 The Kd values of [3H]DAMGO, [3H]-(2-D-Ala)-[Tyrosyl-3,5-]DELTORPHIN II and [3H]-14 U69,593 were 1.0, 1.5 and 2.3 nM, respectively. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the 15 presence of 10 \u03bcM of unlabeled naloxone. The reaction was terminated by filtering the solution 16 under reduced pressure using a Millipore filter apparatus through Whatman glass fiber filters 17 GF/C for MOR and DOR, GF/B for KOR, presoaked for 1h in a 0.5% poly(ethyleneimine) 18 solution. Filters were washed with 50 mM ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer (2\u00d74 mL), dried at rt, soaked 19 overnight in 4 mL of scintillation cocktail into 6 mL pony vials and counted on a liquid 20 scintillation counter. 21\n4.2.10. Data analysis 22\nThe Ki-values were calculated with the program GraphPad Prism\u00ae 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San 1 Diego, CA, USA). The Ki-values are given as mean value \u00b1 SD from at least two independent 2 experiments performed in duplicate. 3\n4.3. Fluorescence analysis for H2S determination 4\nH2S generation was measured using WSP-1 at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5M [51]. A 10 mM 5 solution of the appropriate compound in DMSO was diluted with PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) 6 containing 1 mM of surfactant cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) to give the desired final 7 concentration of 100 \u00b5M. The calibration was carried out with NaHS as standard compound at 7 8 different concentrations ranging from 20 \u00b5M to 80 \u00b5M with blank correction. In a 96-well plate, 9 70 \u00b5L of the calibration solution or 70 \u00b5L of the tested compound were mixed with 140 \u03bcl of 10 WSP1 stock solution and diluted at a final volume of 280 \u00b5L with the same buffer. The 11 fluorescence signal was recorded at \u03bb=476 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer reader 12 (Synergy HT, BioTek) for 5 different time periods incubating in the dark at rt. The H2S releasing 13 curves were obtained by plotting H2S concentration versus time. 14\n4.4. In vivo pharmacology 15\n4.4.1. Experimental animals 16\nExperiments were performed in female WT-CD1 (Charles River, Barcelona, Spain) mice 17\nweighing 2530 g. Mice were acclimated in our animal facilities for at least 1 week before 18\ntesting and were housed in a room under controlled environmental conditions: 12/12 h day/night 19 cycle, constant temperature (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C), air replacement every 20 min, and they were fed a 20 standard laboratory diet (Harlan Teklad Research Diet, Madison, WI, USA) and tap water ad 21 libitum until the beginning of the experiments. Behavioral test was conducted during the light 22\nphase (from 9.00 h to 15.00 h), and randomly throughout the oestrous cycle. Animal care was in 1 accordance with institutional (Research Ethics Committee of the University of Granada, Spain), 2 regional (Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, Spain) and international standards (European Communities 3 Council Directive 2010/63). 4\n4.4.2. Drugs and drug administration 5\nThe experimental compounds were dissolved in 5% DMSO (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, 6 Germany) in physiological sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). As selective \u03c31 receptor drugs, we used 7 the \u03c31 receptor antagonist BD-1063 (1\u2012[2\u2012(3,4\u2012dichlorophenyl)ethyl]\u20124\u2012methylpiperazine 8 dihydrochloride) and the \u03c31 receptor agonist PRE-084 (2-(4-morpholinethyl)1]- phenyl 9 cyclohexane carboxylate hydrochloride) [52] (both provided by Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK). 10 Both \u03c31 receptor drugs were dissolved in physiological sterile saline. Drug solutions were 11 prepared immediately before the start of the experiments and injected s.c. in a volume of 5 12 mL/kg into the interscapular area. H2S donors or their controls were injected 30 min before the 13 administration of capsaicin, used as the chemical algogen. When we studied the effects of the 14 association of BD-1063 with 1a or 1b, BD-1063 solution was administered immediately before 15 the other drug. To test for the effects of PRE-084 on the antiallodynia induced by the other 16 drugs, it was administered 5 min before the later. When the effect of the association of several 17 drugs was assessed, each injection was performed in different areas of the interscapular zone to 18 avoid mixture of the drug solutions and any physicochemical interaction between them. 19 Capsaicin (Sigma-Aldrich Qu\u00edmica S.A.) was dissolved in 1% DMSO in physiological sterile 20 saline to a concentration of 0.05 \u03bcg/\u03bcL (i.e., 1 \u03bcg per mouse). Capsaicin solution was injected 21 intraplantarly (i.pl.) into the right hind paw proximate to the heel, in a volume of 20 \u03bcL using a 22\n1710 TLL Hamilton microsyringe (Teknokroma, Barcelona, Spain) with a 301/2-gauge needle. 1 Control animals were injected with the same volume of the vehicle of capsaicin. 2\n4.4.3. Evaluation of capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical hypersensitivity 3\nAnimals were placed for 2 h in individual black-walled test compartments. The test 4 compartments were situated on an elevated mesh-bottomed platform with a 0.5-cm2 grid to 5 provide access to the ventral surface of the hind paws. In all experiments, punctate mechanical 6 stimulation was applied with a Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) 15 7 min after the administration of capsaicin or saline (i.e., 45 min after the injection of the 8 experimental drug). Briefly, a nonflexible filament (0.5 mm diameter) was electronically driven 9 into the ventral side of the right hind paw (which was previously injected with capsaicin or 10 vehicle) at least 5 mm away from the site of the injection towards the fingers. The intensity of 11 the stimulation was fixed at 0.5 g force, as described previously [35]. When a paw withdrawal 12 response occurred, the stimulus was automatically terminated, and the response latency was 13 automatically recorded. The filament was applied three times, separated by intervals of 0.5 min, 14 and the mean value of the three trials was considered the withdrawal latency time of the animal. 15 The degree of effect of drugs on mechanical hypersensitivity induced by capsaicin was 16 calculated as: % reduction in mechanical hypersensitivity = [(LTD - LTS)/(CT - LTS)] x 100, 17 where LTD is latency time in drug-treated animals, LTS is latency time in solvent-treated 18 animals, and CT is the cut-off time (50 s). 19\n4.4.4. Isobolographic analysis of drug effects 20\nTheoretical additive doses (Zadd) for the combination of 1a + BD-1063, in a 1:1 weight ratio, 21 were computed from the equi-effective doses (ED50, ED75, ED90) of the individual compounds, 22\naccording to the method described by Tallarida [39]. The EDs were obtained by non-linear 1 regression of the dose-response data. The respective experimental values (Zexp) were 2 determined from the non-linear regression of the dose-response data of the drug combination, 3 also in a 1:1 weight ratio (3, 5 and 7 mg/kg for each component). The Zadds and Zexps were 4 statistically compared with the use of Student's t-test.[39, 40] We also calculated the interaction 5 index (\u0263) as a measure of the magnitude of the interaction between 1a and BD-1063 at the three 6 levels of effect tested (ED50, ED75, ED90). According to the method previously described, \u0263= 7 Zexp/Zadd [40]. Therefore, \u0263= 1 means no interaction and \u0263< 1 indicates a synergistic 8 interaction. 9\n4.4.5. Rotarod test 10\nMotor coordination was assessed with an accelerating rotarod (Cibertec, Madrid, Spain), as 11 previously described [46]. Briefly, mice were required to walk against the motion of an elevated 12 rotating drum at increasing speed (4 to 40 rpm over 5 min), and the latency to fall down was 13 recorded with a cut-off time of 300 s. Mice were given three training sessions 24 h before drug 14 testing. On the day of the drug test, rotarod latencies were measured immediately before the drug 15 or saline was administered (time 0) and several times (45, 90, 150, and 240 min) after the s.c. 16 injection. As a comparison drug we used pregabalin, which has been reported to impair rotarod 17 performance [46]. 18\n4.4.6. MABP determinations 19\nMice were randomly divided into control and drug-treated groups. To ensure the homogeneity of 20 the groups, arterial pressures were previously determined in conscious pre-warmed restrained 21 mice by tail-cuff plethysmography with a LE 5001 digital pressure meter (Letica, Barcelona, 22\nSpain). The potential hypotensive effect of compound 6a was evaluated using a direct method of 1 recording blood pressure measurement by cannulation in the carotid artery. To carry out the 2 experiment, mice were anesthetized by the intraperitoneal injection of equitensin (2.5 mL/kg), 3 and a polyethylene catheter containing 100U heparin in isotonic, sterile saline solution was 4 inserted in the left carotid artery to monitor intra-arterial blood pressure in conscious, 5 unrestrained conditions. Direct blood pressure was recorded continuously with MacLab (AD 6 Instruments, Hastings, UK). Blood pressure was measured before the drug or saline was 7 administered (time 0) and several times (15, 30 and 45 minutes) after the s.c. injection. MABP 8 values obtained during these times were averaged for intergroup comparisons [53]. 9\n4.5. Measure of hERG activity 10\nElectrophysiological experiments were performed in CHO-K1 cells which express human ERG 11 using a Qube APC assay. Compound 7a has been tested employing six different concentrations 12 ranging from 10-10 to 10-5 M using serial dilution by Eurofins Panlabs (St Charles, MO, United 13 States) according to their standard assay protocol. Briefly, after whole cell configuration is 14 achieved, the cell is held at -80 mV. The cell is held at this voltage for 50 ms to measure the 15 leaking current, which is subtracted from the tail current on-line. Then the cell is depolarized to 16 +40 mV for 500 ms and then to -80 mV over a 100ms ramp to elicit the hERG tail current. This 17 paradigm is delivered once every 8s to monitor the current amplitude. All data were filtered for 18 seal quality, seal drop, and current amplitude. The peak current amplitude was calculated before 19 and after addition of the test compound, and the amount of block was assessed by dividing the 20 test compound current amplitude by the control current amplitude. 21\n4.6. Evaluation of chemical stability 22\n4.6.1. Stability in 50 mM Phosphate Buffer (pH 7.4) 1\nBefore addition of compound 7a, the medium was preheated at 37 \u00b0C. A 10 mM solution in 2 DMSO was added to have a final concentration of 200 \u03bcM. The resulting solution was incubated 3 at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C, and at appropriate time intervals, an amount of 500 \u03bcL of the reaction mixture 4 was withdrawn and added to 500 \u03bcL of acetonitrile. The samples were vortexed and filtered by 5 0.45 \u03bcm filters and analyzed by UHPLC-PDA. Three individual experiments were run in 6 triplicate. Stability in physiological saline solution 0.9% (w/w). A 10 mM solution in DMSO of 7 compound 7a was added to the medium to have a final concentration of 200 \u03bcM. The resulting 8 solution was stirred at rt, and at appropriate time intervals, an amount of 500 \u03bcL of the reaction 9 mixture was withdrawn and added to 500 \u03bcL of acetonitrile. The samples were vortexed and 10 filtered by 0.45 \u03bcm filters and analyzed by UHPLC-PDA. Three individual experiments were run 11 in triplicate. Data analysis. The half-life (t1/2) of compound 7a in each medium was determined 12 by fitting the data with one phase exponential decay equation using Prism software 7.00 (Graph 13 Pad, San Diego, CA, USA). 14\n4.6.2. Water solubility 15\nAqueous solubility was determined by UHPLC-PDA analysis. First, 5 mg of 7a (free base) were 16 weighted and added to 1 mL of ultrapure water. The suspension was shaken at rt for 24 h and 17 then centrifuged, and the supernatant filtered by 0.45 \u03bcm filters. The supernatant was diluted in 18 methanol before analysis. The compound is quantified against a methanol calibration curve built 19 over 7 dilution concentrations ranging from 50 \u00b5M to 200 \u00b5M with blank correction. 20\nDeclaration of competing interest 21\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest. 22\nAcknowledgment 1\nThe authors acknowledge the Bio-nanotech Research and Innovation Tower of University of 2 Catania (BRIT-UNICT) for instrumental support of the Thermo Scientific UHPLC/PAD-FL 3 Chromatography UltiMate3000 RSLC system.
