    "abstractText": "Children with cerebral palsy (CP) often show executive function (EF) impairments that are key to quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess whether a home-based computerized intervention program improves executive functions (EFs) compared to usual care. Sixty participants (30 females) with CP (8\u201312 years old) were paired by age, sex, motor ability, and intelligence quotient score and then randomized to intervention and waitlist control groups. The intervention group received a 12-week home-based computerized EF intervention (5 days/week, 30 min/day, total dose 30 h). Core and higher-order EFs were assessed before, immediately after, and 9 months after completing the intervention. The intervention group performed better than the waitlist control group in the three core EFs (immediately and 9 months after the intervention): inhibitory control (F = 7.58, p = 0.13 and F = 7.85, p = 0.12), working memory (F = 8.34, p = 0.14 and F = 7.55, p = 0.13), and cognitive flexibility (F = 4.87, p = 0.09 and F = 4.19, p = 0.08). No differences were found between the groups in higher-order EFs or EF manifestations in daily life. Conclusions: A home-based computerized EF intervention improved core EFs in children with CP, but further research is needed to identify strategies that allow the transfer of these improvements to everyday life. Trial registration: NCT04025749 retrospectively registered on 19 July 2019. What is Known: \u2022 One in two children with cerebral palsy has an intellectual impairment. Visual perception and executive functions are the most reported specific cognitive deficits. \u2022 The majority of interventions for cerebral palsy focus on motor impairments, but only a few randomized controlled trials have explored the effect of interventions on executive functions. What is New: \u2022 A home-based computerized cognitive intervention can improve the core executive functions of children with cerebral palsy. \u2022 Shortand long-term effects on core executive functions have been found.",

            "text": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a major cause of physical disability in children, with a median estimated prevalence of 1.6 per 1000 live births [1]. CP is described as a group of permanent disorders that affect the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitations attributed to nonprogressive disturbances that occur in the developing fetal or infant brain and persist throughout life [2]. This motor function impairment is often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, cognition, perception, communication, behavior, and epilepsy [2\u20134].\nOne in two children with CP has an intellectual impairment [5], which may be more disabling than the motor impairment itself [6, 7]. Visual perception [6] and executive functions (EFs) [8] are the most reported specific cognitive deficits in children with CP.\nEFs include a set of complex cognitive skills that work together to direct behavior for decision-making and action planning and play a critical role in behavior and emotional control in daily life [9, 10]. EFs develop throughout childhood and adolescence and are essential for mental and physical health, daily life functioning, and academic achievement [9, 10].\nAccording to Diamond [11], there are three core EFs: inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. Inhibitory control allows individuals to control their attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure. Working memory refers to the ability to hold information in mind and mentally process it. Cognitive flexibility is described as the ability to change perspectives or approaches to a problem and refers to flexibility in adjusting to new demands, rules, or priorities. These three core EFs constitute the fundamental base of higher-order EFs: reasoning, problem solving, and planning [11].\nDifficulties in all three core EF domains (inhibitory control, working memory, and flexibility) are found in children with CP [7, 8, 12\u201318]. Furthermore, higher-order EF impairments have been reported in individuals with CP [7, 8, 13]. Some of the abovementioned studies used performancebased tests [8, 12\u201319], and others also used rating scales [7, 8, 15, 19], which are both necessary for the clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders, as they assess different aspects of EFs [9, 20, 21]. Considering that EF deficits have been identified in children with CP and the relationship between these deficits and the quality of life of people with CP [22], there is a clear need for EF interventions targeting people with CP.\nThe majority of interventions for CP focus on motor impairments [5, 23\u201325], but only a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have explored the effect of interventions (multimodal, physical, and cognitive) on EF. Specifically,\nsome studies reported inhibitory control improvements immediately after multimodal [26], physical [19], or cognitive interventions [27]. Only a cognitive intervention showed efficacy in improving working memory immediately postintervention [27]. No previous short-term positive effects after multimodal, physical, or cognitive interventions on the core EF of cognitive flexibility were shown [28]. Only one multimodal study was previously conducted to determine the long-term follow-up effects on core EF outcomes. The results of that study (which did not include a control group) showed improvements in cognitive flexibility 6\u00a0months after the intervention [29]. Short-term positive effects of a multimodal intervention have only been found for the higher-order EF of reasoning [30]. Until now, there have been no studies targeting cognitive interventions that attempt to improve all core EF components with the same intervention, testing the effect on higher-order EFs and on daily life performance in children with CP. The present study was aimed at testing whether a home-based computerized cognitive intervention had positive short- and long-term effects on all core and higher-order EFs and manifestations of EF in daily life in children with CP."

During the first 6\u00a0weeks, the intervention mainly focused on all three core EFs. The higher-order EF intervention, including some social cognition tasks, was introduced after the sixth week. According to the distribution program, the total intervention dose was 20.6\u00a0h for the core EF intervention and 9.4\u00a0h for the higher-order EFs/ social cognition intervention. The EF intervention started at the basic level of difficulty and was gradually adjusted automatically. Manual adjustment of the sessions was necessary in some cases, such as rescheduling sessions missed due to illness, holiday, or homework.\nTo mainly ensure that the participants received the full dose, the following adherence strategies were used: (1) information strategies: a personalized schedule decorated with pictures related to the children\u2019s interests was delivered, including program instructions, important appointments for neuropsychological assessments, and a special\n1 3\nspace to record the activities that the children carried out during these 12\u00a0weeks. (2) Flexibility: each week, each family would elect 5\u00a0days across which to complete ten short sessions; (3) Gaming: the tasks chosen were those with an appearance similar to videogames. (4) Motivational monitoring: during the intervention period, motivational monitoring was carried out by providing personalized immediate messages on platforms such as WhatsApp. Messages were sent weekly to assess motivation and compliance with the previous week\u2019s tasks, which allowed for a minimal standardization of follow-up. After the initial messages, the subsequent messages were always personalized to the children\u2019s preferences and family dynamics. Through these messages, the therapist highlighted positive aspects of the children\u2019s performance to increase motivation and intervention adherence. (5) Expert diploma: all participants were informed that after completing the intervention, they would receive a \u201cNeuronUp\u2019s expert diploma.\u201d The same information strategies, motivational monitoring, and expert diploma were applied to the control group."

The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was used to test each variable\u2019s normality. Summary statistics are reported as the mean (standard deviation), median (minimum\u2013maximum), or frequency (percentage) depending on the measurement scale of the variables analyzed. Several physical (pain), mental (autism symptoms and daily difficulties), and environmental (family quality of life and parental stress) variables were considered as potential covariates [40\u201344]. Correlations between baseline outcomes and these potential covariates were performed (Pearson\u2019s, Spearman\u2019s, or Kendall\u2019s correlation test depending on the measurement scales), applying Bonferroni\u2019s correction (significance level\n1 3\nof p = 0.01). Only potential covariates that were significantly correlated with the baseline outcomes were included as covariates in our models. To test the effectiveness of the intervention, comparisons between the intervention group and waitlist control group postintervention and at the 9-month follow-up were performed by a series of ANCOVAs (analysis of covariance), with baseline assessments used as covariates in all analyses. The statistical assumptions required for the ANCOVAs, such as the normal distribution of the tested variables, were previously checked. Effect size was assessed by means of the partial eta-squared ( 2\np )\nindex, considering 0\u20130.05 as small, 0.06\u20130.13 as medium, and \u2265 0.14 as large effect sizes [52].\nFinally, we performed complementary intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis with R (version 4.1.0; R core Team, 2021), which is available as supplementary material (S4 and S5), to assess the potential bias resulting from the withdrawal of 3 participants. For each given outcome, a longitudinal imputation procedure was applied to the data of individuals who underwent the baseline assessment for that outcome (CopyMean-LOCF procedure; [53, 54]). Then, a series of ANCOVAs including the same covariates as the ANCOVAs applied in the per-protocol analysis were performed for each outcome. The imputation procedure carried out in the present study proved to be optimal when there were monotone missing data (for further details, see 54)."

            "text": "The main findings of this study suggest that a computerized intensive and progressively challenging EF home intervention improved core EFs performance (inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) in children with CP. Core EF differences between the groups in some tasks were also demonstrated at the 9-month follow-up after completing the intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a 30-h cognitive intervention improved performance in some tasks covering all core EFs.\nThis positive effect in the core EFs may translate to large and significant improvements in behavior, attention, thoughts, and/or emotional control [56]. Specifically, improvements in inhibitory control meant that children\u2019s ability to focus on what they chose increased, instead of focusing on making better decisions about what was more appropriate or needed, by suppressing their attention to other stimuli [11]. These improvements align with previous RCTs\n1 3\nwith a low risk of bias that showed significant improvements in inhibitory control with multimodal and cognitive interventions immediately after the interventions [28]. Long-term\neffects, however, were not explored in these studies. Working memory changes, reported in the present study, implied that children\u2019s capacity to hold information in mind for a\nFig. 3 Graphical representation of differences between intervention and waitlist groups in working memory.

Consistent with our results, Di Lieto et\u00a0al. [27] found that children with CP presented significant improvements in working memory immediately after receiving a 5-week computerized cognitive intervention but not at follow-up [21]. Finally, cognitive flexibility improvements suggested that the intervention increased the children\u2019s ability to be more flexible between different tasks. This flexibility may allow children to adjust to changing demands or priorities, to admit what is wrong, and to take advantage of sudden unexpected opportunities [11]. Previous studies have not shown beneficial effects on cognitive flexibility after multimodal or cognitive interventions [26, 27, 56]. Although Mak et\u00a0al. [26] in 2018 did not find improvements in cognitive flexibility immediately after the intervention, delayed effects were found 6\u00a0months later [29].\nImprovements in higher-order EFs have only been found in reasoning using a reality-based rehabilitation program for children with CP [30]. In the present study, we did not find significant differences in higher-order EFs related to planning. Previous RCTs with a low risk of bias also showed no improvements using the same planning measure (Tower test) as that used in the present study [56].\nPiovesana et\u00a0al. [56] discussed that their negative results might be because the cognitive challenges of their multimodal intervention were not focused on EFs. In the present study, the intervention specifically targeted EFs. We therefore concluded that the lack of beneficial effects on higherorder EF outcomes could be due to insufficient training time dedicated to higher-order EF tasks. Specifically, from the 30-h total dose in the present study, only 33% of the dose corresponded to tasks targeting higher-order EFs. Future studies should explore whether increasing the dose of higher-order EF training results in significant improvements in this domain.\nIdentifying the optimal dose is a key factor to guarantee maximum adherence to treatment. Such an optimal dose allowing positive results in core EFs is highly variable in previous studies. For example, Ahn et\u00a0al. [19] found that the optimal intervention dose was 21.3\u00a0h, reported as a mean. In the study by Di Lieto et\u00a0al. [27], the intervention dose ranged from 8 to 18\u00a0h. Finally, Mak et\u00a0al. [26] reported 12.5\u00a0h as the mean intervention dose. In the present study, we allowed flexibility for reaching the total dose (each week, the participants could elect the 5\u00a0days across which to complete the ten sessions, and several motivational strategies were used to\n1 3\nimprove participant and family engagement). These aspects allowed a small variability in the total dose achieved (26 to 30\u00a0h), which represents an attrition rate of only 5%.\nOnce the optimal dose has been identified, computerized interventions such as the one in this study may also be key to achieving it. Computerized cognitive interventions can be beneficial for children with various conditions, including CP, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and learning difficulties [57, 58]. These interventions improved cognitive skills, such as working memory and flexibility skills, in children with ADHD or ASD [59, 60]. A systematic review of children with and without neuropsychological disorders also stated that this type of intervention is effective in improving cognitive skills [57]. Additionally, creating EF intervention opportunities outside of the rehabilitation center setting could provide more parental agency in the rehabilitation process and a more collaborative and supportive approach to an intervention in the natural environment, leading to greater compliance with programs, reducing stress levels, and improving outcomes.\nOur results did not prove positive effects on manifestations of executive functioning in daily life, assessed with a rating scale that measures core and higher-order EFs. The results of this study reinforce the idea that performancebased tests and rating scales assess different EF aspects [9, 20]. Both instruments are complementary and should be used for assessing EFs. In this way, this could help to characterize the impairment and consequently prove the right support for patients and caregivers. Overall, our results are consistent with previous studies in other child populations related to EFs, such as populations with ASD, ADHD, or learning difficulties, in which transfer effects on manifestations of EF in daily life have not been reported [9, 20, 21]. Thus, further research is needed to clarify intervention characteristics and the assessment tools used to check intervention effects. These studies may also propose interventions that include face-to-face interventions and specific professional advice that allow the transfer of changes to manifestations of EF in daily life.\nA limitation of the present study is that it did not include children across all MACS levels. Only participants at levels I\u2013III were included to homogenize the characteristics of the sample and the effective time of the cognitive intervention among participants. Moreover, adaptations in the cognitive assessment were applied for one participant with vision impairment. In this participant, a computerized, instead of paper, version of the FDT was used. Additionally, we did not include an active control group because almost all cognitive tasks imply some level of EF. Other factors might be of interest to consider in cognitive intervention effectiveness, such as nutritional status [61, 62] or sleep disorders [63]. In\naddition, some families needed three more weeks (15\u00a0weeks instead of 12) to reach the total dose due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the pandemic might also have influenced, to some degree, children\u2019s responses to treatment due to the potential decrease in their general health as a result of the disruption in health and rehabilitation services [64]."
