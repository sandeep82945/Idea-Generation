This method was based on QuEChERS with dispersive solid-phase where C18 sorbent and anhydrous sodium sulfate were used to sample purification. After evaporation and reconstitution, the samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandemmass spectrometry. The mean recovery results were all higher than 60% except ampicillin, pipemidic acid, enoxacin, and estriol, and the relative standard deviation was <20.0%. The limit of quantification ranged between 0.1 and 5 \u00b5g/kg for milk and between 0.5 and 25 \u00b5g/kg for milk powder. It was successfully used to detect residues of veterinary drug in real samples. This study proposes a simple and fast analytical method for monitoring multi-class veterinary drug residues to ensure food safety.\nKEYWORDS\nrapid detection, veterinary drug residues, milk, dairy products, UPLC-MS/MS\nIntroduction\nMilk and dairy products already enter thousands of households for their sweet and delicious taste, rich nutrition, easy digestion and absorption, and suitable for all ages in China. To protect milk consumers\u2019 health, it is essential to ensure that the products marketed are suitable. Because veterinary drugs are widely and sometimes incorrectly used in livestock breeding, residues of antibiotics, hormones, and anticoccidials, have been the main potential threats for the safety of milk and dairy products either\nFrontiers inNutrition 01 frontiersin.org\nGuo et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.879518\nas original compounds or metabolites. The presence of veterinary drug residues in food poses potential health risk to consumers as they could cause allergic reactions, present carcinogenic or teratogenic mechanisms, or induce antimicrobial resistance (1). Consequently, the highest residue of sulfonamides, quinolones, lincoamides, macrolides, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, benzimidazoles, and triazines in the relevant laws and regulations formulated by many countries and regions such as China, European, and United States were at the \u00b5g/kg level (2\u20135). Chloramphenicol, nitroimidazole drugs and their metabolites, as well as some hormones, have potential animal carcinogenesis, teratogenicity, mutagenicity and genotoxicity, which have been listed as prohibited drugs or banned in dairy animals in many countries. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the drug residue in dairy products.\nAt present, the main methods for the determination of veterinary drug residues in animal-derived foods are highperformance liquid chromatography tandemmass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) (6). The method for the determination of veterinary drug residue in a single category has been more mature. However, because most of the animal diseases are mixed infection, two or more different kinds of drugs are often used in clinical treatment. Therefore, the simultaneous detection of multiple residues of veterinary drugs is a new method studied in recent years (7\u201315). In sample preparation, most of the commonly used methods for the analysis of veterinary drug residue in foods were liquid-liquid extraction, solid phase extraction, but the operations were complicated and timeconsuming. Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe is a rapid pre-treatment method developed in recent years, which can be used to extract the target compound from the samples by a convenient, economical and rapid way (16\u201318). The main applications of quantitative multi-analyte methods in determination of veterinary drug residues in milk and other animal derived foods are presented in Table 1. In this work, 103 veterinary drugs, including sulfonamides, (fluoro)quinolones, nitroimidazoles and their metabolites, lincoamides, macrolides, \u03b2-lactams, benzimidazoles and their metabolites, exogenous estrogens, chloramphenicols, glucocorticoids, and triazines were simultaneously determined by QuEChERS combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Compared with previous literatures, this work is more targeted and covers almost all possible veterinary drug contaminants in animal husbandry in China; isotope internal standard method is as much as possible used to qualify the analytes, then the result is more accurate; and the extraction and purification of target analytes with different chemical properties were realized by the simplest sample pretreatment method. This simple method, including sample extraction and data processing, allowed for highthroughput testing of milk samples to monitor veterinary drug residues."

According to the different chemical properties of each compound, the recovery rates of each target substance were investigated when methanol, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, and methanol-acetonitrile (1:1) were used as extractants, respectively. It was found that when extracted with ethyl acetate and methanol solution, the fat was too much, the effect of removing impurities was not good, and the recovery rate of penicillin drugs was not easy to be concentrated by nitrogen blowing, and the recovery rate of penicillin drugs was not easy to be controlled when extracted with methanol-acetonitrile (1:1), only nitroimidazole drugs and some sulfonamides and (fluoro)quinolones were recovered in the positive mode, and the protein precipitation was not complete. When acetonitrile is a polar solvent, it can avoid extracting too much fat from the tissue and has a good protein deposition effect at the same time. Therefore, it was preliminarily determined that acetonitrile was used as extraction solvent. Because sulfonamides, nitroimidazoles, and quinolones are amphoteric substances, they are more easily extracted in acidic extraction solvents. Macrolides, lincosamides drugs and benzimidazole drugs belong to weak basic substances, and the pKa values of all kinds of drugs are quite different.

The effect of 1% formic acid and 1% acetic acid on the extraction efficiency of all kinds of drugs was not consistent. The extraction efficiency of (fluoro)quinolones with acidic acetonitrile was better, but the extraction rate of erythromycin decreased under acidic acetonitrile, which may be due to the hydrolysis of glycoside bonds. However, considering that the same pretreatment method should be shared with the negative model, acidity has a great influence on the substance of the negative mode. Considering the factors affecting the extraction efficiency and protein removal of all kinds of drugs, especially the effect on the stability of drugs under acidic and alkaline conditions, acetonitrile was used to extract all kinds of drugs without adding acid. Supplementary Figure 1 showed the results of typical compounds with different chemical properties using different extractions.When the sample is extracted, proper amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate can effectively prevent the moisture and water-soluble impurities in the sample from entering the extract solution. Sodium sulfate also has salting out effect, which is helpful to improve the extraction efficiency. Then, in the extraction add 5 g anhydrous sodium sulfate and extract twice with acetonitrile."

            "text": "Two purification methods, liquid-liquid partition extraction and solid phase extraction, were compared. Waters HLB column, MCX column and MAX column were used to purify the compounds, but because there were too many kinds of veterinary drugs, the properties of the compounds varied greatly and were not easy to be controlled (see Supplementary Figure 2). For example, sulfonamides were easy to be lost after solid phase extraction column, and the recovery rate was on the\nlow side. The results of SPE Therefore, in this experiment, the purification method of SPE was abandoned, and the dispersed solid phase extraction (QuEChERS) with less time consuming and low analysis cost was selected. The general rapid pretreatment method of 103 compounds should not only consider the recoveries, but also effectively purify the matrix and reduce the influence of impurities. However, the existing commercial QuEChERS adsorbents or purification tubes are not suitable for the pretreatment of various drug residue with different physical and chemical properties. Commonly used adsorbents include C18, primary secondary amine (PSA), Flori silica, and graphitized carbon black (GCB). When adsorbing impurities, the adsorbents may also adsorb the target compounds, which may affect the recovery rate of the target compounds. Therefore, when selecting the adsorbents, we should try our best to select the adsorbents which have little influence on the target compounds. As a strong polar absorbent, Flori silica cannot remove lipid and carbohydrate impurities; GCB is usually used to remove pigment components from plant extract, because it can adsorb strong drugs with benzene ring functional groups, which has a great impact on the recovery of most penicillin, quinolones, sulfonamides and benzimidazoles; PSA can effectively remove fatty acids and sterols from the matrix, but there are fat residue in the purified extract, and PSA can adsorb acidic drugs as alkaline adsorption fillers. C18 can effectively remove lipophilic impurities such as lipids and carbohydrates, but excessive C18 can also adsorb lipophilic drugs. Therefore, combined with the above factors, the purification effect of C18 and anhydrous sodium sulfate was investigated. The C18 of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500mg was used for purification, and it was found that when the amount of C18 powder was added, the solution was mixed into a yellowish clear solution. Although the amount of C18 powder was toomuch, the purification effect was good, but some of the target substances\nFrontiers inNutrition 10 frontiersin.org\nGuo et al. 10.3389/fnut.2022.879518\nwere adsorbed (see Supplementary Figure 3). Therefore, a good balance between purification effect and recovery can be obtained by usingmixed adsorbents of 100mgC18 and 300mg anhydrous sodium sulfate per gram of sample. The extract optimized by QuEChERS was yellowish and transparent, and the overall recovery was 31.1\u2013120.7%."

In the positive mode, the separation condition can be met by changing the elution condition of the mobile phase by continuously changing the elution condition of the mobile phase. However, because of the large polarity of some substances in the penicillins, the stability and the linearity of this kind of substance have obvious advantages when using T3 column. Therefore, HSS T3 is selected as analytical column, and the co-isomer of the positive mode scanning is taken as an example for the separation of sulfameter, sulfamethoxypyridazine, and sulfamonomethoxine. The separation chromatograms were shown in Figure 1; the negative pattern can be separated from the isomer by the HSS T3 column, and the separation degree can be maintained. Take estradiol as an example, seeing Figure 2.\nIn the mobile phase selection, methanol and acetonitrile were selected as the strong eluting mobile phase. The experimental results show that when methanol is used as mobile phase, the ionization of some drugs is inhibited to varying degrees, the peak shape widens, the abundance\ndecreases obviously, and the sensitivity decreases, while the ionization efficiency of acetonitrile is obviously better than that of methanol, so the mobile phase is strongly eluted with acetonitrile. In positive mode, 0.1% formic acid solution, aqueous solution and 5 mmol/L amine acetate (containing 0.1% acetic acid) were selected as aqueous phase (A), acetonitrile as organic phase (B). The mobile phase selection of UPLC was carried out. The results showed that the peak shape of sulfonamides and quinolones was wide when aqueous solution was used as phase A, penicillin was unstable and some substances were poor when 5 mmol/L acetic acid (containing 0.1% acetic acid) was used as phase A when 0.1% formic acid solution was used as phase A, most of the substances such as sulfonamides quinolones were in ion state, the peak shape was sharp symmetry, and the signal response of mass spectrometry was enhanced.

The responses of 80 analytes in positive ion scanning modes were higher than in the negative ion scanning modes, and for the other 23 analytes were the reverse. The all parent ions were all molecular ion of [M+H] + or [M\u2013H]\u2013, except glucocorticoids, for which the ions of [M+HCOOH-H]- have the best responses. The daughter ions were analyzed by full scan, and two characteristic daughter ions were selected, in which the ion pairs with high signal to noise ratio, good peak shape, and small interference were used as quantitative ions.
