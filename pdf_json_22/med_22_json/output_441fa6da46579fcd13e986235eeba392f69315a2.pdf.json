    "abstractText": "A hydrothermal sol\u2013gel method for reproducible formation of silica nanolayer on the wall of silica capillaries was developed for electrochromatography. The formulation was optimized by observation of uniform gel formation on an optical microscope. The variables of the formulation include types of solvent, water-TEOS ratio, CTAB and urea contents, and mixing method. The procedure produced a coating of silica ca. 100 nm thick layer on the wall of the capillary. Surface morphology of the coating was characterized by SEM, contact angle and chemical composition by FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The coating reduced the electroosmotic mobility producing enhanced separation performance. Eight standard amines (including tyramine and benzhydrylamine, as an internal standard) were separated with peak resolution Rs \u2265 2 for all adjacent peaks and plate number N \u2265 3.0 \u00d7 104 m-1. Calibration was linear from 5 to 200 \u03bcg L-1, with r2 > 0.9985 and instrumental LOD of 4.9 \u03bcg L-1. Five samples of food products were diluted and analyzed for the amines using the coated capillary and only tyramine was detected. Intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 1.2%RSD. Percent recoveries of spiked tyramine in samples were 95 \u00b1 3 to 106 \u00b1 7% (n = 3).",

For the former, studies of electrolytes and additives for modifying the electroosmotic flow (EOF) have been reported3. Another approach is to coat the inner wall of the silica capillary with covalently bonded chemical compounds or with a nanometer layer of material4\u20136. The latter can be carried out by polymerization or sol\u2013gel formation. Review articles of these methods have been published7,8.\nThe coatings on the inner wall of capillaries comprise a variety of materials, such as metal- framework9, zinc oxide nanoparticles9 and nanocellulose crystals 10. Methods of coating include layer-by-layer assembly11, polymerization12 and sol- gel process 13. If the resulting coating is porous, the capillary is often named as a porous layer open-tubular (PLOT) capillary. Sol\u2013gel processes are commonly employed for the formation of porous layer on the inner wall of a silica capillary. It is simple, convenient and efficient, involving only hydrolysis and polycondensation of an alkoxide precursor. Removal of the solvent gives the xerogel or aerogel and after a heating step the final solid structure14. Table\u00a01 lists the compositions of the various sol\u2013gel mixtures and conditions for gel formation, together with the characterization of the coating and application of the coated capillary10,13,15\u201317.\nHowever, the method of using the sol\u2013gel process to form a consistent thin layer on the inner wall of a 50\u00a0\u00b5m i.d. capillary is still a subject of study 13.

The coated capillary will provide stable and more efficient performance for capillary electrochromatography (CEC) application.\nTyramine is a biogenic amine commonly found in food and beverages18,19. However, its accumulation is of health concern. High amount of tyramine, e.g. 200\u20132000\u00a0mg per meal, can produce high blood pressure or trigger migraine attack. Consumption of low levels of tyramine (6\u00a0mg per meal) has been reported to produce side effects and high blood pressure in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors as antidepressant19,20 and avoiding tyramine in food and drink products are necessary for such patients21,22. Methods for the determination of tyramine in beverages and food have been reported using high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC\u2013UV)23,24. These methods involve solid-phase extraction23 and derivatization25. Determination of tyramine employing HPLC and GC methods have limits of detection of 0.38\u00a0\u03bcg L-126 and 1\u00a0\u03bcg L-127, respectively. Capillary electrophoresis with UV absorbance or fluorescence emission has been used, with the latter requiring derivatization procedure 28. Although UV absorbance has limitation of sensitivity due to the very short optical path length, the CE method23,29,30 has sufficient sensitivity for analysis of tyramine at the mg L-1 level (see Table\u00a02). However, detection at lower levels will be required for the determination of tyramine in food and beverages consumed by patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant drugs20.\nIn this work, the coated capillaries are tested for efficiency of separation of eight amine compounds including tyramine and benzhydrylamine (used as the internal standard). The capillaries are then applied for the detection of tyramine in various food products using dilution as the only sample preparation step. The sensitivity of the analysis and advantages of the method are compared with previous works."

Figure\u00a01 is the schematics of the procedure for the hydrothermal sol\u2013gel coating of the inner wall of a capillary. A fused silica capillary (360\u00a0\u00b5m o.d. and 50\u00a0\u00b5m i.d.) is first cleaned and preconditioned by flushing with MeOH-H2O (50% v/v) for 5\u00a0min, then with 1.0\u00a0M NaOH for 30\u00a0min and finally with ultrapure water for 5\u00a0min. A syringe pump (model CEC-MSP-001, Unimicro Technologies, CA, USA) with a 0.5-mL syringe connected to 0.25- mm i.d. TYGON\u00ae tubing is used with the flow rate set at 3.0 \u00b5L min-1. The conditioned capillary is then dried with a nitrogen stream at room temperature for 15\u00a0min. The sol\u2013gel mixture is then prepared using the optimized formulation, viz. cyclohexane (3.00\u00a0mL), TEOS (500 \u00b5L), ultrapure water (3.00\u00a0mL), CTAB (100\u00a0mg), urea (60.0\u00a0mg), 0.10\u00a0mM acetic acid (440 \u00b5L), and 1-pentanol (92 \u00b5L). The mixture is homogenized using the ultrasonic probe (2\u00a0kHz, 20 watts) for 30\u00a0s. The mixture is then immediately pumped into the capillary at the flow rate of 3.0 \u00b5L min-1 for 5\u00a0min using the syringe pump. The ends of the capillary are then sealed with GC septa and the capillary heated in a gas chromatography oven (HP 6890A, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 4\u00a0h at 70\u00a0\u00b0C (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in Supplementary Information A for the temperature program). It is found that heating for longer than 4\u00a0h resulted in the gel clogging the capillary. After cooling, the capillary is flushed with ethanol followed by water for 5\u00a0min each, to remove the residual reagents, and dried with a nitrogen stream for 15\u00a0min. The silica nanolayer coated capillaries are stored at 50\u00a0\u00b0C in a glassware drying oven until employed.\nProcedure for selection of sol\u2013gel formulation for capillary coating. Experiments were first carried out to find a suitable formulation that will give uniform formation of silica nanolayer on the wall of silica capillary. The various formulations and mixing methods are given in Table\u00a0S1 in Supplementary Information A. Each sol\u2013gel mixture (ca. 7\u00a0mL) is homogenized either by vortex mixing (VTX-3000L model, LMS Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or by ultrasonication (TT13 probe, HD2200 model, BANDELIN, Berlin, Germany).\nFor each formulation, a small amount of the mixture is deposited on a microscope glass slide and covered with a cover slip. The inspection of sol\u2013gel formation is followed with an optical microscope (CH-Series, Olympus America Inc., PA, USA). Images are recorded at 10 \u00d7 magnification and analyzed using DinoCapture 2.0 software (AnMo Electronics Corporation, New Taipei, Taiwan). The criteria for selection of the suitable sol\u2013gel formulation and mixing method are the size of the immiscible droplets, their distribution and the time for the formation of the droplets (Fig.\u00a02A). The remaining mixture is visually monitored for gel formation with intermittent\nTable 2.

The coated capillaries were cut horizontally and at a bevel angle. Details of the procedure are given in Fig.\u00a0S2 in Supplementary Information B. Prior to SEM imaging, the nanolayer coating was deposited with a thin film (~ 10\u00a0nm) of conductive gold layer to prevent charging of the surface layer before mounting for the measurements.\nContact angle (CA): A sessile water drop contact angle measurements were performed using ultrapure water and a contact angle goniometer (model G-1, KR\u00dcSS GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (iPhone 6s). A 5.0 \u00b5L volume of water was placed on the substrate surface (either non-coated or coated glass slide) using a micro syringe pipette. Images of the water drop were taken immediately after depositing on the glass slide surface. The left and right contact angles of the water drops were measured (three replicates, n = 6) using ImageJ software with Plugin (see Supplementary Information B for the operation steps of the measurements).\nCapillary electrophoresis with UV detection. The capillary electrophoresis instrument was assembled in-house, comprising a high voltage power supply (Spellman CZE1000R, Hauppauge, NY, USA) and a microcell UV detector (785A UV detector, Applied Biosystem, CA, USA). Fused silica capillaries (360\u00a0\u00b5m o.d. and 50\u00a0\u00b5m i.d.) were from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix, AZ, USA). A length of 60.0\u00a0cm, with effective length of 38.0\u00a0cm, was used. Conditioning of non-coated and coated capillaries were carried out by sequentially flushing with 0.1\u00a0M NaOH, ultrapure water and running buffer for 5\u00a0min each, at flow rate of 3.0 \u00b5L min-1, using the syringe pump. The separation conditions are electrokinetic injection for 3.0\u00a0s at 400\u00a0V\u00a0 cm-1, applied potential of 400\u00a0V\u00a0 cm-1 and UV detection at 200\u00a0nm.

Various formulations of sol\u2013gel mixture were investigated for reproducibility and uniformity of a coated layer. Formulations for sol\u2013gel formation can be composed of various components such as silicon alkoxide precursor (e.g. tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS), tetrapropyl orthosilicate (TPOS)32, organic solvent (e.g. alcohol, ether), gelating agent (e.g. urea, urea derivative)33, stabilizer (e.g. cationic surfactant)34, acid or base catalyst32.

A small amount was inspected under an optical microscope (see \u201cProcedure for selection of sol-gel formulation for capillary coating\u201d section and Fig.\u00a02A) and the gelation time of the remaining mixture recorded (see \u201cProcedure for selection of sol-gel formulation for capillary coating\u201d section).\nThe amount of the various components and the method of mixing (vortex or sonication), were varied in a univariate manner to find the optimal formulation as observed by optical spectroscopy (see \u201cProcedure for selection of sol-gel formulation for capillary coating\u201d section). Observation of sol\u2013gel coating by optical microscopy was previously employed to study uniformity of sol\u2013gel deposition on silicon substrate35,36. Summary of the results are described below.\n(i) Solvent type. A 3.0\u00a0mL aliquot of eight solvents were tested, viz. DMSO, TBME, benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, hexane, 1-octanol, and pentane, with vortex mixing for 30\u00a0s. The optical images for the various solvents are shown in Fig.\u00a02B(i). Formation of uniform droplets was observed only for cyclohexane, hexane, 1-octanol and pentane, respectively. The time for formation of gel in the bulk mixture ranged from less than one minute (for pentane) to more than 30\u00a0min. However, samples of the sol\u2013gel mixture containing cyclohexane gave more stable immiscible droplets than for 1-octanol or hexane. Thus 3.0\u00a0mL of cyclohexane was used in the following study.\n(ii) Water-TEOS mole ratio. The mole ratio of water to TEOS has a significant effect on the rate of the phase change from sol to gel transition and the gelation time32. Formulations with different mole ratios (4.0, 6.0 and 8.0) were prepared by fixing the amount of TEOS at 0.0259\u00a0mol (500 \u00b5L) and varying the amounts of water (2, 3 and 4\u00a0mL). The organic solvent was cyclohexane (3\u00a0mL) and ultrasonication was employed. Optical images for the three mixtures of the mole ratios are shown in (Fig.\u00a02Bii). Uniform distribution of small immiscible droplets are observed. The gelation times are 5, 5 and 1\u00a0min, respectively. The water-TEOS mole ratio of 6.0 was selected for the next study as it provided time (5\u00a0min) for pumping into the capillary before the gel formation is complete.\n(iii) CTAB content. The amount of CTAB (a stabilizing agent) affects the pore size and also the rate of gel formation34. The amount of CTAB was varied from 0 to 200\u00a0mg in steps of 50\u00a0mg. Sonication was employed in the mixing step. The optical images in Fig.\u00a02B(iii) show that without CTAB the droplets are non-uniform in size, with large droplets formed. With increased amount of CTAB there is more uniform distribution of droplets, with the droplet size decreasing with increasing amount of CTAB (see Fig.\u00a02Biii). Moreover, there was a steady decrease in the gelation time from 30 to 1\u00a0min. A 100\u00a0mg amount of CTAB, with gelation time of 5\u00a0min, was selected for the following study.\n(iv) Urea content. Urea is a porogenic agent, affecting both the pore size and gelation time33. The amount of urea was varied from 20 to100 mg in increment of 20\u00a0mg. The optical images of the gel mixtures in Fig.\u00a02B(iv) show little changes in the size and distribution of the droplets with the amount of urea. Gelation time was less than 5\u00a0min for urea content greater than 80\u00a0mg. Therefor, 60\u00a0mg urea was selected for the optimal coating formulation.\n(v) Mixing procedure. The technique used for mixing the formulation has an effect on the dispersion of the microdroplets in the sol\u2013gel mixture. Two mixing devices were tested: a vortex mixer and an ultrasonic probe. These have been previously used to produce porous materials from sol\u2013gel15,16. Three solvents were employed in this study, viz. cyclohexane, hexane and 1-octanol (see \u201cOptical microscopy evaluation of sol-gel mixture\u201d(i) section). The other components of the mixture are described in \u201cOptical microscopy evaluation of sol-gel mixture\u201d section (and in footnote \u201ce\u201d of Table\u00a0S1). The mixing time was 30\u00a0s for all experiments. It was found that mixing with the ultrasonic probe produced smaller uniform droplets compared with vortex mixing (see Fig.\u00a02B(v)). Thus, the ultrasonic probe was chosen as the device for sol\u2013gel mixing.\nFinal formulation and mixing method. From the results in \u201cOptical microscopy evaluation of sol-gel mixture\u201d section, the final selected formulation and procedure are given in \u00a0\u201cFormation of silica layer coating on capillary wall by hydrothermal sol-gel process\u201d section. This facile sol\u2013gel process employs only one step synthesis for\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:7460 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11078-y\nforming a layer coating on the inner wall surface of the silica capillary. It requires fewer steps for preparation of the coating than by the layer-by-layer procedure10.\nCharacterization of the coating material. The sol\u2013gel coating material was chemically characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The surface morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle (CA) measurements. The details of the instruments and preparation of the coating material are described in \u201cCharacterizations of sol-gel coating material\u201d section.\nChemistry of coating layer material. FT-IR: IR absorbance bands of the coating material are observed at 786, 963 and 1052\u00a0 cm-1, which are characteristics of the Si\u2012O, Si\u2012OH and Si\u2012O\u2012Si bonds, respectively (see Fig.\u00a03A). In addition, peaks for urea at 1592\u00a0 cm-1 (\u2012NH2) and CTAB at 1467, 2854 and 2923\u00a0 cm-1 (C\u2012H bending and C\u2012H stretching) are also observed (see Supplementary Information C for FT-IR spectra of pure CTAB and urea).\nXRD: Figure\u00a03B(a) shows a broad low intensity XRD peak at diffraction angle 2\u03b8 of 22.0\u00b0. This is the reflection of pure amorphous silica37. There are also sharp XRD peaks at angle 2\u03b8 of 10.0, 13.6, 17.0, 20.4, 21.0, 23.8, 27.4 and 38.0\u00b0, respectively. These peaks are at the same positions as for powdered CTAB (see Fig.\u00a03B(b). Thus, the XRD spectra of the coating material, together with the FT-IR data, show that CTAB is functionalized in the amorphous silica. Cationic CTAB surfactant has been reported to be adsorbed on the surface of silica nano particles synthesized by sol\u2013gel process but the adsorption step was carried using the dispersed synthesized silica particles38\u201340. In this work CTAB is one of the components of the sol\u2013gel formulation (see \u201cOptical microscopy evaluation of sol-gel mixture\u201d(iii) section) and thus it is not possible to state whether the CTAB is also on the surface. However, the results of the contact angle values (\u201cSurface morphology\u201d section) and EOF mobilities\nFigure\u00a03. (A) FT-IR spectra of silica coated material (functionalized CTAB). The spectrum of the coating material is from a porous material prepared using the hydrothermal sol\u2013gel procedure with the selected sol\u2013gel formulation. (B) XRD patterns of (a) silica coating material (functionalized CTAB) and (b) CTAB powder. (C) In-situ SEM images of inner surface morphology of capillaries: (a) silica nanolayer coated capillary and (b) noncoated capillary. The thickness of the layer is observed from the horizontal cut (i) and the morphology of the surface observed from the bevel cut (ii). (D) Contact angle measurements of (a) silica coated surface (b) noncoated surface (glass slide used as substrate), showing the contact angles as measured by ImageJ software.\n8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:7460 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11078-y\n(\u201cProperties of silica nanolayer coated capillary\u201d section, non-coated and coated capillaries) confirm that the hydrophilicity of the surface of the silica coating has been modified as compared with the non-coated surface.\nSurface morphology. Figure\u00a03C(a)(i) shows SEM images of the cross-section cut of a capillary. A thin silica layer is observed deposited on the capillary inner wall with a thickness of ca. 100\u00a0nm. This is not present at the surface of non-treated capillary (see images in Fig.\u00a03C(b)(i)). With the bevel cut, the SEM images in Fig.\u00a03C(a)(ii) shows cobbled texture of the coating surface when using high resolution of 95,000 \u00d7 magnification. The mean diameter of the dome-like protuberances is 23 \u00b1 3\u00a0nm (n = 25), measured using ImageJ software. The coating surface also has roughness microstructure with material deposited uniformly (see SEM images in Fig.\u00a03C (a)). The coating, with its roughness morphology and chemical compositions, affects the surface wettability41. As discussed previously, the material, functionalized with CTAB (see Fig.\u00a03D(a)) increases the hydrophilicity of the coating material on surface which has a contact angle (CA) of 45 \u00b1 3\u00b0 (n = 6) (see Fig.\u00a03D(a)), compared to the CA of the non-coated surface of 54 \u00b1 2\u00b0 (n = 6), respectively (see Fig.\u00a03D(b)).\nEfficiency and resolution of amines separation by using coated- and non-coated capillaries. Separation efficiency expressed as plate number per effective capillary length (m-1) of silica nanolayer coated capillary for separation of eight amine compounds were calculated using the equation N = 5.54 \u00d7 (tm / W1/2)2 \u00d7 (1/Leff), where tm is the migration time (s), Leff is the effective length of the capillary and W1/2 is the peak width at half maximum height. Figure\u00a04A shows bar graphs of the plate number N between coated and noncoated capillaries for all 8 amines. Figure\u00a04B shows the electropherograms using (a) non-coated and (b) coated capillaries, respectively (see \u201cCapillary electrophoresis with UV detection\u201d section for the CEC conditions). The coated capillaries have plate numbers N \u2265 3.0 \u00d7 104\u00a0 m-1 and resolutions Rs of all consecutive pairs of peaks of 2.69\u201313.94 (see Fig.\u00a0 4B(b)), whereas the non-coated capillary has N \u2265 1.3 \u00d7 104\u00a0 m-1 with Rs of 1.49\u20139.23 (see Fig.\u00a04B(a)). The increment of 1.3 to 2.3-fold of N gives narrower peaks, increased peak heights and 1.5 to 1.8-fold increase in Rs. Thus, the coated capillary will have greater separation performance when applied to analysis of real samples (see Fig.\u00a05 for example).\nProperties of silica nanolayer coated capillary. Reproducibility of coating layer for capillary and its uniform coating: Reproducibility of the layer coating process was evaluated using EOF mobility measurements. Three coated capillaries were selected from different batches of coating procedures. The EOF mobility was measured by using phosphate buffer (20.0\u00a0mM, pH 2.5) and field strength of 400\u00a0V\u00a0 cm-1 (details of the EOF measurement is given in Supplementary Information D). To determine the uniformity of the coating along the length of the capillary, one coated capillary 60\u00a0cm long was divided into 3 segments and a 10.0\u00a0cm section from each segment used for EOF measurements. The mobility and SD (n = 5) of the three 10-cm sections are (0.62 \u00b1 0.02), (0.61 \u00b1 0.02) and (0.63 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u20134 cm2\u00a0 V-1\u00a0 s-1, respectively (see Table\u00a03). The mean of the EOF of the three segments (left, middle and right) is (0.62 \u00b1 0.01) \u00d7 10\u20134 cm2\u00a0 V-1\u00a0 s-1. The values of the mobilities of the three sections lie within the range of mean \u00b1 3SD, indicating that the coating is uniform throughout the length of the 60\u00a0cm capillary. Similarly, the mobility and SD (n = 5) of three selected individual coated capillaries are (0.60 \u00b1 0.01), (0.59 \u00b1 0.01) and (0.56 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u20134 cm2\u00a0 V-1\u00a0 s-1, respectively (see Table\u00a03).\nThe mean EOF mobility from the three capillaries is (0.58 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u20134 cm2\u00a0 V-1\u00a0 s-1. Thus, the values of the mobilities are within \u00b1 3SD of this mean value, confirming no statistical differences between the EOF mobility of the capillaries. The mobility of a 60\u00a0cm non-coated capillary is 1.26 \u00b1 0.01 cm2\u00a0 V-1\u00a0 s-1 (see Table\u00a03).\nPrecision of migration time: Precision of the relative migration time (RMT) of 50\u00a0\u03bcg L-1 standard tyramine, with 100\u00a0\u03bcg L-1 benzhydrylamine as internal standard, was determined (see \u201cCapillary electrophoresis with UV detection\u201d section) using three 60.0\u00a0cm coated capillaries. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of RMTs from 10 repeated injections are 0.86 \u00b1 0.01, 0.86 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.86 \u00b1 0.01 for the three capillaries, respectively. Paired t-tests for all pairs of capillaries show no statistical difference between each pair: tstat = 0.39, for capillary#1 and capillary#2; tstat = 0.58, for capillary#1 and capillary#3; tstat = 1.14, for capillary#2 and capillary#3; tcrital = 1.72, for \u03b1 = 0.05.\nStability of coated capillary: To investigate the stability of the coating, a solution of 200\u00a0\u03bcg L-1 standard tyramine with 100\u00a0\u03bcg L-1 benzhydrylamine (IS) was injected consecutively 35 times over a period of ca. 10\u00a0h. This was repeated on two further days. The %RSD of the mean of the relative migration times of a set of 35 consecutive injections per day was 1.3%, with the absolute migration times decreasing by ca. 16% from the first to the 105th injection. Thus, the capillary can be used for at least 105 separations.\nDetection of tyramine in food products using silica nanolayer coated capillary. Analytical characteristics: calibration, limit of detection and precision. The linear calibration range of tyramine was 5.00\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcg L-1, with calibration equation of peak area ratio with concentration of y = (0.0183 \u00b1 0.0003)x + (0.11 \u00b1 0.03), and coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.9985. The instrumental LOD calculated from 3 \u00d7 (SD of intercept)/(slope of calibration line) was 4.9\u00a0\u03bcg L-142.\nIntra-day and inter-day precisions of quantitation of tyramine using the coated capillary was determined from triplicate injections of standard tyramine solutions of 20, 200 and 400\u00a0\u03bcg L-1, respectively, on three different days using the same capillary and operating conditions. The intra-day and the inter-day precisions are 0.03\u20130.41%RSD and 0.75\u20131.22%RSD, respectively. The relative migration times from three replicate injections of five samples are less than 1.8%RSD (see Table\u00a04).\nDetection of tyramine in food products, recovery study and method comparison. Four different fermented products were analyzed, viz. beer, wine, balsamic vinegar and cheese (see \u201cFood and drink products\u201d section). All\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:7460 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11078-y\nliquid samples were diluted with ultrapure water using aliquots of 1.0\u201330.0 \u00b5L (Repeater\u00ae E3 pipette, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) of sample with a final volume of 600.0 \u00b5L. The cheese sample was extracted using the procedure described in Supplementary Information E.\nThe samples are two brands of beer (B1, B2), wine (W1), balsamic vinegar (V1) and hard cheese (C1). Various dilution factors were used as given in the footnote of Table\u00a04. Figure\u00a05 shows examples of electropherograms of sample V1 after 20-fold dilution using the non-coated and silica nanolayer coated capillaries. The electropherograms are the diluted balsamic vinegar sample V1 and the same sample spiked with standard tyramine at 50\u00a0\u03bcg L-1 (both with 100\u00a0\u03bcg L-1 IS). It can be clearly seen that the tyramine peak is not resolved from matrix peaks using non-coated capillary (see Fig.\u00a05A), while the coated capillary is able to resolve the tyramine peak from the matrix peaks (see Fig.\u00a05B). As observed in Fig.\u00a05A there is only a small change in the peak in the region of the migration time of tyramine after spiking. (see peak inside box with the solid line compared with peak inside the box with the dotted line). In contrast, the identity of the tyramine peak in the electropherogram of Fig.\u00a05B is confirmed by the increase in peak height after spiking (see peak in box with solid line compared with peak inside box with dotted line). Table\u00a04 lists the measured tyramine concentrations of the diluted samples, the recoveries of spiked tyramine standard, the relative migration times and the calculated tyramine contents in the samples. The percent recovery of the spiked diluted sample was calculated from % recovery = [[(S1 \u2212 S2)/S0] \u00d7 100], where S0 is the peak\nFigure\u00a04. (A) Comparisons of plate number per meter for separation of eight amine compounds: histamine (His), benzylamine (Ben), phenylethylamine (Phe), tyramine (Tyr), benzhydrylamine (IS, internal standard), dopamine (Dop), propranolol (Pro) and atenolol (Ate).

The performance of the present work employing coated silica nanolayer capillary shows wider dynamic range and a lower LOD value for comparisons with some works. Different sample pre-treatments, such as liquidor solid-extraction and dilution, were required for preparation of the samples. This work has faster separation than the other works, high separation efficiency and precision, and reasonable percent recovery. Thus, it is suitable for detection of low levels of tyramine, especially of food for patients taking antidepressant drugs."

            "text": "An optimized formulation for a sol\u2013gel mixture that provides reproducible and uniform nanolayer silica coating on the wall of a capillary by a hydrothermal process was successfully developed. Recorded images of the sol formation from an optical microscope was employed to select the optimal formulation based on the observed size distribution of the immiscible droplets, together with the gelling time of the mixture. The selected formulation and mixing procedure produced coating of ca. 100\u00a0nm thickness layer on the inner wall of capillaries. The coating was characterized by in-situ SEM, contact angle, FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The SEM images revealed cobbled texture of the coated surface. The FT-IR spectra and X-ray powder diffraction pattern indicated that CTAB was incorporated in the layer material. The contact angle data showed that CTAB on the coating increased the surface hydrophilicity.\nEOF measurements were carried out to evaluate the reproducibility and stability of the coated capillaries. Comparison of capillary performance for separation of amines between nanolayer coated and conventional noncoated capillaries are presented with regards to efficiency, resolution, as well as EOF mobilities. The nanolayer coated capillary provides higher efficiency and consequently higher peak heights for the separation of eight standard amines, with plate number N of \u2265 3.0 \u00d7 104\u00a0 m-1 and higher peak resolution, Rs \u2265 2.69 for all adjacent pairs of peaks. Using the coated capillary, precision of the relative migration time (RMT) for tyramine (with benzhydrylamine as IS) is < 1.3%RSD for 35 injections. Inter-day precision over 3\u00a0days was < 1.2%RSD. The nanolayer coated capillary was applied to the analysis of tyramine in food and drinks and the comparison of our method with other works is listed (Table\u00a02). The method provides lower LOD than previous works, wide dynamic range and high precision (%RSD of RMT < 2%) and high separation efficiency for tyramine. Accuracy based on percent recoveries of spiked diluted samples were in the range of 95 \u00b1 3\u2013106 \u00b1 7%.\nReceived: 16 July 2021; Accepted: 18 April 2022"
