            "text": "HBV has been proved to be the most important virological factor for the development of advanced liver disease as LC and HCC. The replication capabilities of the virus and the accumulation of potent mutations in the HBV genome, are common events for HCC development, and thus considered a life-threatening pathogen leading to significant rates of mortality worldwide [1, 2]. According to WHO, 257 million people are living with HBV infection with an estimated number of 887,000 deaths in 2015 attributed to HBV complications [3].\nThe infectious virion has an internal capsid (core particle) that protects the partially dou-\nble-stranded DNA genome. HBV genome consists of four overlapping reading frames (ORFs) corresponding to four major genes\u2014polymerase (P), surface (S), core (C), and regulatory (X). Hepatitis B X (HBx) is the smallest of HBV genes, encoding for 154 amino acids that constitute 17.5 kilodalton protein. HBx is involved in transcription regulation and interacts with a variety of cellular pathways responsible for oncogenesis [4]. The HBV genome contains two transcriptional enhancer (Enh) regions i.e. Enh-I and Enh-II, which are important for viral replication. The Enh-II, located in nt 1636\u20131741, overlaps the HBx coding region and stimulates the transcriptional activity of the surface, core, and HBx gene promoters which shows high hepatocyte-specific activity [5]. Enh-II is further composed of two regions i.e. box-\u03b1 (nt 1644\u20131666) and box-\u03b2 (nt 1702\u20131713) [6]. Enh-II region of the HBx plays a key role in controlling the transcription of all genes in a hepatocyte-specific manner. Moreover, Enh-II plays an important role in the viral life cycle by regulating the formation of the 3.5 kb pre-genomic RNA which is then translated to produce the viral core and polymerase proteins and HBeAg [7].\nEnh-II stimulates the transcription of surface protein-I (SP1), surface protein-II, and X pro-\ntein in a position and orientation-independent manner [8]. On the other hand, this element regulates the basal core proteins (BCP) region in a position and orientation-dependent manner, functioning as a core upstream regulatory sequence, which overlaps the sequence of EnhII [9]. Hepatocyte-enriched transcription factors, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor1 (HNF1) [10], HNF3 [11, 12], HNF4 [13, 14], CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) [15\u201317], and fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) [18], which are known to be responsible for the hepatocyte-specific Enh-II activity, and regulate its function [19]. Different mutations in the Enh-II region (as T1653 mutations in box-\u03b1) have been identified which are responsible for the development of HCC. Most of the studies primarily focused on certain single point nucleotide mutations, however, it is unclear whether a single or specific combination of these mutations is associated with the development of HCC [20].\nPakistan is highly endemic for HBV with approximately nine million people infected and\nthe infection rate is on a steady rise [21, 22]. Even though in Pakistan data related to HBV and its genotype prevalence are available but studies that cover information of HBV mutations especially in the Enh-II region and its clinical association with the development of HCC are\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261721 January 4, 2022 2 / 16\nscarce. This study is therefore designed to assess the diversity of mutations associated with LC and HCC in Enh-II regions in HBV positive patients of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, Pakistan."

Two different nt insertions in the X gene were CCTCCA (6 bp) and AGGGCA (6 bp) at nt 1647 and nt.1677 were also found. We also found truncation in the Enh-II region from 1726!end in 10.81% cases and 1731!end in 14.84% cases (Table 3)."

Most of the studies in Pakistan have been focussing on HBV\u2019s prevalence, its epidemiology, and genotyping [22]. Studies are scarce on HBV\u2019s mutations and their association with advanced forms of liver disease.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261721.g005\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261721.g006\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261721 January 4, 2022 10 / 16\nPreviously, the association of mutations in Enh-II region with the development of advanced liver disease were not investigated in this area. Various studies around the globe suggested that certain mutations in the HBV genome may be associated with HCC development [26, 27]. It is considered that mutations in HBV genome may responsible for escape from the host immune system and may affect the oncogenic potential inchronic HBV diseases [28]. Sequences in this study revealed nucleotide substitutions, deletions, and insertions within the Enh-II region,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261721.g008\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261721.g007\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261721 January 4, 2022 11 / 16\nwhich are shown associated with certain biological functions of the protein that may lead to cancer.\nDeletion mutation was found in this study at nt 1653 (H94-) in 6.5% of CH, 28.5% of LC, and 50% of HCC patients which showed an increasing trend from CH to HCC. These mutations might be a potential biomarker to predict the prognosis for patients with an advanced form of liver diseases such as LC and HCC. Our findings are consistent with other studies [20, 29] thatreported high frequency of HCC due to substitution mutation at nt 1653 in the Enh-II region of the HBx gene. But in our study at this point, it was a deletion mutation. This region in Enh-II is located in the box \u03b1 which is a strong activation element of the Enh-II/core promoter that can enhance the box \u03b1 binding affinity and Enh-II/core promoter activity [15, 29]. Many trans-regulated nuclear factors bind HBV at the 1653 site, and such mutation can alter the binding affinity of the nuclear factors [30, 31]. Mutation at this site was reported to be a predictive factor for HCC in genotype C [20] and genotype D [32]. A meta-analysis data also resported that C1653T is associated with an increased risk of HCC [33].\nSubstitution mutation S101F was detected in a considerable number of samples (N = 37)\nand found highest in HCC patients (62%) followed by LC patients (57%). It is shown that mutation at this site is responsible for the disturbance of the cell cycle leading to apoptosis caused by the increased expression of p21 in Hep G2 and may lead to the advanced form of\nTable 4.

The level of HBV transcription varies with the extent of transcription factor binding to HBV DNA, which can be altered by mutations in the HBV genome. When a new mutation allows a transcription factor to bind a new region in HBV DNA, HBV replication is stimulated resulting in the progression of the disease [34]. The substitution mutation T106N/I associated with HCC [35] was found in 43.75% of HCC and 28.52% ofLC patients of this study. The Enh-II region from nt 1640 to 1663 containing box-\u03b1 and C/EBP site is an independent sequence and sufficient for the enhancer activity. In an experimental study, mutation in this sequence results in a great decrease in luciferase gene expression under the control of the minimal promoter [10]. In the present study eight different (P90F, K91W/R, V92A/P, L93P, H94-, K95S, R96C, T97A) substitutions and deletion mutations were found in this region that may affect the viral replication and cell cycle and might play a role in the development of the advanced form of liver disease.\nHepatocyte enriched transcription factors have various binding motif and regulate the\nactivities of Enh-II region [10\u201317]. Of these transcriptions factors, HNFs regulate cccDNA transcription by directly interacting with HBx, which enhances the DNA-binding activity of HNFs. HNF1 up-regulates Enh-II activity by interacting with either the hB1F or B element in Enh-II. In the absence of HNF1\u03b1, the concentration of HBV pgRNA is decreased, resulting in decreased genome replication [31]. In this study, two mutations were found in the HNF1 Site (K118E/I and D119N) which were more prevalent in HCC (37%) patients as compared to LC (14.2%) and CH (12%). It is reported that due to mutations new binding sequences ofHNF1 may emerge that activate increased viral replication. Moreover, double combinational mutation (K118E/I, D119N) within regulatory elements of Enh-II has been shown to affect the replication of HBcAg in situ and can manifest liver disease [36, 37]. Additionally, this double mutation was studied in T cellular cell epitope (amino acid 115\u2013123) and T helper cell epitopes (amino acid 111\u2013135) which plays a role in the evasion of the HBV from host immune clearance [38]. In the current study, 4 bp deletion was found in the SP1 binding site of the C-terminal region (nt 1717\u20131721). Deletion in this region causes carcinogenesis which might be due to the deletion of the Sp1 binding site that controls the expression of the X gene negatively. The deletion of the Sp1 binding site is increased with the expression of the X gene [39].\nLikewise, three mutations T97A, L100G, and S101F were reported in the HNF4 site which\nwere more prevalent in HCC groups (12.5%, 50%, and 62% respectively) as compared to other two groups. Such deletion may increase HNF4 expression and HNF3 down-regulation in CH patients [35].\nOverall, twelve non-reported mutations were also identified (P90F, V92W/R, R96C, T97A,\nS104I/W, E109A/Y, D107R, A110S/K, Y111E, F112L, and D114G). Mutations in the Enh-II region of the amino-terminal domain of core protein may be responsible for the nucleocapsid assembly and stability [40]. The incidence and impact of these mutations are unclear; however, the presence of these mutations in high frequency in HCC and LC patients is alarming as these mutations might be responsible for the advanced form of liver disease."

The occurrence of multiple mutations represents a strategy by which HBV can escape immune surveillance and thus contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. These mutations cause structural changes and conformation alteration of X protein and hence alter the regulatory and transactivation functions. Some unreported mutations were also detected in our study which may provide new insights into the mechanism by which multi-site\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261721 January 4, 2022 13 / 16\nmutations in the Enh-II region may contribute to the development of advanced liver disease. However, further experiments need to be conducted to confirm the inference. In short, our study confirms certain mutations and their association with an advanced form of liver disease in Pakistani patients."
