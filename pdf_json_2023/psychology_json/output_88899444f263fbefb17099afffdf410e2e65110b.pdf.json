            "text": "Histone acetylation regulates most DNA transactions and is dynamically controlled by highly 22\nconserved enzymes. The only essential histone acetyltransferase (HAT) in yeast, Esa1, is part 23\nof the 1MDa NuA4 complex, which plays pivotal roles in both transcription and DNA damage 24\nrepair. NuA4 has the unique capacity to acetylate histone targets located several nucleosomes 25\naway from its recruitment site. Neither the molecular mechanism of this activity nor its 26\nphysiological importance are known. Furthermore, a high-resolution model for holo-NuA4 is 27\nlacking. Here we report the structure of the yeast NuA4 complex with its core resolved at 3.4 28\n\u00c5 resolution. Three subunits, Epl1, Eaf1, and Swc4, intertwine to form a stable platform that 29\ncoordinates all other modules. The HAT module is firmly anchored into the core while 30\nretaining the ability to stretch out over a long distance. We provide structural, biochemical 31\nand genetic evidence to demonstrate that an unfolded region of the Epl1 subunit is critical for 32\nthis long-range activity, which we show to be essential for viability and maintenance of 33\nacetylated H4 levels in yeast. Our work lays the foundations for a mechanistic understanding 34\nof NuA4 regulatory role and elucidates how its essential long-range activity is attained. 35\n36\nMain 37 38 The major histone H4 acetylase NuA4 comprises at least 12 subunits organized into four 39 modules1,2 and plays crucial roles in transcription regulation and DNA repair3,4. Esa1 forms a 40 tetrameric histone acetyl transferase (HAT) module with the Eaf6, Epl1 and Yng2 subunits1,2,5, 41 whose structure was resolved by X-ray crystallography6. Esa1 promotes both targeted and 42\nuntargeted H4 acetylation (Clarke, 1999; Reid, 2000). Targeted acetylation involves the NuA4 43\ncomplex and occurs on specific promoters. Local recruitment of NuA4 can mediate long-range 44 H4 acetylation patterns extending over several nucleosomes7,8. In S. cerevisiae, the HAT 45\nmodule exists also in isolation, separated from the other NuA4 subunits, to form the Piccolo 46 complex. Piccolo, but not NuA4, promotes global, untargeted H4 acetylation9,10. The TINTIN 47\nmodule, composed of Eaf5, Eaf7, and Eaf3, a reader of methylated histone H3, forms a sub-48 complex regulating transcription elongation11,12. The 430 kDa Tra1 protein interacts with 49\nsequence-specific transcription activators and forms a module involved in NuA4 recruitment 50 to gene promoters1,13,14. Tra1 is a member of the Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase-related Kinase 51 (PIKK) family and is shared with the SAGA complex15. Although NuA4 and SAGA use the same 52\nactivator-docking module, genome wide approaches revealed that they regulate both 53\noverlapping and distinct sets of genes, suggesting that activators can distinguish between 54 SAGA and NuA416-18. It is not known how the assembly and context of Tra1 within the two 55\ncomplexes affects activator binding. The NuA4 subunits Swc4, Yaf9 \u2013 a reader of acetylated 56\nhistones, Arp4, and Act1 form a module also found in the SWR1 chromatin remodeling 57 complex19-21. Arp4 and Act1 are also part of the INO80 ATP-dependent chromatin. The four 58\nmodules are thought to be connected by a single scaffolding component, Eaf1, the only NuA4 59\nsubunit that is not shared with another chromatin modification/remodeling complex or with 60 Piccolo10,11,22. 61\nStructure of isolated subunits or modules have been reported6 but structural information 62 regarding holo-NuA4 is limited to intermediate resolution EM reconstructions11,23. These 63\nrevealed an L-shape assembly where the Actin and Tra1 modules each occupy a different 64\ndomain while the HAT and TINTIN modules are poorly resolved. Moreover, the scaffold that 65\norchestrates the binding and activity of the other modules within NuA4 could not be revealed. 66\nImportantly, and in contrast to the major H3 acetyltransferase SAGA, NuA4 is able to act over 67 thousand base-pairs (kbp) away from its recruitment site7,8. Hence fundamental questions 68\nremain unanswered, including how the HAT activity is embedded within the complex and how 69\nit targets nucleosomes located at a distance. More generally, other chromatin modifying 70\ncomplexes are suspected to possess long-range activity, however the mechanism and 71 functional relevance of such an activity remain elusive24,25. 72\nHere we report the structure of NuA4 at 3.4 \u00c5 resolution. Clear amino acid densities allowed 73\nus to fully trace the core of the complex. We reveal how a scaffold composed of extended and 74\ninterwoven Eaf1, Epl1 and Swc4 subunits tightly binds Tra1, as well as the actin module, 75\ncoordinates several flexible histone-tail readers, and incorporates the HAT module. Most 76\nIntertwined extended Epl1, Swr4 and Eaf1 subunits form a stable 107\nscaffold 108 109 An intricate path of the Eaf1 subunit could be traced unambiguously in our map as it traverses 110\nthe neck of NuA4 multiple times (Fig. 1d). With the exception of the SANT domain, Eaf1 is 111\nmostly organized into loops, stretches of unfolded domains and isolated helices. Epl1 and Swc4 112\nare both elongated and extended proteins that interact with Eaf1 extensively along the neck, 113\nfrom Tra1 to the actin module, and support the highly intricate topology of Eaf1. Following a 114 disordered N-terminal stretch that anchors the TINTIN module23, Eaf1 makes critical contacts 115\nwith Tra1, then continues towards the neck base where it forms a beta-sheet stabilized by 116\nthree strands contributed by Epl1. Eaf1 continues by providing two long helices to the bundle 117\nforming the bulk of the neck base and the loop between the two helices binds again to Tra1. 118\nEaf1 then folds into the helicase-SANT-associated (HSA) helix, which firmly binds the Actin 119\nmodule and is followed by a 12-residue long loop that partially encircles Act1 (Fig. 1e). The 120\nengagement of the Actin module is further bolstered by the Swc4 SANT-like domain as well as 121\ntwo strands and a helix from Epl1 that associate with the HSA helix and Arp4, respectively. Eaf1 122\ntraverses the neck domain a fourth time completing the Eaf1/Epl1 beta sheet with an 123\nadditional beta-strand. The C-terminal part of Eaf1 connects to three distinct sites on Tra1 via 124\nits SANT domain, as well as two additional helices, virtually encircling the FAT domain of Tra1 125\n(Fig. 1d). These two helices form an important hub of inter-module contacts. In addition to 126\nTra1, they bind a helix of Swc4 that immediately precedes the domain anchoring Yaf9 and, 127\nmost importantly, they also connect to the first helix of Epl1 in the core (helix H1). This Epl1 128\nhelix is preceded by a long, unfolded linker and the N-terminal half of Epl1 that is part of the 129\nHAT module. Hence, a major site of neck binding to the Tra1 module also associates with the 130\ndomains of Swc4 and Epl1 that coordinate Yaf9 and the HAT module, respectively. The most 131\nprominent structured part of the neck is a helix bundle that forms strong contacts with Tra1 132\nand where all three scaffolding subunits intertwine. Epl1 contributes two helices that envelope 133\ntwo Eaf1 helices, and Swc4 completes the bundle with a long, kinked helix. Multiple strong 134\ninteractions, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic bonds stabilize this helix bundle which 135\nprovides stability and stiffness to the scaffolding neck. Altogether, Eaf1 contacts six proteins 136 from all modules of NuA4 in accordance with its proposed scaffolding role22. However, Eaf1 is 137\nhighly extended, and contains a large proportion of unfolded loops that would not be sufficient 138\nto construct a stable interaction platform. Our results highlight the essential contributions of 139\nEpl1 and Swc4 to shaping the architecture of NuA4, since only an extensive interaction 140\nnetwork between these components and Eaf1 provides a robust platform to stably anchor the 141\nfunctional modules. 142\nThe unique environment of the actin module 143 144 An actin hetero-dimer is found in several chromatin re-modelers, in which it binds a long HSA 145\nhelix and forms a mobile module poorly resolved in EM maps. Conversely, in the head part of 146 NuA4, the Eaf1HSA-Act1-Arp4 module is strongly coupled to the neck and is well resolved. This 147\nstability stems from multiple additional interactions between this module and the SANT-like 148\ndomain of Swc4, an Epl1 loop that intercalates between the two actin proteins, as well as a 149\nloop from Eaf1 (Extended Data Fig. 6). This complementary interaction network completely 150 envelopes and shields the Eaf1HSA helix, which is unlikely to play a role similar to its analogue 151 in the INO80 complex, where it serves as a long-range sensor for extra-nucleosomal DNA28. 152 The nearly neutral charge of the Eaf1HSA helix also supports this conclusion. Hence the role of 153\nthe actin module in NuA4 remains enigmatic but, at least in part, it seems that the actin 154\nmodule and Tra1 serve an important structural role by stabilizing and constraining the three 155\nscaffolding subunits at each extremity of the neck. 156\n157\nEnsuring selective use of Tra1 158\nThe large ~400 KDa Tra1 subunit is the only component shared between NuA4 and the SAGA 159\nH3 acetyltranferase, thus raising questions about the mechanism governing incorporation of 160\nspecific subunits into either complex, while preventing formation of chimeric assemblies 161 between SAGA and NuA427. The central module of SAGA associates with Tra1 through three 162 main protein bridges24,29. We find that Eaf1 interactions with Tra1 engage all sites occupied 163\nby these bridges (Fig. 2a). In one case, the bridge formed by Eaf1 and Tra1 structurally mimics 164\nthe analogous binding surface in SAGA, as an Eaf1 loop sends an aromatic residue (F523) 165\nprotruding into the Tra1 ring as observed for Spt3 within SAGA. Thus, binding of Eaf1 166\nis sufficient for nucleating Tra1 into NuA4 (Fig. 2a). 167\nTra1 serves as the major docking platform for activators that recruit SAGA and NuA4 168 to specific promoters13. However, many genes are predominantly regulated by either 169 NuA4 or SAGA in yeast17,27 and the affinity between each complex and certain 170 activators differ in vitro 13. Our structure offers some clues to understand these 171\nfunctional differences. NuA4 forms more extensive interactions with Tra1 involving 172\nnot only Eaf1, that practically envelops the Tra1 FAT domain, but also Swc4 and Epl1 173\ncontributions, mainly from the helix bundle at the neck base (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the 174\nNuA4 neck is tilted by 90\u00b0 as compared to SAGA, resulting in distinct Tra1 surfaces 175\naccessible to activators. Additionally, bridge forming subunits might play auxiliary 176 roles in activator binding30 and further differentiate the two complexes. Lastly, we 177\nobserve differences between the two complexes in the flexibility of some internal 178\ndomains of Tra1 (Fig. 2c). Collectively, these effects may contribute to form specific 179\nactivator binding interfaces within each complex. 180\nUncovering the HAT module 181\nWe next sought to resolve how the HAT module is connected to the core. It was previously 182 shown that the N-terminal half of Epl1 is part of the HAT module whereas the C-terminal half, 183 which we resolved in the core, is crucial for its inclusion into NuA49. Focussed classification 184 within a sphere expanding from the first Epl1 residue detected in our map revealed a fuzzy 185 density that was only apparent at low density threshold, suggesting that the HAT module is 186 flexibly attached to NuA4. We posited that mobility is likely to be conferred by a stretch of 187 amino acids predicted to be disordered (residues 359-418). This linker is conserved between 188 yeasts and vertebrates (Extended Data Fig. 7) and connects the last Epl1 residue resolved in 189 the crystal structure of the HAT module (K358) with the first residue discernible in our cryo-190 EM map (M419). This residue is closely followed by the first Epl1 helix in the core (Helix H1, 191 S431). We introduced a TEV protease cleavage site into the linker to investigate its role in 192 connecting the HAT module to the core. Using a SBP affinity-tag on Eaf1, holo-NuA4 was 193\nbound to streptavidin beads and then incubated with TEV protease. We observed that all HAT 194 subunits were efficiently and specifically released from holo-NuA4 upon cleavage, 195 demonstrating that the HAT module is tethered to the core mainly by the long unstructured 196 Epl1 linker (Extended Data Fig. 8). This observation agrees with cross-linking coupled to mass 197 spectrometry analyses, which identified only a few interactions between the HAT module and 198 the core23. 199\nTo better visualize the HAT module connected to NuA4, deletion mutants were designed to 200 gradually shorten the linker (Epl1-SL1, Epl1-SL3, Epl1-SL5) and bring the HAT module closer to 201 the core (Fig. 3a). The fuzzy density indeed grew bigger and drew nearer to the core as the 202 loop got shorter. The density corresponding to deleted residues was no longer observed in 203 the core, further supporting our Epl1 density assignment and residue register (Fig. 3b). 204 Furthermore, neural network-based heterogeneity analysis (cryoDRGN) of the mutants 205 showed clearly that a density with the size of the HAT module appears close to the core in 206 most 3-D classes, whereas such adjacent density was rarely observed in the WT case (Fig. 3c). 207 Although residual flexibility precluded the resolution of molecular details, the appended 208 domain is connected to the Epl1 H1 helix in representative classes (Fig. 3d). To gain insights 209 into its molecular shape, particles were re-centred on the attached density and the signal of 210 core NuA4 was subtracted. Ab initio 3D reconstruction of the residual domain resulted in a 211 cryo-EM map at 12 \u00c5 resolution highly similar in shape to the crystal structure of the HAT 212 module6 (Fig. 3e). An extra protein density is detected in the cryo-EM map and may 213 correspond to parts not included in the crystal structure. Altogether these experiments 214 demonstrate that the HAT module is tethered to the Epl1 H1 helix within the core of NuA4 via 215 a long unstructured Epl1 linker that determines its orientation and maximal distance from the 216 core (Fig. 3f) 217\nTo test whether Esa1 enzymatic activity is regulated by the Epl1 linker, mutant NuA4 218 complexes containing short linkers were affinity-purified and their ability to acetylate 219 nucleosome core particles was assayed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3g). These results show 220 that the Epl1 short linker mutants are enzymatically as active as WT NuA4 and are able to 221 modify a diffusing mono-nucleosomal substrate in vitro. Hence, reducing the Epl1 linker length 222 does not affect the intrinsic enzymatic activity of Esa1. 223\nA long linker is essential for viability in S. pombe 224\nWe next examined the function of the unstructured Epl1 linker in vivo. For this, we used a 225 suppressing mutation followed by tetrad analysis of heterozygous diploid mutants. We found 226 that the Epl1-SL3 and -SL5 mutants cause neither overt growth phenotypes nor defects in bulk 227 histone H4 acetylation levels (Extended Data Fig. 9). epl1-SL5 mutants, which have the longest 228 linker deletion, display mild sensitivity to high temperature, suggesting defects in targeted, 229 activator-driven H4 acetylation and transcriptional induction. However, biochemical and 230 genetic evidence indicate that incorporation of the HAT module into NuA4 is not essential in 231 S. cerevisiae because of the existence of a free version of the HAT module, named Piccolo9,10,31. 232 Indeed, deletion of the scaffolding Eaf1 subunit or the C-terminal half of Epl1 is viable. Our 233 result supports this model and suggest that Piccolo masks the putative effects of Epl1 linker 234\nmutations. In marked contrast, in the fission Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Eaf1 235 homologue Vid21 is essential for viability, despite similar subunit composition27 (Extended 236 Data Fig. 1). We thus reasoned that, rather than Piccolo, holo-NuA4 is critical for proliferation 237 in fission yeast. Accordingly, we observed that deleting the C-terminal end of S. pombe Epl1 238 causes lethality (Fig. 4a-b), whereas an analogous truncation mutation detaches the HAT 239 module from holo-NuA4 and is viable in S. cerevisiae9. Thus, unlike S. cerevisiae, incorporation 240 of the HAT module into NuA4 is essential in S. pombe. 241\nThis finding prompted us to test the importance of the distance between the HAT module and 242 the core-NuA4 in this yeast. To introduce conditional mutations at the endogenous epl1+ 243 locus, we implemented a novel strategy based on a Cre recombinase-dependent \u201cflip-244 excision\u201d switch (FLEx), initially developed in mice32 (Fig. 4c). We obtained three Epl1-FLEx 245 mutants, Epl1-SL1, -SL5, and -DCt (Fig. 4a). Marker and PCR analyses of genomic DNA 246 confirmed that \u03b2-estradiol addition induces a rapid, efficient, and irreversible inversion of the 247 epl1 locus, demonstrating the utility of this approach for conditional genetic manipulation in 248 yeast (Fig. 4d-e). 249\nRemarkably, we observed that \u03b2-estradiol-induced proliferation defects leading to a near-250 complete loss of S. pombe viability in both the epl1-SL1 and -SL5 FLEx mutants (Fig. 4e-f). As 251 expected from our tetrad analyses, we observed a similar phenotype in the epl1-DCt-FLEx 252 strain, validating the FLEx approach. These results demonstrate that the length of the Epl1 253 linker has critical functions in S. pombe, similar to its C-terminal end. Western blot analysis of 254 total protein extracts revealed a modest, but reproducible reduction of bulk H4 acetylation 255 levels in both the epl1-SL1-FLEx and epl1-SL5-FLEx mutants, suggesting that shortening the 256 Epl1 linker affects NuA4 activity in vivo (Fig. 4g). Together with our finding that the Epl1 linker 257 does not regulate the intrinsic enzymatic activity of Esa1 in vitro, these results indicate that 258 the distance between the HAT module and the core NuA4 is important for proliferation and 259 H4 acetylation in vivo. 260\nConclusion 261\nIn vitro experiments showed that NuA4 has the capacity to find its targets over long distances, 262 contrary to SAGA, in which the HAT module is directly coupled to the core via a structured 263 domain. Notably, using an activator to recruit either SAGA or NuA4 to an artificial promoter, 264 distinct histone acetylation patterns were observed8. While SAGA acetylates H3 from 265 nucleosomes immediately adjacent to the activator binding site, NuA4 generates a broader 266 H4 acetylation profile, extending up to 1.5 kbp, which corresponds to 7-8 nucleosomes. 267 In vivo observations further supported the long-range activity of NuA4. First, ChIP-qPCR 268 analyses show that Esa1-dependent H4 acetylation spans across an entire gene encoding a 269 ribosomal protein, including the promoter and coding sequences, although NuA4 is specifically 270 recruited to the activator binding-sites within the promoter7. Second, NuA4 is recruited to the 271 upstream region of the PHO5 gene promoter, through interactions with Pho2, but contributes 272 to chromatin remodeling spanning 4 nucleosomes33. Our work describes the mechanism that 273 endows a chromatin-modifying enzyme with long-range activity and provides evidence for the 274 importance of this property in vivo. Other chromatin modifying enzymes, including the de-275\nubiquitination module of SAGA24,29 and the histone deacetylase Sin3L/Rpd3L co-repressor 276 complex25, have unstructured protein domains linking the enzymatic modules to the core of 277 the complex. We suggest that in these enzymes, a similar mechanism mediates histone 278 modification at a distance from the recruitment site. 279\nAcknowledgements: 280 We are grateful to Simonetta Piatti and Lorraine Pillus for kindly sharing S. cerevisiae strains. 281\nWe thank the mass spectrometry service of the IGBMC for helpful advises and the Nanotumor 282\nConsortium, with financial support from ITMO Cancer of AVIESAN (National Alliance for Life 283\nSciences & Health) within the framework of the Cancer Plan, for helpful discussions.

Protein Sci 27, 14-25, (2018). 421\n422\nMethods: 423\n424\nPurification of NuA4 425\nA strain of the budding yeast Komagataella phaffii (also known as Pichia pastoris) with the 426\n38-amino-acid streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) affinity tag fused to the C-terminus of the 427\nendogenous Eaf1 subunit was produced following standard yeast molecular biology 428\ntechniques. Two liters of yeast cells were grown at 24\u00b0C with glycerol as carbon source and 429\nharvested when OD600 nm reached 16-18. Cells were washed in ice-cold water and then 430\ntreated with 10 mM DTT in 1.1 M Sorbitol. The cell wall was digested by addition of lyticase at 431\n30\u00b0C and spheroplasts were pelleted at 5,500 g for 24 min. All further steps were performed 432\nat 0 to 4\u00b0C. Protease inhibitors were added to all buffers. Spheroplasts were washed twice in 433\n1.4 M Sorbitol and were then disrupted by suspension in a hypotonic buffer (15-18% Ficoll 434\n400, 0.6 mM MgCl2, 20 mM K-phosphate buffer pH 6.6) using a ULTRA-TURRAX disperser. 435\nSucrose (0.1 M) and MgCl2 (5 mM) were then added. Nuclei (and some debris) were pelleted 436\nat 34,000 g for 38 min, re-suspended in a wash buffer (0.6 M Sucrose, 8% PVP, 1 mM MgCl2, 437\n20 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.6) and pelleted again at 34,000 g for 50 min. Nuclei were re-438 suspended in low ionic extraction buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 20% sucrose, 8 mM MgCl2, 5-439\n6 mM DTT) with 30 strokes using a tight pestle in a dounce homogenizer. Very few molecules 440\nof NuA4 are liberated under the low ionic conditions leaving time for protease inhibitors to 441\nbind their targets before NuA4 is extracted. After 20 minutes of incubation, 300 mM NaCl, 442\n0.25 mM CaCl2 and 150 ul of alpha-Amylase solution (MegaZyme) were added. Following 443\nanother 30 minutes of incubation, debris were precipitated at 34,000 g for 40 min. The 444\nsupernatant was collected and 1.4 % PEG 20,000 as well as additional 5 mM MgCl2 were 445\nadded in order to precipitate some remaining organelles and membrane parts by a short 446 centrifugation (33,000 g for 10 min). The PEG 20,000 concentration was then increased to 447\n5.8% and NUA4 precipitated in a second short centrifugation step. The pellet was re-448\nsuspended in a minimal volume and avidin was added to block endogenously biotinylated 449\nproteins. The suspension was incubated with streptavidin beads for 5 h in buffer A (20 mM 450\nHEPES pH 8.0, 250 mM Sodium Chloride, 10% sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT) washed 5 451\ntimes with buffer A supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 and finally eluted with buffer A 452 containing 10 mM biotin. The eluate was concentrated with Millipore Amicon-Ultra (50 kDa 453\ncut-off) and loaded on a sucrose gradient generated by a Gradient Master 108 (BioComp) from a light 454\nsolution (10% sucrose, 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM Potassium acetate, 2 mM TCEP, 5 mM 455\nMgCl2, 0.0045% Dodecyl-maltoside) and a heavy solution (30% sucrose instead of 10%) that 456 contained 0.1% Glutaraldehyde34. Following centrifugation in rotor SW60 (42,000 rpm for 14 457 h) the gradient was fractionated by puncturing the bottom of the tube with a needle. 458 Glutaraldehyde was quenched by addition of 75 mM ammonium acetate. Peak fractions were 459 concentrated (Millipore Amicon-Ultra) and dialyzed against a buffer containing 20mM Hepes 460\npH 8, 150mM Potassium acetate, 5mM Magnesium acetate, 2mM TCEP, 5mM Ammonium 461\nacetate, 0.0025% Dodecyl-maltoside. The quality of the sample and its concentration after 462\ndialysis was estimated by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples. 463\n464\nYeast procedures and growth conditions 465\nStandard culture media and genetic manipulations were used. S. cerevisiae strains were 466 grown in YPD at 30\u02daC to mid-log phase (~1x107 cells/ml). S. pombe strains were grown in 467 either rich (YES) or minimal (EMM) media at 32\u02daC to mid-log phase (~0.5x107 cells/ml). 468 Proliferation assays were performed by inoculating single colonies in liquid media and 469\nmeasuring the optical density at 595 nm at different time points and by spotting ten-fold serial 470\ndilutions of liquid cultures on rich medium and incubated for 3 days at 32\u00b0C. For longer time 471\ncourse, cultures were diluted to keep cells in constant exponential growth. For CreER-loxP-472 mediated recombination, cells were treated with either 1 \u00b5M \u03b2-estradiol (E2758, Sigma) or 473 DMSO alone. 474\n475\nStrain construction 476\nAll S. pombe and S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Supplementary Table S2 and were 477\nconstructed by standard procedures, using either yeast transformation or genetic crosses. 478\nStrains with truncations and C-terminally epitope-tagged proteins were constructed by PCR-479\nbased gene targeting of the respective open reading frame (ORF) with kanMX6, amplified 480\nfrom pFA6a backbone plasmids. Strains with N-terminally epitope-tagged proteins and 481\ninternal deletions were constructed using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. DNA 482\nfragments used for homologous recombination were generated by PCR, Gibson assembly 483\ncloning (kit E2611L, New England Biolabs), or gene synthesis. Transformants were screened 484\nfor correct integration by PCR and, when appropriate, verified by Sanger sequencing or 485\nWestern blotting. For each transformation, 2-4 individual clones were purified and analyzed. 486\nFor tetrad analyses in both S. cerevisiae (Extended Data Fig. 9) and S. pombe (Fig. 4), 487\nmutations were introduced in diploid strains to generate heterozygotes, which were then 488\nsporulated to analyze growth phenotypes. At least 20 distinct meiotic events were analyzed 489\nfor growth and allele segregation by replica plating and PCR. The four progenies from each tetrad 490 are labelled A-D (Fig. 4b). 491\n492\nGeneration of P. pastoris mutant Strains with a shortened Epl1 linker 493\nWe used the NEBuilder enzyme mixture (NEB) to assemble seamlessly together into a 494\nlinearized pUC19 backbone these DNA fragments: 1000 base-pairs upstream in the yeast 495\ngenome to the position of the deletion in the linker; yeast genome sequence from the 496\ndeletion till the end of Epl1; affinity tag sequence with a stop codon followed by the AOX gene 497\ntranscription termination sequence; Zeocin selection marker; 1000 base-pairs in the yeast 498\ngenome downstream to Epl1. PCR was used to amplify the assembled DNA. Pichia pastoris 499\nX33 wild type cells were transformed with 180ug of the PCR product by electroporation. 500\n501\nHistone acetyl transferase activity 502\nThe activity test reactions were carried out in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 50 \u03bcM 503 acetyl-CoA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.0025% Dodecyl-maltoside, 10% (v/v) 504 Glycerol and 1 \u03bcM Nucleosome. The reactions were initiated by adding 10 nM of NuA4, 505 Piccolo or NuA4-SL1/3/5. After an incubation on ice for 10 min the reactions were stopped by 506\nadding SDS loading buffer and heating at 95\u00b0C for 3 min. Proteins were then resolved by 15% 507\nSDS-PAGE that was followed by a western blot with a primary antibody against acetylated-508\nlysine (Cell Signaling Technology Cat. No. 9441S). 509\n510\nConstruction of S. cerevisiae mutants 511\nTo construct seamless deletions of the linker region from endogenous S. cerevisiae Epl1, and 512 avoid possible issues with the genetic manipulation of an essential gene, we took advantage 513 of the ability of sds3\u2206 deletion mutants to suppress the loss of viability observed in NuA4 HAT 514 mutants, including epl1\u2206 31. In this background, we obtained an epl1-SL1 allele, which removes 515 residues K395 to V501, and an epl1-SL5 allele, in which Epl1 lacks residues I401 to H487. The 516 sds3\u2206 epl1-SL1 and sds3\u2206 epl1-SL5 double mutants were then backcrossed to a wild-type (WT) 517 strain to segregate each mutant allele independently. 518\n519\nConstruction of endogenous conditional mutants in Schizosaccharomyces pombe 520\nWe implemented an innovative strategy to introduce conditional point mutations in yeast, 521 which we based on a Cre recombinase-dependent \u201cflip-excision\u201d switch (FLEx) developed in 522 mice32. Briefly, FLEx takes advantage of the \u03b2-estradiol inducibility of a Cre-ER fusion protein, 523 the ability of Cre to either invert or excise a DNA fragment depending on the orientation of 524 the flanking lox recognition sites, and the existence of lox variants that are not cross-525 compatible (Fig. 4c). Specifically, we constructed S. pombe strains in which we can 526 conditionally replace the WT epl1+ allele with a mutant copy of epl1 at its endogenous locus, 527 thereby leaving all 5\u2019 cis-regulatory elements intact. Specifically, we obtained two Epl1-FLEx 528 mutants, epl1-SL1-FLEx and epl1-SL5-FLEx, which have seamless deletions of residues V323-529 to-A343 and K317-to-P357, respectively. We also designed an epl1-DCt-FLEx allele, in which 530 Epl1 is conditionally replaced by the same C-ter truncation mutant analyzed in heterozygous 531 diploids (Y405-to-stop) (Fig. 4a). Marker and PCR analyses of both genomic DNA and cDNA 532 confirmed that \u03b2-estradiol addition induces a rapid, efficient, and irreversible inversion of the 533 epl1 locus, demonstrating the utility of this approach for conditional genetic manipulation in 534 S. pombe (Fig. 4d). 535\n536\nProtein extraction and Western blotting 537\nTen to twenty-fine mL cultures of exponentially growing cells were homogenized by glass 538\nbead-beating in a FastPrep (MP Biomedicals). Proteins extracted using either standard lysis 539\nbuffer (WEB: 40 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 350 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40, and 10% glycerol) or 540\ntrichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. WEB was supplemented with protease inhibitors, 541\nincluding cOmplete EDTA-free cocktails tablets (04693132001, Roche), 1 mM PMSF (P7626, 542 Sigma), 1 \u00b5g/ml bestatin (B8385, Sigma), and 1 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A (P5318, Sigma). Western 543 blotting was performed using the anti-pan-acetyl H4 (rabbit polyclonal, 06-866, Sigma) and 544\nanti-H3 (rabbit polyclonal, ab1791, Abcam) antibodies. Protein concentrations were 545\nmeasured by the Bradford method and used to load equal amounts of proteins across 546\nsamples. Ponceau red was used to normalize for total protein levels across samples. 547\n548\nCryo-EM sample preparation and data acquisition 549\nThree \u00b5l of sample was applied onto a holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R2/2 300 mesh) rendered 550\nhydrophilic by a 90 s treatment in a Fischione 1070 plasma cleaner operating at 30% power 551\nwith a gas mixture of 80% argon: 20% oxygen. The grid was blotted for 1 sec at blot force 8 552 and flash-frozen in liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) at 4\u02daC and 95-100% humidity. 553 Images were acquired on a Cs-corrected Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher) microscope operating 554 at 300 kV in nanoprobe mode using the serialEM software for automated data collection35. 555\nMovie frames were recorded either on a Gatan K2 Summit or on a Gatan K3 direct electron 556\ndetector after a Quantum Ls 967 energy filter using a 20 eV slit width in zero-loss mode. Images 557\nwere collected in super-resolution mode at a nominal magnification of 105,000x (K2 summit) 558\nor 81,000x (K3) which yielded a pixel size of 0.55 or 0.852 \u00c5. For each image, 40 movie frames 559\nwere recorded at a dose of 1.32 electrons per \u00c5\u00b2 per frame corresponding to a total dose of 560 52.8 e/\u00c52, but only the last 38 frames were kept for further processing. 561\n562 Image processing 563\nWARP was used to perform the first pre-processing steps, aligning movie frames, dose-564\nweighting, correct the beam-induced specimen motion and Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) 565 estimation36. After visual inspection, images with poor CTF, showing particle aggregation or 566\nabundant ice contamination were discarded. Particle coordinates were determined using 567 crYOLO (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/356584). The datasets were analyzed in Relion 3.137 568 and cryoSPARC38 according to standard protocols. Briefly, three rounds of reference free 2D 569\nclassification of the individual particle images were performed in cryoSPARC to remove 570\nimages corresponding to contaminating or damaged particles and ice contaminations. Four 571\nreferences (3-D models) were generated by the ab initio 3-D reconstruction program of cryoSPARC. 572\nThese structures were then used as references for a 3D classification job in cryoSPARC, and particles 573\ncorresponding to high resolution 3-D classes were selected and used for non-uniform refinement. 574\nWe carried out a focused refinement of different part of NuA4 using the masked including 575\nupper lobes, the head of Tra1 and their junction or just the upper lobe. Global resolution 576\nestimates were determined using the FSC = 0.143 criterion after a gold-standard refinement. 577 Local resolutions were estimated with ResMap39 and cryoSPARC. To analyze the 578\nheterogeneity in the cryo-EM map due to the presence of the flexible Piccolo module (MW: 579\n144 kDa), we used the neural network-based cryoDRGN reconstruction to map the particles 580 on 2 principal components40. For each WT and short linker mutant data set, we partitioned 581\nthe latent space into twenty regions and a density map was generated from the center of 582\neach region. The maps were thresholded to a value that corresponds to the expected volume 583 of NuA4 (MW: 1.030.447 Da), assuming an average protein density of 0.825 Da/A3. Upon 584\nvisual inspection, the maps were grouped into three classes according to the absence (class 585\n1) or the presence of an additional mass disconnected (class 2) or connected (class 3) to the 586\ncore of NuA4. To determine the low-resolution map of Piccolo, the density of the stable core-587\nNuA4 was subtracted from the original images and the images were re-centered according to 588\nthe expected position of Piccolo. A two-dimensional classification step was performed to 589\nassure the correct subtraction of the core of NuA4 and the presence of a residual density. Ab-590\ninitio reconstruction followed by 3D classification steps in cryoSPARC were used to 591\nreconstruct the map of Piccolo at 12 \u00c5 resolution. 592\n593 Model building 594\nHomology models for Act1, Arp4 and the SANT domains of Eaf1 and Swc4 were generated using 595 iTASSER41 or Swiss-model and docked into the maps using the chimera docking tool. Eaf1, 596 Swc4 and Epl1 where build de-novo using the Coot software42. To facilitate de-novo model 597 building, the web service RaptorX43 and PSIPRED44 were used to predict secondary structure 598\nand disordered parts. A large proportion of the coulombic potential difference map (hereafter 599\ncalled density) associated to each side chain was clear and practically all densities in the core 600\nof NuA4 could be assigned with confidence. For Eaf1 residues 367-389 and Tra1 residues 4-601\n300, 2019-2392 and 2969-3051, the local resolution of the structure did not allow us to place 602\nthe side chain but was enough to place helices and trace the C-alpha backbone. The atomic 603 model was refined in Phenix by real-space refinement with secondary structure restrains45. 604 All display images were generated using UCSF Chimera46 and ChimeraX47. 605\n606\n607\nFigures legends 608\n617\n625\n626 627\nFigure 3 | Shortening the Epl1 linker uncovers the HAT module. a, Linker deletion mutants 628 used in this study.
