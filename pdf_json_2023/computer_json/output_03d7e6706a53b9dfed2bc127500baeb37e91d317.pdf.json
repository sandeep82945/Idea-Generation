    "abstractText": "The conventional polar format algorithm (CPFA) is widely used for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) because of its simple and efficient operations. However, due to its wavefront curvature assumption, the CPFA\u2019s depth-of-focus (DOF) is extremely small, which greatly limits the scene size, especially for high-resolution and highly squinted (HRHS) SAR. To solve this problem, an extended PFA (EPFA) is proposed in this study, re-deriving mapping functions by expanding the range history into slantand cross-range components according to the forms of real data storage. This allows the full use of storage data, which the CPFA cannot achieve due to the large approximations introduced by the projection of echo data onto the ground. The wavefront curvature error is then analyzed and eliminated using a space-variant phase compensation function. Due to the high accuracy of expansion in the slant range plane and the space-variant correction processing, the EPFA has a larger DOF than the CPFA. The EPFA is also more suitable for undulating terrains since it avoids the projection of real data onto the ground plane performed in the CPFA. Using comparative analyses of simulated data and real-world images, the results suggest that the proposed EPFA achieves better focusing effects than the CPFA and is particularly useful for HRHS SAR.",

            "text": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is an advanced microwave remote sensing technique capable of high-resolution measurements of the Earth\u2019s surface [1\u20134]. The highresolution and highly squinted (HRHS) SAR is more flexible in exploring the region of interest and obtaining a detailed image than its broadside counterparts [5]. As a result, HRHS SAR is widely considered one of the most important radar imaging models for military and civilian applications. However, while HRHS SAR can provide more information, it comes with more challenges. Generally, high resolution involves serious range curvature and large computational loads. Similarly, a high squint angle entails large linear range cell migration (LRCM) and a serious cross-coupling phase between the range and azimuth, which makes classical approaches [6\u201310] such as the range-Doppler algorithm (RDA) and the chirp scaling algorithm (CSA) inapplicable for HRHS SAR. For HRHS SAR data processing, the range-azimuth coupling effect becomes negligible, while the space variance of the second range compression (SRC) and the cubic range frequency phase terms become more significant. Several approaches have been developed to improve highly squinted SAR imaging qualities [11\u201316]. Because the CSA and ECSA ignore the space-variance SRC term, their performance is degraded for highly squinted SAR images [4]. The nonlinear CSA (NCSA) was developed to eliminate SRC variation in high-squint-angle images by introducing a perturbation function [11,12]. However, the range-dependent cubic- and higher-order terms are neglected in the NCSA. In [17], an extended NCS based on series reversion was proposed, taking higher-order terms into\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 456. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15020456 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 456 2 of 14\naccount. In [18], an azimuth nonlinear scaling algorithm was presented to improve the focusing performance. In general, as the squint angle and the resolution increase, more terms should be considered, which would make focusing more complicated. In recent years, more studies on the NCSAs [19\u201323] have been conducted to improve SAR data processing for more complicated imaging geometries. As a kind of time-domain algorithm with high precision, the back-projection algorithm (BPA) [24] and fast factorized BPA (FFBPA) [25,26] are considered ideal algorithms for highsquint SAR. However, compared with the frequency-domain algorithms, the time-domain approach provides lower adaptability and practicability in terms of the computational burden [27], especially for HRHS SAR. More appropriate two-dimensional (2-D) frequencydomain imaging methods have been developed, such as the omega-K algorithm [28\u201330], the polar format algorithm (PFA) [31], and the improved types [32\u201335]. As a popular method for spotlight SAR, the PFA has been widely studied and used in various applications [31,32]. The conventional PFA (CPFA) considers the center point in the imagery as the compensation reference point, according to the fact that SAR echo signals after demodulation are samples of the Fourier transform (FT) of the scene reflectivity function on a polar grid in the wavenumber domain. The differential range is approximated by utilizing a far-field assumption in CPFA, which restricts the depth of focus (DOF) [36]. The residual errors, primarily referring to wavefront bending errors, increase as the scene size expands, introducing spatially variant distortions and defocus effects into the final image, especially for HRHS SAR. A general formulation for wavefront curvature correction was derived for monistic and bistatic SAR (BiSAR) in [37,38], respectively. Hu et al. [39,40] proposed the refocusing and zoom-in PFAs (RZPFAs) for spotlight SAR imaging on an arbitrary region of interest (ROI). Incorporating 2-D non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NuFFT) operations and sub-ROIs processing into the RZPFAs could greatly decrease the impacts brought by distortion and defocusing. To expand the imaging scene, a wavefront bending correction method is proposed by Mao et al. in [41] for arbitrary flight paths, which is based on the sub-aperture method. In [42], a two-step wide-scene PFA for HRHS SAR was proposed, which uses the first and second PFA to obtain a precisely focused sub-image. Deng et al. presented a generalized PFA for BiSAR with several modes using a space-variant phase filter, which could reduce the effects introduced by the plane-wave assumption [43]. In [44], a space-variant phase compensation method was proposed for BiSAR, deriving the phase error introduced by wavefront curvature. In these methods, the PFA is expected to have been formed in the ground plane to limit the distortions and provide good phase-history matching; however, they largely ignore the height information of the target. One alternative way to produce a SAR image from the received samples is to consider a set of coordinate axes in the slant plane, expanding the range history into slantand cross-range parts according to the forms of real data storage. The target\u2019s position information is then included in the slant-range variable. In this paper, considering the unique decoupling ability of PFA for any squint angle, an extended PFA (EPFA) for HRHS SAR is proposed. The geometric model is first established, and a new range model based on 2-D Taylor series expansion is provided. The phase errors caused by wavefront curvature errors are then analyzed in detail. According to the new range model, the mapping functions of EPFA are re-derived in the slant range plane, having higher accuracies than the CPFA. To eliminate the effect of wavefront curvature, a space-variant compensation filter in the azimuth wavenumber domain is obtained based on the analysis of phase errors. Finally, a subblock compensation method is adopted, which considers the phase error space-invariant in the subblock but the space variance between subblock cannot be ignored. Unlike the CPFA, the EPFA is insensitive to height variations since the out-of-plane projection [45] is avoided. The construction of the paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 describes the geometric model and the wavefront curvature error, while the proposed EPFA based on the new 2-D Taylor series expanded range model is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents the experimental comparisons between CPFA and EPFA using simulated and re-al-measured\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 456 3 of 14\nSAR data, evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, the research conclusions are summarized in Section 5."

After the EPFA processing, a space-variant filter is employed to eliminate the defocus effects induced by \u2206\u03c3S. Based on the EPFA, a space-variant error compensation method is adopted in this paper, which is a subblock compensation method.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 456 7 of 14\n3.2.1. Phase Compensation Filter The space-variant phase error after interpolation can be expressed as \u03d5cur ( K\u2032r, K\u2032y ) in (13), which is obtained by the mapping relation provided by (10) from \u03d5cur(Kr, \u03b7). Substituting (7) into (13), the residual phase after the 2-D interpolation is expressed as:\n\u03d5cur ( K\u2032r, K \u2032 y, \u2206r, \u2206y ) = \u2212Kr ( \u2211\ni+j=2\nCi2\u2202 2RN(\u03b7\u2217)\n2\u2202riN\u2202y j N \u2206ri\u2206yj + \u2211 i+j=3\nCi3\u2202 3RN(\u03b7\u2217)\n6\u2202riN\u2202y j N\n\u2206ri\u2206yj ) (15)\nUsing the 2-D interpolation processing in (12), the original azimuth time \u03b7 becomes the non-uniform sampling time \u03b7\u2217. The new azimuth time \u03b7\u2217 can be deduced from (12), such that\nK\u2032r K\u2032y = \u03c1r(\u03b7\u2217) \u03c1y(\u03b7\u2217) = |rM| \u2212v\u03b7\u2217 (16)\nThen, \u03b7\u2217 can be obtained as:\n\u03b7\u2217 = \u2212 K\u2032y \u00b7 |rM|\nK\u2032r \u00b7 v (17)\nNote that \u03b7\u2217 is a function of K\u2032r and K\u2032y. Then, (15) can be rearranged as:\n\u03d5cur ( Ky \u2032, \u2206r, \u2206y ) = \u2212Ky \u2032\n[ 3\n\u2211 i=1\n\u03bei(\u2206r, \u2206y)\u03b7\u2217(i\u22121) ]\n(18)\nwhere the coefficient \u03bei is space-variant and is given as: \u03be1(\u2206r, \u2206y) = \u2206r2yM |rM |2 + \u2206r 3yM |rM |3 \u2212 \u2206r\u2206y|rM | \u2212 \u2206r2\u2206y |rM |2 \u03be2(\u2206r, \u2206y) = \u2212 \u2206r 2v 2|rM |2 \u2212 \u2206r3v 2|rM |4 \u2212 \u2206r 2\u2206yyMv |rM |4\n\u03be3(\u2206r, \u2206y) = \u2206r2\u2206yv2\n2|rM |4\n(19)\nThus, the space-variant wavenumber domain filter can be expressed as:\nH ( Ky \u2032 ) = exp { jKy \u2032 [ 3\n\u2211 i=1\n\u03bei(\u2206r, \u2206y)\u03b7\u2217(i\u22121) ]}\n(20)\n3.2.2. Space-Variant Filter Implementation\nSince the coefficients \u03bei are space-variant, the computation burden would be enormous if H ( Ky \u2032 )\nis varied with the target position according to the expression in (20). Processing can be made considerably more efficient by updating the filter function only as rapidly as required to maintain the residual defocus at an acceptable level [37]. Thus, the uncompensated EPFA image must be divided into several subblocks for curvature phase error correction. This method considers the phase error space-invariant in the subblock and the space-variant between subblocks. Then, the spectra of subblocks are multiplied by the compensation filter with the updated parameters corresponding to their central positions. The detailed implementation steps are shown below:\n(1) Partition: The uncompensated EPFA image is divided into Nr \u00d7 Ny sub-images, which should guarantee that at the edge of the sub-image, the residual defocus can be neglected after filter implementation. Nr and Ny represent the numbers of sub-images in the range and azimuth dimensions, respectively. (2) Filter: A sub-image of the interpolated echo signal in (14) is obtained by windowing, which has a size of Lx \u00d7 Ly and centers on the pixel grid (rm \u00d7 yn). According\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 456 8 of 14\nto the pixel (rm \u00d7 yn), the space-variant error compensation factor in the azimuth wavenumber domain can be constructed as follows:\nH(rm ,yn) ( Ky \u2032 ) = exp { jKy \u2032 [ 3\n\u2211 i=1\n\u03bei(\u2206r, \u2206y)\u03b7\u2217(i\u22121) ]}\n(21)\nThe subblock data are carried out using the azimuth IFT and multiplied by the H(rm ,yn) ( Ky \u2032 ) . The space-variant error is then eliminated in the azimuth wavenumber domain. Finally, the azimuth FT is used to yield the compensated focused image.\n(3) Joint: The previous steps are repeated for all the sub-images. Then the whole image can be created by splicing all the compensated output images of the subregions.\nThe entire EPFA flowchart is presented in Figure 5. The EPFA is easy to implement, having simple process flows similar to the CPFA. The only difference between the CPFA and the EPFA is the mapping functions derived from various decompositions. In particular, the mapping functions could be performed using 2-D interpolation. However, in terms of the computational burden, two one-dimensions (1-Ds) [32,33] and NuFFTs [36] are the preferred option. In addition, the EPFA accounts for the space-variant phase error and extends the imaging scene. The filter processing is realized by compensating for the phase error of the central pixel of the sub-image by providing approximate corrections to the surrounding points, thereby reducing computations and ensuring image continuity.

This indicates that the focusing results of the proposed approach will not be affected by height variation, whereas the focusing results of the traditional method are defocused as a result of ignoring the height variation. It is important to point out that the position of the elevated target is still inaccurate in the EPFA since the target is projected into the slant plane with the incorrect position (layover phenomena) [20,21]. The geometric distortion brought by topography variations should be corrected as discussed in [16,17].

In this experiment, the image entropy values, i.e., 2.66 and 2.37 corresponding to CPFA and EPFA, respectively, are computed to show the superiority of the proposed approach. The experimental results suggest that the proposed EPFA provides better focusing effects for HRHS SAR data than the conventional approach.

(a) CPFA; (b) EPFA.\nIn order to facilitate comparison, Figure 10b shows the focused result on the ground plane projected by the slant-plane image. The Hamming windows were also added in both cases. The results show that the processed image of the EPFA is comparatively better focused than the CPFA, particularly in the reflector area (see highlighted regions).

Conclusions Spatially variant distortions and defocusing effects caused by the wavefront curvature assumption in the CPFA become more pronounced in large scene images. To address this problem, the EPFA was developed for HRHS SAR images, adopting a new range model based on the 2-D Taylor series expansion and accounting for the wavefront curvature error. The 2-D interpolation function is derived in the slant-range plane, and the compensation filter is designed for the space-variant phase errors. In contrast to the CPFA performed in the ground plane, the EPFA is developed using a slant range and an azimuth position in the slant-range plane. The proposed approach has a much larger DOF than the CPFA because of the slant-range decomposition and space-variant correction procedures; the EPFA\u2019s performance is also unaffected by the target height. The experimental results using simulated and real image data show that the proposed method performed well,\nFigure 10. Experimental results. (a) CPFA; (b) EPFA."

However, it is noted that the focusing results presented in this paper did not consider geometric correction. Subsequent studies should focus on developing the geometric correction method for the EPFA to improve the performance and applicability of the proposed algorithm.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 456 13 of 14\nAuthor Contributions: P.G. conceived the main idea; F.W. and P.G. conceived and designed the experiments; A.W. analyzed the data; P.G. and F.W. wrote the paper.
