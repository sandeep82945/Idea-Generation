SCCmec type V was found in S. aureus, the S. intermedius group, S. lentus, S. xylosus, and S. arlettae, and although the authors do not state whether the coagulase-negative species were considered the primary bacterial pathogens in the cases from which they were isolated, the need to reduce environmental contamination and educate veterinary personnel and clients about the potential for the transmission to and from dogs of all resistant staphylococci is emphasized.

[4], in which it was reported that 45% of households were contaminated with MRSP. The data presented by Chanayat et al. [3], includes two S. pseudintermedius isolates that showed MICs < 2 \u03bcg/ml, an interesting finding in light of the publication by Wegener et al. [5] suggesting that such isolates showing low-level resistance may be susceptible to treatment with higher doses of beta-lactams or more frequent administration.

Sci. 2023, 10, 240. https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci10040240 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vetsci\ntyping of isolates was a limitation of this study, as it largely precluded source attribution and comparison with MRSA isolates reported worldwide. Nevertheless, the documentation of MRSA isolation rates in food-producing animal species in different geographical regions is essential to obtain a comprehensive understanding of this public health challenge. Staphylococcus aureus is still the leading cause of bovine mastitis in many countries. Rusenova et al. [10] compared phenotypic and genotypic methods in their evaluation of AMR among bovine mastitis isolates of S. aureus in Bulgaria. The discrepancies detected for some isolates are concerning and, as recommended by the authors, highlight the need for isolates to be thoroughly characterized. Biofilm production is considered an important virulence factor for S. aureus [11] and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), which both cause bovine mastitis. Lee and Lee [12] showed that the prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) was significantly higher in strong or moderate biofilm-producing CoNS than in those that were weak or nonformers in samples isolated from normal bulk tank milk in Korea. As biofilm production is associated with persistence of infection and antimicrobial therapy may not eliminate infection, the authors advise effective monitoring and sanitation programs to prevent the contamination of equipment with environmental CoNS, thus limiting the opportunities for cows to be infected with these organisms. The diverse articles contained in this Special Issue constitute a valuable contribution to our understanding of staphylococcal infection in both farm and companion animals.\nAuthor Contributions: B.K.M. and F.C.L. wrote and reviewed the manuscript.
