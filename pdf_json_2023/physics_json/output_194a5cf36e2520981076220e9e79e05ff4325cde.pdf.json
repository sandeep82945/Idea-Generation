    "abstractText": "Inhalable coal dust poses a serious threat to coal mining safety, air quality, and the health of miners. Therefore, the development of efficient dust suppressants is crucial for addressing this issue. This study evaluated the ability of three high-surface-active OPEO-type nonionic surfactants (OP4, OP9, and OP13) to improve the wetting properties of anthracite via extensive experiments and a molecular simulation and determined the micro-mechanism of different wetting properties. The surface tension results show that OP4 has the lowest surface tension (27.182 mN/m). Contact angle tests and wetting kinetics models suggest that OP4 exhibits the strongest wetting improvement ability on raw coal with the smallest contact angle (20.1\u25e6) and the fastest wetting rate. In addition, FTIR and XPS experimental results also reveal that OP4-treated coal surfaces introduce the most hydrophilic elements and groups. UV spectroscopy testing shows that OP4 has the highest adsorption capacity on the coal surface, reaching 133.45 mg/g. The surfactant is adsorbed on the surface and pores of anthracite, while the strong adsorption ability of OP4 results in the least amount of N2 adsorption (8.408 cm3/g) but the largest specific surface area (1.673 m2/g). In addition, the filling behavior and aggregation behavior of surfactants on the anthracite coal surface were observed using SEM. The MD simulation results indicate that OPEO reagents with overly long hydrophilic chains would produce spatial effects on the coal surface. Under the influence of the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the hydrophobic benzene ring and the coal surface, OPEO reagents with fewer ethylene oxide quantities are more prone to adsorb onto the coal surface. Therefore, after the adsorption of OP4, both the polarity and the water molecule adhesion ability of the coal surface are greatly enhanced, which helps to suppress dust production. These results provide important references and a foundation for future designs of efficient compound dust suppressant systems.",

            "text": "Coal is one of the most important energy sources in the world, with global production reaching 8.111 billion tons in 2022. China is the largest coal-producing country in the world, with coal production reaching 4.45 billion tons in 2022 [1,2]. According to data from China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, coal energy still dominates China\u2019s consumption structure. By 2030, coal will still be China\u2019s main energy source, with its share expected to exceed 50% [3\u20135]. However, the dust produced by coal production poses a major threat to coal mine safety, air quality, and the health of mine workers [6,7]. In underground coal mining, the operation of coal cutting machines causes dust to accumulate, which, combined with factors such as static electricity sparks and mechanical friction, can easily trigger coal dust explosion accidents [8,9]. Coal-mine-dust-induced respiratory diseases have become some of the most common and serious occupational diseases among coal miners. In a work environment where there is much contact with coal dust, pneumoconiosis can\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28124748 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748 2 of 21\ndevelop into progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), which can be fatal for miners [10,11]. Although countries around the world have implemented strict dust management rules for underground mines [12,13], the potential for an enormous disease burden caused by global coal mining operations means that controlling the hazard posed by dust remains a challenging task. Therefore, dust suppression strategies based on surfactants have gained increasing attention from global researchers as effective methods for controlling coal mine dust levels. Using water as a wetting agent cannot meet the wetting requirements of highly metamorphic coal, such as anthracite, with an average dust suppression rate lower than 60% [14\u201316]. Fortunately, the continuous development and application of surfactants have provided an effective means for controlling coal dust. Surfactants achieve dust suppression effects via two aspects: on one hand, by reducing the surface tension of the water solvent, surfactants enhance the wetting ability of coal dust [17,18]; on the other hand, surfactants interact with coal dust by means of adsorption [19]. The adsorption of a surfactant solution on the coal surface changes the composition and content of micro-molecular structures in coal, such as carbon\u2013oxygen groups, which is crucial for increasing the wetting ability and accelerating the wetting speed of coal dust. Traditional methods of surfactant compounding to find the best wetting coal dust solution consume a great amount of resources [5,20]. Therefore, current research focuses on a combination of molecular simulation and experimental characterization to compare the molecular structure characteristics of surfactants and provide further guidance to improve surfactant compounding and application. Among non-ionic surfactants, octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether (OPEO) has a polyoxyethylene chain; is one of the most hydrophilic, dispersion-oriented, and infiltration-oriented agents, with low toxicity and low irritation; and does not harm humans or the environment [21]. To reduce the accumulation of anthracite dust in the air, coal surfaces must have hydrophilicity, and OPEO series agents are ideal choices to obtain this. Many scholars have studied the effects of OPEO surfactants changing the molecular mechanism of wetting low rank coal [22\u201327]; however, there have been very few studies on the micro-adsorption mechanism of OPEO surfactants on anthracite coal surfaces, which indicates a direction for further research. Most studies have focused on the low-rank coal interface, particularly the lignite interface because lignite already has globally recognized coal molecular models, such as the Wiser or Wender coal molecular models [28]. However, there is a lack of corresponding coal molecular models for anthracite. At present, single-component coal models are the most common tools used to study the molecular dynamics of coal interfaces. Nevertheless, due to coal being a complex multi-component macromolecule, using a single coal molecular model makes it difficult to reflect the true coal situation. Our team has established a highmolecular-weight anthracite model with 55 components via extensive experiments [29]. This model has advantages in the richness of the components and the amount of coal molecules, and it has been applied in many studies [30\u201334]. In order to investigate the effect of the number of hydrophilic groups of epoxyethane on the wettability of anthracite under the same hydrophobic groups with benzene ring structures, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations and comparative experiments using the octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether surfactants OP4, OP9, and OP13. The comparative experiments included a surface tension test, a contact angle test, an FTIR test, an XPS test, a UV spectrophotometer test, specific surface area and pore size distribution tests, and an SEM test."

            "text": "Surface tension is a fundamental parameter for evaluating the effectiveness of surfactants. The essential condition for wetting coal dust is that the surface tension of the wetting agent must be significantly less than the critical surface tension, which is approximately 45 mN/m [15,35] (independent of coal rank). As shown in Table 1, the surface tension of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748 3 of 21\ndeionized water is 71.558 mN/m, which is the primary reason for the poor performance of water as a wetting agent.\nFor non-ionic surfactants in the octylphenol ethoxylate ether (OPEO) group, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) increases with the increase in the epoxy ethane group content [36]. However, when the mass concentration exceeds the CMC, further concentration increases do not significantly affect the number of free monomer molecules [37,38]. At this point, the surfactant molecules will form a monolayer. The mass concentration of the OP series surfactant selected was 300 mg/L, its concentration was higher than the CMC [39\u201341], and the surface tension value remained approximately constant (0.5\u20131.5 mN/m). Specific results can be found in Table 1. In the aqueous solutions of the three selected surfactants, OP4 had the lowest surface tension value (27.182 mN/m), with the order of surface tension values being OP4 < OP9 < OP13. The addition of these agents significantly reduced the surface tension of the aqueous solutions. Considering the bending characteristics of the hydrophobic tail chains of surfactant molecules and the effect of the benzene ring structure on their spatial conformation, and with the increase in the number of epoxy ethane groups in the hydrophilic groups, longer hydrophilic chains may bring about spatial effects, limiting the micellization process between surfactant molecules [42,43]. Compared with OP9 and OP13, OP4 has a lower critical micelle concentration (CMC) due to its shorter hydrophilic chain, while the hydrophobic groups are completely identical. According to the diffusion double layer theory, after single surfactant molecules in a high concentration solution form a micelle, the surface of the micelles is further promoted in the rate of micelle formation in the system due to the electrostatic attraction [44,45]. This is also the main reason why OP4 has the lowest surface tension."

            "text": "The wetting performance of three different surfactant solutions on the surface of anthracite was evaluated by an assessment of the contact angles produced between them [2,46]. Deionized water and coal samples were used as control groups, and their contact angle values at 3 s were compared. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 1, the contact angle between deionized water and anthracite was determined to be 120.9\u25e6, clearly highlighting the difficulty of wetting anthracite with pure water. On the other hand, the contact angle values between the coal sample and OP4, OP9, and OP13 were 20.1\u25e6, 39.4\u25e6, and 62.1\u25e6, respectively, with OP4 manifesting the best wetting effect. The results indicate that the introduction of surfactant solutions significantly reduces the contact angle values at the solid\u2013liquid interface while significantly enhancing the wetting ability of the solutions. Therefore, the results are consistent with previous findings on surface tension. We studied the wetting process of three surfactants and deionized water on the coal surface within a 0\u20133 s time interval. Figure 2A illustrates the dynamic nature of the wetting process of coal dust as it varies over time. Combined with contact angle measurement data, the surfactant wetting ability of coal dust is in the following order: OP4 > OP9 > OP13. The experimental group showed a clear contrast with the reference group of deionized water, indicating that the addition of surfactants greatly assists in improving the wettability of anthracite.

FTIR Analysis The surface chemical structure and functional group content distribution of raw coal\nand three modified coal samples can be characterized and analyzed by FTIR [48]. This approach can explain the micro-mechanism of the increased we ability of modified coal, as shown in Figure 3. By compari g the FTIR spectra f raw oal and modified coal, significant differences were found between the two absorbance bands: the hydroxyl structure absorption band and the characteristic peaks of long-chain alkyl CH2 and CH3 str tching vibration, which are, respe tively, located in the 3700\u20133000 cm\u22121 and 3000\u20132800 cm\u22121 regions.\nStudies have identified that hydroxyl functional groups, crucial oxygenated functional groups present in coal, primarily serve as adsorption sites for water molecules. Additionally, the majority of hydroxyl groups in coal exist as hydroxyl polymers [49,50]. Nearly 51.53% of the hydroxyl structure adsorption bands in raw coal are filled with the presence of free hydroxyl groups that exist near 3600 cm\u22121 [51]. However, the hydroxyl groups in modified coal have experienced a significant transformation due to the surface modification with OPEO surfactants. This results in the emergence of a robust peak near 3440 cm\u22121, which is not present in raw coal. The fitting results of the characteristic peak in Figure S1 (Supplementary Materials) show that the content of free hydroxyl groups near 3600 cm\u22121 in OP4 is almost negligible, and 5.61% of free hydroxyl groups were observed\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748 6 of 21\nnear 3583 cm\u22121 in OP9, while the content of free hydroxyl groups near 3580 cm\u22121 in OP13 was 6.81%. Furthermore, the modified coal indicates a considerable increase in the OH\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7OH groups content near 3450 cm\u22121 and OH\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O groups content near 3300 cm\u22121. More specifically, the proportion of OH\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7OH groups in OP4, OP9, and OP13 was 59.57%, 49.32%, and 35.08%, respectively. This indicates that, as the hydrophilic chain length increases, the adsorption amount of surfactant on the surface of anthracite decreases. OP4 can better improve the hydrophilicity of anthracite, and water molecules can develop an extensive binding with the altered coal surface\u2019s oxygen sites by producing a significant number of hydrogen bonds. The 3000\u20132800 cm\u22121 region is part of the absorption region for the fat structure. As shown in Figure S2, the most common functional groups in this region are the asymmetric stretching vibration of -CH2 near 2920 cm\u22121 and the symmetric stretching vibration of -CH2 near 2850 cm\u22121 [52]. Compared with the OP9 and OP13 samples, the OP4 sample has a narrower and less prominent band in the 3000\u20132800 cm\u22121 range. This is mainly due to the structure of the surfactant itself. As the length of the hydrophilic chain increases, the number of -CH2 groups in the surfactant multiplies. In an OP13 molecule, there are 18 additional -CH2 groups compared to an OP4 molecule. Therefore, even though the adsorption rate of OP4 is higher than the other two samples, the order of -CH2 content is still in the sequence of OP4 < OP9 < OP13 due to the increasing number of -CH2 groups in the surfactant."

As C-C/C-H groups have strong hydrophobicity and C-O groups are important functional groups for improving coal wettability [54,55], this result suggests that OP4 has a significant enhancing effect on the wettability of anthracite. Both raw and modified coal surfaces contain three different oxygen atoms with different binding energies. As can be seen from the O 1s spectrum in Table 3, the state of oxygen on the coal surface changed significantly after modification with the surfactant. In the raw coal, oxygen atoms mainly exist in the form of the C=O group, accounting for 59.05% of the total. However, after modification with OPEO-type surfactants, the oxygen atoms on the coal surface transform into the C-O/OH group, which is a strongly polar functional group with high hydrophilicity [56]. Specifically, the content of the C-O/OH group in\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748 8 of 21\nOP4 even reaches 86.31%, and it exceeds 50% in both OP9 and OP13, becoming the main group of oxygen atoms. In OPEO-type surfactants, the stable \u03c0-bond interaction between the benzene ring structure and the aromatic ring structure on the anthracite surface is formed. In this case, the hydrophobic groups are completely identical, and the length of the hydrophilic groups becomes the only factor affecting the surfactant\u2019s large-scale adsorption on the coal surface. Experimental data show that for OPEO surfactants an increase in the length of hydrophilic chains is unfavorable for their full adsorption on the coal surface. Instead, due to the effect of spatial effects, the surfactant molecules cannot fully stretch out, become entangled with each other, and cannot effectively capture water molecules, thus affecting the overall wettability of the modified coal. The results of O 1s indicate that the OP4-modified coal surface has more hydrophilic oxygen functional groups, which gives it better wetting performance."

            "text": "UV spectrophotometry is a qualitative or quantitative means of detecting octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether surfactants [57,58], and the adsorption of surfactants on the coal surface can be characterized using differential subtraction. As shown in Figure 6A, the UV absorption spectra of the three surfactants all exhibit strong and weak absorption peaks around 224 nm and 276 nm, respectively, formed by the \u03c0-\u03c0 transition absorption bands of the surfactant benzene ring with auxiliary chromophoric substituents O- and the \u03c0-\u03c0 transition characteristic absorption band of the aromatic compound [59,60]. It can be seen that the absorbance of OP4 is highest around 276 nm, reaching 1.1213, followed by OP9 and OP13 with absorbances of 0.8870 and 0.4822, respectively. The absorbance near 276 nm is generally selected as the fitting baseline for surfactants because the weak absorption peak in this region has better correlation and comparability. The mass concentration\u2013absorbance fitting baseline shown in Figure 6B indicates that the mass concentration of the surfactant solution has a good correlation with absorbance within a concentration range of 0\u2013400 mg/L, and the Pearson correlation coefficient reaches above 0.990, conforming to the Lambert\u2013Beer law [61]. The slope of the fitting line shows that OP4 > OP9 > OP13, indicating that the absorbance of the OP4 solution is more sensitive to changes in mass concentration and has relatively small measurement errors. By measuring the absorbance values of the three types of surfactant solutions adsorbed on coal samples in the upper centrifugal liquid layer and combining them with fitted baseline data, the corresponding mass concentration can be obtained. Then, the adsorption amount of the surfactant on the coal surface can be calculated using the differential subtraction method, represented by Equation (4):\nw = (C0 \u2212 C1)\u00d7Vliquid\nm (4)\nwhere w is the amount of surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the coal sample, mg/g; C0 is the initial mass concentration of the surfactant solution, mg/L; C1 is the mass concentration of the surfactant solution after adsorption, mg/L; Vliquid is the volume of the solution, L; m is the mass of the coal sample, g.

The results of the BET analysis showed that the specific surface area of coal dust increased after being treat d with surfactant. The specific surface area of the raw coal was 1.365 m2/g, while th values of three modified coals, namely, OP13, OP9, and OP4, were 1.548 m2/g, 1.602 m2/g, and 1.673 m2/g, respectively.

Surfactant molecules also indirectly increase the number of micropores on the surface of modified coal by filling the large pores, which leads to an increase in specific surface area. This elevation of specific surface area confirms the increased effective adsorption of surfactant in the pores of the anthracite surfac , which leads to the improvement of the wettability of modified coal.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation Results 2.8.1. Contact Surface Area\nThe contact surface area (CSA) reflects the strength of adsorption between two materials, and there is a positive correlation between contact surface area and adsorption strength [71]. CSA can be calculated using Equation (5):\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34 = (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34 + \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34 \u2212 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34 )/2 (5)\nwhere \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34 , \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34 , and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34 are the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the anthracite model, the surfactant, and the anthracite\u2013surfactant binary model, respectively. In this study, the applicable probe radius was 0.14 nm [72]. The CSA values of OP4, OP9, and OP13 are 3722.40 \u00c5, 3670.38 \u00c5, and 3442.64 \u00c5, respectively. The highest CSA value is observed for OP4, indicating the highest adsorption strength of it to anthracite, while the lowest value was found for OP13. Consequently, it can be concluded that OP4 forms relatively dense network structures on the surface of coal, but longer hydrophilic chains cannot arrange tightly and efficiently due to spatial effects.\n2.8.2. Interaction Energy In the modified coal system, the interaction energy between surfactants and anthracite can be used to measure the strength of adsorption. The more heat released, the greater the negative value of interaction energy, indicating that the structure after adsorption is more stable and the adsorption strength is higher [73]. The total interaction energy E is affected by both van der Waals interaction energy EV and electrostatic interaction energy EE, reflecting the improvement space of modified coal\u2019s we ing performance [74]. The interaction energy is defined by Equations (6)\u2013(8):\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49 \u2212 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49 \u2212 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49 (6)\nFigure 9.

The total interaction energy E is affected by both van der Waals interaction energy EV and electrostatic interaction energy EE, reflecting the improvement space of modified coal\u2019s wetting performance [74].

It can be seen from Table 5 that through the comparison of the total interaction energy E, we found that the OP4-modified coal system had the highest interaction energy and released the most energy during the adsorption process. This indicates that the adsorption configuration of OP4 on the surface of anthracite was more stable, which promoted the enhancement of the surface hydrophilicity of the modified coal. At the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748 13 of 21\nsame time, it was found that van der Waals interactions always played a dominant role in the three modified coals, which was because OPEO series surfactants belong to the nonionic surfactant family and their adsorption behavior on an anthracite surface belonged to physical adsorption. The OP4 system had the largest negative interaction energy, while the OP13 system with a longer hydrophilic chain had a smaller interaction energy. This indicated that the number of polyethylene units played a decisive role in explaining the adsorption behavior of surfactants. The accumulation degree of OPEO surfactants on the surface of anthracite depended largely on the number of polyethylene units: the more polyethylene units, the larger the volume occupied by the surfactant molecules and the lower the adsorption density.\n2.8.3. Relative Concentration Distribution\nFigure 10 demonstrates the mass density distribution of each component along the Z-axis in raw and modified coals, which quantitatively reflects the adsorption ability and adsorption layer structural parameter information of three types of surfactants [37]. Firstly, the initial water layer distance in the raw coal system is 43.38 \u00c5, and the overlap width of coal and water is 12.57 \u00c5. In contrast, in the modified coal system, the initial water layer distances are 59.08 \u00c5 (OP4), 59.85 \u00c5 (OP9), and 58.19 \u00c5 (OP13), with coal and water overlap widths of 1.35 \u00c5 (OP4), 5.57 \u00c5 (OP9), and 8.84 \u00c5 (OP13), respectively. Obviously, in the OP4 system, the overlap between coal and water is minimal, and the contact between the water layer and the surfactant is greater. This implies that OP4 can cover the surface of anthracite more densely, thereby forming a stable intermediate medium at the coal\u2013water interface. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 22\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748 14 of 21\nSecondly, the distribution range of the hydrophobic groups of the OP4 surfactant is 44.14\u201364.51 \u00c5, with a distribution width of 20.37 \u00c5. Within the range of 44.14\u201360.43 \u00c5, the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant overlaps with the coal surface, with an overlap width of 16.29 \u00c5. In comparison, in OP9 and OP13, their hydrophobic tails, respectively, overlap the coal surface with an overlap width of 10.60 and 8.84 \u00c5. This indicates a stronger interaction between OP4 and the coal surface. The coal surface is mainly composed of hydrophobic sites consisting of numerous alkyl chains and aromatic rings, and there are relatively few hydrophilic sites with negative charges brought by oxygen functional groups. A small amount of surfactant molecules form hydrophilic groups via hydrogen bonding with the few hydrophilic hydroxyl groups on the coal surface. While a large amount of surfactant molecules adsorb to the coal surface primarily via hydrophobic interactions, thus exposing a large number of hydrophilic groups, which is a property of nonpolar groups. In OPEOtype surfactant micelles, the shorter the hydrophilic chain, the stronger the interaction between the hydrophilic group and the hydroxyl group of water molecules. This is also one of the reasons that contributes to the outstanding wetting properties of the OP4 surfactant. Finally, we compared the relative concentrations of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of surfactants in three modified coal systems along the Z-axis. The results showed that with the increase in hydrophilic chains, the relative concentration of hydrophilic head groups decreased continuously. The relative concentration of hydrophilic head groups in OP4 was the highest, reaching 25.50, while in OP9 and OP13, it was 23.77 and 21.29, respectively. In contrast, the relative concentration of hydrophobic groups of the three surfactants showed an increasing trend from 26.14 in OP4 to 28.71 in OP13. These results indicate that the adsorption capacity of the coal surface by OP4 is higher, resulting in a higher relative concentration of hydrophilic groups in the system and a denser network structure formed on the coal surface. This also makes the contact between the OP4-modified coal surface and water molecules closer and more likely to form hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing the hydrophilicity of the anthracite.\n2.8.4. Mean Square Displacement\nCalculating the diffusion coefficient D of water molecules on the surface of the modified coal allows an assessment of the effect of surfactants on the aggregation effect of water molecules on the surface of the coal [75,76]. Equations (9)\u2013(11) are shown below:\nMSD = 1 N\nN\n\u2211 i=1 [ri(t)\u2212 ri(0)]2 (9)\nD = 1\n6N lim t\u2192\u221e d dt\nN\n\u2211 i=1 [ri(t)\u2212 ri(0)]2 (10)\nD = lim t\u2192\u221e\n( MSD\n6t\n) =\n1 6 KMSD (11)\nIn the above equation, MSD denotes the mean square displacement; N is the number of diffusing molecules; r(t) and r(0) denote the displacement vectors of the molecules at time t and t = 0, respectively; and KMSD denotes the slope curve of MSD. The diffusion coefficients of water molecules in the OP4, OP9, and OP13 systems are 0.63835, 0.71594, and 1.25392 \u00c52/ps, respectively. Studies have shown that the coal surface adsorbed with OPEO surfactants containing more hydrophilic groups and ethylene oxide units can release more water molecules and have a higher diffusion rate. The water molecule migration rate on the OP4-modified coal surface is the lowest, indicating the strongest binding ability to water molecules and the higher hydrophilicity of the OP4-modified coal surface. This finding effectively verifies that OPEO molecules with higher ethoxylation degrees have a lower saturation adsorption density, smaller adsorption strength, less\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748 15 of 21\ncoverage on the coal surface, and worse wetting effects on anthracite coal than OPEO surfactants with short hydrophilic chains."

This study focuses on anthracite obtained from the No. 3 coal seam of the Zhaozhuang coal mine in Jincheng, Shanxi Province, China. Xue\u2019s research [77] suggests that coal dust particles exhibit a significant particle size distribution peak around 60\u201370 \u00b5m for inhalable dust particle size distribution. Consequently, we obtained coal powder with a size of 200 mesh (74 \u00b5m) by crushing and sieving in this study. After acid-washing with HCl/HF/HCl to reduce its ash content, the coal powder had an ash content of 0.3%. The coal powder was then vacuum-dried at 105 \u25e6C for 10 h, cooled to room temperature, and sealed for later use. Non-ionic surfactants are extensively researched due to their high surface activity, which significantly enhances the wetting properties of coal dust. For this study, we used the octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether series OP4, OP9, and OP13 as experimental reagents.

Conclusions In this study, we evaluated the ability of OP4, OP9, and OP13 to improve the\nwe ability of anthracite via multiple comparative experiments. We used molecular dynamics modeling to determine the micro-mechanisms of different we ing properties of OPEO surfactants.\nSurface tension tests were used, and it was found that, in the absence of anthracite, OP4 had the lowest surface tension (27.182 mN/m) compared to the other two reagents. OP4 also showed significantly be er adsorption performance at the water\u2013air interface. Contact angle tests revealed that OP4 has the highest ability to improve the we ability of anthracite effectively. This was confirmed by the K value of the we ing kinetics model established. In addition, FTIR and XPS experimental results also support this by showing that OP4 is capable of introducing the most hydrophilic elements and groups to the modified coal surface. UV spectroscopy testing revealed that OP4 had the highest adsorption amount on the coal surface, reaching 133.45 mg/g. A comparison of the specific surface area and pore distribution characteristics of coal dust before and after surfactant treatment showed that the adsorption of numerous agent molecules reduced the number and volume of pores in coal. OP4\u2019s strong adsorption ability caused its specific surface area to increase. Moreover, the SEM analysis results demonstrated that the surfactant caused filling and aggregation phenomena, further indicating that it improves the we ability of anthracite.\nVia molecular dynamics simulations, we found that the longer hydrophilic chains of OPEO surfactants do not lead to the increased adsorption of surfactant molecules on the surface of anthracite. On the contrary, excessively long hydrophilic chains tend to entangle and hinder their access to the water phase, thus reducing their ability to capture more water molecules. Conversely, shorter hydrophilic chains of the reagent can be er adsorb on the coal surface via \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with the hydrophobic groups, and, since the hydrophilic chains are shorter, they are more easily extended into the water phase and not blocked by space effects. Thus, they do not restrict the adsorption of more molecules\nstage balances conf rmation.

We used molecular dynamics modeling to determine the micro-mechanisms of different wetting properties of OPEO surfactants. Surfa e tension tests were used, and it was found that, in the absenc of anthracite, OP4 had the lowest urface tension (27.182 mN/m) compared to the other two reagents. OP4 also showed significantly better adsorption performance at the water\u2013air interface. Contact angle tests revealed that OP4 has the highest ability to improve the wettability of anthracite effectively. This was confirmed by the K value of the wetting kinetics model established. In addition, FTIR and XPS experimental results also support this by showing that OP4 is capable of introducing the most hydrophilic elements and groups to the modified coal surface.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4748 18 of 21\nUV spectroscopy testing revealed that OP4 had the highest adsorption amount on the coal surface, reaching 133.45 mg/g. A comparison of the specific surface area and pore distribution characteristics of coal dust before and after surfactant treatment showed that the adsorption of numerous agent molecules reduced the number and volume of pores in coal. OP4\u2019s strong adsorption ability caused its specific surface area to increase. Moreover, the SEM analysis results demonstrated that the surfactant caused filling and aggregation phenomena, further indicating that it improves the wettability of anthracite. Via molecular dynamics simulations, we found that the longer hydrophilic chains of OPEO surfactants do not lead to the increased adsorption of surfactant molecules on the surface of anthracite. On the contrary, excessively long hydrophilic chains tend to entangle and hinder their access to the water phase, thus reducing their ability to capture more water molecules. Conversely, shorter hydrophilic chains of the reagent can better adsorb on the coal surface via \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with the hydrophobic groups, and, since the hydrophilic chains are shorter, they are more easily extended into the water phase and not blocked by space effects. Thus, they do not restrict the adsorption of more molecules in multiple layers. Therefore, after OP4 absorbs onto the surface of anthracite coal, the polarity and water-binding capacity of the anthracite coal surface are significantly increased, resulting in a reduction in anthracite coal dust. Our results not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the micro-mechanisms of surfactant structure in improving the wettability of anthracite coal but also provide a vital reference for the future selection and design of efficient dust suppression systems. We recommend a further discussion of the significance and application prospects of our research.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28124748/s1, Figure S1.
