Expansion to 3D Image Registration: Extend the current 2D image registration framework to 3D image registration, addressing the additional complexities and benefits of spatial depth. This would involve adapting the INR framework for 3D coordinate spaces and assessing its performance in capturing more complex anatomical structures and gene expression patterns within a three-dimensional context. This extension could significantly enhance the utility of the approach in clinical and research settings where 3D imaging is prevalent.

Application to Other Image Modalities: Explore the applicability of the proposed INR-based registration method to other medical imaging modalities, such as MRI, CT, or PET images. This research could evaluate the method's effectiveness in handling different types of image artifacts, variations in image quality, and anatomical differences across imaging techniques. Tailoring the approach to specific modalities may involve adjusting the architecture of the implicit neural networks or the loss functions used during training.

Integration with Automated Disease Diagnosis Systems: Develop an integrated system that combines the INR-based image registration method with machine learning models for automated disease diagnosis. By improving the accuracy of image registration, particularly in cases with significant artifacts or anatomical variations, such a system could enhance the reliability of automated diagnoses based on structural or functional abnormalities detected in medical images.

Enhancing Image Decomposition Techniques for Better Artifact Handling: Further refine the image decomposition aspect of the method to more effectively separate and possibly quantify artifacts and features of interest in medical images. This could involve developing new loss functions or network architectures that are more sensitive to subtle variations in image textures and patterns. Such improvements could be particularly valuable in research settings where precise quantification of specific features or patterns is critical.

Cross-Species Image Registration for Comparative Studies: Apply the INR-based registration method to cross-species image registration tasks, facilitating comparative neuroanatomical studies or the translation of research findings from model organisms to humans. This line of research would involve adapting the method to handle the greater anatomical and textural variability encountered across species, potentially contributing to a better understanding of evolutionary neurobiology and the development of new therapeutic targets for neurological disorders.
