    "abstractText": "Astilbin is a dihydroflavonol glycoside identified in many natural plants and functional food with promising biological activities which is used as an antioxidant in the pharmaceutical and food fields. This work investigated the interaction between astilbin and human serum albumin (HSA) and their effects on the antioxidant activity of astilbin by multi-spectroscopic and molecular modeling studies. The experimental results show that astilbin quenches the fluorescence emission of HSA through a static quenching mechanism. Astilbin and HSA prefer to bind at the Site I position, which is mainly maintained by electrostatic force, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Multi-spectroscopic and MD results indicate that the secondary structure of HSA could be changed because of the interaction of astilbin with HSA. DPPH radical scavenging assay shows that the presence of HSA reduces the antioxidant capacity of astilbin. The explication of astilbin\u2013HSA binding mechanism will provide insights into clinical use and resource development of astilbin in food and pharmaceutical industries.",

            "text": "Flavonoids are widespread throughout the plant kingdom [1], most of which are classified into six subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavonones and anthocyanidins [2]. Studies indicate that flavonols could reduce the risk of chronic illnesses, and some have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic or neuroprotective properties [3]. Astilbin (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1) is a dihydroflavonol rhamnoside found in numerous natural plants, such as Hypericum perforatum [4] and Smilax glabra Roxb [5]. Meanwhile, astilbin is prevalent in blades and veins of healthy grapevine leaves [6]. Noteworthily, wines contain high levels of astilbin [7], which has been shown to contribute notably to the sweet taste of dry wines [8]. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that astilbin has various pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory [9], immunosuppressive [10], antioxidant [11], anti-diabetic [12] and cardiovascular protection [13]. Overall observations from data suggested that astilbin is a promising compound and a \u201cstar material\u201d for the development of new health food products. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most important plasma proteins in the human circulatory system, with amazing ligand-binding capacity which act as a warehouse and transporter of many endogenous and exogenous compounds [14]. Hence, HSA is an important biomolecule in distribution and transport of drugs, hormones, nutrients,\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4487. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27144487 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4487 2 of 19\nmetabolites etc. [15]. The mature HSA has a heart-shaped three-dimensional crystal space structure with three structural domains (I\u2212III), each with two subdomains [16], A and B, respectively. The two well-known binding sites available on HSA are Sudlow site I and II, located in subdomain IIA and IIIA [17]. A pivotal step in the domain of drug discovery is the investigation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs [18]. The abundance of HSA makes it an important factor in the pharmacokinetic behavior of many drugs as it affects their efficacy and delivery rate, and the binding of a drug to HSA is a critical factor determining its pharmacological profiling and distribution [19]. After entering the body and binding to HSA, the small drug molecule is transported to the target site and then exerts physiological activity in the body. All these characteristic features have stimulated many efforts to understand HSA/drug binding. Astilbin has more physiological activity and medicinal value. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three studies that report the binding of astilbin with HSA or bovine serum albumin (BSA) [20\u201322]. However, their study was not comprehensive and did not address the key factors that drive the binding of drug and serum albumin. Furthermore, the effect of HSA on the biological activity of the astilbin, such as antioxidant capacity, was also not characterized. In the present study, the lone intrinsic Tryptophan (Trp214) of HSA has served both as a solvatochromic fluorophore in fluorescence quenching measurements and as an energy donor in FRET experiments which, assisted by molecular modelling and free energy calculations, allowed it to establish the formation of a specific HSA\u2013astilbin complex and to provide information about the structure of this complex. Hence, the interaction of HSA with astilbin was investigated systematically at the molecular level under simulated physiological conditions. Multi-spectral methods including fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-Vis, micro-FTIR and circular dichroism spectra were employed to explore the binding mechanism of astilbin to HSA as well as the conformational changes of HSA. Meanwhile, the molecular docking technique was used to visualize the location, type of force and binding energy of drug small molecules and proteins in order to determine the binding mode of astilbin and HSA at the molecular level. Dynamics simulations were applied to evaluate the dynamics and stability of the astilbin\u2013HSA complex, and to corroborate the results obtained from spectroscopy studies. Moreover, considering the fact that oxidative stress plays an essential role in aging process [23], and astilbin exerts significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects against various autoimmune diseases [24]. The effect of HSA\u2013 astilbin interaction on the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical-scavenging activity of astilbin was also evaluated [25]. The neutralization DPPH test is based on donating electrons from the antioxidants in order to neutralize the DPPH radical, which has obvious advantages, such as ease of performing experiments, reproducibility and applicability at room temperature [26]. It can help to elucidate the binding mechanism of astilbin and HSA, and it may lay the foundation for the development of astilbin products that contribute to human health and food safety."

HSA can emit endogenous fluorescence due to the presence of amino acid residues. The fluorescence spectra of HSA in the presence of increasing concentrations of astilbin were recorded and are represented in Figure 1. HSA exhibited an intense emission peak at 327 nm upon excitation at 280 nm. The intensity of this peak decreased obviously with increasing concentration of astilbin, accompanying a slight red shift, indicating that astilbin reacted with HSA to produce a non-fluorescent complex, which caused the fluorescent group to quench, and the fluorescence intensity decreased gradually. Meanwhile, the microenvironment in which Trp and Tyr residues in HSA were located was changed by astilbin.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4487 3 of 19\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 19\ngradually.

Binding Constant and the Number of Binding Sites For the static quenching process, the binding constant and the number of binding sites for the HSA and astilbin interaction were obtained with the double logarithmic curve represented by the following equation [31]:\nlg(F0 \u2212 F) F = lgKa + nlg[Q]\u2044 (2)\nwhere Ka and n represent the binding constant and the number of binding sites; F0 and F denote the fluorescence intensities of HSA in the presence and absence of astilbin, respectively.

The corresponding binding constants of HSA\u2013astilbin system in three different temperatures were summarized in Table 2.

Circular Dichroism Spectra\nCD is a widely used means to study the conformational changes of HSA and to determine the number of \u03b1-helices [42]. HSA has two obvious negative characteristic peaks around 208 nm and 222 nm, which are typical of the \u03b1-helix structure, and these two peaks are contributed by \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 * and n\u2212\u03c0 * of \u03b1-helical peptide bonds, respectively [43]. The addition of astilbin significantly reduced the negative ellipticity of HSA at 208 nm and 222 nm, but the shape and position of the two peaks did not change significantly. It indicated that the addition of astilbin changed the secondary structure of HSA, but it was still dominated by the \u03b1-helical structure. \u03b1-helical structure content can be calculated by the following formula.\nMRE = \u03b8obs(mdeg)\n10\u00d7 cpnl (8)\n\u03b1\u2212 helix(%) = \u2212MRE208 \u2212 4000 33, 000\u2212 4000 \u00d7 100% (9)\nwhere MRE208 denotes the MRE value observed at 208 nm, Cp denotes the molar concentration of HSA, n denotes the number of residues of HSA (n = 585), l denotes the thickness of the cuvette, 4000 denotes the MRE value of \u03b2-sheet and random coil at 208 nm and 33,000 denotes the MRE value of \u03b1-helix at 208 nm. Figure 6D shows that the content of \u03b1-helix of astilbin\u2212HSA complex at the molar ratio of 5:1 decreased compared with free HSA. The results demonstrate that the interaction between astilbin and HSA resulted in the conformational change of HSA and affected the stability of the \u03b1-helix for the HSA and astilbin system."

The molecular docking technique can visualize the location of small drug molecules acting with proteins, the type of force and the binding energy, with good visibility of the stereospecific binding pattern. To recognize the putative binding location as well as the amino acid residues near the binding site, molecular docking studies of HSA with astilbin were carried out using AutoDock Vina. The optimal binding model of astilbin\u2013HSA is shown in Figure 7A. Astilbin tended to be bound to site I, which was consistent with the results of site competition experiments. This exhibited the lowest binding energy of\u22128.1 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121 (\u221233.91 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), which indicated the possibility of binding. Astilbin was inserted into the hydrophobic cavity at site I of HSA (Figure 7B).

However, at the region of binding site I, the RMSF values of the complexes in Figure 8B were mostly lower than those of free HSA, indicating that astilbin was bound stably to the binding site I of HSA and restricted the movement of residue backbone atoms to some extent. This suggested that hydrogen bonding forces and hydrophobic forces previously discussed played a key role in the stabilization of astilbin at the binding site and the stabilization of the surrounding amino acid residues.

Effect of HSA on the Antioxidant Capability of Astilbin Zhao [50] evaluated the antioxidant capacity of isolated astilbin, which are dihydroflavonol glycosides with antioxidant capacity. In this paper, the in vitro antioxidant capacity of astilbin was determined by the DPPH scavenging method, and the effect of HSA on the free radical scavenging capacity of astilbin was investigated. From Figure 9, the DPPH radical scavenging rate gradually increased with the higher concentration of astilbin. After mixing with HSA, although the DPPH radical scavenging rate also gradually increased with the increase of astilbin concentration., it decreased compared with the DPPH radical scavenging rate before mixing. Meanwhile, the astilbin showed potent antiradical activity (IC50 = 9.653 \u03bcg\u0387mL\u22121), while the astilbin\u2212HSA had an IC50 of 10.68 \u03bcg\u0387mL\u22121. This suggests that the interaction with HSA reduces the antioxidant capacity of astilbin.

An appropriate amount of the above sample solution was placed in a 1 mm cell size quartz cuvette and scanned on a 4207A000 CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, Surrey, UK). The scanning wavelength was set at 200~240 nm, the scanning speed was 100 nm\u00b7min\u22121 and the response time was 1 s. During the scanning, the sample compartment and optical path were continuously flushed with high purity nitrogen at 25 \u25e6C. The same concentration of drug solution was automatically deducted as blank background during the test."

The 3D structure of astilbin was downloaded from the PUBCHEM database and energy minimization was performed under the MMFF94 force field. The HSA structure (PDB code: 1H9Z, Resolution: 2.5 \u00c5) was obtained from the PDB database [51], and HSA was treated with PyMol 2.5 [52], including the removal of water molecules, salt ions and small molecules. The docking box was then set up to wrap the active site. In addition, ADFRsuite 1.0 [53] was used to convert the processed astilbin and HSA into the PDBQT formats. Docking was performed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 software [54], and the exhaustiveness of the global search was set to 32 and the rest of the parameters were kept at their default settings. The output docking conformation with the highest score was considered as the binding conformation, and finally the docking results were visualized and analyzed using PyMol 2.5 and Discovery studio viewer."

A water box was created and sodium ions were added to equilibrate the system. The energy for the maximum number of steps (50,000) was minimized by the steepest descent algorithm. The cut\u2212off distances of the Coulomb force and van der Waals interactions were both 1.4 nm. MD simulations were performed for 40 ns at standard atmospheric pressure and 300 K temperature simulations [55]. After the MD simulation, the periodic boundary removal process was performed to obtain parameters in series. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) were calculated by analyzing the trajectory files of the docked complex interaction (section for whole protein) [56]. Meanwhile, Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) and the number of hydrogen bonds were enumerated to obtain detailed structural changes in HSA by the astilbin."

Human serum albumin was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer, and astilbin and DPPH were dissolved in methanol and anhydrous ethanol to final concentrations of 1 g\u00b7L\u22121, 1 g\u00b7L\u22121, and 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M. All solutions were stored as stock solutions at 4 \u25e6C in the dark, and the DPPH solution was ready to use for 3\u22125 h. The sample of astilbin was diluted with methanol to 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121 separately, and then 2 mL of the diluted astilbin was mixed with an equal amount of DPPH solution. For the samples of DPPH and astilbin in the presence of HSA, the astilbin stock solution was first mixed with the HSA to the above concentrations, and then equal amounts of DPPH solution were added respectively. All solutions were gently shaken and mixed, and the reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 min protected from light. The maximum absorbance of DPPH at 521 nm was recorded using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shanghai Yuan analysis Instruments Co., Shanghai, China). A suitable blank was kept to eliminate the effect of ethanol on the absorbance determination. The scavenging activity of DPPH radicals was calculated according to the following equation [57].\nRadical scavening(%) = ( Acontrol \u2212Asample/Asample ) \u00d7 100 (10)\nwhere Acontrol is the absorbance of DPPH alone and Asample is the absorbance of DPPH with astilbin in the presence or absence of HSA.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4487 16 of 19"

            "text": "This study used multi-spectral techniques and molecular docking methods to elucidate the interaction of astilbin with the model transporter protein HSA under physiological conditions. The effect of binding on the antioxidant activity of astilbin was evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging assay. Spectroscopic analysis showed that astilbin could effectively quench the endogenous fluorescence of HSA through the static quenching mechanism, and the non-radiative energy transfer between the two was also a cause of fluorescence quenching. Astilbin and HSA prefer to bind at the site I position. The hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds are the main forces of the binding process. These results are also well supported by molecular docking studies. Multi-spectral methods and MD results indicate that the secondary structure of HSA could be changed because of the interaction of astilbin with HSA. In addition to micro-FTIR spectroscopy and circular dichroism illustrated that the \u03b1-helix content of HSA was reduced after binding. The antioxidant capacity of the HSA\u2013astilbin complex was reduced compared to that of free astilbin. The reason may be that some active sites of astilbin were encroached by HSA and the spatial site resistance was greater after binding. In conclusion, the findings of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between HSA and astilbin, which provides a theoretical basis for the in vivo transport and metabolism of astilbin and its effect on the structure of HSA, as well as a reference for the detection of the mode of action of other flavonoids with proteins. The finding of this study may provide a meaningful experimental and theoretical basis for the evaluation of astilbin\u2019s therapeutic potential and for future rational drug design studies.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27144487/s1, Figure S1: The Chemical structure of astilbin.
