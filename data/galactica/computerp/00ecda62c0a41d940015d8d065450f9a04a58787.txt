But the entire system maintains a dynamic balance, and the amount of charges will not accumulate infinitely. From the perspective of energy, sharp-wave ripples are the result of the energy
explosion. Therefore, a reasonable deduction is that the generation of sharp-wave ripples must be accompanied by a decrease in the amount of stored charge in the neuron population. It has also been found that the synchronous firing of CA1 inhibitory neurons can induce the generation of sharp-wave ripples [35]. This phenomenon can also be explained from the perspective of charge storage. If the CA1 area is regarded as a capacitor, it is assumed that its input from CA3 does not change but an external input enhances the firing of inhibitory neurons in the CA1 region. This leads to a decrease in the overall action potential firing rate in the CA1 region, resulting in an increase in stored charge. Sudden cessation of external input in the CA1 region will cause excitatory neurons to fire in bursts. By releasing excessive charge, sharp-wave ripples will be generated. Based on this mechanism, sharpwave ripples can also be induced by a sudden increase in external input, and this phenomenon has also been successfully observed in a computational model. 3. modeling results - Sharp-Wave Ripples
This paper examined sharp-wave ripples on a computational model of the
hippocampus. Please refer to supplementary materials for more details about the computational model. By simulating neuronal activity in the hippocampus over 4 s, we recorded the membrane potential of neurons in the CA1 region. Local field potentials were calculated based on membrane potentials. Energy density measurements are performed on the field potential to identify sharp ripple events. The result is shown in Figure 5. Sharp-wave ripples detected in computational models of the hippocampus. The blue curve is a sharp wave, which is obtained by bandpass the local field potential signal from 5 Hz to 20 Hz. The orange curve is the ripple, which is obtained by bandpass the field potential signal from 80 Hz to 180 Hz. The yellow horizontal line is the baseline, representing zero potential. - Trigger Sharp-Wave Ripples by Temporary Enhanced Input
The paradigms above provide a possible mechanism for the generation of sharp-wave
ripples from the perspective of neuron population charge. Based on this mechanism, a reasonable inference can be drawn: the disturbance brought by the input of the DG area disrupts the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the CA1 and CA3 areas, resulting in sharp-wave ripples. To test this hypothesis, the following experiments were performed in a computational model of the hippocampus. As shown in Figure 4, DGCA3-CA1 constitutes a tri-synaptic pathway. Activation of engram cells in the DG will lead to temporarily enhanced input of the Mossy pathway. This paper simulates the activation of engram cells in the DG region by artificially changing the input current intensity of the CA3 region. Through experiments, it was found that the temporary enhancement of the Mossy pathway can induce the generation of sharp-wave ripples. As shown in Figure 6, the drive current in the CA3 area is shown by the orange curve, and it will switch between 2.3ùë¢ùê¥~3ùë¢ùê¥ in a period of 1 second. The blue curve is the local field potential in the CA1 area. The blue line represents the local field potential of the CA1 region, and the orange line represents the input drive current of the CA3 region. The drive current fluctuates between 2.3~3 ùúáùê¥ with a period of 1s to simulate the temporary enhancement of DG input. As the input from the DG region switches between augmented and normal input on a
one-second cycle, the probability of sharp-ripple events in the CA1 region changes. In this paper, the activity of the hippocampal region was simulated for 4 s each time, and after 40 repetitions, the frequency of sharp-wave ripples in the CA1 region was detected. The results are shown in Figure 7, the occurrence frequency of sharp ripples in the enhanced input period is significantly higher than that in the normal input period. This result supports the hypothesis that temporarily enhanced input to the DG region can induce sharp-wave ripples. Another possibility is that the enhanced input itself causes more sharp-wave ripples. After experimenting with the computational model, it is found that the absolute value of the drive current does not determine the frequency of sharp ripples. The key factor is the step switch of the drive current. Stats graph and hypothesis testing proved that temporary enhancement of DG input can trigger sharpwave ripples in the CA1 area.

retrieval. Place cells fire in sequence to encode spatial memory. Previous studies show that
ripples, spindles, and slow waves will synchronously transform information between the
hippocampus and cortex. The engram cell theory was first proposed by Semon, and Tonegawa further developed
this theory, which was supported by experimental evidence at three levels: observation,
loss of function, and gain of function. The long-term enhancement theory has revealed the
neural mechanism of memory and learning at the cellular level. Engram formation is
dependent on long-term potentiation, an increase in dendritic spines, and an increase in
cellular excitability. Multiple brain regions are involved in this process, including the
hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and basolateral amygdala. Various regions
complete this process through cooperation and produce a joint effect. However, there are
still many questions to be answered. Questions for further research include how to achieve
retrieval, consolidation, and representation of different memories in a unified system. At
the same time, we also need to explore the information exchange mode of engram cells in
different brain regions and understand the role of engram cells in different types of memory. To better study these topics, we need more advanced neural recording technology and more
refined neural manipulation methods. Future studies will use higher temporal and spatial
resolution methods to explore the changes of engram cells during learning and the
formation of different types of memories. Like wave-particle duality, static engram cells and dynamic sequential firing should
be regarded as two representations of the same memory system. If the engram cell theory
is regarded as a static memory mark, the sharp-wave ripples and the accompanying
sequential replay can be regarded as a dynamic representation with highly temporal
characteristics. The main research on the replay phenomenon has focused on spatial
memory, while the research on engram cells has focused on episodic memory. But this
paper thinks that these two forms should be equivalent and have a causal relationship. This paper analyzed the generation mechanism of sharp-wave ripples from the
perspective of computational neuroscience. Combining the charge perspective and the self-
feedback mechanism, the possible reasons for the sharp-wave ripples are expounded. Based
on this mechanism, this paper proposes the hypothesis that the activation of engram cells
can induce sharp wave ripples, and has been verified in a computational model. In addition,
this hypothesis can be verified by observing the engram and sequence firing at the same
time. The verification experiment needs to be conducted by other researchers. At the model
level, I hope to answer the following questions: 1) Different engram cells correspond to
different memories, how to make different engram cells activate different sequence replays
in the model? 2) How to add new memory engrams to the existing network model? 3) How
do old engrams affect the representation of new engrams in the hippocampus? supplementary materials The temporal dynamics of neurons are described by the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model.

Connections within neuronal populations and between CA1 and CA3 are described
probabilistically. It can be divided into two types: one is the connection probability that is inversely proportional to the distance (as shown in Equation 1-5), and the other is the uniform connection probability that is independent of distance. The projections of CA3 inhibitory neurons are distance-independent uniform projections, and the others are distance-dependent connection probabilities. See the attached Table 3 for specific parameters.
