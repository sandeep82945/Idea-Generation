"The results may be the basis for the development of tailored EPS-producing starter cultures for food fermentations, as well as technologies for the production of EPS for vari- 1. introduction The ability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to ferment the rich variety of carbohydrates in food raw-materials determines their key role in the food industry for the production of a variety of fermented products of plant and animal origin [1â€“7]."

"These implications stress the importance of also exploring the mechanisms leading to EPS production by lactic acid bacteria in different food matrices."
