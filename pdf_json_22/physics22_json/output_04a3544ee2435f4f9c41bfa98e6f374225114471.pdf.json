The equation represents the condition j = 0, where j is a flux. Since an analogous equation for passive Brownian particles is first-order, a second- and third-order term are features of active motion.

INTRODUCTION\nEven for the case of an ideal-gas of active particles, exact expressions of stationary distributions remain sparse. One way potentially to advance our understanding of this problem is to try to represent stationary distributions through a differential equation. The structure of such an equation can shed light on the problem and point toward a possible resolution. It could also play a classifying role and be used to relate active particles to other physical systems or, in a more mathematical sense, to other systems of differential equations.\nIn this work, we obtain a third-order linear differential equation for stationary distributions of run-and-tumble particles in two dimensions in a harmonic trap [1\u201315]. No exact distributions are known for this system. The terms of an equation represent flux j, and the equation itself represents the condition j = 0. In comparison, an equivalent equation for passive Brownian particles is of first order, where the firstorder term comes from diffusion. The second- and third-order terms, therefore, are features of active motion.\nThird-order differential equations are less commonly encountered in physics than second-order ones [16], and so are the methods to solve them [17,18]. This property can, at least partially, explain some of the difficulties in obtaining exact solutions.\nActive particles are formulated and fully described by the Fokker-Planck equation, the solution of which is the distribution \u03c1 in a phase space. For two dimensions and in a steady state, this distribution is a function of the particle position and the orientation of a swimming direction, \u03c1 \u2261 \u03c1(r, \u03b8 ). In this work, however, we are interested in constructing the differential equation for the distribution p as a function of a position only, p \u2261 p(r), related to the distribution \u03c1 as p = \u222b d\u03b8 \u03c1.

Consequently, a considerable part of this work is devoted to the development of a method for constructing such an equation.\nSelf-propelled particles in a harmonic trap have been the subject of study in numerous papers. To highlight some more recent advancements, in [15] the authors obtained an exact series solution for a stationary distribution of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a harmonic trap in two dimensions. More recently, an expression for the entropy production rate has been obtained for the run-and-tumble particle model (RTP) in [12\u201314]. The dynamics of self-propelled particles in harmonic confinement were considered in [4,8].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we consider the RTP model in one dimension (1D). Given that exact results in 1D are more accessible, the expressions of this section constitute a reference framework for systems in higher dimensions. In Sec. III A, we consider the RTP model in two dimensions in a harmonic potential in the direction along the x-axis, u = Kx2/2. A differential equation for p is obtained together with the solution in the form of a convolution of two distributions. In Sec. III B, we then consider a harmonic trap with isotropic symmetry, for which a differential equation for p is obtained together with a solution. In Sec. IV, we consider a harmonic trap in three dimensions. In this dimension, a simple differential equation for p is no longer possible. Some analysis is carried out to understand why this is so. In Sec. V, the results are consolidated and discussed. The work is concluded with Sec. VI.\nII. SETTING UP THE STAGE: THE RTP MODEL IN ONE DIMENSION\nIn the RTP model, particles, in addition to undergoing diffusion, move with a velocity of constant magnitude v0 and an orientation that is evolving in time. New orientations are assigned at discrete time intervals drawn from exponential distribution whose average value \u03c4 represents the persistence time. Because in one dimension there are two directions, the Fokker-Planck equation (FP) can be represented as a system\n2470-0045/2022/106(2)/024121(11) 024121-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nof two coupled differential equations [1,2,19\u201324],\np\u0307+ = \u2212v0 p\u2032+ + Dp\u2032\u2032+ \u2212 1\n2\n1 \u03c4 (p+ \u2212 p\u2212),\np\u0307\u2212 = v0 p\u2032\u2212 + Dp\u2032\u2032\u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n1 \u03c4 (p\u2212 \u2212 p+), (1)\nwhere p+(x, t ) and p\u2212(x, t ) are the distribution for particles with a forward and backward swimming direction, respectively. The first two terms in each equation are contributions of the flux j\u00b1 = \u2212Dp\u2032\u00b1 \u00b1 v0, where D is the diffusion constant. The last term in each equation gives rise to active motion and represents a conversion of particles with one drift direction into particles with another drift direction. The conversion occurs with the rate 1/\u03c4 .\nThe two equations in Sec. 1 can be combined into a single differential equation for the total distribution p = p+ + p\u2212. The procedure outlined in Appendix B leads to the following result:\n\u2202 \u2202t [p \u2212 2D\u03c4 p\u2032\u2032] + \u03c4 \u2202\n2 p\n\u2202t2 = \u2212 j\u2032, (2)\nwhere the flux j = j+ + j\u2212 on the right-hand side is given by j = \u2212(D + \u03c4v20)p\u2032 + \u03c4D2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (3)\nCompared with the equivalent equation for passive Brownian particles governed by p\u0307 = Dp\u2032\u2032, the first striking difference is a more complex time dependence that involves a second-order time derivative, the signature of ballistic motion. This term is proportional to the persistence time \u03c4 . Furthermore, the terms that are first-order in time involve p and p\u2032\u2032.\nTurning next to the expression of flux in Eq. (3), we find that it is modified in two ways. The first change is the enhanced diffusion constant Deff = D + \u03c4v20 . The second and more significant modification is the emergence of a thirdorder term that has no counterpart in passive Brownian motion and as such can be regarded as a signature of active motion. Note that in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0, when the drift direction changes extremely fast, active motion becomes negligible and Eq. (2) recovers the standard diffusion equation.\nAt a steady state, the total flux vanishes, j = 0, resulting in the following equation:\n0 = \u2212(D + \u03c4v20)p\u2032 + \u03c4D2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (4) A stationary distribution p is then a solution to a third-order\ndifferential equation. For particles confined between two walls at x = \u00b1h, to solve Eq. (4) we need the following boundary conditions:\n0 = p\u2032(0), 0 = \u2212v20 p(\u00b1h) + D2 p\u2032\u2032(\u00b1h). (5)\nThe first condition ensures that p is symmetric around x = 0, and the second one ensures that the fluxes j\u00b1 = \u2212Dp\u2032 \u00b1 v0 vanish separately at the walls. (In contrast to j, the constituent fluxes j+ and j\u2212 are not required to vanish everywhere in the interval. This gives rise to internal currents responsible for the nonzero entropy production rate [14,21].) The solution to Eq. (4) turns out to have a simple functional form: p(x) = a + b cosh(kx) [21,23].\nA. Harmonic potential\nFor the case of a harmonic confinement, represented by the potential u(x) = Kx2/2, the two coupled FP equations for the RTP model in one dimension are\np\u0307+ = [(\u03bcKx \u2212 v0)p+]\u2032 + Dp\u2032\u2032+ \u2212 1\n2\n1 \u03c4 (p+ \u2212 p\u2212),\np\u0307\u2212 = [(\u03bcKx + v0 )p\u2212]\u2032 + Dp\u2032\u2032\u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n1 \u03c4 (p\u2212 \u2212 p+). (6)\nTo simplify the expressions, we define the timescales and lengthscales \u03c4k = 1\u03bcK , \u03bbk = v0\u03c4k, and from now on we work with dimensionless space and time variables z = x\n\u03bbk , s = t \u03c4k .\nThe dimensionless diffusion constant and the rate of orientational change are defined as B = D\u03c4k\n\u03bb2k and \u03b1 = \u03c4k \u03c4 . The two\nequations in (6) become\np\u0307+ = [(z \u2212 1)p+]\u2032 + Bp\u2032\u2032+ \u2212 \u03b1 2 (p+ \u2212 p\u2212), p\u0307\u2212 = [(z + 1 )p\u2212]\u2032 + Bp\u2032\u2032\u2212 \u2212 \u03b1\n2 (p\u2212 \u2212 p+). (7)\nCombining the two equations into a single differential equation, following the procedure in Appendix C, leads to\n\u2202 \u2202s [(\u03b1 \u2212 3)p \u2212 2zp\u2032 \u2212 2Bp\u2032\u2032] + \u2202\n2 p\n\u2202s2 = \u2212 j\u2032, (8)\nwith the flux given by\nj = \u2212(\u03b1 \u2212 2)zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 3B + B\u03b1)p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (9) Compared to passive particles, the stiffness parameter is renormalized as Keff = (\u03b1 \u2212 2)K . What is interesting is that for \u03b1 < 2 the stiffness becomes negative, causing particles to be repelled from the trap center rather than being attracted to it. For those values of \u03b1, the distribution is bimodal with two symmetric peaks shifted away from the center. If we interpret the coefficient of the first-order term as z-dependent effective diffusion, Beff = (1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 3B + B\u03b1), then there is |z| beyond which Beff is negative. Without the second- and third-order terms, the physical distribution does not exist beyond this point. Including these higher-order terms allows the distribution to extend beyond this point. The peak centers, however, remain confined into the region where Beff > 0. For \u03b1 > 2, the distribution p becomes unimodal with a single peak at z = 0.\nAt a steady state, j = 0 and a stationary distribution is obtained by solving\n0 = (2 \u2212 \u03b1)zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 3B + B\u03b1)p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (10)\nWe are next going to consider the solution p in two limiting situations: without thermal fluctuations (with active motion only), and without active motion (with thermal fluctuations only). At zero temperature (B = 0) and without thermal fluctuations, Eq. (10) reduces to a first-order differential equation:\n0 = (2 \u2212 \u03b1)zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2)p\u2032, (11) for which the solution is a beta distribution on the interval [\u22121, 1] [1,2,9,11]:\npb \u221d (1 \u2212 z2) \u03b12 \u22121, (12)\n024121-2\nwhere the subscript b indicates that p is represented by a beta distribution. An active motion becomes suppressed in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e as a result of rapid alternation of a swimming direction. Equation (10) in this situation reduces to\n0 = \u2212zp \u2212 Bp\u2032, (13) and the solution is given by the Boltzmann distribution\npg \u221d e\u2212z2/2B, (14) where we use the subscript g to indicate that p is represented by a Gaussian distribution.\nThere is no closed-form solution to Eq. (10) that we are aware of, but the solution can be expressed as a convolution of two limiting probability distributions discussed above, namely the beta distribution in Eq. (12) and the Boltzmann distribution [25]\np(z) \u221d \u222b 1\n\u22121 dz\u2032 (1 \u2212 z\u20322) \u03b12 \u22121e\u2212 (z\u2212z \u2032 )2 2B . (15)\nSee Appendix A for a derivation. Before delving into a physical interpretation of the mathematical form of the solution in Eq. (15), we briefly consider some of its mathematical aspects. Because in the limit B \u2192 0 the Gaussian function becomes a \u03b4 function, limB\u21920 e\u2212(z\u2212z\n\u2032 )2/2B \u221d \u03b4(z \u2212 z\u2032), the solution in Eq. (15) recovers the solution in Eq. (12). And because the beta distribution defined on the interval [\u22121, 1] in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e also becomes a \u03b4 function, lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e(1 \u2212 z\u20322) \u03b12 \u22121 \u221d \u03b4(z\u2032), the solution in Eq. (15) correctly recovers the Boltzmann distribution.\nNext we reflect on physical interpretation of the solution in Eq. (15). The convolution of two distributions arises for the process that involves a sum of two or more independent random variables. For example, if the random variables x [with the associated distribution px(x)] and y [with the associated distribution py(y)] are independent, then the distribution for the process z = x + y is pz(z) = \u222b dz\u2032 px(z\u2032)py(z\u2032 \u2212 z) =\u222b\ndz\u2032 py(z\u2032)px(z\u2032 \u2212 z). In light of this, the solution in Eq. (15), which can be represented as p = \u222b dz\u2032 pb(z\u2032)pg(z\u2032 \u2212 z), makes sense, as the two random processes\u2014thermal fluctuations and active motion\u2014are independent, and the distribution p that we are looking for is for the sum of those two processes.\nB. Other exact results\nIn this section, we briefly consider other exact results for the system at hand. These results will be useful when later we consider RTP particles in two dimensions.\nOne of the quantities that we are going to find useful in analyzing systems in higher dimensions is the even moments \u3008z2n\u3009 = \u222b 1\u22121 dz z2n p(z) for the zero-temperature limit. For the system in 1D we know that the distribution in this limit corresponds to a beta distribution in Eq. (12), and the moments can be calculated as\n\u3008z2n\u3009 = n\u220f\nm=1\n2m \u2212 1 2m \u2212 1 + \u03b1 , n = 1, 2, . . . . (16)\nAlternatively, the moments can be calculated directly from Eq. (11) by operating on it with the integral operator\n\u222b 1 \u22121 dz z 2n\u22121. This leads to the following iterative expression:\n\u3008z2n\u3009 = 2n \u2212 1 2n \u2212 1 + \u03b1 \u3008z 2n\u22122\u3009. (17)\nAnother limiting situation of interest is the case \u03b1 = 0, where Eq. (10) reduces to\n0 = 2zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 3B)p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (18) The solution for this case can be inferred from physical considerations. Since for \u03b1 = 0 swimming orientations do not evolve in time, each particle with its fixed orientation attains equilibrium. But because there are two swimming orientations, the system is a mixture of particles with different swimming orientations\u2014the case of quenched disorder [14,26]. Accordingly, a distribution is represented as a superposition of Boltzmann distributions of particles with different swimming orientations, in dimensionless units given by p(z) \u221d e\u2212 z22B e zB + e\u2212 z22B e\u2212 zB .\nIII. RTP MODEL IN 2D\nFor RTP particles in a harmonic trap in two or higher dimensions, the task of reducing the corresponding stationary FP equation into a single differential equation for the distribution p is more challenging. In 1D, things are simplified on account of there being only two discrete orientations. For higher dimensions, there are infinitely many orientations.\nA. Harmonic potential u = Kx2/2 In this section, we consider the RTP particles in 2D trapped in a harmonic potential of the form u(x) = Kx2/2. The system is effectively one-dimensional as it is translationally invariant along the y-axis. The swimming orientation is specified by the unit vector n = (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8 ), and the relevant distribution \u03c1(x, \u03b8, t ) is normalized as \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dx \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 \u03c1 = 1.\nThe stationary Fokker-Planck equation that determines the distribution \u03c1(x, \u03b8 ) in dimensionless units is given by\n0 = [(z \u2212 cos \u03b8 )\u03c1]\u2032 + B\u03c1 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1 ( \u03c1 \u2212 \u222b 2\u03c0\n0\nd\u03b8 2\u03c0 \u03c1\n) . (19)\nSee Appendix D for details. The procedure in Appendix C is not generalizable to continuous orientations, and so another procedure is required. We begin with the zero-temperature limit, or B = 0. Equation (19) in this case reduces to\n0 = z\u03c1 \u2032 + \u03c1 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u03c1 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c1 + \u03b1 2\u03c0 p, (20)\nwhere p = \u222b d\u03b8 \u03c1. We next use this equation to generate expressions for even moments \u3008z2n\u3009 = \u222b 1\u22121 dz \u222b 2\u03c00 d\u03b8 z2n\u03c1, in analogy to Eq. (17). For example, to obtain an expression for \u3008z2\u3009, we operate on Eq. (20) with the integral operator\u222b 1 \u22121 dz \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 z\n2. This yields \u3008z2\u3009 = \u3008z cos \u03b8\u3009. Then to obtain \u3008z cos \u03b8\u3009, we operate on Eq. (20) with \u222b 1\u22121 dz \u222b 2\u03c00 d\u03b8 z cos \u03b8 , which yields \u3008z cos \u03b8\u3009 = 1/2(1 + \u03b1), so that we can write\n\u3008z2\u3009 = 1 2 1 1 + \u03b1 .\n024121-3\nA similar procedure can be used to obtain \u3008z4\u3009 and any other moment. From the sequence of such moments, one can then infer a general formula\n\u3008z2n\u3009 = n\u220f\nk=1\n1\n2\n1\nn + \u03b1 , n = 1, 2, . . . (21)\nthat alternatively can be represented as an iterative relation given by\n\u3008z2n\u3009 = 1 2 2n \u2212 1 n + \u03b1 \u3008z 2n\u22122\u3009. (22)\nWe attempt next to infer a differential equation that generates such moments. The similarity between the result in Eq. (22) and that in Eq. (17) suggests that a differential equation ought to have a similar structure to Eq. (11). We determine that the following equation\n0 = (1 \u2212 2\u03b1)zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2)p\u2032 (23) generates the moments in Eq. (22). The solution is a beta distribution on the interval [\u22121, 1], similar to that in Eq. (12) but that scales differently with \u03b1,\np(z) \u221d (1 \u2212 z2)\u03b1\u2212 12 . (24) We next consider the case \u03b1 = 0, where the swimming orientations do not evolve in time, and because particles are confined, the system attains equilibrium. Yet because the system is a mixture of particles with different swimming orientations, it represents quenched disorder where a stationary distribution is a superposition of Boltzmann distributions of particles with different swimming orientations.\nFor a given orientation \u03b8 , a normalized Boltzmann distribution is\n\u03c1(x, \u03b8 ) = [\u221a \u03b2K\n2\u03c0 e \u2212 v\n2 0 cos 2 \u03b8 2\u03b2KD2 ] e\u2212 \u03b2Kx2 2 e v0x cos \u03b8 D . (25)\nIntegrating the above expression over all orientations yields the distribution p, which, in dimensionless units, becomes\np(z) \u221d e\u2212 z 2 2B \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 e\u2212 cos2 \u03b8 2B e z cos \u03b8 B . (26)\nWe are now in a situation in which we know the solution but do not have a differential equation that generates it. This constitutes an inverse problem to that for determining a solution from a known equation. We find that the following differential equation generates the solution of interest:\n0 = zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 2B)p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (27) The procedure used to infer this equation is described in Appendix E.\nAt this point we have two equations for two limiting situations, Eq. (23) for B = 0 and Eq. (27) for \u03b1 = 0. We combine the two equations in such a way as to avoid repetition of the same terms: zp and (z2 \u2212 1)p\u2032. The resulting equation still fails to recover 0 = \u2212zp \u2212 Bp\u2032 in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. This can be fixed by including an additional term, \u22122\u03b1Bp\u2032. Note that this is the only term that couples active and diffusive motion.\nThe complete third-order equation for stationary p is\n0 = (1 \u2212 2\u03b1)zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 2B + 2\u03b1B)p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (28) Note that Eq. (28) has the same structure as Eq. (10) for the true 1D system. In fact, the two equations can be scaled into each other if for every \u03b1 in Eq. (28) we substitute (\u03b1 \u2212 1)/2. This implies that the solution in Eq. (15) can be scaled to produce a solution to Eq. (28):\np(z; \u03b1) = p1D(z; 2\u03b1 + 1), (29) or more specifically\np(z) \u221d \u222b 1\n\u22121 dz\u2032 (1 \u2212 z\u20322)\u03b1\u2212 12 e\u2212 (z\u2212z \u2032 )2 2B . (30)\nThe differential equation in Eq. (28) and the solution in Eq. (30) are the main results of this section.\nTo verify Eq. (28), we compare p obtained from numerical evaluation of Eq. (30) with stationary distributions obtained from simulations. The results are plotted and compared in Fig. 1. The agreement between the two methods provides confirmation for the correctness of Eq. (28).\nNote that the differential equation in Eq. (28) and the corresponding solution in Eq. (30) simplify at a specific value of \u03b1c = 1/2. At this crossover value of \u03b1, the effective stiffness of a trap Keff = (2\u03b1 \u2212 1)K changes sign. As a consequence, the zero-order term in Eq. (28) vanishes, and the integral solution in Eq. (30) simplifies to yield\np(z) \u221d erf [\nz + 1\u221a 2B\n] \u2212 erf [ z \u2212 1\u221a\n2B\n] . (31)\nAt B = 0, the above distribution becomes a rectangular function. Then as B increases, it transforms into a normal distribution. A degree of flatness of this distribution can be quantified from the second derivative at z = 0, which is found to be p\u2032\u2032(0) \u221d 1/ \u221a B3e1/B and is plotted in Fig. 2. The distribution can be assumed to be flat if p\u2032\u2032(0) \u2248 0. This is the case for B 0.06; for larger B, p\u2032\u2032(0) exhibits a sharp increase.\nFigure 1(a) shows distributions before, at, and beyond the crossover \u03b1c. All the plots are for B = 0.05, where the distribution can be considered as flat at the crossover. Figure 1(b) shows distributions at a fixed \u03b1, below the crossover value, for different values of B. For B = 0.5, thermal fluctuations destroy the bimodal structure of a distribution.\n024121-4\nB. Harmonic potential u = Kr2/2 We next consider RTP particles (in 2D) in a harmonic trap with circular symmetry, u(r) = Kr2/2. The stationary Fokker-Planck equation that determines the distribution \u03c1(z, \u03b8 ) in this case is\n0 = z\u03c1 \u2032 + 2\u03c1 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u03c1 \u2032 + sin \u03b8 z \u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03b8\n+ B [ \u03c1 \u2032\u2032 + \u03c1 \u2032\nz + 1 z2 \u22022\u03c1 \u2202\u03b82\n] \u2212 \u03b1 ( \u03c1 \u2212 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 \u03c1 ) , (32)\nwhere z = r/\u03bbk . In this scenario, \u03b8 represents a relative angle between the swimming orientation and the angular position of a particle in a trap. See Appendix D for details.\nAt zero temperature, or B = 0, the stationary distribution \u03c1 is governed by\n0 = z\u03c1 \u2032 + 2\u03c1 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u03c1 \u2032 + sin \u03b8 z \u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c1 + \u03b1 2\u03c0 p, (33) where p = \u222b 2\u03c00 d\u03b8 \u03c1. By operating on the above equation with integral operators of the form 2\u03c0 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 \u222b 1 0 dz z\n2n+1\u03c1, we can calculate the moments \u3008z2n\u3009. For example, to obtain \u3008z2\u3009 = 2\u03c0 \u222b 2\u03c00 d\u03b8 \u222b 10 dz z3\u03c1, we operate on Eq. (33) with 2\u03c0 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 \u222b 1 0 dz z\n3. This yields \u3008z2\u3009 = \u3008z cos \u03b8\u3009. Then to calculate \u3008z cos \u03b8\u3009, we operate on Eq. (33) with 2\u03c0 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 \u222b 1 0 dz z 2 cos \u03b8 . This leads to\n\u3008z2\u3009 = 1 1 + \u03b1 .\nA similar procedure can be used to calculate higher moments, from which it is possible to infer the following general expression:\n\u3008z2n\u3009 = n\u220f\nm=1\nm\nm + \u03b1 , (34)\nalternatively expressed as an iterative relation\n\u3008z2n\u3009 = n n + \u03b1 \u3008z 2n\u22122\u3009. (35)\nThe first-order differential equation that generates such moments is\n0 = (2 \u2212 2\u03b1)zp + (z2 \u2212 1)p\u2032. (36) The solution of the above equation is a beta distribution on the interval [\u22121, 1], similar to that in Eqs. (12) and (24) but that scales differently with \u03b1,\np(z) \u221d (1 \u2212 z2)\u03b1\u22121. (37) We next consider the limiting case \u03b1 = 0. Because swimming orientations in this limit do not change in time, the confined RTP particles attain equilibrium, and because the system is a mixture of particles with different swimming orientations, it represents quenched disorder where a stationary distribution is a superposition of different Boltzmann distributions. For particles with swimming orientation \u03b8 , the normalized Boltzmann distribution is the same as that in Eq. (25) with x \u2192 r. Integrating this distribution over all orientations in dimensionless units yields\np(z) \u221d e\u2212 z 2 2B I0 ( z\nB\n) . (38)\nThe solution is the product of a Gaussian and modified Bessel function of the first kind. The third-order differential equation that generates this solution is determined to be\n0=2zp+ ( z2 \u2212 1 + 4B \u2212 B 2\nz2\n) p\u2032+ ( B2\nz2 + 2B\n) zp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032.\n(39) See Appendix E for details.\nTo obtain the complete equation, Eqs. (36) and (39) are combined taking care that the similar terms are not repeated. To ensure the correct behavior in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, we add the term \u22122\u03b1Bp\u2032. The complete equation becomes\n0 = 2(1 \u2212 \u03b1)zp \u2212 ( 1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 4B + 2\u03b1B + B 2\nz2\n) p\u2032\n+ ( 2B + B 2\nz2\n) zp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (40)\nUsing previously gained insights, it is expected that the solution to the above equation can be represented as a convolution of the beta solution in Eq. (37) and the Gaussian distribution. If we consider that the convolution is done in 2D space, this leads to the following result:\np \u221d \u222b 1\n0 dz\u2032 (1 \u2212 z\u20322)\u03b1\u22121e\u2212 (z\n\u2032\u2212z)2 2B [ z\u2032e\u2212zz \u2032/BI0 ( zz\u2032\nB\n)] , (41)\nwhere I0(x) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. See Appendix A for details.\nEquation (40) together with the solution in Eq. (41) are the main results of this section. To verify Eq. (40), in Fig. 3 we compare p obtained from evaluating Eq. (41) with the simulated data points. The agreement is exact apart from statistical noise.\nAt the crossover value of \u03b1, \u03b1c = 1, the zero-order term in Eq. (40) vanishes and the solution becomes\np(z) \u221d e\u2212 z 2 2B \u222b 1 0 dz\u2032 z\u2032e\u2212 z\u20322 2B I0 ( zz\u2032 B ) . (42)\n024121-5\nThe distribution becomes rectangular for B = 0, and with the onset of thermal fluctuations it approaches a normal distribution. Figure 4 shows how the second derivative of this distribution measured at z = 0 changes with B.\nFigure 3(a) plots the distribution at \u03b1c = 1 and two other distributions on both sides of the crossover. All distributions are for B = 0.05 when thermal fluctuations are still small. To demonstrate the effect of temperature, Fig. 3(b) shows the distributions for a fixed \u03b1, below the crossover value, for three different B."

            "text": "It turns out that in the case of the RTP model in 3D, it is no longer possible to obtain a simple differential equation for the stationary distribution p, at least within the methodology developed and used in the previous sections. The main obstacle seems to be the fact that it is not obvious how to infer a differential equation for the zero-temperature limit, or B = 0, from the moments.\nTo illustrate those difficulties, we consider a harmonic potential along the x-axis, u(x) = Kx2/2. The stationary FP equation is the same as that in Eq. (19). What is different is how the averaging over a swimming orientation is evaluated:\np(z) = \u222b \u03c0\n0 d\u03b8 sin \u03b8 \u03c1(z, \u03b8 ). (43)\nThis apparently trivial modification in actuality turns out to complicate things. Recall that for the system in 2D and\nfor the same potential, the averaging is done as p(z) =\u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 \u03c1(z, \u03b8 ).\nAt zero temperature or B = 0, the stationary FP equation becomes\n0 = z\u03c1 \u2032 + \u03c1 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u03c1 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c1 + \u03b1 2 p.\nThe moments generated by this equation are determined to be\n\u3008z2n\u3009 = \u03b1 n\u22121\u2211 k=0 (2n \u2212 1)! 2n + 1 \u2212 2k \u3008z2k\u3009 (2k)! 2n\u22121\u220f m=2k 1 m + \u03b1 , (44)\nno longer a simple expression such as that for two dimensions. Compare this expression with that in Eq. (22). To infer from those moments the first-order differential equation that generates them is no longer straightforward, and, at least at this moment, we have no workable methodology to attain this goal.\nWe may try to get some insights by considering the limit \u03b1 = 0, which is the case of quenched disorder. The distribution for a given drift orientation has a Boltzmann form given in Eq. (25). When integrated over all orientations,\u222b \u03c0\n0 d\u03b8 sin \u03b8 \u03c1(x, \u03b8 ), in reduced units it becomes\np(z) \u221d erf [\nz + 1\u221a 2B\n] \u2212 erf [ z \u2212 1\u221a\n2B\n] . (45)\nThe third-order differential equation that generates such a solution is found to be\n0 = \u2212[1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 B]p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (46) Note the absence of the zero-order term.\nWe return now to the case B = 0 for which we propose the following ansatz differential equation:\n0 = \u2212\u03b1zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2)p\u2032 \u2212 [ p M\u2211\nn=0 bnz\n2n ]\u2032 . (47)\nThe coefficients bn and their number M still must be determined. Combining the ansatz with Eq. (46) and adding the term \u2212\u03b1Bp\u2032 to ensure correct behavior in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, the complete equation becomes\n0 = \u2212 ( \u03b1 + 2 M\u2211\nn=0 bnnz\n2n\u22122 )\nzp\n\u2212 ( 1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 B + \u03b1B + M\u2211\nn=0 bnz\n2n ) p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032.\n(48)\nWhat we know about the coefficients bn is that in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0 they vanish if we are to have an agreement with Eq. (46). We also know that in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e they go to a finite value to ensure convergence to passive Brownian particle behavior.\nFinally, since for B = 0 the effective diffusion constant, defined as Deff = 1 \u2212 z2 + \u2211M n=0 bnz\n2n, should vanish at z = 1 to prevent particles from existing beyond z > 0, this suggests\n024121-6"

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\nTable I summarizes the main results of this work: thirdorder equations for the flux j for RTP particles in a harmonic trap. The stationary distributions are obtained from the condition j = 0 together with the boundary conditions\np\u2032(0) = 0, p(\u00b1\u221e) = 0. (50)\nThe first condition ensures the symmetry of p around z = 0, and the second condition ensures that p vanishes far from the trap center. The normalization constraint of p fully defines the solution. The normalization for 1D and 2DL is \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dz p(z) =\n1 and for 2D it is 2\u03c0 \u222b \u221e\n0 dz zp(z) = 1. In the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, where the swimming orientation changes rapidly, all equations become dominated by the terms that are linear in \u03b1 and reduce to j = \u2212zp \u2212 Bp\u2032, a system of passive Brownian particles in a harmonic trap.\nThird-order equations in Table I do not lend themselves to a closed-form solution, but the solutions can be represented as a convolution of the beta and Gaussian distributions as listed in Table II. Such a form of the solution is intuitively accurate and represents a sum of two independent random processes: thermal fluctuations and active motion. This separation, however, should not be regarded as universal. Most likely, it is a feature of a harmonic trap.\nTABLE II. Solutions to the third-order equations in Table I for j = 0."

Without thermal fluctuations, or B = 0, all equations reduce to first-order, for which a solution is readily available as indicated in Table III. The onset of thermal fluctuations gives rise to second- and third-order terms.\nThe solutions in Table III are beta distributions with different \u03b1 scaling. In each case, the crossover \u03b1c, the point where the distribution changes from concave to convex, is different. The cases 1D and 2DL are \u201ceffectively\u201d one-dimensional. The difference between these two cases comes from the distribution of swimming velocities. For the 1D case, the swimming velocities are discrete, v = \u00b1v0, and for the 2DL case they are continuously distributed in the interval v \u2208 [\u2212v0, v0] (only the x-projection of the swimming velocities is relevant). As a result, the swimming velocities at any time are smaller than v0, and particles push less against the harmonic potential. This should result in a less concave distribution for the same value of \u03b1 compared to the 1D case. This is what is observed. This also explains why the crossover for 2DL occurs at \u03b1c = 1/2 while that for 1D occurs at \u03b1c = 2.\nWe next compare the 1D and 2D cases. First we note that for \u03b1 = 0 the distributions are the same. This happens because for \u03b1 = 0 swimming orientations do not change in time and so \u03b8r = \u03b8 , where \u03b8r is the angular position of a particle in the trap, and \u03b8 is the swimming orientation. For finite \u03b1, however, it is expected that \u03b8r = \u03b8 . This in turn results in the velocity component projected onto the direction \u03b8r being less than v0, or v0 cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8r ) v0.\nAs the higher-order terms do not vanish in the limit \u03b1 = 0, see Table IV, these terms need not necessarily be attributed to some property of nonequilibrium. Since a system at \u03b1 = 0 represents equilibrium with quenched disorder, higher-order terms can be interpreted as arising from disorder due to different swimming orientations. All equations can be written as a combination of two equations representing different limits. Taking the 1D case as an example, we have\n0 = {2zp \u2212 [1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 3B]p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032} +\u03b1{\u2212zp \u2212 Bp\u2032}. (51)"

            "text": "In this work, we posit the problem of stationary distributions of active particles in a harmonic trap as a third-order linear homogenous differential equation. Using the procedure developed in this work, we were able to determine such an equation for RTP particles in 2D for different trap symmetries. We did not obtain an analogous differential equations for RTP particles in higher dimensions. Similar difficulties were encountered for the case of ABP particles in any dimension and for any symmetry of a trap. In none of those cases was it possible to infer a differential equation from even moments \u3008z2\u3009. More fundamental causes of why a simple differential equation is possible for RTP particles in 2D and not for other cases remains to be better understood.\nIn addition to formulating the problem as a third-order equation, we obtain solutions in the form of a convolution of two probability distributions. This is a reflection of the fact that the two random processes, namely thermal fluctuations and active motion, are independent and the total distribution is for a sum of those two processes. Retrospectively, such an explanation is intuitively correct. On the other hand, we should not expect that it applies to other types of external potentials.\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."

The above equation is transformed by the application of a twosided Laplace transform [25]:\np\u0302 = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e dz e\u2212sz p, (A1)\nleading to\n0 = (1 + B + B\u03b1 \u2212 B2s2)sp\u0302 + (2Bs2 \u2212 \u03b1) p\u0302\u2032 \u2212 sp\u0302\u2032\u2032. (A2) If the transformed solution can be represented as p\u0302(s) = K\u03b1 (s)KB(s), where K\u03b1 (s) depends only on the parameter \u03b1, and KB(s) depends only on the parameter B, then\nK\u03b1 (s)KB(s) = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e dz e\u2212sz p(z), (A3)\nwhich implies that p is the convolution of the inverse transforms of K\u03b1 (s) and KB(s):\np(z) \u221d \u222b 1\n\u22121 dz\u2032 K\u22121\u03b1 (z \u2032)K\u22121B (z \u2212 z\u2032). (A4)\nOur next task is to determine the functions of K\u03b1 and KB. To find K\u03b1 , we set B = 0 so that Eq. (A2) reduces to\n0 = sp\u0302 \u2212 \u03b1 p\u0302\u2032 \u2212 sp\u0302\u2032\u2032. (A5) But since we know that the distribution p(z) in this case is p = (1 \u2212 z2) \u03b12 \u22121, the solution to Eq.

Examining Eq. (A7), we identify this to be \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, where (1 \u2212 z2) \u03b12 \u22121 becomes a \u03b4 function and K\u03b1 reduces to a constant. Equation (A2) for this limiting situation reduces to\n0 = Bsp\u0302 \u2212 p\u0302\u2032, (A8) where the solution is p\u0302 = eBs2/2.

This procedure transforms the two equations into\np\u0307 = \u2212v0\u03c3 \u2032 + Dp\u2032\u2032, \u03c3\u0307 = \u2212v0 p\u2032 + D\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03c3\n\u03c4 , (B1)\nwhere \u03c3 = p+ \u2212 p\u2212. The first equation in (B1) is used to obtain a number of expressions for derivatives of \u03c3 in terms of p and its derivatives:\nv0\u03c3 \u2032 = Dp\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p\u0307, v0\u03c3 \u2032\u2032\u2032 = Dp\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p\u0307\u2032\u2032, v0\u03c3\u0307 \u2032 = Dp\u0307\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p\u0308. (B2)\nBy differentiating the second equation in (B1) with respect to x, we get\n\u03c3\u0307 \u2032 = \u2212v0 p\u2032\u2032 + D\u03c3 \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032\n\u03c4 . (B3)\nThe expressions in (B2) are then used to eliminate all terms with \u03c3 : p\u0307 \u2212 2\u03c4Dp\u0307\u2032\u2032 + \u03c4 p\u0308 = (D + \u03c4v20 )p\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03c4D2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032.

The first equation in (C1) is used to obtain a number of expressions for different derivatives of \u03c3 in terms of p and its derivatives:\n\u03c3 \u2032 = zp\u2032 + Bp\u2032\u2032 + p \u2212 p\u0307, \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 = zp\u2032\u2032 + Bp\u2032\u2032\u2032 + 2p\u2032 \u2212 p\u0307\u2032, \u03c3 \u2032\u2032\u2032 = p\u2032\u2032 + zp\u2032\u2032\u2032 + Bp\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 + 2p\u2032\u2032 \u2212 p\u0307\u2032\u2032, \u03c3\u0307 \u2032 = z p\u0307\u2032 + Bp\u0307\u2032\u2032 + p\u0307 \u2212 p\u0308. (C2)\nNext, we differentiate the second equation in (C1) with respect to z: \u03c3\u0307 \u2032 = \u03c3 \u2032 + z\u03c3 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 p\u2032\u2032 + B\u03c3 \u2032\u2032\u2032 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03c3 \u2032. (C3) The terms involving \u03c3 are next eliminated using the expressions in (C2):\n(\u03b1 \u2212 3) p\u0307 \u2212 2z p\u0307\u2032 \u2212 2Bp\u0307\u2032\u2032 + p\u0308 = (\u03b1 \u2212 2)p \u2212 (4 \u2212 \u03b1)zp\u2032 \u2212 (z2 \u2212 1 + 5B \u2212 B\u03b1)p\u2032\u2032\n\u2212 2Bzp\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032. To convert the right-hand side (rhs) of the equation to conform with the expression \u2212 j\u2032, we rewrite it as\nrhs = \u2212(2 \u2212 \u03b1)p \u2212 (2 \u2212 \u03b1)zp\u2032 \u2212 2zp\u2032 \u2212 (\u22121 + 3B \u2212 B\u03b1)p\u2032\u2032 \u2212 z2 p\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2Bp\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2Bzp\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032.

(19) AND (32)\nThe FP equation for the RTP model in 2D subject to an external force F is\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 [(\u03bcF + v0n)\u03c1] + D\u22072\u03c1 \u2212 1 \u03c4\n( \u03c1 \u2212 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 \u03c1 ) .\n(D1) For F = \u2212exKx and at steady-state \u03c1 \u2261 \u03c1(x, \u03b8 ), and the FP equation becomes\n0= \u2202 \u2202x [(\u03bcKx \u2212 v0 cos \u03b8 )\u03c1]+D\u2202 2\u03c1 \u2202x2 \u2212 1 \u03c4\n( \u03c1 \u2212 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 \u03c1 ) .\n(D2) Using dimensionless units, this recovers Eq. (19).\nIn the case of an isotropic force F = \u2212Kr, at steady-state the FP equation becomes\n0 = \u03bcKr \u00b7 \u2207\u03c1 + \u03bcK\u03c1(\u2207 \u00b7 r) \u2212 v0\u2207 \u00b7 n\u03c1\n+ D\u22072\u03c1 \u2212 1 \u03c4\n( \u03c1 \u2212 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 \u03c1 ) . (D3)\nThe stationary \u03c1 should be a function of the position of a particle in a trap. In polar coordinates this includes r and \u03b8r , and the swimming orientation \u03b8 . Actually, the only relevant angular dependence is the difference \u03b8r \u2212 \u03b8 . This allows us to represent a stationary \u03c1 as a function of two variables. From now on we use \u03b8 to designate the difference \u03b8r \u2212 \u03b8 .\nFor convenience, we fix the swimming orientation n along the x-axis, n = ex. The resulting equation becomes\n0 = \u03bcKr \u00b7 \u2207\u03c1 + \u03bcK\u03c1(\u2207 \u00b7 r) \u2212 v0 \u2202\u03c1 \u2202x\n+ D\u22072\u03c1 \u2212 1 \u03c4\n( \u03c1 \u2212 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 \u03c1 ) . (D4)\nIn polar coordinates, various terms are expressed as \u22072\u03c1 = \u22022\u03c1\n\u2202r2 + 1r \u2202\u03c1\u2202r + 1r2 \u2202 2\u03c1 \u2202\u03b82 , \u2202\u03c1 \u2202x = cos \u03b8 \u2202\u03c1\u2202r \u2212 sin \u03b8r \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03b8 , r \u00b7 \u2207\u03c1 =\n024121-9\nr \u2202\u03c1 \u2202r , \u2207 \u00b7 r = 2. Substituting those expressions in the above equation leads to\n0 = \u03bcKr \u2202\u03c1 \u2202r + 2\u03bcK\u03c1 \u2212 v0 cos \u03b8 \u2202\u03c1 \u2202r + v0 sin \u03b8 r \u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03b8\n+ D [ \u22022\u03c1\n\u2202r2 + 1 r \u2202\u03c1 \u2202r + 1 r2 \u22022\u03c1 \u2202\u03b82\n] \u2212 1\n\u03c4\n( \u03c1 \u2212 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 \u03c1 ) .\n(D5)\nUsing dimensionless units, this recovers Eq.

            "text": "In this Appendix, we outline a procedure for inferring an equation from a solution. The procedure is used to obtain Eqs. (27) and (39) from the solution\np(z) \u221d e\u2212 z 2 2B \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b8 e\u2212 cos2 \u03b8 2B e z cos \u03b8 B , (E1)\nwhich first appears in Eq. (26), and p(z) \u221d e\u2212z2/2B I0(z/B), (E2) which appears in Eq. (38). As both functions are even, their Taylor expansion\np(z) = p(0)(0) + z 2 2 p(2)(0) + z 4 4! p(4)(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nWe next propose the following ansatz for an unknown thirdorder equation:\n0 = (c11 + c21z2 + c31z4)zp + (c12 + c22z2 + c32z4)p\u2032 + (c13 + c23z2 + c33z4)zp\u2032\u2032 + (c14 + c24z2 + c34z4)p\u2032\u2032\u2032. (E3)\nNote that the ansatz does not introduce mixed even and odd terms. This is to ensure that the symmetry of p is preserved.\nThe coefficients ci j are determined from a truncated expansion of p, for example\nptr = p(0) + z 2 2 p(2) + z 4 4! p(4) + z 6 6! p(6),\nwhere p(0) = p(0), p(1) = p\u2032(0), etc. The number of terms in ptr depends on the number of parameters ci j . For example, for nine ci j , we should include at least nine terms in the truncated series (actually, eight is enough since we assume c11 = 1).\nIf the coefficients do not become altered by using ptr for a larger number of terms, it is assumed that the equation is complete. For the distribution in (E1), the nonzero coefficients are\nc11 = 1, c12 = 2B \u2212 1, c22 = 1, c13 = 2B, c14 = B2. (E4)\nThis suggests the following equation:\n0 = zp \u2212 (1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 2B)p\u2032 + 2Bzp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032, (E5) which can be verified to yield the solution in Eq. (E1).\nFor the distribution in (E2), the nonzero coefficients are\nc21 = 2, c12 = \u2212B2, c22 = 4B \u2212 1, c32 = 1, c13 = B2, c23 = 2B, c24 = B2, (E6)\nand after manipulation, the ansatz becomes\n0=2zp+ ( z2 \u2212 1+4B\u2212B 2\nz2\n) p\u2032+ ( B2\nz2 + 2B\n) zp\u2032\u2032 + B2 p\u2032\u2032\u2032.\n(E7)\n[1] J.
