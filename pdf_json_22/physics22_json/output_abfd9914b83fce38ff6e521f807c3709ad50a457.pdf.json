    "abstractText": "Superconducting quantum computing is experiencing a tremendous growth. Although major milestones have already been achieved, useful quantum-computing applications are hindered by a variety of decoherence phenomena. Decoherence due to two-level systems (TLSs) hosted by amorphous dielectric materials is ubiquitous in planar superconducting devices. We use high-quality quasilumped element resonators as quantum sensors to investigate TLS-induced loss and noise. We perform two-tone experiments with a probe and pump electric field; the pump is applied at different power levels and detunings. We measure and analyze time series of the quality factor and resonance frequency for very long time periods, up to 1000 h. We additionally carry out simulations based on the TLS interacting model in presence of a pump field. We find that loss and noise are reduced at medium and high power, matching the simulations, but not at low power.",

Although major milestones have already been achieved, useful quantum-computing applications are hindered by a variety of decoherence phenomena. Decoherence due to two-level systems (TLSs) hosted by amorphous dielectric materials is ubiquitous in planar superconducting devices. We use high-quality quasilumped element resonators as quantum sensors to investigate TLS-induced loss and noise. We perform two-tone experiments with a probe and pump electric field; the pump is applied at different power levels and detunings. We measure and analyze time series of the quality factor and resonance frequency for very long time periods, up to 1000 h. We additionally carry out simulations based on the TLS interacting model in presence of a pump field. We find that loss and noise are reduced at medium and high power, matching the simulations, but not at low power.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSuperconducting quantum circuits [1] are among the leading systems in the race to develop a quantum computer; other relevant examples include trapped atomic ions and neutral atoms [2]. Although exciting and potentially disruptive, applications such as quantum simulations require a daunting amount of resources and complex infrastructures [3]. In contrast, an immediate application of superconducting devices is to use a single quantum circuit as a sensor for loss and noise processes in dielectric and superconducting materials [4]. Understanding such dissipative phenomena, which lead to quantum decoherence, is of paramount importance to further scale up quantum computers.\nSuperconducting devices based, for instance, on aluminum (Al) or niobium thin films deposited on silicon (Si) or sapphire substrates can be readily fabricated as integrated circuits; important examples include the Xmon transmon qubit [5] and planar resonators [6]. Onchip integration, however, comes at a price: Almost any interface separating different fabrication layers is characterized by unwanted amorphous dielectric materials, such as native silicon oxide [7]. In fact, one of the main sources of decoherence is attributable to two-level systems (TLSs) embedded in oxide layers [8, 9]. Interestingly, deleterious TLS effects are also impactful in other quantum computing platforms, such as trapped ions [10] and optical cavities [11]. Therefore, these implementations can also benefit from the research presented here.\n\u2217 These two authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020 Corresponding author: matteo.mariantoni@uwaterloo.ca\nDefects in amorphous dielectric materials, such as trapped charges, dangling bonds, tunneling atoms, or collective motion of molecules, can be modeled as TLSs with energy E. We distinguish between quantum-TLSs (QTLSs), for which E > kBT , and thermal-TLSs (T-TLSs), for which E < kBT ; the typical operating temperature of our devices is T \u223c 50 mK and, thus, the energy threshold between Q- and T-TLSs is E/h \u223c 1 GHz [12].\nInteractions with TLSs reduce the coherence properties of superconducting quantum circuits, resulting in shorter energy relaxation times T1 for qubits and lower internal quality factors Qrint for resonators. It is well known that driving resonators electrically saturates TLSs, leading to a higher Qrint [9]; this can also be accomplished via an off-resonant drive [13\u201315]. The effect of TLSs is not limited to loss mechanisms but also leads to noise (i.e., time fluctuations) in Qrint and in the resonator resonance frequency fr [16\u201318]; qubits exhibit an equivalent behavior [12, 19\u201323]. Our main motivation is to gain a deeper insight into the physics of TLS-induced time fluctuations for much longer time periods and a wider range of parameters compared to these previous works.\nIn this paper, we conduct a fluctuation spectroscopy experiment with quasilumped element resonators based on planar capacitors and inductors. The resonators are characterized by Qrint \u223c 350000 when excited at low power. We perform a two-tone experiment by driving the resonators with a probe and pump electric field. The probe is used to measure fr and Q r int and is always set to low power. The pump is used to excite Q-TLSs and can take different power values Pp and resonator-pump detunings \u2206r,p. We investigate time fluctuations in the time series fr(t) and Q r int(t) for two resonators over a total observation time of 480 h; this time comprises four\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n07 44\n5v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 4\nM ar\n2 02\n2\n2 periods that are spread over one and a half months. Such a long measurement time allows us to accurately estimate the power spectral densities (PSDs) associated with the time series to frequencies as low as f = 5.8\u00d7 10\u22126 Hz.\nThe present work represents a significant departure from our previous study of Ref. [12]. There, we have investigated the T1 (equivalent to Q r int) spectrotemporal charts of an Xmon transmon qubit and compared them to detailed simulations based on the generalized tunneling model (GTM). Here, we add a pump, measure fr (which we could not measure with an Xmon qubit), and extend the time series to a much longer time. We compare our experimental findings to GTM simulations, accounting for these more general conditions.\nWe find that the simulations match the experimental time series and PSDs for both fr and Q r int when the pump is off. At low pump power, the loss and time fluctuations are not reduced compared to when the pump is off. In fact, in certain cases, we even observe a small increase in loss and fluctuations. This result slightly deviates from our simulations, which display a monotonic decrease in loss and fluctuations with increasing pump power. At medium and high power, as expected, loss and fluctuations are reduced both in experiments and simulations. Interestingly, for the same value of Pp but different \u2206r,p, we measure dissimilar time series and, often, even different noise levels. These asymmetries are not reproduced by the simulations. Finally, it is worth noting that we measure \u223c 1/f noise down to microhertz frequencies.\nRecent works have investigated time fluctuations in presence of a pump [17, 24, 25]. However, these authors only use a resonant pump and carry out measurements over short time periods, on the order of 3 h. Additionally, they only study the low and medium power regimes but not the pump off and high power regimes. Finally, they do not attempt to match their experimental results to any simulations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the models governing resonator\u2013Q-TLS and Q-TLS\u2013TTLS interactions. In Sec. III, we explain the methods used to perform experiments, simulations, and spectral analysis. In Sec. IV, we present our results. In Sec. V, we suggest a possible explanation of some of our findings and compare them to recent related works. Finally, in Sec. VI, we summarize our results and propose future research directions."

This model can be further simplified by assuming that the Q-TLSs interact with the resonator nonsimultaneously, thereby leading to a set of independent JaynesCummings Hamiltonians. Different regimes of the QTLS\u2013resonator system can be investigated by means of a classical driving field, or pump.\nThe pump is a monochromatic sinusoidal signal with voltage amplitude Vp and current amplitude Ip, frequency fp, and time-averaged power Pp = VpIp/2. In our physical system, we pump indirectly the Q-TLSs by driving the resonator (sympathetic driving). We can explore the on-resonance and off-resonance regimes by tuning fp as well as the high-power and low-power regimes by varying Pp. The pump Hamiltonian reads as\nH\u0302p = hJcos(2\u03c0fpt) ( a\u0302\u2020 + a\u0302 ) , (1)\nwhere J = \u221a\n\u03a6p\u0393rext/2 is the coupling coefficient between a quasi\u2013one-dimensional transmission line and the resonator (see Sec. III A for device details [26]), and a\u0302\u2020 and a\u0302 are the usual bosonic annihilation and creation operators of the resonator mode [27]; \u03a6p = Pp/hfp is the transmission line photon flux, and \u0393rext is the engineered, or external, energy relaxation rate of the resonator.\nIn addition to the engineered losses described by \u0393rext, the resonator suffers from internal dissipation processes. These processes, which are mainly due to conductive, radiative, and dielectric losses, are described by the internal decoherence rate \u0393rint. Among all types of dielectric losses, those strongly depending on Pp are predominantly caused by Q-TLSs. These losses are associated with an energy relaxation rate \u0393r,Q-TLSint , whereas all other losses are accounted for by \u0393\u0303rint. In the case of high quality resonators, such as those studied in this work, the resonator pure dephasing rate is negligible and, thus, \u0393rint is assumed to be an energy relaxation rate [28].\nThe rate \u0393r,Q-TLSint is given by the sum of partial decoherence rates, where each rate \u03bar,Q-TLSint is due to the interaction between one Q-TLS and the resonator. This interaction additionally leads to a shift \u03b4fr of the resonance frequency. Both \u03bar,Q-TLSint and \u03b4fr can be calculated by solving for the time evolution of a driven-dissipative Jaynes-Cummings interaction.

Under these conditions, the Lindblad operators are L\u0302r =\u221a \u0393rext a\u0302 and L\u0302 \u2212 Q-TLS = \u221a \u0393Q-TLS1 \u03c3\u0302 \u2212, where \u0393Q-TLS1 is the energy relaxation rate of the Q-TLS for T \u2192 0+; f\u0303Q-TLS = EQ-TLS/h is the unperturbed Q-TLS transition frequency.\nAfter solving the quantized Maxwell-Bloch equations in the stationary regime (see App. A), we find the 2- tuple (\u03bar,Q-TLSint , \u03b4fr). Such a tuple can be associated with the kth Q-TLS of an ensemble of Q-TLSs, (\u03bar,Q-TLSint \u2192 \u03bar,kint, \u03b4fr \u2192 \u03b4fr,k). Each Q-TLS is characterized by a coupling strength gk, energy relaxation rate \u0393 k 1 , and frequency fk(t).

The interaction with one T-TLS shifts f\u0303Q-TLS by \u03b4f\n\u2213, where the sign depends on the state |\u2213\u3009 of the T-TLS.

The quality factors are related to the energy relaxation rates by\n\u0393rint = 2\u03c0fr Qrint and \u0393rext = 2\u03c0fr Qrext .\nWe characterize each resonator over a wide range of Ppr (see Fig. 6). In the high-power regime, the resonator\u2013 Q-TLS interaction is largely suppressed due to Q-TLS saturation. This regime allows us to estimate the unperturbed parameters \u0393\u0303rint and f\u0303r in Eqs. (4a) and (4b). We estimate \u0393rext also in the high-power regime, although this rate should be power independent. In the low-power regime, energy relaxation is dominated by Q-TLS interactions. Sweeping Ppr between the two regimes makes it possible to evaluate the total energy relaxation rate of the resonator due to Q-TLSs at zero mean photon number (i.e., zero power) and zero temperature, \u0393r,Q-TLSint (\u3008n\u3009 = 0, T = 0 K) = \u03930Q-TLS. Additionally, an approximate value for the critical photon number nc, nc \u223c \u3008ns\u3009 (ns is defined in App. A), can be found. The results of this characterization are given in App. B; characterization parameters are reported in Table III. Notably, our Qrint are on the order of 350000 at low power, which is quite high for lumped-element resonators (e.g., significantly higher than in the work of Ref. [15])."

            "text": "Off-resonant pumping is implemented by linearly superposing the pump to the probe field. The pump (see Sec. II A) allows us to indirectly drive the Q-TLS distribution for a range of values of \u2206r,p and Pp. The probe is solely used to extract resonator parameters by measuring S21 (see Sec. III A). For all experiments, we use a fixed value of Ppr such that, when the pump is off (Pp = 0 dBm), \u3008n\u3009 \u223c nc.\nFigure 1 shows the characterization of R1 and R2 in presence of a pump field. Our measurements reproduce the results reported in the works of Refs. [13\u201315]. As in those works, we also find that the rate \u0393rint decreases with increasing Pp and with decreasing |\u2206r,p|. The frequency fr is pulled towards fp; the frequency shift magnitude |\u2206fr| depends on Pp, with the maximum shift occurring at an intermediate value of Pp.\nIn order to avoid interference effects between the pump and probe fields, fp must be outside the frequency bandwidth of the S21 resonator measurement. In our measurements, this bandwidth is at most approximately 0.7 MHz including normalization (i.e., calibration) points; thus, we choose the minimum detuning to be |\u2206r,p| = 1 MHz. In addition, we select the power of the microwave source used to generate the pump field, Pms, such that Pms \u2264 20 dBm for both resonators to remain below the 1-dB compression point of the amplification chain (see Sec. S3 of the Supplemental Material at [30] for more details on compression). Due to this constraint, we cannot reach complete Q-TLS saturation in the high-power regime of Fig. 1 (b).\nWe investigate stochastic fluctuations and pumping effects in the time series \u0393rint(t) and fr(t) by measuring each of the two resonators over four separate 120-h time periods. The time series data is acquired by cycling over different values of Pp and \u2206r,p with a period \u2206t = 520 s. Each resonator measurement is realized by configuring the VNA with an intermediate frequency bandwidth \u2206fIF = 1 Hz, 116 frequency points (including normalization points), and a measurement power of \u221230 dBm; this power corresponds to Ppr \u223c \u2212160 dBm at the sample. With these settings, each resonator measurement takes tmeas \u2248 103 s. The microwave source used to generate the pump field is set to be either off or on at one of four 2-tuple of parameters: (Pms [dBm],\u2206r,p [MHz]) \u2208 {(\u22123, 2), (\u22123,\u22122), (10, 2), (10,\u22122)}; we refer to the \u22123 dBm settings as low power and to the 10 dBm settings as medium power. The total attenuation between the source and the sample is A \u2248 89 dB; thus, Pp = Pms \u2212 A. Notably, in our experiments a detuning of 2 MHz is equivalent to approximately 100 resonator linewidths; a linewidth is the full width at half maximum of the resonator\u2019s Lorentzian curve."

Here, we expand the scope of that work by simulating not only stochastic time fluctuations in the energy relaxation rate (i.e., \u0393rint) but also in fr. Importantly, we also explore resonator pumping effects with different values of (Pms,\u2206r,p), therefore allowing us to test our GTMbased model under more general conditions.\nAs in Ref. [12], the procedure to simulate the effect of\nTLSs on the fluctuations in \u0393rint and fr comprises three steps: (I) Generate an ensemble of Q-TLSs interacting with the resonator. (II) Generate several T-TLSs interacting with each Q-TLS. (III) Generate a time series for each T-TLS and propagate the effect of the T-TLSs\u2019 switching state to each Q-TLS, and, finally, to the resonator. However, the simulation procedure has to be modified to account for the expanded scope of the present work and for the fact that we are studying resonators instead of a qubit.\nIn step (I), the interdigital geometry of the resonator capacitor results in a different electric field ~Er compared to the qubit (see App. C). The field ~Er is needed when determining the coupling strength between the resonator and each Q-TLS, g = ~p \u00b7 ~Er/h, where ~p is the Q-TLS electric dipole moment. All the simulation parameters required to complete step (I) are reported in Table I.\nThe parameters used in step (II) are identical to those reported in Ref. [12].\nIn step (III), the simulated time series are generated using Eqs. (4a) and (4b), which are based on Eqs. (A2a) and (A2b). In this step, the main departure from Ref. [12] is due to the Q-TLS population \u03c3z0 of Eq. (A1). This population depends on the estimated sample temperature T \u223c 60 mK and \u3008n\u3009, where the latter is obtained from Pp by means of Eq. (5) [31]. Except for the pump power and detuning, the pump-off and pump-on simulations are identical to each other. In particular, after randomly generating the Q-TLS frequency time series of Eq. (6), the same frequency series are used for all different pump settings.\nThe collections of T-TLSs and Q-TLSs used in the simulations are randomly drawn from distributions; therefore, each realization of a simulation is unique. In order to match the experimental time series, we run a few simulations and select those that visually resemble the experiments.\n6"

Similar results for R2 are shown in Fig. S1 of the Supplemental Material. A set of parameters extracted from the experimental time series and PSD fits for both R1 and R2 are reported in Table II. We note that, at low and medium power, \u3008n\u3009 is approximately 4000 and 90000 times larger than when the pump is off.\nA continuous 120-h time period would allow us to reach f = 2.3\u00d7 10\u22126 Hz; however, we choose to trade frequency bandwidth at low frequency for accuracy by averaging our data with Welch\u2019s method. We average over 16 time windows, resulting in a fourfold reduction in the PSD variance. This approach makes it possible to accurately characterize fluctuations at very low frequencies.\nA visual inspection of Fig. 2 (a) reveals that fr is pulled towards fp, as in Fig. 1 (a). A similar inspection of Fig. 2 (b) indicates that \u0393rint remains practically unchanged when the pump field is either off or at low power, whereas it is reduced at medium power, as in Fig. 1 (d). These qualitative findings are corroborated by the average values \u3008fr(t)\u3009 and \u3008\u0393rint(t)\u3009 in Table II. Importantly, the noise level of the medium-power traces is noticeably\nreduced compared to the off and low-power regimes (in Fig. S3, we show that, at high power, the noise is even further reduced).\nPerforming measurements at different pump-field settings unveils a striking characteristic in the time series: Traces associated with different values of Pp and \u2206r,p do not track each other. We refer to this behavior as the time-series asymmetry. For example, the inset of Fig. 2 (a) shows that \u2206fr undergoes a pronounced telegraphic jump at t \u2248 285 h for (10 dBm, 2 MHz) (purple trace) but not for any other settings. The inset of Fig. 2 (b) evinces a similar behavior at t \u2248 50 h for pump off (blue trace) and at t \u2248 70 h for (\u22123 dBm, 2 MHz) (orange trace). One more example is the time series for (\u22123 dBm,\u22122 MHz) (yellow trace), which shows drastic amplitude fluctuations in the third time period for both fr and \u0393 r int. We emphasize that our data is collected by cycling the pump-field settings (see Sec. III) and, thus, such large variations among different traces are unexpected.\nThe PSDs shown in Figs. 2 (c) and (d) confirm the behavior observed in the time series. Notably, we measure \u223c 1/f -noise persisting down to f = 5.8\u00d7 10\u22126 Hz. At medium power, as expected, the overall noise level is significantly reduced compared to pump off; unexpectedly, the noise level at low power is similar or even slightly higher. We refer to this overall behavior as noise-level power scaling. The yellow trace [(\u22123 dBm,\u22122 MHz)], for example, displays drastic time-series fluctuations that lead to a higher noise level in Sy and Sz. We also notice another effect: The yellow trace exhibits a higher noise level than the orange trace [(\u22123 dBm, 2 MHz)], despite Pp being the same for both traces. Additionally, we notice that the Sy noise level for the purple trace [(10 dBm, 2 MHz)] is slightly higher than for the green trace [(10 dBm,\u22122 MHz)].

The dashed lines are obtained from averaging the simulated noise levels for R1 and R2.\nnoise-level asymmetry.\nIt is worth stressing that all the features observed for R1, particularly the time-series asymmetry, are also observed in the time series and PSDs for R2 (see Fig. S1), suggesting these effects are reproducible. We summarize the fluctuation spectroscopy results for R1 and R2 in Fig. 3, which displays Sy and Sz at very low frequency for the five pump-field settings investigated in this work. This figure highlights our findings on noise-level power scaling and asymmetry.\nIn our work of Ref. [12], we have already demonstrated that GTM-based simulations can match \u0393rint(t) for an Xmon transmon qubit; however, in that study we were unable to investigate fluctuations in fr(t). In fact, Xmon qubits are highly susceptible to flux noise, making them effectively insensitive to TLS fluctuations in the frequency. Measuring and simulating resonators, as in the present work, allows us to analyze TLS-induced fluctuations also in fr and, thus, to further corroborate the GTM.\nFigure 4 shows simulations (see Sec. III C) of the experiments reported in Fig. 2; similar simulations for R2 are shown in Fig. S2. When the pump is off, the simulations accurately reproduce the experiments for both fr and \u0393rint. When the pump is set to medium power, the simulations also capture the overall reduction in \u0393rint as well\nas a reduction in the noise level for both Sy and Sz. In addition, the simulated fr is generally pulled towards fp. Figure 3 shows that, at low frequency (10\u22125 Hz), the simulated average noise levels match fairly well the experiments at all powers.\nInterestingly, we observe differences between simulations and experiments at medium and, more prominently, at low power. Firstly, the simulated fr(t) and \u0393 r int(t) time series for pump on track the pump-off series. The simulated time series resemble scaled versions of each other; in contrast, the experimental traces are characterized by a time-series asymmetry. Secondly, at low power, the simulated noise level is reduced compared to pump off. This behavior is clearly expected in the simulations because any amount of Q-TLS saturation necessarily leads to a monotonic reduction in the impact of Q-TLSs [see Eqs. (4a) and (4b)]. Although experiments and simulations agree fairly well in this regard (Fig. 3), it is for this reason that the slight increase in experimental noise level at low power is unexpected. Finally, the simulations do not show any noise-level asymmetry; instead, they reveal an almost identical noise level for different values of \u2206r,p, at any given Pp."

            "text": "It is comforting that the theoretical model described in Sec. II allows us to explain the experimental results when the pump is off as well as the general noise trend at low frequency, as explained in Sec. IV. At low and medium power, however, the departures between experiments and simulations suggest that injecting photonic excitations into the system results in more complex dynamics. Such dynamics are not entirely captured by the independent Jaynes-Cummings model implemented in our simulations.\nThe low and medium power regimes correspond to a scenario where a few hundred to a few thousand photons populate a system with approximately 10000 lossy QTLSs, which are simultaneously coupled to one resonator. A more sophisticated model is likely needed to capture the complexity of this system, such as a driven-dissipative Tavis-Cummings model for the Q-TLS\u2013resonator interaction, where, following the GTM, each Q-TLS also interacts with a few T-TLSs undergoing stochastic fluctuations. At high power, the Q-TLSs are effectively turned off by saturation, thereby leading to simpler dynamics. It may also be required to include the effect of Q-TLS\u2013 Q-TLS interactions [17]. Unfortunately, a quantum computer would be likely required to simulate a Hilbert space of this size.\nIn the works of Refs. [17, 24, 25], the authors have measured fr(t) up to approximately 3 h. While their measurement method allows them to access higher frequencies than ours, their lowest frequency is limited to larger than 10\u22123 Hz. Additionally, their measurements are performed for \u3008n\u3009 & 2 in Refs. [17, 24] and & 40 in\n9\nRef. [25] (i.e., higher than ours) and only at \u2206r,p = 0 (i.e., only on resonance). Within these constraints, their PSDs generally indicate a progressive noise reduction with increasing \u3008n\u3009. These results are consistent with our observations at medium and high power (see Fig. S3 for the high power measurements) but cannot be compared to our findings at low power and pump off. Interestingly, the time series reported in Ref. [25] display a single dominant TLS in all time series; in contrast, our data reveals the presence of an ensemble of Q-TLSs. It is also worth noting that their technique does not make it possible to measure \u0393rint, which, in our experiments, allows us to gain further information about the resonators\u2019 noise processes."

Additionally, any Q-TLS\u2013 induced noise is almost entirely suppressed at high power.\nWhen comparing our experiments to simulations, we find a reasonable agreement but also a few interesting discrepancies. These indicate that further investigations are required to explain all the features observed in the experiments. Future work may focus on added complexity to the model, as suggested in Sec. V, or an entirely new approach to the description of stochastic time fluctuations due to driven-dissipative TLS interactions.\nFinally, an outlook on possible quantum computing applications. Pumping resonators off resonance leads to improvements in Qrint [13\u201315]. In Fig. S3, we show the results of a high-power pump at \u2206r,p = \u22122 MHz. When the pump is on, Sy(10 \u22125 Hz) and Sz(10 \u22125 Hz) are reduced by a factor of \u223c 194 and 133, respectively (we find similar results on other three resonators; data not shown). Naively, one may think to apply such a pumping to qubits in order to increase their T1 and reduce time fluctuations; however, a strong pump, even when detuned by \u223c 100 linewidths from the qubit transition frequency, results in a significant qubit population. Recently, an alternative method based on low-frequency Landau-Zener\n10\ntransitions has been shown to improve Qrint, while keeping the resonator in the vacuum state [33]. Our results of Fig. S3 indicate that TLS saturation can be used as a powerful tool to largely improve qubit operations. Using low-frequency Landau-Zener transitions to reach saturation could, thus, lead to a major breakthrough in the reduction not only of loss but also of noise in superconducting qubits."

The simulated electric field is plotted in Fig. 7.\nUsing HFSS, we compute the electric mode volume associated with R2 (or R1) from\nVm = \u03b5Si \u222b\u222b\u222b \u2126Si dV ~Er \u00b7 ~E\u2217r + \u03b50 \u222b\u222b\u222b \u2126v dV ~Er \u00b7 ~E\u2217r\nmax ( \u03b5Si ~Er,Si \u00b7 ~E\u2217r,Si , \u03b50 ~Er,v \u00b7 ~E\u2217r,v ) , (C1) where \u03b5Si and \u03b50 are the absolute electric permittivities of the silicon region \u2126Si and the vacuum region \u2126v and ~Er,Si, and ~Er,v are the electric fields in \u2126Si and \u2126v [35]. We obtain Vm \u2248 9.692\u00d7 10\u221217 m3. Hereafter, we refer to the integrals in the numerator of Eq. (C1) as ISi and Iv.\nThe zero-point electric field at a position ~r can then be written as\n~Er0(~r) =\n\u221a hf\u0303r\n2\u03b5effVm ~Gr(~r), (C2)\nwhere ~Gr(~r) = ~Er(~r)/max(\u2016 ~Er(~r)\u2016 ) is the electric mode function evaluated at f\u0303r and \u03b5eff = \u03b5Siq + \u03b50(1 \u2212 q) is the effective absolute electric permittivity; the filling factor q = ISi/(ISi + Iv) \u2248 0.916 [36]. For \u03b5Si/\u03b50 = 11.9, we obtain \u03b5eff/\u03b50 \u2248 10.981.\nFigure 7 (a) confirms that \u2016 ~Er0\u2016 is concentrated primarily around the resonator capacitor. Near the center region of the capacitor, we assume ~Er0 to be uniform over the y-axis and periodic over the x-axis. As indicated in Fig. 7 (a), we consider an xz cross section intersecting three capacitor fingers. We discretize the cross section using a triangular mesh with triangles\u2019 side lengths 6 10 nm; this mesh is much finer than in the rest of the simulated structure. This approach allows us to efficiently compute high resolution values of the electric field within the cross section, ~Er0(x, z). We perform simulations for six different values of z with a spacing of 0.5 nm, from 0.5 to 3.0 nm above the top surface of either the Al film or the Si substrate. The results for one value of z are shown in Fig. 7 (b). We generate g by evaluating \u2016 ~Er0\u2016 at randomly picked points (x, z) corresponding to Q-TLS positions.\n[1] S. Rasmussen, K.

[26] The 1/ \u221a\n2 factor in J is due to the hanger-type coupling configuration [6] of our resonators. [27] In our experiments, the resonators are characterized by a single mode because they are made of quasilumped elements. [28] H. Wang, M. Hofheinz, M. Ansmann, R. C. Bialczak, E. Lucero, M.

[30] See Supplemental Material at [URL will be inserted by publisher] for results for R2, high-power pump, and setup. [31] We use \u0393\u0303rint instead of \u0393 r int because, at this stage, we do\nnot have access to \u0393r,Q-TLSint . Given the other quantities in the denominator, this is an acceptable approximation. [32] More precisely, we fit log10[S(f)/s0], where the scaling\nfactor s0 = 10 blog10 h\u03030e; h\u03030 is the initial guess for h0 and\nb\u00b7e is the rounding function. [33] S. Matityahu, H.

[35] The electric field depends on the position ~r; thus, the maximum value in the denominator has to be intended as the maximum of the electric field density maxima in \u2126Si and \u2126v. [36] R.
