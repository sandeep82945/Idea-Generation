            "text": "In agriculture, pesticides are generally used to control/eradicate pests and weeds from disrupting the crop chain to meet the food requirements for the ever-growing population.1 But nevertheless, a small concentration of their residues could cause serious threats to the environment as well as to the health of living organisms worldwide.1,2 The concentration of pesticides needs to be determined accurately through robust, costeffective, and quickly validated analytical protocols and strategies.3\u201313\nIn the early 1950s, phenyl urea was rst employed to prevent weeds from growing in the cereal and poppy crops. Chlortoluron belonging to the class of phenyl urea derivatives is one of the excessively used herbicides with higher efficiency to control the broad-leaved weeds and annual grasses in the agricultural crops. It has oen been detected in the surface and groundwater at concentrations ranging from 9.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 mol L\u22121 to 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22129 mol L\u22121. Although its solubility in water is low, its minute concentration can lead to drastic consequences.14 The long-term use of chlortoluron can lead to water pollution while the long-term exposure might result in carcinogenic effects.14\u201316 The chronic exposure to the chlortoluron exhibits carcinogenic properties and is directly toxic to the aquatic organisms. Chlortoluron is a potential human carcinogen and has been\nlakand, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\nf Peshawar, Pakistan\nalakand, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan\n037\nclassied as a group 2B carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer (IARC). The IARC monograph on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans provides evidence of chlortoluron-induced tumours in the experimental animals, including mice and rats. These studies suggests that chlortoluron might cause tumours in several organs such as liver, urinary bladder, and thyroid. Exposure to chlortoluron can cause eye and skin irritation, respiratory problems, and digestive problems. Detection of chlortoluron is important for food safety, environmental protection, and regulatory compliance. Its detection can help monitor the herbicide level in the environment which might be helpful in the development of the relevant regulations/policies.15\u201318\nNew method development for the rapid, sensitive, simple, and selective quantication of chlortoluron is a challenging task.14 The available laboratory-based procedures for the chlortoluron detection are high-performance liquid chromatography,1 gas chromatography,1 enzyme-linked to immunosorbent testing,2 capillary electrophoresis, and electrochemical techniques.2 These analytical methods are associated with limitations such as longer analysis time, complicated operating procedure, tedious sample preparation, instrumentation cost and highly skilled technicians.14\nThe optical analysis methods offer better alternative for the pesticide analysis as these usually include simple instrumentation, cheaper reagents, shorter analysis time, and operational ease. Fluorescence-based sensors for the determination of pesticides including quantum dots, organic dyes, uorescent proteins, and metal\u2013organic frameworks have been reported.19,20\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Since their discovery in early 2000s, CDs have been regarded as the green alternatives to the traditional quantum dots (QDs).24 Those materials consist of nitrogen and oxygenbased groups as well as the modied functional groups cause easy binding/interaction with target molecules.21\u201325 CDs have been widely used in various elds due to their remarkable properties such as stability, biocompatibility, photoluminescent nature, low toxicity, functionalization, low cost, higher solubility, and facile synthesis.1,2,26\u201337 Fluorescence emission is a dening property of carbon dots (CDs) making them an attractive sensing media in uorescence sensing.\nCD-based sensor systems are used to detect metal ions such as K+, Cu2+, Ag+, and Hg2+ in addition, they are reported for the detection of materials and biological agents such as bacteria, viruses, and pathogenic organisms. There are very limited reports on the detection of pesticides employing the carbon dotbased systems as the sensing media and this eld of research is in the evolutionary phase.38\u201341\nThis study demonstrates the synthesis of fructose containing carbon dots using the ethylene diamine and fructose through the hydrothermal protocol. Using the ethylene diamine as a nitrogen source with fructose precursor for the synthesis of fructose based caron dots has not been reported prior to this study. The CDF came out with very good results when checked for the determination of chlortoluron. The synthesized CDF has excellent porous and uorescent active nature with stable uorescent intensity in the aqueous medium. In the presence of Fe(III) the uorescence intensity of the CDF was quenched due to the formation of a metastable uorescent ground state complex CDF-Fe(III). The addition of chlortoluron to the CDFFe(III) solution resulted in further quenching of the uorescence intensity which conrmed the reliability of the procedure for better sensing. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed method was validated using the different statistical parameters and analytical gures of merit. The analytically validated method was applied for the chlortoluron determination in different spiked and real environmental samples."

Maximum quenching was achieved with 30 mg mL\u22121 of CDF and 0.5 mg mL\u22121 of the chlortoluron solution as shown in Fig. 6a. The quenching phenomena could be described quantitatively by the Stern\u2013Volmer equation \u201cFo/F = 1 + KSV [Q]\u201d where F and Fo are the uorescence intensity of CDF solution before and aer the addition of Fe(III) solution respectively.

The uorescence quenching efficiency gradually increased with increasing the concentration of CDF up to 30 mg mL\u22121. Exceeding the CDF dose from 30 mg mL\u22121 resulted in the lower quenching efficiency and hence it was selected as the optimal amount and used for further uorescent studies.\nThe presence of amine groups at the CDF surface exhibiting the excellent uorescence characteristics lead us to investigate the CDF uorescence response to different concentrations of Fe(III) solution at 25 \u00b0C (Fig. 6b). The gradual addition of Fe(III) solution to the aqueous solution of CDF resulted in immediate decreased intensity of the emission peak at 454 nm. When the concentration of Fe(III) ion was increased from 2.0 mgmL\u22121 to 20 mg mL\u22121 there was a drop in the FI of CDF. The differential quenching effects of Fe(III) are related to their electronic status. Since the presence of unsaturated electronic states in Fe(III) can lead to non-radiative energy/charge transfer from CDF to Fe(III), the quenching in FI of the CDF by Fe(III) ions can be attributed to the formation of Fe(III) complex at the CDF surface.\npH and time effect\nDuring the uorescence detection of chlortoluron pH of the sensing medium plays an essential role. As shown in Fig. 6c the uorescence intensity of the CDF-Fe(III) sensor increased with increasing pH and has a maximum value at pH 4.0, and the FI decreased as the pH increased above 8.0. Strong FI peak was observed in the pH range of (4\u20138). Under acidic conditions the surface groups of CDF-Fe(III) are protonated and able to coordinate with chlortoluron. Thus pH 4.0 is the optimum pH for further study. As a result of time effect investigation, no signicant change was detected on the stability of CDF-Fe(III) in different time intervals (Fig. 6d)."

            "text": "The exact mechanism of uorescent properties of carbon dots (CDs) is not well established yet.1 The CDF contains a basic amine and hydroxyl groups at its surface. The uorescent activity is generated from electron\u2013hole recombination pathways as well as from surface-trapped states. Upon excitation at 382 nm, the electrons jumped to a higher energy level and therefore exhibit a beautiful blue uorescence. Chemical sensing is performed by monitoring changes in the CDF uorescence in the presence of a target analyte. The presence of heteroatoms can potentially improve sensing performance and be made tailored to interact with specic analyte. For instance, CDF synthesized from ethylene diamine and fructose exhibit high selectivity towards Fe(III). The high affinity of CDF towards Fe(III) and the presence of nitrogen and oxygen groups in CDF allow for rapid chelation. A static uorescence quenching mechanism is usually operative indicating the formation of a non-radiative complex between the CDF and the Fe(III). Initially, Fe(III) quenches the uorescence of the CDF via the complex formation. The uorescence quenching effect of Fe(III) was much stronger, which demonstrated that CDF has high selectivity for Fe(III).42 This phenomenon led to the quenching in the FI of the CDF-Fe(III) being reected in its high binding affinity to the CDF.43 The quenching effect of Fe(III) at\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The chlortoluron might undergo ionic interactions, H-bonding, and covalent binding with the available groups at the surface of the CDF-Fe(III) resulting in the uorescence quenching of CDF-Fe(III). Two types of the uorescence quenching are collisional/dynamic quenching and static quenching.43 Static quenching is caused by the interaction of an empty orbital in the quencher ion with pi (p) electrons of the CDF, which can form a complex and then results in uorescence quenching. Thus, excited-state reactions, molecular rearrangements, ground\u2013state complex formation, collisional quenching, energy/electron transfer and emission group destruction lead to uorescence quenching.

Thus, the CDF-Fe-Chl system was constructed to analyse the chlortoluron concentration. The chlortoluron \u223cCDF-Fe(III) interactions were studied by the spectrouorometer. The Stern\u2013Volmer equation was used for the data processing.23,43\u201345\nSelectivity of the probe and effect of other metal ions\nThe uorescence response of the probe CDF-Fe(III) towards the chlortoluron in presence of several pesticides (pirimicarb, mesotrione, imidacloprid, carbofuran, methomyl, mesotrione, atrazine) and metal ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cu+, Zn2+, Ag+, Cr3+, Co2+ and Cd2+) was carried out. The FI quenching response (F/Fo) of CDF towards the chlortoluron was much higher in comparison to those of the other pesticides and remained unaffected in the presence of other pesticides (Fig. 8A). Similarly, The FI response (F/Fo) of CDF was higher towards chlortoluron in the presence of Fe(III) in comparison to those in the presence of other metal ions (Fig. 8B). It indicates that there was no signicant interference from similar types of metal ions in the sensing process. The results showed that other ions had no obvious quenching effect on the uorescence of the probe being designed in current study.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 17028\u201317037 | 17033\nFig. 7 Schematic illustration of the chlortoluron sensing mechanism using the fructose carbon dots.\nFig. 8 Selective fluorescence response of CDF-Fe(III) probe towards chlortoluron in the presence of pesticides (A) and in the presence of metal ions (B).\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In this phenomenon of quenching, F is higher than Fo because F is the original uorescence intensity of the CDF alone while Fo is the uorescence intensity of the CDF in the presence of chlortoluron. Since the quenching of CDF being observed in the presence of chlortoluron is higher which means lower uorescence intensity for Fo which in turns mean the higher ratio for F/Fo. In Fig. 5A, the red plot has been plotted using the CDF uorescence intensity as F and that of the CDF + Fe(III) as Fo. Similarly, in the case of chlortoluron in the expression \u201cF/Fo\u201d F is the uorescence intensity of CDF + Fe(III)\n17034 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 17028\u201317037\nin the absence of chlortoluron and Fo is the uorescence intensity of CDF + Fe(III) in the presence of chlortoluron. Further quenching occurred aer the addition of chlortoluron in the range of 0.2\u20130.5 mg mL\u22121 and hence the ratio F/Fo went on increasing linearly.\nIn the plots given in Fig. 8A and B we plotted the quenching efficiency taken on Y-axis in the form of F/Fo against the concentration of the interfering species being taken on X-axis. In the absence of the interfering species the quenching of the system containing the chlortoluron is maximumwhere the ratio F/Fo is around 1.1, while in the presence of interfering species change in the quenching efficiency has been plotted against the concentration of the interfering specie. Since the change in quenching efficiency is very small in the presence of interferant\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

That's why the value has been dropped to a signicant level that is around 0.2 in the plots which is the change in quenching efficiency as a result of interferant addition.\nFor further clarication, the ref. 23 and 44 are added to manuscript. But nevertheless, some pesticides such as pirimicarb (PRC) and methomyl (MT) can interfere showing a little higher change in the quenching efficiency of the system during the detection of chlortoluron. The change in quenching efficiency in the presence of the PRC and MT which is around 0.5 can be seen in the Fig. 8A. While no signicant change in the quenching efficiency of the system was observed by the addition of metal ions as shown in Fig. 8B.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The stability of the synthesized carbon dots was checked aer regular interval of times that is right aer synthesis, aer three months, aer six months and at the end of the year. The stability was checked mechanically, thermally, and chemically. The CDF were stable under acidic and neutral conditions, but their stability decreased slightly at higher alkaline conditions. At elevated pH, the uorescence intensity slightly decreased which might suggest the unstable nature of the CDF at pH higher than 10.\nApplication of the proposed method to real sample analysis\nTo practicalize the sensor feasibility, sensing of the resultant probe was conducted in various environmental samples such as water samples (river, lake, and drinking) soil and wheat grain samples. The highest recovery percentage was achieved in all the cases showing the applicability of the proposed method. The recovery percentage ranges from 95% to 104.3% \u00b1 2.24 (Table 1) indicating that this uorescent sensor system has reasonable accuracy and can be used for detection of chlortoluron in practical samples."

            "text": "A facile procedure for the direct synthesis of the fructose bound carbon dots has been proposed. The uorescence intensity of the synthesized dots was quenched in the presence of Fe(III) due to the formation of non/less uorescent CDF-Fe(III) ground state complex. The FI intensity was further quenched upon chlortoluron addition to the system owing to the affinity of the chlortoluron towards Fe(III). Thus, a reliable determination method for the chlortoluron was developed which can be used for the determination of chlortoluron traces in real samples with high sensitivity, good specicity, good accuracy and precision, wide linear range and acceptable recovery. The fast, simple, and costeffective sensing system proposed and designed in current study has a great potential for practical use."
