    "abstractText": "This work adopted a green synthesis route using cashew tree gum as a mediating agent to obtain Ni-doped ZnO nanoparticles through the sol\u2013gel method. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of the hexagonal wurtzite phase and distortions in the crystal lattice due to the inclusion of Ni cations, which increased the average crystallite size from 61.9 nm to 81.6 nm. These distortions resulted in the growth of point defects in the structure, which influenced the samples\u2019 optical properties, causing slight reductions in the band gaps and significant increases in the Urbach energy. The fitting of the photoluminescence spectra confirmed an increase in the concentration of zinc vacancy defects (VZn) and monovacancies (Vo) as Zn cations were replaced by Ni cations in the ZnO structure. The percentage of VZn defects for the pure compound was 11%, increasing to 40% and 47% for the samples doped with 1% and 3% of Ni cations, respectively. In contrast, the highest percentage of VO defects is recorded for the material with the lowest Ni ions concentration, comprising about 60%. The influence of dopant concentration was also reflected in the photocatalytic performance. Among the samples tested, the Zn0.99Ni0.01O compound presented the best result in MB degradation, reaching an efficiency of 98.4%. Thus, the recovered material underwent reuse tests, revealing an efficiency of 98.2% in dye degradation, confirming the stability of the photocatalyst. Furthermore, the use of different inhibitors indicated that \u2022OH radicals are the main ones involved in removing the pollutant. This work is valuable because it presents an ecological synthesis using cashew gum, a natural polysaccharide that has been little explored in the literature.",

            "text": "In recent decades, the development of industrial sectors focused on textile, cosmetic, and graphic manufacturing has played a crucial role in the economies of several countries [1,2]. These sectors are crucial to meet consumer demand, but they can also pose significant risks to the environment, particularly water resources. This can lead to adverse impacts on ecosystems and the health of the population that depends on them [3,4]. Much of this is due to the widespread use of organic dyes, most of which are toxic, combined with the improper disposal of effluents without any treatment, generating the contamination of large volumes of water in rivers and groundwater [5\u20137]. Methylene blue (MB), a phenothiazine derivative commonly used by the textile industry for dyeing fabrics, stands out among the most popular dyes [8,9]. In addition to inhibiting the presence of dissolved\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28237772 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 2 of 22\noxygen in aquatic environments and harming the fauna present [10], this compound also manifests itself as a potential carcinogen linked to other negative implications for human health, as discussed in Ramsay et al. [11]. The issue of contamination is particularly complicated because of the challenges involved in eliminating pollutants. One such pollutant, which is cationic and contains a heterocyclic aromatic chain that is difficult to break down, is resistant to natural degradation and persists in the environment [12]. There are many ways to remove dyes and other organic pollutants from wastewater, but advanced oxidative processes (AOPs) are highly effective. These methods show great promise in solving pollution problems by breaking down contaminant molecules [13]. Part of the AOPs is heterogeneous photocatalysis, the implementation of which is based on the use of semiconductors, which are photoactivated by UV and visible radiation through the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band [14,15]. This process generates various oxygenated radicals, including the hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH), which promotes the degradation of contaminating molecules, resulting in non-toxic products and, in many cases, complete mineralization [16,17]. Among the various semiconductors used in photocatalysis, zinc oxide (ZnO) has gained prominence. The synthesis of this semiconductor can be carried out by different methods, such as physical [18], hydrothermal [19], solvothermal [20], sol\u2013gel [21], precipitation [22], and many others. In general, ZnO synthesis is carried out under controlled conditions to ensure the purity of the compound and obtain the desired properties [23]. Furthermore, ZnO synthesis can be adjusted to obtain different particle shapes and sizes, which can influence, for example, its optical and surface properties [20,24\u201326]. In addition, the growth of ZnO oxides using plant derivatives has emerged as a green synthetic approach in recent years [27,28]. Vegetable gums are polysaccharides that act as stabilizing agents for nanoparticles in general, impacting the morphology and size of this nanostructure [29,30]. Studies have reported the use of Acacia [31], Karaya and Arabic [32], Tragacanth [33], and Cashew [34] gums in the synthesis of ZnO. Furthermore, ZnO nanostructures obtained using vegetable gums showed satisfactory photocatalytic results. Ara\u00fajo et al. [35] used the sol\u2013gel method to manufacture ZnO with a nano-flower-like structure from Karaya gum and reported effective performance in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. On the other hand, the ZnO properties can be adjusted by dopant inclusion to meet specific requirements for various applications. When it comes to photocatalytic activity, doping the ZnO lattice is crucial for trapping charge carriers from holes and photogenerated electrons in the valence and conduction bands, respectively. This makes recombination difficult, thus ensuring efficient performance [36\u201338]. This allows the species to remain available for longer redox reactions at the surface of the material. Different transition metals have been explored as dopants of the ZnO lattice, and the effect of each of them on the general properties depends on factors such as the synthesis method and the cation concentration in the lattice [39\u201342]. In this sense, the use of nickel as a doping element has attracted the attention of numerous researchers due to the improvement caused by the photocatalytic activity of several dyes. Zyoud et al. [43] show that Ni-doped ZnO increased MB degradation under blue light compared to undoped compounds. The inclusion of Ni in the ZnO structure also improved the removal of rhodamine B (RB), as reported by Zhao et al. [44]. The main objective of this study is to synthesize the pure and doped ZnO using different concentrations of Ni cations (1% and 3%) in the presence of natural polysaccharide (cashew gum) as a green mediating agent. Particularly, it was synthesized by the sol\u2013 gel route in the presence of cashew gum the Zn1\u2212xNixO compound (x = 0.00, 0.01, and 0.03) and investigated the effects of dopant on the structural, optical, morphological, and photocatalytic properties of ZnO. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated using methylene blue (MB) as a model contaminant under a UV source. Additionally, this study investigated the stability and reaction mechanisms of the Ni-doped ZnO samples. The dopant concentrations and synthesis method were chosen to strictly control synthesis parameters and avoid exceeding solubility limits, while also being cost-effective.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 3 of 22"

Results and Discussion 2.1. Structural Analysis of the Zn1\u2212xNixO Compound\nThe investigation of the structural parameters and phase purity of undoped and Nidoped ZnO nanoparticles was carried out using the XRD technique (Figure 1). The diffraction patterns for the NZ0, NZ1, and NZ3 samples, as well as for cashew tree gum (CG), are shown in Figure 1a. Firstly, it is noted that there are no diffraction peaks along the spectrum belonging to CG, which confirms the absence of impurities in the polysaccharide and makes it suitable for the synthesis process. On the other hand, in all XRD patterns of the ZnO samples, the diffraction peaks corresponding to the reflection of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), (004) and (202) planes appear, which are indexed to the wurtzite hexagonal structure of ZnO according to JCPDS data (Card No. 36-1451). Throughout the XRD patterns, reductions in the intensity of the diffraction peaks are noted as the Ni concentration increases by up to 3% in the ZnO structure, a result analogous to that presented by Anbuselvan et al.

The addition of dopant ions resulted in a reduction in sample crystallinity, which is reflected in the observed intensity variation. Still, as shown in Figure 1b, slight variations in the 2\u03b8 positions for the (100) and (002) planes can be noted, suggesting the Ni2+ inclusion into the ZnO crystal structure [46] and their influence on the atomic distortions.\nFigure 1. (a) XRD patterns for undoped and Ni-doped ZnO samples. (b) Magnification between 31\u00b0 and 35\u00b0, for the crystallographic (100) and (002) planes.\nIn addition, the diffraction patterns of pure and doped NPs confirm the absence of impurities. This indicates the preservation of the ZnO single-phase wurtzite structure, even after doping. This infers that doping occurs in a substitutional manner, with Ni ions occupying the crystallographic sites of Zn2+ [47]. These data are plausible considering the proximity of the ionic radii of Ni (0.069 mm) and Zn (0.074 nm) [48]. On the other hand, it is worth noting that there is a chance that the dopant ions may occupy interstitial positions within the crystal lattice, particularly for doping levels of 3%. This is supported by the slight increase observed in the lattice parameters a and c, as demonstrated in Table 1. The lattice parameters were estimated from diffraction patterns and using the Equation (1):\n25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 31 32 33 34 35\nCASHEW GUM\nNZ3\nNZ1\nIn te\nns ity\n(C ou\nnt )\n2\u03b8 (degrees)\nNZ0 (20 2) (2 01 ) (0 04 ) (2 00\n) (1 12\n)\n(1 03\n)\n(1 10\n)\n(1 02\n)(0 02\n)\n(1 01\n)\n(1 00\n)\na)\nIn te\nns ity\n(C ou\nnt )\n2\u03b8 (degrees)\n(100)\n(002)\nNZ3\nNZ1\nNZ0\nb)\nFigure 1.

This infers that doping occurs in a substitutional manner, with Ni ions occupying the crystallographic sites of Zn2+ [47].

On the other hand, it is worth noting that there is a chance that the dopant ions may occupy interstitial positions within the crystal lattice, particularly for doping levels of 3%. This is supported by the slight increase observed in the lattice parameters a and c, as demonstrated in Table 1. The lattice parameters were estimated from diffraction patterns and using the Equation (1):(\n1 dhkl\n)2 =\n4 3\n( h2 + hk + k2\na2\n) + l2\nc2 , (1)\nwhere a and c are the desired lattice parameters; h, k, and l are the Miller indices, and dhkl is the spacing distance between the planes (hkl) obtained by the formula 2dhklsin\u03b8 = n\u03bb, with \u03bb being the wavelength of CuK\u03b1 radiation (1.5406 \u00c5\u0301) [49]. To facilitate the calculations, the diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100) and (002) planes were used to find a and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 4 of 22\nc, respectively [48]. Also, from the a/c ratio, we again confirmed the maintenance of the hexagonal structure since the values are practically constant for all samples (Table 1) [50].\nOn the other hand, the average crystallite size (D) was calculated using the Willianson\u2013 Hall method via Equation (2) [51].\n\u03b2hklcos (\u03b8) = K\u03bb D + 4\u03b5sin(\u03b8) (2)\nHere, K is the shape factor whose value is 0.9; \u03b5 is the lattice microstrain; \u03b2hkl is the total width of half the maximum (FWHM), and \u03b8 is the diffraction angle in radians. From the calculated values (Table 1), we noticed a slight reduction in the crystallite for the sample doped with 1% of Ni compared to undoped ZnO. This result agrees with data recorded in other texts [49,52] due to the smaller ionic radius of Ni, which replaces Zn cations, causing slight defects in the host lattice and favoring the crystallite size reduction. However, when the dopant concentration is adjusted to 3%, a significant increase in D is observed compared to previous values. Al-Ariki et al. [53] also present an analogous result for the same percentage of Ni concentration. A possible explanation for this involves the occupation of interstitial positions by dopant cations [48], a reason that is also attributed to the increase in unit cell volume and lattice parameters, as discussed previously. Linked to this are lattice tensions and stress, which, according to Pe\u00f1a-Garcia et al. [39], may also be related to crystallite growth. Using the values of a and c and the potential parameter of the hexagonal structure u = a2/3c2 + 0.25, the bond length (L) was determined via Equation (3) [39].\nL = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a( a2 3 + ( 1 2 \u2212 u )2 c2 )\n(3)\nIn this case, slight variations in L values are observed as the dopant increases and may be a consequence of changes in the lattice connection symmetry resulting from defects created by the dopant cations insertion. Following the same trend observed for variations in D values, here, there is a slight reduction in L from 1.9725 \u00c5 (NZ0) to 1.9706 \u00c5 (NZ1), slightly increasing to 1.9764 \u00c5 (NZ3). These variations may be due to the difference in ionic radii between Zn and Ni cations, as well as the arrangement of Ni cations in the hexagonal structure. The dislocation density (\u03b4) of the Zn1\u2212xNixO compound was estimated by the Equation (4) [54]:\n\u03b4 = 1\nD2 (4)\nBased on the values presented in Table 1, we observed a contrary trend to what was observed for the crystallite size (D) and bond length (L). Specifically, the value of \u03b4 exhibited a minor increase for 1% doping but decreased significantly with the addition of 3% Ni, as compared to pure ZnO. It is known that the dislocation density is associated with the degree of defects or crystallographic irregularities present in the sample [55]. By this logic, the sample doped with 3% may present a smaller number of surface defects compared to the other compounds, an effect similarly presented in Sankar et al. [56]. On the other hand, increases are recorded in the values of the parameter referring to the network voltage\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 5 of 22\n(\u03b5), suggesting that the inclusion of cation causes deformations in the host structure [57], favoring the emergence of deeper defects already mentioned."

The E2low mode occurs due to the vibrations of the zinc sublattice, while the vibration of the oxygen atom is mainly associated with the E2high mode [47,60]. In a similar way to that described by Fifere et al. [50], this last phonon is linked to the high crystallinity of the material. In addition, the reduction in its intensity along with its broadening, as observed throughout Figure 2b, infers a reduction in the crystallinity of the compounds through the inclusion of Ni ions in the ZnO crystal lattice, data ratified by the information provided in the XRD analyses. From Figure 2b, it is possible to attest to the Zn by Ni cations replacement in the crystal lattice since the E2high mode undergoes slight shifts toward lower wave numbers as the Ni content increases [46].

The E2low mode occurs due to the vibrations of th zinc sublattice, while the vibration of the oxygen tom is mainly associated with the E2high mode [47,60].

In addition, the reduction in its intensity along with its broadening, as observed throughout Figure 2b, infers a reduction in the crystallinity of the compounds through the inclusion of Ni ions in the ZnO crystal lattice, data ratified by the information provided in the XRD analyses. From Figure 2b, it is possible to attest to the Zn by Ni cations replacement in the crystal lattice since the E2high mode undergoes slight shifts toward lower wave numbers as the Ni content increases [46]. This tendency to shift to lower wavenumbers is also seen for other peaks, as in the case of the mode attributed to the E2high \u2212 E2low difference, being centered at ~331 cm\u22121 for NZ0 and at ~329 cm\u22121 and ~327 cm\u22121 for NZ1 and NZ3, respectively [61], as well as for phonons 2E2low and B1low, whose values are also indicated in Table 2.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 6 of 22\nOne hypothesis for these changes may be linked to the disorder in the structure of the materials, resulting from the growth of oxygen vacancies (VO) in the crystalline lattice due to dopant inclusion, leading to modifications in the bonding symmetry of the atoms, which is also reflected in the slight changes in chemical bond lengths (L), as shown in Table 1 [59,62]. The insertion of Ni cations may lead to the growth of interstitial defects and vacancies, which could be the reason behind the disappearance of the A1(TO) and E1(TO) modes. These modes are only observed in the pure ZnO spectrum at around 377 cm\u22121 and 411 cm\u22121, respectively. Once again, defects can attenuate crystal lattice symmetry, rendering some vibrational modes inactive as they are linked to higher symmetry structures [63]. In Figure 2c, the magnified spectra between 500\u2013700 cm\u22121 display three low-intensity peaks that are now more clearly identified as B1high, A1(LO), and E1(LO) modes [63,64]. The intensity of the first and last phonons is lowered due to the dopant ions, possibly due to the vibration limitations of the lattice, which may occur because of the emergence of vacancy defects. On the other hand, vacancy defects may promote an increase in the vibration amplitude of the A1(LO) mode."

            "text": "The study of the optical properties of the Zn1\u2212xNixO system was carried out using the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) technique, whose spectra were obtained in a scanning zone of 200\u2013800 nm, as indicated in Figure 3. It is evident that in the visible region, the reflectance curves of samples NZ1 and NZ3 exhibit absorption bands centered at ~618 nm and ~656 nm, which are not present in NZ0. According to Singh et al. [65], this is related to the internal electronic d\u2013d transitions of Ni ions in tetrahedral symmetries, corresponding to the 3T1(F) \u2192 3T1(P) ligand field transitions. There is an increase in reflectance intensity for longer wavelengths, which is also noticeable throughout the entire spectrum of pure ZnO at wavelengths greater than 400 nm. This trend has been similarly reported by Handan et al. [66]. The authors attribute this effect to the increase in the interactions of incident photons with the electronic structures of the synthesized compounds. Another important aspect to be observed concerns the decrease in reflectance intensity as the doping percentage increases, a fact that confirms the Ni atoms insertion in the wurtzite structure [45] and which can be attributed to the lattice strain, as well as the intermediate energy levels formation in the semiconductor band [67,68]. This last factor is greatly corroborated by the variation in band gap energy (Eg) values of doped ZnO systems compared to undoped ones. To estimate the Eg values, the Tauc model was employed through Equation (5) [69]:\nF(R)h\u03bd = A ( h\u03bd\u2212 Eg )n (5)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 7 of 22\nwhere A is an energy-independent constant; h\u03bd is the energy of the incident photon; n = 2 is an index referring to the type of direct optical transition, and F(R) corresponds to the Kubelka\u2013Munk (K\u2013M) function that is expressed through the following Equation (6) [70]:\nF(R) = (1\u2212 R)2\n2R = K S\n(6)\nwith K and S being, respectively, the K\u2013M mirroring and absorption coefficients.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 22\nsystems compared to undoped ones.

The impact of Ni dopant on the energy bandgap (Eg) can be observed in this case. The values of Eg for the pure compounds and those doped with 1% and 3% Ni were 3.26 eV, 3.25 eV, and 3.23 eV, respectively. Although the reduction in Eg is small, it can be attributed to various factors. A possible explanation for the reduction in Eg values is the creation of unoccupied states in the gap between the valence and conduction bands of the semiconductor. These states act as electronic traps, capturing excited electrons. These states can be induced by the segregation of the grain boundaries of Ni cations [71], as well as by electron exchange interactions that occupy the sp\u2013d orbitals of Ni ions [39,46]. In addition, during synthesis, oxygen and zinc vacancy defects increase, which may be related to the decrease in Eg due to the different characteristics of the cations involved in the system [71,72]. As the doping increases, the energy gap decreases. However, there is a considerable increase in the Urbach energy values. For instance, the Urbach energy value is 55.55 meV for pure ZnO. But for ZnO doped with 1% and 3% Ni, it increases to 94.11 meV and 124.81 meV, respectively. This information is shown in Figure 4a. This trend of increasing EU is entirely plausible, considering that the Urbach energy measures the general disorder present in the material caused by the insertion of doping impurities into the host microstructure [68]. Increasing the percentage of Ni in ZnO leads to a greater imbalance of charges in the samples. This, in turn, promotes an increase in the oxygen (VO) and zinc (VZn) vacancies, which, in turn, represents an increase in the disorder in the crystalline lattice [73].\nf i ti .\nTherefore, the energy gap values (Eg) were obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the square graph of the absorbed energy, [F(R)h\u03bd]2, as a function of the energy of the incident photon, h\u03bd, as shown in Figure 4a.

In this way, these disorders can modify the bonding scheme between the atoms and/or ions of the semiconductor and can, consequently, generate states located in the forbidden energy region, which are also known as Urbach tail states. Therefore, the Urbach energy corresponds to the width of these tail states [66,68] and, in this work, it was stipulated from\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 8 of 22\nthe inverse slope of the linear adjustment line of the curves ln(F(R)) versus the energy h\u03bd, according to Figure 4b.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 22\nIn this way, these disorders can modify the bonding scheme between the atoms and/or ions of the semiconductor and can, consequently, generate states located in the forbidden energy region, which are also known as Urbach tail states.

The emission spectra obtained are shown in Figure 5. These defects were distinguished and quantified through the deconvolution of the PL curves through a Gaussian distribution function. In principle, a common factor in the spectra of the three samples is the occurrence of a broad and intense band of UV emission followed by a less intense band of visible emission. However, the position and intensity of its peaks end up changing as the percentage of dopants increases. This can be seen, firstly, along the UV band where there is a clear shift of the highest intensity peak to longer wavelengths, being centered at ~390 nm for NZ0, ~394 nm for NZ1, and ~416 nm for NZ3. Furthermore, a clear increase in blue emission related to peaks located in the range of 443\u2013466 nm is also seen upon increasing doping. All these data suggest an increase in the surface defect states for the doped samples since the peaks located in this range result from the near band-edge transition (NBE) as a consequence of the excitonic recombination of electrons located in states close to the edge of the layers conduction and valence [12,46,74,75]. Throughout the visible region, there has been a noticeable increase in photoluminescence (PL) emission. This trend is particularly prominent in the range from 470 nm to 630 nm and is attributed to intrinsic defects such as zinc (VZn) and oxygen (VO) vacancies in the ZnO wurtzite network. This increase in emission is caused by the transfer of charges in the forbidden energy range from energy levels located further away from the conduction and valence bands [25,75]. According to the literature [61,76], VZn vacancies are electron acceptors, while VO is the donor type. Given the above, the percentage quantification of emerging defects in each sample is displayed along the bar graph in Figure 5d. The presence of VZn defects increases noticeably with doping and accounts for about 11% of the total vacancies found in pure ZnO. In NZ1 and NZ3, the research shows percentages of VZn defects of 40% and 47%, respectively. This increase in VZn defects is directly reflected in the cyan emission peak at ~488 nm, which is higher in the doped compounds compared to the undoped ones.

In contrast, compounds modified with Ni lack this type of vacancy. The growth of VZn and VO vacancies in the NZ1 and NZ3 samples extinguishes this type of defect. One explanation for the disappearance of defects in doped compounds can be correlated to the differences in the electronegativity and ionic radii of Ni ions compared to Zn ions. This creates an imbalance of charge in the host microstructure, which changes the bonding scheme between the atoms forming the wurtzite structure. As a result, defects that were present in the undoped structure may be attenuated due to the emergence of new disorders.

These results confir that the aterial doped ith 1 nickel has a higher reaction rate and, therefore, a greater potential for dye re oval in solution. By ay of co parison, in Table 3, the values of the reaction rate constant, k, obtained for 1, 3, an other ZnO samples discussed in some texts in the literature for MB removal are shown. The optimal concentration of nickel dopant may have played a role in achieving these photocatalytic results. The PL and Urbach energy results showed t at the insertion of nickel promoted the f rmation f structural defects, mainly oxyge vacancies, and the formation of new energy levels that become electron trappers, reducing recombination and favoring photocatalytic activity.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 12 of 22\nDopant cations in the ZnO lattice can cause the formation of the impurity level. A consequence of this is that the photogenerated charge carriers remain available longer to improve the photocatalysis performed [85,86]. From the results of photocatalysis in this study, it was observed that there was an optimized concentration of Ni dopant for ZnO to present a high photocatalytic efficiency. These results are consistent with other studies previously reported in the literature [47,87,88]. For example, Pr-doped ZnO, synthesized by sol\u2013gel, was investigated by Ahmad et al. [89] for photodegradation of methyl orange under visible light radiation. In this study, the material obtained an excellent response in visible light for degradation of almost 90% of the dye after 90 min. Modi et al. [90] developed W-ZnO and Sb-ZnO through the direct precipitation method and applied them to the photodegradation of methylene blue under UV and solar light irradiation. The authors observed a discoloration of up to 91% of the dye solution during 120 min of sun exposure. In studies reported by Bouarroudj et al. [91], Ce and Ag co-doped ZnO, obtained by the hydrothermal method, were used for the degradation of metronidazole under solar light radiation. The authors observed that ZnO co-doped achieved up to 97 and 99% degradation of paracetamol and metronidazole, respectively, in 180 min of reaction. In addition to ZnO, other materials have also stood out as efficient photocatalysts. An example of this is reported by Wang et al. [92], who manufactured Bi2O3/CeO2 Z-scheme heterojunctions in TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) by the hydrothermal deposition method and analyzed their effectiveness in degrading the dyes rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB). After applying a voltage of 1.0 V to the target solution and 180 min exposure to a Xe lamp with a 1.5 AM filter, the results revealed that the compound TiO2 NTs/Bi2O3/CeO2 in the ratio (2:1) achieved the best result in removal of RhB and MB, with efficiency of 91.86% and 86.77%, respectively. To study the mechanisms involved in MB photodegradation over the NZ1 sample, we used AgNO3, EDTA, and methyl alcohol as inhibitors of electrons, holes, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively (Figure 8). Comparing the results obtained from each inhibitor agent, we observed that MB removal became more difficult when MetOH was used as the inhibitor. This result suggests that the hydroxyl radicals play a vital role in MB degradation mediated by the NZ1 photocatalyst. On the other hand, in the presence of EDTA and AgNO3, the dye degradation remained unchanged. The degradation rate was 22.4% using MetOH and ~98.4% using EDTA or AgNO3. Based on previously published studies, we propose a mechanism for MB degradation by NZ1 (Equations (7)\u2013(13)). As clarified in the literature, the photoactivation of a semiconductor with adequate radiation promotes the jump of the electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), thus forming electron/hole pairs [93]. Once these charge carriers are generated, they may recombine or migrate to the surface, where redox reactions occur and will cause degradation of the target pollutant. For example, holes in the valence band react with adsorbed water molecules, while electrons present in the conduction band react with adsorbed molecular oxygen on the surface of the material. Different oxidant species, such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, have high reactivity and low selectivity. As a result, these species cause the breakdown of bonds in organic compounds and the subsequent degradation of pollutants.\nZnNiO + h\u03bd\u2192 h+(VB) + e\u2212(CB) (7)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7772 13 of 22\nh+(VB) + H2O (adsorbed) \u2192 H+ + \u2022OH(adsorbed) (8)\ne\u2212(CB) + O2 \u2192 \u2022O2\u2212 (9)\n\u2022O2\u2212 + H2O2 \u2192 \u2022OH + OH\u2212 + O2 (10)\nNi2++ e\u2212 \u2192 Ni+ (11)\nNi+ + O2 \u2192 Ni2++ \u2022O2\u2212 (12)\nMB + \u2022OH\u2192 degradation/discoloration (13) Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 22\nFigure 8.

Reagents and Cashew Gum Obtention\nThe raw materials used for the synthesis of photocatalyst nanoparticles (NPs) were zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Aldrich-Sao Paulo, Brazil, 99.0%), nickel nitrate (Aldrich- Brazil, 99.0%), ammonium hydroxide (Aldrich, 99.0%), and distilled water. For the photocatalytic tests, methylene blue (Dinamic-Barra da Tijuca, Brazil, 97.0%), methyl alcohol (Neon-Sao Paulo, Brazil, 99.5%), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Dinamic- Brazil, 99.0%), and silver nitrate (Vetec-Duque de Caxias, Brazil, 99.0%) were employed. For the cashew gum obtention, the nodules were collected from cashew trees (Anacardium occidentale L.). Isolation and purification were carried out as suggested in the literature. After removing impurities, the material was dissolved in distilled water (1:10 m/v) under mechanical agitation for 24 h. Then, the pH of the solution was adjusted (pH = 7) with the addition of NaOH solution. The gum was precipitated in ethanol, centrifuged, and washed with acetone three times. Finally, the gum obtained was dried in an oven at 50 \u00b0C for 24 h.\n3.2.

            "text": "The sol\u2013gel method and cashew gum polysaccharide were used to synthesize pure and Ni-doped ZnO nanoparticles successfully. XRD and Raman analyses established that ZnO had a typical hexagonal wurtzite structure, and no secondary phases were detected. Distortions were observed in the ZnO crystal lattice, which are associated with the difference between the ionic radii of the Ni and Zn cations and which are reflected in changes in the crystallite size (61.9\u201381.5 nm). These distortions increased the density of vacancy defects in the structure of the compounds, which affected the optical and photoluminescence properties, as indicated by DRS and PL analyses. SEM analyses revealed that the systems are modeled by clusters of spherical particles. In the photocatalytic tests, the NZ1 sample showed better performance in removing the MB dye (98.4%), indicating that the ideal dopant concentration can influence the photocatalytic performance. MB removal was attributed to \u2022OH radicals based on inhibitor tests. This compound also remained stable during free reuse tests, maintaining a photocatalytic efficiency of 98.2%. Therefore, within the established conditions, the doped materials had excellent efficiency in MB degradation and showed promise for new photocatalytic studies. Furthermore, the successful use of cashew tree gum in the NP synthesis process stands out, proving to be a very viable and innovative alternative, mainly due to its low cost and reduced environmental impact, which can be explored in new works for various syntheses of other materials.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.L., A.G.J., R.B., L.N., P.T., L.C.A., J.A.O., F.A.P. and R.R.P.-G.; validation, P.T., L.C.A., J.A.O., F.A.P. and R.R.P.-G.; formal analysis, F.A.P. and R.R.P.-G.; investigation, A.L., A.G.J., R.B., L.N. and R.R.P.-G.; data curation, A.L., A.G.J., R.B., L.N., L.C.A. and R.R.P.-G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.L., P.T., F.A.P. and R.R.P.-G.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.L., P.T., F.A.P. and R.R.P.-G.; visualization, P.T., L.C.A., J.A.O., F.A.P. and R.R.P.-G.; project administration, F.A.P. and R.R.P.-G.; funding acquisition R.R.P.-G.
