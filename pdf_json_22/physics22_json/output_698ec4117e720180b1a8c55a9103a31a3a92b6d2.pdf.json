    "abstractText": "Nowadays, orthovanadates are studied because of their unique properties for optoelectronic applications. In this work, the LuVO4:Eu, Bi3+ films were prepared by the sol\u2013gel method, using a new simple route, and deposited by the dip-coating technique. The obtained films are transparent, fracture-free, and homogenous. The sol\u2013gel process was monitored by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and according to X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, the crystal structure was tetragonal, and films that were highly oriented along the (200) low-energy direction were obtained. The morphological studies by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed uniformly distributed circular agglomerations of rice-like particles with nanometric sizes. The luminescence properties of the films were analyzed using a fixed concentration of 2.5 at. % Eu3+ and different concentrations of Bi3+ (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 at. %); all the samples emit in red, and it has been observed that the light yield of Eu3+ is enhanced as the Bi3+ content increases when the films are excited at 350 nm, which corresponds to the S0\u2192P1 transition of Bi3+. Therefore, a highly efficient energy transfer mechanism between Bi3+ and Eu3+ has been observed, reaching up to 71%. Finally, it was established that this energy transfer process occurs via a quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction.",

            "text": "Nowadays, phosphor materials with luminescent properties prepared by various techniques are extensively studied because of their great ability to convert UV radiation to the visible spectrum and its multiple applications in different fields, such as integrated photonics [1], optics [2,3], and electronics [4,5]. Most luminescent materials are usually oxides, sulfides, or oxysulfides doped with some transition metal or rare-earth element [6\u20138], but in recent years, some lanthanides known as orthovanadates are currently used as matrices due to their high emission efficiency [9\u201312]. Additionally, these materials have unique properties due to the stoichiometric combination of their components and their symmetry with the crystal of the complex oxides; these characteristics increase the luminescent activity in comparison with the simple materials [13\u201318]. Likewise, rare-earth ions that are used as impurities in orthovanadates have shown strong emissions as well as variations in the emission color corresponding to the different activating ions under the excitation of an electron beam or ultraviolet. The luminescent properties presented in these materials depend largely on the location of the 4f energy levels of the dopants and the ratio of the valence\nMaterials 2023, 16, 146. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16010146 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 146 2 of 17\nand conduction bands (VB and CB, respectively) of the matrix [3,12,19\u201321]. In the energy transfer, the co-doped materials are interesting for optoelectronic applications because of increases in their luminescent effect. Particularly for the Eu3+ emission, several ions have been proposed to increase its well-known reddish emission, for example, usually by the use of other rare earths, such as Dy3+ [22], Tb3+ [23], Tm3+ [24], or Sm3+ [25]. However, the search of other non-rare earths sensitizers has attracted attention in order not only to increase the light yield, but also to modify the excitation wavelength. Therefore, other ions have been studied, like Sb3+ [26] or Li+ [27]. Another possibility is the use of Bi3+, which increases the luminescent properties and broadens the excitation spectrum of europium ions in LuVO4 [28] or Lu2O3 [29]. In the case of LuVO4, since it has been shown to have better optical properties than yttrium vanadate [2,8,30], several routes of synthesis have been studied to obtain higher optical properties. However, most of the synthesis routes that have been developed require high temperatures and highly controlled environments to carry out the reaction, for example, in solid state or hydrothermal reaction synthesis. Consequently, new energy-saving simple-synthesis processes are required that can be scalable to industry. In the case of sol\u2013gel synthesis, it allows one to prepare homogeneous, high-purity materials with the possibility of controlling morphologies and impurities at low preparation temperatures without extremely controlled environments. On the other hand, Pluronic F-127 acid was added to the synthesis because it changes the properties of the film, as was shown in Tsotetsi et al. in 2022 [31] and Arconada et al. in 2010 [32], where it was used to increase the thickness because of its viscosity, for providing porosity to the film, and as a morphology controller. Another characteristic of Pluronic F-127 is that it acts as a structure-directing agent in TiO2 in catalytic and solar cell applications [33,34]. In the present work, transparent films of the LuVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ phosphor were obtained using sol\u2013gel synthesis and the dip-coating method, which can be used in white light emission LEDs, using Bi3+ as a sensitizer of Eu3+ to improve red emission intensity under UV radiation. The films were characterized in terms of their crystalline structure and excitation/emission intensity spectra, as well as in relation to the effect of the annealing temperature and as a function of the Bi3+ content."

            "text": "Synthesis\nLuVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ films were prepared using the sol\u2013gel method and dip-coating technique. First, lutetium acetate (CH3CO2)3Lu\u2022xH2O (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in ethanol (99.5, C2H6O, Fermont, Monterrey, M\u00e9xico) under vigorous magnetic stirring at 60 \u25e6C, obtaining a sol with a 0.15 M lutetium concentration. Later, a second sol was prepared from ammonium metavanadate NH4VO3 (99.0%, Fermont, Monterrey, M\u00e9xico) dissolved in an ammonium hydroxide NH4OH (30%, Fermont, Monterrey, M\u00e9xico) solution in distilled water (36 M), obtaining a sol with a 0.09 M vanadium concentration after vigorous magnetic stirring at 80 \u25e6C for 1 h. Later, the two sols were combined to obtain the LuVO4 sol-precursor, and nitric acid was added (0.5 M) to obtain a clear, homogeneous, and bluish solution after 2 h of stirring at 80 \u25e6C. On the other hand, to add the Eu3+ and Bi3+ ions to the lutetium vanadate sol, europium nitrate Eu(NO3)3\u00b75H2O (99.5%, Alfa Aesar, Tewksbury, MA, USA) was incorporated in order to obtain 2.5 mol % Eu3+ samples, and bismuth was incorporated from a solution prepared by the dissolution of bismuth nitrate Bi(NO3)3\u00b75H2O (98%, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at a 1:1 molar ratio with ethanol:diethyleneglycol (C4H10O3, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), obtaining a Bi3+ 0.05 M concentration. Later, a fixed volume was incorporated into the lutetium vanadate sol to obtain a Bi3+ 0.5, 1, and 1.5 at. % doping-level. Finally, to modify the viscosity of the previously obtained sol and therefore obtain homogeneous films, diethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2)2O (99% Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was first added (5.7 M), followed by acetylacetone (6.8 M) CH3COCH2COCH3 (99% Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), 0.8 M of HNO3, and 0.006 M Pluronic F-127 (C3H6O\u00b7C2H4O, 99% Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The final sol can be used to obtain powders or films;\nMaterials 2023, 16, 146 3 of 17\nfor powders, the sol was dried at 100 \u25e6C for 24 h and then annealed at several temperatures from 200 to 1000 \u25e6C for 3 h for each temperature. For the dip-coating procedure, the sols were filtered using a 0.2 \u00b5m filter, and carefully cleaned silica glass substrates (QSI quartz, Quartz Scientific Inc., Lake County, OH, USA, refractive index = 1.417) were dipped into the prepared sol and pulled up at a constant rate of 4 cm\u00b7s\u22121. After each dipping, the films were dried at 100 \u25e6C for 10 min to remove the water and the most volatile organics components. Subsequently, the film was annealed at 300 \u25e6C and 500 \u25e6C for 10 min each to remove the organic remnants. The dipping cycle was repeated 3 times. Finally, to crystallize the LuVO4 phase, the films were annealed from 600 to 1000\u25e6C for 3 h. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded in the range of 4000\u2013400 cm\u22121, using FTIR (FTIR 2000, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and the KBr pelleting technique. The phase composition of the powders was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature on a powder diffractometer (Bruker D8Advance, Billerica, MA, USA), using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (1.5418 \u00c5). The morphology studies were carried out with a Zeiss Supra 55VP scanning electron microscope. The luminescence study was carried out at room temperature with a fluorescence spectrophotometer Hitachi F-7000, equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp and an R955 photomultiplier tube."

Eu3+ and 1.5% at. Bi3+ sample, the FTIR study at different temperatures (from 200 to 1000 \u25e6C) was carried out (Figure 1). From 200 to 400 \u25e6C, strong bands at 3300 cm\u22121 (\u03bd), 1650 cm\u22121 (\u03b4), and 750 cm\u22121 (\u03b4) are related to the O-H groups due to the presence of water and alcohols (ethanol and diethilenglycol). All these bands disappear at 600 \u25e6C, which indicates that this temperature is adequate to eliminate the O-H groups present in the samples.

Bi3+ chemical evolution.\nIn addition, bands associated with the carbonyl groups (-COOH) ~1725\u20131700 cm\u22121 are observed and attributed to the stretching bond of the lutetium acetate precursor employed, and are completely removed at 600 \u00b0C, which is an indicator of the moment of the beginning of crystallization process [8]. Bands around ~1430\u20131100 cm\u22121 are observed, which correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of the C-H bonds, probably from the use of Pluronic F-127; however, as can be observed, they disappear at 700 \u00b0C [35,36]. Next, at 500 \u00b0C, bands related to the crystallization of LuVO4 can be observed at ~810\u2013830 cm\u22121 and ~446\u2013455 cm\u22121, which correspond to the V-O bonds of the vanadate group (VO23\u2212) and Lu-O, respectively [2]. It is important to notice that, from 700 \u00b0C, all the organic groups have been completely removed from the LuVO4 system, and, therefore, all the luminescent properties correspond only to the ceramic film. The same results have been obtained for the 0, 0.5, and 1.0 at. % of Bi3+ (not shown). All the previous observations can be verified by the diffraction patterns obtained by XRD. First, the XRD patterns of LuVO4: 2.5 at. % Eu3+, X at. % Bi3+ (X = 0.5, 1, 1.5) powders derived from the same sol used to prepare the films, annealed at 1000 \u00b0C, are presented in Figure 2. It can be observed that all samples are exactly in agreement with the corresponding 98-041-9281 ICSD from LuVO4, and the only appreciable impurity, observed at \u2248 26.05\u00b0, could be related to the formation of a secondary vanadate phase, LuVO3 (98-018- 5830 ICSD). It is important to notice that no evidence of the possible formation of impurities from Bi3+ or Eu3+ ions has been detected. This result is expected for Eu3+ because, being a rare earth, it can occupy the position of Lu in the vanadate structure. On the other hand, regarding the case of bismuth, since it would also present a tetragonal structure forming BiVO4 and the same valence as Lu, it can be possible to have at least a partial dissolution of Bi in the structure. Furthermore, the inset in Figure 2 shows that the principal LuVO4 peak presents a gradual shift to the lower degree with the increase in Bi3+ content, implying the lattice expansion of LuVO4 when the Lu atoms in the lattices are gradually substituted by Bi, which has a bigger radius. Similar results have been reported previously by for the YVO4 system [37], who reported the appearance of the BiVO4 phase until the 4.0 at. % of\nFigure 1. FTIR spectra of LuVO4: 2.5% at.

Bi3+ films by XRD analysis.\nIt is evident that the increment in the annealing temperature increases the crystallization of the films. At 600\u2013650 \u00b0C, the broad peak centered at ~25\u201325.5\u00b0 is typical for the amorphous structure obtained by the xerogel formation by the sol\u2013gel process [40]. This amorphous structure disappears at 700 \u00b0C and with the increment in temperature, other peaks characteristic of the lutetium vanadate structure do not appear, which indicates that the films are highly oriented towards the (200) direction. In general, this result can probably be attributed to the films which, when deposited, tend to be structured first in the direction of lower surface energy, in this case, the (200) direction. Additionally, the presence of F127 probably tends to decrease the surface energy of the deposited xerogel; thus, the films maintain this preferential orientation. Furthermore, it has been stated [41] that the slow evaporation of high-molecular-weight alcohol, upon heating, like the diethylene glycol used in the present work, allows the structural orientation of the film before crystallization, preferable in the kinetically favored orientation along the c-axis (200). In order to quantify this observation, the preferential orientation parameter \u03b1hkl was calculated, which is defined as [42]: \u221d = \u2211 (1) where Ihkl is the relative intensity of the corresponding diffraction. Table 1 shows the (200) preferential orientation-index \u03b1200 of the prepared films, and as observed, it practically does not present changes due to the effect of temperature increase, remaining at approximately 0.90, which shows that the orientation process was carried out from low temperatures and, once the material crystallized, the system tends to maintain that orientation. It is worth mentioning that when Pluronic F-127 acid is used, in some studies, it has been shown that it changes the size of the particles and their orientations [36\u201343], which is a very desirable property for luminescent films since oriented films tend to minimize the scattering of light during emission process, therefore incrementing its quantum efficiency [44,45].

Energy level diagram of Bi3+ and Eu3+ in LuVO4.\nThe influence of the Bi3+ content on the luminescence of Eu3+ is observed in Figure 9a at \u03bbexc = 350 nm. In this case, the intensity at 615 nm increases when the atomic content of bismuth is bigger, while the emission observed at 538 nm (corresponding with the bismuth emission) reduces in ratio with the increase in europium emission because an energy transfer occurs according to the energy diagram (Figure 8). For comparison purposes, the emission spectrum of an Eu-mono-doped sample has been added, with \u03bbexc = 308 nm, to observe that there is indeed a process of increment in the emission of Eu3+ due to the presence of bismuth. Furthermore, the emission of Eu3+ is highly dependent on the surroundings of the cation. It is possible to set the ratio R = I (5D0 \u21927F2)/I (5D0 \u21927F1) as a reference to the coordination state and symmetry since the intensity of the 5D0 \u21927F1 magnetic dipole transition (centered at 594 nm) is independent of the surroundings of the Eu3+, whereas the intensity of the 5D0 \u21927F2 electric dipole transition (centered at 618 nm) is very sensitive to site symmetry. If the R value is low, the Eu3+ cation tends to localize at a centrosymmetric site or a high-symmetry site. In contrast, when the R value is high, the Eu3+ cation tends to localize at a non-centrosymmetric site or a low-symmetry site [54]. For the LuVO4: 2.5% at. Eu3+, X% at. Bi3+, the R factor increases from 3.91\u21924.73\u21924.81 for X = 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively, showing that the increment in the Bi3+ content promotes the emission of the low-symmetry sites.\nOn the other hand, it is possible to calculate the energy transfer efficiency (ET) between Bi3+\u2192Eu3+ [55]: \ud835\udf02 = 1 \u2212 (3) where \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc46 is the luminous intensity of Bi3+ ions in the presence of Eu3+ ions, and \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc460 is the luminous intensity of Bi3+ ions in the absence of Eu3+ ions.

According to the Dexter energy level transfer, the electric multipole interactions can be related to [3]: \u2248 \u221d \ud835\udc36 / (4) where \u03b70 and \u03b7 represent the quantum efficiencies of Bi3+ ions in the absence and presence of Eu3+ ions, respectively, the ratio \ud835\udf020/\ud835\udf02 can be calculated by the ratio of luminous intensities (\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc460/\ud835\udc3cS), and C is the total molar concentration of Bi3+ and Eu3+, whereas n = 6, 8, or 10 correspond to electric dipole\u2013electric dipole, electric dipole\u2013electric quadrupole, or electric quadrupole\u2013electric quadrupole interactions, respectively. The corresponding plots are presented in Figure 10, and as observed, the best linear fit is exhibited when n = 10/3, implying that the most probable interaction for the energy transfer from Bi3+ to Eu3+ in the LuVO4 system occurs via quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interactions. This electronic interaction is in good agreement with other Bi3+\u2192Eu3+ energy transfer processes on other systems; for example, the same process has been observed in a Bi3+/Eu3+-doped SiO2\u2013Al2O3\u2013CaO\u2013B2O3\u2013 La2O3\u2013K2O glass, with an ET efficiency of 86% [58], and also on the Ca10(PO4)6F2:Bi3+, Eu3+, with an ET efficiency of 50% [53].\nFigure 9.

(b) Influence of the Bi3+ content on the luminescence of Eu3+ and energy transfer efficiency of Bi3+\u2192Eu3+.\nOn the other hand, it is possible to calculate the energy transfer efficiency (ET) between Bi3+\u2192Eu3+ [55]:\n\u03b7ET = 1\u2212 IS IS0\n(3)\nwhere IS is the luminous intensity of Bi3+ ions in the presence of Eu3+ ions, and IS0 is the luminous intensity of Bi3+ ions in the abse e of Eu3+ . The energy transfer effi iency, as observed in Figure 9b, shows that as the Bi3+ content increases, the energy transfer efficiency from Bi3+\u2192Eu3+ also increases, reaching high val es up to 71% in the 1.5 at. % sample. The ET values vary depending on the matrix and the co-doped ion. For comparison, for other proposed sensitizers for Eu3+, an ET of 68% was obtained for Tm3+\u2192Eu3+ in LiLaSiO4:Tm3+, Eu3+ [56]; 78% for Tb3+\u2192Eu3+ in Ba2SiO4 [57]; or 17% for Sm3+\u2192Eu3+ on TeO2\u2212GeO2\u2212ZnO glasses [24]. On the other hand, the energy transfer from the sensitizers to the activators could be achieved through electric multipole interactions. According to the Dexter energy level transfer, the electric multipole interactions can be related to [3]:\nIS IS0 \u2248 \u03b70 \u03b7 \u221d Cn/3 (4)\nwhere 0 and \u03b7 represent the quantum efficiencies of Bi3+ ions in the absence and presence of Eu3+ ions, respectively, the ratio \u03b70/\u03b7 can be calculated by the ratio of luminous intensities (IS0/IS), and C is the total molar concentration of Bi3+ and Eu3+, whereas n = 6, 8, or 10 correspond to electric dipole\u2013electric dipole, electric dipole\u2013electric quadrupole, or electric quadrupole\u2013electric quadrupole interactions, respectively.

Figure 11 shows the fluorescence decay curves of LuVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ films at 550 nm when the systems are excited at 350 nm. The best fit of the experimental data was obtained using the double exponential equation [59]: \ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3c + \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc52 + \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc52 (5) where I(t) is the luminescence intensity at time t, \u03c41 and \u03c42 are rapid and slow decay times for the exponential components, respectively, and A1 and A2 are constants. That the double exponential equation presented the best fit can be explained since, from classical kinetics, there are two emitting species [60], which is the case in co-doped systems. S Dutta et al. [61] established that this can occur for systems with low concentrations of lanthanides and that it can be due to three factors: (1) the difference in the nonradiative probability of decays for lanthanide ions at or near the surface and lanthanide ions in the core; (2) an inhomogeneous distribution of the doping ions in the host material, leading to the variation in the local concentration; and (3) the transfer of excitation energy from the donor to lanthanide activators [62\u201364]. From the calculation of the decay values of \u03c41 and \u03c42, it can be observed that the values of the co-doped samples are smaller compared with the mono-doped Bi3+ sample, which corroborates the energy mechanism process between Bi3+ ions to Eu3+ ions. Furthermore, as the relation of Eu3+/Bi3+ increases (from 1.5 to 0.5 Bi3+ samples), the fluorescence lifetime decreases. This effect can be explained by the fact that, as this Eu3+/Bi3+ ratio increases, the Bi3+\u2192Eu3+ ion distance must shorten, and the interaction gradually increases, so the fluorescence lifetime of Bi3+ ions decreases. The fast decay component (\u03c41) is derived from the fluorescence decay, whereas the slow decay component (\u03c42) possibly results from the luminescence caused by defects of phosphors on the surface and in the bulk structure [65].\nFi ting relationship of IS0/IS of Bi3+ on C(Bi3++Eu3+)6/3 for a dipole\u2013dipole interaction; C (Bi3++Eu3+)8/3 for a dipole\u2013quadrupole interaction, and C(Bi3++Eu3+)10/3 for a quadrupole\u2013 quadrupole interaction.\n, t i3 fl s o s the fluorescence decay curves of LuVO4: Eu3+ fil s\nt fi i\nI(t) = I0 + A1e \u2212 t\u03c41 + A2e \u2212 t\u03c42 (5)\nwhere I(t) is the luminescence intensity at time t, \u03c41 and \u03c42 are rapid and slow decay times for the exponential components, respectively, and A1 and A2 are constants.

Furthermore, it has been stated that, due to the presence of Pluronic F-123 and diethylene glycol during the sol\u2013gel process, it has been possible to obtain highly oriented films along the (200) direction. Luminescence studies show that there is an energy transfer mechanism from Bi3+ to Eu3+, which effectively increases the light yield of the 5D0\u21927F2 transition of Eu3+. Furthermore, it was shown that the energy transfer increases as the Bi3+ concentration increases, reaching an energy transfer efficiency for Bi3+\u2192Eu3+ of 71% with 1.5 at. % Bi3+, and it was observed that the energy transfer takes place via a quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction.
