The potential clinical utility of platelet miRs in the setting of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support is unexplored. Methods: We prospectively measured the expression levels of 12 platelet miRs involved in platelet activation, coagulation, and cardiovascular diseases in LVAD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were longitudinally measured before LVAD implant and after 1, 6, and 12 months of LVAD support, and compared with those measured in healthy volunteers (controls). In silico analysis was also performed to identify pathways targeted by differentially expressed miRs. Results: Data from 15 consecutive patients and 5 controls were analyzed. Preimplant expression levels of platelet miR-126, miR-374b, miR-223, and miR320a were significantly different in patients vs. controls. The expression levels of platelet miR-25, miR-144, miR-320, and miR-451a changed significantly over the course of LVAD support; in silico analysis revealed that these miRs are implicated in both cardiac- and coagulation-associated pathways. Furthermore, the patients who suffered from bleeding (n= 5, 33%) had significantly higher pre-implant expression levels of platelet miR-151a and miR-454 with respect to the patients who did not. The same miRs were also differentially expressed in bleeders following LVAD implantation early before the clinical manifestation of the events. Discussion: This study provides a proof-of-concept evidence of significant modulation of platelet miRs expression driven by LVADs. The possible existence of a platelet miRs signature predictive of the development of bleeding events warrants further validation studies.\nKEYWORDS\nplatelets, microRNA, left ventricular assist device, hemocompatibility, heart failure\n1. Introduction\nLeft ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy improves the functional status and quality of life of patients with advanced heart failure (HF), and long-term survival with modern LVADs continues to increase (1\u20133). However, hemocompatibility-related adverse events (HRAEs), i.e., bleeding and thromboembolic complications, are frequent in LVAD patients (2, 3).\n01 frontiersin.org\nHRAEs are the result of a progressive change in the coagulation profile of the patients toward a pro-thrombotic/pro-hemorrhagic state driven by different synergic contributory mechanisms (4\u201314). Nevertheless, the lack of association between HRAEs and standard coagulation parameters highlights a critical gap in their diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. In this scenario, standardized and reliable criteria to stratify LVAD patients according to thrombotic or hemorrhagic risk are missing, and to define a patient-tailored strategy to prevent HRAEs remains a challenge. In particular, tools and biomarkers that are able to predict the derangement of platelet function toward a prothrombotic or a pro-hemorrhagic profile are not available.\nThis clinical need could be potentially met by circulating microRNAs (miRs), tiny non-coding RNAs with regulatory function on multiple target genes, which recently emerged as disease-associated biomarkers in cardiovascular diseases, including HF (15\u201317).\nTo date, the investigation on miRs in patients with LVADs is in its infancy, and studies on plasma or cardiac tissue provided heterogeneous data on their predictive potential and relationship with myocardial or vascular remodeling (18\u201322).\nPrevious studies highlighted that platelets possess a miR repertoire and processing machinery related to hypo/hyperreactivity (23), and that miR target genes could be de-repressed upon platelet activation, affecting platelet function both at gene and protein levels in individually variable manner (24). To date, the relation between platelet miRs expression in LVAD patients and occurrence of HRAEs is unexplored.\nOn this background, we analyzed, for the first time, longitudinal changes in the levels of expression of platelet miRs in the setting of LVAD support. The present study provides a proof-of-concept of the variation of platelet miRs in the setting of durable LVAD support.\nTABLE 1 List of miRs analyzed and probes for miR determination in RT-qPCR.\nmiR name miR ID hsa-miR-19b-3p 478264_mir hsa-miR-20b-5p 477804_mir hsa-miR-25-3p 477994_mir hsa-miR-126-5p 477888_mir hsa-miR-144-3p 477913_mir hsa-miR-151a-3p 477919_mir hsa-miR-223-3p 477983_mir hsa-miR-320a 478594_mir hsa-miR-374b-5p 478389_mir hsa-miR-382-5p 478078_mir hsa-miR-451a 478107_mir hsa-miR-454-3p 478329_mir hsa-miR-16-5pa 477860_mir hsa-miR-103a-3pa 478253 mir\nRT-qPCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions; miR, microRNA. aHousekeeping miR."

Whether SCN1A is a possible pathogenic player in advanced HF and might have any functional role during LVAD support deserves further dedicated investigation.\nOur data also confirm good specificity of miRs to differentiate HF patients according to clinical characteristics (Figures 2A\u2013C) (37\u201339) and provide preliminary evidence of a distinct platelet\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 06\nmiR pattern correlated with pre-implant temporary mechanical circulatory support devices (Figure 2D).

Conversely, the changes in the expression of miR-320a and miR-144, two recognized regulators of platelet reactivity, activation, signaling, and aggregation, as well as degranulation (45), did not delineate a pattern over time (Figures 3C,D), which might reflect partial and/or transient activation of platelets and deserve further investigation. We also hypothesize that lack of a clear pattern of expression over time might reflect a continuous \u201cadaptation\u201d of platelet miRs expression to the continuously evolving clinical features of the patients: as discussed earlier, platelet miRs appear to respond indeed to a complex and heterogenous pattern of stimuli. Studies evaluating further changes in platelet miRs expression over longer periods of LVAD support might contribute to clarify these phenomena.\nThe four DEmiRs shared molecular pathways including that of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), a regulator of platelet activation (46) and TNF-\u03b1 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which have been found to be involved in bleeding (47\u201350).\nOur hypothesis of a dynamic re-programming of platelet miRs toward a low pro-thrombotic (rather pro-hemorrhagic) state over the course of support is corroborated by the correlation between platelet miR-126 and D-Dimer and AT-III plasma levels: indeed, the observed negative (D-Dimer, Figure 4A) and positive (AT-III, Figure 4B) relations with miR-126 might be compatible with lack of pro-thrombotic activation and retention of mature miR-126 into platelets (51). In this regard, it is worth noting that only one patient in our cohort developed a thromboembolic complication, while five (33%) suffered from bleeding. Nevertheless, whether the increase of miR content in platelets (retention) effectively reflects low level of activation or preludes the release of pro-thrombotic miRs needs to be clarified in dedicated mechanistic studies.\nAccording to described mechanisms of genomic, molecular, cellular, and structural changes of the LVAD-unloaded left ventricle (52), we also examined possible correlations between the changes in platelet miRs expression and changes in cardiac function driven by LVAD support. In silico analysis showed different signaling pathways shared by the four DEmiRs having potential relevance in cardiac pathogenesis (Supplementary File S3). Furthermore, the positive correlation found at t3 between platelet miR-126 and LVEF (Figure 4C) confirms the prognostic role of this miR in cardiovascular disease (53), and further supports its association with cardiac function."

Previous studies demonstrated that acquired platelet dysfunction, secretion\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 09\ndefects, and impaired aggregation capability contribute to the development of bleeding in LVAD patients (9, 54\u201357). Recently, reduced pre-implant expression of platelet P-selectin and GPIIb/ IIIa has been proposed to predict bleeding while on LVAD (58).\nThe pre-implant expression levels of platelet miRs-151a and miR-454 allowed to stratify the subgroup of patients who suffered from bleeding with respect to patients who did not develop HRAEs (Figure 5). Indeed, we reasoned that thromboembolic and bleeding events might be associated with different miR patterns: accordingly, to avoid bias and enhance selective focus on bleeding events, data of the patient who suffered from stroke were excluded.\nOur data suggest the existence of a platelet miR-related fingerprint of bleeders, i.e., the retention of miR-151a\u2014classified as thrombomiR\u2014and miR-454\u2014known to be involved in the regulation of the complement cascade (59, 60). On the other hand, the potential targets of these miRs (inside vs. outside platelets) were not identified. In other words, we did not investigate whether a change in the levels of expression of these miRs effectively influences platelet function or activation or whether platelets are only acting as carriers for the miR. Accordingly, we are not proposing altered levels of expression of miRs by platelets to be at the origin of the bleeding event, rather suggesting that the platelet miRs represent novel markers of a pathogenic state (increased risk of bleeding) in some patients. Future mechanistic studies on the correlation between the expression levels of platelet miRs and traditional markers of platelet function/activation (e.g., P-selectin; CD40l and/or PF4), and on the mutual contribution of altered miR patterns and other recognized risk factors to the development of HRAEs are needed to elucidate these phenomena and provide further insights into pathophysiology of LVAD-related complications. As far as potential age-related inferences on altered expression levels of platelet miRs in bleeders is concerned, of note, age at implant was not statistically different in the two groups (bleeders vs. nonHRAEs patients).\nOn the other hand, no significant differences were found in the expression levels of platelet miR-151-a and miR-454 between bleeders and controls (p = 0.56 and p = 0.75, respectively): these data highlight the need for further analyses aimed at validating a possible contributory role of platelet miRs profile to predispose LVAD patients to HRAEs.\nDifferences in the expression levels of miR-151a and miR-451 were also observed in bleeders early before the clinical manifestation of the event (Figure 6), further corroborating their prognostic power and the clinical utility of monitoring platelet miRs in LVAD patients. Conversely, coagulation parameters were comparable in bleeders vs. HRAEs-free patients (data not shown) and did not warn for an increased risk of bleeding.\nDownregulation of platelet miR-151a in bleeders at t1 possibly indicates abundance of hypo-reactive platelets with inhibited aggregation capability (61, 62). However, the patient who suffered from bleeding at t2 showed an upregulation of mir-151a levels anticipating the event (Figure 6B). This apparent discrepancy might be explained by the different types of bleeding (Table 3) or a modulatory effect of systemic infection, as\nfrontiersin.org\ndriveline infection was concomitant in 3 out of the 7 bleeding events (43%). Moreover, we cannot exclude a contribution by other factors (e.g., adverse events not related to hemocompatibility or peculiar conditions and management strategies at the time of the event)\u2014alone or in concert\u2014to different miR-151a expression. In this regard, we emphasize that durable LVAD support is (intrinsically) a multisystemic and dynamic scenario, where features that might amplify the risk of HRAEs and impact platelet miRs expression might be present at baseline or emerge later after LVAD implantation."

In particular, studies on a larger number of patients are required to validate differences in miR patterns associated with different devices. Furthermore, the cut-off miRs expression levels that are predictive of HRAEs were not identified. Moreover, the functional role and clinical implications of some DEmiRs in the specific scenario of LVAD support were not fully elucidated, nor the associated downstream signaling pathways validated. Also, we did not investigate possible association and/ or cross-talks between altered miRs expression and different pro-thrombotic/pro-hemorrhagic risk factors in the development of HRAEs, including acquired von Willebrand syndrome and platelet activation levels, nor inferences of changes in anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy over the course of support."

            "text": "We provide a proof-of-concept evidence of significant modulation of platelet miRs expression driven by durable LVADs and suggest a potential of platelet miRs signature to identify patients at high risk for HRAEs, specifically bleeding. Indeed, we propose two miRs candidates, miR-151a and miR-454, deserving further evaluation for future clinical use. Thus, our study might have important translational relevance related to novel strategies for the prevention of HRAEs targeted to platelet miRs expression, which might overcome evident limitations of available coagulation markers, prediction algorithms, and pointof-care coagulation tests. Future studies to validate our preliminary findings are warranted.\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 10"
