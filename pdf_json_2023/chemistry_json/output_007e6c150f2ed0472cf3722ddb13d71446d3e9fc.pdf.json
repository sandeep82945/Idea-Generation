    "abstractText": "The implementation of inorganic adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from industrial effluents generates secondary waste. Therefore, scientists and environmentalists are looking for environmentally friendly adsorbents isolated from biobased materials for the efficient removal of heavy metals from industrial effluents. This study aimed to fabricate and characterize an environmentally friendly composite bio-sorbent as an initiative toward greener environmental remediation technology. The properties of cellulose, chitosan, magnetite, and alginate were exploited to fabricate a composite hydrogel bead. The cross linking and encapsulation of cellulose, chitosan, alginate, and magnetite in hydrogel beads were successfully conducted through a facile method without any chemicals used during the synthesis. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis verified the presence of element signals of N, Ca, and Fe on the surface of the composite bio-sorbents. The appearance and peak\u2019s shifting at 3330\u20133060 cm\u22121 in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of the composite cellulose\u2013magnetite\u2013alginate, chitosan\u2013magnetite\u2013alginate, and cellulose\u2013chitosan\u2013magnetite\u2013 alginate suggested that there are overlaps of O-H and N-H and weak interaction of hydrogen bonding with the Fe3O4 particles. Material degradation, % mass loss, and thermal stability of the material and synthesized composite hydrogel beads were determined through thermogravimetric analysis. The onset temperature of the composite cellulose\u2013magnetite\u2013alginate, chitosan\u2013magnetite\u2013alginate, and cellulose\u2013chitosan\u2013magnetite\u2013alginate hydrogel beads were observed to be lower compared to raw-material cellulose and chitosan, which could be due to the formation of weak hydrogen bonding resulting from the addition of magnetite Fe3O4. The higher mass residual of cellulose\u2013magnetite\u2013 alginate (33.46%), chitosan\u2013magnetite\u2013alginate (37.09%), and cellulose\u2013chitosan\u2013magnetite\u2013alginate (34.40%) compared to cellulose (10.94%) and chitosan (30.82%) after degradation at a temperature of 700 \u25e6C shows that the synthesized composite hydrogel beads possess better thermal stability, owing to the addition of magnetite and the encapsulation in the alginate hydrogel beads.",

The presence of heavy metal contamination is a\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2494. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15112494 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2494 2 of 14\nsignificant concern due to their toxicity and carcinogenic properties, posing multiple health risks to both humans and the environment [2]. The electroplating industry is one of the contributors to the high levels of heavy metal wastewater, where an electro-deposition process is commonly used for coating metals to prevent corrosion [3,4]. The adsorption process is widely employed as a common and effective method for removing heavy metals from wastewater due to its simplicity and efficiency [5]. Adsorption involves reversible attraction between particles, where a solid surface (adsorbent) removes a specific compound (adsorbate) from wastewater. Desorption, on the other hand, releases contaminants from the adsorbent, rendering it reusable for subsequent adsorption cycles [6]. Anionic polyacrylamide polymer (PAAM) is a commonly used synthetic polymer in the coagulation\u2013flocculation treatment process for industrial wastewater [7]. Although the coagulation\u2013flocculation process exhibits excellent treatment efficiency and ease of operation, it introduces a new environmental issue related to the generation and disposal of sludge waste [8,9]. Furthermore, the use of synthetic polymers in conventional industrial wastewater treatment contributes to environmental problems due to the presence of acrylamide, a carcinogenic monomer formed during degradation [10]. To address these challenges, it is crucial to implement alternative environmentally friendly materials, especially for the removal of heavy metals from industrial effluents. Natural polymers such as cellulose, chitosan, and alginate have shown remarkable properties and affinity towards heavy metal ions [11,12]. Several composite adsorbents have been developed for heavy metal removal, including those based on cellulose, chitosan, alginate, activated carbon, and zeolite [13,14]. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of cellulose, chitosan, and magnetite in removing heavy metals, motivating the exploration of these natural and readily available polymers as adsorbents [15\u201321]. While chitosan exhibits excellent heavy metal adsorption properties, it has limited mechanical strength, which can be overcome through cross linking with cellulose, leveraging its stiffness to support and reinforce the adsorbent thermally and mechanically [12,15,21,22]. Alginate facilitates the formation of hydrogel beads by cross linking with divalent ions (Ca2+), and possesses functional groups that exhibit affinity towards heavy metal cations [12,23]. The combination of the polysaccharide cellulose, chitosan, and alginate as a composite adsorbent addresses their individual stability issues [18]. The addition of magnetite to the composite hydrogel beads enhances the removal efficiency of the adsorbent from the aqueous system by utilizing a magnet, while maintaining the stability of the composite in the hydrogel form [24]. Sodium alginate is employed to encapsulate the composite materials, simplifying the formation of hydrogel beads through the cross-linking process [12,25]. The composite hydrogel bead bio-sorbent developed in this study is a cellulose\u2013 chitosan\u2013magnetite\u2013alginate composite hydrogel bead bio-sorbent (CCMA). The focus of this study is to fabricate and characterize this (CCMA) composite hydrogel bead bio-sorbent. This study aimed to address the issue by developing an environmentally friendly biosorbent through the encapsulation and cross linking of cellulose, chitosan, and magnetite Fe3O4 in the hydrogel beads of an alginate polymer matrix. By utilizing cellulose, chitosan, and magnetite encapsulation in alginate hydrogel beads, the current bio-sorbent aims to provide a more convenient and environmentally friendly alternative for heavy metal removal in wastewater."

To begin, a sodium alginate solution was prepared by combining 4 g sodium alginate powder with 200 mL ultrapure water under consistent stirring for 1 h at room temperature. Next, cellulose, chitosan, and magnetite powder were, respectively, added into the sodium alginate solution to produce CeMA, CMA, and CCMA bio-sorbent solutions. For CeMA, 2 g of cellulose powder and 0.2 g of magnetite iron (II, III) oxide powder were added into the alginate solution before undergoing stirring for 2 h at 570 rpm and 45 \u25e6C.

Then, 2 g of chitosan powder was added to the solution and it was further stirred for another 2 h under the same stirring condition. Next, for the formation of composite hydrogel beads, CeMA, CMA, and CCMA bio-sorbent solutions were, respectively, dropped into a separate beaker of 100 mL of 0.2 M calcium chloride solution using a burette at a constant speed with approximately 10 cm distance from the solution. The hydrogel beads were formed instantly and were allowed to cure in the calcium chloride solution for 24 h at room temperature. To remove excess calcium chloride, the hydrogel beads collected were rinsed with deionized water multiple times before being stored in the deionized water for further use and analysis."

ATR-FTIR (Thermo Scientific, Model: Nicolet iS10, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine the functional groups and chemical bonds that exist in CeMA, CMA, CCMA, alginate, cellulose powder, and chitosan powder. A frequency range of spectrophotometer between 4000 and 400 cm\u22121 was applied. The thermal stability of CeMA, CMA, CCMA, alginate, cellulose powder, and chitosan powder was determined using TGA (Mettler Toledo, Zurich, Switzerland).

Table 1 below shows the materials present in the formulation of CeMA, CMA, and CCMA. The moisture and mass content of materials present in individual CeMA, CMA, and CCMA composite hydrogel beads are shown in Supplementary Material S1. The mass ratio of cellulose/magnetite/alginate in CeMA was 1:0.1:2. For CMA, the mass ratio of chitosan/magnetite/alginate was 1:0.1:2, whereas, for CCMA, the mass ratio of cellulose/chitosan/magnetite/alginate was 1:1:0.1:2. Based on the calculation made (Supplementary Material S2), the individual mass content of cellulose, chitosan, magnetite,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2494 4 of 14\nand alginate in the CeMA and CMA were 0.67 mg, 0.67 mg, 0.067 mg, and 1.33 mg, respectively, while for CCMA, the individual mass content of cellulose, chitosan, magnetite, and alginate was 0.67 mg, 0.67 mg, 0.13 mg, and 1.33 mg, respectively.\nOn the other hand, the wet weight, dry weight, and moisture content were determined through the moisture analyzer at a drying temperature of 105 \u25e6C. It is worth noting that the weight of the dry hydrogel bead sample is also the reflection of the total mass content of the materials in the hydrogel bead sample. All hydrogel beads possess a high moisture content due to the characteristic of hydrogel itself, which is its high-water absorption capacity [25]. Therefore, the high wet weight compared to the dry weight of the hydrogel samples could be contributed by the water content. The weight of CCMA is noticeably higher than that of CeMA and CMA, possibly due to the addition of materials (cellulose and chitosan) in the development of CCMA. In conclusion, there was only a small number of materials (cellulose, chitosan, magnetite, alginate) utilized for the development of one hydrogel bead with a dry weight of 2.80 mg (CeMA and CMA) and 4.00 mg (CCMA). Moreover, the difference obtained in the total mass via the calculation method and the weight of the dry hydrogel bead could be due to the other material (Ca) that is present in the hydrogel bead during the formulation."

However, Zhu et al. [26] reported that the diameter of synthesized magnetic alginate hydrogel beads in a wet state was around 3.41 mm. This demonstrates that the method chosen for the synthesis of the composite hydrogel bead adsorbent can produce hydrogel beads with a consistent diameter and shape. Aside from that, a SEM analysis of cellulose, chitosan, magnetite, and alginate hydrogel beads was performed and is depicted in Figure 2. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3, the surface of CeMA, CMA, and CCMA appears rough, with many solid particles evenly distributed on it. The encapsulated cellulose, chitosan, and magnetite in the alginate polymer matrix could contribute to these solid particles. The straight crystalline with a rod-like shape of cellulose in Figure 2a can be seen on CeMA and CCMA\u2019s surface in Figure 3a,e [27]. Additionally, based on Figure 2b, chitosan with a flaky appearance was also observed on the surface of CMA and CCMA in Figure 3c,e [28]. On the other hand, the SEM image of the magnetite particle in Figure 2c shows the agglomeration of the magnetite Fe3O4. The particle agglomeration is due to the strong Van der Waals forces between the particles [11].

Furthermore, Figure 2d shows a smooth surface of the alginate hydrogel bead with no apparent solid particles on its surface.

EDX Analysis The existence of cellulose, chitosan, magnetite, and alginate in CeMA, CMA, and CCMA were further proven by the energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), where the element compositions in the CeMA, CMA, and CCMA were analyzed and discussed.\nThe elements analyses on the surface of the CeMA, CMA, and CCMA were further studied through the EDX analysis, as shown in Figure 5. Based on Figure 5a, the EDX analysis shows the elements present in CeMA. The signal for Ca is contributed by the cross linking of alginate and Ca for the formation of the hydrogel bead, whereas the Fe signal shows a successful encapsulation of magnetite Fe3O4 in the alginate polymer matrix. On the other hand, in Figure 5b, the emergence of nitrogen (N) shows the successful combination of chitosan in CMA. Figure 5c shows the elements\u2019 signals on the surface of CCMA. The N, Fe, and Ca signals show the successful encapsulation of chitosan and magnetite in the alginate polymer matrix [12,26]. In addition, the element Ca in CeMA, CMA, and CCMA also proves that an ion exchange mechanism can occur between Ca and heavy metal ions which would facilitate the removal of heavy metals [17].\n(a)\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 15\nFigure 5.

Based on previous studies, the FTIR analysis revealed that the functional groups present in the composite consisting of cellulose, chitosan, alginate, and magnetite are hydroxyls, amines, carboxyls, carbonyls, amides, and ethers (Supplementary Material S3). Based on the FTIR spectra shown in Figure 6, the magnetite shows a strong characteristic peak of the Fe-O bond at 531.04 cm\u22121. Moreover, for the cellulose spectrum, the appearance of a broad and strong peak at 3333.09 cm\u22121 corresponds to the O-H stretching [11].\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2494 10 of 14\nMeanwhile, the weak peaks at 2904.27 cm\u22121 and 1643.48 cm\u22121 can be assigned to the stretching of C-H and C=O (an asymmetrical stretch of carbonyl groups) [31]. The peak at 1427.27 cm\u22121 is assigned to the bending vibrations of CH2 at C6, whereas the peak at 1027.82 cm\u22121 is the unique characteristic of C-O-C stretching.\nIn the chitosan spectrum, the appearance of a broad and strong peak at 3355.96 cm\u22121\nindicates the overlapping of the O-H and N-H stretching [5], [32]. On the other hand, the weak stretching of C-H appeared at 2871.55 cm\u22121. The medium peak at 1655.17 cm\u22121 is assigned to the carbonyl compounds from the amide [31,33]. Meanwhile, the peaks at 1590.99 cm\u22121 and 1024.99 cm\u22121 are assigned to the N-H bending vibration from the secondary amide and the C-O-C stretching, respectively [31]. Based on Figure 7, the alginate bead spectrum shows a broad strong peak of O-H stretching at 3291.10 cm\u22121. The peaks at 1593.13 cm\u22121 and 1416.22 cm\u22121 are assigned to the carbonyl compounds from the carboxylate anions in alginate (strong asymmetrical C=O stretching and weak symmetrical C-O stretching) [31]. Additionally, the C-O-C stretch in the alginate beads appeared at the peak of 1025.40 cm\u22121. For the CeMA spectrum, the peak at 3288.15 cm\u22121 is assigned to the O-H stretching. However, the slight shift in the peaks from 3291.10 cm\u22121 (alginate beads) to 3288.15 cm\u22121 is probably due to the formation of the weak bond between O-H and Fe3O4 [34]. Moreover, the strong peaks at 1598.34 cm\u22121 and 1417.97 cm\u22121 are assigned to the carbonyl compounds from the carboxylate anions (-COO-) from alginate. However, the slight shift in the peak seen in the CeMA could be due to the increase in C-H groups from the polymer backbone of cellulose as a result of the cellulose addition into the alginate [35]. Meanwhile, the C-O-C stretch in CeMA was observed at 1026.10 cm\u22121. In the CMA spectrum, the shift observed from 3291.10 cm\u22121 (alginate beads) to 3280.61 cm\u22121 could be speculated to be (i) the overlapping of O-H from alginate and N-H from chitosan [31] or (ii) a weak bond formation of O-H and N-H with the Fe3O4 [34]. Moreover, a slight shift observed at 1596.21 cm\u22121 and 1416.41 cm\u22121 for the carbonyl compounds from the carboxylate anion groups could be due to the NH3+ groups from chitosan interacting with the -COO- (carboxylate anion) groups from alginate to form C=N (imine compound) [5,33]. A unique peak of the C-O-C stretch is observed at 1025.57 cm\u22121, which is almost identical to the C-O-C stretch in the alginate bead. For the CCMA spectrum, the slight shift observed at 3294.06 cm\u22121 could be speculated to be (i) the overlapping of the O-H stretch and N-H stretch from chitosan [32,36] or (ii) the formation of a weak bond between O-H and N-H with the Fe3O4 particles [34]. In addition, the shift observed at 1595.52 cm\u22121 and 1417.02 cm\u22121 assigned to the carbonyl compounds could be: (i) the interaction of NH3+ groups from chitosan and the -COO- (carboxylate anion) groups from alginate to form C=N (imine compound) [5,33] or (ii) an increase in C-H groups from the cellulose polymer backbone [35]. Additionally, a unique peak of the C-O-C stretch was observed at 1025.97 cm\u22121, which is almost identical to the C-O-C stretch seen in alginate beads. Interestingly, by referring to Figure 7, all peaks in the synthesized hydrogel beads resembled one another, with multiple overlapping peaks. However, the slight shift in the peaks and intensity indicates that there are multiple interactions (electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding) between the polymers [31]. Moreover, the absence of the Fe-O bond in CeMA, CMA, and CCMA indicates that the magnetite Fe3O4 only forms a weak bond on the synthesized composite hydrogel beads [34]. Despite that, the presence of magnetite on the surface of the composite hydrogel beads CeMA, CMA, and CCMA was proven through the SEM-EDX analysis conducted in the study."

Figure 8 further depicted the TGA curve of CeMA, CMA, and CCMA.

The synthesized composite bio-sorbents (CeMA, CMA, and CCMA) were proven to have a surface morphology with evenly distributed materials (cellulose, chitosan, alginate, and magnetite). Additionally, the N, Ca, and Fe element signals from the EDX results supported the presence of the materials on the surface of the composite bio-sorbents. The analysis results obtained from the FTIR spectra also supported the presence of cellulose, chitosan, alginate, and magnetite through the existence of functional groups and chemical bonds. Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of the synthesized composite hydrogel beads resembled one another, where the changes and the shift in the intensity and peaks of the spectra showed that there is the possibility of functional groups overlapping and bond formations. The existence and the slight shift in the carbonyl compounds from the carboxylate anions were contributed by alginate.
