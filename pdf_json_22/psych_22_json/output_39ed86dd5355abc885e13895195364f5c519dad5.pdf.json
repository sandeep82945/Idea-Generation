    "abstractText": "Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system contributed to the onset and development of schizophrenia (SCZ). However, there was no strong clinical evidence to link an individual FGF with SCZ. In this study, we aim to measure blood FGF9 levels in the patients with SCZ with and/or without medication, and test whether FGF9 has a potential to be a biomarker for SCZ. We recruited 130 patients with SCZ and 111 healthy individuals, and the ELISA and qRT-PCR assays were used to measure serum FGF9 levels in the participants. ELISA assay demonstrated that serum FGF9 protein levels were dramatically reduced in first-episode, drug-free patients, but not in chronically medicated patients when compared to healthy control subjects. Further analysis showed that treatment of the first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients with antipsychotics for 8 weeks significantly increased the serum FGF9 levels. In addition, we found that blood FGF9 mRNA levels were significantly lower in first-onset SCZ patients than controls. Under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the optimal cutoff values for FGF9 protein level as an indicator for diagnosis of drug-free SCZ patients was projected to be 166.4 pg/ml, which yielded a sensitivity of 0.955 and specificity of 0.86, and the area under the curve was 0.973 (95% CI, 0.954-0.993). Furthermore, FGF9 had good performance to discriminate between drug-free SCZ patients and chronically medicated patients, the optimal cutoff value for FGF9 concentration was projected to be 165.035 pg/ml with a sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.919, and the AUC was 0.968 (95% CI, 0.944, 0.991). Taken together, our results for the first time demonstrated the dysregulation of FGF9 in SCZ, and FGF9 has the potential to be served as a biomarker for SCZ.",

However, there was no strong clinical evidence to link an individual FGF with SCZ. In this study, we aim to measure blood FGF9 levels in the patients with SCZ with and/or without medication, and test whether FGF9 has a potential to be a biomarker for SCZ. We recruited 130 patients with SCZ and 111 healthy individuals, and the ELISA and qRT-PCR assays were used to measure serum FGF9 levels in the participants. ELISA assay demonstrated that serum FGF9 protein levels were dramatically reduced in first-episode, drug-free patients, but not in chronically medicated patients when compared to healthy control subjects. Further analysis showed that treatment of the first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients with antipsychotics for 8 weeks significantly increased the serum FGF9 levels. In addition, we found that blood FGF9 mRNA levels were significantly lower in first-onset SCZ patients than controls. Under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the optimal cutoff values for FGF9 protein level as an indicator for diagnosis of drug-free SCZ patients was projected to be 166.4 pg/ml, which yielded a sensitivity of 0.955 and specificity of 0.86, and the area under the curve was 0.973 (95% CI, 0.954-0.993). Furthermore, FGF9 had good performance to discriminate between drug-free SCZ patients and chronically medicated patients, the optimal cutoff value for FGF9 concentration was projected to be 165.035 pg/ml with a sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.919, and the AUC was 0.968 (95% CI, 0.944, 0.991). Taken together, our results for the first time demonstrated the dysregulation of FGF9 in SCZ, and FGF9 has the potential to be served as a biomarker for SCZ.\nKeywords: fibroblast growth factor 9, schizophrenia, antipsychotics, biomarker, first-episode, drug-free\nINTRODUCTION\nSchizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic, serious psychosis with an incidence of approximately 1% (1). The clinical manifestations are mainly emotional reactions characterized by paranoia, hallucinations and inappropriate social misconduct (2). The mechanism underlying the devastating disease is very complex and still poorly understood, although it is considered that the occurrence of the disease has a very strong relationship with genetic and the environment background (3). More recently, there\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 788677\nis increased awareness of the critical role of epigenetics in the onset and/or development of SCZ (4, 5). The typical treatments for SCZ are antipsychotics which target the neurotransmitter system in the central nervous system (6). However, long-term use of these drugs had side effects, and failed to improve the negative symptom and cognitive impairment of the patients (7, 8). In addition, it is often difficult to distinguish SCZ with other neuropsychiatric diseases due to the lack of the specific biomarkers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the etiology of SCZ and subsequently develop biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.\nThe neurotrophic factor hypothesis of schizophrenia has generated great interest over the last decade. It postulated that the disturbances of developing processes involving neurotrophic factors result in the changes in the brain of patients with SCZ (9). This hypothesis was mainly supported by the large number of preclinical and clinical studies suggesting the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor in the pathogenesis of SCZ (10\u201313). More recent studies suggested that fibroblast growth factor system is involved in the pathogenesis of SCZ. FGF2 is the most studied FGFs in the literature, which has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in neurodevelopment and maintenance of nervous system in adult (14, 15). The clinical data from Hashimoto et al. showed that blood FGF2 levels were significantly increased in the medicated patients with SCZ when compared with healthy controls, but they did not show a statistically significant difference between non-medicated patients and controls for FGF2 levels (16). In contrast, results from Li et al. indicated non-medicated SCZ patients had higher serum FGF2 levels than healthy individuals (17). In addition to FGF2, FGF9 has been proposed as a novel modulator for mood disorder, as both preclinical and clinical data indicated a role of FGF9 in depression (18, 19). Moreover, FGF9 has been suggested to be involved in the development of SCZ, this is supported by the impaired social discrimination and heightened acoustic startle reactivity in FGF9 mutant mice (20). However, there is no clinical data to support a role of FGF9 in SCZ.\nIn this study, we recruited 130 SCZ patients and 111 healthy control (HC) subjects to determine whether FGF9 levels were dysregulated in the peripheral blood of SCZ patients. Our results indicated that the levels of FGF9 in peripheral blood of SCZ patients were significantly reduced, and treatments with the antipsychotics restored the FGF9 levels in the patients. Our analyses also suggested that serum FGF9 has the potential to be served as a biomarker to inform the diagnosis and/or treatment response for SCZ."

In contrast, the serum FGF9 levels in the long-term medicated SCZ patients were not significantly different when compared with healthy controls. We also performed a longitudinal study with 19 SCZ patients, and the data suggested that short-term antipsychotics treatment may increase FGF9 levels in the blood of the patients. Further analysis indicated that blood FGF9 mRNA levels in the first-onset SCZ patients were also down-regulated. Additionally, our study indicated that gender did not significantly affect the differences of FGF9 levels between SCZ patients and controls, whereas disease severity is a confounding factor for FGF9 levels in SCZ patients. Furthermore, data from this study suggested declined PANSS positive score in SCZ patients with 8-week antipsychotics\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 788677\ntreatment, but not chronically medicated patients. It is well known that antipsychotics mainly target positive symptoms of SCZ patients, and therefore it is reasonable that PANSS positive score declined after 8-week antipsychotics treatment in the patients. However, the chronically medicated patients that we recruited were inpatients, implying that they were partially or non-response to antipsychotics for positive symptoms, and therefore it is not surprising that these patients still had high PANSS positive score. Taken together, our data provided strong clinical evidence that the onset of SCZ was accompanied by reduced blood FGF9 levels, offers a novel insight into a potential molecular pathway that confer vulnerability to the development of SCZ.\nAlthough the data from our study revealed that the onset of SCZ was accompanied by reduced blood FGF9 levels, whether insufficiency of this growth factor in SCZ contribute to the onset of the disease is unclear. Here we hypothesize that the lack of FGF9 in SCZ contributes to the disease onset, and this is supported by the increasing evidence showing the crucial roles of FGF system in neurodevelopment and mood disorders (15). In fact, the physiological and pathological roles of FGF2 in the nervous system have been extensively studied (15). More recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that FGF9 was involved in the neurodevelopment and mood disorder. Results from Seuntjens et al. showed that the fate of uncommitted precursors and generation of appropriate numbers of different neurons and glia in the neocortex were regulated by neuronto-progenitor feedback signaling, and the mechanism involved the regulation of the expression of FGF9 in the post-mitotic neurons (22). In addition, Falcone et al. indicated that FGF9 may promote astrogenesis, since they showed that the Emx2 homeobox gene-dependent repression of FGF9 in corticocerebral stem cells caused the shrinkage of the astrogenic pool (23). Beside the potential role of FGF9 in neurodevelopment, FGF9 has been proposed as a novel modulator for mood disorder. This was supported by studies showing that FGF9\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 788677\nexpression was significantly up-regulated in frontal cortex (19) and locus coeruleus (24) of patients with major depression. Consistently, animals subjected to chronic social defeat stress showed significant increase of hippocampal FGF9 expression, and administration of FGF9 increased anxiety- and depressionlike behaviors in animals, whereas knocking down FGF9 expression in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus ameliorated anxiety-like behavior (18). These results indicated that FGF9 was a modulator of negative affect for affective disorder, FGF9 thus has provided a novel therapeutic target for treatment of depression. More recently, Garrett et al. generated FGF9Y162C mutant mice to analyze the role of FGF9 in brain functions, they discovered that the mutant mice had heightened acoustic startle reactivity and impaired social discrimination (20), therefore evidence from in vivo animal study suggested lacking of FGF9 activity may contribute to the etiology of SCZ. More interestingly, our results showed that antipsychotics increased serum FGF9 levels in SCZ patients. Although the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation has not been addressed in the study, one possible explanation is the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This speculation is due to the findings that antipsychotics significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in SCZ patients (11), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor has been reported increasing growth factor expression in vitro (25). Nevertheless, future studies are necessary to explore the exact roles of FGF9 in the onset and development of SCZ.\nBiomarker has been defined as \u201ca characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological response\u201d (26). Therefore, great efforts have been made over the last several decades to identify biomarkers for the major psychiatric diseases including SCZ (27), in hope of better understanding the etiologies of these devastating diseases, providing objective measurements for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response of the diseases. Although no reliable and validated biomarkers have been established for the major psychiatric diseases, potential biomarkers from blood have been extensively studied since it is easily accessible and cost-effective, and these efforts have led to some promising biomarkers for the diseases. As an example is a test called VeriPsych, which measured 51 blood analytes (small molecules and proteins), was available in 2010 from a company. This panel of biomarkers reported a specificity and sensitivity of 83% to distinguish SCZ patients from controls, and the ROC-AUC was 89% (28). However, this assay had been withdrawn from the market partly due to the specificity issue and the high cost (2500 US dollars) (27). In this study we have used a simple ELISA assay and demonstrated that blood FGF9 differentiated SCZ patients from control subjects with a sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 86%, and ROC-AUC of 97.3%, suggesting that FGF9 has the potential to provide excellent diagnostic accuracy for SCZ. In addition, data from our study also demonstrated that peripheral blood FGF9 had good performance to discriminate between firstonset SCZ patients and chronically medicated patients with a sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.919, suggesting FGF9 has the potential to be used as a biomarker for the treatment response of SCZ patients. However, one limitation of our study is the limited sample size of SCZ patients with 8-week antipsychotics treatment, although our analysis suggested that blood FGF9 had a reasonable performance in discriminating between first-onset SCZ patients and short-term (8-week) treated SCZ patients (data not shown). Therefore, further investigations into the peripheral blood FGF9 levels in SCZ patients are necessary to translate the potential blood biomarker into practical clinical use.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 788677"
