Bioisosteres are the structurally different compounds that mimic the essential pharmacophoric characteristics of a reference compound to display similar biological actions.8 This concept has been extremely valuable in facilitating the development of safer and more effective pharmaceutical agents.9 Exploration of bioisosteres in the context of well-established antihypertensive drug like amlodipine offers an intriguing opportunity to ne-tune its structural and pharmacological characteristics.\n1,4-Dihydropyridine based drugs such as amlodipine are the Ca2+ antagonists10 that are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.

Specically, 1,4-dihydropyridines are primarily used to treat hypertension and are considered to act as allosteric modulators that inuence L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels activation.11 Binding of 1,4- dihydropyridines to receptors in L-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channel inhibits the entry of Ca2+ ions through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels into both the cardiac and vascular smooth muscles.12 The target proteins CavAb complex and calmodulin were procured from the X-ray crystallographic data as reported by Tang et al.13 and Johnson C. N. et al.,14 respectively to successfully establish the in silico efficiency of our candidates as promising anti-hypertensive agents.\nThe present study undertakes a comprehensive exploration of newer 1,4-dihydropyridine based amlodipine bioisosteres incorporating molecular design, synthetic methodologies, and advanced computational analysis (Fig. 1). In particular, the in silico evaluation, the fundamental aspect of this study plays a pivotal role in analyzing the critical features of the synthesized hybrids, including their binding interactions with target proteins, pharmacokinetic characteristics and potential therapeutic efficacy.15 This approach not only accelerates the drug\n34240 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34239\u201334248\ndiscovery process but also reduces the risks and resource expenditures involved with traditional trial-and-error methods.

In case of docking interactions of P5 with 6M7H, the indole ring is involved in a number of interactions, namely; Pi\u2013Sigma, Pi\u2013sulfur, Pi\u2013Pi T shaped, and Pi-alkyl interactions with amino acid residues MSE124, LEU105, MSE144, PHE92, VAL136, and ALA128, respectively as depicted in Fig. 8. Further, Pi\u2013Pi T shaped and Pi-alkyl interactions with GLU84 and ALA88, respectively are also exhibited by the chlorobenzene ring of P5 along with the Pi\u2013alkyl interactions of LEU112 with the triazole ring. Fig. 9 demonstrates the binding interactions of P7 with 6M7H, showing the Pi\u2013alkyl interactions of uorobenzene and chlorobenzene ring with ALA128, and ALA88, respectively. Fluorobenzene ring is also associated with the Pi\u2013Pi T-shaped interactions with PHE92, along with Pi\u2013Sigma interactions with MSE144 and LEU105. Residues MSE109 and MSE145 are involved in Pi\u2013sulfur interactions with the triazole ring of P7.\nThe docking investigations for all the synthesized compounds P1\u2013P14 demonstrated superior binding affinities\nFig. 11 Demonstration of the structure activity relationship of the synth\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nwhen compared to the standard amlodipine in case of both the proteins, particularly, P7 exhibited the highest binding affinities with 5KMD and 6M7H, underscoring the signicance of these bioisosteres as potential leads for effective antihypertensive activity (Fig. 10).\n3.3 In silico structure activity relationship (SAR) assessment\nThe structure activity relationship is a fundamental concept in drug design that is used to comprehend the relationship between the chemical structure of a compound and its pharmacological activity. Its ultimate goal is to optimize the chemical structure of a compound in order to maximize its intended pharmacological activity while minimizing undesired side effects.22 As evident from the computational evaluation of the synthesized amlodipine bioisosteres P1\u2013P14, hybrids containing heteroaryl rings tethered via triazole linkage (P1\u2013P5) exhibited excellent binding affinity and remarkable interactions with the amino acid residues in case of both the proteins 5KMD and 6M7H as compared to the hybrids possessing the aryl\nesized 1,4-dihydropyridine based amlodipine bioisosteres P1\u2013P14.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34239\u201334248 | 34247\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

However, aryl linked hybrids were found to be in accordance with the Lipinski rule and have shown high GI absorption. In contrast, P1\u2013P5 heteroaryl ring containing hybrids displayed two violations in Lipinski rule with low GI absorption (Fig. 11). Hence, it can be inferred that despite of better binding affinity of P1\u2013P5, hybrids P6\u2013P14 possess druglike attributes and can serve as lead for future investigations. Better computational results than the standard drug amlodipine suggest that the existence of triazole tethered aryl/ heteroaryl ring is essential for the manifestation of pharmacological attributes associated with anti-hypertensive activity."

            "text": "In conclusion, this study represents a signicant advancement in the quest for innovative antihypertensive medications. A promising series of 1,4-dihydropyridine based scaffolds were developed as prospective replacements to amlodipine through a meticulous approach encompassing strategic design, synthesis and extensive in silico evaluation. This comprehensive study involved the use of crystallography, molecular docking, ADMET proling, and analysis of Structure Activity Relationships (SAR). The examination of crystal structure provided valuable structural insights, laying the foundation for subsequent computational evaluations. The existence of triazole appended aryl/heteroaryl linkage was substantiated by the better molecular docking results with the concerned calcium channels as compared to amlodipine. ADMET and SAR evaluation uncovered pivotal insights for the future renement of antihypertensive activity. Furthermore, excellent binding affinity, high GI absorption, no BBB permeance, and the druglikeliness nature of the synthesized bioisosteres, especially P6\u2013 P10, P12 and P14 as established from the in silico ADMET assessments, suggest their suitability for further development. In particular, P7 showcased extraordinary in silico proling and its crystal structure manifests the molecular interactions with biological systems. This collective effort establishes a robust foundation for the progression and potential clinical applications of these candidates, signalling a promising avenue in antihypertensive drug discovery. In essence, this research signicantly contributes to the growing panorama of innovative therapeutics by offering prospective solutions for hypertension management and underscoring the importance of exploring novel bioisosteres in drug design and development.\nAccession codes\nCCDC 2294665 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for ligand S1 for this paper.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no conicts of interests.\n34248 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34239\u201334248"
