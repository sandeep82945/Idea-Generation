In this study, we hypothesized that efflux transporter inhibition of a compound can be predicted by an intracellular metabolic signature in Caco-2 cells in the assay used to test intestinal permeability. Using selective inhibitors and transporter knock-out (KO) cells and a targeted Liquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) method, we identified 11 metabolites increased in cells with depleted P-glycoprotein (Pgp) activity. Four metabolites were altered with Breast Cancer Resistance (BCRP) inhibition and nine metabolites were identified in the Multidrug Drug Resistance Protein 2 (MRP2) signature. A scoring system was created that could discriminate among the three transporters and validated with additional inhibitors. Pgp and MRP2 substrates did not score as inhibitors. In contrast, BCRP substrates and inhibitors showed a similar intracellular metabolomic signature. Network analysis of signature metabolites led us to investigate changes of enzymes in one-carbon metabolism (folate and methionine cycles). Our data shows that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) protein levels increased with Pgp inhibition and Thymidylate synthase (TS) protein levels were reduced with Pgp and MRP2 inhibition. In addition, the methionine cycle is also affected by both Pgp and MRP2 inhibition. In summary, we demonstrated that the routine Caco-2 assay has the potential to identify efflux transporter inhibitors in parallel with substrates in the assays currently used in many DMPK laboratories and that inhibition of efflux transporters has biological consequences.",

            "text": "Membrane transporters play a significant role in cellular homeostasis by regulating the uptake of nutrients and transport of endogenous metabolites [1]. The human genome comprises more than 400 transporters, which are classified into two major subfamilies: the solute carrier (SLC) family and the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family [2,3]. SLC transporters facilitate the transport of small molecules down their gradients across the cell membrane. Conversely, ABC transporters are mainly involved in the efflux of molecules. The activity of ABC transporters is dependent on the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis [2,4]. The evaluation of human pharmacokinetics such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of new chemical compounds is of critical importance in the drug development process [5]. The role of drug transporters in determining the pharmacokinetics of new chemical entities is well established as transporter mediated uptake or efflux of drugs can have a major influence on the bioavailability, distribution, clearance and toxicity of these compounds [6]. These drug transporters are widely distributed among different organs, including the liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney, where they mediate important\nCells 2022, 11, 3286. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11203286 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nCells 2022, 11, 3286 2 of 20\nfunctions including intestinal absorption and biliary and renal excretion [6]. In addition, the complementary interaction between drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters can also contribute to altered pharmacokinetics of the substrate compounds. There is an overlap in substrate specificity of Pgp and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzyme, and the functional interaction between both proteins has been shown to affect oral bioavailability of some agents [7\u20139]. Hence, xenobiotic interaction with a drug transporter can determine the availability of orally administered drugs to systemic circulation, and may potentially alter the uptake or clearance of a drug. The uptake and efflux transporters can also determine the penetration of drugs into tumor cells or critical organs such as the brain, suggesting an important role of drug transporters in effecting a drug response. Overall, these transporters play an important role in pharmacologically and physiologically important barriers such as the blood\u2013brain barrier, kidney, intestine and liver [6,10]. There is accumulating evidence highlighting the significance of drug transporters in drug\u2013drug interactions (DDI) [3]. The concomitant administration of drugs can lead to adverse side effects, which is mainly attributable to the ability of many of these compounds to serve as drug transporter inhibitors [11]. Regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), provide guidelines regarding in vitro experimental approaches that could be used to elucidate any drug\u2013drug interactions and their mechanisms [12]. In a guidance document by the FDA, emphasis is placed on the evaluation of Pgp, BCRP, and other uptake transporters, as there is substantial evidence of the involvement of these transporters in drug interactions [12]. Various cardiovascular drugs have been described as substrates or inhibitors of Pgp; co-administration of these drugs is associated with increased risk of bleeding and other toxicities [13,14]. In addition, BCRP and MRP2 have also been implicated in drug\u2013drug interactions, altering the pharmacokinetics of clinically important compounds such as methotrexate and rosuvastatin [15,16]. Membrane transporters are also involved in the elimination of toxins and transport of endogenous metabolites [2,17]. There is growing interest in exploring metabolite transporter interactions, as impaired transporter function may lead to intrinsic toxicity. ABC transporters, including BSEP, MRP2, MRP3 and MRP4, are involved in the biliary secretion of bile acids and inhibition of these transporters can result in increased hepatocellular bile acid concentrations, which may induce liver injury [1,18]. Hence, appropriate investigations should be carried out to determine whether a new drug is a substrate or an inhibitor of a clinically significant drug transporter [12]. Pgp, BCRP and MRP2 are key efflux transporters expressed in different intestinal segments including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon. Pgp is more abundantly expressed in distal intestinal segments, an arcuate expression pattern is described for BCRP with a higher expression towards the end of small intestine, whereas MRP2 showed decreased expression pattern from proximal to distal intestinal regions in rats [19]. Caco-2 is a human colon carcinoma cell line that forms a polarized epithelial cell monolayer when cultured on a transwell plate. These cells show high functional and morphological similarity to the cells of the small intestinal epithelium, and express major uptake and efflux transporters on the apical and basal membranes, including the key efflux transporters Pgp, BCRP and MRP2 in the apical membrane, making them suitable for high-throughput drug permeability screening for the prediction of human intestinal permeability and for the identification of potential efflux transporter substrates [20\u201322]. This assay is routinely used in most DMPK laboratories to test the permeability of compounds following transport from the apical and basolateral side. The Caco-2 monolayer can also be used to evaluate transporter inhibition by monitoring the efflux of probe substrates in the presence and absence of the potential inhibitor [12,21]. The intracellular content is not routinely investigated using these assays. We previously mentioned that endogenous metabolites are also substrates for these transporters [1]. These metabolites could potentially be affected by the inhibition of drug transporters or by competition with another substrate. In addition, transporter inhibition may have an impact on cellular metabolism. We hypothesized that an intracellular metabolomic signature has the potential to indicate inhibition of Pgp, BCRP and MRP2 in\nCells 2022, 11, 3286 3 of 20\nthe format of the routine Caco-2 assay used to test intestinal permeability. In the routine Caco-2 functional assay, throughput is reduced with the use of probes substrates. With our current approach, additional information regarding efflux transporter inhibition can be obtained without compromising the throughput. Using a single semi-quantitative LC-MS metabolomic assay, we compared the intracellular metabolites in cells treated with selective inhibitors of Pgp, BCRP or MRP2 and control cells and in Caco-2 cells where these transporters have been knocked out. These findings are further validated with additional inhibitors and examined in the context of the physiological significance of inhibition of these transporters."

            "text": "The Caco-2 monolayer is widely used as a model for predicting intestinal absorption and assessing drug transporter interactions by numerous drug development groups [21]. In this study, we used a targeted metabolomics approach to identify metabolomic changes associated with Pgp, BCRP and MRP2 transporter inhibition in Caco-2 cells in a format currently used in many laboratories. We identified 11 metabolites associated with Pgp inhibition, four metabolites indicative of BCRP inhibition, and nine metabolites altered with MRP2 inhibition. These metabolic alterations predominantly resulted from altered transporter activity, as these metabolite changes were recapitulated with transporter inhibition with several compounds of varied chemical classes and biological targets and in transporter KO cells. Changes in these metabolites were used to build a scoring system to predict inhibition of these transporters. This scoring system was assessed with additional inhibitors and substrates. We were able to show that the scoring system could discriminate between substrates and inhibitors of Pgp and MRP2 but could not discriminate between substrates and inhibitors of BCRP. We then carried out a protein metabolite network analysis of the metabolites identified by our single LC-MS method and found that, interestingly, they were closely linked to what has been reported on metabolites and enzymes in the literature (Supplementary Figure S8). Intracellular levels of pyridoxine, glutamine, arginine, creatinine, leucine, methylcysteine, phenylalanine, methionine, threonine, nicotinamide and pantothenate increased with Pgp inhibition and KO in our experiments. None of these metabolites have been described to be Pgp substrates in the literature. Only steroids, lipids, bilirubin and bile acids are characterized as physiological substrates of Pgp [1]. Hence, the metabolites identified in our experiments may not be direct substrates of Pgp, and these metabolic alterations could be a secondary response to transporter inhibition. In a study with BCRP/Pgp double knock-out rats, metabolites including creatinine, threonine, pantothenate, glutamine, phenylalanine, methionine and nicotinamide were identified to be altered in CSF or plasma; however, none of these metabolites could be indicated as Pgp substrates based on in silico prediction of Pgp interaction [38]. Although this study highlighted the impact of BCRP and Pgp ablation on systemic metabolome rather than intracellular changes, it is interesting to identify alterations in identical metabolites in CSF which suggests the significance of these metabolites and associated metabolic pathways in a neurological context. Notably, it is intriguing to observe elevation of methionine and phenylalanine in Caco-2 cells with Pgp inhibition, as elevation of these two metabolites is associated with neurotoxic effects [39,40]. In one study, methionine-enriched diet in mice resulted in increased aggregated levels of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-peptides, increased neuroinflammation, and increased oxidative stress, all promoting the development of Alzheimer\u2019s-like neurodegeneration [40]. In addition, several neurotoxic features of hyperphenylalaninemia were reported in a study by Kim J et al., where high concentrations of phenylalanine resulted in apoptosis in cerebral organoids and also affected myelin expression [39]. Metabolite\u2013disease analysis performed using our signature metabolites also indicated a link with methionine, phenylalanine, creatinine, leucine, glutamine and arginine to a few neurological pathologies (Supplementary Figure S4). These observations are interesting, as neurotoxicity was also observed in clinical trials designed to test the efficacy of zosuquidar against multidrug resistance [41]. However, it should be noted that metabolic alterations reported in our experiments are observed in a colon carcinoma cell line, and further evidence is required to link these metabolic alterations to neurological toxicities observed in clinical trials with Pgp inhibition. In the case of MRP2 inhibition and MRP2 KO arginine, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, threonine, serine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, pantothenate, alanine, carnitine levels increased, whereas Acetylcarnitine DL decreased in cells. Previously, bilirubin and its conjugates, sulfated bile salts, leukotriene C4, S-glutathionyl-estradiol, cholecystokinin and ethinylestradiol-3-O-glucuronide, were characterized as endogenous substrates of MRP2, which further suggests that the metabolites identified in our experiments could be a secondary response to MRP2 inhibition [1]. Among these metabolites, S-adenosyl-L-\nCells 2022, 11, 3286 14 of 20\nhomocysteine, serine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine are involved in methionine metabolism (Figure 4D). In addition, network analysis revealed an association between tetrahydrofolate and MRP2 signature metabolites including threonine, alanine and S-adenosyl-Lhomocysteine. Tetrahydrofolate is also directly associated with MRP2 transporter in public databases (Figures 4C and S8). Collectively, this suggests that MRP2 inhibition may have an impact on folate and the methionine metabolism pathway (Figure 4D). The metabolites that showed consistent changes with all three BCRP inhibitors and the knockout cells were hypoxanthine, xanthine, glutamate and pantothenate. According to the literature, dietary flavonoids, porphyrins and uric acid are known substrates of the BCRP transporter; however, these metabolites were either not measured in this assay, or their concentration was too low for analytical detection [2]. Hypoxanthine and xanthine are important components of the purine metabolism pathway. Hypoxanthine is converted to xanthine, and later to uric acid by the activity of xanthine oxidase [30,42]. BCRP is a high-capacity low-affinity uric acid transporter, playing an important role in the regulation of urate homeostasis by mediating renal and intestinal uric acid secretion [43]. Urinary excretion is the predominant elimination route of uric acid [31,44]. Although uric acid was not detected in Caco-2 cells under our analytical/experimental conditions, our network analysis still identified the association between BCRP and uric acid generation pathway. In a study, it was demonstrated that treatment with hypoxanthine results in reduced homodimer levels of BCRP transporter. This was suggested to be mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased reactive oxygen species production by xanthine oxidase [42]. Moreover, reduced plasma membrane BCRP localization has been observed in hyperuricemia, allowing the accumulation of uric acid and preventing its excretion [42,45]. In one study, Ganguly et al. reported elevated CSF levels of a few purine metabolism metabolites in rats lacking Pgp and BCRP transporters [38]. It is still not clear how BCRP inhibition results in reduced cellular hypoxanthine and xanthine levels however one possible explanation is that it could be a compensatory response induced by impaired uric acid transport to reduce uric acid production. Network analysis identified Pgp signature metabolites including methionine, pyridoxine and nicotinamide to be linked with the MTHFR gene. STRING analysis also confirmed a direct link between MTHFR, Pgp and MRP2 transporters (Figure 2B). In the literature, the role of efflux transporters in the maintenance of cellular folate homeostasis has been demonstrated. While there is enough evidence to suggest the involvement of efflux transporters in folic acid transport, the expression of the efflux transporters was also shown to be modulated by cellular folate levels [46\u201348]. Hence, we investigated changes in protein expression of the key enzymes involved in folate metabolism to better understand the impact of efflux transporter inhibition on folate metabolism. We found alterations in the protein expression of MTHFR and thymidylate synthase with efflux transporter inhibition. MTHFR is a critical branch point of one-carbon metabolism, as it links folate metabolism and the methionine cycle in one-carbon metabolism. MTHFR is involved in the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate [35]. Homocysteine is then methylated to methionine by methionine synthase, using 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate in this methylation process [36,37]. Due to MTHFR playing a key function in the one-carbon cycle, changes in MTHFR expression or activity can have a significant impact on methionine metabolism. Polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene, especially C677T is associated with reduced enzymatic activity of MTHFR [49]. This polymorphism disrupts one carbon metabolism and results in high homocysteine levels [50]. Furthermore, MTHFR polymorphism-induced hyperhomocystenemia can lead to several toxicities including neurotoxicity by promoting neurotransmitter imbalance [49\u201352]. We observed a significant increase in MTHFR protein levels with Pgp inhibition and Pgp KO (Figure 6). A reduction in MTHFR expression was observed with BCRP inhibition and BCRP KO. A significant decrease in MTHFR expression was also observed with MRP2 inhibition; however, the MRP2 KO exhibited an increase in MTHFR expression (Figure 6). The differences observed with MRP2 Inhibition and MRP2 KO could be due to non-selective interaction of MK571\nCells 2022, 11, 3286 15 of 20\nwith other transporters. In addition, the differences between the inhibition and KO could also partially be explained by ABC transporters having multiple drug binding sites. Hence, the transport inhibition and KO could be seen as two different systems, where the inhibitor could only be interacting with one binding site, whereas in the KO cells, all the transporter binding sites are absent, and hence the two systems may have different effects on signaling networks [53,54] Thymidylate synthase catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) which is important for DNA synthesis [55]. As thymidylate synthase plays an important role in cell proliferation, it has been described as an important chemotherapeutic target in oncology [55,56]. Our data show thymidylate synthase protein expression to be significantly reduced by Pgp and MRP2 inhibition over 24 h. However, an increase in thymidylate synthase expression was observed with all three transporter KO, which could be an adaptive response to KO to sustain proliferation of cells lacking efflux transporters (Supplementary Figure S10). We also investigated changes in the protein expression of the enzymes from the methionine cycle to determine whether the metabolic alterations observed with the inhibitors were mediated by changes in the expression of these enzymes. AHCY is involved in the conversion of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine to homocysteine [57]. We observed a significant reduction in the expression of AHCY with MRP2 inhibition which could be the possible reason an increase in S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine was observed with MRP2 inhibition. Conversely, we observed an increase in AHCY levels in MRP2 KO cells despite still observing an increase in S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine levels with MRP2 KO (Supplementary Figure S10). Notably, in the MRP2 KO cells, we observed a decrease in pyridoxine levels, which is an important cofactor of the Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase enzyme, involved in the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine (Supplementary Figure S10) [57]. Since the chemical reaction catalyzed by AHCY is reversible, lower pyridoxine levels and the reaction equilibrium could favor the production of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine which could be a possible reason behind higher levels of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [58]. This is consistent with a study in which AHCY overexpression in Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase-deficient mice did not alter the ratio of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine to homocysteine [58]. However, we were unable to measure homocysteine and cystathionine under our analytical conditions and therefore are unable to make any conclusion on Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase activity or AHCY reverse reaction. SHMT1 catalyzes the reversable conversion of serine to glycine [59]. Cytoplasmic SHMT has also been described as a metabolic switch, as it produces 5,10-methylene THF from serine and tetrahydrofolate, which is directed to thymidylate synthase for nucleotide synthesis [59,60]. We observed a significant reduction in SHMT1 protein expression with MRP2 inhibition, which may have led to an increase in serine observed with MRP2 inhibition. However, the KO cells had higher levels of serine, despite higher levels of SHMT1 (Supplementary Figure S10). Serine is also involved in the production of cystathionine from homocysteine, which is catalyzed by Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase [57]. The increase in serine in MRP2 KO cells may also be explained by lower pyridoxine levels in MRP2 KO which may affect the reaction involving Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase and serine levels. However, serine can be produced in cells from multiple cellular reactions, including the degradation of proteins, transamination from glycine, and de novo synthesis from glucose, and can be obtained from the extracellular environment [61\u201363]. Hence, other sources may also be contributing to altered serine levels in cells by both MRP2 inhibition and KO. With Pgp inhibition, an increase in MTHFR and methionine synthase protein expression raises possibility that Pgp inhibition may have induced the flux of 1-carbon units to the methionine cycle at the expense of nucleotide synthesis as suggested by reduction in thymidylate synthase [60]. Reduction in SHMT1 and thymidylate synthase by MRP2 inhibition also suggest a reduction in nucleotide synthesis as SHMT1 directs folate towards nucleotide synthesis [60]. However, further investigation is required to validate the functional ramifications associated with the enzyme-level changes observed in our study, as\nCells 2022, 11, 3286 16 of 20\nwe were unable to measure folates and some metabolites associated with these enzymes under our analytical conditions. In addition, further studies will also aid in unravelling the underlying mechanisms behind these protein alterations, and any associated signaling networks by efflux transporter inhibition. From the summary heatmap it can be inferred that some of the metabolic alterations may not be specific to one transporter, and we observed some overlap between Pgp and MRP2 signature metabolites. For example, arginine and threonine increased with both Pgp and MRP2 inhibition, and pantothenate increased with all three transporter inhibitors. This overlap could be attributed to lack of specificity of MRP2 inhibitors used in experiments. However, Pgp and MRP2 interaction with folate/methionine metabolism also explains why we have an overlap in Pgp and MRP2 signature, as both transporters could be associated with similar metabolic pathways. In addition, the possibility of dual Pgp/MRP2 interaction is further endorsed by gene-network analysis, which shows the link between the two transporters (Pgp and MRP2) with common metabolites, hinting at either the transport of identical metabolites by both transporters or interaction with common signaling networks (Supplementary Figure S8). Therefore, a scoring system was developed to generate a numerical outcome of the different inhibitors based on previously defined ranges that can help to evaluate transporter inhibitor interactions. Although the scoring system requires further validation with more substrates, inhibitors and non substrates, we identified key ranges that could indicate a chemical entity as a Pgp, BCRP or MRP2 inhibitor. We also tested the scoring system and associated ranges with additional Pgp, BCRP and MRP2 inhibitors (Figure 5C). Among these inhibitors, elacridar induced the strongest Pgp inhibition, and therefore generated a high Pgp score. Meanwhile, chlorpromazine had a weaker interaction with Pgp compared to other inhibitors, and therefore generated a lower score. BCRP scores for additional BCRP inhibitors and MRP2 scores for additional MRP2 inhibitors were also within our defined ranges. In addition, the scoring system was validated with known substrates of Pgp, BCRP and MRP2 to determine whether the signature metabolites only indicate an interaction with a specific transporter or have the potential to distinguish between the substrates and inhibitors of these transporters (Supplementary Figure S9). We obtained a lower Pgp/MRP2 score for Pgp and MRP2 substrates in comparison to the inhibitors, which implies that our scoring system can distinguish between the inhibitors from substrates for Pgp and MRP2. However, the BCRP substrates also generated a negative BCRP score, which was in a similar range to that of the inhibitors. The BCRP signature has fewer metabolites, and therefore the BCRP signature/score is weaker compared with Pgp and MRP2. Hence, the current BCRP signature can only indicate an interaction with BCRP without identification of the compound as a BCRP inhibitor or substrate. It should also be noted that a major limitation of using this metabolomics approach in drug discovery could be that some compounds may have a pharmacological effect on purine, folate or methionine metabolism, which may give a false positive score and indicate potential transporter interaction. In addition, we observed that our scoring system is more effective for higher-affinity inhibitors compared with less selective inhibitors (for example, an inhibitor might be inhibiting two different transporters, but the score may only indicate interaction with one transporter). Nevertheless, this method can still serve as a new tool for gaining insight into potential drug\u2013transporter interactions and associated metabolic/signaling changes that could be investigated further using traditional transporter specific efflux assays."
