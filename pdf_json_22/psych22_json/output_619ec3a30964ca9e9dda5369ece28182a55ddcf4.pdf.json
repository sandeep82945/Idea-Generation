    "abstractText": "Background: Youth and young adults face barriers to mental health care, including a shortage of programs that accept youth and a lack of developmentally sensitive programming among those that do. This shortage, along with the associated geographically limited options, has contributed to the health disparities experienced by youth in general and by those with higher acuity mental health needs in particular. Although intensive outpatient programs can be an effective option for youth with more complex mental health needs, place-based intensive outpatient programming locations are still limited to clients who have the ability to travel to the clinical setting several days per week. Objective: The objective of the analysis reported here was to assess changes in depression between intake and discharge among youth and young adults diagnosed with depression attending remote intensive outpatient programming treatment. Analysis of outcomes and the application of findings to programmatic decisions are regular parts of ongoing quality improvement efforts of the program whose results are reported here. Methods: Outcomes data are collected for all clients at intake and discharge. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) adapted for adolescents is used to measure depression, with changes between intake and discharge regularly assessed for quality improvement purposes using repeated measures t tests. Changes in clinical symptoms are assessed using McNamar chi-square analyses. One-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among age, gender, and sexual orientation groups. For this analysis, 1062 cases were selected using criteria that included a diagnosis of depression and a minimum of 18 hours of treatment over a minimum of 2 weeks of care. Results: Clients ranged in age from 11 to 25 years, with an average of 16 years. Almost one-quarter (23%) identified as nongender binary and 60% identified as members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+) community. Significant decreases (mean difference \u20136.06) were seen in depression between intake and discharge (t967=\u201324.68; P<.001), with the symptoms of a significant number of clients (P<.001) crossing below the clinical cutoff for major depressive disorder between intake and discharge (388/732, 53%). No significant differences were found across subgroups defined by age (F2,958=0.47; P=.63), gender identity (F7,886=1.20; P=.30), or sexual orientation (F7,872=0.47; P=.86). Conclusions: Findings support the use of remote intensive outpatient programming to treat depression among youth and young adults, suggesting that it may be a modality that is an effective alternative to place-based mental health treatment. Additionally, findings suggest that the remote intensive outpatient program model may be an effective treatment approach for youth from marginalized groups defined by gender and sexual orientation. This is important given that youth from these groups tend to have poorer outcomes and greater barriers to treatment compared to cisgender, heterosexual youth.

            "text": "Background: Youth and young adults face barriers to mental health care, including a shortage of programs that accept youth and a lack of developmentally sensitive programming among those that do. This shortage, along with the associated geographically limited options, has contributed to the health disparities experienced by youth in general and by those with higher acuity mental health needs in particular. Although intensive outpatient programs can be an effective option for youth with more complex mental health needs, place-based intensive outpatient programming locations are still limited to clients who have the ability to travel to the clinical setting several days per week.\nObjective: The objective of the analysis reported here was to assess changes in depression between intake and discharge among youth and young adults diagnosed with depression attending remote intensive outpatient programming treatment. Analysis of outcomes and the application of findings to programmatic decisions are regular parts of ongoing quality improvement efforts of the program whose results are reported here.\nMethods: Outcomes data are collected for all clients at intake and discharge. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) adapted for adolescents is used to measure depression, with changes between intake and discharge regularly assessed for quality improvement purposes using repeated measures t tests. Changes in clinical symptoms are assessed using McNamar chi-square analyses. One-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among age, gender, and sexual orientation groups. For this analysis, 1062 cases were selected using criteria that included a diagnosis of depression and a minimum of 18 hours of treatment over a minimum of 2 weeks of care.\nResults: Clients ranged in age from 11 to 25 years, with an average of 16 years. Almost one-quarter (23%) identified as nongender binary and 60% identified as members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+) community. Significant decreases (mean difference \u20136.06) were seen in depression between intake and discharge (t967=\u201324.68; P<.001), with the symptoms of a significant number of clients (P<.001) crossing below the clinical cutoff for major depressive disorder between intake and discharge (388/732, 53%). No significant differences were found across subgroups defined by age (F2,958=0.47; P=.63), gender identity (F7,886=1.20; P=.30), or sexual orientation (F7,872=0.47; P=.86).\nConclusions: Findings support the use of remote intensive outpatient programming to treat depression among youth and young adults, suggesting that it may be a modality that is an effective alternative to place-based mental health treatment. Additionally, findings suggest that the remote intensive outpatient program model may be an effective treatment approach for youth from marginalized groups defined by gender and sexual orientation. This is important given that youth from these groups tend to have poorer outcomes and greater barriers to treatment compared to cisgender, heterosexual youth.\nJMIR Form Res 2023 | vol. 7 | e44756 | p. 1https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e44756 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\n(JMIR Form Res 2023;7:e44756) doi: 10.2196/44756"

            "text": "Approximately 3 million youths were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) in 2019 [1], of whom 18% received treatment in that same year [2]. While micro-level factors undoubtedly contribute to low treatment rates at the individual level, treatment availability presents a structural barrier to all youth, particularly for those with crisis level or complex mental health needs. Such barriers include a lack of access to hospital-based treatment, with only 39% of hospital-based facilities nationwide serving youth younger than 18 years [3] and excessive wait times in youth-serving facilities averaging 6-8 weeks. A third barrier involves access to developmentally appropriate treatment, with only 36% of mental health programs designed specifically for children and adolescents, and only 22% designed for transition-age young adults [4]. Youth and young adults living in rural counties face even greater barriers, with only 1% of hospital-based facilities serving youth younger than 18 years located in rural areas [3]. These barriers reflect a worldwide neglect of adolescent mental health and contribute to the greater vulnerability faced by youth relative to other age groups [5]. One approach to reducing these barriers is the provision of mental health treatment via telehealth or remote platforms. The purpose of the assessment reported here was to test the preliminary effectiveness of remote intensive outpatient programming (IOP) in treating depression in youth with high acuity mental health diagnoses."

            "heading": "Treating High Acuity Youth: IOP",
            "text": "IOP is an alternative model to inpatient care for youth with needs greater than those that can be served in traditional outpatient services. Youth attending IOP spend upwards of 15 hours per week in individual, family, and group treatment sessions with a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including mental health clinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and social workers), medical professionals (nurses and dietitians), and specialists trained in a variety of therapies such as art and recreational therapy [6]. Recent research suggests that the IOP model can effectively reduce crisis events, treat symptoms, improve overall functioning, and reduce readmissions to inpatient hospitals [6,7]. The IOP model can be particularly beneficial for youth and young adults because it allows them to continue to attend school or work, maintain developmentally important social relationships, and avoid out-of-home placement, an experience that can exacerbate unipolar depression regardless of placement type (acute or residential care) [8].\nAlthough the IOP model can be an effective alternative to inpatient care for youth, place-based IOP locations are still limited to clients who live close enough to travel to the clinical setting several days per week. This can be particularly problematic for adolescents who depend on adults to drive them or provide the resources to take public transportation (bus or train fare) to the IOP location, assuming that public\ntransportation is available. Furthermore, even shorter\u00a0distances coupled with the expected frequency of attendance, can become burdensome on parents or caregivers and have negative impacts on the ability of parents to work and care for other children. Thus, adherence to IOP may be compromised.\nSuch geographic limitations restrict both the availability of services to youth living far from treatment settings as well as the degree to which treatment can be targeted to particular developmental and clinical needs, given that treatment groups by necessity reflect the conditions of the majority of the population in the particular geographic location. For example, a place-based IOP may not have enough similarly presenting clients to create a treatment group specifically for younger adolescents seeking treatment for eating disorders who identify as nongender conforming if most of the clients in that geographic area are older adolescents seeking treatment for anxiety who identify as cisgender.\nRemote IOP Remote IOPs are intensive outpatient programs that conduct 100% of their services over Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA)\u2013compliant video software, with patients and families typically attending sessions from home or school. Similar to place-based IOPs, clients attend 3-4 hours of treatment per day, 3-5 days per week. The primary benefit of remote IOP is the removal of geographic barriers inherent to place-based programs, which increases access to care for adolescents and young adults as well as allowing for the provision of more appropriate treatments specific to individual client needs. Because remote IOP can draw clients from an unlimited distance, it affords the opportunity to provide developmentally targeted treatment for youth at various points on the adolescent or young adult spectrum and specialized treatment for those whose demographic or clinical characteristics are unique. Due to its remote modality, populating a treatment group to the ideal therapeutic size is not dependent on the number of clients at the same stage of development with similar diagnoses, symptoms, and identities living in the same geographic area.\nPrevious research suggests that remote and internet-based interventions are effective in treating a variety of clinical diagnoses, with effect sizes equivalent to those reported for place-based or traditional face-to-face therapy [9]. More specifically, a systematic review of eTherapy concluded that web-based modalities are effective in treating depression in children and adolescents [10]."

Clients are referred to CH primarily through direct relationships with other providers (eg, hospitals, care networks, and physicians). Clients also contact the company directly following web-based searches for intensive care.\nThe primary diagnoses served by the program include anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder, with secondary diagnoses that include severe emotional disturbance, substance use disorders, and eating disorders. The program specializes in complex cases, including youth with severe trauma, neglect, juvenile justice, or foster care experience; gender and sexual minoritized youth; youth who reside in rural or native communities; and youth who have had multiple admissions to inpatient or hospital settings in the previous year.\nA biopsychosocial assessment is completed for each client at intake after which they are placed in treatment tracks that include groups and therapeutic approaches identified as best practices for their developmental stage and specific diagnostic, identity, and behavioral health needs. Developmentally determined groups include those targeted to youth in early adolescence, middle adolescence, late adolescence, young adulthood, and emerging adulthood. Identity focused tracks and groups include those targeted to youth from minoritized gender and sexual orientation populations. Treatment modalities include variations of cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior\ntherapy, and trauma-focused treatment. Client enrollment is ongoing and new clients may be placed into newly developed or already established groups. Additionally, because adjustments are made throughout the treatment process, clients may begin in one track but be reassigned to new groups based on their response to treatment.\nGroup therapies are provided in the following three 50-minute blocks, 3 days per week: evidence-based skill building interventions (ie, dialectical behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy), general therapeutic processing, and experiential therapy (ie, art, music, and journaling). Individual and family therapy groups are also offered each week with masters-level, licensed clinicians. Parents and others involved in the client\u2019s care are provided psychoeducation and\u00a0mutual aid\u00a0groups that deliver support and guidance in such topics as mindful communication and sibling support. Parents and caregivers are also provided weekly \u201cIOP Roadmap(s),\u201d which impart information on the skills their children are learning with tips on how to support the practice of those skills at home."

The cutoff at 18 hours was informed by research on neurological indicators of brain changes in response to cognitive and behavioral therapies [11-14]. Licensed clinicians make a diagnosis of MDD in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fifth edition criteria based on patient responses during the semistructured intake session and throughout the course of treatment.\nCases in which the client did not meet this minimum standard of engagement were not included. Clients who did not complete treatment (discharged due to lack of engagement or insurance denial, transfer to lower or higher level of care, left against clinical advice, etc) but were deemed as having passed the engagement criteria (at least 18 hours of IOP sessions) were included despite discharge status. Cases in which clients were absent from group for extended lengths of time (ie, 2-4 weeks), regardless of the reason (vacation, admission to higher level of care, disengaged, etc) were also included as long as they either met the minimum level of engagement prior to departure or, upon their return to treatment, attained a level of engagement that passed engagement criteria.\nA majority of the clients included in the analysis lived in Washington State (n=303), Texas (n=163), Arizona (n=106), Montana (n=88), California (n=58), Idaho (n=55), and Pennsylvania (n=45).

These 2 metrics, difference scores and clinical thresholds, are considered indices of clinically meaningful change as defined and studied by Wolpert et al [20].\nChanges in depression scores between intake and discharge were analyzed employing a repeated-measures t test. Changes in symptom severity were used to identify whether clients crossed the clinical threshold associated with MDD symptoms [19,21,22]. The threshold was identified as a reduction from moderate, moderately severe, or severe symptom categories at intake to no or mild symptom categories at discharge [21].

Age was collapsed into the following 3 groups that reflected different neurological and physiological stages of development: early adolescence (ages 11-14 years), associated with the onset of puberty [25]; middle adolescence (ages 15-18 years), associated with peak neurotransmitter activity in the limbic system [24]; and late adolescence or early adulthood (ages 19-25 years), associated with increased myelination in the self-regulatory areas of the prefrontal cortex [23,24].

This is important given that marginalized populations, including those who do not identify in the gender binary and those who select as members of LGBTQ+ communities, are at higher risk of mental health disorders due to experiences of marginalization [27,28] and encounter even greater barriers to appropriate mental health services than nonmarginalized groups [28-30]. Subgroup analysis also provides support for the use of the remote intensive outpatient program model with the range of developmentally unique groups commonly characterized under the umbrella term \u201cadolescents and young adults\u201d or \u201cyouth.\u201d Analyses found treatment effects to be equivalent across age groups ranging from early adolescence (11-13 years of age) to young adulthood (19-25 years of age).\nThe equivalent treatment effects determined across subgroups are likely the result of both program factors that are common across all clients as well as those that address the unique needs of individuals. All clients experience the same treatment platform (remote) and model (intensive outpatient program) that increase their access to intensive services while lowering burdens associated with travel time and cost. At the same time, individual treatment plans are specific to the developmental, psychological, and psychosocial needs of each client, meaning that each client gets to experience treatment groups designed to address their unique intersection of needs related to diagnoses, symptoms, developmental period (age), and identity (gender and sexual orientation)."

            "heading": "History Effects",
            "text": "One threat to the validity of findings is history or exposure to factors outside of the IOP treatment process that could have reduced depression between intake and discharge [31]. These external events or experiences are only considered threats when all clients are exposed to them and, for the purposes of this analysis, are those that reduce depression. One common history effect for which there is evidence of an impact on depression and to which all clients would be exposed is related to seasonal variation, for instance weather differences or differences in longer versus shorter periods of daylight [32,33]. Because client treatment episodes were dispersed across 4 seasons, we were\nable to compare average reductions in scores by season. While findings indicated a significant difference between spring and summer in the average change in depression, further analysis suggested that a single summer month (August 2021) may have been the primary driver of the difference. Given that the average change in depression for clients who started in August 2021 occurred in a single summer month across 2 summers, the difference may be better explained by selection bias than by seasonal effects. Additionally, history effects are of concern when they mimic treatment effects, which is not the case here as whatever led to the difference in scores in August 2021 led to a smaller average change in depression rather than an increase as we would expect with history effects that mimic treatment effects. As such, it does not appear that seasonal effects explain the significant decrease in depression between intake and discharge."

            "text": "In a clinical setting, spontaneous remission is the tendency for symptoms, regardless of severity, to improve over time independent of treatment [34]. Although only a small subgroup of clients (n=129) had follow-up scores with which to compare changes during treatment to those after treatment, results indicated that the significant reduction between intake and discharge plateaued after discharge, remaining stable between discharge and 3-month follow-up. Scores did not continue to decrease, nor did they increase. It is therefore plausible that spontaneous remission was not solely responsible for the reductions in depression during the treatment period, that the leveling off of reductions between discharge and 3-month follow-up was more a factor of the end of active treatment engagement. This explanation is particularly likely given that the timing between intake and discharge varied across clients, suggesting that, if spontaneous remission was exclusively responsible for improvements in depression, remission would also have had to occur on the same varied timeline."

            "text": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, telemental health care treatment options have become far more acceptable and viable. Although they do not alleviate all disparities, there are certain disparities that they can reduce. The remote platform decreases younger clients\u2019 dependency on others, such as parents for transport or the availability of public transportation for their attendance.\nProviding treatment remotely in the manner described here may have also attracted and helped engage LGBTQ+ youth. Previous research has found that LGBTQ+ youth are more likely than heterosexual cisgender youth to participate in web-based treatment [35] and often use web-based LGBTQ+ communities to explore their identities and connect with other LGBTQ+ people [36]. The comfort with web-based platforms and a treatment approach that enabled LGBTQ+ youth to connect with similarly identifying peers across the country in a way that is not always feasible in a given geographic location may help to explain the high rates of LGBTQ+ clients in the program.\nSuch services may also be easier to establish parent involvement due to decreased time commitment required without the travel to a physical location. Additionally, such involvement and the\nJMIR Form Res 2023 | vol. 7 | e44756 | p. 8https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e44756 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nability to pull from a wide geographical range makes it feasible for programs to hold targeted parent groups, such as the LGBTQ+ parent group offered by this program. These factors may have contributed to the effectiveness of this service for LGBTQ+ youth.\nThis treatment modality can also serve a wide range of ages without necessity for establishing separate facilities or specialized units for youth and young adults that require drawing on a broad geographical area. Consequently, it is far more feasible to develop groups remotely with youth who have similar developmental and demographic needs, as again these unique groups are not constrained by geographical location which by its very nature may not have the needed diversity. Given the comfort and technical savvy common in youth and young adults, this treatment modality has the potential to not only be a comfortable treatment alternative but one that is more attractive because it is tech-heavy."

            "heading": "Strengths and Limitations",
            "text": "A primary strength of this analysis is the use of outcomes data collected as part of program administration by program staff, which increases the likelihood that findings reflect the actual remote IOP process uninfluenced by the presence of research staff and additional resources frequently infused into organizations during the research process. The presence of research staff during the investigation of controlled interventions has implications for fidelity and the ability of an intervention to continue to engender the same treatment effects once organizations are left to implement interventions on their own [37]. The use of program outcome data as was done here, however, removes issues related to changes in intervention delivery at termination of the research process and the possible issues of fidelity that accompany them, and increases the likelihood that similar treatment effects will continue post evaluation given that the same treatment processes and providers are ongoing.\nThe gold standard in mental health treatment is personalized treatment to address each client\u2019s unique intersection of mental health and developmental and psychosocial needs. This makes good mental health treatment inherently heterogeneous. The value that QI analysis brings to the field is the degree to which outcomes reflect what is happening in a real-world\u00a0treatment setting. QI cannot have the precision of a randomized controlled trial as delivered by a research team, because it is based on clinical and administrative data, but it nonetheless extends the knowledge base.\nAnother strength of this analysis is the use of 2 metrics to assess clinically meaningful change [20]. One of the challenges of clinical research is the identification of metrics that assess changes that are not just meaningful in research and hypothesis testing but are also important to clients\u2019 experiences in their day-to-day lives [38]. Both metrics were based on the PHQ-A, which assesses changes in self-concept and emotions, which are more conceptual, as well as changes in behavior and\nexperiences that connect more directly to daily functioning, such as sleeping, eating, the ability to concentrate, and having interest or taking pleasure in doing things, all of which are directly consequential to day-to-day living. It could also be argued that such changes are subjectively important and valued by the client, an essential goal in clinical research that can be lost when measures are only of theoretical constructs.\nA primary limitation of this study is the lack of a comparison group with which to compare those in treatment to assure that changes over time were not due to factors other than or outside of the treatment experience. To account for this limitation, the following 2 threats to validity of the findings were explored in analyses: history effects and spontaneous remission."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "These analyses help to fill the gap in the literature regarding the use of remote mental health services (telehealth) to treat adolescents and young adults with more complex mental health needs by providing evidence for the ability of remote IOP to reduce depression in high acuity youth without hospitalization and with treatment effects that remained stable for up to 3 months post discharge. The metrics used to assess treatment effects reflect both changes in clinical diagnoses as well as changes in real-world symptoms, including changes in sleeping and eating patterns, the ability to concentrate, and having interest or taking pleasure in everyday activities, all of which have direct implications for the physical and mental well-being of clients in everyday life.\nThis study also provides evidence for the ability of remote intensive outpatient program to effectively treat those youth who identify as members of marginalized gender and sexual orientation populations. The opportunity to work outside of the limitations of place and local demographics allows clinicians to create specialized treatment groups sensitive to identity-specific needs and, given the disproportionately high percentage of clients who identified as a member of an LGBTQ+ community, may provide a safer space to self-disclose than those based in local facilities. The remote intensive outpatient program model as delivered here could move the field forward in providing more opportunities and safer spaces for youth from LGBTQ+ communities to receive identity-sensitive treatment and in doing so address the disparities that lead to the poorer outcomes and greater treatment barriers experienced by LGBTQ+ youth compared to their cisgender, heterosexual peers.\nFinally, providing evidence for the effectiveness of remote IOP engenders support for another level within the spectrum of care that allows patients whose needs go beyond that which can be addressed in regular outpatient settings to receive treatment in their homes rather than inpatient treatment settings or hospitalization. This in turn enables youth to receive a higher level of intensive treatment without removing them from their everyday supports and the healthy, normative activities that are developmentally essential during adolescence and young adulthood."
