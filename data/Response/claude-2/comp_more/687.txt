 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore different neural network architectures for relating individual annotator perspectives, such as graph neural networks or transformer models. The paper focused on recommender-style architectures, but other architectures may capture inter-annotator relationships even better.

2. Apply the annotator modeling framework to other subjective NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, etc. The paper showed promise for argument quality assessment, but the ideas could generalize to other tasks with inherent subjectivity.

3. Investigate semi-supervised or weakly supervised methods to reduce the annotation effort required. The paper relied on datasets with annotations from multiple individuals per example, which is costly. Methods that can learn from less dense annotation could help scale up.

4. Develop more advanced evaluation metrics and frameworks for models that predict annotator-specific labels, rather than just using macro/micro averages. New evaluation approaches could better capture model capabilities in representing subjective perspectives.

5. Explore how to build user-adaptive systems that can interactively update and integrate annotator-specific model predictions based on user feedback. Moving beyond fixed predictions to dynamically aggregating subjective perspectives based on user validation is an interesting direction.
