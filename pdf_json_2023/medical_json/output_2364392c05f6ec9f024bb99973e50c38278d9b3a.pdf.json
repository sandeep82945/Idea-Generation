    "abstractText": "Integrating renewable hydrogen production via electrolysis with wastewater treatment is an opportunity to manage environmental resources more sustainably while providing a pathway to producing sustainable hydrogen at industrial scale. The synergies of integrating oxygen production from water electrolysis and oxygen use in wastewater treatment benefit both hydrogen production and wastewater industries. However, the understanding of the most suitable integrated process configuration and scale of renewable equipment is not known. A novel energy shifting process is proposed here using compressed and stored oxygen produced by water electrolysis and used in the activated sludge process, replacing traditional aeration in the wastewater treatment plant and eliminating the high energy consuming blowers supplying air to submerged fine bubble diffusers. In the proposed energy shifting process, excess oxygen produced by water electrolysis at times of peak renewable electricity production is stored and used for wastewater treatment at times of peak oxygen demand. Wastewater treatment data from the activated sludge process was used to calculate oxygen demand in one-hour intervals over a 24-hour period, and the system response of the integrated plant was simulated at hourly intervals and equipment size determined according to an optimisation algorithm that balances oxygen and electricity supply and demand over a 24-hour period. Sensitivity analysis of operational parameters is assessed and the case for replacing traditional WWTP aeration with newer technologies is quantified using a high efficiency oxygen transfer system such as a Speece cone as an example that is shown to be a prerequisite for the feasibility of the process. The results produced by this study provide valuable information to the hydrogen and wastewater industries on how an integrated plant could be configured. Besides the environmental advantages of sustainably produced hydrogen, using oxygen as a biochemical energy storage medium in this configuration means WWTP powered from renewable electricity becomes more viable reducing the industries reliance on fossil fuels.",

The synergies of integrating oxygen production from water electrolysis and oxygen use in wastewater treatment benefit both hydrogen production and wastewater industries. However, the understanding of the most suitable integrated process configuration and scale of renewable equipment is not known. A novel energy shifting process is proposed here using compressed and stored oxygen produced by water electrolysis and used in the activated sludge process, replacing traditional aeration in the wastewater treatment plant and eliminating the high energy consuming blowers supplying air to submerged fine bubble diffusers. In the proposed energy shifting process, excess oxygen produced by water electrolysis at times of peak renewable electricity production is stored and used for wastewater treatment at times of peak oxygen demand. Wastewater treatment data from the activated sludge process was used to calculate oxygen demand in one-hour intervals over a 24-hour period, and the system response of the integrated plant was simulated at hourly intervals and equipment size determined according to an optimisation algorithm that balances oxygen and electricity supply and demand over a 24-hour period. Sensitivity analysis of operational parameters is assessed and the case for replacing traditional WWTP aeration with newer technologies is quantified using a high efficiency oxygen transfer system such as a Speece cone as an example that is shown to be a prerequisite for the feasibility of the process. The results produced by this study provide valuable information to the hydrogen and wastewater industries on how an integrated plant could be configured. Besides the environmental advantages of sustainably produced hydrogen, using oxygen as a biochemical energy storage medium in this configuration means WWTP powered from renewable electricity becomes more viable reducing the industries reliance on fossil fuels.\nKeywords/Subjects\nEnergy, Water, Sustainability, Renewables, Hydrogen, Wastewater, Oxygen\n2 Accepted 31 Dec 2022"

            "text": "This key contribution of this paper is the analysis of a novel energy shifting process in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using compressed oxygen that is produced from co-located and integrated electrolysers producing renewable hydrogen. The objective of the research is to identify the viability, benefits, and constraints of an integrated plant and provide new knowledge of the most suitable integrated process configuration and scale of renewable equipment, such as solar PV, electrolysers, and gas storage, that is presently not known. Water electrolysis is used to shift energy from periods of peak renewable electricity generation to periods of peak oxygen demand in the activated sludge process (ASP) of a WWTP. Effectively, this system is an energy storage mechanism, like a battery, which enables increased utilisation of renewable electricity. Analysis of compressed oxygen energy storage (COES) is important for the technoeconomic feasibility of future electrolyser integration with municipal WWTPs. Industry sector coupling of renewable hydrogen production and wastewater treatment can facilitate a large scale distributed renewable hydrogen production industry and decarbonising WWTPs to potentially operate from 100% renewable energy. This paper uses a case study of a municipal WWTP to analyse benefits of COES when electrolysers are integrated at the WWTP to produce renewable hydrogen as the primary value product and determines optimum size of renewable energy equipment (solar and electrolyser) based on measured hourly oxygen demand data from an operating wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) over 24 hours showing how renewable electricity supply to electrolysers for oxygen production is balanced with oxygen demand in the WWTP.\nRenewable hydrogen has been cited as the best opportunity for a zero emissions fuel (Saeedmanesh et al., 2018) but the growth of the industry to meet Net Zero Emission targets must concomitantly achieve United Nations Sustainability Development Goals to ensuring sustainable management of water. Municipal WWTPs are a viable source of sustainable water to rapidly grow the emerging renewable hydrogen industry in a distributed production approach across local government regions that overcomes environmental and social concerns with using potable water. Wastewater treatment is a major industry and municipal WWTPs are distributed in local communities and suitable to position distributed hydrogen production facilities to grow the industry, and is one example of an adaptive renewable energy plant (Boulaire et al., 2021). There are many municipal WWTPs where the distributed production of hydrogen can meet the growing local municipality demand with little energy loss thanks to reduced transport and possible storage requirements. In addition, excess renewable hydrogen can be transported to other municipalities and when aggregated to larger volumes can be distributed to other domestic regions or exported. The synergies create valuable\n3 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nopportunities in the integration of process streams and can lead to a lower cost of hydrogen and/or lower operating cost of WWTPs while conserving energy resources.\nWWTPs are energy intensive, with an electricity demand accounting for about 1% of total consumption for European countries (Longo et al., 2016) where, in most WWTPs, effluent water quality is improved at the expense of high energy input (Gu et al., 2017). The ASP is usually the largest energy consumer in WWTPs, using between 30% and 90% of the total energy consumed by the plant (Baquero-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2018; Drewnowski et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2017; Gurung et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2012; Mamais et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016). Municipal WWTPs typically utilise the ASP to reduce nutrients and organic carbon from influent wastewater (Emami et al., 2018), with energy efficiency varying substantially between WWTPs (Molinos-Senante et al., 2018) (de Haas et al., 2014). Thus, a focus on improving the energy use of the ASP in WWTPs can deliver significant environmental benefits.\nThere has been limited attention to load shifting in WWTP due to a lack of demand response modelling tools (Kirchem et al., 2020), however investigations have reported flexibility in power demand with commercial benefits arising from better utilisation of electricity pricing structures (Brok et al., 2020) and a modest reduction in installed capacity when considering a fully renewable electricity grid in Australia (Ali et al., 2020). Concepts of industry sector coupling for the production of hydrogen has received a great deal of attention (He et al., 2021) including sector coupling of wastewater treatment (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2020). However, there is a significant research gap due to a lack of understanding on the scale of equipment required for an integrated plant. This work seeks to address that research gap by simulating a renewable water electrolysis process integrated with a biological oxygen demand process that to date has not been reported.\nMunicipal wastewater treatment is a mature industry facing growing pressure over energy consumption. Adding water electrolysis to WWTPs in a coherent and integrated plant has operational benefits for existing WWTPs, including:\n(i) use of high purity oxygen (HPO) in aerobic and disinfection processes (ii) increased recycling and use of treated wastewater to produce renewable hydrogen (iii) use of electrolyser waste heat to increase overall efficiency of WWTP process having thermal\ndemand\n(iv) capacity to store energy on-site for later, or strategic use within the WWTP (v) expansion of renewable energy to power the WWTP for transitioning to a net zero emissions\noperation\n4 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\n(vi) financial benefits from production and sales of renewable hydrogen to local markets to enable\ndecarbonisation of hard-to-abate industries.\nRenewable hydrogen production is the primary value proposition from integrating electrolysers at WWTPs, creating opportunities for a WWTP to approach self-sufficiency in renewable energy generation and use, and to provide a potential revenue stream. HPO is co-produced in the electrolytic production of hydrogen but often discarded as a low value by-product. However, HPO can be effectively used in the wastewater treatment to offset other energy consumption. Large quantities of oxygen are used in wastewater treatment, predominantly in the activated sludge process (ASP) where the oxygen is derived from atmospheric air, and for some WWTPs, generating ozone for disinfection or oxidation.\nThere is a dearth of reports about pilot or full-scale water electrolysis integrated with WWTPs from\nwhich to assess feasibility and the merits of integration and use of HPO. One of the earliest reports is the \u201chydrogen-HPO project\u201d in Barth, Germany, in 2002 (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2020) where it was found that using HPO in the ASP avoided an upgrade of the WWTP (Jentsch & B\u00fcttner, 2019). The \u201cGreenlysis\u201d project (CETaqua, 2012; Marzo et al.) in Spain was summarised as being technically feasible, but not economically viable at the time (European Commission, 2012), probably due to its small scale. A pilot plant at Sonneberg-Heubisch WWTP in Germany operated in 2017 indicated a significant saving in HPO use but created unfavourable process conditions (B\u00fcttner et al., 2018). Economic assessments of integrating HPO produced by water electrolysis and wastewater treatment can also arrive at different conclusions. For example, the study carried out by Patterson et al. (2017) found the economic benefit to be insignificant but Lardon et al. (2018) reported an increase of 18% in the overall profitability of a power to gas plant. A high-level analysis (Swisher et al., 2019) of wastewater for supplying a renewable hydrogen industry in Australia suggested using HPO for wastewater treatment and a subsequent report (Freund et al., 2020) identified the potential to reduce energy consumption and delay infrastructure investment, but used an HPO economic value many times greater than the value assumed in other publications (Hassan et al., 2019). The above reports support a recent review of several examples of the use of HPO in aeration that concluded results across different reports were contradictory of its benefits (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2020).\nInsights from evaluation of literature highlight a significant knowledge gap on the benefits of integrating sustainable hydrogen production with wastewater treatment, and the understanding of the most suitable process configuration and scale of renewable equipment. Models of renewable hydrogen plants are available and models for WWTPs are available however this work presents the first time that these processes have been modelled as an integrated process. In particular,\n5 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\ncompressing and storing oxygen to shift the energy profile for an integrated plant is a novel configuration and analysed for the first time in this work using the hourly process data of a wastewater treatment plant. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the benefits of COES that stores HPO from water electrolysis for use in the ASP of WWTPs at a later time when oxygen demand is high. This investigation considers COES produced by solar-powered water electrolysis where the HPO is used for ASP of a full scale municipal WWTP.\nThe hypothesis was that \u201cif sustainable hydrogen production and wastewater treatment are integrated as a cohesive process, then it is feasible to match the renewable energy supply to the diurnal oxygen demand\u201d. As such this study addresses the following research questions to support the hypothesis: (i) is the time period of oxygen demand in the ASP suitable for using COES at WWTPs? (ii) for a given WWTP size, what size renewable electricity generation, electrolyser, and HPO compression and storage would be required to provide benefit in using HPO in ASP and what factors impact that sizing? and (iii) will existing fine bubble diffuser systems in ASPs be suitable for using COES? These questions are addressed in the analysis of a case study WWTP with integrated renewable water electrolysis powered by a solar PV system, with results of the investigation presented in Sections 3.1 to 3.4. The implications of these results are discussed in Section 3.5."

Electricity from the main grid powers air blowers to provide air to fine bubble diffusers in the ASP.

COES decouples the time of high oxygen demand, that typically occurs at peak electricity price periods, from the time of peak renewable electricity production where electricity pricing may be lower.\nBased on a review of the literature where HPO by-product from electrolysis has been considered for the ASP (Campana et al., 2021), this work may be the first time that HPO from an integrated WWTP with water electrolysis has been analysed as a method to shift energy from time of supply to demand in the ASP. COES has parallels with well-known compressed-air energy storage (CAES) but with significant differences when it is applied to the new industry sector coupling of renewable hydrogen energy production via water electrolysis with wastewater treatment.\nCAES is a method that uses electricity when available to compress air using conventional compressors therefore storing energy. The stored energy is released by decompression and regenerating electricity during periods of high demand. A more direct application of CAES for a WWTP was reviewed by (Cottes et al., 2020) for storing compressed air for later use in the ASP.\nCOES, however, uses water electrolysis that produces HPO during periods of high electricity supply, at pressures from slightly over atmospheric pressure to about 20 bar in modern systems without use of mechanical compressors, that can be stored in pressure vessels. Further compression to high pressure cylinders is possible albeit with energy consumption that is only beneficial if storage infrastructure capital cost savings offsets the cost of additional electricity use. Liquefaction of HPO is a further possibility but not considered in this paper. The stored HPO can be used during periods of elevated wastewater inflow when there is high oxygen demand in the ASP that would normally be associated with peak electricity demand in conventional blowers. HPO storage can provision for longer durations in load shifting than intermittent aeration, avoiding process upsets and affecting wastewater treatment standards. Load shifting towards a typical renewable electricity generation pattern, such as that from solar PV, will facilitate increased utilisation and less curtailment of renewable electricity.\nThe unique opportunity for COES comes from the variable oxygen demand in WWTPs that follows the diurnal profile of the incoming wastewater flows as it varies significantly over each 24-hour period. This is further amplified by variations in influent pollutant levels as well as operating parameters responding to these fluctuations (Emami et al., 2018). With aeration as the major consumer of electricity for wastewater treatment, this variation in oxygen demand drives a similar\n7 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\npattern of electricity load in the WWTP where aeration equipment responds to the change in oxygen requirement."

            "text": "Numerous configuration options of integrated water electrolysis and wastewater treatment processes are possible. An example of a sustainable energy system is schematically shown in Figure 1 where a WWTP is powered from renewable energy, in this example from solar PV. Where available, connection to the electricity grid may be advantageous for backup power supply and for export of surplus electricity. With the electricity grid in most countries having an increasingly higher portion of electricity generated from renewable sources (IRENA, 2020), exporting electricity at certain times may be a lucrative proposition. The integrated plant is supplied electricity (Stream 1) for both water electrolysis and all internal power consumption of WWTP processes. A battery system provides rapid response to the short-term fluctuation in solar PV output. Figure 1 shows one example configuration of using HPO, produced by the electrolyser, in the ASP that treats incoming wastewater (Stream 2). The major role of the electrolyser is to produce hydrogen which may be stored under pressure or liquefied. Hydrogen can be consumed in a fuel cell to provide backup renewable electricity for the WWTP when required and/or exported to a third party for commercial benefits (Stream 3). HPO produced by water electrolysis (Stream 4) can be stored under pressure and delivered to the ASP according to its temporal requirements. Continuous supply of HPO to the ASP is critical and the example schematic includes a backup HPO generation system, such as an air separation unit, that can provide HPO at times when there are insufficient quantities produced by electrolysis and when the HPO pressure in the storage vessel is too low to maintain supply. Treated wastewater effluent (Stream 5) supplies high-quality demineralised water required for hydrogen production from water electrolysis, eliminating the need to use drinking water. Figure 1 shows an example of using the waste heat from electrolysis (Stream 6) in a thermal water purification process to produce the highquality water needed in electrolysis from treated wastewater effluent.\n8 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nThis work analyses the HPO produced from the electrolyser for use in the activated sludge process (ASP) (process stream 4). The full process integration complexity is beyond the scope of this work and considered for follow on research."

It is conventionally supplied by aeration systems using submerged or partially submerged impellers that dissolve surface air and/or by air blowers connected to submerged fine bubble diffusers. This case study considers submerged fine bubble diffusers. Dissolved oxygen level in the ASP is typically maintained at 1 to 3 mg/L, with the microorganisms using the oxygen as rapidly as it is supplied (Tchobanoglous, 2014).\nIn calculating the quantity of oxygen that must be provided to the aeration system of the WWTP, the oxygen transfer rate (OTR, kgO2/hr) required by the microorganisms was first determined. The oxygen transfer rate at standard conditions (SOTR, kgO2/hr) (20oC, 1 atm with zero dissolved oxygen) concentration was then calculated, accounting for the resistance of dissolving oxygen in the wastewater, and finally the amount of oxygen required was determined using the standard oxygen transfer efficiency (SOTE, %) for subsurface aeration.\nOTR of the ASP was calculated using hourly sample results of influent flow rate, and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) concentration of wastewater entering the WWTP. It was assumed that 1 kg of HPO removed 1 kg of BOD and the oxygen required for the complete oxidation of ammonia was 4.57 kg O2 /kg NH4 -N oxidized and 2.86 kg of oxygen was released in converting NOx to N2 gas during denitrification (Tchobanoglous, 2014).

The case study uses \u03b1SOTE values ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 reflecting conventional and advanced aeration technology respectively for the following reasons.\nThe alpha factor is dependent on bubble size that is influenced by the aerator type and configuration, as well as on ASP conditions. Mixed liquor concentration and sludge retention time (SRT) of the ASP play an important role (Baquero-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2018) with the alpha factor for traditional aeration systems typically in the range 0.3 to 0.85 (Drewnowski et al., 2019). Mueller et al. (2002) reported a range of 0.4 to 0.76 for perforated membrane discs installed in a grid pattern in a municipal wastewater bioreactor, but an even greater range for other designs of submerged aeration systems. Rosso et al. (2008) derived a mean alpha factor of 0.37 for conventional ASP without nitrogen removal and 0.59 for a nitrification-denitrification ASP.\nFor fine bubble diffusers, SOTE is strongly dependent on diffuser depth but is also influenced by bubble size, air flow rate, and diffuser spacing in the tank. A wide range of SOTE values can be found in the literature, but is typically reported around 5% per metre of water depth (Stamatelatou & Tsagarakis, 2015). Although fine bubble diffusers are a popular choice for traditional ASP aeration systems, these levels of efficiency are low, even at a submergence depth of 4 to 5 metres in the ASP\n12 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\ntank. Fine bubble diffusers are also more susceptible to fouling where OTR is further de-rated by a fouling factor dependent on the duration of the diffusers in service. Smaller bubbles have a higher SOTE than coarse bubbles, however the overall performance benefits are not obvious because the reverse holds for the alpha factor.\nThe alpha factor and SOTE for traditional aeration systems spans a significant range, but there is less information available when considering HPO. Integrating electrolysers with the ASP enables potential benefits from increasing the oxygen partial pressure from 21% in air to around 100% in HPO that is provided by the electrolyser. In clean water using ceramic diffusers at a depth of 5.6m, (Barber et al., 2015) reported SOTE of HPO between 36% and 42%, or 6.4% to 7.5% per metre of submergence, compared to using air with an SOTE range of 4.5% to 6.25% per metre of submergence. Similarly for SOTE, information is limited for alpha factors using HPO. Tzeng et al. (2003) used an alpha factor of 0.4 for fine bubble diffusers at oxygen gas purity of 65% although details were not provided on wastewater mixed liquor characteristics. Kim et al. (2019) reported alpha factor around 0.9 for fine bubble diffusers at HPO gas purity operating in mixed liquor concentrations of 4000 mg/L and at a relatively short SRT of 5 days. Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2011) reported alpha factor of 0.46 at a mixed liquor concentration of 3420 mg/L and SRT of around 40 days in a membrane bioreactor.\nThere has been significant effort invested in using HPO instead of air in WWTPs but there is still limited information available to suggest the most suitable devices in the ASP for use with HPO (Drewnowski et al., 2019). Some commercial systems have refined the concept in surface aeration with covers over the surface aerators, but there is still further opportunity to increase SOTE, meaning less undissolved oxygen is wasted. Alternate aeration technologies focussing on higher SOTE has received more recent attention (Table 1). With SOTE values much higher than conventional aeration systems, combining these technologies with HPO produced by an electrolyser provides a new context to consider the value of integrating hydrogen production with wastewater treatment.\nOf these newer aeration technologies, the Speece cone has found application across various water sectors, but several investigations have been carried out dissolving oxygen in clean water and wastewater and determining the alpha factor. Ochoa (2017) reported the results for testing a Speece cone dissolving HPO in wastewater activated sludge at a depth of 1 metre and a mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration around 5000 mg/L where the maximum alpha factor of 0.96 coincided with an SOTE around 60%. Using similar apparatus, Kolekar (2019) reported a maximum alpha factor of 0.95 but at SOTE of 91%. Barreto et al. (2018) noted that higher values of SOTE and alpha factor could be achieved by reducing the HPO flowrate, but at the expense of SOTR. Other\n13 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\ntechnologies, such as HPO nanobubbles, have reported field oxygen transfer efficiencies eight times higher than fine bubble diffusers (White et al., 2019).\nGiven the interaction of the alpha factor and SOTE, it is useful to consider the standardised oxygen transfer efficiency at field conditions (Jiang et al., 2017), or \u03b1SOTE in equation (3). The analysis in this case study considers the combined \u03b1SOTE as one of the key input variables for evaluating the system response, with \u03b1SOTE considered between 0.2 and 0.8. The lower value is aligned with traditional aeration having good performance (e.g. \u03b1 = 0.7, SOTE = 6.2%/m, submergence depth = 4.6m), and the higher value using an enhanced technology such as a Speece cone (e.g. \u03b1 = 0.9, SOTE = 89%). This investigation considers dissolved oxygen content of the ASP, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3fin equation (2), of 2 mg/L but also assesses the performance at 3 mg/L, being a typical range for an ASP treating municipal wastewater. Maintaining a dissolved oxygen content of 2 mg/L is generally sufficient in practice to ensure oxygen is adequately transferred to the microorganisms used for pollutant removal including nitrogen removal, although higher values of \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f may be observed in wastewater treatment processes with a shorter sludge age.\n14 Accepted 31 Dec 2022"

            "text": "For the case study WWTP the total electricity consumption of 81 kWh/EP/year was calculated based on the electricity usage data for that plant for one month. This electricity usage is at the high end of published WWTP energy benchmarking surveys (Cardoso et al., 2021; Clos et al., 2020; de Haas et al., 2018), where a typical WWTP similar to the example might be expected to use around half this amount. Treated wastewater effluent monthly results shows the case study WWTP was producing high quality effluent, with total nitrogen content of 1.7 mg/L and total suspended solids of 3.4 mg/L for 2016, which may explain the high-power consumption. The annual electricity usage of 81 kWh/EP/year means that, on average, this 26,000EP WWTP could be expected to use approximately 5.8 MWh/day of electricity across all its operations. This daily electricity consumption is assumed to be used in the following portions: 50% for aeration of the ASP, 30% directly proportional to the flow of wastewater through the WWTP, and the remaining 20% as a fixed component. In this analysis, it is assumed that the portion of energy used in aeration is solely to provide the necessary oxygen for the ASP whereas, in practice, the aerating action also mixes the contents of the aerated tanks to improve the biochemical reaction rates. A more detailed assessment would separate the energy requirements of these two mechanisms and account for any deficiencies in mixing energy from using HPO instead of air.

The relationship between electrolyser specific power consumption (kWh/kg\u00b7H2) and power load is an important consideration in modelling a system, but there is limited published information available from commercial suppliers. The data from Mohammadshahi et al. (2022) for a 40 kW electrolyser was used for the case study with a fourth order polynomial trendline fitted to the data (Supplementary Figure 2).\nAlthough the average specific power consumption for this electrolyser is higher than that described in other literature (Buttler & Spliethoff, 2018), a sensitivity analysis was carried out by reducing the constant of the fitted polynomial trendline such that the minimum power consumption varied between 48.75 and 68.75 kWh/kg H2 (i.e. a maximum reduction of 20 kWh/kg H2 from the data shown in Supplementary Figure 2). The % load on the electrolyser was calculated using the hourly electricity available from solar PV and the relationship defined from Supplementary Figure 2 used to calculate the mass of hydrogen produced for that hour, after deducting electricity use by the WWTP. Available electricity supply from solar PV exceeding 100% electrolyser capacity was available for export. The minimum turndown ratio of the electrolyser was taken as 20% Supplementary Figure 2), such that electrolysis operation was stopped when the solar PV output was less than this threshold after deducting WWTP electricity requirements, thus being available for export. HPO production for each hour was calculated from the mass of hydrogen produced multiplied by the oxygen to hydrogen mass ratio (8) for the water electrolysis stoichiometric reaction."

            "text": "As described in Section 2.3, this analysis calculates the size of process equipment with the objective of supplying all HPO from the electrolyser and HPO storage vessel. However, in an integrated hydrogen production and wastewater treatment plant, where HPO is provided by electrolysis powered only by solar PV, consideration must be given to meeting the ASP oxygen demand during periods of low solar PV production, such as cloudy days where there may be insufficient HPO for the ASP. A complete assessment of the optimum configuration would consider the design and operating objectives of the system and is beyond the scope of this investigation. Oversizing equipment such as solar PV, electrolyser, and HPO storage pressure vessel is an option but likely to result in high capital expenditure. Other options include grid-supplied electricity to supplement solar PV for electrolysis or reverting to traditional wastewater aeration systems such as submerged air diffusers provided by blowers. An on-demand backup HPO supply is an alternative, and several equipment and configuration options exist for separating HPO from atmospheric air. While Figure 1 shows the inclusion of a backup HPO supply, the results of this study show that it is not required for the 24- hour assessment period because the optimisation process described in Section 2.3 ensures the HPO storage vessel can supply enough HPO for the full 24-hour period. Incorporation of a backup HPO supply system is a consideration for further research where such a system may consume around 0.5 kWh per kg of HPO, accounting for inefficiencies of smaller unit processes when compared to larger processing facilities and benchmark data (Alsultannty & Al-Shammari, 2014; Banaszkiewicz et al.; Thomas et al., 2003)."

To achieve the environmental licence conditions for effluent described in Section 2, these targets based on the average daily COD and TKN concentrations in the incoming wastewater, wastewater treatment efficiency coefficients in equation (1) were determined as: \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35= 96.7%, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 = 93.8%, and \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 = 85%.

While the oxygen demand profile follows the inflow in Figure 3, the variation in COD and TKN concentration amplifies the peaks in oxygen demand in accordance with equation (1). These characteristics are typical of municipal WWTPs that are governed by human activity.

            "text": "With the aeration system of a conventional ASP being the largest energy consumer of the WWTP, the electricity use profile will follow the oxygen demand shown in Figure 3. This case study has assumed that using conventional aeration, the WWTP consumes 50% of the total 81 kWh/EP/year for aeration, as described in Section 2.6. As a validation of this 50%, if the specific aeration energy consumption is taken as 1.38 kWh/kg O2 transferred (Rosso et al., 2008), the 2146 kg/day of oxygen demand would use around 2961 kWh/day or 51% of the total electricity consumption, thus closely aligning with the value used in this analysis. This percentage of electricity used for conventional aeration aligns with published benchmark data (Drewnowski et al., 2019). Equation (4) illustrates the relationship between power consumption and oxygen requirement, which is dependent on wastewater pollutant concentrations \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 in equation (1). Hence, wastewater having higher pollutant concentrations, such as that including discharge from industry, would use a higher proportion of its electricity in the ASP.\nFigure 4 provides an overview of the electricity flows of the integrated plant with \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38 = 0.8, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f = 2 mg/L, and maximum HPO storage pressure of 200 bar. The WWTP electricity use excludes aeration, comprising only the fixed and flow dependent components of equation (4). The solar PV output peak does not coincide with the periods where electricity demand of the WWTP is highest, thus identifying the load shifting requirement. During periods of insufficient solar PV output to meet the power requirements of the WWTP, electricity is imported from the grid, totalling 1226 kWh over the 24-hour period. Surplus electricity is exported to the grid when solar PV output exceeds requirements of the WWTP and the electrolyser. The morning peak of 412 kWh exported electricity (solar PV output of 519 kWh less 107 kWh WWTP power requirement) occurs because this is below the 20% minimum turn down ratio of the electrolyser (20% of 3869 kW). These circumstances are repeated to a lesser extent from 5pm to 6pm, resulting in electricity available for export to the grid. During peak solar PV output around midday, there is surplus electricity after allowing for WWTP power usage and operating the electrolyser at 100%, hence electricity is available for export during this period. Peak electricity use for the HPO compressor is dependent on nett HPO mass flowrate to storage as well as HPO storage vessel pressure (equation (5)) and therefore does not necessarily coincide with peak oxygen production. The solar PV system and electrolyser sizes were selected using the optimisation algorithm described in Section 2.3. The amount and timing of imported and exported electricity is strongly dependent on the relationship between these units and the WWTP power requirements each hour, thus equipment sizing plays a key role in the electricity flows.\n21 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nFigure 5 presents the electrolyser power consumption and electrolysis specific power consumption, identifying electrolysis efficiency, over the 24-hour period, and includes the solar PV output and WWTP power requirements from Figure 4. The majority of solar PV output is used for electrolysis, with the system giving priority to electricity requirements of the WWTP. As described earlier, there is insufficient solar PV to exceed the 20% threshold of the electrolyser before 7am and after 5pm. The specific power consumption of the electrolyser follows the profile defined in Supplementary Figure 2, with lowest specific power consumption (higher electrolysis efficiency) during the morning and afternoon periods when electrolyser load is closer to the minimum specific power consumption in Supplementary Figure 2, although this spikes from 4pm to 5pm because the electrolyser load drops to 23% being less than the point of minimum specific power consumption. During peak solar PV output around midday, the electrolyser operates at 100% load.\n22 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nFrom an electricity use perspective, the HPO compressor in the integrated plant may be considered a substitute for the air blowers of the conventional WWTP. The daily WWTP electricity use for the integrated plant, inclusive of HPO compressor, was compared to that for the WWTP using air blowers but assuming a high efficiency oxygen utilisation system with \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38 = 0.8 could be achieved, and using the same values for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53 and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53 described in Section 2.6. This provides a consistent basis for comparing plant configurations using the same technology outcomes. Figure 6 highlights how the integrated plant using HPO would use more electricity than the WWTP with air blowers when the total electricity usage less than about 70 kWh/EP/year. The case study WWTP used 81 kWh/EP/year, yielding a nett reduction in electricity use. Although 81 kWh/EP/year is comparatively high for electricity use in a WWTP, energy efficiency can vary by a factor of more than eight between plants (Molinos-Senante et al., 2018). This means there is likely to be a significant group of WWTPs using more than 70 kWh/EP/year, particularly for advanced treatment that can use 35% additional electricity (B\u00fcttner et al., 2018). The analysis in Figure 6 shows that a more electricity efficient WWTP with conventional air blowers would use less overall electricity. While this may be a benefit when exporting surplus electricity is lucrative, energy shifting that increases the utilisation of electricity generated by solar PV would not be realised.\n23 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nThe electricity flows are highly dependent on equipment size and their interaction in the integrated plant. In this analysis, the sizes of the solar PV system and electrolyser equipment sizes were selected according to an optimisation algorithm described in Section 2.3 based on minimising specific objectives. The next section describes the results of other process equipment required for the integrated plant and the sensitivity to changes in design and operating parameters."

            "text": "The minimum size for the HPO storage pressure vessel and HPO compressor size were calculated at varying maximum operating pressures and for different wastewater HPO characteristics. Figure 7 shows how the pressure of the HPO storage vessel varies over the 24-hour period, affected by the nett HPO inflow to the storage vessel or outflow from the vessel, where HPO flowing into the storage vessel is taken as positive. Figure 7, the HPO storage vessel pressure varies from the minimum required to maintain HPO flow to the ASP but is limited by the maximum operating pressure of the vessel, in this case 200 bar. Section 2.3 provides details of the HPO storage vessel size calculation. For the scenario in Figure 7, the nett HPO produced is less than zero when there is no solar PV output to provide electricity for the electrolysis process. Hence, the HPO storage vessel pressure reduces while HPO is discharged from the storage vessel to the ASP, reaching a minimum just as HPO production from electrolysis commences at 8:00am. The nett HPO inflow to the storage vessel reaches a maximum at midday and declines as HPO generated by electrolysis decreases when solar PV falls away in the\n24 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nafternoon. The HPO storage vessel reaches its maximum pressure at 4:00pm and then quickly reduces as HPO is consumed from the HPO storage vessel. Thus, the HPO requirements of the ASP can essentially be provided by a solar PV system powering the electrolysis process producing hydrogen and HPO. Excess HPO is stored in the pressure vessel during times of peak solar irradiance and used when oxygen demand is higher and exceeds the production rate of electrolytic HPO production. The size of the HPO storage vessel is critical to balancing the HPO production and demand, but moreover the size of all unit processes in the integrated plant, including solar PV system, electrolyser, and HPO compressor, are all important to ensure specific objectives can be met.\nFigure 7, Table 2, Figure 8, and Figure 9 demonstrates the sensitivity and impact of varying maximum HPO storage vessel operating pressure, and for different wastewater oxygen characteristics (\u03b1SOTE and DO) using the analysis method described in Section 2.3. There is substantial difference in storage vessel and compressor size requirements between 10 bar and 200 bar, as noted from the log-log graphs of Figure 8, but \u03b1SOTE also has a large impact (Figure 9). Traditional submerged aeration such as fine bubble diffusers with \u03b1SOTE = 0.2 requires substantially larger HPO storage and compressor than when using advanced HPO technologies such as a Speece Cone with higher \u03b1SOTE = 0.8 (refer Section 2.5 for further discussion on these values). It is noteworthy that, in comparing two different cases of \u03b1SOTE, the ratio of unit process equipment sizes (HPO storage vessel, compressor, electrolyser, and to a lesser extent solar PV system) is\n25 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\napproximately proportional to the ratio of \u03b1SOTE values, following a relationship of the general form of equation (9). \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc441 \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc442 \u2248 [\u221d\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46]1[\u221d\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46]2 (9)\nWhere \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc441 and \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc442 represent a characteristic equipment size of the system, such as HPO storage vessel size or compressor size. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, unit process equipment sizes for the integrated plant will become proportionally smaller as \u03b1SOTE is increased. Comparing traditional fine bubble diffusers having \u03b1SOTE = 0.2 with advanced aeration technologies capable of \u03b1SOTE = 0.8 means equipment could be reduced by a factor of 4, resulting in a significant reduction in capital cost and other infrastructure requirements associated with large process plants. The ASP DO level is set by the design and operational requirements of the WWTP and influences the HPO requirements and therefore HPO storage vessel and compressor requirements. Lower DO levels require reduced HPO rates and hence less storage and compression due to the increased efficiency of HPO use. Table 2 highlights the significant difference in HPO storage pressure vessel size when comparing design parameters. Large pressure vessels represent significant capital investment, particularly when considering supporting infrastructure. For example, the largest HPO storage vessel in Table 2 of 547 m3 requires more than 14 of the large vertical air receivers described in Section 2.8, noting a correction factor would be applied to derate the maximum operating pressure to 9.5 bar for this pressure vessel. Besides the large footprint required for this collection of air receivers, design and construction of the associated infrastructure is significant, such as concrete foundations, piping systems, etc. For the case of \u03b1SOTE = 0.8 and DO = 2 mg/L and considering high pressure gas cylinders operating at a higher pressure, HPO storage would require 8 x 15 cylinder packs (BOC, 2022) that may be feasibly installed at a WWTP. The HPO compressor power rating is the size required to meet the maximum duty throughout the 24-hour period and is therefore the minimum size required. The compressor power rating is governed both by the HPO flow and the maximum pressure, where instantaneous HPO flow is dependent on electricity available for electrolysis and pressure is dependent on the state of the HPO storage pressure vessel (refer Figure 8). In practice the actual compressor size would be the next highest commercially available size.\nFigure 9 highlights how the relative difference between solar PV system and electrolyser sizes deviates more at lower values of \u03b1SOTE, however the ratio of these unit sizes (i.e. PV solar system size divided by electrolyser size) remains in the range of 1.8. That is, the solar PV system should be about 80% larger than the electrolyser. The larger solar PV system accounts for the additional electricity required to operate the WWTP, and for morning and evening periods where solar PV output is below the minimum turn down ratio of the electrolyser.\n26 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\n27 Accepted 31 Dec 2022"

            "text": "The analysis uses measured data from a municipal WWTP in a case study and performs calculations to determine equipment sizes. There are practical implications when using the results that we consider here. The above analysis demonstrates how an integrated hydrogen production and wastewater treatment plant can utilise stored HPO from electrolysis for the ASP when considering solar PV output for average weather conditions in south-east Queensland. The case study is relevant\n28 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nto residential wastewater and other wastewater types, such as landfill leachate, is beyond the scope of this work. The temporal supply of HPO from water electrolysis is balanced with the demand from the ASP of wastewater treatment, where HPO storage enables energy load shifting for the WWTP. HPO is supplied to the ASP at a flow rate to match the variable oxygen demand of the incoming wastewater load while also overcoming HPO losses in the system, such as from bubbles formed by submerged fine bubble diffusers rising to the surface of the tank before HPO is completely dissolved.\nBeneficial use of oxygen is often overlooked in a hydrogen economy and this study has identified a valuable use that may otherwise be wasted. COES uses surplus electricity for electrolytic hydrogen production where the co-produced HPO is stored in a pressure vessel for later use. This benefits from producing hydrogen as a valuable commodity for saleable export, or even for longer term energy storage for an integrated plant. A detailed economic assessment of this configuration would consider capital cost of electrolysers and ancillary equipment but would also need to include operating costs and sale of hydrogen, including supply volume variability compared to commercially contracted offtake agreements. This detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this publication, but the scale of key equipment is analysed here.\nThe analysis also shows the profound effect of the efficiency of dissolving oxygen in wastewater (\u03b1SOTE) on the equipment size requirements. Conventional fine bubble diffusers in the ASP are highly inefficient, requiring much more oxygen than the ASP theoretically requires, resulting in unreasonably large equipment for the integrated plant. Use of more modern HPO delivery techniques and devices with higher efficiency aeration equipment such as a Speece cone is therefore vital for the feasibility of developing an integrated plant. While HPO transfer efficiency is important to minimise energy consumption, the rate of HPO transfer to the wastewater heavily influences the size of infrastructure, such as wastewater vessels and aeration equipment, and therefore capital costs. For example, fine bubble coalescence under high aeration rates can reduce the rate of HPO transfer and a more compact bioreactor with higher mixed liquor concentration is challenged by a lower alpha factor (Barreto et al., 2018). Municipal WWTPs represent substantial capital costs and therefore factors that impact the scale of capital investment is an important consideration in the design of an integrated plant.\nEven using high efficiency aeration equipment, the solar PV requirements are substantial where a 7 MW solar PV system is required for an aeration system capable of \u03b1SOTE = 0.8. At 2 to 3 hectares per MW of power generation (Department of Natural Resources, 2018), 14 to 21 hectares of land is often not available at a typical WWTP located in an urban environment, and significantly exceeds the most commonly installed solar PV system of 1 MW for WWTPs in California (Strazzabosco et al.,\n29 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\n2019). However, the number of large-scale solar PV installations is rapidly increasing, and an integrated hydrogen production and wastewater treatment facility presents a unique opportunity for increasing the utilisation of electricity generated by solar PV through the electricity grid. Storing hydrogen produced by electrolysis using renewable electricity is a key to achieving net zero emissions but using stored HPO in a wastewater treatment plant multiplies the benefits and may be considered an energy storage mechanism, like an oxygen battery for wastewater treatment.\nThis analysis considered a single 24-hour period representing an average day of solar PV power generation in south-east Queensland. This method neglects the stochastic nature of daily weather changes where energy production from solar PV varies from day to day. Using the HPO storage pressure vessel volume calculated in this analysis means HPO will be vented when solar PV output is higher on sunny days, and there may be insufficient oxygen for wastewater treatment on cloudy days. A larger HPO storage vessel is a potential solution, however the decision becomes more complex when alternate solutions such as backup HPO generation (Figure 1) system can be incorporated. Further to this, electrolysers configured for higher HPO output pressure, without additional mechanical compression, provide a stronger value proposition by reducing the scale of the system. Importing and exporting grid electricity, including the unit price for time of use, is a further complicating factor that may influence the optimum plant design. Hence, identifying the most suitable integrated plant design to consider all expected weather conditions and design configuration options requires assessment of a numerous complex parameters and is a topic for further research.\nThe electrolyser is central to integrated plant design and represents a significant capital investment and there is strong motivation to minimise its size. The operating characteristics of the electrolyser and the electrolyser efficiency, or specific power consumption per kilogram of hydrogen produced, was shown to play an important role in Section 3.4 in reducing the scale of solar PV system and the electrolyser. Electrolyser manufacturers can provide specific power consumption data however details are often classified as commercial in confidence. Supplementary Figure 2 is an example of how power consumption varies with load on the electrolyser and shows the minimum feasible turndown. As described in Section 2.7, this example may be considered conservative compared to other literature, however it is important to confirm the full scope of electricity usage for electrolysis and ensure the data represents the entire system. A minimum electrolyser turndown ratio of 20% of full load was used in this analysis and the impact on this was to shorten the duration of hydrogen and oxygen production when solar PV output was too low for the electrolyser but available for export. An alternative to using a single electrolyser unit could be implementing a bank of smaller\n30 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nunits that, when combined, allow the system to be operated at lower levels of solar PV output. Maximising the electrolyser utilisation is important, however a more significant consideration is that operating the system using solar PV means the electrolysis process is only used about 30% of its maximum potential over a 24-hour period. Operating the electrolyser during night-time periods requires an alternative source of electricity that requires consideration of other factors, including economic assessment as well as understanding the sustainability credentials of grid supplied or other electricity sources.\nHPO as a replacement for conventional aeration in the ASP has been the subject of investigation since the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s (McWhirter, 1978) with the primary motivation to reduce aeration power consumption and reduce the size of the treatment vessels by supporting higher mixed liquor concentrations. However, using HPO for wastewater treatment can have other benefits on biomass and effluent quality, including improved nitrogen removal efficiency and carbon and micropollutant removal (Skouteris et al., 2020). The biochemical mechanisms are complex and further research, including experimental studies, are needed. Understanding the relationship between HPO and these benefits can be considered in an assessment seeking an optimised design that includes a broader range of outcomes."

            "text": "This work demonstrates a viable integration of water electrolysis process and activated sludge process in wastewater treatment plants and the analysis determined the scale of renewable equipment, such as solar PV, electrolysers, and gas storage, that has not been previously well understood for such integrated plants. In addition to the new integration of previously discrete models for renewable water electrolysis and WWTPs to an integrated simulation, the key contribution of this paper is a novel energy shifting process using oxygen in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). We show in this work that the proposed energy shifting method via COES, that is like an \u201coxygen battery\u201d, can replace traditional aeration and eliminates the high energy consuming blowers supplying air to submerged fine bubble diffusers in conventional municipal WWTPs.\nThe analysis used a case study WWTP located in south-east Queensland, Australia serving 26,000 EP and oxygen demand was calculated from measured hourly ASP data and matched with simulated oxygen produced from renewable water electrolysis. An example configuration of the WWTP using renewable energy from solar PV to power the plant as well as the electrolysis system was analysed by simulating the plant response at hourly intervals over a typical 24-hour period. In this\n31 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nconfiguration, the existing fine bubble diffuser system is replaced with a process for high efficiency HPO utilisation in the ASP, such as a Speece cone. The results demonstrated the feasibility of storing oxygen co-produced by electrolysis and using it in the ASP of a full scale WWTP where the temporal energy consumption is changed to align with the timing of renewable electricity generation. The size of key equipment was determined by an optimisation algorithm with an objective set by a multi criteria analysis, providing valuable information to the hydrogen and wastewater industries for the design of an integrated plant.\nIt was demonstrated that the time period of oxygen demand in the ASP is suitable for using COES at WWTPs, answering the first research question for this work. This means that HPO from electrolysis can be used in the ASP that treats incoming wastewater and stored at times of peak electricity supply for use when oxygen demand of the WWTP outstrips supply capacity from electrolysis.\nThe second research question to assess the equipment sizes for the integrated plant was answered using an optimisation algorithm. The results showed the case study WWTP would require a 7 MW solar PV system, a 3.9 MW electrolyser, a HPO compressor of 112 kW, and a bank of oxygen gas cylinders with a combined water volume of 5.8 m3 rated to 200 bar MAWP. This configuration eliminates a backup HPO source and minimises HPO vented from the storage vessel. Inclusive of electricity for the HPO compressor, overall electricity usage for the case study WWTP was reduced. If traditional wastewater aeration with low oxygen transfer efficiency is used, the analysis showed equipment sizes were around four times larger.\nThe third research question to understand whether existing fine bubble diffuser systems in ASPs are suitable for using COES was investigated with results showing existing fine bubble diffuser systems in ASPs are not likely to be suitable for using COES due to the low SOTE. WWTPs will need to transition the ASP to using a modern aeration technique for COES to be feasible.\nThe final research question to determine the benefit of COES for municipal WWTPs identified that although COES is capable oftime shifting energy demand to facilitate the use of renewable electricity for energy intensive WWTPs, the COES method requires further follow-on work to assess other impacts on the WWTP operational performance and the overall economic viability. Further analysis is required to understand the trade-off between production of high value hydrogen energy and HPO for COES. This requires extension of the integrated process to simulate the complete WWTP process, including a stochastic analysis of the daily and seasonal solar PV variation. In addition, an assessment of other HPO applications, use of treated wastewater for electrolysis, and regeneration of renewable electricity from hydrogen via fuel cells would provide further insights.\n32 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nFinally, the results show that the stated hypothesis is true, when sustainable hydrogen production and wastewater treatment are integrated as a cohesive process, then it is feasible to match the renewable energy supply to the diurnal oxygen demand. This work is of significant value to hydrogen and wastewater industries and provides these industries with how an integrated plant could be configured. This work shows that integrating water electrolysis with WWTP via the COES method not only has environmental advantages of producing renewable hydrogen from sustainable water supply, but also a higher proportion of renewable electricity can displace grid electricity generated from fossil fuels presently used to power WWTPs.\n33 Accepted 31 Dec 2022\nAuthor Contributions Rickey Donald: Conceptualisation; Data curation; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Visualisation; Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing\nJonathan Love: Supervision; Writing \u2013 review & editing"
