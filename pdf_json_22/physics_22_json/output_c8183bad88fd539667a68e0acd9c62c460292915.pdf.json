            "text": "The detection of the late-time accelerating phase of the universe [48, 49] is one of the significant discoveries in cosmology which abruptly changed our ideas on the evolution of our universe. To describe this accelerating expansion, usually two well-known approaches are considered. One is the introduction of some hypothetical dark energy (DE) fluid in Einstein\u2019s General Relativity (GR), and the other is to either modify the Einstein\u2019s GR or introduce new gravitational theories. In the latter approach, the additional (new) geometrical terms appearing from the modified (new) gravitational theory mimic the role of a DE. Following both the approaches, several cosmological models have been proposed in the last several years to explain the dynamics of the universe [12, 14, 16, 18, 40, 41, 54]. Among these models, the \u039b-Cold Dark Matter (\u039bCDM) cosmological model, designed in the context of GR, has been quite successful in describing a large span of astronomical and cosmological data. However, the physics of the primary two ingredients in the \u039bCDM paradigm, namely, the cold dark matter and cosmological constant is not yet clearly understood despite many astronomical missions. Apart from that, the cosmological constant problem [58], and the coincidence problem [59] require explanation in this cosmological scenario. These are not the only limitations in this successful cosmological model. It has been consistently observed that some key cosmological parameters estimated from the early time measurements by Planck within this minimal \u039bCDM cosmology [3] significantly differ from other astronomical missions [1, 32, 33, 35, 50]. The most statistically significant discrepancy (at 5\u03c3) is the Hubble constant tension between Planck [3] and Supernovae H0 for the Equation of State (SH0ES) collaboration [50] which demands a revision of the \u039bCDM cosmology. On the other hand, the tension in the growth of structures, quantified through the parameter S8, defined as a combination of the amplitude of the matter power spectrum \u03c38 with the\nmatter density at present \u2126m (S8 = \u03c38 \u221a \u2126m/0.3) between Planck and cosmic shear measurements [1, 32, 33, 35] has been another issue which has further strengthened the revision of the \u039bCDM cosmology. The cosmological discrepancies have been one of the hot topics at present moment which fueled the scientific community to find an alternative to the \u039bCDM cosmology, see Refs. [2, 21, 22, 25, 47] which include a variety of cosmological models attempting to explain these discrepancies. However, despite many attempts performed by a large number of investigators (see again [2, 21, 22, 25, 47]), the tension free cosmological\n3 model is yet to be discovered. In order to be more transparent in this direction, it should be mentioned that the simultaneous solutions to both the tensions is hard to achieve. Due to the existing correlation between H0 and S8, the solution of the H0 tension in a specific cosmological model may worsen the tension in the S8 parameter in the same cosmological model. Moreover, the solution to the Hubble H0 tension in a cosmological model can increase the tension in the sound horizon rd derived from the cosmic microwave background, and other cosmological probes [6]. As the full cosmic picture is yet to be discovered, there is certainly no reason to favor any cosmological model over the others. Motivated by this, in the present work we investigate a cosmological dynamics which arises from a generalized Einstein-Hilbert action, and interestingly, this offers a novel route to reproduce the interacting DM-DE models without any phenomenological basis1.\nIn this work we consider the cosmological dynamics in the Weyl Integrable geometry, a generalization of the Einstein-Hilbert action. We note that the Weyl Integrable spacetime did not get much attention in the literature without any specific reason (only a few works discussing the astrophysical and cosmological consequences are available [5, 28, 42\u201344, 51\u2013 53]). While it is interesting to notice that within this cosmological domain, one can mimic the late-time cosmic acceleration [4, 39] and also the early inflationary phase [26]. Here we have explicitly found here, the Weyl Integrable geometry has a very novel feature which enlightens the cosmology of interacting DM-DE models by offering a field theoretical prescription. It is widely known that the theory of interacting dark matter - dark energy (known as interacting dark energy or coupled dark energy) has gained significant attention for solving several cosmological problems, such as the cosmic coincidence problem (see Refs. [8, 19, 20, 34]), cosmological tensions (see Ref. [25]). Here we explicitly show that the Weyl Integrable geometry can offer a solid foundation to the theory of interacting dark energy. The interacting dark energy models are mostly governed by some phenomenological choices of the interaction function, which modifies the expansion history at the background and perturbation levels. Although attempts to construct the interaction function from the action formalisms have been considered in the literature [10, 11, 17, 29, 45, 56], nevertheless, we are not done yet. In the present work, we show that the dark sectors\u2019 interaction naturally arises\n1 Let us note that the interacting DM-DE models are very promising to alleviate the Hubble tension, see\nTables B1 and B2 of [25].\n4 in the context of Weyl Integrable spacetime quite very naturally without any mathematical complexities. This result is one of the exciting outcomes of this work. Having this novel feature, we performed the dynamical system analysis of the underlying cosmological scenario in the background of a nonflat Friedmann-Lema\u0302\u0131tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) line element. The assumption of the nonflat FLRW universe model is not an artist\u2019s imagination but rather the analyses of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies from Planck (considering the Pilk likelihood) favour a closed universe at several standard deviations [3, 23, 24, 31].\nInteractive matter-scalar field schemes have been explored before where the conservation\nequations have the structure\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H (\u03c1m + pm) = Q, \u03c6\u0307 [ \u03c6\u0308+ 3H\u03c6\u0307+ V \u2032(\u03c6) ] = \u2212Q, (1)\nwhere a dot means derivative with respect to cosmic time t, comma derivative with respect to \u03c6, \u03c1m is the energy density of matter, \u03c6 is the scalar field, V (\u03c6) its potential, Q is the interaction term, and H = a\u0307/a = \u03b8/3 stands for the Hubble parameter (which is a general measure of the isotropic rate of spatial expansion), where a denotes the scale factor of the universe.\nIn Ref. [37] such a scalar field cosmology with a generalized harmonic potential was investigated in flat and negatively curved Friedmann-Lema\u0302\u0131tre-Robertson-Walker and Bianchi I metrics. An interaction between the scalar field and matter is considered in the form Q = \u2212\u00b5/2\u03c1m\u03c6\u0307. Asymptotic methods and averaging theory were used to obtain relevant information about the solution space. In this approach, the Hubble parameter played the role of a time-dependent perturbation parameter which controls the magnitude of the error between full-system and time-averaged solutions as it decreases. This approach shows that full and time-averaged systems have the same asymptotic behaviour. Numerical simulations were presented as evidence of such behaviour. Moreover, the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions is independent of the coupling function.\nInteractive schemes like (1) naturally appears in Scalar Tensor theory (STT) of gravity. Say, a general class of STTs, written in the so-called Einstein frame (EF), which is given by [36]\nSEF = \u222b M4 d4x \u221a |g| { 1 2 R\u2212 1 2 g\u00b5\u03bd\u2207\u00b5\u03c6\u2207\u03bd\u03c6\u2212 V (\u03c6) + \u03c7(\u03c6)\u22122Lmatter(\u00b5,\u2207\u00b5, \u03c7(\u03c6)\u22121g\u03b1\u03b2) } ,\n(2)\n5 where R is the curvature scalar, \u03c6 is the scalar field, \u2207\u03b1 is the covariant derivative, V (\u03c6) is the quintessence self-interacting potential, \u03c7(\u03c6)\u22122 is the coupling function, Lmatter is the matter Lagrangian, and \u00b5 is a collective name for the matter degrees of freedom, repeated indexes mean sum over them. The energy-momentum tensor of matter is defined by\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212 2\u221a |g| \u03b4 \u03b4g\u03b1\u03b2\n{\u221a |g|\u03c7\u22122(\u03c6)L(\u00b5,\u2207\u00b5, \u03c7\u22121(\u03c6)g\u03b1\u03b2) } . (3)\nBy considering the conformal transformation g\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c7(\u03c6) \u22121g\u03b1\u03b2, defining the Brans-Dicke (BD) coupling \u201cconstant\u201d \u03c9(\u03c7) in such way that d\u03c6 = \u00b1 \u221a \u03c9(\u03c7) + 3/2\u03c7\u22121d\u03c7 and recalling V (\u03c7) = \u03c72V (\u03c6(\u03c7)), the action (2) can be written in the Jordan frame (JF) as [15]\nSJF = \u222b M4 d4x \u221a |g| { 1 2 \u03c7R\u2212 1 2 \u03c9(\u03c7) \u03c7 (\u2207\u03c7)2 \u2212 V (\u03c7) + Lmatter(\u00b5,\u2207\u00b5, g\u03b1\u03b2) } . (4)\nHere the bar is used to denote geometrical objects defined with respect to the metric g\u03b1\u03b2. In the STT given by (4), the energy-momentum of the matter fields,\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212 2\u221a |g| \u03b4 \u03b4g\u03b1\u03b2\n{\u221a |g|L(\u00b5,\u2207\u00b5, g\u03b1\u03b2) } , (5)\nis separately conserved. That is \u2207\u03b1T\u03b1\u03b2 = 0. However, when is written in the EF (2), with a matter energy-momentum tensor given by (3), this is no longer the case (although the overall energy density is conserved). In fact in the EF we find that\nQ\u03b2 \u2261 \u2207\u03b1T\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212 1 2 T\u03c7(\u03c6)\u22121 d\u03c7(\u03c6) d\u03c6 \u2207\u03b2\u03c6, T = T\u03b1\u03b1 . (6)\nFor action (2), the strength of the coupling between the perfect fluid and the scalar field is Q = 1 2 (4 \u2212 3\u03b3)\u03c1m\u03c6\u0307d ln\u03c7(\u03c6)d\u03c6 , where \u03c7(\u03c6) is an input function. In reference [9] the interaction terms (in the flat FLRW geometry) Q = \u03b1\u03c6\u0307\u03c1m and Q = \u03b1\u03c1mH were investigated, here \u03b1 is a constant, \u03c6 is the scalar field, \u03c1 is the energy density of background matter and H is the Hubble parameter. The first choice corresponds to an exponential coupling function \u03c7(\u03c6) = \u03c70 exp (2\u03b1\u03c6/(4\u2212 3\u03b3)) . The second case corresponds to the choice \u03c7 = \u03c70a\u22122\u03b1/(4\u22123\u03b3) (and then, \u03c1 \u221d a\u03b1\u22123\u03b3). Other models within the general setup (1), incorporates effective interaction terms Q = 3\u03b1H\u03c1m, Q = 3\u03b2H\u03c1\u03c6 and Q = 3H(\u03b1\u03c1m + \u03b2\u03c1\u03c6) [13, 38].\nThe article has been organized as follows. In section 2, we provide the gravitational equations of the Weyl Integrable spacetime in the FLRW universe model. In section 3 we perform the dynamical system analysis of the cosmological scenario considering the spatial curvature of the universe. Finally, in section 4 we describe the main findings of this article in brief.\n6"

For the above FLRW metric, with lapse function N = 1, one can write down the Friedmann equations for dust matter (pm = 0) as follows ( \u03b82\n3 +\n3K\na2\n) \u2212 \u03bb\n2 \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\u2212 e\u2212 \u03c6 2 \u03c1m = 0, (11)\n7 \u03b8\u0307 + \u03b82\n2 +\n3K 2a2 \u2212 3 2 V (\u03c6) + 3 4 \u03bb\u03c6\u03072 = 0, (12)\n\u03c6\u0308+ \u03b8\u03c6\u0307+ 1\n\u03bb V,\u03c6 +\n1\n2\u03bb e\u2212 \u03c6 2 \u03c1m = 0, (13)\n\u02d9\u03c1m + \u03b8\u03c1m \u2212 \u03c1m\u03c6\u0307 = 0. (14)\nwhere we have considered the comoving observer u\u00b5 = \u03b4\u00b5t , an overhead dot represents the cosmic time differentiation and \u03b8 = 3a\u0307/a is the expansion rate of the FLRW universe. The conservation equations for the scalar field and the matter sector are of special importance in this context. The eqns. (13) and (14) can be alternatively expressed as\n\u03c1\u0307\u03c6 + \u03b8(\u03c1\u03c6 + p\u03c6) = \u2212 1\n2 \u03c1\u0303 \u03c6\u0307, (15)\n\u02d9\u0303\u03c1+ \u03b8(\u03c1\u0303+ p\u0303) = 1\n2 \u03c1\u0303 \u03c6\u0307, (16)\nwhere \u03c1\u03c6 = \u03bb 2 (\u03c6\u03072 +V (\u03c6)), p\u03c6 = \u03bb 2 (\u03c6\u03072\u2212V (\u03c6)) and p\u0303 = 0. One can clearly see that the above two equations represent an interacting two-fluid system: \u2207\u03bdT \u00b5\u03bd\u03c6 = \u2212Q(t) = \u2212\u2207\u03bdT \u00b5\u03bd matter where the interaction function Q(t) is given by\nQ(t) = 1\n2 \u03c1\u0303(t) \u03c6\u0307(t). (17)\nEqs. (15)-(16) realizes such an interactive scheme like (1), with pm = 0 (dust matter). It is a very intriguing result in this context because the above formalism naturally induces an interaction between the scalar field and the matter field without mathematical complexities. We note that in General Relativity, usually one needs to introduce the interaction between the dark matter and dark energy by hand, but here in the WIST, one can see that an interaction term Q is already present. It is one of the essences of WIST where we naturally have an interaction term between the scalar field and the matter sector. We further note that the above interaction may allow a changeable sign property depending on the sign of \u03c6\u0307. We refer to Refs. [7, 27, 30, 46, 55, 57] where the sign changeable interaction functions have been investigated from the phenomenological ground.\nIn the line of cosmological parameters, the equation of state parameter for the effective\nfluid is defined to be wtot (t) := ptot(t) \u03c1tot(t) , and it is related to the deceleration parameter q(t), in the presence of curvature, by\nq (t) := \u22121\u2212 3\u03b8\u0307(t) \u03b8(t)2 = (1 + 3wtot (t)) 2\n( 1 +\n9K\na(t)\u03b8(t)2\n) . (18)\n8 Since in this study we consider that the matter source is that of the dust fluid, i.e pm = 0, from equation (14), it follows \u03c1m = \u03c1m0a \u22123e\u03c6, thus we end with the set of differential equations (11), (12) and (13).\nIn the following section we present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the field equations (11), (12), (13) and (14) by investigating the stationary points and their stability in new dimensionless variables. Such an analysis is essential to understand further the effects of the curvature term in the cosmological dynamics of the WIST."

            "text": "The discrepancies in the cosmological data and the universe\u2019s curvature are two major issues in cosmology at present. The first one indicates the need of revision of the standard cosmological model \u039bCDM, and the second issue directly questions the geometry of the universe by pointing toward a preference for a closed universe at several standard deviations [3, 23, 24, 31].\nThe revision of the \u039bCDM model has been performed in various ways, and modification of Einstein\u2019s gravitational theory is one of them. Even though a cluster of cosmological models has been proposed in the literature, none of them can explain all the observational discrepancies. Thus, from this ground, all cosmological models are equivalent. In the present article, we have considered a modification of Einstein\u2019s gravity, namely, the Weyl Integrable geometry and explored the cosmological scenarios in the presence of the nonflat FLRW line element as this describes the most generalized cosmic structure.\nWe have found some exciting results from this modified gravitational theory. In particular, we found that the dark sector\u2019s interaction naturally arises in this context without any mathematical complexities. That fills a gap in the literature on interacting cosmology, which is mainly driven by the phenomenological choices of the interaction function. In order to understand the nature of the cosmological scenario derived from this gravitational framework, we performed the dynamical system analysis and found a variety of possibilities.\nThe admitted stationary points of the dynamical system corresponding to ten families of points, which can describe all the possible FLRW universes with zero and non-zero spatial curvature. We conclude that the future attractors of the dynamical system describe spatially flat FLRW geometries. Moreover, exact solutions with acceleration are recovered. We conclude that Weyl Integrable geometry can solve the flatness problem. Additionally, this is one of the first studies in literature where interacting models in the dark sector are discussed in the presence of curvature.\nIn future, we plan to investigate further this cosmological scenario by studying the evo-\nlution of the perturbations near the stationary points for the background geometry.\n18"
