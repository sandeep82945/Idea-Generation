 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore the scope of the reaction with different substituted styrenes. The paper only examined a few examples, but there is an opportunity to investigate how electronic effects impact the reaction. 

2. Optimize the reaction conditions. The yields were good but there may be room to further improve the efficiency by tweaking solvents, temperatures, reagents, etc.

3. Develop an enantioselective version of the reaction by using a chiral oxidant or catalyst. This could allow access to enantiomerically enriched indole products.

4. Investigate the mechanism in more detail using computational methods or spectroscopic techniques. A deeper understanding could lead to better control and predictability. 

5. Apply the methodology to synthesize other heterocyclic ring systems beyond indoles, such as benzofurans or carbazoles. The oxidation/cyclization/elimination concept may be generalizable.
