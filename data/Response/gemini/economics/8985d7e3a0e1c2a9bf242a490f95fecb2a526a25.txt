1. **Investigate the relationship between different notions of stability and optimality in the network setting.** The paper defines new notions of stability and optimality that are compatible with IC in the network setting. However, the relationship between these different notions is not fully understood. Future research could explore this relationship in more detail, and investigate whether there are other notions of stability and optimality that are also compatible with IC.


2. **Design new mechanisms that satisfy the theoretical boundaries for diffusion one-sided matching.** The paper shows that the theoretical boundaries for diffusion one-sided matching are stable-cc and optimal-c. However, no existing mechanism can satisfy both of these properties. Future research could focus on designing new mechanisms that can achieve these theoretical boundaries.


3. **Study the impact of different social network structures on the performance of diffusion one-sided matching mechanisms.** The paper assumes that the social network is a given input. However, in practice, the social network can be influenced by the design of the mechanism. Future research could investigate how different social network structures affect the performance of diffusion one-sided matching mechanisms, and how the mechanism can be designed to promote the formation of social networks that are conducive to efficient matching.


4. **Extend the results of the paper to other types of matching markets.** The paper focuses on one-sided matching markets with initial endowments. However, there are many other types of matching markets, such as two-sided matching markets and matching markets without initial endowments. Future research could extend the results of the paper to these other types of matching markets.


5. **Apply the ideas from the paper to other domains.** The ideas from the paper could be applied to other domains beyond matching markets. For example, they could be used to design mechanisms for allocating resources in other settings, such as housing allocation or school choice. Future research could explore these applications and investigate how the ideas from the paper can be adapted to different domains.
