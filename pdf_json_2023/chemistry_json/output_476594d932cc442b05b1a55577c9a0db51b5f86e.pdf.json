    "abstractText": "Due to the inability of conventional wastewater treatment procedures to remove organic pharmaceutical pollutants, active pharmaceutical components remain in wastewater and even reach tap water. In terms of pharmaceutical pollutants, the scientific community focuses on \u03b2-blockers due to their extensive (over)usage and moderately high solubility. In this study, the photocatalytic activity of V2O5 was investigated through the degradation of nadolol (NAD), pindolol (PIN), metoprolol (MET), and their mixture under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in water. For the preparation of V2O5, facile hydrothermal synthesis was used. The structural, morphological, and surface properties and purity of synthesized V2O5 powder were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray, and Raman spectroscopy. SEM micrographs showed hexagonal-shaped platelets with welldefined morphology of materials with diameters in the range of 10\u201365 \u03bcm and thickness of around a few microns. X-ray diffraction identified only one crystalline phase in the sample. The Raman scattering measurements taken on the catalyst confirmed the result of XRPD. Degradation kinetics were monitored by ultra-fast liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The results showed that in individual solutions, photocatalytic degradation of MET and NAD was relatively insignificant (<10%). However, in the PIN case, the degradation was significant (64%). In the mixture, the photodegradation efficiency of MET and NAD slightly increased (15% and 13%). Conversely, it reduced the PIN to the still satisfactory value of 40%. Computational analysis based on molecular and periodic density functional theory calculations was used to complement our experimental findings. Calculations of the average local ionization energy indicate that the PIN is the most reactive of all three considered molecules in terms of removing an electron from it.",

Their\nmutual reactions may manifest additional health and environmental risks caused by un-\nexpected interactions between them.\nConventional water treatment plants (WWTPs) lack the potential to remove emerg-\ning pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, especially \u03b2-blockers [9]. The poor efficiency of\nconventional WWTPs in removing \u03b2-blockers is proven by the presence of \u03b2-blockers in\nvarious water organisms [10]. The average removal efficiency of these compounds is\naround 30-40% [11]. The degradation of individual \u03b2-blockers depends on various factors,\nsuch as temperature, pH value, compound's polarity, cation-exchange properties, biodeg-\nradability, etc. [12]. Multiple strategies have been applied in their removals, such as ad-\nsorption [13], chemical treatment for tackling water contamination, and advanced oxida-\ntion processes (AOPs) [14,15]. However, to achieve easy operation, low equipment cost,\nand cheap raw materials, AOPs are highly desirable. In addition, AOP, such as photodeg-\nradation, is considered most commonly used due to its ability to remove most organic\npollutants from water [16]. To prevent and eliminate their unexpected toxic properties,\nthere is a need for new efficient methods and materials for \u03b2-blockers removal from the\nwater environment. A slow degradation rate during photolysis requires catalysts acti-\nvated by interaction with light, after which the degradation process is more efficient [8].\nFor more than ten years, semiconductor-based photocatalysts have focused on water pu-\nrification because of their high potential for the degradation of pollutants [17]. Some latest\nphotocatalysts used are nanocrystalline M-type hexaferrite Ca0.5Pb0.5-xYbxZnyFe12-yO19 syn-\nthesized by sol\u2013gel autocombustion method [15], the C3N4x/AgOy@Co1-xBi1-yO7 synthe-\nsized by the combination of sol\u2013gel and annealing approaches [14], porous methacrylic\norganosilica materials (Ag@PMOS) synthesized by reducing the silver moieties on and in\nthe surfaces of porous methacrylic organic silicates [18], V2O5 nanoparticles [19], V2O5 na-\nnorods [20], etc.\nFig re 1. tr ct r l f r las of st ie beta blockers.\nonventional water treatment plants (WWTPs) lack the potential to remove emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, especially \u03b2-blockers [9].

Following previously obtained results (Table 1), the V2O5 catalyst showed significant photocatalytic activity toward various organic pollutants [21,23\u201327]. Most studied molecules are branched with at least one aromatic ring and nitrogen and oxygen atoms in their structure. Degradation pathways and degra-\nMolecules 2023, 28, 655 3 of 18\ndation rate is determined by the nature of substituents on aromatic rings [25]. For example, Fu et al. noted that surface OH groups play a vital role in increasing the degradation rate of nitrobenzene and methylene blue after introducing Al2O3 particles. The structural similarity of previously investigated compounds and selected \u03b2-blockers and obtained results in those experiments served as a starting point for this research.\nIn this paper, we investigate the photocatalytic properties of V2O5 nanopowder for the degradation of three \u03b2-blockers (MET, NAD, and PIN) separately and in a mixture. Several methods of characterization, such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) measurements, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, are employed to correlate structural and morphological properties of synthesized nanopowders and their photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The efficiency of the photodegradation process was compared with the efficiency of direct photolysis (DF). The experimentally obtained results were correlated with the molecular and periodic DFT analysis to explain the influence of molecular structure on the efficiency of the degradation process."

To explain the observed difference in degradation efficiencies, we performed a computational analysis of all molecules in the framework of the DFT approach. Since the degradation efficiency generally depends on the reactivity of molecules and photophysical properties of the catalyst, we decided to compare the reactivity of considered molecules by calculating the average local ionization energy (ALIE), a well-known quantum molecular descriptor. The analysis of the ALIE quantum-molecular descriptor precisely identifies the PIN molecule as the most reactive of all three considered, see Figure 11.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 655 10 of 18\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 19 To explain the observed difference in degradation efficiencies, we performed a com-\nputational analysis of all molecules in the framework of the DFT approach.

The results presented in Figure 11 in-\ndicate that the PIN is by far the most reactive of all three considered molecules in terms of\nhow easy it is to remove an electron from it. Both MET and NAD have relatively similar\nlowest values of the ALIE descriptor (the difference is ~4 kcal/mol).

            "text": "For the preparation of V2O5, facile hydrothermal synthesis was used. X-ray diffraction identifies only one crystalline phase in the sample, which is proven by the fact that the crystallite size (1251(35) \u00c5) and lattice strain (0.16(2)%) values point to well-crystallized material with a significant lattice strain. SEM micrographs show that hexagonal-shaped platelets with well-defined morphology were obtained as substantial entities with diameters in the range of 10\u201365 \u00b5m and thicknesses of around a few microns, following previously conducted similar procedures available in the literature. EDS spectra indicate that the main elements of the catalyst are vanadium and oxygen with no other impurities, and the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 655 14 of 18\nestimated contribution of each component is close to stoichiometric V2O5. The Raman scattering measurements taken on the catalyst confirmed the result of XRPD. The efficiency of DF of the individual solutions was poor, except for PIN (10% for MET, 15% for NAD, and 30% for PIN). Adding a catalyst in the water solution of MET and NAD did not improve the degradation. However, the degradation efficiency of PIN increased up to 64% within 120 min. This study considered various perspectives to determine why PIN showed the highest efficiency. The fact that PIN absorbs light at a wavelength of around 200 nm and has relatively strong light absorption at 260 nm may indicate its superior degradation efficiency over the other two molecules. Calculations of ALIE indicate that the PIN is by far the most reactive of all three considered molecules in terms of how easy it is to remove an electron from it. MET and NAD have similar minimal ALIE values, and PIN has around 14 kcal/mol lower minimal ALIE value than NAD and about 19 kcal/mol more down minimal ALIE value than MET. Moreover, the pH value indicated different intermediates of photocatalysis. Namely, following the fact that PIN degradation was at a pH value below 4, it can be concluded that PIN degradation occurs via h+. A photocatalytic study of a mixture of NAD, MET, and PIN, as they occur in nature, shows that the degradation processes for MET and NAD were accelerated compared to individual solutions of these two compounds. This can be explained by a higher concentration of NAD and MET molecules on the surface of the catalyst, which also explains the lower decomposition efficiency of PIN. Conditions in the mixture were acidic, with a pH value higher than in individual solutions. pH values were changing differently, indicating the other degradation mechanism and generation of various intermediates during the degradation process. This and other research demonstrated that V2O5 has a significant potential for practical applications to eliminate organic pollutants from the most precious natural resource\u2014water. However, an extensive literature survey performed for this research has indicated several more essential facts regarding the potential of V2O5 for practical applications. One of the most important facts concerns bandgap engineering in the case of the V2O5. Namely, it was demonstrated that the bandgap value can be efficiently tuned, either by manipulating the structure of V2O5 or by applying an external stimulus. It has been reported that the band gap of V2O5 can either be decreased or increased, depending on the selected technique. The ability to finely tune the band gap of V2O5 is essential for its practical application as a photocatalyst. Finally, the readily available synthesis of this material is one more factor determining the bright future of the material.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.J.A.; data curation, S.J.A., A.J.K., A.B., M.M.S., N.T., M.\u0160., M.G.-B. and S.A.; formal analysis, S.J.A., A.J.K., A.B., M.M.S., N.T., A.K., M.\u0160., M.G.-B. and S.A.; funding acquisition, S.J.A.; investigation, S.J.A., A.J.K., A.B., M.M.S., N.T., A.K., M.\u0160., M.G.-B. and S.A.; methodology, S.J.A., M.\u0160. and S.A.; project administration, S.J.A. and N.T.; resources, S.A.; software, S.J.A. and S.A.; supervision, S.J.A. and S.A.; validation, S.J.A., A.B., M.M.S., M.G.-B. and S.A.; visualization, S.J.A., A.J.K., A.B., M.M.S., N.T., M.\u0160., M.G.-B. and S.A.; writing\u2014original draft, S.J.A., A.J.K., A.B., M.M.S., N.T., M.\u0160., M.G.-B. and S.A.; writing\u2014revision, S.J.A., A.J.K., A.B., M.M.S., N.T., M.\u0160., M.G.-B., J.C\u0301. and S.A.
