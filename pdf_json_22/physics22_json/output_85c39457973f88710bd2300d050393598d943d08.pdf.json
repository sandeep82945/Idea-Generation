    "abstractText": "Green\u2019s functions of fermions are described by matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions. Since analytic continuation is fundamentally an ill-posed problem, the causal space described by the matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna structure can be instrumental in improving the accuracy and in enhancing the robustness with respect to noise. We demonstrate a three-pronged procedure for robust analytic continuation called PES: (1) Projection of data to the causal space. (2) Estimation of pole locations. (3) Semidefinite relaxation within the causal space. We compare the performance of PES with the recently developed Nevanlinna and Carath\u00e9odory continuation methods and find that PES is more robust in the presence of noise and does not require the usage of extended precision arithmetics. We also demonstrate that a causal projection improves the performance of the Nevanlinna and Carath\u00e9odory methods. The PES method is generalized to bosonic response functions, for which the Nevanlinna and Carath\u00e9odory continuation methods have not yet been developed. It is particularly useful for studying spectra with sharp features, as they occur in the study of molecules and band structures in solids.",

Since analytic continuation is fundamentally an ill-posed problem, the causal space described by the matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna structure can be instrumental in improving the accuracy and in enhancing the robustness with respect to noise. We demonstrate a three-pronged procedure for robust analytic continuation called PES: (1) Projection of data to the causal space. (2) Estimation of pole locations. (3) Semidefinite relaxation within the causal space. We compare the performance of PES with the recently developed Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory continuation methods and find that PES is more robust in the presence of noise and does not require the usage of extended precision arithmetics. We also demonstrate that a causal projection improves the performance of the Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory methods. The PES method is generalized to bosonic response functions, for which the Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory continuation methods have not yet been developed. It is particularly useful for studying spectra with sharp features, as they occur in the study of molecules and band structures in solids.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nGreen\u2019s functions of quantum many-body systems are central subjects in condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum field theory. Due to the difficulty of performing correlated finite-temperature calculations on the real axis, numerical methods typically obtain results on the Matsubara axis and employ analytic continuation as a postprocessing tool to infer Green\u2019s functions along the real axis. Analytic continuation is fundamentally an ill-posed problem, and many numerical methods have been developed, such as the Pade\u0301 fit [1, 2], maximum entropy (MaxEnt) [3\u20137], stochastic analytic continuation and its variants [8\u201311], sparse modeling [12, 13], and machine learning approaches [14, 15]. All these methods encounter difficulties in satisfying causality, recovering sharp features, resolving multiple features, and/or capturing high frequency information in the spectra. Furthermore, most methods have been developed only for diagonal entries of the Green\u2019s function. The analytic continuation of off-diagonal entries of the Green\u2019s function [16\u201320] is often attempted by diagonalizing the Green\u2019s function at a certain Matsubara frequency, conducting the analytic continuation only of the diagonal entries with respect to the transformed basis at other frequencies, and neglecting the remaining non-diagonal entries. The fermionic Green\u2019s functions is a special type of matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions. These functions have a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, and have been (somewhat incon-\n\u2217 linlin@math.berkeley.edu\nsistently) named after renowned mathematicians including Carathe\u0301odory, Herglotz, Nevanlinna, Pick, and Riesz. They are also sometimes called R-functions [21]. The name matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions adopted in this paper follows the suggestion in [22]. This crucial analytic structure has only been taken into account recently by the Nevanlinna continuation method [23] for diagonal entries of Green\u2019s functions, and by the Carathe\u0301odory method [24] for both diagonal and offdiagonal entries. In the absence of noise, these methods have reached unprecedented accuracy in analytic continuation by resolving complicated spectral functions with multiple features. However, these methods also have notable drawbacks. (1) They are not numerically stable, and extended precision arithmetic operations (128 bits of precision or higher) are needed to carry out such calculations (even in the absence of noise). Therefore the computational cost of the analytic continuation (especially for the Carathe\u0301odory continuation) can be large. (2) The Nevanlinna/Carathe\u0301odory interpolants exist if and only if Pick\u2019s criterion [23, 25, 26] is satisfied by the Matsubara data. In practice, noisy data often violates Pick\u2019s criterion, meaning that the computational result is not guaranteed to be causal. (3) In their standard form, matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna structure is only applicable to fermions, and hence these methods are not directly applicable to bosonic systems.\nThe Herglotz-Nevanlinna function and its interpolation have been thoroughly studied in areas such as the control theory (see e.g., [27] and [28, Chapter 9.2]). The problem of analytic continuation is also intimately related to problems in signal processing, and in particular fitting with exponential functions (see e.g., [29\u201331]). One advantage of Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory methods is that they require little prior knowledge of the structure\n2 of Green\u2019s functions. With further prior knowledge of the lower and upper bound of the absolute value of the pole locations, Ying recently showed that a modified Prony\u2019s method can be used for performing analytic continuation with noisy data with multiple features using only double precision arithmetic operations [32, 33].\nIn this article, we propose a three-pronged ProjectionEstimation-Semidefinite relaxation (PES) method to perform analytic continuation within the causal space, while avoiding the aforementioned drawbacks. The meaning of the three steps are as follows: (1) Projection of the noisy data into the causal space; (2) Estimation of pole locations using the adaptive Antoulas\u2013Anderson (AAA) algorithm [34]; (3) Semidefinite relaxation (SDR) fitting of Green\u2019s functions (diagonal and off-diagonal elements) using a bi-level optimization approach [35]. Each step of the approach aims at resolving certain aspects of the difficulties in the analytic continuation of noisy Matsubara Green\u2019s functions. The prior knowledge needed for the PES method is comparable to that in Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory methods. We demonstrate that the PES method can robustly perform analytical continuation of noisy data using standard double precision arithmetic operations, and is applicable to both fermionic and bosonic systems. Table I compares the PES method with the Nevanlinna, Carathe\u0301odory, MaxEnt, and Pade\u0301 method. We emphasize that each of the three steps of PES can also be useful in improving the robustness of other analytic continuation methods. For instance, the projection step can be employed as a data pre-processing step that significantly improves the robustness of the Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory continuation for noisy data. The semidefinite relaxation can be combined with other continuation methods as a post-processing refinement.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the theory of the PES method. After giving a brief discussion on the setup of the analytic continuation problem in Section II.1, we explain in detail each of the three steps of the PES method: the pre-processing step using semidefinite projection in Section II.2, the poleestimation step using AAA algorithm in Section II.3 and the SDR fitting step using SDR and bi-level optimization in Section II.4. We summarize the PES method in Section II.5. The numerical results are presented in Section III. With the Hubbard dimer example, we compare the results of our methods with the Nevanlinna, Carathe\u0301odory and MaxEnt methods, and show that the PES method is both noise-robust and efficient for sharp features, and recovers both diagonal and off-diagonal entries. We also demonstrate the necessity of the pole estimation step using this model. In Section III.2, we show that the PES method is also applicable to bosonic response functions and has a much better performance compared to MaxEnt. In Section III.3, in order to demonstrate the strength of the PES method, we conduct analytic continuations for the band structure of solids with hundreds of orbitals."

Analytic structure of Green\u2019s functions\nLet c\u0302i, c\u0302 \u2020 i be the annihilation and creation operator for the i-th orbital, i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Norb, where Norb is the number of orbitals.

The nega-\ntive sign corresponds to bosons, while the positive sign corresponds to fermions. Since Gij(z) is defined for i, j \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Norb}, the Green\u2019s function G can be viewed as a Norb \u00d7Norb matrix. In other words, we haveG(z) = \u2211\nr,s\nXr,s\nz \u2212 \u03bbr,s where\n\u03bbr,s = Er \u2212 Es \u2208 R and Xr,s = cr,svr,sv \u2020 r,s is a rank-1 Norb \u00d7Norb matrix, in which\ncr,s = e\u2212\u03b2Es \u2213 e\u2212\u03b2Er\nZ , vr,s(i) = \u3008\u03a8r| c\u0302\n\u2020 i |\u03a8s\u3009 . (2)\nHere vr,s(i) is the i-th component of vr,s. Note that for fermionic systems, cr,s is always nonnegative. For bosonic systems, we have cr,s > 0 if Er > Es, or equivalently \u03bbr,s > 0; while cr,s < 0 if Er < Es, or equivalently \u03bbr,s < 0. For orthogonal orbitals, the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the canonical relation [c\u0302i, c\u0302 \u2020 j ]\u2213 = c\u0302ic\u0302 \u2020 j \u2213 c\u0302 \u2020 j c\u0302i = \u03b4ij .

For the rest of this\narticle, let us compress the indices r, s into l, and let Np be the number of matrices Xr,s that are nonzero, i.e., the number of poles \u03bbr,s that actually contribute to the Green\u2019s function. In this way, the Green\u2019s function G(z) can be written as\nG(z) =\nNp \u2211\nl=1\nXl\nz \u2212 \u03bbl , (4)\nwhere Xl satisfies the rank-1 semidefinite condition:\nFor bosons: sign(\u03bbl) \u00b7 Xl is an Norb \u00d7Norb\nrank-1 positive semidefinite matrix; (5)\nFor fermions: Xl is an Norb \u00d7Norb\nrank-1 positive semidefinite matrix; (6)\nand the sum rule\nNp \u2211\nl=1\nXl = INorb . (7)\nThe function G(z) is defined on {0} \u22c3\nC\\R, which excludes the real axis. The Matsubara Green\u2019s function GM(\u03c9) and the retarded Green\u2019s function GR(\u03c9) share the same formula G(z) (Eq. (1) and Eq. (4)) in the following way:\n\u2022 When z = i\u03c9n \u2208 iR is on the imaginary axis, GM(\u03c9n) = G(i\u03c9n) is the Matsubara (or imaginary frequency) Green\u2019s function, \u03c9n is called the Matsubara frequency. For fermionic systems, i\u03c9n \u2208 i 2Z+1\u03b2 ; for bosonic systems, i\u03c9n \u2208 i 2Z \u03b2 .\n\u2022 Since G(z) has poles on the real axis, the real-time (or real-frequency) Green\u2019s function could only be evaluated at positions infinitesimally close to the real axis. Let \u03b7 be a positive infinitesimal number. When z = \u03c9+i\u03b7, GR(\u03c9) = G(\u03c9+i\u03b7) is the retarded Green\u2019s function.\nThe spectral function A(\u03c9) is defined from GR(\u03c9) as follows:\nA(\u03c9) = \u2212 1\n\u03c0 Im ( Tr ( G R(\u03c9) ))\n(8)\nThe spectral function contains information of the excitation spectra in quantum systems. In practice, the retarded Green\u2019s function and the spectral function are evaluated with \u03b7 a very small positive number. Green\u2019s functions of fermionic systems are closely related to the matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions (see e.g., [22]). A matrix-valued function N(z) is said to be Herglotz-Nevanlinna if N : C+ \u2192 C\nNorb\u00d7Norb is analytic and Im(N(z)) is a positive semidefinite matrix for z \u2208 C+. Here C+ is the open complex upper half-plane, CNorb\u00d7Norb is the set of Norb\u00d7Norb matrices with entries in C, and Im(N(z)) is the imaginary part of N(z). The matrix-valued Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions admit the following integral representation, (see e.g., [37, Theorem 5.4] for proof):\nN(z) = Mz +B +\n\u222b\nR\n(\n1\nt\u2212 z \u2212\nt\n1 + t2\n)\nd\u03a3(t), z \u2208 C+,\n(9) where M,B \u2208 CNorb\u00d7Norb , M is positive semidefinite, B is Hermitian, and \u03a3(t) is a nondecreasing matrix-valued function on R such that \u222b\nR u\u2020(d\u03a3(t))u 1+t2 < \u221e for any vector\nu \u2208 CNorb . This condition on \u03a3(t) ensures that the above integration in Eq. (9) is well-defined. For the detailed mathematical theory of Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions, we refer the readers to [38, Chapter 2] and [39, Chapter 3]. From Eq. (9), we may set\nd\u03a3(t) =\nNp \u2211\nl=1\nXl\u03b4(t\u2212\u03bbl), M = 0, B =\n\u222b\nR\nt\n1 + t2 d\u03a3(t),\n(10) then\nN(z) =\n\u222b\nR\nd\u03a3(t) t\u2212 z =\nNp \u2211\nl=1\nXl\n\u03bbl \u2212 z = \u2212G(z), z \u2208 C+.\n(11) In other words, \u2212G(z) is a matrix-valued HerglotzNevanlinna function. This is the mathematical foundation of Nevanlinna [23] and Carathe\u0301odory continuation [24] methods.\n4 The causal space for Green\u2019s functions of fermionic systems is a subset of the Herglotz-Nevanlinna function class denoted by SF:\nSF =\n\n  \n  \nG\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 G(z) = \u2211Np l=1 Xl z\u2212\u03bbl , for some Np \u2208 Z, for some \u03bbl \u2208 R, and for Xl satisfying fermionic rank-1 semidefinite conditions\nEq. (6) and the sum rule Eq.

(5) and the sum rule Eq. (7).\n\n \n  \n.\n(13) In the definition of S\u00b1, the rank-1 condition in Xl can be dropped, because any semi-definite matrix can be represented as the sum of several rank-1 semi-definite matrices. Degenerate excitations can be treated similarly by allowing the values of some \u03bbl\u2019s to be the same. This is the mathematical foundation of the semidefinite relaxation fitting [35]. Now we are ready to introduce the setup for analytic continuation problems of Matsubara data. Given several (possibly noisy) Matsubara data Gn \u2248 G(i\u03c9n) for n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Nw, our goal is to obtain the fitting of these data into the following analytic form G(z) = \u2211Np\nl=1 Xl z\u2212\u03bbl ,\nwhere \u03bbl \u2208 R and Xl is a Norb \u00d7 Norb rank-1 semidefinite matrix, and the matrices {Xl} Np l=1 satisfies the sum rule \u2211\nl Xl = INorb . For fermionic systems, Xl is positive semidefinite, while for bosonic cases, sign(\u03bbl) \u00b7 Xl is positive semidefinite. In summary, we would like to obtain the poles \u03bbl, the semidefinite matrices Xl, and the number of poles Np which we may not have a priori knowledge. From such information we can infer the spectral function, as well as other diagonal and off-diagonal entries of the Green\u2019s function. Finally, we would like to remark that the Green\u2019s functions are only one type of response functions. Other response functions commonly considered, such as the charge, magnetic, or superconducting susceptibilities (see e.g., [36, Chapter 5.5]) admit the same formula Eq. (4), in which Xl also satisfies the bosonic/fermionic semidefinite conditions (see Eqs. (5) and (6)). The only difference is that Xl may satisfy a different set of sum rules. In other words, the analytic structure of Green\u2019s function and other response functions are similar, therefore the same methodology of analytic continuation applies.\nII.2. Step 1: Projection of the noisy data to the\ncausal space\nThe Matsubara data often contains unphysical noise, i.e., GM(i\u03c9n) cannot be expressed as a matrix-value func-\ntion in the set SF/B. Therefore the first step of our algorithm is to project the noisy data into the causal space. This can be achieved efficiently using semidefinite programming. For simplicity, let us choose a fine uniform grid on the real-axis\nxm = \u2212\u039bx +mhx, hx = 2C\nM , m = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M, (14)\nwhere \u039bx is the real-axis cutoff, and hx is the grid size. Our goal is to fit the Matsubara data Gn via the following form:\nGn \u2248\nM \u2211\nm=0\nPm\ni\u03c9n \u2212 xm , n = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Nw, (15)\nwhere {Pm} are semidefinite matrices. The objective function Eproj ( {Pm} M m=0 ) is defined as\nEproj ( {Pm} M m=0 ) =\n\n\nNw \u2211\nn=1\n\u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 Gn \u2212 M \u2211\nm=0\nPm\ni\u03c9n \u2212 xm\n\u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225\n2\nF\n\n\n1/2\n.\n(16) Here \u2016\u00b7\u2016F is the Frobenius norm. The solutions of the projection Pprojm is obtained by solving the following optimization problem:\n{Pprojm } = argmin{Pm} Eproj ( {Pm} M m=1 )\nsubject to\n\n   \n   \ni) semidefinite constraint: {\nPm 0 (Fermions), sign(xm) \u00b7 Pm 0 (Bosons case);\nii) sum rules: \u2211\nm Pm = INorb . (17)\nThis is a convex optimization problem, and can be solved efficiently using software packages such as CVX [40]. If we are performing analytic continuation of other correlation functions, {Pm} M m=1 may be subject to a different sum rule. For scalar-valued fermionic Green\u2019s function, the positive semidefinite condition Pm 0 becomes the nonnegativity condition Pm \u2265 0. Therefore the sum rule \u2211\nm Pm = 1 can also be written as \u2211\nm |Pm| = 1, i.e., an \u21131-norm constraint on the vector (P1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Pm). The least squares problem with a \u21131-norm constraint is similar to the well-known Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) problem [41], which favors solutions with a sparse structure (see also [42]). This agrees with our numerical observation that the solution Pm often has relatively few nonzero entries. For matrix-valued Green\u2019s function, there is a similar mechanism that induces the sparsity of solution. The natural generalization of the \u21131 norm is the nuclear norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u2217, defined as \u2016A\u2016\u2217 = \u221a Tr(A\u2020A) = \u2211\nk \u03c3k(A), where \u03c3k(A) is the k-th largest singular value for A. Note that each Pm is a positive semidefinite matrix, therefore the k-th largest singular value \u03c3k(Pm) is equal to the k-th largest eigenvalue \u03bbk(Pm). Therefore, we have \u2211\nm \u2016Pm\u2016\u2217 = \u2211 m \u2211 k \u03c3k(Pm) = \u2211 m \u2211 k \u03bbk(Pm) =\n5 \u2211\nm Tr(Pm) = Tr( \u2211\nm Pm). Combined with the sum rule \u2211\nm Pm = INorb , we can see that the matrices {Pm}\u2019s are enforced to satisfy the nuclear norm constraint \u2211\nm \u2016Pm\u2016\u2217 = Norb. The nuclear norm is also a sparsity-inducing property (see e.g., [43]). After obtaining Pprojm , we can construct the projected Matsubara data Gprojn :\nG proj n =\nM \u2211\nm=0\nPprojm\ni\u03c9n \u2212 xm , n = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Nw, (18)\nThis projection step can be used to improve the robustness of other analytic continuation methods, and therefore is of independent interest. For instance, the Nevanlinna analytic continuation method requires the Pick matrix to be positive semidefinite (see [23] for details). Numerical results indicate that this criterion can be violated when very small perturbations are applied to the Matsubara data. Given that noise is inevitable in many Green\u2019s function solvers (notably, quantum Monte Carlo solvers), the application range of the Nevanlinna analytic continuation is thus significantly limited by the nature of the noise. Our numerical results suggest that when the Nevanlinna method is applied to the projected noisy Matsubara data (for diagonal entries), the quality of the analytic continuation is significantly improved. (See Section III.1 and Section III.3 for details.) Similar improvements are observed on both diagonal and offdiagonal entries of the Green\u2019s functions while applying Carathe\u0301odory continuations on the projected data (also see Section III.1 for details).\nII.3. Step 2: Estimation of pole locations using the\nAAA algorithm\nWhile the projection step can be viewed as an analytic continuation algorithm by itself, the quality of the continuation is constrained by the resolution of the grid on the real axis. In practice, the number of grid points (i.e., M) in the uniform grid is often too small to accurately resolve the pole locations, but is too large to be directly used in the subsequent semidefinite relaxation (SDR) step to be detailed in Section II.4. Furthermore, the loss function in the SDR step is highly non-convex, and the optimization with respect to this loss function requires a proper initial guess. These considerations lead to the second step of the algorithm for estimating the locations of a relatively small number of poles. We use the adaptive Antoulas\u2013Anderson (AAA) algorithm [34] for the pole estimation, which is available as a subroutine in the Chebfun package [44]. The AAA algorithm is able to obtain the poles of a scalar complexvalued function g(z). In the context of analytic continuation, the scalar function g(z) could either be each diagonal entry Gii(z)(i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Norb) of the Green\u2019s function, or the trace Tr (G(z)). In practice, we find that performing the pole estimation on each diagonal entry separately often gives better results.\nThe AAA algorithm performs a rational approximation to a scalar function g(z) using barycentric representations [45]:\ng(z) \u2248 n(z)\nd(z) =\n\u2211n j=1 wjgj z\u2212zj \u2211n j=1 wj z\u2212zj . (19)\nHere n(z) = \u2211n\nj=1 wjgj z \u2212 zj and d(z) = \u2211n j=1 wj z \u2212 zj are\nthe numerator and denominator part of the barycentric representation, respectively. Note that the above formulation Eq. (19) automatically satisfies that n(zj) d(zj) = gj.\nWe briefly describe the AAA algorithm below, and refer readers to Ref. [34] for more details. Assume that we are given the values of g(z) on a set Z \u2282 C ofN points (in analytic continuation, Z = {i\u03c9n, n = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Nw}), the AAA algorithm aims at finding a set of support points {zj} n i=1, which allows us to solve for the weights {wj} n j=1 in Eq. (19). Here gj = g(zj) (j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n). Starting from n = 1, the AAA algorithm gradually expands the set {zj} n i=1 following a greedy algorithm.\nAt the (n \u2212 1)-th step (n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), if the residual res(z) = g(z) \u2212 n(z)d(z) is sufficiently small for all z \u2208 Z, then the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, we pick the next support point zn, by choosing z \u2208 Z\\ {z1, . . . , zn\u22121} where the residual res(z) takes its maximum absolute value. Let us write Z\\ {z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zn} as a column vector Z(n) := (\nZ (n) 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Z (n) N\u2212n\n)T\nand define g(n) = (\ng (n) 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , g (n) N\u2212n\n)T\n:= ( g (\nZ (n) 1\n) , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , g (\nZ (n) N\u2212n\n))T\n.\nSince g(z) is supposed to be approximated by g(z) \u2248 n(z)/d(z), i.e. g(z)d(z) \u2248 n(z), we choose the normalized weight w = (w1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , wn) by solving the least square problem:\nmin \u2016w\u20162=1\nN\u2212n \u2211\ni=1\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223g (n) i d ( Z (n) i ) \u2212 n ( Z (n) i )\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2\n= N\u2212n \u2211\ni=1\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 n \u2211\nj=1\nwj\n(\ng (n) i \u2212 gj\n)\nZ (n) i \u2212 zj\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\n2\n.\n(20)\nThe minimization problem of Eq. (20) could be viewed as the following linear algebra problem:\nmin \u2016w\u20162=1\n\u2225 \u2225 \u2225A(n)w \u2225 \u2225 \u2225\n2 , (21)\nwhere A(n) is\nA(n) =\n\n    \ng (n) 1 \u2212g1 Z (n) 1 \u2212z1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g (n) 1 \u2212gn Z (n) 1 \u2212zn\n... . . . ... g (n) N\u2212n \u2212g1 Z (n) N\u2212n\u2212z1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g (n) N\u2212n \u2212gn Z (n) N\u2212n\u2212zn\n\n     . (22)\nThis optimization problem Eq. (21) could be solved by performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) on the\n6 matrix A(n) = U\u03a3V \u2020, where U is a (N \u2212 n) \u00d7 r orthogonal matrix, V is a n \u00d7 r orthogonal matrix, \u03a3 = diag(\u03c31, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c3r) is a diagonal matrix (\u03c31 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 \u03c3r), and r \u2264 min(N \u2212 n, n) is the rank of A(n). The solution w of Eq. (21) should be taken as the last column of V . After the iteration terminates at the K-th step, we have {z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zK} and its associated weights {w1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , wK}. We can calculate the zeros of d(z), which serve as the estimated poles of g(z) that we want to obtain, using the following generalized eigenvalue problem [34]:\n\n     0 w1 w2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 wK 1 z1 1 z2 ... . . .\n1 zK\n\n     = \u03be\n\n    \n0 1\n1 . . .\n1\n\n     . (23)\nAt least two of the eigenvalues in this problem are infinite, and the remaining (K \u2212 1) eigenvalues {\u03bea} K\u22121 a=1 are the zeros of d, i.e. the complex-valued poles of g. Since all poles of the Green\u2019s function in Eq. (4) are real-valued, after obtaining {\u03bea} K\u22121 a=1 , we discard the poles far away from the real axis. In other words, we only keep poles with |Im \u03bea| \u2264 \u03b5p for some \u03b5p > 0, and define {\u03bbinl } Np l=1 to be real parts of the remaining poles. These Np poles will be used as the initial guess of the poles in the semidefinite relaxation step below."

(4) {Xl} are required to be rank-1 semidefinite matrix. The semidefinite relaxation drops this rank-1 constraint. In other words, {Xl} (or sign(\u03bbl) \u00b7 Xl) are only required to be positive semidefinite matrices for the analytic continuation of fermionic (bosonic) Green\u2019s function. For simplicity, the following discussion focuses on fermionic Green\u2019s functions, while the same numerical\ntreatment is applicable to bosonic Green\u2019s functions. The minimization of Err (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1, {Xl 0} Np l=1\n)\ncan be for-\nmulated as a bi-level optimization problem:\nmin \u03bbl,Xl 0\nErr (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1, {Xl} Np l=1\n)\n=min \u03bbl\u2208R min Xl 0\nErr (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1, {Xl} Np l=1\n)\n=min \u03bbl\u2208R\nE (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1\n)\n, (25)\nwhere\nE (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1\n)\n= min Xl 0\nErr (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1, {Xl 0} Np l=1\n)\n. (26)\nWhen the poles {\u03bbl} Np l=1 are fixed, the optimization with respect to semidefinite matrices {Xl 0} is a convex optimization problem, and could be efficiently solved using software packages such as CVX [40]. The optimization of Err (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1, {Xl 0} Np l=1\n)\nis transformed into the opti-\nmization of E (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1\n)\n, but note that such an optimiza-\ntion over the pole positions is still a nonconvex problem. Therefore, we have the following SDR fitting procedure through the bi-level optimization framework: starting from an initial value for poles {\u03bbinl } Np l=1 obtained by the previous pole estimation step, we use numerical optimization technique to minimize E (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1\n)\n, where\n\u2022 The value of E (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1\n)\nand the corresponding op-\ntimal {Xoptl 0} for fixed poles {\u03bbl} Np l=1 are found by a convex optimization solver.\n\u2022 Since E (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1\n) = Err (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1, {X opt l } Np l=1\n)\nand\nthe optimal matrices {Xoptl } should be regarded as functions of the poles {\u03bbl}, the partial derivative of E (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1\n)\ncould be written as\n\u2202mE = \u2202\n\u2202\u03bbm Err\n+\nNp \u2211\nl=1\nNorb \u2211\ni,j=1\n\u2202 Err\n\u2202 (Xl)ij\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nX opt l\n\u00b7 \u2202 ( X opt l ) ij\n\u2202\u03bbm\n, (27)\nThe first order optimality condition for solving\nEq.

The optimization of E (\n{\u03bbl} Np l=1\n)\ncould be conducted with standard gradient-based optimization solvers, such as the Broyden-Fletcher-GoldfarbShanno (BFGS) method (see e.g. [47]). Note that the SDR fitting step enforces that the Green\u2019s functions must be in the causal space, and is thus robust to unphysical noises. Since the projection step may introduce biases especially when the uniform mesh in Eq. (14) is relatively coarse, we find that the performance of SDR fitting is often better when applied to the original noisy data, instead of the data obtained after the projection."

The cost for solving the convex optimization problems can depend on the SDP reformulation, and the choice of algorithms. The default solver in the CVX software package is SDTP3 [48], which implements the interior point method with a primal-dual path-following strategy [49] to solve SDP problems. In the primal-dual interior point method, the cost is dominated by solving the Newton equation to obtain the primal-dual search direction. The unknown variables are Nv positive semidefinite matrices each of size Nd \u00d7 Nd, and the total number of variables is NvN 2 d . Therefore the cost of solving Newton\u2019s equation can be as large as O(N3vN 6 d ), and there is an additional cost in forming the matrices in Newton\u2019s equation (see e.g.,\n[50]). While the cost of solving Newton\u2019s equation may be reduced using preconditioned and iterative solvers in certain cases [51], in general, the solution the SDP problem can become expensive when both Nv and Nd are large. In the projection step, Nv = M is usually large. Note that the pole estimation step only uses the diagonal entries of the Green\u2019s function, and it is sufficient to only conduct projection of these diagonal entries. If M is very large, we may further reduce the cost by performing projection for each diagonal entry of the Green\u2019s functions separately. The semidefinite relaxation fitting requires the solution of Nv = Np matrices each of size Nd = Norb. Therefore it is important for the pole estimation step to obtain a relatively small number of poles. Furthermore, if the non-diagonal information of the Green\u2019s function is not needed (for example if the goal is to calculate the spectral function), the cost can be significantly reduced by conducting the semidefinite relaxation step for the diagonal entries only. Compared to solving the SDP problems, the cost of the AAA algorithm for the pole estimation is usually negligible.\nNoiseless data: If the data is noiseless or if the Green\u2019s functions are causal by construction (e.g., Green\u2019s functions are approximated via causal diagrammatic methods), we can skip the projection step, and conduct estimation and SDR fitting directly. Furthermore, since the projection is only performed on a finite grid along the real axis, the pre-processing step may become detrimental to the accuracy when the grid size is relatively small.\nParameters in AAA: Numerical results suggest that the final result is often insensitive to the choice of the parameter \u03b5p. For noisy data, the Lawson refinement step [52] (also implemented in Chebfun), which is based on an iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) iteration can also be used to improve the fitting result. Also, the AAA algorithm in Chebfun [44] could be implemented with or without specifying the number of poles. Prior knowledge on the on the number of peaks in the physical system can be used to control the maximal number of poles obtained by the AAA algorithm, and to enhance the robustness with respect to noise."

(32)\nThe parameters are chosen the same as in [24], namely t = 1, \u00b5 = 0.7, h = 0.3, Ua = 0.5, \u00b5a = 0.2, ha = 0.03, \u03b2 = 31.1 and U = 5.\nIII.1.2. Fitting results, with comparison to other methods\nLet us first demonstrate the efficiency of the PES method. We conduct analytic continuation for four sets of Matsubara data with different noise levels: \u03c3 = 0, \u03c3 = 4\u00d710\u22126, \u03c3 = 2.56\u00d710\u22124, \u03c3 = 1.6384\u00d710\u22122. In Fig. 1, we plot the spectral function (evaluated at R+ i\u03b7, \u03b7 = 0.01) obtained from analytic continuation with comparison to its true values. The methods that we are comparing with PES are Nevanlinna [23], Carathe\u0301odory [24] and MaxEnt [5]. We also implement the ES method, in which we skip the projection step and conduct the estimation and the SDR fitting directly. To make it a fair comparison, we also perform Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory continuations on the projected data. Since the amplitude of MaxEnt\nspectral functions are very small compared to the delta peaks in the true spectral functions, we rescale the MaxEnt results for comparison with true values and results from other methods. Our observation is summarized as follows:\n\u2022 When the Matsubara data is clean (noise-level \u03c3 = 0), all methods except the MaxEnt continuation could retrieve all the peaks perfectly. The MaxEnt method can not deal with sharp features. In all cases, MaxEnt can only result in two (and up to three) significantly broadened peaks.\n\u2022 Both the PES method and the ES method are robust to noise. It can retrieve almost all features of the Green\u2019s function when the noise level is small (\u03c3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 2.56 \u00d7 10\u22124), and can retrieve quite a few features when the noise level is relatively large ( \u03c3 = 1.6384\u00d7 10\u22122). Particularly, the band gap could be accurately resolved even in the large noise scenario.\n\u2022 For noisy data, PES behaves better than ES (see noise level \u03c3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 2.56 \u00d7 10\u22124), which implies that the projection of noisy data is indeed helpful. For noiseless data (\u03c3 = 0), ES behaves better than PES.\n\u2022 Even when the data is only slightly noisy (noiselevel \u03c3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22126), the Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory continuation breaks down. This is due to the violation of the Pick criterion [23]. The spectral function is no longer nonnegative and multiple features are missing.\n\u2022 If combined with the projection of data into the causal space, the results of the Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory continuation are greatly improved. However, the quality of Projection+Nevanlinna and Caratheodory is still not as good as PES. This could be seen in all noisy levels. What\u2019s more, the calculation results are still not guaranteed to be causal, as shown in the results of Projection+Carathe\u0301odory methods for relatively large noise (i.e. \u03c3 = 2.56\u00d710\u22124 and \u03c3 = 1.6384\u00d710\u22122).\nSince both PES method and Carathe\u0301odory continuation are able to obtain non-diagonal entries of the Green\u2019s functions, let us show the calculation result of the real part of G13 (also evaluated at R + i\u03b7, \u03b7 = 0.01) in Fig. 2, in which we compare the performances of PES, ES, Carathe\u0301odory and Projection+Carathe\u0301odory. Similar to what we have learned from the results of spectral functions, we have the following observations:\n\u2022 The Projection+Carathe\u0301odory does not perform as good as the PES and ES method. This could be seen at all noise levels. The two high peaks are perfectly retrieved by the PES and ES method but not by Projection+Carathe\u0301odory.\n\u2022 At noise-level \u03c3 = 1.6384 \u00d7 10\u22122, the noise is too large and no method could recover all peaks perfectly.\nWith these observations, we conclude that the PES\nmethod has the most robust performance, especially for analytic continuation of the matrix-valued noisy Matsubara data. The causal projection could help cure the noisesensitivity issue of Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory contin-\n10\nnoise level 0 4e-6 2.56e-4 1.6384e-2\nuation, but does not always guarantee a causal result, and not necessarily perform as well as the PES method.\nIII.1.3. Importance of the pole estimation\nNow we would like to demonstrate the importance of the pole estimation step. In [35], the SDR step is implemented in the context of hybridization fitting without the pole estimation. A random initialization of poles could fail to converge towards the global minimum of the loss function (see [35, Figure 2]). In the context of analytic continuation, we also find that a random selection of initial poles will not converge to its true positions. Particularly, the high frequency features, i.e. the poles away from zero may not be identified accurately. To illustrate the difficulty in the SDR step, we fix the poles to be its true values except for \u03bb1. The true value of \u03bb1 is \u22124.6361. We choose its initial value to be \u03bbin1 = \u22125.25,\u22125.00,\u22124.75,\u22124.50,\u22124.25,\u22124.00, and then conduct the SDR fitting step. The corresponding result of the spectral function at the interval [\u22125,\u22124] is shown in Fig. 3 (top panel). We see that even such a\nsmall deviation from the true value of \u03bb1 can result in large errors in analytic continuation.\nThe reason behind this is as follows. Let us keep other poles fixed at their true values and let \u03bb1 vary from \u22126 to \u22124, and plot the landscape of the loss function E({\u03bbl}) in Fig. 3 (bottom panel). We can see that the loss function is highly nonconvex. When \u03bbin1 is outside the interval [\u22125.25,\u22124.5], the loss function is essentially flat. In fact, if \u03bbin1 /\u2208 [\u22125.25,\u22124.5], the optimized semidefinite matrix X opt 1 is a zero matrix. This will result in a vanishing gradient for \u03bbin1 (see Eq. (28)), and therefore the optimization could not continue. In such an adversarial scenario, a random initialization of poles cannot recover the true pole locations.\nIII.2. Bosonic response functions\nIn order to demonstrate that the PES method is also applicable to bosonic response functions, let us consider the quantity b(\u03c4) = \u3008n\u03020\u2191(\u03c4)n\u03020\u2191(0)\u3009 of the Hubbard dimer model, which indicates the same-spin susceptibility for the 0-th site of the system. This function is also used in [2] to test the performance of analytic continuation methods for bosonic functions. We use the Hubbard dimer example with the same parameters as in Section III.1 other than taking U = 0.9. Let us use b(\u03c9) to denote the time-response function in the frequency domain. We are trying to fit the Matsubara data of b(\u03c4) into the following form:\nb(w) =\nNp \u2211\nl=1\nxl w \u2212 \u03bbl , (33)\nwhere the quantities xl satisfies the semidefinite constraints Eq. (5) and the constraint\n\u2211\nl\nxl = 1\nZ\n\u2211\nr,s\n|\u3008\u03a8s |n\u03020\u2191|\u03a8r\u3009| 2 ( e\u2212\u03b2Es \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2Er ) = 0.\n(34) Here Norb = 1 since we are only considering the time response function with respect to the 0-th site. In the current physical system, the spectral function of b(w) has four peaks, with two on the positive half axis, and two on the negative half axis. In fact, b(w) is an odd function. Since the susceptibility is mirrored for negative frequencies, we only choose to plot the positive half axis. Note that since the Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory continuation are not applicable to bosonic functions, we can only compare the PES method to the MaxEnt continuation method, for Matsubara data with different noise levels \u03c3 = 0, 10\u22126, 10\u22124 and 10\u22122. The result is shown in Fig. 4. The MaxEnt method could not resolve the peaks of the bosonic response function under any noise level. We can see that when the noise level is small (\u03c3 = 0, 10\u22126, 10\u22124), the PES method could recover both peaks on the positive half axis. When the noise level is large (\u03c3 = 10\u22122), the PES method could only recover one peak. This means\nthat the noise-robustness of PES method for bosonic functions are comparable to that for fermionic functions."

            "text": "We now applied the PES method to ab initio band structure calculations of solids. We use two data sets obtained from GW calculations: the matrix-valued Green\u2019s functions for crystalline Si in the equilibrium geometry, previously analyzed in Ref. [24], and for AgI obtained with a relativistic exact two-component formulation in the one-electron approximation (x2c1e) [53]. The data have been obtained by fully self-consistent GW formulated in Gaussian Bloch orbitals, as described in detail in Ref. [54]. Both AgI and Si employ the gth-dzvp-moloptsr basis [55] with gth-pbe pseudopotential [56], using integrals generated by the PySCF package [57] and a code based on ALPS [58]. Calculations are performed on a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 grid [59] and interpolated using a Wannier interpolation of Matsubara data [54] on 52 positive IR frequencies [60, 61] on a grid with 200 momentum points along a high-symmetry path. The broadening parameter of \u03b7 = 0.01Ha \u2248 3157K is larger than the temperature of T = 0.001Ha \u2248 316K and correlation effects. The analytic continuation is conducted as follows. Since the number of orbitals is much larger than that in the Hubbard dimer example (Norb \u2248 70 for silicon and Norb \u2248 230 for AgI), the computational cost will be too high if we conduct the analytic continuation for the entire matrix. Therefore we only implement the analytic continuation for the diagonal elements. The projection step is conducted on each diagonal entry separately with a fine grid of M = 12000 points. After the projection step, we estimate the poles of each diagonal entry using AAA algorithm, and then conduct the SDR fitting of each diagonal entry separately. We conduct analytic continuation for Matsubara data with different noise levels \u03c3 = 0, 10\u22126, 10\u22124 and 10\u22122. The results of the spectral functions along a high symmetry path reveal the band structure, and are plotted in Fig. 5. We place a white marker in the plot if the corresponding component of the spectral function becomes negative to indicate that the result is unphysical. Once again, we can see that Nevanlinna continua-\n12\ntions could result in negative spectral functions even for the clean data, while Nevanlinna continuations combined with the causal projection can largely resolve the isuse of noise-sensitivity. PES method, ES method and the\nNevanlinna continuation on projected data routine are all noise-robust. Even at a relatively large noise-level \u03c3 = 10\u22122, the structure of the valence and conduction bands can be recovered. This means that our noise-\n13\nrobust analytic continuation methods could successfully retrieve information such as the band gap from Matsubara data even under a significant noise level."

            "heading": "IV. DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In this article, we have proposed a robust analytic continuation method called PES, consisting of the following three steps: causal projection, pole estimation and SDR fitting through bi-level optimization. The PES method is noise-robust, could deal with matrix-valued Green\u2019s functions and is applicable to both fermionic and bosonic systems. As a by product, we also find that the causal projection could significantly improve the performance of noise-sensitive methods such as Nevanlinna and Carathe\u0301odory continuation. We have also demonstrated these properties with extensive numerical experiments.\nOur current strategy of pole estimation is to perform AAA algorithm on the projected data. Note that the AAA algorithm is still an interpolation procedure can be susceptible to noise. The causal projection alleviates this drawback, and in practice it often provides a good enough initial guess for SDR fitting even in the noisy scenario. A better strategy to estimate the pole locations (e.g., by combining with the Prony method [33]) may still be helpful in improving the overall performance of the PES method. Moreover, the current SDP solver (SDPT3) can be computationally expensive when the number of variables is large. In such a case, more efficient solvers based on first-order methods may reduce the computa-\ntional time in both the projection and the SDR fitting steps. As we have shown, the PES method is useful for retrieving the excitation spectra of molecules and band structures in solids. These data feature multiple sharp peaks modeled by poles on the real axis. It could also be used to perform bath fitting in the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) [35], and it is applicable in lattice gauge theory (for example, see [62, 63]). Broadened spectral functions that cannot be resolved into discrete peaks may be modeled by a relatively small number of poles away from the real axis. This would require modification of the definition of the causal space. Note that in the noisy scenario, it may be very difficult to distinguish the spectra described by a pole in the complex plane and the spectra due to many poles on or near the real axis. Therefore prior information such as the maximum number of complex poles and approximate pole locations may become necessary. This scenario will be investigated in future work.\nAcknowledgment\nThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program under Award Number DE-SC0022198 (Z.H.) and DESC0022088 (E.G.).
