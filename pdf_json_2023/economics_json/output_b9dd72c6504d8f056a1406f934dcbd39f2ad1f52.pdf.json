    "abstractText": "At the peak of the tech bubble, only 0.57% of market valuation comes from dividends in the next year. Taking the ratio of total market value to the value of one-year dividends, we obtain a valuation-based duration of 175 years. In contrast, at the height of the global financial crisis, more than 2.2% of market value is from dividends in the next year, implying a duration of 46 years. What drives valuation duration? We find that market participants have limited information about cash flow beyond one year. Therefore, an increase in valuation duration is due to a decrease in the discount rate rather than good news about long-term growth. Accordingly, valuation duration negatively predicts annual market return with out-of-sample R2 of 15%, robustly outperforming other predictors in the literature. While the price-dividend ratio reflects the overall valuation level, our valuation-based measure of duration captures the slope of the valuation term structure. We show that valuation duration, as a discount rate proxy, is a critical state variable that augments the price-dividend ratio in spanning the (latent) state space for stock-market dynamics. \u2217We thank Nick Barberis, Geert Bekaert, Jules van Binsbergen, Zhi Da, Kent Daniel, Joost Driessen, Stefano Giglio, Will Goetzmann, BenjaminGolez, Hui Guo, Bryan Kelly, Ralph Koijen, Lars Lochstoer, AlanMoreira, Riccardo Sabbatucci, Tano Santos, Jos\u00e9 Scheinkman, Jessica Wachter, and Michael Weber for in-depth discussions. \u2020University of Washington Foster School of Business.

We find that market participants have limited information about cash flow beyond one year.

            "text": "We define valuation duration of the stock market as the ratio of total market capitalization to\nthe price of the dividend in the very next year (the one-year dividend strip price in Binsbergen,\nBrandt, and Koijen, 2012). In March 2000, the U.S. stock market has a valuation duration of 175\nyears, which suggests that at the peak of the dot-com bubble, the U.S. stock market derives 99.4%\nof value from dividends beyond the next year. Duration varies significantly over time, with a\nmonthly standard deviation of 1.6 years in the last three decades. At the market bottom during\nthe global financial crisis, the stock market duration is only 46 years in March 2009 with more\nthan 2.2% of market value coming from dividends paid within the next year.\nWhat drives the relative valuation of long- vs. short-term dividends? An increase in market\nduration represents a steepening of the valuation term structure, with the long-term dividends\ncommanding a higher valuation relative to dividends in the near term. While duration represents\nthe slope, the standard price-dividend ratio captures the overall level of market valuation. What\ninformation can we extract from the dynamics of slope and level of the valuation term structure?\nWe find that market duration and the price-dividend ratio span the state space of equity\nmarket. Stock prices are determined by the conditional expectations of future returns and divi-\ndends, so amodel of the aggregate stockmarket requires at least two state variables for return and\ncash-flow dynamics (e.g., Lettau andWachter, 2007; Binsbergen and Koijen, 2010; Kragt, de Jong,\nand Driessen, 2020). In other words, the lower bound of the state-space dimension is two. Our\nanalysis shows that two is also the upper bound. Market duration and the price-dividend ratio\nas the two state variables contain sufficient information for forecasting returns and future divi-\ndends. Moreover, market duration is the state variable that corresponds closely to the conditional\nexpected return. We show that this strong connection between market duration and the discount\nrate is due to the striking difference in cash-flow predictability at short and long horizons.\nIdentifying state variables is an important task in asset pricing and macro finance as it lays\nthe foundation for various research topics.1 Our findings show that beyond the standard price1Previous studies on macro dynamics and asset pricing based on consumption, production, behavioral biases,\n1\ndividend ratio, valuation duration is another key state variable for the equity market, and it is\nparticularly powerful in revealing the discount-rate dynamics. Next, we summarize the key steps\nof our analysis and our contributions to the asset pricing literature in three areas, state-space\nmodeling, return predictability, and cash-flow expectations.\nOur analysis starts with a characterization of the equity-market state space. We explore in-\nformation directly from the prices of dividend strips rather than select macro or market variables.\nThe logarithm of dividend strip prices at different maturities scaled by the realized dividend are\nlinear functions of (latent) state variables in an exponential-affine setup (e.g., Lettau andWachter,\n2007) or through log-linearization (e.g., Campbell and Shiller, 1988; Binsbergen and Koijen, 2010).\nTherefore, this set of valuation ratios of dividend strips fully reveals the state variables as long as\nthe number of dividend strips is at least as large as the number of state variables and the valuation\nratios have linearly independent state-variable coefficients.\nWe find that two principal components drive the dynamics of valuation ratios of dividends\nat different maturities. Importantly, when forecasting market return and dividend growth, two\nvaluation ratios are sufficient to maximize the predictive power. While different pairs of valuation\nratios possess different predictive power, the pairs with the strongest predictive power perform\njust as well as combinations of three or more valuation ratios. Our findings suggest that the state\nspace is two-dimensional. Next, we show that the log market duration (\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f), i.e., the logarithm\nof total market value scaled by one-year dividend price, and the log price-dividend ratio (\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51)\npossess a predictive power for both return and dividend growth that is at least as strong as any\ncombination of dividend valuation ratios and thus can serve as the pair of state variables.\nA striking finding from our forecasting exercises is that \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f alone is sufficient for forecasting\nreturns. Augmenting \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f with \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 or other valuation ratios of dividend strips does not improve\nthe predictive power. In fact, the return predictive power of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f not only subsumes that of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\nand intermediation frictions have motivated a variety of state variables (e.g., Sims, 1980; Cochrane, 1991; Campbell and Ammer, 1993; Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998; Campbell and Cochrane, 1999; Barberis, Huang, and Santos, 2001; Lettau and Ludvigson, 2001; Ang and Piazzesi, 2003; Bansal and Yaron, 2004; Campbell and Vuolteenaho, 2004; Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer, 2010; Lettau and Wachter, 2011; Gabaix, 2012; He and Krishnamurthy, 2013; Wachter, 2013; Kelly and Pruitt, 2013; Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2014; Barberis, Greenwood, Jin, and Shleifer, 2015; Muir, 2017; Campbell, Giglio, Polk, and Turley, 2018; Campbell, Pflueger, and Viceira, 2020; Cieslak and Pang, 2021).\n2\nand other valuation ratios but also surpasses other predictors in the literature, such as those\nsummarized in Goyal and Welch (2007) and more recent studies. Specifically, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f demonstrates\nremarkable in-sample and out-of-sample (OOS) return predictability of annual market returns,\nreporting substantial \ud835\udc452 of 25% and 15%, respectively. The OOS \ud835\udc452 is in sharp contrast to the\nalmost zero OOS \ud835\udc452 from \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51. Moreover, the predictive power of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f survives the Hodrick (1992)\nadjustment for standard errors, the Stambaugh (1999) adjustment for small-sample bias, and tests\nfor out-of-sample predictive power such as encompassing (ENC) and Clark-West (CW) tests.\nThese findings are critical for understanding both the discount-rate dynamics and the fluc-\ntuation of market duration. If the conditional expected return is a univariate function of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , then\nwe can rearrange the equation and solve \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f as a univariate function of the conditional expected\nreturn, which implies that the variation in duration is fully discount-rate driven. To analyze the\nconnection between \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and the discount rate, we set up a two-dimensional state space model.\nWithout loss of generality, the (latent) state variables are the conditional expected return and ex-\npected dividend growth rate that follow AR(1) processes (Lettau and Wachter, 2007; Binsbergen\nand Koijen, 2010). \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 are bivariate linear functions of state variables, and vice versa.\nIn our model, a necessary and sufficient condition for the conditional expected return to\nbe a univariate function of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f (and vice versa) is that the market does not contain information\non cash-flow growth beyond the very next year. Intuitively, under this condition, the price of\nnext year\u2019s dividends exhausts all the information about future cash flows, so \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , which is the\nlog market value minus the log price of next year\u2019s dividend, teases out cash-flow information\nand only contains information about the discount rate, thus becoming a univariate function of\nthe conditional expected return. Given that the expected dividend growth rate follows an AR(1)\nprocess, this condition translates into a zero autoregressive coefficient of the expected dividend\ngrowth rate: All the relevant information about future cash flows\u2014the current expected growth rate and the history of realized shocks\u2014is not propagated into the future beyond the next year.2\n2Given a two-dimensional state space, adding more lags to the autoregressive processes of expected return and expected dividend growth is not necessary. If AP(p) or ARMA(p,q) models were required or if other (macroeconomic or market) variables feed into the dynamics of expected return and expected cash-flow growth rate, we should have found the state-space dimension to be higher than two because to span the state space, we must augment the current\n3\nTo estimate the autoregressive coefficient (persistence) of the expected dividend growth\nrate, we use analyst forecasts to proxy for the expected cash-flow growth and estimate two econo-\nmetric models of belief dynamics that take advantage of, respectively, analysts\u2019 short-term and\nlong-term forecasts. As an alternative method, we also fit a state-space model to dividend data to\nestimate the persistence of expected dividend growth. The message from our findings is consis-\ntent: Cash-flow growth expectation lacks persistence. This provides an explanation of the strong\nconnection between market duration and expected return.\nWe also show analytically that return prediction errors should comove with the value of\nthe autoregressive coefficient of cash-flow growth expectations. To test this prediction, we con-\nduct a rolling-window estimation. In each window, we estimate the autoregressive coefficient of\nthe expected cash-flow growth and the forecast error from predicting returns with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f . Both the\nin-sample and out-of-sample forecasting errors comove with the value of the autoregressive co-\nefficient, suggesting that when the market contains limited information about cash-flow growth\nbeyond one year, the mapping between \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and the expected return strengthens.\nIn our model, a zero autoregressive coefficient of the expected cash-flow growth rate fully\ncaptures the fact that the market contains limited information about cash-flow growth beyond\nthe very next year. The emphasis on this autoregressive coefficient is warranted because the\nexpected dividend growth rate follows an AR(1) process. While our analysis of the state-space\ndimension supports this model specification, we still go beyond our model to characterize market\nparticipants\u2019 cash-flow expectations. First, we show that dividend and earnings growth within one year are highly predictable, especially by analysts\u2019 forecasts.3 The \ud835\udc452 is 73% from forecasting\nthe near year\u2019s earnings growth. In contrast, cash-flow predictability beyond one year is weak.\nFor growth from the next one to two years, the in-sample \ud835\udc452 of our best prediction model is only\n8%. It declines to 7% for growth between the second and third years.\nOur findings on the striking difference between short- and long-term cash-flow predictabil-\nity lend support to \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f as a discount-rate proxy. Cochrane (2011) points out that the price-dividend\nconditional expectations of next-period return and cash flow growth rate with lagged conditional expectations. 3This can be explained by firms offering forward guidance on near-term performance.\n4\nratio, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, may predict future returns if cash flows are not predictable. We show that short-term\ncash flows are in fact highly predictable but long-term cash flows are not. This finding then\nsuggests that the discount-rate proxy should be market duration, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , which captures the relative\nvaluation of long- vs. short-term cash flows and reflects the slope of the valuation term structure,\nrather than \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, which reflects the overall level of valuation. Consider a market timing strategy\nbased on the return predictive power of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f . Because \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f has a negative predictive coefficient, the\nstrategy reduces market exposure when duration increases and increases market exposure when\nduration decreases. The strategy delivers a Sharpe ratio of 0.58, achieving an improvement of 55%\nover the buy-and-hold strategy (Campbell and Thompson, 2008). It bets against the valuation of\nlong-term cash flows rather than the overall level of valuation that is reflected in \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51.\nBeyond time-varying discount rate, return predictability typically entertains an alternative\ninterpretation based on mispricing. The profitability of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f-based market timing strategy can be\nexplained by market participants\u2019 lack of information on long-term growth and the associated\nover- or under-valuation of cash flows at long horizons. Moreover, the market timing strategy\nalso avoids betting against the valuation of short-term cash flows that market participants are in-\nformed about. When the valuation of long-term cash flows rises, the resultant increase in market\nduration signals exuberance, while when the valuation of long-term cash flows declines, market\nparticipants may be overly pessimistic about long-term growth. This interpretation is consis-\ntent with the emphasis in Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer (forthcoming) on market\nparticipants\u2019 errors in forecasting long-term growth as a key driver of asset prices.\nLiterature. Asset prices are typically modeled as functions of state variables. One approach to\nselecting state variables is through economic theories (e.g., Campbell and Cochrane, 1999, Bansal\nand Yaron, 2004). Our paper contributes to the alternative approach of state space modeling\n(e.g., Duffee, 2002; Dai and Singleton, 2003). Using the valuation ratios of dividend strips, we\nempirically analyze the dimension of the state space and provide support to the widely adopted\nassumption of a two-dimensional state space (e.g., Lettau and Wachter, 2007; Binsbergen and\n5\nKoijen, 2010; Kragt, de Jong, and Driessen, 2020). Moreover, we show that our valuation-based\nmeasure of duration and the commonly used price-dividend ratio map out the state space of stock\nmarket. Our work builds upon the previous research on measuring the prices of dividend strips\n(Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen, 2012; Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen, and Vrugt, 2013; Binsber-\ngen and Koijen, 2017; Cejnek and Randl, 2016, 2020; Cejnek, Randl, and Zechner, 2021; Golez\nand Jackwerth, 2023; Giglio, Kelly, and Kozak, forthcoming). While this literature emphasizes\ncharacterizing the term structure of equity risk premium, our paper instead focuses on the term structure of equity valuation ratios and how to use valuation ratios to map out state variables.4\nOur approach of extracting state variables from disaggregated valuation ratios is similar\nin spirit to that in Kelly and Pruitt (2013) but differs in several crucial ways. Kelly and Pruitt\n(2013) decompose the stock market into individual stocks and filter out state variables from the\nvaluation ratios of individual stocks. We decompose the market by the horizon of aggregate cash flows.5 By avoiding idiosyncratic noise in firm-level valuation ratios, we do not rely on statistical\nfiltering to extract state variables. The valuation ratios of dividend strips, our measure of market\nduration, and the price-dividend ratio are already combinations of state variables. Since our two\nstate variables can be measured in real time and directly from market prices, they are less prone\nto estimation error and thus offer a real-time characterization of the state of equity market.\nAn application of state variables in the finance literature is to predict asset returns. We con-\ntribute to the voluminous literature on return predictability by offering a novel predictor based\non a relative valuation of short- and long-term cash flows (e.g., Fama and French, 1988; Campbell\nand Shiller, 1988; Lettau and Ludvigson, 2001; Baker and Wurgler, 2000; Lewellen, 2004; Goyal\nand Welch, 2007; Cochrane, 2007; Ang and Bekaert, 2007; Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh, 2007; 4There is an extensive literature on the term structure of equity risk premium (e.g., Lettau and Wachter, 2007, 2011; Hansen, Heaton, and Li, 2008; Croce, Lettau, and Ludvigson, 2014; Belo, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein, 2015; Ai, Croce, Diercks, and Li, 2018; Backus, Boyarchenko, and Chernov, 2018; Bansal, Miller, Song, and Yaron, 2021; Gon\u00e7alves, 2021a; Gormsen, 2021; Boguth, Carlson, Fisher, and Simutin, 2022).\n5There is a large literature on measuring the cash-flow duration for the aggregate market based on accounting information (Binsbergen, 2021; Golez and Koudijs, 2023) and for individual stocks based on accounting information (Dechow, Sloan, and Soliman, 2004; Da, 2009; Chen, 2011; Weber, 2018; Gon\u00e7alves, 2021b; Walter and Weber, 2022) or derivative prices (Gormsen and Lazarus, 2023). Our paper differs by constructing a valuation-based measure of duration rather than a measure of duration based on the term structure of corporate cash flows.\n6\nCampbell and Thompson, 2008; Kelly and Pruitt, 2013; Rapach, Ringgenberg, and Zhou, 2016;\nMartin, 2017; Johnson, 2019; Chen, Da, and Huang, 2022; Kelly, Malamud, and Zhou, forthcom-\ning; Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer, forthcoming). The construction of our predictor\nis simple, and it outperforms the other stock-market return predictors across various metrics.\nMoreover, we provide an intuitive explanation on the connection between valuation duration\nand the conditional expected return based on the term structure of cash-flow predictability.\nWe show that short-term cash flows are highly predictable but long-term cash flows are\nnot, and this is key to identifying a discount-rate proxy. Cochrane (2011) suggests that the price-\ndividend ratio, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, predicts future returns and serves as a discount-rate proxy if cash flows are\nnot predictable. But our findings on the striking difference in cash-flow predictability at short- vs.\nlong horizons suggest that the proper discount-rate proxy and the state variable driving the con-\nditional expected return should bemarket duration, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f . Our findings on cash flow predictability at\ndifferent horizons contribute to the literature on cash-flow predictability (Larrain and Yogo, 2008;\nBinsbergen and Koijen, 2010; Koijen and Van Nieuwerburgh, 2011; Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen,\nand Vrugt, 2013; Chen, Da, and Zhao, 2013; Jagannathan and Liu, 2018; Pettenuzzo, Sabbatucci,\nand Timmermann, 2020; Golez and Koudijs, 2023; Sabbatucci, 2022; Pruitt, 2023)\nCharacterizing the dynamics of expected cash-flow growth rate has always been an impor-\ntant topic in the asset pricing literature (Bansal and Yaron, 2004; Beeler and Campbell, 2012; Belo,\nCollin-Dufresne, and Goldstein, 2015; Collin-Dufresne, Johannes, and Lochstoer, 2016). Recently\na growing body of work focuses on analyzing market participants\u2019 expectation formation. Adam and Nagel (2022) summarize the latest developments.6 Our findings are most related to Bordalo,\nGennaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer (forthcoming), who document that market participants\u2019 errors\nin forecasting long-term growth are key to understanding asset-price fluctuations. Also related,\nDa and Warachka (2011) find that the disparity between long- and short-term earnings expecta6There is a fast-growing body of literature on firm-level cash flow expectations (La Porta, 1996; Dechow and Sloan, 1997; Copeland, Dolgoff, and Moel, 2004; Da and Warachka, 2011; Piotroski and So, 2012; Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer, 2019; Bouchaud, Kr\u00fcger, Landier, and Thesmar, 2019; Binsbergen, Han, and Lopez-Lira, 2022) and expectations of aggregate cash-flow growth (Chen, Da, and Zhao, 2013; De La O and Myers, 2021; Gao and Martin, 2021; McCarthy and Hillenbrand, 2021; Nagel and Xu, 2022; Charles, Frydman, and Kilic, 2023; Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta, OBrien, and Shleifer, 2023; Schmidt-Engelbertz and Vasudevan, 2023).\n7\ntions drives the cross-sectional difference in average stock returns. Our contribution is to show\nthat, first, there exists a striking difference in short- vs. long-term cash flow predictability, and\nsecond, such difference guides us towards finding a discount-rate proxy. Moreover, we show that\nthe term structure of cash-flow predictability is tied to the persistence of agents\u2019 cash-flow expec-\ntations. Our findings echo the recent studies on the importance of agents\u2019 perceived persistence\nof key state variables in explaining belief formation and asset prices (Gabaix, 2019; Wang, 2020)."

We can write (8) as follows\n\ud835\udc01 ({\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56}\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc56=1)\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 = [\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc5b1 \ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc34 (\ud835\udc5b1) , ..., \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3d \ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc34 (\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3d)] \u22a4 . (9)\nThe stock market acts as a linear mapping, i.e., \ud835\udc01 ({\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56}\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc56=1), that compresses the \ud835\udc3e -dimensional state space of \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 into a \ud835\udc3d -dimensional space generated by the log price-dividend ratios. In sum, a collection of log price-dividend ratios of dividend strips (partially) span the state space. For\ninformation embedded in the state variables, we analyze these valuation ratios.\nLet \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 denote the total stock market capitalization (i.e., the market price of dividends across\nall maturities). Following the same method, we solve the log price-dividend ratio of the market\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = ln (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc34 + \ud835\udc35\u22a4\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 , (10)\nwhere \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 are constants defined in Appendix I. Stock market duration is defined as the log\nratio of total market capitalization to the price of dividends paid in the next year.\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 \u2261 ln (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc43 1\ud835\udc61 ) = ln (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61) \u2212 ln (\ud835\udc43 1 \ud835\udc61 /\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc60 1 \ud835\udc61\n= \ud835\udc34 \u2212 \ud835\udc34(1) + (\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc35(1))\u22a4 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 . (11)\nTherefore, just like the valuation ratios of dividend strips, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 are also driven by\nthe state variables \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 . By having different coefficients of \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 , these two variables reveal different information about the state space. Next, we analyze the dimension of the state space using \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , and the valuation ratios of dividend strips with different maturities. After showing empirically\nthat the state space is two-dimensional, we argue that \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 , span the state space and contain sufficient information for forecasting stock market returns and cash-flow growth.\n10"

The second component is the risk-neutral expectation of stock price, i.e., the futures price, \ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 (Duffie, 2001).\nWe construct the price of dividend strips using zero-coupon bond prices and stock index\nfutures prices.

In our empirical analysis, we use the valuation ratios of dividend strips with maturity 1 and 0.5, i.e., \ud835\udc601 = ln(\ud835\udc43 1/\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc600.5 = ln(\ud835\udc43 0.5/\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61), and the\n11\nvaluation ratio of dividends paid beyond one year, \ud835\udc601+ = ln(\ud835\udc43 1+/\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61). Our analysis in the previous section shows that these valuation ratios are different linear combinations of state variables.\nData and summary statistics For futures prices, we use S&P 500 index futures, which are the most actively traded stock futures. We obtain S&P 500 futures prices fromDatastream.7 Weobtain\nthe zero-coupon bond prices from the Fama-Bliss database. The return and level of the S&P 500\nindex are obtained fromCRSP. The dividend data is from S&PGlobal and obtained via the updated\ndataset of Goyal and Welch (2007). Our final dataset is from January 1988 to December 2019. The\nsample starts in 1988 to have high-quality dividend data from S&P Global and, importantly, a sufficiently liquid futures market without structural changes.8 After the market crash of October 1987, regulators overhauled several trade-clearing protocols.9 Lastly, Fama-French factors at the\nmonthly frequency are obtained from Ken French\u2019s website.\nWe construct market duration, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 , as the logarithm of the ratio of S&P 500 market capital-\nization to the price of dividends paid in the next year. The traditional price-dividend ratio is the\nlogarithm of the ratio of S&P 500 market capitalization to the realized dividend in the last year.\nTable 1 reports the summary statistics of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 , the traditional price-dividend ratio \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , the valuation ratios (\ud835\udc600.5, \ud835\udc601, and \ud835\udc601+), the monthly return of S&P 500 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc46&\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61+1/12 where in the subscript 1/12 denotes one month or 1/12 of a year), the annual return of S&P 500 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc46&\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61+1 ), and for comparison, the monthly and annual returns of the Fama-French market portfolio (MKT) (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc61+1/12 and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc61+1 ). Our sample includes monthly observations until 2019, i.e., before the extrememarket fluctuations\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic. Our baseline analysis focuses on the returns and dividends of the 7We obtain the daily settlement prices for the S&P 500 futures. For return and cash-flow prediction at the monthly frequency, we use the settlement price of the last trading day of each month. The maturities of the traded futures contracts vary over time, so to obtain futures prices with constant maturity, we apply the shape-preserving piecewise cubic interpolation to complete the futures curve. The results using linear interpolation are similar.\n8Wang, Michalski, Jordan, and Moriarty (1994) identify structural changes of liquidity in the S&P 500 futures market in the pre-1987 period, during the market crash, and in the post-1987 period.\n9The stock market crash in October 1987 reveals anomalous trading in the futures market that was primarily driven by portfolio insurance (Brady Report (1988)). According to the New York Stock Exchange: \u201cIn response to the market breaks in October 1987 and October 1989, the New York Stock Exchange instituted circuit breakers to reduce volatility and promote investor confidence. By implementing a pause in trading, investors are given time to assimilate incoming information and the ability to make informed choices during periods of high market volatility.\u201d\n12\nS&P 500 index because we construct the strip prices using the S&P 500 futures data.10 For ro-\nbustness, we also report results using Fama-French market portfolio returns and dividends. Note\nthat we include \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39 and \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43 , the return predictors from Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) and Kelly\nand Pruitt (2013), respectively, because these variables are also constructed to extract informa-\ntion on state variables. To highlight our contribution, we will compare our analysis with that in\nBinsbergen and Koijen (2010) and Kelly and Pruitt (2013).\nThe mean of stock market duration \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 is 4.027, which translates into 56 = exp(4.027) years,\nmeaning that the total market value is 56 times the valuation of dividends in the next year. \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 has a wide range of variation, with a minimum of 2.952 (i.e., 19 years) in November 1988 right before 10Previous studies of return predictability (e.g., Ang and Bekaert, 2007) also use S&P 500 Index as a market proxy.\n13\nthe 1990-1991 recession and a maximum of 6.632 (i.e., 759 years) near the end of the dot-com\nboom (November 2000). \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 has a lower monthly autocorrelation (\u201c\ud835\udf0c\u201d) than \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 .\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 are correlated but contain distinct information. As shown in the cross-spectrum\nin Figure 1, the correlation of 0.87 is mainly from low-frequency movements. Panel A of Figure 1\nshows the spectrum of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , and \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 (the residual from linearly projecting \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 on \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61). The area under the spectrum curve is the variance, so the figure provides a variance decomposition in the\nfrequency domain. On the horizontal axis, instead of showing the frequencies from zero to \ud835\udf0b,\nwe mark the corresponding length of the cycle for easier interpretation. Once orthogonalized to\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 \u2019s residual varies mainly at annual or higher frequencies. Panel B plots the cross-spectrum of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 . The integral is the covariance between \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 . The correlation between \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 is mainly from low frequencies. This indicates that it is the high-frequency variation in \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 that brings information distinct from that revealed by the traditional price-dividend ratio. This is consistent with the findings in Kragt, de Jong, and Driessen (2020) about different state\nvariables fluctuating at different frequencies. Figure A.1 in the Appendix shows the spectrum\nanalysis based on daily data with similar results.\n14\nAs shown in Section 2, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 are essentially different combinations of state variables.\nOur state-space approach is closely related to Binsbergen and Koijen (2010). Binsbergen and\nKoijen (2010) use the realized returns and dividends to estimate a latent-state model and filter\nout the conditional expected return, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61 , and the conditional expected dividend growth rate, \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61 . These filtered variables are also combinations of state variables. We replicate the analysis of\nBinsbergen and Koijen (2010), and throughout our analysis in this paper, we compare our state-\nspace representation via valuation ratios with the information about state space in \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61 . Kelly and Pruitt (2013) also take a state-space approach and use the cross-section of market-to-\nbook ratios of individual stocks to extract the conditional expected return of the aggregate stock\nmarket. We have also replicated Kelly and Pruitt (2013) and include \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 for comparison."

            "heading": "3.2 Analyzing the dimension of the state space",
            "text": "We are interested in determining the dimension of the state space. Traditionally, a variety of\nmacroeconomic and financial-market variables have been incorporated into different analytical\n15\nframeworks as the state variables that generate the relevant information for asset pricing (e.g.,\nCieslak and Pang, 2021). For example, the market price-dividend ratio, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , has been commonly selected as a state variable (Muir, 2017). However, there has been limited evidence on the dimen-\nsion of the state space, i.e., how many state variables are needed in an asset pricing framework.\nAmong the theoretical studies, such as Lettau and Wachter (2007) and Binsbergen and Koijen\n(2010), a common assumption is that two state variables are sufficient for characterizing the stock\nmarket dynamics and, in particular, for predicting returns and cash-flow growth. In these models,\nthese two state variables are often directly specified as the conditional expectation of return and\nthe conditional expectation of cash-flow growth.\nAccording to our analysis in Section 2, one way to determine the dimension of the state\nspace is to analyze the collection of valuation ratios, such as those of dividend strips, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, and\nour measure of market duration \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f . In Panel A of Figure 2, we report the results from principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, and valuation ratios of dividend strips with maturities of six\nmonths, one year, and of dividends paid beyond one year. The first two components account for\n96.3% of total variance. In correspondence with our theoretical analysis in Section 2, we show\nin Panel B of Figure 2 that these valuation ratios have different loadings on the two principal\ncomponents, labeled as Dim1 (dimension 1) and Dim2 (dimension 2).\nThe results in Figure 2 indicate that the state space, mapped out by the valuation ratios, is\nlikely to be two-dimensional, and that we may pick any two valuation ratios, for example, the\npair of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , to span the state space. However, as pointed out by Kelly and Pruitt (2015),\na shortcoming of PCA analysis is that the information embedded in the principal components\nmay not be the information most relevant for objects of interest, which, in asset pricing studies,\nare cash-flow and return dynamics. Therefore, we also take a predictive regression approach to\nanalyze the state space. The expected return and expected dividend growth rate are driven by the\nstate variables. By projecting future returns and dividend growth rates on the valuation ratios,\nwe are able to evaluate how many valuation ratios are needed to achieve the highest predictive\npower and thereby analyze the dimension of the underlying state space based on information\n16\nrelevant to cash-flow and return dynamics.\nIn Figure 3, we report the \ud835\udc452 of predicting the annual dividend growth of the S&P 500 index\nin the next year with different combinations of valuation ratios. We report the detailed regression\nresults in Table A.1 in the Appendix. Our predictive regression is run on monthly observations.\nIn the first specification, the predictors include \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, which achieve the highest adjusted\n\ud835\udc452. In the next specification, for comparison, we show the forecasting performance of \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc39 , the\npredictor from Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) who develop a latent state model and filter out the\nconditional expectation of growth rate \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc39 .\n17\nIn the third specification in Figure 3, we include our market duration measure \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f alone.\nInterestingly, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f shows limited return predictive power in comparison with the combination of\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51. This is surprising as one would expect that when \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f increases, i.e., the stock mar-\nket assigns a higher valuation to long-run dividends than the short-run dividends, the expected\ngrowth rate of dividends should rise accordingly. In the fourth specification, we show that the\ntraditional price-dividend ratio also has limited cash-flow predictive power.\nThe weak standalone predictive power of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 stands in contrast with the strong\npredictive power of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 combined in the first specification. This again indicates that to\nfully capture the information embedded in the state variables, two valuation ratios are needed.\nIn the subsequent specifications, we show that different pairs of valuation ratios exhibit different\ncash-flow predictive power. This shows the importance of taking a predictive regression approach\nin determining the dimension of the state space rather than simply relying on PCA of valuation\nratios. Any given pair of valuation ratios fully spans the two principal components, as indicated\nin the linearly independent principal-component loadings of different valuation ratios in Panel\nB of Figure 2. However, different pairs of valuation ratios may still contain different information\nabout return and cash-flow dynamics.\nIn the last five specifications in Figure 3, we show that three or four valuation ratios do not\noutperform two valuation ratios in forecasting dividend growth. The adjusted \ud835\udc452 we report is\nin-sample \ud835\udc452, which does not reflect poor out-of-sample performance due to potential overfitting\nfrom adding more predictors; in other words, when competing with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, the three or four\nvaluation ratios do not have a mechanical disadvantage due to our choice of performance metric.\nOverall, our results indicate that two valuation ratios (in particular, the combination of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51) are the necessary minimum and sufficient for forecasting dividend growth.\nNext, we examine the dimension of the state space by forecasting returns. In Figure 4, we\nreport the \ud835\udc452 of predicting the annual return of S&P 500 with different combinations of price-\ndividend ratios. Our predictive regression is run monthly. We report the detailed regression\nresults in Table A.2 in the Appendix. The conclusion is similar to that in cash-flow prediction.\n18\nHaving three or more price-dividend ratios does not improve predictability relative to the best\nperformance of combinations of two price-dividend ratios. In particular, combining \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\nachieves the best forecasting performance. These results again suggest that the state space is\ntwo-dimensional, and to capture the information embedded in state variables, we need \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\nfor the purposes of analyzing both return and cash-flow dynamics.\nInterestingly, the predictive power of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f alone is comparable to that of two or more valu-\nation ratios. Moreover, in the second, third, and fourth specifications in Figure 4, we find that\n\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39 , the return predictor in Binsbergen and Koijen (2010), \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43 , the return predictor in Kelly and\nPruitt (2013), and the traditional price-dividend ratio all underperform \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f in our sample period.\n19\nOverall, our results suggest a close connection between \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and the conditional expected return. This finding is critical for understanding what drives the variation of market duration and, vice\nversa, what drives the expected return. We will explore this topic in the next section.\nBefore we move on to Section 4, we briefly discuss the rich information content of the pair\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 beyond forecasting return and cash-flow growth. In Table A.3 in the Appendix, we\nreport the \ud835\udc452 from forecasting a variety of macroeconomic and financial-market variables with\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, only \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , only \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, and for illustration purposes, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f in combination with \ud835\udc601 (the log\nprice-dividend ratio of one-year dividend strip), and only \ud835\udc601. The pair \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 demonstrate the\nstrongest and most consistent predictive power when forecasting variables related to financial\nintermediaries\u2019 balance-sheet capacity (with the \ud835\udc452 ranging from 30% to 40%). When forecasting\nmacroeconomic variables related to business-cycle dynamics, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 have an \ud835\udc452 consistently\nabove 20%. Moreover, the \ud835\udc452 from forecasting sentiment proxies is consistently above 10%. Fi-\nnally, combining \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 outperforms other specifications.\nOverall, our results suggest that \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 together provide not only relevant information\nfor understanding asset-pricing dynamics but also other key objects in macro-finance. Through\nour analysis, we hope to demonstrate the importance of incorporating market duration, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , as a\nkey state variable in macro-finance studies."

            "text": "We run the standard predictive regression to forecast market return in the next twelve months:\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1 = \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61+1, (16)\nBecause we use overlapping monthly data, we adopt Newey andWest (1987) standard errors with\n18 lags to account for the moving-average structure induced by overlap (Cochrane and Piazzesi,\n2005). We also calculate Hodrick (1992) standard errors. Hodrick (1992) shows that GMM-based\nautocovariance correction (e.g., Newey and West, 1987) may have poor small-sample properties.\nUnder the serial correlation in the error term, another concern is the bias induced by the persistence of the predictor.11 While \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 has an autocorrelation below that of the traditional pricedividend ratio, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , we still report the adjusted estimate of \ud835\udefd following Stambaugh (1999). In the appendix (Table A.4), we also report the IVX-Wald test of predictive power (Kostakis, Magdalinos,\nand Stamatogiannis, 2014) that explicitly accounts for the predictor persistence.\nThe adjusted \ud835\udc452 measures in-sample fitness. Several studies raised concerns over the out-\nof-sample performance of return predictors (Bossaerts and Hillion, 1999; Goyal andWelch, 2007).\nTo address these issues, we report the out-of-sample \ud835\udc452 and two formal tests of out-of-sample\nperformance. We calculate out-of-sample forecasts as a real-time investor, using data up to time\n\ud835\udc61 in the predictive regression to estimate \ud835\udefd, which is then multiplied by the time-\ud835\udc61 value of the\npredictor to form the forecast. Out-of-sample forecasting starts from December 1997, when we\nhave at least ten years of data. Out-of-sample \ud835\udc452 is\n\ud835\udc452\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46 = 1 \u2212 \u2211\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1)\n2\n\u2211\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc61) 2 ,\nwhere \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1 is the forecast value and \ud835\udc5f is the average of twelve-month returns (the first is JanuaryDecember 1998). The out-of-sample \ud835\udc452 lies in the range (\u2212\u221e, 1], where a negative number means 11The persistence of a return predictor can cause small-sample bias (Nelson and Kim, 1993; Stambaugh, 1999) and spurious regression (Ferson, Sarkissian, and Simin, 2003).\n21\nthat a predictor provides a less accurate forecast than the historical mean.\nWe report the p-value of two out-of-sample performance tests, \u201c\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\u201d and \u201c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4a \u201d. \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36 is\nthe encompassing forecast test derived by Clark and McCracken (2001), which is widely used in\nthe literature. We test whether the predictor has the same out-of-sample forecasting performance\nas the historical mean and compare the value of the statistic with critical values calculated by\nClark and McCracken (2001) to obtain a p-value range. Clark andWest (2007) adjust the standard\nMSE t-test statistic to produce a modified statistic (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4a ) that has an asymptotic distribution well\napproximated by the standard normal distribution, so for \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4a , we report the precise p-value.\n22\nTable 2 presents the results. Column (1) shows that the market duration, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , demonstrates\na striking degree of return predictive power. The in-sample estimation generates a predictive \ud835\udc452 reaching 24.8%.12 Out-of-sample forecasts deliver an \ud835\udc452 of 14.6%, significantly outperforming the historical mean as shown by the p-values of \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36 and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4a .13 The predictive coefficient is also\nlarge in magnitude, indicating high volatility of the conditional expected return. A decrease of\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 by one standard deviation adds 7.7% to the expected return. Both Newey-West and Hodrick t-statistics are significant at least at the 1% level.\nColumn (2) of Table 2 reports the results for \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 . The predictive power of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 is much\nweaker than \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 in all aspects. Its in-sample \ud835\udc452 is almost half of that of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 barely exhibits any out-of-sample predictive power with \ud835\udc452 equal to 0.4%. In both \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36 and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4a tests, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 fails to beat the historical mean with any statistical significance. Its coefficient is smaller in magnitude\nthan that of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 . A decrease in \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 by one standard deviation leads to an increase of expected return by 5.8%, implying a less volatile expected return than the one from \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 . The IVX-Wald test of Kostakis, Magdalinos, and Stamatogiannis (2014) in Table A.4 in the Appendix also supports\nthe significant predictive power of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 while rejecting the predictive power of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 .\nNext, we compare \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 with two return predictors that are conceptually related. Binsbergen\nand Koijen (2010) extract information about state variables that drive the conditional expected\nreturn and expected cash-flow growth by estimating a latent-state model. Our approach differs\nas we do not estimate or filter the state variables but instead rely on \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , and valuation ratios of dividend strips. In particular, the construction of our preferred return predictor, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 , only requires the total market capitalization and the price of dividends paid in the next year, which\nare directly observed from the market rather than estimated. In Column (3) of Table 2, we follow\nthe procedure in Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) to construct their return predictor, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61 . While \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61 slightly outperforms \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , its predictive power is weaker than that of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 across different metrics. 12Foster, Smith, and Whaley (1997) discuss the potential data mining issues that arise from researchers searching among potential regressors. They derive a distribution of the maximal \ud835\udc452 when \ud835\udc58 out of \ud835\udc5a potential regressors are used as predictors and calculate the critical value for \ud835\udc452, below which the prediction is not statistically significant. For instance, when \ud835\udc5a = 50, \ud835\udc58 = 5, and the number of observations is 250, the 95% critical value for \ud835\udc452 is 0.164.\n13In our calculation of out-of-sample \ud835\udc452 starts from Dec. 1997 (after the first ten years of data). Figure A.8 in the Appendix reports the out-of-sample \ud835\udc452 for different start dates and compares the OOS \ud835\udc452 of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f with that of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51.\n23\nNote that Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) conduct analysis with a time period different from ours.\nOur sample period is constrained by the availability and reliability of index futures data and ends\nbefore the Covid-19 era of extreme downward and upward market movements.\nWhile Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) use the aggregate data on realized returns and div-\nidend growth, Kelly and Pruitt (2013) demonstrate another filtering method that utilizes the\ncross-section of market-to-book ratios of individual stocks. Individual stocks\u2019 market-to-book\nratios map out the state variables that drive the aggregate market but, as we show in Appendix\nI.2, these valuation ratios contain noise that is orthogonal to the expected market return. Kelly\nand Pruitt (2013) use the method of partial least squares to reduce the noise. Our approach dif-\nfers as we avoid dealing with such noise. \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , and the valuation ratios of dividend strips of the aggregate market differ in their loadings on the aggregate state variables but do not contain\nidiosyncratic noise. In our approach, the challenge is to find the valuation ratio or a combination\nof valuation ratios whose state-variable loadings coincide with those of the conditional expected\nreturn and thereby achieve the highest predictive power. In the next subsection, we characterize\nthe necessary and sufficient condition for \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 to be such a return predictor. Following the procedure in Kelly and Pruitt (2013), we construct their return predictor, denoted by \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 . In column (4) of Table 2, we report the prediction results. \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 significantly outperforms \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 but still underperforms \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 across different metrics, such as Newey-West t-statistic, Hodrick t-statistic, in-sample \ud835\udc452, out-of-sample \ud835\udc452, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4a , and, IVX-Wald test reported in Table A.4 in the Appendix.\nWhile these return predictors are correlated as shown in Table 3, their predictive power\n24\ndiffers significantly with market duration outperforming the rest. In the appendix, we demon-\nstrate the robustness of our results by repeating the analysis with different forecasting targets.\nIn Table A.5, we replace the S&P 500 annual return with the excess S&P 500 annual return, and\nin Table A.6 and A.7, we consider the Fama-French market portfolio return and excess return,\nrespectively. Finally, we also show that market duration demonstrates superior return predictive\npower at a monthly horizon. Our baseline results are reported in A.8, and see Table A.9 for results\non predicting monthly S&P 500 excess return. Table A.10 and Table A.11 report the results on\npredicting the monthly Fama-French market portfolio return and excess return, respectively.\nSo far, we have compared the return predictive power of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 with that of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , which together\nwith \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 span the state space. We also considered \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 that are conceptually related. Figure 5 compares \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f with other predictors proposed in the literature, including the price-dividend ratio\n(pd), the default yield spread (dfy), the inflation rate (infl), stock variance (svar), the cross-section\npremium (csp), the dividend payout ratio (de), the long-term yield (lty), the term spread (tms), the\nT-bill rate (tbl), the default return spread (dfr), the dividend yield (dy), the long-term rate of return\n(ltr), the earnings-to-price ratio (ep), the book tomarket ratio (bm), the investment-to-capital ratio\n(ik), the net equity expansion ratio (ntis), the percent equity issuing ratio (eqis), the consumption-\nwealth-income ratio (cay), the short interests index (SII), and the option-implied lower bound of 1-year equity premium (SVIX).14 Most predictors are studied in a return predictability survey by\nGoyal and Welch (2007), and others are proposed more recently, such as the short interest index,\n\u201cSII\u201d in Rapach, Ringgenberg, and Zhou (2016), and SVIX (Martin, 2017). In the comparison, we also include \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc61 , and \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 from Table 2.15\nIn Figure 5, we report in-sample (\u201cIS\u201d) \ud835\udc452, out-of-sample (\u201cOOS\u201d) \ud835\udc452, the absolute values of\nNewey-West, and Hodrick t-statistics. \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f outperforms other predictors in all aspects. Among the\nalternatives, \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43 , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, and the book-to-market ratio (\u201c\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5a\u201d) deliver themost consistent performance 14Note that the dividend yield (dy) is not the inverse of price-dividend ratio (\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51) because in the denominator of dy is the lagged market value (not the current value). 15When constructing \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 , we estimate the partial least squares model following the procedure in Kelly and Pruitt (2013). In Figure A.5, We report the comparison of return predictive power using the authors\u2019 original parameter estimates rather than our own estimates.\n25\nacross the four metrics while \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39 exhibits strong performance except for OOS \ud835\udc452. The performance\nof other return predictors is not quite consistent across different metrics.\nIn Table A.12, we report the correlation between \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and these predictors. Besides \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc39 ,\nand \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc43 , all the other predictors with correlation above 50% or below -50%, are all valuation ratios,\n26\nsuch as the market-to-book ratio and price-earnings ratio. This is consistent with the intuition\nin Kelly and Pruitt (2013) and with our emphasis on using valuation ratios to capture informa-\ntion embedded in the state variables. In the appendix, we compare \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f with other predictors for\nalternative forecasting targets, such as S&P 500 excess annual return (Figure A.2), Fama-French\nmarket portfolio annual return (Figure A.3), and Fama-French market portfolio excess annual\nreturn (Figure A.4). As shown in Figure A.5, market duration exhibits the strongest predictive\npower across the four metrics and such performance is consistent across all forecasting targets."

Next, we show that the conditional expected return\nis a univariate function of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f (and vice versa) when the market does not contain information\non future cash-flow growth beyond the next year. Intuitively, under this condition, the price of\nnext year\u2019s dividends exhausts all information about future cash-flow growth, so \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , which is the\nlogarithm of market value minus the logarithm of the price of next year\u2019s dividend, teases out\ncash-flow information and only contains information about the discount rate.\nStock prices are determined by the conditional expectations of future returns and dividends\nover different horizons (Campbell and Shiller, 1988). Therefore, a model of the aggregate stock\nmarket requires at least two state variables that capture the conditional expected return and\ndividend growth; in other words, the lower bound of the state-space dimension is two. Our\nanalysis so far shows that two is also the upper bound. Guided by our findings in Section 3, we\nsimplify the general model in Section 2 by specifying a two-dimensional state space. As in Lettau\nand Wachter (2007) and Binsbergen and Koijen (2010), one state variable drives the conditional\nexpectation of the dividend growth rate, and the second state variable drives the conditional\nexpected return through the price of risk. Specifically, \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61 is given by\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc54 \u2212 1 2 \ud835\udf0e\u22a4\ud835\udc37\u03a3\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc37, (17)\n27\nwhere \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 has the following law of motion\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61+1 = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf0e\u22a4\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61+1 . (18)\nThe second state variable, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 , with a law of motion\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61+1 = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf0e\u22a4\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61+1 , (19)\ndrives the price of risk \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc61 , so equation (5) becomes\n\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf06 + \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 , (20)\nand the stochastic discount factor (SDF) is given by\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc61+1 = exp { \u2212\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc53 \u2212\n1 2 \ud835\udf062\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udf0e \u22a4 \ud835\udf06\u03a3\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf06)\n2 \u2212 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc61\ud835\udf0e\u22a4\ud835\udf06 \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61+1 } . (21)\nIn a two-dimensional state space where one state variable, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 , is assigned to drive the expected dividend growth rate, the price of risk, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc61 , must be unidimensional, driven by \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 , and accordingly, shocks enter into the SDF as a scalar, i.e., the linear combination given by \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf06. Any shock can be priced. The price of risk for the \ud835\udc5b-th shock is \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc61\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf06(\ud835\udc5b), where \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf06(\ud835\udc5b) is the \ud835\udc5b-th element of \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf06.\nAs in Section 2, the \ud835\udc41 -by-1 shock vector \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61+1 contains all information at \ud835\udc61 + 1. The vari-\nables\u2019 shock loadings may differ, for example, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc67 \u2260 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc66 . \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 can be correlated through their overlapping exposure to shocks. Also note that, in comparison with the general model in Section\n2, the state-variable loadings of \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc61 , i.e., \ud835\udf19 and \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc61 are set to one. This simplification can be done as \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc61 load on one state variable, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 , respectively.\nIn Appendix I, we solve the log price-dividend ratio of the aggregate market\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 , (22)\n28\nwhere \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 , \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 , and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 are constant. And the log price-dividend ratio of the dividend strip that matures in one year,\n\ud835\udc601\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc341 + \ud835\udc351\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc361\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 .

Since \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 have different loadings on \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 , we can solve \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 from \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 . Therefore, market duration and the traditional pricedividend ratio span the state space. In particular, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 contain all the necessary information for forecasting return and dividend growth as we show in Section 3.\nProposition 1 (Spanning) The state variables are functions of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , and vice versa.\nIn Appendix I, we show \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 = 1/(1 \u2212 \ud835\udf051\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67) and \ud835\udc361 = 1 and obtain the following result.\nProposition 2 (Discount rate and duration) The conditional expected return is a function of \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc61[\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1] = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f + \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 , (25)\nwhere \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f are constant. Under \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 = 0, \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc61[\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1] is a univariate function of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and vice versa.\nWhen \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67, the autoregressive coefficient of expected dividend growth rate \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 , is zero, we have\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 \u2212 \ud835\udc341 + (\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 \u2212 \ud835\udc351)\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 as the exposure of market duration to \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 is muted. As \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 drives the conditional expected return, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc61[\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1] become univariate functions of one another. Market participants\u2019 information at time \ud835\udc61 about future dividends is summarized by \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 which determines the expected dividend growth rate from \ud835\udc61 to \ud835\udc61 + 1. Therefore, if \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 lacks persistence, the market participants do not have information about dividends beyond \ud835\udc61 + 1. By construction, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 teases out information about dividend growth up to \ud835\udc61 + 1 by deducting \ud835\udc601\ud835\udc61 from \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 , so, intuitively, it contains only the information about the discount rate or expected return under \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 = 0.\n29"

            "text": "We estimate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67, the persistence of expected dividend growth, using two approaches. Our main analysis is based on analyst forecasts as a proxy for market participants\u2019 growth expectations.\nWe estimate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 with two econometric models. For robustness, we also estimate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 by fitting the latent state model given by (17) and (18) to dividend data.\nOur model does not require investors to have rational expectations. As a matter of fact,\neven if the data-generating processes differ from equations (17) and (18) in our model, as long as\nagents in this economy take these equations as the stochastic processes that govern the aggregate\ndividends, our results on stock and dividend strip valuation hold. Therefore, to estimate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67, the persistence of the expected dividend growth rate, we examine market participants\u2019 subjective\nexpectations\u2014the analyst forecasts obtained from IBES.\nA large literature has demonstrated that analyst forecasts reflect analysts\u2019 beliefs as their\ncompensation are tightly linked to forecast precision, and that analyst forecasts are likely to\nrepresent the market participants\u2019 beliefs more broadly (e.g., Mikhail, Walther, and Willis, 1999;\nCooper, Day, and Lewis, 2001; Bradshaw, 2004). Admittedly, analyst forecasts may be distorted\ndue to various incentive and institutional frictions (e.g., Gu andWu, 2003; Malmendier and Shan-\nthikumar, 2007, 2014). However, the bias is contained as long as such frictions do not vary over\ntime systematically in a way that correlates with the analysts\u2019 true beliefs. Moreover, we will\nsupplement our estimate of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 based on analyst forecasts with an alternative estimate from a standard filtering approach applied to the state space model given by equation (17) and (18).\nRecent studies using analysts\u2019 cash-flow expectations have made substantial progress in\nexplaining a variety of phenomena in asset pricing.16 Moreover, our focus on the persistence of 16For example, Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer (2019) find that analyst forecasts of firms\u2019 long-term earnings growth overreact to news about fundamentals, leading to predictable cross-sectional return variations. De La O and Myers (2021) show that analyst short-term earnings forecasts, aggregated to the S&P 500 index level, explain a substantial share of the price-dividend ratio\u2019s variation. Nagel and Xu (2022) propose a model where agents form beliefs of cash-flow growth based on their experienced growth. Such beliefs give rise to a sizable and countercyclical equity premium. Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer (forthcoming) incorporate analyst forecasts of short- and long-term earnings of the S&P 500 index into a dividend discount model with a constant discount rate, which generates a \u201csynthetic\" index price that closely resembles the actual price and exhibits \u201cexcess\u201d volatility.\n30\nagents\u2019 growth expectations is related to the theoretical and empirical works of Gabaix (2019) and\nWang (2020), who highlight the importance of agents\u2019 perceived persistence of key state variables\nin generating patterns of under and over-reaction in belief formation and asset prices.\nAs the coverage of dividend forecasts started in 2003 in IBES and is too short for our anal-\nysis, we follow the literature and proxy for analysts\u2019 expectation of dividend growth with their\nearnings forecasts (available since 1976). The following accounting identity connects the earn-\nings and dividends: \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 = Earnings\ud835\udc61 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 plowback rate\ud835\udc61). As documented by P\u00e1stor, Sinha, and Swaminathan (2008) and Chen, Da, and Zhao (2013), the plowback rate is quite stable. Therefore,\nthe growth rates of dividends are empirically close to those of earnings: For \ud835\udc58 = 1, 2, and 3 years,\n\u0394\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58 \u2261 ln( \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58\u22121) \u2248 \u0394\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58 \u2261 ln( Earnings\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58 Earnings\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58\u22121) . (26)\nNote that \u0394\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58 is the one-year growth rate from \ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc58 \u2212 1 to \ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc58. For example, for \ud835\udc58 = 2, \u0394\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61+2 is the dividend growth rate from \ud835\udc61 + 1 to \ud835\udc61 + 2. The same notation applies to earnings and earnings\ngrowth expectations. Taking the analyst\u2019s expectations, \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 (\u22c5), on both sides, we can proxy for expected dividend growth using expected earnings growth:\n\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 (\u0394\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58) \u2248 \ud835\udd3c \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc61 (\u0394\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58) \u2248 ln( \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 (Earnings\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58) \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 (Earnings\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58\u22121)) , (27)\n31\nwhere, for \ud835\udc58 = 1, \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 (Earnings\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc58\u22121) = Earnings\ud835\udc61 is the realized dividend in the current year.17\nIBES Global Aggregates (IGA) provides a forecast of aggregate earnings growth for the\nS&P 500 index based on firm-level earnings forecasts. The aggregation procedure weighs individual companies by their market capitalization.18 To transform earnings forecasts to forecasts\nof growth rates, IGA takes the procedure given by equation (27). The IGA data is available at a\nweekly frequency. We consider both weekly and monthly frequencies. For monthly frequency,\nwe take the last weekly observation of each month. At time \ud835\udc61, analysts\u2019 forecasts of earnings\nare available at three horizons: one, two, and three years, i.e., \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61+1), \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61+2), and \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61+3). Moreover, since IGA does not aggregate firm-level long-term growth (LTG) forecasts, we follow the same aggregation procedure to create an index-level LTG forecast that\nwill allow us to estimate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 with alternative methods.

The identification assumption is that under the econometricians\u2019 belief, the expectation of the disturbance \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61 is zero conditional on \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 . The deviations of analysts\u2019 expectations from market participants\u2019 expectations are allowed to be correlated across the starting dates of annual dividend growth, i.e., \ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61 + 1, and \ud835\udc61 + 2.19\nWe estimate equation (29) with both monthly (columns 1 and 3) and weekly observations\n(columns 2 and 4) of analyst forecasts. The results are reported in Table 5, Panel A. In columns\n(1) and (2), our estimation includes both equations in (29), while in Column (3) and (4), we only\ninclude the first equation, i.e., only using forecasts at one- and two-year horizons for better data\nquality. Across the specifications, the estimate ?\u0302?\ud835\udc67 is statistically indistinguishable from zero. 19The identification of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 is robust to the correlation between these errors and \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc61 in the model in Section 2, i.e., the structural shocks to realized dividend, market participants\u2019 beliefs on cash-flow dynamics, and their price of risk.\n33\nTable 6 The Persistence of Expected Cash-Flow Growth from LTG Forecasts This table reports the estimates of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc67 , the regression coefficient in\nlog(1 + \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc61) = const + \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 [\u0394\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61+1] + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc61 ,\nwhere \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc61 is the long-term growth forecasts (LTG) of the S&P 500 Index, self-aggregated from stock-level LTG forecasts from the IBES Unadjusted Summary File. The short-term forecast, \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 [\u0394\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61+1], is the IGA 1-year earnings growth forecast (IGA \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 [\u0394\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61+1]). \ud835\udc61-statistics based on Newey-West standard errors with autocorrelation of up to 18 lags are reported in parentheses. Our monthly observations are from 1988:01 to 2019:12.\n(1)\nlog(1 + \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc61)\nIntercept 0.116 (28.615) \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 [\u0394\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61+1] 0.017 (0.711)\n\ud835\udc41 384 \ud835\udc452 0.011\nNext, we consider an alternative way to estimate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 by exploring the relationship between\nforecasts of short-term and long-term earnings growth (LTG). IBES provides firm-level forecasts\nof the annualized average growth rate of earnings over the next three to five years and has been\nadopted in the recent literature on expectation formation (e.g., La Porta, 1996 and Bordalo, Gen-\nnaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer, 2019). Given the autoregressive structure in equation (18), the\nexpected growth rate from period \ud835\udc5b to \ud835\udc5b + 1 depends on the expected growth rate over the very\nnext period via a coefficient \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc67 . If \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 is zero, then such a coefficient is zero, which implies that the average growth rate over three years and beyond does not depend on the expected growth rate\nover the next year. Therefore, we regress monthly observations of LTG forecast on \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61 [\u0394\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61+1], and denote the regression coefficient by \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc67 . Our estimate of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc67 is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Consistent with our findings in Table 5, this implies \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67.\nOur final method to estimate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 is to directly estimate the state-space model given by equa-\ntions (17) and (18) with the realized dividend data. Using the standard Kalman filter, we obtain es-\ntimates of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67. For comparison, we report results for both the S&P 500 index and the Fama-French market portfolio (\u201cMKT\u201d).20 Since the model is set up at annual frequency, we use annual (non20We obtain dividend data for the Fama-French market portfolio from the CRSP NYSE/NYSEMKT/Nasdaq ValueWeighted Market Index.\n34\noverlapping) dividend growth data. The sample spans 1926 to 2019.21 The results are reported in\nTable 7, where Panel A and B are for S&P 500 and MKT, respectively. In the row \u201cUnrestricted\u201d of Panel A and B of Table 7, the estimates of ?\u0302?\ud835\udc67 are statistically indistinguishable from zero.22 The restricted model with \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 = 0 generates similar likelihood and information criteria, indicating that allowing \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 to be a free parameter does not significantly improve the model fitness. We also estimate MA(1) and AR(1) models for comparison and find that the estimates of the autoregres-\nsive coefficient, i.e., \ud835\udf12 and \ud835\udefe for MA(1) and AR(1), respectively, are statistically indistinguishable\nfrom zero. In sum, the state-space approach delivers a similar message as the estimation based 21We also used the longest available S&P 500 dividend series starting from 1872 and obtained similar results. The results are available upon request. 22The Kalman filter assumes that the shocks to realized and expected dividend growth are uncorrelated. In the appendix, we demonstrate the robustness of our estimate of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 by considering different values of the correlation, from -0.9 to 0.9, while fixing the volatility of realized-dividend shock at the estimate in Panel A. The estimated \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 barely moves with the value of shock correlations in [\u22120.9, 0.9] as shown in Figure A.7.\n35\non analyst forecasts: The persistence of growth expectation is close to zero.\nIn the last exercise, we conduct a rolling-window estimation of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 following the method in\nTable 5. A rolling window contains three years of weekly observations.23 The summary statistics\nof the rolling-window estimates are reported in Table 8. Naturally, the model of agents\u2019 belief\nformation may adjust over time, so the estimate of ?\u0302?\ud835\udc67 fluctuates. Overall, the results are similar to those in Table 5, and in particular, the mean and median of the ?\u0302?\ud835\udc67 series are close to zero. Our findings suggest that the expected cash-flow growth rate lacks persistence (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 is close to zero), which in our model implies a one-to-one mapping between market duration, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , and expected\nreturn. In the next proposition, we characterize more tightly the connection between the value\nof \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 and return predictability. The proof is in the Appendix.\nProposition 3 (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 and return forecast errors) Let \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc61+1 denote the forecast error when predicting\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61+1 with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and let \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 denote the autoregressive coefficient of expected cash flow growth \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 in equation\n(18). If \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 > 0, then \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc61+1 is positive. If \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 < 0, then \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc61+1 is negative.\nThe proposition implies that in a subsample where the estimate of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 is positive (nega-\ntive), we would expect the return forecasting error to be positive (negative). In Figure 6, we plot\nthe rolling-window estimate of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 estimates against the return forecasting residuals (denoted by \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc61) from the corresponding rolling window with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 as the predictor. The two time series track each other closely, with a correlation of 0.42.24 This provides further evidence of the connection\nbetween return predictability and the lack of persistence in expected cash-flow growth. 23The results are similar if we use alternative window lengths from one to five years (available upon request). Our sample period is 1988\u20132019. The first estimate of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 uses three years of IGA data starting in 1985. 24In Figure A.6 in the Appendix, we plot \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67,\ud835\udc61 against the out-of-sample forecast errors and obtain a similarly positive correlation. We also regress the rolling-window return prediction errors, both in-sample and out-of-sample, on the rolling-window estimate of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 and find a positive regression coefficient (see Table A.13 in the Appendix).\n36\nMarket duration \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f is the log price-dividend ratio minus the valuation ratio of the one-year\ndividend strip, which, by construction, teases out market information about near-term growth\nembedded in the price of the one-year dividend strip. Therefore, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f only contains information\nabout the discount rate, if the market participants possess limited information about growth be-\nyond the next year. In our model, the time-\ud835\udc61 expectation of growth from \ud835\udc61+2 onward is a constant\nunder \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 = 0 so the market does not contain information about cash-flow growth beyond the next year under \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 = 0. Next, we step outside of our model given by equations (17) and (18) and consider more broadly whether the market contains information about long-term growth."

            "text": "In Section 4.3, our focus is on estimating \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67, the autoregressive coefficient of expected cash-flow growth. In our model, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67 = 0 implies that the market participants do not have information about cash-flow growth beyond the next year. While our analysis of state space in Section 3 supports\n37\nthe model specification, we want to step outside of our model and provide more evidence in this\nsubsection on the fact that market information about long-term growth is limited. We do so by\ncharacterizing cash-flow predictability at different horizons. Intuitively, if themarket participants\nhave information about cash-flow growth at a certain horizon, we should be able to predict such\ncash-flow growthwith information revealed in analysts\u2019 forecasts and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 as state variables.\nIn Table 9, we show strong predictability of near-term growth. In column (1), we simply\nregress the realized one-year growth rate of aggregate earnings from firms covered by IGA on the\nex ante analysts\u2019 forecast. The \ud835\udc452 is 0.73, so analysts andmarket participants in general are able to\nforecast near-term cash-flow growth verywell. In column (2), we use our pair of state variables, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\nand \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51, to forecast cash-flow growth and obtain a \ud835\udc452 of 0.20. Combining the information in \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 with the analysts\u2019 forecast in column (3), the in-sample prediction \ud835\udc452 rises to 0.77. In the other\ncolumns of Table 9, we replace the forecasting target. Naturally, cash-flow predictability declines\nin the other cases because the predictor (IGA analyst forecast, in particular) targets the earnings\ngrowth of IGA-covered firms rather than that of all firms covered by the Bloomberg database\n(columns 4-6) or that of all Compustat firms (columns 7-9). Overall, our findings suggest that\n38\nmarket participants are informed of near-term cash-flow growth. One explanation is that firms\ntend to provide forward guidance on their earnings outlook, increasingly so in recent years.\nNext, we examine the predictability of cash-flow growth at longer horizons. So far, our\nanalysis of growth expectations has been based on the autoregressive model given by equations\n(17) and (18), and the focus has been on \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67, the persistence parameter, and its connection with the return predictive power of market duration \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f . In this model, we have the time-\ud835\udc61 expected\ngrowth from \ud835\udc61 + 1 to \ud835\udc61 + 2, \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc61[\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61+2] = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udc61[\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61+1] = \ud835\udf0c2\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 , so market information about long-term growth is contained in the expected growth rate over the next period. In the following exercises,\nwe expand the set of potential predictors of long-term growth. In particular, we consider the LTG\nforecast, the aggregated long-term growth forecast over three to five years.\nIn Table 10, we first predict earnings growth over the next year from columns (1) to (3), and\nconsistent with our findings in Table 9, predictability is strong, which suggests that market par-\nticipants are informed about short-term growth. In columns (4) to (6), we use the same variables\nto predict earnings growth from \ud835\udc61 + 1 to \ud835\udc61 + 2 and find that predictability declines dramatically.\n39\nComparing columns (1) and (4), the predictive \ud835\udc452 declines from 0.74 to 0.08. Our forecasting\nexercise in columns (7) to (9) delivers the same message. The predictability of growth over an\neven longer horizon, i.e., from \ud835\udc61 + 2 to \ud835\udc61 + 3, is even weaker. In Figure A.9 in the Appendix, we\nreport the results of alternative predictive models that take advantage of more valuation ratios\n(and potentially richer information embedded in the state space). Our conclusion remains robust.\nOverall, our findings suggest that market participants are not informed about long-term\ngrowth, but regarding short-term growth, market information, whether from analysts\u2019 forecasts\nor our state variables, is quite rich. These results on the term structure of cash-flow predictability\nshed light on the strong connection between market duration \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and expected return. By con-\nstruction, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f deducts the valuation ratio of the one-year dividend strip from the price-dividend\nratio \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc51 and thereby teases out market information about near-term growth.\nOne may form a market timing strategy guided by our findings on \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f as a return predictor.\nSpecifically, when market duration increases, the strategy shorts the market, and when market\nduration decreases, the strategy adds to the long position. This strategy bets against the market\nvaluation of long-duration cash flows. An out-of-sample \ud835\udc452 of 14.6% in column (1) of Table 2\nimplies that the Sharpe ratio of this market timing strategy is 0.58, which is much higher than the\nSharpe ratio from other return predictors, for example, 0.37 in Campbell and Thompson (2008).\nIn the appendix, we show how to calculate the Sharpe ratio based on the out-of-sample \ud835\udc452."

Such a connection between \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f and the discount rate emerges when market informa-\ntion on long-term cash flows is limited, and empirically, we document the supporting evidence\nof a sharp decline of cash-flow predictability once the forecasting horizon goes beyond one year.\nCochrane (2011) points out how return predictability emerges from the lack of cash-flow\npredictability and the price-dividend ratio should forecast future returns. We find that cash flows\nin the near term are in fact highly predictable, but cash flows over the long term are not. There-\nfore, our measure of market duration is a better return predictor than the price-dividend ratio.\nOur findings support a market timing strategy of betting against market duration. When the\nvaluation of long-term cash flows rises relative to that of near-term cash flows about which mar-\nket participants are more informed, it is likely due to a lower discount rate or exuberance over\nlong-term growth (Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer, forthcoming).\n41"
