    "abstractText": "This study contributes to the emerging literature on public perceptions of neurotechnological devices (NTDs) in their medical and non-medical applications, depending on their invasiveness, framing effects, and interindividual differences related to personal needs and values. We conducted two web-based between-subject experiments (2\u00d72\u00d72) using a representative, nation-wide sample of the adult population in Germany. Using vignettes describing how two NTDs, brain stimulation devices (BSDs; NExperiment 1 = 1,090) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs; NExperiment 2 = 1,089), function, we randomly varied the purpose (treatment vs. enhancement) and invasiveness (noninvasive vs. invasive) of the NTD, and assessed framing effects (variable order of assessing moral acceptability first vs. willingness to use first). We found a moderate moral acceptance and willingness to use BSDs and BCIs. Respondents preferred treatment over enhancement purposes and noninvasive over invasive devices. We also found a framing effect and explored the role of personal characteristics as indicators of personal needs and values (e.g., stress, religiosity, and gender). Our results suggest that the future demand for BSDs or BCIs may depend on the purpose, invasiveness, and personal needs and values. These insights can inform technology developers about the public\u2019s needs and concerns, and enrich legal and ethical debates.",

We conducted two web-based between-subject experiments (2\u00d72\u00d72) using a representative, nation-wide sample of the adult population in Germany. Using vignettes describing how\ntwo NTDs, brain stimulation devices (BSDs; NExperiment 1 = 1,090) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs; NExperiment 2 = 1,089), function, we randomly varied the purpose (treatment vs. enhancement) and invasiveness (noninvasive vs. invasive) of the NTD, and assessed fram-\ning effects (variable order of assessing moral acceptability first vs. willingness to use first).\nWe found a moderate moral acceptance and willingness to use BSDs and BCIs. Respon-\ndents preferred treatment over enhancement purposes and noninvasive over invasive\ndevices. We also found a framing effect and explored the role of personal characteristics as\nindicators of personal needs and values (e.g., stress, religiosity, and gender). Our results\nsuggest that the future demand for BSDs or BCIs may depend on the purpose, invasive-\nness, and personal needs and values. These insights can inform technology developers\nabout the public\u2019s needs and concerns, and enrich legal and ethical debates."

            "text": "Advancements in neurotechnological devices (NTDs) have grown exponentially in the pioneering spirit of research and entrepreneurship [1\u20133]. One example of NTDs are brain stimulation devices (BSDs), which use externally applied (e.g., on a headband), non-invasive electrodes, as in the case of transcranial direct current stimulation [4], or invasive implants, as in deep brain stimulation [5]. These have been found to improve cognitive functions in memory and decision-making tasks by stimulating the brain through electrical impulses [6, 7],\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 1 / 17\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Sattler S, Pietralla D (2022) Public attitudes towards neurotechnology: Findings from two experiments concerning Brain Stimulation Devices (BSDs) and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).

They use wearable\nor implanted electrodes to connect the central nervous system with computers that convert brain activity into artificial output signals [9]. These signals allow a real-time control of external devices, such as wheelchairs, body prostheses, or computer programs, that support functioning in disabled people [10]. This makes BCIs beneficial for clinical applications in repairing or mitigating motor, cognitive, emotional, and perceptual impairments in, for example, the context of a stroke [11, 12].\nBSDs and BCIs can be also used in the absence of medical conditions to alter or enhance\nkey human features beyond their \u201cnormal\u201d functioning by augmenting learning rates and other cognitive tasks [5, 13]. While it is debated what actually constitutes enhancement and where to draw the line in treatment, for example, as in restorative applications [14], the respective devices are becoming increasingly available on the consumer market [1]. They are also being developed more frequently in do-it-yourself communities for work, gaming, sports, or educational purposes [4]. Both medical and enhancement uses have sparked debate among scientists and ethicists about the implied ethical, legal, and social issues [10, 15\u201317]. Specifically, these issues include problems of brain hacking, informed consent, autonomy, personhood, stigma, or possible side effects, which warrant particular attention if used for enhancement becomes more prevalent [13, 18].\nAn assessment of NTDs that is regulated, informed, and democratic can advance the neuroethical debate and offer insights on how NTDs should be appropriately used and managed [19, 20]. Thus far, studies have begun exploring NTD usability and other related topics by surveying researchers\u2019 opinions, public concerns [12, 21], and patients\u2019 needs [22\u201324].\nHowever, public attitudes on NTDs are still underexplored. Assessing the moral acceptability of using NTDs can create insights into societal norms and the laypersons\u2019 understanding of them as personally or socially good or bad [25], reflecting their hopes and fears. Moral evaluations and measures capturing the willingness to engage in certain behaviors are also strong predictors of health- and non-health-related behavior, since they capture motivational factors for acting in a certain way [26\u201329]. This makes them useful in assessing new phenomena and trends, as in the context of emerging NTDs [30, 31]. How the public evaluates different uses of NTDs (i.e., treatment vs. enhancement) needs further understanding since it might depend on the type of NTD, how NTDs operate, and which population is asked [8, 15, 17]. Therefore, this study investigates whether the moral acceptability and the willingness to use BSDs and BCIs depends on the purpose of use, their invasiveness, and framing effects (i.e., the assessment order of moral acceptability and use willingness). To better understand diverging public attitudes, this study also examines whether moral acceptability and willingness to use can be attributed to interindividual differences related to personal needs and values, as well as whether such differences modulate the role of the use purpose (in an exploratory analysis, we tested for a potential three-way interaction between purpose, invasiveness, and framing effects, but did not find such interaction effects; therefore, we do not discuss this further).\nFurthering the understanding of diverging public attitudes towards NTDs\nThe role of the use purpose. Until recently, prescription drugs as a form of neurotechnol-\nogy have been the focus of research on perceptions regarding treatment and enhancement uses [32, 33]. Now, it is increasingly of interest whether and how this applies to a wider range of NTDs, such as BSDs and BCIs, because existing research has suggested that such differences may exist. Research on patients who have impaired mobility (e.g., Amyotrophic lateral\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 2 / 17\n[Reference 51: https://doi.org/10.4119/unibi/ 2966231].\nFunding: This work was supported by the German Research Foundation [grant numbers: SA 2992/2-1 to Mr. Sebastian Sattler and ME 2082/8-1 to Mr. Guido Mehlkop; URL: https://www.dfg.de].\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nsclerosis) has found enthusiasm for NTDs among participants, who reported high hopes for increasing their mobility, interactions, and communication [10, 12].\nWhile people more-readily accepted risks and ethical concerns when using NTDs for treat-\nment [34], using them for enhancement seems to be perceived more negatively [8, 25]. Despite its negative reception, the enormous increase in companies producing consumer NTDs [35] and their rapid increase in online sales may indicate a rising willingness, need, and curiosity to own and use them [36]. In the current study, we want to investigate the use of NTDs for treatment and enhancement purposes. The latter might be associated with more concerns about necessity and the potential negative consequences of using NTDs to create \u201csuper\u201d humans and more intense social competition [17, 25, 33, 37]. Despite the growing interest in using NTDs for enhancement, we expect a higher acceptability and willingness to use them for treatment [9, 25, 32, 33].\nThe role of invasiveness. According to Ko\u0308gel et al. [10], investigations of attitudes\ntowards NTDs must consider their method of operation. Invasive and noninvasive methods come with different risks, such as ethical concerns and varying levels of reliability [5]. These concerns differ among groups: While research with patients has found a relatively high willingness to use invasive BSDs [34], research on the public indicates more worries about invasive enhancements, and a greater magnitude of worries for its use as a treatment [25, 38]. The public\u2019s stronger rejection of invasive methods may reflect their perception that such methods are dangerous or unnatural [8, 25, 39, 40]. Therefore, we expect a higher moral acceptability and willingness to use noninvasive than invasive NTDs. Moreover, the potential risks and doubts related to invasive NTDs may reduce the acceptability and willingness to use them for enhancement rather than treatment purposes, for which risks and problems might be more tolerated. Therefore, we expect invasiveness to amplify the negative effects of treatment purposes.\nThe role of framing effects. Thinking about the morality of a behavior, e.g., using NTDs,\nmay activate concerns that reduce the willingness to use, while moral reasoning should be more stable. Seminal research suggests that if moral acceptability was assessed prior to use willingness (versus the opposite order), respondents showed a lower willingness to use NTDs [41]. Such a framing effect has been shown for enhancement uses (especially for noninvasive BSD), but it is unknown whether informing individuals about moral concerns of NTDs may reduce their acceptance for treatment [41]. Our study aims at replicating this first evidence and testing whether such effects also exist for treatment purposes. We expect that such a framing effect could be more pronounced for enhancement purposes, since activating moral concerns against enhancement uses might be more impactful than for treatment uses, which might be seen as less abdicable.\nInterindividual differences in attitudes towards NTDs. First studies have also tried to\nunderstand the characteristics of respondents supporting or opposing NTDs. This research has yielded inconclusive results and has hardly investigated whether attributes of the NTDs are judged differently by different people [10, 38]. However, respondents\u2019 individual perspectives and circumstances may affect their attitudes towards NTDs, as indicated by the research on prescription drugs used for enhancement, and less frequently for NTDs. Higher moral acceptance and use willingness can be expected among individuals who would have a greater need for NTDs, for example, to deal with stress and its negative consequences [29, 42\u201344]; to compensate for potential deficits, such as low levels of cognitive function [45]; and to cope with age-related cognitive and physical decline (such as vision or mobility) [46, 47].\nValues and ideologies may also shape the moral evaluation and the willingness to use\nNTDs. For example, some might more strongly reject these technologies on the basis that they are \u201cunnatural\u201d and they transgress human boundaries. Others might have a lower affinity for\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 3 / 17\ntechnology, which is more likely in religious [8, 17, 48], older [17, 25, 32, 41], less educated [49], or female [17, 41] populations. Therefore, we examine the role of chronic stress, cognitive functioning, religiosity, age, education, and gender as indicators of needing to use NTDs and individuals\u2019 values and ideologies towards such use. To gain more detailed insights about their role, we also investigate if individuals with certain respondent characteristics evaluate enhancement and treatment differently, since a need for using NTDs, or the values and ideologies towards them, may modulate the moral evaluation and use willingness of both uses differently (while one might argue that individuals with different characteristics also vary in their evaluation of whether NT is invasive vs. noninvasive, our exploratory analysis did not reveal any statistically significant interaction effects between the invasiveness factor and each investigated characteristic; thus, we do not further elaborate on this in the manuscript)."

            "text": "Overall, previous research has offered a first insight into public attitudes towards NTDs. However, this research had typically used qualitative designs, was descriptive or correlational, mostly only examined users of NTDs, or used measures like interest in NTDs. The existing quantitative studies often used small or nonrepresentative and self-selected samples, or used within-person experiments that can cause learning and contrast effects [50]. While discussion about cognitive enhancement drug use has increased [4], especially regarding student populations, more data on the public\u2019s attitudes regarding enhancement with NTDs are needed. Moreover, because the development of NTDs occurs rapidly and the knowledge about them changes, studies dating back even a few years deserve an updated view. Therefore, our study aims at increasing the understanding of the moral acceptability and willingness to use BSDs and BCIs, since both are emerging NTDs and they partially overlap (e.g., using technology that interacts with the brain), but also have distinct characteristics and uses (e.g., BSDs stimulate the brain, while BCIs can also control external devices). By investigating two NTDs, this study facilitates a better understanding of how public attitudes in Germany relate to both NTDs and the investigated factors. Using randomly selected samples of the general adult population in Germany, we conducted two between-subject experiments. This allows for a more generalizable, causally-oriented interpretation of the findings. We examined whether the moral acceptability and use willingness differ between using NTDs for treatment or enhancement purposes and noninvasive or invasive applications, as well as the possibility of a question-order-based framing effect. Moreover, we explored the role of various personal characteristics and whether they condition the effect of the purpose of use."

Thereby, every household in Germany has the same statistical chance of participation, infrequent internet users are captured, and self-selection into the panel is avoided. Our experiments were part of a larger study (ENHANCE) aiming for a greater heterogeneity of participants compared to student or crowdsourced samples. In the survey, individuals were randomly assigned to one of the experiments. Participation was voluntary and those who completed it received bonus points as incentives, which could be\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 4 / 17\nconverted to vouchers, a ticket for a charity lottery, or donated to UNICEF. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.\nIn Experiment 1 on BSDs (NExperiment 1 = 1,090 valid responses and usable data), the mean age of participants was 53 (SD = 15.62), with 44.4% being female and 55.5% holding a high school diploma (Table 1 provides descriptive statistics of all independent variables of both experiments).

Such factorial surveys combine the advantages of experiments (e.g., high internal validity) with those of survey research (e.g., high external validity due to more reliable samples) [54\u201356]. For both experiments, between-subject designs were used in which each respondent was randomly assigned to one vignette that describes an NTD, its potential areas of application, and a graphic that explains the basic functions [cf., 8, 17]. Each 2x2x2 experiment varied the purpose of use (treatment vs. enhancement), the invasiveness of the NTD (noninvasive vs. invasive), and the question order (moral acceptability before use willingness vs. the opposite order) (S1 and S2 Figs in S1 File, as well as S3 and S4 Figs in S1 File for original German wording).\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 5 / 17"

We found a statistically significant negative interaction\neffect between purpose of use and invasiveness (p = 0.001, Model 1 in S1 Table in S1 File). Thus, invasive enhancements were less morally acceptable than noninvasive enhancements (Panel A, Fig 2).

However, more respondents were definitely against using them than definitely for using them. Thus, the public neither fully embraces nor rejects NTDs [cf., 8, 12, 32]. Beyond this overall assessment, this study provides further insight into the specific conditions for attitudinal differences, thereby not overlooking more complex patterns of moral acceptance and willingness to use NTDs.\nTreatment preferred over enhancement\nOur finding of a substantially higher moral acceptability and willingness to use BSDs and BCIs for treatment than enhancement [cf., 8, 25] suggests more enthusiasm towards NTDs for restoring \u201cnormal\u201d functioning over achieving \u201csuperior\u201d functioning. Respondents seemed to be more willing to accept potential risks and ethical concerns when using NTDs for a purpose\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 9 / 17\nthat was considered necessary to improve well-being than simply to enhance one\u2019s normal functioning [8, 33, 34]. But the constantly growing and often positive media portrayal of new NTDs might fuel enthusiasm for both purposes [63]. Additionally, the rapid development and sale of NTDs may indicate an increased supply and demand for them for nonmedical purposes [35, 36]. When prevalence data are absent, monitoring public attitudes, like their willingness, will offer insights about how prevalent this practice might become in the future and how urgent it will be to regulate NTDs that will be used for enhancement. It is important to understand how realistic public expectations are about using NTDs for treatment and enhancement, and whether policies should proactively highlight their limitations and dangers [63]. While an overall public enthusiasm seems unlikely, education and clear communication about the actual benefits and risks is needed for NTDs to be used safely (Delhove, Osenk, Prichard, & Donnelley, 2020).\nHesitancy towards invasive devices\nOur findings demonstrate that respondents were concerned about how NTDs are applied [10], since invasive BSD and BCI devices were evaluated more morally negatively than noninvasive and resulted in a lower willingness to use. Although invasiveness may decrease visibility and potential stigma, the hesitancy towards invasive devices may reflect the potential higher risks they carry or the moral and ethical concerns involved, such as implications for personhood or unnaturalness [5, 40, 64]. While the use of invasive devices was not judged differently for treatment, the moral acceptability was lower when using BSDs for enhancement [25, 38]. The risk of using NTDs as treatment could potentially be accepted as a means to an end, but respondents were more cautious when it was used for enhancement.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 10 / 17\nCorrelation between both attitudes and question order effect\nThe substantial correlation between the moral acceptability and willingness to use both devices [25, 29, cf., 65] could indicate that moral concerns are antecedents of intended or actual behavior. It can be argued that acting against moral concerns can evoke psychological consequences; acting in line with them can lead to positive emotions [66\u201368]. Moreover, moral evaluations can reflect how individuals define situations, which often consciously and unconsciously guide decision-making [69]. This is interesting, since asking respondents first about their moral evaluations yielded greater willingness to uses both NTDs and greater moral acceptability for BCIs. The moral assessment of BSDs did not change depending on the question order, pointing to a more stable morality for this NTD, while the willingness to use BSDs for treatment (but not for enhancement) was even higher if asking about morality first. Thus, first thinking about the moral acceptability of a behavior does not necessarily activate concerns that reduce the behavioral willingness, as previously found [41]. If respondents were informed about possible applications of NTDs for treatment (as in our study), they may appraise the technology more positively and express fewer concerns. This needs to be explored further.\nInterindividual differences in attitudes towards NTDs\nOne general observation is that our indicators for a potential need of more respondents for NTDs had no main effects. But the fact that they modulated the assessment of NTDs regarding different use purposes underlines the importance of our more detailed analyses. Respondents who had greater stress gave moral acceptance for both types of NTDs more readily and were more willing to use BSDs and BCIs for enhancement purposes. While this relationship has thus far been investigated only for prescription drugs [29, 42\u201344], BSDs and BCIs might also be seen as instruments to cope with stress and its negative consequences, as well as increase performance and manage stressful demands.\nWe also observed this pattern at lower levels of cognitive functioning, in which NTDs\nmight be perceived as a means to catch up [70] and normalize performance [2]. Indeed, people with lower abilities seem to benefit more from NTDs than people with a higher baseline performance [71, 72]. Surprisingly, at higher levels of cognitive functioning, this pattern was reversed when NTDs were used for treatment purposes. One interpretation of this could be that there is a fear of losing higher functioning and therefore NTDs are accepted and used to retain it. Since more NTDs that may compensate for potential deficits are in development, the expectation and willingness to use them may grow. Moreover, similar to previous research [17, 41], younger individuals showed a higher acceptability (especially regarding BSDs for enhancement) and use willingness of NTDs. Older cohorts may have concerns due to generally slower or missing adoption of technological innovations like NTDs [73], although they could help with age-related decline in functioning. Thus, the results do not support the notions in discourse on the responsibility of using NTDs as instruments to counteract the suffering from age-related diseases [47]. However, younger individuals seem to view neurotechnological means to become better than \u201cnormal\u201d as more justified, which may represent a greater openness to try novel technologies for certain purposes.\nWe observed a stronger disapproval of both NTDs for enhancement purposes among more religious individuals [4, 8, 17]. This might be because religiosity often aligns with \u201ctraditional\u201d worldviews, where the observed effects could occur due to the belief that using NTDs in medically unnecessary situations is \u201cunnatural\u201d and transgresses boundaries created by God [17, 48]. Prior research also shows that concerns towards enhancement, and BCIs in particular, were stronger among religious individuals [17, 65]. Interestingly, the willingness to use NTDs\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 11 / 17\nwas uncorrelated to religiosity, which could indicate double standards. Although against one\u2019s values, NTDs might be used as an end to a mean.\nFinally, our results provide further evidence for gender differences in accepting technology.\nFemale respondents voiced less favorable attitudes towards BCIs, especially for enhancement purposes. This adds to findings suggesting that females are more concerned about technology [8, 17, 41]. Moreover, it may also match gender differences in self-confidence, anxiety, and motivation in using technology that have also been found to influence the acceptance of its use [74\u201376].\nStrengths, limitations, directions for future research\nWe used an experimental approach to test causal hypotheses regarding public attitudes towards two types of neurotechnologies. The multi-stage random selection process of adults increased generalizability. However, our experiments were not without limitations. Questions about moral acceptability and willingness to use NTDs, especially for enhancement purposes, are sensitive and can be subject to bias, but using vignettes has been shown to reduce issues of social desirability [77, 78]. We believe that the low share of \u201cno response\u201d in each variable (<2.5%) and low dropout rates (<0.4%) indicated limited problems with this. Additional analysis also showed that the outcome variables were not affected by anonymity perceptions towards the survey [79] and the effects of the other variables did not change when controlling for anonymity perceptions (S5 to S9 Tables in S1 File).\nStill, the willingness of use measures can be seen as a limitation because of restrictions\n(such as money, time, skills, and opportunity) around voicing a willingness and actual behavior [28, 80]. However, willingness measures and behavior seem to substantially correlate [66, 81] and treatment effects in factorial surveys were comparable to other designs [82].\nAlthough there might still be few users of NTDs, we encourage future research to examine\ndifferences in attitudes of those with personal or vicarious experience with them. Therefore, research on participant groups could offer insights about experienced or expected benefits and problems of NTDs, and the extent to which they may affect the lives of people around NTD users [3, 10]. Given the constantly changing field of NTDs and the potential increased awareness through the media [63], we suggest further observations of public attitudes to evaluate how individuals in- and outside of Germany assess these NTDs, and whether they are aware of and engage in beneficial or harmful uses. Thereby, future studies may compare international samples to examine if views about NTDs differ systematically and, if so, why. Such studies would help understand whether this study\u2019s findings using a representative sample of the adult population in Germany can be generalized to other contexts.\nFinally, while this study relies on survey data collected online, we cannot exclude the possibility that our data are biased towards people who usually interact with basic technology. This can result, for example, in more positive views towards technologies. However, Internet access in Germany is widespread (95% percent of all households, according to Statista 2020 [83]), and our sampling strategy used a multi-stage random process based on an ADM telephone master. Still, to exclude or explicitly examine mode effects, future studies might use other recruitment strategies and survey modes (e.g., mail surveys)."

Although these devices raise ethical challenges related to agency, identity, privacy, equality, normality, and justice [3, 15, 17, 64], systematic knowledge about evaluations of those using, potentially using, or rejecting NTDs is falling behind [10, 41]. Our results suggest that BSD and BCI devices are, for many respondents, not\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275454 November 9, 2022 12 / 17\nthe preferred means to achieve maximum functional enhancement, although the wish to enhance human functioning beyond \u201cnormal\u201d levels is as old as humanity [9].\nWhen medical necessity is lacking, respondents seem to have morally salient concerns\nabout health and positional goods, as well as discomfort about NTDs creating excessive and beyond-normal functioning [33]. Our data therefore provide further evidence that public attitudes are influenced by a therapy-enhancement distinction, and these underlying concerns should be given due consideration in policy-making. Nevertheless, our results also show that a significant share of respondents was strongly accepting of both NTDs. This might be due to the thus far unobserved role of certain respondent characteristics, i.e., respondents who reported high stress levels and low cognitive functioning more readily accepted NTDs for enhancement. These results may signal their need for external helpers and more tolerance towards risky uses (which is difficult to observe when it occurs privately). This higher acceptance may deserve attention when deliberating about informing the public about NTDs and their regulation, since people might take more risks than wanted when dealing with external demands (e.g., from work). Older and more religious individuals were particularly skeptical regarding the use of NTDs, although older individuals especially could benefit from them. While treatment purposes were evaluated with more enthusiasm, especially by respondents with high cognitive functioning (who may wish to preserve their functioning with neurotechnological help), further investigation should examine how realistic those willing to use NTDs in a clinical setting evaluate their capabilities. Our findings that respondents are more reserved towards invasive than noninvasive NTDs serve as evidence that the potential risks of NTDs are not ignored. In sum, our study replicates several existing findings found in other populations or for other NTDs (e.g., stronger preferences for enhancement over treatment, or a preference for non-invasive over invasive NTDs), it also provides novel insights about public views on NTDs (e.g., moral framing effects for treatment purposes or interindividual differences). It is still essential to better understand the social and psychological mechanisms that drive societal norms, with a focus on the effective and ethically justifiable governance of NTDs. This knowledge can help better conceive and anticipate the public acceptance and future trends in the advancements of NTDs. It can help develop education about the nature and consequences of its use; reduce fears, misinformation, and misuse [20, 41]; and advance NTD development that is coherent with the values, priorities, and needs of the public [3, 10]. Our results aim to increase this understanding and suggest possible avenues for exploring the relationships between possible NTDs uses, ethical concerns, and public attitudes related to both."
