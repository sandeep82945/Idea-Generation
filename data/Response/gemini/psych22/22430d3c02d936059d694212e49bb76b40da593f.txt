1. **Investigate the long-term impact of the specialization track on the career paths and professional development of school psychologists.** This could be done through longitudinal studies that follow graduates of the program over time to see how their careers progress and how they use the skills and knowledge they gained in the program.


2. **Examine the effectiveness of the specialization track in preparing school psychologists to work with children with ASD from diverse backgrounds.** This could be done through studies that compare the outcomes of children with ASD who are served by school psychologists who have completed the specialization track to the outcomes of children with ASD who are served by school psychologists who have not completed the specialization track.


3. **Explore the feasibility and effectiveness of replicating the specialization track at other universities and school psychology programs.** This could be done through studies that provide technical assistance and support to other programs that are interested in implementing a similar specialization track.


4. **Investigate the impact of the specialization track on the quality of services provided to children with ASD and their families.** This could be done through studies that examine the satisfaction of families with the services provided by school psychologists who have completed the specialization track and the impact of those services on the children's outcomes.


5. **Develop and evaluate new models for training school psychologists to work with children with ASD.** This could be done through studies that compare the effectiveness of different training models, such as online learning, blended learning, and traditional face-to-face instruction.
