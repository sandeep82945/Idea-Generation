Subsequently, compounds are then progressed into more physiologically relevant but lower throughput ex vivo primary cell assays and finally in vivo studies. Here we describe a dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) assay which has been developed in a format suitable to support medium throughput drug screening in primary human neutrophils. Neutrophils are known to express both CXCR1 and CXCR2 chemokine receptors that are thought to play significant roles in various inflammatory disorders and cancer. Using multiple relevant chemokine ligands and a range of selective and non-selective small and large molecule antagonists that block CXCR1 and CXCR2 responses, we demonstrate distinct pharmacological profiles in neutrophil DMR from those observed in recombinant assays but predictive of activity in neutrophil chemotaxis and CD11b upregulation, a validated target engagement marker previously utilized in clinical studies of CXCR2 antagonists. The primary human neutrophil DMR cell system is highly reproducible, robust, and less prone to donor variability observed in CD11b and chemotaxis assays and thus provides a unique, more physiologically relevant, and higher throughput assay to support drug discovery and translation to early clinical trials.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Both CXCR2 and the closely related receptor CXCR1 are G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs which predominantly signal through inhibitory G proteins to reduce intracellular cAMP. Like many chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2 are activated by multiple circulating chemokines, with CXCR1 activated by CXCL6 and CXCL8, whereas CXCR2 is activated by CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL7 and CXCL8 (Ahuja and Murphy, 1996; Liu et al., 2016). This makes a CXCR2 screening cascade more complex than a single ligand-receptor system, with the ligand promiscuity of chemokine receptors often cited as a reason for the clinical failure of many chemokine targeting therapies (Dyer, 2020).\nAs the most abundant leukocyte in circulation and a key regulator in disease processes, neutrophils are becoming an important pharmacological target (N\u00e9meth et al., 2020). As such, detection of neutrophil activity in clinical studies has become increasingly significant, with CD11b upregulation now established as an important translational marker (Liston et al., 1998; Lazaar et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2015; Namour et al., 2016). CD11b is an integrin, which is upregulated in response to circulating chemoattractants, such as chemokines and complement proteins (Maas et al., 2018). CD11b binds to intracellular adhesion molecules 1 and 2 (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2) to mediate neutrophil adhesion and migration through the endothelium to sites of infection (Maas et al., 2018). CD11b upregulation has been used as a target engagement marker in many clinical trials, including for the CXCR2 small molecule antagonists danirixin and SB656933, where the latter used CD11b data to inform clinical doses (Liston et al., 1998; Lazaar et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2015; Namour et al., 2016). Other common neutrophil assays include\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version. JPET Fast Forward.

While technological advancements have improved the quality of these assays over the years, they are often low throughput and labor intensive, prone to assay variability and highly susceptible to inter-donor variability making them unsuitable for more intensive screening (Gomez-Lopez et al., 2011; Silvestre-Roig et al., 2019).\nDynamic mass redistribution (DMR) assays are a label-free method to measure ligand responses. They are based on two alternative detection methods, namely light refraction or electrical impedance. Light-based methods involve optical biosensors that measure the change in the wavelength of refracted light upon cellular activation, whereas impedance methods measure the change in the impedance of current flow between two electrodes (Fang, 2010; Scott and Peters, 2010). While it is still unknown precisely what these readouts measure, they are thought to provide a holistic view of cellular signaling, detecting more integrated, phenotypic downstream responses, such as changes in cell adhesion or shape (Scott and Peters, 2010; Grundmann and Kostenis, 2015). Although most studies have examined recombinant cells in these systems, the high sensitivity and ability to capture any form of signaling in a label-free setup affords an ideal opportunity for primary cell studies (Grundmann and Kostenis, 2015; Hillger et al., 2017). Moreover, the ability to pick up multiple signaling pathways and modalities makes them potentially superior to standard functional assays which measure a single readout of response.\nThe unique expression of receptor and effector proteins in different cell backgrounds can dramatically change compound activity when transferring from recombinant systems, where primary pharmacology screening usually occurs, to endogenously expressing systems (Eglen et al., 2008). This is particularly true for chemokine receptors, where redundancy is thought be a major contributor to drug failures (Dyer, 2020), and especially for neutrophils which co-express\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Thus, our objective was to establish a DMR assay to measure chemokine activation in primary human neutrophils, and to determine how these results translate from data generated using recombinant cell systems. We also aimed to examine more conventional neutrophil assays (namely, CD11b upregulation and chemotaxis) to validate the DMR assay for higher throughput compound screening in primary cells. There is precedent for measuring GPCR activation in neutrophil DMR assays (Schr\u00f6der et al., 2011; Locker et al., 2015; Christensen et al., 2017; Frei et al., 2020) however to our knowledge, this is the first time a more thorough examination and comparison of multiple functional read-outs for neutrophil chemokine receptors has been undertaken. As CD11b upregulation is a common target engagement marker for neutrophil GPCR drugs, we were keen to establish how results translate from the DMR platform to CD11b, and whether this assay potentially could be used as a screen to help predict activity in a clinical setting. Here, we demonstrate that neutrophil DMR assays are robust and reproducible, generating both chemokine responses and antagonist profiles that are consistent across different neutrophil assay formats, supporting DMR as a high-throughput alternative to CD11b and chemotaxis assays in the screening cascade.\nMaterials and Methods: Materials.

CHO-K1 cells were transfected with a pSNAP vector (NEB; Hitchin, UK) containing the human CXCR1 or CXCR2 receptor using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Merck Millipore; Watford, UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium/Ham\u2019s Nutrient Mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mg ml-1 geneticin for selection. Following 2 weeks of selection, cells were dilution cloned. Clonal CHO CXCR1 and CHO CXCR2 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.2 mg ml-1 geneticin to maintain selection pressure.\ncAMP Assays. CHO CXCR1 and CHO CXCR2 cells were seeded overnight at 2000 and 1200 cells per well respectively in white 384-well plates. On experiment day, media was replaced with assay buffer (Hank\u2019s buffered saline solution (HBSS; Lonza; Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 20mM HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4) in the absence or presence of antagonists, for 1 h at 37oC. Chemokines, in the presence of 1 \u00b5M forskolin, were added and plates further incubated for 5 min. cAMP was detected using cAMP Gi kit (Cisbio; Codolet, France) according to the kit instructions. Plates were read on a PHERAstar FS microplate reader (BMG LabTech; Offenburg, Germany) using standard HTRF settings. HTRF ratios were determined by dividing emissions at 665 nm by emissions at 620 nm and multiplying by 10,000.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Human whole blood from healthy volunteers (Cambridge Bioscience; Cambridge, UK) was mixed 1:1 with 2% dextran in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) to sediment the red blood cells. After 30 min, the supernatant was removed and carefully layered onto 15 ml Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare; Pittsburgh, PA) and centrifuged for 25 min (300g, room temperature (RT), slow acceleration and brake). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in PBS. Contaminating red blood cells were removed by osmotic shock; 20 ml ice-cold distilled water was added for 30 s before neutralization with 20 ml 2x PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 300g) before being resuspended in PBS. Cells were counted with a Haematology Analyzer (Sysmex; Milton Keynes, UK).\nDynamic Mass Redistribution Assays. Ficoll-Dextran isolated cells were resuspended in assay buffer containing 0.4% DMSO and seeded 50,000 neutrophils per well onto uncoated 384- well Epic\u00ae plates (Corning; New York, USA). Cells were left to settle to the bottom of the wells at RT for 2 h. Plates were read using the Corning Epic\u00ae BT System which measures cellular responses as a change in the wavelength of refracted light. First, plates were read for 1 min to establish baseline before pausing the read. Ligands were added slowly and to the top of the volume to avoid disturbing the cells, using a Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent; Santa Clara, CA, USA). The plate was returned to the reader and the read resumed. For antagonist treatments, antagonists were added in the same manner with responses measured to determine the effect of compound alone. They were incubated for 1 h at RT before the addition of chemokine as above. For pertussis toxin (PTx) treatments, neutrophils were incubated with 3 \u03bcg ml-1 PTx for 1 h at 37oC before being plated onto Epic\u00ae plates as above.

Neutrophils were isolated from human whole blood from healthy volunteers by immunomagnetic negative selection using the EasySep Direct Human Neutrophil Isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies; Cambridge, UK) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, EDTA was added to the blood to a final concentration of 1 mM before adding the isolation cocktail and RapidSpheres. After 5 min incubation at RT, the cells were diluted with 1 equal volume of PBS containing 1 mM EDTA and placed into the magnet for 10 min at RT to allow magnetic separation of labelled cells. Further enrichment was undertaken by performing two additional cycles of RapidSpheres addition and separation with the magnet. The final cell suspension was counted with a Haematology Analyzer with expected neutrophil purity > 90%. Cells were centrifuged (5 min, 300g) then resuspended in assay buffer.\nChemotaxis assays. Magnetically isolated neutrophils were loaded with 5 \u00b5M Calcein AM (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37oC before resuspension in assay buffer. 200,000 cells were added to the upper chamber of a HTS 96-transwell chemotaxis plate with a 5 \u00b5m filter (Corning) and incubated for 30 min at 37oC in the presence or absence of antagonist. Following this incubation, chemokine was added to the lower well compartment and the filter plate assembly incubated at 37oC / 5% CO2 for 45 min. The filter was removed and 100 \u00b5l of the lower compartment was transferred to a 96-well black bottom plate (Corning) and the fluorescence determined (excitation: 485 nm emission: 520 nm) using a PHERAstar microplate reader.\nCD11b assays. 50,000 magnetically isolated human neutrophils were pre-incubated with antagonist at 37oC for 30 min before addition of chemokine for 30 min at 37oC.

After staining for 30 min at 4oC, cells were washed twice with ice-cold assay buffer and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (20 min, 4oC). After fixation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and kept in 200 \u00b5l PBS at 4oC in the dark until ready to analyze. CD11b expression was determined using flow cytometry (FACS-Canto II, Becton, Dickinson and Company; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Neutrophil CD11b expression was measured using the geometric mean of FITC fluorescence intensity on CD15-positive and CD16-positive granular cells with high forward and side-scatter properties; 2,000 positive events were counted per sample.\nData Analysis. DMR data were analyzed using Corning EpicAnalyzer software. Raw DMR traces were corrected by removal of background responses and the peak response between 3-7 min (neutrophil), or 5-12 min (CHO CXCR1 and CXCR2) extracted. All data were plotted in GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA, USA) using 4 parameter logistic equation. Statistical analyses were also conducted with GraphPad Prism.\nResults: Profiling of chemokines and antagonists in CHO CXCR1 and CHO CXCR2 cAMP and\nDMR assays.\nFirst, we profiled a range of chemokines and antagonists reported to be selective for CXCR1 and CXCR2 in CHO CXCR1 and CXCR2 cAMP and DMR assays to understand their potencies and selectivity profiles in a recombinant expression system. As a G\u03b1i-coupled receptor, inhibition of cAMP is the primary signaling endpoint for CXCR1 and CXCR2, so we wanted to investigate how this compared to a DMR readout.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

At CXCR1, all ligands acted as full agonists to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP, except for CXCL1, which was a partial agonist (Emax 81 \u00b1 6%) and CXCL2, which was inactive (Table 1, Figure 1B). Between the two receptors, there were large potency differences for many of the chemokines tested, which is reflective of their reported variations in selectivity for CXCR2.\nIn the DMR assay, chemokines induced concentration dependent positive deflections in both CHO CXCR2 (Figure 1C) and CHO CXCR1 (Figure 1D) cells, which peaked around 5 minutes after compound addition. Peak responses were extracted for both receptors (Figure 1E, F), with CXCR2 results appearing broadly consistent with the results of the cAMP assay (Table 1). However, there was a trend for reduced agonist potencies in this assay relative to the inhibition of cAMP, and CXCL2 was also identified as a partial agonist. This is likely due to the increased signal amplification of the cAMP signal, leading to increased agonist potencies (Stott et al., 2016). However, the correlation in potencies between both assay formats for CXCR2 was poor (R2 = 0.27; Figure 1G), though this is potentially due to the low spread in potency values across ligands at this target, and the higher variability in the DMR responses. For CXCR1, the DMR readout revealed the partiality of most of the chemokines at this target, with only the two CXCL8 proteoforms showing full agonism (Figure 1F, Table 1). Unlike CXCR2, there was an excellent correlation in potencies for CXCR1 between the two assay formats (R2 = 0.92; Figure 1H) as well as a trend for increased potencies in DMR relative to cAMP, opposite to what was observed for CXCR2.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Due to the weak activity of CXCL1 at CXCR1, we could not determine the activity of the antagonists for this receptor-ligand pair. All the small molecules tested were able to fully inhibit CXCR2 responses elicited by both CXCL8 and CXCL1, except for reparixin which was inactive and NVP CXCR2 20, which partially inhibited the CXCR2 responses (Figure 2A, B, Table 2). Reparixin is described as a high affinity antagonist of both CXCR1 and CXCR2 (Bertini et al., 2004) so this inactivity was surprising. We cannot yet explain this contradictory observation; we tested multiple sources of the compound and QC analysis by UV and mass spectrometry (data not shown) did not highlight any issues with the compound stock. There were no significant differences in the potencies of the small molecules to inhibit CXCR2 signaling induced by CXCL1 or CXCL8 (P > 0.05; Unpaired t-test), but all ligands were significantly less potent at inhibiting CXCL8 signaling at CXCR1 when compared to CXCR2 (P < 0.05; Unpaired t-test, Figure 2C, Table 2). We also examined two previously described CXCR2 specific nanobodies (Bradley et al., 2015). These nanobodies have been shown to either bind the CXCR2 N-terminus (clone 127D1), generating a potent, partial antagonist, or the extracellular loop (clone 163E3), generating a less potent but full antagonist (Bradley et al., 2015). In our hands, both nanobodies behaved as full antagonists and unlike the original report, 127D1 and 163E3 were equipotent at inhibiting both CXCL1 and CXCL8 responses (Table 2). These nanobodies have been shown not to bind CXCR1 (Bradley et al., 2015). When these antagonists were tested in the DMR assay, all ligands except reparixin and AZ 10397767 fully inhibited chemokine responses and the same rank order of pIC50 values was obtained (Figure 2D-F, Table 3) and there was a good\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

However, this assay had a much smaller assay window and much greater variability than the cAMP format, which limited compound testing.\nChemokines generate robust and reproducible DMR responses which are specific to CXCR1 and CXCR2 in isolated neutrophils. We then looked to characterize the chemokine and antagonist responses in the neutrophil DMR assay. While there is some evidence for CXCL8-induced neutrophil DMR responses (Locker et al., 2015), this is the first time a more detailed assessment of chemokine responses in this assay, and how they compare to other neutrophil assays, has been undertaken. Upon addition of chemokine, neutrophils demonstrated a large and rapid concentration-dependent positive deflection which peaked within 4 minutes of treatment (Figure 3A-C), which was much larger in size than the CHO CXCR1 or CHO CXCR2 DMR assays (Figure 1C,D). All chemokines displayed very similar kinetic traces, despite the differing levels of selectivity for CXCR2 over CXCR1 (Table 1). Peak responses were extracted, and data pooled (Figure 3D-E) with chemokine potencies and maximal responses described in Table 4. Despite the known issues of reproducibility in primary cell assays, ligand potencies were very consistent over multiple donors, although absolute response magnitude varied; for example, 30 nM CXCL8 responses ranged from ~700 \u2013 1200 \u0394pm between donors, but intraassay variability was generally less than 10% (Supplemental Figure 1) and much lower than that previously reported for formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) responses in the same assay (Christensen et al., 2017).\nWe then compared the chemokine potencies in neutrophil DMR with those from CHO CXCR2 cAMP and observed a good correlation between the two assays (R2 = 0.63, P < 0.01; Figure 3F). However, the correlation between CHO CXCR2 DMR and neutrophil DMR was\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version. JPET Fast Forward.

Compared to the neutrophil DMR, the CHO CXCR2 DMR had a much lower signal (~100pm vs ~1000pm) and much greater variability. This could be reflective of different cellular processes within the different cell backgrounds upon CXCR2 activation, which could explain these results. When the neutrophil DMR potencies were compared with the CHO CXCR1 cAMP results, there was no correlation (R2 = 0.00; data not shown), likely due to the selectivity of most chemokines for CXCR2.\nAs DMR likely represents a holistic cellular response, we wanted to investigate whether the chemokine responses measured in neutrophils were dependent on G\u03b1i activation using PTx to inactivate the G\u03b1i protein. However, neutrophils are short lived cells which usually only survive for less than 24 h in the bloodstream (McCracken and Allen, 2014); this prohibited the usual overnight PTx treatment regime. Instead, we used a modified protocol from Christensen et al., 2017 whereby we treated neutrophils for 1 h with a high PTx concentration (3 \u03bcg ml-1) and\nincluded fMLF as a positive control to replicate that study. However, this treatment only inhibited responses by around 20% (Supplemental Figure 2) unlike the original study, which could inhibit responses by around 70%. In both cases, this suggests that there is some involvement of G\u03b1i in the neutrophil DMR responses, but it likely needs a longer treatment time to fully inactivate the G\u03b1i proteins which is challenging to do with such short lived cells.\nAs neutrophils express several GPCRs, we wanted to confirm that the responses detected were specific to CXCR1 and CXCR2. The chemokines show differing levels of selectivity for CXCR1 and CXCR2, therefore we examined antagonism of both CXCL1 and CXCL8 as CXCR2selective and non-selective chemokines respectively. It is noteworthy that most of the small molecules studied, except for the inactive reparixin, induced a small, negative deflection following compound treatment alone (Figure 4A-C). This could be indicative of inverse\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version. JPET Fast Forward.

It has been demonstrated previously in DMR assays (Scott and Peters, 2010) and inverse agonism has been reported for both small molecule and nanobody CXCR2 antagonists (Bradley et al., 2009, 2015) but only in recombinant systems thus far. However, the scale of this response (~40 \u0394pm) is dwarfed by the response elicited by the chemokines themselves. These negative deflections were not observed in the CHO CXCR1 or CXCR2 DMR assays, suggesting the presence of constitutively active receptors in neutrophils that were not detected recombinantly. However, this could be due to the relative size responses between cell types; the assay signal in the recombinant system may not have been large enough to detect the constitutive activity. Notably, the nanobody 127D1 displayed a significant response when tested alone at concentrations of 3 nM and greater, suggesting either agonism or non-specific responses at these higher concentrations. This effect was not observed for 163E3, suggesting it was not a general non-specific effect to nanobody treatment (Figure 4D-E). These concentrations were excluded from further analysis. These agonist-like responses were also not observed in the CHO CXCR2 cells, and could be due to offtarget effects specific to neutrophils. This further emphasizes the need for primary cell screening in the target cell type.\nAll the small molecules examined inhibited both CXCL1 and CXCL8 induced DMR responses in a concentration-dependent manner, except for reparixin which was inactive, in line with the recombinant data. When the CXCR2 nanobodies were examined, they showed significant inhibition of the CXCL1 response but unlike the recombinant assay data, 127D1 was 10-fold more potent than 163E3 and demonstrated partial antagonism. This is consistent with a previous report of the nanobody pharmacology (Bradley et al., 2015). However, when they were tested against CXCL8, they failed to significantly inhibit responses and potencies could not be derived\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

When the pIC50 values for CXCR1 inhibition were compared between the neutrophil DMR assay and the CHO CXCR2 cAMP or DMR assays, there was an excellent correlation (R2 = 0.73-0.74; Figure 5G, H). In contrast, the correlation for CXCL8 inhibition between neutrophil DMR and recombinant assays was lower for the DMR assay (R2 = 0.65) and failed to reach significance for the cAMP assay (R2 = 0.46; P = 0.06) (Figure 5I, J). CXCL1 displays one of the highest selectivities for CXCR2 (Table 1) so it is highly probable that at EC80 concentration, only CXCR2 receptors are being activated, whereas CXCL8 will activate both CXCR1 and CXCR2. The reduced correlation for CXCL8 is likely indicative of two receptors signaling in neutrophils, compared to the single receptor system measured in the CHO CXCR1 and CXCR2 cell lines.\nNeutrophil DMR assays are sensitive to different antagonist modalities. Next, we wanted to explore whether this assay was sensitive enough to pick up different antagonist modalities by performing Schild analysis using the CXCR2 nanobodies which have been described as noncompetitive (127D1) or competitive (163E3) (Bradley et al., 2015). We also compared these to AZD-5069, a slowly dissociating reversible small molecule antagonist (Nicholls et al., 2015) which may bind to an intracellular binding site previously identified for other CXCR2 small molecules (Bradley et al., 2009; Salchow et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2020). As shown in Figure 6, all antagonists generated different profiles at CXCL1 which were broadly consistent with their reported pharmacological profiles. The N-terminal binder 127D1 acted as a negative allosteric modulator (NAM), where increasing concentrations of antagonist could no longer compete with the agonist due to co-operativity, leading to characteristic \u2018stacking\u2019 of the agonist curves (Figure 6A). However, the reported competitive binder 163E3 caused a decrease in the maximal response and did not show the competitive antagonist profile previously reported (Figure 6B).\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

This contrasts with the responses observed at CXCL8, where only AZD-5069 and 300 nM 163E3 showed any significant inhibition of the CXCL8 response (Figure 6D-F). Furthermore, unlike the CXCL1 inhibition, AZD-5069 failed to fully inhibit CXCL8 responses at 1 \u00b5M and much higher concentrations of compound are required to fully block the signaling of this chemokine (Figure 6C, F). As none of these antagonists show competitive profiles, we could not determine a pA2 for any of the compounds.\nNeutrophil DMR assays yield comparable results to traditional CD11b and chemotaxis assays. We have demonstrated that a DMR approach can be successfully applied to neutrophils to investigate chemokine pharmacology and provide robust and reproducible data. Given the holistic nature of the DMR signal, we aimed to confirm our observations in well-established assays. To support this, we assessed the upregulation of the CD11b integrin by flow cytometry, a standard read-out validated as a target engagement marker in neutrophils (Liston et al., 1998; Lazaar et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2015; Namour et al., 2016) and we used the low throughput, but more mechanistic, in vitro chemotaxis assay. All chemokines examined induced concentrationdependent upregulation of CD11b with results broadly complimenting those from the DMR assay (Figure 7A, B, Table 6), however, in contrast to the DMR assay, both the CD11b and chemotaxis assays show much greater donor to donor variability (Supplemental Figure 3). This variability for the chemotaxis assays particularly meant we could test less antagonists in this assay. It also precluded the determination of an EC80 and prohibited standard IC50 determination in this assay format. A further advantage of the DMR assay is the lack of \u2018bell-shaped\u2019 response which is characteristic of the chemotaxis assay.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

However, AZD-5069 was the only antagonist to inhibit CXCL8 responses in the CD11b assay (Figure 7D), and its potency was 69-fold lower at 6.53 \u00b1 0.10. This is consistent with the DMR data and further supports that both CXCR1 and CXCR2 are involved in neutrophil chemokine responses. We also wanted to reproduce the Schild neutrophil DMR experiments to determine whether the non-competitive profiles of the antagonists tested would also be mirrored in both CD11b and chemotaxis assays.\nWhile the lower throughput of the chemotaxis prevented us from testing a wider range of antagonist concentrations, both assay formats agreed with the NAM profile of 127D1 and the reduction in maximal response with 163E3 when tested against CXCL1 responses (Figure 7EH). In contrast, neither nanobody could block CXCL8 responses in either the CD11b or chemotaxis assays (Figure 7I-L). Furthermore, AZD-5069 demonstrated inhibitory profiles consistent with the DMR responses in CD11b, with non-competitive inhibition of CXCL1 and increased concentrations of AZD-5 (Figure 7M, N).\nNeutrophil DMR assays can be applied to a range of GPCRs. Finally, following the success of neutrophil DMR assays for detecting CXCR1 and CXCR2 responses, we investigated the application of the assay to other GPCRs expressed by neutrophils. As FPR1 responses in neutrophil DMR assays have previously been characterized (Christensen et al., 2017), the FPR1 agonist fMLF was chosen as a positive control. A range of ligands were then tested, including those of classical neutrophil chemoattractant receptors such as the formyl peptide receptors (FPR1, FPR2 and FPR3), leukotriene B4 receptors (BLT1 and BLT2), platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor and complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1), as well as other GPCRs that\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

All ligands exhibited a rapid initial peak within a few minutes of compound addition, similar to that observed with the CXCR1/CXCR2 chemokines, with some ligands, such as leukotriene B4, showing a later secondary peak (Figure 8B), although for the purposes of analysis only the first peak was quantified. FPR responses were the largest in terms of wavelength change, with responses to both FPR1 and FPR2 selective ligands detected. As with the chemokine DMR studies, these assays demonstrated excellent signal to background (274 \u00b1 123) and Z\u2019 (0.73 \u00b1 0.03) when fMLF was used a positive control. Reassuringly, the potencies determined here for fMLF and CXCL8 match published results for neutrophil DMR (Locker et al., 2015; Christensen et al., 2017), further demonstrating the reproducibility of this assay across multiple laboratories.\nDiscussion: Here, we aimed to profile CXCR1 and CXCR2 responses in primary human neutrophils and validate neutrophil DMR as a higher throughput screening assay which could be used as an alternative to more conventional neutrophil functional assays, such as CD11b upregulation or chemotaxis for compound characterization. Neutrophils are of interest as a drug target for many indications (Bartneck and Wang, 2019; Cheng et al., 2019; N\u00e9meth et al., 2020) so there is a need for higher throughput screening assays to determine compound activity at this cell type.

In neutrophils, the co-expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 can lead to poor translation of compound effect across cell systems, with ligands which appear efficacious in cells over-expressing one receptor, losing either potency or efficacy, or both, for the inhibition of cross-reactive ligands. This was clearly demonstrated by the loss of CXCL8 inhibition in neutrophils by the CXCR2 specific nanobodies across all the neutrophil assay formats investigated, which was not observed nor predicted from the CHO CXCR1 or CHO CXCR2 assays. Likewise, the significant increase in the concentrations of AZD-5069 required to inhibit neutrophil CXCL8 responses relative to CXCL1, despite having equal potency to inhibit both chemokines when tested in CHO CXCR2 cells, shows that this loss of translation is not just restricted to CXCR2 specific nanobodies. This was further highlighted by the reduced correlation for the antagonists between the recombinant data for the CXCL8-CXCR2 combination and neutrophil data, relative to CXCL1-CXCR2. This is likely due to the coactivation of CXCR1 by CXCL8, reducing the ability of the antagonists to fully block the chemokine signaling, due to the receptor redundancy in neutrophils allowing both CXCR1 and CXCR2 to signal. This further highlights the importance of the availability of a robust neutrophil screening assay.\nBlockade of the CXCL8-CXCR2 interaction is postulated to be an effective strategy for cancer therapeutics given the wealth of evidence that CXCL8 drives tumor growth through immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and metastasis (David et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016). The lack of CXCL8 inhibition by CXCR2 specific inhibitors in neutrophils, despite good inhibition in CHO CXCR2 assays, highlights the importance of testing ligands in disease-relevant primary cells. It also highlights that CXCR2 selective compounds may not be the most effective strategy for blocking CXCL8 signaling clinically, and that dual blockade of CXCR1 and CXCR2 could\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

This aspect has been particularly difficult to test in vivo as mice do not express a CXCL8 equivalent (David et al., 2016). While there are concerns that a dual blockade of CXCR1 and CXCR2 could lead to neutropenia, there is evidence that in inflammatory conditions, where excessive immune cell infiltration is a key driver of disease, that this dual blockade could be beneficial (Mattos et al., 2020). A recent report describing a CXCR2 antibody which fully blocks CXCL8-mediated chemotaxis in neutrophils (Shi et al., 2021) does suggest CXCR2 specific inhibitors could be efficacious in this respect, however, is likely that these inhibitors would require very specific receptor interactions. This is exemplified by the reported antibody possessing an almost overlapping epitope compared to the 127D1 nanobody (residues 13-16 for Shi et al and 11, 14 and 15 for Bradley et al (Bradley et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2021)) and agrees with studies which have demonstrated that a CXCR2 specific antibody is insufficient alone to inhibit higher concentrations of CXCL8 (Wu et al., 1996). As neutrophils express numerous structurally related GPCRs, for example, multiple formyl peptide receptors and leukotriene B4 receptors (Futosi et al., 2013b), it may be envisaged that these receptors may also suffer from issues in translation from recombinant screening systems to in vivo biology, where neutrophil screening assays could help to de-risk this.\nWhile this study has concentrated on neutrophil responses, chemokine receptors are known to be expressed in different types of tumor cells, where they can modulate cell invasion, migration and metastasis (Liu et al., 2019; Shang and Li, 2019). As a label-free technique, DMR can be used across a variety of cell types, including cancer cells (Du et al., 2009; Harris et al., 2017). While the effect of chemokines has not been looked at in cancer cells specifically, it could be interesting to understand whether this lack of translation for CXCR1/2 antagonists through from recombinant to native expressing cells is true of cancer cells as well as neutrophils.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

However, there is a need to balance cell accessibility and assay reproducibility against throughput. High content screening in particular can be time consuming, both in terms of the image acquisition and subsequent analysis (Lin et al., 2020). We believe DMR assays provide an important avenue to allow a medium throughput level of screening and, particularly when used with isolated blood cells, provide an easily accessible and reliable primary cell screen. The consistency of the antagonist profiles and level of inhibition across the different neutrophil assays gives us confidence that the DMR assay is predictive of CD11b and chemotaxis responses, both assays which are thought to be more mechanistically linked to disease pathologies but generally suffer from low throughput and variability. Furthermore, the ability to detect a wide range of GPCR responses exemplifies the utility of this assay beyond the chemokine receptors initially profiled. As CD11b upregulation has been used as a target engagement marker in clinical studies of FFA2, BLT1 and C5aR1 ligands (Liston et al., 1998; Bekker et al., 2016; Namour et al., 2016), profiling ligands in the DMR assay could allow higher throughput compound characterization in an assay platform which may provide increased confidence of success through to the clinic.\nFinally, despite the current dogma that only CXCL6 and CXCL8 are ligands for CXCR1 (Ahuja and Murphy, 1996; Liu et al., 2016), the data generated here show that all the chemokines studied will activate CXCR1 at the concentrations examined, except for CXCL2 which was CXCR2 specific at up 200 nM. However, all chemokines were selective for CXCR2, except for the CXCL8 proteoforms which were equipotent across both receptors. Interestingly, a\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

The correlation with CD11b upregulation assays is of particular significance given their prevalence as target engagement marker in early clinical studies; this translation gives confidence that a compound will maintain its activity in vivo and thereby increase the likelihood of progressing to the clinic. DMR assays are robust, reproducible, yield high quality data that is compatible with industry screening standards and are predictive of activity in other neutrophil assays. We have demonstrated that these neutrophil DMR assays are highly effective in supporting the study of the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 and that these assays could be more broadly applied to other GPCRs expressed on neutrophils."
