The XSW induced modulations in the core level (CL) and VB photoemission from the surface and substrate atoms were monitored for three hkl substrate Bragg reflections. The XSW CL analysis shows the Pt to have an fcc-like cube-on-cube epitaxy with the substrate. The XSW VB information compares well to a density functional theory calculated projected density of states from the surface and substrate atoms. Overall, this work represents a novel method for determining the contribution to the density of states by valence electrons from specific atomic surface sites.\nPACS numbers: 68.49.Uv, 68.47.Jn, 73.20.-r, 79.60.-i\nNoble metal/oxide interfaces have important applications in both chemical and physical processes. Dramatic catalytic enhancement is found for low-coverage noble metals supported on oxide surfaces.[1\u20134] Pt on SrTiO3 is one such case with importance to water-splitting photocatalysis.[1, 3] The Pt/SrTiO3 interface is also under consideration in thin film electronics for use in resistive random access memory devices.[5] As Pt layers are reduced down to several atomic layers in nanocrystals a larger fraction of the Pt atoms are at the interface which strongly influences catalytic properties.[6] For the Pt/support interface Pt atoms can interact with the TiO2 support surface and withdraw electrons.[7, 8] During a gas catalysis process, the pathway of the catalyzed reaction is governed by the atomic and electronic structures of the catalyst and the interface of catalyst/support.[9] While much research focuses on the Pt catalyst application, there are still open questions over the atomic and electronic properties, especially at the catalyst/support interface.\nAs a support for Pt, SrTiO3 (STO) has a special morphological preference, since its cubic-P unit cell lattice constant (aSTO = 3.905 A\u030a) is a close match to that of the face-centered-cubic (fcc) Pt lattice (aPt = 3.924 A\u030a); and thus beneficial for obtaining an epitaxial interface. In previous work, fcc Pt nanocrystals on a STO (001) support were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE ) and x-ray standing wave (XSW) excited Pt L\u03b1 x-ray fluorescence (XRF) was used to find the different interfacial structures dependent on the Pt submonolayer coverage.[10] Using density functional theory, Stoltz et al. found different binding energies for the Pt atoms that adsorb above the surface Ti and O atoms of the STO support.[11] However, the electronic\nstructure in such classical heterostructures has not previously been described, but would provide a clearer structure-function relationship.\nFor the surface of a crystal, XSW analysis is advantageous for determining atomic positions of a particular surface atomic species relative to the substrate lattice.[12\u201314] The collection of XSW excited fluorescence[10, 12, 15] or photoelectrons[16\u201318] from electronic core levels has previously been used for determining specific atomic adsorption sites.\nThe valence electronic structure dictates the chemical and physical characteristics of a supported catalyst that lead to the formation and breaking of chemical bonds during a reaction.[19] While density functional theory (DFT) can be used to calculate the projected density of states from particular atoms at particular sites within the substrate or at the interface,[20, 21] conventional valence band (VB) photoemission does not directly provide such structural discrimination. Previously, XSW excited VB spectroscopy has been used to study site-specific valence band properties for atoms within a bulk crystal.[22\u201326] Herein, we apply this XSW-VB method to the novel study of atoms on a surface. To increase sensitivity we chose a high-Z element, namely submonolayer Pt on STO (001). We find that XSW excited VB spectroscopy has site specific information from these surface atoms that compares well with DFT predictions.\nThe Pt submonolayer was grown on 1\u00d71 TiO2 terminated STO (001) surface by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). X-ray fluorescence with comparison to a calibrated standard was used to determine that the Pt coverage was 1\u20442 ML of a Pt (001) fcc layer (i.e., coverage = 6.5 Pt/nm2). At the Diamond Light Source\n2\nI09 station back reflection XSW-XPS[13] was performed for three different Bragg reflections: 002, 101, 111 of the STO (001) crystal. These three hkls were chosen to enable triangulation of the Pt atomic positions relative to the STO lattice and to distinguish the VB contributions from each of the four elements. Pt 4f , Ti 2p, Sr 3d and O 1s core level (CL) spectra and VB spectra were collected while scanning the incident photon energy (E\u03b3) through each hkl Bragg reflection. The XSW induced modulations in the CL and VB photoelectron yields are shown in Fig. 1. (See Supplemental Material [27] for details.)\nFor each H = hkl Bragg reflection, Fig. 1 shows the CL data fitted yield curves based on dynamical diffraction theory:[13, 14, 40, 41]\nR(E\u03b3) and \u03bd(E\u03b3) respectively denote the reflectivity and XSW phase. Parameters fH and PH are the normalized amplitude and phase of the Hth Fourier component of the distribution of atoms being monitored by the spectrometer with elemental or even chemical-state specificity. SR, |SI | and \u03c8, which are corrections for small non-dipolar effects in the photoelectric cross-section, are tabulated in Supplemental Material [27]. For our analysis we selected the origin of the STO cubic unit cell to be at the Sr site, which consequently is then the origin for each PH scale. The Eq. 1 fit-determined fH and PH values for Pt 4f are listed in Supplemental Material [27]. The fitted results for the substrate atoms follow the ideal perovskite structure of SrTiO3. The summation of these XSW-XPS measured Fourier components and their symmetry equivalents generates a model-independent 3D map of the Pt atomic distribution:[10, 15, 42, 43]\n\u03c1(r) = 1 + 2 \u2211\nH6=\u2212H,H6=0\nfHcos[2\u03c0(PH \u2212H \u00b7 r)]. (2)\nThe 3D map is a projection of the Pt atomic distribution from the x-ray footprint (\u223c0.1 mm2) into a single STO cubic unit cell, which leads to fourfold and mirror symmetry along the c-axis of the STO (001) surface. The generated 3D map of the Pt atomic distribution referenced to the STO lattice is shown in Fig. 2(a), where it can be seen that the Pt atoms form an fcc-like lattice registered to the STO lattice with a vertical shift. Based on the same domain averaging symmetry conditions described above, there are three symmetry inequivalent Pt sites in this arrangement; labeled A, B, and C. Note C1 and C2 are symmetry equivalent. The mean z displacements of Pt at the A, B or C1(C2) site as a fraction of aSTO relative to the bulk-like SrO plane are listed in Table II.\nTo determine the occupation fraction, \u03b1, of correlated Pt in the A, B, and combined C sites, an fcc-like Pt model with two atomic layers is assumed based on the\npreviously described XSW model-independent analysis portrayed in Fig. 2(a). Here the correlated Pt atoms are laterally constrained to occupy one of the A, B or C sites. The values z and \u03b1 are determined from a global least squares fit of a model to the measured complex Fourier components as follows:[10, 15]\nFH =fHe 2\u03c0iPH = e\n\u22122( \u03c0\u03c3dH ) 2 [\u03b1Ae 2\u03c0iH\u00b7rA\n+ \u03b1Be 2\u03c0iH\u00b7rB + \u03b1C(e 2\u03c0iH\u00b7rC1 + e2\u03c0iH\u00b7rC2)]. (3)\nHere, rA = (0, 0, zA), rB = (1\u20442, 1\u20442, zB), rC1 = (1\u20442, 0, zC), rC2 = (0, 1\u20442, zC) are unit cell fractional positions of the A, B and C sites, respectively. C1 and C2 are symmetry equivalent. dH is the STO d-spacing. The XSW measured fH and PH values are taken from Table I. The best-fit results, assuming a Pt atomic spread of \u03c3=0.2 A\u030a in the Debye-Waller factor, are summarized in Table II. The ratio of occupation fraction \u03b1A : \u03b1B : \u03b1C = 1: 2: 3 is notably different from the ratio of ideal fcc\nPt lattice which would be 1: 1: 2; consistent with the C site being the bottom and therefore most populated layer. Summing all the occupation fractions at the three sites gives the fraction of correlated Pt atoms to be 0.61; meaning that 39% of the Pt are uncorrelated with the STO lattice.\nThe off-Bragg VB spectra shown at the bottoms of Fig. 1 (right-side) are shown with better detail in Fig. 2(b) to 2(d). These were collected on the low-photonenergy side of the Bragg peak at E\u03b3 \u2212 EB = -1.1 eV. To decompose these VB spectra into sub-spectra from the four atoms we use an approach similar to that used for an XSW-VB study of bulk STO (001)[24], but now extended to include surface atoms. While this site-specific VB description is a direct outcome from DFT as illustrated for our case in Fig. 2(e), it cannot be determined from standard VB spectroscopy. Referring to Fig. 1, we experimentally determine the site by observing which features in the VB fluctuate when the XSW antinode (or node) passes over a given bulk or surface atomic layer. This relies on Woiciks earlier finding that even though the valence electrons are spatially spread out from the atomic center, their photoelectric cross-section is highly localized at the atomic center.[44] To get around the ambiguity of multiple atom types positionally overlapping in a given hkl direction, we chose a set of hkl reflections that have differing combinations of overlapping atom types. This sorting strategy is demonstrated in Fig. 1 (left-side),\n4 which show the Eq. 1 fitted XSW modulations of Pt 4f , Sr 3d, Ti 2p and O 1s core level yields for the incident energy scans through the STO 002, 101 and 111 reflections. For the 002 all three bulk atom types overlap with each other, but not with the Pt atoms. This can be seen from the phases (or P 002 values) of the four modulations in Fig. 1(a) and can be understood from the ball-and-stick diagrams of Fig. 2(a), which show respectively the bulk atomic positions at P 002 = 0 coinciding with the (002) planes and the inward shift of the Pt atoms from these same planes at P 002 = -0.16. For the 101 XSW scan of Fig. 1(b) we see that the Ti and Sr bulk atoms are in phase with each other at P 101 = 0 and out of phase with the bulk O atoms at P101 = 1\u20442. From Table I we see that P 101 = 0.76 for the Pt atoms. We then use the 111 to put the Sr and O in phase with each other and out-of-phase with the Ti and Pt as seen in Fig. 1(c). The 2D plots on the right-side of Fig. 1 are the VB spectra from -1 to 10 eV in binding energy collected at each incident photon energy step of the XSW scan with a range matching that of the left-side CL XSW scans.\nEach binding energy (BE) point in the VB spectra (Fig. 1 right-side) is dependent on E\u03b3 because the four atoms can have different \u2206d/d diffraction plane positions. Due to the previously explained localized nature of the photoelectric effect, each atomic VB subspectrum has an XSW induced modulation that follows the CL yield for that atom as shown in Fig. 1 left-side. As detailed in the SI this relation is formalized with a matrix equation for each of the 251 binding energy (BEi) points in each VB spectrum. The solutions to these overdetermined sets of equations for each of three hkl reflections leads to the decomposition of the off-Bragg VB spectrum into sub-spectra for each constituent element as shown in Fig. 2(b) to (d). For each element, the three VB sub-spectra from the three hkl reflections differ by a scale-factor that is due to differences in the experimental conditions, namely incident photon energy, incident intensity, sample-detector geometry[45], and photoelectric cross-sections. We were able to create an all-inclusive set of simultaneous equations by normalizing for these differences, which led to a solution with higher fidelity.\nTo compare with the XSW-XPS results, DFT calculations were carried out for the projected densities of states (PDOS) of each element using the Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulations with Thousands of Atoms (SIESTA) code. The 3D model generated from the XSW-CL photoemission analysis was used to construct an atomistic super cell. The PDOS were computed using the conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm, with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and a broadening of 0.4 eV. The PDOS of each element as a summation of its valence electronic states is shown in\nFig. 2(e). In Fig. 3 we compare the DFT calculations to\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nIn te\nns ity\n[c ps\n]\n(a) Pt\nexp cal 6s 5d 4f\n0\n5\n10\nIn te\nns ity\n[c ps\n]\n(b) Sr exp cal 5s 4p 5p\n0\n5\n10\n15\nIn te\nns ity\n[c ps\n]\n(c) Ti exp cal 4s 3p 3d\n0246810 Binding Energy [eV]\n0\n5 1 In te ns ity [c\nps ]\n(d) O exp cal 2s 2p\nFIG. 3.

Note that the sum of all four experimental sub-spectra is equivalent to the spectrum labeled Sum in Fig. 2(d).\nthe experimental results by converting each orbital PDOS to photoelectron yield. (See Supplemental Material [27].) Here the photoelectric effect cross section ratios are corrected because the solid-state VB is significantly underestimated by the tabulated atomic cross section.[23, 24] The Pt sub-spectrum in Fig. 3(a) has mainly Pt 5d states and 4f states located near the Fermi level. Note that the DFT calculated Pt sub-spectrum corresponds to correlated Pt as depicted in Fig. 2(a), whereas the measured Pt VB sub-spectrum has a 39% contribution from uncorrelated Pt atoms. Given this factor, the difference between calculated and experimental yields is reasonable. The calculated Sr yield in Fig. 3(b) reproduce the experimental yield through 5s, polarized 5p and semicore 4p states. We note a peak shift close to 1 eV, Fig. 3(b), likely due to an inherent shift already present in the original SIESTA\n5 pseudopotential (free of semicore states). The calculated Ti yield in Fig. 3(c) includes 3d and 4s states and the Ti 3p semicore was introduced to create the features at 4 - 7 eV. The calculated O yield Fig. 3(d) perfectly reproduces the experimental yield with a majority of O 2p state. The features of Sr, Ti and O follow the previous XSW-VB results for bulk STO.[24]\nCompared with the valence band spectrum of bulk metallic Pt,[46] our measurement in Fig. 3(a) is missing a strong peak right at the Fermi edge, which could correspond to a reduction of electronic states due to the orbital hybridization of Pt 4f with O atoms. DFT was used to study this effect by comparing to a model with Pt atoms at C-sites only (Fig. 2(a)) located atop of O atoms without the top Pt layer (A and B sites). Here the Pt 4f states at the Fermi level is reduced to zero (See Supplemental Material [27]). A round shoulder, rather than a peak, at the Fermi edge for the Pt sub-spectrum further confirms the Pt-Pt bond in Pt monolayer and Pt-O bond at the Pt/SrTiO3 interface.\nIn summary, the 3D atomic distribution of 1/2 ML Pt on the SrTiO3 (001) surface was measured from the XSW excited core level Pt 4f yields for three hkl Bragg reflections. This provided a model for a density functional theory calculation that was used to interpret the XSW site-specific valence band measurements. The XSW-XPS core level yields of Pt 4f , Sr 3d, Ti 2p and O 1s make it possible to separate out the Pt, Sr, Ti and O contributions to the valence-band spectrum. It is presently possible to make such measurements for monolayer coverages of high-Z surface atoms like Pt with 3rd generation synchrotron x-ray sources. The predicted 500-fold gain in brightness from the next generation of x-ray sources should make it possible to apply this method to lower-Z surface atoms, including 2D van der Waals heterostructures with interesting quantum properties.[47]"
