To achieve this envisioned dream, Pakistan\nestablished the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority (CPECA) to further its\ncompletion, but Covid-19 slowed it down. This situation compelled the digitalization of\nCPEC. This article reviews the best practices and success stories of various digitalization\nand e-governance programs and, in this light, advises the implementation of the Ajman\nDigital Governance (ADG) model as a theoretical framework for CPEC digitalization. This\narticle concludes that the Pakistani government needs to transform CPEC digitalization\nby setting up the CPEC Digitalization and Transformation Center (DTC) at the CPECA\noffice to attract more investors and businesses.\nKeywords: CPEC, digitalization, E-governance, Ajman Digital Government, cloud-computing\nINTRODUCTION\nTransformation is smooth only if it starts from inside an organization. Policymakers worldwide are trying to address the immediate economic challenges of Covid-19 by capturing the opportunity for long economic recovery through digitalization. In addition, countries including Pakistan should not wait too long to achieve their digitalization goals. Instead of the unavailability of state-owned infrastructure, Pakistan embraced digitalization in 2020 because of its phenomenal ability to boost the e-commerce of Pakistan (Qureshi, 2021).\nIn the Covid-haunted world, the physical movement of individuals depends upon country\u2019s rules, Covid-SOPs, quarantines, variants, tests, jabs, and boosters. Such an unpredictable situation is scary to ordinary travelers, and especially to investors. Due to CoVID-19, CPEC\u2019s physical infrastructure is moving at a slow pace, and is forcing the government of Pakistan to continue its governance and management through technology, as done during the pandemic with the Digital Silk Road (Gyu, 2021).\nOur study focuses on the digitalization of CPEC within Pakistan. It discusses the means and ways of adopting digitalization and assesses how policies can be designed to achieve a higher level of digitalization in CPEC. To provide background to this idea, we analyze, assess, and compare E-governance and digitalization policies and initiatives around the globe to highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of digitalization adoption policies. Our study provides a detailed layout of digitalization inspired by different governmentswith the help of an analytical framework, which is based on our argument. It indicates how digitalization policies can be adopted for CPEC-focused initiatives.\nOur study aims to pinpoint whether and how digitalization affects CPEC\u2019s reputation, as it is considered an economic driver for enhancing Pakistan\u2019s economy. Digital transformation in our study refers to all the activities, projects, actions, and procurement that have been undertaken to realize digitalization through DTC and increase CPEC efficiency. Among other factors, improving reputation through the revolution of information can positively impact CPEC and improve its potential to attract more investors and retain consumers. Our study will use the words E-governance, E-Government, and digitalization interchangeably. We have the ultimate aim that the government of Pakistan may adopt it and provide EInfrastructure to CPEC-related services for various stakeholders. This paper is structured as follows: Section Background: Opportunities and Threats discusses the background of the problem and determines both opportunities and threats to nondigitalized CPEC. Section Rational for Adoption Digitalization Policies endorses the increasing ICT adoption substantial returns to CPEC. Section Effective Digitalization Adoption Policies argues how effective digitalization adoption policies can be outlined, considering how the adoption process works. In Section Comparative Analysis of Digitalization Adoption Policies, a layout of comparative analysis of digitalization adoption policies is discussed. Section Applied Frame of ADG applied ADG to describe, analyze, and compare CPEC Digitalization adoption policies."

By 2025, digitalization will create six million jobs in logistics and in the electricity industry (World-Economic-Forum, 2021). althoguh further investigation is required to narrow down logistics and electric fields to the Asian context. Themachine agemay create its own ethics and e-norms that may be taught to future generations. Like in current society, children are taught social studies and ethics in schools. Social media created the hiring of social media account managers, TikTok Live streamers, search engine optimizers, and digital security persons (World-EconomicForum, 2021). Further exploration is required on whether digitalization is creating jobs or depleting jobs, particularly clerks, admins, artists, and drivers; however countries like Singapore are providing Skill Future Credit to those citizens who are above age 25 and want to develop their industry skills o (Gov-Singapore, 2016). Further research is needed to identify industries, what they need, and what their required skills in the presence of AI are. It is also suggested by some studies that a detailed investigation is required of the risks of digitalization for international businesses. Some studies embarked upon\ndigital interdependence, information security, and the regulatory complexity of digitalization (Luo, 2022)."

In lower level implementation this seems acceptable, but sometimes some problems (like social unrest) are spontaneous and require urgent action, which is not available in the databases. For a complete culture of digital transformation, it will be required to upgrade worker\u2019s skills accordingly; this will require further investment in pieces of training (Bernini et al., 2021). Another problem of digitalization is its constant shaping and reshaping status and the threats and risks associated with its changing position financially and psychologically; in the past 50 years it radically reshaped the business associated with it (Brenner, 2018). A grave concern about digitalization is that it may affect jobs, wages, inequality, health, resources, and security (World-Economic-Forum, 2021)."

A National Census Coordination Center (N3C) will be set up to facilitate the census and Census Support Centers (CSCs) at the tehsil level. These centers will be available 24/7 for smooth implementation. The government plans to purchase 120,000 tablets to implement the 2022 Digital Census. The Federal Minister said, \u201cThe census is an important task, so we need to use the latest technology\u201d (Paracha, 2022). The government says the next election (2023) will be based on the results of this digital census (APP, 2022). The reason for this digitized census by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) is the shift frommanual to digitalization which took place in 2018 (ProPakistani, 2020). Pakistan successfully implemented E-Governance initiatives of Table-based Price Collection system (TPCS), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Wholesale Price Index (WPI), Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI), Tablet-Based PSLM Survey, Development of Android Based Software for Pakistan Demographic Survey (PDS), Price Analytical Dashboard (CPI,WPI, SPI, RPI), Tablet-Based Software Development for LFS, Revamping of PBS Website, Development of Software for HR, Litigation Management, Inventory Management, and Development of Dashboard for Censuses/Surveys (Gov-PBS, 2021).\nThere is an urgent need for the digitalization of CPEC for economic growth. To facilitate this, the government of Pakistan established the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority (CPECA). Although its existence and legitimacy are debatable, Pakistan largely manages the overall management of CPEC. The purpose of signing the CPEC is to make Pakistan an economic hub based on technologies such as the Digital Silk Road (DSR). DSR aims to bridge the gap between developed and underdeveloped countries and remove all obstacles in way of development. The objectives of CPEC are also the same: to remove all obstacles in the way of developed and undeveloped areas of Pakistan (Lugt, 2021)."

            "text": "Our study found that CPECA\u2019s website does not have sectorspecific, geography-focused, and investor-centric information, so would not help an investor decide whether to invest in CPEC, particularly investors not physically present in Pakistan (see for detail http://cpec.gov.pk/). Pakistan is desperately looking for investors. However, Global Finance Magazine did not include it in its 2016 and 2018 foreign investment lists due to its poor governance (OBIOLS, 2018). The government of Pakistan relaxed the visa and citizenship requirements to attract investment (Dawn, 2022). However, this may not be helpful unless it offers\nmonetary and legal incentives. The proposed nine SEZs must have their individualistic benefits to investors. Otherwise, why would an investor from the UK want to go to Pakistan\u2019s less lawful areas such as Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Merged Areas and settled districts both), and Rural Sindh? Beside that, the government of Pakistan restricted foreigners, including diplomats, from going to these mentioned areas without security involvement (GOV-UK, 2020). Naturally, most investors will opt for Punjab because the UK government declared it safe for citizens. The US government has mentioned the areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan in the \u201cDo not Travel\u201d and \u201cReconsider Travel\u201d lists (GOV-US, 2021). The US and the UK\u2019s reservations show that developed country\u2019s citizens may not go directly and would not be interested in such areas or sectors, which is why there is a dire need for digitalization and incentivization of CPEC.\nThe literature review of CPEC highlights numerous problems and issues faced by Pakistan, but all of them cannot be addressed simultaneously. However, the problems underscored by investors and financial institutions are discussed by this study in detail. Pakistan\u2019s entire internet is dependent on landing station cable, which is underwater in Karachi; any disruption can dismantle the whole country\u2019s internet. At Gawadar port, an alternative landing station cable is planned, which may minimize the reliance on the already available cable. The Gawadar Cable stretches to Djibouti across the Silk Road from Asia to Africa, underwater over 6,299 Kilometers area. Along with that, 5G technology utilization can remove the risks of internet disruption if it is regularized in line with the prevailing rules of Pakistan. Nonetheless, the whole of Pakistan is not ready for 5G, although at least the CPEC routes, CPEC-SEZs, and concerned offices can be operationalized for interconnecting Pakistan digitally (Rehman, 2020). We can borrow IMPACT 2002+methodology, which is an intergovernmental panel on climate change (Abbas et al., 2021) for CPEC digitalization between China and Pakistan. Or for digitalization, authorities can conduct direct interviews of investors from South Asian countries including China by the multistage sampling techniques used by others (Abbas et al., 2022). One study used a cluster of 80 farmers, and can be replicated on the above mentioned countries to understand the trends investotrs are interested in for digitalization. After developing digitalization, its efficiency can be tested by the ensemble approach (Abbas et al., 2020) used for measuring energy efficiency at Pakistan.\nOn the other hand, there are some concerns from the international community that the process of CPEC is opaque and unaccountable. These allegations are based on (China Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority Act, 2021) Article 12, which gives complete immunity to its staff from any judicial inquiry. Since the 2019 CPECA\u2019s establishment, it did not perform extra-ordinarily (Kiani, 2021). While commenting on the overall situation of CPEC, previous senator Mushahid Hussain mentioned that all opposition parties of Pakistan have concerns over CPECA\u2019s establishment, its legality, and staff immunity from legal procedures (Kumar, 2020).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887848\nContrary to that, Pakistan is gradually taking its E-governance initiatives discussed in the above E-Initiatives of Pakistan. However, E-Governance and E-Managed Infrastructure for CPEC does not exist to date, which may hinder attracting businesses and investors. A blogger rightly stated that the government needs to work on policies, rotating around technology and telecoms, develop PPP, offer investor and Business Centric flexible regulations, encourage innovation, devise clear legislation, provide guaranteed privacy to investors, adopt a Citizen-Centric approach, and enhance Digital literacy (Digital-Pakistan, 2021).\nDigital illiteracy reduces the opportunities in the new digital market for those who show a low level of ICT adoption, and in the future, they will be unemployed, uneducated, and isolated (Berg and Winden, 2002). It requires adopting a need-based mechanism to increase governmental efficiency and productivity while using technology (Li et al., 2021).\nThe CPEC digitalization and transformation is totally in line with Government of Pakistan E-Governance initiatives, called the \u201cway forward toward Digital Pakistan,\u201d a strategic framework planned to establish short-term and long-term robust plans for e-government. Under this program, all ministries were expected to adopt digitalization by March 2019. However, the revision did not materialize the whole digitalization package (Gov-IRC-PK, 2020).\nThere is insufficient focus on CPEC digitalization, which may discourage the project\u2019s goals and pose a challenge because countries in the developed world seek sustainable development within digitalization (Dobriansky et al., 2020). In the era of advanced technology, the most applauded approach is the adoption of ICT for efficient results. It is believed that ICT adoption can contribute to sustainability, economic development, and competition (Berg and Winden, 2002). To make CPEC more beneficial in the face of the fourth revolution, there is a dire need for a good revolution of information and e-literacy among its stakeholders. The CPEC digitalization may stimulate E-business, E-governance, and E-management and create new opportunities for stakeholders (Investor and Consumers) to improve Pakistan\u2019s Economy."

This means the legislation will not stand in the way of the digitalization of the public sector (Plesner and Justesen, 2022). Then it should be linked with the National Information Technology Board (NITB), which is the combination of Pakistan Computer Bureau (PCB) and Electronic Government Directorate (EGD) commissioned by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MoIT) for technical assistance (hard & soft). The purpose of the NITB establishment was to address the operational challenges of all government departments and ministries and implement robust IT technologies to promote an E-Governance culture in the country. As of Feb 22, 2022, NITB has developed 71 websites, deployed E-office in 69 ministries, and provided more than 1,200 IT consultancies to governmental organizations (Gov-NITBPK, 2022). After finalizing the infrastructure component, the second phase of CPEC is attracting investors and technological transformation, and the installation of industrial, technical, and agricultural technologies for the envisioned development of Pakistan. That is why the President of Pakistan invited the ambassador designated to Korea, Nabeel Munir, and the ambassador to Algeria, Muhammad Tariq, to invite investors from Korea and Algeria to invest in CPEC (Qureshi, 2022).\nDTC Digital Governance should consider competing models and the potential challenges of fostering sustainable e-governance. The only benefits of this change are change in strategic decisions, efficient implementation, system platforms, governing culture, and behavior. It has complete IT infrastructure offices and relevant ministries.\nSome may ask why Pakistan would not imitate the Chinese SEZ\u2019s model instead of taking a hard road with unknown roadblocks? It must be clear that every country has a different political system, and everyone has one\u2019s associates and rivals. Therefore, DTC is a concept that will synchronize the needs of Pakistan with the current situation. However, Pakistan needs to build its apps and databases with the help of China and other techno experts. Non-local databases can create a significant gap between CPEC and its investors. Cooperation and collaboration between partners and government officials should not be underestimated(Ghazaleh and Ahmad, 2018).\nIf we apply Forlizzi, it all looks the same. The CPEC will seem like Chinese SEZs, at first glance, or DSRs, as they say, Lady Gaga is the new Madonna (Forlizzi, 2010), but in reality, it is not in the context of Pakistan, because CPEC is the first project of its kind. This is Pakistan\u2019s first experience clubbing PPP and the international community in one platform. The cycle illustrated below has some similarities and some differences, which give a picture that both cycles need to combine the interest of each other (Investor & Customer, see Figure 3).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887848\nTwo years after the deployment of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China launched the Digital Silk Road (DSR) in 2015 to deepen its global trade relationships through E-initiatives. DSR has been compared by one of the tech analysts, Paul Triolo, with the McDonald\u2019s business model of franchises everywhere (Wedell, 2020). DSR core components are optical cables and satellite passageways construction and installation for expanding information exchange and collaboration (Lugt, 2021), which is the forerunner of CPEC.\nCPEC digitalization may offer modern opportunities to improve information revolution interactivity through the delivery of 24/7 public and private services. It would also involve the consultation of stakeholders in the decision-making process. That is why it is in the economic interest of the Federal Government to find ways for its realization."

The nature of CPEC requires using on-demand access via the internet to applications, servers, tools, databases, and related information. Cloud computing is the best service for on-demand access because of its lower cost, agility, and virtualization (Vennam, 2020).\nCPEC growth, its employee\u2019s expansion, geographical enlargement, security and backups, storage and warehouses, parking lots, production, air surveillance, Virtual meetings, leakages and breakages, banking and airports, dry ports and seaports, their integration with government websites and application, and all their management could be made possible with the help of Cloud-computing Technology because it has choices for Public Cloud and Private Cloud, based on SaaS (software-as-a-service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-service), IaaS(Infrastructure-as-a-service), and Serverless computing (Vennam, 2020). The public or private cloud selection is left to the stakeholder\u2019s choice. ADG\u2019s experiment with Cloud computing may provide a layout to DTC\u2019s decision, where the director expressed his level of satisfaction in these words: \u201dThe cloud will also facilitate efforts to comply with technical standards. It will ensure users\u2019 access to all applications and technical services more quickly and from anywhere and anytime, contributing to increasing staff productivity and reducing the cost of building and maintaining centers (Ghazaleh and Ahmad, 2018)\u201d.\nThis new system will enhance coordination among government entities and may create a flow of information, directly mitigating the conflicts and impediments between different entities. It will also provide a video call service to fellow authorities, removing ambiguity. Without CPEC digitalization, the web of roads, railway lines, airports, seaports, factories, farms, banks, institutions, law enforcement agencies, warehouses, hotels, recreational centers, investors, customers, and drivers (who will use smartphones, Apps, Websites) cannot achieve the objective of 62$ billion investment. This huge pool of people can only be managed with the help of technical assistance and effective leadership. This can be done at present, because now the population is small, but as the population grows, so will the CPEC stakeholders. CPEC is currently between China and Pakistan, but will soon be linked to Central Asia and the Middle East, by which time the traffic at each outlet will have doubled (Auffret, 2010). Emergency-based digitalization and transformation of CPECA can make it possible to put all the required steps online, including virtual visits. However, legal issues attached to it could be resolved simultaneously."

            "text": "In this section, we show how digitalization may contribute to CPEC development.\nAccording to the UN list of e-governments, Pakistan ranks 153rd (Digital-Pakistan, 2021). The reason for this is that Pakistan lacks the infrastructure for digitalization. Denmark, on the other hand, tops the UN-E list due to its digital policies\nfor 2016 and 2020 (Figure 6). Denmark called for interaction between citizens and government agencies, including those who were unwilling to adopt. Another reason Denmark is at the forefront is the digitalization of all its tiers (from central government to municipal), including the private sector and their services. (WorldAtlas, 2021). Some scholars believe Egovernance combined with E-administration and E-Services (Bravo, 2021) are the key expected deliverables of E-governance out of CPEC digitalization. One of our study\u2019s focuses is on governance and the transparency of CPEC, like with the Korean government. Korea kept the satisfaction of its citizens high; that is why they successfully achieved the purpose of digitalization (WorldAtlas, 2021).\nMost of the E-Governance initiatives are influenced by the Estonian model, as is ADG; similarly, it also earned praise in the eyes of scholars who approve of Estonian\u2019s e-Governance, calling it \u201cone of the most advanced countries in terms of e-governance.\u201d Under the digitalized system, when ministers have to sign any law, they use e-signatures to reduce the cost of public services for administrative procedures. It reduces public transport usage when citizens come to offices for passport renovation or other official signatures \u201c(Bravo, 2021)\u201c. Although China is 45 on the list of UNE-Governance, most scholars believe that countries like Pakistan can learn from the Chinese e-experience (Bravo, 2021; Ullah et al., 2021).\nThe modern world belongs to digitalization, which Xi Jinping calls the fourth Revolution (World-Economic-Forum, 2021), where most of the problems will be expected to be solved by technology. However, the most pressing problem for countries like Pakistan is cross-cutting technology governance gaps. Due to its lack of effective regulation, rampant misuse of technology, lack of accountability, privacy and data sharing, Cross-border inconsistencies, and restricted data flows it may face difficulties in the age of technology (World-Economic-Forum, 2021)."

There are wellknown cyber-crimes, cyber-terrorism, and cyber espionages that pose a threat to national security (Luo, 2022). Through digitalization, massive data will be generated according to a firm\u2019s or organization\u2019s requirements with its individualistic vulnerability of data privacy, the breakage of that can hinder further digitalization of other organizations (Forcadell et al., 2020). The case of Pakistan is not different; within 1 year (2021- 2022) Pakistan saw three instances of data leakage: the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) on October 30, 2021, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on November 12, 2021, and on November 25, 2021, the hacking of National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) (Hussain et al., 2022). Digitalization is a double-edged sword; on one hand, it creates opportunities, while on another hand it has complexities, threats, and, vulnerabilities to both businesses and societies (Brenner, 2018; Luo, 2022). i.e. some digitalized companies may create a monopoly and can threaten their adversaries, thereby giving strength to monopolies rather than democracies (Brenner, 2018). The World Economic\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887848\nForum concluded in one of its reports on digitalization\u2019s impact on society that \u201cdue to it between two million to two billion jobs will be lost by 2030 (World-Economic-Forum, 2021)\u201d.

According to its on-service plan, DTC may be in constant coordination through designated 24/7 channels with its required stakeholders because only communication can enhance the project implementation efficiently (Wang et al., 2017).\nThe Government of India adopted the idea of a 24/7 service partnered with Tata Consultancy Service (TCS) to register companies online (Sharma, 2007); this is another best practice that DTC may adopt for registering new companies and businesses their linkages with banks. The establishment of DTC is not only a technology-driven platform. It is also an organizational transformation project that expects to follow every changing model for meeting CPEC digitalization, focusing on upgrading governmental organizations from an existing environment to a more sophisticated one. The targeted audiences of DTC and ADG are not the same; the latter\u2019s result is to give E-services to their citizens as done by other EGovernment projects, while the focus of DTC design is investor and customer centric through E-Governance. On one side, it will transform CPEC, while on the other hand, it will attract businesses and investors through its E-Governance and Emanagement.\nThe Team of DTC is key to achieving its goals; in the ordinance, the qualification and experience need to be\nmentioned, not like the CPEC Authority Act 2019, 2020, and 2021 where nothing was said about the qualification of the Chairman and other staff and the selection was left to the Prime Minister\u2019s discretionary power. It is better to take guidelines from E-Governance\u2019s already implemented projects. Hiring was a significant challenge for the ADG imitative, and they determined the team\u2019s qualifications from past experiences. Along with hiring, there is an employee retention problem. ADG adopted the star performers approach closely linked with HR to identify employees worthy of retention. The beauty of E-governance structure is that it can assess all managing cadres\u2019 performance by itself, with the help of software and databases. However, CPECA may consult the Job Embeddedness Framework (JEF) for employees retention (Shah et al., 2020). The central database will preserve the input and output taken and given by involved staff, from telephone operators down to the security guards; all will be under software and apps surveillance, which on the one hand will show their performance while on the other hand their effectiveness. It may oversee the implementation of management through scientifically verified means."

For the Emanagement team, developers will develop E-Systems, which can trace every person\u2019s growth under the supervision and guidance of the CEO (Figure 7). DTC may follow the structured approach of ADG, whose objectives were to empower employees to accept changes in the desired E-influenced environment. All components of the DTC unit will work in the spirit of Digitalization of CPEC and CPECA Transformation for the future.\nDTC will be established in the presence of CPECA, as ADG was established and embedded in the available government infrastructure. It may give birth to complications while procuring some equipment directly from vendors. For the e-government initiatives to succeed, it is required to develop trust among the stakeholders, particularly participants of e-government sister ministries and authorities. Paul A. Volcker believes that we cannot expect trust without excellent and fair publicmanagement (Volcker, 2014).\nIt will be a real challenge for the CEO and their team to achieve the envisioned goals of DTC. To create new jobs and achieve time-bound millstones, it is required to coordinate with governmental authorities and move faster with procurement and hiring. The management may take out budgets, tackle unseen political impediments, manage departmental jealousies, and absorb the pressure of accountability before the court and dare to present their progress to the National Assembly. PM alliance of Atlanta suggests \u201dA phased approach\u201c for such a complicated situation, which may successfully go through such adversaries (Stevens, 2009).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887848\nStakeholders Involvement In the case of DTC, stakeholders can be investors (national and international), business managers, ministries and and their employees, IT staff, the Chinese and other interested governments, expected consumers, CPECA staff, private sectors, and consultants. The government of Pakistan underestimate the need and importance of stakeholders\u2019 involvement in CPEC related decisions; they are crucial for project implementation (Berg and Winden, 2002). The success of digitalization is to meet the expectation of the stakeholders (Mishra and Mishra, 2013). This is the drive of digitalization that minimizes the gap between the old and new setup and adopts such enormous policies, which show the capacity to overcome any resistance with the inclusion of stakeholders\u2019 engagement. The changing approach is tough to accept; however, creating an extraordinary sense of urgency for change or creating short-term wins can change the culture (Kotter, 2019).\nDTC may form a stakeholder\u2019s database from all directly or indirectly involved stakeholders\u2019 correspondence with CPECA government departments. DTC stakeholder\u2019s network will contribute qualitatively and quantitatively to the needs and expectations of CPEC. The purpose of all efforts is to produce efficient and effective organizations that simultaneously satisfy investors and customers.\nDTC can support the investors in the planning and implementation phase of their initiative within CPEC geography and even ask for help from other resourceful persons or entities whose expertise is known to the DTC database. It will keep the doors of learning open for further research and development in technology because unprecedented growth is coming in this sector.\nDTC should not underestimate the perpetual revolution and rotation of technological advancements and prepare itself for upcoming new business and management approaches influenced by screen-touched technology. As Harle (2012) stated, everyday growing technical and scientific environment must synchronize techno-human conditions. If DTC management effectively engages with stakeholders, they can achieve the objectives of CPEC."

Digitalization is a process of improvement in an organization\u2019s properties through the combination of ICT and connectivity (Bernini et al., 2021). To predict the future of industries, firms, and businesses ahead for 2 years or 3 years, big data may help create opportunities and risks (Brenner, 2018). Such an estimated prediction may give birth to another discipline, like the machine age (WorldEconomic-Forum, 2021). In Pakistan, there is a grave concern in provinces and regions about the uneven behavior of the Central government regarding CPEC; the establishment of DTC can add value to society from this digital transformation. In realizing CPEC transformation the vision of digital Pakistan can help the project and bring economic and social benefits if the transformation journey is focused on helping clients and investors. As is mentioned in a Forbes articles, \u201cBusiness success depends on having a clear understanding of profitability across service lines, customers, and regions (David, 2020)\u201d.

The secret of the top ten successful E-governance projects is their Citizen-Centric approach and the commitment of high-level government officials.\nIf DTC adopts the investor- and customer-centric approach, CPEC could be one of the success stories of E-Governance and social transformation both economically and technologically, providing services to its citizens satisfactorily. To impart transparency and sustainability in CPEC, the Government of Pakistan should consider the idea of digitalization of CPEC through a proposed solution; this model is also recommended for Belt and Road Partner countries, those that have a democratic set up with a multi-party system, where transparency and accountability is a grave concern. It is an opportunity for low E-governance systems to enhance their governance for BRI because it has much potential for PPP and government support.\nThe digitalization of CPEC through the establishment of the CPEC digitalization and Transformation Center (DTC) would yield benefits in the present by attracting investors. In the future, benefits would be gained by satisfying customers and investors by developing software and apps for rail-systems and its E-management, road surveillance and its E-Management, speeding up cross border clearance of custom requirements, farms management, Account opening for foreign investors, Hotels linking with apps, translation of apps, installation of scanning machines and its linkage with Federal database of FBR, E-Tax submission, Monitoring food processes, farming and enabling it to be environmentally friendly, and availability of both countries\u2019 Chamber of Commerce with the help of AI for any issue (Guppy, 2022)."
