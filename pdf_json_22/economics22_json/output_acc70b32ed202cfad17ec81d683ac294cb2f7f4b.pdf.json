    "abstractText": "Agricultural carbon emission is an important cause of climate change, and the carbon transfer caused by agricultural trade is a key area related to carbon emissions of all countries. Based on the Eora database, this paper aims to constructs a multi-region input\u2013output database of 185 countries or regions, analyzes a spatial correlation network of embodied net carbon transfer in global agricultural trade by using UCINET, selects multi-dimensional network measurement indicators, and comprehensively studies the global evolution characteristics and functional features of network plate role of embodied carbon transfer in the global agricultural trade. The result shows that the embodied net carbon transfer network of global agricultural trade is densely connected, the spatial correlation spillover effect is significant, and the edge of the network core structure is clear. On the one hand, the top four countries or regions in terms of embodied carbon outflow in agricultural trade are the USA, Australia, Vietnam, and China. On the other hand, the top four countries or regions of embodied carbon inflow are Malaysia, Central Africa, Singapore, and Serbia. From the perspective of outdegree, indegree, proximity centrality, and intermediary centrality, Cambodia, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Ghana, and South Africa, with the high frequency of the shortest path of the globally embodied net carbon transfer network, have a strong influence and linking facility in spatial correlation and have a strong control ability to the spatial correlation of other countries or regions. The embodied carbon emission network of global agricultural trade can be divided into four sectors: main spillover, two-way spillover, broker, and main benefit. The main spillover segment, constituted by the USA, India, Germany, and China, has significant embodied carbon spillover effects on the internal segment and other segments. It is the main embodied carbon spillover sector of embodied net carbon transfer of global agricultural trade. Countries should reasonably allocate the responsibility of carbon reduction according to the trading embodied carbon transfer and made efforts to optimize the export structure of agricultural products.",

            "text": "There is a strong correlation between climate change and CO2 emissions. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2021) released Climate Change 2021:\nThe Physical Science Basis (Irfan et\u00a0al. 2021a), which reveals the relationship between climate change and human activities (Lynn and Peeva 2021). After the industrial revolution, carbon emissions surged and the global temperature also rose (Wang et\u00a0al. 2019). From 1850 to 2019, the change of global temperature is directly proportional to the cumulative carbon emission (Deng et\u00a0al. 2017). The correlation between global temperature change and carbon emission can be seen in the fact that global temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5\u20132.5\u00b0 in 2050. Climate change is closely related to human activities, especially carbon emissions (Wang et\u00a0al. 2020). In November 2021, the 26th conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) pointed out that emissions should be reduced by 50% by 2050 in order to ensure the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C target. The global temperature has risen by 1.1\u00a0\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial period, and the Responsible Editor: Arshian Sharif * Fan Zhang zhangf.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn 1 Faculty of\u00a0International Trade, Shanxi University of\u00a0Finance and\u00a0Economics, Taiyuan\u00a0030006, China 2 Key Laboratory of\u00a0Land Surface Pattern and\u00a0Simulation, Institute of\u00a0Geographical Sciences and\u00a0Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of\u00a0Sciences, Beijing\u00a0100101, China\n1 3\naverage mole fraction of global carbon dioxide has exceeded 410\u00a0ppm. The climate critical point is approaching rapidly. Once exceeded, it will cause great disasters to human beings (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021a, b). To this end, countries around the world have actively responded. By the end of 2021, 136 countries or regions have proposed the development goal of carbon neutrality (Zhao et\u00a0al. 2022). Coping with climate change has become an urgent and huge threat to mankind, and adapting to and mitigating climate change has become the voice of all mankind (De La Pe\u00f1a et\u00a0al. 2022; Irfan et\u00a0al. 2020).\nThe issue of embodied carbon in trade has become a controversial point of global carbon emission reduction (Xu et\u00a0al. 2020). With the acceleration of economic globalization, especially the differences in the order of the value chain of products in the global division of labor and cooperation, has led to the separation of carbon emissions from production and consumption in time and space (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021a, b). Developed countries have high value-added products such as high-end technology, while developing countries have become the production places of high energy consumption, high emission, and low value-added products, which has led to global developing countries becoming pollution havens (Zheng and Shi 2017), while developed countries enjoy the resulting high consumption levels. In this regard, the issue of carbon emissions caused by trade is gaining attention (Wang and Han 2021). Agricultural trade, as an important part of a trade, has become increasingly prominent. Especially after the outbreak of COVID-19, agricultural products have become the best \u201cgood medicine\u201d to fight against the epidemic. According to the report on the State of Agricultural Commodity Markets in 2020 released by the FAO, the global agricultural and food trade has more than doubled since 1995, and the trade volume reached US $1.5 trillion in 2018 (FAO 2020). Among them, the exports of emerging markets and developing countries have continued to grow, accounting for more than one-third of the global total. The participation of countries in global agricultural trade depends on a number of factors, including countries\u2019 comparative advantage in production and consumer preferences (Cao et\u00a0al. 2021), but at the same time, the embodied carbon flow generated by agricultural trade also separates production from consumption (Beghin and Schweizer 2021). The analysis of the embodied carbon network flow of global agricultural trade can help countries grasp the characteristics of the global agricultural network of the embodied carbon of agricultural products (Lun et\u00a0al. 2021)."

            "text": "In addition to adaptation, what we can do is to prevent further climate deterioration, that is, to low-carbon transformation and zero-carbon development (Hao et\u00a0al. 2021;\nDeng et\u00a0 al. 2016; Yang et\u00a0 al. 2021). The research on embodied carbon transfer of agricultural products has become a hot spot of academic research at home and abroad (Balogh and J\u00e1mbor 2017), with most studies focusing on the embodied carbon flow of bilateral and single country import and export of agricultural products (Jiang et\u00a0al. 2020). Scholars investigated the embodied carbon emissions in Korean trade by using multi-regional input\u2013output analysis (Cui et\u00a0al. 2019). Also, systematically studies examined the embodied net carbon emissions of trade between the largest net exporter of developing countries (China) and the largest net exporter of developed countries (Germany) (Abbasi et\u00a0al. 2022; Balogh 2020). Quasi-input\u2013output analysis method was used to analyze specific land use and greenhouse gas emissions in global agricultural trade, to track the flow of agricultural land and greenhouse gas emissions among 151 countries or regions worldwide, and discussed the interdependence between land and emissions in different economic systems (Wood et\u00a0al. 2020). In summary, the research on the global virtual carbon transfer network of agricultural products needs to be further deepened (Zhou et\u00a0al. 2021), the coverage needs to be more comprehensive at the national or regional level, and the cross-global agricultural trade network needs to be established (M\u00fcllerCasseres et\u00a0al. 2021).\nThis paper makes some innovations on the basis of predecessors and adopts a global input\u2013output table to observe the different segments and clarify their roles in the embodied carbon transfer in global agricultural trade, and explore the link between different segments. This paper constructs the input\u2013output data table of agricultural trade in 185 countries or regions in the world in 2016, and uses the multi-regional input\u2013output model and social network analysis method to calculate the embodied carbon flow data of agricultural trade in various countries. It analyzes the major agricultural trade countries and identifies various characteristic indicators of the network, including individual characteristics, overall characteristics, and sub-segment characteristics of the network. Compared with other studies, this paper adopts the latest data and covers more comprehensive countries and regions. The analysis of the measured embodied carbon in global agricultural trade and the spatial correlation network of embodied carbon in global agricultural trade has important reference significance for policymakers of various countries. This paper focuses on the spatial correlation network characteristics of carbon implicit transfer in global agricultural trade and provides a new global perspective for understanding the net carbon implicit transfer of agricultural trade by constructing a spatial correlation network.

In the middle of the last century, it was more widely used by economists among multiple countries, resulting in the MRIO model, which can easily and accurately calculate the embodied carbon flows of agricultural products by using multi-regional input\u2013output model (Cabernard and Pfister 2021).\nGlobal MRIO table construction\nAssuming a total of R countries or regions in the world, the agricultural sector of each country or region is reflected in the input\u2013output table, which is the world input\u2013output table of the agricultural sector. ZEF is the intermediate input matrix of the agricultural sector of country E to the agricultural sector of country F (E, F = 1, 2,\u2026.., R), where the matrix element zEF is the amount of intermediate inputs from the agricultural sector of country E to the agricultural sector of country F. YEF is the 1*6-dimensional final demand matrix of the agricultural sector of country E for country F, where the matrix element yEF\ni (i = 1, 2\u2026, 6) is the final use\nof the agricultural sector of country E for the final demand 6 departments of country F.\nXE represents the total output of country E, where the matrix element xE\ni (i = 1, 2,\u2026, R) is the R*1-dimensional\noutput vector. According to the environmental satellite account of the Eora database, the emission matrix of CO2 emissions LE from the agricultural sector of each country is obtained, where the matrix element lE (E = 1, 2,\u2026, R) represents the CO2 emissions from the agricultural sector of country E. Based on CO2 emissions LE and total output, the coefficient matrix of direct carbon consumption coefficient G (direct emissions of CO2 per unit of output). G is the total output of direct emissions of CO2, that is, G = [ gAgB.....gR ] , is calculated, where the matrix element gE(E=1,2\u2026R) is the direct carbon emission coefficient of the agricultural sector of each country with 1*R-dimensional matrix.\n(1)\nZEF = \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 ZAA \u2026ZAR \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ZRA \u2026ZRR \u23a4 \u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 , YCD = \ufffd yCD 1 yCD 2 \u2026 yCD 6 \ufffd ,XE = \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 xA \u2026 xR \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\nThus, the horizofntal balance of input\u2013output models of agricultural products around the world is as follows:\nThe direct consumption coefficient matrix A is calculated as the total input or output of the agricultural sector. The Leontief inverse matrix (I \u2212 A)\u22121 is calculated by using the software MATLAB R2014b, and I is the unit matrix with diagonal 1.\nCalculate the total export value of intermediate input and final demand from the agricultural sector of country E (E = 1, 2,\u2026., R) to 26 sectors of country F (F = 1, 2,\u2026, R).\nThe intermediate input and final demand of the agricultural sector of country E to the 26 sectors of each country are added by country to obtain a EXEF export matrix of the agricultural sector of country E to each country. The matrix dimension is 185*185, where the matrix element exEF (E\\F = 1, 2,\u2026, R) represents the export value of the agricultural sector of country E to 184 countries (excluding the home country). Based on the calculation of global 185 countries or regions\u2019 trade embodied carbon exports CEF , we can get the export matrix with the 185*185-dimensional matrix and diagonal 0, where the matrix element CEF represents the embodied carbon outflows of the agricultural sector of country E to different countries. The calculation formula is:\nBased on the calculated export value, we can get the embodied carbon emission value of country E to country F and the value of country F to country E. From this, the embodied net carbon emission value of country E to country F can be obtained:\nAccording to the above formula, if the result is greater than 0, it is the net outflow of country E to country F. And if it is less than 0, it is the net outflow of country F to country E."

The adjacency matrix Z = (zEF ) of the network is defined to represent the embodied net carbon transfer relationship between each country or region in the network. When the embodied net carbon transfer of country E to country F is strictly greater than 0, there exists an edge vEF pointing from node E to node F. At this time, zEF is equal to 1; otherwise, zEF is equal to 0 (E, F = 1, 2,\u2026, 185). The weight zEF of the edge is wEF taken as the embodied net carbon transfer from country E to country F. The overall characteristics of the network are characterized by four indicators: network density, network relevance, average clustering coefficient, and average path length. Network density is the ratio of the actual number of edges in the network to the most likely number of edges in theory, and it is an important index to reflect the closeness of the network association. If the global embodied net carbon transfer network density is higher, the trade embodied carbon transfer links of various countries or regions are more frequent. |V| represents the number of edges and n is the number of nodes in the network, and then the network density U is calculated as follows:\nNetwork relevance is a measure of the degree of network relevance through accessibility, and it is the primary index to describe the robustness and vulnerability of the network.\nThe higher the relevance of the embodied net carbon transfer network of global trade, the better the relevance of the network and the more robust the network is. M1 is used to represent the number of unreachable point pairs in the network, and the calculation formula of correlation degree Z is:\nThe clustering coefficient, the measurement of the probability of connection between the adjacent nodes of nodes, is used to measure the degree of clustering of nodes in the global trade embodied net carbon transfer network. The clustering coefficient GC of the whole network is the average value of the clustering coefficients of all nodes in the network. Assuming that the node mE has kE adjacent nodes and the number of edges between these adjacent nodes is VE , and the clustering coefficient GCEF of the node mE is:\nThe average path length is the average value of the shortest path between all node pairs in the network.

This index is mainly used to measure the embodied carbon transfer efficiency of the global trade embodied net carbon transfer network. Using d ( mE , mF ) to represent the shortest path length between node mE and node mF , then the average path length GL is calculated as follows:\nThe network individual characteristics mainly select three core metrics to reflect the network topology: degree centrality, intermediary centrality, and proximity centrality. In directed networks, the degree centrality of nodes is divided into outdegree centrality and indegree centrality. In the global trade embodied net carbon transfer network, the outdegree centrality dout\nE and indegree centrality din E\nof node mE reflect the number of embodied net carbon outflow and net inflow relationships from country E to other countries, respectively. Considering the influence of weight, the weighted outdegree Wout\nE and weighted inde-\ngree Win E of node mE can be defined as the embodied net carbon outflow and net inflow from country E to other countries, respectively:\nThe intermediate centrality refers to the frequency of nodes appearing on the shortest path of the network. If a node is on the shortest path of many other point pairs, the intermediary centrality of the node is higher, and the country or region corresponding to the node plays a greater role as a communication bridge in the global trade embodied net carbon transfer network. Assuming that the number of shortest paths existing between node mD and node mF is jDF , the number of shortest paths passing through node mE between node mD and node mF is jDF(E) , where D \u2260 E \u2260 F, then the intermediary centrality BCE of nodes mE is calculated as:\nThe proximity centrality is a measure that nodes are not restricted by other nodes. In the network of embodied carbon transfer in global trade, if a country or region has a short distance from other nodes in the network, it has a high proximity centrality. Such a country or region is close to many other nodes and is less controlled by other countries\n(9)GL = \u2211 E,F d (m E ,m F )\nn(n \u2212 1)\ndout E\n= \u2211\nvEF\u2208P zEF,d\nin E = \u2211\nvEF\u2208P zFE\n(10)woutE = \u2211\nvEF\u2208V wEF,w\nin E = \u2211\nvEF\u2208V wFE\n(11)BCE = 2 \u2211 D \u2211 F gDF(E)\u2215gDF\nn2 \u2212 3n + 2\n1 3\n(regions).

The embodied net carbon transfer network of global agricultural products is densely connected, and the number of network relationships reaches 17,700. The embodied carbon transfer in global agricultural trade has obvious spatial correlation characteristics. The relevance degree of the embodied carbon network of global agricultural trade is 1, which shows that the global agricultural trade transfer network has good accessibility and obvious spatial spillover effect. The network density is 0.496, and the links between nodes are close, indicating that with the economic development, the links between various countries or regions gradually tend to be close, resulting in more frequent transfer of carbon emissions from agricultural products.\nFrom the perspective of the global embodied net carbon transfer network of agricultural products, the degree of most nodes in the network is very small, and the relationship with other nodes is small. Most countries are at the edge of the network and are at the edge in the global agricultural trade. They do not play a prominent role in the net carbon transfer of global agricultural trade. A few nodes\n1 3\nin the network are at the center. The core nodes in the network are mainly concentrated in Central Africa (Fig.\u00a01), Serbia, the Netherlands, Singapore, Malaysia, the USA, China, India, Romania, Estonia, Brazil, and other countries. These countries, as the core of agricultural trade, have spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between net carbon transfer and its inflow and outflow. From the overall characteristics of the network, the network density is 0.026, the average network degree is 5.032, the average network clustering coefficient is 0.325, the agglomeration\neffect is obvious, and the average path length of the network is 3.219, indicating that although most areas in the network are not directly connected, they can be reached through a few steps. The embodied net carbon transfer network of global agricultural trade has large average clustering coefficient and short average path length, indicating that the global agricultural trade has typical small world characteristics. In this network, the possibility of establishing links between any node is large.

As the world\u2019s largest exporter of agricultural products, the outdegree centrality of the USA is 46,932.289. The top five trading partner countries of the USA with embodied carbon transfer outflow are Malaysia (8.07 Mt), Singapore (7.09 Mt), Mexico (3.30 Mt), the Netherlands (2.36 Mt), and Guinea (2.11 Mt). Australia is the second largest country of embodied carbon transfer outflow. Australian top five countries with trading embodied carbon transfer outflow are Malaysia (15.93 Mt), Singapore (10.99 Mt), Central Africa (3.58 Mt), Serbia (2.15 Mt), and Indonesia (1.69 Mt). Vietnam is the third country with embodied carbon transfer outflow. Vietnamese top five countries with trading embodied carbon transfer outflow are Malaysia (8.35 Mt), Singapore (6.87 Mt), Central Africa (5.49 Mt), Serbia (2.10 Mt), and Australia (1.54 Mt). China is the fourth country with embodied carbon transfer outflow. Chinese top five countries with trading embodied carbon transfer outflow are Malaysia (17.07 Mt), Singapore (8.10 Mt), Central Africa (3.26 Mt), Thailand (2.10 Mt), and Serbia (1.52 Mt) (Fig.\u00a02).\nFrom the perspective of the embodied carbon transfer inflow end of global agricultural trade, the top four countries with the largest embodied carbon transfer inflow of agricultural products in 2016 were Malaysia, Central Africa, Singapore, and Serbia. Malaysia is the world\u2019s largest country with embodied carbon transfer inflow in agricultural trade. Malaysian top five countries with embodied carbon transfer inflow are China (17.07 Mt), Australia (15.93 Mt), Cambodia (13.24 Mt), Indonesia (9.32 Mt), and Vietnam (8.35 Mt). Central African is the second largest country of embodied carbon inflow in global agricultural trade. The Central African top five major countries with embodied carbon transfer inflow are Vietnam (5.79 Mt), Australia (3.58 Mt), China (3.26 Mt), India (2.95 Mt), and Sudan (2.75 Mt). Singapore is the third country with embodied carbon transfer inflow. Singaporean top five countries with embodied carbon transfer inflow are Indonesia (12.59 Mt), Australia (10.99 Mt), Malaysia (8.52 Mt), China (8.10 Mt), and the USA (7.08 Mt). Serbia is the fourth country in terms of embodied carbon transfer inflow. Serbian top five countries with embodied carbon transfer inflow are Australia (2.14 Mt), Vietnam (2.10 Mt), China (1.52 Mt), India (1.50 Mt), and the UK (1.48 Mt) (Fig.\u00a03).\nIndividual characteristics of\u00a0carbon transfer network\nBy calculating the degree centrality, proximity centrality, and intermediary centrality of each node in the embodied net carbon transfer network of agricultural trade in the top 15 countries or regions, it is concluded that the USA, China, Australia, Vietnam, and Indonesia occupy the top five in terms of outdegree centrality. These countries are also the central nodes of global agricultural trade and are in the active position in the embodied net carbon transfer of agricultural trade, which has the main influence on other countries. The average outdegree centrality is 3943.160, and there are 48 countries or regions higher than the average, indicating that there are more nonlinear spatial correlations between these countries and other countries. Besides, Malaysia, Central Africa, Singapore, Serbia, and the Netherlands occupy the top five in terms of indegree centrality. These countries are more influenced by other countries in the process of embodied carbon transfer in agricultural trade. In addition, the top five countries in terms of proximity centrality are Nigeria, Niger, UAE, Argentina, and Guatemala, indicating that the average embodied net carbon transfer path from other countries or regions to them are longer. In particular, the top five countries with out-proximity centrality are Central Africa, Serbia, Guinea, Romania, and Portugal, which are far away from the center, have low independence in receiving embodied net carbon inflow, enhanced restrictions by other countries or regions, and have weak influence. What is more, the top five countries are Cambodia, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Ghana, and South Africa in terms of intermediary centrality. These countries appear on the shortest path of the global embodied net carbon transfer network with high frequency and have a strong influence and bridge role in spatial correlation. These countries are in the central of the global correlation network of embodied net carbon transfer in global agricultural trade, and have strong control over the spatial correlation of other countries or regions (Table\u00a02).\nBlock model result analysis\nBased on the block model approach, the 2016 global embodied net carbon transfer network of agricultural products is identified by using the CONCOR module in UCINET for plate identification. The position roles of each plate are positioned according to the ratio of actual and expected internal relationships within the plate and the number of internal and external relationships of the plate. Finally, the countries or regions in the global embodied net carbon transfer network are divided into four plates. On the whole, the global embodied net carbon transfer network of agricultural trade in 2016 contains 1742 spatial correlations, including 161\n1 3\nrelationships inside the plate and 1581 relationships between plates. The number of relationships between plates is much higher than that inside plates. It can be concluded that the spatial correlation network is dominated by the spillover effect between plates.\nThe first plate mainly includes Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, and other countries or regions. The actual and expected internal relationships of this plate are 4.13% and 70.65%, respectively. This plate not only receives the spillover relationship to other plates, but also issues the relationship to other plates.\n1 3\nHowever, the number of internal relationships in the plate is small, which has the characteristics of broker plate. The second plate mainly contains Austria, Syria, and other countries or regions. The ratio of actual internal relationships within the plate is 3.80%, which is lower than the expected ratio of 7.36%. There are many connections between the internal and\nexternal plates of the whole one, which belongs to a twoway spillover plate. The nodes of countries or regions in the plate not only issue many relationships to the external plate, but also have relationships to the internal plate. Its members have a two-way relationship and have a factor radiation relationship between the internal members of the plate\n1 3\nand the external nodes of countries or regions. The overall function of the plate is the diffusion, radiation, and transmission of factors. The third plate includes the USA, China, Australia, India, Indonesia, Cambodia, and other countries or regions. The actual and expected internal relationships of this plate are 9.55% and 15.22%, respectively. The plate not only receives the spillover relationship of other plates, but also issues the relationship to other plates. The number of relationships outside the plate is much greater than that inside the plate. The third plate has obvious net overflow characteristics. The fourth sector mainly contains Central Africa, Malaysia, Guinea, South Korea, and other countries or regions. The actual relationship ratio within the plate is 10.80%, higher than the expected ratio of 8.70%, and the spillover effect of the plate is limited. The number of relationships received from other plates is much higher than the number of relationships issued by them, which belongs to the main beneficiary plate. More embodied carbon spillovers from other plates are received in the network (Table\u00a03).\nTo further investigate the embodied carbon transfer relationship between the plates, the density matrices of four plates are calculated and their image matrices are summarized. The element values of the image matrix are 0 and 1. When the density matrix of the plate is greater than the overall network density, the corresponding position in the image matrix is 1; otherwise, it is 0 (Table\u00a04). From the perspective of the degree of spillover plate, the main beneficiary plate of the fourth plate has a certain spillover effect on itself, the first plate (broker plate), and the second plate (two-way spillover plate); and the two-way spillover plate of the second plate is mainly subject to spillover from the first\nplate (broker plate), itself, and the fourth plate (main beneficiary plate). In addition, the first plate has a significant effect of embodied net carbon spillover of agricultural trade on the second plate. From the perspective of the self-reflexive relationship, the diagonal position of the second plate (twoway spillover plate) and the fourth plate (main beneficiary plate) in the matrix is 1, indicating that the two plates have a high degree of reflexivity and obvious internal clustering characteristics."

Besides, the two-way spillover plate should exploit the potential of energy saving and emission\nreduction to reduce the embodied carbon emissions at source (Irfan et\u00a0al. 2022). The plate should serve as a key hub and influence plate in agricultural trade, which is conducive to\n1 3\nthe overall emission reduction of global agricultural trade, while promoting more countries or regions to implement green and low-carbon production pattern. The USA, China, Australia, Vietnam, and Indonesia play an active role in the embodied net carbon transfer of agricultural trade, which has a major impact on other countries. In addition, Malaysia, Central Africa, Singapore, Serbia, and the Netherlands, these countries are more affected by other countries in the carbon transfer process embodied in agricultural trade.\nCentral Africa, Serbia, Guinea, Romania, and Portugal have low independence in receiving specific net carbon inflows, strong restrictions from other countries or regions, and weak influence on other countries. Cambodia, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Ghana, and South Africa have a strong influence and bridge role in spatial correlation, and have a strong ability to control the spatial correlation of other countries. For different countries or regions in agricultural trade, we should start from the two levels of inflow and outflow. Specifically, when cooperating with other countries or regions, priority can be given to the countries or regions with their embodied net carbon inflow relationship, trading partners can be selected that are conducive to the green development of their agriculture, and the further expansion of embodied carbon in trade can be increased. When it comes to the embodied carbon emission of agricultural products, it is necessary to increase the export proportion of value-added products and reduce the carbon content of export products."

            "text": "This paper constructs the embodied carbon transfer network of global agricultural trade in 185 countries in 2016, comprehensively measures the status and role of the embodied carbon transfer of global agricultural trade, as well as the characteristics of the pattern of global embodied carbon inflow and outflow, identifies the plates of different countries based on the block model, and reveals the roles and functions of different plates. The main research conclusions of this paper are as follows.\nFirstly, from the perspective of the embodied carbon transfer outflow end of global agricultural products, the top four countries with the largest embodied carbon transfer outflow of agricultural products in 2016 were the USA, Australia, Vietnam, and China. From the perspective of the embodied carbon transfer inflow end of global agricultural trade, the top four countries with the largest embodied carbon transfer inflow of agricultural products in 2016 were Malaysia, Central Africa, Singapore, and Serbia.\nSecondly, from the perspective of the characteristics of the embodied carbon transfer network of global agricultural products trade, the spatial spillover characteristics of the net\ntransfer network are obvious, the core edge characteristics of global agricultural products trade are clear, the connections of the embodied net carbon transfer network of global agricultural products are dense, and the number of network relationships reaches 17,700. The embodied carbon transfer of global agricultural products trade has obvious spatial correlation characteristics. Moreover, the relevance of the embodied carbon network of global agricultural trade is 1, which shows that the global agricultural trade transfer network has good accessibility and obvious spatial spillover effect. The network density is 0.496, and the links between nodes are close, indicating that with the economic development, the links between various countries or regions gradually tend to be close, resulting in more frequent transfer of agricultural trade.\nThirdly, from the perspective of outdegree centrality, the USA, China, Australia, Vietnam, and Indonesia are in an active position in the embodied net carbon transfer of agricultural trade, which has a major impact on other countries. From the perspective of indegree centrality, Malaysia, Central Africa, Singapore, Serbia, and the Netherlands are more influenced by other countries in the embodied carbon transfer in agricultural trade. What is more, in terms of proximity centrality, the average embodied net carbon transfer path of other countries or regions to Nigeria, Niger, UAE, Argentina, and Guatemala is longer. In terms of intermediary centrality, Cambodia, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Ghana, and South Africa have a strong influence and bridge role in spatial correlation. These countries or regions are in the central position in the spatial correlation network of embodied net carbon transfer in global agricultural trade and have strong control over the spatial correlation of other countries or regions.\nFourthly, from the block model results, the embodied carbon transfer network of global agricultural trade can be divided into four plates: net spillover, two-way spillover, broker, and main beneficiary. The main spillover plate is the main carbon emission plate of the global agricultural trade transfer network, which mainly includes the USA, India, Germany, China, etc. Besides, these countries play an important role in the supply of labor and energy resources in the global agricultural production network, and have a significant embodied carbon spillover effect on other plates within the plate. Furthermore, the main beneficiary plate mainly contains Central Africa, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, etc. These plates mainly produce highly polluting agricultural products, receive more embodied carbon spillover from other plates, and play the main beneficiary characteristics of the embodied net carbon transfer network in the global trade.\nLast but not least, the USA, China, Australia, Indonesia, and other major agricultural countries should actively improve the export structure of agricultural\n1 3\nproducts and effectively change the mode of agricultural development. Efforts should be made to optimize the export structure of agricultural products, strengthen the export of green and low-carbon agricultural products, appropriately limit the export of agricultural products with high carbon intensity, and increase the import of intermediate products with high energy consumption for agricultural production input (Irfan et\u00a0al. 2021b). Relying on the upgrading of the export structure of agricultural products to promote the upgrading of agricultural industrial structure, and realize the low-carbon development of agriculture. Countries should reasonably allocate the responsibility of carbon reduction according to the trading embodied carbon transfer. Additionally, countries should promote technological innovation in agriculture and intensify research and development of low-carbon energy (Irfan et\u00a0 al. 2021c; Irfan et\u00a0 al. 2021d). In the process of promoting modern agriculture, on the basis of the development of ecological agriculture, organic agriculture, and circular agriculture, the application of low-carbon agricultural technology should be actively promoted. However, due to the complexity of multi-regional input\u2013output database construction, the latest data of Eora database is only updated to 2016, so subsequent scholars can continue to track and update relative research.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11356- 022- 22337-w.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful for anonymous reviewers for the helpful comments.\nAuthor contribution Fan Zhang: conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis.
