    "abstractText": "Non-dictatorial preference domains allow the design of unanimous social choice functions (henceforth, rules) that are non-dictatorial and strategy-proof. On a class of preference domains called unidimensional domains, we show that the unique seconds property (introduced by Aswal, Chatterji, and Sen, 2003) characterizes all non-dictatorial domains. Subsequently, we provide an exhaustive classification of all non-dictatorial, unidimensional domains, based on a simple property of two-voter rules called invariance. The domains constituting the classification are semi-single-peaked domains (introduced by Chatterji, Sanver, and Sen, 2013) and semi-hybrid domains (introduced here) which are two appropriate weakenings of single-peaked domains and shown to allow strategy-proof rules to depend on non-peak information of voters\u2019 preferences; the canonical strategy-proof rules for these domains are projection rules and hybrid rules respectively. As a refinement of the classification, single-peaked domains and hybrid domains emerge as the only unidimensional domains that force strategy-proof rules to be determined completely by preference peaks.",

In this paper, we restrict attention to the\nvoting model, where the large literature notwithstanding1, a comprehensive classification of\nall non-dictatorial domains in terms of the design opportunities they afford has remained\nelusive, and where in particular, not much is known about the structure of preference do-\nmains that allow strategy-proof rules to vary with non-peak information on preferences.\nSingle-peaked domains are the most prominent instance of non-dictatorial domains in\nthe voting model and are widely applied to models in public good provision, electoral com-\npetition, location theory among others. A natural question that recent literature has made\nprogress on is whether the full force of single-peakedness is needed to guarantee the exis-\ntence of strategy-proof rules. It is known that a particular weakening of single-peakedness,\nsemi-single-peakedness introduced by Chatterji et al. (2013), is compatible with strategy-\nproofness and two other attractive axioms. The first of these is anonymity, an axiom that\nspreads power evenly across voters and is hence in a sense the polar opposite of dictatorship.\nThe second is the tops-only property which asserts that the rule is completely determined\nby the peaks of the voters preferences.2 But there are presumably other ways of relaxing\nsingle-peakedness than semi-single-peakedness, which may remain compatible with strategy-\nproofness but not with anonymity. Moreover, are there other instances of non-dictatorial\ndomains that are significantly different from single-peaked domains in their underlying de-\nscription, but that allow strategy-proof rules to vary with non-peak information on voters\u2019\npreferences and consequently afford very different design opportunities? These questions\nlie at the heart of the theory of incentives since they follow naturally from the Gibbard-\nSatterthwaite Theorem (Gibbard, 1973; Satterthwaite, 1975), and are evidently important\nfrom the practical standpoint of applying the theory to the actual design of mechanisms.\nThese are the sort of questions this paper is concerned with. We identify three variants of\nsingle-peakedness which along with single-peakedness constitute an exhaustive classification\nof non-dictatorial domains (that satisfy a condition called unidimensionality) and specify\nproperties of canonical strategy-proof rules that they admit."

            "text": "We briefly introduce single-peaked preferences and three variants here. These require an\nunderlying tree on the alternatives. However, for ease of presentation, we assume hence-\nforth that all alternatives are exogenously located on a line, i.e., a tree that linearly orders\nall alternatives, say LA = (a1, . . . , am).3 A preference is single-peaked on the line LA, if there exists a top-ranked alternative, called the peak, such that the preference declines on\n1The literature is taken up in Section 5.1. 2Rules that possess the tops-only property are easier to describe and operationalize. 3The original definition of single-peaked preferences hypothesized a linear order on alternatives, which\nwas subsequently generalized to single-peakedness on a tree by Demange (1982). Trees expand the class of\nmodels to which the theory can be applied. More importantly, the versions formulated on trees are the ones\nthat arise as necessary conditions in our formulation.\neach side of the peak when alternatives moves farther away from the peak (see Figure 1(a)).\nA hybrid preference weakens the single-peakedness restriction by letting the relative rank-\nings of alternatives clustered in a fixed interval of the line be more permissive. First, two\ndistinct alternatives, called dual-thresholds, are exogenously fixed on the line LA, say ap, aq and 1 \u2264 p < q \u2264 m, which separate the line LA into the left interval between a1 and ap, the middle interval between ap and aq, and the right interval between aq and am. In\na hybrid preference, the conventional single-peakedness restriction only prevails on the left\nand right intervals (see Figure 1(b) and Figure 1(c)), while all alternatives in the middle\ninterval are arbitrarily ranked subject to an additional condition: if the preference peak is\nlocated to the left of ap (respectively, the right of aq), then ap (respectively, aq) is the best\nalternative within the middle interval (see Figure 1(b)). On the other hand, the notion\nof semi-single-peakedness weakens single-peakedness differently. Instead of dual-thresholds,\none alternative ak\u0304, called a threshold, is exogenously fixed. In a semi-single-peaked preference, the conventional single-peakedness restriction only prevails on the \u201cmiddle\u201d interval\nbetween the peak and the threshold, while any alternative not in this interval is ranked\nbelow its projection on the interval in an arbitrary manner (see Figure 1(d)). Finally, we\ngenerate a semi-hybrid preference by weakening the single-peakedness restriction imposed\non a hybrid preference to semi-single-peakedness. According to the dual-thresholds ap and aq on the line LA, a semi-hybrid preference whose preference peak is located to the left of ap, is first semi-single-peaked on the line LA w.r.t. the threshold ap, and moreover ranks aq above all alternatives in the right interval (see Figure 1(e)). A symmetric condition holds\nwhen the peak is located to the right of aq. A semi-hybrid preference that has the peak\nlocated in the middle interval between ap and aq is significantly less restrictive, as it only\nrequires the dual-thresholds ap and aq to be top-ranked within the left and right intervals\nrespectively (see Figure 1(f)).\nSingle-peaked preferences were initially introduced by Black (1948) towards resolving\nthe Condorcet paradox and have since become the cornerstone of modern political econ-\nomy, aggregation theory, social choice theory and mechanism design theory. Semi-single-\npeakedness significantly weakens the restriction of single-peakedness, but suffices for sus-\ntaining a strategy-proof rule that satisfies anonymity and the tops-only property in the\naforementioned formulations. Hybrid preferences can naturally arise in a multidimensional\nstrategic voting model, when a voter aggregates her multidimensional assessments over the\nsame set of candidates to formulate a one-dimensional preference (see Section 4 of Reffgen,\n2015), or when a voter\u2019s multidimensional preference is reduced to a one-dimensional prefer-\nence under voting constraints of Barbera\u0300 et al. (1997). Hybrid preferences may also emerge\nnaturally in the public good allocation environment. This paper introduces semi-hybrid\npreferences as a significant weakening of the hybridness requirement and thereby expands\nthe scope of design in these formulations.\nWe recall and adapt the intuitive introduction of hybrid preferences in the introduction\nof Chatterji et al. (2022) to illustrate the relevance of semi-hybrid preferences in the public\ngood allocation environment. Imagine a region where an urban zone stands in the center\nand is surrounded by a large suburban area. A railway connects two towns in the suburban\narea, and goes through the central urban zone. Each station represents a possible location\nfor allocating a good public facility, like a sports complex. Two particular stations (see for\ninstance ap and aq in Figure 1(e)) in the central urban zone separate the whole railway into\nthree intervals; all stations lying in the middle interval (e.g., the interval between ap and aq in Figure 1(e)) are in the central urban zone and hence called urban stations, while each\nstation in one of the two other intervals (e.g., the interval left to ap and the interval right to\naq in Figure 1(e)) is in the suburban area and hence called a suburban station. The central\nurban zone also possesses a modern metro transportation system that fully connects all ur-\nban stations and complements the railway, whereas all suburban stations are only connected\nvia the railway. Thus, the two particular stations can be viewed as two transportation hubs\nthat serve as gates to the respective suburban zones. A citizen living nearby a suburban\nstation formulates her preference over all locations according to the following two principles:\n(i) any suburban station beyond the distant transportation hub is not acceptable, and (ii)\nall stations between her own location and the distant transportation hub are compared ac-\ncording to the distance measured by both the railway and the metro. Thus, the citizen\u2019s\npreference must be semi-hybrid on the locations along the railway w.r.t. the two transporta-\ntion hubs: single-peakedness prevails on the interval between her location and the proximate\ntransportation hub, the proximate transportation hub is ranked above any other urban sta-\ntions, and the distant transportation hub is better than all suburban stations beyond (see\nthe preference in Figure 1(e)). Similarly, a citizen living in the central urban zone does not\naccept any suburban station, and has arbitrary preferences on all urban stations that differ\nfrom her peak. This indicates that the citizen also has a semi-hybrid preference (see the\npreference in Figure 1(f)).\nIt is well known from the seminal work Moulin (1980) that all anonymous, tops-only\nand strategy-proof rules on the domain of all single-peaked preferences are characterized\nto be phantom voter rules. The domain of all semi-single-peaked preferences admits an\nanonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, called a projection rule (see Definition 7 in\nSection 3.3), which is indeed the phantom voter rule that fixes all phantom voters\u2019 ballots\nto be the threshold. Recently, Chatterji et al. (2013) showed that semi-single-peakedness\nis also necessary for the existence of an anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule on\na class of rich domains. We introduce here a fairness property of two-voter rules called\ninvariance which is substantially weaker than anonymity in that it pertains to the behavior\nof the rule at exactly two preference profiles - invariance requires the SCF to choose the same\nsocial outcome at two test preference profiles where the two voters are endowed with two\ncompletely reversed preferences. We note that on both the domain of all hybrid preferences\nand the domain of all semi-hybrid preferences, invariance is incompatible with any two-voter,\ntops-only and strategy-proof rule. Indeed, the relative rankings of alternatives in the middle\npart are too permissive, and consequently every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule\nbehaves like a dictatorship on the middle interval (see for instance a hybrid rule in Definition\n8 of Section 3.3) and is accordingly incompatible with invariance.4 We accordingly conclude\nthat preserving single-peakedness on the middle region (as is the case with semi-single peaked\npreferences) is critical for the existence of invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rules, and\nprovide a characterization of all such rules as projection rules.\nWe now turn to the second theme. Note first that the domain of all single-peaked prefer-\nences is strictly included in the domain of all semi-single-peaked preferences. We introduce a\nnotion called a critical spot to formally address the flexibility embedded in a domain of semi-\nsingle-peaked preferences, and show that its presence is necessary and sufficient in avoiding\nthe reduction of a domain of semi-single-peaked preferences to a domain of single-peaked\npreferences (see Section 4.3). Now, starting with a domain of single-peaked preferences,\nas we add non-single-peaked preferences to move towards a domain of semi-single-peaked\npreferences, the set of anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rules of course shrinks5,\nbut more importantly these non-single-peaked preferences create space for the emergence of\nstrategy-proof rules that utilize non-peak information on voters\u2019 preferences. We show that\ncritical spots turn out to be sufficient for the existence of non-tops-only and strategy-proof\nrules. Analogously, critical spots are also embedded in a domain of semi-hybrid preferences,\ndistinguish the domain from a domain of hybrid preferences, and support the design of non-\ntops-only and strategy-proof rules. Thus, while semi-single-peaked and semi-hybrid prefer-\nences are more permissive (which is desirable for applications of mechanism design), they do\nhowever admit non-tops-only and strategy-proof rules which make the task confronting the\ndesigner, namely that of characterizing and choosing among rules, correspondingly harder,\nas a full characterization of strategy-proof rules then depends delicately on how the domain\nis expanded."

These\ndomains satisfy path-connectedness6, a condition called diversity which requires the presence\n4More specifically, consider the domain of all hyrid/semi-hybrid preferences on the line LA w.r.t. the dualthresholds ap and aq in Figure 1(b) or 1(e). It is clear that the domain contains two completely reversed preferences where a1 and am are respectively top-ranked. Given a two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, assume w.l.o.g. that voter 1 dictates on the middle interval. Then, at the test profile where voter 1\u2019s\npreference peak is a1 and voter 2\u2019s peak is am, in view of voter 1\u2019s dictatorship on the middle interval and strategy-proofness, the social outcome must lie in the interval between a1 and ap, while at the other test profile, the social outcome lies in the interval between aq and am. Therefore, the SCF violates invariance. 5In most cases, only the projection rule in the class of phantom voter rules survives according to the\ncharacterization result of Bonifacio and Masso\u0301 (2020). 6This is a \u201crichness\u201d condition that is formulated as a connectedness property of a graph on the set\nof two completely reversed preferences, and a technical condition called leaf symmetry.7 We\nfirst show that a unidimensional domain is a non-dictatorial domain if and only if it satisfies\nthe unique seconds property of Aswal et al. (2003) (see the Auxiliary Proposition in Section\n4.1); in particular, for any domain satisfying the unique seconds property, we construct a\nstrategy-proof rule that is \u201calmost\u201d dictatorial (see Section 4.1).\nWe subsequently focus on the non-dictatorial domains identified above and explore more\nmeaningful non-dictatorial strategy-proof rules than almost dictatorships. This indeed re-\nquires us to investigate the details of the structure of non-dictatorial domains from a global\nperspective that goes well beyond the unique seconds property. We proceed by investigat-\ning the existence and non-existence of an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule on a\nnon-dictatorial, unidimensional domain. Theorem 1 in Section 4.2 provides the following\nclassification of non-dictatorial, unidimensional domains: semi-single-peakedness restriction\nis necessary and sufficient for the existence of an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof\nrule, and furthermore all such rules are two-voter projection rules, while semi-hybridness is\nnecessary and sufficient for the non-existence of an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof\nrule, and furthermore every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule is a hybrid rule that\nrestricted to the middle interval behaves like a dictatorship. We further use this result to\nextend the classification to the case of n-voter SCFs by replacing invariance by anonymity\n(see Corollary 1 in Section 4.2). To sum up, the existence of a two-voter, tops-only and\nstrategy-proof rule satisfying invariance on unidimensional domains leads to a comprehen-\nsive classification of the design possibilities for such domains. The resulting classification\nmay be seen as reinforcing the view that appropriate weakenings of single-peakedness char-\nacterize non-dictatorial domains, addressing thereby a long standing conjecture in this field\n(see Section 6.5.2 in Barbera\u0300, 2011 and Section 4.5 in Barbera\u0300 et al., 2020).\nFinally, we specialize to tops-only domains, i.e., domains where all strategy-proof rules\nare endogenously tops-only rules. It is evident that a tops-only domain can never accommo-\ndate a critical spot (which ensures the existence of a non-tops-only and strategy-proof rule).\nAccordingly, we refine the aforementioned classification by showing that on a non-dictatorial,\ntops-only, unidimensional domain, the existence of an anonymous and strategy-proof rule\nleads us to a classical domain of single-peaked preferences, while its non-existence, to a\ndomain of hybrid preferences (see Corollary 1 in Section 4.4).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we specify the model. In Section 3,\nwe formally introduce all preferences domains. All results are presented in Section 4, while\nSection 5 contains a review of the literature and some final remarks. All proofs are gathered\nin an Appendix."

We call a and b dual-thresholds in T A (see Figure 2).13 According to the vertices x and y in Figure 2, we have the subtree T Ax\u21c0y , the interval \u3008x, y|T A\u3009 and the subtree T Ay\u21c0x , which in combination however does not recover the tree T A as the branch attached to the interior of the interval \u3008x, y|T A\u3009 is not covered. Hence, x and y are not dual-thresholds. Also note that x is a leaf of the subtree T Ax\u21c0y , whereas y is not a leaf of the subtree T Ay\u21c0x .\nWe conclude this section by adopting the terminology of a connected graph to represent\na connected domain. Given a domain D, we construct a graph GA\u223c = \u3008A, EA\u223c\u3009, called an adjacency graph, where the vertex set is A, and two alternatives form an edge if and\nonly if they are adjacent, i.e., EA\u223c = {(a, b) \u2208 A2 : a \u223c b}. Then, it is clear that D is a path-connected domain if and only if GA\u223c is a connected graph. Given x \u2208 A, let NA\u223c (x) = {y \u2208 A : (x, y) \u2208 EA\u223c} collect all neighbors of x in the adjacency graph GA\u223c."

In a semi-single-peaked preference, the full force of single-peakedness\nonly prevails on the relative rankings of alternatives located in the interval between the\npreference peak and the threshold x\u0304, while an alternative elsewhere is only required to be\nranked below its projection on the interval between the preference peak and the threshold\nx\u0304 (e.g., recall Figure 1(d)).\n15The notation \u3008a\u0302, b\u0302 \u2223\u2223T\u0302 A\u3009 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 here only concerns the inclusion relation between the two subsets of\nalternatives, not the inclusion relation between the two graphs of intervals. 16We impose \u2223\u2223\u3008a, b|T A\u3009\u2223\u2223 \u2265 3 to avoid the case that a hybrid domain reduces to a single-peaked domain.\nDefinition 4 (Chatterji, Sanver, and Sen (2013)) Fixing a tree T A and a threshold x\u0304 \u2208 A, a preference Pi is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. x\u0304 if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n(i) for all distinct a, b \u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), x\u0304|T A\u3009, [ a \u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), b|T A\u3009 ] \u21d2 [a Pi b], and\n(ii) for all a /\u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), x\u0304|T A\u3009, [ Proj ( a, \u3008r1(Pi), x\u0304|T A\u3009 ) = a\u2032 ] \u21d2 [a\u2032 Pi a].\nLet DSSP(T A, x\u0304) denote the semi-single-peaked domain of all semi-single-peaked preferences on T A w.r.t. x\u0304.\nThe semi-single-peaked domain DSSP(T A, x\u0304) is path-connected as its adjacency graph coincides with T A, and it satisfies diversity if and only if |NA(x\u0304)| \u2264 2 (see Clarification 1 in Appendix G). Moreover, it is clear that DSP(T A) = \u2229x\u0304\u2208ADSSP(T A, x\u0304).\nTo establish a semi-hybrid preference, we fix dual-thresholds a and b in a tree T A. A semi-hybrid preference, whose preference peak is located in the subtree T Aa\u21c0b , is semi-singlepeaked on T A w.r.t. a, and in addition ranks b above all other alternatives of Ab\u21c0a (e.g., recall Figure 1(e)). Analogous conditions are imposed on a semi-hybrid preference with the peak located in T Ab\u21c0a . Otherwise, the preference peak is located between a and b, and then a and b are required to be top-ranked within Aa\u21c0b and Ab\u21c0a respectively (e.g., recall Figure\n1(f)). Thus, a semi-hybrid preference is significantly more permissive than its counterpart\nhybrid preference which follows the full restriction of single-peakedness on both subtrees T Aa\u21c0b and T Ab\u21c0a .\nDefinition 5 Fixing a tree T A and dual-thresholds a, b \u2208 A, a preference Pi is (a, b)semi-hybrid on T A if it satisfies the following three conditions:\n(i) [ r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} ] \u21d2 [ Pi is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. a and maxPi(Ab\u21c0a) = b ] ,\n(ii) [ r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} ] \u21d2 [ Pi is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. b and maxPi(Aa\u21c0b) = a ] , and\n(iii) [ r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 ] \u21d2 [ maxPi(Aa\u21c0b) = a and maxPi(Ab\u21c0a) = b ] .\nLet DSH(T A, a, b) denote the semi-hybrid domain of all (a, b)-semi-hybrid preferences on T A.\nThe semi-hybrid domain DSH(T A, a, b) is a path-connected domain as its adjacency graph includes T A as a subgraph. More specifically, the adjacency graph of DSH(T A, a, b) is a combination of the adjacency subgraph GA a\u21c0b\n\u223c , which coincides with the subtree T A a\u21c0b , the\nadjacency subgraph over the set \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, denoted G\u3008a,b|T A\u3009\u223c , which is a complete subgraph, and the adjacency subgraph GA b\u21c0a\n\u223c , which coincides with the subtree T A b\u21c0a (see Clarification\n2 in Appendix G). The semi-hybrid domain DSH(T A, a, b) satisfies diversity if and only if we have [Aa\u21c0b 6= {a}] \u21d2 [a \u2208 Leaf(T Aa\u21c0b)] and [Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}] \u21d2 [b \u2208 Leaf(T Ab\u21c0a)] (see Clarification 2 in Appendix G). Note that when \u2223\u2223\u3008a, b|T A\u3009\u2223\u2223 = 2, we have DSH(T A, a, b) = DSSP(T A, a) \u2229 DSSP(T A, b), and when \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 = A, all three conditions in Definition 5\nbecome ineffective and impose no restriction on the preference, and consequently the semi-\nhybrid domain expands to the universal domain, i.e., DSH(T A, a, b) = P.17 Moreover, it is obvious that DH(T A, a, b) \u2286 DSH(T A, a, b), where the equality holds if and only if |Aa\u21c0b| \u2264 2 and |Ab\u21c0a| \u2264 2.\nDefinition 6 A domain D is called a semi-single-peaked domain if there exist a tree T A and a threshold x\u0304 \u2208 A such that D \u2286 DSSP(T A, x\u0304), and GA\u223c is a connected graph. A domain D is called a semi-hybrid domain if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n(i) there exist a tree T A and dual-thresholds a, b \u2208 A such that D \u2286 DSH(T A, a, b), and GA\u223c is a connected graph, 18\n(ii) there exist no tree T\u0302 A and dual-thresholds a\u0302, b\u0302 \u2208 A such that D \u2286 DSH(T\u0302 A, a\u0302, b\u0302) and \u3008a\u0302, b\u0302 \u2223\u2223T\u0302 A\u3009 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009,19 and (iii) if GA\u223c is a tree, then for each x \u2208 Leaf ( G\u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ) , there exists a preference Pi \u2208 D such\nthat Pi is not semi-single-peaked on G A \u223c w.r.t. x. 20\nWe call the interval \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 here the free zone. To highlight the tree T A and the dualthresholds a and b, we further call D an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on T A. In particular, D is said to be non-degenerate if Aa\u21c0b 6= {a} or Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}, and degenerate otherwise.\nWe provide an example to illustrate a semi-hybrid domain.\nExample 1 Let A = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}. We specify a domain D1 of 12 preferences in Table 1 that are all (a2, a5)-semi-hybrid on the line LA. The line LA, interval \u3008a2, a5|LA\u3009, adjacency graph GA\u223c and adjacency subgraph G \u3008a2,a5|LA\u3009 \u223c are all specified in Figure 3, respectively. One can immediately notice the difference between the interval \u3008a2, a5|LA\u3009 and the adjacency subgraph G\u3008a2,a5|L\nA\u3009 \u223c in Figure 3.\n17This indicates that not all the semi-hybrid domains are non-dictatorial domains. 18This condition implies that the adjacency graph GA\u223c is a combination of G Aa\u21c0b \u223c that coincides with the subtree T Aa\u21c0b , the connected adjacency subgraph G\u3008a,b|T A\u3009\u223c that may be different from the interval \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 in T A (see Example 1), and GAb\u21c0a\u223c that coincides with the subtree T A b\u21c0a\n. 19Note that any arbitrary domain is contained in DSH(LA, a1, am). Condition (ii) is not content with information delivered by (a1, am)-semi-hybridness on LA, but seeks to push the middle interval to its minimal form to reveal the key preference restrictions via the notion of semi-hybridness, which in return guides the\ndesign of strategy-proof rules. 20Note that if GA\u223c is a tree, condition (i) implies that the subgraph G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is also a tree. This condition implies |\u3008a, b|T A\u3009| \u2265 3. More importantly, it in conjunction with condition (ii) ensures that a semi-hybrid domain satisfying diversity is never a semi-single-peaked domain (see Lemma 12 in Appendix B).\nDomain D1 is a path-connected domain as indicated by the adjacency graph GA\u223c of Figure 3, and satisfies diversity according to the preferences P1 and P12 in Table 1. Next, we check whether D1 is an (a2, a5)-semi-hybrid domain on LA. Clearly, condition (i) of Definition 5 is satisfied: D1 \u2282 DSH(LA, a2, a5), and GA\u223c is a connected graph. We next claim that condition (ii) of Definition 5 holds. Suppose by contradiction that there exist a tree T\u0302 A and dual-thresholds a\u0302, b\u0302 \u2208 A such that D1 \u2286 DSH(T\u0302 A, a\u0302, b\u0302) and \u3008a\u0302, b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u2282 \u3008a2, a5|LA\u3009. Let A\u0302a\u0302\u21c0b\u0302 = { a \u2208 A : a\u0302 \u2208 \u3008a, b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 } and A\u0302b\u0302\u21c0a\u0302 = { a \u2208 A : b\u0302 \u2208 \u3008a, a\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 } . According to the connected graph GA\u223c in Figure 3 and the contradictory hypothesis, we know that G \u3008a\u0302,b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u223c must be a connected graph and strictly nested in G\u3008a2,a5|L A\u3009\n\u223c in Figure 3. Then, one of the\nfollowing five cases must occur: (1) a\u0302 = a2, b\u0302 = a4 and G \u3008a\u0302,b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u223c = (a2, a4, a3), 21 (2) a\u0302 = a4, b\u0302 = a5 and G \u3008a\u0302,b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u223c = (a3, a4, a5), (3) a\u0302 = a2, b\u0302 = a4 and G \u3008a\u0302,b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u223c = (a2, a4), (4) a\u0302 = a4, b\u0302 = a5 and G \u3008a\u0302,b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u223c = (a4, a5), and (5) a\u0302 = a4, b\u0302 = a3 and G \u3008a\u0302,b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u223c = (a4, a3). In each case, note that a1 \u2208 A\u0302a\u0302\u21c0b\u0302\\{a\u0302}. Then, by (a\u0302, b\u0302)-semi-hybridness on T\u0302 A, we know that in each one of the first four cases, a4 must be ranked above a5 in every preference with\nthe peak a1, which contradicts P2 in Table 1, while in the fifth case, a4 must be ranked\nabove a3 in every preference with the peak a1, which contradicts P1 in Table 1. Last, we notice that condition (iii) of Definition 5 is violated, since GA\u223c is a tree, a2 is a leaf of G\u3008a2,a5|L A\u3009\n\u223c , and all preferences in Table 1 are semi-single-peaked on G A \u223c w.r.t. a2. Note that if we add a preference P13 = (a5 a3 a2 a1 a4 a6), which is also (a2, a5)-semi-hybrid on LA, the new domain D\u03021 = D1 \u222a {P13} satisfies condition (iii) of Definition 5, and hence becomes an (a2, a5)-semi-hybrid domain on LA.22"

Furthermore, Corollary 1 of Bonifacio and Masso\u0301 (2020) implies that when an additional condition is\nimposed on the location of the threshold, that is, x\u0304 is never a neighbor to a leaf of T A, i.e., NA(x\u0304)\u2229Leaf(T A) = \u2205, the projection rule on T A w.r.t. x\u0304 is the unique anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof SCF admitted by the semi-single-peaked domain DSSP(T A, x\u0304).23\nThe second tops-only rule is the hybrid rule, which can be viewed as a variant of the\nprojection rule. Given a tree T A, we fix some dual-thresholds a, b \u2208 A. Moreover, a particular voter i \u2208 N is fixed in advance. Taking an arbitrary preference profile P as an example, the hybrid rule first detects whether voter i\u2019s preference peak r1(Pi) is located in the interval \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, or the subtree T Aa\u21c0b , or the subtree T Ab\u21c0a . Then, in the first case, r1(Pi) is selected by the hybrid rule as the social outcome, while in the second case\n(respectively, the third case), the social outcome changes to the projection of a (respectively,\nb) on the minimal subtree T \u0393(P ).\nDefinition 8 An SCF f : Dn \u2192 A is a hybrid rule if there exist a tree T A, dualthresholds a, b \u2208 A with |\u3008a, b|T A\u3009| \u2265 3, and a voter i \u2208 N such that for all P \u2208 Dn,\nf(P ) =  r1(Pi) if r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, Proj ( a, T \u0393(P ) ) if r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, and Proj ( b, T \u0393(P ) ) if r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}.\nTo highlight the tree T A and the dual-thresholds a and b, we further call f an (a, b)-hybrid rule on T A.\nIt is easy to show that given a tree T A and dual-thresholds a, b \u2208 A, an (a, b)-hybrid rule on T A is a tops-only and strategy-proof rule on a domain D \u2286 DSH(T A, a, b) (see Clarification 3 in Appendix G).24 Clearly, an (a, b)-hybrid rule on a tree T A behaves like a dictatorship on the interval \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, and it becomes a dictatorship when the interval \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 expands to the whole alternative set. Therefore, an (a, b)-hybrid rule on T A is never anonymous. Moreover, note that the two peaks of the completely reversed preferences,\nby the restriction of (a, b)-semi-hybridness on a tree T A, can never be both in Aa\u21c0b (or both in Ab\u21c0a). Consequently, a two-voter (a, b)-hybrid rule on T A must choose distinct social outcomes at the two profiles where the two voters are endowed with the two completely\nreversed preferences, and hence violates invariance.\n23Further investigation on projection rules can be found in Thomson (1993) and Vohra (1999). 24Proposition 3 of Chatterji and Zeng (2020) characterizes all tops-only and strategy-proof rules on the\nsemi-hybrid domain DSH(T A, a, b), given |Aa\u21c0b| 6= 2 and |Ab\u21c0a| 6= 2."

Given a leaf of the adjacency graph GA\u223c, say x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c), it is evident that |S(Dx)| \u2265 1. More specifically, we know that either S(Dx) is a singleton set of x\u2019s unique neighbor in GA\u223c, which implies |S(Dx)| = 1, or S(Dx) contains some alternative other than the unique neighbor of x, which implies |S(Dx)| > 1. We then introduce a technical richness condition called leaf symmetry to handle each leaf in the second case. Formally, domain D is said to satisfy leaf symmetry if for each x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c) with |S(Dx)| > 1, there exists z \u2208 S(Dx) such that z /\u2208 NA\u223c (x) and x \u2208 S(Dz).25 Henceforth, we call a domain a unidimensional domain if it satisfies path-connectedness, diversity and leaf symmetry.\nRemark 1 A single-peaked domain satisfies leaf symmetry vacuously.26 A hybrid/semi-\nhybrid domain satisfies leaf symmetry vacuously if its adjacency subgraph on the free zone\nhas no leaf.27 A semi-single-peaked domain D \u2286 DSSP(T A, x\u0304) satisfies leaf symmetry if and only if either x\u0304 /\u2208 Leaf(T A), or x\u0304 \u2208 Leaf(T A) and D \u2286 DSSP(T A, x\u0304) \u2229 DSSP(T A, x) where NA(x\u0304) = {x} (see Clarification 4 in Appendix G).\nRemark 2 Many preference domains studied in the literature are unidimensional domains,\ne.g., the universal domain, some linked domains of Aswal et al. (2003)28, the single-peaked\n25If Leaf(GA\u223c) = \u2205, or Leaf(GA\u223c) 6= \u2205 and |S(Dx)| = 1 for all x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c), domain D satisfies leaf symmetry vacuously. Under leaf symmetry, given x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c), NA\u223c (x) = {y} and |S(Dx)| > 1, we have some z \u2208 A\\{x, y} and Pi, P \u2032i \u2208 D such that r1(Pi) = r2(Pi) = x and r1(P \u2032i ) = r2(Pi) = z. This indicates that x and z form an edge analogous to, but weaker than the edge of adjacency. Furthermore, by pathconnectedness, we have a path (x1, . . . , xv) in G A \u223c connecting x and z. Since NA\u223c (x) = {y}, it must be the case that y = x2. Thus, by combining the path (x1, . . . , xv) and the \u201cweaker edge\u201d between x and z, we formulate a cycle, which, analogous to a circular domain of Sato (2010), ensures that all strategy-proof rules behave like dictatorships on the set {x, y, z} (see Lemma 3 in Appendix A). 26Given a single-peaked domain D \u2286 DSP(T A), since GA\u223c = T A, the restriction of single-peakedness implies |S(Dx)| = 1 for all x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c). 27Given an (a, b)-hybrid/semi-hybrid domain D on a tree T A, let Leaf(GA\u223c) 6= \u2205 and Leaf ( G\u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ) = \u2205. Clearly, A 6= \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Thus, we have one of the following three cases: (i) Aa\u21c0b 6= {a} and Ab\u21c0a = {b} which imply Leaf(GA\u223c) = Leaf(T A)\\{b}, (ii) Aa\u21c0b = {a} and Ab\u21c0a 6= {b} which imply Leaf(GA\u223c) = Leaf(T A)\\{a}, or (iii) Aa\u21c0b 6= {a} and Ab\u21c0a 6= {b} which imply Leaf(GA\u223c) = Leaf(T A). Then, by the restriction of (a, b)-hybridness/semi-hybridness on T A, we have |S(Dx)| = 1 for all x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c). In Example 3 behind, we provide an example of a semi-hybrid domain that violates leaf symmetry.\n28Aswal et al. (2003) introduced a notion between two alternatives, which we call weak adjacency. Formally, two alternatives a and b are said weakly adjacent, denoted a b, if there exist Pi, P \u2032i \u2208 D such that r1(Pi) = r2(P \u2032 i ) = a and r1(P \u2032 i ) = r2(Pi) = b. It is clear that weak adjacency is significantly less demanding than the notion of adjacency. Accordingly, a domain D is said weakly path-connected, if the weak adjacency graph GA = \u3008A, EA \u3009, where two alternatives formulate an edge if and only if they are weakly adjacent, is a connected graph. It is clear that GA\u223c \u2286 GA . Aswal et al. (2003) showed that a linked domain, i.e., all alternatives are able to be relabeled as a1, . . . , am such that a1 a2 and for each k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}, ak as and ak at for some distinct s, t \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, is a dictatorial domain.

More generally, the class of\nno-restoration domains of Sato (2013) that satisfies minimal richness and diversity are uni-\ndimensional domains (implied by Theorem 1 of Chatterji et al. (2022)).29 The single-peaked\ndomain on a tree (not a line) of Demange (1982) satisfies path-connectedness and leaf sym-\nmetry, but is excluded by the class of unidimensional domains due to the violation of di-\nversity. The class of unidimensional domains also excludes multidimensional domains, like\nthe (inclusion/exclusion) separable domain of Barbera\u0300 et al.

(1993), the separable domain of Le Breton and Sen\n(1999) and the top-separable domain of Le Breton and Weymark (1999), as they all fail to\nsatisfy path-connectedness.30\nAswal et al. (2003) introduced the unique seconds property on a domain D, which says that there exists x \u2208 A such that |S(Dx)| = 1, and showed that it is sufficient for D to be a non-dictatorial domain (also see the inseparable top-pair property of Kalai and Ritz (1980)).\nThe Auxiliary Proposition shows that the unique seconds property is also necessary, provided\nthat path-connectedness and leaf symmetry hold.

In\n29No-restoration is not only concerned with the richness of a domain, but also ensures that all preferences in\na domain are well organized: given two preferences and two alternatives, one given preference is transformed\nto the other via a sequence of preferences in the domain that switches two contiguously ranked alternative\nacross each pair of consecutive preferences, and moreover the relative ranking of the two given alternatives\nis switched at most once. Chatterji et al. (2022) show that a domain satisfying minimal richness, norestoration and diversity is either a single-peaked domain on LA, or a hybrid domain LA such that the adjacency subgraph on the free zone has no leaf. Path-connectedness significantly weakens no-restoration,\nso as to accommodate more permissive preference restrictions that are the main concern of this paper. 30More specifically, the notion of adjacency is not applicable on each one of these multidimensional do-\nmains, since no two alternatives are adjacent. We intensionally adopt the notion of adjacency to introduce\nthe terminology \u201cunidimensionality\u201d so as to exclude these multidimensional domains from our analysis. In\nfact, the notion of weak adjacency is applicable on these multidimensional domains. However, weak adjacency is too flexible for us to explore our analysis in trackable way. For instance, give a domain D, if the adjacency graph GA\u223c is a connected graph and has no leaf, then it is a dictatorial domain (see Observation 1 in Appendix A). However, this important result fails if we replace GA\u223c by G A , since each one of these multidimensional domain has a no-leaf connected weak adjacency graph and is a non-dictatorial domain.\norder to explore the scope of designing non-dictatorial, strategy-proof rules on non-dictatorial\ndomains, we go beyond the unique seconds property, and uncover more information on\npreference restrictions that are globally obeyed by the rankings of all alternatives in all\npreferences in a domain, like single-peakedness/semi-single-peakedness and hybridness/semi-\nhybridness introduced in Section 3.\nRemark 3 All single-peaked domains, semi-single-peaked domains, non-degenerate hybrid\ndomains and non-degenerate semi-hybrid domains satisfy the unique seconds property, and\ntherefore are non-dictatorial domains. Indeed, a degenerate hybrid/semi-hybrid domain\nsometimes violates the unique second property, e.g., the adjacency graph has no leaf, and\nhence by the Auxiliary Proposition, is a dictatorial domain; when it satisfies the unique\nseconds property (see the example provided in Clarification 5 of Appendix G), it is a non-\ndictatorial domain.\nRemark 4 Roy and Storcken (2019) provide three other domain richness conditions, and\nshow that the unique seconds property is necessary and sufficient for non-dictatorial domains.\nPath-connectedness strengthens their first condition, and is more transparent and easier to\nverify than their third condition, while leaf symmetry significantly weakens their second\ncondition as it only concerns the leaves of the adjacency graph. This weakening is meaningful\nand critical to our analysis because it accommodates semi-single-peaked domains which\nhowever are ruled out by their second condition. See the detailed explanation in Clarification\n6 of Appendix G.\nWe conclude this section by addressing the indispensability of the two richness conditions\nin establishing the Auxiliary Proposition. First, all multidimensional domains mentioned\nin Remark 2 are non-dictatorial domains, but are not covered by the Auxiliary Proposition\nsince they all fail to satisfy path-connectedness. We also provide another example to show\nthe indispensability of path-connectedness, which would provide a better understand on the\nrole played by path-connectedness in establishing the Auxiliary Proposition.\nExample 2 Let A = {a, b, c, x, y, z}. We specify a domain D2 of 12 preferences in Table 2. Let B = {a, b, c}. One can easily observe that GA\u223c consists of two isolated triangles GB\u223c and GA\\B\u223c . Therefore, D2 violates path-connectedness and satisfies leaf symmetry vacuously. Next, we construct the following SCF: for all Pi, Pj \u2208 D2,\nf(Pi, Pj) = { maxPi(B) if r1(Pj) \u2208 B, and r1(Pj) otherwise.\nIt is clear that f satisfies unanimity, and is non-dictatorial. The verification of strategy-\nproofness is put in Clarification 7 of Appendix G. Note that the SCF f , supported by the isolation of GB\u223c and G A\\B \u223c , accommodates two distinct dictatorships on B and A\\B respectively, i.e., voter i dictates on B, while voter j dictates on A\\B. This contrasts the unified dictatorship established in Lemma 2 of Appendix A.\nLast, we provide a specific example to illustrate the indispensability of leaf symmetry.\nExample 3 Let A = {a, b, c, d} be allocated on a star-shape tree T A of Figure 4. We specify a domain D3 of 9 preferences in Table 3. It is easy to verify GA\u223c = T A. Therefore, D3 is a path-connected domain. We claim that D3 violates leaf symmetry. Suppose by contradiction that D3 satisfies leaf symmetry. Given a \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c), since S(Da3) = {b, d} and NA\u223c (a) = {b}, by leaf symmetry, we must induce a contradiction: a \u2208 S(Dd3) = {b, c}. Next, we construct the following SCF to illustrate that D3 is a non-dictatorial domain: for all Pi, Pj \u2208 D3,\nf(Pi, Pj) =  d if Pi = P7 and Pj \u2208 Dd3, or Pi \u2208 Dd3 and Pj = P7, a if Pi = P8 and Pj \u2208 Da3, or Pi \u2208 Da3 and Pj = P8, c if Pi = P9 and Pj \u2208 Dc3, or Pi \u2208 Dc3 and Pj = P9, and Proj ( b, \u3008r1(Pi), r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 ) otherwise.\nIt is clear that f satisfies unanimity and anonymity, and violates the tops-only property. The\nverification of strategy-proofness is put in Clarification 8 of Appendix G. Last, we observe\n|S(Dx3)| \u2265 2 for all x \u2208 A which suggests the violation of the unique seconds property."

            "text": "domains\nIn this section, we establish a classification of non-dictatorial, unidimensional domains us-\ning the notions of semi-single-peakedness and semi-hybridness via the existence and non-\nexistence respectively of an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule. The following is\nthe main result of the paper.\nTheorem 1 Let D be a non-dictatorial, unidimensional domain. Then, the following two statements hold:\n(i) There exists an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, (a) if and only if D is a semi-single-peaked domain, and (b) if and only if D admits a two-voter, strategy-proof projection rule. Furthermore, every invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule is a\nprojection rule.\n(ii) There exists no invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule if and only if D is a semihybrid domain satisfying the unique seconds property. Furthermore, every two-voter,\ntops-only and strategy-proof rule is a hybrid rule that behaves like a dictatorship on a\nweak superset of the free zone.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is contained in Appendix B.\nRemark 5 By Theorem 1 and its proof, we know that on a non-dictatorial, unidimensional\ndomain D, the set of all two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rules consists of a set of projection rules which can be either an empty set or not, and a set of hybrid rules, which\nat least includes a dictatorship (equivalently, the (a1, am)-hybrid rule on the line LA).31 Therefore, by Statement (i) of Theorem 1, whether the domain D is a semi-single-peaked domain completely depends on the existence of a two-voter, strategy-proof projection rule.\nFurthermore, if domain D turns out to be an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on a tree T A, among all two-voter, strategy-proof hybrid rules, by Statement (ii) of Theorem 1, the (a, b)-hybrid\nrule on T A is the most desirable one, as it minimizes the set of alternatives on which a dictatorship inevitably prevails.\nBy Statement (ii) of Theorem 1, we know that once a unidimensional domain is revealed\nto be a semi-hybrid domain, all two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rules behave like\ndictatorships on the free zone. We then further show via a Ramification Theorem (see the\nstatement in Appendix C) that every tops-only and strategy-proof rule with an arbitrary\nnumber of voters also behaves like a dictatorship on the free zone. This helps us strengthen\nthe classification provided in Theorem 1 which concentrates on two-voter rules and the axiom\nof invariance, by showing in the following corollary that the same classification emerges when\nwe expand to n-voter rules and replace invariance by anonymity. This also suggests that for\nthe purpose of domain classification, there is no loss of generality in restricting attention to\nthe class of two-voter, strategy-proof rules.\n31Even if the domain D turns out to be a semi-single-peaked domain, the proof of Statement (ii) still implies that every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule that violates invariance is a hybrid rule.\nCorollary 1 Let D be a non-dictatorial, unidimensional domain. Then, the following two statements hold:\n(i) There exists an anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, (a) if and only if D is a semi-single-peaked domain, and (b) if and only if D admits a strategy-proof projection rule.\n(ii) There exists no anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, if and only if D is a semi-hybrid domain satisfying the unique seconds property. Furthermore, every tops-\nonly and strategy-proof rule behaves like a dictatorship on a weak superset of the free\nzone.\nThe proof of Corollary 1 is contained in Appendix C.\nRemark 6 Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 refine the characterization of non-dictatorial domains\nobtained in the Auxiliary Proposition by showing that all non-dictatorial, unidimensional\ndomains can be classified into one of the three variants illustrated in Figure 5. First, semi-\nsingle-peaked domains are sorted out as the unique ones that admit an invariant/anonymous,\ntops-only and strategy-proof rule (indeed, a strategy-proof projection rule), while every other\nnon-dictatorial, unidimensional domain is shown to be a semi-hybrid domain, which of course\nis either non-degenerate or degenerate. Next, as the free zones of semi-hybrid domains ex-\npand towards the whole alternative set, semi-hybrid domains expand \u201ccloser to\u201d dictatorial\ndomains since every tops-only and strategy-proof rule has to behave like a dictatorship on the\nfree zone and consequently gradually degenerates to a dictatorship. Furthermore, if a non-\ndictatorial, unidimensional domain turns out to be a degenerate semi-hybrid domain (see the\nexample in Clarification 5 of Appendix G), since all tops-only and strategy-proof rules are\ndictatorships, in order to meet the non-dictatorial-domain hypothesis, the Auxiliary Propo-\nsition must mandate the imposition of the unique seconds property, and consequently the\ncorresponding admissible non-dictatorial, strategy-proof rule (recall the almost dictatorship\nspecified in Section 4.1) must violate the tops-only property.\nRemark 7 Chatterji et al. (2013) have shown that semi-single-peakedness on a path-connected\ndomain is implied by the existence of an anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule with\nan even number of voters. By mildly strengthening their richness condition, we obtain a\nsignificantly sharper result: statement (i) of Corollary 1 dispenses with their requirement on\nthe number of voters, while statement (ii) describes the complementary configuration im-\nplied by the non-existence of an anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule. Last, note\nthat when the number of voters increases more than two in Corollary 1, the set of tops-only\nand strategy-proof rules expands significantly beyond projection rules and hybrid rules char-\nacterized in Theorem 1 under the two-voter condition. Indeed, the full characterization of\ntops-only and strategy-proof rules in the case of more than two voters depends delicately on\nthe richness of a semi-single-peaked domain (see Theorem 1 of Bonifacio and Masso\u0301 (2020))\nand the richness of a semi-hybrid domain (see Proposition 3 of Chatterji and Zeng (2020))\nrespectively."

These critical\nspots vanish if and only if the domain is refined to be single-peaked (respectively, hybrid).\nWe fix a tree T A, an edge (x, y) which separates T A into two subtrees T Ax\u21c0y and T Ay\u21c0x , and two distinct voters i, j \u2208 N . The construction of a non-tops-only rule consists of three steps. First, at each preference profile, the social outcome equals voter i\u2019s most preferred\nalternative if it belongs to Ay\u21c0x. Next, if both voters i and j have their preference peaks\nin Ax\u21c0y, the social outcome is the projection of x on the minimal subtree of the preference\nprofile.

Proposition 1 below shows that the\nexistence of a critical spot is necessary and sufficient for distinguishing a semi-single-peaked\ndomain from a single-peaked domain (respectively distinguishing a semi-hybrid domain from\na hybrid domain), and therefore by Fact 1 supports a strategy-proof PNT rule that violates\nthe tops-only property. The proof is contained in Appendix E.\n32One can easily observe that the PNT rule generalizes the almost dictatorship specified in Section 4.1. Indeed, given a line L\u0302A = (x, y, . . . ), where x is a leaf and y is the unique neighbor of x, the almost dictatorship is a PNT rule on L\u0302A w.r.t. the edge (x, y).\nProposition 1 The following two statements hold:\n(i) Given a semi-single-peaked domain D on a tree T A, we have D * DSP(T A) if and only if there exists a critical spot (x, y) in T A.\n(ii) Given an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain D on a tree T A, we have D * DH(T A, a, b) if and only if there exists a critical spot (x, y) in T A such that either x, y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} or x, y \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}."

One stream of the literature examines\nthe robustness of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem by showing that some sparse restricted\ndomains (see for instance, linked domains of Aswal et al. (2003), circular domains of Sato\n(2010), FPT (Free Pair at the Top) domains of Chatterji and Sen (2011), and the \u03b2 and\n\u03b3 domains of Pramanik (2015)) are in fact dictatorial domains. These papers use richness\nassumptions on the domain variously to construct connectedness relations between alterna-\ntives, while the violation of these richness conditions appear, somewhat surprisingly, to lead\nto the unique seconds property in the sense that if the unique seconds property holds, all\nthe aforementioned richness conditions that precipitate dictatorship are violated.33 Recently,\nRoy and Storcken (2019) have shown the role of the unique seconds property in character-\nizing non-dictatorial domains. The Auxiliary Proposition here is in the same vein but uses\ndifferent richness conditions (recall Remark 4). More importantly, our focus on the classifi-\ncation of non-dictatorial domains uncovers more meaningful non-dictatorial, strategy-proof\nrules - projection rules and hybrid rules, compared to the almost dictatorship associated\nwith the unique seconds property.\nAnother stream of the literature starts with a specific restricted domain that not only\nhelps escape the Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility, but also accommodates the design of\nvarious well-behaved strategy-proof rules. Almost all such domains are variants of the notion\nof single-peakedness. On the single-peaked domain, the seminal paper Moulin (1980) char-\nacterized all anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rules as phantom voter rules, and all\ntops-only and strategy-proof rules as fixed ballot rules. In the past four decades, several key\nvariants of single-peakedness have been developed, and non-dictatorial, strategy-proof rules\nhave been explored. Demange (1982) introduced single-peakedness on a tree and Schummer\nand Vohra (2002) extended Moulin\u2019s fixed ballot rules; Barbera\u0300 et al. (1993) generalized\nsingle-peakedness from a unidimensional underlying line to a multidimensional grid, and\ndiscovered an important class of strategy-proof rules: multidimensional generalized median\nvoter rules ; Nehring and Puppe (2007) adopted a ternary relation to generally address the\ngeometric relation among alternatives, invented the notion of generalized single-peakedness,34\nand characterized all strategy-proof rules: voting by issues ; and recently, Reffgen (2015) pro-\nvided a transition from the single-peaked domain to the universal domain by taking unions of\n33This assertion can be made more precise by observing that in the case |A| = 3, any domain other than the universal domain satisfies the unique seconds property.\n34Using the terminology of Nehring and Puppe (2007), the (inclusion/exclusion) separable domain of\nBarbera\u0300 et al. (1991), the multidimensional single-peaked domain of Barbera\u0300 et al. (1993) and the separable\ndomain of Le Breton and Sen (1999) can be equivalently translated to generalized single-peaked domains\naccording to three analogous ternary relations respectively.\nmultiple single-peaked domains that are constructed according to different underlying lines,\nestablished the notion of a multiple single-peaked domain and characterized all strategy-\nproof rules as a specific subset of fixed ballot rules which simultaneously preserve features\nof a dictatorship and of a median voter rule. Two comprehensive survey papers, Sprumont\n(1995) and Barbera\u0300 (2011), provide more detailed discussions on the development of single-\npeakedness restrictions and non-dictatorial, strategy-proof rules. All preference domains\nconsidered in this literature are in fact tops-only domains. We depart from this literature\nby considering non-tops-only rules; Proposition 1 identifies a critical spot that supports a\nnon-tops-only and strategy-proof rule.\nA third stream of the literature poses the following natural \u201cconverse\u201d question: is single-\npeakedness a consequence of the existence of a well-behaved strategy-proof rule? Earlier\nliterature Barbera\u0300 et al. (1993) showed that if a minimally rich domain admits the median\nvoter rule as a strategy-proof rule, the domain must be single-peaked. Instead of consid-\nering a specific rule, Chatterji et al. (2013) established that on a path-connected domain,\nsemi-single-peakedness, rather than single-peakedness, is necessary for the existence of an\nanonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, and Chatterji and Masso\u0301 (2018) showed that\nsemilattice single-peakedness, a generalization of semi-single-peakedness, arises as a conse-\nquence of the existence of an anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule on a rich domain\n(where the richness condition is formulated relative to the particular rule that is assumed\nto exist). Recently, Barbera\u0300 et al. (2020) provide an insightful survey that covers these and\nother related issues. This literature too restricts attention to the class of strategy-proof\nrules that in addition satisfy the tops-only property and anonymity, and is therefore silent\non domains that admit tops-only and strategy-proof rules that violate anonymity but remain\nnon-dictatorial. Our classification theorem essentially demonstrates that appropriate weak-\nenings of single-peakedness35 characterizes all non-dictatorial domains, and in particular\nuncovers domains that allow the design of non-tops-only and non-anonymous rules.\nOur refinement of the classification of non-dictatorial domains provided in Corollary 2\nis also related to the literature on tops-only domains. In this literature, various restricted\ndomains have been shown to be tops-only domains (see for instance Barbera\u0300 et al., 1991,\n1993; Ching, 1997; Le Breton and Sen, 1999; Le Breton and Weymark, 1999; Nehring and\nPuppe, 2007; Weymark, 2008; Reffgen, 2015). Chatterji and Sen (2011) provided two general\nsufficient conditions for tops-only domains. Corollary 2, to our knowledge, is the first result\nthat characterizes necessary conditions for tops-only domains, and therefore reveals the\nimportant role of the full single-peakedness requirement, imposed on either the whole line,\n35Barbera\u0300 and Moreno (2011) introduced another approach of weakening single-peakedness, called top-\nmonotonicity. We briefly introduce the definition of top-monotonicity using our model here. A preference profile P is said to satisfy top-monotonicity if there exists a line L\u0302A such that for each i \u2208 N , say r1(Pi) = a, and for all distinct alternatives b, c \u2208 A where b = r1(Pj) for some j \u2208 N\\{i}, we have [ b \u2208 \u3008a, c|L\u0302A\u3009 ] \u21d2 [b Pi c]. It is clear that top-monotonicity allows some flexibility in the ranking of an alternative that is never top-ranked at any preference in the profile, and hence weakens the single-peakedness restriction. The\nrestrictions of semi-single-peakedness and semi-hybridness investigated in our paper are independent. For\ninstance, one can construct a profile of semi-single-peaked preferences that fails to meet top-monotonicity.\nThe detailed example is available on request.\nor both the left and right parts of the line, in establishing a tops-only domain.36 In a\nmodel with single-peaked preferences on the real line that accommodates indifference rela-\ntions, Barbera\u0300 and Jackson (1994) established that a strategy-proof SCF that has a non-\nconnected range can violate the tops-only property, while Weymark (2011) showed that the\nnon-connected range is necessary for the violation of the tops-only property. The non-tops-\nonly and strategy-proof rules investigated in our paper are independent of this literature as\nall strategy-proof rules studied here have a full range.\nLastly, we relate our approach to the literature characterizing Condorcet domains. Given\nminimal richness and the presence of two completely reversed preferences, Puppe (2018)\nshowed that a \u201cconnected\u201d domain (i.e., any two distinct preferences of the domain are\nconnected via a path of preferences in the domain where across each consecutive pair on the\npath, exactly two contiguously ranked alternatives are switched) is a maximal Condorcet\ndomain if and only if it is single-peaked on a line. It is clear that a Condorcet domain is a\nnon-dictatorial domain as it supports majority voting as a strategy-proof rule. However, non-\ndictatorial, strategy-proof rules can obtain in settings where the acyclicity of the majority\nrelation (that is ensured in a Condorcet domain) does not hold. Our classification theorem\nindicates that expanding the search for strategy-proof rules to settings where the acyclicity\nof the majority relation need not hold significantly enlarges the class of domains that admit\nnon-dictatorial, strategy-proof rules."

            "text": "To conclude, this paper has introduced a methodology based on the analysis of two-voter\nrules and a simple axiom (invariance) on unidimensional domains in the voting model, using\nwhich we exhaustively classify all unidimensional, non-dictatorial domains as either semi-\nsingle-peaked domains or semi-hybrid domains, which are respectively two weakenings of\nsingle-peaked domains that complement each other. This expands the possibilities for de-\nsign to models where the restriction of single-peakedness is too demanding (see for instance,\nmultidimensional voting under constraints and allocation of public goods on a transporta-\ntion network). We provide some preliminary observations on multidimensional voting in\nAppendix H, and leave its detailed exploration to future work. This methodology may also\nbe useful beyond the specific issue of classification of non-dictatorial domains that we stud-\nied here; for instance, within the voting model it could be used to explore the structure of\nlocally strategy-proof rules or ordinally Bayesian incentive compatible rules. It would be\nparticularly interesting to extend this methodology beyond the voting model to more general\nsetups that include private goods and/or monetary compensation.\n36Though Corollary 2 is concerned with non-dictatorial domains, its proof can also be adopted to show that\na dictatorial, unidimensional domain, which of course is a tops-only domain, is an (a1, am)-hybrid domain on the line LA. Conversely, Appendix E of Chatterji and Zeng (2020) shows that both single-peakedness and hybridness in conjunction with an additional technical condition on the free zone called non-trivialness,\nare sufficient for a unidimensional domain to be a tops-only domain."

            "text": "By Theorem 5.1 of Aswal et al. (2003), it is clear that if a domain satisfies the unique seconds\nproperty, it is a non-dictatorial domain. We henceforth focus on showing that given a domain D satisfying path-connectedness and leaf symmetry, if it is a non-dictatorial domain, it satisfies the\nunique seconds property. We first provide 4 important independent lemmas (Lemmas 1 - 4). For Lemmas 1 - 4, we fix N = {1, 2}, a path-connected domain D and a strategy-proof rule f : D2 \u2192 A. For ease of presentation, let ( (x \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (y \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) denote a profile where voter 1 reports an arbitrary\npreference with the peak x and voter 2 reports an arbitrary preference with the peak y.

Moreover, the third statement is analogous to the first one: given statement (i), after relabeling the path \u03c0 such that yk = xv+1\u2212k for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , v}, we modify the hypothesis of statement (iii) to f ( (y1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (y2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = f ( (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv = y1, and then apply\nstatement (i) on the path (y1, . . . , yv) to obtain f ( (yk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (yk\u2032 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = yk for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 v,\nwhich by the relabeling implies f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u2032 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk for all 1 \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k \u2264 v. Therefore, we in\nthe rest of the proof focus on the verification of the first statement.\nSince x2 \u223c x3, by Claims A and B of Sen (2001) and their proofs,37 we know that either f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x2 or f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x3 holds. Suppose f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x3. Since x1 \u223c x2 and x3 \u223c x2, we have P x1,x21 , P x2,x1 1 \u2208 D such that rk(P x1,x2 1 ) = rk(P x2,x1 1 ) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}, and P x2,x32 , P x3,x2 2 \u2208 D such that rk(P x2,x3 2 ) = rk(P x3,x2\n2 ) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}. Thus, f(P x1,x21 , P x2,x3 2 ) = x1 and f(P x2,x1 1 , P x3,x2 2 ) = x3. Then, by strategy-proofness, f(P x2,x11 , P x3,x2 2 ) = x3 implies f(P x1,x2 1 , P x3,x2 2 ) = x3. Consequently, voter 2 will manipulate at (P x1,x21 , P x2,x3 2 ) via P x3,x2 2 . Therefore, f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x2. Applying the same argument\nfrom x3 to xv step by step, we eventually have f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , v\u22121}.\nNow, we show statement (i). We pick an arbitrary l \u2208 {3, . . . , v} and provide an induction hypothesis: f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u2032 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 < l. To verify the induction hypoth-\nesis, we show f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xl \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , l}. Fix arbitrary P2 \u2208 Dxl . We first\nknow f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), P2 ) = xk for both k \u2208 {l \u2212 1, l}. We next show f ( (xl\u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), P2 ) = xl\u22122. Since xl\u22122 \u223c xl\u22121, we have P xl\u22121,xl\u22122 1 , P xl\u22122,xl\u22121 1 \u2208 D such that rk(P xl\u22121,xl\u22122 1 ) = rk(P xl\u22122,xl\u22121 1 ) for all\n37Claim A of Sen (2001) and its proof show that given a, b \u2208 A and P a,bi , P b,a i \u2208 D, we have f(P1, P2) \u2208 {a, b} for all P1 \u2208 Da and P2 \u2208 Db. Claim B of Sen (2001) and its proof show that given a, b \u2208 A and P a,bi , P b,a i \u2208 D, if f(P\u03021, P\u03022) = a (respectively, f(P\u03021, P\u03022) = b) for some P\u03021 \u2208 Da and P\u03022 \u2208 Db, then\nf ( (a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = a (respectively, f ( (a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = b). Therefore, given a, b \u2208 A with a \u223c b, either\nf ( (a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = a or f ( (a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = b holds.\nk \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}. Since f(P xl\u22121,xl\u221221 , P2) = xl\u22121, strategy-proofness implies f(P xl\u22122,xl\u22121 1 , P2) \u2208 {xl\u22121, xl\u22122}. If f(P xl\u22122,xl\u22121 1 , P2) = xl\u22121, strategy-proofness implies f ( P xl\u22122,xl\u22121 1 , (xl\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) =\nxl\u22121, which contradicts the induced fact f ( (xl\u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xl\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xl\u22122. Hence, f(P xl\u22122,xl\u22121 1 , P2) =\nxl\u22122. Then, strategy-proofness implies f ( (xl\u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), P2 ) = xl\u22122. Applying the same argument from\nxl\u22122 to x1 step by step, we eventually have f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), P2) = xk for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , l}. This com-\npletes the verification of the induction hypothesis, and hence proves the lemma.\nLemma 2 Given two subsets A\u0304, A\u0302 \u2286 A with |A\u0304| > 1 and |A\u0302| > 1, let GA\u0304\u223c and GA\u0302\u223c be two connected graphs. Given a path \u03c0 = (x1, . . . , xv) in G A \u223c, let x1 \u2208 A\u0304 and xv \u2208 A\u0302. If f behaves like a dictatorship on A\u0304 and A\u0302 respectively, then f behaves like a dictatorship on A\u0304 \u222a \u03c0 \u222a A\u0302.\nProof: We assume w.l.o.g. that voter 1 dictates on A\u0304, i.e., f(P1, P2) = r1(P1) for all P1, P2 \u2208 D with r1(P1), r1(P2) \u2208 A\u0304.\nClaim 1: Voter 1 also dictates on A\u0302, i.e., [r1(P1), r1(P2) \u2208 A\u0302]\u21d2 [f(P1, P2) = r1(P1)].\nWe first consider the case A\u0304 \u2229 A\u0302 6= \u2205. Let x \u2208 A\u0304 \u2229 A\u0302. Since GA\u0304\u223c is a connected graph and |A\u0304| > 1, there exists y \u2208 A\u0304 such that y \u223c x. Clearly, f ( (y \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = y. Symmetrically,\naccording to GA\u0302\u223c, there exists z \u2208 A\u0302 such that z \u223c x. Clearly, either y = z or y 6= z holds. If y = z, we have f ( (z \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = z, which immediately implies that voter 1 dictates on A\u0302, since f is assumed to behave like a dictatorship on A\u0302. If y 6= z, we consider the path (y, x, z). By statement (i) of Lemma 1, f ( (y \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = y implies f ( (x \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (z \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x. Last, since f behaves like a\ndictatorship on A\u0302, we infer that voter 1 dictates on A\u0302.\nNext, we assume A\u0304 \u2229 A\u0302 = \u2205. Given x1 \u2208 A\u0304 and xv \u2208 A\u0302, we can identify 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 v such that xk \u2208 A\u0304, xk\u2032 \u2208 A\u0302 and xl /\u2208 A\u0304 \u222a A\u0302 for all l \u2208 {k + 1, . . . , k\u2032 \u2212 1}. Since GA\u0304\u223c is a connected graph and |A\u0304| > 1, there exists x \u2208 A\u0304 such that x \u223c xk. Symmetrically, there exists y \u2208 A\u0302 such that y \u223c xk\u2032 . Thus, we have a path \u03c0\u2032 = (x, xk, . . . , xk\u2032 , y). Since voter 1 dictates on A\u0304, we have f ( (x \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x. Then, according to \u03c0\u2032, statement (i) of Lemma 1 implies\nf ( (xk\u2032 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (y \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk\u2032 . Moreover, since f behaves like a dictatorship on A\u0302, we infer that voter\n1 dictates on A\u0302. This completes the verification of the claim.\nClaim 2: Voter 1 dictates on \u03c0, i.e., [r1(P1), r1(P2) \u2208 \u03c0]\u21d2 [f(P1, P2) = r1(P1)]. If x2 \u2208 A\u0304, we have f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1 by voter 1\u2019s dictatorship on A\u0304. If x2 /\u2208 A\u0304, we iden-\ntify x0 \u2208 A\u0304 such that x0 \u223c x1. Clearly, x0 6= x2. Thus, we have f ( (x0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x0 by voter\n1\u2019s dictatorship on A\u0304. Then, according to the path (x0, x1, x2), statement (i) of Lemma 1 implies f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1. Overall, f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1. Then, according to \u03c0, statement (i)\nof Lemma 1 implies f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u2032 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 v. Symmetrically, by voter 1\u2019s\ndictatorship on A\u0302 and statement (iii) of Lemma 1 on \u03c0, we also induce f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u2032 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk for all 1 \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k \u2264 v. This completes the verification of the claim.\nLast, we show that voter 1 dictates on A\u0304\u222a\u03c0 \u222a A\u0302. We first show that voter 1 dictates on A\u0304\u222a\u03c0. Given arbitrary preferences P1, P2 \u2208 D, let r1(P1) = x \u2208 A\u0304 \u222a \u03c0 and r1(P2) = y \u2208 A\u0304 \u222a \u03c0. If x = y, unanimity implies f(P1, P2) = x = r1(P1). Next, assume x 6= y. Evidently, if x, y \u2208 A\u0304 or x, y \u2208 \u03c0, we have f(P1, P2) = x by voter 1\u2019s dictatorship on A\u0304 and \u03c0 respectively. Last, we consider two cases: (i) x \u2208 A\u0304\\\u03c0 and y \u2208 \u03c0\\A\u0304, and (ii) x \u2208 \u03c0\\A\u0304 and y \u2208 A\u0304\\\u03c0. The two cases are symmetric, and we hence focus on the first one. In the first case, x \u2208 A\u0304\\{x1} and y = xk for some 1 < k \u2264 v. Since GA\u0304\u223c is a connected graph, we have a path (z1, . . . , zl) in G A\u0304 \u223c connecting x and x1. Now, according to the paths (z1, . . . , zl) and (x1, . . . , xk), since zl = x1, z1 = x \u2208 A\u0304\\\u03c0 and xk = y \u2208 \u03c0\\A\u0304, we can identify 1 < s \u2264 l and 1 \u2264 t < k such that zs = xt and {z1, . . . , zs\u22121} \u2229 {xt+1, . . . , xk} = \u2205. Then, the concatenated path \u03c0\u0302 = (z1, . . . , zs = xt, . . . , xk) connects x and y. First, we have\nf ( (z1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (z2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = z1 by voter 1\u2019s dictatorship on A\u0304. Next, according to \u03c0\u0302, statement (i) of\nLemma 1 implies f ( (z1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = z1, and hence, f(P1, P2) = x, as required. Therefore, voter 1 dictates on A\u0304 \u222a \u03c0. Last, note that both GA\u0304\u222a\u03c0\u223c and GA\u0302\u223c are connected graphs, [A\u0304 \u222a \u03c0] \u2229 A\u0302 6= \u2205 and voter 1 dictates on A\u0304 \u222a \u03c0 and A\u0302 respectively. By the same argument, we can infer that voter 1 dictates on [ A\u0304 \u222a \u03c0 ] \u222a A\u0302 = A\u0304 \u222a \u03c0 \u222a A\u0302.\nLemma 3 Given a path \u03c0 = (x1, . . . , xv), v \u2265 3, in GA\u223c and two preferences P x1,xv i , P xv ,x1 i \u2208 D, SCF f behaves like a dictatorship on \u03c0.\nProof: We first show that if f behaves like a dictatorship on {x1, x2}, it behaves like a dictatorship on \u03c0. We assume w.l.o.g. that voter 1 dictates on {x1, x2}, i.e., f(P1, P2) = r1(P1) for all P1, P2 \u2208 D with r1(P1), r1(P2) \u2208 {x1, x2}. Thus, f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1. By Lemma 2, it suffices to show that f behaves like a dictatorship on {xv\u22121, xv}. Since xv\u22121 \u223c xv, one of the following three cases occurs: (1) f behaves like a dictatorship on {xv\u22121, xv}, (2) f ( (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = f ( (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv, and\n(3) f ( (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = f ( (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv\u22121.\nTo complete the verification, we rule out the last two cases. By statement (i) of Lemma 1 on the path \u03c0, f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1 implies f ( (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv\u22121, which rules out case\n(2). Suppose that case (3) occurs. Since f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x2 and f ( (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv\u22121 6= xv, searching on the path \u03c0 from x2 towards xv\u22121, we can identify 1 < k\u0304 < v such that f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk for all k \u2208 {2, . . . , k\u0304} and f ( (xk\u0304+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u0304 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) 6= xk\u0304+1. Thus,\nby statement (iii) of Lemma 1 on the subpath (x1, . . . , xk\u0304), f ( (xk\u0304 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u0304\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk\u0304 im-\nplies f ( (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u2032 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk for all 1 \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k \u2264 k. Meanwhile, since xk\u0304 \u223c xk\u0304+1 and\nf ( (xk\u0304+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u0304 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) 6= xk\u0304+1, it is easy to show that f ( (xk\u0304+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u0304 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk\u0304. Consequently,\nby statement (ii) of Lemma 1 on the subpath (xk\u0304, . . . , xv), f ( (xk\u0304+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk\u0304 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk\u0304 implies\nf ( (xs \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xs\u2032 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xs\u2032 for all k \u2264 s\u2032 \u2264 s \u2264 v. Therefore, we have f ( P xv ,x11 , (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xk.\nConsequently, since f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1 and x1 P xv ,x1 1 xk\u0304, voter 1 will manipulate at(\nP xv ,x11 , (xk \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) )\nvia some P1 \u2208 Dx1 . Hence, case (3) is ruled out, as required. Symmetrically, we can show that if f behaves like a dictatorship on {xv\u22121, xv}, it behaves like\na dictatorship on \u03c0.\nLast, to prove the lemma, we show that f behaves like a dictatorship on either {x1, x2} or {xv\u22121, xv}. Suppose that it is not true.\nClaim 1: We have f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x2 and f ( (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) =\nf ( (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv\u22121.\nSince x1 \u223c x2 and the contradictory hypothesis rules out dictatorships on {x1, x2}, by strategyproofness, we have either f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1, or f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) =\nf ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x2. Suppose f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1. Thus, we\nknow f ( P x1,xv1 , (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1. Moreover, by statement(ii) of Lemma 1 on \u03c0, f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) =\nx1 implies f ( P xv ,x11 , (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x2. Consequently, voter 1 will manipulate at ( P xv ,x11 , (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) via\nsome P x1,xv1 . Therefore, f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = f ( (x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x2. Symmetrically, we can\nshow f ( (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = f ( (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv\u22121. This proves the claim.\nNow, by Claims A and B of Sen (2001), according to preference P x1,xvi and P xv ,x1 i , we know that either f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1 or f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv holds. To complete the proof, we\nwill induce a contradiction in each case. First, let f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = x1. Since xv \u223c xv\u22121, we have P xv ,xv\u22121\n2 , P xv\u22121,xv 2 \u2208 D such that rk(P xv ,xv\u22121 2 ) = rk(P xv\u22121,xv 2 ) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}. Thus,\nf(P x1,xv1 , P xv ,xv\u22121 2 ) = x1, which by strategy-proofness implies f(P x1,xv 1 , P xv\u22121,xv 2 ) = x1. Furthermore, by strategy-proofness, f(P x1,xv1 , P xv\u22121,xv 2 ) = x1 implies f(P xv ,x1 1 , P xv\u22121,xv\n2 ) \u2208 {x1, xv}. Since xv \u223c xv\u22121, by Claim A of Sen (2001), we have f(P xv ,x11 , P xv\u22121,xv 2 ) \u2208 {xv, xv\u22121}. Therefore, f(P xv ,x11 , P xv\u22121,xv\n2 ) \u2208 {x1, xv} \u2229 {xv, xv\u22121} = {xv}, which contradicts Claim 1, as required. Last, let f ( (x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (xv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) ) = xv. Since x1 \u223c x2, we have P x1,x21 , P x2,x1 1 \u2208 D such that rk(P x1,x2 1 ) = rk(P x2,x1 1 ) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}. Thus, f(P x1,x2 1 , P xv ,x1 2 ) = xv, which by strategyproofness implies f(P x2,x11 , P xv ,x1 2 ) = xv. Furthermore, by strategy-proofness, f(P x2,x1 1 , P xv ,x1 2 ) = xv implies f(P x2,x1 1 , P x1,xv\n2 ) \u2208 {x1, xv}. Since x1 \u223c x2, by Claim A of Sen (2001), we have f(P x2,x11 , P x1,xv 2 ) \u2208 {x1, x2}. Therefore, f(P x2,x1 1 , P x1,xv 2 ) \u2208 {x1, xv} \u2229 {x1, x2} = {x1}, which contradicts Claim 1, as required. This proves the lemma.\nObservation 1 According to Lemma 3, one would observe that given a cycle C = (x1, . . . , xv, x1) in GA\u223c, i.e., v \u2265 3, x1, . . . , xv are pairwise distinct, and xk \u223c xk+1 for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , v}, where xv+1 = x1, each two-voter, strategy-proof rule f : D2 \u2192 A must behave like a dictatorship on C.\nLemma 4 Fixing a subset B \u2286 A with |B| \u2265 3, let GB\u223c be a connected graph. Then, the following two statements hold:\n(i) if Leaf(GB\u223c) = \u2205, then f behaves likes a dictatorship on B, and\n(ii) given Leaf(GB\u223c) 6= \u2205, if f behaves like a dictatorship on {x, y} for all x \u2208 Leaf(GB\u223c) and (x, y) \u2208 EB\u223c , then f behaves like a dictatorship on B.\nProof: First, let Leaf(GB\u223c) = \u2205. Note that for each x \u2208 B, x is included in either a cycle or a path that connects two distinct cycles. Therefore, by Observation 1 and Lemma 2, we infer that f\nbehaves like a dictatorship on B.\nNext, let Leaf(GB\u223c) 6= \u2205 and f behave like a dictatorship on {x, y} for all x \u2208 Leaf(GB\u223c) and (x, y) \u2208 EB\u223c . For notational convenience, let Leaf(GB\u223c) = {x1, . . . , xt} and (xk, yk) \u2208 EB\u223c for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , t}. Thus, f behaves like a dictatorship on {xk, yk} for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , t}. We consider two cases: GB\u223c is not a tree and G B \u223c is a tree.\nIn the first case, GB\u223c must include a cycle C. Then, we can identify a subset B\u0304 \u2282 B such that GB\u0304\u223c is a connected graph, Leaf(G B\u0304 \u223c) = \u2205 and [B\u0304 \u2282 B\u0302 \u2286 B]\u21d2 [ Leaf(GB\u0302\u223c) 6= \u2205 ] . Then, by statement (i), f behaves like a dictatorship on B\u0304. For each 1 \u2264 k \u2264 t, since GB\u223c is a connected graph, there exist zk \u2208 B\u0304 and a path \u03c0k = (x1, . . . , xv\u22121, xv) in GB\u223c that connects zk and xk. Clearly, xv\u22121 = yk. Then, Lemma 2 implies that f behaves like a dictatorship on B\u0304 \u222a \u03c0k. Last, since GB\u223c in fact is a combination of GB\u0304\u223c and paths \u03c01, . . . , \u03c0t, by repeatedly applying Lemma 2, we conclude that f behaves like a dictatorship on B.\nLast, we assume that GB\u223c is a tree. Evidently, G B \u223c has at least two leaves, i.e., t \u2265 2. Note that for any two distinct xp, xq \u2208 Leaf(GB\u223c), there exists a unique path \u03c0p,q = (z1, z2, . . . , zv\u22121, zv) in GB\u223c connecting xp and xq. Clearly, z2 = yp and zv\u22121 = yq (it is possible that yp = yq). Then, Lemma 2 implies that f behaves like a dictatorship on \u03c0. Last, since GB\u223c in fact is a combination of all paths {\u03c0p,q : 1 \u2264 p < q \u2264 t}, by repeatedly applying Lemma 2, we conclude that f behaves like a dictatorship on B.\nNow, we are ready to show that if the domain D satisfying path-connectedness and leaf symmetry is non-dictatorial domain, then D satisfies the unique seconds property. Suppose by contradiction that D violates the unique seconds property. We show that D is a dictatorial domain. By the ramification theorem of Aswal et al. (2003), it suffices to show that every two-voter, strategy-proof rule is a dictatorship. Henceforth, we fix N = {1, 2} and a strategy-proof rule f : D2 \u2192 A.\nBy statement (i) of Lemma 4, if Leaf(GA\u223c) = \u2205, then f is a dictatorship. Last, we assume Leaf(GA\u223c) 6= \u2205. By statement (ii) of Lemma 4, it suffices to show that for each x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c), f behaves like a dictatorship on x and its unique neighbor in GA\u223c. Fix arbitrary x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c), let (x, y) \u2208 EA\u223c . we show that f behaves like a dictatorship on {x, y}. Clearly, y \u2208 S(Dx) and the violation of the unique seconds property implies |S(Dx)| > 1. Then, by leaf symmetry, we have z \u2208 S(Dx)\\{y} such that x \u2208 S(Dz). Hence, we have P x,zi , P z,x i \u2208 D. Since GA\u223c is a connected graph, there exists a path \u03c0 = (x1, . . . , xv) connecting x and z. Consequently, Lemma 3 implies that f behaves like a dictatorship on \u03c0. Last, since x \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c) and (x, y) \u2208 EA\u223c , it must be the case that x2 = y. Therefore, f behaves like a dictatorship on {x, y}, as required. This proves the Auxiliary Proposition."

Since xs \u223c xs+1, it is easy to show f(xs, xs+1) \u2208 {xs, xs+1}. Next, we pick an arbitrary integer l \u2208 {s + 2, . . . , t}, and provide an induction hypothesis: f(xs, xl\u2032) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xl\u2032} for all l\u2032 \u2208 {s + 1, . . . , l \u2212 1}. We show f(xs, xl) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xl}. First, the induction hypothesis implies f(xs, xl\u22121) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xl\u22121}. Next, since xl\u22121 \u223c xl, we have P2, P \u2032 2 \u2208 D such that r1(P2) = r2(P \u20322) = xl\u22121, r1(P \u20322) = r2(P2) = xl and rk(P2) = rk(P \u20322) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}. If f(xs, P2) = f(xs, xl\u22121) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xl\u22122}, then strategy-proofness implies f(xs, xl) = f(xs, P \u2032 2) = f(xs, P2) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xl\u22122}. If f(xs, P2) = f(xs, xl\u22121) = xl\u22121, then strategy-proofness implies f(xs, xl) = f(xs, P \u2032 2) \u2208 {xl\u22121, xl}. Overall, f(xs, xl) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xl}. This completes the verification of the induction hypothesis. Therefore, f(xs, xt) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xt}. Symmetrically, f(xt, xs) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xt}.

Given 1 \u2264 k \u2264 v, either 1 \u2264 k \u2264 s or s < k \u2264 v holds. First, given s < k \u2264 v, we consider the path (xs, . . . , xk). Since xs \u223c xs+1, we have P2, P \u20322 \u2208 D such that r1(P2) = r2(P \u20322) = xs, r1(P \u20322) = r2(P2) = xs+1 and rk(P2) = rk(P \u2032 2) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}. Since x /\u2208 {xs, xs+1}, strategy-proofness implies f(P1, xs+1) = f(P1, P \u2032 2) = f(P1, P2) = f(P1, xs) = x. According to the path (xs, . . . , xk) from xs+1 to xk, by repeatedly applying the same argument step by step, we eventually have f(P1, xk) = x. Symmetrically, if 1 \u2264 k \u2264 s, we also induce f(P1, xk) = x. This completes the verification of statement (ii).\nLast, we prove statement (iii). By symmetry, we assume w.l.o.g. that i = 1. Given p \u2208 {1, . . . , s \u2212 1}, suppose f(P1, xp) = x /\u2208 {xp, . . . , xs}. Then, according to the path (xp, . . . , xs), statement (ii) implies f(P1, xs) = x 6= xs - a contradiction. Therefore, f(P1, xp) \u2208 {xp, . . . , xs}. Similarly, f(P1, xq) \u2208 {xs, . . . , xq} for all q \u2208 {s + 1, . . . , v}. This completes the verification of statement (iii).\nLemma 6 Fixing a path \u03c0 = (x1, . . . , xv), v \u2265 3, in GA\u223c, let f(x1, xv) = xk and f(xv, x1) = xk. The following three statements hold: given xs, xt \u2208 \u03c0,\n(i) [ k < k ] \u21d2 f(xs, xt) =  xs if k \u2264 s \u2264 k, xmed(s, t, k) if s < k, and\nxmed(s, t, k) if s > k.\n,\n(ii) [ k > k ] \u21d2 f(xs, xt) =  xt if k \u2264 t \u2264 k, xmed(s, t, k) if t < k, and\nxmed(s, t, k) if t > k. , and (iii) [ k = k = k\u2217 ] \u21d2 [ f(xs, xt) = xmed(s, t, k\u2217) for all s, t \u2208 {1, . . . , v} ] .\nProof: First, according to f(x1, xv) = xk, we establish the following claim.\nClaim 1: We have f(xk, xk\u2032) =  xk\u2032 if 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k, xk if k \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 v, and xk if 1 \u2264 k < k < k\u2032 \u2264 v.\nIf k = 1, the first part here follows immediately from unanimity. Next, we assume k > 1\nand show the first part. According to statement (iv) of Lemma 1 on the subpath (x1, . . . , xk), we know that if f(xk\u22121, xk) = xk, then we have f(xk, xk\u2032) = xk\u2032 for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k, as required. Therefore, we focus on showing f(xk\u22121, xk) = xk. Since xk\u22121 \u223c xk, it is evident that f(xk\u22121, xk) \u2208 {xk\u22121, xk}. Suppose by contradiction that f(xk\u22121, xk) = xk\u22121. Then, according to the subpath (x1, . . . , xk\u22121), statement (iii) of Lemma 5 implies f(x1, xk) \u2208 {x1, . . . , xk\u22121}. However, f(x1, xv) = xk implies f(x1, xk) = xk by strategy-proofness - a contradiction. In conclusion, we have f(xk, xk\u2032) = xk\u2032 for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k. Symmetrically, according to the subpath (xk, . . . , xv) (no matter k = v or k < v holds), we can show f(xk, xk\u2032) = xk for all k \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 v, as required by the second part. Last, we show the third part. Given 1 \u2264 k < k < k\u2032 \u2264 v, according to the subpath (x1, . . . , xk),\nby statement (ii) of Lemma 5, f(x1, xv) = xk implies f(xk, xv) = xk. Furthermore, according to\nthe subpath (xk\u2032 , . . . , xv), by statement (ii) of Lemma 5, f(xk, xv) = xk implies f(xk, xk\u2032) = xk, as\nrequired by the third part. This completes the verification of the claim.\nSymmetrically, according to f(xv, x1) = xk, we can establish the claim below.\nClaim 2: We have f(xk\u2032 , xk) =  xk\u2032 if 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k, xk if k \u2264 k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 v, and xk if 1 \u2264 k < k < k \u2032 \u2264 v.\nLast, we combine the two claims to prove the lemma. Note that the verifications of the three\nstatements are symmetric. We focus on the verification of statement (i). Let k < k and fix an\narbitrary profile (xs, xt).\nFirst, let k \u2264 s \u2264 k. If s \u2264 t, we have k \u2264 s < t \u2264 v and f(xs, xt) = xs by Claim 1. If t < s, we have 1 \u2264 t \u2264 s \u2264 k and f(xs, xt) = xs by Claim 2.\nSecond, let s < k. If t \u2264 s, we have 1 \u2264 t < s < k < k and f(xs, xt) = xs = xmed(s, t, k) by Claim 2. If s < t \u2264 k, we have 1 \u2264 s < t \u2264 k and f(xs, xt) = xt = xmed(s, t, k) by Claim 1. If k < t, we have 1 \u2264 s < k < t \u2264 v and f(xs, xt) = xk = xmed(s, t, k) by Claim 1.\nLast, let s > k. If t < k, we have 1 \u2264 t < k < s \u2264 v and f(xs, xt) = xk = xmed(s, t, k) by Claim 2. If k \u2264 t \u2264 s, we have k \u2264 t < s \u2264 v and f(xs, xt) = xt = xmed(s,t,k) by Claim 2. If s < t, we have k < k < s < t \u2264 v and f(xs, xt) = xs = xmed(s,t,k) by Claim 1. This proves statement (i).\nNow, we are ready to prove the two statements of Theorem 1.\nProof of Statement (i). Let D be a non-dictatorial, unidimensional domain. To prove Statement (i), we show the equivalence of the following three sub-statements:\n(1) there exists an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule,\n(2) domain D is a semi-single-peaked domain, and\n(3) domain D admits a two-voter, strategy-proof projection rule.\nWe first show the direction: (2) \u21d2 (3) \u21d2 (1). By the proof of the sufficiency part of the Theorem of Chatterji et al. (2013), we know that if D is a semi-single-peaked domain, it admits a two-voter, strategy-proof projection rule, which of course is an invariant, tops-only and strategyproof rule. In the rest of the proof, we focus on showing (1) \u21d2 (2). More specifically, we complete the proof via the following three steps:\nStep 1. We show that the existence of invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule implies that the adjacency graph GA\u223c is a tree (see Lemmas 7 and 8). Step 2. Given an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule f : D2 \u2192 A admitted by D, we characterize the SCF f to be a projection rule on the tree GA\u223c w.r.t. the threshold which equals the same social outcome at the two test profiles (P 1, P 2) and (P 1, P 2) (see Lemma 9). This of course implies that every invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule defined on D is a projection rule. Step 3. By adopting strategy-proofness of the projection rule f characterized in Step 2, we show that D a semi-single-peaked domain (see Lemma 10). This proves (1) \u21d2 (2).\nLemma 7 Recall the two completely reversed preferences P i and P i, and their peaks r1(P i) = a1 and r1(P i) = am. There exists a unique path in G A \u223c connecting a1 and am.\nProof: Since GA\u223c is a connected graph, there exists a path in G A \u223c connecting a1 and am. Suppose by contradiction that there are two distinct paths \u03c0 = (x1, . . . , xp) and \u03c0 \u2032 = (y1, . . . , yq) in G A \u223c connecting a1 and am. Then, we can identify 1 \u2264 s < t \u2264 p and 1 \u2264 s\u2032 < t\u2032 \u2264 q with either t\u2212s > 1 or t\u2032\u2212s\u2032 > 1 such that xs = ys\u2032 , xt = yt\u2032 and {xs+1, . . . , xt\u22121}\u2229{ys\u2032+1, . . . , yt\u2032\u22121} = \u2205. Consequently, we construct a cycle C = (xs, . . . , xt = yt\u2032 , . . . , ys\u2032+1, ys\u2032 = xs). By Observation 1 in Appendix A, every two-voter, strategy-proof rule behaves like a dictatorship on C. Fixing an arbitrary twovoter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule g : D2 \u2192 A, we assume w.l.o.g. that voter 1 dictates on C, i.e., g(P1, P2) = r1(P1) for all P1, P2 \u2208 D with r1(P1), r1(P2) \u2208 C. Thus, g(xs, xt) = xs and g(xt, xs) = xt. According to subpaths (xt, . . . , xp) and (xs, . . . , x1), by statements (ii) of Lemma\n5, g(xs, xt) = xs implies g(xs, xp) = xs, and g(xt, xs) = xt implies g(xt, x1) = xt. Furthermore,\naccording to subpaths (xs, . . . , x1) and (xt, . . . , xp), by statements (iii) of Lemma 5, g(xs, xp) = xs implies g(x1, xp) \u2208 {x1, . . . , xs} and g(xt, x1) = xt implies g(xp, x1) \u2208 {xt, . . . , xp}. Consequently, we have g(P 1, P 2) = g(x1, xp) 6= g(xp, x1) = g(P 1, P 2), which implies that g violates invariance. In conclusion, all two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rules violate invariance. This contradicts\nthe hypothesis that there exists an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, and hence proves\nthe lemma.\nLet \u03c0\u2217 = (x1, . . . , xp) be the unique path connecting a1 and am in G A \u223c. Note that this path\nmay not include all alternatives of A (recall the adjacency graph GA\u223c in Figure 3).\nLemma 8 The graph GA\u223c is a tree.\nProof: Suppose not, i.e., there exists a cycle C = (b1, . . . , bv, b1), v \u2265 3. By Observation 1 in Appendix A, every two-voter, strategy-proof rule behaves like a dictatorship on C. Fixing an arbitrary two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule g : D2 \u2192 A, we assume w.l.o.g. that voter 1 dictates on C, i.e., g(P1, P2) = r1(P1) for all P1, P2 \u2208 D with r1(P1), r1(P2) \u2208 C.\nWe know either C \u2229 \u03c0\u2217 = \u2205 or C \u2229 \u03c0\u2217 6= \u2205. If C \u2229 \u03c0\u2217 = \u2205, we can identify bs \u2208 C, xk \u2208 \u03c0\u2217 and a path (y1, . . . , yu) in G A \u223c connecting bs and xk such that yp /\u2208 C \u222a \u03c0\u2217 for all p \u2208 {2, . . . , u \u2212 1} (see the first diagram of Figure 7). If C \u2229 \u03c0\u2217 6= \u2205, we must identify a unique alternative of \u03c0\u2217 that is contained in C, say bs = xk \u2208 \u03c0\u2217 (see the second diagram of Figure 7); for otherwise, we can identify two distinct paths in GA\u223c connecting a1 and am, which contradicts Lemma 7. Overall, we have the cycle C = (b1, . . . , bv, b1), the path \u03c0\u2217 = (x1, . . . , xp) and the path (y1, . . . , yu) which may be a null path when bs = xk. We consider three cases of xk on \u03c0 \u2217: 1 < k < p, k = 1 and k = p. In\neach case, we show that g violates invariance.\nIn the first case 1 < k < p, fixing bt \u2208 C\\{bs}, we have g(bt, bs) = bt and g(bs, bt) = bs by voter 1\u2019s dictatorship on C. According to paths (bs = y1, . . . , yu = xk, . . . , x1) and (bs = y1, . . . , yu = xk, . . . , xp), by statement (ii) of Lemma 5, g(bt, bs) = bt implies g(bt, x1) = bt and g(bt, xp) = bt. Furthermore, according to paths (bt, . . . , bs = y1, . . . , yu = xk, . . . , xp) and\n(bt, . . . , bs = y1, . . . , yu = xk, . . . , x1), by statement (iii) of Lemma 5, g(bt, x1) = bt implies g(xp, x1) \u2208 {bt, . . . , bs = y1, . . . , yu = xk, . . . , xp}, and g(bt, xp) = bt implies g(x1, xp) \u2208 {bt, . . . , bs = y1, . . . , yu = xk, . . . , x1}. Furthermore, according to \u03c0\u2217, statement (i) of Lemma 5 implies g(xp, x1) \u2208 {x1, . . . , xp} and g(x1, xp) \u2208 {x1, . . . , xp}. Therefore, we have g(xp, x1) \u2208 {bt, . . . , bs = y1, . . . , yu = xk, . . . , xp} \u2229 {x1, . . . , xp} = {xk, . . . , xp} and g(x1, xp) \u2208 {bt, . . . , bs = y1, . . . , yu = xk, . . . , x1} \u2229 {x1, . . . , xp} = {x1, . . . , xk}. Thus, g(xp, x1) = xk for some k \u2208 {k, . . . , p} and g(x1, xp) = xk for some k \u2208 {1, . . . , k}. Now, given P 1 = P i and P 1 = P i, according to g(bt, x1) = bt and g(P 1, x1) = g(xp, x1) = xk, and g(bt, xp) = bt and g(P 1, xp) = g(x1, xp) = xk, strategy-proofness implies xk P 1 bt and xk P 1 bt. Consequently, by the fact that P 1 and P 1 are complete reversals, it must be the case that xk 6= xk. Therefore, g(P 1, P 2) = g(x1, xp) 6= g(xp, x1) = g(P 1, P 2), which indicates that g violates invariance. This completes the verification of the first case.\nThe second and third cases are symmetric. We focus on the verification of the second case k = 1. Fixing bt \u2208 C\\{bs}, we have g(bt, bs) = bt. According to the path (bs = y1, . . . , yu = x1, . . . , xp), by statement (ii) of Lemma 5, g(bt, bs) = bt implies g(bt, x1) = bt and g(bt, xp) = bt. Furthermore,\naccording to the path (bt, . . . , bs = y1, . . . , yu = x1), by statement (iii) of Lemma 5, g(bt, xp) = bt implies g(x1, xp) \u2208 {bt, . . . , bs = y1, . . . , yu = x1}. Meanwhile, according to \u03c0\u2217, statement (i) of Lemma 5 implies g(x1, xp) \u2208 {x1, . . . , xp}. Hence, it must be the case that g(x1, xp) = x1. Similarly, according to \u03c0\u2217, statement (i) of Lemma 5 implies g(xp, x1) \u2208 {x1, . . . , xp}. Thus, given P 1 = P i, we have g(P 1, x1) = g(xp, x1) = xq for some q \u2208 {1, . . . , p}. Consequently, according to g(bt, x1) = bt and g(P 1, x1) = xq, strategy-proofness implies xq P 1 bt, which further implies that\nxq is never bottom-ranked in P i. Since P i and P i are complete reversals and r1(P i) = a1 = x1, x1 must be the bottom-ranked alternative in P i. Therefore, g(P 1, P 2) = g(x1, xp) = x1 6= xq =\ng(xp, x1) = g(P 1, P 2), which indicates that g violates invariance. This completes the verification of the second case.\nIn conclusion, all two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rules violate invariance. This contra-\ndicts the hypothesis that there exists an invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule. This proves\nthe lemma, and completes the verification in Step 1.\nNow, we start the proof in Step 2. We fix an arbitrary invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule f : D2 \u2192 A. According to the unique path \u03c0\u2217 = (x1, . . . , xp) in the tree GA\u223c connecting a1 and am, by the tops-only property, invariance and statement (i) of Lemma 5, we know f(x1, xp) = f(P 1, P 2) = f(P 1, P 2) = f(xp, x1) = xk\u0304 for some k\u0304 \u2208 {1, . . . , p}.\nLemma 9 SCF f is a projection rule on the tree GA\u223c w.r.t. xk\u0304, i.e., f(y, z) = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) for all y, z \u2208 A.\nProof: The proof consists of the following three claims.\nClaim 1: Given y \u2208 A, we have f(y, xk\u0304) = f(xk\u0304, y) = xk\u0304.\nRecall the unique path \u03c0\u2217 = (x1, . . . , xp) connecting a1 and am in G A \u223c. There are two cases: y \u2208 \u03c0\u2217 and y /\u2208 \u03c0\u2217. If y \u2208 \u03c0\u2217, then y = xk for some k \u2208 {1, . . . , p}, and we hence have f(y, xk\u0304) = f(xk, xk\u0304) = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008xk, xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = xk\u0304 and f(xk\u0304, y) = f(xk\u0304, xk) = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008xk\u0304, xk|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = xk\u0304.\nHenceforth, we assume y /\u2208 \u03c0\u2217. We focus on showing f(y, xk\u0304) = xk\u0304. By a symmetric proof, one would immediately conclude f(xk\u0304, y) = xk\u0304. Let \u3008xk\u0304, y|GA\u223c\u3009 = (z1, . . . , zv) be the path connecting xk\u0304 and y in the tree G A \u223c. We first show f(z2, z1) = z1. If z2 \u2208 \u03c0\u2217, then z2 = xk for some\nk \u2208 {1, . . . , p} and hence we have f(z2, z1) = f(xk, xk\u0304) = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008xk, xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = xk\u0304 = z1. Next, let z2 /\u2208 \u03c0\u2217. Since z1 \u223c z2, it is evident that f(z2, z1) \u2208 {z1, z2}. Suppose by contradiction that f(z2, z1) = z2. We have three cases: k\u0304 = 1, k\u0304 = p and 1 < k\u0304 < p. In each case, we show\nf(z2, x1) = z2 and f(z2, xp) = z2. Note that the first two cases are symmetric, and we hence omit\nthe verification in the second case. In the first case k\u0304 = 1, the contradictory hypothesis immediately\nimplies f(z2, x1) = f(z2, z1) = z2. Furthermore, according to the path (z1 = xk\u0304, . . . , xp), by statement (ii) of Lemma 5, f(z2, z1) = z2 implies f(z2, xp) = z2. In the third case 1 < k\u0304 < p,\naccording to paths (z1 = xk\u0304, . . . , x1) and (z1 = xk\u0304, . . . , xp), statement (ii) of Lemma 5 implies f(z2, x1) = z2 and f(z2, xp) = z2. Overall, we have f(z2, x1) = z2 and f(z2, xp) = z2. Given\nP 1 = P i and P 1 = P i, we have f(P 1, x1) = f(xp, x1) = xk\u0304 = z1 and f(P 1, xp) = f(x1, xp) = xk\u0304 = z1. Then, strategy-proofness implies z1 P 1 z2 (according to (P 1, x1) and (z2, x1)) and z1 P 1 z2 (according to (P 1, xp) and (z2, xp)). This contradicts the fact that P 1 and P 1 are complete reversals. Therefore, f(z2, z1) = z1. Then, according to the path (z2, . . . , zv), statement\n(ii) of Lemma 5 implies f(y, xk\u0304) = f(zv, z1) = z1 = xk\u0304. This proves the claim.\nHenceforth, we fix arbitrary y, z \u2208 A and let \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 = (y1, . . . , yu). There are three cases: (1) Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = y, (2) Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = z and (3) Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = yl for some\n1 < l < u. In each case, we show f(y, z) = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) . Note that the first two cases are symmetric, and we hence omit the verification in case (2).\nClaim 2: In case (1), f(y, z) = y = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) .\nIf y = xk\u0304, this claim follows from Claim 1. Next, assume y 6= xk\u0304. Let (b1, . . . , bv) denote the path in GA\u223c connecting y and xk\u0304. Since Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = y, we have a concatenated path \u03c0 = (z = yu, . . . , y1 = y = b1, . . . , bv = xk\u0304). Since f(bv, bv\u22121) = f(xk\u0304, bv\u22121) = xk\u0304 = bv, according to\nthe path \u03c0, statement (iii) of Lemma 1 in Appendix A implies f(y, z) = y = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) . This completes the verification of the claim.\nClaim 3: In case (3), f(y, z) = yl = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) .\nFirst, let (c1, . . . , cv) denote the path connecting xk\u0304 and yl in G A \u223c, which may be a null path if xk\u0304 = yl. According to the path \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 = (y1, . . . , yu), statement (i) of Lemma 5 implies f(y, z) = yk for some k \u2208 {1, . . . , u}. Suppose k 6= l. Thus, either 1 \u2264 k < l or l < k \u2264 u holds. Moreover, since Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = yl, k 6= l also implies yk 6= xk\u0304. If 1 \u2264 k < l, according to the concatenated path \u03c0\u2032 = (z = yu, . . . , yl = cv, . . . , c1 = xk\u0304), by statement (ii) of Lemma 5, f(y, z) = yk /\u2208 \u03c0\u2032 implies f(y, xk\u0304) = yk 6= xk\u0304, which contradicts Claim 1. Symmetrically, if l < k \u2264 u, according to the concatenated path \u03c0\u2032\u2032 = (y = y1, . . . , yl = cv, . . . , c1 = xk\u0304), by statement (ii) of Lemma 5, f(y, z) = yk /\u2208 \u03c0\u2032\u2032 implies f(xk\u0304, z) = yk 6= xk\u0304, which contradicts Claim 1. Therefore, f(y, z) = yl = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008y, z|GA\u223c\u3009 ) . This completes the verification of the claim, and hence proves the lemma. This completes the proof in Step 2.\nLast, we move to Step 3 and show that D is a semi-single-peaked domain.\nLemma 10 Domain D is a semi-single-peaked domain.\nProof: Since GA\u223c is a tree, it suffices to show D \u2286 DSSP(GA\u223c, xk\u0304). Fixing arbitrary P1 \u2208 D, let r1(P1) = x. First, given distinct a, b \u2208 \u3008x, xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 and a \u2208 \u3008x, b|GA\u223c\u3009, we show a P1 b. By Lemma 9, we have f(P1, a) = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008x, a|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = a and f(b, a) = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008b, a|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = b. Then, strategy-\nproofness implies a P1 b, as required. Next, given a /\u2208 \u3008x, xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 and Proj ( a, \u3008x, xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = a\u2032, we\nshow a\u2032 P1 a. By Lemma 9, we have f(P1, a) = Proj ( xk\u0304, \u3008x, a|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = Proj ( a, \u3008x, xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = a\u2032 and f(a, a) = a. Then, strategy-proofness implies a\u2032 P1 a, as required. This completes the proof\nin Step 3, and proves Statement (i) of Theorem 1.\nNow, we will focus on the proof of Statement (ii) of Theorem 1.\nProof of Statement (ii): Let D be a non-dictatorial, unidimensional domain. We first show the \u201cif part\u201d of Statement (ii): \u201cThere exists no invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule.\u201d \u21d0 \u201cDomain D is a semi-hybrid domain.\u201d More specifically, let D be an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on a tree T A. The proof consists of the following two lemmas. Recall the two completely reversed preferences P i and P i included in D by diversity, and their peaks r1(P i) = a1 and r1(P i) = am. The following lemma indicates that we can assume w.l.o.g. that a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a.\nLemma 11 There exist a tree T\u0302 A and dual-thresholds a\u0302, b\u0302 \u2208 A such that D is an (a\u0302, b\u0302)-semi-hybrid domain on T\u0302 A, a1 \u2208 A\u0302a\u0302\u21c0b\u0302 = { x \u2208 A : a\u0302 \u2208 \u3008x, b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 } and am \u2208 A\u0302b\u0302\u21c0a\u0302 = { x \u2208 A : b\u0302 \u2208 \u3008x, a\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 } .\nProof: There are four situations: (1) Aa\u21c0b 6= {a} and Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}, (2) Aa\u21c0b = {a} and Ab\u21c0a = {b}, (3) Aa\u21c0b = {a} and Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}, and (4) Aa\u21c0b 6= {a} and Ab\u21c0a = {b}. In each case, we construct a tree T\u0302 A and identify dual-thresholds a\u0302, b\u0302 \u2208 A such that D is an (a\u0302, b\u0302)-semi-hybrid domain on T\u0302 A, a1 \u2208 A\u0302a\u0302\u21c0b\u0302 and am \u2208 A\u0302b\u0302\u21c0a\u0302.\nIn Situation (1), we have c \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and d \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}. We first claim a1 /\u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Suppose not, i.e., a1 \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Then, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, we have b P i d and a P i c. Note that either am \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, or am \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 \u222a Ab\u21c0a holds, which respectively by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A implies b P i d and a P i c. This contradicts the fact that P i and P i are complete reversals. Symmetrically, am /\u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Thus, there are four cases: (i) a1, am \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, (ii) a1, am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, (iii) a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, and (iv) a1 \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} and am \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. We first rule out case (i). In case (i), by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, we have b P i d and b P i d, which contradict the fact that P i and P i are complete reversals. Symmetrically, we can rule out case (ii). In case (iii), it is evident that D is an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on T A, a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a, as required. In case (iv), let a\u0302 = b and b\u0302 = a. Thus,\na1 \u2208 Ab\u21c0a = Aa\u0302\u21c0b\u0302 and am \u2208 Aa\u21c0b = Ab\u0302\u21c0a\u0302. Evidently, since D is an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on T A, it is true that D is an (a\u0302, b\u0302)-semi-hybrid domain on T A, as required.\nIn Situation (2), we refer to the line LA = (a1, . . . , am) and the dual-thresholds a1 and am, and show that D is an (a1, am)-semi-hybrid domain on LA. First, it is clear that D \u2286 P = DSH(LA, a1, am). Next, since D is an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on T A and \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 = A, we know by condition (ii) of Definition 6 that there exist no tree T\u0303 A and dual-thresholds a\u0303, b\u0303 \u2208 A such that D \u2286 DSH(T\u0303 A, a\u0303, b\u0303) and \u3008a\u0303, b\u0303|T\u0303 A\u3009 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 = A = \u3008a1, am|LA\u3009. Last, by condition (iii) of Definition 6, we know that if GA\u223c is a tree, then for each x \u2208 Leaf ( G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ) = Leaf ( GA\u223c ) =\nLeaf ( G \u3008a1,am|LA\u3009 \u223c ) , there exists a preference Pi \u2208 D such that Pi is not semi-single-peaked on GA\u223c w.r.t. x. Therefore, D is an (a1, am)-semi-hybrid domain on LA, as required. Since Situations (3) and (4) are symmetric, we focus on verifying Situation (2). We have two cases: (i) a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and (ii) a1 \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. In case (i), since P i and P i are complete reversals, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, it is easy to show that am \u2208 \u3008a, b|T b\u3009\\{a}. Now, we construct a line (x1, . . . , xs) over all alternatives of \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 such that s = |\u3008a, b|T A\u3009|, x1 = a, xs = am, and all alternatives of \u3008a, b|T A\u3009\\{a, am} are arbitrarily arranged in the interior of the line. Then, by combining the subtree T a\u21c0b and the line (x1, . . . , xs), we generate a tree T\u0302 A. Clearly, a and am are dual-thresholds in T\u0302 A. Let a\u0302 = a and b\u0302 = am. Thus, \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 = \u3008a\u0302, b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009, a1 \u2208 A\u0302a\u0302\u21c0b\u0302 and am \u2208 A\u0302b\u0302\u21c0a\u0302. We last show that D is an (a\u0302, b\u0302)-semi-hybrid domain on T\u0302 A. By (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, one can easily show D \u2286 DSH(T\u0302 A, a\u0302, b\u0302). Furthermore, by condition (ii) of Definition 6, we know that there exist no tree T\u0303 A and dual-thresholds a\u0303, b\u0303 \u2208 A such that D \u2286 DSH(T\u0303 A, a\u0303, b\u0303) and \u3008a\u0303, b\u0303|T\u0303 A\u3009 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T\u0302 A\u3009 = \u3008a\u0302, b\u0302|T A\u3009. Last, by condition (iii) of Definition 6, we know that if GA\u223c is a tree, then for each x \u2208 Leaf ( G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ) = Leaf ( G \u3008a\u0302,b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u223c ) , there exists a preference Pi \u2208 D such that Pi is semi-single-peaked on G A \u223c w.r.t. x. Therefore, D is an (a\u0302, b\u0302)-semi-hybrid domain on T\u0302 A, as required. In case (ii), fixing an alternative c \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A implies a P i c. Since P i and P i are complete reversals, we have c P i a. Consequently, to meet (a, b)semi-hybridness on T A, it must be the case that am \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. Then, (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A implies a P i b. We further claim a1 6= a. Otherwise, r1(P i) = a1 = a 6= b implies a P i b, which contradicts the fact that P i and P i are complete reversals. Thus, we have am \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and a1 \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009\\{a}, which are analogous to a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and am \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009\\{a} in the verification of case (i). Then, by a symmetric argument, we can construct a tree T\u0302 A and identify dual-thresholds a\u0302, b\u0302 \u2208 A such that D is an (a\u0302, b\u0302)-semi-hybrid domain on T\u0302 A, a1 \u2208 A\u0302a\u0302\u21c0b\u0302 and am \u2208 A\u0302b\u0302\u21c0a\u0302. This proves the lemma.\nHenceforth, let a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a. By Statement (i), to complete the verification, it suffices to show that D is not a semi-single-peaked domain.\nLemma 12 Domain D is not a semi-single-peaked domain.\nProof: Suppose not, i.e., there exist a tree T\u0303 A and a threshold x\u0304 \u2208 A such that D \u2286 DSSP(T\u0303 A, x\u0304), and GA\u223c is a connected graph. Then, by Clarification 1 and its proof, we know that G A \u223c is tree that coincides to T\u0303 A, i.e., GA\u223c = T\u0303 A, x\u0304 has at most two neighbors in GA\u223c, i.e., |NA\u223c (x\u0304)| \u2264 2, and x\u0304 is included in the path \u3008a1, am|T\u0303 A\u3009 = \u3008a1, am|GA\u223c\u3009. Let \u3008a1, am|GA\u223c\u3009 = (x1, . . . , xv) denote the path in GA\u223c connecting a1 and am. Thus, x\u0304 = xk\u0304 for some k\u0304 \u2208 {1, . . . , v}. Meanwhile, by (a, b)-semihybridness on T A, we know that GA\u223c is a combination of the subtree GA a\u21c0b \u223c = T A a\u21c0b , the connected subgraph G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c and the subtree GA b\u21c0a \u223c = T A b\u21c0a , denoted by GA\u223c = G Aa\u21c0b \u223c \u222aG \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u222aGA b\u21c0a \u223c . Then, GA\u223c = T\u0303 A implies that G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is a tree as well, and a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a imply a = xs and b = xt for some 1 \u2264 s < t \u2264 v. Thus, we have five cases: (1) 1 \u2264 k\u0304 < s, (2) t < k\u0304 \u2264 v, (3) k\u0304 = s, (4) k\u0304 = t and (5) s < k\u0304 < t. In each case, we induce a contradiction.\nThe first two cases are symmetric. We focus on the verification of case (1). Thus, x\u0304 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. We show D \u2286 DSSP(GA\u223c, a). First, given arbitrary Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on the tree GA\u223c = G Aa\u21c0b \u223c \u222a [ G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u222aGA b\u21c0a \u223c ] w.r.t. a, which consists of two parts: (i) semi-single-peakedness on GA a\u21c0b\n\u223c = T A b\u21c0a w.r.t. a, and (ii) a Pi x for all x \u2208 A\\Aa\u21c0b. Since r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, both parts follow from (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A. Second, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 \u222a Ab\u21c0a, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on the tree GA\u223c = GA a\u21c0b \u223c \u222a [ G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u222aGA b\u21c0a \u223c ]\nw.r.t. a, which consists of two parts: (i) a Pi x for all x \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, and (ii) semi-single-peakedness on G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u222aGA b\u21c0a\n\u223c w.r.t. a. Since r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009\u222aAb\u21c0a, part (i) follows from (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A. For part (ii), recall the contradictory hypothesis that Pi is semi-single-peaked on G A \u223c w.r.t. xk\u0304. Since a \u2208 \u3008x, xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 for all x \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 \u222a Ab\u21c0a, it is also true that Pi is semi-single-peaked on G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u222a GA b\u21c0a \u223c w.r.t. a, as required. Therefore, D \u2286 DSSP(GA\u223c, a). Now, by statement (ii) of Clarification 1, according to semi-single-peakedness on GA\u223c w.r.t. a and diversity, we know |NA\u223c (a)| \u2264 2, which implies NA\u223c (a) = NA\u223c (xs) = {xs\u22121, xs+1}. It is clear that xs\u22121 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and xs+1 \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Then, NA\u223c (a) \u2229 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 = {xs+1} implies a \u2208 Leaf ( G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ) . Thus, we know that all preferences of D are semi-single-peaked on the tree GA\u223c w.r.t. a which is a leaf of G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c . This contradicts condition (iii) of Definition 6.\nCases (3) and (4) are symmetric. We focus on the verification of case (3). Thus, we have\nD \u2286 DSSP(GA\u223c, a). Then, by the verification in case (1), we induce the same contradiction. Last, let case (5) occur. Recall that xk\u0304 has at most two neighbors in G A \u223c, which is mentioned in the beginning of the proof. Thus, we know NA\u223c (xk\u0304) = {x \u00afk\u22121, xk\u0304+1}. We cut the tree GA\u223c at the edge (xk\u0304\u22121, xk\u0304), and obtain the subset B = { x \u2208 A : xk\u0304 \u2208 \u3008x, xk\u0304\u22121|GA\u223c\u3009 } and the subtree GB\u223c. It is clear that the subtrees G Aa\u21c0b \u223c and G B \u223c are separated, i.e., A\na\u21c0b \u2229 B = \u2205. Let B\u0302 =[ A\\[Aa\u21c0b\u222aB] ] \u222a{a, xk\u0304}. Clearly, B\u0302 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Furthermore, we construct a line \u03c0 = (z1, . . . , zq) over all alternatives of B\u0302 such that q = |B\u0302|, z1 = a, zq = xk\u0304, and all alternatives of B\u0302\\{a, xk\u0304} are arbitrarily arranged in the interior of the line \u03c0. By combining the subtree GA a\u21c0b\n\u223c , the line\n\u03c0 and the subtree GB\u223c, we generate a tree T\u0302 A. Clearly, a and xk\u0304 are dual-thresholds in T\u0302 A. Let A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304 = { x \u2208 A : a \u2208 \u3008x, xk\u0304|T\u0302 A\u3009 } and A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a = { x \u2208 A : xk\u0304 \u2208 \u3008x, a|T\u0302 A\u3009 } . Note that A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304 = Aa\u21c0b and A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a = B. We next show D \u2286 DSH(T\u0302 A, a, xk\u0304). First, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304\\{a}, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on T\u0302 A w.r.t. a, and maxPi ( A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a ) = xk\u0304. Since T\u0302 A = GA a\u21c0b \u223c \u222a [ \u03c0\u222aGB\u223c ] , the semi-single-peakedness requirement on T\u0302 A w.r.t. a consists of the following two parts: (i) semi-single-peakedness on GA a\u21c0b\n\u223c = T A b\u21c0a w.r.t. a, and (ii) a Pi x for all\nx \u2208 A\\Aa\u21c0b. Since r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304\\{a} = Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, both parts follow from (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A. Furthermore, since r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304 = Aa\u21c0b, we know that for all x \u2208 A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a = B, x /\u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 and Proj ( x, \u3008r1(Pi), xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = xk\u0304. Then, by the contradictory hypothesis that Pi is semi-single-peaked on G A \u223c w.r.t. xk\u0304, we have max Pi ( A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a ) = xk\u0304, as required. Second, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a\\{xk\u0304}, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on T\u0302 A w.r.t. xk\u0304, and maxPi ( A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304 ) = a. Since T\u0302 A = [ GA a\u21c0b \u223c \u222a\u03c0 ] \u222aGB\u223c, the semi-single-peakedness requirement on T\u0302 A w.r.t. xk\u0304 consists of the following two parts: (i) semi-single-peakedness on GB\u223c w.r.t. xk\u0304, and (ii) xk\u0304 Pi x for all x \u2208 A\\B. Indeed, both parts follow from the contradictory hypothesis that Pi is semisingle-peaked on GA\u223c w.r.t. xk\u0304. Furthermore, since r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a\\{xk\u0304} = B\\{xk\u0304} \u2286 A\\Aa\u21c0b, (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A implies maxPi(A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304) = maxPi(Aa\u21c0b) = a, as required. Last, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008a, xk\u0304|T\u0302 A\u3009, we show maxPi ( A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304 ) = a and maxPi ( A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a ) = xk\u0304. Since r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008a, xk\u0304|T\u0302 A\u3009 = B\u0302 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A implies maxPi(A\u0302a\u21c0xk\u0304) = maxPi(Aa\u21c0b) = a, as required. Note that for each x \u2208 A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a\\{xk\u0304} = B\\{xk\u0304}, x /\u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 and Proj ( x, \u3008r1(Pi), xk\u0304|GA\u223c\u3009 ) = xk\u0304. Then, by the contradictory hypothesis that Pi is semi-single-\npeaked on GA\u223c w.r.t. xk\u0304, we have xk\u0304 Pi x for all x \u2208 A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a\\{xk\u0304}, which implies maxPi ( A\u0302xk\u0304\u21c0a ) =\nxk\u0304, as required. In conclusion, we have D \u2286 DSH ( T\u0302 A, a, xk\u0304 ) and \u3008a, xk\u0304|T\u0302 A\u3009 = B\u0302 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 which\ncontradict condition (ii) of Definition 6. This proves the lemma, and completes the verification of\nthe \u201cif part\u201d of Statement (ii).\nHenceforth, we show the \u201conly if part\u201d of Statement (ii): \u201cThere exists no invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule.\u201d \u21d2 \u201cDomain D is a semi-hybrid domain satisfying the unique seconds property.\u201d, and show that every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule defined on D is a hybrid rule and behaves like a dictatorship on the free zone.\nFirst, since D is a non-dictatorial, unidimensional domain, the Auxiliary Proposition implies that D satisfies the unique seconds property.38\nNext, we show that D is a semi-hybrid domain.39 Since D satisfies path-connectedness, it is clear that GA\u223c is a connected graph. First, since D \u2286 P = DSH(LA, a1, am), there must exist a tree T A and dual-thresholds a, b \u2208 A such that D \u2286 DSH(T A, a, b). Hence, condition (i) of Definition 6 is satisfied. Furthermore, since A is finite, we can push that the searching of the tree T A and the dual-thresholds a, b \u2208 A towards the limit that there exist no tree T\u0302 A and dual-thresholds a\u0302, b\u0302 \u2208 A such that D \u2286 DSH(T\u0302 A, a\u0302, b\u0302) and \u3008a\u0302, b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Thus, condition (ii) of Definition 6 is met. Last, we show that D satisfies condition (iii) of Definition 6. Let GA\u223c be a tree. Since GA\u223c is a combination of the subtree G Aa\u21c0b \u223c = T A a\u21c0b , the connected subgraph G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c and the subtree GA b\u21c0a\n\u223c = T A b\u21c0a , it must be the case that G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is a tree as well. Since by hypothesis\nthere exists no invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, Statement (i) implies that D is not a semi-single-peaked domain, which immediately implies that for each x \u2208 Leaf ( G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ) , there exists a preference Pi \u2208 D such that Pi is not semi-single-peaked on GA\u223c w.r.t. x, as required. In conclusion, D is an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on a tree T A. Recall the two completely reversed preference P i and P i included in D and their peaks r1(P i) = a1 and r1(P i) = am. By Lemma 11, we henceforth assume w.l.o.g. that a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a.\nLast, we fix an arbitrary two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule f : D2 \u2192 A,40 and show that f is a hybrid rule and behaves like a dictatorship on the free zone \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Since there exists no invariant, tops-only and strategy-proof rule, we know f(a1, am) = f(P 1, P 2) 6= f(P 1, P 2) = f(am, a1). The proof consists of the following three steps:\nStep 1. We construct a line over all alternatives involved in the path(s) connecting a1 and am in GA\u223c (see all proofs before Lemma 13), and partially characterize f according to the constructed line (see Lemma 13). Step 2. We construct a tree T Af where the two social outcomes f(a1, am) and f(am, a1) are dualthresholds, using the adjacency graph GA\u223c and the partial characterization of f (see Lemmas 14 and 15). Then, we completely characterize f to be a hybrid rule on T Af w.r.t. the dual-thresholds f(a1, am) and f(am, a1) (see Lemmas 16 and 17), which indicates that f behaves like a dictatorship on the interval between f(a1, am) and f(am, a1) in T Af . Furthermore, we elicit some preference restriction embedded in D via strategy-proofness of f (see Lemma 18), which may be different from the aforementioned preference restriction of (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A. Step 3. Note that the preference restriction elicited in Step 2 and the preference restriction of (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A must be compatible with each other as they are both embedded in D. We use the compatibility of these two preference restrictions to show that the interval between f(a1, am) and f(am, a1) in T Af is a superset of the interval \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, which of course implies that f behaves like a dictatorship on \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 (see Lemma 20).\nLet \u03a0(a1, am) denote the set of paths in G A \u223c connecting a1 and am. Clearly, \u03a0(a1, am) 6= \u2205. Let\n38It is worth mentioning that this is the only place in the proof where leaf symmetry plays a role. 39We are grateful to an anonymous referee for suggesting the proof. 40Such a rule always exists, e.g., a dictatorship.\nB = { a \u2208 A : a \u2208 \u03c0 for some \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am) } . Note that B may not include all alternatives of A, and all paths of \u03a0(a1, am) are included in G B \u223c which hence implies that G B \u223c is connected. There are two cases: |\u03a0(a1, am)| = 1 and |\u03a0(a1, am)| > 1. In the first case, let LB = (x1, . . . , xv) be the path in GA\u223c that connects a1 and am, where v = |B|.\nNext, assume |\u03a0(a1, am)| > 1. Fix an arbitrary path \u03c0 = (z1, . . . , z\u03c9) \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am). Since |\u03a0(a1, am)| > 1 and all paths of \u03a0(a1, am) start from a1 and end at am, we can identify x, y \u2208 \u03c0, say x = zs and y = z\u03c9\u2212p, where 1 \u2264 s < \u03c9\u2212 p \u2264 \u03c9, satisfying the following two conditions: (i) s is the maximum index agreed by all paths of \u03a0(a1, am) in the direction from a1 to am, i.e., for each path \u03c0\u2032 = (z\u20321, . . . , z \u2032 \u03c3) \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am)\\{\u03c0}, zk = z\u2032k for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , s}, and for some path \u03c0\u2032\u2032 = (z\u2032\u20321 , . . . , z \u2032\u2032 q ) \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am)\\{\u03c0}, zs+1 6= z\u2032\u2032s+1, and (ii) \u03c9\u2212p is the minimum index agreed by all paths of \u03a0(a1, am) in the direction from am to a1, i.e., for each path \u03c0 \u2032 = (z\u20321, . . . , z \u2032 \u03c3) \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am)\\{\u03c0}, z\u03c9\u2212k = z \u2032 \u03c3\u2212k for all k \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , p}, and for some path \u03c0\u2032\u2032 = (z\u2032\u20321 , . . . , z\u2032\u2032q ) \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am)\\{\u03c0}, z\u03c9\u2212p\u22121 6= z\u2032\u2032q\u2212p\u22121. Thus, we can pin down the adjacency graph GB\u223c: \u03c0L = (z1, . . . , zs) is the unique path in GB\u223c connecting a1 and x, \u03c0 R = (z\u03c9\u2212p, . . . , z\u03c9) is the unique path in G B \u223c connecting y and am, the set O = {a \u2208 B : a /\u2208 \u03c0L \u222a \u03c0R} \u222a {x, y} contains at least three alternatives41, and GO\u223c is a connected graph and has no leaf (see the first diagram of Figure 8). We next construct a line (x, . . . , y) over all alternatives of O such that x and y are the two leaves, and all alternatives of O\\{x, y} are arbitrarily arranged in the interior of the line. Then, by combining \u03c0L, (x, . . . , y) and \u03c0R, we construct a line LB = (x1, . . . , xs, . . . , xt, . . . , xv), where v = |B|, 1 \u2264 s < t \u2264 v, t \u2212 s > 1, x1 = a1, xs = x, xt = y, xv = am, (x1, . . . , xs) = \u03c0L, (xs, . . . , xt) = (x, . . . , y) and (xt, . . . , xv) = \u03c0 R (see the second diagram of Figure 8). We intentionally let the notation of the constructed line LB here be identical to the line LB in the case |\u03a0(a1, am)| = 1. This helps us unify the henceforth proof for both cases, and does not create any loss of generality.\nIn the case |\u03a0(a1, am)| = 1, statement (i) of Lemma 5 and the violation of invariance imply f(x1, xv) = xk and f(xv, x1) = xk for some distinct k, k \u2208 {1, . . . , v}. We assume w.l.o.g. that k < k, which by statement (i) of Lemma 6 implies that voter 1 dictates on \u3008xk, xk|L\nB\u3009. In the case |\u03a0(a1, am)| > 1, since GO\u223c is a connected graph and has no leaf, statement (i) of Lemma 4 implies that f behaves like a dictatorship on O = \u3008xs, xt|LB\u3009. We assume w.l.o.g. that voter 1 dictates on \u3008xs, xt|LB\u3009, i.e., f(xk, xk\u2032) = xk for all k, k\u2032 \u2208 {s, . . . , t}. This helps us unify the henceforth proof for both cases. Thus, f(xs, xt) = xs and f(xt, xs) = xt. Then, according to the paths (xt, . . . , xv)\nand (x1, . . . , xs), statement (ii) of Lemma 5 implies f(xs, xv) = xs and f(xt, x1) = xt. Furthermore,\naccording to (x1, . . . , xs) and (xt, . . . , xv), by statement (iii) of Lemma 5, f(xs, xv) = xs implies f(x1, xv) = xk for some k \u2208 {1, . . . , s}, and f(xt, x1) = xt implies f(xv, x1) = xk for some k \u2208 {t, . . . , v}.\nThe next lemma provide a unified characterization of f on the line LB.\nLemma 13 According to LB = (x1, . . . , xv), we have f(xk, xk\u2032) =  xk if k \u2264 k \u2264 k, xmed(k, k\u2032, k) if k < k, and\nxmed(k, k\u2032, k) if k > k.\n41It is clear that |O| \u2265 2. If |O| = 2, all paths of \u03a0(a1, am) degenerate to an identical path.\nProof: If |\u03a0(a1, am)| = 1, the lemma follows from statement (i) of Lemma 6. Next, we assume |\u03a0(a1, am)| > 1. Note that for each path \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am), since f(x1, xv) = xk \u2208 \u3008a1, x|\u03c0\u3009 and f(xv, x1) = xk \u2208 \u3008y, am|\u03c0\u3009, statement (i) of Lemma 6 holds on \u03c0. To prove the lemma, we fix an arbitrary profile (xk, xk\u2032).\nFirst, let k \u2264 k \u2264 k. If k \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k, then by voter 1\u2019s dictatorship on \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009, we have f(xk, xk\u2032) = xk. If k \u2032 < k or k\u2032 > k, we know that there exists a path \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am) which includes both xk and xk\u2032 . Clearly, xk \u2208 \u3008xk, xk|\u03c0\u3009. Then, statement (i) of Lemma 6 on \u03c0 implies f(xk, xk\u2032) = xk. Second, let k < k. Then, there exists a path \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0(a1, am) which includes both xk and xk\u2032 . Clearly, xk \u2208 \u3008x1, xk|\u03c0\u3009\\{xk}. Then, statement (i) of Lemma 6 on \u03c0 implies f(xk, xk\u2032) = xmed(k, k\u2032, k). Symmetrically, if k > k, statement (i) of Lemma 6 implies f(xk, xk\u2032) = xmed(k, k\u2032, k). This proves the lemma, and completes Step 1 of the proof.\nLemma 14 Fixing an alternative z \u2208 A and a path \u03c0 = (z1, . . . , zs) in GA\u223c, where z1 = z and s \u2265 2, the following two statements hold:\n(i) if zs\u22121 = xk\u22121 and zs = xk, then \u03c0 is the unique path in G A \u223c connecting z and xk, and\n(ii) if zs\u22121 = xk+1 and zs = xk, then \u03c0 is the unique path in G A \u223c connecting z and xk.\nProof: The two statements are symmetric, and we hence focus on the verification of the first one. Suppose that there exists another path \u03c0\u2032 = (y1, . . . , yt) in G A \u223c connecting z and xk. Then, we can identify a cycle C in GA\u223c such that (i) C \u2286 \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032, (ii) \u03c0 \u2229 C 6= \u2205 and (iii) each edge in C belong to \u03c0 or \u03c0\u2032. Clearly, by Observation 1, f behaves like a dictatorship on C. We further identify the alternative zk\u2217 \u2208 \u03c0 \u2229 C such that zk /\u2208 C for all k \u2208 {k\u2217 + 1, . . . , s}. We consider two cases: k\u2217 = s and k\u2217 < s.\nIn the first case, we show that xk\u22121 is also included in C. On the one hand, as included in C, xk has two distinct neighbors in C. On the other hand, xk has a unique neighbor in \u03c0, which is xk\u22121, and a unique neighbor in \u03c0 \u2032. Therefore, it must be true that xk\u22121 is included in C. Hence, xk\u22121, xk \u2208 C. In the second case, we have the path (zk\u2217 , . . . , zs), which contains both xk\u22121 and xk. Recall by Lemma 13 that voter 1 dictates on \u3008xk, xk|L\nB\u3009. In the first case, C\u2229\u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009 6= \u2205, while in the second case, the cycle C and the adjacency graph over \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009, which both are connected graphs and contain at least two alternatives, are linked via the path (zk\u2217 , . . . , zs). Therefore, Lemma 2 implies that voter 1 dictates on {zs\u22121, zs}. Consequently, we have f(xk\u22121, xk) = f(zs\u22121, zs) = zs\u22121 = xk\u22121 6= xmed(k\u22121, k, k), which contradicts Lemma 13. Hence, \u03c0 is the unique path in GA\u223c connecting z and xk.\nWe construct the following five sets: B = { z \u2208 A : there exists a path (z1, . . . , zs) in GA\u223c connecting z and xk such that zs\u22121 = xk\u22121 } ,\nB = { z \u2208 A : there exists a path (z1, . . . , zs) in GA\u223c connecting z and xk such that zs\u22121 = xk+1 } ,\nA = B \u222a {xk}, A = B \u222a {xk}, and M = { z \u2208 A : z /\u2208 B \u222aB } .\nThe next lemma shows that GA\u223c is a combination of three adjacency graphs G A \u223c, G M \u223c and G A \u223c,\ndenoted by GA\u223c = G A \u223c \u222aGM\u223c \u222aGA\u223c.\nLemma 15 We have GA\u223c = G A \u223c \u222aGM\u223c \u222aGA\u223c.\nProof: First, it is clear that A = A\u222aM\u222aA and EA\u223c \u2287 EA\u223c\u222aEM\u223c \u222aEA\u223c . To prove EA\u223c = EA\u223c\u222aEM\u223c \u222aEA\u223c , it suffices to show that in GA\u223c, no alternative of B is adjacent to any alternative not in A, and no alternative of B is adjacent to any alternative not in A.\nGiven z \u2208 B and y /\u2208 A, suppose by contradiction that (z, y) \u2208 EA\u223c . Let (z1, . . . , zs) be the unique path in GA\u223c that connects z and xk, where zs\u22121 = xk\u22121. It is evident that y /\u2208 A implies y 6= xk = zs. Moreover, since z1, . . . , zs\u22121 \u2208 B by definition, it is true that y /\u2208 {z1, . . . , zs\u22121}. Consequently, we have a path (y, z1, . . . , zs) in G A \u223c that connects y and xk, which by definition implies y \u2208 B \u2282 A - a contradiction. Therefore, (z, y) /\u2208 EA\u223c . Symmetrically, given z\u2032 \u2208 B and y\u2032 /\u2208 A, we have (z\u2032, y\u2032) /\u2208 EA\u223c .\nBy Lemma 14 and the construction of A and A, one can easily infer that GA\u223c and G A \u223c are two trees. Immediately, since GA\u223c is a connected graph, Lemma 15 implies that G M \u223c is a connected graph as well. In particular, when A 6= {xk}, we know that xk\u22121 must be contained in A, and more importantly, for every z \u2208 B, xk\u22121 is included in the path in GA\u223c that connects z and xk. Therefore, it must be the case that xk\u22121 is the unique neighbor of xk in G A \u223c, and hence xk \u2208 Leaf(GA\u223c). Symmetrically, if A 6= {xk}, xk+1 is the unique neighbor of xk in G A \u223c and xk \u2208 Leaf(G A \u223c).\nNow, we construct a line LM over all alternatives of M such that xk and xk are the two leaves of the line, and all alternatives of M\\{xk, xk} are arbitrarily arranged in the interior of the line. By combining GA\u223c, LM and GA\u223c, we generate a tree T Af . Clearly, by construction, T Af = G A \u223c and T Af = GA\u223c. By construction, xk and xk are dual-thresholds in T A f . Thus, according\nto T Af and GA\u223c, we have Axk\u21c0xk = { x \u2208 A : xk \u2208 \u3008x, xk|T A f \u3009 } = A, \u3008xk, xk|T A f \u3009 = M , and\nAxk\u21c0xk = { x \u2208 A : xk \u2208 \u3008x, xk|T A f \u3009 } = A. In the rest of proof, for notational convenience, we use the notation A, M and A, instead of Axk\u21c0xk , \u3008xk, xk|T A\u3009 and Axk\u21c0xk .\nThe next lemma shows that voter 1 dictates on M .\nLemma 16 We have f(z, z\u2032) = z for all z, z\u2032 \u2208M .\nProof: By the definition of B and B, one can easily notice \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009 \u2286 M . According to the connected graph GM\u223c , we know that either Leaf(G M \u223c ) = \u2205 or Leaf(GM\u223c ) 6= \u2205 holds. If Leaf(GM\u223c ) = \u2205, the lemma follows from statement (i) of Lemma 4 and the hypothesis that voter 1 dictates on \u3008xk, xk|L\nB\u3009 \u2286 M . Henceforth, let Leaf(GM\u223c ) 6= \u2205. To complete the verification, by statement (ii) of Lemma 4, we show that given an arbitrary x \u2208 Leaf(GM\u223c ) and (x, y) \u2208 EM\u223c , f behaves likes dictatorship on {x, y}. We have two cases: x \u2208 {xk, xk} and x \u2208M\\{xk, xk}. In the first case, since G \u3008xk,xk|L B\u3009\n\u223c is a connected graph nested in GM\u223c (implied by \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009 \u2286 M), we\nknow that xk has a neighbor that is in \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009 \u2286 M . Then, x \u2208 Leaf(GM\u223c ) and (x, y) \u2208 EM\u223c imply y \u2208 \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009. Consequently, by Lemma 13, f behaves likes dictatorship on {x, y}, as required. Henceforth, let the second case hold: x \u2208M\\{xk, xk}. Since the adjacency graph over \u3008xk, xk|L\nB\u3009 is a connected graph, we fix a path \u03c0 = (y1, . . . , yt) such that y1, . . . , yt \u2208 \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009, y1 = xk and yt = xk. Since x /\u2208 {xk, xx} and x \u2208 Leaf(G M \u223c ), it is evident that x /\u2208 \u03c0. Moreover, since GM\u223c is a connected graph, we can identify an alternative ys \u2208 \u03c0 and a path \u03c0\u2032 = (z1, . . . , zp) in GM\u223c connecting ys and x, such that z2, . . . , zp /\u2208 \u03c0. Clearly, since x \u2208 Leaf(GM\u223c ) and (x, y) \u2208 EM\u223c , we have zp\u22121 = y and hence p \u2265 2. By Lemma 13, we know that f behaves likes dictatorship on \u03c0. Since z1 = ys \u2208 \u03c0, f behaves likes dictatorship on the set \u03c0 \u222a {z1}. We pick an arbitrary l \u2208 {2, . . . , p}, and provide an induction hypothesis: SCF f behaves like a dictatorship on \u03c0 \u222a {z1, . . . , zl\u22121}. We show that f behaves like a dictatorship on \u03c0 \u222a {z1, . . . , zl}. Furthermore, by Lemma 2, it suffices to show that voter 1 dictates on {zl\u22121, zl}, i.e., f(zl\u22121, zl) = zl\u22121 and f(zl, zl\u22121) = zl.\nSince zl\u22121 \u223c zl, it is evident that f(zl\u22121, zl) \u2208 {zl\u22121, zl} and f(zl, zl\u22121) \u2208 {zl\u22121, zl}. Suppose f(zl\u22121, zl) = zl. Then, according to the path (zl\u22121, . . . , z1), statement (ii) of Lemma 5 implies f(z1, zl) = zl. Given P 2 = P i and P 2 = P i, since z1 = ys \u2208 \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009, Lemma 13 implies f(z1, P 2) = f(z1, x1) = z1 and f(z1, P 2) = f(z1, xv) = z1. Then, strategy-proofness implies\nz1 P 2 zl and z1 P 2 zl which contradicts the fact that P 2 and P 2 are complete reversals. Therefore, f(zl\u22121, zl) = zl\u22121, as required.\nLast, we show f(zl, zl\u22121) = zl. Suppose not, i.e., f(zl, zl\u22121) = zl\u22121. First, since zl\u22121, . . . , z2 \u2208 M\\\u03c0, we know zl\u22121, . . . , z2 /\u2208 A \u222a A. Then, we can construct two concatenated paths \u03c0\u0304 = (zl\u22121, . . . , z1 = ys, . . . , y1 = xk, . . . , x1) and \u03c0\u0302 = (zl\u22121, . . . , z1 = ys, . . . , yt = xk, . . . , xv). Then, according to \u03c0\u0304 and \u03c0\u0302, statement (iii) of Lemma 5 implies f(zl, x1) \u2208 \u03c0\u0304 and f(zl, xv) \u2208 \u03c0\u0302. Next, we show the following claim.\nClaim 1: We have f(zl\u22121, x1) = zl\u22121 and f(zl\u22121, xv) = zl\u22121.\nThere are two cases: l = 2 and l > 2. In the first case, zl\u22121 = ys \u2208 \u3008xk, xk|L B\u3009. Then, Lemma 13 implies f(zl\u22121, x1) = zl\u22121 and f(zl\u22121, xv) = zl\u22121. In the second case, the induction hypothesis implies f(zl\u22121, y1) = zl\u22121 and f(zl\u22121, yt) = zl\u22121. Note that zl\u22121 /\u2208 \u03c0 implies zl\u22121 6= y1 and zl\u22121 6= yt. Then, according to the paths (y1 = xk, . . . , x1) and (yt = xk, . . . , xv) which both clearly exclude zl\u22121, by statement (ii) of Lemma 5, f(zl\u22121, y1) = zl\u22121 implies f(zl\u22121, x1) = zl\u22121,\nand f(zl\u22121, yt) = zl\u22121 implies f(zl\u22121, xv) = zl\u22121. This completes the verification of the claim.\nFurthermore, since zl \u223c zl\u22121, by statement (iii) of Lemma 5, Claim 1 implies f(zl, x1) \u2208 {zl\u22121, zl} and f(zl, xv) \u2208 {zl\u22121, zl}. Therefore, we have f(zl, x1) \u2208 \u03c0\u0304 \u2229 {zl\u22121, zl} = {zl\u22121} and f(zl, xv) \u2208 \u03c0\u0302 \u2229 {zl\u22121, zl} = {zl\u22121}, which respectively imply f(zl, x1) = zl\u22121 and f(zl, xv) = zl\u22121. Thus, given P 2 = P i and P 2 = P i, we have f(zl, P 2) = zl\u22121 and f(zl, P 2) = zl\u22121. Consequently, given f(zl, zl) = zl by unanimity, strategy-proofness implies zl\u22121 P 2 zl and zl\u22121 P 2 zl, which contradicts the fact that P 2 and P 2 are complete reversals. Hence, f(zl, zl\u22121) = zl, as required. This completes the verification of the induction hypothesis. Therefore, f behaves like a dictatorship on {x, y}, as required. This proves the lemma.\nLemma 17 SCF f is a hybrid rule on T Af w.r.t. xk and xk, i.e., for all x, y \u2208 A,\nf(x, y) =  x if x \u2208M, Proj ( xk, \u3008x, y|T Af \u3009 ) if x \u2208 A\\{xk}, and\nProj ( xk, \u3008x, y|T A f \u3009 ) if x \u2208 A\\{xk}.\nProof: We first know that voter 1 dictates on M by Lemma 16. Next, given x \u2208 M and y \u2208 A\\{xk}, we show f(x, y) = x. By a symmetric argument, we can show f(x, y) = x for all x \u2208 M and y \u2208 A\\{xk}. Since y \u2208 A\\{xk}, we know A 6= {xk} and hence xk\u22121 \u2208 A\\{xk}. Then, we have f(xk, xk\u22121) = xk by Lemma 13. In G M \u223c , there exists a path (z1, . . . , zs) connecting xk and x. Then, by statement (iii) of Lemma 5, f(xk, xk\u22121) = xk implies f(x, xk\u22121) \u2208 {z1, . . . , zs}. Suppose f(x, xk\u22121) = zk for some k \u2208 {1, . . . , s\u22121}. Then, strategy-proofness implies f(x, zk) = zk which contradicts Lemma 13. Therefore, f(x, xk\u22121) = zs = x. Furthermore, in G A \u223c, we have a path (y1, . . . , yt) connecting xk\u22121 and y. Clearly, x is not included in (y1, . . . , yt). Then, by statement\n(ii) of Lemma 5, f(x, xk\u22121) = x implies f(x, y) = x, as required. Second, given x \u2208 A\\{xk} and y \u2208 A, we show f(x, y) = Proj ( xk, \u3008x, y|T Af \u3009 ) . Since x \u2208 A\\{xk}, we know A 6= {xk} and xk\u22121 \u2208 A\\{xk}. Then, Lemma 13 implies f(xk\u22121, xk) = xk. We consider two cases: y \u2208 \u3008xk, xk|T A f \u3009 \u222a A and y \u2208 A\\{xk}. In the first case, we have a path (y1, . . . , ys) in the connected graph G M \u223c \u222a GA\u223c connecting xk and y. Then, by statement (iii) of Lemma 5, f(xk\u22121, xk) = xk implies f(xk\u22121, y) \u2208 {y1, . . . , ys}. Meanwhile, since f(xk, y) = xk and xk\u22121 \u223c xk, statement (iii) of Lemma 5 implies f(xk\u22121, y) \u2208 {xk, xk\u22121}. Therefore, f(xk\u22121, y) \u2208 {y1, . . . , ys} \u2229 {xk, xk\u22121} = {xk}, and hence f(xk\u22121, y) = xk. Furthermore, in GA\u223c, we have the path (z1, . . . , zt) connecting xk\u22121 and x. Clearly, xk is not included in (z1, . . . , zt). Then,\nby statement (ii) of Lemma 5, f(xk\u22121, y) = xk implies f(x, y) = xk = Proj ( xk, \u3008x, y|T Af \u3009 ) , as\nrequired. In the second case, we have a path \u03c0 in GA\u223c connecting x and y. Then, statement (i) of Lemma 5 implies f(x, y) \u2208 \u03c0. Meanwhile, we have f(xk, y) = xk by the verification in the first paragraph and f(x, xk) = xk by the verification of the first case. Note that in G A \u223c, there exist a path \u03c0\u2032 connecting xk and x, and a path \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 connecting xk and y. Then, by statement (iii) of Lemma 5, f(xk, y) = xk implies f(x, y) \u2208 \u03c0\u2032, and f(x, xk) = xk implies f(x, y) \u2208 \u03c0\u2032\u2032. Therefore, f(x, y) \u2208 \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032\u2032. Last, since GA\u223c is a tree, it is true that \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032\u2032 = { Proj(xk, \u3008x, y|T Af \u3009) } .\nHence, we have f(x, y) = Proj ( xk, \u3008x, y|T Af \u3009 ) , as required. Symmetrically, when x \u2208 A\\{xk}, we\ncan show f(x, y) = Proj ( xk, \u3008x, y|T A f \u3009 ) for all y \u2208 A. This proves the lemma. Lemma 18 We have D \u2286 DSH ( T Af , xk, xk ) .\nProof: First, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 A\\{xk}, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on T Af w.r.t. xk and maxPi(A) = xk. Let P1 = Pi. Given distinct x, y \u2208 \u3008r1(P1), xk|T A f \u3009 such that\nx \u2208 \u3008r1(P1), y|T Af \u3009, we by Lemma 17 have f(P1, x) = Proj ( xk, \u3008r1(P1), x|T Af \u3009 ) = x and f(y, x) =\nProj ( xk, \u3008y, x|T Af \u3009 ) = y. Then, strategy-proofness implies x P1 y, which meets condition (i) of\nDefinition 4. Given x /\u2208 \u3008r1(P1), xk|T Af \u3009 and x\u0302 = Proj ( x, \u3008r1(P1), xk|T Af \u3009 ) , we by Lemma 17 have\nf(P1, x) = Proj ( xk, \u3008r1(P1), x|T Af \u3009 ) = Proj ( x, \u3008r1(P1), xk|T Af \u3009 ) = x\u0302 and f(x, x) = x. Immediately, strategy-proofness implies x\u0302 P1 x, which meets condition (ii) of Definition 4. Therefore, Pi is semi-single-peaked on T Af w.r.t. xk, as required. Next, to show maxPi(A) = xk, we fix P2 = Pi and an arbitrary x \u2208 A\\{xk}, and show xk P2 x. Since f(x, P2) = Proj ( xk, \u3008x, r1(P2)|T A f \u3009 )\n= xk by Lemma 17 and f(x, x) = x by unanimity, strategy-proofness implies xk P2 x, as required.\nSymmetrically, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 A\\{xk}, we can show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on T Af w.r.t. xk and max Pi(A) = xk.\nLast, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008xk, xk|T A f \u3009 = M , we show maxPi(A) = xk and maxPi(A) = xk. Fixing P2 = Pi, an arbitrary x \u2208 A\\{xk} and an arbitrary y \u2208 A\\{xk}, it suffices to show xk P2 x and xk P2 y. By Lemma 17, we have f(x, P2) = Proj ( xk, \u3008x, r1(P2)|T Af \u3009 ) = xk and f(x, x) = x. Then, strategy-proofness implies xk P2 x, as required. Symmetrically, f(y, P2) =\nProj ( xk, \u3008y, r1(P2)|T A f \u3009 ) = xk and f(y, y) = y, which by strategy-proofness imply xk P2 y, as required. This proves the lemma, and completes Step 2 of the proof.\nNow, we start the verification of Step 3. We first make one observation that henceforth will be repeatedly applied according to the line LB = (x1, . . . , xv) constructed in Step 1 (note that LB may not be a path in GA\u223c) and (xk, xk)-semi-hybridness on T A f established in Lemma 18.\nObservation 2 If k > 1, then (x1, . . . , xk) is the unique path in G A \u223c (also in G A \u223c) connecting a1 and a, and NA\u223c (xk) \u2229 A = {xk\u22121}; if k < v, then (xv, . . . , xk) is the unique path in G A \u223c (also in GA\u223c) connecting am and b, and NA\u223c (xk) \u2229A = {xk+1}. Moreover, xk, . . . , xk \u2208M .\nRecall that D is an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on T A. Hence, the adjacency graph GA\u223c is a combination of the subtree GA a\u21c0b\n\u223c = T A a\u21c0b , the connected subgraph G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c and the subtree\nGA b\u21c0a \u223c = T A b\u21c0a , i.e., GA\u223c = G Aa\u21c0b \u223c \u222aG \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u222aGA b\u21c0a\n\u223c . Moreover, since a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, we know that in every path of \u03a0(a1, am), a and b must be included, and a is located closer to a1 than b. Then, according to the line LB = (x1, . . . , xv) constructed in Step 1, it must be the case that a = xp and b = xq for some 1 \u2264 p < q \u2264 v.\nLemma 19 According to the line LB = (x1, . . . , xv) and (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, if p > 1, then (x1, . . . , xp) is the unique path in G A \u223c (also in G Aa\u21c0b \u223c ) connecting a1 and a, and NA\u223c (xp)\u2229Aa\u21c0b = {xp\u22121}; if q < v, then (xv, . . . , xq) is the unique path in GA\u223c (also in GA b\u21c0a \u223c ) connecting am and b, and NA\u223c (xq) \u2229Ab\u21c0a = {xq+1}. Moreover, xp, . . . , xq \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009.\nProof: First, let p > 1. Note that if (x1, . . . , xp) is a path in G A \u223c connecting a1 and a, then by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, it is true that (x1, . . . , xp) is the unique path in GA\u223c (also in GA a\u21c0b \u223c ) connecting a1 and a, and a \u2208 Leaf(T A a\u21c0b ) which by statement (ii) of Clarification 2 implies NA\u223c (xp) \u2229 Aa\u21c0b = {xp\u22121}. Henceforth, we focus on showing that (x1, . . . , xp) is a path in GA\u223c connecting a1 and a. Recall the set \u03a0(a1, am) specified in Step 1 that contains all paths connecting a1 and am in G A \u223c. If |\u03a0(a1, am)| = 1, then the line LB is a path in GA\u223c connecting a1 and am, which immediately implies that (x1, . . . , xp) is a path in G A \u223c connecting a1 and a, as required. Next, let |\u03a0(a1, am)| > 1. By (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A and Clarification 3, we first know that the following (a, b)-hybrid rule on T A is tops-only and strategy-proof on D: for all P1, P2 \u2208 D,\ng(P1, P2) =  r1(P1) if r1(P1) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, Proj ( a, \u3008r1(P1), r1(P2)|T A\u3009 ) if r1(P1) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, and\nProj ( b, \u3008r1(P1), r1(P2)|T A\u3009 ) if r1(P1) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}.\nClearly, g behaves like a dictatorship on \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Meanwhile, recall the adjacency graph GB\u223c in Figure 8 and the fact that every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule behaves like a dictatorship on the set O. Therefore, it must be the case that O \u2286 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Thus, in Figure 8, we have g(xs, xt) = xs. Note that (x1, . . . , xs) and (xt, . . . , xv) are two paths in G A \u223c according to GO\u223c. Then, according to the paths (xt, . . . , xv), by statement (ii) of Lemma 5, g(xs, xt) = xs implies g(xs, xv) = xs. Furthermore, according to (x1, . . . , xs), by statement (iii) of Lemma 5, g(xs, xv) = xs implies xp = g(x1, xv) \u2208 {x1, . . . , xs}. Therefore, we have 1 \u2264 p \u2264 s which implies that (x1, . . . , xp) is a path in G A \u223c connecting a1 and a, as required. Symmetrically, if q < v, then (xv, . . . , xq) is the unique path in G A \u223c (also in G Ab\u21c0a \u223c ) connecting am and b, and NA\u223c (xq) \u2229Ab\u21c0a = {xq+1}. Last, we show xp, . . . , xq \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Suppose not, i.e., we have xk /\u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 for some k \u2208 {p, . . . , q}. Thus, either xk \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} or xk \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} holds. We assume w.l.o.g. that xk \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. Thus, we have 1 \u2264 k < p, which implies NA\u223c (xp) \u2229 Aa\u21c0b = {xp\u22121}. Note that by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, according to the tree GAa\u21c0b\u223c = T A a\u21c0b , since xk \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, \u3008xk, a|GA a\u21c0b\n\u223c \u3009 is the unique path in GA\u223c connecting xk and a. Furthermore, since NA\u223c (xp)\u2229Aa\u21c0b = {xp\u22121}, xp\u22121 must be included in \u3008xk, a|GA a\u21c0b\n\u223c \u3009. However, according to the adjacency graph GB\u223c in Figure 8, we have a path in GA\u223c that connects xk and a, and excludes xp\u22121 - a contradiction. This proves the lemma.\nLemma 20 We have \u3008xk, xk|T A f \u3009 \u2287 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009.\nProof: Claim 1: We have [ k \u2264 p ] \u21d2 [ A \u2286 Aa\u21c0b ] and [ k \u2265 q ] \u21d2 [ A \u2286 Ab\u21c0a ] .\nGiven k \u2264 p, we show A \u2286 Aa\u21c0b. There are two cases: p = 1 and p > 1. First, let p = 1. Then, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 p implies k = 1. Thus, a = xk = a1. We first show Aa\u21c0b = {a}. Suppose not, i.e., we have some alternative c \u2208 Aa\\b\\{a}. Then, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, r1(P i) = am /\u2208 Aa\u21c0b implies a1 P i c, which contradicts the fact that a1 is bottom-ranked in P i. Hence, Aa\u21c0b = {a}. Similarly, by (xk, xk)-semi-hybridness on T A f , since r1(P i) = am /\u2208 A and a1 is bottom-ranked in P i, it is true that A = {x1}. Therefore, we have A = Aa\u21c0b. Next, let p > 1. Suppose by contradiction that we have an alternative z \u2208 A\\Aa\u21c0b. Since k \u2264 p, Lemma 19 implies xk \u2208 Aa\u21c0b. Thus, z /\u2208 Aa\u21c0b implies z 6= xk and hence z \u2208 A\\{xk}. Note that \u03c0 = \u3008z, xk|GA\u223c\u3009 is the unique path in GA\u223c connecting z and xk. Moreover, by (xk, xk)-semihybridness on T Af , r1(P i) = am /\u2208 A implies xk P i z. Therefore, xk is distinct to the bottom-ranked alternative in P i which is a1 = x1, and hence k > 1. Then, Observation 2 implies that xk\u22121 is the unique neighbor of xk in G A \u223c, and therefore we have xk\u22121 \u2208 \u03c0. Meanwhile, since z /\u2208 Aa\u21c0b, we have\na path (z1, . . . , zs) in G A \u223c connecting z and a = xp such that zk /\u2208 Aa\u21c0b for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , s\u2212 1}. Since xk, . . . , xp \u2208 Aa\u21c0b by Lemma 19, we have a concatenated path \u03c0\u2032 = (z1, . . . , zs = xp, . . . , xk) in GA\u223c connecting z and xk. Clearly, \u03c0 \u2032 does not include xk\u22121, and hence is distinct to \u03c0 - a contradiction. Therefore, we have A \u2286 Aa\u21c0b. Overall, we have [ k \u2264 p ] \u21d2 [ A \u2286 Aa\u21c0b ] . By a symmetric argument, we can show [ k \u2265 q ] \u21d2[\nA \u2286 Ab\u21c0a ] . This completes the verification of the claim.\nNote that if k \u2264 p and k \u2265 q hold, Claim 1 implies \u3008xk, xk|T A f \u3009 \u2287 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Henceforth, to complete the proof, we show k \u2264 p and k \u2265 q. By symmetry, we focus on showing k \u2264 p. Suppose not, i.e., k > p. We have two cases: p < k < q and k \u2265 q. In each case, we induce a contradiction.\nLet p < k < q. Symmetric to Claim 1, p < k implies Aa\u21c0b \u2286 A.\nClaim 2: We have A \u2229Ab\u21c0a = \u2205.\nSuppose not, i.e., we have some z \u2208 A\u2229Ab\u21c0a. Since k < q, we know b = xq /\u2208 A by Observation 2. Therefore, z 6= b and hence z \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}. On the one hand, according to (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A and z \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, we know that every path in GA\u223c connecting z and a must include b. On the other hand, according to (xk, xk)-semi-hybridness on T A f , since z \u2208 A and a \u2208 A, we know that \u3008z, a|GA\u223c\u3009 is the unique path in GA\u223c that connects z and a. However, since b /\u2208 A, the path \u3008z, a|GA\u223c\u3009 does not include b - a contradiction. This completes the verification of the claim.\nNow, let M\u0302 = [ A\\[A\u222aAb\u21c0a] ] \u222a{xk, b}. We construct a line (z1, . . . , zt) over all alternatives of M\u0302 such that t = |M\u0302 |, z1 = xk, zt = b, and all alternatives of M\u0302\\{xk, b} are arbitrarily arranged in the interior of the line. By combining the subtree T Af , the line (z1, . . . , zt) and the subtree T Ab\u21c0a , we generate a tree T\u0302 A. Clearly, xk and b are dual-thresholds in T\u0302 A. Thus, we have A\u0302xk\u21c0b = { x \u2208 A : xk \u2208 \u3008x, b|T\u0302 A\u3009 } = A and A\u0302b\u21c0xk = { x \u2208 A : b \u2208 \u3008x, xk|T\u0302 A\u3009 } = Ab\u21c0a.\nClaim 3: We have D \u2286 DSH ( T\u0302 A, xk, b ) .\nFirst, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302xk\u21c0b\\{xk}, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on T\u0302 A w.r.t. xk, and maxPi(A\u0302b\u21c0xk) = b. More specifically, by the construction of T\u0302 A, the semisingle-peakedness requirement on T\u0302 A w.r.t. xk consists of the following two parts: (i) semi-singlepeakedness on T\u0302 A\u0302 xk\u21c0b\n= T Af w.r.t. xk, and (ii) xk Pi x for all x \u2208 A\\A\u0302 xk\u21c0b = A\\A. Indeed,\nsince r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302xk\u21c0b\\{xk} = A\\{xk}, both parts follow from (xk, xk)-semi-hybridness on T A f . Next, since Pi is (a, b)-semi-hybrid on T A, r1(Pi) \u2208 A = A\u0302xk\u21c0b \u2286 A\\A\u0302b\u21c0xk = A\\Ab\u21c0a implies maxPi(A\u0302b\u21c0xk) = maxPi(Ab\u21c0a) = b, as required.\nSecond, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302b\u21c0xk\\{b}, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on T\u0302 A w.r.t. b, and maxPi(A\u0302xk\u21c0b) = xk. More specifically, by the construction of T\u0302 A, the semisingle-peakedness requirement on T\u0302 A w.r.t. b consists of the following two parts: (i) semi-singlepeakedness on T\u0302 A\u0302 b\u21c0xk = T Ab\u21c0a w.r.t. b, and (ii) b Pi x for all x \u2208 A\\A\u0302b\u21c0xk = A\\Ab\u21c0a. Indeed, since r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302b\u21c0xk\\{b} = Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, both parts follow from (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A. Next, since r1(Pi) \u2208 A\u0302b\u21c0xk = Ab\u21c0a, Claim 2 implies r1(Pi) \u2208 A\\A. Then, by (xk, xk)-semi-hybridness on T Af , we have maxPi(A\u0302xk\u21c0b) = maxPi(A) = xk, as required.\nLast, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008xk, b|T\u0302 A\u3009, we show maxPi(A\u0302xk\u21c0b) = xk and maxPi(A\u0302b\u21c0xk) = b. By the construction of T\u0302 A and r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008xk, b|T\u0302 A\u3009, we know r1(Pi) \u2208 [A\\A] \u222a {xk} and r1(Pi) \u2208 [A\\Ab\u21c0a] \u222a {b}, which respectively imply maxPi(A\u0302xk\u21c0b) = maxPi(A) = xk by (xk, xk)semi-hybridness on T Af , and maxPi(A\u0302b\u21c0xk) = maxPi(Ab\u21c0a) = b by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, as required. This completes the verification of the claim.\nThus, we have D \u2286 DSH ( T\u0302 A, xk, b ) and \u3008xk, b|T\u0302 A\u3009 = M\u0302 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, which contradict condition\n(ii) of Definition 6.\nLast, let k \u2265 q. Thus, k > 1 and hence Observation 2 implies that (x1, . . . , xk) is the unique path in GA\u223c (also in G A \u223c) connecting a1 and xk, and NA\u223c (xk) \u2229A = {xk\u22121}.\nClaim 4: We have NA\u223c (b) \u2229 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 = {xq\u22121}.\nSince (x1, . . . , xk) is a path in G A \u223c, we have xq\u22121 \u223c xq and hence xq\u22121 \u2208 NA\u223c (xq) = NA\u223c (b). By Lemma 19, we know xq\u22121 \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Thus, xq\u22121 \u2208 NA\u223c (b) \u2229 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Suppose that there exists z \u2208 NA\u223c (b) \u2229 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 such that z 6= xq\u22121. On the one hand, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, r1(P i) = am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a and z \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 imply b P i z. On the other hand, we show b P i z, which contradicts the fact that P i and P i are complete reversals. There are two cases: q = k and q < k. We first assume q = k. Since NA\u223c (xk) \u2229 A = {xk\u22121}, z \u2208 NA\u223c (b) = NA\u223c (xq) = NA\u223c (xk) and z 6= xq\u22121 = xk\u22121, it is true that z /\u2208 A. Then, by (xk, xk)-semi-hybridness on T A f , r1(P i) = a1 \u2208 A implies xk P i z (equivalently, b P i z), as required. Last, let q < k. Thus, q < v, and hence Lemma 19 implies xq+1, . . . , xk \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}. Moreover, since z 6= xq and z \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, we have a concatenated path (z, xq, . . . , xk) in G A \u223c connecting z and xk, which of course includes xk\u22121. Therefore, by definition, we know z \u2208 A. Furthermore, since z \u223c xq and z /\u2208 {xq\u22121, xq+1}, according to the tree GA\u223c, it is true that Proj ( z, (x1, . . . , xk) ) = xq. Then, by (xk, xk)-semihybridness on T Af , r1(P i) = a1 = x1 \u2208 A implies xq P i z (equivalently, b P i z), as required. This completes the verification of the claim.\nClaim 5: We have Aa\u21c0b \u222a \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 \u2286 A.\nWe have already known Aa\u21c0b \u2286 A and b = xq \u2208 A. To complete the verification, we show z \u2208 A for all z \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009\\{a, b}. Suppose that there exists z \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009\\{a, b} such that z /\u2208 A. On the one hand, since G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is a connected graph and b \u2208 Leaf ( G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ) by Claim 4, we have a path in GA\u223c that connects z and a, and excludes b. On the other hand, since z /\u2208 A and a \u2208 A\\{xk}, we know by Lemma 15 that xk must be included in every path in GA\u223c that connects z and a. Moreover, since Observation 2 implies that (xp, . . . , xk), which of course implies b = xq, is the unique path in GA\u223c connecting a and xk, it is true that b must be included in every path in GA\u223c that connects z and a - a contradiction. This completes the verification of the claim.\nClaim 5 immediately implies that GA a\u21c0b \u223c \u222aG \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is included in GA\u223c. More importantly, since\nGA\u223c is a tree, G Aa\u21c0b \u223c is a tree, and G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is a connected graph, it must be the case that G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is a tree as well. Consequently, GA\u223c = G Aa\u21c0b \u223c \u222aG \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u222aGA b\u21c0a \u223c is a tree.\nClaim 6: We have D \u2286 DSSP(GA\u223c, b).\nNote that the tree GA a\u21c0b \u223c \u222a G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is nested in GA\u223c, xq = b \u2208 Leaf ( G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ) by Claim 4\nand xk \u2208 Leaf ( GA\u223c )\nby Observation 2. Then, it must be the case that b \u2208 \u3008x, xk|GA\u223c\u3009 for all x \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\u222a\u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Furthermore, since GA\u223c is nested in the tree GA\u223c, we know \u3008x, xk|GA\u223c\u3009 = \u3008x, xk|GA\u223c\u3009 for x \u2208 Aa\u21c0b \u222a \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Therefore, b \u2208 \u3008x, xk|GA\u223c\u3009 for all x \u2208 Aa\u21c0b \u222a \u3008a, b|T A\u3009.\nFirst, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\u222a\u3008a, b|T A\u3009, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on GA\u223c w.r.t. b, which consists of the following two parts: (i) semi-single-peakedness on GA a\u21c0b \u223c \u222aG \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c w.r.t. b, and (ii) maxPi(Ab\u21c0a) = b. Note that by (xk, xk)-semi-hybridness on T A f , Pi is semisingle-peaked on T Af w.r.t. xk, which implies that Pi is semi-single-peaked on T A f = G A \u223c w.r.t. xk. Consequently, GA a\u21c0b \u223c \u222a G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u2286 GA\u223c and the fact b \u2208 \u3008x, xk|GA\u223c\u3009 for all x \u2208 Aa\u21c0b \u222a \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 together imply Pi is semi-single-peaked on G Aa\u21c0b \u223c \u222aG \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c w.r.t. b. This confirms part (i). Next, since r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b \u222a \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, part (ii) immediately follows from (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A. Second, given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a, we show that Pi is semi-single-peaked on GA\u223c w.r.t. b, which consists of the following two parts: (i) semi-single-peakedness on GA b\u21c0a\n\u223c = T A b\u21c0a w.r.t. b,\nand (ii) maxPi(Aa\u21c0b \u222a \u3008a, b|T A\u3009) = b. Since r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a, both parts immediately follow from (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A. This completes the verification of the claim.\nNow, we know that all preferences of D are semi-single-peaked on the tree GA\u223c w.r.t. the threshold b which by Claim 4 is a leaf of G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c . This contradicts condition (iii) of Definition 6.\nIn conclusion, we must have k \u2264 p, as required. By a symmetric argument, we can also show k \u2265 q. This proves the lemma, and hence completes the verification of the \u201conly if part\u201d of Statement (ii) of Theorem 1."

Let D be an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on a tree T A, and satisfy diversity. The following two statements are equivalent:\n(a) every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule f : D2 \u2192 A behaves likes a dictatorship on \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, and\n(b) every tops-only and strategy-proof rule f : Dn \u2192 A, n \u2265 2, behaves likes a dictatorship on \u3008a, b|T A\u3009.\nThe proof of the Ramification Theorem is lengthy and is relegated to the Supplementary\nMaterial of Chatterji and Zeng (2022).\nNow, we start to prove the Corollary. Let D be a non-dictatorial, unidimensional domain. To prove statement (i), we show the equivalence of the following three sub-statements:\n(1) there exists an anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule,\n(2) domain D is a semi-single-peaked domain, and\n(3) domain D admits a strategy-proof projection rule.\nIt is clear that the direction (2) \u21d2 (3) \u21d2 (1) follows from the proof of the sufficiency part of the Theorem of Chatterji et al. (2013). We focus on showing (1) \u21d2 (2). Now, assume that there exists an anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof rule. We show that D is a semi-single-peaked domain. Suppose by contradiction that D is not a semi-single-peaked domain. Since Theorem 1 exclusively and exhaustively classifies all non-dictatorial, unidimensional domains into the class\nof semi-single-peaked domains and the class of semi-hybrid domains, D must be a semi-hybrid domain, more specifically, say an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on a tree T A. Then, by the proof of Statement (ii) of Theorem 1, we know that every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule behaves like a dictatorship on \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Furthermore, by the Ramification Theorem, we know that every tops-only and strategy-proof rule with an arbitrary number of voters behaves like a dictatorship on \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. This contradicts the hypothesis that there exists an anonymous, topsonly and strategy-proof rule. This completes the verification of the direct (1) \u21d2 (2), and hence proves statement (i).\nNext, we show statement (ii). Note that the \u201cif part\u201d of statement (ii) follows exactly from\nLemmas 11 and 12 in Appendix B and statement (i). We focus on showing the \u201conly if part\u201d, and\nfurthermore showing that every tops-only and strategy-proof rule behaves like a dictatorship on\na weak superset of the free zone. Since there exists no anonymous, tops-only and strategy-proof\nrule, statement (i) immediately implies that D is not a semi-single-peaked domain. Then, by the proof of Statement (ii) of Theorem 1, we know that D is an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on a tree T A\nsatisfying the unique seconds property, and furthermore every two-voter, tops-only and strategyproof rule behaves like a dictatorship on a weak superset of \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Last, by the Ramification Theorem, we know that every tops-only and strategy-proof rule with an arbitrary number of voters also behaves likes a dictatorship on \u3008a, b|T A\u3009.

We fix P1 \u2208 D with r1(P1) = z \u2208 Ax\u21c0y and show condition (i) of Fact 1 in two steps. In the first step, we show that for all distinct a, b \u2208 \u3008z, y|T A\u3009, [ a \u2208 \u3008z, b|T A\u3009 ] \u21d2 [a Pi b]. Since \u3008z, y|T A\u3009 is a combination of \u3008z, x|T A\u3009 and the edge (x, y), by transitivity of P1, it suffices to show (i) given distinct a, b \u2208 \u3008z, x|T A\u3009, [a \u2208 \u3008z, b|T A\u3009] \u21d2 [a P1 b] and (ii) x P1 y. We fix two profiles P = (P1, P\u22121) and P \u2032 = (P \u20321, P\u22121), where P \u2032 1 \u2208 Db and P\u03bd \u2208 Da for all \u03bd \u2208 {2, . . . , n}.

By construction,\nthere must exist P = (P1, P2, P\u2212{1,2}) and P \u2032 = (P1, P \u2032 2, P\u2212{1,2}), where r1(P1) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y and r1(P2) = r1(P \u2032 2) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x such that f(P ) = maxP2({x, y}) = x 6= y = maxP \u2032 2({x, y}) = f(P \u2032). Therefore, we have x P2 y and y P \u2032 2 x, as required.\nConversely, we show that if domain D satisfy conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of Fact 1, then the PNT rule f satisfies strategy-proofness and violates the tops-only property.\nClearly, condition (iii) of Fact 1 implies that f violates the tops-only property. In the rest of proof, we show strategy-proofness of f . We first consider an arbitrary voter i \u2208 N\\{1, 2} in the case n > 2. Given profiles P = (P1, P2, Pi, P\u2212{1,2,i}) and P \u2032 = (P1, P2, P \u2032 i , P\u2212{1,2,i}), let f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032). Then, the construction implies r1(P1) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y, r1(P2) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y, f(P ) = Proj(x, T \u0393(P )) and f(P \u2032) =\nProj(x, T \u0393(P \u2032)). Furthermore, we can infer r1(Pj) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y for all j \u2208 N\\{1, 2, i}. Otherwise, both \u0393(P ) and \u0393(P \u2032) contain x, and f(P ) = x = f(P \u2032). Similarly, we can infer either r1(Pi) /\u2208 Ay\u21c0x or r1(P \u2032 i ) /\u2208 Ay\u21c0x. Thus, there are three cases: (1) r1(Pi) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y, (2) r1(Pi) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x, and (3) r1(Pi) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y. In both cases (1) and (2), since r1(Pi) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y, condition (i) of Fact 1 implies that Pi is also semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. x. Consequently, given f(P ) = Proj(x, T \u0393(P )) 6= Proj(x, T \u0393(P \u2032)) = f(P \u2032), the proof of the sufficiency part of the Theorem of Chatterji et al. (2013) implies f(P ) Pi f(P \u2032). In case (3), f(P ) = Proj(x, T \u0393(P )) = x and f(P \u2032) = Proj(x, T \u0393(P \u2032)) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y. Then, condition (ii) of Fact 1 implies f(P ) Pi f(P \u2032). Overall, voter i has no incentive to manipulate. Henceforth, we focus on\nthe possible manipulations of voters 1 and 2.\nFirst, given two profiles P = (P1, P2, P\u2212{1,2}) and P \u2032 = (P \u20321, P2, P\u2212{1,2}) with f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032),\nthere are three possible manipulations of voter 1: (1) f(P ) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P ) ) and f(P \u2032) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P \u2032) ) ,\n(2) f(P ) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P ) ) and f(P \u2032) = r1(P \u2032 1) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x, and (3) f(P ) = maxP2({x, y}) and f(P \u2032) = r1(P \u20321) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x. In each case, we show f(P ) P1 f(P\n\u2032). In case (1), we know r1(P1) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y. Then, condition (i) of Fact 1 implies that P1 is also semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. x. Consequently, given f(P ) = Proj(x, T \u0393(P )) 6= Proj(x, T \u0393(P \u2032)) = f(P \u2032), the proof of the sufficiency part of the Theorem of Chatterji et al. (2013) implies f(P ) P1 f(P\n\u2032), as required. In case (2), we know r1(P1) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y, which implies minP1 ( \u3008r1(P1), x|T A\u3009 ) = x, x P1 y and y = max P1(Ay\u21c0x) by condition (i) of Fact 1.\nThen, f(P ) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P ) ) \u2208 \u3008r1(P1), x|T A\u3009 and f(P \u2032) = r1(P \u20321) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x imply f(P ) P1 f(P \u2032), as required. In case (3), we know r1(P1) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y which implies x P1 y and y = maxP1(Ay\u21c0x) by condition (i) of Fact 1. Then, f(P ) = maxP2({x, y}) \u2208 {x, y}, f(P \u2032) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x and f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032) imply f(P ) P1 f(P \u2032), as required.\nLast, given two profiles P = (P1, P2, P\u2212{1,2}) and P \u2032 = (P1, P \u2032 2, P\u2212{1,2}) with f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032),\nthere are three possible manipulations of voter 2: (1) f(P ) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P ) ) and f(P \u2032) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P \u2032) ) ,\n(2) f(P ) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P ) ) and f(P \u2032) = maxP \u2032 2({x, y}), and\n(3) f(P ) = maxP2({x, y}) and f(P \u2032) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P \u2032) ) . In each case, we show f(P ) P2 f(P \u2032) holds. Clearly, the verification of case (1) is similar to that of\ncase (1) for voter 1. In case (2), we know r1(P2) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y, which implies minP2 ( \u3008r1(P2), x|T A\u3009 ) = x\nand x P2 y by condition (i) of Fact 1. Consequently, f(P ) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P ) ) \u2208 \u3008r1(P2), x|T A\u3009, f(P \u2032) = maxP \u2032 2({x, y}) \u2208 {x, y} and f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032) imply f(P ) P2 f(P \u2032), as required. In case (3), we know r1(P2) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x which implies maxP2(Ax\u21c0y) = x by condition (ii) of Fact 1, and r1(P \u2032 2) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y which implies f(P \u2032) = Proj ( x, T \u0393(P \u2032) ) \u2208 \u3008r1(P \u20322), x|T A\u3009 \u2286 Ax\u21c0y. Then, f(P ) = maxP2({x, y}), f(P \u2032) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y and f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032) imply f(P ) P2 f(P \u2032), as required. In conclusion, the PNT rule f is strategy-proof."

Henceforth, let D * DSP(T A), and we show the existence of a critical spot.\nSince D is a semi-single-peaked domain on T A, we identify the set Z \u2286 A such that [z \u2208 Z] \u21d2 [D \u2286 DSSP(T A, z)]. Clearly, either Z is a singleton set, or Z is not a singleton set and T Z is a subtree nested in T A.42 Since D * DSP(T A), it must be the case that some leaf of\n42Given a tree T A and two distinct alternatives a, b \u2208 A, if D \u2286 DSSP(T A, a) and D \u2286 DSSP(T A, b), then\nT A and its unique neighbor are not contained in Z. Then, we can identify a threshold x\u2032 \u2208 Z with [Z is not a singleton set] \u21d2 [x\u2032 \u2208 Leaf(T Z)] and an edge (x, y) \u2208 EA with x, y /\u2208 Z and y \u2208 \u3008x, x\u2032|T A\u3009, such that the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(1) every preference Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x is single-peaked on T A x\u21c0y , i.e., for all distinct a, b \u2208 Ax\u21c0y, [ a \u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), b|T A\u3009 ] \u21d2 [a Pi b], and\n(2) some preference P \u2217i \u2208 D with r1(P \u2217i ) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x is not single-peaked on the subtree T A x\u21c0y\u222a{y}.43\nSince condition (1) implies maxPi(Ax\u21c0y) = x for all Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x, condition (ii) of Fact 1 is satisfied. We next show condition (i) of Fact 1: given Pi \u2208 D with r1(Pi) \u2208 Ax\u21c0y, Pi is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. y. Since y \u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), x\u2032|T A\u3009, semi-single-peakedness on T A w.r.t. x\u2032 implies that Pi is also semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. y, as required. Last, we show condition (iii) of Fact 1: there exist Pi, P \u2032 i \u2208 D such that r1(Pi) = r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x, y Pi x and x P \u2032i y. First, since GA\u223c = T A, it is true that GA y\u21c0x \u223c = T A y\u21c0x is a subtree. Second, recall preference P \u2217i in condition (2) above. Since P \u2217i is single-peaked on T A x\u21c0y by condition (1) and violates single-peakedness on T Ax\u21c0y\u222a{y} by condition (2), it must be the case that maxP \u2217i (Ax\u21c0y) = x and x P \u2217i y. Given subdomains D1 = {Pi \u2208 D : r1(Pi) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x and y Pi x} and D2 = {Pi \u2208 D : r1(Pi) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x and x Pi y}, we know D1 6= \u2205 by minimal richness and P \u2217i \u2208 D2. Now, suppose that condition (iii) of Fact 1 is not true. Thus, all Pi, P \u2032 i \u2208 D with r1(Pi) = r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Ay\u21c0x agree on the relative ranking of x and y. Therefore, for all z \u2208 Ay\u21c0x, either Dz \u2286 D1 or Dz \u2286 D2 holds. Consequently, given arbitrary distinct z, z\u2032 \u2208 Ay\u21c0x with Dz \u2286 D1 and Dz\n\u2032 \u2286 D2, we have z Pi z\u2032 and y Pi x for all Pi \u2208 Dz, and z\u2032 P \u2032i z and x P \u2032i y for all P \u2032i \u2208 Dz \u2032 , which imply that z and z\u2032 are never adjacent. This contradicts the fact that GA y\u21c0x\n\u223c is a subtree. Therefore, we identify a critical spot (x, y). This\nproves statement (i).\nNext, we show statement (ii) of Proposition 1. Let D be an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on a tree T A. Clearly, the existence of a critical spot (x, y) in T A such that either x, y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} or x, y \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} implies D * DH(T A, a, b). Henceforth, let D * DH(T A, a, b), and we show that there exists a critical spot (x, y) in T A such that either x, y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} or x, y \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}. Since D * DH(T A, a, b), there must exists P\u0302i \u2208 D that is either not single-peaked on T A a\u21c0b or not single-peaked on T Ab\u21c0a . We assume w.l.o.g. that P\u0302i is not single-peaked on T A a\u21c0b . This implies |Aa\u21c0b| \u2265 3. Given arbitrary Pi \u2208 D, let Pi|Aa\u21c0b be the induced preference over Aa\u21c0b by removing all alternatives not in Aa\u21c0b. Accordingly, let D|Aa\u21c0b = {Pi|Aa\u21c0b : Pi \u2208 D}. We claim that D|Aa\u21c0b is semi-single-peaked on T A a\u21c0b w.r.t. a. Given arbitrary Pi \u2208 D, either r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b or r1(Pi) \u2208 A\\Aa\u21c0b holds. If r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b, we know that Pi is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. a by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A. Then, it is evident that Pi|Aa\u21c0b is semi-single-peaked on T A a\u21c0b w.r.t. a, as required. If r1(Pi) \u2208 A\\Aa\u21c0b, (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A implies maxPi(Aa\u21c0b) = a. Then, we have r1(Pi|Aa\u21c0b) = a which implies that Pi|Aa\u21c0b is semi-single-peaked on T A a\u21c0b w.r.t. a,\nwe have D \u2286 DSSP(T A, x) for all x \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. 43The subtree T Ax\u21c0y\u222a{y} is a combination of the subtree T Ax\u21c0y and the edge (x, y). We adopt the instance of the line LA to exemplify how conditions (1) and (2) are specified. Fixing a semi-single-peaked domain D on the line LA, let D * DSP(LA). Then, we have Z = \u3008ap, aq|LA\u3009 for some 2 < p \u2264 q \u2264 m or 1 \u2264 p \u2264 q < m\u22121. We assume w.l.o.g. that p > 2. First, according to a1, it is natural that every preference with the peak located in \u3008a2, am|LA\u3009 is single-peaked on \u3008a1, a1|LA\u3009. Second, since D \u2286 DSSP(LA, ap) and D * DSSP(LA, ap\u22121), some preference with the peak located in \u3008ap\u22121, am|LA\u3009 must not be single-peaked on \u3008a1, ap\u22121|LA\u3009. Searching from a1 to ap\u22121, we can identify 1 \u2264 s < p \u2212 1 such that (i) every preference with the peak located in \u3008as+1, am|LA\u3009 is single-peaked on \u3008a1, as|LA\u3009, and (ii) some preference with the peak located in \u3008as+1, am|LA\u3009 is not single-peaked on \u3008a1, as+1|LA\u3009. These two conditions are analogous to conditions (1) and (2) above respectively.\nas required. Moreover, since P\u0302i is not single-peaked on T A a\u21c0b\n, it is clear that P\u0302i|Aa\u21c0b is not single-peaked on T Aa\u21c0b . Consequently, D|Aa\u21c0b is not single-peaked on T A a\u21c0b . Then, according to D|Aa\u21c0b , we can adopt the verification of statement (i) to identify a critical spot (x, y) in T A a\u21c0b such that x, y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. Last, back to D, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, it is easy to show that (x, y) is also a critical spot in T A. This completes the verification of statement (ii)."

Clearly, the admissible rule also satisfies the tops-only property. Then, by statement (i) of Corollary 1, D must be a semi-single-peaked domain on a tree T A w.r.t. some threshold x\u0304 \u2208 A. Furthermore, since D is a tops-only domain, Fact 1 and statement (i) of Proposition 1 together imply that D must be a single-peaked domain on T A. Last, since D includes the completely reversed preferences P i and P i, according to the labeling of alternatives in them, it must be the case that T A = LA. Therefore, D is a single-peaked domain on LA. This proves statement (i) of Corollary 2.\nWe next show statement (ii). Fix a non-dictatorial, tops-only, unidimensional domain D.

Thus, D admits no anonymous, topsonly and strategy-proof rule. Then, by statement (ii) of Corollary 1, we know that D is an (a, b)semi-hybrid domain on a tree T A. By Lemma 11, we can assume w.l.o.g. that a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a. We show that D is a non-degenerate hybrid domain on LA in the next lemma.\nLemma 21 Domain D is an (ap, aq)-hybrid domain on LA for some 1 < q \u2212 p < m\u2212 1.\nProof: Since D \u2286 DSH(T A, a, b) is a tops-only domain, Fact 1 and statement (ii) of Proposition 1 together imply D \u2286 DH(T A, a, b). Furthermore, the presence of the completely reversed preferences P i and P i implies that T A must be a line. We next show that the two leaves of T A are a1 and am. Suppose by contradiction that a1 is not a leaf of the line T A. Thus, a1 has two neighbors in T A. Consequently, we must have some c \u2208 NA(a1) such that c 6= am and a1 \u2208 \u3008c, am|T A\u3009. Since a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a, a1 \u2208 \u3008c, am|T A\u3009 implies c \u2208 Aa\u21c0b. Then, by (a, b)-hybridness on T A, r1(P i) = am \u2208 Ab\u21c0a implies c P i a1, which contradicts the fact that a1 is bottom-ranked in P i. Therefore, a1 is not a leaf of the line T A. Symmetrically, am is the other leaf of the line T A. Now, let \u3008a1, a|T A\u3009 = (x1, . . . , xp) and \u3008b, am|T A\u3009 = (xq, . . . , xm), where p = |\u3008a1, a|T A\u3009|, q \u2212 p+ 1 = |\u3008a, b|T A\u3009|, and m\u2212 q + 1 = |\u3008b, am|T A\u3009|. Since D is an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on T A, we have |\u3008ap, aq|LA\u3009| = |\u3008a, b|T A\u3009| \u2265 3 and hence q \u2212 p > 1. This confirms condition (iii) of Definition 3. Furthermore, according to the labeling of alternatives in P i and P i, we infer that xk = ak for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , p} \u222a {q, . . . ,m}. Thus, T A is a combination of the line (a1, . . . , ap), the interval \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 and the line (aq, . . . , am), and hence DH(T A, a, b) = DH(LA, ap, aq). Therefore, we have D \u2286 DH(T A, a, b) = DH(LA, ap, aq), which, in conjunction with the fact that GA\u223c is a connected graph, confirms condition (i) of Definition 3. Next, since D is an (a, b)-semi-hybrid domain on T A, by condition (ii) of Definition 6, there exist no tree T\u0302 A and dual-thresholds a\u0302 and b\u0302\nsuch that D \u2286 DSH(T\u0302 A, a\u0302, b\u0302) and \u3008a\u0302, b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u2282 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 = \u3008ap, aq|LA\u3009. This implies that there exist no tree T\u0302 A and dual-thresholds a\u0302 and b\u0302 such that D \u2286 DH(T\u0302 A, a\u0302, b\u0302) and \u3008a\u0302, b\u0302|T\u0302 A\u3009 \u2282 \u3008ap, aq|LA\u3009. This confirms condition (ii) of Definition 3. In conclusion, D is an (ap, aq)-hybrid domain on LA.\nWe last show that D is a non-degenerate hybrid domain, i.e., q \u2212 p < m \u2212 1. Suppose by contradiction q \u2212 p = m\u2212 1. Thus, D is an (a1, am)-hybrid domain on LA, which is a degenerate hybrid domain. Consequently, by the proof of Statement (ii) of Theorem 1, we know that every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule behaves like a dictatorship on \u3008a1, am|LA\u3009 = A. Hence, every two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule is a dictatorship. Consequently, by the tops-only-\ndomain hypothesis, every strategy-proof rule is a dictatorship, which further by the ramification\ntheorem of Aswal et al. (2003) implies that D is a dictatorial domain - a contradiction. This proves the lemma and completes the verification of the \u201conly if part\u201d of statement (ii)."

Conversely, if |NA(x\u0304)| \u2264 2, then DSSP(T A, x\u0304) satisfies diversity.\nIt is clear that any two alternatives form an edge in T A are adjacent in the semi-single-peaked domain DSSP(T A, x\u0304), and hence form an edge in the corresponding adjacency graph. Therefore, T A is a subgraph of the adjacency graph of the semi-single-peaked domain DSSP(T A, x\u0304). To prove statement (i), it suffices to show that any two alternatives that never form an edge in T A, are not adjacent. Suppose not, i.e., there exist a, b \u2208 A such that (a, b) /\u2208 EA and a \u223c b. Thus, v \u2265 3 and we have P\u0302i, P\u0303i \u2208 DSSP(T A, x\u0304) such that r1(P\u0302i) = r2(P\u0303i) = a and r1(P\u0303i) = r2(P\u0302i) = b. Let \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 = (x1, . . . , xv) denote path in T A that connects a and b. Moreover, let Proj(x\u0304, \u3008a, b|T A\u3009) = xk\u0304 for some k\u0304 \u2208 {1, . . . , v}. Note that either 1 < k\u0304 < v or k\u0304 \u2208 {1, v} holds. If 1 < k\u0304 < v, then Proj(b, \u3008a, x\u0304|T A\u3009) = Proj(x\u0304, \u3008a, b|T A\u3009) = xk\u0304 implies xk\u0304 Pi b for all Pi \u2208 DSSP(T A, x\u0304) with r1(Pi) = a. This contradicts the presence of the aforementioned preference P\u0302i. If k\u0304 = 1, then a, x2 \u2208 \u3008b, x\u0304|T A\u3009 and x2 \u2208 \u3008b, a|T A\u3009, which imply x2 Pi a for all Pi \u2208 DSSP(T A, x\u0304) with r1(Pi) = b. This contradicts the presence of the aforementioned preference P\u0303i. Symmetrically, if k\u0304 = v, we can\ninduce a contradiction to the presence of the preference P\u0302i. This proves statement (i).\nFor statement (ii), we first show that given a domain D \u2286 DSSP(T A, x\u0304), if it satisfies diversity, then |NA(x\u0304)| \u2264 2. Let \u03c0 = (x1, . . . , xv) denote the path in T A connecting a1 and am. We first claim x\u0304 \u2208 \u03c0. Suppose not, i.e., x\u0304 /\u2208 \u03c0. Then, we have Proj(x\u0304, \u03c0) = xk for some 1 \u2264 k \u2264 v. Furthermore, if k = 1, semi-single-peakedness on T A w.r.t. x\u0304 implies a1 P i x\u0304, which contradicts the fact that a1 is bottom-ranked in P i; if k = v, we have am P i x\u0304 by semi-single-peakedness on T A w.r.t. x\u0304, which contradicts the fact that am is bottom-ranked in P i; if 1 < k < v, we have xk P i x\u0304 and xk P i x\u0304 by by semi-single-peakedness on T A w.r.t. x\u0304, which contradicts the fact that P i and P i are complete reversals. Therefore, x\u0304 \u2208 \u03c0. Now, we show |NA(x\u0304)| \u2264 2. Suppose not, i.e., |NA(x\u0304)| \u2265 3. Consequently, we have x \u2208 NA(x\u0304) such that x /\u2208 \u03c0. Clearly, x /\u2208 \u3008a1, x\u0304|T A\u3009, Proj(x, \u3008a1, x\u0304|T A\u3009) = x\u0304, x /\u2208 \u3008am, x\u0304|T A\u3009 and Proj(x, \u3008am, x\u0304|T A\u3009) = x\u0304. Consequently, we have x\u0304 P i x and x\u0304 P i x by by semi-single-peakedness on T A w.r.t. x\u0304, which contradicts the fact that P i and P i are complete reversals.\nNext, we show that if |NA(x\u0304)| \u2264 2, then the semi-single-peaked domain DSSP(T A, x\u0304) satisfies diversity. Since |NA(x\u0304)| \u2264 2, we have a path (x1, . . . , xv) in T A such that (i) x\u0304 = xk\u0304 for some 1 \u2264 k\u0304 \u2264 v, (ii) x1, xv \u2208 Leaf(T A) and (iii) [1 < k\u0304 < v] \u21d2 [NA(x\u0304) = {xk\u0304\u22121, xk\u0304+1}]. First, let k\u0304 = 1. Since x\u0304 = x1 \u2208 Leaf(T A), we by definition have a preference Pi \u2208 DSSP(T A, x1) such that r1(Pi) = xv and rm(Pi) = x1. Next, we construct a linear order P \u2032 i that is a complete reversal of Pi. Clearly, P \u2032 i \u2208 DSSP(T A, x1). Symmetrically, if k\u0304 = v, we also have two completely reversed preferences in DSSP(T A, x\u0304). Last, let 1 < k\u0304 < v. Thus, NA(x\u0304) = {xk\u0304\u22121, xk\u0304+1}. It is natural that xk\u0304\u22121 and xk\u0304 are dual-thresholds in T A, and xk\u0304 and xk\u0304+1 are dual-thresholds in T A. Then, we identify the two subsets Axk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 and Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 . Note that xk\u0304 /\u2208 Axk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 , xk\u0304 /\u2208 Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 , Axk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 \u2229 Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 = \u2205 and Axk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 \u222a {xk\u0304} \u222a Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 = A. Now, pick arbitrary Pi, P \u2032 i \u2208 DSSP(T A, xk\u0304) such that r1(Pi) = x1 and r1(P \u2032i ) = xv. Then, we construct two linear orders: P\u0302i and P\u0302 \u2032 i over A such that (i) for all x \u2208 Axk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 and y \u2208 Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 , x P\u0302i xk\u0304, xk\u0304 P\u0302i y, y P\u0302 \u2032 i xk\u0304 and xk\u0304 P\u0302 \u2032 i x, (ii) P\u0302i and Pi agree on the relative rankings over A xk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 , i.e., for all x, y \u2208 Axk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 , [x P\u0302i y] \u21d4 [x Pi y], and P\u0302i and P \u2032i completely disagree on the relative rankings over Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 , i.e., for all x, y \u2208 Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 , [x P\u0302i y]\u21d4 [y P \u2032i x], and (iii) P\u0302 \u2032i and P \u2032i agree on the relative rankings over Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 , i.e., for all x, y \u2208 Axk\u0304+1\u21c0xk\u0304 , [x P\u0302 \u2032i y] \u21d4 [x P \u2032i y], and P\u0302 \u2032i and Pi completely disagree on the relative rankings over A\nxk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 , i.e., for all x, y \u2208 Axk\u0304\u22121\u21c0xk\u0304 , [x P\u0302 \u2032i y] \u21d4 [y Pi x]. It is easy to show that P\u0302i and P\u0302 \u2032i are complete reversals, and both are semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. xk\u0304. This proves statement (ii).\nClarification 2 Fixing a tree T A, dual-thresholds a, b \u2208 A and the semi-hybrid domain DSH(T A, a, b), the following two statements hold:\n(i) the adjacency graph of DSH(T A, a, b) is a combination of the adjacency subgraph GA a\u21c0b \u223c ,\nwhich coincides with the subtree T Aa\u21c0b, the adjacency subgraph G\u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c , which is a complete subgraph, and the adjacency subgraph GA b\u21c0a\n\u223c , which coincides with T A b\u21c0a , and\n(ii) if a domain D \u2286 DSH(T A, a, b) satisfies diversity, then we have [Aa\u21c0b 6= {a}] \u21d2 [a \u2208 Leaf(T Aa\u21c0b)] and [Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}] \u21d2 [b \u2208 Leaf(T Ab\u21c0a)]. Conversely, if we have [Aa\u21c0b 6= {a}] \u21d2 [a \u2208 Leaf(T Aa\u21c0b)] and [Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}] \u21d2 [b \u2208 Leaf(T Ab\u21c0a)], the semi-hybrid domain DSH(T A, a, b) satisfies diversity.\nSimilar to the verification of statement (i) of Clarification 1, we know that the adjacency\nsubgraph GA a\u21c0b \u223c coincides with the subtree T A a\u21c0b , and the adjacency subgraph GA b\u21c0a \u223c coincides with the subtree T Ab\u21c0a . Furthermore, since any two distinct alternatives in the set \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 are adjacent in the the semi-hybrid domain DSH(T A, a, b), the adjacency subgraph G\u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c is a\ncomplete subgraph. To complete the verification, we show that the adjacency graph of the semihybrid domain DSH(T A, a, b) is simply a combination of the subtree GA a\u21c0b \u223c = T A a\u21c0b , the complete subgraph G \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c and the subtree GA b\u21c0a \u223c = T A b\u21c0a . Since all these three subgraphs are nested in the adjacency graph of DSH(T A, a, b), it suffices to show that for all x, y \u2208 A with x \u223c y, either (x, y) \u2208 EAa\u21c0b\u223c , or (x, y) \u2208 E \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c , or (x, y) \u2208 EA b\u21c0a\n\u223c holds. Given distinct x, y \u2208 A with x \u223c y, suppose by contradiction that (x, y) /\u2208 EAa\u21c0b\u223c \u222aE \u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c \u222aEA b\u21c0a\n\u223c . Since x \u223c y, we have a preference P \u2217i \u2208 DSH(T A, a, b) such that r1(P \u2217i ) = x and r2(P \u2217i ) = y. We know that one of the following five cases must occur: (1) x \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, (2) x \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, (3) x \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009\\{a, b}, (4) x = a, or (5) x = b. In case (1), by the contradictory hypothesis, it must be true that y /\u2208 Aa\u21c0b.44 Then, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, we have a Pi y for all Pi \u2208 DSH(T A, a, b) with r1(Pi) = x,\n44Otherwise, y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b. Thus, x, y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b. Then, x \u223c y implies (x, y) \u2208 EAa\u21c0b\u223c , which contrasts the contradictory hypothesis.\nwhich contradicts the presence of the aforementioned preference P \u2217i . Similarly, in case (2), we can show b Pi y for all Pi \u2208 DSH(T A, a, b) with r1(Pi) = x, which contradicts the presence of the aforementioned preference P \u2217i as well. In case (3), by the contradictory hypothesis, it must be true that y /\u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009,45 which further implies y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} or y \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}. Then, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, we know that if y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, then a Pi y for all Pi \u2208 DSH(T A, a, b) with r1(Pi) = x ] ; if y \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, then b Pi y for all Pi \u2208 DSH(T A, a, b) with r1(Pi) = x ] . This contradicts the presence of the aforementioned preference P \u2217i . In case (4), by the contradictory hypothesis, it must be true that y \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}.46 Then, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, we have b Pi y for all Pi \u2208 DSH(T A, a, b) with r1(Pi) = x. This contradicts the presence of the aforementioned preference P \u2217i . Similarly, in case (5), we can show a Pi y for all Pi \u2208 DSH(T A, a, b) with r1(Pi) = x, which contradicts the presence of the preference P \u2217 i as well. This proves statement (i).\nFor statement (ii), we first notice that if |\u3008a, b|T A\u3009| = 2, DSH(T A, a, b) = DSSP(T A, a) \u2229 DSH(T A, b), and then statement (ii) of Clarification 1 implies the result. Henceforth, we assume |\u3008a, b|T A\u3009| \u2265 3. We first show that given a domain D \u2286 DSH(T A, a, b), if D satisfies diversity, then we have [Aa\u21c0b 6= {a}] \u21d2 [a \u2208 Leaf(T Aa\u21c0b)] and [Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}] \u21d2 [b \u2208 Leaf(T Ab\u21c0a)]. The verifications for both cases Aa\u21c0b 6= {a} and Ab\u21c0a 6= {b} are symmetric. We hence assume w.l.o.g. that Aa\u21c0b 6= {a}. By diversity, we have P i, P i \u2208 D. Furthermore, since Aa\u21c0b 6= {a}, (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A implies either a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and am \u2208 A\\Aa\u21c0b, or a1 \u2208 A\\Aa\u21c0b and am \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. We can assume w.l.o.g. that a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and am \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 \u222a Ab\u21c0a. Suppose that a /\u2208 Leaf(T Aa\u21c0b). Thus, we have distinct x, y \u2208 NAa\u21c0b(a). Note that at least one of {x, y} is not located in \u3008a1, a|T A a\u21c0b\u3009. We assume w.l.o.g. x /\u2208 \u3008a1, a|T A a\u21c0b\u3009. Consequently, given a1 \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and am \u2208 A\\Aa\u21c0b, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, we have a P i x and a P i x, which contradict the fact that P i and P i are complete reversals.\nLast, we show that if we have [Aa\u21c0b 6= {a}] \u21d2 [a \u2208 Leaf(T Aa\u21c0b)] and [Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}] \u21d2 [b \u2208 Leaf(T Ab\u21c0a)], then the semi-hybrid domain DSH(T A, a, b) satisfies diversity. If Aa\u21c0b = {a} and Ab\u21c0a = {b}, then DSH(T A, a, b) = P includes two completely reversed preference. Next, let Aa\u21c0b = {a} and Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}. It is evident that b has a unique neighbor in the line \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, and the hypothesis implies that b has a unique neighbor in the subtree T Ab\u21c0a . Since T A is a union of the line \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 and the subtree T Ab\u21c0a , we have |NA(b)| = 2. Then, Clarification 2 implies that DSSP(T A, b) contains two completely reversed preferences. Moreover, since Aa\u21c0b = {a}, it is true that DSSP(T A, b) \u2282 DSH(T A, a, b), which implies that DSH(T A, a, b) satisfies diversity. Symmetrically, if Aa\u21c0b 6= {a} and Ab\u21c0a = {b}, DSH(T A, a, b) satisfies diveristy. Last, we consider the situation Aa\u21c0b 6= {a} and Ab\u21c0a 6= {b}. Thus, the hypothesis implies a \u2208 Leaf(T Aa\u21c0b) and b \u2208 Leaf(T Ab\u21c0a). Let a\u0304 be the unique neighbor of a in T Aa\u21c0b , and b\u0304 be the unique neighbor of b in T Ab\u21c0a . Note that DSP(T A) \u2282 DSH(T A, a, b). We fix arbitrary x, y \u2208 Leaf(T A) such that x \u2208 Aa\u21c0b and y \u2208 Ab\u21c0a. Clearly, x /\u2208 {a, b} and y /\u2208 {a, b}. According to DSP(T A), we fix two single-peaked preferences Pi and P \u2032 i such that r1(Pi) = x and r1(P \u2032 i ) = y. Clearly, Pi and P \u2032 i completely disagree on the relative rankings over \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, i.e., for all z, z\u2032 \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, [z Pi z\u2032] \u21d4 [z\u2032 P \u2032i z]. Now, we construct two linear orders P\u0302i and P\u0302 \u2032 i over A satisfying the following three conditions: (i) for all z \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, z\u2032 \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 and z\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, z P\u0302i z\u2032, z\u2032 P\u0302i z\u2032\u2032, z\u2032\u2032 P\u0302 \u2032i z\u2032 and z\u2032 P\u0302 \u2032i z, (ii) P\u0302i and Pi agree on the relative rankings over A\na\u21c0b \u222a \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, and P\u0302i and P \u2032i completely disagree on the relative rankings over Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, and (iii) P\u0302 \u2032i and P \u2032i agree on the relative rankings over\n45Otherwise, y \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Thus, x, y \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Then, x \u223c y implies (x, y) \u2208 E\u3008a,b|T A\u3009\u223c , which contrasts the contradictory hypothesis.\n46Otherwise, y \u2208 Aa\u21c0b or y \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Then, x \u223c y implies either (x, y) \u2208 EAa\u21c0b\u223c or (x, y) \u2208 E\u3008a,b|T A\u3009 \u223c ,\nwhich contrasts the contradictory hypothesis.\n\u3008a, b|T A\u3009 \u222a Ab\u21c0a, and P\u0302 \u2032i and Pi completely disagree on the relative rankings over Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. By construction, it is easy to show that P\u0302i and P\u0302 \u2032 i are complete reversals and (a, b)-semi-hybrid on T A. This proves statement (ii).\nClarification 3 Given a tree T A and dual-thresholds a, b \u2208 A, an (a, b)-hybrid rule on T A is a tops-only and strategy-proof rule on a domain D \u2286 DSH(T A, a, b).\nFixing a voter i \u2208 N , we consider the following (a, b)-hybrid rule on T A: for all P \u2208 Dn,\nf(P ) =  r1(Pi) if r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, Proj ( a, T \u0393(P ) ) if r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, and Proj ( b, T \u0393(P ) ) if r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}.\nBy definition, it is clear that the hybrid rule f satisfies unanimity and the tops-only property. We\nhence focus on showing its strategy-proofness.\nFirst, we consider the possible manipulation of a voter other than i, say j \u2208 N\\{i}. Given two profiles P = (Pj , P\u2212j) and P\n\u2032 = (P \u2032j , P\u2212j), let f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032). We show f(P ) Pj f(P \u2032). Since f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032), by the definition of f , it must be true that either r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} or r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} holds. The two situations are symmetric, and we hence focus on verifying the first one. Let r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. Thus, by definition, f(P ) = Proj ( a, T \u0393(P ) ) and f(P \u2032) =\nProj ( a, T \u0393(P \u2032) ) . We consider two cases: r1(Pj) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009 \u222aAb\u21c0a and r1(Pj) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}. In the first case, we know that a \u2208 \u0393(P ) and hence f(P ) = a, and moreover (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A implies maxPj (Aa\u21c0b) = a. Meanwhile, since f(P \u2032) = Proj ( a, T \u0393(P \u2032) ) \u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), a|T A\u3009 \u2286 Aa\u21c0b and f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032), it must be the case that f(P ) Pj f(P \u2032), as required. In the second case, P2 is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. a. Then, by the proof of the sufficiency part of the Theorem of Chatterji et al. (2013), we immediately have f(P ) Pj f(P \u2032), as required. In conclusion, voter j \u2208 N\\{i} has no incentive to manipulate. Next, we consider the possible manipulation of voter i. Given two profiles P = (Pi, P\u2212i) and P \u2032 = (P \u2032i , P\u2212i), let f(P ) 6= f(P \u2032). We show f(P ) Pi f(P \u2032). Note that if r1(Pi) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, then f(P ) = r1(Pi), which immediately implies f(P ) Pi f(P \u2032). Henceforth, we assume that either r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} or r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} holds. There are six cases to consider: (1) r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, (2) r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, (3) r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b}, (4) r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, (5) r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a} and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009, and (6) r1(Pi) \u2208 Ab\u21c0a\\{b} and r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. The first two cases are symmetric, and we hence focus on the verification of case (1). In case\n(1), Pi is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. a, f(P ) = Proj ( a, T \u0393(P ) ) and f(P \u2032) = Proj ( a, T \u0393(P \u2032) ) .\nThen, by the proof of the sufficiency part of the Theorem of Chatterji et al. (2013), we immediately have f(P ) Pi f(P \u2032), as required. Cases (3) and (4) are symmetric, and we hence focus\non the verification of case (3). In case (3), we know f(P ) = Proj ( a, T \u0393(P ) ) \u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), a|T A\u3009\nand f(P \u2032) = Proj ( b, T \u0393(P \u2032) ) \u2208 \u3008r1(P \u2032i ), b|T A\u3009 \u2286 Ab\u21c0a. Moreover, since r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, by (a, b)-semi-hybridness on T A, we know Pi is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. a which implies minPi(\u3008r1(Pi), a|T A\u3009) = a and a Pi b, and maxPi(Ab\u21c0a) = b. Therefore, by transitivity of Pi, it must be the case that f(P ) Pi f(P \u2032), as required. Cases (5) and (6) are symmetric, and we hence\nfocus on the verification of case (5). In case (5), we know f(P ) = Proj ( a, T \u0393(P ) ) \u2208 \u3008r1(Pi), a|T A\u3009 and f(P \u2032) = r1(P \u2032 i ) \u2208 \u3008a, b|T A\u3009. Moreover, since r1(Pi) \u2208 Aa\u21c0b\\{a}, we know Pi is semi-singlepeaked on T A w.r.t. a which implies minPi(\u3008r1(Pi), a|T A\u3009) = a and and maxPi(\u3008a, b|T A\u3009) = a. Therefore, by transitivity of Pi, it must be the case that f(P ) Pi f(P \u2032), as required. In conclusion,\nvoter i has no incentive to manipulate. Therefore, the hybrid rule f is strategy-proof.\nClarification 4 Fixing a tree T A and a threshold x\u0304 \u2208 A, a semi-single-peaked domain D on T A w.r.t. x\u0304 satisfies leaf symmetry if and only if either x\u0304 /\u2208 Leaf(T A), or x\u0304 \u2208 Leaf(T A) and D \u2286 DSSP(T A, x\u0304) \u2229 DSSP(T A, x), where NA(x\u0304) = {x}.\nFirst, if x\u0304 /\u2208 Leaf(T A), semi-single-peakedness on T A w.r.t. x\u0304 immediately implies |S(Dz)| = 1 for all z \u2208 Leaf(T A) = Leaf(GA\u223c). Similarly, given x\u0304 \u2208 Leaf(T A) and D \u2286 DSSP(T A, x\u0304) \u2229 DSSP(T A, x), where NA(x\u0304) = {x}, we know that x /\u2208 Leaf(T A) and then semi-single-peakedness on T A w.r.t. x immediately implies |S(Dz)| = 1 for all z \u2208 Leaf(T A) = Leaf(GA\u223c). Conversely, let D satisfies leaf symmetry. We show that either x\u0304 /\u2208 Leaf(T A), or x\u0304 \u2208 Leaf(T A) and D \u2286 DSSP(T A, x\u0304)\u2229 DSSP(T A, x), where NA(x\u0304) = {x}. Suppose not, i.e., x\u0304 \u2208 Leaf(T A) and D * DSSP(T A, x). Since x\u0304 \u2208 Leaf(T A) and NA(x\u0304) = {x}, we know that for all z \u2208 A\\{x\u0304}, x \u2208 \u3008z, x\u0304|T A\u3009. Then, by semisingle-peakedness on T A w.r.t. x\u0304, we know that all preferences with the peak other than x\u0304 are also semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. x. Consequently, D * DSSP(T A, x) implies that some P \u2217i \u2208 Dx\u0304 is not semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. x. Note that given x\u0304 \u2208 Leaf(T A) and NA(x\u0304) = {x}, in any preference with the peak x\u0304 that is semi-single-peaked on T A w.r.t. x, the alternative x must be the second best. Therefore, we must have r2(P \u2217 i ) 6= x. Furthermore, since T A = GA\u223c, x\u0304 \u2208 Leaf(T A) = Leaf(GA\u223c) and NA(x\u0304) = {x}, we know (x\u0304, x) \u2208 EA\u223c . Then, by leaf symmetry, we have a preference P \u2032i \u2208 D such that r1(P \u2032i ) /\u2208 {x\u0304, x} and r2(P \u2032i ) = x\u0304, which contradicts semi-singlepeakedness on T A w.r.t. x\u0304.\nClarification 5 An example of a degenerate semi-hybrid domain.\nLet A = {a1, a2, a3, a4}. All 9 preferences of the domain D and the adjacency graph GA\u223c are respectively specified in Table 4 and Figure 9. First, domain D satisfies path-connectedness according to Figure 9, diversity according to preferences P1 and P9 in Table 4, and leaf symmetry, i.e., Leaf(GA\u223c) = {a4} and |S(Da4)| = 1. Second, since |S(Da4)| = 1, the unique seconds property is also satisfied. Last, we observe that GA\u223c contains a cycle, coincides with the adjacency graph of the semi-hybrid domain DSH(LA, a1, a3), and is strictly included in the adjacency graph of DSH(LA, a1, a4) which is a complete graph. Moreover, since D \u2282 P = DSH(LA, a1, a4) and P2 in Table 4 is not (a1, a3)-semi-hybrid on LA, we infer that D is an (a1, a4)-semi-hybrid domain on LA, and hence a degenerate semi-hybrid domain.\nClarification 6 The relation to Roy and Storcken (2019).\nFirst, recall the notion of weak adjacency introduced in footnote 28. A rich domain D of Roy and Storcken (2019) satisfies the following three conditions:\n1. domain D is weakly path-connected,\n2. [a \u2208 S(Db)]\u21d4 [b \u2208 S(Da)] for all a, b \u2208 A, and\n3. given a, b, c \u2208 A with a b and b c, there exist Pi \u2208 Da and P \u2032i \u2208 Dc such that given d \u2208 A with d Pi c and d P \u2032 i a, we have d P \u2032\u2032 i c or d P \u2032\u2032 i a at some P \u2032\u2032 i \u2208 Db.\nIt is clear that path-connectedness implies the first condition. Next, if we strengthen the\nnotion of weak adjacency in the hypothesis of the third condition by the notion of adjacency, it\nis easy to identify preferences in the domain satisfying the requirement of the third condition. Given a, b, c \u2208 A such that a \u223c b and b \u223c c, we have preferences Pi, P\u0302i, P \u2032i , P\u0302 \u2032i \u2208 D such that r1(Pi) = r2(P\u0302i) = a, r1(P\u0302i) = r2(Pi) = b and rk(Pi) = rk(P\u0302i) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}, and r1(P \u2032 i ) = r2(P\u0302 \u2032 i ) = c, r1(P\u0302 \u2032 i ) = r2(P \u2032 i ) = b and rk(P \u2032 i ) = rk(P\u0302 \u2032 i ) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . ,m}. Thus, we have Pi \u2208 Da, P \u2032i \u2208 Dc and P\u0302i, P\u0302 \u2032i \u2208 Db. Furthermore, given d \u2208 A with d Pi c and d P \u2032i a, we have d P\u0302i c and d P\u0302 \u2032 i a, either of which meets the requirement of the third condition.\nCompared to leaf symmetry, the second condition is too demanding. For instance, recall the semi-single-peaked domain DSSP(LA, a3), where |A| = m \u2265 4. Clearly, a preference with the peak a3 has no restriction on the rankings of other alternatives. Therefore, any alternative other than a3 can be second ranked in a semi-single-peaked preference with the peak a3, i.e., S ( Da3SSP(LA, a3) ) =\n{a1, a2, a4, . . . , am}, and hence \u2223\u2223S(Da3SSP(LA, a3))\u2223\u2223 > 1. Meanwhile, by semi-single-peakedness on LA w.r.t. a3, we know a2 Pi a3 for all preference Pi \u2208 DSSP(LA, a3) with r1(Pi) = a1, which implies a3 /\u2208 S ( Da1SSP(LA, a3) ) . Therefore, the second condition above is violated here. This however does not contrast leaf symmetry since a3 is not a leaf in the adjacency graph G A \u223c = LA.\nClarification 7 Verify strategy-proofness of the SCF f constructed in Example 2.\nFix a profile (Pi, Pj). We first verify all possible manipulations of voter i. First, let r1(Pj) \u2208 A\\B, Then, by construction, we know f(P \u2032i , Pj) = r1(Pj) for all P \u2032i \u2208 D2. Hence, no manipulation of voter i is profitable. Next, let r1(Pj) \u2208 B. Then, by construction, we know f(P \u2032i , Pj) \u2208 B for all P \u2032i \u2208 D2. Hence, f(Pi, Pj) = maxPi(B) implies that no manipulation of voter i is profitable. Therefore, voter i has no incentive to manipulate. We next verify all possible manipulation of voter j. First, let r1(Pj) \u2208 A\\B. Then, f(Pi, Pj) = r1(Pj) implies that no manipulation of voter j is profitable. Next, let r1(Pj) \u2208 B. Thus, f(Pi, Pj) = maxPi(B) \u2208 B. Consider a possible manipulation P \u2032j \u2208 D2. If r1(P \u2032j) \u2208 B, we have f(Pi, P \u2032j) = maxPi(B) = f(Pi, Pj), which implies that the manipulation is not profitable. If r1(P \u2032 j) \u2208 A\\B, we have f(Pi, P \u2032j) = r1(P \u2032i ) \u2208 A\\B. Since r1(Pj) \u2208 B, we know that Pj must be one of the first six preferences in Table 2, and hence voter j prefers each alternative of B to each alternative of A\\B. Hence, we have f(Pi, Pj) Pj f(Pi, P \u2032j), as required. Therefore, voter j has no incentive to manipulate. In conclusion, f is strategy-proof.\nClarification 8 Verify strategy-proofness of the SCF f constructed in Example 3.\nSince f is anonymous, it suffices to focus on all possible manipulations of voter i. Given two\ndistinct profiles (Pi, Pj) and (P \u2032 i , Pj), it is clear that if f(Pi, Pj) = r1(Pi) or f(Pi, Pj) = f(P \u2032 i , Pj), voter i has no incentive to manipulate at (Pi, Pj) via P \u2032 i . We henceforth assume f(Pi, Pj) 6= r1(Pi) and f(Pi, Pj) 6= f(P \u2032i , Pj). There are four cases: (1) f(Pi, Pj) = d 6= r1(Pi) and f(P \u2032i , Pj) 6= d, (2) f(Pi, Pj) = a 6= r1(Pi) and f(P \u2032i , Pj) 6= a, (3) f(Pi, Pj) = c 6= r1(Pi) and f(P \u2032i , Pj) 6= c, and (4) f(Pi, Pj) = b 6= r1(Pi) and f(P \u2032i , Pj) 6= b. Note that the first three cases are symmetric. We hence focus on the verification of cases (1) and (4).\nFirst, we consider case (1). By construction, f(Pi, Pj) = d implies one of the following subcases: (i) Pi = P7 and Pj \u2208 Dd3, or (ii) Pi \u2208 Dd3 and Pj = P7, or (iii) f(Pi, Pj) = Proj ( b, \u3008r1(Pi), r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 ) . Immediately, we rule out subcase (ii) since r1(Pi) 6= d, and also rule out subcase (iii) since d =\nf(Pi, Pj) = Proj ( b, \u3008r1(Pi), r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 ) implies r1(Pi) = r1(Pj) = d, which contrasts the hypothesis r1(Pi) 6= d. Therefore, subcase (i) holds. Thus, we have f(Pi, Pj) = d, f(P \u2032i , Pj) 6= d, Pi = P7 and Pj \u2208 Dd3. By the construction of f , we observe that given Pj \u2208 Dd3, there exists no P \u2032i \u2208 D3 such that f(P \u2032i , Pj) = a. Therefore, r1(Pi) = r1(P7) = a 6= f(P \u2032i , Pj), r2(Pi) = r2(P7) = d = f(Pi, Pj) and f(Pi, Pj) 6= f(P \u2032i , Pj) imply f(Pi, Pj) Pi f(P \u2032i , Pj). In conclusion, in case (1), voter i has no incentive to manipulate at (Pi, Pj) via P \u2032 i .\nLast, we consider case (4). Since r1(Pi) 6= b, one of the following three situations must occur: Pi \u2208 Da3, or Pi \u2208 Dc3, or Pi \u2208 Da3. These three situations are symmetric, and we hence assume w.l.o.g. that Pi \u2208 Da3 = {P1, P7}. Since f(Pi, Pj) = b, the construction of f implies b = f(Pi, Pj) = Proj ( b, \u3008r1(Pi), r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 ) = Proj ( b, \u3008a, r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 ) , which further implies r1(Pj) 6= a. Furthermore, if r1(Pj) = b, it is clear that f(P \u2032 i , Pj) = Proj ( b, \u3008r1(Pi), b|T A\u3009 ) = b by construction, which contradicts the hypothesis f(P \u2032i , Pj) 6= b. Therefore, Pj \u2208 Dc3 \u222a Dd3 = {P5, P8, P6, P9}. Moreover, since f(Pi, Pj) = b 6= a and Pi \u2208 Da3, the construction of f further implies Pj 6= P8. Therefore, Pj \u2208 {P5, P6, P9}. Now, according to Pi \u2208 {P1, P7}, we consider two subcases: (i) Pi = P1 and (ii) Pi = P7. In subcase (i), suppose by contradiction that f(P \u2032 i , Pj) Pi f(Pi, Pj). This, by f(Pi, Pj) = b and Pi = P1, implies f(P \u2032 i , Pj) = a. Since Pj /\u2208 Da3 and Pj 6= P8, by the construction of f , we must\nhave a = f(P \u2032i , Pj) = Proj ( b, \u3008r1(P \u2032i ), r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 ) = Proj ( r1(P \u2032 i ), \u3008b, r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 ) \u2208 \u3008b, r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 This implies r1(Pj) = a, which contradicts the fact Pj /\u2208 Da3. In subcase (ii), since Pi = P7 and f(Pi, Pj) = b 6= d, the construction of f implies Pj /\u2208 Dd3 = {P6, P9}. Hence, we have Pj = P5 \u2208 Dc3. Thus, by the construction of f , we know that either P \u2032i = P9 and f(P \u2032i , Pj) = c, or f(P \u2032i , Pj) = Proj ( b, \u3008r1(P \u2032i ), r1(Pj)|T A\u3009 ) = Proj ( b, \u3008r1(P \u2032i ), c|T A\u3009 ) = Proj ( r1(P \u2032 i ), \u3008b, c|T A\u3009 ) \u2208 \u3008b, c|T A\u3009 = {b, c} holds. Furthermore, since f(P \u2032i , Pj) 6= b, we have f(P \u2032i , Pj) = c. Consequently, according to Pi = P7, we have f(Pi, Pj) Pi f(P \u2032 i , Pj). Overall, in both subcases, voter i has no incentive to manipulate. In conclusion, f is strategy-proof."

            "heading": "H A brief extension to multidimensional models",
            "text": "In this section, we provide an application of Theorem 1 to a multidimensional setting. Let a finite alternative set A be decomposed as a Cartesian product, i.e., A = \u00d7s\u2208MAs, where M = {1, . . . , `}, ` > 1, and |As| \u2265 2 for each s \u2208 M . Thus, an alternative is uniquely assembled by ` elements of A1, . . . , A`, i.e., x = (x1, . . . , x`) = (xs, x\u2212s). Given a, b \u2208 A, let M(a, b) = {s \u2208 M : as 6= bs} denote the set of components on which a and b disagree. Thus, two alternatives a, b \u2208 A are said similar if |M(a, b)| = 1. Fix a domain D of preferences over A. Given a preference Pi \u2208 D and a nonempty subset B \u2282 A, let Pi|B denote the preference over B induced via removing all alternatives out of B in Pi. Given s \u2208M and a\u2212s \u2208 A\u2212s, let (As, a\u2212s) = {(as, a\u2212s) \u2208 A : as \u2208 As} and D(As,a\u2212s) = {Pi \u2208 D : r1(Pi) \u2208 (As, a\u2212s)}. In particular, a preference Pi \u2208 D is separable if there exists a marginal preference (or a linear order) P si over A\ns for each s \u2208 M such that for all similar alternatives a, b \u2208 A, say M(a, b) = {s}, we have [as P si bs]\u21d2 [a Pi b].\nAs noted earlier, the domain of all separable preferences is excluded from unidimensional do-\nmains due to the violation of adjacency. We introduce a new notion between two alternatives\nwhich generalizes the notion of adjacency to cover domains that contain separable preferences. Fixing a domain D, two alternatives a, b \u2208 A are adjacent+, denoted a \u223c+ b, if they are similar, say M(a, b) = {s}, and there exist two separable preferences Pi \u2208 Da and P \u2032i \u2208 Db satisfying the following two conditions:\n(i) given x\u2212s \u2208 A\u2212s, (as, x\u2212s) = rk(Pi) = rk+1(P \u2032i ) and (bs, x\u2212s) = rk(P \u2032i ) = rk+1(Pi) for some 1 \u2264 k < |A|, and\n(ii) given c \u2208 A, [ cs /\u2208 {as, bs} ] \u21d2 [ c = rk(Pi) = rk(P \u2032 i ) for some 2 < k \u2264 |A| ] .\nAccordingly, given s \u2208 M and a\u2212s \u2208 A\u2212s, we induce a graph G(A s,a\u2212s)\n\u223c+ , where the vertex set\nis (As, a\u2212s), and two vertices of (As, a\u2212s) form an edge if and only if they are adjacent+. A domain D satisfies path-connectedness+ if G(A s, a\u2212s)\n\u223c+ is a connected graph for each s \u2208 M and a\u2212s \u2208 A\u2212s. Moreover, a domain D satisfies diversity+ if there exists a pair of separable preferences P i, P i \u2208 D that are complete reversals, and furthermore for each s \u2208M , there exist a\u2212s \u2208 A\u2212s and Pi, P \u2032 i \u2208 D(A\ns,a\u2212s) such that Pi|(As,a\u2212s) and P \u2032i |(As,a\u2212s) are complete reversals. Henceforth, a domain D is called a multidimensional domain if it satisfies both path-connectedness+ and diversity+.47\nNow fix a multidimensional domain D and a two-voter, tops-only and strategy-proof rule f : D2 \u2192 A. As a first step towards characterizing such a rule, we fix an arbitrary component s \u2208M . By diversity+, we have a\u2212s \u2208 A\u2212s and preferences Pi, P \u2032i \u2208 D(A\ns,a\u2212s) such that Pi|(As,a\u2212s) and P \u2032i |(As,a\u2212s) are complete reversals. We then restrict attention to f on the subdomain D(A s,a\u2212s).\nLet D|(As,a\u2212s) = { Pi|(As,a\u2212s) : Pi \u2208 D(A s,a\u2212s) }\n. Note that D|(As,a\u2212s) satisfies path-connectedness and diversity.48 Also, note that given P1, P2, P \u2032 1, P \u2032 2 \u2208 D(A\ns,a\u2212s), if P1|(As,a\u2212s) = P \u20321|(As,a\u2212s) and P2|(As,a\u2212s) = P \u20322|(As,a\u2212s), then r1(P1) = r1(P \u20321), r1(P2) = r1(P \u20322), and hence f(P1, P2) = f(P \u20321, P \u20322) by the tops-only property. Similar to statement (i) of Lemma 5, we can easily show f(P1, P2) \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) for all P1, P2 \u2208 D(A s,a\u2212s). Then, we can induce a tops-only and strategy-proof rule\ng : [ D|(As,a\u2212s) ]2 \u2192 (As, a\u2212s) such that g ( P1|(As,a\u2212s), P2|(As,a\u2212s) ) = f(P1, P2) for all P1, P2 \u2208 D(A s,a\u2212s).\nAccording to the two completely reversed preferences in D|(As,a\u2212s), we know that g is either invariant or not. If g is invariant, then by Statement (i) of Theorem 1, g is a projection rule, and hence f behaves like a projection rule on (As, a\u2212s)), i.e., there exist a tree T (As,a\u2212s) and an alternative (x\u0302s, a\u2212s) \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) such that for all a, b \u2208 (As, a\u2212s),\nf(a, b) = g(a, b) = Proj ( (x\u0302s, a\u2212s), \u3008a, b|T (As,a\u2212s)\u3009 ) .\nIf g is not invariant, then by the proof of Statement (ii) of Theorem 1, g is a hybrid rule, and hence f behaves like a hybrid rule on (As, a\u2212s)), i.e., there exist a tree T (As,a\u2212s) and dual-thresholds (xs, a\u2212s) and (xs, a\u2212s) in T (As,a\u2212s), which induce the following three exhaustive subsets of (As, a\u2212s):\n(As, a\u2212s) = { a \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) : (xs, a\u2212s) \u2208 \u3008a, (xs, a\u2212s)|T (As,a\u2212s)\u3009 } ,\n\u0302(As, a\u2212s) = { a \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) : a \u2208 \u3008(xs, a\u2212s), (xs, a\u2212s)|T (As,a\u2212s)\u3009 } , and\n(As, a\u2212s) = { a \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) : (xs, a\u2212s) \u2208 \u3008a, (xs, a\u2212s)|T (As,a\u2212s)\u3009 } ,\n47The notion of adjacency+ was originally introduced by Chatterji and Zeng (2019). The multidimensional\ndomains introduced by Chatterji and Zeng (2019) are restricted domains: all preferences are required to\nbe top-separable (introduced by Le Breton and Weymark, 1999). Moreover, their investigation focuses\non a subclass of multidimensional domains where all preferences are well organized in the manner that is\nanalogous to no-restoration. The class of multidimensional domains introduced here is significantly less\ndemanding, as it is only concerned with the richness of separable preferences included in the domain, and\nconsequentially the universal domain is covered as a special case. 48Given distinct as, bs \u2208 As, let Pi \u2208 D(a s,a\u2212s) and P \u2032i \u2208 D(b s,a\u2212s) be two separable preferences that indicate (as, a\u2212s) \u223c+ (bs, a\u2212s). Then, the induced preferences Pi|(As,a\u2212s) and P \u2032i |(As,a\u2212s) satisfy the following conditions: (i) r1 ( Pi|(As,a\u2212s) ) = r2 ( P \u2032i |(As,a\u2212s) ) = (as, a\u2212s) and r1 ( P \u2032i |(As,a\u2212s) ) = r2 ( Pi|(As,za\u2212s) ) = (bs, a\u2212s),\nand (ii) rk ( Pi|(As,a\u2212s) ) = rk ( P \u2032i |(As,a\u2212s) ) for all k \u2208 {3, . . . , |As|}. This indicates that in the induced domain D|(As,a\u2212s), alternatives (as, a\u2212s) and (bs, a\u2212s) are adjacent. Consequently, the adjacency graph G(A s,a\u2212s) \u223c induced according to D|(As,a\u2212s) must contain the connected graph G (As,a\u2212s) \u223c+ . Therefore, D|(As,a\u2212s) is a path-connected domain.\nsuch that one of the following two cases must occur: (i) for all a, b \u2208 (As, a\u2212s),\nf(a, b) = g(a, b) =  a if a \u2208 \u0302(As, a\u2212s), Proj ( (xs, a\u2212s), \u3008a, b|T (As,a\u2212s)\u3009 ) if a \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) \u2216 {(xs, a\u2212s)}, and\nProj ( (xs, a\u2212s), \u3008a, b|T (As,a\u2212s)\u3009 ) if a \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) \u2216 {(xs, a\u2212s)},\nor (ii) for all a, b \u2208 (As, a\u2212s),\nf(a, b) = g(a, b) =  b if b \u2208 \u0302(As, a\u2212s), Proj ( (xs, a\u2212s), \u3008a, b|T (As,a\u2212s)\u3009 ) if b \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) \u2216 {(xs, a\u2212s)}, and\nProj ( (xs, a\u2212s), \u3008a, b|T (As,a\u2212s)\u3009 ) if b \u2208 (As, a\u2212s) \u2216 {(xs, a\u2212s)}.\nThe characterization of g provided above constitutes an essential ingredient of a full charac-\nterization of f . We leave the task of fully characterizing a rule on a multidimensional domain and extracting the domain implications of the strategy-proofness of such a rule for future work.49\n49All our analysis so far is based on strategy-proof SCFs which are only concerned with unilateral de-\nviations at a preference profile. The investigation on multidimensional domains can be enriched when we\nexpand to SCFs that are immune to group deviations. It is known from Barbera\u0300 et al. (2016) that on a\nmultidimensional domain, the number of voters and dimensions affect the elicitation of preference restriction\nwhen the SCF is required to satisfy some stronger notion of incentive compatibility that is related to group\ndeviations, like group-strategy-proofness or immunity to credible deviations."
