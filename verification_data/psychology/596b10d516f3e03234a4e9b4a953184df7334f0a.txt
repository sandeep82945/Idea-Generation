"The aim of the study was to gain insight into the mechanism of CO2 electrochemical reduction catalyzed by cobalt porphyrin in ionic liquid. To achieve this, SERS spectra are recorded for cobalt porphyrin immobilized electrode in CO2 saturated ionic liquid and water (V:V = 9:1) as presented in Figure 5."
