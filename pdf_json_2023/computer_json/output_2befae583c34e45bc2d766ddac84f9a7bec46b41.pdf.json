    "abstractText": "Rapid urban development in China has aggravated land subsidence, which poses a potential threat to sustainable urban development. It is imperative to monitor and predict land subsidence over large areas. To address these issues, we chose Henan Province as the study area and applied small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology to obtain land deformation information for monitoring land subsidence from November 2019 to February 2022 with 364 multitrack Sentinel-1A satellite images. The current traditional time-series deep learning models suffer from the problems of (1) poor results in extracting a sequence of information that is too long and (2) the inability to extract the feature information between the influence factor and the land subsidence well. Therefore, a long short-term memory-temporal convolutional network (LSTM-TCN) deep learning model was proposed in order to predict land subsidence and explore the influence of environmental factors, such as the volumetric soil water layer and monthly precipitation, on land subsidence in this study. We used leveling data to verify the effectiveness of SBAS-InSAR in land subsidence monitoring. The results of SBAS-InSAR showed that the land subsidence in Henan Province was obvious and uneven in spatial distribution. The maximum subsidence velocity was \u221294.54 mm/a, and the uplift velocity was 41.23 mm/a during the monitoring period. Simultaneously, the land subsidence in the study area presented seasonal changes. The rate of land subsidence in spring and summer was greater than that in autumn and winter. The prediction accuracy of the LSTMTCN model was significantly better than that of the individual LSTM and TCN models because it fully combined their advantages. In addition, the prediction accuracies, with the addition of environmental factors, were improved compared with those using only time-series subsidence information.",

            "text": "Land subsidence is a geological issue in which land in a given region loses elevation under soil compression induced by natural or human activities. Humans continue to exploit coal, oil, gas, and groundwater for their own development needs [1\u20136]. Land subsidence has become a geological disaster that cannot be ignored in social and economic development [7,8]. Land subsidence creates large threats and losses for human productivity and life safety and severely hampers sustainable development [9,10]. Therefore, early monitoring and forecasting of land subsidence are of great significance to prevent and control geological disasters [11]. Traditional methods are mainly conventional geodetic observations based on discrete points, such as leveling, GNSS, and LiDAR technology, which are used to obtain highly\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2843. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15112843 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2843 2 of 28\naccurate land deformation information to monitor land subsidence [12\u201314]. However, limited by small-scale monitoring areas, long measurement cycles, and high costs, these traditional approaches cannot meet the requirement of timely monitoring over large areas [15]. The monthly mass concentration change data from the GRACE gravity satellite cannot achieve high-precision monitoring of land subsidence due to its low resolution [16\u201318]. The time series InSAR technology can provide all-weather, high-precision high-resolution land deformation information and has been widely used for large-scale continuous land deformation monitoring [19\u201323]. Furthermore, InSAR technology has been widely used to detect land deformation caused by groundwater level fluctuations [24\u201327]. Differential InSAR (D-InSAR) is a technique for acquiring information about small land deformations by combining 2-view SAR imagery with external topographic data [28]. Time-series InSAR satellite remote sensing technology, such as persistent scatterer-InSAR (PS-InSAR) [29\u201331] and small baseline subset-InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) [32], has been used to estimate land deformation at high spatial resolutions with mm-scale accuracy. In particular, SBAS-InSAR can use all available interferometric pairs to achieve high accuracy even with shorter wavelength SAR data (such as C-band) over large areas, and consequently, it exhibits great potential applications to the field of large-scale and long time series land subsidence monitoring [33\u201335]. There are threemain approaches to land subsidence prediction: physical models [36], mathematical statistical models [37], and machine learning models [38\u201342]. The physical model predicts land subsidence based on a series of complex geological and hydrological characteristics of physical parameters through field investigations and experiments. However, these models cannot fit the land subsidence trend well because they require that assumptions be made about complex parameters in order to construct the corresponding models, which may fail at any time [43]. Mathematical statistical methods use numerical and empirical models, such as regression analysis and gray prediction, to predict land subsidence based on the analysis of internal relationships of a large amount of historical monitoring data [44]. However, it is difficult to generalize this method because it does not consider the internal structural relationship between underground rock and soil media. Machine learning methods can achieve high-accuracy prediction of land subsidence by mining the trend of historical land subsidence data and learning the internal nonlinear characteristics of land subsidence [45]. However, the current machine learning algorithms fail to adequately consider the information on the association characteristics between the influencing factors and land subsidence, and they do not show better prediction results for a particular study area. In fact, subsidence at any site is related to many factors, such as geological structure, soil volume water content, and rainfall distribution. If the correlation characteristics between these factors and land subsidence are not considered properly, the constructed prediction models may be invalid in local areas [46]. In particular, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is specifically designed for sequence prediction problems and has been extensively used in land subsidence prediction [47]. However, due to the serialized nature of LSTM data processing, only critical historical information can be obtained and retained by rolling in one direction, and only a limited length of data information can be obtained. A temporal convolutional network (TCN) is made up of parallelized convolutional networks that can process massive amounts of long sequence data more efficiently. Moreover, its dilated convolutional architecture in the network can flexibly control the size of the receptive field so that the network can process longer time series with certain parameters [48]. Compared with the LSTM model, the TCN model can extract the characteristic information between the influence factor and the land subsidence information and handle longer time-series information in order to realize the long time-series prediction of land subsidence. Therefore, a deep learning network architecture of LSTM-TCN was proposed in order to achieve a high-precision subsidence prediction, which combines the respective advantages of the LSTM and TCN models in this study. In summary, this study considered Henan Province as a case study and aimed to investigate the application of SAR data in the monitoring and prediction of large-scale land\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2843 3 of 28\nsubsidence.

Then, we verified the accuracy of the SBAS-InSAR results by comparing them with the level data. Next, the spatiotemporal characteristics of land deformation were analyzed. We used the LSTM model to extract the time-series information of land subsidence and the TCN model to extract the feature information between the influencing factors and land subsidence. Finally, a deep learning approach based on the LSTM-TCN model was proposed in order to simulate the complex nonlinear relationship between time-series land subsidence data and related environmental factors to predict land subsidence."

Figure 1 shows that the study area occupies four different SAR tracks: track 11, track 113, track 40, and track 142. We solved the problem of fusing SAR image data from different locations of the same orbit and different orbits by selecting common reference points in overlapping regions in this study. The black dots and green triangular dots in Figure 1 indicate the locations of the common reference points for the same and different orbits, respectively. The above common reference points are stable monitoring points with no displacement or deformation during the entire monitoring period of this study. During the single-track SAR data processing, the black dots were used as reference points for the same track land deformation calculation to complete the data processing. Then, we compared the time-series displacement deformation at the level measurement points in the study area with the monitoring results and calculated the offset to calibrate the single-track InSAR monitoring results. For multitrack SAR data, the fusion of multitrack SAR data was essential because of the differences in monitoring results due to the different imaging angles of SAR images from different tracks, the capture time, and the position of reference points during data processing. In this study, we calibrated the orbit monitoring results by using the difference between the monitoring results of two different orbit overlapping areas as the offset in order to ensure the accuracy of the fusion results. Based on the single-track data processing, we used the green triangle point as the common reference point to obtain the second monitoring results again experimentally. Specifically, we took the calibrated track 40 deformation point as the reference. Then, we used the green triangular point in the overlapping area of track 40 and track 142 as the reference point to obtain the second monitoring results of track 40 and track 142. Next, we calibrated the first single-track monitoring results of track 142 based on the difference between the two experimental results for the track 40 and track 142 overlap area as the offset (Figure 4). Specifically, we took the SAR processing result of 142 for the first single track plus the offset as the result after fusion. Then, the results were stitched with the results of track 40 to complete the fusion processing of the SAR results of track 40 and track 142. Following the above method, the difference between the experimental results of the track 40 and track 113 overlapping area was calculated twice as the offset to calibrate the monitoring results of track 113 for the first single track. We selected the calibrated single-track 40 deformation point as the reference. Subsequently, we completed the data fusion of track 40, track 142, and track 113. Notably, when fusing the track 11 data, we took the results of the fused data of track 40, track 142, and track 113 as the reference. The difference between the second monitoring result of the overlapping area of track 11 and track 113 and the result of the overlapping area after the fusion of the track 113, track 142, and track 40 was calculated to complete the calibration of the first single-track monitoring result of track 11. Finally, we completed the data fusion of track 40, track 142, track 113, and track 11. In addition, we compared the final fusion results with the level measurement data for verification to ensure the accuracy of the InSAR monitoring results in the study area.

The meaning of the hole convolution is to control the interval size of each convolution layer neuron to increase or reduce the receptive field. When d is larger,\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2843 10 of 28\nthe hole convolution layer has a larger receptive field, which can obtain more effective input sequence information. From the above LSTM and TCN model architecture, the LSTM serialization calculation structure has certain limitations in the land subsidence prediction model. The TCN model can parallelize the input sequence to compensate for the lack of an LSTM model structure. Therefore, we propose an LSTM-TCN model that uses the extended convolution property of the TCN model to capture more critical information. Specifically, the LSTM-TCN model in this study combines the characteristics of the LSTM model to extract temporal information, the TCN convolutional layer to extract the characteristic information of influence factors and land subsidence, and the multidimensional residual connection layer to improve the accuracy of the experimental results. To better represent the input matrix, we divided the cumulative subsidence matrix and the corresponding environmental factor matrix.

The input matrix Xt,m of any subsidence point m is obtained as follows:\nXt,m =  Lt,m Pt,m V1t,m V2t,m V3t,m V4t,m Lt\u22121,m Pt\u22121,m V1t\u22121,m V2t\u22121,m V3t\u22121,m V4t\u22121,m ... ... ... ... ...\n...

Specifically, we calculated the average deformation rate of the land in the subsidence region in spring\u2013summer and autumn\u2013winter to explore the characteristics of seasonal land subsidence in the subsidence region. The sum of the cumulative spring\u2013summer deformation variables of the subsidence area land in 2020 and 2021 was divided by two as the semiannual average spring\u2013summer deformation rate of the subsidence area land, and the sum of the cumulative autumn\u2013winter deformation variables was divided by two as the semiannual average autumn\u2013winter deformation rate of the subsidence area land. If the deformation rate was positive, the land of the region was uplifting; otherwise, the land was subsiding. A total of 15,364 subsidence points were selected as characteristic points to explore the seasonal characteristics of land subsidence in Henan Province. Figures 7 and 8 show the results of the seasonal characteristics of land subsidence. Figure 7 shows the semiannual average deformation rates in spring and summer in Henan Province. Anyang, Hebi, Shangqiu, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Pingdingshan, Nanyang, Xinyang, Kaifeng, Luoyang and Sanmenxia all experienced subsidence in spring and summer in 2020 and 2021, as shown in Figure 7. Among them, the average subsidence rate of Luoyang exceeded 100 mm/semiannual. The average subsidence rates of Sanmenxia and Pingdingshan ranged from 80 mm/semiannual to 100 mm/semiannual. Figure 8 shows the semiannual average deformation rate of the land in Henan Province in autumn and winter. Anyang, Hebi, Shangqiu, Xuchang, Pingdingshan, Nanyang and Xinyang showed subsidence of the land in the autumn and winter of 2020 and 2021. The average subsidence rates in these regions were smaller than the subsidence rates in the corresponding regions in Figure 7. Some areas in Sanmenxia, Luoyang, Zhengzhou and Kaifeng experienced land uplift in the autumn and winter of 2020 and 2021. The average rate of land uplift in some areas of Luoyang exceeded 20 mm/semiannual. We also calculated the percentage of subsidence points in the study area where subsidence occurred in the autumn and winter of 2020 and 2021, which reached 93.34%. In general, the land in the subsidence area in the study area appeared to sink in spring and summer, the average rate of subsidence in the corresponding area was greater than that in autumn and winter, and the land ratio of some of the subsidence areas rose in autumn and winter compared with that in spring and summer, delaying the land subsidence phenomenon. In this study, environmental factor data and subsidence point data of subsidence areas were combined to analyze the causes of seasonal characteristics of land subsidence in Henan Province, as shown in Table 3. In general, the semiannual average subsidence rate in the subsidence area increased by 1.19 mm/semiannual in spring\u2013summer compared to autumn\u2013winter. The semiannual average precipitation in the subsidence area reached 619.29 mm/semiannual in spring\u2013summer and 229.61 mm/semiannual in autumn\u2013winter, as shown in Table 3. The semiannual average precipitation in the subsidence area decreased significantly in autumn\u2013winter compared to spring\u2013summer. Combining the semiannual average subsidence rate data of spring\u2013summer and autumn\u2013winter in the subsidence region, the results showed that the influence of precipitation on land subsidence in the subsidence region has a certain hysteresis, which is manifested in the fact that abundant precipitation in spring and summer can replenish groundwater and delay land subsidence in autumn and winter. Therefore, in general, the subsidence phenomenon is more obvious in spring and summer in the subsidence area than in autumn and winter. In addition, we also found that the volumetric soil layer water content directly affects land subsidence. Specifically, the decrease in water content in the volumetric soil layer resulted in the subsidence of the land, and the increase in water content in the volumetric soil layer resulted in the delayed subsidence or uplift of the land. The semiannual average water\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2843 13 of 28\ncontent of the four volumetric soil layers in this study was significantly smaller in spring and summer than in autumn and winter, explaining the phenomenon that the semiannual average subsidence rate in the subsidence area was larger in spring and summer than in autumn and winter.

Notably, 70% of all datasets were used for training, 20% of all datasets were used to\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2843 17 of 28\nverify the trained model, and the remaining 10% of all datasets were used as a test set to evaluate the model. We set different parameters and experimentally determined the parameter combinations for the optimal parameters. The loss curves of the experimental training and validation sets are shown in Figure 13, and the optimal parameter combination for the LSTM-TCN model is a learning rate (lr) of 0.0003, one LSTM layer, three dilated convolutional layers, 100 epochs, and 64 batch sizes. In addition, the optimal parameter combination for the LSTM model is a lr of 0.0003, three LSTM layers, 100 epochs, and 64 batch sizes. The optimal combination of parameters for the TCN model is a lr of 0.0003, 4 dilated convolutional layers, 100 epochs, and 64 batch sizes. We also observe that the training set loss for the four parameter combinations of the LSTM-TCN model is smaller than that of the other two models, and its convergence is faster than that of the LSTM and TCN models, as shown in Figure 13. We constructed the experimental LSTM, TCN and LSTM-TCN models using the optimal combination of parameters of L4, T4, and LT4 in Table 4. We obtained the correlation results between the predicted data of the LSTM, TCN, and LSTM-TCN models and the SBAS-InSAR result data for a more visual observation of the experimental accuracy, as shown in Figure 14. We used the RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), prediction error less than 3 mm, 0~100 mm MAE (MAE values of InSAR monitoring results and model prediction results in the range of 0~100 mm), 100~200 mm MAE (MAE values of InSAR monitoring results and model prediction results in the range of 100~200 mm), and R2 to evaluate the model\u2019s accuracy.

The TCN model has smaller fluctuations in the curve changes in RMSE, \ud835\udc45 , MAE, and MAPE with increasing sample size prediction accuracy compared with the LSTM model, and the results of its MAPE curve changes are even close to those of the LSTM-TCN model. Collectively, the LSTM-TCN model can also obtain better prediction results when the sample size is small. When the sample size increases to the optimal threshold, the LSTM-TCN model can combine the advantages of the LSTM model and the TCN model to improve the accuracy of the prediction results. The prediction accuracy curve of the LSTM-TCN model remains smooth when the sample size reaches the optimal threshold, showing a low sensitivity to sample size.\nFigure 17.

The results show that the accuracy of RMSE, R2, MAE, MAPE, and the prediction error is less than 3 mm, and the three models are improved after adding environmental factors. The R2 of the LSTM model increased from 0.84 to 0.89, the R2 of the TCN model increased from 0.94 to 0.96, and the R2 of the LSTM-TCN model increased from 0.95 to 0.99, which greatly improved the accuracy. From the overall results, regardless of whether environmental factors were added, the accuracy ranking of the three models was LSTM-TCN > TCN > LSTM, which further demonstrated the effectiveness of the constructed LSTM-TCN model. After adding environmental factors, the LSTM-TCN model has more obvious accuracy improvement compared with the LSTM model and TCN model, which shows the superiority of the model for feature extraction between land subsidence and environmental factors."

The results in Figure 18 show that the best experimental results were obtained with a two-dimensional matrix consisting of environmental factors and cumulative land subsidence for 17 consecutive months. In this study, two-dimensional input matrices, larger or smaller than 17 months for the 27-month time series of land-cumulative subsidence data, would reduce the accuracy results of the LSTM-TCN model. Choosing the appropriate two-dimensional matrix for the length of the monthly time series allows the model to fully extract the characteristic information between the land-cumulative subsidence data and the environmental factors and then to better fit the future deformation trend of the land subsidence, which provides us with a reference for timely monitoring and early warning of the occurrence of geological hazards."

            "text": "In the prediction of time-series land subsidence, researchers used traditional machine learning algorithms to model and predict land subsidence from a data-driven perspective. For example, the boosted regression trees and extreme gradient boosting algorithms model and predict land subsidence from a data-driven perspective, and this study achieved the modeling and prediction of land subsidence rates in agricultural areas [54]. There are also researchers who identified landslide-prone areas by mapping them with the help of machine learning models, which served to prevent and mitigate landslides. Specifically, this study used the logistic regression (LR) model and the random forest (RF) model to evaluate the sensitivity of landslides [55]. In addition, many researchers used LSTM models for modeling predictions of time-series land subsidence. The literature [56] compared the prediction results of the LSTM model with the recur-\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2843 23 of 28\nrent neural network (RNN) model and a multi-layer perceptron model. The results showed that the LSTM model was more efficient in prediction than both models and can achieve effective short-term prediction of land subsidence. The literature [57] used a convolutional neural network to extract spatial feature information of land subsidence in mining areas and the LSTM model to extract temporal feature information of land subsidence in order to achieve the spatial and temporal prediction of land subsidence. The literature [58] divided the study area into subregions based on InSAR monitoring results and used LSTM models to capture the non-linear correlation characteristics of each subregion in order to achieve prediction of land subsidence. The literature [59] first used the SBAS-InSAR technique to extract land deformation information from the mining areas and then used a combination of LSTM models and grid search algorithms to predict the time-series land subsidence. However, the abovementioned traditional machine learning methods cannot extract and model the cumulative land subsidence information in a time series and cannot obtain comprehensive information on future land subsidence trends. Deep learning models, such as RNN and LSTM models, suffer from gradient explosion and gradient disappearance, which have limitations in modeling long time-series land subsidence prediction.

In addition, the LSTM-TCN model can also extract time-series feature information on influence factors and land subsidence, thus enabling the prediction of the time-series land subsidence by combining multiple influence factors. Notably, due to the parallelized sequence structure of the TCN model, the LSTM-TCN model can handle large amounts of data from a larger study area more efficiently. The LSTM-TCN model has promising applications in large-scale regional land subsidence in Henan Province."

However, for large monitoring areas, groundwater level data for the entire area may be unavailable. In this study, in the absence of groundwater level data in part of the study area, soil volumetric water content data was used as an input factor in the prediction model in order to complete the prediction of the time-series land subsidence for the entire study area. We collected and collated data on groundwater levels in Zhengzhou City, as shown in Table 7. To assess the feasibility of the method in this study, we used groundwater levels and precipitation data, volumetric soil water content and precipitation data of Zhengzhou City as input factors for the LSTM-TCN model, respectively, and compared their prediction results, as shown in Table 8. Table 8 shows that the prediction accuracy of land subsidence was slightly better than that of volumetric soil water content and precipitation data when groundwater level and precipitation data were used as input factors for the LSTM-TCN model, indicating the importance of groundwater level data on land subsidence. However, in general, for the whole study area, the modelling experiments using volumetric soil water content and precipitation data for land subsidence prediction obtained better prediction results over a large study area, reflecting the feasibility of the experimental design of this study.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2843 25 of 28"

Land subsidence was predicted by modeling land subsidence and environmental factor data. The conclusions are described as follows.\n(1) Henan Province has undergone significant deformation in the past two years. From November 2019 to February 2022, the maximum and minimum land deformation rates in Henan Province were \u221294.54 mm/a and 41.23 mm/a, respectively. The most severe land subsidence occurred in Shangqiu city, and the maximum cumulative subsidence was \u2212194.78 mm. (2) Land subsidence in the study area has obvious seasonal characteristics. The semiannual average rate of land subsidence in the study area is greater in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. The effect of precipitation on land subsidence has a certain hysteresis, and abundant precipitation in spring and summer can replenish the lower groundwater and delay land subsidence in autumn and winter. The volumetric soil layer water content shows the same trend as land subsidence. (3) The LSTM-TCN model can combine the advantages of the LSTM and TCN models, which is better for exploring the nonlinear characteristics of land subsidence. Specifically, the LSTM-TCN model could effectively predict the cumulative land subsidence in Henan Province, and its prediction accuracy was better than that of the LSTM and TCN models in areas with obvious subsidence. When predicting the area with subsidence exceeding 100 mm, the MAE of the LSTM-TCN model was 1.97 mm, which was 68.35% and 63.98% higher than the 6.23 mm value of the LSTM model and the 5.48 mm value of the TCN model, respectively. (4) After introducing the environmental impact factors in the prediction model, the determination coefficient R2 of the LSTM-TCN model increased from 0.95 to 0.99, indicating that environmental factors and geological characteristics are indispensable in exploring land subsidence.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.G. and Y.Y.; methodology, J.W.; validation, R.Z., Q.C., J.L. and W.D.; formal analysis, B.Q.; investigation and resources and data curation, J.C.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, H.G. and Y.Y.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.Z.; visualization, H.B.; supervision and project administration, S.Z.; funding acquisition, H.G.
