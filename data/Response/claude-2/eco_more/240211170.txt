 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study on reward distribution as more validators join the network over time. As the paper notes, the average reward per validator is decreasing as more validators join. It would be interesting to model how this trend progresses and whether it leads to greater or less equality in rewards.

2. Compare reward distribution inequality metrics between Ethereum 2.0 and other major proof-of-stake blockchains like Cardano and Solana. This could reveal insights into how design choices affect decentralization.

3. Investigate the relationship between validator reward distribution and security measures like slashing rates. Unequal rewards may incentivize certain validator behaviors that impact security.

4. Build predictive models to forecast impacts of changes to reward parameters or mechanisms on the inequality metrics. This could help inform protocol design to optimize decentralization.

5. Analyze geographic distribution of validators and how this correlates to reward distribution. Having validator power concentrated in certain regions may influence decentralization.
