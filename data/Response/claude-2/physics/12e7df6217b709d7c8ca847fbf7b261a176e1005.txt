 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on ammonium-based protic ionic liquids (APILs) for CO2 absorption:

1. Test the recyclability and reusability of the APILs over multiple cycles to better understand their long-term stability and performance. The paper only conducted a single cycle recyclability test. 

2. Explore lower energy recycling methods for the APILs, such as pressure, thermal or electric swing, instead of using high energy vacuum systems. This could improve the economic feasibility.

3. Modify the APIL structures, for example by adding other functional groups, to try to increase the CO2 absorption capacity and optimize their performance.

4. Conduct pilot scale testing of using the APILs for CO2 capture from flue gas streams to evaluate their real-world feasibility and process design needs.

5. Evaluate the APILs for selective CO2 capture from gas mixtures, such as natural gas sweetening, to expand their potential applications beyond flue gas capture. Test their selectivity for CO2 over other gases.
