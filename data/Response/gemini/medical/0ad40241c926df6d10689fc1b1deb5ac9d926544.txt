1. **Investigate the role of social media in shaping tourists' self-identity and moral norms related to waste sorting.** How do social media platforms influence tourists' perceptions of themselves as waste sorters and their sense of moral obligation to dispose of waste properly?


2. **Explore the impact of destination characteristics on tourists' waste sorting intentions.** Do certain destination attributes, such as the availability of recycling facilities, the presence of environmental education programs, or the level of local community involvement in waste management, influence tourists' willingness to sort waste?


3. **Examine the moderating role of cultural values in the relationship between self-identity, moral norms, and waste sorting intentions.** Do cultural values, such as individualism, collectivism, or environmentalism, influence the strength of the relationship between tourists' self-identity, moral norms, and their intentions to sort waste?


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of waste sorting interventions on tourists' behavior and environmental attitudes.** Do interventions aimed at promoting waste sorting among tourists have lasting effects on their behavior and attitudes towards waste management, even after they return home?


5. **Develop and evaluate innovative waste sorting technologies and practices that cater to the needs and preferences of tourists.** Can new technologies, such as smart bins or mobile apps, make waste sorting more convenient and appealing to tourists, thereby increasing their participation in waste sorting programs?
