ABSTRACT Introduction Periodontal health is becoming a recognised component in managing gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is characterised as raised blood glucose levels first discovered in pregnancy and managed similarly to type 2 diabetes. Currently, the standard intervention for gestational diabetes in the UK entails dietary modifications and physical activity interventions. However, considering the literature discussed in this review, it is argued that oral health advice and support should also become an integrated part of gestational diabetes management. Objective The objective of this scoping review is to map out psychologically informed oral health interventions in pregnancy and type 2 diabetes. This will inform the development of a new behavioural intervention to promote oral healthrelated behaviours in women with gestational diabetes. As no literature exists on oral health interventions in gestational diabetes, it was deemed appropriate to synthesise the evidence on oral health interventions designed for pregnant women and individuals with type 2 diabetes. Methodology The scoping review will be conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute\u2019s methodology for scoping reviews. Studies including pregnant women and individuals with type 2 diabetes over 18 years of age will be included. Only studies including a psychologically informed oral health intervention will be considered. The authors will consider experimental and quasiexperimental research designs. The Ovid Interface including EMBASE, Medline, Global Health, APA PsychInfo, Health Management Information, Maternity, Infant Care Database and the Cochrane Library will be used as information sources. The planned searches will commence on the week of the 25 July 2022. Only articles in Danish and English will be considered. The study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Scoping Reviews process. The data will be presented using narrative synthesis. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is needed for this review. The results will be published in a relevant scientific journal.",

Published by BMJ.\nINTRODUCTION Periodontal disease (PD) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the periodontium1 caused by biofilm bacteria.2 It can be grouped into gingivitis (inflammation of the gums) and periodontitis, which is the advanced form\nof gum disease with destruction of the periodontal tissues, bone and tooth supporting tissues.2 PD affects approximately 45% of the adult British population2 and 20%\u201350% of the global population.3 A recent surveillance study4 used data from the WHO\u2019s data bank5 and found that Belarus (76%), Germany (73%) and Nepal (64%) were the countries with the highest prevalence of PD among adults, while approximately half of the adult populations in Poland, Malaysia, Libya, Taiwan and Iran had PD. A review conducted on patient perceptions in dentistry found that fear of pain was a significant barrier to dental- seeking behaviour which may explain the high prevalence of PD.6\nPD is associated with gradual tooth loss and loose teeth, bad breath, pocket formation in the periodontium, receding and bleeding gums, and tooth exfoliation. PD may cause poor food uptake, leading to vitamin and nutritional deficiencies.7 It may also negatively affect the individuals\u2019 quality of life as demonstrated in a recent systematic review.8 Treatment of PD involves removal of gingival bacterial plaque performed by the dental team, and surgery to remove deep residing bacterial plaque in periodontal lesions is regularly needed.9 It is the patient\u2019s responsibility to undertake daily, rigorous oral hygiene behaviours to maintain what the dental team has achieved.3\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 The search strategies were developed with a librarian ensuring comprehensiveness. \u21d2 This review will not assess the risk of bias or publication bias. \u21d2 The language eligibility criteria may exclude relevant studies.\n(IIT P atna).

While it is recommended to brush teeth two times a day to maintain good oral health, a recent survey suggested that 29% of British people brushed their teeth once per day, while 2% stated that they do not brush at all.2 This is of concern given the severe consequences PD can have for the individual\u2019s health and quality of life. However, it appears that tooth brushing frequency has increased in other countries. Research shows that the prevalence of more- thanonce- a- day tooth brushing has increased in countries such as Russia, Norway and Belgium from 1994 to 2010,11 suggesting a shift in the right direction concerning oral health behaviours.\nThere is substantial evidence to suggest that psychologically informed interventions to improve health behaviours are effective.10 For example, in a systematic review conducted on psychologically informed interventions for oral health behaviour, it was found that interventions incorporating planning of the behaviour, goal setting (eg, brushing two times per day) and behaviour monitoring were effective in changing behaviour. Interventions with a feedback component were furthermore effective in inducing oral health behaviours.10 Another systematic review demonstrated that psychologically informed interventions versus educational interventions were superior in reducing plaque index, while psychologically informed interventions were significantly better in promoting oral health behaviours and increasing selfefficacy in tooth brushing compared with other types of interventions.12 Psychologically driven interventions targeting oral health are therefore necessary to improve oral health behaviours and the oral health status among the general population."

            "heading": "Gestational diabetes mellitus",
            "text": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterised as raised blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) with first onset in pregnancy.13 The cause of hyperglycaemia is the body\u2019s inability to effectively use or produce enough of the hormone insulin which is responsible for carrying glucose from food into the body\u2019s cells.13 Blood glucose levels often return to normal after delivery, making GDM a temporary condition only encountered in pregnancy.13 GDM affects approximately 15% of the global population,13 and four to five women in 100 of the British population will develop GDM.14 It also accounts for ~80% of pregnancy complications today.13 Older age (>35 years), overweight and obesity, diabetes in the immediate family, infants with large birth weight (>4 kg), higher number of births (fetuses >24 weeks), previous history of GDM and previous perinatal complications are risk factors for GDM development.15 Management of GDM includes dietary\nchanges, increase in physical activity and blood glucose monitoring.13 16\nGDM is associated with adverse outcomes both for the mother and the infant. For the mother, some of the adverse outcomes include hypertension, antepartum and postpartum haemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes13 17 and a sevenfold increased risk of future type 2 diabetes (T2D) development.13 18 GDM also has adverse outcomes for the fetus including large birth weight, hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels), shoulder injury during delivery, nerve damage and stillbirth.13 19\nEmerging literature suggests that periodontal health has multidirectional relationships with systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus (DM),20\u201324 and more recently GDM.25 26 Poor periodontal health has also been implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes.27\u201332 Yet, to date, no evidence on what oral health support women with GDM receive exists. In light of the following discussions of the multidirectional relationships between periodontal health, GDM and pregnancy, it is argued that oral health support should be an essential component in managing GDM.\nPeriodontal health, gestational diabetes and pregnancy Normoglycaemic pregnancies are associated with compromised oral health due to the hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy, with oestrogen levels increasing 30- fold and progesterone levels increasing 10- fold when compared with hormonal levels in the non- pregnant female population.33 34 The literature further suggests a bi- directional relationship between periodontal health and GDM. Citing GDM as a risk factor for PD, one study reported that women with GDM had a higher prevalence of PD compared with pregnant women without GDM (77.4% vs 57.5%), after controlling for confounding factors (OR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.1 to 6.1).25 Concerning poor oral health as a risk factor for GDM development, random- effects meta- analysis of 5724 participants found that baseline PD was associated with an increased risk of GDM development by 66% (OR=1.66, 95% CI: 1.17 to 2.36).26\nPD in pregnancy is moreover independently associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes27 30 32 35 including low birth weight and pre- term birth, but this association is impacted by PD case definition.31 Case definition refers to the different methods of assessing PD.31 There are currently no uniform criteria to define PD, and to assess the extent and severity of it.31 This has led to inconsistent findings across studies on the association between PD and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, the significance of the relationship between PD and adverse pregnancy outcomes depends on the definition used to assess PD.31\nType 2 diabetes and oral health Like GDM, T2D is a metabolic disease characterised by hyperglycaemia.13 T2D affects ~7% of the British population and 462 million people globally, making it one of\n(IIT P atna).

Risk factors for T2D include age, family history of diabetes and overweight and obesity. T2D management is like interventions seen in GDM and include lifestyle changes, blood glucose monitoring and eventually medication as the disease progresses.13 As observed in women with GDM, emerging evidence suggests a bi- directional relationship between oral health and T2D. For example, one study found that PD is more prevalent in individuals with T2D compared with diabetes- free controls (23.8% vs 19.5%, OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.45),21 and recent crosssectional evidence suggested that 95.1% of individuals with T2D had some periodontal destruction.36 Baseline PD has furthermore been found to be an independent risk for incident T2D two decades later in 9296 T2D- free individuals at baseline, after controlling for diabetesrelevant factors such as body mass index (OR=2.26, 95% CI: 1.56 to 3.27).24\nSystemic link between periodontal disease, gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes PD produces an inflammatory host- response characterised by dysregulated secretion of host- derived inflammation such as IL- 1\u03b2, an interleukin- 1 made by the white cell count, macrophage, which helps the lymphocyte (another type of white cell count) fight infection.37 The level of inflammation is dependent on the genetic, environmental and epigenetic factors of the host.37 In animal studies, it has been suggested that inflammatory responses caused by PD may disseminate systemically to the foetalplacenta unit via blood circulation and cause adverse pregnancy outcomes.38 39 For example, in one study, pregnant hamsters were injected with a periodontal pathogen and had PD induced in another study. Results from both studies indicated a significant reduction in growth for the fetuses,38 39 suggesting the importance of good oral health in promoting healthy pregnancies and fetus outcomes. Bacteria from PD may also enter the bloodstream and spread systemically into the body and affect metabolic control in diabetes, and periodontal therapy has been shown to improve HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin is a form of haemoglobin that is chemically linked to a sugar and is used to help diagnose and monitor diabetes (retrieved from www.diabetes.org.uk)).40 Successful periodontal therapy leading to improvements in periodontal status can also change metabolic status and cardiovascular (CV) markers and signs.24 41\nConcerning the systemic link between PD and T2D, evidence suggests a two- way relationship.20 42 For example, it was demonstrated that severe PD at baseline was linked with poor glycaemic control in T2D at a 2- year follow- up,43 while non- oral diabetes- related complications such as CV complications were linked with severe PD.22 44\u201346 T2D is also associated with increased markers of inflammation which is associated with CV complications.47 Moreover, it is evident that systemic inflammation can contribute to hyperglycaemia by impacting the insulin\u2019s ability to transport glucose into cells.48"

            "text": "The prevention and treatment of PD is a collaboration between the dental team and the patient. However, the maintenance of good oral health relies on the patients\u2019 ability to undertake daily oral hygiene behaviours.10 Given the high prevalence of PD globally,3 evidence suggests that the general population is not undertaking the recommended oral hygiene behaviours. Nevertheless, substantial evidence suggests that psychologically informed interventions are effective in inducing oral health behaviours10 49 50 and can therefore be used as an effective mean to improve oral health behaviours and oral health status in the general population.\nIt has furthermore been established that GDM independently poses adverse risks to the mother and infant,13 51 and that PD independently predicts adverse pregnancy outcomes.27 30 31 35 PD is also associated with GDM development as demonstrated in meta- analysis,26 while PD is more prevalent in women with GDM, compared with pregnant women with normoglyacemia,25 and in people with T2D compared with diabetes- free individuals.52 Online supplemental figure 1 describes the multidirectional relationships between PD, GDM, T2D and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nAchieving normoglycaemia through self- management behaviours is the foremost important strategy to effectively manage GDM and T2D.13 However, PD negatively affects glycaemic control in diabetes.20 This, therefore, highlights the need for oral health interventions for women with GDM to ensure healthy pregnancies and outcomes for the mother and infant. The effective management of hyperglycaemia in GDM also decreases the risk of later T2D development for the mother.13 Dietary modifications and physical activity interventions are standard care for GDM management today in the UK.13 However, given the presented introductory evidence, it is argued that oral health advice and support should form part of standard GDM management. As no evidence currently exists on oral health interventions in GDM, and given the similar aetiology between GDM and T2D,13 and the availability of literature on oral health interventions in pregnancy53 and T2D,54 a scoping review was deemed appropriate to map out the existing literature on this topic."

A minimum age of 18 years has been selected as first- time mothers in the UK are 28.9 years on average,59 and recent data from the USA suggest an average age of 30.7 years for first- time Asian mothers, 27.8 years for first- time Caucasian mothers and 27.9 years for first- time Hispanic mothers, respectively. The likelihood of identifying oral health interventions designed for teenage mothers is therefore relatively low. Moreover, individuals under the age of 18 who are pregnant may be considered a high- risk population to recruit for research purposes resulting in limited available literature.\nStudies with individuals over 18 years of age with a medically or self- reported diagnosis of T2D will be considered for synthesis. A self- reported diagnosis was deemed\neligible as evidence suggests that self- reported history of a doctor diagnosis of a medical condition is a valid measure of a medical diagnosis.60 The average age of onset for T2D is ~45 years of age,13 thus, the likelihood of identifying studies including individuals under the age of 18 years of age with T2D is unlikely. Studies including individuals with T2D, and common comorbidities associated with T2D such as hypertension, depression, obesity and CV disease61 will be considered. Studies including participants who are new to insulin or who have been administering insulin for a longer period will be included. Studies with individuals who have non- insulin dependent T2D will also be considered. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, no literature on oral health interventions and GDM exists; however, if literature on said topic is identified through searches, participants with medically confirmed diagnoses of GDM will also be considered.\nLower socioeconomic status,62 educational level and ethnicity63 are risk factors associated with poor oral health. Therefore, all demographic factors such as ethnicity, race and education level will be considered for inclusion, as the objective of this review is to examine oral health interventions in the pregnant and diabetic populations as a general, rather than supgroups within these populations.

Studies including outcomes such as self- reported and/or observed oral health behaviours including tooth brushing, interdental cleaning, oral health knowledge, self- efficacy, attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions about oral\n(IIT P atna).

CK further emailed the main author from the Vamos et al53 systematic review on oral health interventions in pregnancy to request their search strategy as this was not readily available online. The outcome of this email will be addressed in the scoping review.\nThe search terms were derived from four categories: oral health, intervention, pregnancy and T2D. The reference lists of included literature will be sought for additional studies to ensure a comprehensive search. Studies published in Danish and English will be included as these are the language abilities of the authors. No resources are available for the utilisation of professional translational services of studies published in other languages as this review is part of a PhD project with limited funds. There is no limitation to the dates of the studies considered for this review."

The Cochrane Library will be sought for any relevant systematic reviews. The EU Clinical Trials Register (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/) and the OpenGrey database will be searched to identify grey and/ or unpublished literature.\nData management and study selection Following the searches, all identified studies will be collated and uploaded to Covidence. Two independent researchers (CK and KA) will screen identified sources against the inclusion criteria summarised in online supplemental table 1.\nThe study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews with Meta- analysis process (online supplemental figure 3).65 The first phase is Identification and involves collating and counting all identified citations from each of the searches (CK only). In the second phase (Screening), CK will remove the duplicate citations using the \u2018de- duplicate\u2019 function in Covidence. Phase three (Eligibility) involves assessing the identified citations against the inclusion criteria (CK and KA). The screening will initially be based on the title and abstract of the source, and if eligible, the full text of the source will be assessed (CK and KA). Any disagreements will be resolved with discussions between the independent reviewers. If consensus cannot be reached, a third independent person, MI, will help resolve the disagreement. Online supplemental table 2 will be populated with the studies that were deemed eligible based on the title and abstract screening."

The data extraction tool was developed based on JBI guidelines and recommendations and was designed to extract information relating to the research objectives.65 (online supplemental table 3). Therefore, the data extraction tool will extract information involving details of the study methodology and study participants, theoretical basis for the intervention, behaviours targeted in the intervention and the extent to which these behaviours map on to the COM- B model56 and the TDF, and who (ie, healthcare professional) delivered the intervention. The extraction tool will be modified as necessary during the data extraction process if CK and/or KA find this necessary to achieve the objectives of the scoping review. Any modifications and deviations from this protocol will be clearly addressed in the scoping review.\n(IIT P atna).
