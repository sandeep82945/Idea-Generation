In contrast, many positive-strand RNA virus genomes lack a 5\u2032cap and promote translation by noncanonical mechanisms. Among plant viruses, PTEs are a major class of cap-independent translation enhancers located in/near the 3\u2032UTR that recruit eIF4E to greatly enhance viral translation. Previous work proposed a single form of PTE characterized by a Yshaped secondary structure with two terminal stemloops (SL1 and SL2) atop a supporting stem containing a large, G-rich asymmetric loop that forms an essential pseudoknot (PK) involving C/U residues located between SL1 and SL2. We found that PTEs with less than three consecutive cytidylates available for PK formation have an upstream stem-loop that forms a kissing loop interaction with the apical loop of SL2, important for formation/stabilization of PK. PKs found in both subclasses of PTE assume a specific conformation with a hyperreactive guanylate (G*) in SHAPE structure probing, previously found critical for binding eIF4E. While PTE PKs were proposed to be formed by Watson\u2013Crick base-pairing, alternative chemical probing and 3D modeling indicate that the Watson\u2013Crick faces of G* and an adjacent guanylate have high solvent accessibilities. Thus, PTE PKs are likely composed primarily of non-canonical interactions. INTRODUCTION Eukaryotic mRNAs typically contain a 5\u2032m7GpppN cap and a 3\u2032poly(A) tail that function to attract translation initiation factors and ribosomes to the 5\u2032end of the template. Canonical translation begins with recognition of the 5\u2032cap by initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and association of poly(A)binding protein with the poly(A) tail. These initiation factors bind to the core scaffolding protein eIF4G to form part of the eIF4F initiation factor complex that bridges the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032ends of the mRNA (1,2) to facilitate recycling of ribosomes (3,4). The 43S ribosome preinitiation complex, composed of the 40S ribosomal subunit and ternary complex (Met-tRNA, eIF2 and GTP), is then recruited to the 5\u2032end of the mRNA, scans the transcript in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction until encountering a start codon in a favorable context, recruits the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S ribosome, and translation initiates after an amino-acylated tRNA enters the ribosome A-site. Positive-strand (+)RNA viruses have genomes that directly serve as templates for the host translation machinery upon cell entry. Many (+)RNA viruses lack a 5\u2032cap and 3\u2032poly(A) tail to differentiate their templates from host mRNAs, and thus must recruit the translational machinery by non-canonical mechanisms (5,6). To promote efficient translation, the genomes of these (+)RNA viruses form higher order structures that recruit all or a subset of the host translation machinery (e.g. eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4F, ribosomal subunits). Many such structures have been identified at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032ends of plant and animal (+)RNA viral genomes, and understanding their mode of action has led to the elucidation of non-canonical mechanisms of viral gene regulation at the level of translation. A high prevalence of related non-canonical mechanisms that regulate translation of a subset of host mRNAs has also been revealed by transcriptome-wide studies (7). Plant (+)RNA viruses that lack a 5\u2032cap and 3\u2032poly(A) tail generally contain structures promoting translation in the 3\u2032 region of their genome, which are termed 3\u2032cap-independent translation enhancers or 3\u2032CITEs (8,9). 3\u2032CITEs are classified by their secondary structures, threedimensional (3D) shapes, conserved RNA motifs, and translation factor(s) with which they interact.

The three subclasses of BTEs have different numbers of additional stem-loops atop a base-paired stem, as well as other general and class-specific motifs and conserved structural features uncovered by a recent analysis (13). In contrast, other types of 3\u2032CITEs, such as the T-shaped structure (TSS) found in members of the carmovirus and umbravirus genera within the Tombusviridae, lack conserved motifs but contain conserved structural elements (three hairpins and two pseudoknots). These elements fold into a tRNA-like 3D shape that binds to 60S ribosomal subunits or 80S ribosomes by occupying the Psite (14\u201316). Most 3\u2032CITEs deliver bound translation factors/complexes to the 5\u2032end of the viral genome via long-distance base-pairing between a 5\u2032 proximal hairpin and a hairpin within or proximal to the 3\u2032CITE (9). The 3\u2032 hairpins that participate in these long-distance RNA:RNA interactions in carmoviruses and umbraviruses commonly contain the motif 5\u2032UGCCA or its complement (5\u2032UGGCA) in their apical loops. For a minority of 3\u2032CITEs, long-distance base-pairings are not discernible, suggesting that alternative mechanisms are required to position the 3\u2032CITE near the 5\u2032end (9,17). In addition to structural diversity among different 3\u2032CITEs, there are also subclasses of particular 3\u2032CITEs. For example, BTEs were recently divided into three subclasses based on their number of terminal SLs and other conserved features (13). Nearly all reports have examined BTEs in the subclass with three terminal SLs, which has left the other two subclasses and their unique functional and structural elements to be characterized. There is also a lack of information about the structure and function of 3\u2032CITEs in situ (i.e. within the full-length viral genomic RNA or subgenomic RNA), as nearly all reports involve the study of 3\u2032CITE fragments with the assumption that they contain the complete functional enhancer. However, elements associated with 3\u2032CITE function and/or regulation can be located outside of the region included in these fragments, as was recently shown for the BTE of umbravirus tobacco bushy top virus (18). A number of 3\u2032CITEs are also located adjacent to coding sequence, if not partly within coding sequence, such as the translation enhancer domain (TED) of satellite tobacco necrosis virus (19,20). However, most studies analyzing 3\u2032CITE function use reporter constructs containing only the 3\u2032UTR and thus any elements residing in the adjacent upstream coding sequence would be overlooked. Panicum mosaic virus-like translation enhancers (PTEs) are a major class of 3\u2032CITE that bind strongly to the capbinding initiation factor eIF4E (21\u201323). PTEs across genera in the Tombusviridae have been subjected to extensive investigation over the past 15 years including chemical RNA structure probing, mutational analyses, eIF4E binding, and involvement in viral translation in vitro and in vivo (21\u201325). Structurally, all PTEs have a Y-shaped secondary structure consisting of a three-way junction with two upper SLs (SL1 and SL2) atop a supporting stem of 6\u20137 bp, followed by a large, G-rich asymmetric loop and a lower supporting stem of different sizes (Figure 1C). Sequential guanylates (usually 3\u20134) within the asymmetric loop participate in a pseudoknot (PK) involving C/U-rich residues between SL1 and SL2. This PK is proposed as a common feature of all PTEs and is critical for binding to eIF4E, which correlates with efficient enhancement of viral translation (21,22). Additionally, most PTEs contain 5\u2032UGCCA, or a close variant, in the apical loop of SL1 that engages in the long-distance base-pairing with the apical loop of a 5\u2032 proximal hairpin or other unpaired sequence (24). An exception is the PTE of pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2; umbravirus), which uses a hairpin in a neighboring structure (known as the klTSS) to connect with a 5\u2032 proximal, coding region hairpin (26). A key feature of all PTEs is the presence of a particular guanylate within the G-rich asymmetric loop that is hyperreactive to SHAPE (selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) structure probing reagents. SHAPE is a standard technique for helping to determine the structure of RNA molecules, and involves reacting the folded RNA with a modifying reagent (e.g. NMIA, 1M7) that acylates the 2\u2032-hydroxyls of residues independent of their nitrogenous base identity (27). Reverse transcription stalls in the RNA template at the residue immediately 3\u2032 to the residue that is modified by NMIA. Paired residues typically have low reactivities with the modifying reagent and unpaired residues have high reactivities, allowing the putative structure of an RNA molecule to be inferred. Hyperreactivity of a critical guanylate in SHAPE probing of isolated PTE fragments correlated with formation of the PK and ability to enhance translation (21,22). Footprinting of PTE fragments bound to eIF4E also directly implicated the hyperreactive guanylate (denoted here as G*) in eIF4E binding (22). Given the hyperreactivity of G*, it was proposed to be unpaired and highly accessible to the solvent, despite the presence of available cytidylate pairing partners between SL1 and SL2 (22). Previous work focused on PTEs containing PKs with the potential to form three or more G:C pairs, such as the PTE of PEMV2 (Figure 1C). However, nearly half of all known PTEs, particularly those in virus members of the three carmovirus genera, do not have three consecutive cytidylates between SL1 and SL2 and thus have seemingly weaker PKs, usually requiring one or more G:U wobble pairs (22,24) (Figure 1D). In addition, Watson\u2013Crick paired PKs are not discernible for the PTEs of galinsoga mosaic virus (GaMV) and Bermuda grass latent virus (BGLV) (see Figure 2). Little is known about the stability or functionality of PTEs containing these seemingly weak or indiscernible PKs. The possible presence of a third stem loop (SL3) just upstream of many PTEs with seemingly weak PKs was noted for a number of alphacarmoviruses and closely related GaMV, but its involvement, if any, in PTE function was not examined (25). For this report, we have identified a kissing loop (KL) interaction between the apical loops of SL3 and PTE SL2 in alphacarmovirus pelargonium flower break virus (PFBV) that is conserved in nearly all PTEs with upstream SL3, and found that this KL is critical for G* hyperreactivity and thus formation of the PK. Through alternative chemical probing techniques, we found the Watson\u2013 D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /nar/artic3/1601/6519367 by Idian Intitute of Tenology Ptna user on 25 Jauary 2024 Nucleic Acids Research, 2022, Vol. 50, No. 3 1603",

In contrast, many positive-strand RNA virus genomes lack a 5\u2032cap and promote translation by noncanonical mechanisms. Among plant viruses, PTEs are a major class of cap-independent translation enhancers located in/near the 3\u2032UTR that recruit eIF4E to greatly enhance viral translation. Previous work proposed a single form of PTE characterized by a Yshaped secondary structure with two terminal stemloops (SL1 and SL2) atop a supporting stem containing a large, G-rich asymmetric loop that forms an essential pseudoknot (PK) involving C/U residues located between SL1 and SL2.

PKs found in both subclasses of PTE assume a specific conformation with a hyperreactive guanylate (G*) in SHAPE structure probing, previously found critical for binding eIF4E. While PTE PKs were proposed to be formed by Watson\u2013Crick base-pairing, alternative chemical probing and 3D modeling indicate that the Watson\u2013Crick faces of G* and an adjacent guanylate have high solvent accessibilities. Thus, PTE PKs are likely composed primarily of non-canonical interactions."

These initiation factors bind to the core scaffolding protein eIF4G to form part of the eIF4F initiation factor complex that bridges the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032ends of the mRNA (1,2) to facilitate recycling of ribosomes (3,4). The 43S ribosome preinitiation complex, composed of the 40S ribosomal subunit and ternary complex (Met-tRNA, eIF2 and GTP), is then recruited to the 5\u2032end of the mRNA, scans the transcript in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction until encountering a start codon in a favorable context, recruits the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S ribosome, and translation initiates after an amino-acylated tRNA enters the ribosome A-site.\nPositive-strand (+)RNA viruses have genomes that directly serve as templates for the host translation machinery upon cell entry. Many (+)RNA viruses lack a 5\u2032cap and 3\u2032poly(A) tail to differentiate their templates from host mRNAs, and thus must recruit the translational machinery by non-canonical mechanisms (5,6). To promote efficient translation, the genomes of these (+)RNA viruses form higher order structures that recruit all or a subset of the host translation machinery (e.g. eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4F, ribosomal subunits). Many such structures have been identified at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032ends of plant and animal (+)RNA viral genomes, and understanding their mode of action has led to the elucidation of non-canonical mechanisms of viral gene regulation at the level of translation. A high prevalence of related non-canonical mechanisms that regulate translation of a subset of host mRNAs has also been revealed by transcriptome-wide studies (7).\nPlant (+)RNA viruses that lack a 5\u2032cap and 3\u2032poly(A) tail generally contain structures promoting translation in the 3\u2032 region of their genome, which are termed 3\u2032cap-independent translation enhancers or 3\u2032CITEs (8,9). 3\u2032CITEs are classified by their secondary structures, threedimensional (3D) shapes, conserved RNA motifs, and translation factor(s) with which they interact.

The three subclasses of BTEs have different numbers of additional stem-loops atop a base-paired stem, as well as other general and class-specific motifs and conserved structural features uncovered by a recent analysis (13). In contrast, other types of 3\u2032CITEs, such as the T-shaped structure (TSS) found in members of the carmovirus and umbravirus genera within the Tombusviridae, lack conserved motifs but contain conserved structural elements (three hairpins and two pseudoknots). These elements fold into a tRNA-like 3D shape that binds to 60S ribosomal subunits or 80S ribosomes by occupying the Psite (14\u201316).\nMost 3\u2032CITEs deliver bound translation factors/complexes to the 5\u2032end of the viral genome via long-distance base-pairing between a 5\u2032 proximal hairpin and a hairpin within or proximal to the 3\u2032CITE (9). The 3\u2032 hairpins that participate in these long-distance RNA:RNA interactions in carmoviruses and umbraviruses commonly contain the motif 5\u2032UGCCA or its complement (5\u2032UGGCA) in their apical loops. For a minority of 3\u2032CITEs, long-distance base-pairings are not discernible, suggesting that alternative mechanisms are required to position the 3\u2032CITE near the 5\u2032end (9,17).\nIn addition to structural diversity among different 3\u2032CITEs, there are also subclasses of particular 3\u2032CITEs. For example, BTEs were recently divided into three subclasses based on their number of terminal SLs and other conserved features (13). Nearly all reports have examined BTEs in the subclass with three terminal SLs, which has left the other two subclasses and their unique functional and structural elements to be characterized. There is also a lack of information about the structure and function of 3\u2032CITEs in situ (i.e. within the full-length viral genomic RNA or subgenomic RNA), as nearly all reports involve the study of 3\u2032CITE fragments with the assumption that they contain the complete functional enhancer. However, elements associated with 3\u2032CITE function and/or regulation can be located outside of the region included in these fragments, as was recently shown for the BTE of umbravirus tobacco bushy top virus (18). A number of 3\u2032CITEs are also located adjacent to coding sequence, if not partly within coding sequence, such as the translation enhancer domain (TED) of satellite tobacco necrosis virus (19,20). However, most studies analyzing 3\u2032CITE function use reporter constructs containing only the 3\u2032UTR and thus any elements residing in the adjacent upstream coding sequence would be overlooked.\nPanicum mosaic virus-like translation enhancers (PTEs) are a major class of 3\u2032CITE that bind strongly to the capbinding initiation factor eIF4E (21\u201323). PTEs across genera in the Tombusviridae have been subjected to extensive investigation over the past 15 years including chemical RNA structure probing, mutational analyses, eIF4E binding, and involvement in viral translation in vitro and in vivo (21\u201325). Structurally, all PTEs have a Y-shaped secondary structure consisting of a three-way junction with two upper SLs (SL1 and SL2) atop a supporting stem of 6\u20137 bp, followed by a\nlarge, G-rich asymmetric loop and a lower supporting stem of different sizes (Figure 1C). Sequential guanylates (usually 3\u20134) within the asymmetric loop participate in a pseudoknot (PK) involving C/U-rich residues between SL1 and SL2. This PK is proposed as a common feature of all PTEs and is critical for binding to eIF4E, which correlates with efficient enhancement of viral translation (21,22). Additionally, most PTEs contain 5\u2032UGCCA, or a close variant, in the apical loop of SL1 that engages in the long-distance base-pairing with the apical loop of a 5\u2032 proximal hairpin or other unpaired sequence (24). An exception is the PTE of pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2; umbravirus), which uses a hairpin in a neighboring structure (known as the klTSS) to connect with a 5\u2032 proximal, coding region hairpin (26).\nA key feature of all PTEs is the presence of a particular guanylate within the G-rich asymmetric loop that is hyperreactive to SHAPE (selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) structure probing reagents. SHAPE is a standard technique for helping to determine the structure of RNA molecules, and involves reacting the folded RNA with a modifying reagent (e.g. NMIA, 1M7) that acylates the 2\u2032-hydroxyls of residues independent of their nitrogenous base identity (27). Reverse transcription stalls in the RNA template at the residue immediately 3\u2032 to the residue that is modified by NMIA. Paired residues typically have low reactivities with the modifying reagent and unpaired residues have high reactivities, allowing the putative structure of an RNA molecule to be inferred. Hyperreactivity of a critical guanylate in SHAPE probing of isolated PTE fragments correlated with formation of the PK and ability to enhance translation (21,22). Footprinting of PTE fragments bound to eIF4E also directly implicated the hyperreactive guanylate (denoted here as G*) in eIF4E binding (22). Given the hyperreactivity of G*, it was proposed to be unpaired and highly accessible to the solvent, despite the presence of available cytidylate pairing partners between SL1 and SL2 (22).\nPrevious work focused on PTEs containing PKs with the potential to form three or more G:C pairs, such as the PTE of PEMV2 (Figure 1C). However, nearly half of all known PTEs, particularly those in virus members of the three carmovirus genera, do not have three consecutive cytidylates between SL1 and SL2 and thus have seemingly weaker PKs, usually requiring one or more G:U wobble pairs (22,24) (Figure 1D). In addition, Watson\u2013Crick paired PKs are not discernible for the PTEs of galinsoga mosaic virus (GaMV) and Bermuda grass latent virus (BGLV) (see Figure 2). Little is known about the stability or functionality of PTEs containing these seemingly weak or indiscernible PKs.\nThe possible presence of a third stem loop (SL3) just upstream of many PTEs with seemingly weak PKs was noted for a number of alphacarmoviruses and closely related GaMV, but its involvement, if any, in PTE function was not examined (25). For this report, we have identified a kissing loop (KL) interaction between the apical loops of SL3 and PTE SL2 in alphacarmovirus pelargonium flower break virus (PFBV) that is conserved in nearly all PTEs with upstream SL3, and found that this KL is critical for G* hyperreactivity and thus formation of the PK. Through alternative chemical probing techniques, we found the Watson\u2013\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1601/6519367 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nBA\np33 p94 p26\np27 gRNA\nPTE\nkl-TSS 3\u00b4TSS\nC G + - NMIA\n*\ngRNAp27 p86 p37 p7\np12\nPTE\nsgRNA\nVBFP2VMEP\nsgRNA1\nsgRNA2\nDC\nPFBV gRNA\np26\np27\np37 p7 p12\np37\n*\nG U A G A A C\nA C\nG U G G GA\nU A\nG G G G\nA U\nG A C C U U G U C\nG A C C G\nG U U A\nU C G G U C C C C U G C U C C U U C G A G C\nU\nG G C A A G G\nC\nG\nC U C A C\nA G\nG U U C U A C\nPK\nSL2SL1\nPEMV2\nU C U\nA G G C U A U G AG\nA G G G\nC A G\nU C A C C C\nU\nA C C U U\nC U G C C A\nG A G G U U C C\nC G G A G G A\nG U A G U G A\nU C C U U U G G\nG G G U G A U\nU C A U A G C U A G G A\nSL2 SL1\nPK\nPFBV\n*\nWT E\n5\u00b4- - 3\u00b4 5\u00b4- - 3\u00b4\nFigure 1.

Surprisingly, the Watson\u2013Crick face of the guanylate immediately downstream of G* for both the PFBV and PEMV2 PTEs showed even higher accessibility and is also unpaired, suggesting that the PKs of the PFBV and PEMV2 PTEs are composed primarily of non-canonical interactions, in contrast to the model previously proposed for the PEMV2 PTE (22). Our findings show that PTEs with seemingly strong and weak PKs, and with and without a KL, share similar conformations involving their G* and nearby residues that likely play a central role in how PTEs bind to eIF4E."

Just upstream of the PTE is the ribosome-binding kl-TSS 3\u2032CITE that participates in a long-distance interaction with a coding region hairpin near the 5\u2032end of the gRNA (26). In contrast, the PFBV PTE is located at the junction of the p37 coat protein ORF and the 236 nt 3\u2032UTR, with the apical loop of SL1 providing the connecting sequence for the longdistance interaction with a hairpin located at position 94 within the p27 ORF (Figure 1B) (9).

As with SHAPE conducted using the isolated PFBV PTE fragment (22), the PFBV PTE contained the same hyperreactive G* within the asymmetric loop, and the reactivities of other residues were consistent with the previously defined Y-shaped secondary structure. However, unlike SHAPE of isolated fragments, the PTE SL1 loop residues were only weakly reactive, supporting their involvement in long-distance base-pairing in the gRNA.\nPFBV gRNA contains a SL upstream of the previously defined PTE structure that participates in a kissing-loop interaction with SL2\nPTEs with seemingly weak or indiscernible PKs (i.e. fewer than three consecutive cytidylates between SL1 and SL2) are situated downstream from a putative SL shown in a previous publication (25) that is designated here as SL3. In the previous publication, SHAPE probing of full-length alphacarmovirus saguaro cactus virus was consistent with SL3 being present and with both SL3 and the Y-shaped PTE structure positioned atop a lower stem (Figure 2). Examination of SL3 terminal loops revealed diverse sequences that are complementary with sequences in the PTE SL2 apical loops (Figure 2, in orange), suggesting that a KL might connect SL2 with SL3. To investigate if this KL exists for the PFBV PTE and if so, whether it is important for PTE function, SL3 and SL2 loop sequences were mutated such that base-pairing (if present) could reform when both alterations were present (Figure 3A). Wild-type (WT) PFBV gRNA (gPTE-WT) along with mutant constructs gPTESL3sm and gPTE-SL2sm were translated in vitro in wheat germ extracts (WGE), and levels of p27 synthesized were determined (Figure 3B). Translation of gPTE-SL3sm and gPTE-SL2sm was reduced to 33% and 27% of gPTE-WT, respectively, and both mutations together (gPTE-SL3/2sm) restored gRNA translation to 64% of gPTE-WT. This result supports a KL interaction between SL3 and SL2 that enhances the functionality of the PFBV PTE.\nSHAPE structure probing was also conducted for gPTEWT, gPTE-SL3sm, gPTE-SL2sm and gPTE-SL3/2sm (Figure 3C). As also shown in Figure 1E, the SHAPE profile of gPTE-WT indicated that both SL3 and SL2 loop sequences had weak NMIA reactivity, suggesting that these residues were not single-stranded. In contrast, the SHAPE profiles of gPTE-SL3sm and gPTE-SL2sm displayed an average of 6.3- to 12.3-fold increases in reactivities of residues in the SL loop containing the mutation and in the loop of the proposed KL partner sequence, supporting the existence of a KL between these residues (Figure 3C). Hyperreactivity of G* was also reduced for gPTE-SL3sm and gPTE-SL2sm by 7.1- and 5.0-fold, respectively, suggesting that the KL is important for formation/stabilization of an active PTE structure. The SHAPE profile for the compensatory gPTESL3/2sm mutant revealed partial restoration of G* reactivity (2.7- to 3.86-fold higher than for gPTE-SL3sm and\ngPTE-SL2sm) but only a slight reduction, if any, in the reactivity of the two loop sequences, suggesting that the KL was not reforming efficiently. One possibility for lack of efficient SHAPE complementation was if one or both of the altered loop sequences had established unintentional off-target pairing, such as may have occurred between the SL2sm loop and the 3\u2032 side of the SL2 stem, which is consistent with enhanced reactivity of residues on the 5\u2032 side of the SL2 stem (Figure 3C, Supplemental Figure S1, red line).\nWhen PTE fragments are added in trans to in vitro translation reactions, they inhibit translation by sequestering eIF4E in the reaction mixture (21). To determine if SL3 and SL2 mutations interfere with eIF4E sequestration, WT and mutant PFBV PTE fragments (PTE-WT, PTE-SL3sm, PTE-SL2sm, PTE-SL3/2sm) were added to WGE along with PFBV gRNA template (Figure 3D). Forty-fold molar excess of the PTE-WT fragment inhibited gRNA translation by 90%, whereas the same molar excess of PTE-SL3sm and PTE-SL2sm inhibited translation by 48% and 56%, respectively. When the compensatory PTE-SL3/2sm was added, translation inhibition increased to 64%. Altogether, these results suggest that the PFBV PTE contains a KL that is necessary for efficient function and that the KL is required for hyperreactivity of G* in SHAPE probing.\nThe PFBV PTE contains a PK along with the KL\nPrevious studies found that hyperreactivity of G* correlated with formation of the PK between the G-rich asymmetric loop and C/U-rich sequence between SL1 and SL2 in several viruses including PEMV2 (21,22). As described above, hyperreactivity of G* was significantly reduced when the KL was disrupted. This could occur if the KL is required for efficient formation/stabilization of the PK, or alternatively, the KL might replace the PK in the structure of these PTE. To distinguish between the two possibilities, the single cytidylate between SL1 and SL2 was altered to an adenylate in the PFBV gRNA that should reduce or eliminate formation of a potential PK. Additionally, to prevent possible usage of the adjacent downstream cytidylates (that likely pair with guanylates at the base of SL2), the terminal base-pair of SL2 was changed from a C:G to an A:U, altogether generating construct gPTE-Cm (Figure 4A). When subjected to translation in WGE, gPTE-Cm was a weaker template than gPTE-SL2sm, generating only 10% of the p27 levels produced using gPTE-WT (Figure 4B). When a PTE fragment containing the Cm mutations (PTE-Cm) was added in trans to WGE, translation of the PFBV gRNA template was only reduced 9% compared to 90% reduction by a fragment containing the WT PTE (PTE-WT; Figure 4C). These results corroborate previous work demonstrating the importance of the PK for PTE activity (21,22). SHAPE probing of gPTE-Cm showed increased reactivity of the residues located between SL1 and SL2, and reduced hyperreactivity of G* (Figure 4D), consistent with the WT PFBV PTE containing a PK in the context of full-length gRNA. In addition, the gPTE-Cm SHAPE profile showed increased reactivities for SL3 and SL2 loop residues, strongly suggesting that the KL is also disrupted when the PK does not form in the gRNA. However, when SHAPE was used to probe the PTE-Cm fragment (Figure 4E), reactivities of residues\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1601/6519367 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n*\nCA\nC G + - + - + - + - WT SL3sm SL2sm SL3/2sm\nD\n- - p86\n- p37 - p27\n100 32.6 \u00b16.0 26.9 \u00b15.2 63.7 \u00b14.9 p27: (N=3)\n- - p86\n- p37 - p27\np27: (N=3)\ngRNA\nIn Trans\n+ + + + +\n100 10.2 \u00b12.8 48.1 \u00b14.3 56.3 \u00b13.0 35.8 \u00b12.6\nNMIA\nB\n*\n- -\nU C C A A C\nA C U U C\nA A C C\nG C\nU G C C\nC C U U C\nG U C A C U\nG G A G\nU G G U A U G U A U C U\nA G G C U A U G AG\nA G G G\nC A G\nU C A C C C\nU\nA C C U U\nC U G C C A\nG A G G U U C C\nC G G A G G A\nG U A G U G A\nU C C U U U G G\nG G G U G A U\nU C A U A G C U A G G A\nA A\nG G U\nC G G A G\nA G U U G G G\nSL3\nSL2 SL1\nPK\nKL\nG U C C U U\n[SL3sm]\nG U A A G G A\n[SL2sm]\n* * *\n5\u00b4- - 3\u00b4\nG*\nSL3 Loop\n100\n100 1230\u00b1894 930 \u00b1672\n14\u00b15 20\u00b16\nSL2 Loop100 631\u00b190 862 \u00b160\n1015 \u00b1792\n54\u00b13\n652 \u00b184\n(N=3)\nWT SL 3sm SL 2sm SL 3/2\nsm\nWT SL 3sm SL 2sm SL 3/2\nsm\nFigure 3.

See legend to Figure 1E for details.\nin the loops of SL3 and SL2 remained low, suggesting that in the absence of other viral sequences, the KL remained stable when the PK was disrupted. G* hyperreactivity was also reduced in PTE-Cm, and reactivities of residues in the spacer between SL1 and SL2 increased, consistent with disruption of the PK in the fragment. Altogether, these results support a PFBV PTE structure that contains both the PK and the KL.\nTo determine if increasing the number of cytidylates between SL1 and SL2 in the PFBV PTE obviates the need for the KL by allowing a seemingly stronger PK to form, the pairing partners for the two cytidylates at the base of SL2 were changed from guanylates to adenylates and the stability of SL2 (in the absence of these two base-pairs) was increased by converting a G:U to a G:C in the stem (gPTE-wcPKm; Figure 5A). These alterations should result\nin three consecutive cytidylates (5\u2032UCCC) between SL1 and SL2 being available for PK pairing, similar to the 5\u2032CCCU found between SL1 and SL2 in the PEMV2 PTE and other PTEs that lack a discernible SL3. SHAPE probing of gPTEwcPKm indicated that these alterations eliminated the hyperreactive G* and increased reactivity of the sequence between SL1 and SL2 (Figure 5B), suggesting that the PK did not form effectively. Addition of the KL-disrupting SL3sm mutation to gPTE-wcPKm did not lead to a restoration of G*, indicating that the presence of a KL was not preventing the PK from forming. Altogether, these results suggest that for PTEs with seemingly weak PKs (i.e. fewer than three consecutive cytidylates between SL1 and SL2): (i) Both the PK and the KL exist; (ii) the KL appears necessary for efficient formation/stabilization of the PK and (iii) the KL can form in the absence of the PK in isolated PTE fragments.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/3/1601/6519367 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n*\nC G + - WT SL3sm wcPKm\nwcPKm/ SL3sm\nNMIA\n*\n+ - + - + -\nBA\nU C C A A C\nA C U U C\nA A C C\nG C\nU G C C\nC C U U C\nG U C A C U\nG G A G\nU G G U A U G U A U C U\nA G G C U A U G AG\nA G G G\nC A G\nU C A C C C\nU\nA C C U U\nC U G C C A\nG A G G U U C C\nC G G A G G A\nG U A G U G A\nU C C U U U G G\nG G G U G A U\nU C A U A G C U\nA G G A\nA A\nG G U\nC G G A G\nA G U U G G G\nSL3\nSL2 SL1\nPK\nKL\nG U C C U U\n[SL3sm]\nC C G G A U C U A A\n[wcPKm]\n* * *\n5\u00b4- - 3\u00b4\nFigure 5.

(B) SHAPE probing of the PTE region in PFBV gRNA.\nMg2+ is not critical for PTE folding in the PFBV gRNA\nComplexing with Mg2+ often significantly promotes RNA folding by supporting the formation of tertiary interactions such as PKs and KLs. It was previously determined that Mg2+ was required for correct folding of a PFBV PTE fragment, as determined by complete loss of the hyperreactive G* when Mg2+ was absent from the folding buffer (22). Although SL3 was not identified in this study, the fragment used in this report contained SL3 and several base-pairs in the lower stem (see Figure 2, top left, arrows). To test if Mg2+ is also required for proper folding of the PFBV PTE within the full-length gRNA, gPTE-WT was subjected to folding in normal folding buffer [(+)Mg2+] and in folding buffer without Mg2+ to which 10 mM EDTA was also added to sequester any Mg2+ carried over from synthesis of the RNA [(\u2013)Mg2+]. SHAPE probing of gPTE-WT in the absence of Mg2+ revealed that the reactivities of SL1 loop residues increased markedly (Figure 6A; see also Supplemental Figure S2 for three replicate gels), suggesting that the long-distance interaction with the 5\u2032end is disrupted in the absence of Mg2+. In contrast with the previous study\nusing isolated PTE fragments (22), gPTE-WT G* retained most of its hyperreactivity (79%) in the absence of Mg2+ (Figure 6A), whereas direct disruption of the PK (gPTECm) in the absence of Mg2+ reduced G* by an additional 3.6-fold (Figure 6B; see Supplemental Figure S3 for the three replicate gels). Similarly, lack of Mg2+ increased reactivities of residues in the loops of SL3 and SL2 by 4.1- and 8.9-fold, respectively (Figure 6A), while direct disruption of the KL (gPTE-SL2sm) in the absence of Mg2+ increased reactivities of these loop residues by an additional 2.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively (Figure 6B). These results suggest that both G* and the KL were not completely disrupted in the absence of Mg2+ when the PTE was examined within the full-length gRNA. These data imply that the PFBV PTE within the gRNA is not as dependent on Mg2+ for folding as it is as an isolated fragment."

To test this hypothesis, we used the modifying reagent 1- cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-ptoluenesulfonate (CMCT) to probe the PTE RNA structures of gPTE-WT, gPTE-Cm and gPTE-SL2sm. CMCT reacts with N-1 of guanylates and (more efficiently) with N-3 of uridylates (30,41,42), which reside on the Watson\u2013 Crick faces of their respective residues (Figure 7B). Therefore, CMCT only reacts with residues that are not engaged in Watson\u2013Crick base-pairs. If the Watson\u2013Crick face of G* is highly solvent accessible and not Watson\u2013Crick basepaired, it would be expected to react strongly with CMCT.\nAs shown in Figure 7C, gPTE-WT G* had high reactivity with CMCT, though G* did not show hyperreactivity, in contrast to its hyperreactivity with SHAPE probing\nreagents. This indicates that the Watson\u2013Crick face of G* has high accessibility and suggests that G* is not Watson\u2013 Crick base-paired in the gPTE-WT PK (see Supplemental Figure S4 for full-length gel images of the three replicate probings.)\nUnexpectedly, the guanylate immediately 3\u2032 of G* (denoted G\u2022; Figure 7A) was more reactive than G* with CMCT, indicating that the Watson\u2013Crick face of G\u2022 is also unpaired and may have greater solvent accessibility. For gPTE-Cm and gPTE-SL2sm, which contain disrupted PKs, both G* and G\u2022 had reduced CMCT reactivities (Figure 7C). This result suggests that G* and G\u2022 gained alternative pairing/interacting partners for their Watson\u2013Crick faces when the PK was disrupted.

DMS reacts with N-7 of guanylates, N-1 of adenylates, and N-3 of cytidylates (30) (Figure 7B). N-1 of adenylates and N-3 of cytidylates reside on the Watson\u2013Crick faces of their residues, while guanylate N-7 points into, and is accessible from the major groove of an A-form RNA helix. Therefore, DMS can react with guanylates engaged in Watson\u2013Crick base-pairs and primarily reports on the presence or absence of non-canonical interactions involving guanylate N-7. gPTE-WT G* was highly reactive with DMS, indicating that G* N-7 in the WT PTE is accessible and not involved in a non-canonical interaction (Figure 7D). In contrast, G\u2022 had moderate to low DMS reactivity, suggesting that for the WT PTE, G\u2022 N-7 is possibly involved in a non-canonical interaction.\nWhen gPTE-Cm and gPTE-SL2sm were probed with DMS, there were major reductions in G* reactivity and minor reductions in G\u2022 reactivity, suggesting that in the ab-\nsence of the PK, G* N-7 may engage in non-canonical interaction(s). For both gPTE-Cm and gPTE-SL2sm, reduced reactivity was found for the guanylate (but not the uridylate) of the 5\u2032GU immediately downstream of the asymmetric loop (Figure 7A, red box; Figure 7D, red line). This suggests that the conformation of these residues changed, as was also detected with CMCT probing of gPTE-SL2sm (Figure 7C). Altogether, these results suggest that: (i) PFBV PTE G* and G\u2022 residues are not Watson\u2013Crick paired in the PK and have highly accessible Watson\u2013Crick faces (with the Watson\u2013Crick face of G\u2022 being significantly more accessible) and (ii) the PK of the PFBV PTE is likely composed of primarily non-canonical interactions given that both G* and G\u2022 are not Watson\u2013Crick paired."

However, molecular dynamics simulations of all these PFBV PTE models indicated that the KL was maintained but the PK was not stable, further suggesting that the PFBV PTE PK forms by non-canonical interactions in agreement with the CMCT probing (Figure 7C). It should also be noted that any modeling of PTEs and their PKs should maintain the accessibility of the asymmetric loop for possible interaction with eIF4E as previously proposed (22). Although our modeling of the PFBV PTE remains incomplete and lacks a clear PK interaction (Figure 7E), it does suggest that the KL can form while maintaining the accessibility of the asymmetric loop."

Mutation of two C residues between SL1 and SL2 that are proposed to participate in the PK (construct gPEMV-PTEm2; Figure 8A) reduced SHAPE reactivity of G* and increased reactivity of residues between SL1 and SL2 (CCCU), similar to PFBV gPTE-Cm.

Reactivity levels were only slightly reduced in the absence of the PK (gPEMV-PTEm2), suggesting that G* and G\u2022 N-7 remained unpaired in the absence of the PK.\nThese results reveal that the CMCT reactivity patterns for G* and G\u2022 are similar for both PFBV and PEMV2 PTEs within the gRNAs, suggesting a shared conformation involving G*, G\u2022 and the PK despite these two PTEs differing in the seeming strength of their PKs and the presence or absence of SL3 and the KL interaction.\nMg2+ is required to form the PK in full-length PEMV2 gRNA\nAs shown in Figure 6, the PFBV PTE within the gRNA is mostly stable in the absence of Mg2+. To investigate if a PTE that forms in the absence of a KL is similarly stable in the absence of Mg2+ within the gRNA, gPEMV-PTE-WT was subjected to folding in the absence of Mg2+, and the SHAPE profile compared with that of gPEMV-PTEm2. Contrary to results found for the PFBV PTE, G* hyperreactivity in gPEMV-PTE-WT was nearly abolished in the absence of Mg2+ (Figure 8E). These results suggest that the PEMV2 PTE is less stable than the PFBV PTE within the gRNA, inferring that the KL may offer increased stability to a PTE.\nThe absence of a Watson\u2013Crick base-pair involving G\u2022 correlates with an A-C mismatch in the PK of the JINRV PTE\nCMCT probing of PFBV and PEMV2 PTEs (Figures 7C and 8C) indicate that G\u2022, in addition to G*, lacks a Watson\u2013 Crick base-pairing partner, despite the presence of potential C/U partners between SL1 and SL2. This finding suggests that the unpaired G\u2022 residue just downstream of G* might not need to be a guanylate to form the PK required for a functional PTE for some viruses. While most PTEs contain three consecutive guanylates in their asymmetric loops, the PTE in betacarmovirus Japanese iris necrotic ring virus (JINRV) is an exception. The JINRV PTE has an asymmetric loop consisting of 5\u2032GCG*AGAUG (the normal G\u2022 position is underlined) for pairing with 5\u2032UGACCC between SL1 and SL2 (Figure 9A). As with other PTEs with three cytidylates between SL1 and SL2, the JINRV PTE does not contain a discernible SL3 or KL, and thus the PK must exist in a stable conformation with 5\u2032G*AG in its asymmetric loop. SHAPE probing of the JINRV PTE fragment (Figure 9B; JINRV gRNA was not available) was consistent with its previously proposed Y-shaped secondary structure (22) and confirmed the hyperreactivity of the G* residue shown in Figure 9A. Altering the 3\u2032 terminal cytidylate between SL1 and SL2 to an adenylate (generating JIN-PTEmPK) significantly reduced G* reactivity (Figure 9B), suggesting that the PK involves at least this cytidylate. The asymmetric loop adenylate is in the position corresponding to G\u2022 in PFBV and PEMV2, resulting in an A-C mismatch and a PK that may also be formed by primarily non-canonical interactions.\nCoarse-grained simulation using SimRNA (32) was used to attempt the generation of a 3D model of the JINRV PTE and its PK, and the stability of the model was further tested by molecular dynamics. The SimRNA input explicitly specified the Y-shaped secondary structure and a single Watson\u2013 Crick base-pair in the PK between G* and the C residue just upstream of SL2 (i.e. just downstream of the A-C mismatch). All other PK elements (if any) in the model generated by SimRNA were allowed to form passively.

(E) SHAPE probing in which Mg2+ was withheld from the folding buffer [(\u2013)Mg2+]. No EDTA was added to the folding buffer in this experiment, making these conditions less stringent than those used to probe the PFBV PTE shown in Figure 6.\nCMCT probing of the PFBV and PEMV2 PTEs suggests that PTE G* residues are not Watson\u2013Crick paired (Figures 7C and 8C), specifying a Watson\u2013Crick base-pair involving G* in the PK of the JINRV PTE allowed for formation of a PK interaction in the initial model produced by SimRNA with the potential to be further refined. In three 500 ns molecular dynamics runs using the Amber suite (36), however, the Watson\u2013Crick base-pair in the PK involving G* was highly stable as measured by occupancies close to 100% (Figure 9C), preventing further refinement of the model towards one possessing an unpaired G*.\nModeling PTEs that have three cytidylates between SL1 and SL2 and no SL3\nWe also generated 3D models of the PEMV2 PTE and PTEs from PMV, cocksfoot mild mottle virus (CMMV), car-\nnation mottle virus (CarMV), and thin paspalum asymptomatic virus (TPAV) by coarse-grained simulation using SimRNA. All of these PTEs have no discernible SL3 and contain three cytidylates between SL1 and SL2 available for base-pairing in the PK (Figure 10A). The input to SimRNA contained only the Y-shaped secondary structures. Thus, in all these models, the PK formed passively in coarse-grained simulation using SimRNA. In molecular dynamics using the Amber suite, the PKs of all PTE models were stable (Figure 10B). Interestingly, in all PTE models produced by SimRNA, G* and G\u2022 residues were Watson\u2013Crick paired in the PK, and in all molecular dynamics runs, G* had Watson\u2013Crick base-pair occupancy near 100% and, with the single exception of one molecular dynamics run of the TPAV PTE (Figure 10C), G\u2022 also had Watson\u2013Crick base-pair occupancy near 100%.

For all PTEs except for the TPAV PTE, the PKs of these altered models remained stable, suggesting that a base-pair involving G\u2022 is indeed unnecessary for PK stability. However, Watson\u2013Crick base-pair occupancies for G* remained close to 100% for all but the TPAV PTE. Furthermore, the PK of the altered TPAV PTE was noticeably less stable with base-pair occupancies <50%, suggesting that the TPAV PTE may be unable to accept an adenylate replacing G\u2022. Interestingly, the PK of the WT TPAV PTE remained stable when the occupancy of its G\u2022 base-pair was only 52% in one run of molecular dynamics (Figure 10B). At several times during this run, G\u2022 was no longer Watson\u2013Crick base-paired (Figure 10C), possibly revealing a PK conformation that better agrees with the CMCT probing of the PFBV and PEMV2 PTEs (Figures 7C and 8C). Considering that all PKs were required to form passively in WT PTEs and contained Watson\u2013 Crick paired G* and G\u2022 residues, more detailed modeling with manual intervention and further constraints may be necessary to more reliably produce models with stable PKs comprised of non-Watson\u2013Crick paired G* and G\u2022 residues."

By understanding the structure of 3\u2032CITEs and how they attract the host translation machinery, new facets of cap-independent translation have been uncovered that may also be relevant for translation of a subset of host mRNAs. Most studies on the structure and function of 3\u2032CITEs use isolated fragments or reporter constructs that separate the presumptive complete element from the remainder of the viral genome. By examining the PFBV PTE in situ, we discovered an additional upstream stem-loop (SL3) whose apical loop forms a KL with the apical loop of the PTE SL2. SL3s in similar locations relative to core PTE structures and with apical loops capable of forming a KL with SL2 correlate with PTEs that do not contain three cytidylate residues between SL1 and SL2 for pairing with the G-rich asymmetric loop (Figure 2).\nWe determined that the KL was important for the formation and/or stabilization of the PFBV PTE PK, which involves residues in the G-rich asymmetric loop and C/U residues between SL1 and SL2. In the absence of the KL, the PK is disrupted and SHAPE hyperreactivity of G* and the high CMCT reactivities of G* and G\u2022 are not present (Figures 3C, 7C, 8B and C).

In addition, PFBV PTE-Cm was less able to interfere with translation when added in trans (Figure 4B and C). These results suggest that some functional PTE still exist in the absence of the KL and that the KL primarily serves an accessory role to stabilize the PK. Efforts to validate the presence of the KL in vivo were not successful as we were unable to infect our standard Arabidopsis protoplast system with RNA transcripts synthesized from the full-length construct obtained using sequence deposited in GenBank.\nComparing the structures of the PFBV PTE within the gRNA and in isolated fragments revealed three major structural differences: (i) In isolated fragments, but not within the gRNA, the KL formed independently of the PK (Figure 4D and E); (ii) the PFBV PTE fragment tested previously (Figure 2; PFBV; blue arrows) required Mg2+ in the folding buffer to fold correctly (22), whereas the PFBV PTE in the context of the gRNA was much less reliant on Mg2+ in the folding buffer (Figure 6) and (iii) residues in SL1 were less reactive in SHAPE probing in the gRNA than in the isolated fragment, consistent with these residues engaging in a long-distance RNA:RNA interaction with a complementary sequence in the loop of a 5\u2032 region hairpin in the gRNA (Figure 4D and E). The structural differences described in (i) and (ii) suggest that additional as yet unknown elements in gRNAs may interact with the PFBV PTE structure that reduce its dependence on Mg2+ for folding and destabilize the KL when the PK is absent. The ability of the KL to form in the absence of the PK, at least in the isolated fragment, also suggests a folding pathway for the PFBV PTE in which the KL forms before the PK."

            "text": "Previous models of the PEMV2 PTE suggested that G* is unpaired and highly accessible to the solvent based on its hyperreactivity to SHAPE reagents (21,22). In CMCT probing of the PFBV and PEMV2 PTEs (Figures 7C and 8C), G* indeed had high reactivity with CMCT suggestive of a highly accessible, unpaired Watson\u2013Crick face. However, G* was not hyperreactive with CMCT and had lower CMCT reactivity than the adjacent, downstream G\u2022, despite G\u2022 having much lower SHAPE reactivity than G*. Higher CMCT reactivity suggests that G\u2022 may have greater solvent accessibility than G*, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies addressing the mechanisms of SHAPE chemistry and the causes of residue hyperreactivity (43\u201346), as well as large-scale analyses of residue accessibility (47). These studies found that SHAPE hyperreactivity has minimal correlation with the solvent accessibility of a residue and that hyperreactive residues can even be basepaired. SHAPE reactivity typically measures the flexibility of a residue to adopt various conformations, including rare conformations that promote the modification reaction. Because of this, unpaired residues typically have high SHAPE reactivities due to their flexibility in sampling different conformations. However, hyperreactivity in SHAPE probing was proposed to signify that a residue is constrained in one of the rare conformations that promote the modification\nreaction, or by the presence of a nearby group that catalyzes the modification reaction. Thus, solvent accessibility may not directly correlate with SHAPE reactivity, as suggested by the relative CMCT reactivities of PTE G* and G\u2022 residues.\nPTEs with and without SL3 share a similar PK conformation\nWe have determined that the PTE PKs of PFBV and PEMV2 share similar conformations of G* and G\u2022. PFBV and PEMV2 G* and G\u2022 residues had high CMCT reactivities, suggesting that both G* and G\u2022 are not Watson\u2013Crick paired with another residue. The JINRV PTE has an adenylate at the G\u2022 location, causing an A\u2013C mismatch that may be analogous to G\u2022 as well. PFBV and PEMV2 G\u2022 residues also had significantly higher CMCT reactivity than G*, suggesting that G\u2022 may have higher solvent accessibility and that this non-Watson\u2013Crick paired residue may bind the cap-binding site of eIF4E, as was also proposed previously for G* (22). It remains uncertain, though, if an adenylate at the G\u2022 location, such as in the JINRV PTE, may bind the cap-binding site in lieu of a guanylate. In prior work that used 3D modeling to dock eIF4E to the residue identified as the hyperreactive G in PEMV2 (22), the hyperreactive G was incorrectly designated on the PTE structure, and was actually the residue identified here as G\u2022. Previous mutation of G\u2022 to an adenylate in a luciferase reporter construct was also the least detrimental of all the alterations made to G\u2022 and the three adjacent guanylates, retaining 25.6% of translation levels in vitro and \u224840% in vivo relative to the unmutated construct (21). In addition, they found that an adenylate replacing G\u2022 did not affect the hyperreactive G* in SHAPE probing, suggesting that the PK remained intact, while replacing any of the three adjacent guanylates with an adenylate abolished G* hyperreactivity. When taking into account the misidentification of G*, this previous study further suggests that certain PTE structures can accept an adenylate at the G\u2022 location and remain functional and that an adenylate may possibly occupy the cap-binding site of eIF4E. Our inability to generate models of PTEs with both the KL and PK suggests that unusual conformations of nucleotides exist in the PK that likely contribute to its overall structure and ability to bind to eIF4E, which will only be revealed by more in-depth studies."
