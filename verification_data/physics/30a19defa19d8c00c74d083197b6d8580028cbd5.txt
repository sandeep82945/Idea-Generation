The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is not explicitly provided in the provided text. However, the text concludes with a summary of the study's findings and acknowledges the potential of polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) for various separation applications, particularly for CO2 capture. It also highlights the superior separation performance of PILs containing Tf2Nâˆ’ anions compared to other polymers. While not directly stating future research directions, the acknowledgment of PILs' promising properties and superior performance of specific anions suggests areas for further investigation and optimization in membrane technology for gas separation.
