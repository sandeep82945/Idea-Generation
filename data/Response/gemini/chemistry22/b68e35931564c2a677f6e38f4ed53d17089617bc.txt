1. **Investigate the role of apoptosis in the release of cTn molecules from MCs in different pathological conditions.** This could be done by measuring cTn levels in the blood of patients with various diseases that are known to cause MCs apoptosis, such as sepsis, heart failure, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Additionally, researchers could use animal models of these diseases to study the mechanisms of cTn release during apoptosis.


2. **Examine the relationship between diurnal rhythm and cTn levels in different populations.** This could be done by measuring cTn levels in the blood of healthy individuals at different times of day. Additionally, researchers could study the effect of shift work and other factors that disrupt the circadian rhythm on cTn levels.


3. **Investigate the role of extracardiac expression of cTn molecules in the elevation of cTn levels in patients with CKD and hereditary myopathies.** This could be done by measuring cTn levels in the blood and skeletal muscle of patients with these diseases. Additionally, researchers could use animal models of these diseases to study the mechanisms of cTn release from skeletal muscle.


4. **Develop new troponin immunoassays that are less affected by biological and analytical variations.** This could be done by using antibodies that are more specific for cTn molecules and by developing assays that are less sensitive to interference from other substances in the blood.


5. **Investigate the use of cTn levels as a biomarker for the risk of CVD in healthy individuals.** This could be done by measuring cTn levels in the blood of healthy individuals and following them over time to see if they develop CVD. Additionally, researchers could study the relationship between cTn levels and other risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.
