    "abstractText": "The \u201cgut\u2013microbiota\u2013brain axis\u201d reveals that gut microbiota plays a critical role in the orchestrating behavior of the host. However, the correlation between the host personalities and the gut microbiota is still rarely known. To investigate whether the gut microbiota of Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) differs between bold and shy personalities, we compared the gut microbiota of bold and shy gerbils, and then we transplanted the gut microbiota of bold and shy gerbils into middle group gerbils (individuals with less bold and shy personalities). We found a significant overall correlation between host boldness and gut microbiota. Even though there were no significant differences in alpha diversity and beta diversity of gut microbiota between bold and shy gerbils, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes phyla and Odoribacter and Blautia genus were higher in bold gerbils, and Escherichia_shigella genus was lower. Furthermore, the fecal microbiota transplantation showed that changes in gut microbiota could not evidently cause the increase or decrease in the gerbil\u2019s boldness score, but it increased the part of boldness behaviors by gavaging the \u201cbold fecal microbiota\u201d. Overall, these data demonstrated that gut microbiota were significantly correlated with the personalities of the hosts, and alteration of microbiota could alter host boldness to a certain extent.",

            "text": "Bacterial\u2013host interactions are ubiquitous, and thus, the influences of bacteria on animals vary from subtle to profound. The \u201cgut\u2013microbiota\u2013brain axis\u201d has long been considered a network of connections involving multiple biological systems, allowing bidirectional communication between gut bacteria and the brain, and is crucial in maintaining homeostasis of the gastrointestinal and central nervous microbial systems of animals [1,2]. For example, the study of Brandt\u2019s vole showed that the interaction between gut microbiota and norepinephrine (NE) regulates heat production through the vagus nerve [3]. In recent years, increasing evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in orchestrating the function of immune systems [4], metabolism [5] and the development of various organs [6]. In addition, there is other empirical evidence showing the gut microbiota can influence host behaviors through chemical communication (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) with the nervous system [1]. Previous studies suggest that the gut microbiota can affect host foraging behavior [7], anxiety-like behavior [8], activity [9] and social behavior [10]. A recent study found that the composition and diversity of gut microbiota are related to the personality characteristics of human infants [11]. However, we do not fully understand the relationship between personalities and gut microbiota in small mammals. Animal personality has been defined as a consistent and relatively stable amongindividual variation in behavior that is present in a wide variety of taxa [12]. In the past\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1054. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10051054 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1054 2 of 12\ntwo decades, researchers have discovered that the animal personality is related to the immune system [13,14] and metabolism [9,15,16] states, which in turn affects the development of organs [17,18] and the variation of behaviors [19\u201321]. The \u201cState\u2013behavior feedbacks\u201d theory regards individual state variations as the reason for individual behavior differences, and individuals thus differ in personalities because they are in a different state, adjusting their behaviors in an adaptive fashion to these differences [22]. Logically, the gut microbiota may affect animal personalities via the mechanism of the \u201cgut\u2013microbiota\u2013brain axis\u201d. For example, the gut microbiota may influence animal behavior through its metabolite \u2018direct\u2019 (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, SCFAs) [23] or \u2018indirect\u2019 (e.g., gut microorganisms are capable of synthesizing neurotransmitters themselves and can induce production of neurotransmitters by their animal hosts) [24] pathways to affect individual personalities. Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) is a rodent species that lives in the steppe, semi-desert and desert habitats in northern China, southeast Mongolia, and the southern TransBaikal and south of Tuva region of Russia [25,26]. Mongolian gerbils live in social groups comprising 2\u201318 individuals throughout the year [27], where each group occupies an exclusive territory and all group members share the burrow system [28]. Previous studies have shown that Mongolian gerbils exhibit individual-specific trespassing by neighbors and chases involving individuals from adjacent groups are frequently observed in fields [28,29], and among-individual food-hoarding behaviors variation in the laboratory [29,30]. Recently, the gut microbiota regulating host physiological and behavioral processes has been reported in Mongolian gerbils [31]. However, individual variation of gut microbiota and its relationship with individual behavior variation in small mammals are still rarely reported. Here, we hypothesized that the composition of gut microbiota was correlated with the host\u2019s boldness, and studied the relationship between boldness and gut microbiota, and specifically addressed two questions: (i) Is the boldness of gerbils related to the community structure of gut microbiota? (ii) If so, can gut microbiota transplantation change the bold character of gerbils?"

To determine the consistency and repeatability of boldness for gerbils, a second EPM test was run 1 week later. Entered or not, time spent and distance moved in the open arm, ratios of open arms entries to closed arms entries (ROE), ratios of open arms time spent to closed arms time spent (ROT) and ratios of open arms moving distance to closed arms moving distance (ROM) was used to create a boldness score.

Universal primers were used for PCR amplification of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes and contained Illumina 3\u2032 adaptor sequences as well as a 12-bp barcode. Sequencing was pair-end on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, with the sequencing strategy PE250. Raw sequencing reads were denoised, filtered according to barcode and primer sequences (Forward primer-341F, CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG; Reverse primer-805R, GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), and classified with the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME2, version 2021.11.0) software suite, according to the Qiime2 tutorial (https://qiime2.org/, Accessed: 11 October 2021) with modified some methods [40]. Further filter out noisy sequences, error correction, remove chimeric sequences, remove singletons was performed using DADA2 [41] algorithm (\u201cqiime dada2 denoisepaired\u201d), and the remaining tags were clustered into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The taxonomy of these features was assigned to the Silva database (release 132), and a feature table was generated using Qiime2\u2019s classify-sklearn taxonomy classifier. Alpha diversity of fecal microbiota was characterized by Chao1, Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity and Shannon diversity indices using \u201cqiime diversity alpha\u201d command line. Statistical comparison of the alpha diversity indices between group levels was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots of the Bray\u2013Curtis metric were calculated with square root transformed data and visualized in R (vegan package Version 2.5-4). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed to disclose the factors shaping the dynamics of the feces microbial communities between bold and shy gerbils. PERMANOVA, a distribution-free algorithm, accommodates random effects, repeated measures, and unbalanced datasets [42]. For PERMANOVA analysis, we used the adonis function in the vegan package of R including different independent variables (e.g., bold and shy gerbils) with default settings (Bray\u2013Curtis distance and 999 permutations). Stage-dependent features were identified by using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) with default settings (e.g., LDA score > 2) [43]. The function prediction of the microbial community was performed using PICRUSt2 [44] based on ASVs clustered from 16S rRNA sequencing data, and then metabolic predictions were identified from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway hierarchy\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1054 4 of 12\nlevels 2 and 3 for interpretation and subsequent analysis [45].

We analyzed the influence of boldness on the microbiome at a finer scale by comparing the proportions of the top 30 most abundant OTUs.

Additionally, we found that the alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiota were not significant different between bold and shy gerbils, but the Odoribacter and Blautia abundance of bold gerbils was higher and Escherichia_shigella was lower than shy gerbils. We found that alterations in the gut microbiome did not significantly affect the boldness score of Mongolian gerbils in the FMT experiment, but \u201cbold feces\u201d can reinforce receptors\u2019 bold behavior phenotypes. Therefore, our results suggest that the gut microbiota plays a role in the personality regulation of Mongolian gerbils.\nMost of the \u201cbold fecal\u201d gavage (BG) gerbils enhanced 66.9% (95% confidence interval 20.1\u2013113.6%) of their bold behaviors (time spent in the open arms, moving distance in the open arms, ROT and ROM) after FMT, while in the \u201cshy fecal\u201d gavage (SG) group, the effects were chaotic. This finding is unexpected since the state-behavior feedbacks hypothesis suggests that individual behavior differences are caused by individual state variations and that individuals adjust their behavior in an adaptive way to accommodate these differences [22]. Recent empirical studies have shown that the gut microbiota are involved in the regulation of the host physiological states, such as metabolisms and hormone levels [2,23,48].

            "text": "In this study, we found a significant correlation between host boldness and gut microbiota. Additionally, we found that the alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiota were not significant different between bold and shy gerbils, but the Odoribacter and Blautia abundance of bold gerbils was higher and Escherichia_shigella was lower than shy gerbils. We found that alterations in the gut microbiome did not significantly affect the boldness score of Mongolian gerbils in the FMT experiment, but \u201cbold feces\u201d can reinforce receptors\u2019 bold behavior phenotypes. Therefore, our results suggest that the gut microbiota plays a role in the personality regulation of Mongolian gerbils. ost of the \u201cbold fecal\u201d gavage (BG) gerbils enha ced 66.9% (95% confidence interval 20.1\u2013113.6%) of their bold behaviors (time spent in the open arms, moving distance in the open arms, ROT and ROM) after FMT, while in the \u201cshy fecal\u201d gavage (SG) group, the effects were chaotic. This finding is unexpected since the state-behavior feedbacks hypothesis suggests that individual behavior differences are caused by individual state variations and that individuals adjust their behavior in an adaptive way to accommodate th se differences [22]. Recent empirical studies hav shown that the gut microbiota are involved in the regulation of the host physiological states, such as metabolisms and hormone levels [2,23,48]. Thus, we suggested that changes in gut microbiota would affect the host state and further alter the host personalities. However, the gut microbiota did not exhibit a significant difference between bold and shy gerbils, only some of the bacteria\u2019s abundance differences. Furthermore, the results showed only BG gerbils changed boldness ehaviors (increased but not significant) after fecal microbiota transplant. One of the potential reasons to explain our results is that the function of gut microbiota may differ in different phyla or genus. Indeed, the unique function of specific microbiota phyla/genus has been found in many studies as follows: Proteobacteria is related to the biosynthesis of vitamins and contributes to the br akdown and ferm nt of complex sugars for th host [49]; Firmicutes contribute to the production of enzymes involve in ferm nting vegetative material and have the potential to fabricate vitamin B [50]; Anaerostipes can protect against an allergic response to food [51]; Odoribacter has specific microbiota strains and immune mechanisms to enhance host immune [52]. Our results showed that the gut microbiota of gerbils is mainly Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, while Odoribacter was higher\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1054 9 of 12\nin bold gerbils. We hypothesized that Odoribacter was the most important gut microbiota in determining boldness. Indeed, Odoribacter and Blautia are two known butyrate producers [53,54], which are involved in improving the host metabolism [54,55], and the butyrate was able to regulate systemic metabolism by passing through the enterocytes to influence the peripheral tissues [56,57]. Furthermore, the host\u2019s high activity level has been reported to be positively associated with the abundance of the genus Odoribacter and Blautia [58,59], while high metabolism and activity are thought to be significant characteristics of the bold personality [60,61]. Accordingly, we proposed that Odoribacter and Blautia abundances are the decisive factors in determining the gerbil\u2019s boldness. The causal relationship between personality and gut microbiota might be an alternative explanation for our results, namely that personality shows a dominant position in the correlation to boldness and gut microbiota. The model of Sih et al. (2015) suggests the joint emergence and maintenance of among-individual differences in behavior and state, and how such differences are promoted by positive feedback between behavior and state. For example, bold individuals would have higher activity level or more aggressive, which required them to have a higher metabolic rate to support their behavior phenotypes, and bold individuals via their personality-dependent behavior and physiological characteristics to influence the gut microbiota composition. One study found that socially dominant rats could be distinguished from subordinates based on their intestinal microbiota: Clostridiaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae were significantly enriched in dominant rats, which were associated with butyrate production, whereas Veillonellaceae were less represented [62]. The FMT experiment showed that gut microbiota was the key to maintaining social dominance, and sodium butyrate could enhance the social dominance of mice [62]. Another study found that the gut microbiota composition of dogs was based on their body condition [63], which suggested that the state of the host may determine the composition of the gut microbiota. As a result, we hypothesized that personality-dependent physiological variation could be the source of their gut microbiota differences; in turn, the gut microbiota could involve and affect host physiology via multiple pathways, and then enhance personality phenotypes via these physiological changes, such as cerebral epigenetic marks [64], and the butyrate-producing [62]. Moreover, PICRUSt2-predicted KEGG pathway analysis showed that the bacterial functional pathways, which were related to porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolisms, were significantly enriched in bold gerbils. In contrast, the functional pathways involved in taurine, hypotaurine and tryptophan metabolism were significantly decreased. This result suggests that increased porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolisms and decreased taurine, hypotaurine and tryptophan metabolisms may be related to the development of individual boldness. Recent studies have reported that tryptophan metabolism could be linked to behavior and cognition [65], and taurine supplement could reinforce the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings\u2019 risk-taking tendency and be related to spatial learning performance [66]. Thus, an alteration in metabolism in the gut microbiota may be related to host personality traits such as boldness. In conclusion, our present study found a potential relationship between gut microbiota and the boldness personality in Mongolian gerbils. Even though we could not find evidence that changes in gut microbiota can significantly change individual\u2019s boldness score, the \u201cbold microbiota\u201d reinforced the gerbil\u2019s bold behavior obviously. Based on our current findings and the mixed results of other studies on personalities and gut microbiota [1,22,23,48], it would appear that the presence and direction of the relationship between individual personalities and gut microbiota are complex. There is thus a need for additional empirical and theoretical studies to further illuminate generalities about the nature of the relationship between animal personality and gut microbiota.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms10051054/s1, Figure S1: Alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiota in gerbils.\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1054 10 of 12\nAuthor Contributions: L.G., W.L. and D.W. designed the experiment; L.G. and T.B. contributed to the experiment and the analysis of the data; L.G. and T.B. drafted the manuscript; W.L. and D.W. revised the manuscript.
