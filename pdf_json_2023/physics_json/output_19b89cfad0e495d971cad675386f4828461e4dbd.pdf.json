            "text": "In recent decades, the functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) using organometallic compounds has been intensively studied.1 These metal polyphosphides play an important role as intermediates in the production of organophosphorus compounds since they can circumvent the use of environmentally harmful chlorine gas.2,3 Starting with the activation of P4 using transition metals which led to the formation of various polyphosphide ring structures such as [P4] 2\u2212, [P5] \u2212 or the neutral [P6]-ring,1,4\u20137 this reactivity could be transferred to a variety of main group compounds in the following years.1,8\u201314 With the synthesis of [(Cp*)2Sm\nIII)4P8] (Cp* = C5Me5) by reducing P4 with the solvent-free [(Cp*)2Sm II],\nsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT),\nany.

Direct activation of P4 with 4f-elements is still rather rare. It ismainly based on SET (single electron transfer) processes of classical divalent LnII-compounds, which either led to the formation of [P8]\n4\u2212 (Fig. 1a)15 or anti-bimetallic structural motifs with a [P4]\n2\u2212 Zintl anion (Fig. 1b),30 or oxidative substitution with Ln-arene complexes (Ln = La, Yb, Lu) to form 4f-element polyphosphides bearing a [P7]\n3\u2212 Zintl anion.16,31,32 The structural motif of a cyclo-[P3]\n3\u2212 polyphosphide, common for transition metal chemistry,1,33\u201335 is rarely encountered in rare earth compounds. The only reported example is the anti-bimetallic complex K[{(L)Y(thf)}2(m3-h 3:h3:h2-P3)] (L 2\u2212 = N,N\u2032-2,6-diisopropylphenyl-1,4-diazabutadiene), synthesised by the alkyl migration of an organosubstituted cyclo-P4R2 precursor. Thereby, the central [P3]\n3\u2212 Zintl anion binds at two YIII cations in a bridging coordination mode (Fig. 1c).36 In addition, there are two examples, in which a cyclo-P3 unit, which is part of a larger ligand scaffold, coordinates to a lanthanide atom. The rst example, a bicyclo[4.1.0]triphosphaheptanide generated by [3 + 1] fragmentation of white phosphorus with a Lumetallacyclopentadiene binds to the metal atom.37 The second structural example is the 4d/4f hexaphosphide [(Cp*2Ln\nIII)2P6(Cp*Mo(CO)2)2] (Ln= Sm, Yb). Here, the P6 unit, which consists of two P\u2013P-bridged cyclo-P3 rings, coordinates to the lanthanide ions.29Besides structural aspects, themagnetic properties of such compounds, in particular of multinuclear Ln compounds bridged by Zintl anions, may provide new insights in the eld of SMMs (single molecule magnets).38,39\nRecently, organo-lanthanide compounds bridged by a [Bi6] 6\u2212 Zintl anion, which promoted strong ferromagnetic interactions between lanthanides, were reported.40\nScheme 1 Synthesis of [(NON)LnII(thf)2] (1-Ln) and [(NON)Ln III(BH4)(thf)2 cyclo-P4 (2-Ln) and cyclo-P3 complexes (4-Ln).\n2150 | Chem.

As a result, new anti-bimetallic complexes of organo-lanthanide polyphosphides, which were synthesized by direct conversion of white phosphorus using diand trivalent lanthanide compounds, were obtained. For this purpose, we stabilized the complexes by using the bulky NON ligand (NON = 4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl-amino)-2,7-di-tertbutyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene)), which was recently employed for stabilizing metal centres in low oxidation states.41\u201343 Within our studies, we showcase the reduction of a polyphosphide within the coordination sphere of a lanthanide complex, which so far is unprecedented."

For this purpose, the divalent lanthanide complexes [(NON)LnII(thf)2] (Ln = Sm, Yb) (1-Ln) were rst synthesised via the salt elimination reaction of [K2(NON)] and the corresponding diiodides [LnIII2(thf)2] (Ln = Sm, Yb) (Scheme 1, top). Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis could be obtained in both cases by recrystallization of the crude products from ahot n-heptane solution. Thereby, compound 1-Smwas obtained as large black crystals, while compound 1-Yb appeared as red crystals, both in yields above 60%.

Two molecules of THF saturate the coordination sphere of the lanthanide. The Sm\u2013Nbond lengths in 1-Sm (Sm\u2013N1 2.418(7) \u00c5, Sm\u2013N2 2.433(7) \u00c5) are slightly shorter compared to previously reported divalent (bis)amido SmIIcompounds.44\u201346 Similarly, the Sm\u2013O bond lengths are comparable to organometallic SmII-compounds known from the literature (Sm\u2013 O1 2.554(5) \u00c5, Sm\u2013O2 2.564(6) \u00c5, Sm\u2013O3 2.526(6) \u00c5).47\nDue to the smaller ionic radius of YbII in compound 1-Yb, the Yb\u2013N and Yb\u2013O distances are shortened as expected (Yb\u2013N1 2.344(5) \u00c5, Yb\u2013N2 2.315(5) \u00c5, Yb\u2013O1 2.402(4) \u00c5). This effect is also reected in the N1\u2013Ln\u2013N2 angles, being 122.8\u00b0 for 1-Sm and widened for 1-Yb to 132.0\u00b0. The NMR spectra of the compound 1- Yb (Fig S1 and S2, ESI\u2020) in C6D6 at room temperature indicate that no coordinated THF remains on the molecule aer drying the material in vacuo for several hours. All resonances can be assigned to the xanthene backbone and Dipp-groups (Dipp = diisopropylphenyl) of the ligand, respectively. Due to the paramagnetic behaviour of 1-Sm, no meaningful NMR spectra could be obtained. Elemental analysis of 1-Sm indicates that one THF molecule remains coordinated to the SmII-cation aer drying the compound in vacuo.\nAer the successful isolation of compounds 1-Ln we investigated the reductive conversion of white phosphorus via SET with\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Thereby deep red solutions were obtained. Aer ltration of insoluble residues the anti-bimetallic complexes [{(NON)LnIII(thf)2}2(m-h\n4:h4-P4)] 2-Ln could be isolated as dark red (2-Sm) and dark orange (2-Yb) crystalline compounds. It should be mentioned here that the crystallization of 2-Sm was carried out from a saturated toluene solution at \u221210 \u00b0C, whereas the solvent had to be changed to THF for crystallization of 2-Yb. This supports the assumption that the coordinating THF remains in 1-Sm aer drying in vacuo, which is required for the crystallization of 2-Sm, while no coordinating THF molecules persist in 1-Yb. The isostructural compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pban. Similar to the previously reported [{(DippForm)2Sm\nIII}2(mh4:h4-P4)] (DippForm= {(2,6-iPr2C6H3)NC(H)= N(2,6-iPr2C6H3)}\n\u2212) the cyclo-[P4]\n2\u2212 Zintl anion coordinates in a bridging h4:h4 mode between two LnIII centres and exhibits an almost perfect square shape with internal angles of 88.62(9)\u00b0 and 91.38(9)\u00b0 for 2-Sm and 88.73(8)\u00b0 and 91.27(8)\u00b0 for 2-Yb, respectively (Fig. 3). Thereby the P\u2013P distance of 2.15 \u00c5 in 2-Ln as well as the Sm\u2013P distances of 3.0727(8) \u00c5 and 3.0908(10) \u00c5 are in the range of reported aromatic [P4]\n2\u2212 Zintl anions in the coordination sphere of two SmIII-moieties.30 Corresponding Yb\u2013P distances are slightly shorter (Yb\u2013P1 3.0192(8) \u00c5, Yb\u2013P2 3.0021(8) \u00c5) and in the range of the reported values.32 Compared to the divalent precursors 1-Ln, the Ln\u2013N distances (Sm\u2013N 2.360(4) \u00c5, Yb\u2013N 2.290(3) \u00c5) are moderately shorter and decrease with the ionic radius of the LnIII cation as well. To illustrate the staggered arrangement of the xanthene backbones and THF ligands in 2-Ln, the top view of 2-Yb is displayed on the right side of Fig. 3. For both compounds the torsion angle of the xanthene backbones is around 53\u00b0 (see Fig. S27 and S29, ESI\u2020). Compound 2-Sm is only the second example for P4 activation which led to the formation of a 6-p-aromatic [P4]\n2\u2212 ring in the coordination sphere of two SmIII cations and was entirely unknown for YbIII compounds so far. NMR spectra of 2-Ln were recorded in C6D6 at room temperature. Due to the paramagnetic behaviour of complexes 2-Ln no meaningful 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained.

Thus, the chemical shi is in a similar range to that of the previously reported [{(DippForm)2Sm}2(m-h 4:h4-P4)].30\nFor compound 2-Yb, the 31P{1H} NMR signal of the four phosphorus atoms is slightly shied to higher resonances and can be detected as a singlet at d = 382.4 ppm.\nMotivated by these results, we aimed to synthesize further LnIII polyphosphides beyond Sm and Yb in order to investigate different reducing processes and to have access to a broader range of rareearth elements for studying their physical properties. In particular, we focused on the synthesis of a dinuclear polyphosphidebridged DyIII compound, which could potentially exhibit SMM behaviour. Although [DyI2(dme)3] is known,48 it has proven too reactive for being a suitable precursor in organometallic chemistry. Therefore, a synthetic route starting from a robust and isolable LnIII species was chosen, which subsequently should be reduced in the presence of P4 to form new molecular Ln\nIII polyphosphides. The rst step was achieved by a salt elimination reaction between [K2(NON)] and the respective [Ln\nIII(BH4)3(thf)3] (Ln = Y, Sm, Dy) (Scheme 1, bottom). The corresponding compounds [(NON) LnIIIBH4(thf)2] 3-Ln could be isolated by recrystallization of crude materials from a hot n-heptane solution as colourless (3-Y), red (3- Sm) and light green (3-Dy) crystals in high yields. The isostructural compounds crystallize in the monoclinic space group P21/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit.\nThe molecular structures in the solid state of [(NON) LnIIIBH4(thf)2] 3-Ln are shown in Fig. 4. As expected, the central LnIII cation is coordinated by two amido functions and the oxygen atom of the NON ligand. Additionally, two molecules THF saturate the coordination sphere of the metal centre. Solely the coordination mode of the [BH4]\n\u2212 moiety, which was determined by free renement of the hydrogen atoms, differs in 3-Ln. While the [BH4]\n\u2212 ligand in 3-Y and 3-Dy coordinates in an h2-H2BH2 mode, an h3-H3BH coordination mode is observed for 3-Sm. The dependence of the coordination mode of borohydrides on the ionic radii and steric demand of the applied ligands is well known in lanthanide chemistry.49,50 In the case of 3-Ln, the hapticity of [BH4]\n\u2212 decreases with the ionic radius of the LnIII cation with a constant steric demand of the ligand. The respective Ln\u2013B distances are between 2.671(3) \u00c5 in 3-Sm and 2.717(3) \u00c5 in 3-Y. In the FT-IR spectra of compounds 3-Ln, different absorption\n2152 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 2149\u20132158\npatterns between 2400 cm\u22121 and 2100 cm\u22121 are observed for the different coordination modes of the [BH4]\n\u2212 moiety. In the 1H{11B} NMR spectrum of 3-Y the singlet at d= 1.13 ppm can be assigned to the four hydridic hydrogens of the [BH4] \u2212 moiety whereas no resonances for the hydrogen atoms of the borohydride can be found in the 1H NMR spectrum. All other resonances can be assigned to the NON ligand and one remaining coordinated THF molecule. The 11B NMR spectra show one broad signal at d = \u221224.2 ppm for 3-Y and at d = \u221238.5 ppm for 3-Sm, while remaining silent for 3-Dy due to the strong paramagnetic behaviour.\nTo reach the aim for new Ln polyphosphides beyond Sm and Yb, we applied the trivalent compounds 3-Ln in one-pot reactions with an excess of potassium and P4 at elevated temperatures in toluene (Scheme 1, bottom). Aerltration, [K{(NON)Ln(thf)}2(m3h3:h3:h2-P3)] 4-Ln could be isolated as colourless (4-Y), red (4-Sm) and yellow (4-Dy) crystals at \u221210 \u00b0C from a saturated toluene solution. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a bridging cyclo-[P3] 3\u2212 unit in a m-h3:h3 coordinationmode as the central building block, which displays an almost perfect triangular shape with internal angles between 58.97(4)\u00b0 and 62.04(5)\u00b0 for P1\u2013P2\u2013P1\u2032 and P1\u2013P1\u2032\u2013 P2, respectively (Fig. 5). The formation of 4-Ln shows that the multi-electron reduction applied here results in a different product. The P\u2013P bond lengths within 4-Ln range from 2.160(2) \u00c5 to 2.238(2) \u00c5, consistent with literature values of bridging cyclo[P3]\n3\u2212 polyphosphides.34,36 Here, the P1\u2013P1\u2032 bond is always slightly elongated compared to the P1\u2013P2 bond due to the coordination of P1 to the potassium ion (K\u2013P1 \u223c 3.18 \u00c5). The Ln\u2013CtP3 bond distances (CtP3 = centroid of the cyclo-[P3] moiety) in 4-Ln decrease with the radius of the respective rare earth ion. This in turn affects the K\u2013Ctphenyl distances, which thus also follow this trend (4-Sm: K\u2013Ctphenyl 2.8112(6) \u00c5 to 4-Dy: K\u2013Ctphenyl 2.7727(4) \u00c5). The coordination of the potassium ion by the two phenyl rings of the Dipp-moieties further leads to the folding of the originally planar xanthene backbone along the Ln\u2013O1\u2013C7 axis by about 35\u00b0 (see Fig. S34, S36 and S38, ESI\u2020). Using the specic example of 4- Sm, the Sm\u2013CtP3 distance of 2.6030(7) \u00c5 can be directly compared with the Sm\u2013CtP4 distance 2-Sm. The latter is slightly longer with 2.6787(7) \u00c5, which is due to the higher charge density in the cyclo[P3] 3\u2212 compared to the cyclo-[P4] 2\u2212 polyanion in an otherwise similar chemical environment. The resulting stronger electrostatic interactions lead to a shorter Sm\u2013CtP3 distance.\nlid state.

For compound 4-Y a triplet is seen in the 31P {1H} NMR spectrum at d = \u2212240.3 ppm with a coupling constant\nFig. 6 31P{1H} NMR spectra of [K{(NON)LnIII(thf)}2(m3-h 3:h3:h2-P3)] (4- Ln) in thf-d8 at 25 \u00b0C.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Aer a few hours at 65 \u00b0C, the 31P NMR resonance at 479.5 ppm in C6D6, which is assigned to the [P4]\n2\u2212 unit of 2-Sm (ESI, Fig. S3\u2020), vanished and a new resonance at\u2212320.8 ppm appeared. Aer removing C6D6 in vacuo and resolving the residue in thf-d8, the resonance was detected at \u2212336.7 ppm, which is consistent with the chemical shi of the isolated compound 4-Sm from the one pot reaction of 3-Sm with potassium and P4 (Fig. 6). This was further conrmed by the reaction of 2-Sm with potassium in a preparative scale with subsequent crystallisation of 4-Sm. In the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum no further resonances, which could be assigned to possible byproducts, were detected. Hence, the reactivity of 2-Sm with potassium clearly shows that the [P4] 2\u2212 can be reduced to a [P3] 3\u2212 Zintl anion in the coordination sphere of two SmIII cations. Therefore, we anticipate that during the formation of 4-Ln, P4 is reduced to a [P4]\n2\u2212 moiety rst and subsequently reduced to a [P3] 3\u2212 Zintl anion. However, isolation of the [P4] 2\u2212 species from the one-pot reaction of compounds 3-Ln was not possible even with variation of stoichiometry and temperature."

As in other lanthanide complexes,15 we nd that the bonding from the rare earth cations to polyphosphide ligands can be described primarily as ionic bonds. For this reason, the anionic cyclo-[P3]\n3\u2212 and cyclo[P4]\n2\u2212 ligands were also calculated as purely ionic model compounds K3P3 and K2P4 (point symmetries C1 and D4h) and compared with the situation in these complexes. The investigation of the structural data is supported by shared electron numbers (SEN) from population analyses based on occupation numbers according to the method of Ahlrichs and Heizmann that serve as measures for covalent bonding.56,57 For 2-Sm, the P\u2013P bond distance and the SEN are calculated to be 2.202 \u00c5 and 1.31, respectively. The values obtained for P4\n2\u2212 in K2P4 are in good agreement with this nding (bond distance 2.200 \u00c5, SEN 1.27). To evaluate the aromaticity, multi-center SEN(P4) of both particles were determined; the results support slight aromatic bonding (2-Sm: SEN(P4) 0.1; K2P4: SEN(P4) 0.08). Moreover, this behavior is supported by the NICS values of 2-Sm (NICS(0) +3.2, NICS(1) \u22124.5 ppm). For 4-Sm the P\u2013P bond distances were calculated to be 2.244 and 2.292 \u00c5, the SEN (P\u2013 P) were determined to be 1.20 and 1.12. The principal setup of the model compound K3P3 is comparable to that of 4-Sm: the P3 unit is surrounded by the strongly positive charged potassium cations in a complicated three dimensional manner due to their electrostatic repulsions. Still, in K3P3 the structural parameters nicely reect those in 4-Sm: P\u2013P bond distances are calculated to be 2.213 and 2.306 \u00c5, the SEN (P\u2013P) are determined to be 1.23 and 1.09. Comparison of the P\u2013P bond distances and SEN in 2-Smwith those of 4-Sm furthermore supports the idea of a slight aromatic character in the former system. To sum up, in both compounds 2-Sm and 4-Sm the cyclo-[P3] 3\u2212 and cyclo-[P4] 2\u2212 units are best described as polyphosphide anions stabilized by counterions through mainly polar bonding contributions."

We, therefore, investigated the magnetic properties of 4-Dy by means of SQUID magnetometry alongside ab initio CASSCF calculations. Full details of the methodology can be found in the ESI.\u2020\nOur rst attempt at calculating the molecular properties was performed following a common approach, replacing one DyIII with a diamagnetic YIII and keeping the molecular structure as it is obtained from XRD methods. For 4-Dy, however, the CASSCF procedure did not converge and we therefore opted to carry out the calculations based on a ctional Dy\u2013Y compound (4-Dy*) in which we replaced the peripheral methyl and tert-butyl groups on the NON ligands with hydrogen atoms, as well as the iso-propyl groups on the DIPP groups with methyl (Fig. 7, le). The results of the single ion calculation showed a strongly axial ground state characterised by gx = 0.01, gy = 0.02 and gz = 19.64 with the wave function being mainly composed ofmJ = 15/2, but showing some admixing ofmJ= 11/2 (Table S12, ESI\u2020). This mixing suggests that quantum tunnelling within the ground state is possible, which is also conrmed by the relatively high transition probability of the ground state (Fig. 7, middle). The rst excited Kramers doublet is found at 151.0 cm\u22121 (217.25 K) with g-values gx = 0.36, gy = 0.67 and gz = 15.76. The main magnetic axis is only tilted 1.79\u00b0 in respect to that of the ground state (Fig. 7, right), which can be an indicator that magnetic relaxation might occur via higher excited states. However, the state's wave function shows strong admixing (19%) ofmJ= 9/2, which lets us assume that relaxation will mainly occur through this state (Table S13, ESI\u2020).\nThe static magnetic behaviour of 4-Dy was tested on a sample in a ame sealed NMR tube upon cooling from 300 K to 2 K under an applied eld of 0.1 T and through measurements of the molar magnetisation up to 7 T at temperatures 2, 3, 4 and 5 K. The behaviour of the susceptibility product cmolT against temperature\nined for 4-Dy* and transition probabilities within the low lying Kramers e orientation on the Y-position is deduced by the molecular symmetry.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Note that the absolute values of cmolT and themagnetisation given in Fig. 8 have been scaled up in order to allow simulations, vide infra. The observed room temperature value of cmolT was 20.16 cm3 K mol\u22121, which is only about 71% of the expected value for two uncoupled DyIII ions of 28.34 cm3 Kmol\u22121. We believe that this error is introduced through sample preparation, as we have experienced it before and the handling of very small amounts of sample inside a glove box can lead to big percentage errors very quickly.64 However, in further discussion of dynamic behaviour and simulation of the data, introducing a correction factor as we did does not inuence the results. Employing the crystal eld parameters obtained from the single ion CASSCF calculation (Table S13\u2020) rotated onto a common reference frame, we performed a simultaneous t of cmolT(T) and M(H) using a single isotropic exchange. An almost perfect t for cmolT(T) and good agreement around lower elds for M(H) was obtained with Jiso = \u22122.96 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm\u22121 (employing a -2J formalism), conrming our initial assumption of antiferromagnetic interactions.\nThe dynamic behaviour of 4-Dy was tested at low temperatures under application of an oscillating magnetic eld (3.5 Oe). A peak in the frequency-dependent out-of-phase susceptibility was observed around 200Hz at 2 K (Fig. 8, right). Upon the application of additional DC elds, the signal vanished quickly.

Note that we performed the Arrhenius t employing eqn (1), leaving out the commonly employed CTn Raman-term, as we already obtained a very good t employing only Orbach and QTM processes.\ns\u22121 = s0\u22121 exp(\u2212Ueff/kBT) + sQTM\u22121 (1)\nWe estimated the blocking temperature TB as the temperature at which s = 100 s and found TB = 3.17 K. This is in good agreement with hysteresis loops that we recorded, in which the hysteresis is slightly open at 2 K but essentially closed already at 3 K (Fig. S42, ESI\u2020). The experimental energy barrier of 36.8 cm\u22121 seems extremely low, given the expected relaxation pathway through the rst excited state at 151 cm\u22121. However, it has been shown before that single ion CASSCF calculations oen fall short when predicting the relaxation barrier of polynuclear compounds.

We believe the rather poor SMM behavior is a consequence of the NON-ligand producing an unfavorable ligand eld for DyIII as well as causing misalignment of the easy axes. As this is the rst report of a polyphosphide containing SMM we are excited to see what other possibilities for SMMs these structural motifs will bring in the future."

As products, organo-lanthanide polyphosphides with an aromatic cyclo-[P4] 2\u2212 (2-Ln, Ln= Sm, Yb) as well as a cyclo-[P3] 3\u2212 (4-Ln, Ln = Y, Sm, Dy) Zintl anion were isolated and characterized. The synthetic route of a one-pot reaction allowed the isolation of felement polyphosphides beyond utilization of relatively stable, classical divalent Sm and Yb compounds. This led to the characterization of the rst polyphosphide bridged dinuclear DyIII SMM (4-Dy). Furthermore, we have shown the reduction of the cyclo-[P4] 2\u2212 moiety to form a cyclo-[P3] 3\u2212 Zintl anion in the coordination sphere of two lanthanides by reacting 2-Sm with potassium."
