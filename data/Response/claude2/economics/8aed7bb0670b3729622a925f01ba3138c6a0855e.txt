 Here is a short story:

It was a sunny day in the forest when the young fawn woke up. He blinked his eyes open and lifted his head, his ears twitching as he listened to the sounds of the morning. Somewhere nearby, birds were singing. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the trees. The fawn got to his feet, his skinny legs wobbling a bit before finding their strength. He took a few steps and sniffed the air. His mother was close by, he could smell her familiar scent. The fawn walked through the lush green ferns and wildflowers until he found her grazing in a sunny clearing. He scampered over to her side and nestled against her, feeling the comfort of her warmth. She looked down at him with her big, dark eyes and made a soft noise, welcoming her baby to the new day. The fawn nuzzled up to her and began to drink her milk, his little white-spotted sides rising and falling as he filled his belly. Milk dripped down his chin as he drank his fill. Full and content, the fawn then frolicked in the meadow, kicking up his heels as he played. He chased butterflies and rolled joyfully in the sweet clover. The forest was his playground and he relished this magical place. When the sun rose high in the sky, the fawn grew sleepy. He made his way back over to his mother and curled up by her hooves, resting his head on his forelegs. His eyes fluttered closed and he napped in the dappled sunlight, nestled safely against her side. The young fawn dreamed of the days ahead in his forest home as his mother kept watch over her precious, playful baby.
