            "text": "Chemical syntheses with ionic solids as starting materials and/ or products are usually performed either in solution or via solid-state reactions.1 To this regard, the diffusion of ions either requires a dissolution of the ionic solid with formation of solvato complexes or an increased Brownian motion in the solid state at elevated temperature. Two recent developments allow to expand the toolbox for chemical syntheses significantly. On the one hand, ionic liquids as polar and weakly coordinating solvents offer the option for reactions near room temperature (r100 1C) without the necessity to form solvato complexes for the dissolution of the starting materials.1,2 Here, the realization of a range of spectacular compounds already impressively illustrated the benefit of ionic liquids for chemical synthesis.3 On the other hand, organo-metal halides with large organic cations and inorganic complex anions turned out to be well-soluble in organic solvents such as DMSO or DMF.4 Here, methylammonium lead iodide ([CH3NH3]PbI3) is a most prominent example,5 which \u2013 in addition to the advantage of its high efficiency as a solar absorber \u2013 can be processed in solution (e.g., DMF, DMSO).4 Beside solid-state reactions and solution-based synthesis, a room-temperature synthesis of ionic solids in absence of additional solvents is rare.\nFor [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] (BMPyr: 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium), we observed that the synthesis can be performed already at room temperature, simply by mixing the starting materials [BMPyr]Cl and SnCl2. The course of the reaction can be followed by the naked eye based on the red emission of [BMPyr]2[SnCl4], whose intensity correlates with its proceeding formation. [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] shows an unusual disphenoidal [SnCl4]\n2 anion and, after optimized reaction, intense deepred Sn2+-based emission with an unexpected high quantum yield of 88 3%.\nThe synthesis of [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] was performed by reacting [BMPyr]Cl and SnCl2 with 2 : 1 ratio according to the following reaction: 2 [BMPyr]Cl + SnCl2 - [BMPyr]2[SnCl4].\u00a7 The reaction occurs already at room temperature when mixing the starting materials (Fig. 1(a)). The formation of [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] is indicated by the occurring red-light emission and its increasing intensity. The product formation can be followed even with the naked eye (Fig. 1(b)). With intense mixing (see ESI\u2021), the synthesis is completed on a timescale of about 30 seconds. Whereas room-temperature mixing results in microcrystalline powder samples, crystallinity and emission intensity can be of course enhanced by certain heating.

Commun., 2023, 59, 11113\u201311116 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nor 80 1C for 6 hours result in macroscopic colourless and transparent single crystals with a size up to 1 mm3.\nAccording to single-crystal structure analysis, [BMPyr]2 [SnCl4] crystallizes with the monoclinic space group C2/c (ESI,\u2021 Table S1) and consists of [BMPyr]+ cations and slightly distorted disphenoidal [SnCl4]\n2 anions (Fig. 2(a)). The disphenoidal geometry is in accordance with the valence-shell-electron-pairrepulsion (VSEPR) model and reflects the presence of four Sn\u2013Cl bonds and the lone-electron pair at SnII+, which together result in a distorted pseudo-trigonal-bipyramidal arrangement (Fig. 2(b)). Two shorter Sn\u2013Cl distances of 246.4(1) pm (Sn\u2013Cl2) are observed for the equatorial positions, whereas two longer distances of 281.9(1) pm (Sn\u2013Cl1) occur for the axial positions. In principle, [SnCl4]\n2 was observed before in compounds such as [Co(NH3)6][SnCl4][Cl].\n6 In comparison to literature data (ESI,\u2021 Table S2), however, the [SnCl4]\n2 anion in the title compound exhibits a higher symmetry with identical Sn\u2013Cl distances on the equatorial and axial positions (Fig. 2(b)). [Co(NH3)6][SnCl4][Cl], for instance, shows different Sn\u2013Cl distances for both positions (equatorial Sn\u2013Cl with 246.7 and 252.6 pm; axial Sn\u2013Cl with 266.9 and 300.3 pm).6c The Clax\u2013 Sn\u2013Clax and Cleq\u2013Sn\u2013Cleq angles in the [SnCl4]\n2 anion are 179.2(1)1 and 93.8(1)1, which reflects the influence of the lone electron pair at Sn2+. Like the Sn\u2013Cl distances, these angles are different from literature data (e.g. [Co(NH3)6][SnCl4][Cl]: Clax\u2013 Sn\u2013Clax: 164.71, Cleq\u2013Sn\u2013Cleq: 901).\n6 All distances in the [BMPyr]+ cation are as expected and not discussed in detail (ESI,\u2021 Fig. S1).\nBeside single crystal structure analysis, composition and purity of [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] were validated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry (DTA-TG). EDXS shows the expected Sn : Cl ratio of 1 : 4. Most of the vibrations observed in FT-IR spectra can be related to the [BMPyr]+ cation (Fig. 3(a) and ESI,\u2021 Fig. S2). Furthermore, a strong vibration at 500 cm 1 originates from n(Sn\u2013Cl).7 Finally, the absence of any absorption at 3600\u20133000 cm 1 should be noticed and points to the absence of OH-related vibrations.\nThermally, [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] turned out to be stable up to 200 1C (Fig. 3(b)). Thereafter, two-step decomposition occurs\nwith a total mass loss of 87.6%, which can be related to the decomposition of the organic cation and the evaporation of SnCl4 after disproportionation of Sn(II) to Sn(0) and Sn(IV) (calculated: 89.1%). Tin metal is observed as black solid remain with 12.4% (calculated: 10.9%). Interestingly, differential thermal analysis (DTA) does not show any endothermal peak indicating the melting point of the title compound below its thermal decomposition at 200 1C (Fig. 3(b)). Both starting materials have melting points Z200 1C, too ([BMPyr]Cl: 198 1C; SnCl2: 246 1C).\n2,6a,8 Thus, starting materials and product can be excluded as potential liquid phases supporting a reaction at room temperature. In fact, [BMPyr][SnCl3] \u2013 formed as a first step of the Lewis acid\u2013base reaction of [BMPyr]Cl and SnCl2 \u2013 can be considered to be the compound with the lowest melting point (at about 80 1C).6a,9 When taking a further reduction of the melting point for eutectic mixtures of [BMPyr][SnCl3] with the starting materials and/or the product into account, they can be expected to induce the roomtemperature reaction and formation of [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] just by mixing or at slightly elevated temperature. Finally, it must be noticed that [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] \u2013 although being a solid \u2013 is a soft, sticky compound.\nWhile the red emission of [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] could be already used to visualize its formation (Fig. 1(b)), the optical properties were examined in more detail after optimized synthesis (80 1C, 6 h) with addition of minor amounts of CaCl2 (2 mol%) as a flux. First of all, UV-Vis spectra were recorded, showing a steep absorption below 380 nm (Fig. 4(a)). Such steep absorption also points to the high crystallinity of the compound although prepared at low temperature.10 By plotting the absorption coefficient (F(R)hn)2 versus (hn) in a Tauc plot, an indirect allowed optical band gap of 3.75 eV can be determined\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Emission spectra show intense deep-red emission at 600\u2013850 nm with its maximum at 740 nm (Fig. 5(a)). This emission can be related to a 5s1p1 - 5s2p0 transition on Sn2+.12 The binary SnCl2 also shows such Sn\n2+-based emission (lmax: 600 nm), but \u2013 in contrast to [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] \u2013 together with conductionband to valence-band emission (lmax: 460 nm) of equal intensity.11 Even more important, the emission of SnCl2 is almost completely quenched at room temperature and becomes efficient only r60 K.13\nQualitatively, the red emission can be visualized after excitation with a mercury discharge lamp (lex: 366 nm) or a UV-LED (lex: 280\u2013350 nm) (Fig. 5(b)). The photoluminescence process was quantified by determining the absolute quantum yield following the method given by Friend et al.14 Accordingly, a surprisingly high quantum yield of 25\u201330% was already obtained after room-temperature synthesis and simple mixing of the starting materials (Fig. 1). With an optimised synthesis (80 1C, 6 h, addition of 2% of CaCl2 as a flux), a remarkable quantum yield of 88 3% was obtained. This value belongs to the highest quantum yields reported for Sn2+-based emission.15\nIn principle Sn2+-based emission is well-known and can be very efficient as a parity-allowed s\u2013p transition.12,15b Examples, first of all, include conventional lamp phosphors such as Ba2Li2Si2O7:Sn 2+, Ca3(PO4)2:Sn 2+ or Ca5(PO4)3F:Sn\n2+ (Table 1).15b,16 In difference to [BMPyr]2[SnCl4], herein, Sn\n2+ is present only as a dopant (1\u20135 mol%) to avoid concentration quenching.12,15b Moreover, metal oxides with high lattice energy are applied and prepared at high temperature (Z500 1C) to guarantee high crystallinity and low defect concentration and, in sum, to realize a high quantum yield.15b,16 In addition to conventional phosphors, organo-tin halides came up with the discovery of methylammonium lead iodide and also can show luminescence.15a In particular, this holds for organo-tin halides with the heavier halogens bromine and iodine (Table 1). Due to their small bandgap, these compounds show semiconductor-type conduction-band to valence-band emission instead of Sn2+-based s\u2013p transition (Table 1).15a,17 High quantum yields (480%) of such semiconductor-type luminescence are specifically observed for spatially restricted systems, such as quantum dots (0 D)18 or nanolayers (2 D)19 (Table 1).\nIn difference to bromides and iodides, the quantum yield of organo-tin chlorides is low (r20%).20 Taken together, a quantum yield Z50% for s\u2013p-based emission as observed for [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] with molar amounts of Sn\n2+ tin is unusual. The high quantum yield is even more surprising taking the low temperature of synthesis and the limited lattice energy into account. The promising luminescence of [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] can be attributed to the good crystallization even at low temperature and the low sensitivity to lattice defects. Furthermore, the large-sized cation leads to a large distance between the luminescent Sn2+ centres (shortest Sn2+ Sn2+ distance: 890.2(2) pm), so that concentration quenching is avoided despite of molar quantities of Sn2+.\nSimilar to organo-metal halides like [CH3NH3]PbI3, 4 [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] is also soluble in DMSO or DMF, which offers the option for solvent-based processing. As a proof-of-theconcept, here, a solution of the title compound in DMSO was deposited on a glass plate (Fig. 5(c)). After slow evaporation of\nFig. 5 Luminescence of [BMPyr]2[SnCl4]: (a) excitation (monitored at lem: 740 nm) and emission spectra (recorded at lex: 320 nm); (b) photo of crystals in daylight and with UV-excitation (lex: 366 nm); (c) thinfilm on glass plate in daylight and with UV-excitation (lex: 366 nm).\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Based on its simple synthesis, intense emission, high quantum yield and optional solvent processing, [BMPyr]2 [SnCl4] could become interesting as a luminescent material for deep-red or infrared emitting LEDs.21\nIn conclusion, [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] is obtained as a novel organo-tin(II) halide. The compound can be prepared just by mixing of the starting materials [BMPyr]Cl and SnCl2 at room temperature, which can be followed by the increasing deep-red Sn2+-based emission (lmax: 740 nm). Even after mixing at room temperature, a quantum yield of 25\u201330% was achieved. With optimised synthesis conditions (i.e., 80 1C, 6 h, addition of 2% of CaCl2 as a flux), a quantum yield of 88 3% was obtained, which is extraordinarily high for Sn2+-based emission, in general. The reaction proceeds with quantitative yield and without addition of solvents. It is promoted by [BMPyr][SnCl3] (forming an eutectic with starting materials and/or product) as intermediately formed ionic liquid, whereas the starting materials as well as the product exhibit melting points Z200 1C. In addition to the unusual synthesis near room temperature (r100 1C) via a simple reaction with quantitative yield, the deep-red emission (600\u2013850 nm) and the high quantum yield (88 3%) as well as optional solvent processing potentially can make [BMPyr]2[SnCl4] interesting as a luminescent material for deep-red or infrared emitting thinfilms and LEDs.\nThe authors thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for funding within the project \u2018\u2018Crown ether coordination compounds with unusual structural and optical properties (Crown I)\u2019\u2019."
