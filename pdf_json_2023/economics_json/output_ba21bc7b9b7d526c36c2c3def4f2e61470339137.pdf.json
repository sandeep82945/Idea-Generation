For decades, the prevalence has remained persistently high across all age-sex groups including women, children, and adolescents [1]. Iron deficiency and insufficient intake of micronutrients such as folate and vitamin B12 are identified as the leading cause of anemia both in India and globally [2\u20134]. Accordingly, public health efforts have relied extensively on large-scale prophylactic iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation programs to control anemia. India had launched the National Nutritional Anemia Prophylaxis Program (NNAPP) as early as 1972. However, the program could not make much impact because of multifaceted problems such as poor coverage, substandard drug quality, non-adherence with consumption, poor implementation of the program, inadequate supplies, inadequate funds for overall coverage, lack of training of health functionaries, lack of community participation, lack of program monitoring and supervision [5, 6]. Poor training exposure and organizational support for capacity building attribute to weak knowledge and competency in supply chain functions and undermine the capacity to perform essential supply chain functions [7].\nNevertheless, the Government of India remains committed toward programmatic efforts to address anemia with time-to-time re-strategizing the approach toward anemia prevention and control. This includes landmark initiatives such as the National Nutritional Anemia Control Programme (NNACP) in 1991, National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) of 2013 and Intensified National Iron Plus Initiative (INIPI) of 2018. The INIPI is also referred to as Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy and is an integral part of the Prime Minister\u2019s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nutrition in India (POSHAN) Abhiyaan [8]. The AMB framework is guided by a 6x6x6 strategy that signifies its focus on six beneficiary groups, six treatment alternatives and six institutional mechanisms. Prophylactic IFA supplementation is an integral part of the 6x6x6 strategy to cover the six beneficiary groups, viz. children (6\u201359 months), adolescent girls\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279827 February 24, 2023 2 / 18\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n(15\u201319 years), adolescent boys (10\u201319 years), women of reproductive age (WRA), pregnant women and lactating mothers. The AMB programme for IFA supplementation serves 26 million pregnant women, 13 million lactating mothers, and 73 million school-age children and adolescents (5\u201319 years) and 17 million children under of 5\u201369 months [9].\nThe delivery of IFA supplementation services under AMB critically depends on the supply\nchain and the strategy must overcome supply-related challenges and shortcomings to promote effective coverage. The supply chain is unable to provide drugs efficiently and effectively [5, 6]. The delayed procurement and lack of trained human resources are affecting the coverage of the IFA supplies and thus overall supply chain management [10]. Furthermore, generally it suffers from considerable gaps in the distribution process, shortage of drugs at health facilities and lack of availability of IFA for the beneficiaries [11\u201313]. The supply chain management practices also vary across contexts and geographies [14, 15]. Recognizing this as a serious concern, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has identified strengthening of supply chain and logistics a key institutional mechanism under AMB [16]. Notably, the IFA supply chain is also a marker of performance of the public health supply chain that requires coordination and convergence across line departments such as health, education and women and child development. The AMB strategy, therefore, deserves detailed attention to enable the beneficiaries to receive IFA supplements in time and prevent adverse implications of iron deficiency [17].\nEvidence on the performance of the public health supply chain in India is limited, with a\nfew state-level studies as exceptions. A recent cross-sectional, observational, mixed-methods study conducted in Bihar highlighted bottlenecks impacting IFA forecasting, procurement, storage, disposal, lack of personnel, and few training opportunities for key players in the supply chain [11]. A similar study was conducted in Odisha to assess the logistic performance of multiple drug supply chains [18]. A few studies attempt to understand the factors influencing the public health supply chain while some suggest different models for measuring public health supply chain performance [19\u201324]. The medicines distribution model in Tamil Nadu in India is an example of a high-performance public-sector supply chain achieved through capacity building and management [25]. Some studies also examine the last mile challenges that deprive the beneficiaries of IFA supplements [12, 13].\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comparative pan-India evidence to\nunderstand the prevalent practices in the IFA supply chain across the different states in India and to identify the bottlenecks associated with the supply chain of each of the states. Against this backdrop, this paper presents the key findings from the nationwide supply chain diagnostic assessment with the following specific objectives: a) to identify the key practices adopted by states in the IFA supply chain; b) to identify bottlenecks in each of the major supply chain functions of forecasting, procurement, warehousing and inventory management, transportation and distribution and logistics management information system, and; c) to develop specific policy recommendations for strengthening of the IFA supply chain. The findings of the paper are expected to improve understanding of the IFA supplementation supply chain across Indian states and can contribute by highlighting the bottlenecks and areas for correction action."

The assessment was supported by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and the line departments from the state governments responsible for implementing the AMB strategy. The assessment was led by the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG), Delhi and was conducted in collaboration with six development partners viz. Evidence\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279827 February 24, 2023 3 / 18\nAction, IPE Global, Nutrition International, UNDP and UNICEF. The study and study protocols were approved by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India. All participants included in the study are adults and were asked for written informed consent for interviews.\nFor the field-based assessment, two districts from each of the 29 states were selected. Aspirational districts were given priority for selection as these districts are specifically focused by the union and the state governments for a quick transformation of developmental indicators [26]. If a state had only one Aspirational district, a district with higher anemia prevalence as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS, 2015\u201316) was selected [1]. The same criteria were considered while choosing two districts of a state having more than two aspirational districts. In addition to the above, the presence of partner agencies (who would conduct the field assessment) was also considered in finalizing the districts by following the study criteria. Recommendations from the union and state governments were also taken into account while finalizing the districts. A total of 58 districts were selected for the assessment (S1 Table in S1 Data). Within each district, two administrative blocks were selected based on the distance of the blocks from the district headquarter. This criterion was adopted with intent to capture supply chain experience of blocks from both semi-urban as well as rural far-to-reach blocks. Accordingly, a total of 116 blocks were covered (S1 Fig).\nFurther, within each block two health sub-centres (SC) were selected for tracking the distribution of IFA red tablets for pregnant and lactating mothers, two anganwadi centres (AWC), courtyard shelters under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), scheme operated by community-level frontline workers (FLW) were selected to track IFA syrup distribution for children 6\u201359 months and IFA blue tablets for out-of-school adolescent girls (10\u201319 years). The sample also included two government schools from each block to study the last mile delivery issues with the education department. In particular, the study team visited one primary school to examine supplies for IFA pink tablets for children (5\u20139 years) and one secondary to study the experience of distribution in IFA blue tablets for adolescent boys and girls (10\u201319 years). The selections were made in consultation with the district and block-level officials. The blocks were selected based on consultation with district and block officials, but schools, facilities and AWCs were selected randomly. A total of 232 SCs, 232 AWCs, and 116 primary schools and 116 secondary schools were covered for the assessment.\nBased on the type of IFA supplement and the target beneficiary group, the interview sched-\nule was designed to capture line department-specific details. Various officials, program staff and health workers were interviewed at the state, district, block, SC, AWC and school levels. The designation of stakeholders identified for the interviews is presented in S2 Table in S1 Data. The survey data was collected through KoBo collect tool. The interviews aimed at understanding the roles and responsibilities of the officials in various components of the supply chain management such as forecasting, procurement, distribution and last mile delivery. The interview also enquired about the data and methods used for demand estimation as well as procedures adopted for procurement, warehousing and distribution of the IFA supplements. Perception of the stakeholders was also obtained on issues such as quality of procured IFA supplements and timeliness of supplies as well as situation stock availability of IFA supplements round the year. In addition, unit costs for the various IFA supplements for each state is estimated based on the procurement budget and quantities approved under the Record of Proceedings (ROPs) for the year 2018\u201319 for the National Health Mission (NHM) budget for the respective states (https://nhm.gov.in/).\nDescriptive statistical analysis is used to examine the patterns in unit costs as well as other\nimportant parameters of the assessment. Lead time i.e., the time taken to complete a cycle of IFA procurements and distribution (from forecasting to last mile distribution) is estimated\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279827 February 24, 2023 4 / 18\nbased on the information received on the time requirements and lags at each stage. The IFA supplementation coverage is assessed for the year 2018\u201319 based on the Health Management Information System (HMIS) indicators (https://hmis.nhp.gov.in/#!/). In particular, the following indicators are used: a) HMIS 9.9 for children (6\u201359 months) provided 8\u201310 doses (1ml) of IFA syrup (bi-weekly); b) HMIS 23.1 and 23.3 for school-going and out-of-schoolchildren (5\u2013 9 years) covered under Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS) Junior; c) HMIS 22.1.1 for adolescent boys and girls (10\u201319 years) covered under WIFS, and; d) HMIS 1.2.4 for coverage among pregnant women (PW).\nThe indent gap is estimated as the difference between the estimated target beneficiaries\nextracted from AMB dashboard (www.anemiamuktbharat.info) and the actual indent estimate used by the states for the procurements. The AMB target has been taken from the drug required for the particular state as per the AMB dashboard. The \"indent\" and \"receipt\" data is collected through the information ascertained during the assessment for the actual indent placed and quantity received during the year by the state for each IFA category. If the data was not received from the state, the same has been taken from the HMIS (total stock received for the year) as uploaded by the state."

The coverage varied with major gaps in coverage of children from schools and AWCs in most of the states. For instance, 23 out of 36 states/UTs reported less than 5% coverage of IFA syrup among children under five. Similarly, 22 states/UTs had less than 5% coverage of IFA pink tables provided under the WIFS Junior component for children 5\u20139 years. The coverage of IFA supplementation among pregnant women was also a concern and varied from 15.6% in Nagaland to almost full coverage in Assam.\nIFA supply chain lead time index\nLead time is a fundamental indicator to gauge the efficiency of a supply chain. This indicator represents the total time taken by the state from forecasting to the actual delivery to the last mile (delivery points like School, Sub Center, and Anganwadi). The shorter the lead time the more efficient the supply chain. The timeline for various components of the supply chain activities is collected from the State Officials in the National IFA Supply Chain Diagnostic Assessment, 2019. The total lead time (in weeks) is the sum of the total lead time of each activity involved\u2013indent compilation, tender/purchase order, procurement, distribution till districts and the last-mile delivery. The lead time index varies from 18 weeks in Goa to 62 weeks in Uttarakhand (Table 2). Most of the states require 6\u20138 months to complete a supply chain cycle. In terms of the various components of the supply chain, the process of indent compilation and last-mile delivery takes relatively lesser time than other aspects. With a few exceptions (Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh), indent compilation in most states is completed within a month.\nSimilarly, the last mile delivery usually takes about 2\u20134 weeks though it can be higher in certain hilly regions. The tendering process for procurements (quotations and selection of suppliers) is completed in about three months though certain inter-state variations are noted. In some states (like Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttarakhand), the process of finalizing a purchase order requires more than four months. Procurement and delivery to designated warehouses also take about 2\u20133 months. Block-level distribution is completed within a month though it is a major problem in states with hilly terrain or poor road infrastructure.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279827 February 24, 2023 5 / 18"

Each of the major supply chain functions of forecasting, procurement, warehousing and inventory management, transportation and distribution and logistics management information system needed to be analyzed critically to understand the requirements of the supply chain and develop insights and policy recommendations for strengthening of the IFA Supply Chain. The main findings of the assessment are discussed as follows.\nLack of standardized forecasting process\nThere was no standard formula for arriving at the annual estimates for IFA drugs. The variations across states show that no uniform forecasting process is being followed. There is a need for a standard forecasting method that should be established across states to ensure a minimum gap between actual demand and procured quantity. The proportion in which each factor was being used to arrive at the final indent was not clearly defined and differed across states. According to AMB guidelines, the state has to estimate 100% consumption and plan for full procurement. Yet, because of wastage and non-consumption, many states do not procure on estimated supplies. Factors like actual program coverage and stock-in-hand were not taken into account for forecasting. The lack of clarity often leads to gaps in estimated demand and actual demand. Lack of availability of consumption data was also a major bottleneck in ascertaining the validity of these estimates. Although districts prepare and submit indents at their level, the final estimates are made on the basis of population figures. The review of the forecasted estimates and supplies estimation by a specific department is missing in most cases. Apart from this, the forecasting is majorly affected by the estimated denominators (target beneficiaries) which is a major concern."

The main objective of this setup was to procure drugs at minimum cost and ensure timely delivery. But the procurement process is a lengthy, time-consuming task and prone to procedural delays. It has the maximum contribution in the total lead time for the IFA supply chain. While populated states find suppliers ready to deliver drugs at low costs, a number of smaller states especially the Northeastern states find it difficult to procure at lower costs. This is due to a low drug requirement and partly due to transportation costs involved in delivering across difficult-to-reach terrains. Therefore, these states have to rely on supplies from Central public sector units (PSUs), which are often delayed and results in stock-outs at health facilities. This activity also gets delayed because of absence of certified labs in the vicinity. The procurement for IFA in most of the States is an annual affair with the single lowest bidder being selected for procurement. However, dependency on a single lowest bidder may result in delays if the supplier defaults or cannot meet the commitments due to capacity constraints. There is no backup option in such a case and the whole supply chain is affected adversely. Another issue in the procurement process was the delay in releasing funds which affects the procurement process adversely. It also affects the relationship with the suppliers who are more willing to supply to states where payment is made promptly or within the stipulated time."

The warehouses were usually understaffed with insufficient staff/helpers for handling and loading stocks at warehouses. Another major issue health facilities face is the lack of proper storage, especially at the Block or CHC level. The limited storage available at CHCs is used for vaccines and other essential drugs.

IFA supplies are generally clubbed with other drugs and are adjusted as per the available space in the transport vehicle. Inadequate availability of transport vehicles often resulted in delays. In the absence of a definite schedule or plan of distribution, the supplies are made on an ad hoc basis or on the basis of stock availability. Further, the distribution and timing of supplies to health facilities was not based on the request or requirement from lower levels but instead on the delivery of stocks from the supplier and on the availability of transport vehicles. The distribution system for IFA drugs does not follow a pull-based (demand-driven) mechanism. It was also observed that the quantity distributed is not based on requirement but is instead distributed in equal amount across all facilities. Flexibility in distribution at the block level is desirable to ensure quick responses to cater to demand at the service delivery points but these decisions have to be based on some logical thinking.

With the exception of two southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, other states had DVDMS platform implemented till the district level and some states have it till health facility level, though not updated on a real-time basis. The mode of MIS is manual and data updation is done on a monthly basis which further limits the availability of real-time data. It is observed that at the peripheral levels, the stock registers are not maintained properly which makes it impossible to retrieve reliable consumption data."

In few states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the village health nurse (VHN) delivered the IFA supplies to schools while in other states, the IFA blue and pink supplies were delivered to the block education department and the nodal teacher then collects the IFA supplies during monthly meetings at the education department. It was observed that the delivery using the health workforce like village health nurse facilitated better monitoring of the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279827 February 24, 2023 13 / 18\nprogram. It also minimized the dependency on education department for reporting. While in states where delivery had to be made through the education department, there were delays in collecting reports. There is a need for better coordination between the two departments to ensure availability of timely reports and stock data. Again, absence of an automated information system makes the system dependent on manual reports. Manual reporting is often delayed, prone to manual errors, and does not provide Real-time data, making monitoring the supply chain difficult. Absence of manual reporting formats/forms at peripheral level led to further delays and inaccurate program coverage data."

The assessment covered only two districts in each state which gave an indicative picture of the supply chain practices but a larger number would have further substantiated the findings. The concept of an integrated supply chain encompasses both extremes of the supply chain; however, for this assessment, manufacturers and suppliers were not included as it focused more on supply chain management. The assessment focused on the functional areas of the supply chain like forecasting, procurement, inventory management, and transportation and information system. The lead time and its component are the assessed only for one year (2018\u20132019), it is not representing the lead time for all the years. The assessment of lead time must be ensured every year to compare either it is improving or not. Finally, budgeting, financing and supply chain costs were not part of the assessment."

            "text": "Building flexibility, diffused accountability, reducing multiple levels of the supply chain, and insertion of well-trained human resources are necessary for effective management of the public health supply chain [27]. It is also necessary to understand the interaction of health system elements like governance, financing, and information system with the supply chain and their effect on the coverage, quality, efficiency, and equity of the services. Program managers should be equipped with geo-visual analytics that integrates health and supply chain indicators with geographic mapping to provide a system-wide view [28]. Lack of timely, accurate and reliable information can render any supply chain ineffective [29]. The IFA supply chain suffers in the absence of an efficient information system. Linking long-term planning with a monitoring and evaluation framework and tactical indicators can enable evidence-driven decisions. An ideal health supply chain would integrate people and processes with adequate technology [30].\nThe efforts on strengthening the public health supply chain in India have primarily focused\non the upper echelons of the supply chain. These reforms were done on two fronts. The first was to streamline the procurement process to ensure timely procurement of drugs. The second was to ensure warehousing infrastructure at the state level. States have set up procurement agencies with the standardized process, e-tendering and bidding. State and regional warehouses have also been set up to ensure coverage to all districts. However, supply chain management at the Block or village level has remained untouched. The supply chain at these levels is shared by different drugs with each having specific requirements for its delivery to the beneficiaries. Operational efficiencies at the block or village level are critical to the success of the supply chain. In the case of IFA drugs, the IFA blue has a substantially different delivery requirement than IFA red or even IFA syrup. Also, supply chain functions at these levels majorly involve replenishment, distribution and information management. The distribution of IFA blue and pink in most of the state it is conducted through education department other\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279827 February 24, 2023 14 / 18\nthan only the health department used to supply. The concerned officials of the education department are supposed to distribute across the schools. Hence, there is a difference in the distribution last mile delivery mechanism for IFA blue and pink.\nBased on the findings, below are key policy recommendations that may help improve the\nefficiency of the IFA supply chain. The agenda includes changes that are needed to reform the IFA supply chain as well as strategies to improve operational performance within the current system.\n\u2022 The upper echelons of the supply chain are connected through the DVDMS system while the\nblock level and below facilities are not connected with this system and instead has to depend on a manual recording system. There is a need to connect the block level facilities and the service delivery points (SDPs) like Anganwadi, Schools and sub-centers with the main DVDMS system to make real-time information sharing possible. This would facilitate timely availability of information, quick response of stock-outs at SDPs, beneficiary coverage, minimum errors and informed decision making at all levels.\n\u2022 Inter-department coordination (between Health, RBSK and Education department) was also\none of the challenges observed for the IFA supply chain. It would be good to have a state and district task force for AMB to represent RBSK, Education, and other line departments.\n\u2022 It was observed that the store managers and pharmacist in charge of the warehouse were not\ntrained in inventory management concepts. Basic concepts like minimum inventory level, reorder level, average monthly consumption was not employed while making decisions regarding supplies. Staff at each level should be introduced to the system concepts and trained to manage inventory replenishment, distribution, and information flows. Every person involved in the chain must be able to understand their individual role.\n\u2022 The unavailability of transport vehicles was seen as a standard issue at most of the levels.\nThis results in delays in distribution, higher costs and stock-outs. A Specialized third-party logistics provider can be employed by the state and district program teams to take care of the delivery of drugs. In developing countries, case studies on outsourcing transportation for vaccines have shown positive results in achieving better efficiency at minimized costs [31].\n\u2022 Continuous monitoring is important through monthly/quarterly review meetings at the dis-\ntrict level. Program Officers should conduct a review meeting of each block based on their stock distributed, stock availability, and stock out incidences. Timelines should be fixed for corrective actions and followed up in subsequent meetings to maximize the efficiency of supply chain processes."

            "text": "The IFA supply chain assessment has brought forth many issues in the supply chain. It has reestablished the need for an action plan to iron out the inefficiencies present in the current setup. The systematic assessment of each functional area gives us a clear understanding of the bottlenecks at each level. It would require active leadership and involvement from all the stakeholders to draw out a road map to strengthen the IFA supply chain. Clear and well-defined interventions focusing on specific bottlenecks need to be developed and pursued with rigor. There is a need for practical and viable solutions that can be implemented in the field. Academic and research institutions and development partner agencies need to collaborate and combine their expertise to come out with a clear set of actions and interventions that would ensure the delivery of essential health and nutrition services to the last beneficiary.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279827 February 24, 2023 15 / 18\nFurther research in this area should include the development of a supply chain review\nframework for measuring the performance on both cost and service level efficiency. A performance matrix may be developed for each level customized to the individual requirements at each level. Measurement of key performance indicators and their determinants would also help streamline the policy efforts."
