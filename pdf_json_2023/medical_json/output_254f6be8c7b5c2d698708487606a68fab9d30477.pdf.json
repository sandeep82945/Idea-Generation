    "abstractText": "Prenatal exposure to metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) has been linked to birth weight, but the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated gene expressions and biological pathways underlying the associations between MDCs and birth weight, using microarray transcriptomics, in a Belgian birth cohort. Whole cord blood measurements of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p\u2019-DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls 153 (PCB-153), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and transcriptome profiling were conducted in 192 mother\u2013child pairs. A workflow including a transcriptome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis with a meet-in-the-middle approach, and mediation analysis was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate gene expressions of the MDC\u2013birth weight relationship. Among 26,170 transcriptomic features, we successfully annotated five overlapping metabolism-related gene expressions associated with both an MDC and birth weight, comprising BCAT2, IVD, SLC25a16, HAS3, and MBOAT2. We found 11 overlapping pathways, and they are mostly related to genetic information processing. We found no evidence of any significant mediating effect. In conclusion, this exploratory study provides insights into transcriptome perturbations that may be involved in MDC-induced altered birth weight.",

            "text": "Metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) have been defined as natural or anthropogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can promote metabolic changes and ultimately lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes and/or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [1]. In line with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis [1], the prenatal period is a highly sensitive and vulnerable phase during which stressors, such as MDCs, can alter cell numbers and fate, gene expression, and protein levels that may lead to changes in tissue and organ function and contribute to increased susceptibility to a variety of non-communicable diseases later in life [2]. This may be the result of differences in toxicokinetics between children and adults and from time-dependent programming during early development [3]. Both high and low birth weight (HBW and LBW) are considered important predictors of later perturbed metabolic outcomes in children and adults [4\u20136]. While some observational studies have demonstrated associations between exposure to MDCs [including dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p\u2019-DDE), polychlorinated biphenyl-153\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7607. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24087607 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\n(PCB-153), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)] and birth weight [7\u201310], the molecular mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. The field of omics, based on high-throughput biochemical data, provides promising opportunities to advance and enhance our understanding of the impact of MDCs on child health, including by revealing changes in the gene expression using transcriptome profiling [11,12]. Assessing the effects of various chemical exposures on gene expression may help to uncover cellular mechanisms through which exposures influence the development of metabolic disorders in human populations. Several recent epidemiological studies using transcriptomics data have increased our understanding of how exposure to MDCs may perturb gene expression, and have identified regulatory pathways that may be affected by these exposures [13\u201315], as well as links between gene expression and birth weight [16\u201319]. However, to our knowledge, a study assessing the transcriptome in relation to both MDCs and birth weight in the same study population has not been performed. Based on results from our previous birth cohort study [15], several MDCs (p,p\u2019-DDE, PCB-153, PFOA, and PFOS) were suggested to play a role in transcriptional changes which are related to metabolic health outcomes. This led us to hypothesize that prenatal exposure to MDCs induces transcriptional modifications that, in turn, affect birth weight and have adverse effects on human health. Here, we aim to identify transcriptomic alterations in the cord blood of Belgian mother\u2013child pairs that are associated with both prenatal MDC levels and birth weight in order to better understand the molecular effects and the underlying mechanisms."

The majority of the mothers had completed a high level of education (59%), had a normal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2 (71%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (85%). In addition, 38% of mothers were nulliparous and 57% were above 30 years of age at delivery."

            "text": "Using a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) approach, we failed to select any features from models (1) or (2) with significance levels of false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 or 0.20, and selected only a few features with a stringent p-value < 0.01 (Table 2). In order to avoid excluding weak but possibly relevant features, we used a relatively lenient p-value < 0.05 to select features for further analyses as an exploratory study. With p-value < 0.05, we found that 2110 out of 26,170 features were associated with one or more MDCs (777, 623, 333, and 624 for p,p\u2019-DDE, PCB-153, PFOA, and PFOS, respectively; Table 2), and 775 features were associated with birth weight. A similar number of associated features were found in the sensitivity analyses of gestational age-unadjusted MDC\u2013transcriptome associations (Table S2). In addition, as shown in the volcano plots (Figure S1a\u2013e), the significance and directionality of gene expression obtained with and without adjustment for gestational age were consistent in the TWAS models for MDCs and features. At p-value < 0.05, we found overlapping features associated with an MDC (p,p\u2019-DDE, PCB-153, PFOA, or PFOS) and birth weight (12, 31, 17, and 40, respectively; Figure 1). These features were annotated to corresponding unique gene symbols, and according to the Human Protein Atlas and GeneCards [20,21], several were components of metabolism-related pathways, including branched-chain aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2) (amino acid metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; and\npantothenate and CoA biosynthesis), isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) (valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation), solute carrier family 25-A16 (SLC25A16) (pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis), Hyaluronan Synthase 3 (HAS3) (carbohydrate metabolism and glycosaminoglycan metabolism), and Membrane Bound O-Acyltransferase Domain Containing 2 (MBOAT2) (glycerophospholipid metabolism) (Table 3). However, with the mediation analysis, we did not observe any overlapping gene expression playing a significant mediating role, given the relatively large FDR values (Table 3). In addition, the individual associations of these five gene expressions with an MDC or birth weight is shown in Table S3.\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; P, percentile.\nGenes highlighted in red represent genes that are components of metabolism-related pathways.

There were 17, 3, 27, 20, and 33 pathways associated with p,p\u2019-DDE, PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, and birth weight, respectively; most of them were related to genetic information processing and organismal systems. Notably, one metabolic pathway [glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis] was linked to p,p\u2019-DDE; three [metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D)] were linked to PFOA, two [amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, type I diabetes mellitus] were linked to PFOS, and five [oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cysteine and methionine metabolism, sulfur metabolism, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation] were linked to birth weight. At FDR < 0.05, we found that four, three, six, and three pathways associated with birth weight ovrlapped with p,p\u2019-DDE, PCB-153, PFOA, and PFOS, respectively (Figure 1). They mostly belong to the \u201cgenetic information processing\u201d category in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway Database [22], and none of them were metabolismrelated pathways (Table 4). The PC1 scores used to represent pathways in the mediation analysis explained 37\u201357% of the variance in the involved genes, and given the insignificant average causal mediation effects (ACMEs) with large FDR values, we did not observe any pathway that mediated both MDC and birth weight (Table 4).\nACMEs were estimated by summarizing feature intensities with principal component, corresponding to about 50% of transcription variance in the gene set from each pathway.

            "text": "Transcriptome changes in early life may act in response to environmental exposures and subsequently lead to adverse health outcomes later in life; however, epidemiological studies are scarce. This is the first paper that evaluated the cord blood transcriptome with MDC exposures and birth weight. We examined differences in transcriptomics at the gene and pathway levels. The five gene expressions that are metabolism-related and were found to be associated with both an MDC and birth weight are BCAT2, IVD, SLC25a16, HAS3, and MBOAT2. Birth weight may be altered by an MDC through one of these gene expressions, although we did not find a mediating effect to be significant. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with the progression of obesity-related metabolic disorders [23]; additionally, BCAA catabolism is suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disturbances, and BCAT2 is an important enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of BCAA catabolism [24,25]. In a recent human study [26], BCAT2 variants were detected in Spanish infants suspected of having maple syrup urine disease\u2014a rare metabolic disorder that some babies are born with. In line with our finding on higher BCAT2 expression with high birth weight, LBW pigs were found to express less BCAT2 mRNA in the longissimus dorsi muscle compared to normal birth weight pigs [27]. Similarly, higher BCAT2 mRNA was revealed in the blastocysts of diabetic rabbits compared to control blastocysts [28]. We observed an inverse association of IVD expression with birth weight. It has been demonstrated that the deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme IVD may lead to isovaleric acidemia (IVA), an inherited metabolic disorder that may cause problems with the breakdown of the amino acid leucine [29]. Children with this condition may fail to gain weight and often experience developmental delays [30]. SLC25a16 has been considered as a carrier of Grave\u2019s disease, which causes hypothyroidism [31]. On the other hand, hypothyroidism is thought to cause HBW [32,33], which may explain the association we found between SLC25a16 and higher birth weight, but this needs to be further explored. Our results on gene expression suggest new insights into birth weight changes indirectly caused by MDCs, and also provide some support, albeit weak signals, for the existing evidence from transcriptomics\u2013birth weight research. However, it is also important to note that none of the features selected for further analyses from the TWAS models passed the FDR correction threshold; our gene expression results should therefore be viewed as exploratory and hypothesis-generating. Metabolism-related pathways linked to both an MDC and birth weight were not observed in this study. However, some results on the metabolism-related pathways associated with an MDC or birth weight are noteworthy. For PFOA, we have observed positive associations with the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and drug metabolism and inverse association with T1D. In a mouse study, PFOA was found to induce the cytochrome P450 enzyme by activating constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) nuclear receptors [34]. Another mouse study has shown that PFOA may induce drug metabolism, and then lead to liver injury [35]. For PFOS, we observed inverse associations with amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and T1D. Consistently, PFOS-induced altered amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were found in a recent zebrafish study, as well as in Hispanic children [36,37]. In a large U.S. study, PFOA and PFOS were associated with a reduced risk of T1D in adults [38], but in a recent Finnish study, they both were\nassociated with an increased risk of T1D in newborns [39]. For birth weight, lower birth weight was found to be associated with six metabolism-related pathways, comprising OXPHOS, NAFLD, cysteine and methionine metabolism, sulfur metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Consistent with our findings, LBW was shown to be associated with OXPHOS in the skeletal muscle and myotubes of Danish individuals [40,41]. A study investigating the relationship between birth weight and NAFLD, in 538 children, also showed an overrepresentation of LBW in those with NAFLD compared with the general U.S. population [42]. This inverse relationship between birth weight and NAFLD occurrence was also confirmed in a large French prospective cohort study of 55,034 adults [43]. Likewise, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that excess methionine and cysteine led to lower birth weight [44]. The effect of branched chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine) on birth weight was not yet clear, and most of the existing studies were animal studies [44]. In addition, there is growing evidence that there may be an association between high fatty acid levels and LBW [45\u201348]. The strengths of our study include the well-defined sampling frame and the use of omics techniques, which allow for the investigation of multiple genes and pathways simultaneously, in order to explore the impact of MDCs on the transcriptome perturbations and the subsequent impact on the birth weight. We also acknowledge several limitations of this study. First, the relatively small sample size (n = 193 mother\u2013child pairs) of our study population was prone to modest statistical power in detecting associations. Also for this reason, we did not perform sex-specific analysis despite that EDCs have been shown to exert different adverse effects in males and females, both in laboratory animals and in humans [49]. Second, it should also be noted that the concentrations of p,p\u2019-DDE, PCB-153, and PFOS in our study population were relatively low compared with the median exposure levels observed in other studies that found associations with birth weight [7,50,51], and they may not have been high enough to have a measurable effect, or the limited contrast in exposures may have limited statistical power to detect associations; PFOA levels were more comparable with levels in other studies. Third, the cross-sectional design of the study precluded establishing a temporal or causal relationship between MDC concentrations, transcriptome, and birth weight. Last, as with any other observational epidemiological study, there may be residual confounding bias due to uncontrolled unmeasured confounders, but we expected these to be minimal, as we carefully adjusted for a set of covariates that have been shown to be important with the help of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In addition, the mechanisms are complex and sensitive windows, for exposure to MDCs may vary depending on the specific chemical. Alterations at the molecular level caused by MDCs may also differ according to the specific outcome being studied. Therefore, different exposure windows and outcomes should be assessed in further studies investigating the metabolism-disrupting effects of chemicals."

In short, 255 mother\u2013child pairs were recruited from Flanders, Belgium, using a two-stage sampling procedure, with provinces as the primary sampling unit and maternity units as the secondary sampling unit. Mothers who had lived for at least 10 years in Flanders and were able to fill in Dutch questionnaires were invited to participate. The number of participants in each province was proportional to the number of inhabitants. Among the mother\u2013child pairs, 195 were randomly selected for transcriptome profiling. We restricted our analyses to the 193 term births (gestational age \u226537 weeks) in this study because preterm birth is a potential mediator of the effects of chemical exposures on birth weight [53]."

Samples were collected immediately after birth and stored at \u221280 \u25e6C until the measurements. MDC concentrations were measured using gas chromatographyelectron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry (for p,p\u2019-DDE and PCB-153) and high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (for PFOA and PFOS), as previously described [55,56]. All of the samples had quantifiable concentrations of p,p\u2019-DDE, PFOA, and PFOS, while for PCB-153, 3% of the samples had values below the limit of quantification (LOQ, 300 ng/L). These values were then imputed using maximum likelihood estimation, assuming a censored log-normal distribution for values above the LOQ and conditional on the observed values for other biomarkers [54,57]. Lipidstandardized p,p\u2019-DDE and PCB-153 concentrations were calculated based on estimated total lipids [total lipids = 50.49 + 1.32 \u00d7 (cholesterol + triglycerides) (mg/dL)] and expressed as ng/g lipids for subsequent analyses [15].

Furthermore, for each feature on the array, the quantile-normalized and log2-transformed signal intensity derived from Cy3 fluorescent dye was used for subsequent analyses. For replicated features on the array, the mean of signal intensities was calculated. After control and noise filtering by removing features with signal intensity below 3, 33,543 features retained.
