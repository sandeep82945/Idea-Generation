Music intervention is a non-medicated method for relieving anxiety. This current study aims to understand whether music can be effectively used to alleviate anxiety in admitted COVID-19 patients. Objectives: To study the effect of music on anxiety in patients admitted for COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi Methods: 34 patients (17 females &17 males) were randomly divided into two groups, a control (N=17) and a music group (N=17). Vitals of all the patients were noted. Patients of the music group were asked to listen to relaxing instrumental for 30 minutes, while patients of the control group were asked to relax for 30 minutes. Vitals of all the patients were noted again. Patients were asked to fill State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before and after intervention. Results:The post-interventionmean scores of STAI after themusic session were lower in themusic group than the control group [95.06 (SD 8.5)) versus 102.37 (SD 10.3)]. The differences in mean values of preto post-intervention changes between both groups after music session were statistically significant. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that listening to music lowers anxiety. As music is noninvasive and free of side-effects we recommend that music intervention service should be used to improve health care quality.",

The severe psychological symptomps can emerge on short, mid and long term as well. Our research is focusing on the psychological impacts of front line health care workers.\nObjectives: In our lecture, we summarize our reserach made in the National Traumatology Center, Budapest, Hungary among health care workers who worked in the front and in the second line during the most severe period of the pandemic in Hungary, and discuss probable risk factors for PTSD and chronic psychological distress related to COVID-19. Furthermore we make an overview on the most frequently used coping skills for dealing with the psychological stress caused by the pandemic among the health care workers. The sample taking was processed in July 2021, after 3 month the 3rd COVID \u2013 19 wave officially ended in Hungary. Methods: 123 health care workers completed the online survey anonimously, included Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberger Anxiety State Inventory, PTSD Checklist, Lazarus Coping Scale. Results: 23% of HCW reported symptomps of depression, nearly 25% dealing with sleeping disorders and 38% with chronic fatigue, 42,50 % HCW suffering from anxiety disorders, 22% HCW experiencing symptomps of PTSD. Conclusions: With our results we would like to raise awareness of the challenges and severe psychological consequences that these colleagues, our national heroes we can say, are facing after working in COVID-19 Health Care Units.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate selected parameters of psychosocial functioning as well as sociodemographic correlates of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and perceived stress among the residents of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Methods: An online questionnaire was completed by 323 participants, in whom the parameters of psychosocial functioning were assessed: symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), severity of sleep disorders (AIS) and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Results: The majority of the respondents (75.2%) scored high on the Perceived Stress Scale, almost half of the respondents (47.1%)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1239 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhad sleep disorders and 26% of the participants had no depressive symptoms. Age statistically significantly correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms and sleep disorders. Parental status statistically significantly correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms. There was a strong correlation between the severity of depression and anxiety and a strong correlation between depression and sleep disorders. Conclusions:Age and parental status contributed to the severity of depressive symptoms and the occurrence of sleep disorders among the residents of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Some of the residents of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship showed high levels of stress or insomnia. The severity of depressive symptoms significantly influenced the levels of anxiety and perceived stress, as well as the occurrence of sleep disorders.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Aleksandrovich, I. Gorkovaya, V. Averin, V. Titova* and V. Rozhdestvenskiy\nSaint Petersburg State Pediatric Medical University, Department Of Psychosomatics And Psychotherapy, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1240\nIntroduction: The COVID-19 pandemic can be seen as mental trauma. The concept of baseline beliefs helps to explain the extent to which mental trauma affects individuals. Objectives: The study aimed to investigate baseline beliefs in humanities students in Russian universities and analyse the relationship between baseline beliefs and emotional reactions. Methods: Data collection was carried out between May and July 2020 using a Google form that we developed. A total of 92 humanities students participated in the study. The WAS-37 was used to examine baseline beliefs, and the DASS-21 was used to determine depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Results:We found that the mean values of the scales \u201cBenevolence in the World\u201d (M = 34.8 6.5), \u201cSelf-image\u201d (M = 27.2 4.4), \u201cLuck\u201d (M = 32.7 5.7) and \u201cControlling beliefs\u201d (M = 27.9 4.0) were above the normative mean values for the Russian population and only the values of the scale \u201cJustice\u201d (M= 20.8 3.8) were below these. All components of baseline beliefs had negative associations with depression, anxiety, and stress; only \u201cBenevolence in the World\u201d was associated exclusively with anxiety (rs = -0.223, p < 0.05), and \u201cJustice\u201d with depression (rs = -0.223, p < 0.05). Conclusions: In a pandemic, the world around them is perceived by humanities students as less fair. Trust in the world, beliefs about the fairness of the world and a positive self-image are correlated with a more favourable emotional state. By this, we support the view that individuals\u2019 implicit beliefs (baseline beliefs) are related to the severity of the traumatic event.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.\nEPV0372 Life events impact on experiences of COVID-19 pandemic (in Azerbaijani sample)\nE.

Objectives:A study of subjective evaluation of life events during the pandemics. Methods: The modified Lifeline technique was used to elicit life events. In semistructured interview, using a timeline, subjects were asked to indicate and describe events that had an impact on their attitudes, behaviors and feelings since the start of pandemic. Then they evaluated with direct assessment scales each event as to what extent it was anxious, difficult to cope, changed the beliefs concerning COVID-19, fostered the changes of behavior and habits, and led to reappraisal of own values. The events were coded using dichotomous categories: COVID-related vs directly unrelated, universal vs individual, personally involved vs noninvolved, and also were further qualitatively evaluated. 25 young Azerbaijani residents took part in the study. Results: From 191 events named, 72%were COVID-related, 62% - universal, 62% - with personal involvement. 46% of events were unique (mentioned once). Universal events were more likely to be assessed as anxiogenic, while personal ones as leading to rethink own values and priorities (U, p<.01 and p<.05). Surprisingly, life events in total were assessed as less challenging the beliefs about pandemics while more frequently leading to rethink own values (T, p<.05). Individual events involvedmore conflict meanings and implications. Conclusions: Lifeline techniquemay provide important insights on the impact of life events in complex social transitions and may be used in counseling.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.
