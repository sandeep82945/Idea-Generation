    "abstractText": "With the emergence of avian influenza viruses, many Chinese cities periodically close the live poultry markets to restrict the trade of live chicken. This study investigated customers\u2019 decision-making clusters and consumption preferences. Data from 1108 participants were collected in May 2021 in the Jiangsu province using a mixed sampling method. Eight decisionmaking behaviors were identified using the Exploratory Factor Analysis. Five consumer clusters were identified using K-Means Cluster Analysis. Chi-square tests and pairwise comparisons of multiple sample rates were used to identify the differences in consumption preferences between the consumer clusters. The results show that only the concern of risking an avian influenza virus infection might not effectively change consumer preferences towards live chicken and patronage of wet markets and farms. Product quality, consumer habits and loyalty, limited knowledge and technology, and leisure elements in visiting farms are hindering changes in consumer preferences. Effective policies are needed to help customers to overcome the barriers of buying chilled and frozen chicken.",

            "text": "Live poultry markets play a significant role in chicken meat supply chains in many countries, including China (Offeddu et\u00a0al. 2016). The emergence of avian influenza (AI) viruses has put poultry workers and customers at serious risk for infection (FAO 2015). In recent years, chicken meat consumption in China has been rapidly increasing. In 2020, the annual chicken consumption increased by 11.2% to 15.5 m tons; per capita consumption increased by 12.8% to 13.9 kg. The annual chicken meat imports increased by 69.8%, reaching 985,000 tons, and ranked the second-highest in the world (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021).\nWith the emergency of the AI H7N9 subtype in 2013, the live poultry markets (LPMs) were periodically closed in many Chinese cities, and live chicken trade restricted. To avoid the anticipated high risk of virus dissemination (Chen et\u00a0al. 2020; Yu et\u00a0al. 2014), the Chinese government enforced a list of policies to encourage people to consume chilled and frozen chickens. Chilled chickens are slaughtered, quarantine approved, quickly cooled to keep the central temperature of the carcass at 0\u20134 \u2103, and sold as \u201cfresh\u201d\n* Cynthia Sau Chun Yip ycynthia@connect.hku.hk\nBin Cui bcui@yzu.edu.cn\nXiang Chen chen-xiang@yzu.edu.cn\nMei Yin Xu myxu@yzu.edu.cn\nJun Ke jke@yzu.edu.cn\nYi Tian ytian@yzu.edu.cn\n1 Business School of\u00a0Yangzhou University, Yangzhou\u00a0225001, Jiangsu\u00a0Province, China\n2 Department of\u00a0Business Administration, Chu Hai College of\u00a0Higher Education, 80, Castle Peak Road, Tuen\u00a0Mun, N.T.\u00a0Hong\u00a0Kong, China\n3 Jiangsu Key Laboratory of\u00a0Zoonosis, Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for\u00a0Prevention and\u00a0Control of\u00a0Important Animal Infectious Diseases and\u00a0Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou\u00a0225001, Jiangsu\u00a0Province, China\n1 3\nchickens (Zhao et\u00a0al. 2019). Frozen poultry gets rapidly frozen after slaughtering and stored in an environment below \u2212 18 \u00b0C. Given that consumption of live chicken has been a traditional habit of Chinese customers (Lin et\u00a0al. 2017), customer acceptance for the permanent closure of LPMs has been low (Jun et\u00a0al. 2014; Liping et\u00a0al. 2014). As a result, LPMs have been in closed-and-resume cycles for a long time. Considering the risk of spreading the AI virus and to protect public health, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation has decided to phase out LPMs transactions nationwide in July 2020 without setting a deadline.\nIn order to cease LPM trades as soon as possible, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of the diverse chicken meat consumption styles and establish specific measures accordingly. Consumer decision-making style is a habitual thinking mode and psychological setting when customers buy goods or services (Sprotles and Kendall 1986). It is a relatively durable behavioral mechanism that may serve as a basis for market segmentation. This study aimed to identify decision-making styles behind chicken meat consumption and consumer clusters using well validated instruments and statistical tools. It also investigated customers\u2019 preferences toward different poultry types: live chicken, chilled chicken, and frozen chicken; retail outlets: supermarkets, wet markets (selling live chicken), community convenience stores, rural chicken farms, and online fresh supermarkets."

Participants were recruited using a mixed sampling method. The population in Jiangsu was divided into 3 residential areas: northern, central, and southern districts. From each district, 2 cities were randomly selected: Xuzhou and Yancheng from the northern district, Yangzhou and Nantong from the central district, and Nanjing and Changzhou from the southern district. From public areas of each city, 200 urban residents were recruited. Five research assistants were trained before conducting the face-to-face interviews to minimize bias.

The Sprotles and Kendall\u2019s consumer decision-making style scales (Sprotles and Kendall 1986) were modified according to Chinese thinking, languages, and habitual patterns. Two items for risk perception of AI infection were added. The final scale included 27 items. The third part of the survey involved preferences for chicken product types: live chickens, chilled chickens, and frozen chickens; and chicken meat retail outlets: supermarkets, community convenience stores, wet markets, rural chicken farmers, and online fresh supermarkets. Participants could choose among \u201cnever bought one or never patronized\u201d = 1, \u201cbought or patronized once in a while\u201d = 2, \u201coften bought or patronized = 3\u201d."

First, Cronbach\u2019s alpha (\u03b1) coefficient was calculated to assess the internal reliability of the decision-making style Likert Scale questions (Cortina 1993). Then, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the underlying relationships and variables between chicken consumption and decision-making behavior, and to determine their underlying factors/constructs. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Test was used to measure the suitability of the data for Factor Analysis (Bartlett 1950; Kaiser 1970). The Component Matrix was rotated using the Varimax with Kaiser Normalization method to maximize the sum of the variance of the squared loadings, viz. the correlations between variables and factors. Decision-making style variables with loadings > 0.7 were grouped into decision-making styles which were then named according to the characteristics of the decision-making style variables in the groups, and items\n1 3\nhaving loading scores < 0.70 were deleted (Hair et\u00a0al. 2010). Then, the components (factors) with initial eigenvalues > 1 were extracted (Kaiser 1960). Next, an ANOVA analysis of K-Means Cluster Analysis was used to identify poultry meat consumer clusters and their differences (Chantaramanee et\u00a0al. 2022). The main objective of the clustering method was to identify consumers within the same cluster having similar decision-making behavior but are distinct from other clusters (Table\u00a01). One-way ANOVA of the consumption decision-making style regression factor scores was used to verify the distinctiveness of decision-making characteristics between clusters. Lastly, Chi-square tests and pairwise comparisons of multiple sample rates were used to measure the preferential differences for chicken meat product types and retail outlets among the identified consumer clusters. All analyses were conducted at a 95% confidence level using the IBM SPSS 20.0 software package."

Decision perplexed: not sure where to buy good quality chicken meat products, but price-conscious (items 20, 21, and 22). 3. Casual and recreational: take chicken meat product shopping as a leisure activity (items 4, 5, and 6). 4.

            "text": "This study identified 8 chicken consumption decisionmaking behaviors and 5 consumer clusters from 1,108 participants. Consistent with previous studies conducted in China (Li et\u00a0al. 2014; Zhao et\u00a0al. 2019), this study found that although\u00a0chilled and/or frozen chickens were better and healthier option to buy than live chicken, especially in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the AI epidemic, the acceptance of chilled or frozen chicken was not as high\n1 3\namong Chinese consumers as anticipated. The proportions of customers buying live chickens and patronizing wet markets remain very high (Tables\u00a04 and 5). This could be due to the fact that the AI epidemic outbreaks in China are under control. Therefore, the risk of contracting AI from wet markets became less of a concern to consumers. Only a low proportion of customers belonged to the cluster characterized by being significantly concerned about the risk of AI virus infection, Cluster C5 (Table\u00a06), which brought about a significantly higher proportion of customers often patronizing community convenience stores and online fresh supermarkets, or a significantly low proportion of them patronizing wet markets. These findings were inconsistent with studies conducted in France and UK, where supermarkets were the most important retail outlets for poultry meat consumption (Walley et\u00a0al. 2014; Walley et\u00a0al. 2015). On the other hand, supermarkets were a relatively new phenomenon in China, and farms or wet markets were the only source for chickens not long ago. This difference was reflected in the relatively high proportion of customers who often patronize wet markets and a very low proportion of them often patronize supermarkets and community convenience stores across all the clusters (Table\u00a05). Previous studies identified consumer clusters according to customer perception of quality or sensory characteristics and consumer preferences (Skunca et\u00a0al. 2017; Sow and Grongnet 2010). Sunca et\u00a0al. (2017) found that senior customers paid more attention to chicken meat quality. Sow and Grongnet (2010) found that live village chicken was the most preferred and ready-to-cook broiler was the least. This study found that chicken meat quality was a priority to senior customers (Cluster C4) and live chicken were preferred over chilled or frozen (Table\u00a04).\nYoung customers might have just recently separated from their parent\u2019s home and did not have much information and experience in shopping for chicken. They might have busy schedules and other priorities. They were expected to be proficient in using computers and the internet. Therefore,\nshopping online might help them get informed and save time. Besides, wet markets might not be the shopping environment and experience that young people are familiar with or enjoy. Lack of knowledge about chilling and freezing technology and internet skills might explain why chilled and frozen chicken, and online fresh supermarkets were significantly less acceptable to senior and quality-conscious customers (Cluster C4) (Hasani et\u00a0al. 2022; Hati et\u00a0al. 2021). Self-driving rural tourism in China has become a popular weekend entertainment and is another barrier to phasing out live chicken retailing (Wang et\u00a0al. 2018; Zou et\u00a0al. 2014)."

The effect sample size was 0.13, \u03b1 = 0.05, and power = 0.95 (Faul et\u00a0al. 2009). Compared to the population distributions (Textor 2021), customers aged 26\u201335 years were overrepresented. As these customers were in their golden ages for starting a family, the overrepresentation better reflects the reality. Customers aged \u2264 25 years and customers at undergraduate or above education levels and high household incomes were severely overrepresented (HKTDC 2021). These customers were expected to be proficient in computers and the internet, more informed, have better employment opportunities and conditions, and adopt a more western lifestyle. Customers aged \u2265 56 years and customers at the junior high school education level were severely underrepresented, consistent with the demographic characteristics of Cluster C4. As a result, preferences towards live chicken and wet markets were underrepresented.\n\u201cA gentleman should stay away from the kitchen!\u201d is a well-known Chinese cultural norm. It makes the overrepresentation of females in the sample better reflect the reality. Self-reported chicken meat consumption behavior might be different from actual behavior. Both decision-making styles\n1 3\nand consumer clusters were identified from the same sample, therefore subject to the same sampling biases. Hence, selfreport biases were of little relevance to the decision-making styles comparison analyses and the consumer clusters comparison analyses. Although this study focused on shopping for chicken meat products, other factors might also affect customers\u2019 shopping preferences and practices. For example, a person who wants to buy both live seafood and chicken \u2013 live seafood might only be available in wet markets. Wet markets are historical shopping places for chicken in China. There is always a wet market around, but not necessarily a supermarket. This study identified customer decisionmaking styles and preferences for chicken meat products and shopping outlets. In-depth qualitative investigations to better understand the specific reasons behind them are recommended. This study was conducted in Jiangsu province, other regions in China, and developing and underdeveloped countries may share similar chicken distribution settings (FAO 2015). Globalization also increases cultural convergence especially among the younger generations."

Concerns about the quality of chilled or frozen chicken meat products, consumer habits and loyalty, knowledge and technology limitations, and the leisure elements in visiting farms might hinder switching consumer preferences from live chicken to chilled or frozen chicken meat products; and from wet markets and farms to other retail outlets. To reduce the risk of AI virus infection, more strategies are needed to shift customers towards chilled or frozen chicken. Therefore, future policies may focus on improving customer perception of the nutritional content, sensory appeal, and the price of chilled or frozen meat (Hati et\u00a0al. 2021). For example, \u015amieci\u0144ska et\u00a0al. (2015) found that the total protein in frozen turkey meat stored for 6 weeks significantly increased, and differences in the concentrations of other chemical compounds (dry matter, fat, minerals, and non-protein nitrogen) were not significant. Promotion could also emphasize the time-saving elements of purchasing chilled or frozen meat from supermarkets (including online fresh supermarkets) and convenience stores. A diverse combination of goods in supermarkets could make shopping enjoyable (Rappaport 2021), especially for female buyers and when the supermarkets are in big shopping malls (Medis et\u00a0al. 2021). Offering cooked chilled or frozen meat and free tastes in supermarkets and convenience stores could save customers\u2019 time for food processing and ensure sensory appeal. Online surfing has been a popular entertainment for the younger generations. Online technology promotion to senior customers\nand those with little technical skills could help them enjoy online shopping and improve chilled or frozen meat sales. The methods used in this study could also be employed to analyze other similar decision-making behaviors by modifying the decision-making items as needed."

            "text": "Despite years of periodic closures of LPMs to reduce the risk of AI virus infection, the risk of AI virus infection was not of high concern for most customers. The traditional culture of purchasing live chicken from wet markets stayed firm. Successful changes require changing the status quo (Burnes 2020). More resistance toward chilled or frozen chicken and online shopping was observed among senior customers and those concerned about the chicken meat quality. Effective policies may help these customers better understand the chilling and freezing technology, improve their computer and internet literacy, and discover the benefits of shopping from supermarkets and online, such as through seminars and workshops. Making chilled and frozen chickens available in neighborhood outlets could improve accessibility. Further studies may investigate customers\u2019 perceptions of and experience with chilled and frozen chickens, as well as the barriers to switching from live chickens to chilled and frozen chickens to identify further potential intervention leverages.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00003- 022- 01411-y.\nAcknowledgements The research is supported by the Open Project Program of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Zoonosis (No: R2004).\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest."
