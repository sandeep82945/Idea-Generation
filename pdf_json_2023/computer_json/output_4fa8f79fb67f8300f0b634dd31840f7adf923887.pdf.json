Unfortunately, we accidently omitted citing our previous work in the part of describing the Laplace-based AWT measurement research. Therefore, our previous article [2] should be additionally cited in the following sentence of the introduction: \u2018\u2018Although the WT measurements have evolved . . . to Laplace-based solutions [14].\u2019\u2019 In addition, the following sentence explaining the source function of Poisson\u2019s equation should be appended to the function description in (1): \u2018\u2018The domain\u007f is the voxel domain, and the source function f of Poisson\u2019s equation is defined by the equation: f = \u03c3 (x, y, z), where \u03c3 is \u22120.01 if inside the envelope surface and zero otherwise.\u2019\u2019",
