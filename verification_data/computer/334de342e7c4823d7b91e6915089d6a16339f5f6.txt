Based on the provided text, the portion mentioning future research directions is:

"We conduct ablation and case studies to promote a better understanding of our method and motivate future research to rethink the importance of GNNs in traffic forecasting."

"Additionally, we notice that adding an auxiliary feature â€“ day of week can significantly improve the predictive accuracy, as shown in Table 6. The reason is that there is a significant difference in traffic patterns between weekdays and weekends. Therefore, this feature is a powerful prior knowledge for the model, and future research may consider incorporating this feature to enhance performance."
