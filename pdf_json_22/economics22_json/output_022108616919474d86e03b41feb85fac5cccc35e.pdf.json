            "text": "Introduction. The SF-6D is a preference-based measure of health, derived from the SF-36 for economic evaluation. No value set exists for the SF-6D in Lebanon and other Arabic speaking countries in the Middle East. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using the standard gamble (SG) technique to generate preference-based values for theArabic version of SF-6D in a Lebanese population. Methods. The SF-6D was translated into Arabic using forward and backward translations. Forty-nine states defined by the SF-6D were selected using an orthogonal design and grouped into seven sets. A gender-occupation stratified sample of 126 Lebanese adults from the American University of Beirut were recruited to value seven states and the pits (worst) SF-6D health states using SG. Mean and individual level multivariate regression models were fitted to estimate preference weights for all SF-6D states. The quality of data and the predictive power of the models were compared with results from the United Kingdom (UK). Results. All respondents completed the interviews with 25 percent reporting that the SG task was difficult and 21 percent felt some degree of irritation or boredom. A total of 992 (98% out of 1,008 observations) SG valuations were useable for econometric modeling. There was no significant change in the test\u2013retest values of 21 subjects. The mean absolute errors in the mean and individual level models were 0.036 and 0.050, respectively, both of which were lower than the UK results. The random effects model adequately predicts the SG values, with the worst state having a value of 0.322 compared to 0.271 in the UK.\nConclusions. This study confirmed that it was feasible and acceptable to generate preference values with the SG method for the Arabic SF-6D in a Lebanese population. This would be the first step towards developing SF-6D value set for Lebanon to be used in economic evaluation studies and to support resources allocation decisions."

            "text": "Introduction.Apatient/person-reported outcomemeasure (PROM) is a questionnaire that measures patient\u2019s health self-assessment (PROs), such as pain/wellbeing. HTx is a Horizon 2020 project supported by the European Union lasting for 5 years from January 2019. The main aim of HTx is to create a framework for the Next Generation Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to support patient-centred, societally oriented, real-time decision-making on access to and reimbursement for health technologies (HTs) throughout Europe. Individual values, needs, and preferences should be taken into account when appraising HTs and in clinical decision-making. Better guidance is needed about how to develop and select generic and/or more specific outcome measures that are relevant to patients and fit-for-purpose. Our goal is to provide that guidance via the PROM toolbox and enable users to select PROMs by using this. The HTx project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement N\u00b0 825162. Methods. A framework for the assessment of PROMs was discussed with experts, tested for a subset of PROMs (Linnean menu) and resulted in the PROM-cycle. Multiple literature studies were performed on PROMs, their properties, and characteristics. The general population was studied as well as cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, and (long-lasting) COVID-19. This resulted in an Excel database (PROM-overview) made available via a user-friendly web-application helping users to select PROMs: the PROM select app via https://www.prom-select.eu/proms. Results. Multiple tools were developed and are available in the PROM toolbox starting with the PROM-guide, Literature review on the use of PROMs, PROM-cycle accompanied by the Linnean menu. In addition, PROM-links, The making of the PROM-overview & PROM-select app, PROM-overview, PROM-select app, its usability test report and PROM toolbox presentation can be found on https://www.zorginzicht.nl/ondersteuning/prom-toolboxsummary-in-english#what-is-the-prom-cycle. Conclusions. The PROM toolbox guides users and helps them to select PROMs and trustworthy information and finding relevant scientific articles.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0266462322001416 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
