 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate methods to improve the mixing of LFP and nanocellulose prior to heat treatment to obtain more homogeneous carbon coatings on all LFP particles. The paper noted some particles were uncovered likely due to poor mixing. Better mixing could lead to better electrochemical performance.

2. Explore the use of other types of sustainable carbon sources, such as other nanocelluloses or cellulose derivatives, as alternatives to CNC and CNF. This could identify materials that yield higher quality carbon coatings.

3. Optimize the heat treatment parameters (temperature, atmosphere, duration) to maximize carbon content and quality for the LFP/C composites. The paper used 600Â°C but higher temperatures may improve carbonization.

4. Evaluate the cycling performance and stability of the LFP/C composites over extended charge/discharge cycles. The paper only showed 10 cycles. Long-term cycling data would better demonstrate viability.

5. Investigate doping the LFP/C composite with other elements such as Mg, Zr, Nb, etc. to try to further enhance the electrochemical performance. Doping is a common strategy to improve lithium ion battery cathodes.
