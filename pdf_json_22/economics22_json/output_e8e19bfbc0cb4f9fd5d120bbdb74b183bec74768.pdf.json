    "abstractText": "The economic implications from the COVID-19 crisis are not like anything people have ever experienced. As predictions indicated, it is not until the year 2025 may the global economy recover to the ideal situation as it was in 2020. Regions lacked of developing category is among the mostly affected regions, because the category includes weakly and averagely potential power. For supporting the decision of economic system recovery scientifically and accurately under the stress of COVID-19, one feasible solution is to assess the regional economic restorability by taking into account a variety of indicators, such as development foundation, industrial structure, labor forces, financial support and government\u2019s ability. This is a typical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem with quantitative and qualitative criteria/indicator. To solve this problem, in this paper, an investigation is conducted to obtain 14 indicators affecting regional economic restorability, which form an indicator system. The interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) is an effective tool to express experts\u2019 subjective preference values (PVs) in the process of decision-making. First, some formulas are developed to convert quantitative PVs to IT2FSs. Second, an improved interval type-2 fuzzy ORESTE (IT2F-ORESTE) method based on distance and likelihood are developed to assess the regional economic restorability. Third, a case study is given to illustrate the method. Then, robust ranking results are acquired by performing a sensitivity analysis. Finally, some comparative analyses with other methods are conducted to demonstrate that the developed IT2F-ORESTEmethod can supporting the decision of economic system recovery scientifically and accurately.",

            "text": "Keywords Regional economic restorability \u00b7 COVID-19 \u00b7 Interval type-2 fuzzy set \u00b7 ORESTE method\nIntroduction\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, as a major public health emergency, has brought heavy disaster to people around the world. COVID-19 pandemic is considered to be the notorious economic shock arising throughout the year 2020. The economic implications from the COVID-19 crisis are not like anything people have ever experienced. As predictions indicated, it is not until the year 2025 may the global economy recover to the ideal situation as it was in 2020 [1]. As a result, although the negative effects of the deadly CODIV-19\nB Hui Gao gaohui@mail.sdufe.edu.cn\n1 School of Business, Heze University, Heze, Shandong, China\n2 School of Management Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Finance and Economics, Jinan 250014, Shandong, China\npandemic are still presented currently, the regional economic recovery phase must be projected to start due to the fact that regional economic development has plummeted to historic bottom [2\u20136]. Specially, regions lacked of developing category is among the mostly affected regions, because the category includes weakly and averagely potential power [7\u20139].\nQuantitative research on the impact of major public health events on economic system can provide scientific support for improving the regional economic restorability. Existing studies have analyzed the economic impact of major public health events at different scales and industrial sectors, but there is still an issue that needs to be discussed:\n(1) There are few studies on the economic impact of epidemics at the scale and level. What\u2019s more, there are as yet no studies in the associated field of the assessment of regional economic restorability (RER) under the stress of COVID-19.\nIn this study, RER can be considered as a multi-criteria (indicators) decision-making (MCDM) problem which a number of regions should be ranked based on several special indicators. Studies form China, Japan researched on establishing assessment indicator systems for major natural disaster or public health emergencies, such as earthquake [10], flood damage [11], SARS [12], etc., and then implemented in the prioritization of regions.\nThose assessment indicator systems contain specific indicators for reflecting the comprehensive strength of regional economy. At the same time, each indicator is assigned a certain number to confirm its relative significance. Obviously, those systems are good at processing quantitative information, however, it still has somedrawbacks.Onone hand, those systems are limited in pay close attention to comprehensive indicators, which make the final ranking results less practical and effective in determining the priority for regions; on the other hand, those indicators are mostly qualitative with a great deal of fuzzy and imprecise information, but the MCDM methods mentioned earlier are not able to process qualitative information. The type-1 fuzzy set (T1FS) theory [13] represent the qualitative indicator values with membership function (MF). MFs of T1FS are crisp number and have two-dimensional NFs. Nevertheless, in the real assessment of RER, owing to more complexity and uncertainty, the preference values of most indicator, such as location advantages, foreign trade dependence, diversification of industrial structure, industrial clusters competitiveness and Internet economy development environment, etc., cannot be represented sufficiently by T1FS. Because it is unreasonable to apply an accurate membership degree for an uncertain item. In such circumstances, Type-2 fuzzy set (T2FS) [13] are developed based on T1FS which could cover more complexity and uncertainty by three-dimensional MFs. That is, T2FS can more easily express vagueness and imprecision than T1FS. Whereas, the computation of T2FS is commonly complex, and the corresponding amounts of computation are very large. As a consequence, interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) is the most extensively utilized, membership degree of IT2FS take the form of crisp intervals, whichmake the calculations related to IT2FS. Furtherly, many studies of IT2FS have detected that IT2FS is a very helpful tool for quantifying the ambiguous nature of linguistic variables. In this regard, the IT2FS is a suitable tool when their fuzz MF cannot be defined easily for fuzzy system.\nAlthoughMCDMmethods with IT2FSs have beenwidely applied to many fields [14\u201316], there are few studies on assessment of RER applying interval type-2 fuzzy MCDM (IT2F-MCDM) methods. In the meantime, as a result of effectiveness, many IT2F-MCDM methods have also been developed, which aremostly the utility value-basedmethods, such as the interval type-2 fuzzy aggregate operators [14\u201316], the interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS (IT2F-TOPSIS) method\n[17], the interval type-2 fuzzy VIKOR (IT2F-VIKOR) method [18], and the interval type-2 fuzzy MULTIMOORA (IT2F-MULTIMOORA)method [19]. However, the existing IT2F-MCDM methods have some crucial drawbacks:\n(2) The above IT2F-MCDM methods only focus on the preference interrelations and the indifference interrelations between alternatives. And the incomparable interrelations are neglected which occurs objectively. For instance, when a comparison of economic restorability according to diversification of industrial structure (C\u03031) and industrial clusters competitiveness (C\u03032) is given between regions (X1 and X2), if in region X1 the preference value (PV) of C\u03031 is \u201cVery unimportant\u201d but the PV of C\u03032 is \u201cVery important\u201d, and if in region X2 the preference value (PV) of C\u03031 is \u201cVery important\u201d but the PV of C\u03032 is \u201cVery unimportant\u201d, then these two regions cannot be regarded simply indifference interrelation based on the corresponding aggregated results. (3) The existing IT2F-MCDM methods can merely solve the decision-making problems that the PVs are represented as IT2FSs but cannot solve the real problems that an unspecified number of the PVs are in crisp numbers. But in reality, the cases involve generally both quantitative indicators and qualitative indicators, and under the most circumstances the quantitative indicator PVs are easy to acquire.\nThe ORESTE method, developed originally by Roubens [20], is an ordinary outranking method and does not need to be concerned with crisp indicator weights. Compared with the existing MCDM methods, the ORESTE method not only can determine the utility values of alternatives but also can capture the preference interrelations, incomparability interrelations and the indifference interrelations between alternatives. Moreover, a large number of researchers have developed some extended forms of the ORESTmethod, such as probabilistic hesitant fuzzy ORESTE method [21], hesitant fuzzy linguistic ORESTE method [22], interval type-2 fuzzy ORESTE (IT2F-ORESTE) method [23]. Although the IT2F-ORESTE method can overcome the above drawback (2), it still has some other drawbacks:\n(4) Most of the distance measures (DMs) for IT2FS are generalizations of the distances applied in the crisp sets, using the membership function to take place of the characteristic function, such as the normalized Hamming DM and the normalized Euclidean DM. Heidarzade et al. [24] illustrated that these two DMs are not suitable for IT2FS and require extensive computations. (5) The likelihood of IT2FSs has not been combined with the IT2F-MCDM methods. The measure of preference\ninformation (PI) has always been a hot button for IT2FMCDM method improvement. Different measures of IT2FSs have a critical impact on the ordering of schemes on account of different information they conveyed. For instance, the similarity of IT2FSs can detail the general interrelation between PI [25], and the entropy of IT2FSs can detail the uncertainty of PI [26]. Compared to similarity and entropy, the likelihood of IT2FSs can detail the binary interrelation of PI. Besides, it still has some wonderful properties such as transmission and complementation.\nTherefore, it is worthwhile developing a feasible IT2FORESTE solution to a significance problem in economic management field, namely, assessment of RER. First, the Delphi approach is applied to construct a comprehensive indicator system for RER based on the interview with 35 magisterial and accomplished experts from regional economic field, government management field, medical care and public health field. The IT2FSs provided by experts are applied to express fuzzy and imprecise information. Then, an improved IT2F-ORESTE method is developed to solve the RER assessment problem with both qualitative and quantitative indicator. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 For supporting the decision of economic system recovery scientifically and accurately, on the basis of the development foundation, industrial structure, labor forces, financial support and government\u2019s ability, etc., RER of different regions under the stress of COVID-19 are determined. Thus, the drawback (1) is overcome. \u2022 Some formulas are developed to convert quantitative PVs to IT2FSs for combining the quantitative and qualitative indicator information. In this case, drawback (3) is overcome. \u2022 The vertex method for DM is extended to encompass IT2FSs. The extended vertex method is an efficient simple formula that requires few computations in contrast to other DMs. This overcomes drawback (4) of existing DMs. \u2022 An improved IT2F-ORESTE method based on the DM and likelihood of IT2FS is developed to deal with the RER assessment problem. Thus, the drawback (2) and (5) are overcome. \u2022 Also, a comprehensive discussion between the improved IT2F-ORESTE method, the traditional ORESTE method and two representative IT2F-MCDM methods, including IT2F-TOPSIS method, IT2F-VIKOR method, and IT2FMULTIMOORA method, are developed to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the improved IT2F-ORESTE method. In addition, the case study presents a helpful reference for government departments to improve the RER.\nThe structure of this paper is briefly introduced as follows. \u201cLiterature reviews\u201d constructs an assessment indicator system of RER under the stress of COVID-19. \u201cPreliminaries\u201d reviews some relative principal theory of IT2FS and the classic ORESTE method. \u201cAssessment of RER under the stress of COVID-19 using the new IT2F-ORESTE method based on distance and likelihood\u201d develops a new IT2FORESTE method based on distance measure and likelihood. \u201cA case study: the assessment of RER of cities under the stress of COVID-19 epidemic\u201d proposes a case study of the assessment of RER of Shandong Province under the stress COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, sensitivity and comparative analyses are conducted. \u201cConclusions\u201d provides the conclusions and recommendations for future study.\nLiterature reviews\nIndicator system and selection of MCDM method are the essential issues of assessment of RER. Thus, the literature in this section includes restorability assessment, indicator system and ORESTE method.\nAssessment of restorability\nOn account of the newly increased popularity of restorability in various research disciplines, some assessment methods of restorability have been proposed. Moslehi and Reddy [27] proposed a new performance-based method for characterizing and assessing resilience of multi-functional demand-side engineered systems. Liu et al. [28] presented a planningoriented resilience assessment framework to develop quantitative resilience indices from both the system and component perspectives. Zarei et al. [29] presented a framework for resilience assessment in process systems using a fuzzy hybrid MCDMmodel. Abbasnejadfard et al. [30] developed a novel deterministic and probabilistic resilience assessment measures for engineering and infrastructure systems based on the economic impacts. Rezvani et al. [31] built an enhancing urban resilience evaluation system through automated rational and consistent decision-making simulations. In this study, assessment of regional economic restorability can be considered as aMCDMproblem. AlthoughMCDMmethods have been widely applied to restorability assessment fields, there are few studies on assessment of RER.\nAssessment indicator system of RER under the stress of COVID-19\nFirst of all, \u201cassessment\u201d, \u201cregional economic\u201d, \u201crestorability\u201d, \u201cresilience\u201d, \u201cmajor public emergencies\u201d are taken as keywords to search the relevant literatures in Web of Science, Science Direct, Springer Databases, Wiley Online\nLibrary and CNKI (Time is up to June 30, 2022). A great deal of literature works regarding the indicator system for RERwere reviewed, which are displayed in Table 1. Clearly, assessment of RER is basis of a series of qualitative and quantitative criteria.Whereas, under the stress of COVID-19, many researchers consider the assessment indicator system should contain specific indicators for reflecting the comprehensive strength of regional economy. At present, in the context of COVID-19, government departments are required to formulate the economic promotion policies according to the RER. On this basis, the related 23 indicators from the relevant literatures are picked out. Furtherly, these indicators are divided into five dimensions from the perspectives of social and economic, which contain development foundation (T\u03031), industrial structure (T\u03032), labor forces (T\u03033), financial support (T\u03034) and government\u2019s ability (T\u03035) displayed in Table 1.\nORESTmethod\nThe ORESTE method is an ordinary outranking method to deal with MCDM problems. The most interesting part of ORESTE method is to separate preference, indifference and incomparability relations of alternatives through the conflict analysis, whichmakes the resultsmore easily accepted by the decision-makers. At present, a large number of researchers have developed some extended forms of the ORESTmethod. Li et al. [21] proposed an ORESTE method for MCDMwith probabilistic hesitant fuzzy. Li et al. [22] prioritized the elective surgery patient admission in a Chinese public tertiary\nhospital using the hesitant fuzzy linguistic ORESTEmethod. Zheng et al. [23] developed an extended IT2F-ORESTE method for risk analysis in FMEA. Liao et al. [54] presented a new hesitant fuzzy linguistic ORESTE method for hybrid MCDM. Luo et al. [55] proposed a likelihood-based hybrid ORESTE method for evaluating the thermal comfort in underground mines. Wang et al. [56] proposed a double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic ORESTE method. Wang et al. [57] developed an interval 2-Tuple linguistic FineKinney model for risk analysis based on extended ORESTE method with cumulative prospect theory. Liang et al. [58] proposed a hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy ORESTE method to determine the risk priority of the failure modes.\nThese previous studies indicate that the ORESTE method has been successfully utilized to address the priority calculation problem. Consequently, in this study, it is worthwhile developing the classic ORESTEmethod and extending it into the interval type-2 fuzzy context to deal with the complexity MCDM problems with both qualitative and quantitative criteria and the weights being unknown.\nPreliminaries\nIn following subsection, some concepts, operational laws, likelihood of IT2FS, PA operator of IT2FS, and the classic ORESTE method are briefly reviewed.\nIT2FS\nDefinition 1 [14] Let E be the universe of discourse, a T2FS A can be denoted as follows:\nA {((\u03b5, \u03c3), \u03bcA(\u03b5, \u03c3))|\u2200\u03b5 \u2208 E , \u2200\u03c3 \u2208 J\u03b5 \u2286 [0, 1] } (1)\nwhere \u03bcA(\u03b5, \u03c3) is called type-2 MF, 0 \u2264 \u03bcA(\u03b5, \u03c3) \u2264 1 for each \u03b5 and \u03c3 . In addition, the T2FS A also can be denoted as follows:\n(2)\nA \u222b\n\u03b5\u2208E \u222b \u03c3\u2208J\u03b5 \u03bcA (\u03b5, \u03c3 )/ (\u03b5, \u03c3 )\n\u222b\n\u03b5\u2208E (\u222b \u03c3\u2208J\u03b5 \u03bcA (\u03b5, \u03c3 )/\u03c3 ) /\u03b5,\nwhere J\u03b5 \u2286 [0, 1] is the primary membership at \u03b5 and\u222b \u03c3\u2208J\u03b5 \u03bcA(\u03b5, \u03c3)/\u03c3 is the second membership at \u03b5. For discrete spaces, \u222b is replaced by \u2211 .\nDefinition 2 [14] Let A be a T2FS in the universe of discourse E , if all \u03bc(\u03b5, \u03c3) 1, then A is called an IT2FS, represented as follows: A \u222b\n\u03b5\u2208E \u222b \u03c3\u2208J\u03b5 1/(\u03b5, \u03c3) \u222b \u03b5\u2208E (\u222b \u03c3\u2208J\u03b5 1/\u03c3 ) /\u03b5. (3)\nApparently, IT2FS A in E is totally determined by the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) which can be denoted: FOU (A) \u22c3\n\u03b5\u2208E J\u03b5 \u22c3\n\u03b5\u2208E {(\u03b5, \u03c3)|\u03c3 \u2208 J\u03b5 \u2286 [0, 1] }. (4)\nGenerally, due to the calculations on IT2FSs are more complex, some simplified forms can be utilized to denote IT2FSs.

The specific procedures of this method are presented as follows:\nStep 1: Aggregate global preference scores (GPS). Assume that R j is the original ranking of the important degree of criterion C j ( j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n) and R j (Xi ) is the original ranking of the preference value of alternative Xi (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m) under criterion C j . Then, the GPS can be aggregated with\nG ( Xi j ) \u221a \u03b7 ( R j )2 + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)(R j (Xi ))2, (15)\nwhere \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1] is the coefficient to declare the importance between R j and R j (Xi ).\nStep 2: Establish the global weak ranking (WR). Based on Eq. (15), compute the global weak ranking\nR ( Xi j ) .\nStep 3: Compute the weak ranking of Xi (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m).\nR\u0303(Xi ) n\u2211 j 1 R ( Xi j ) . (16)\nStep 4: Obtain the preference intensity (PI). The average PI of Xi over X\u03ba can be defined as:\nP(Xi , X\u03ba) \u2211n j 1 max [ R ( X\u03ba j )\u2212 R(Xi j ), 0]\n(m \u2212 1)n2 . (17)\nThe net PI of Xi over X\u03ba can be defined as:\nP(Xi , X\u03ba) P(Xi , X\u03ba) \u2212 P(X\u03ba , Xi ). (18)\nStep 5: Construct the preference/indifference/ incomparability (PIR) structure.\n(1) If |P(Xi , X\u03ba)| \u2264 \u03bc,\nThen { Xi I X\u03ba , if |P(Xi , X\u03ba)| \u2264 \u03b8 and |P(X\u03ba , Xi )| \u2264 \u03b8 Xi R X\u03ba , if |P(Xi , X\u03ba)| > \u03b8 and |P(X\u03ba , Xi )| > \u03b8\n(19)\n(2) If |P(Xi , X\u03ba)| > \u03bc,\nThen \u23a7\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23a9 Xi P X\u03ba , if min(P(Xi , X\u03ba ), P(X\u03ba , Xi ))| P(Xi , X\u03ba )| < \u03d1 and P(Xi , X\u03ba ) > P(X\u03ba , Xi )\nX\u03ba P Xi , if min(P(Xi , X\u03ba ), P(X\u03ba , Xi ))| P(Xi , X\u03ba )| < \u03d1 and P(Xi , X\u03ba ) < P(X\u03ba , Xi ) Xi R X\u03ba , if min(P(Xi , X\u03ba ), P(X\u03ba , Xi ))| P(Xi , X\u03ba )| \u2265 \u03d1 ,\n(20)\nwhere \u03bc, \u03b8 , \u03d1 are three predefined thresholds [53]. Step 6: Determine the strong ranking based on the weak\nranking and PIR.\nAssessment of RER under the stress of COVID-19 using the new IT2F-ORESTE method based on distance and likelihood\nConstruct the indicator system for RER under the stress of COVID-19 by Delphi method\nIn this section, the Delphi approach is applied to construct a comprehensive indicator system for RER based on the interview with 35 magisterial and accomplished experts (20 experts from the regional economic field, 10 experts from government management field, 5 experts from medical care and public health field). These experts are invited to conduct questionnaire surveys on the indicators. The Delphi method are applied to construct the indicator system for RER under the stress of COVID-19. The questionnaire surveys with the above 35 experts are directed in following three rounds:\nIn the first round, the adaptability of the indicators (0 is no and 1 is yes) are appraised by experts. Then, the indicators with a score below 0.50 are removed, which contains Location advantages (C\u03032), Scientific and technological innovation talent resources allocation efficiency (C\u030312), Per capita fiscal expenditure (C\u030316).\nIn the second round, the Likert 5 scale are applied to evaluated the relative significance of every indicator (on a scale of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively, which displays it is greatly unimportant, a little unimportant, medium, a little important, greatly important). The indicators with final score below 5.5 are removed. That is, the indicators deleted in the second round include Internet economy development environment (C\u030310), Small and medium-sized enterprises develop vitality (C\u030311), Scientific and technological innovation talent resources allocation efficiency (C\u030312), Optimization of financial structure (C\u030317), Government financial self-sufficient capacity (C\u030323). By means of inquiring experts, the remaining secondary indicator of Labor forces (T\u03033) is incorporated into Government\u2019s ability (T\u03035). Then, an adjusted indicator system is acquired.\nIn the third round, experts have no objection to the constructed indicator system.\nThrough three rounds of survey, the indicator system, which includes 4 first-level indicators and 15 s-level indicators, are finally obtained, shown in Fig. 2.\nThe proposed IT2F-ORESTEmethod\nThis section develops the IT2F-ORESTE method based on distance measure and likelihood to deal with the assessment problem of RER under COVID-19 epidemic stress in which the preference values of alternatives are denoted by IT2FSs or crisp numbers and the weights of criteria are unknown.\nThe basic notations are shown in Table 2. Assume that X {Xi |i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m } is a set of\nalternatives (regionals), C {C j | j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n } is a set of criteria (assessment indicators of RER), \u03c9 { \u03c9 j | j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n } is a set of criteria weights and E {El |l 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , q } is a set of experts.Assume that there are \u03b4 (0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 n) quantitative indicators and n \u2212 \u03b4 qualitative indicators. The proposed IT2F-ORESTE method contains three phases:\nPhase I: Collect assessment indicator information of RER\nIn general, indicator system includes both the quantitative indicator (such as per capita GDP, fixed asset investment, total retail sales of consumer goods) and qualitative indicator (such as industrial transformation and upgrading capacity, business environment, financial support), inwhich the preference values of the quantitative indicator can be dimensionless and the preference values of the qualitative indicator cannot be quantified as crisp number [63].\nThe quantitative indicator information is obtained by investigation or estimation, while the qualitative indicator information is the experts\u2019 subjective evaluation based on their experience, knowledge or ability. For solving the assessment problem with quantitative and qualitative indicator information in the same environments, next a transformation function that converts quantitative indicator information to the IT2FSs is developed. Definition 8 Let B {b j | j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n } be a crisp number set. b\u2212 min{b j | j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n }, b+ max { b j | j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n } . Then, b j corresponding linguistic terms (LTs) and IT2FSs are denoted as follows (Table 3):\nExample 1 In 2020, the GDP of Qindao, Jinan, Yantai, Weifang, Linyi of Shandong province of China are 12,400.56, 10,140.91, 7816.42, 5872.20, 4805.25 (Unit:100 million RMB), respectively. The Crisp number interval are [4805.25, 5890.25), [5890.25, 6975.25), [6975.25, 8060.25), [8060.25, 9145.25), [ 9145.25, 10230.25), [10230.25, 11315.25), [11315.25, 12400.56], respectively. Then, indicator information of the GDP of Qindao corresponding linguistic terms and IT2FSs are {Very strong (VS)} and [(0.9,1,1,1;1), (0.95,1,1,1;0.9)], respectively. Indicator information of the GDP of Qindao corresponding linguistic terms and IT2FSs are {Extremely Strong (ES)} and [(0.9,1,1,1;1), (0.95,1,1,1;0.9)], respectively, and so on.\nStep 1: Convert \u03b4 (0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 n) quantitative indicator information obtained by investigation to the LTs based on the definition 8.\nStep 2: Establish the initial decision matrix. The initial decision matrix Dl including LTs converted by definition 8 and LTs given by expert El is established as follows:\nDl \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 b11 b12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 b1\u03b4 L1, \u03b4+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 L1, n b21 b22 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 b2\u03b4 L2, \u03b4+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 L2, n ... ... . . . ... ... . . . ...\nbm1 bm2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 bm\u03b4 Lm, \u03b4+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Lm, n\n\u23a4 \u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6, (21)\nwhere bi j (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7m, j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b4) denotes the converted linguistic indicator value, and Li j (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7m, j \u03b4+1, \u03b4+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n) denotes the linguistic indicator value given by experts.\nStep 3: Normalize the linguistic decision matrix Dl . In general, the decision matrix Dl should be normalized before solving the real assessment problems, except that all the assessment indicators have the same form. In this step, based on Table 4 and Fig. 3, the decision matrix Dl is normalized by utilizing the following equation: Li j {\nLi j for benefit indicator( Li j )c for cost indicator . (22)\nStep 4: Convert the normalized LTs into the corresponding IT2FSs, which can be represented by:\n\u02dc\u0303A \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 \u02dc\u0303A11 \u02dc\u0303A12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u02dc\u0303A1\u03b4 \u02dc\u0303A1, \u03b4+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u02dc\u0303A1, n \u02dc\u0303A21 \u02dc\u0303A22 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u02dc\u0303A2\u03b4 \u02dc\u0303A2, \u03b4+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u02dc\u0303A2, n ... ... . . . ... ... . . . ...\n\u02dc\u0303Am1 \u02dc\u0303Am2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u02dc\u0303Am\u03b4 \u02dc\u0303Am, \u03b4+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u02dc\u0303Am, n\n\u23a4 \u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 , (23)\nwhere \u02dc\u0303Ai j (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7m, j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n) denotes the corresponding IT2FSs.\nStep 5: Aggregate the converted IT2FSs by the weighted average (WA) operator. If the weights of the experts are not given, a general solution is thatwl 1 / q , (l 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , q), then the IT2FS-WA operator can be defined as:\nA\u0303i j I T 2FS \u2212 W A (( \u02dc\u0303Ai j )1 , ( \u02dc\u0303Ai j )2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ( \u02dc\u0303Ai j )q) \u2211q l 1 wl ( \u02dc\u0303Ai j )l\n\u23a1 \u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 (\u2211q l 1 wla L l1, \u2211q l 1 wla L l2, \u2211q l 1 wla L l3, \u2211q l 1 wla L l4; minl 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, q ( hL\u02dc\u0303Al )) ,\n(\u2211q l 1 wla U l1, \u2211q l 1 wla U l2, \u2211q l 1 wla U l3, \u2211q l 1 wla U l4; minl 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, q ( hU\u02dc\u0303Al\n)) \u23a4 \u23a5\u23a5\u23a6.\n(24)\nPhase II: Determinate the weight of indicator\nTheweights of indicators can have a significant impact on the assessment results. Nevertheless, it is hard to denote accurately the weights of indicators by using crisp number or LTs in the complex environments. In contrast, experts can make pairwise comparisons among indicators. In a more ideal situation, the preference degree (PD) between two indicators can be accurately measured by LTs. Therefore, in this paper, the preference relations (PRs) based on the IT2FSs are constructed to obtain the weights of indicators.\nStep 6: Establish the PRs matrix with LTs.\nTable 3 LTs and their corresponding IT2FSs\n(LT)C VI/ES QI/VS I/S M N/W NB/VW VN/EW\nExperts are invited to give the PDs between two indicators by LTs. Next, their LTs are converted into IT2FSs. Then, the converted IT2FSs are aggregated by WA operator. That is, the PRs matrix with IT2FSs is established as:\nA\u0303\u03c9 \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 A\u0303\u03c911 A\u0303 \u03c9 12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A\u0303\u03c91n A\u0303\u03c921 A\u0303 \u03c9 22 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A\u0303\u03c92n ... ... . . . ...\nA\u0303\u03c9n1 A\u0303 \u03c9 n2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A\u0303\u03c9nn\n\u23a4 \u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6, (25)\nwhere A\u0303\u03c9i j (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 n, j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n) denotes the corresponding IT2FSs and represents the PD of indicator C j ( j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n) for Ci (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n). In particular, A\u0303\u03c911 A\u0303\u03c922 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A\u0303\u03c9nn [(1, 1, 1, 1; 1), (1, 1, 1, 1; 0.9)].\nStep 7: Compute the PDs of one indicator over the others. The PD of indicator C j ( j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n) over the others can be computed by collecting the all elements (except C j j ) in the i th row of matrix A\u0303\u03c9 based on the IT2FPA operator (Eq. (26)).\nA\u0303\u03c9j I T2FPA ( A\u0303\u03c9j1, A\u0303 \u03c9 j2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , A\u0303\u03c9jn )\n\u23a1 \u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 \u239b \u239d \u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )) \u03b1L\u03be1\u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303 j\u03be )) , \u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )) \u03b1L\u03be2\u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303 j\u03be )) , \u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )) \u03b1L\u03be3\u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303 j\u03be )) , \u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )) \u03b1L\u03be4\u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303 j\u03be )) ; min \u03be 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, n ( hL A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )\u239e \u23a0, \u239b \u239d \u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be\n)) \u03b1U\u03be1\u2211n\n\u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be\n)) , \u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )) \u03b1U\u03be2\u2211n\n\u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be\n)) , \u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )) \u03b1U\u03be3\u2211n\n\u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be\n)) , \u2211n \u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )) \u03b1U\u03be4\u2211n\n\u03be 1 ( 1 + T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be )) ; min \u03be 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, n\n( hU A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be\n)\u239e \u23a0 \u23a4 \u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\nwhere T ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be ) \u2211M \u03be 1, \u03be \u03c8 ( 1 \u2212 d ( A\u0303\u03c9j\u03be , A\u0303 \u03c9 j\u03c8 ))\n(26)\nStep 8: Compute the weight of indicator. Basedon the likelihoodof twoPDsbetween two indicators\nI ( A\u0303\u03c9i \u2265 A\u0303\u03c9j ) , the weight of indicator Ci (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n) can be computed as: \u03c9i I ( A\u0303\u03c9i \u2265 A\u0303\u03c9j ) \u2211n\ni 1 I ( A\u0303\u03c9i \u2265 A\u0303\u03c9j ) . (27)\nPhase III: Obtain the ranking result\nThe traditional ORESTE method denotes the decisionmaking information only by using general ranking [64]. Nevertheless, the downside of this method is a loss of much valuable information, which may obtain an unreasonable result. In order to further improve the drawbacks of this method, the distance measure based on the extend vertex method are applied to establish GPS function since it encompasses more preference information on the PR between the indicators and the PR between the alternatives than general ranking.\nStep 9: Calculate the GPS G\u0303 ( Ai j ) of alternative Xi with\nrespect to the indicator C j . The maximum IT2FS A\u0303+\nj of Xi with respect to the C j are\ndefined as follows:\nA\u0303+ j \u23a7\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23a9 max i 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,m { A\u0303i j } , for the benefit indicator\nmin i 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,m\n{ A\u0303i j } , for the cost indicator\n(28)\nTheweight of themost significant indicatorC j are defined as follows:\n\u03c9+ max j 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, n\n{ \u03c9 j } max\nj 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, n\n{ A\u0303\u03c9j } (29)\nBased on the extend vertex method, let the distance measure d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303+j ) replace the R j (Xi ) and let the distance\nmeasure d ( \u03c9 j , \u03c9+ ) replace R j .\nThen, the GPS G\u0303 ( Xi j ) can be calculated as follows:\nG\u0303 ( Xi j ) \u221a \u03c1 ( d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303+j ))2 + (1 \u2212 \u03c1)(d(\u03c9 j , \u03c9+))2,\n(30)\nwhere \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1] is the coefficient to declare the importance between d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303+j ) and d ( \u03c9 j , \u03c9+ ) . Obviously, the smaller\nG\u0303 ( Xi j ) is, the closer A\u0303i j is to A\u0303+j and the better A\u0303i j should be. Step 10: Establish the global WR.\nThe average PD of the alternative Xi can be defined as follows:\n\u02dc\u0303R(Xi ) 1 n \u2211n j 1 G\u0303 ( Xi j )\n(31)\nThen, the WR can be obtained as follows: If \u02dc\u0303R(Xi ) \u2212 \u02dc\u0303R(X\u03ba) < 0, Xi P X\u03ba ; If \u02dc\u0303R(Xi ) \u2212 \u02dc\u0303R(X\u03ba) 0, Xi I X\u03ba . Step 11: Construct the PIR structure of alternatives\nXi (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m).\n(1) Calculate the PIs.\nThe PI of Xi over X\u03ba with respect to C j can be defined as follows: P\u0303j (Xi , X\u03ba) max [ \u02dc\u0303R(X\u03ba j )\u2212 \u02dc\u0303R(Xi j ), 0 ] (32)\nThe average PI of Xi over X\u03ba with respect to C j can be defined as:\nP\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba) \u2211n j 1 max [ \u02dc\u0303R(X\u03ba j )\u2212 \u02dc\u0303R(Xi j ), 0 ]\nn . (33)\nThe net PI of Xi over X\u03ba can be defined as:\nP\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba) P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba) \u2212 P\u0303(X\u03ba , Xi ). (34)\n(2) Determine the preference threshold (PT) and the indifference threshold (IT).\nThe PT \u03b5 can be defined as follows:\n\u03b5 \u03b3 n . (35)\nThe IT \u03bb can be defined as follows:\n{ \u03bb (n+2)\u03b32n , if n is odd\n\u03bb \u03b32 , if n is even , (36) where \u03b3 is PI indifference threshold that \u03b3 \u221a\u03c1 \u2217 (\u03c5/6) with \u03c5 being theminimal difference between LTs that sustain the indifference relation. The quantitative value of \u03c5 can be obtained on the basis of the real circumstances.\n(3) Construct the PIR structure.\nBased on the PT \u03b5 and IT\u03bb, the PIR structure is determined as follows:\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 Xi P X\u03ba , if \u2223\u2223\u2223 P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2265 \u03b5 and P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba ) > 0 X\u03ba P Xi , if \u2223\u2223\u2223 P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2265 \u03b5 and P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba ) \u2264 0 Xi I X\u03ba , if \u2223\u2223\u2223 P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 < \u03b5, P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba )<\u03bb and P\u0303(X\u03ba , Xi )<\u03bb Xi R X\u03ba , if \u2223\u2223\u2223 P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 < \u03b5, P\u0303(Xi , X\u03ba ) < \u03bb or P\u0303(X\u03ba , Xi ) < \u03bb .\n(37)\nStep 12: Obtain the strong ranking based on the WR and the PIR structure.\nThe developed IT2F-ORESTE method is an improved assessmentmethod ofRERunderCOVID-19 epidemic stress in which the preference values of alternatives are denoted by IT2FSs or crisp numbers and the weights of criteria are represented by IT2FSs. Compared with the forthcoming assessment method, the developed IT2F-ORESTE method can handle the indicator weights that are denoted as IT2FSs, which can to a great extent information loss in time of converting fuzzy weights into crisp number weights. What\u2019s more, PIR structure is applied to distinguish the specific relationships between alternatives. Surprisingly, the incomparable relation that forthcoming assessment method are neglected is taken into consideration. For understanding the developed IT2F-ORESTE method better, the flowchart of this method is shown in Fig. 4.\nA case study: the assessment of RER of cities under the stress of COVID-19 epidemic\nIn this section, the developed IT2F-ORESTE method with distance measure and likelihood is applied to assess the RER of cities under the stress of COVID-19 epidemic.\nCase description\nThe COVID-19, as an on-going global pandemic continually spreading across the world, has led to a truly worldwide crisis.An increasingnumber of scholars andgovernment officials have begun to put more emphasis on the geographically uneven impact and consequences of this pandemic. Different regions, in particular, are definitely discovered to possess a wide variation with regard to the efficacy of region policy/measure to contain it, and subsequent socio-economic consequences. Traditional regional structural advantages might lose advantages for economic resilience under the stress of COVID-19 epidemic. As an example, evidence has revealed that cities with dense market clustering and workforce base, or with wider global interconnections in supply chain have exhibited higher economic vulnerability.\nSuppose RER of five cities, including X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, are assessed under COVID-19 epidemic stress. In the indicator system shown as Fig. 2, the indicator C1 is quantitative indicator with known data while the others are qualitative ones with unknown data. The weights of these indicators are unknown. Five experts (E1, E2 and E3 from the regional economic field, E4 from government management field, E5 from medical care and public health field) are invited to give the initial preference value of indicator. The PDs between two indicators are represented by LTs. \u03c9 {\u03c9 j | j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n } is a set of criteria weights.

Let \u03b3 0.02, by applying Eq. (35) and Eq. (36), then \u03b5 0.00143,\u03bb 0.01.\nStep 12: Obtain the strong ranking based on the WR and the PIR structure.\nThe rank of RER of cities under the stress of COVID-19 are obtained as: X1 X2 X3 X4 X5. Obviously, the strong ranking result is the same as the weak ranking.\n(3) Construct the PIR structure.\nBased on the PT \u03b5 and IT\u03bb, the PIR structure is determined as shown in Table 13.\nBased on the weight of each indicator in Table 5, the four most significance indicator are epidemic prevention and control efforts (C\u030311), intensity of credit support (C\u03038), industrial clusters competitiveness (C\u03036) and industrial chain system (C\u03035). By means of inquiring experts, this result is consistent with real case. Because epidemic prevention and control is the foundation and guarantee for the rapid recovery of regional economy. The epidemic has interrupted the business plans of enterprises andmade them face difficulties in capital turnover. Credit support is an important means to maintain the normal operation of enterprises. At the same time, the impact of COVID-19 on regional economic development is typical of external shocks, so the more stable the industrial chain, the stronger the competitiveness of industrial clusters, the stronger the ability of regional economy to resist external shocks. At present, based on perfect industrial chain and strong industrial cluster competitiveness, city X1 has the highest level of regional economic development. Therefore, the ranking result accords with reality.\nMore importantly, the above ranking result can provide some valuable reference information for government departments at all levels with targeted operation. They can\nFurthermore, for exploring the effects of the parameters \u03b3 , \u03b5 and \u03bb on ranking results in this real case, based on the range of \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 0.105], distinct parameter \u03b3 can be assigned to acquire the parameters \u03b5 and \u03bb in five scenarios, and the corresponding results are shown in Table 14.\nBy applying the developed IT2F-ORESTE method, the PIR structure between cities can be acquired according with the three thresholds (\u03b3 , \u03b5 and \u03bb). In five different scenarios, the cities ranking based on the corresponding PIR structure all remain X1 X2 X3 X4 X5. Though with the gradual increase of \u03b3 , the values of \u03b5 and \u03bb change accordingly, the ranking results demonstrate a better degree of stability. That is, in this case (n 14), the values of parameters \u03b3 , \u03b5 and \u03bb may have no important effect on the ranking result.\nComparison analyses with the traditional ORESTE method\nIn this section, the case is solved by the traditional ORESTE method and the comparison are made with the IT2FORESTE method to demonstrate the superiority of the developed new method.\nStep 1: Aggregate global preference scores (GPS). Assume that R j is the original ranking of the important degree of criterion C j ( j 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 14) and R j (Xi ) is the original ranking of the preference value of alternative Xi (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5) under criterion C j . The results are shown in Table 15.\nLet \u03b7 0.5, the GPS can be aggregated by applying Eq. (15), and which is shown in Table 16.\nStep 2: Establish the global weak ranking (WR). Based on the Eq. (15), compute the global weak ranking\nR ( Xi j ) .\nStep 3: Compute the weak ranking of Xi (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5).\nLet\u03bc 0.001, \u03b8 0.2 and \u03d1 4, based on Eq. (19) and Eq. (20), the PIR structure is determined as shown in Table 19.\nStep 6: Determine the strong ranking based on the weak ranking and PIR.\nThe WR can be obtained as follows:\nX2 X1 X3 X4 X5\nActually, it is intuitive to see the ranking result based on the IT2F-OREST method is coordinate with the real situation, and the ranking result based on the traditional ORESTE method is contrary to the real situation. Therefore, the developed IT2F-OREST method is more reliable. In theory, compared with the traditional OREST method, the developed IT2F-OREST method has the following four advantages:\n(1) The decision matrixes obtained by applying the developed IT2F-OREST method can gather as much evaluation information as possible from experts by taking advantage of IT2FS. But the traditional ORESTmethod matrix is simply expressed by ranking and it is very hard for experts to reach a consensus on the rankings. (2) Comparing with the traditional OREST method, which the ranking is simply based on the distance measure, the developed IT2F-OREST method can more effectively reflect the conflicts between IT2FSs by the distance measure and likelihood measure. (3) Comparing with the traditional OREST method, the developed IT2F-ORESTmethod ismore reasonable and reliable by developing the PI indifference threshold \u03bc based on the IT2FS indifference threshold. (4) About the calculation process, the developed IT2FOREST method is more practical and flexible than the\ntraditional OREST method. Because when a new alternative is added, the traditional OREST method have to re-adjust the ranking and recalculate the preference scores of all the alternatives but the developed IT2FORESTmethod simply needs to calculate the preference scores of the added new alternative.\nComparison analyses with the other interval type-2 fuzzy MCDMmethod\nNext, for demonstrating in further detail, the superiority of the developed IT2F-OREST method, Mathew et al.\u2019 IT2FTOPSIS method [17], Wu et al.\u2019 IT2F- VIKORmethod [18], as well as Wang et al.\u2019 IT2F-MULTIMOORA method [19] are applied to solve the above-mentioned case of RER under COVID-19 epidemic stress. For guaranteeing the consistency of all the above-mentioned MADM methods, the distance measure based on Eq. (10) are applying to obtain the distance between the IT2FSs.\nComparing with the IT2F-TOPSIS method\nTOPSIS method is a more popular MADM method based on the utility value theory [17]. First, based on Eq. (10), the negative ideal separation matrix is built by computing\nd ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303\u2212j ) , where A\u0303\u2212 j is the worst A\u0303i j , which is shown in Table 20. In addition, the positive ideal separation matrix has been built, which is the same as Tables 8.\nNext, compute the relative closeness R1(Xi ) based on Eq. (38).\nR1(Xi ) \u221114 j 1 \u03c9 j d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303\u2212j ) \u221114\nj 1 \u03c9 j d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303\u2212j ) + \u221114 j 1 \u03c9 j d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303+j )\n(i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5). (38)\nThe detailed numerical results derived by the IT2FTOPSIS method is shown in Table 21.\nIn final, rank the cities based on the R1(Xi ) and get X1 X2 X3 X4 X5.\nThough the ranking result based on the IT2F-TOPSIS method is the same as the developed IT2F-OREST, the IT2F-TOPSIS method lose sight of the PIR relations. That is to say, the IT2F-TOPSIS method cannot takes into consideration their relationships flexibly, but in the developed IT2F-OREST method, some errors in the process of evaluation can be noticed by applying different thresholds. Generally, as the threshold changes, the difference between indicators may become smaller and smaller. In addition, in the IT2F-TOPSIS method, the relationships are strictly examined by the preference scores. If only the preference scores are the same, there is only indifference relationships, and if the preference are not same, there is a preference relationship.\nComparing with the IT2F-VIKORmethod\nVIKOR method as a classic MADM method to integrating utility values is widely recognized [18]. However, it has to be centered on the compromise solution. Let \u03c8 0.5 denotes the strategy of the maximum group utility. Next, compute the relative closeness R2(Xi ) based on Eq. (39).\nR2 (Xi ) \u03c8 (\u221114 j 1 \u03c9 j d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303 + j ))\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03c8) \u221114 j 1 \u03c9 j d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303 \u2212 j ) (i 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5) .\n(39)\nThe detailed numerical results derived by the IT2FVIKOR method is shown in Table 22.\nIn final, rank the cities based on the R2(Xi ) and get X5 X4 X3 X1 X2.\nObviously, the ranking result based on the IT2F-VIKOR method is the exact opposite of the ranking result based on the developed IT2F-OREST method. Compared with the new method, IT2F-VIKOR method widens the differences between two cities by regret measure and only divides the relationships into PI relation. In addition, it is difficult to obtain the strategy of the maximum group utility reasonably, but in real case, it has essential effect toward the ranking result.\nComparing with the IT2F-MULTIMOORAmethod\nThe MULTIMOORA method is a multiple objectives optimization method, which contains the ratio system, the reference point method and the full multiplicative form method [19].\nTable 20 The d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303\u2212j ) between each city and worst one on each indicator\nd ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303\u2212j ) C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7\nX1 0.9634 0.3456 0.1600 0.2110 0.4221 0.4674 0.3926 X2 0.6867 0.0000 0.2400 0.0000 0.1964 0.1600 0.5454 X3 0.2942 0.1930 0.0000 0.0369 0.1527 0.1600 0.4363 X4 0.0000 0.0800 0.1600 0.0400 0.0000 0.0000 0.5054 X5 0.0000 0.0000 0.1970 0.0738 0.2763 0.1600 0.0000 d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303\u2212j ) C8 C9 C10 C11 C12 C13 C14\nX1 0.1165 0.4654 0.1899 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.4854 X2 0.1930 0.3526 0.2665 0.1600 0.1200 0.2000 0.4317 X3 0.0000 0.0766 0.0000 0.3927 0.0400 0.3163 0.4652 X4 0.1165 0.0766 0.0766 0.4259 0.1564 0.3528 0.3528 X5 0.0400 0.0000 0.0369 0.4658 0.1930 0.4259 0.0000\nTable 21 The detailed numerical results derived by the IT2FTOPSIS method \u221114 j 1 \u03c9 j d\n( A\u0303i j , A\u0303\u2212j ) \u221114 j 1 \u03c9 j d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303+j ) R1(Xi ) Rank\nX1 0.2986 0.1234 0.7075 1 X2 0.2526 0.1705 0.5970 2 X3 0.1815 0.2426 0.4280 3 X4 0.1577 0.2823 0.3584 4 X5 0.1562 0.2851 0.3539 5\nTable 22 The detailed numerical results derived by the IT2F-TOPSIS method (\u03c8 0.5) \u221114 j 1 \u03c9 j d\n( A\u0303i j , A\u0303\u2212j ) \u221114 j 1 \u03c9 j d ( A\u0303i j , A\u0303+j ) R1(Xi ) Rank\nX1 0.2986 0.1234 0.2110 4 X2 0.2526 0.1705 0.2115 5 X3 0.1815 0.2426 0.2121 3 X4 0.1577 0.2823 0.2200 2 X5 0.1562 0.2851 0.2206 1\nFirst, based on Eq.

However, this synthetical method has no more detailed division as the developed IT2F-ORESTmethod.Most importantly, if the three methods obtain completely different ranking results, it will be very hard to obtain the ultimate reasonable ranking result.\nComparison summary\nBased on the above analyses, compared with the other three interval type-2 fuzzy MCDM methods, the developed IT2FOREST method has the following special superiorities:\n(1) The developed IT2F-ORESTmethod can give a detailed ranking result by using the PIR relationships among cities. Compared with above three methods, it can not only provide preference relationships, but also provide incomparable relationships and indifference relationships, which can reduce information distortion in the calculation and evaluation process. The results obtained by this method are more reliable and reasonable. (2) The application strategies obtained by the developed IT2F-OREST method are more realistic and practical. The ranking results can change with different thresholds. Therefore, decision maker can adjust the parameters based on the real situation and physical truth to obtain the comprehensive ranking results. (3) The preference index of each pair of alternatives is computed based on the likelihood of IT2FSs. In this method, the ranking results are acquired based on the comprehensive pairwise comparison of all alternatives, making themmore precise and persuasive. In addition, the IT2FORESTmethod are developed by applying the extended\nRation system Reference point Full multiplicative Final ranking\nvertex method for distance measure, which is a simple expression that needs few calculations. (4) In addition, the developed IT2F-OREST method can solve the MCDM problems with the quantitative and qualitative indicators and the weights of indicators are unknown.\nIn detail, the comparisons over these methods are simplified as shown in Table 24.\nPractical implications\nFor improving the regional economic restorability, some valuable practical implications based on the above evaluation results are suggested as follows:\n(1) The administrative department should speed up the improvement of the emergency support system, take the emergency supplies support as an important part, and establish a corresponding reserve of emergency supplies. Relevant working mechanisms and emergency plans should be formulated in accordance with the principle of centralized management and unified allocation, and effectively improve emergency response capabilities. (2) After theCOVID-19 outbreak is effectively contained, it is important to resume work and production in a timely manner to promote stable economic and social development. On one hand, the production order should be restored in different areas by zoning and grading, on the other hand, the resumption of work and production across the industrial chain need to be promoted.\n(3) The government should encourage commercial banks to speed up innovation and upgrading of financial services, and make full use of technologies such as big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence to speed up digital transformation. On the supply side, the supervision council will guide financial institutions to increase credit supply and provide greater support to the real economy, especially to enterprises heavily affected by the epidemic. On the demand side, the administration need to effectively expand domestic demand and make up for the shortage of external demand to help enterprises, especially foreign trade enterprises, effectively cope with the impact of the epidemic.\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 pandemic is considered to be the notorious economic shock arising throughout the year 2020. As a result, although the negative effects of the deadly CODIV-19 pandemic are still presented currently, the regional economic recovery phase must be projected to start due to the fact that regional economic development has plummeted to historic bottom. Quantitative research on the impact of major public health events on economic system can provide scientific support for improving the RER. In this paper, by developing an improved IT2F-ORESTEmethod based on the DM and likelihood of IT2FS, RER of different regions under the stress of COVID-19 are determined. First, some formulas are developed to convert quantitative PVs to IT2FSs for combining the quantitative and qualitative indicator information. Then, the\nvertexmethod forDMis extended to encompass IT2FSs. Furthermore, a comprehensive discussion between the improved IT2F-ORESTEmethod, the traditional ORESTEmethod and two representative IT2F-MCDM methods, are developed to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the improved IT2FORESTEmethod.The case studypresents a helpful reference for government departments to improve the RER.\nThe main contribution of this study to the current RER problem is the development of an improved IT2F-ORESTE method based on the DM and likelihood of IT2FS for dealing with RER assessment problem. Compared with current ORESTE method, the proposed method has some desirable capabilities for addressingMCDM-basedRERproblem. First, the proposed IT2F-OREST method can not only provide preference relationships, but also provide incomparable relationships and indifference relationships, which can reduce information distortion in the calculation and evaluation process. And it is developed by applying the extended vertexmethod for distancemeasure, which is a simple expression that needs few calculations. Second, decision maker can adjust the parameters based on the real situation and physical truth to obtain the comprehensive ranking results. More importantly, the proposed method can solve the MCDM problems with the quantitative and qualitative indicators and the weights of indicators are unknown.\nThere more or less are limitations existed in this study, which need to be remedied in the future. The optimum solution acquired by the proposed IT2F-ORESTE method may be inferior under certain criteria. In the future, the following aspects are worthy of further study. First, whether there are other meaningful indicators under more complex environments that can be included to improve indicator system is worthy of investigation. Second, in the process of evaluation, different experts may provide different ranking results, the consensus process among experts is a meaningful issue. Some recently developed consensus optimizationmodels can be introduced to improve theperformanceofmethod.Last but not least, for improving reliability and accuracy, some other meaningful ORESTE method with different fuzzy information forms can be used to resolve RER problem [65, 66]. Third, the application scopes of the improved IT2F-ORESTE method will be extended further to include economic\u2014ecological complex system restorability, regional economic competitiveness, enterprise sustainable development ability, etc.\nAcknowledgements This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71771140), Project of cultural masters and \u201cthe four kinds of a batch\u201d talents, Major bidding projects of National Social Science Fund of China (No. 19ZDA080), Humanities and Social Sciences General Research Program of the Ministry of Education (22YJC630025) and Funds of Humanity and Society Science Project of Shandong Province (No. 2020-NDJJ-02).\nAuthor contributions HG: conceptualization, formal analysis, methodology, resources, validation, writing\u2014original draft.
