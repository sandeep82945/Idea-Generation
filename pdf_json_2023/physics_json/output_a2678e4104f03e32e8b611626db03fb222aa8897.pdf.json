    "abstractText": "Leishmania mexicana (L. mexicana) is a causal agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a \u201cNeglected disease\u201d, for which the search for new drugs is a priority. Benzimidazole is a scaffold used to develop antiparasitic drugs; therefore, it is interesting molecule against L. mexicana. In this work, a ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) of the ZINC15 database was performed. Subsequently, molecular docking was used to predict the compounds with potential binding at the dimer interface of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) of L. mexicana (LmTIM). Compounds were selected on binding patterns, cost, and commercial availability for in vitro assays against L. mexicana blood promastigotes. The compounds were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation on LmTIM and its homologous human TIM. Finally, the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties were determined in silico. A total of 175 molecules with docking scores between \u221210.8 and \u22129.0 Kcal/mol were obtained. Compound E2 showed the best leishmanicidal activity (IC50 = 4.04 \u03bcM) with a value similar to the reference drug pentamidine (IC50 = 2.23 \u03bcM). Molecular dynamics analysis predicted low affinity for human TIM. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of the compounds were suitable for developing new leishmanicidal agents.",

Introduction\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a disease characterized by solitary or multiple ulcerated skin lesions [1]. The causative agents are Leishmania parasites transmitted by phlebotomid sandflies. In America, Leishmania mexicana (L. mexicana) and other subgenera are predominant agents [2,3]. Although CL is not a fatal disease, it does cause disability and permanent scars [4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends pentavalent antimonials as first-line drug treatment [5]. Alternatives include the use of liposomal amphotericin B. However, these compounds are toxic, have low efficacy in the chronic phase of the disease, and cannot be widely used due to their high cost and administration requirements [6]. These factors potentiate the search for new and more effective drugs against CL. In the last decades, different targets have been considered to develop new leishmanicidal agents, such as trypanothione reductase [7], cysteine proteinases [8], glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase [9], and triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) [10]. The latter\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 390. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16030390 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 390 2 of 16\nis involved in the fifth step of the glycolysis pathway and is essential in energy production [11,12]. TIM has structural differences with its human homologue, making the obtention of selective inhibitors possible. It has been widely studied in various protozoa as a pharmacological target [13\u201316], and, in this sense, the TIM of L. mexicana (LmTIM) can be considered a drug target for developing new leishmanicidal agents. Benzimidazole is an aromatic heterocyclic compound with a wide range of biological activities [17] as an antiviral [18], an anthelmintic [19], an antimicrobial [20], an antiparasitic [21], and others [22,23]. Hybrids of benzimidazole and pentamidine derivatives have been tested against L. mexicana [24]. For example, Torres-G\u00f3mez et al., showed that the compounds C1 and C2 (Table 1) were more active (IC50 = 0.712 and 0.368 \u00b5M, respectively) than pentamidine (IC50 = 9.568 \u00b5M). Subsequently, Nieto-Meneses et al. [25] obtained compounds C3 and C4 (Table 1) with better leishmanicidal activity (IC50 = 2.62 and 3.21 \u00b5M, respectively) than miltefosine (IC50 = 15.34 \u00b5M) and lower cytotoxicity (SI = 91.76 and 317.75, respectively) than miltefosine and amphotericin B (SI = 10.23 and 6.5, respectively). These studies showed the effectiveness of benzimidazole-containing compounds as leishmanicidal agents.\nTable 1.

Compound C2 has the best leishmanicidal activity (IC50 = 0.36 \u00b5M), and C5 shows a 70% inhibition on the LmTIM (Table 1) [10]. The binding site of the control compounds on the LmTIM protein (ID: 1AMK) for molecular docking analysis was established with the DoGSiteScorer tool. This pocket detection and analysis tool identifies potential binding pockets in protein structures. By default, it provides a simple drugability score for each pocket, based on a linear combination of three descriptors (volume, hydrophobicity, and enclosure) [27]. The results show the dimer interface as the best binding site with a drug score greater than 0.5. Additionally, a blind molecular docking was performed to assess the potential binding of each control compound at the site predicted by the DoGSiteScorer tool (assigning a docking score) [28]. In this study, blind molecular docking showed docking scores of \u22129.2 to \u22127.1 Kcal/mol of the control compounds at the LmTIM dimer interface (Table 1). Compound C6 had the lowest docking score of \u22129.2 Kcal/mol. The other five control compounds showed docking scores from \u22127.8 to \u22127.1 Kcal/mol (Figure 1). The interface, contrary to the active site, is a non-conserved site.

Molecular Dynamics Analysis\nMolecular dynamics simulation was performed to predict the stability of the ligand\u2013\nprotein complex due to the leishmanicidal effect of compounds P9 and E2, their high bind-\ning affinity, and an interaction profile similar to the control compounds at the LmTIM\ninterface. The apo form protein (LmTIM) and the control compound C6 in complex with\nLmTIM were also analyzed, considering previous studies [36,37].\nThe analysis of the apo-LmTIM protein showed a RMSD with a minimum of 0.01 \u00c5\nand a maximum of 3.12 \u00c5 , as well as a mean oscillation of 2.13 \u00c5 . The C6-LmTIM complex\nhad an RMSD of 5.62 to 15.77 \u00c5 and a mean oscillation of 7.62 \u00c5 . The E2-LmTIM complex\nfluctuated from 2.61 \u00c5 to 13.86 \u00c5 with a mean oscillation of 8.48 \u00c5 . The E2-LmTIM com-\nplex showed a change in the initial position in the first 20 ns (Figure S1 of the Supplemen-\ntary Material). After that, it remained stable until approximately 80 ns (with a RMSD mean\nof 3.65 \u00c5 ), again observing a fluctuation between 80-82 ns and continuing stable until 100\nns. On the other hand, the P9-LmTIM complex showed a fluctuation of 0.92 to 14.25 \u00c5 and\na mean oscillation of 9.01 \u00c5 (Figure 2A). The RMSD in the first 10 ns had a large fluctuation\nthat can be attributed to a change in the initial position of the compound at the binding\nsite (Figure S2 of the Supplementary Material). Subsequently, the complex had a stability\nof 10 to 80 ns (with a RMSD mean of 1.51 \u00c5 ).\nIn general, the compounds P9, E2, and the control ligand in complex with LmTIM\nhad a fluctuating behavior that suggests a change in the initial binding position [38,39].\nThe complex with the lowest RMSD and minimal differences between oscillations has\nbeen described as the most stable [40]. In this sense, the E2-LmTIM complex showed less\noscillation and better stability after 20 ns than the P9-LmTIM complex. Both complexes\nshowed a greater oscillation than the C6-LmTIM complex. Although an interaction profile\nanalysis of molecular dynamics allowed us to observe that some initial interactions were\nmaintained in both complexes (Figures S3 and S4 of the Supplementary Material).\n>148.63\nE2\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIE 7 of 17 nly co pound E9 presented a salt-bridge type interaction ith the Lys113 a ino acid residue in ono er B.

Molecular Dynamics Analysis\nMolecular dynamics simulation was performed to predict the stability of the ligand\u2013 protein complex due to the leishmanicidal effect of compounds P9 and E2, their high binding affinity, and an interaction profile similar to the control compounds at the LmTIM interface. The apo form protein (LmTIM) and the control compound C6 in complex with LmTIM were also analyzed, considering previous studies [36,37]. The analysis of the apo-LmTIM protein showed a RMSD with a minimum of 0.01 \u00c5 and a maximum of 3.12 \u00c5, as well as a mean oscillation of 2.13 \u00c5. The C6-LmTIM complex had an RMSD of 5.62 to 15.77 \u00c5 and a mean oscillation of 7.62 \u00c5. The E2-LmTIM complex fluctuated from 2.61 \u00c5 to 13.86 \u00c5 with a mean oscillation of 8.48 \u00c5. The E2-LmTIM complex showed a change in t e initial position in the first 20 ns (Figure S1 of the Supplementary Material). After that, it remained stable until approximat ly 80 ns (with a RMSD mean of 3.65 \u00c5), again observing a fluctuation between 80-82 ns and continuing stable until 100 ns. On the other hand, the P9-LmTIM complex showed a fluctuation of 0.92 to 14.25 \u00c5 and a mean oscillation of 9.01 \u00c5 (Figure 2A). The RMSD in the first 10 ns had a large fluctuation that can be attributed to a change in the initial position of the compound at the binding site (Figure S2 of the Supplementary Materia ). Subsequen ly, the complex had a stability of 10 to 80 ns (with a RMSD mean of 1.51 \u00c5). In general, the compounds P9, E2, and the control ligand in complex with LmTIM had a fluctuating behavior that suggests a change in he initial binding position [38,39]. The complex with the lowest RMSD and minimal differences between os illations has been described as the most stable [40]. In this sense, the E2-LmTIM complex showed less oscillation and better stability after 20 ns than the P9-LmTIM complex. Both l es showed a greater scillation than the C6-LmTIM complex. Although an interaction profile analysis of molecu ar dyna ics allowed us to observ that some initial interactio s were maintained in both complexes (Figures S3 and S4 of the Supplementary Material). The RMSF was also analyzed during molecular dynamics simulation (Figure 2B). The RMSF is a measure of the variation in the structure of a protein over time, calculated from a trajectory generated by molecular dynamics simulation. This measure allows evaluation of the stability and flexibility of the protein, as well as the influence of the interaction between the protein and the ligand on the stability of the system [41,42]. The RMSF results showed a similar fluctuation pattern between the apo-LmTIM and the protein in complex with the ligands. The apo-LmTIM protein showed a RMSF with a minimum of 0.52 \u00c5, a maximum of 3.23 \u00c5, and a mean oscillation of 1.20 \u00c5 (Figure 2B). The C6-LmTIM complex had a RMSF of 0.47 to 3.10 \u00c5 with a mean oscillation of 1.05 \u00c5. The E2-LmTIM complex showed a fluctuation from 0.50 \u00c5 to 3.19 \u00c5 with a mean oscillation of 1.14 \u00c5. The P9-LmTIM complex fluctuated from 0.47 to 3.08 \u00c5 with a mean oscillation of 1.07 \u00c5.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 390 8 of 16 Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 17\nFigure 2.

This finding has been described in the TIM of other species, such as Trypanosoma cruzi with approximately 82% identity to the LmTIM interface [43,44]. Finally, the rotation radius (Rg) of apo-LmTIM and the protein in complex with the compounds (C6, E2, and P9) (Figure 2C) was analyzed to predict the structural variations of the protein during the molecular dynamics analysis [45]. The free folding of LmTIM maintains an almost constant fluctuation between 24.79 and 25.98 \u00c5 with a difference in the oscillation of 1.19 \u00c5 during the 100 ns analyzed with a mean of 25.38 \u00c5 (Figure 2C). The C6-LmTIM complex fluctuated between 24.62 and 25.64 \u00c5 with a difference of 1.02 \u00c5. The E2-LmTIM complex fluctuated from 24.62 to 25.45 \u00c5 with a difference of 0.83 \u00c5, and the P9-LmTIM complex from 24.71 to 25.67 \u00c5 with a difference of 0.95 \u00c5. Similar Rg values in the three complexes and greater compactness in their dynamics suggest that ligand interactions do not influence the variation of the LmTIM structure [46].\n2.5. ADMET In Silico\nFinally, an in silico analysis of the molecular, pharmacokinetic (SwissADME), and hepatotoxicity (ProTox-II) physicochemical properties of compounds P9 and E2 was performed. The results are shown in Table 5.\nCompounds P9 and E2 complied with the Lipinski\u2019s rule, which plays an important role in drug discovery and development [47,48]. On the other hand, the predictive study showed high human intestinal absorption of the two compounds. Furthermore, moderate solubility was predicted. However, these compounds are substrates of P-glycoprotein, an efflux pump that plays an important role in normal physiological detoxification and is associated with drug resistance [49]. Some antibiotics and anticancer drugs have been described that can be P-glycoprotein substrates and be used [50]. Hepatotoxicity predictions were negative, and regarding CYP450 inhibition, they showed that, according to structure, compound E2 inhibits two isoforms (1A2 and 2C19). Compound P9 is likely an inhibitor of the four CYP450 isoforms analyzed, giving rise to drug\u2013drug interactions. It would be important to search for optimization in the bioavailability of this class of compounds with leishmanicidal potential.\n2.6. Molecular Docking on HsTIM\nCompounds C6, E2, and P9 were evaluated against HsTIM by molecular docking (Figure 3) to establish the potential selectivity. Control compound C6 showed a docking score of \u22126.3 Kcal/mol and seven hydrophobic contacts with Asn71 in monomer A and Asn15, Leu21, Leu24, Leu236, Leu237 in monomer B. Compound P9 exhibited a docking score of \u22125.8 Kcal/mol. The phenyl ring of P9 was oriented towards the leucine triad\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 390 10 of 16\n(Leu21, Leu24, and Leu236 in the B monomer), which led to the formation of hydrophobic interactions between the carbons of the leucine residues and the carbons of the aromatic ring. Compound E2 presented a docking score of \u22126.2 Kcal/mol. It only showed interactions with three residues forming four hydrogen bonds, a hydrophobic interaction, and a salt bridge with Arg17, Asn71, and Lys84 in monomer A (Figure 3).\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 17 Hepatotoxicity predictions were negative, and regarding CYP450 inhibition, they showed that, according to structure, compound E2 inhibits two isoforms (1A2 and 2C19).

Control Compounds\nSix compounds (C1\u2013C6) with leishmanicidal or inhibitory activity against LmTIM were sketched in ChemDraw and saved in SDF format. Subsequently, they were minimized and converted to pdbqt format with OpenBabel.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 390 12 of 16\n3.2. Molecular Docking Analysis\nThe crystallographic structure of the LmTIM protein was obtained from the protein data bank (PDB) (http://www.pdb.org, accessed on 20 March 2020) [51] with the ID: 1AMK (resolution 1.83 \u00c5), as well as the HsTIM structure with the ID: 4POC. The structures were prepared for molecular docking with the UCSF Chimera 1.14.1 DockPrep tool (The Regents of the University of California, Oakland, California) [52]. Additionally, the prepare_receptor4.py script from MGLTools 1.5.6 (Center for Computational Structural Biology, La Jolla, California) was used to add AutoDock atom types and Gasteiger charges to them. The prediction of potential binding sites on LmTIM was first performed using the DoGSiteScorer tool (Center for Bioinformatics, Bundesstr, Germany) from the Proteins Plus server (https://proteins.plus/) (accessed on 23 March 2020) [53]. Subsequently, a blind molecular docking was performed. For this, the receptor was defined as rigid, and the docking protocol was setup up and performed with PyRx software, which works with AutoDock vina 1.1.2 [54]. For docking at the binding site, the conformational search space was determined by setting the coordinates to the center of the residues at the interface (X = \u22125.933, Y = \u22128.890, and Z = 7.297) using the PyRx software. The binding site on HsTIM was determined by overlap between LmTIM (ID: 1AMK) and HsTIM apoprotein (ID: 4POC) using UCSF Chimera. Based on binding site prediction, the dimer interface residues were selected for a guided molecular docking on both LmTIM and HsTIM as previously described [55].\n3.3. Ligand-Based Virtual Screening\nLBVS was carried out by substructure search using the benzimidazole scaffold in the ZINC15 database (https://zinc15.docking.org/) (accessed on 28 March 2020) [56]. Subsequently, the structures were obtained using SMILES representations. Lipinski\u2019s rule was applied using the OpenBabel program. Finally, the structures were prepared for molecular docking at the LmTIM interface using the PyRx program, using the affinity energy of the compound C6 (\u22129.2 Kcal/mol) as the cutoff. Subsequently, through the PLIP web server, an interaction profile was generated for each of the complexes [57]. With the scikit-learn library and the DataWarrior program (https://openmolecules.org/ datawarrior/) (accessed on 23 March 2020) [58,59], the compounds were clustered according to their interaction profiles and the kind structure similarity. Finally, two compounds were selected based on cost and availability for evaluation against L. mexicana promastigotes and molecular dynamics analysis.\n3.4. In Vitro Leishmanicidal Activity\nThe leishmanicidal assay was carried out following the procedure reported by Mu\u00f1oz et al. [60] and Inchausti et al. [61]. The strain of L. mexicana MHOM/MX/2011/Lacandona, kindly donated by Dr. Ingeborg Becker Fauser of the UNAM, was used, which was maintained in Schneider culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); parasites in the log phase of their growth cycle were transferred to a microplate (96 wells; 1 \u00d7 106 parasites/well). Stock solutions of DMSO (blank), pentamidine (positive control), and benzimidazole derivatives were diluted in Schneider\u2019s medium to <100 \u00b5g/mL, added to the plate, and incubated at 27 \u25e6C for 72 h. IC50 values (\u00b5g/mL) were obtained using the Biostat 2009 statistical program. Subsequently, the results were converted to micromolar. The benzimidazole derivatives (P9 and E2) were purchased from MolPort and worked up without further purification. The assay was performed in triplicate.\n3.5. Molecular Dynamics Analysis\nFor the analysis of the molecular dynamics of compounds P9 and E2, the open source software package GROMACS 5.1.2 [62] was used. Protein ID: 1AMK was parameterized in the AMBER03 force field (ff94/ff99 modification by Duan et al. [63] with the GROMACS pdb2gmx software package. The protonation state of the protein, pH 7, was previously calculated with the PROPKA tool implemented in UCSF Chimera. On the other hand, the\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 390 13 of 16\ntopology of the compounds was generated with ACPYPE Server (http://webapps.ccpn.ac. uk/acpype accessed 18 May 2020) [64], which is based on the General Amber Force Field (GAFF). The system was a dodecahedron with periodic boundary conditions. In addition to containing the protein\u2013ligand complex, it was filled with TIP3P water molecules and the number of ions (Cl\u2212 or Na+) necessary to have a neutral charge in the system. Before running the dynamics, the system was energetically minimized using the steepest descent algorithm. Then, two equilibrium steps were performed with 1000 kJ/mol nm2 constraints on the movement of light and heavy proteins and atoms. The first stage was at constant pressure, implementing the frog-jump method and the v-rescale thermostat to bring the system from 0 to 300 K. The second stage was performed at constant temperature again with the frog-jump method, but now with the Berendsen barostat method to bring the system from 1 to 2 bar. Both stages achieved a duration of 100 ps. Once the system was balanced, molecular dynamics was performed with a trajectory of 100 ns for LmTIM and 120 ns for HsTIM, where interactions and long-range forces were calculated with the particlemesh Ewald (PME) method, establishing the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb contributions at 1.2. nm, balancing the system with samples at 100 ps. The stability of the complexes was determined using the GROMACS software tools and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the \u03b1 carbons and the ligand was obtained, and the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of \u03b1 carbons, together with two-dimensional structure and the radius of gyration (Rg), were calculated.3.6. Analysis of Molecular Physicochemical Properties. Compounds P9 and E2 were analyzed in silico with the SwissADME website (http://www.swissadme.ch/, accessed 20 August 2021) [65] to determine their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, as well as their hepatotoxicity from the ProTox-II server (https://tox-new.charite.de/protox_II/, accessed 24 October 2021) [66].\n4. Conclusions\nIn this work, a virtual screening based on the benzimidazole scaffold, and a molecular docking directed at the LmTIM dimer interface, allowed the prediction of 175 new benzimidazole derivatives with docking scores between 10.8 and \u22129.0 Kcal/mol on LmTIM. The in vitro evaluation against the promastigote forms of L. mexicana determined that compound E2 has better leishmanicidal activity than P9 and a value similar to pentamidine. Finally, a low affinity (\u22125.8 Kcal/mol) for E2 and the molecular dynamics studies at the HsTIM interface suggest selectivity on LmTIM. These results encourage us to continue the study of benzimidazole derivatives to obtain new and more selective leishmanicidal agents.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph16030390/s1, Figure S1: Molecular dynamics trajectory analysis of the E2-LmTIM complex; Figure S2:Molecular dynamics trajectory analysis of the P9-LmTIM complex; Figure S3: Interaction profile of the P9-LmTIM complex during molecular dynamics analysis; Figure S4: Interaction profile of the E2-LmTIM complex during molecular dynamics analysis.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.R.; methodology, L.K.V.-J., A.J.-S., T.D.-M., M.J.C.-B. and L.D.G.-M.; software, L.K.V.-J., T.D.-M., E.O.-P. and A.J.-S.; validation, E.E.L.-R., E.R.-M., A.J.-S. and I.P.; formal analysis, E.O.-P.; resources, E.R.-M., E.E.L.-R. and G.R.; data curation, T.D.-M. and L.K.V.-J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.K.V.-J. and G.R.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.D.G.-M., E.E.L.-R., M.J.C.-B., I.P., E.R.-M. and G.R.; supervision, M.J.C.-B., E.E.L.-R., I.P. and E.R.-M.; project administration, E.O.-P.; funding acquisition, M.J.C.-B., E.R.-M. and G.R.
