    "abstractText": "If a quantum field theory has a Landau pole, the theory is usually called \u2018sick\u2019 and dismissed as a candidate for an interacting UV-complete theory. In a recent study on the interacting 4d O(N) model at large N, it was shown that at the Landau pole, observables remain well-defined and finite. In this work, I investigate both relevant and irrelevant deformations of the said model at the Landau pole, finding that physical observables remain unaffected. Apparently, the Landau pole in this theory is benign. As a phenomenological application, I compare the O(N) model to QCD by identifying \u039bMS with the Landau pole in the O(N) model.",

In modern notation, the QED running coupling to leading order in perturbation theory becomes\n\u03b1(\u00b5\u0304) = 1\n2 3\u03c0 ln \u039bLP \u00b5\u0304\n, (1)\nwhere it is customary to fix \u039bLP = mee 3\u03c0 2\u03b10 with me, the electron mass, and \u03b10 \u2243 1137 . Landau noted that besides the dependence of the fine-structure constant \u03b1 on the momentum scale \u00b5\u0304, the form (1) implied that the running coupling is diverging (has a pole) at a finite momentum scale \u00b5\u0304 = \u039bLP. Since the coupling diverges at this scale, it seems that one cannot meaningfully probe momentum scales \u00b5\u0304 > \u039bLP in QED, so the theory does not have a well-defined continuum limit. It has even been suggested that Landau was so disturbed by this feature that he quit working on quantum field theory (I thank Bill Zajc for pointing out that this statement is not true, assuming the the publication dates of papers are chronologically matched to his actual work. However, Landau\u2019s view of QFT seems to have been fairly negative after 1954, e.g., in Ref. [2], the authors write \u201cThis brings us to the conclusion that point interaction is impossible in pure electrodynamics.\u201d and in Ref. [3] Kirzhnits and Linde write about Ref. [4], \u201c. . . , which even led some authors to the conclusion that the hamiltonian quantum field theory \u201cis dead\u201d . . . \u201d. See Ref. [5] (chapter 8) for a first-hand historical account of Landau\u2019s approach to QED). Modern physics deals with the issue of the Landau pole through a mix of denial and shoulder shrugging. Denial adherents will rightly point out that (1) was derived in perturbation theory, requiring \u03b1 \u226a 1, so that as a consequence, (1) cannot be expected to correctly capture features such as the Landau pole, where, by definition, \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. Shrugging adherents will (also rightly) point out that\n\u039bLP = mee 3\u03c0 2\u03b10 \u2243 10280 MeV (2)\nAppliedMath 2024, 4, 55\u201369. https://doi.org/10.3390/appliedmath4010003 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/appliedmath\nputs the scale of the Landau pole beyond the Planck scale, so that in practice, it is entirely pointless to understand QED in that regime anyway. (However, it should be noted that in the full Standard Model, \u039bLP \u2243 1034 GeV is much lower than (2) but still extremely high [6].) The prevailing dogma in both cases is that theories with a Landau pole should be viewed as \u2018UV-incomplete\u2019, or cut-off theories, that cannot be used to describe continuum physics. In this work, I will entertain an entirely different perspective, namely that physical observables of a quantum field theory could be well-behaved even when the coupling diverges at the Landau pole and beyond. Unfortunately, I am unable to test my perspective in QED (yet), even though other groups have proposed similar ideas [7,8]. Instead, I will focus on a quantum field theory that can be solved non-perturbatively in the limit of a large number of components, namely the O(N) model [9], using critically important input from PT -symmetric field theory [10]. I will work in 3 + 1 dimensions, where the O(N) model is known to possess a Landau pole in the large N limit. In a quantum field theory, the renormalized coupling is not directly observable, as is apparent through the fact that it will depend on the fictitious renormalization scale \u00b5\u0304. For this reason, finite and well-defined physical observables at an infinite renormalized coupling are certainly possible. Indeed, the idea that physical observables turn out to be finite even when the coupling diverges is well supported by several quantum field theory examples, such as N = 4 SYM in 3 + 1 dimensions [11,12], bosonic and fermionic large N field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions [13\u201316], as well as non-relativistic fermions at a Feshbach resonance where experimental confirmation is available [17]. In this work, I build upon and extend this idea: if physical observables remain finite when the renormalized coupling parameter diverges, maybe observables remain finite and well-defined when the renormalized coupling parameter becomes negative or even complex. After all, the renormalized coupling parameter is not directly observable, so nothing should protect it from becoming complex as long as the physical observables remain well-defined. Of course this type of idea cannot be tested in perturbation theory, which is inherently a weak-coupling expansion around non-interacting field theory. For this reason, I heavily employ large N expansion techniques (which do not rely on a small perturbative coupling in order to be applicable), as well as results from PT -symmetric field theory (which allow calculations for negative or complex couplings via analytic continuation). While this study is exploratory, I nevertheless hope that certain aspects merit further consideration when trying to interpret quantum field theory in four dimensions."

            "text": "Let me first consider the case of the massless theory with quartic interactions, which is essentially a repeat of the calculation in Ref. [9] but is included here for completeness. The partition function for this theory is defined through the path integral\nZ(\u03bb, \u03b2) = \u222b D\u03d5e\u2212SE , (3)\nwith the Euclidean action\nSE = \u222b d3x \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c4 [ 1 2 \u2202\u00b5\u03d5\u20d7 \u00b7 \u2202\u00b5\u03d5\u20d7 + \u03bb N ( \u03d5\u20d7 \u00b7 \u03d5\u20d7 )2] , (4)\nwhere \u03d5\u20d7 = (\u03d51, \u03d52, . . . , \u03d5N) is an N-component scalar field, and the theory is defined on the thermal cylinder, with \u03b2 = 1T being the inverse temperature. The partition function may be rewritten in a more convenient form by introducing two auxiliary fields \u03c3, \u03b6 with (cf. Ref. [18])\n1 = \u222b D\u03c3\u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03d5\u20d72) = \u222b D\u03c3 \u222b D\u03b6ei \u222b \u03b6(\u03c3\u2212\u03d5\u20d72) . (5)\nThe resulting path integral for \u03c3 has quadratic action such that \u03c3 can be integrated out. One finds\nZ(\u03bb, \u03b2) = \u222b D\u03d5D\u03b6e\u2212Seff , Seff = \u222b d3x \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c4 [ 1 2 \u03d5\u20d7[\u2212\u25a1+ 2i\u03b6]\u03d5\u20d7 + N \u03b6 2 4\u03bb ] . (6)\nSeparating the auxiliary field into zero modes and fluctuations such that \u03b6(x) = \u03b60 2 + \u03b6\n\u2032(x), one can verify that the path integral over fluctuations does not contribute to the leading order in large N to the partition function. Since \u03b60 is a constant, the path integral over fields \u03d5\u20d7 is quadratic and can be carried out in closed form. One finds Z(\u03bb, \u03b2) =\u222b\nd\u03b60eN\u03b2Vp( \u221a 2i\u03b60), with the pressure per component in dimensional regularization\np(m) = m4\n16\u03bb +\nm4\n64\u03c02 ( 1 \u03b5 + ln \u00b5\u03042e 3 2 m2 ) + m2T2 2\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK2(n\u03b2m) n2 , (7)\nwhere \u03b2V is the space\u2013time volume, \u00b5\u0304 is the MS renormalization scale, Ki(x) denotes modified Bessel functions of the second kind, and I have rewritten i\u03b60 = m 2\n2 to simplify the appearance. The expression (7) is divergent in the continuum lim \u03b5 \u2192 0. However, it may be non-perturbatively renormalized as\n1 \u03bb + 1 4\u03c02\u03b5 = 1 \u03bbR(\u00b5\u0304) , (8)\nwhich is standard procedure for large N field theories [19]. The resulting running coupling is given by\n\u03bbR(\u00b5\u0304) = 4\u03c02\nln \u039b 2 LP\n\u00b5\u03042\n, (9)\nwhich has a Landau pole at \u00b5\u0304 = \u039bLP, cf. Figure 1.\nIn order to make sense of the theory at the Landau pole, a procedure for analytically continuing the theory beyond the Landau pole is necessary. This procedure has been provided in the form of a conjecture in Ref. [10] for so-called PT -symmetric field theory (note that the conjecture in Ref. [10] has been formulated at zero temperature and checks exist only for d = 1 (quantum mechanics); I thank W. Ai for pointing this out to me). Naively continuing (9) for \u00b5\u0304 > \u039bLP, the sign of \u03bbR becomes negative. Thus, in order to\nmake sense of the O(N) model beyond the Landau pole, one is led to consider a theory where the sign of the coupling is flipped:\n\u03bb \u2192 \u2212g + i0+ , (10)\nwhere the small imaginary part has been included in order to be able to \u2018go around\u2019 the Landau pole. Following standard nomenclature [20], the theory with flipped-sign coupling is referred to as PT -symmetric field theory, and its partition function is denoted by ZPT (g, \u03b2). Following Ref. [10], the analytic continuation of Z(\u03bb, \u03b2) is given by\nln ZPT (g, \u03b2) = Re ln Z(\u03bb = \u2212g + i0+, \u03b2) . (11)\nTo evaluate ZPT (g, \u03b2), one may directly employ the pressure function (7), where now the sign of the coupling has been flipped. Regardless of the sign of the coupling, the expression for the pressure (7) is divergent in the 4d continuum lim \u03b5 \u2192 0. The PT - coupling renormalization, given by\n1 g \u2212 1 4\u03c02\u03b5 = 1 gR(\u00b5\u0304) , (12)\ndiffers from (8) by a sign, making the PT -symmetric theory asymptotically free. Using the renormalized coupling gR(\u00b5\u0304), one can express the renormalized pressure function as\np(m) = \u2212 m 4\n16gR(\u00b5\u0304) +\nm4\n64\u03c02 ln\n\u00b5\u03042e 3 2\nm2 +\nm2T2 2\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK2(n\u03b2m) n2 . (13)\nThe pressure, being a physical observable, cannot depend on the choice of renormalization scale \u00b5\u0304, so dpd ln \u00b5\u0304 = 0. This fixes the running for the renormalized coupling gR(\u00b5\u0304) and, as a consequence, the form of the running coupling itself as\ngR(\u00b5\u0304) = 4\u03c02\nln \u00b5\u0304 2\n\u039b2LP\n, (14)\nwhich is the same as (9) up to a sign. Both running couplings are shown in Figure 1, where it can be seen that they diverge at \u00b5\u0304 = \u039bLP. Whereas \u00b5\u0304 = \u039bLP is the Landau pole in the O(N) model, when interpreted through PT-symmetric field theory, \u039bLP has all the trappings of an infrared scale parameter reminiscent of QCD (cf. Section 3). For completeness, the \u03b2-function for the PT -symmetric theory in d = 4 \u2212 2\u03b5 dimensions with \u03b5 \u226a 1 is explicitly calculated as\n\u03b2(gR) = \u2202gR(\u00b5\u0304) \u2202 ln \u00b5\u03042\n= \u2212gR (\ngR(\u00b5\u0304) 4\u03c02 + \u03b5\n) , (15)\nwhich is seen to be negative in d = 4. A comparison with the perturbative (weak-coupling) result for \u03b2 (Equation (10.54) in [21]) shows that the large N \u03b2-function is only 1/9th of the N = 1 weak-coupling result. The remainder of the complete perturbative contribution arises at next-to-leading order in the large N expansion. From the form (15), it is also easy to discuss the fixed-point structure of the theory. In d = 4\u2212 2\u03b5 dimensions, the PT -symmetric O(N) model possesses two fixed points, one at gR = 0 and the other at gR = \u22124\u03c02\u03b5. From the running coupling gR(\u00b5\u0304) shown in Figure 1, it is clear that gR = \u22124\u03c02\u03b5 corresponds to the IR fixed point of the theory. Flipping the sign of both the coupling and \u03b5, one finds that this fixed point is the same as the UV fixed point of the original theory specified by (4) in d = 4 + 2\u03b5 dimensions. This is consistent with the known critical dimensions 4 < d < 6 for which the O(N) model can be non-perturbatively renormalized [22]; see also [23].\nInserting the form (14) of the running coupling into (13), one obtains\np(m) = m4\n64\u03c02 ln\n\u039b2LPe 3 2\nm2 +\nm2T2 2\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK2(n\u03b2m) n2 . (16)\nAt this point, it is worthwhile to pause and consider the following observations:\n\u2022 Any dependence of p(m) on the unphysical renormalization scale \u00b5\u0304 has dropped out; \u2022 The expression (16) is identical to (13) evaluated at a the Landau pole, \u00b5\u0304 = \u039bLP; \u2022 The pressure in the (flipped sign coupling and asymptotically free) PT -symmetric\ntheory (16) is identical to the pressure in the original O(N) model (7), as can be seen by inserting Equations (8) and (9) into (7);\n\u2022 For generic values of m, the pressure at the Landau pole will be finite rather than infinite.\nAs a consequence of these observations, the O(N) model and the PT -symmetric O(N) model are identical at large N, even though from Figure 1, one of these has a Landau pole, and the other one is asymptotically free. For this reason, I will refer to the scale \u00b5\u0304 = \u039bLP as \u2018the Landau pole\u2019 in the PT -symmetric theory. One can calculate the pressure for any temperature T by noting that the remaining single integral over \u03b60 in the partition function is again dominated by the saddle points at large N, so that the physical pressure of the theory per component is given by (16), with m = m\u0304 being the solution to\n0 = dp(m)\ndm2 =\nm2\n32\u03c02 ln\n\u039b2LPe 1\nm2 \u2212 mT 4\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK1(n\u03b2m) n . (17)\nIf (17) has more than one solution (as it generically does), then in the large N limit, the solution with the biggest real part of p(m\u0304) will dominate over all others. At zero temperature (a.k.a. the vacuum), a simple solution to (17) is m\u0304 = 0, which corresponds to the usual starting point for perturbative calculations. However, there is a second solution to (17) located at m\u0304 = \u039bLP \u221a e, which is usually dismissed as \u2018being too close to the Landau pole\u2019 [19]. However, the physical pressure per component for this second solution is given by\np(m = \u039bLP \u221a e, T = 0) = \u039b4LPe 2\n128\u03c02 , (18)\nwhich is perfectly finite. In addition, since p(m = \u039bLP \u221a\ne) > p(m = 0), the solution (18) is thermodynamically preferred over the perturbative vacuum. (It is perhaps worth mentioning that some early studies of the O(N) model in 3 + 1 dimensions came to the conclusion that it contains tachyons or an instability to spontaneous generation of a large vacuum expectation value \u27e8\u03d5\u20d7\u27e9 [24,25]. However, as pointed out already in Ref. [26], none of these are expected to happen for the thermodynamically preferred phase at large N.) Despite the presence of the Landau pole, observables in the bosonic theory seem to make physical sense. For instance, one can calculate thermodynamic properties at finite temperatures by tracking solutions to (17) numerically and evaluating p(m\u0304). As discussed in Ref. [9], at small temperatures, the numerical solution m\u0304 of the thermodynamically preferred phase is continuously connected to m\u0304(T = 0) = \u221a e\u039bLP. The numerical solution m\u0304 becomes complex above a critical temperature T = Tc \u2243 \u039bLP/ \u221a\ne, but using results from PT -symmetric field theory [10], the analytically continued pressure is continuous across T = Tc. A plot of the pressure as a function of temperature from Ref. [9] is reproduced in Figure 2, and results for the entropy and specific heat can be found in Ref. [9]. Besides the pressure, one may look at other observables. For instance, one can calculate the spectral function for the auxiliary field \u03b6 \u2032, finding a stable bound state in the lowtemperature phase [26,27]. This is different from the situation in QED, where one encounters a tachyon (also sometimes called Landau\u2019s ghost) instead of a stable bound state [3]. This\nis the main reason why this work is concerned with the Landau pole in the O(N) model rather than QED."

Thus, the bare sextic coupling parameter also needs to be renormalized as\n\u03b1 g3 = \u03b1R(\u00b5\u0304)\ng3R(\u00b5\u0304) . (34)\nThis leaves the whole tower of additional terms \u03b1 2n\ng2n+3 , n \u2265 1 that are potentially divergent. However, one finds that, in the \u03b5 \u2192 0 limit,\n\u03b12n\ng2n+3 =\n\u03b12nR (\u00b5\u0304)\ng6nR (\u00b5\u0304) 1 g3\u22124n =\n\u03b12nR (\u00b5\u0304) g6nR (\u00b5\u0304) 1(\n1 gR(\u00b5\u0304) + 14\u03c02\u03b5 )4n\u22123 \u2192 0 , (35) because n \u2265 1. Therefore, none of these terms contribute, and one is left with\np(m) = m6\nM2 +\nm4\n64\u03c02 ln\n\u039b2LPe 3 2\nm2 +\nm2T2 2\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK2(n\u03b2m) n2 , (36)\nwhere I have used the renormalization group invariance of the pressure to express\n\u03b1R(\u00b5\u0304)\n64g3R(\u00b5\u0304) =\n1 M2 , (37)\nwith a constant mass scale M. One observes that for the same reason as (35), expanding the square root in (30) is justified for \u03c3(1)0 .\nFor the second solution \u03c30 = \u03c3 (2) 0 , (29) becomes\np(m) = 4g3\n27\u03b12 +\ngm2\n3\u03b1 +\nm4\n16g \u2212 \u03b1m\n6\n64g3 +\nm4\n64\u03c02 ( 1 \u03b5 + ln \u00b5\u03042e 3 2 m2 ) + m2T2 2\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK2(n\u03b2m) n2 + . . . (38)\nThe explicit 1\u03b5 divergence can by renormalizing the coupling g, but the sign of the counterterm must be flipped (and, as a consequence, so must the sign of the running coupling). One obtains\np(m) = 4g3\n27\u03b12 +\ngm2\n3\u03b1 +\nm4\n16gR(\u00b5\u0304) \u2212 \u03b1m\n6\n64g3 +\nm4\n64\u03c02 ln\n\u00b5\u03042e 3 2\nm2 +\nm2T2 2\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK2(n\u03b2m) n2 + . . . (39)\nRenormalizing the sextic coupling \u03b1 as in (37), the square-root expansion in (30) is justified also for \u03c3(2)0 . Similar to (35), terms with positive powers of the bare coupling g in the numerator vanish so that one finds\np(m) = M4 27, 648 g3 \u2212 m 6 M2 + m4 64\u03c02 ln \u039b2LPe 3 2 m2 + m2T2 2\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK2(n\u03b2m) n2\n(40)\nThis expression still has a divergent term \u221d 1g3 , but this term is independent from m. For this reason, this last divergence can be canceled by a vacuum pressure counterterm in the Lagrangian, leading to\np(m) = \u2212 m 6\nM2 +\nm4\n64\u03c02 ln\n\u039b2LPe 3 2\nm2 +\nm2T2 2\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK2(n\u03b2m) n2 . (41)\nInspecting (36) and (41), one finds that the two saddle point solutions for \u03c30 give rise to the same form for the pressure function, except for the sign of the m6 term, which can be attributed to the fact that the sign of gR(\u00b5\u0304) is flipped for the solution \u03c3 (1) 0 .\nThe final integral over \u03b60 is carried out by finding the saddle point solution\n0 = dp dm2 = \u00b13m\n4\nM2 +\nm2\n32\u03c02 ln\n\u039b2LPe 1\nm2 \u2212 mT 4\u03c02 \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nK1(n\u03b2m) n , (42)\nwhere \u00b1 corresponds to the solutions \u03c3(1,2)0 , respectively. At zero temperature, where the contribution from the modified Bessel function vanishes, there is a different number of solutions depending on the sign in (42) and magnitude of M2. For a positive sign (corresponding to solution \u03c3(1)0 above) and large M\n2, there are three solutions: m\u0304 = 0, m\u0304 \u2243 \u039bLP \u221a e, and m\u0304 \u221d M up to logarithmic corrections. Of these, the saddle with the largest pressure (lowest free energy) is m\u0304 \u2243 \u039bLP \u221a\ne; hence, this is the dominant saddle point at large N. One thus again recovers the solution (18). As M2 decreases, the situation remains qualitatively the same until M \u2272 84\u039bLP, at which point solutions (except for m\u0304 = 0) become complex-valued. However, close to the Landau pole where gR(\u00b5\u0304 = \u039bLP) \u2192 \u221e, (37) suggests that M2 \u2192 \u221e, so I will not consider small values of M in the following. For the negative sign in (42) and large M2, there are two solutions, m\u0304 = 0 and m\u0304 \u2243 \u039bLP \u221a e, where again the second solution is thermodynamically preferred. Therefore, one also recovers the unmodified theory solution (18) for the second solution \u03c3(2)0 ."

            "text": "As mentioned above, the running coupling of a quantum field theory is not directly observable because it is a renormalization-scheme-dependent quantity. However, observables in a quantum field theory can depend in a non-trivial manner on the coupling parameter of the theory. For instance, it is possible to calculate scattering amplitudes in the O(N) model, which are closely related to observables, such as cross-sections. It turns out that the Euclidean momentum s-wave scattering amplitude to the leading order in large N is given by the propagator of the auxiliary field \u03b6 \u2032 introduced in (5), which, for the PT -symmetric theory, becomes [9]\nM(k) = \u2212D(k) = 32\u03c0 2 N 1\n4\u03c02 gR(\u00b5\u0304) \u2212 ln \u00b5\u0304 2e2 m2 + 2 \u221a k2+4m2 k2 atanh \u221a k2 k2+4m2 . (43)\nI will use M(k) as an example of an observable quantity. In weak-coupling perturbation theory, one can expand M(k) for gR \u226a 1 so\nM(k) \u223c 8 N gR(\u00b5\u0304) +O(g2R) . (44)\nFrom a perturbative QFT point of view, one can therefore define an \u201cobservable\u201d or \u201ceffective\u201d coupling as\ngR,e f f (\u00b5\u0304 \u2243 k) \u2261 N 8 M(k) , (45)\nwhere the identification \u00b5\u0304 \u2243 k is expected to hold only approximately. This is a reasonable thing to do as long as the resulting gR,e f f is small enough in order for the observable M to be well-approximated by perturbation theory. However, since M(k) is an observable, it cannot depend on \u00b5\u0304, and indeed, it does not. Using the explicit form of gR(\u00b5\u0304) from (14), one finds\nM(k) = 32\u03c0 2 N 1\n\u2212 ln \u039b 2 LPe 2 m2 + 2 \u221a k2+4m2 k2 atanh \u221a k2 k2+4m2 . (46)\nThis result is fully non-perturbative and can be further simplified by noting that, to this order in the 1/N expansion, the value of m is given by its saddle point value m = m\u0304 = \u221a e\u039bLP, such that\nM(k) = 32\u03c0 2 N 1 \u22121 + 2 \u221a\nk2+4m\u03042 k2 atanh\n\u221a k2\nk2+4m\u03042\n. (47)\nFor sufficiently large Euclidean momenta k \u226b m\u0304 where M(k) becomes small, this leads to\nM(k \u226b m\u0304) = 8 N\n4\u03c02 ln k 2\n\u039b2LPe 2\n. (48)\nComparing this to (45) and (14) informs the refined definition for the effective coupling\ngR,e f f (\u00b5\u0304 = k) \u2261 N 8 M(ke1) . (49)\nI am now in a position to compare the \u201cphysical\u201d definition of the coupling gR,e f f (\u00b5\u0304 = k) to the running coupling of the theory (14), which I carry out in Figure 3. From this figure, it can be seen that the effective coupling gR,e f f (\u00b5\u0304) is positive and finite for all energy scales \u00b5\u0304. Secondly, one finds that the effective coupling gR,e f f (\u00b5\u0304) reaches a finite value in the infrared:\nlim \u00b5\u0304\u21920\ngR,e f f (\u00b5\u0304) = 4\u03c02 . (50)\nIt is trivial to see that these properties of the effective coupling gR,e f f are a direct consequence of Definition (49) in terms of a \u201cphysical\u201d quantity (the scattering amplitude). In particular, gR,e f f does not exhibit any remarkable feature near \u00b5\u0304 = \u039bLP despite the fact that the O(N) model possesses a Landau pole at this scale. This makes sense; since the running coupling itself is not an observable, one can always find some \u201cphysical\u201d definition of a coupling that agrees with perturbation theory whenever the coupling is small and has any set of properties one would want, such as positiveness and finiteness in the IR."

This feature does not change when adding either relevant operators (e.g., mass terms) or irrelevant operators (e.g., sextic\ninteractions) to the theory. I therefore conclude that, for the O(N) model in 3 + 1 dimensions at large N, the Landau pole is a harmless feature of the theory and not a sign that the theory itself is \u2018sick\u2019. Most importantly, using the analytic continuation provided by PT - symmetric field theory, the O(N) model does not need to be treated as a cut-off theory. It is UV complete, and asymptotically free, despite (or perhaps because of ) the negative coupling constant. An important omission in the present study is the question about 1N corrections\u2014 will they destroy the features of the large N limit? While this question is without doubt important, I cannot resist pointing out that (almost) the entirety of holography is built upon the strict large N limit of field theory without systematic discussion of 1N corrections [28]. Yet even without a systematic understanding of 1N terms, holography has indisputably been useful in building our understanding of quantum field theory, so maybe a similar attitude could be extended to the large N limit of the O(N) model."

            "heading": "3. A Landau Pole in QCD?",
            "text": "Let me conclude the discussion by advancing a provocative idea: a Landau pole in quantum chromodynamics. According to lore, QCD does not have a Landau pole, so it seems that it should not be discussed here. But then again, there is no hard evidence against a Landau pole in QCD, so I would argue that the idea should be considered (see Section \u201cOn the Evidence against a Landau Pole in QCD\u201d for more discussion on this point). QCD does have asymptotic freedom, and since the PT -symmetric O(N) model at large N shares this property, one can nevertheless ask how different or similar these theories are. It would seem more appropriate to attempt a comparison to QED rather than QCD, but the experimental determination of the QED fine-structure constant does not extend much beyond the Z-pole mass \u00b5\u0304 = MZ \u2243 91 GeV. Since the QED Landau pole (2) is at vastly higher energy, the resulting QED information (shown in Figure 4) is not particularly illuminating.\nInstead of QED, in Figure 4, I compare the running coupling from QCD to that in the PT -symmetric O(N) model. For the QCD running coupling, I am using the 3-loop perturbative QCD expression resulting from numerically integrating\n\u2202as \u2202 ln \u00b5\u03042 = \u2212\u03b20a2s \u2212 \u03b21a3s \u2212 \u03b22a4s + . . . , (51)\nwhere as = \u03b1s(\u00b5\u0304) 4\u03c0 , \u03b20 = 11 \u2212 2 3 N f , \u03b21 = 102 \u2212 38 3 N f , and \u03b22 = 2857 2 \u2212 5033 18 N f + 325 54 N 2 f , and I am taking N f = 5 [30,31]. As can be seen from Figure 4, the QCD running coupling obtained from perturbation theory becomes very large at small scales \u00b5\u0304. In fact, one finds that the perturbative solution for \u03b1s(\u00b5\u0304) thus obtained diverges for a particular value of \u00b5\u0304 = \u039bMS \u2243 0.3 GeV. This value is consistent with similar values reported by other methods [32], and indeed, the running coupling \u03b1s(\u00b5\u0304) is consistent with calculations from lattice QCD [29] at values as low as \u00b5\u0304 \u2243 5\u039bMS (also shown in Figure 4). In my opinion, Figure 4 indicates a certain qualitative similarity between QCD and the O(N) model. Pushing the similarity further, this would lead to the interpretation that \u03b1s(\u00b5\u0304) actually does diverge at a finite momentum scale \u039bMS and that deep in the infrared, \u03b1s should be analytically continued to negative (or complex) values. It is well-known that QCD becomes confining in the infrared and that physical observables are well-behaved and finite for all momentum scales. In particular, thermodynamic quantities, such as the pressure, are continuous as a function of temperature for QCD, with a broad analytic crossover from the confined to quark\u2013gluon plasma phase around Tc \u2243 170 MeV [33]. Normalizing the pressure by the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann pressure pSB(T) = \u03c0 2T4 90 ( 2(N2c \u2212 1) + 72 NcN f ) with Nc = N f = 3 for QCD and pSB(T) = \u03c0 2T4 N 90 for the O(N) model, a comparison is shown in Figure 5.\nSimilar to the case of the running coupling shown in Figure 4, thermodynamic properties for QCD and the O(N) model shown in Figure 5 seem to have a certain qualitative similarity when expressed in units of \u039bMS. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that there are certain qualitative differences between QCD and the O(N) model, as evident when considering the energy density and speed of sound for both theories shown in Figure 6. The parameters relevant for the equation of state shown in this figure clearly exhibit the second-order phase transition in the O(N) model, which is absent in real-world QCD. This was to be expected; the O(N) model simply is not the same as QCD, despite sharing the property of asymptotic freedom. At best, the O(N) model may serve as a crude approximation of QCD, similar to how N = 4 SYM has been used as a model for QCD [11,12]. Nevertheless, given the successes of applying results from N = 4 SYM to QCD phenomenology [35], it is possible that the O(N) model can serve as a useful phenomenological model, one which possesses a property that N = 4 SYM simply does not have: asymptotic freedom."

            "text": "There are multiple claims in the literature that in QCD, the Landau pole in the running coupling is cured by non-perturbative effects; see, e.g., Refs. [36\u201338]. While some of these claims do not seem to withstand rigorous scrutiny [39], others are based on careful studies of non-perturbative results in QCD, e.g., in Refs. [40,41]. As a representative example, let me consider the observation that certain quantities such as the gluon polarization tensor appear to \u201cfreeze\u201d in the infrared for QCD [36]. This is analogous to the behavior of the scattering amplitude discussed for the O(N) model in Section 2.3. As in (49), the authors of Ref. [36] define an \u201ceffective\u201d running coupling \u03b1s,e f f (\u00b5\u0304) for QCD and show that it is well-behaved and finite even in the zero momentum limit \u00b5\u0304 \u2192 0. From the O(N) model example discussed in Section 2.3, it is clear that the approach taken in Ref. [36] is perfectly reasonable and useful as a practical definition for \u03b1s. However, from the O(N) model discussion, it should also be clear that the observed infrared \u201cfreezing\u201d of the coupling is entirely unrelated to the absence of a Landau pole. In fact, the O(N) model example shows that infrared freezing for an effective running coupling can occur in a theory with a Landau pole. To reiterate the point made in Section 2.3, the QCD running coupling is not an observable, so it is always possible to find some \u201cphysical\u201d definition for \u03b1s that agrees with perturbative QCD in the UV and has any set of properties in the infrared. While certain authors attribute great importance to the apparent \u201cinfrared fixed-point\u201d property based on the IR freezing of some suitably defined \u03b1s,e f f , I personally do not believe that it helps in our understanding of QCD. Of course, it is important to state that the similarities between the O(N) model, which possesses a Landau pole, and QCD do not constitute evidence for the presence of a Landau pole in QCD. It could simply be that observables in a theory with a \u201cbenign\u201d Landau pole, such as the O(N) model, are similar to a theory without a Landau pole. To summarize, while there is no guarantee that a Landau pole exists for QCD, I am not aware of any hard evidence against one, either."

            "text": "In this work, I have considered the O(N) model in 3 + 1 dimensions at large N, which has a Landau pole. Using technology borrowed from PT -symmetric field theories, I have extended the theory beyond the Landau pole, and I have found that adding relevant and irrelevant operators does not qualitatively change the behavior of the theory close to the Landau pole. Physical observables in the O(N) model are finite and well-behaved at and close to the Landau pole. I take this to constitute evidence that at least at large N, the Landau pole in the O(N) model is harmless, and the theory does constitute a UV-complete interacting and asymptotically free theory. Moreover, I compared results from the large N O(N) model for the running coupling and the finite temperature pressure to QCD, finding qualitative similarities between these\ntwo theories. Both the O(N) model and QCD are asymptotically free theories, but there is a key difference between these two theories. For QCD, the high-energy regime possesses an intuitive interpretation as a weakly coupled equilibrium quantum field theory with welldefined particle states (quarks and gluons), whereas the infrared limit of QCD is notoriously difficult to formulate as an equilibrium continuum quantum field theory. By contrast, for the O(N) model, it is the low-energy regime that lends itself to an intuitive equilibrium quantum field theory formulation (with the vector and scalar bound state the perturbative degrees of freedom), whereas the high-energy region is difficult to interpret. Coming full circle, while the respective \u201cperturbative\u201d and \u201cnon-perturbative\u201d regimes are different for QCD and the O(N) model, it is curious to note that both theories contain both phases, and that the Landau pole acts as a the phase boundary for the O(N) model. Based on these observations, my interpretation is as follows: Landau poles are common features for quantum field theories in 3 + 1 dimensions, since the O(N) model at large N, QED, and even QCD possess diverging coupling constants at a finite momentum scale \u00b5\u0304 = \u039b. For two of these theories (O(N) model and QCD), we know that nothing \u2018bad\u2019 happens at this scale. Instead, \u00b5\u0304 = \u039b merely marks the scale at which the O(N) model and QCD seem to transition from a low-temperature phase to a high-temperature phase. Perhaps it would be time to critically reassess the current dogma that Landau poles constitute fatal flaws of interacting quantum field theories.\nFunding: This research was funded by the US Department of Energy, DOE award No DE-SC0017905.\nData Availability Statement: Data are contained within the article.\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank Tom DeGrand and Curtis Peterson for bringing the relevant lattice QED studies [6,7] to my attention and W.
