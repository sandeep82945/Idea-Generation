    "abstractText": "In recent years, the adoption of statistical process monitoring (SPM) techniques in healthcare has been successful. For instance, biosurveillance and biosignal monitoring have demonstrated direct benefits. As the latest reviews of the literature show, parametric SPM techniques have been implemented to evaluate the quality-of-service hospitals provide, track medical equipment, monitor safety markers, or assess the improvements made by quality projects. However, as shown in this research, world-trending topics in data science that include data-driven approaches integrated with SPM have not been reviewed. To bridge this gap and shed light on new research, a systematic review of scientific databases and a taxonomic literature analysis were performed. For the scientometric analysis, a set of bibliometric indicators were obtained to portray the performance of each subtopic, such as examining growth kinetics, identifying top authors, journals, countries and affiliations, as well as creating network maps of co-authorship and keyword co-occurrence. Additionally, the taxonomic analysis involved grouping proposals by methodological approach. Each approach was explained and discussed to identify the advantages, limitations, and challenges that researchers and practitioners may encounter. SPM researchers and practitioners require more flexibility in data-driven approaches to account for frequency unbalance, complexity, dimensionality problems, and speed. Those working in data-driven and computer-oriented areas can expand their toolbox by incorporating sequential approaches to enhance the power of their classifiers, assess risk, reduce misspecification, and adopt model-oriented mindsets.

INTRODUCTION Statistical process monitoring (SPM), also known as statistical process control (SPC), encompasses a set of tools designed to assess process stability and enhance capability by reducing variability [1]. The core tools of SPM are control charts, which include a set of sequential approaches for monitoring the occurrence of process shifts, either isolated or sustained, in location, scale, or form, to assist the search and learning through the detection of assignable causes of variation. Control charts typically consist of a monitoring statistic that is evaluated against one or more control limits. These control limits indicate whether the process is assumed\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Diego Bellan .\nto be in control (IC) or potentially out of control (OC). If the charting statistic falls outside the control limits or triggers an OC signal, the search for assignable causes begins to regain control [2].\nTraditional control charts for both univariate andmultivariate processes can be primarily grouped into four classes [3]: Shewhart charts, cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charts, and changepoint detection (CPD) charts. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses, and they can be implemented to assess different characteristics of systems or processes. Another classification of charts can be based on their distributional assumptions, leading to parametric control charts (PCC) and nonparametric control charts (NCC) [4]. PCC includes those charts designed or constructed based on assumed\n56248 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ VOLUME 11, 2023\nprobability distributions, with normality often being the assumed distribution. However, control charts with other probability models exist at their core [1]. When the distribution assumption is not met, the performance of the control chart (i.e., the ability to distinguish whether an event is IC or OC) can no longer be guaranteed. Based on the subdivision of methods by Conover depending on their underlying probability distribution assumption [5], it is considered as distribution-sensitive charts those whose performance heavily depends on fulfilling the distribution assumption. On the other hand, charts that exhibit good performance in their test statistic, even when the distribution assumption is not met, are considered distribution-robust charts. Furthermore, anNCC, or distribution-free control chart, maintains the same performance regardless of the true distribution of the data [4]. While some authors differentiate between nonparametric and distribution-free concepts, as suggested by Chakraborti and Graham [4] and Conover [5], we will use both terms interchangeably.\nInitially developed for industrial applications, SPM control charts are now being applied in various fields, including the economy and healthcare. In healthcare, a collection of control charts for univariate and multivariate processes has been used for hospital management purposes and the assessment of quality improvement projects [2], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Table 1 provides an overview of common applications and control charts used in healthcare, as depicted in recent literature reviews. It is worth noting that most of the charts in Table 1 are parametric, which raises concerns regarding the assumption of data distribution. It is well-documented in the literature that real-world problems rarely conform to a specific probability distribution, and in many cases, the distribution is unknown. Consequently, misspecification of the parametric distribution can result in information loss and produce misleading or deceptive signals [4], [10], [11]. Furthermore, parametric control charts restrict monitoring to processes that follow the assumed probability distribution, leaving unattended areas in healthcare, such as biosurveillance and patient monitoring applications [2], [6]. To address these challenges and expand on recent reviews [7], [8], [9],\nwhich predominantly focused on PCC for hospital management and quality improvement assessment, the use of other monitoring schemes in SPM literature is suggested. One such approach is the utilization of nonparametric control charts (NCC), which do not rely on the assumption of a specific probability distribution and generalize the monitoring capabilities of the chart regardless of the true distribution of the data. Additionally, combining SPM with data-driven (DD) methods, such as popular machine learning models, can further enhance monitoring capabilities. By incorporating DD methods alongside control charts, a wider range of processes can be effectively monitored, surpassing the limitations of traditional SPM charts alone (See Section IV). To the best of our knowledge, an extensive search of scientific literature in Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) revealed no existing review of nonparametric and DD approaches combined with SPM charts. As a result, there is a possibility that other healthcare areas, not covered in recent reviews, as well as important trends in SPM,may have gone unnoticed. To fill this gap and shed light on this emerging trend, this paper aims to search and synthesize current efforts in healthcare using nonparametric and DD approaches with SPM charts to create novel and synergistic monitoring schemes. This is achieved through a scientometric analysis of the retrieved papers and the classification of leading healthcare applications. By examining the scientific literature, we aim to identify and consolidate the existing knowledge in this field, thereby providing valuable insights into the application of nonparametric and DD approaches with SPM charts in healthcare.\nThis study aims to answer the following research questions through scientometric analysis and the results obtained from the classification of the retrieved papers:\n\u2022 What are the current efforts, trends, and applications in healthcare where DD and nonparametric monitoring schemes are being used? \u2022 Which existing research networks could scientists collaborate with to develop new ideas and methods to fill the gaps in healthcare monitoring using DD and nonparametric schemes?\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56249\n\u2022 What are the potential gaps in current research that future studies could fill, thereby supporting future advancements in the field?\nThis review can be considered as an intersection between SPM, which has a tradition of model-driven approaches rooted in probability and statistics, and DD methods, which involve practical algorithmic assessment of data for various healthcare monitoring purposes. Readers from both areas might find value in the descriptions and discussions of the different methods that complement each other and allow for an expansion of the paradigm set. Control charts are powerful tools for monitoring systems, offering low computational costs. However, they have limitations in terms of data, structure, and frequency. In contrast, DD approaches might be perceived as computationally expensive, but they have the potential to enable or enhance the monitoring capabilities of control charts, thereby broadening the current scope of SPM. Simultaneously, SPM methods contribute as a sequential analysis framework that increases the power to detect changes when combined with DD techniques.\nThe remainder of the paper is presented as follows. Section II presents the methodology followed for paper retrieval. The summary results of the scientometric analysis are presented in Section III. Section IV explains the purposes of DD methods in SPM. Section V consolidates the literature classification based on healthcare applications. A discussion of the results and the trends for future research are presented in Section VI. Finally, conclusions and final remarks are in Section VII.\nII. METHODOLOGY This review aims to retrieve, classify, and analyze papers that present nonparametric or DD approaches using control charts for monitoring healthcare processes. To achieve this, two major scientific literature databases are consulted to accomplish the primary task of paper retrieval: Scopus and WoS. The search is limited to journal articles and conference papers published in the English language from the year 2000 onwards, ensuring a focus on recent advancements in the field. To construct an effective search query, three blocks of keywords are utilized: 1) SPM and control chart keywords, 2) healthcare keywords, and 3) DD and nonparametric keywords. The final version of the search query, divided by blocks, is presented in Table 2. The query syntaxes appropriate for Scopus and WoS are provided in Appendices VIII-A and VIII-B, respectively. After retrieving the documents from both databases, a deduplication process was conducted, followed by manual validation to remove any unrelated articles. As a result, a total of 78 papers were retrieved. Among these, 15 papers presented NCC, 59 focused onDD approaches, and four both. Within the DD approaches, 51 papers proposed methods that use DD approaches before the monitoring process with a PCC (from now on, referred to as DD-before). Additionally, eight papers implemented DD approaches after the monitoring with a PCC (from now on, referred to as DD-after).\nThese findings are depicted in Fig. 1. Finally, a scientometric analysis and a classification based on the healthcare application were performed.\nA. SCIENTOMETRIC ANALYSIS Scientometrics analyzes a research topic by examining its quantitative features that describe its scientific production and trends [12]. Through the application of statistical methods, we can gather information that helps us understand the current landscape of the research topic. To achieve this, the yearly scientific production, as well as the top authors, journals, affiliations, and countries associated with the topic are identified. Additionally, the disciplines and categories based on the journal classification provided by WoS are retrieved to portray the primary areas of interest within the research topic and examine them across different regions of the world. Alongside, network maps of co-authorship and keyword co-occurrence were developed using the software Gephi.\nThis scientometric analysis aims to identify potential global research clusters to promote collaboration with other researchers and institutions to boost the current state-of-theart of the topic at hand.\nB. CLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS The retrieved papers are classified based on the healthcare application of the study. This classification aids the research trends identification process and is performed on each category individually. The following proposed categories are used:\n1) Patient Monitoring: The process of following up on patients in a longitudinal study to assess their health status for a specific disease or based on a (set of) biomarker(s). 2) Pharmacology Monitoring: Related to the control of industrial processes in the pharmacology industry, focused on producing drugs and medicines. 3) Biosurveillance: Related tomonitoring the dynamics of incidence counts of a specific disease in a geographically bounded space.\n56250 VOLUME 11, 2023\n4) Hospital Management: Encompasses everything related to the management of a hospital (e.g., control of its finances, assessing customer support and experience, and managing internal databases). 5) Surgical Performance: Related to the degree of expertise of surgeons in performing a certain surgery in terms of surgery time, survival rate, or other metrics. 6) Bioassay Monitoring: Related to the monitoring of biological experiments in laboratories whose main purpose is intended for human health. 7) Medical Equipment Monitoring: The assessment of the proper operation of medical equipment.\nThis classification provides an overview of prevalent monitoring schemes in healthcare applications. It aims to identify trends, challenges, limits, and gaps in the current state of research. Furthermore, this information will offer insights into potential future work in the field.\nIII. SCIENTOMETRIC ANALYSIS RESULTS Several quantitativemetrics are obtained to perform the scientometric analysis of the research topic and portray its dynamics. These metrics are frequency summaries of documents\npublished by year, authors, journals, countries, and affiliations, along with a journal classification to extract the main interests on the topic. The first metric is the growth kinetics of publication activity, which illustrates the popularity of the topic. As shown in Fig. 2.a, here is a positive trend in the publication rate of papers, with the most prolific year being 2018, with a total of 11 papers. Although the subsequent years (2019\u20132022) present a decrease in the number of published papers in this domain, we can still observe an overall growing trend. Each bar in Fig. 2.a is segmented based on the approach (i.e., NCC, DD approaches in combination with a PCC, and DD approaches in conjunction with an NCC) proposed in each paper. The most common proposals, based solely on the count of papers published on the topic, are DD approaches. Fig. 2.b is a zoomed-in view of the papers that present a DD approach in combination with control charts, whether parametric or nonparametric, dividing them into two classes: DD-before and DD-after approaches. From Fig. 2.b, it can be observed that DD-before approaches are the most common, exhibiting an increasing trend in literature. This result, as explained in more detail in Section IV, suggests that DD methods are frequently applied before the monitoring to\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56251\npreprocess the data and enable its monitorability using SPM charts. On the other hand, DD-after approaches, although useful, remain less popular in comparison.\nIn the analysis of the most prolific authors, 274 are registered. Peihua Qiu from the University of Florida emerges as the leading author. The top 20 authors, those with more than one publication, are presented in Fig. 3.a. Moving on to journals and conferences, Fig. 3.b showcases the top journals and conferences with more than one paper. Out of 61 journals and eight conferences, only nine journals have published at least two related papers, with the top one being Medical Physics. This journal was ranked in 2021, according to Scimago JR, as Q1 in biophysics, medicine, and radiology, nuclear medicine and imaging, representing a benchmark in healthcare sciences. Figure 3.c displays the top affiliations involved in the research. A total of 130 affiliations are registered, with 101 being universities or academic research centers, 21 being companies (mostly pharmaceutical companies), five being hospitals, and three being governmental organizations (all located in the United States). The University of Florida stands out as a leading affiliation, with seven publications, aligning with the results of the top authors.\nNext, WoS provides a classification of journals bsaed on the topics they cover. This classification comprises 21 disciplines with their corresponding categories (254 categories in total), which describe the scope and interests of each journal. Understanding the classification of a journal helps authors select the most suitable for their work and tailor their manuscripts to match the interests of the journal. Additionally, understanding the distribution of this classification among journals publishing papers on a specific topic helps to illustrate the primary interests of the scientific community regarding the studied subject. Fig. 4 illustrates the disciplines covered by this study and provides a breakdown of the top three ones (clinical medicine (20%), engineering (16%), and computer science (13%)). The combination of these three implies that research on this topic is the result of an interdisciplinary collaboration involving engineers using computer science methods, particularly DD methods, to monitor various topics in healthcare. This finding suggests that the focus of the research community is on monitoring new areas in healthcare that were not previously explored solely using PCC, with the addition of methods coming from other engineering disciplines.\nBased on the geographical location of author affiliations, authors from 34 countries have contributed to this topic. In terms of document count, the United States takes the lead with 33 documents, followed by China with 11 documents, and the United Kingdom with six documents, as depicted in Fig. 5. To further explore the interests of different regions in the world (i.e., North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania) regarding the reviewed topic, the most frequent categories based on the journals\u2019 classification provided by WoS are identified. Generally, the most common categories are \u2018\u2018Statistics and Probability\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Pharmacology and Pharmacy\u2019\u2019. Additionally, categories related\nto computer science, such as \u2018\u2018Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Computer Science, Others\u2019\u2019 (including \u2018\u2018Artificial Intelligence,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Information Systems,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Software Engineering,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Theory and Methods\u2019\u2019 for Africa, and \u2018\u2018Artificial Intelligence,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Interdisciplinary Applications,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Theory and Methods\u2019\u2019 for Oceania) are prominent. It is worth noting that Latin America remains an understudied topic in this field, with only one document from Brazil. These results are also visualized in Fig. 5.\nIn the network maps of co-authorship and keyword co-occurrence, the size of the nodes and text increases with the frequency of co-occurrence, indicating the prominence of certain authors or keywords. The width of the edges corresponds to the number of times two elements have cooccurred. Also, the darkness of the color represents the weight of an edge or node, suggesting the strength or significance of the connection. In the co-authorship map (Fig. 6), mainly individual clusters are observed, with almost one cluster per paper, and a few clusters present connections between them. This indicates that most authors tend to publish only one paper related to the topic and have limited collaboration beyond their existing co-author circle.\nFor the keyword co-occurrencemap, the selected keywords by the authors are used and filtered to identify the most frequently occurring ones. During the filtering process, keywords that appear only once are removed. The map focuses on the edges where words co-occur in the retrieved papers at least twice, and unconnected nodes are eliminated. Fig. 7 displays two clusters. The cluster on the left side presents keywords related to the pharmacology monitoring category. This cluster illustrates the common strategy of using control charts combined with DD methods for monitoring applications in pharmacology. The cluster on the right side, centered around the main keyword \u2018\u2018statistical process control,\u2019\u2019 portrays the most popular applications of SPM in healthcare (e.g., \u2018\u2018disease surveillance,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018online monitoring,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018early detection,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018dynamic screening\u2019\u2019) and common strategies that let the user monitor a healthcare application (e.g., \u2018\u2018data decorrelation,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018unequal sampling intervals,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018nonparametric methods,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018longitudinal data\u2019\u2019).\nIV. DATA-DRIVEN METHODS This section presents a summary and explanation of the DD methods to help understand the approaches proposed by the analyzed documents. DDmethods are combined with control charts for various reasons, but they all converge to improve the monitoring capabilities of SPM charts. The analysis of the papers identified seven purposes for the applications of DD methods. In some cases, DD methods serve more than one purpose (i.e., variable selection, confidence interval computation, and baseline model estimation). Among these purposes, four are used with DD-before, one for DD-after, and two for both DD approaches. The different purposes, listed in order of their frequency in the literature, are as follows: 1) baseline model estimation (40 docs.), 2) response prediction (8 docs.), 3) data classification (5 docs.), 4) feature extraction (4 docs.),\n56252 VOLUME 11, 2023\n5) post-signal diagnosis (4 docs.), 6) confidence interval computation (3 docs.) and 7) variable selection (1 doc.).\nEach purpose is used differently to improve the monitoring process that a control chart alone can achieve. A graphical\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56253\nrepresentation of the purpose of each DD method is depicted in Fig. 8, where the main steps and the flow of the approach are illustrated. The improvements achieved are as follows:\nBaseline model estimation is utilized to model process variables using a mathematical function that includes the principal effect of variables and their interactions as they change from a predefined probability distribution [13]. Additionally, these DDmethods are built to address characteristics commonly found in healthcare applications, such as heterogeneity between subjects, time correlation, and dynamic IC profiles, also known as profile monitoring in the SPM literature [1], [14]. The resulting baseline and coefficients obtained for each variable are monitored using a control chart. Several DD approaches were found to fit the input variables. Some of these are variants of partial least squares (PLS) [15], [16], [17] or kernel smoothing [14], [18], [19] via an optimization algorithm that assigns a coefficient to each variable, allowing the prediction of future samples.\nResponse prediction consists of predicting the response of a fitted model built with a DD method trained from a history of process variables. This response is evaluated against the observed value to estimate the residual at each monitored time. A function of these residuals is then assessed with a control chart [13]. This category fits inside the baselinemodel estimation. However, proposals classified under response prediction cannot be used for profile monitoring since the only relevant output for monitoring is the response itself as a forecast or index that summarizes the effect of one or more input variables. For profile monitoring purposes, not only the\noutput but also the model structure are relevant to monitor the sequential evolution of all variables involved in the studied process, which is not the case for the proposals under this category where the model structure is intractable. Such is the case of black box approaches related to neural networks (NN) [20], [21], [22], [23], decision trees [24], [25], and support vector machines (SVM) [26], [27].\nBefore process monitoring, data classification is used to identify groups or clusters of data with common characteristics that can be used for supervised work. It builds a control chart with the \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 data and tests it with the \u2018\u2018abnormal\u2019\u2019 one. For instance, this approach is used to fit an ensemble model consisting of several classifiers (e.g., random forest, bagging, and AdaBoost) for disease occurrence monitoring [28] or a k-Nearest Neighbor method for a batchto-batch drug monitoring [29]. In addition, data classification can be used after themonitoring process to further classify the OC event under a predefined label established by the user. For instance, in Hassan et al. [30], the OC event is fed to an AdaBoost classifier trained to determine if the shift in the variables signifies a positive or negative diagnosis for a particular disease.\nFeature extraction is employed to obtain monitorable variables from the observed raw signals of a process. It might follow a classification process [31], [32], a geometrical transformation or signal decomposition [33], [34]. One example is extracting features when a heartbeat happens in an electrocardiogram (ECG) by identifying the R-peak using a wavelet function [34]. This method denoises the biosignal by\n56254 VOLUME 11, 2023\nsmoothing it and detecting when the highest peak, which indicates the ventricular contraction of the heart, occurs. A control chart can be constructed using normal beats and tested with abnormal ones with this information.\nAfter an OC signal is triggered during a monitoring process, post-signal diagnosis is usedwith amultivariate control chart to identify the responsible variables. Unlike a univariate process, where the OC event is directly related to the monitored variable, the charting statistic in a multivariate control scheme summarizes the effect of all involved variables in one value. This creates difficulty in detecting which variables are in charge of the shift [35], [36]. Therefore, extra aid is needed. One example is implemented in Loggini et al. [37], where a\ndecision tree is trained to find a set of simple rules for variable selection, performing a binary split of the data that separates subjects into normal (IC) and abnormal (OC), and producing an explainable model, where variables selected are the ones considered to be responsible for the OC events.\nConfidence interval computation enables the computation of the control limits that a control chart will employ to discriminate between IC and OC. It is especially used when the process does not follow a defined probability distribution [13]. The most common DDmethod is re-sampling, whether used to set up a control chart [38] or applied afterward to update limits [39]. Bootstrap, a popular re-sampling technique, takes a sample of size n from the original sample of\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56255\nthe same size, with replacement, and calculates the charting statistic to create an artificial history of events. This estimates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the charting statistic, which is used to set control limits based on the desired error level (also referred to as \u03b1).\nVariable selection weighs variables of a process based on their participation in the observed response. It makes it possible to discard non-significant variables to reduce the set to a smaller number of explanatory variables capable of representing and explaining the process behavior [40]. An example is Erfanian et al. [41], where a subset of variables is selected by applying a backward stepwise logistic for a generalized additive model (GAM). The model starts by fitting all variables and obtaining their corresponding p-values and the associated measure of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Then, the non-significant variables, p > 0.05, are removed, and the model has fitted again. The process is repeated until the number of significant variables generates the smallest AIC. Afterward, multivariate control charts are built to monitor the process with the subset of variables. This step is critical for high-dimensional processes since multivariate control charts can only manage up to a dozen variables [42] before their power is reduced too much.\nV. RESULTS OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS As described in Section II-B, the selected papers are classified into seven categories based on the healthcare application. These categories are listed in descending order according to the number of classified documents, including: 1) patient monitoring (28 papers), 2) pharmacology monitoring (16 papers), 3) biosurveillance (15 papers), 4) hospital management (11 papers), 5) surgical performance (five papers), 6) bioassay monitoring (two papers), and 7) medical equipment monitoring (one paper).\nThe following subsections provide a detailed review of each category, including a list of the specific healthcare applications, the type of control chart used in the approach\n(i.e., DD, NCC, or a combination), the number of variables considered (univariate or multivariate), and the type of DD methods used and their purposes. This will allow researchers and companies to identify and pinpoint trends that can aid in proposing new research topics or changing their focus.\nA. PATIENT MONITORING As shown in Fig. 9.a-c, a variety of control chart methods are proposed for patient monitoring, which is grouped into six general classes: 1) patient safety & survival, 2) disease occurrence monitoring, 3) biomarker monitoring, 4) disease occurrence monitoring, 5) electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, and 6) electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. It is important to clarify that the term \u2018\u2018multivariate\u2019\u2019 does not imply the use of a multivariate control chart. Instead, it means that the analyzed process is multivariate. In certain control charts, the most relevant feature after a principal component analysis (PCA) [43], or the difference between the observed value and the predicted response [20], [21], [22], [44], [45], is controlled.\nThe most common purpose of using a DD-before approach (13 out of 19 documents) is to estimate a baseline model, which allows monitoring of a process by modeling an IC function that encompasses its normal behavior. As cdiscussed later in this paper, this is the case for most categories. Additionally, DD-before methods are used for feature extraction from complex biosignals (e.g., ECG and EEG) as demonstrated in [33] and [34]. On the other hand, DD-after approaches are utilized for tasks such as data classification, post-signal diagnosis, and confidence interval computation. The complete summary of the documents classified under this category is presented in Table 3.\nTwo trends are spotted in the documents that employ a DDbefore approach. In both trends, the DD method estimates a baseline model, which enables the monitoring of the healthcare process using a univariate control chart. The distinction between the two trends lies in the charting statistics calculated from the baseline. In the first group of papers [20], [21], [22], [44], [45], [46], and [47], the residuals are computed by taking the difference between the baseline model prediction and the observed online value. These residuals are then accumulated using a univariate memory-based control chart (e.g., EWMA, CUSUM, and a variation of the GLR chart with exponential weights). In the second group of papers, the deviation from the baseline (i.e., a distance) is calculated and monitored using either a k chart [48] or a variation of the Double-EWMA (DEWMA) chart using the sum-square approach in the charting statistic equation [49].\nThis category presents limitations and challenges that may result in incorrect modeling or monitoring of a process:\n\u2022 The correct modeling of the time series behavior depends on the complex characteristics of the data (e.g., dynamic IC distributions and temporal autocorrelation). \u2022 They must be adjusted or retrained to monitor other diseases or patients with different phenotypic and genotypic backgrounds.\n56256 VOLUME 11, 2023\n\u2022 Data scarcity and quality are hard to handle since the available healthcare-related datasets usually have fewer subjects than an industrial dataset.\nFinally, three gaps are identified that could be addressed in future research:\n\u2022 Normality is assumed for the monitored residuals with PCC, but it is not tested, or at least not shown in the text; hence, the performance of the PCC in terms of the false alarm rate could be compromised. \u2022 Timeseries in multivariate processes could be misaligned in the observation times (e.g., hourly, daily,\nweekly, etc.) they present, disabling the monitoring with off-the-shelf designs of SPM charts. \u2022 Comparisons with other DD-based proposals are usually missing, leaving room for doubt as to whether the proposal is better than others already published.\nB. PHARMACOLOGY MONITORING This category presents documents that propose using NCC alone or DD-before in combination with a PCC or an NCC (see Fig. 9.d). Among the papers with DD implementation, 13 out of 14 papers, the most repeated application uses DD\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56257\nmethods to generate a baseline model estimation, usually choosing the PLS method or one of its variants (see Table 4). As depicted in Fig. 9.e, most implementations are multivariate; however, monitoring is often conducted with univariate charts. Similar to the scenarios in Sec. V-A, two approaches are prevalent: monitoring of the most relevant variables [15], [50], [51], [52] or monitoring of their residuals [17].\nPharmacology monitoring encompasses various applications, including freeze-drying, protein PEGylation, hot-melt extrusion, drug crystallization, fluid bed granulation, liquid-liquid extraction, gel manufacturing process, liquid chromatography process, and fermentation process. These applications are closely related to reliable manufacturing, where products, as opposed to patience-to-patience monitoring, are homogeneous in nature, allowing for tighter\n56258 VOLUME 11, 2023\ntolerance limits and high reliability. Consequently, the control charts typically employed are parametric methods with conventional control limits set at\u00b13 standard deviations. The usual way to control these processes follows the idea of batchto-batch monitoring, where observations are collected and plotted on a control chart each time a sample is obtained.\nA trending strategy using the DD-before approach involves dimensionality reduction. In particular, PLS or one of its variants is used to monitor selected components. An example of monitoring scores derived from the PLS model is the use of Hotelling\u2019s T 2 chart in combination with a control chart for monitoring the Squared Prediction Error (SPE). Common choices for control charts in this context include the Q chart [15], [16], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], X-bar charts [51] and X-charts [15], [17], [50], [52], [59].\nThe limits and challenges identified for this category align with traditional limits and challenges found in SPM literature, for instance:\n\u2022 Batch production reduces the monitoring horizon to a finite size, where calibration for a finite horizon production can reduce error and increase detection power. \u2022 The accurate modeling of complex characteristics of time-series data, such as stationarity, outliers, and temporal autocorrelation, is often overlooked. \u2022 The curse of high dimensionality, arising from a large number of samples and variables, is prevalent in this industrial context due to the high volume of products and the abundance of data-collecting sensors. The following gaps are identified: \u2022 The usual monitoring scheme used is PCC, but the probability distribution of the data is not tested; hence, the use of NCC or other DD-based charts could improve the monitoring performance in these applications. \u2022 While using \u00b13 standard deviations as control limits for SPM charts is considered the gold standard, it may be\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56259\nTABLE 4. Pharmacology Monitoring documents overview.\nbeneficial to consider tailor-made control limits that are more appropriate for specific situations. \u2022 Temporal autocorrelation is typically disregarded in these applications; hence, the use of data decorrelation techniques could be explored. \u2022 The use of a hybrid variable selection strategy that combines dimensionality reduction algorithms with experts\u2019 opinions has the potential to enhance the monitoring performance of SPM charts. \u2022 The use of finite horizon modeling instead of assuming an infinite production for pharmacology monitoring applications could be more adequate. \u2022 The comparison with other proposals could help researchers identify the best monitoring approaches in this category.\nC. BIOSURVEILLANCE Papers in this category can be divided into three groups based on the type of monitoring: 1) implementing the DD-before approach combined with a PCC, 2) monitoring with an NCC, and 3) monitoring with a combination of DD-before and an NCC (Fig. 9.f). When selecting a DDmethod, baseline model estimation tops the list of use cases.\nAs seen in Fig. 9.g), the applications in this category encompass bothmultivariate and univariate scenarios. Inmultivariate processes, monitoring is typically conducted using\na univariate control chart by considering either the residuals [14], [19] or the resulting distance between the observed value and the model constructed using the DD method [38].\nBased on their application, biosurveillance can be further categorized, as seen in Fig. 9.h, into incidence rate monitoring & outbreak detection, survival analysis, and disease occurrence monitoring. Analyzing Table 5 reveals that, for all univariate processes within the incidence rate monitoring & outbreak detection group, only the temporal effect (i.e., samples at different time points) is taken into account for monitoring, while the spatial effect (i.e., samples at different geographical locations) is neglected.\nWhen considering the method, two main trends are identified. First, whenever there is a DD-before approach, the DD method is used, except in two cases, for baseline model estimation. The specific DDmethod used varies, but the most common technique is kernel smoothing in combination with an algorithm to address temporal decorrelation (e.g., the AR model, Cholesky decomposition, and ARIMA model) along with a univariate memory-based control chart (e.g., EWMA and CUSUM) [14], [19], [60]. Secondly, the standardized sequential rank statistic is the most commonly implemented nonparametric transformation. It is used for monitoring a disease with a MEWMA Chart [61], [62], where Liu et al. [62] enhance the approach by incorporating anARmodel to decorrelate the data and obtain a baseline model for monitoring.\n56260 VOLUME 11, 2023\nSome limits and challenges are identified: \u2022 Lack of genericity, as the monitoring methods may not be applicable to every disease or geographical location. \u2022 Data quality could improve the model accuracy by focusing on incidence rate and including other clinically relevant variables and biomarkers. \u2022 Accurate modeling of time-series behavior is important, and techniques such as ARIMA or its variants can be used to address model misspecification. The gaps identified for this category are the following: \u2022 The robustness of memory-based PCC could be insufficient, and exploring monitoring approaches with NCC or DD-based charts that do not rely on distributional assumptions could be beneficial. \u2022 The comparison with other proposals could help researchers identify the best monitoring approaches in this category. \u2022 It is important to optimize the hyperparameters of DD methods as a common practice to ensure the best monitoring design for the specific process.\nD. HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT The category of hospital management is broad in terms of the variety of applications, with a lean toward service and transactional operations. Based on the monitoring approach, three main categories can be distinguished: 1) DD-before combined with PCC, 2) NCC, and 3) the DD-after with PCC (see Fig. 9.i). Furthermore, the category includes proposals with different numbers of variables, including univariate, multivariate, and even a combination of both (Fig. 9.j). In cases where a multivariate process is monitored with a univariate chart, the monitoring is typically focused on a response variable from amodel, as demonstrated in the works of Minne et al. [25] and Zini & Carcasci [101], or using a proportion with a p-chart [63].\nThe papers in the hospital management category can be further divided based on their approach: 1) DD-before, focusing on baseline model estimation and response prediction, and 2) DD-after, involving post-signal diagnosis. While the monitoring is performed on a single variable, such as counting cancellations or medical expenses, several potential explanatory variables are examined to explain an observed out-ofcontrol signal. Characteristics of papers under this category are given in Table 6. Due to various applications and approaches, detecting a specific trend in this category is difficult. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the processes and approaches in this category are closely related to SPM research in traditional quality engineering schemes. In several cases, variables monitored are counts, proportions, or raw measures evaluated with a Shewhart-type chart with the usual \u00b13 sigma limits. TMore detailed information on this topic can be found in the reviews by Suman & Prajapati [7], Slyngstad [8], andWolfe et al. [9].\nThe following limits and challenges were identified: \u2022 The curse of high dimensionality is attributed to the varied applications in this category.\n\u2022 The misspecification of the hyperparameters of DD methods increases the likelihood of obtaining a suboptimal model or overfitting. \u2022 Correctly modeling time-series behavior is complicated because of its complex structure (e.g., stationarity, outliers, and temporal autocorrelation).\nThe gaps for this category are as follows:\n\u2022 Normality is assumed for the monitored residuals with PCC but not tested; thus, the reported performance of PCC could be incorrect. \u2022 The probability distribution of the data is not tested, and a parametric distribution is assumed; hence, the use of NCC or other DD-based charts could improve the monitoring performance in these applications. \u2022 The current proposal could benefit from using a data decorrelation technique to alleviate the effect of temporal autocorrelation present in these processes. \u2022 The comparisons with other proposals and hyperparameter optimization are lacking, resulting in the possibility of presenting a non-optimal model.\nE. SURGICAL PERFORMANCE As shown in Fig. 9.k, the papers in this category belong to the monitoring with DD-before and DD-after with PCC, as well as monitoring with an NCC. Approaches with DD-before techniques were applied to estimate a baseline function or to predict a response based on process variables, while also considering subjects\u2019 heterogeneity and the dynamic IC functions of the analyzed variables. DD-after approaches were implemented for post-signal diagnosis to identify the root cause of an OC event.\nBased on the number of variables studied for each document (Fig. 9.l), two papers are classified as univariate and three as multivariate. One paper used a univariate control chart to monitor a multivariate process [26], achieved by monitoring the residuals of a predictionmodel. A summary of characteristics found in this category is presented in Table 7.\nRegarding trend identification, it is not possible to establish a specific trend due to the low total count of current papers (five papers). However, it can be observed that cardiac surgery performance monitoring is the most frequent application [36], [64], [94], [109].\nThe limits and challenges that were spotted are the following:\n\u2022 Data scarcity because the available datasets usually have few entries; data quality since the performance of the models in this category relies on correctly modeling the heterogeneity of subjects. \u2022 Lack of homogeneity between surgeries and surgeons.\nLastly, the gaps for this category are the following:\n\u2022 Similar to previous categories, normality is assumed for the monitored residuals with PCC but not tested, raising concerns about the accuracy of the reported performance of PCC.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56261\nTABLE 5. Biosurveillance documents overview.\nTABLE 6. Hospital Management documents overview.\n\u2022 The lack of comparison with other proposals limits the ability to assess whether the proposed monitoring schemes outperform similar methods already published.\nF. BIOASSAY MONITORING Two documents are classified under this category. Both of them incorporate DD-before techniques, one using a PCC and the other an NCC. The purpose of all DD methods is to estimate the baseline model, allowing the creation of a monitorable function or response, even under online conditions.\nFurthermore, both documents deal with multivariate processes. A multivariate control chart is used in [65] and [66] to monitor the process after estimating the baseline. Due to the limited number of papers in this category, it is not possible to identify a specific trend. Nevertheless, more applications in this field could bemonitored using theDDmethod to estimate the baseline, followed by a multivariate control chart. These results are summarized in Table 8.\nThe observed limits and challenges in this category are the following:\n56262 VOLUME 11, 2023\nTABLE 8. Bioassay Monitoring documents overview.\nTABLE 9. Medical Equipment Monitoring documents overview.\n\u2022 The correct modeling of time-series behavior is due to the complex characteristics of the data, such as stationarity, outliers, and temporal autocorrelation. \u2022 Time-series alignment regarding the unequal observation times between samples violates the assumptions made by the control charts.\nUltimately, the gaps for this category are the same as the ones in the surgical performance category:\n\u2022 The normally distributed residuals assumption is not tested. \u2022 There is no comparison with other proposals.\nG. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT MONITORING Only one document [31], summarized in Table 9, monitors a univariate process with a DD-before approach combined with a PCC, where the DD method is employed for feature extraction. In this approach, the variable monitored was the proportion of false alarms presented by a ventilator with a p-chart.\nPrecisely for [31], the perceived limits and challenges are:\n\u2022 The proposed method is unsuitable for online monitoring due to the variability of scenarios and a lack of generality. \u2022 An extra sensor system is required to assess the status of an alarm, whether genuine or false.\nThe gaps for this paper are the following:\n\u2022 The distribution assumption is not tested; thus, monitoring with NCC or DD-based charts that avoid this assumption could be explored. \u2022 The implementation of data decorrelation techniques could improve the performance of the proposed method.\n\u2022 The comparison of this proposal with other methods is lacking; hence, the proposal could be outperformed by others already published for similar processes.\nFinally, even though there is only one paper in this category, it is important to include it as it represents a significant area in the healthcare field where researchers and experts can propose more applications and approaches.\nH. CLASSIFICATION SUMMARY The present summary primarily focuses on the impact of incorporating a DD method into the monitoring process. As shown in Fig. 1, it is evident that the most common approach is to include a DD method, whether before or after the chart, whereas the use of anNCC alone is still an emerging area in healthcare. Thus, NCC approaches are not considered in this summary, and future work using these charts is suggested.\nIn Table 10, three aspects are described for each category: 1) main advantages, 2) limits and challenges, and 3) gaps. These aspects are obtained from the inherent characteristics of each category application and the purpose for which a DD method is applied.\n\u2018\u2018Main advantages\u2019\u2019 show how a DD method enables the monitoring of a process or how the DD method improves it. \u2018\u2018Limits & challenges\u2019\u2019 describe how capable approaches are and to what extent they can manage the nature of the data, and \u2018\u2018gaps\u2019\u2019 present some aspects that ought to be considered to demonstrate the correct functioning of the proposed approach.\nMoreover, by comparing Table 10 with the summary of previous reviews on the topic in Table 1, it can be noticed the positive impact on healthcare monitoring that the use of DD methods combined with a control chart has. This impact\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56263\ncan be observed through various healthcare applications that have been made monitorable, as well as in the monitoring of multivariate processes.\nVI. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS: HEALTHCARE OVERVIEW According to our findings in this review, traditional PCC and NCC are limited when dealing with a large number of unstructured flows or random variables. The modeling capabilities of DD methods greatly assist the sequential analysis of a monitoring technique before or after the monitoring.\nWhen applied before, a structure is created into a statistic or profile to be assessed. When applied after the monitoring, a root cause analysis facilitates a post-signal diagnosis not limited to the in-control structure of monitored variables (see Section IV for a further explanation of DD methods\u2019 purposes). Additionally, as demonstrated in a significant number of proposals, PCC and NCC charts can be used to address scores generated by DD methods. The sequential analysis scheme provided by PCC and NCC boosts the sensitivity of scores, metrics, and responses obtained by DD methods.\n56264 VOLUME 11, 2023\nAs reinforced in this section, these techniques complement each other positively. However, not only advantages are summarized (see Section VI-A), but limits & challenges (see Section VI-B), and gaps (see Section VI-C) identified in the literature are also discussed, which should be considered for future research and practical applications in healthcare.\nAsmentioned earlier, themonitoringwithNCC alone is not extensively discussed due to a lack of information to establish trends among the retrieved papers on the grounds of being an emerging area for healthcare applications. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that this review is delimited by the trends appearing in healthcare literature. We acknowledge that there are other trends involving DD and nonparametric approaches in SPM (e.g., zero-inflated methods, fuzzy logic methods, neutrosophic methods, and repetitive sampling methods, among others). However, not all of these trends are discussed in this review as they have not been part of the healthcare literature.\nA. ADVANTAGES OF USING DATA-DRIVEN METHODS COMBINED WITH A CONTROL CHART The introduction of DD methods into the SPM field has enabled the monitoring of new and more complex processes in healthcare. This advancement has been made possible due to the following advantages:\nDesign and develop novel control charts, such as k-charts, derived from support vector data description (SVDD), and deviation charts, using kernel-based methods (e.g., SVM, NN, KDE, clustering algorithms, one-class classifiers, among others) for their formulation [67].\nRecognition of abnormal patterns in the data that are hidden or unknown to the human eye expert using kernelbased methods, specially NN and SVM, among others [67].\nAdequate modeling of highly autocorrelated datasets using kernel-based methods, NN, and SVM, among others, to decrease the false alarm rate of the control chart [67].\nThe ability to perform forecasts and build monitorable residuals of data with unknown distributions using NN or PLS [46], [54], [67]; or with special characteristics, such as autocorrelated data with NN and SVM [67], or survival and censored data with the Cox proportional hazards model [44], [68].\nExtraction and construction of trackable variables coming from complex data structures, such as a biosignal (e.g., ECG or EEG), applying PCA, independent component analysis (ICA), or wavelet transformation combined with NN or SVM methods [22], [33], [34], [48].\nSelection of a subgroup of variables capable of capturing most of the variability of the process to deal with the curse of high dimensionality using NN, PLS, and decision trees or their ensembles [40], [46], [67].\nFormulation of explainable models to gain insight into the process behavior by applying decision trees or their ensembles [40], [67] for post-signal diagnosis, outperforming traditional decomposition methods [35], [69] that\nestablish the participation of each variable in the statistic plotted outside the control limits."

            "text": "DD methods grant advantages to the monitoring process but also present limitations and challenges where work and research are still needed. Some of these are listed below:\nNon-stationary processes: It is important to assess the stationarity of the process to model it correctly; otherwise, the abnormal patterns of the non-stationary component of the process could be missed, and the rate of false alarms in the resulting chart could be larger than expected [67], [70]. Healthcare examples are in disease outbreak detection studies [14], [19], where the disease has a seasonal component and where the IC distributions of the biomarkers in longitudinal studies of patients change through time [44], [71]. By this point, a proposal on how to model and manage the non-stationary component of the process prior to and during the monitoring is still needed. Another challenge, which is especially important when performing a post-signal diagnosis, is the change in the stationarity of the process when it becomes OC. In other words, the process can transit from a stationary behavior when it is IC to a non-stationary onewhen it is OC, meaning that the assumptions for the IC distribution no longer hold for the OC events. This is especially relevant when addressing a post-signal diagnosis.\nHigh-reliability processes: A limitation arises when datasets do not have enough OC data to train most DD methods offline [67], [70]. There are some proposed strategies, such as one-class classifiers [73], [74], or artificial contrasts [75], but more work is needed.\nHigh-dimensional processes: DD methods can perform feature selection for dimensionality reduction; however, certain questions about this feature selection still need to be answered [67], [76]. For example, what features are appropriate for a big data monitoring problem considering the data structure (e.g., continuous, discrete, or categorical)? What is the acceptable number of variables needed to avoid overfitting or considerable loss of information?\nOptimization or misspecification of hyperparameters: A surprising issue encountered in DD-based control chart proposals is that, in many cases, a hyperparameter optimization step is not provided, and there is no evidence of the existence of this step at all [67]. It is common to see \u2018\u2018the popular\u2019\u2019 hyperparameters used for the DD methods in the literature, leading to a misspecification problemwhere the results might be misleading.\nUnequally spaced observation times: Control charts are intended to monitor equally spaced observation times. However, a common feature of healthcare data, particularly in longitudinal studies, is patient inconsistency in attending follow-up appointments on time. Therefore, modifications to these charts are needed to accommodate the observations adequately. Examples are given with an EWMA chart in\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56265\nYou & Qiu [44], and a DEWMA chart in Ashraf et al [71], along with the suggestion of not using ARL (Average Run Length) metrics to measure chart performance for unequally spaced observations, and instead use other metrics such as the average time to signal (ATS) [44], [47], [72]. Nevertheless, modifications for other SPM charts have not been proposed.\nData quality and scarcity: One main difference between industrial processes and healthcare applications is the quantity of available data. Typically, data acquisition involves high costs, time, and effort in healthcare applications, resulting in poor-quality data that does not accurately represent the process or is insufficient to train a DDmethod adequately [6]. Moreover, there are several real-world problems where the occurrence of a disease is so rare, such as the ones listed in the NORD Rare Disease Database,1 that modeling it with a DD method could not be done [76].\nMonitoring image data: It is still a big challenge due to the high correlation between the variables and the high dimensionality of the process [67]. Usually, these problems involve millions of variables (i.e., one variable per pixel), whereas multivariate control charts can deal with up to a dozen [42]. Therefore, there is still a chance to develop creative and intelligent approaches using SPM for healthcare applications in the imaging field (e.g., MRIs, X-rays, and CT scans), such as the design of charts capable of monitoring big data.\nC. GAPS IN USING DATA-DRIVEN METHODS COMBINED WITH A CONTROL CHART Whether in an industrial or healthcare context, a mistake remains a mistake. However, while in the industry, an error could represent an economic loss, in healthcare, it couldmean an impaired quality of life for a patient or several deaths, depending on the specific application. For that reason, it is crucial to be aware of the current gaps that DD methods present in the monitoring of healthcare processes, which are presented below:\nImproper control chart selection and design. A relevant aspect that must be considered for the monitoring of any process is the selection of a certain control chart and its characteristics, such as the size of the subgroups, the desired control limits based on a performance metric (commonly the desiredARL value), and the size of the shift to be detected [1], [4]. It is important to know the process components and behavior to be monitored to select the best control chart or a set of control charts to compare with. Also, it is important to identify deceiving trends in certain types of control charts recalled in the SPM literature [77], [78], [79], [80], [81] to avoid their use. If these recommendations are not followed, the number of false alarms or undetected signals could increase significantly. This issue is crucial when even an undetected OC event could mean the death of a patient in a patient monitoring case or the death of several people in a biosurveillance context.\n1https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/\nDeletion of missing data in a monitoring scheme. Another challenging task is collecting all the desired measurements (i.e., variables) from the patients, leading to the issue of missing data. Whether a patient lost an appointment, a nurse or physician performed a test incorrectly, or the physician did not recommend a certain test, it could lead to faulty readings and missing data [82]. One common practice in machine learning and statistical communities is to disregard these subjects [82]. Still, this could be a difficult, if not impossible, task for the medical community due to the usual small size of healthcare databases. In addition, healthcare data, especially data from patients\u2019 physical conditions, has heterogeneity characteristics [83] that several industrial processes lack. Every patient is unique, and despite presenting distinct measurements for a specific variable, they can be healthy (or IC) depending on the context of the patient and the studied problem, which means omitting a patient due to missing data may result in information loss, whereas imputing data may mask an OC event. Common advice is to estimate the missing data and declare the assumptions made with the data. Nevertheless, this question remains unanswered: \u2018\u2018What is the correct way to proceed with missing data?\u2019\u2019\nDimensionality reduction, specifically in the Patient Monitoring case. A common practice in dealing with high-dimensional processes is to apply a dimensionality reduction technique. In this case, the major concern lies when the user is also interested in detecting OC events and knowing why. For instance, suppose it is only about discerning between IC and OC events. Then, the only risk is to not select a variable with the potential to detect a certain OC event, which in theory, the probability of information loss is minimal. However, the rejection of a less important variable or a redundant one due to the level of correlation with another selected variable [76] could lead to the ignoring of an organ or a complete system that is also damaged and relevant to the patient\u2019s condition. Another concern is miscommunication and poor collaboration between the medical and statistical fields. For instance, whether it is of interest why an OC event occurs or not, it is evident when the strategy to select variables relies only on the reduction strategy techniques. Their clinical relevance is ignored, meaning that the expert\u2019s opinion (i.e., healthcare professionals) is neglected, which could lead to a partial solution that, in the end, is still not enough to assist a healthcare professional in solving the real health problem.\nMisspecification and performance comparison of DD-based control charts. Misspecification and comparison of the DD-based control chart proposal with other DD-based control charts is another point of miscommunication between the statistical community and the machine learning community when assessing the performance of their proposals, specifically when a combination of a DD method and a control chart is introduced. An important step in proposing a new approach is evaluating different scenarios to challenge it. Usually, the statistical community challenges its control charts by studying several scenarios that could be present (e.g., different numerical examples, shift sizes, and subgroup\n56266 VOLUME 11, 2023\nsizes). Still, they do not report how are they challenging the DD methods they include in their proposals. For instance, a common practice in the machine learning community, analogous to the control chart challenge, is the optimization of the hyperparameters of the proposed DD method and comparing its DDmethod to others. However, in several retrieved articles in this review, the hyperparameters used were the \u2018\u2018popular\u2019\u2019 ones. There were no comparisons between their DD-based control charts with other DD-based control chart proposals, but only with control charts alone. Therefore, the resulting model could be misspecified, resulting in non-optimal implementations.\nData assumptions. Other aspects to be concerned with are relying on data assumptions, for instance: 1) Independent observations with no autocorrelation [40], [67]; 2) Independent and identically distributed data (i.i.d.) [40]; 3) Equally spaced observations [44]; 4) Time series modeling based on the ARIMA or its variant assumptions [110]; 5) Quality of the data, meaning the representativeness of the process with the available data [6]; and 6) Leap of faith on the usual DD method hyperparameters [67].\nVII. CONCLUSION Statistical process monitoring charts have been implemented for various applications in different areas of healthcare. Beyond what has been described in recent review papers, it is possible to find different approaches where control charts are either parametric or nonparametric, or combined with a DD method before or after the monitoring process. According to the scientometric analysis, although the number of proposals is still limited, there is an increasing trend indicated by the growth kinetics, which instills positive growth expectations for the coming years.\nNonparametric charts prevent distribution assumptions, lowering the risk of information loss or misleading results due to an inadequate probability distribution. Data-driven methods have proven helpful for monitoring healthcare applications with unknown distributions and complex characteristics that control charts alone cannot handle. As a result, the application of statistical monitoring schemes has been expanded. In a nutshell, data-driven control charts and nonparametric charts are promising approaches researchers can use to monitor healthcare applications. However, there are still concerns and gaps produced by data-driven methods due to their limitations and the challenges that healthcare data bring to the table. Thus, there is plenty room for new proposals in this promising research area, which can aim to improve the performance of existing approaches, enhance our understanding, and broaden the scope of practical applications.\nA. SUGGESTED FUTURE WORK Based on the suggestions from recent papers and our own experience, we present a list of ideas and guidelines that might lead to future work in this collaboration between DD approaches and SPM methods in healthcare.\nDesign protocols on how to handle and monitor healthcare data: Healthcare data has several characteristics that differ from those in the industry. Thus, it is necessary to design protocols and guidelines on how to proceed and handle healthcare data. These protocols should provide guidance on various aspects, such as addressing data assumptions (e.g., the i.i.d. assumption), handling non-stationary components, selecting appropriate control charts, addressing misspecification of DD-methods\u2019 hyperparameters, and dealing with missing entries in healthcare data, among other considerations. By establishing such protocols, researchers can establish a baseline for studying and addressing these specific characteristics in healthcare data.\nUse of explainable DD methods for post-signal diagnosis purposes: In some applications, such as high-reliability processes, detecting OC events and locating the culprits of a signal is critical. Explainable DD methods or DD-after approaches, such as decision trees and their ensembles, can enhance the understanding of cutoff values and provide improved diagnoses, particularly in the context of patient monitoring.\nNew DD-based control charts to deal with big data: A call for control charts capable of handling the trend of big data has been made. So far, current proposals have focused on applying variable selection techniques or summarizing the variables into their principal components, disregarding other variables with possible clinical relevance. To address this gap, new control chart proposals, either standalone or combined with DD methods, are required. These proposals could expand the range of healthcare applications to include those involving big data, such as imaging data and pharmacology monitoring processes. Furthermore, they could enhance existing applications by incorporating additional variables with clinical relevance.\nDevelop more models to evaluate the performance of the proposed DD-based control charts: To thoroughly evaluate the performance of proposed DD-based control charts, it is essential to develop robust models that assess their data assumptions and determine the optimal configuration of DD method hyperparameters. In addition to comparing the proposed DD-based charts with similar approaches, these models should cover a wide range of scenarios that may be encountered in future data. Simulations can be used to test the charts under various conditions. For example, You & Qiu [44], tested their proposed method using three different longitudinal setups in the context of patient monitoring. These setups considered within-subject data correlation, temporal path randomness, and non-Gaussian distributions using a combination of Gamma, Poisson, and standard normal probability distributions. While this example can serve as a standard for patient monitoring applications, it is important to address other healthcare fields that have not received adequate attention.\nModify SPM charts\u2019 design to deal with unequally spaced observation times: As highlighted in [44] and [71], current designs of SPM charts are not adequate to\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56267\nmonitor unequally spaced observations. Although modifications have been proposed for the design of EWMA [44] and DEWMA [71] charts, adjustments for other SPM charts are still lacking.\nAvoid distribution assumptions by using NCC: As shown in Fig. 1 and 2, the increased popularity of combining DD methods with PCC for monitoring healthcare applications is evident. However, this approach still relies on distribution assumptions. In contrast, combining DD methods with an NCC is rare. Then, to facilitate the use of a solution in practical scenarios, new proposals could exploit the combination of the latter and explore if it can improve monitoring accuracy.\nCollect new databases: Due to ethical conflicts, costs, and time, one difficult and vital task in developing a healthcare method is the collection of new databases. Adapting an approach designed for a particular application is not straightforward for other applications. To effectively test current approaches and develop new ones, it is necessary to gather a diverse range of databases encompassing various diseases, patients from different geographical locations, surgeries, and bioassays. Furthermore, it is essential tomake these databases accessible to the entire research community, enabling collaboration and fostering advancements in healthcare monitoring.\nOther ideas in healthcare include the following: \u2022 Finite horizon proposals for drug production: Instead of assuming an infinite production line, exploring the use of finite horizon proposals for monitoring drug production in pharmacology could be beneficial. This is particularly relevant for production lines designed to work in a batch-to-batch fashion, where the process has a defined end. \u2022 Online monitoring in biosurveillance processes: While the performance evaluation of biosurveillance models has been conducted using historical data of diseases or epidemics, there is a lack of demonstration with actual real-time online monitoring. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of biosurveillance models in real-time scenarios. \u2022 Broadening the medical equipment monitoring area: There is a wide range of critical medical equipment items, such as vital signs monitors, hemodialysis machines, ECMOs, and anesthesia machines, that have not been addressed by SPM. This area presents significant potential for future research and development of monitoring approaches.\nTo further enhance the current review, we propose two additional topics for future work:\n1) A comprehensive exploration of risk-adjusted control charts in healthcare to identify proposals that align with the search criteria of being data-driven. This analysis would delve into the application of risk-adjusted control charts within healthcare contexts, specifically focusing on their adherence to data-driven monitoring schemes.\n2) The identification of appropriate performance measures for health data monitoring, based on the general classification of healthcare areas presented in this review, along with their specific applications.
