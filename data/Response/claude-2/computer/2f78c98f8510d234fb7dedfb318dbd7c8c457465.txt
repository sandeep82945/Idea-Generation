 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct user studies to evaluate the proposed framework on real-world complex manipulation tasks like pouring. This can provide insights into the effectiveness and limitations of the approach.

2. Explore alternate observation models to map the discrepancy between current progress and desired goal to human actions. This can potentially improve the goal inference accuracy. 

3. Investigate more sophisticated proposal distributions for importance sampling to better approximate the posterior over goals. Adaptive proposals may improve sample efficiency.

4. Extend the framework to collaborative tasks between multiple humans and robots. This involves handling diverse human inputs and coordinating behaviors.

5. Apply the framework to other interactive tasks like assembly, surface wiping, etc. This tests the generalizability and identifies any domain-specific adaptations needed.
