 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effects of different storage conditions (e.g. temperature, oxygen levels, duration) on the metabolite profile and bioactivity of digestate from other feedstocks besides swine manure, such as food waste or agricultural residues. 

2. Optimize storage conditions to maximize the retention and accumulation of beneficial metabolites like antioxidants, antimicrobials, and plant growth promoters in digestate. This could enhance its value as an agricultural amendment.  

3. Identify the specific metabolites responsible for the antifungal and antioxidant activities observed in stored digestate using bioassay-guided fractionation. Elucidate their mechanisms of action.

4. Evaluate the impacts of digestate storage conditions on plant growth, crop yield, and disease resistance when applied to soil. Relate effects to shifts in digestate metabolite composition. 

5. Develop methods to extract high-value functional metabolites from digestate, such as indole alkaloids, biotin, and hypotaurine. Assess their potential commercial applications in pharmaceutical, nutritional, or agricultural industries.
