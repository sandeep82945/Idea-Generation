1. **Investigate the effects of different biochar feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions on the molecular properties of biochar and its impact on biogas production.** This could involve studying the relationship between the feedstock composition, pyrolysis temperature, and residence time on the surface area, porosity, functional groups, and other molecular properties of biochar. The results of this research could help to identify the optimal feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions for producing biochar with the desired properties for biogas production.


2. **Explore the mechanisms by which biochar can have negative effects on biogas production.** This could involve studying the interactions between biochar and microorganisms, such as the adsorption of nutrients or the release of inhibitory compounds. The results of this research could help to develop strategies to mitigate the negative effects of biochar and improve biogas production.


3. **Investigate the potential of using biochar in combination with other additives to improve biogas production.** This could involve studying the effects of combining biochar with other materials, such as zeolites, activated carbon, or metal oxides. The results of this research could help to identify synergistic combinations of additives that can enhance biogas production.


4. **Develop new methods for characterizing the molecular properties of biochar.** This could involve developing new analytical techniques or adapting existing techniques to better characterize the surface area, porosity, functional groups, and other molecular properties of biochar. The results of this research could help to improve our understanding of the relationship between the molecular properties of biochar and its impact on biogas production.


5. **Conduct long-term studies to assess the stability and sustainability of biochar in anaerobic digestion systems.** This could involve monitoring the performance of biochar-amended anaerobic digesters over a period of several months or years to assess the long-term effects of biochar on biogas production, microbial community composition, and digestate quality. The results of this research could help to inform the design and operation of biochar-amended anaerobic digestion systems for long-term use.
