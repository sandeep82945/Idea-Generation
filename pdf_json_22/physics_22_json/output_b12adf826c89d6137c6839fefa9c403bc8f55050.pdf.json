    "abstractText": "Optical transition-edge sensors have shown energy resolution for resolving the number of incident photons at the telecommunication wavelength. Higher energy resolution is required for biological imaging and microscope spectroscopy. In this paper, we report on a Au/Ti (10/20 nm) bilayer TES that showed high energy resolution. This was achieved by lowering the critical temperature Tc to 115 mK and the resultant energy resolution was 67 meV full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 0.8 eV. When Tc was lowered to 115 mK, the theoretical resolution would scaled up to 30 meV FWHM, considering that the typical energy resolution of optical TESs is 150 meV and Tc is 300 mK. To investigate the gap between the theoretical expectation (30 meV) and the measured value (67 meV), we measured its complex impedance and current noise. We found excess Johnson noise in the TES and an excess Johnson term M was 1.5 at a bias point where the resistance was 10% of normal resistance. For reference, the TES was compared with a TES showing typical energy resolution (156 meV FWHM). We will discuss what improved the energy resolution and what might have been the limiting factor on it.",

            "text": "Transition-edge sensors can resolve the energy of a single photon by detecting a slight change in temperature caused by absorption of the photon1. The detector design is optimized to detect photons of desired energy, ranging from gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, visible, and near-infrared2 3. We have been developing optical TESs capable of detecting visible and near-infrared photons. An optical TES can resolve the number of photons abosrbed in the detector simultaneously when a monochromatic light source is used. This photon-number resolution is important in fields such as quantum computing4, quantum information5 6 7 and quantum metrology8 9. In these fields, fast detector response is required. The size of optical TESs are set small to obtain sub-\u00b5s responses. A TES has achieved the time constant of 150 ns10. The small size also allows for efficient coupling to an optical fiber. The highest energy resolution was reported to be 105 meV 11 full width at half maximum (FWHM), which is sufficient to identify the number of photons in the telecommunication wavelength bands.\nRecently, new applications of optical TESs have been proposed. One such application\nis the combination of an optical TES and a scanning microscope12 13. In this system, twodimensional color images were obtained by resolving the energy of each photon. When multi-color imaging is performed with photon detectors without the energy resolution, filters are generally required. To obtain color images with such the detectors, monochromatic images taken with filters transmitting light at wavelengths of interest are overlaid. The TES did not necessitate this procedure and provided multi-color images without filters.\nThe TES had a low dark count rate and was able to be used for imaging under weak\nillumination. The TES was sensitive to photons at wavelengths ranging from near-infrared to visible light, and provided visible and near-infrared images in the wide bandwidth. This feature has the potential to open a new window for observation of biological samples. The new microscope system allowed the use of multiple fluorescent dyes for imaging11. The number of available dyes is determined by the energy resolution of a TES. The spacing between adjacent emission peak wavelengths of the dyes must be wider than the wavelength resolution. This system can also be used for microscopic spectroscopy, where the microscope focuses on a fixed point and collects photons over a long period of time to obtain a spectrum. As the energy resolution of a detector becomes higher, a measured spectra can provide more information.\nIn photon-number counting, requirement on the energy resolution is less stringent. A\ndetector must exhibit the energy resolution high enough to avoid overlap between peaks of adjacent photon number states. To reduce an error in the photon number down to 1 %, the peaks must be separated more than 5.2\u03c3 , where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the peaks. For this purpose, the typical energy resolution of optical TESs (150 meV) is sufficient for use of 1550 nm telecommunication band. On the other hand, for biological imaging and microscopic spectroscopy, higher resolution is desired.\nThe energy resolution \u2206EFWHM is expressed in terms of the wavelength resolution\n\u2206\u03bbFWHM = \u03bb 2\u2206EFWHM/hc, where \u03bb is the wavelength of incident photons, h is Planck constant and c is the speed of light. When the energy resolution is 0.1 eV, the wavelength resolution at 550 nm (green) is 24 nm, which may be comparable with spacing between\nadjacent emission peak wavelengths of dyes. To separate the peaks, the energy resolution must be improved.\nThe theoretical energy resolution of a TES is given by\n\u2206EFWHM = 2 \u221a 2ln2 \u221a 4kT 2c C\n\u03b1I\n\u221a\nn(1+2\u03b2I)(1+M2)/2, (1)\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, Tc is the critical temperature, C is the heat capacity,\n\u03b1I = T R \u2202R \u2202T |I is the temperature sensitivity, \u03b2I = IR \u2202R\u2202 I |T is the current sensitivity, R is the resistance of the TES, I is the current flowing through the TES, n = 5 in the electron-phonon limited conductance, and M expresses the excess Johnson noise term . The energy resolution can be improved by lowering Tc, the heat capacity C and \u03b2I, and increasing \u03b1I . At present, there is no established method to control \u03b1I and \u03b2I . To reduce the heat capacity, the size of a TES must be smaller. The size must be comparable or larger than the mode field diameter (MFD) of an optical fiber to obtain the high detection efficiency of photons. MFD of singlemode fibers is typically several \u00b5m, ex., 3.2 \u00b5m at 1550 nm for UHNA-7. When a TES is smaller than MFD, it enhances the coupling loss and deteriorates the detection efficiency14. The size of a TES is typically 8 \u00b5m\u00d7 8 \u00b5m, which is sufficient with MFD. To obtain high energy resolution with maintaining the detection efficiency, we chose to lower Tc. A low-Tc TES has a reduced heat capacity, which is proportional to Tc with a given volume. From Eq.1, the energy resolution is proportional to T 1.5c . The typical Tc and the energy resolution of our TESs are 300 mK and 150 meV, respectively. When this is lowered to 100 mK, the resolution is expected to be 30 meV.\nIn this paper, we will show that the energy resolution reached 67 meV FWHM at 0.8 eV\nby lowering Tc to 115 mK. The energy resolution was significantly enhanced but was did not reach the expected resolution of approximately 30 meV. To investigate the gap between the theoretical expectation and the measured value, the current noise of the detector was measured and compared with the theoretical noise. For TESs designed to detect X-ray photons, the excess Johnson noise is one of the limiting factors15 16 17. Here, we will show that there was the excess Johnson noise in the optical TES, and will discuss if it significantly contributed to deterioration of the energy resolution, and what were the major factors avoiding the energy resolution from reaching below 50 meV.\nWe also tested an optical TES which showed typical energy resolution (156 meV FWHM\nat 1.46 eV), compared the two TESs to discuss their differences and similarities."

The complex\nimpedance is determined by a thermal model of a TES. The simplest model is a single-block model consisting of a TES and the thermal bath, as shown in Fig. 2(a). This model described behavior of optical TESs well18 19. The complex impedance of a single-block TES at an angular frequency \u03c9 can be written by1,20\nZTES(\u03c9) = R(1+\u03b2I)+ RL 1\u2212L 2+\u03b2I 1+ i\u03c9\u03c4I,s , (2)\nwhere L is the constant-current loop gain given by L = RI2\u03b1I/Gtes,bT , Gtes,b is the\nthermal conductance between the TES and the thermal bath, and \u03c4I is a time constant given by \u03c4I,s = \u03c40/(1\u2212L ), where \u03c40 is an intrinsic time constant, C/Gtes,b. The complex impedance was measured by injecting small signals from a network analyzer into a voltage-biased TES on a cold stage at 7 mK. The current flowing through the TES was measured using a SQUID. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the complex impedance of TES1 can be well described by Eq. 2. Figure 4(a) shows the extracted L and \u03b2 .\nOn the other hand, the responses of TES2 apparently deviated from that expected from\nthe single-block model, as shown in Fig. 3(b)(solid lines). Instead, a two-block model (Fig. 2(b)) was adopted for TES2. The two-block model includes an additional thermal. When the thermal conductance between the additional body and the thermal bath is zero, the model represents a hanging model.This model describes a TES with an absorber15 21. When the thermal conductance between the TES and the thermal bath is zero, it represents an intermediate model22. We will show that behavior of TES2 can be explained by the two-block model in Sec.2.3. The complex impedance given by the model is written as22\nZTES(\u03c9) = R(1+\u03b2I)+ RLeff(2+\u03b2I)\n1\u2212Leff /\n[\n1+ i\u03c9\u03c4I \u2212 gtwo\u2212body\n(1\u2212Leff)(1+ i\u03c9\u03c41)\n]\n,(3)\nwhere \u03c41 is the time constant of the additional body, Leff is the effective loop gain and\ngtwo\u2212body is a term as a function of thermal conductance in the system. These parameters can be written as\nLeff = RI 2\u03b1I/(Gtes,1(Ttes)+Gtes,b), (4)\n\u03c4I = Ctes\n(Gtes,1(T0)+Gtes,b)(1\u2212Leff) , (5)\n\u03c41 = C1\nGtes,1(T1)+G1,b , (6)\ngtwo\u2212body = Gtes,1(Ttes)Gtes,1(T1)\n(Gtes,1(Ttes)+Gtes,b)(Gtes,1(T1)+G1,b) , (7)\nwhere C1 and T1 are the heat capacity and the temperature of the additional body,\nrespectively, Gtes,1 is the thermal conductance between the TES and the additional body, and G1,b is the thermal conductance between the additional body and the thermal bath.\nAs shown in Fig. 3(b)(dashed lines), the measured complex impedance of TES2 was\nfitted well with Eq.3. Assuming that gtwo\u2212body and \u03c41 were independent of a bias point, they\nwere 0.326 and 11.4 \u00b5s, respectively, as extracted from the measured complex impedance shown in Fig. 3(b). \u03c41 was similar to \u03c40 (13.9 \u00b5s at 0.5 Rn).\nIn TES2, while most of important parameters can be extracted from the complex\nimpedance, some parameters such as the ratio between Gtes,b and Gtes,1 remain unknown. Therefore, Gtes,b is unknown and \u03b1I cannot be derived. However, C/\u03b1I, which is an important parameter for the energy resolution, can be directly extracted from the complex impedance. In the two-block model, C/\u03b1I can be calculated using Eqs. 4, 5, Leff and \u03c4I. In the singleblock model, from Eq. 1, the energy resolution is proportional to \u221a\nC/\u03b1I, if assuming\nthat the readout noise is zero. This is also the same applies to the two-block model, as shown in Appendix Appendix A. The values of C/\u03b1I extracted from the complex impedance measurements are shown in Tab.1. TES2 showed smaller C/\u03b1I than TES1. This is consistent with the fact that TES2 exhibited better energy resolution. Using Eq. 3, the current sensitivity and the effective loop gain of TES2 were extracted from the complex impedance, as shown in Fig. 4(b)."

            "text": "In this section, we will compare the measured noise with the theoretical noise level to evaluate the excess Johnson noise. The results of noise measurements for TES1 and TES2 are shown in Figs.5 and 6.\nThe theoretical noise requires the thermal conductance between a TES and the heat bath\nas an input parameter. The parameter is used for calculation of the thermal fluctuation noise (TFN)1. The thermal conductance is associated with Joule power dissipation of the a TES. The power dissipation is equal to the power flow to the heat bath and can be written as\nPJ = K(T n \u2212T nbath), (8)\nwhere n is the exponent determined by the nature of the thermal link to the heat bath.\nThe parameter K is associated with the thermal conductance by G = nKT n\u22121. The cool-\ndown mechanism of the TESs can be explored by measuring the Joule power dissipation as a function of the bath temperature. The measured PJ for TES1 and TES2, when they were biased at 0.5 Rn, were fitted with Eq.8 and the resultant exponents were n = 5.07 and 4.95, respectively. This implies that the TESs were cooled down by electron-phonon coupling. The measured thermal conductance of TES1 (Gtes,b) was 9.9\u00d7 10\u221212 W/K. For TES2, which agreed well with the two-block model, the measured value of 6.3\u00d710\u221212 W/K was a function of thermal conductance in the system (Gtes,b, G1,b and Gtes,1).\nIn the following, we will show that the current noise in TES2 was fitted well with the\ntwo-block model. In this model, we can define the effective thermal conductance Geff, which was equal to the thermal conductance extracted from Joule power dissipation. We will show that we can calculate the theoretical current noise without knowing Gtes,b or the exact form of\nGeff.\nIn order to calculate the theoretical current noise, we also need the responsivity of the\nTES to small signals. The responsivity sI(\u03c9) can be associated with the complex impedance ZTES by 22\nsI(\u03c9) =\u2212 1\n(Ztes +Rsh + i\u03c9L)I0 Ztes \u2212R0(1+\u03b2I) R0(2+\u03b2 ) , (9)\nwhere Rsh is the shunt resistance in the bias circuit and 18 m\u2126 in our setup. The Johnson\nnoise is written as\n|I\u03c9 |2J = 4kTTES (1+2\u03b2 )(1+M2)\nR0(2+\u03b2 )\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ztes +R0 Ztes +Rsh + i\u03c9L \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2 . (10)\nThe Johnson noise due to the shunt resistor in the bias circuit is |I\u03c9 |2sh = 4kTshRsh/|Ztes+ RL+ i\u03c9L|2, where Tsh is the temperature of the shunt resistor, L is the SQUID input impedance and was 18 nH in our readout. The contribution of |I\u03c9 |2sh to the total current noise was negligible as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a). It should be noted that the temperature at the shunt resistor are assumed to be same as the bath temperature.\nNext, we consider the TFN current noise of the single-block model. It is written as\n|I\u03c9 |2TFN = 4kT 2TESGtes,bF(Ttes,Tbath) |sI(\u03c9)|2 \u2261 Ptes,b |sI(\u03c9)|2 , (11)\nwhere Ptes,b is the power spectral density of the TFN. F(Ttes,Tbath) depends on\nthe nature of the thermal link. In the radiative limit, it becomes F(Ttes,Tbath) = [\n(Tbath/Ttes) n+1 +1\n]\n/223.\nThe measured current noise in TES1 shown in Fig.5 agreed well with the sum of the\ntheoretical noise and the readout noise. The theoretical noise was calculated using the measured thermal conductivity and parameters extracted from the complex impedance. The theoretical noise was sum of the TFN noise, the Johnson noise including the excess term M, and the shunt resistor Johnson noise. M was calculated at each bias point as shown in Fig. 7.\nThe TFN of the two-block model can be written as22\n|I\u03c9 |2TFN = |sI(\u03c9)|2\n\n  P2tes,b+P 2 tes,1 +\nP2tes,1\n1+\u03c92\u03c421\n\n \n(\nP1,bGtes,1(T1) Ptes,1\n)2\n+G21,b\n(Gtes,1(T1)+G1,b)2 \u22121\n\n \n\n  ,(12)\nwhere Ptes,1 is the TFN between the TES and the additional thermal block, and P1,b is\nthat between the additional block and the the thermal bath.\nAs shown in Fig. 6(b), the measured noise was fitted well to Eq. 12. The\nparameters which can be extracted from the fit are P1 \u2261 P2tes,b + P2tes,1 and P2 \u2261\nP2tes,1\n\n \n(\nP1,bGtes,1(T1)\nPtes,1\n)2\n+G21,b\n(Gtes,1(T1)+G1,b)2 \u22121\n\n  . We found P1/P 2 TFN,0 = 4.12 and P2/P 2 TFN,0 =\u22121.15, where\nPTFN,0 = \u221a 2kT 2Geff((Tbath/T )n+1)+1) is the TFN assuming that TES2 follows the singleblock model and its thermal conductance to the heat bath is Geff. It should be noted that \u03c41 extracted from the complex impedance was used for the fits. To determine Ptes,b, Ptes,1, G1,b, T1 individually, additional experiments may be necessary. Without knowing these values, the measured noise was able to be fitted to Eq. 12, and the excess Johnson noise term was obtained as shown in Fig. 7."

            "text": "In this section, we will discuss possible models that could explain the behavior of the TESs based on detector physics. In complex-impedance measurements, response of TES1 was effectively explained by the single-block model as shown in Fig. 2(a). The more detail model of TES1 is presented by a thin metal film directly deposited on an insulated substrate, as shown in Fig. 8(a)24. The relaxation time of phonons in the TES was thought to be much faster than probe signals for measuring the complex impedance. Therefore, the phonon system can be effectively treated as the heat bath, and the detector response was described well by the singleblock model.\nIn case of TES2, its thermal model became more complicated. From the measured\ncomplex impedance and the current noise, thermodynamic model was determined to be the two-block model. However, the components of the additional block (electrons or photons, etc) remained unknown. Here, we present a possible model that could explain the behavior of TES2.\nConsidering that the time constant of the additional block (\u03c41) was similar to that of the\nTES (\u03c4I) when the loop gain was zero, it is straightforward to assume that the block could be an electron system. When the system is cooled by electron-phonon weak coupling, the time constant is determined by the temperature. Therefore, the temperature must be similar to TTES.\nTo maintain the temperature above the bath temperature, the electron system must be\nheated. In our setup, the only mechanism that could heat the electron system was Joule dissipation. Thus, the additional block should have the resistance R1. To maintain consistency with the two-block model, the current flowing through the block must be negligible and did not affect electro-thermal feedback (ETF) of the TES. This implies that R1 must be much larger than RTES and was connected in parallel with the TES. The model could have the form shown in Fig. 8(b). The large resistance could be created by a partial volume in the TES. The volume should be normal regardless of the voltage applying to the TES. The large resistance may imply that the cross section of the volume was small.\nWe will show that large resistance in parallel with a TES does not affect ETF and the set\nof equations are reduced to that derived by the two-block model. When a TES is in parallel with resistance R1, the electrical differential equation is\nL d\ndt (I + I1) =V \u2212\n(\nRL +\n(\n1 R + 1\nR1\n)\u22121)\n(I + I1), (13)\nwhere I1 are current flowing through R1 and V is the voltage across the bias circuit. Here\nwe assume that R1 is constant.\nThe linearized differential equation is\nL d\ndt (\u2206I +\u2206I1) = \u2206V \u2212 (\u2206I +\u2206I1)RL \u2212\n(\n\u03b1IRI\nTtes \u2206Ttes +(1+\u03b2 )R\u2206I\n)\n. (14)\nwhen R1 >> R, in frequency domain, \u2206I1,\u03c9 = Ztes(\u03c9)\nR1 \u2206I\u03c9 and thus \u2206I1is much smaller\nthan \u2206I. When |\u2206I1|<< |\u2206I|, Eq.14 can be reduced to the equation without the resistance R1. Therefore, the contribution of I1 to electro-thermal feedback is negligible.\nNext, we will show that \u2206I1 does not affect the thermal response of the additional body.\nThe linearized equations regarding to the additional body is\nC1 d\u2206T1\ndt = Gtes,1(Ttes)\u2206Ttes \u2212\n( G1,b(T1)+Gtes,1(T1) ) \u2206T1 +2Vtes\u2206I1, (15)\nwhere Vtes = RI = R1I1 is the voltage across the TES. To show that Vtes\u2206I1 is negligible\nin Eq. 15, one needs to consider the linearized equation regarding to the time derivative of the change in temperature of the TES,\nCtes d\u2206Ttes\ndt =Vtes(2+\u03b2 )\u2206I+\n(\n\u03b1RI2\nTtes \u2212Gtes,1(Ttes)\u2212Gtes,b(Ttes)\n)\n\u2206Ttes+Gtes,1(T1)\u2206T1.(16)\nComparing Eqs. 15 and 16, the terms Gtes,1(Ttes)\u2206Ttes\u2212Gtes,1(T1)\u2206T1 should be the same order of Vtes(2+\u03b2 )\u2206I, which is much larger than V\u2206I1. Thus, the term regarding to \u2206I1 in Eq. 15 is negligible. Therefore, the behavior of a TES in parallel with large resistance can be described by the two-block model which assumes that an additional body is not heated by current flowing through it. The Johnson noise of R1 is also negligible, which is obvious from Eq.10."

            "text": "We examined the measured current noise of the TESs and found that it matched with the sum of the TFN and the Johnson noise with the excess noise term implemented. Now we can readily calculate the expected energy resolution based on the current noise and can compare it to the measured energy resolution. In the small-signal limit, the FWHM energy resolution of a TES is associated with the current noise as follows23,\n\u2206EFWHM = 2 \u221a (2ln2)\n[\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n4\n|I\u03c9 |2total |sI(\u03c9)|2 d f\n]\u22121/2 . (17)\nUsing Eq. 17 and the measured current noise, we calculated the expected energy\nresolution as shown in Tab. 2. The calculated energy resolution in the presence of the excess\nnoise (Ec) was slightly worse than the energy resolution in the absence of the excess noise. Although the excess noise contributed significantly to the current noise, it could be excluded as a major source that limits the energy resolution. Note that the calculated energy resolution took into account the readout noise.\nTo compare these values with the measured energy resolution, we need to consider the\nenergy collection efficiency. It is defined as the ratio of the energy absorbed by a TES to the energy of a photon. The collection efficiency is less than 100 % due to phonon escape from the detector. In a linear detector, the energy deposited on a TES should be removed by electrothermal feedback and is equal to EETF =\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 Vtes(t)\u03b4 I(t)dt. The energy collection efficiency becomes EETF/Ephoton, where Ephoton is the energy of a photon. As shown in Tab. 2, TES2 showed better efficiency than TES1 did.\nIf the current noise is only the source for fluctuations in the measured energy of a photon,\nthe measured energy resolution \u2206Em should agree with the calculated energy resolution obtained by \u2206Ec/\u03b7 . However, as in Tab. 2, \u2206Ec/\u03b7 is significantly smaller than \u2206E. The difference can be written as \u221a\n\u2206E2m \u2212\u2206E2c/\u03b72 \u2261 \u2206Eother. There must be some unexplained degradation in the energy resolution. In TES2 whose energy resolution is less than 100 meV, \u2206Eother had a significant impact on the energy resolution.. Therefore, it is necessary to prioritize the reduction of \u2206Eother to obtain higher energy resolution.. To do this, we need to understand nature of the unexplained sources."

            "text": "From the noise measurements, we have found that the optical TESs have the excess Johnson noise. The effect of the excess noise on the energy resolution of TES2 was relatively small. It was strongly affected by fluctuations caused by unexplained sources.\nIt had been considered that the reduction of the current noise is crucial to improve the\nenergy resolution of an optical TES. Therefore, a TES should have low Tc and \u03b2 , a small heat\ncapacity, high \u03b1I and low excess noise. We have successfully fabricated such a TES.\nThe study of the excess Johnson noise may be important for improvement of the energy\nresolution, though its contribution was small as shown in Tab.2. For TESs designed to detect X-ray photons, the excess Johnson noise is known to be one of the limiting factors. Optical TESs have a different detector design than X-ray TES: They have no membrane or absorber and an order of magnitude smaller in size. Thus, the cause of the excess Johnson noise in optical TES could also be different. Many groups have studied the excess noise in X-ray TES, but few works have been done on the excess noise in optical TESs. This is an issue that needs to be addressed in the future.\nTo obtain higher energy resolution, the source of \u2206Eother should be investigated and be\nreduced. The factors of \u2206Eother could be (1) non-linear response, (2) error in the pulse height estimate of a signal by the optimal filtering method and (3) downconversion phonon noise25.\nWe discussed the energy resolution in the small-signal limit, assuming that the detector\nresponse is linear. If there is non-linearity in a TES, the energy resolution calculated based on the small-signal theory may deviate from the measured resolution.\nIn a linear detector, the pulse height should be proportional to the total energy of photons.\nWhen a linear TES is irradiated with a pulsed laser, the pulse height is proportional to the number of photons simultaneously absorbed there. In reality, as shown in Fig. 9, the measured pulse height was fitted to a quadratic function rather than a linear function. TES2 showed more obvious nonlinear responses than TES1. Note that the pulse height spectra including Fig. 1\nwere calibrated using a quadratic function, from which the energy resolution was obtained.\nIt is questionable whether it is optimal to fit with a quadratic function over the entire\nenergy region. In Fig. 9, the region where TES2 responded linearly was unclear. There was a possibility that the TES responded linearly to small-energy deposition, such as a region from 0 eV to the single-photon peak. The single-photon peak in the pulse-height spectrum was fitted with Gaussian function and the resultant energy resolution was 62 meV. The change in the resolution was 10% from fit with the quadratic function, and implies uncertainty introduced by non-linearity. In the case of TES1, which exhibited better linearity, applying the same procedure to the measured pulse height spectrum resulted in the energy resolution of 150 meV. The change in the resolution was 4% and was smaller.\nThe non-linear responses also linked to optimal analysis of the pulse height. In the\nanalysis, the static noise is assumed. However, a large change in the resistance (or a bias point) invalidate this assumption. This could lead to an error in the pulse height and deteriorate the energy resolution. For future work, to understand responses of a TES in more detail, we will study the nonlinear detector response between the small-signal limit and the large signal region where a TES is saturated.\nTo improve the energy resolution, lowering Tc furthermore could be still an option in\nfields where slow detector response is acceptable. In applications that require the high energy resolution, such as biological imaging and microscopic spectroscopy, the counting rate of incident photons are occasionally low, and slow detector response may be acceptable. For low-Tc TESs, with a given energy of a photon, a change in temperature and thus the resistance will be larger and their responses will be non-linear. Therefore, it is important to have a better understanding of the nonlinearity.\nIn this paper, we have focused on the current noise. Another important source\nof fluctuations in the measured energy is downconversion phonon noise. The noise is independent of the current noise and is originated from fluctuations in the number of phonons escaping into a substrate. The noise could be reduced by forming a TES on membrane to limit escape paths of phonons.\nThis membrane structure was implemented by other group26. Its purpose was to reduce\nenergy loss and to enhance the energy collection efficiency \u03b7 . We have achieved fairly high \u03b7 without membrane. However, non-uniformity in \u03b7 was quite high, i.e., typically \u03b7 was from 50 to 90 %. By adopting the membrane structure, we could improve \u03b7 and the non-uniformity."

            "text": "In conclusion, the energy resolution of an optical TES reached 67 meV by lowering the critical temperature Tc and by achieving a high loop gain. The measurements of complex impedance and current noise show that the behavior of the TES was consistently explained by a two-block model. We calculated the theoretical values of the current noise and compared them with the measured data, and found that there was excess Johnson noise. The excess noise term M was 1.5 at a bias point where the resistance was 10% of normal resistance. Another TES with a typical energy resolution (156 meV) was also tested and showed a similar M. Though\nthe excess Johnson noise contributed to deterioration of the energy resolution, it was not a dominant source of the current noise. We found unexplained fluctuations in the measured energy. The contribution of the unexplained noise to the energy resolution was comparable with that of the current noise.\nFor future work, further lowering Tc could pave the road to achieve the energy resolution\nbelow 50 meV. In parallel, we need to understand and mitigate the unexplained noise. One of possible sources of this noise could be non-linear response of the TESs. In this paper, we assumed that the small signal limit and that TESs responded linearly. The discrepancy between the measured values and the theoretical expectations could be explained by nonlinearity. The non-linearity in detector response will become more obvious as Tc is lower and thus the heat capacity decreases. Understanding non-linearity will become more important in future research."
