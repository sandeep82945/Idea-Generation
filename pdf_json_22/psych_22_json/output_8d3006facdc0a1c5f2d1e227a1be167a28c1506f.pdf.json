    "abstractText": "Service-learning is an educational approach that has been proven to cultivate public conscience by combining the learning objectives of curriculum content with student involvement in community service. The current study explores the various impacts of a service-learning project directed toward psychology students tutoring children with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are taken from the perspective of 114 Kosovar students and 20 parents of children with disabilities involved in the project. The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the challenges that families of children with disabilities already faced. The tutoring sessions had a positive effect on family well-being and children\u2019s academic achievements. The students reported improved attitudes toward children with disabilities and increased self-efficacy and motivation for community engagement. Service-learning is promoted as a teaching method that attends to societal needs, helps students reflect on their experiences and competency, facilitates a better understanding of the consequences of public policy, and contributes to responsible citizens and compassionate professionals. This study adds to the literature by highlighting the substantial results and potential benefits of service-learning and individualized support for children with disabilities and their parents by discussing the implications for practice and future research.",

            "text": "Sustainability concerns not only the physical environment but also equity, social justice, peaceful relationships, and action for change. In other words, it can address and respond to pressing issues through its relation to ethics and personal agency. The COVID19 pandemic has exposed how fragile our systems can be, especially for vulnerable communities. During this time, families with children with disabilities were faced with uncertainty, heightened stress, a lack of services, and non-inclusive online learning (Hyseni Duraku et al., 2020). The current study presents a service-learning project implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and details its impact on both the community and psychology students who participated in it. The paper upholds service-learning as a pedagogy that appears to enable the realization of the principles and values of sustainability. Responding to the greater good (i.e., the needs of local and global communities) is seen as a way to create sustainable societies and communities. Banathy (1991) wrote that we need to manage complexity, cope with ambiguity and uncertainty, and grasp the connectedness and interdependence of systems that we are part of. Thus, he argued, learning needs to be\nPublished by ECSDEV, Via dei Fiori, 34, 00172, Rome, Italy http://ecsdev.org\ndesigned such that it enhances critical thinking and the understanding of the self, the environments we live in, and the situations we experience (Banathy, 1991). The power of education to enable change, deliver a sustainable future in terms of environmental and economic integrity, and bring about a just society for present and future generations has long been emphasized and debated. It was the goal of the United Nations (UN) Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD; UNESCO, 2005; United Nations General Assembly [UNGA], 2002) to integrate the principles, values, and practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education and learning\u2014and thus into society\u2014to encourage behavioral change. Consequently, the UN DESD has taken a holistic and interdisciplinary approach that integrates the concepts of human, social, and economic development (Hopkins, 2008). In this sense, education is considered able to foster respect and responsiveness in the community by enabling an understanding of the wider natural and social environment and our interdependence with one another. More recently, the UN devised 17 goals for its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that included healthy life, well-being, and inclusive and equitable quality education for all (UNGA, 2015). To optimize health, well-being, and education for all, it is necessary to optimize the conditions that enable the active participation of people with disabilities in the public sphere. The areas in which people with disabilities are particularly disadvantaged include education and social life (World Health Organization Europe, 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the perpetual challenges children with disabilities and their families face. Lockdown, social distancing, lack of services, and emergency online learning have contributed to heightened stress levels and serious concerns about lost ground in learning that may contribute to long-term educational and socioeconomic disparities (e.g., Alhuizimi, 2021; Asbury et al., 2021; Hyseni Duraku & Nagavci, 2020; Lund et al., 2020; Manning et al., 2020; Umucu & Lee, 2021)."

            "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was reported in Kosovo that the majority of children with disabilities in the education system did not participate in remote and online learning. Even when some of these children did participate, they did not benefit from this modality of learning (Hyseni Duraku & Nagavci, 2020). This was mostly due to a sudden shift to this learning format and, thus, its inadequate implementation, such as by not ensuring adequate access for the entire target group (Hyseni-Duraku & Nagavci, 2020). Parents took on the role of the teacher, and not all parents had the required time and competency to fulfill this task (ibid, 2020). The In Your Shoes project was an initiative by youngsters to help children with disabilities during this pandemic. It was supported by a group of organizations1 and implemented by the Department of Psychology at the University of Prishtina in collaboration with HANDIKOS2 Kosovo. The initiative was conceptualized and realized as a service-learning project involving tutoring sessions to offer academic and socioemotional support to children with disabilities.\n1 UNICEF Innovations Lab Kosovo, Japanese Embassy in Kosovo, Peer Education Network in Kosovo 2 Association of Paraplegics and Paralyzed Children of Kosovo\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors. Journal Compilation \u00a9 2022 European Center of Sustainable Development.\nSeventy undergraduate students of psychology were selected and trained for engagement as tutors as part of a university-run, semester-long internship program The actors involved in the project conducted the training, and the students gained knowledge and skills on the inclusiveness of children with disabilities in the education system before and during the pandemic, techniques of communication with children with disabilities, methods of compiling individual educational plans, and the technicalities of the project. The trained students began their service-learning by contacting families, establishing collaboration, and discussing their children\u2019s needs. Based on this information, the students compiled working and individual plans and then continued the tutoring sessions. The servicelearning project lasted 2 months, and the students were engaged in the tutoring program for 50 h on average, 30 of which comprised sessions with a child. The students worked in pairs, and each pair had one child. The third-year students were engaged as head tutors, and their primary responsibility was conducting tutoring with the child, whereas first- and second-year students were engaged as support tutors. They observed sessions and conducted the desk research necessary for planning the sessions. Both levels of tutor evaluated each session after it ended and prepared a daily plan for the following session. University professors from the Department of Psychology and one external mentor with expertise in pedagogy and inclusion continuously supervised the students. The children who participated were aged between 5 and 14 years and had autism, hypophrenia, delays in language and communication development, cerebral palsy, and physical and intellectual disabilities. At its core, service-learning concerns academic learning that encourages community action and civic responsibility. In turn, community needs are addressed (Anderson et al., 2001). Down (2010) wrote about the complementation of implementing the UN DESD through service-learning and described service-learning as a pedagogy that is \u201cfocused on real world tasks, is community-oriented, values-centred and has a strong future perspective\u201d (p. 60). Such education involves universities that are socially, environmentally, and economically relevant, respond to the public good, and nurture students as agents of sustainable development. Service-learning also allows for interaction with the other. Many researchers have reported that people may hold biased beliefs toward people with disabilities that are a major barrier to inclusiveness (Armstrong et al., 2016; Carrier, 2007; Koller et al., 2018; Mann et al., 2018). Such attitudes are said to be influenced by different motivations and emotions, such as fear of the unknown and uncertainty about what to expect of people with disabilities and how to behave around them, fear of one\u2019s own vulnerability, the perceived threat to one\u2019s beliefs about a just world, guilt about one\u2019s lack of disability, tragic views toward disability, and general aversion to weakness (Gething, 1984, in Gething & Wheeler, 1992). Nevertheless, another body of research has reported that contact and experience with people with disabilities may improve such attitudes. For example, in their analyses of various types of intervention, including opportunities for contact, information and awareness campaigns, education and training about disability, and legislation providing equal access and opportunities, Fisher and Purcal (2017) concluded that such interventions may be effective for fostering an accepting environment that allows for the active participation of people with disabilities. In addition to an improvement of attitudes, opportunities that allow students to exercise their agency by providing them with the opportunity to develop experience in working\nPublished by ECSDEV, Via dei Fiori, 34, 00172, Rome, Italy http://ecsdev.org\nwith persons with disabilities may improve their efficacy in terms of inclusivity (Leyser et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2015). Service-learning is also reported to reduce stereotypical thinking, develop students\u2019 appreciation for diversity, and encourage civic engagement (e.g., Celio et al., 2011; Jones & Hill, 2001; Lester et al., 2005; Lockeman & Pelco, 2013; Papamarcos, 2005; Yorio & Ye, 2012). Service-learning appears to have gained interest amongst policy-makers, practitioners, and researchers in the United States, and Europe is striving to encourage service-learning through its promotion (e.g., Sotelino-Losada et al., 2021). While it has been consolidated in some countries, service-learning implementation and dissemination varies greatly across regions. In Southeast Europe especially, where Kosovo is located, service-learning is considered under-researched (Aramburuzabala et al., 2019, in Sotelino-Losada et al., 2021). Thus the current study aims to explore the effects of a service-learning project directed toward psychology students tutoring children with disabilities in Kosovo, during the COVID-19 pandemic, formulate a response to the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, and research its potential long-lasting adverse effects. As service-learning is considered transformational for students and the community, the current research reports on both of these groups. Specifically, it aims to measure how engaging with children with disabilities affects students\u2019 attitudes toward this social group, the impact of service-learning on student self-efficacy when working with children with disabilities, and their motivation for future community involvement. In addition, it explores families\u2019 experiences of the service-learning project during the COVID-19 pandemic and shares their continuing needs."

We applied a descriptive phenomenological research approach to explore the challenges faced by children with disabilities and their parents, the impact of tutoring sessions, and the socioemotional support for children with disabilities during this period. We collected data through semistructured interviews conducted via Google Meet with 20 parents of children with disabilities who benefited from the tutoring sessions and socioemotional support. Of the total, 18 were mothers and 10 had regular jobs outside the home. The participants were selected randomly from a list of parents of children who participated in the tutoring sessions. Each interview lasted up to 35 min. The second segment of the research involves 114 undergraduate students from the Department of Psychology at the University of Prishtina. From the overall student sample, 101 (94%) were female, 35 (33%) had previous internship experience working with children with disabilities, and 29 (27%) were reported to have a family member with disability. The students\u2019 data were analyzed from three perspectives: attitudes toward children with disabilities, self-efficacy, and motivation for community engagement. A Google Forms questionnaire based on a standardized scale was circulated by email.3 Further, to substantiate the quantitative findings, a focus group discussion was conducted involving eight randomly selected students who participated in tutoring sessions and provided socioemotional support through the service-learning project.4 The focus group lasted approximately 90 min."

To address whether contact and experience between students and children with disabilities influenced the measures of the study, a general linear model (GLM) for each dependent variable has been derived. Table 1 depicts the descriptive results of all of the measuring instruments used in the study. GLM analysis for each dependent variable revealed some significant group differences. Its analysis of the Interaction with Disabled Persons (IDP) scale revealed significantly higher results, meaning higher discomfort among participants with no previous internship experience and no previous experience with people with disabilities (Table 2). The hours of experience with people with disabilities was also a significant predictor of group differences for student comfort/discomfort.\nFurther, Table 3 depicts the scores of the Self-Perceived Efficacy scale. The finding shows significant group differences depending on both contact and experience with children with disabilities. Participants who have had contact and experience with people with disabilities showed higher scores.

The other associations were weak and not statistically significant.\n3.8 Students\u2019 perspectives of service-learning impact The following section is about the effects of the tutoring sessions and providing socioemotional support on the students who were engaged in the service-learning project during the COVID-19 pandemic. The students\u2019 data were analyzed from three perspectives: attitudes toward children with disabilities, self-efficacy, and motivation for community engagement. In general, the students reported various emotions, including discomfort, privilege, compassion, fear, and uncertainty, on how to behave and what to expect from this servicelearning experience, underpinning their attitudes and interaction with children with disabilities. The students\u2019 expectations, time spent with the children, and their relation with and cooperation of the family tended to influence their attitudes and interactions. The following narratives revealed these perceptions: \u201cI would recommend that every person . . . spends time with people with disabilities, to acknowledge their abilities, to be aware of their challenges, and to discard stereotypes . . . I spent lots of time with the child and created a strong emotional bond, as I saw the challenges these children faced . . . and I somehow felt guilty for my privilege.\u201d (Student, Female #2) Regarding self-efficacy, the students reported that the sessions became easier with time. Before the project, they mentioned feeling confused, stressed, doubtful, less competent, and confident but afraid. Factors influencing students\u2019 self-efficacy included the experience they had gained, collaboration with the child and family, their feedback, knowing one\u2019s own competencies and the child\u2019s abilities, and self-motivation. \u201cExperience plays a role . . . It affected how I felt because I didn\u2019t believe there was much difference in how I approached the child. But because of the experience I gained, my expectations became different, and so did my performance. The first time I had such an experience, I questioned my competency, and these feelings influenced the whole experience.\u201d (Student, Female #2)\nPublished by ECSDEV, Via dei Fiori, 34, 00172, Rome, Italy http://ecsdev.org\nRegarding motivation for community engagement, the students illustrated various instances of motivation. From the findings, the most important motivations were the way they experienced the challenges of children with disabilities, the confidence they gained to support and make a difference in somebody\u2019s life, and, overall, the child\u2019s happiness. \u201cWhen we feel competent, we feel more comfortable with the work we do.\u201d (Student, Female #5) \u201cThe more competent a person feels, the more he or she is motivated to engage in different activities.\u201d (Student, Female #6) \u201cThe more a person sees that their help is producing results, the more they desire to continue doing this work.\u201d (Student, Female #3)"

            "text": "To educate for sustainable development is to educate with the community in mind, and service-learning appears to be one of the best ways to approach such education and development. The current study reports a service-learning project implemented with a twofold intention: (1) to respond to the needs of families with children with disabilities and (2) to enhance student learning and professional development. The study, which provides data collected from both groups, has produced two main findings that we believe contribute to the literature and practice. These are the particular needs of families with children with disabilities that were amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic and the opportunity to respond to the needs of the community and, through it, enhance student learning and improve attitudes toward a social group and community engagement. The current study entails the impact of service-learning across various domains. According to Butin (2005), service-learning can be analyzed, in research and practice, through four distinct lenses: political, technical, cultural, and postmodern. In line with this conceptualization, when considered through a political lens, the current study first shares the voice of a marginalized group, advocating for equitable educational and social opportunities. The results of the study have shown that families with children with disabilities were subject to non-inclusive remote and online learning. They were seriously worried by long-lasting effects of lost educational ground due to the situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic and overwhelmed by homeschooling on top of their other responsibilities. These findings echo those of other studies during COVID-19 period (Hyseni Duraku et al., 2020; Hyseni Duraku & Nagavci, 2020). Amid this overwhelming situation, the parents were very appreciative of the tutoring sessions that the current study investigated, which they considered beneficial for their children and helpful for themselves. They reported that their children were experiencing better moods and empowerment towards life in general and learning in particular. The parents also reported specific academic improvements on their children, such as in math and literacy, confirming the effect that tutoring and individualized support are believed to have (e.g., Elbaum et al., 2000; Nickow et al., 2020). In the context of the situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the parents considered that the tutoring sessions were helpful in avoiding the expansion of an educational gap and that the skills gained would continue to serve their children beyond this pandemic period. Nevertheless, they also conveyed that the education system requires reinforcement in terms of providing support for teachers\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors. Journal Compilation \u00a9 2022 European Center of Sustainable Development.\nand assistance for children with disabilities. In addition to the impact of service-learning on the families, the current study reported on the impact that it had on the students who tutored the children with disabilities. As, many scholars have argued of a relation between being involved in service and gaining a greater critical consciousness and understanding of complex social issues (e.g. Deeley, 2010; Eyler & Giles, 1999; Jones & Abes, 2004; Jones & Hill, 2001), the data from the current study\u2019s focus group continuously showed the students\u2019 increased awareness of the challenges that children with disabilities face. Next, the results from the qualitative as well as quantitative body of data showed that interacting with children with disabilities, witnessing the challenges of the families, and experiencing the positive results of their work, as well as the children\u2019s potential, influenced the students\u2019 positive attitudes toward children with disabilities, increased their self-efficacy, and motivated them for further community and professional engagement. These findings of student development in the sense of increased agency, more inclusive attitudes, perspective transformation, and motivation for civic engagement seem to support the technical, cultural, and postmodern conceptualization of service-learning by Butin (2005), wherein the technical dimension defines service-learning as a pedagogical strategy that focuses on pedagogical effectiveness: \u201cbetter teaching for better learning\u201d (p. 90), whereas the cultural one is focused on the meanings of the practice for the individual and institution as a means of addressing issues such as tolerance, respect for diversity, unity, and engaged citizenship. Lastly, the postmodern conceptualization according to Butin (2005) focuses on \u201chow the service-learning process creates, sustains, and/or disrupts the boundaries and norms by which we make sense of ourselves and the world\u201d (p. 91). Service-learning as a postmodern pedagogy is believed to disrupt the \u201ccommonsensical\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s just the way things are\u201d way of thinking. It involves experiences through which students are \u201cconstantly encountering the dilemmas and ambiguities of living with and through the complexity of how life works\u201d (p. 98). Altogether, the theoretical conceptualization of service-learning and the empirical data from this study seem to support education for sustainable development. Service-learning opens up the world to students, encouraging them to learn beyond the classroom and regularly requiring them to engage with the truths of living individuals, families, and local communities. It requires students to revisit their worldviews, prejudices, and stereotypes about the other and relate theory and reality. Such were the reports of students from the current study, that exercising their agency and engaging with the challenges of families with children with disabilities made them see the whole situation from a different perspective and feel more competent and motivated for community action. For such student experiences that also support sustainable development, the curriculum must be flexible in the sense that it is perceptive to the issues emerging at global and local level but also enriched as students interact with the local community. Instead of being merely a \u201cproduct\u201d served to students, the curriculum becomes an experience feeding realworld knowledge. Students, rather than being passive readers and learners, are active, realworld observers and learners. Furthermore, students can also contribute to designing service-learning programs. Research has shown that when students have voices and ownership of the service-learning experience, in terms of having responsibility and contributing to the planning and decision-making process, they developed self-esteem,\nPublished by ECSDEV, Via dei Fiori, 34, 00172, Rome, Italy http://ecsdev.org\npolitical engagement, and tolerance toward different groups of people (e.g., Morgan & Streb, 2001; Swaminathan, 2005). Experiencing such ownership themselves, they also give value from their ownership to community members. Educational institutions with a high level of sustainability are reported to have integrated service-learning into their curricula, and provide infrastructure and resources to support participation in service-learning (Vogel et al. 2010). The present research can thus inform educationalists, administrators, and policymakers about the potential of service-learning as a pedagogical method and some of the elements it entails."
