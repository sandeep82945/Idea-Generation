    "abstractText": "Globally, category asset allocation as the core investment method has been the consensus of the industry. Macroeconomic index data and market data of various asset indexes reflect different economic states of each economic cycle and can calculate the risk and return characteristics of a certain type of asset, and construct passive investment portfolio. However, for China's investors and investment environment, we need a more suitable macroeconomic and broad asset category forecast model. In order to find high-frequency and effective macroeconomic indicators, we divided China's macroeconomic operation status from 2001 to 2021 into different economic states. In this paper, macroeconomic environment such as economic growth, inflation and interest rate of China in the next five years is simulated through macroeconomic models or other mathematical models. According to the above calculated GDP growth rate, the consumer price index (CPI) is used to calculate the inflation rate of money and commodities, and the monthly interest rate of demand deposit is calculated to simulate and forecast the macroeconomic development situation of China in the next five years. LSTM algorithm is used for sliding window forecast of economic growth, inflation and interest rates in the next five years. The risk-return characteristics, including expected return, standard deviation of return and Sharpe ratio, of major asset indexes in the data set under various economic conditions were calculated by using the four economic conditions divided by the Merrill Lynch clock frame. The indexes listed in the data set were arranged and combined, and the risk-return characteristics of the recent five years were selected for prediction, so as to obtain the investment portfolio with relatively suitable recovery stage and high return in the next five years.",

            "text": "The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is essentially a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) of a particular form [1]. LSTM model solves the problem of RNN short-term\n1 Corresponding author: Yuantong CHEN, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Nanfang\nCollege; e-mail: chenyt200022@stu.nfu.edu.cn\nmemory by adding Gates on the basis of RNN model [2], [3], so that the cyclic neural network can effectively utilize the long distance time sequence information [4], [5].\nMajor asset index allocation [6] can smooth portfolio risks for investors through investment diversification, and allocate investment funds among different asset classes according to investment needs. However, it is difficult for us to predict which type of asset will perform better in the future, so major asset allocation will inevitably face the problem of dynamic adjustment in the course of time. Therefore, the selection of appropriate macroeconomic and broad asset forecasting models and investment portfolios is conducive to the sound development of China's investment environment and investors' choice of appropriate portfolios to achieve higher returns.\nMerrill Lynch clock theory [7] is the basic theory of investment timing. The Merrill Lynch clock framework divides macroeconomic operation conditions into four economic states: recession, recovery, overheating and stagflation. According to economic principles and historical experience, we can rotate capital allocation among major asset classes, and start to allocate this type of asset when the price of such asset is expected to rise [8]. Bonds do best in downturns, stocks do best in recoveries, commodities do best in overheating and cash-like assets do best in stagflation.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a relative number reflecting the trend and degree of price changes of consumer goods and services purchased by urban and rural residents in a certain period. It is the result of comprehensive calculation of the consumer price index of urban residents and rural residents. Through the index can observe and analyze the retail price of consumer goods and service item price changes on the actual living expenses of urban and rural residents.\nSharpe Ratio, also known as Sharpe Index, a standardized index for fund performance evaluation [9], [10]. The research of Sharpe ratio in modern investment theory shows that the size of risk plays a fundamental role in determining portfolio performance. Risk-adjusted rate of return is a comprehensive index that can consider both returns and risks at the same time, which can eliminate the adverse impact of risk factors on performance evaluation in the long run.\nAccording to the existing public data set of macroeconomic indicators and market data of major asset indexes, it can be seen that the macroeconomic indicators include finance, industry, national economic accounting, price index, prosperity index, employment and wages, interest rate and exchange rate, population, banking and currency, and other nine specific quantitative data of indicators.\nAccording to the data collected above, solve the following problems: Two or more high-frequency and effective indicators are found from the macroeconomic indicator data as specific indicators to classify different economic states under the domestic macroeconomic operation from 2001 to 2021. Establish macroeconomic models and other mathematical models to simulate China's macroeconomic environment in the next five years, including economic growth, inflation, interest rate and other indicators, and judge which economic state it is in according to the divided economic state. According to the market data of major asset indexes, four indexes are selected to represent four types of assets, including stocks, commodities, bonds, cash and their equivalents, and the risk-return characteristics, which including expected return, standard deviation of return rate, Sharpe ratio or others, under different economic conditions are predicted. At the same time, correlation analysis is carried out among various asset indexes."

Bonds include three indexes: (1) China Bonds and composite wealth, (2) cash and its equivalents include money funds and (3) Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio is the difference between comparing an investment to a benchmark representing the entire investment class and getting an excess return, that is, the higher the Sharpe ratio, The higher the excess rate of return per unit of risk.
