    "abstractText": "Microfluidics integration of acoustic biosensors is an actively developing field. Despite significant progress in \u201cpassive\u201d microfluidic technology, integration with microacoustic devices is still in its research state. The major challenge is bonding polymers with monocrystalline piezoelectrics to seal microfluidic biosensors. In this contribution, we specifically address the challenge of microfluidics integration on gallium arsenide (GaAs) acoustic biosensors. We have developed a robust plasma-assisted bonding technology, allowing strong connections between PDMS microfluidic chip and GaAs/SiO2 at low temperatures (70 \u25e6C). Mechanical and fluidic performances of fabricated device were studied. The bonding surfaces were characterized by water contact angle measurement and ATR-FTIR, AFM, and SEM analysis. The bonding strength was characterized using a tensile machine and pressure/leakage tests. The study showed that the sealed chips were able to achieve a limit of high bonding strength of 2.01 MPa. The adhesion of PDMS to GaAs was significantly improved by use of SiO2 intermediate layer, permitting the bonded chip to withstand at least 8.5 bar of burst pressure. The developed bonding approach can be a valuable solution for microfluidics integration in several types of MEMS devices.",

            "text": "Microfluidics field has emerged as a solution for the precise control and manipulation of fluids at microliter scales [1\u20133]. On-chip microfluidics integration is one of the most promising development vectors, particularly in the field of biosensors [4,5]. Microfluidicsintegrated lab-on-a-chip solutions have been widely used in many applications, such as clinical diagnostics on human physiological fluids, cell biology [6], detection of tumor cells, biochemical detections, electrophoresis, biochemistry, PCR [7], DNA analysis, singlecell trapping, droplets microfluidics [8], biosensors, and more [9]. Recently introduced microfluidic biosensors have the advantages of portability, high precision, easy application, and high-throughput parallel processing [10]. Ma et al. [11] showed that electrochemical biosensing made in microfluidic channels could lower the detection limit of endotoxin with a confined space and enhance van der Waals forces. They used a confined microfluidic channel and continuous flow forced the target molecules to bind to the sensing surface for fast preconcentration to enhance sensitivity and shorten detection times. Zhang et al. [12] used microfluidic channels with biosensors for detection of Salmonella using Fe-nanocluster amplification and smart phone imaging. Micromachining processes open up the possibility to combine microsensors and microfluidics onto a single chip. Various sensing technologies have been integrated in\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 755. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13050755 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 755 2 of 15\nmicrofluidic systems (e.g., optical, conductive, acoustic, radio frequency, and other), making assessing assess the physical properties of bio-analytes on a chip level possible. The ability to complete an assessment directly on a chip is a distinguishing feature of lab-ona-chip solutions compared to widely spread bio-analytical tools such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The integration of biosensors with microfluidics circuits is in the core of the development of integrated bio-analytical chips. Among all existing approaches, acoustic biosensors has become an important tool to study molecular interactions at the surface. Acoustic biosensors have been widely studied in the detection of gases and biomolecules [13,14]. There are different types of acoustic biosensor approaches that were developed during the last decades. Bulk acoustic wave devices (BAWs) became one of the most successful approaches in the field. There are several materials that can be used in the fabrication of acoustic wave sensors. GaAs has been shown to be very well suited for biosensing application [15\u201317]. GaAs is a microtechnical material that combines piezoelectric properties and the possibilities for devices integration and miniaturization. GaAs can be batch micromachined using Inductive Coupled Plasma Reactive Ion Etching as well as using low-cost wet chemical etching [18,19]. In addition to its beneficial microfabrication facilities, GaAs\u2019s surface can be chemically functionalized with alkanethiols [20], silanes, and phosphonates [21]. The microfluidics integration of GaAs BAWs has a potential to introduce a novel sensing platform. Microfluidics solutions on the other hand are used to be built based on materials such as silicon, glass, and PMMA. These materials are commonly used to manufacture fluidic channels, taking advantage of their good mechanical properties and easiness of surface modification to immobilize affinity tags for binding target molecules on surfaces. In this field, PDMS elastomers became attractive alternative materials for microfluidics due to low cost and their remarkable physical and chemical properties, such as wide temperature range, low stiffness, chemical inertness, biocompatibility, rapid prototyping, optical transparency, non-reactivity, and high gas permeability. These features make PDMS a potential material for various applications such as pattern transfer, as well as for fabrication of the complex microfluidics systems [22,23]. In addition, its low bonding temperature (lower than 100 \u25e6C) makes it an excellent material for bonding elastomer substrates since many elastomer substrates cannot withstand a high bonding temperature. Reproducible bonding/sealing remains one of the highest challenges for reliable applications of microfluidic systems in biosensors. The popular bonding methods such as anodic bonding for Si/Glass microfluidic devices, thermo-compression bonding, or chemical assisted bonding [24\u201326] encounter various difficulties when applied for piezoelectric substrates. On the other hand, polymers provide alternative solutions for microfluidics packaging. Recently, several new strategies were introduced to improve microfluidics packaging for the integrated sensor solutions. According to the literature, Kersy et al. used adhesion promotor GE SS4120, while it does not improve the adhesion of PDMS to Teflon [27]. It decreases the adhesion strength between PDMS-PDMS. However, this method improves the adhesion of PDMS to silicon, glass, and aluminum, which only allows the formation of a strong bond between the substrate and an un-structured layer of PDMS. Carlos Luis et al. [28] proposed the use of narrow electrode connectors for minimizing the solution leakage in the PDMS-Au interface. Yong et al. [29] used thermo-compression and laser bonding to fabricate multi-layer glass microfluidic chips. The application of sticky elastomer was introduced for epidermal electronics [30\u201332]. Heterogeneous crosslinking of PDMS was applied to enhance adhesion of PDMS to several substrates, as seen in Jeong et al. [33]. Plasma-assisted bonding was used by Xi et al. [34] for improving bonding between PDMS-coated glass cover plate and silicon substrate. In the current contribution, we develop the solution for microfluidics integration on GaAs biosensors. In particular, we study the PDMS-GaAs system where the challenge increases due to GaAs being inert to plasma bonding. The innovation of PDMS bonding with GaAs/SiO2 substrate is finding a method to combine the fluidic cell with GaAs in\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 755 3 of 15\norder to improve biosensors. To address the challenge, some authors have attempted to increase the adhesion between the PDMS and the substrate by using a gold layer. However, this method is not suitable for seal-patterned PDMS with micromachined GaAs. Others have proposed 3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTES) and achieved a bonding strength of 406 kPa for PMMA/PDMS bonding [35,36]. A thermal bonding method is used to bond four-layer microfluidic chip [37]. In the other approach, PDMS is mixed with a small amount of polyethylenimine solution to prepare a sticky thin layer, which works similarly to a sticky tape to adhere on glass, PMMA, and metal by contact pressing [38]. Lastly, Anil et al. [39] developed microfluidics-integrated microscale that comprise an isoporous nanostructured membrane. The GaAs on Ge/Si substrate was first flipped with the GaAs nanopyramids side bonded to a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, whereas a transparent flexible polymer film was weakly bonded by Van der Waals forces [40,41]. The SiO2 layer was used to increase PMMA bonding capability to PDMS in fabricating gas micro valves. Ahmad et al. showed a strong and irreversible bond of PDMS on PMMA when it is covered with SiO2 nano particles [42]. In this study, we developed the approach for irreversible and leakage-free plasma assisted bonding to integrate PDMS microfluidic channel on GaAs substrate. For this purpose, we combined the thin-film SiO2 intermediate layer on GaAs substrate with plasma O2 treatment and low-temperature annealing. In brief, this bonding technology is obtained in four main steps: (1) SiO2 deposition, (2) plasma O2 treatment, (3) chip alignment and bonding, and (4) annealing at low temperature 70 \u25e6C. This method is appealing for its compatibility with traditional replication methods using PDMS, and the surface structures can be retained. The characterization of PDMS and GaAs/SiO2 surfaces before bonding was verified by contact angle, Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), AFM, and SEM analysis. Bonded chips were characterized using a tensile machine strength bonding equipment on PDMS and a leakage bench test."

The drastic decrease in contact angles indicated that the hydrophobic surface of PDMS became hydrophilic due to the hydroxyl terminals on the plasma-activated PDMS\u2019s surface.

The presence of a peak at 1116 cm\u22121 corresponds to a thin layer of Si-O. In addition to the transmittance peak at 1018 cm\u22121, which relates to methyl groups, there is trace of chloroform in the silicon dioxide intermediate layer. After the treatment of the oxygen plasma, a large amount of hydroxyl groups is produced on the surfaces of both the silicon dioxide and the PDMS. The later conformal contact of the two surfaces will yield a large amount of Si-O-Si bonds, which will form strong adhesion between the two surfaces. A reorganization of the short polymeric chains supporting the creation of polar groups can be considered, resulting in an increase in temperature. One major advantage of the temperature increase is that the polymerization takes place while preserving the functionality of the monomer.

The achieved bonding strength of GaAs/SiO2 to PDMS is ~2.01 MPa. Figure 8B-right shows the average load force for different samples bonded by the presented process. A good reproducibility (bonding tests were carried out on five similar samples) for our measurements was observed, with a maximum error of 6% caused by the dispersive imprecision on the dimensions of the bonding area. Figure 8C shows photos of broken structures after the tensile tests. In the case of PDMS-SiO2/GaAs chips, failure was generally observed at the SiO2-PDMS bonding interface. However, in the case of Glass and LiNbO3 samples, failure was observed in the PDMS volume which is in agreement with the literature reports [27,36,46]. The results can be explained by the higher bonding strength between PDMS-Glass and PDMS-LiNbO3 than the coherence force of cured PDMS materials. In fact, when PDMS\u2019s surface is brought into contact at elevated temperatures where the molecular chain mobility is high, adhesion occurs at the interface. The chain ends penetrate to the opposite substrate, leading to high bonding strength. Moreover, the increase in surface roughness enhances the adhesion property of substrates. The surface roughness of LiNbO3 was bigger than glass no matter what the plasma activation time was according the findings of Xu et al. [47]. To proceed further in our interpretation, we would like to hypothesize that the large mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) should be analyzed in [47,48] between LiNbO3 and glass (14.4 (x, y-axis)-7.5 (z-axis) \u00d7 10\u22126 K\u22121 for LiNbO3 and 0.56 \u00d7 10\u22126 K\u22121 for glass). According to this hypothesis, there is bigger stress at PDMS-LiNbO3 interface due to higher mismatch in (CTE) when compared to PDMS-Glass. Therefore, PDMS-Glass resists higher load. Since the SiO2 layer was also locally detached from the GaAs surface, this failure mode is partially affected by limited adhesion of SiO2 layer on GaAs that indicates that the bonding strength is higher than the coherence of PDMS material. The high stiffness of GaAs promotes interface failure, we would like to hypothesize that the high value of the Young\u2019s modulus of GaAs (118 GPa) implies that the fracture takes place at the interface. The observed failure of the PDMS\u2013SiO2/GaAs bond was consistently at the interface between SiO2, indicating a very strong bond between SiO2 and PDMS. SiO2 has been reported to be a reliable adhesive layer to bond PMMA substrates on PDMS for microfuidic applications [42].\n3.3.3. Leakage Tests\nIn order to validate a leakage-free performance of the bonded PDMS-SiO2/GaAs chips, the channel inlet/outlet holes were equipped with epoxy-sealed connectors and the leakage test was performed under defined flow conditions (Figure 9A). The flow rate increased from 10 \u00b5L/min to 4500 \u00b5L/min, looking for the maximum working pressure with no leakage appeared. A red dye solution was used for easier optical microscope inspection of potential leakage at the border of the channel. In the leakage test, the design chips based on PDMS-SiO2/GaAs were kept intact (i.e., without dissemination of red dye solution into the bonded interface) until 8.5 bar of working pressure, which is maximum available in our experimental setup. It is clearly seen in Figure 9A that the channel is well defined, and no leakage is observed at flow rate of 4500 \u00b5L/min and 8500 mbar (the limit of control pressure sensor). The maximum working pressure and the maximum flow rate are shown in Figure 9B.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 755 11 of 15 Micromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 16\nFigure 9.

Discussion Due to the challenges related to the use of PDMS as the structural material, most\nstudies have focused on finding alternative materials. Although other polymers, such as PS, PMMA, TPE, COP, and photoresists, have been used for the fabrication of microfluidic devices [46,49\u201351]. Many different problems related to the bonding of the microfluidic channel on piezoelectric substrate such as GaAs (100) were identified. Bonding processes are required for assembly of microfluidic devices, made of two or more components. This can be achieved by using of double-sided tape, glues, or solvent bonding [52]. The bonding of PDMS on different substrates has been reported in the scientific literature [36], but the solvents used in the bonding process can also strongly influence the growth of cells cultured in the microfluidic devices [53]. Wu et al. used (3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTMS), which was a chemical coupling reagent to modify the surfaces of the noble metals, and PDMS to improve their adhesion [54]. Yong et al. proposed a novel approach to fabricate multi-layer glass microfluidics chips, which comprises laser cutting and thermocompression bonding [29]. Among the methods presented above, special treatments processes or the processes of adding additional chemical reagents are required to achieve PDMS adhesion. This work presents an approach to assess how to improve PDMS/GaAs bonding based on the combination of low temperature (<100 \u00b0C) plasma/thermal treatments and the use of appropriate intermediate bonding layer.

We proposed a new solution for bonding of PDMS microfluidic cell on the gallium arsenide substrate, covered with silicon dioxide thin intermediate layer.

The roughness and topography of various treated and non-treated PDMS and GaAs/SiO2 surfaces were also analyzed using AFM. The PDMS-SiO2/GaAs samples fabricated according the proposed method were able to withstand the load force until 200.7 N without failure, which corresponds to bonding strength f 2.01 MPa, which was the highest value we obtained. This is substantially higher th the bonding strength of oth r tested microfluidic systems, such as PDMS-Glass or PDMS-LiNbO3. An analysis system was created to measure the\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 755 12 of 15\nbonding strength of the bonded chips. Zhen et al. showed a bonding strength of over 1.4 MPa for PDMS and PMMA [36]. Yong et al. reported the optimal pressure 0.4 MPa [29]. Kersey et al. employed that the adhesion promoter GE SS4120 can improve the adhesion of PDMS to silicon, glass, and aluminum substrates, with bonding strength values 0.841 MPa, 0.847 MPa, and 0.488 MPa, respectively [27]. From our experiment, the bonding strength obtained is higher than other PDMS bonding methods. In the plasma treatment process, there is only a small amount of hydroxyl groups (the inherent hydroxyl groups) on the surfaces of PDMS and silicon dioxide layer. Xiangdong et al. mentioned that the contact of such two surfaces will produce a small amount of Si-O-Si bonds, which can only form a week adhesion force [55]. Thermal annealing is another method used to improve adhesion performance. Indeed, annealing contributes to the stabilization of the bonding layer, improves the cross-linking density in the PDMS and favors the orientation of molecular chains. Although a bonding temperature around 100 \u25e6C is low for silicon or glass substrates, it affects the bonding performance of polymer substrates greatly. Winnie et al. [56] used hot embossing techniques for bonding the PDMSPMMA system at 90 \u25e6C for 3 h. An additional annealing process at 65 \u25e6C for 1 h on PDMS and PS surfaces improved bonding and allowed the stabilization of higher SEF for a longer period of time (>3 days). In this work, to enhance bonding, we have combined plasma treatment and annealing. In our experiment, after plasma treatment, both parts are aligned and pressed together while undergoing the curing process at low temperature of 70 \u25e6C for 1 h. Pre-stress uniformly applied during bonding significantly influences the orientation of the polymer chains. Hammami et al. [57] showed that the combination of temperature and stretch promotes the orientation of molecular chains in the dielectric elastomer. Subsequently the combination of temperature and small deformation promotes bonding of our system. The chip holder ensures that the leakage could only occurs at the bounded interface between PDMS and GaAs/SiO2 substrates, i.e., not at the tubing connector. No leak was observed in the tested PDMS-SiO2/GaAs samples until maximal available working pressure of 8.5 bar. To our knowledge, it is the highest leakage-free pressure reported in the literature for PDMS-based bonding systems. A comparison between previously reported results of leakage test is shown in Table 2.\nOverall, this study presents a method for evaluating whether PDMS can be used as a reliable material for microfluidic devices in order to enhance the performance of acousticfluidics-biosensors based on GaAs. Our contribution is discussed only in terms of basic technological challenge to couple PDMS with GaAs. Nevertheless, the presented results are likely to contribute to the improvement of the performance of the microfluidics systems combining PDMS and GaAs."

            "text": "We have presented a novel bonding solution between GaAs and PDMS, which enables the development of an increasingly in-demand array in biosensors field, including those requiring high flow rates and high pressures. The combination of SiO2 intermediate layer\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 755 13 of 15\nwith plasma oxygen and low-temperature annealing (70 \u25e6C) significantly improves the bonding of PDMS to the GaAs substrate. In our acoustic biosensor application, one can assume a maximum pressure driving around 8.5 bar for the fluid. The bonding area of microfluidic devices can withstand a stress about 2.01 MPa. Additionally, this bonding method does not require wet chemical treatments on bonded surfaces, which may be prohibited in some applications. Bonding features were evaluated using different methods, bonding strength, and leakage tests. Compared to the previous studies, our included bonding method distinguished a robust and rapid fabrication technology as well as superior bonding strength and leakage-free pressure. The obtained results can be valuable for the research and development of integrated microfluidic devices based on PDMS material in general.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.H.; methodology, S.H.; software: S.H. and S.B. for tensile test; investigation, S.H.; validation, S.H. and A.O.; formal analysis, S.H., S.B. and C.E.-C.; writing\u2014 original draft, S.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.H., A.O., S.B., R.Z.; C.E.-C. and T.L.; visualization, S.H., A.O., S.B., R.Z., C.E.-C. and T.L.; supervision, C.E.-C. and T.L.; project administration, T.L.; funding acquisition, T.L.
