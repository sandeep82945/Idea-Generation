1. **Investigate the moderating role of organizational culture in the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior.** Organizational culture can influence the values, norms, and behaviors of employees, and it may also affect the way in which coaching leadership is perceived and enacted. For example, in a culture that values innovation and risk-taking, coaching leaders may be more likely to encourage employees to engage in deviant innovation, while in a culture that values conformity and stability, coaching leaders may be more likely to discourage such behavior.


2. **Explore the mediating role of psychological safety in the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior.** Psychological safety is the belief that one can take interpersonal risks without fear of being punished or humiliated. It is an important factor in fostering creativity and innovation, as it allows employees to feel comfortable sharing their ideas and taking risks. Future research could investigate whether psychological safety mediates the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior, such that coaching leaders create a psychologically safe environment in which employees feel comfortable engaging in deviant innovation.


3. **Examine the boundary conditions of the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior.** There may be certain boundary conditions under which the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior is stronger or weaker. For example, the relationship may be stronger when employees have a high level of trust in their leaders, or when the organization has a strong culture of innovation. Future research could investigate the boundary conditions of the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior, in order to identify the factors that make this relationship more or less likely to occur.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of coaching leadership on employees' deviant innovation behavior.** Most research on the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior has focused on the short-term effects of this relationship. However, it is also important to consider the long-term effects of coaching leadership, such as whether it can lead to sustained increases in employees' deviant innovation behavior over time. Future research could investigate the long-term effects of coaching leadership on employees' deviant innovation behavior, in order to determine whether this relationship is sustainable over time.


5. **Explore the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior in different cultural contexts.** The relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior may vary across different cultural contexts. For example, in cultures that value individualism, coaching leaders may be more likely to encourage employees to engage in deviant innovation, while in cultures that value collectivism, coaching leaders may be more likely to discourage such behavior. Future research could investigate the relationship between coaching leadership and employees' deviant innovation behavior in different cultural contexts, in order to identify the factors that influence this relationship across cultures.
