It has encouraged social media influencers (SMIs) around the world to help raise money through their own Instagram accounts. Thus, this study aims to understand the roles of SMIs in fundraising activities, to identify the influencers\u2019 attributes which affect their followers\u2019 willingness to donate, and to explore the motivation of the followers to donate. The SMI who became the subject of this study is Rachel Vennya, an Instagram celebrity who is also an entrepreneur. Background Problems: The growing role of SMIs in online fundraising has indirectly made them idols. However, there is a need to investigate what drives social media users\u2019 willingness to support and donate to online fundraising hosted by SMIs. Novelty: This study enriches the literature about SMIs and the motivation to donate in different contexts, such as online fundraising through Instagram, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Research Methods: Using a qualitative method, semi-structured interviews with 10 informants, who were aged between 25 and 35 years old were conducted. The informants were selected from among Rachel Vennya\u2019s Instagram followers and participated in her COVID-19 fundraising campaign. Finding/Results: In accordance with the objectives, there are three roles for the SMIs, which are expanding their followers, raising awareness and inspiring people to donate. The findings also identified three characteristics that affect the willingness of people to donate, namely attractiveness, trustworthiness and ability, while the influencer\u2019s influence and making it easy to donate are the motivations for the followers\u2019 intentions to donate. Conclusion: The findings could contribute to the knowledge of SMIs and online fundraising. They could also help the governments\u2019 efforts to get nonprofit organizations to focus attention on proactive strategies aimed at boosting their online fundraising campaigns in the future.

            "text": "Social media influencers, who are also known as online celebrities, are famous because they are always active on social media (Gunawan, 2021). As social media influencers, they need to act as role models to their followers because young people today look to influencers for guidance in their decision making. Through social media influencers, non-profit organizations can potentially gain access to their target audiences that they would otherwise find hard to reach. With proper use, social media influencers can be a powerful asset for non-profit organizations. This is because social media influencers are highly influential in persuading users to support or communicate with the activities they promote (De Veirman, Cauberghe & Hudders, 017). Supportive influencers can offer an additional dimension that can reach a target audience and contribute to a fundraising campaign, particularly if it is aimed at young people, who are the ones most likely to follow and trust social media personalities. Of course, these types of online charitable donations are becoming more popular nowadays.\nFundraising is one of the activities based on one's awareness of helping others (Gunawan, 2021) and during the COVID-19 pandemic, fundraising activities became even more challenging. With the power of social media, non-profit organizations have used certain strategies to achieve their fundraising objectives. In response to this, social media influencers around the world have started taking actions to raise funds and help support COVID-19 efforts. Some organizations or individuals, such as celebrities and influencers, feel the need to lend a hand in overcoming this situation through COVID-19 prevention campaigns and collecting donations through social media. One of the social media influencers in Indonesia who did fundraising campaigns is Rachel Vennya.\nThrough Instagram, she successfully collected 7 billion rupiah on the Kitabisa.com platform in just 76 days, using the headline \"Tolong Menolong Lawan COVID-19\" (\u201cPlease Help Against COVID-19\u201d) (Utami, 2020). Her goal was to help people who lost their jobs, assist informal workers and raise funds for medical equipment and medicines.\nAs the participation of celebrities in charity campaigns still garner attention and awareness of the causes, this could have an indirect impact on the supporters, and thus on donations (Septiningtyas, Darmawan, Ulva & Manaf, 2021). Therefore, the social media should come from trusted sources if it is to have an impact on its followers. This is because reputation plays a very important role in conveying a message to the recipient. However, few studies use social media influencers and their attributes as an object. Thus, the researchers are interested in using Rachel Vennya, who is an online celebrity, to engage with potential donors through her social media outlet and get them to make donations.\nThus, the aims of this study are to understand the roles of social media influencers in contributing to fundraising activities, to identify the influencer\u2019s attributes that affect the willingness of his/her followers to donate money and to discuss the motivation for the followers\u2019 intentions to donate.\nIn the following section, the literature on social media influencers and online fundraising is reviewed and summarized. Then, there is a discussion on the source credibility theory and the research\u2019s framework. A description of the research\u2019s methodology and analysis follows. The findings will then be reported. Finally, this paper concludes by discussing the research\u2019s findings, limitations and implications, as well as future research."

            "heading": "1. Social media influencer",
            "text": "A social influencer is someone who has followers on social media and is able to convey messages that can influence people (De Veirman, Cauberghe, & Hudders, 2017). This demonstrates how social media influencers can relate to their own image. Also known as celebrity endorsers, ambassadors or spokespersons, they are being used more frequently by charity organizations and non-profit organizations (Li & Yu, 2020). By having certain capabilities nowadays, they are looked-up to and supported by their followers.\nHowever, having a large audience is not enough to ensure that a message will be successfully conveyed (De Veirman, Cauberghe, & Hudders, 2017; Mat Saad & Mustaffa, 2018). As such, social media influencers should be able to foster communication and interaction in their networks with specific audiences and respond to audience inquiries. In fact, the followers will tend to share and spread the influencers\u2019 content to other parties, to become involved in the activities. Peterson, Tripoli, Langenbach and Devasagayam (2018) said that good content from social media influencers can attract others to deliver and receive the message well. For example, celebrity experts who are experienced may be reliable, have a quality reach and relationships, but may not be the right representative to support a particular campaign and what needs to be conveyed by the influencer to his/her social media followers.\nInfluencers should be known as wise and accomplished people (Peterson et al., 2018). Furthermore, the content and current issues expressed by the influencer should be seen by the audience as much as possible. This is where having a group of social media followers, or fans, is the key to getting the message conveyed,\nso that they become loyal followers of the influencer and social media.\nOf course, influencers want to use their platform wisely, and seeking direct donations is an easy way to do this. They can dominate the target audience\u2019s intention to donate easily (Li, Wu, Hsieh &Liou, 2020). Influencers also have large numbers of active social media followers, as they are empowered to influence the decisions of their followers due to their authority, knowledge, position and connections (Tafesse & Wood, 2021). Besides, they are people who have earned a reputation for their knowledge and expertise in a specific area. They also regularly post campaign messages on their social media platforms and generate a large number of enthusiastic and committed people who pay attention to their opinions. Some social media influencers are seen as successful and effective examples of communicators in inviting people to donate. The influencers are potentially effective because they have some personal factors and content that is commonly preferred by people, proven by their large numbers of followers (Tafesse & Wood, 2021).\nTherefore, the researchers aim is to understand the roles of social media influencers in contributing to fundraising activities and to identify the influencers\u2019 attributes that affect the willingness of their followers to donate money."

            "heading": "2. Online fundraising",
            "text": "Fundraising is a voluntary activity that is used as a public campaign for the purpose of collecting monetary gifts for a charity or public organization to use in a good cause (Bhati & McDonnell, 2019). The COVID-19 outbreak has completely changed the fundraising landscape, as there are new practices, such as charitable crowdfunding through social media, which are becoming increasingly important (Li, Wu, Hsieh & Liou, 2020). Online fundraising is simply a\nmethod of raising money through the Internet. This means non-profit organizations can raise donations without hosting face-to-face events and going door-to-door to collect money. All that is needed is a computer and Internet connection, and money can be raised without leaving home.\nSocial media can serve as a valuable campaign platform for charities, so non-profit organizations and individuals have adopted it as a marketing tool to collect donations (Li et al., 2020). There are a number of advantages that make this a more attractive option than face-toface engagements. It plays an important role in online fundraising because its impact is more significant than campaigning to raise funds. For example, a non-profit organization does not need to hold a real-world campaign to raise funds. Social media platforms offer the potential for non-profit organizations to create, support, and implement successful fundraising campaigns. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are among the most visited social media platforms in the US, and worldwide (Auter & Fine, 2018). Furthermore, online fundraising is easier and more practical, economical, more accessible, more appealing and can be targeted. That is the reason why many public personalities have partnered with non-profit organizations to generate attention and money, using digital channels like YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. Thus, this study analyzes an online fundraising event by one social media influencer in Indonesia, Rachel Vennya."

            "heading": "3. Source Credibility Theory",
            "text": "The source credibility theory is one of the ideas used by communicators who have favorable attributes that may influence the receiver's acceptance of the message that they deliver (Li & Yu, 2020). This theory explains that people with a strong identity can make people follow\nwhat they communicate without any degree of persuasion. When someone has superior intrinsic characteristics, they may be more persuasive in presenting an idea.\nAccording to Ohanian (1990), there are three key traits of source credibility: trustworthiness, attractiveness and expertise. Djafarova and Rushworth (2017) further suggested that the success of celebrity endorsements depends upon two factors: The perceived attractiveness and the perceived credibility of the celebrity among the existing and potential followers.\nThe source credibility theory plays an important role in getting a message across to an audience. On the other hand, the source can make the message believable which can influence a change of opinion about the message. This is because when the speaker is perceived to have good characteristics, this may make the message more acceptable to the audience.\nThis theory can be relatable to how Rachel Vennya makes her followers believe she is a credible source regarding online fundraising. According to Li and Yu (2020), source credibility suggests that, in order to create a selfdetermining relationship with a person, an individual will attempt to follow the person\u2019s attitudes, beliefs or behavior. Consistent with this theory, studies have suggested that fans who dedicate themselves to a particular celebrity will be influenced by the celebrity; they try to impersonate them by embracing their lifestyle and values (Peterson et al., 2018). They yearn to be like celebrities and posess their qualities, such as having good prospects, being famous and prosperous."

            "text": "First of all, the roles of social media influencers are vital aspects of media platforms and demonstrate their influence in the virtual\nenvironment (Tafesse & Wood, 2021). Relationships between influencers and followers build social connections, so the role of influencers is to reflect them and have them recognized as a critical sign of their reputation, which can have an impact on potential donators (Tafesse & Wood, 2021).\nSecond, social media influencers post messages to communicate with audiences and build a social image, thereby fostering social acceptance (Ayuni, 2019; Gunawan, 2021). Messages displayed by the influencers convey information about themselves, allowing the audience to learn about the fundraising activities. Moreover, several messages together may represent a substantial image of the influencers to the audience. Individuals have become accustomed to trusting someone they know and interact with frequently. In addition, given that the audience can benefit from the contributions of the influencers to the platform, it is possible that the intent to make a donation is present (Gunawan, 2021). As such, it is beneficial in shaping the audience\u2019s motivation to donate.\nMETHOD, DATA, AND ANALYSIS\n1. Research Method\nThis study employed a qualitative method which reflected the objectives of this research, which were to understand the role of a social media influencer in contributing to a fundraising activity, to identify the influencer\u2019s attributes which affect the willingness of his/her followers to donate and to discuss the motivation of the followers\u2019 intention to donate. The semistructured interview technique was suitable for this study as the researchers wanted to seek the opinions and perceptions of the informants who are connected to the social media influencers, especially Rachel Vennya and her online fundraising campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.\nThe interview protocol was based on the literature review and the source credibility theory (refer to Appendix 1). Essentially, the researchers sought to ensure that the interview questions were designed to address the research aims. This process should improve the effectiveness of the interview questions and ensure that the objectives of the study were achieved (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). It is important to ensure that researchers have included the questions needed to measure the concept."

            "text": "To achieve the research objectives, a total of 10 informants age between 25 to 35 years old were involved in the interviews. Due to the limitations of the researchers, in terms of time and cost, the researchers only took some representatives of the population. The informants were selected among Rachel Vennya\u2019s Instagram followers and participated in her online fundraising campaign on COVID-19. Although the selected informants were based on just 10 followers, a number that may not be fully representative of the online followers, it was still useful to help the researchers to identify potential responses.\nInstagram is a platform that is based on visual images, which makes it possible to promote fundraising activities and donations (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017). Instagram is also an online platform that enables influencers to gather, connect and engage with fans and followers, and it makes social interactions between the followers easier (Tafesse & Wood, 2021).\nAs reported by Datareportal (2022), Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms in Indonesia. The report states that 79% of 160 million active social media users use Instagram, with users ranging from 13 to 64 years old. Due to its many users, Instagram in Indonesia has become an effective social media to use for fundraising, as it can be a promotion not only by ordinary people but also by influencers, celebrities, athletes, fashion bloggers and influential people (Danniswara, Sandhyaduhita & Munajat, 2017; Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017).\nInstagram also offers influencers the ability to host live events (Tafesse & Wood, 2021). Influencers can specifically use the live events to share fundraising information, so that their followers can actively participate. Followers can easily add donation stickers to Instagram stories to influence others to donate too. With this\nfeatures, influencers can increase their engagement and visibility, which gives the content a broader reach and further establishes their credibility. Plus, influencers can earn even more followers by hosting interactive Instagram Q&A sessions that will inspire them to make a donation. Considering these unique characteristics of Instagram, this study focused on the influence of Rachel Vennya\u2019s Instagram on motivating her followers\u2019 intention to participate and donate."

            "text": "Each interview session took between 30 and 45 minutes. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the interview sessions were conducted virtually through Webex Meeting or Zoom Meeting. The interviews were carried out in Bahasa Malaysia or in English. The video recordings of each session were transcribed and the selected quotes in Bahasa Malaysia were translated to English by the researchers. After each interview\u2019s conversation had been transcribed, a copy of the transcript was emailed to the informants along with the pre-determined themes. Each informant was asked to check the accuracy and credibility of the findings, whether the description represented their perspective and was the same as intended by the informant. Researchers also requested any additions or corrections that were necessary to confirm whether there was a misunderstanding between the data\u2019s analysis and the intent of the informant. Informant verification helped ensure that the researcher was aware that self-perception would influence the study (Patton, 2002).\nIn addition, snowball sampling was used. Snowball sampling is appropriate when the list of informants is not readily available or is not authorized by certain parties (Creswell, 2017). Informants were asked to suggest other informants who had information related to this study, particularly those who had donated to\nRachel Vennya\u2019s online fundraising on Instagram. This sampling method was continued until the researchers obtained all the required informants."

From the data, the researchers studied the themes and trends of those interviewed about social media influencers in online fundraising in Indonesia, with a particular emphasis on Rachel Vennya.\nTo analyse all the data collected, the Nvivo12 research software was used. With this software the interview transcripts were read and highlighted into the main themes. Thereafter, the transcripts were passed through an open coding process where themes and subthemes were identified.\nThematic analysis can be seen as a form of data categorization for qualitative research where researchers review the data obtained, take notes and categorize the data into themes (Hartman, 2012). This analysis helps the researchers develop their analysis from a wide range of data to discover trends and identify themes (Braun & Clarke, 2006). According to Hartman (2012), coding is the primary activity for developing the analysis. Coding for this study consisted of two phases, first level coding, based on general themes, and second level coding, to narrow the general themes down to much more targeted and specific themes (Hartman, 2012)."

The twists and turns of life did not did not stop Rachel from being independent and building a\nbusiness. The mother of two children started her career as a make-up artist and sold various beauty products via social media as well, to make her name bigger.\nOver time, Rachel began to be known as a celebrity who received endorsements from various well-known trademarks. Rachel's name was increasingly highlighted after becoming one of the celebrities whose face appeared in New York's Time Square. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees at the London School of Public Relations. She often shares inspiring activities on her social media platform, Instagram. As an icon of youth today, Rachel Vennya has a great influence on them in many different aspects of life. For example, taste in clothing, food, lifestyle, daily activities and hobbies.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic started, she and other celebrities were lined up to become influencers to disseminate COVID-19 information (Utami, 2020). She raised funds via Kitabisa.com, a crowdfunding platform in Indonesia to help medical workers fight COVID-19. Within 24 hours of the fundraising starting, over 1.1 billion rupiah had been collected on Monday, March 16, 2020 (Ansori, 2020). By March 23, 2020, the fundraising had reached 7.3, billion rupiah. Rachel has distributed the fundraising proceeds to buy PPE, masks, hand sanitizers, plastic gloves, and other personal protective equipment and has been accepted by hospitals in Indonesia.\nIn addition to raising funds to help overcome the pandemic, Rachel Vennya also often opens donations for other purposes, such as raising funds for the Donggala earthquake and Palu tsunami. She also helped raised funds for children with HIV/AIDS, victims of natural disasters in South Kalimantan and West Sulawesi, floods and landslides in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) for women."

A social media influencer is an individual who can shape the audience\u2019s attitude and behavior (De Veirman, Cauberghe, & Hudders, 2017). In order to maximize fundraising on Instagram, social media influencers have a role to play in providing insights and relevant information that will be well received by their audience, who are potential contributors. There are three roles that the informants have highlighted, which are expanding their followers/fans, raising awareness of fundraising and inspiring people to donate."

Social media influencers are able to influence audiences by having the power of persuasion on social media, such as popularity, number of likes, posts and post views. Besides, celebrities use their social media platforms for communicating and promoting the values and missions of charities.\nThe informants stated that public recognition can also be viewed from the number of hashtags with the influencer's name, or how many accounts have been tagged. Influencers are reliable voices that inspire conversations and action in their communities. As such, they can be a huge help with fundraising campaigns, when they are properly used.\nThis is an excellent way to promote fundraising. With this, the word can reach more people from various backgrounds in the world because these influencers may have a strong fan base and their followers are ready\nto support them. (Informant 6)\nTherefore, influencers must actively feed information through their social connections and increase their influence to attract more followers (Guo, Wang, Wu & Goh, 2021). Tafesse and Wood (2021) indicate that this is to increase the success rate of their fundraising campaigns, particularly when the campaigns involve social connections."

They can share content on the cause and campaigns to raise awareness. The more people know what the influencers are doing, the more interested they become in getting involved. Rachel\u2019s personal Instagram contributed to attracting people to fundraising and building personal trust as well. She was successful in raising awareness about fundraising by harnessing the power that influencers have over their followers.\nThis shows the crucial role of social media influencers in shaping the beliefs of potential donors in the fundraising process (Peterson et al., 2018). In fact, successful campaigns typically create a strong social network footprint before launching and leveraging social networks for donors."

Individuals who are physically attractive are supposed to have more socially desirable personality features, such as being friendly, powerful, competent and skillful. Most informants were supportive of Rachel because she seems cool and knows how to present herself on social media. Based on Informant 5,\nShe is beautiful and kind. When she carried out certain activities, she was concerned not only about herself but also her followers. I love her personality and she is a role model for me on social media. She makes me want to support her in any activity she is doing. (Informant 5)\nBesides, they indicated that they are willing to donate to her campaign because she is not only physically attractive, but also because she has an inner character that has helped people in need during the pandemic. Moreover, the informant pointed out that Rachel\u2019s positive character created a desire to support her as well.\nDjafarova and Rushworth (2017) mentioned that an influencer with good looks or appeal will garner positive campaign interest and support which could have an impact on the audience\u2019s perception of their message. Audiences will value anything that brings them good memories and something that makes them feel a connection, or reflects who they are."

This is believed to be an element that can improve the persuasive effect in online media and has a strong impact in changing the behavior or attitude of the audience (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017). Feedback from the informants indicated that they trusted Rachel, due to her personal experiences, making them some of Rachel\u2019s campaign donors. Rachel is also very reliable and dependable. That is because some of the influencers that have many followers fail to grasp the confidence of most of their followers.\nIn my opinion, Rachel was successful because she immersed herself by showing the conditions that required donations. It leads donors to believe that their donations will go to where they are needed. Rachel and her team, along with the online fundraising platforms they work with, will go right to the places that need donations. (Informant 2)\nBased on Li and Yu (2020), recognizing influencers\u2019 trustworthiness has a significant impact on donors\u2019 behavior (Susilo, Rani & Khotijah, 2022).

One of the most important areas of ability is having good communication and a unique approach because these will have a significant impact on the influencer him/herself, hence the viewer may see their expertise and credibility.\nRachel is a prominent social media influencer with numerous supporters. She is seen as a credible person who demonstrates a strong work ethic as a social media influencer. Rachel has great influence as a social media influencer in persuading her followers\u2019 behavior, beliefs, and attitude (Informant 1)\nAccordingly, the informants think Rachel is an expert in her area, and knows the problem, the needs and all the information before she creates a campaign and informs her followers effectively. They also said that Rachel is one of the influencers who have grown significantly in their characters. She was just starting out as an influencer. Additionally, Rachel\u2019s involvement in fundraising campaigns also had a positive impact on the audience\u2019s attitude toward the campaigns.

As an influencer should be a better role model to his/her audience, not only for his/herself but for his/her fans as well. This is what makes Rachel Vennya a great influencer, because she has good qualities that inspire her followers to achieve the same goals as her. Therefore, the right celebrities might help generate more coverage for a charity, if they were truly connected to the cause and seem not to be cynical.\nThe content of influencers is transmitted and disseminated to millions of people in a short time through social media platforms, especially Instagram. From this standpoint, an influencer\u2019s influence has a greater impact than traditional mass media. Thus, this finding supported Guo et al.

First, our findings provide an insight into the important roles played by social media influencers in motivating their followers to donate online. This study finds that social media influencers who are attractive and trustworthy are capable of winning audiences. It aligns with the previous research that said source credibility is a key quality that influences people\u2019s\nconfidence in social media influencers (Ki & Kim, 2019). Here, the presence of social media influencers with applications and various settings in Instagram allows influencers to engage with their audiences on social media platforms. The results also discover that the role of social media influencers\u2019 can inspire and motivate their audiences to participate in the fundraising.\nIn addition, our findings also have useful practical implications. Not just for social media influencers, the present study also provides needed clarity and recommendations for online fundraising strategies for NGOs and the government. Importantly, our findings could serve as additional knowledge for social media influencers to be wary of the impact of interacting with potential donators on social media.\nAlthough this study has addressed the research aims, it does have its limitations. Given that this study has chosen this subject of study, there may be some bias in the selection of Rachel Vennya as the social media influencer and her Instagram followers. This gives an opportunity for future research to look at other social media influencers. Although the current research has provided a better understanding of the subject of online fundraising, we recommend further research that explores different social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok to understand how audiences respond on different social media platforms.\nFinally, social media influencers have\nbeen playing a vital role in online fundraising, particularly in Indonesia. The good abilities of influencers who are experienced and skilled at using social media to run campaigns have a surprisingly good impact. However, the impact depends on their audience, as they may have an attitude and opinion influenced by the influencer's attractiveness, trust and ability. If\nthe influencers have a clear understanding of the fundraising objective, their followers will be interested in seeing the campaign and will be effortlessly impacted by the campaign. It is very interesting to see how Instagram has become a powerful sword in the digital age. Clearly, social media influencers have now become a channel to trigger the willingness and awareness of people to make a call to action and make donations online."
