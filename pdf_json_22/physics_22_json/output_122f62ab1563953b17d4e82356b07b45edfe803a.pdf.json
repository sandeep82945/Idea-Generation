            "text": "The quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP) is a state of matter theoretically predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where quarks and gluons are deconfined. There is a particular interest in studying the QGP since according to current cosmological models our Universe have been in such deconfined state in the early stages after the electroweak phase transition and up to \u03c4 \u2248 10 \u00b5s after the Big Bang. Experimentally, it is possible to create the QGP through ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, such as those happening at the SPS [1], RHIC [2] or the\n\u2217Review talk presented at QCD22, 25h International Conference in QCD (04-07/07/2022, Montpellier - FR).\nEmail address: victor.jose.gaston.feuillard@cern.ch (Victor Feuillard on behalf of the ALICE collaboration)\nLHC [3], but for only a short period of time and within a very small volume (e.g. \u03c4 \u223c10 fm/c and V \u223c 5 \u00b7 103 fm3 in Pb\u2013Pb at \u221a sNN = 2.76 TeV) [4]. Because of their large mass, charm and bottom quarks are primarily produced in hard scatterings at the very beginning of the collision and experience the entire medium evolution. Quarkonium resonances, which are bound states of a cc\u0304 pair for charmonium or a bb\u0304 pair for bottomonium, are therefore among the most direct signatures for the QGP formation. The properties of the quarkonia can be affected by the QGP in several ways. Firstly, theory predicts that quarkonia are suppressed in a QGP due to the colour screening [5] or dissociation [6]. This leads to a reduction of the number of quarkonium states produced in AA collisions with respect to scaled pp collisions. Secondly, a competing mechanism can occur, namely ar X iv :2\n21 2.\n11 52\n4v 1\n[ nu\ncl -e\nx] 2\n2 D\nec 2\nrecombination: if there are enough heavy quark pairs produced, then quarkonia can be regenerated by the recombination of these quarks either at the phase boundary [7] or during the QGP phase [8], resulting in an increase of the quarkonium yields. Experimental evidence of the charmonium suppression has been discovered by NA50 [9], confirmed by PHENIX [10], and the interplay between suppression and regeneration phenomena has been put into light by ALICE [11]. Finally, it is argued that the quarkonium polarization can be affected by the strong magnetic field created during the initial stage of the collisions [12] as well as by the angular momentum of the medium in non-central collisions [13].\nIn the following, a selection of the latest quarkonium measurements performed by the ALICE collaboration in pp, p\u2013Pb, and Pb\u2013Pb collisions is reported. Inclusive quarkonia in ALICE are reconstructed down to pT = 0 at both midrapidity and forward rapidity, through the dielectron and dimuon decay channel respectively. A complete description of the ALICE detector can be found in [14, 15]."

            "text": "Quarkonium production measurements in pp collisions provide a reference for the measurement in Pb\u2013 Pb collisions. Besides serving as a reference, measurements in pp collisions also allow one to explore phenomenological models, as the quarkonium formation involves both hard-scale processes for heavy quark production, and soft-scale processes for hadronization.\nThanks to the excellent spatial resolution provided by the barrel detectors, prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 can be disentangled at midrapidity. Recent measurements of prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 cross sections in pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV [16] are presented in Figure 1. The cross sections as a function of the transverse momentum (pT) are shown together with ATLAS [17] and CMS [18] measurements, and compared with several theoretical predictions. In the common pT range, the ALICE results agree with the ATLAS and CMS measurements, both for prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8.\nFor prompt J/\u03c8, the evolution of the cross section as a function of pT is well described within uncertainties by Non Relativistic QCD [19\u201322] (NRQCD) and Improved Color Evaporation [23] models (ICEM). However, the uncertainties on the model calculations do not allow to discriminate between models. For non-prompt J/\u03c8, the cross section is well described within uncertainties by FONLL calculations [24].\nAt forward rapidity, only inclusive quarkonia can be measured, and recent measurements in pp collisions at\n\u221a s = 5.02 TeV [25] are presented in Figure 2. In particular, the ratio of the inclusive \u03c8(2S ) to J/\u03c8 crosssections is shown in the top panel where it is compared with NRQCD [19] and ICEM [23] model calculations with FONLL [24] calculations added on top to account for the non-prompt charmonium contribution. Both models describe the ratio within uncertainties. The non-prompt cross section ra- tio from FONLL [24] is also shown separately for completeness.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 2 shows the \u03a5(nS ) cross sections as a function of rapidity combining ALICE and CMS data [26], and compared with ICEM predictions [23]. For all three resonances, the cross section exhibits a drop-off from a plateau towards forward rapidity, as predicted by the model calculations.\nPolarization is defined as the alignment of the particle spin with respect to a chosen axis and can be studied via the polar angle distribution of the dilepton decay products of the quarkonium with respect to a specific quantization axis [27]. This distribution is parametrized as : W(\u03b8) \u221d 13+\u03bb\u03b8 (1 + \u03bb\u03b8 cos\n2 \u03b8 + \u03bb\u03d5 sin2 \u03b8 cos 2\u03d5 + \u03bb\u03b8\u03d5 sin 2\u03b8 cos\u03d5), where \u03bb\u03b8, \u03bb\u03d5 and \u03bb\u03b8\u03d5 are the polariza-\ntion parameters. The first ALICE measurement of the \u03a5(1S ) polarization is shown in Figure 3, where the polarization parameters are shown as a function of pT. The analysis is performed considering two different reference systems: the Collins-Soper frame, where the quantization axis is chosen as the bisector between the directions of the two colliding hadrons in the quarkonium rest frame, and the Helicity frame where the quantization axis correspond to the the momentum direction of the \u03a5(1S ) in the center of mass of the colliding system. Within the uncertainties, no polarization is observed neither in the Helicity nor in the Collins-Soper reference frame. These results are compatible with similar measurements from the LHCb collaboration [28].\nFinally, the self-normalized J/\u03c8 yields in pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 and 13 TeV as a function of the self-normalized charged particle multiplicity are shown in Figure 4. Correlations between the J/\u03c8 yield and the charged particle multiplicity are useful to shed light on multiparton interactions, i.e. events where several parton-parton interactions happen in a single hadronic collision. The left and middle panels of Figure 4 show the new measurement of the self-normalized J/\u03c8 yields at forward rapidity [29] at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV\nand 13 TeV, respectively. The right panel displays the self-normalized J/\u03c8 yield at mid-rapidity at \u221a s = 13 TeV [30]. For the three measurements, the charged particle multplicity is measured at mid-rapidity.\nAs opposed to midrapidity where the self-normalized J/\u03c8 yield grows faster than linear as a function of the event multiplicity, the J/\u03c8 yield at forward rapidity grows approximatively linearly, independently of the collision energy. These trends can be described qualitatively by models including either initial state effects or both initial and final state effects [31\u201336]. Some models, such as the Percolation model, the Coherent Particle Production (CPP) model and the 3 Pomeron Color Glass Condensate (CGC) model even manage to describe the results quantitatively in both rapidity ranges."

            "text": "Measurements in p\u2013Pb collisions allow one to study cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, such as the modifications of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in nuclei. For a nucleon inside a nucleus, it leads to a change in the probability for a quark or gluon to carry a fraction x of the nucleon momentum. Other effects may come into play, such as energy loss via initialstate radiation [37], energy loss through coherent effects [38], interactions of the final states with comoving matter [39] or inelastic interactions with the surrounding nucleon [40] (negligible at LHC energies). Results in p-Pb are crucial for the correct interpretation of Pb\u2013 Pb measurements, in particular they allow to distinguish\nthe effects originating from the hot medium from those caused by the initial presence of nuclear matter. Furthermore, the asymmetry of the p\u2013Pb collision allows us to probe different Bjorken-x regions of the lead nucleus, in particular measurements in the p-going (Pb-going) direction allow one to investigate low (high) Bjorken-x region.\nThe measurement of correlations between the quarkonium yield and the charged particle multiplicity in p\u2013Pb collisions are useful to understand how initial-state nuclear effects impact the quark-antiquark pair created in the hard scattering, and to investigate final state effects. Recent results of the self-normalized \u03c8(2S ) to J/\u03c8 double ratio as a function of the selfnormalized charged particle multiplicity in p\u2013Pb collisions at \u221a sNN = 8.16 TeV [41] are shown in Figure 5, at forward (top) and backward (bottom) rapidity. Both in the p-going (2.03 < yCMS < 3.53) and in the Pb-going (\u22124.46 < yCMS < \u22122.96) directions, the double ratio is compatible with unity as a function of the charged particle multiplicity, indicating a similar multiplicity dependence for the \u03c8(2S ) and J/\u03c8 states. This trend can be described by the comover model within the large uncertainties [39], even if the model predicts a ratio 20% below unity at backward rapidity.\nCNM effects can also affect the quarkonium production, which can be investigated by measuring the nuclear modification RpPb in p\u2013Pb collisions. RpPb is defined as the ratio of the production yield in p\u2013Pb with the production yield in pp collisions normalized to the number of binary collisions. A new measurement of the nuclear modification factor RpPb measured in p\u2013Pb collisions at \u221a sNN = 5.02 TeV [42] is shown in Figure 6 for the inclusive, prompt (top panel) and non-prompt\nALI\u2212PUB\u2212525640\nJ/\u03c8 (bottom panel) in the midrapidity region. For inclusive and prompt J/\u03c8, RpPb exhibits a similar trend, with a clear suppression for pT < 3 GeV/c. For nonprompt J/\u03c8, a smaller suppression compared to prompt J/\u03c8 is observed, with no pT dependence within uncertainties. In the overlapping pT range, ALICE results agree with the ATLAS measurements [17]. Theoretical calculations [43\u201345], incorporating various combinations of CNM effects, reproduce the data within uncertainties."

A strong increase can be observed for both resonance states towards lowpT, which is an indication of recombination. The ALICE results are compared with the corresponding results from CMS [47] and show a good agreement in the overlapping pT range, despite the different rapidity coverage. The transport model [48] predictions are in good agreement with the data as a function of pT.\nAs shown in the bottom panel of Figure 7, the results as a function of centrality indicate that the \u03c8(2S ) is more suppressed than the J/\u03c8 in the entire centrality\nrange, and the \u03c8(2S ) RAA does not exhibit any trend within the current uncertainties. The results as a function of centrality are compared with transport model and SHMc predictions [49]. Both models reproduce the data within uncertainties, however, SHMc predictions tend to slightly underestimate the data in central collisions.\nThe J/\u03c8 nuclear modification factors for prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 measured in Pb\u2013Pb collisions at\u221a\nsNN = 5.02 TeV and at midrapidity are shown in the top and bottom panel of Figure 8, for central collions and as a function of pT. The prompt J/\u03c8 are not suppressed at low pT but only at higher pT, indicating the dominance of recombination mechanism at low-pT in the charmonium sector. As shown in the top panel of Figure 8, the pT-dependent prompt J/\u03c8 RAA is compatible with SHMc model predictions [50] up to 5 GeV/c while at higher pT, the data is compatible with a model embedding NRQCD into a highly dense gluonic medium [51] whereas SHMc underpredicts the data. For non-prompt J/\u03c8, the data is compatible with models implementing beauty quark energy loss including both collisional and radiative processes [52, 53] at high pT. Compared with ATLAS [54] and CMS [47] data, the ALICE data, including non-prompt D0 mesons, are compatible in the overlapping pT range.\nFinally, the polarization of the J/\u03c8 has been measured in Pb\u2013Pb collisions as a function of the event plane [55]. The results of \u03bb\u03b8 as a function of centrality and pT are\nshown in Figure 9. A significant non-zero polarization is found in central and semi-central collisions. The results as a function of pT indicate that the deviation from zero is larger at small transverse momentum. This tends to show that effects at play in the early stages of the collision, such as magnetic field, contribute less to the polarization, but no theoretical predictions are available to confront these very interesting data at the moment."
