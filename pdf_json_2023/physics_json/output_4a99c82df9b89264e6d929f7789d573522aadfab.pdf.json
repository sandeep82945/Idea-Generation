    "abstractText": "Prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1), an endogenous arachidonic acid metabolite, regulates diverse physiological functions in many tissues and cell types through binding and activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the PGF2\u03b1 receptor (FP), which also is the primary therapeutic target for glaucoma and several other diseases. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human FP bound to endogenous ligand PGF2\u03b1 and antiglaucoma drugs LTPA and TFPA at global resolutions of 2.67 \u00c5, 2.78 \u00c5, and 3.14 \u00c5. These structures reveal distinct features of FP within the lipid receptor family in terms of ligand binding selectivity, its receptor activation, and G protein couplingmechanisms, including activation in the absence of canonical PIF and ERY motifs and Gq coupling through direct interactions with receptor transmembranehelix 1 and intracellular loop 1. Togetherwithmutagenesis and functional studies, our structures reveal mechanisms of ligand recognition, receptor activation, and G protein coupling by FP, which could facilitate rational design of FP-targeting drugs.",

Eric Xu 1,6\nProstaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1), an endogenous arachidonic acid metabolite, regulates diverse physiological functions in many tissues and cell types through binding and activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the PGF2\u03b1 receptor (FP), which also is the primary therapeutic target for glaucoma and several other diseases. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human FP bound to endogenous ligand PGF2\u03b1 and antiglaucoma drugs LTPA and TFPA at global resolutions of 2.67 \u00c5, 2.78 \u00c5, and 3.14 \u00c5. These structures reveal distinct features of FP within the lipid receptor family in terms of ligand binding selectivity, its receptor activation, and G protein couplingmechanisms, including activation in the absence of canonical PIF and ERY motifs and Gq coupling through direct interactions with receptor transmembranehelix 1 and intracellular loop 1. Togetherwithmutagenesis and functional studies, our structures reveal mechanisms of ligand recognition, receptor activation, and G protein coupling by FP, which could facilitate rational design of FP-targeting drugs.\nProstanoids are a class of oxygenated arachidonic acidmetabolites that include prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and prostacyclin (PGI2). They provoke diverse biological actions in many tissues and cell types through direct interactions with nine lipid G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), prostaglandin F2\u03b1 receptor (FP), prostaglandin D2 receptors (DP1-2), prostaglandin E2 receptors (EP1-4), thromboxane receptor (TP) and prostacyclin receptor (IP1)1, which comprise a subfamily of class A GPCRs. FP is encoded in humans by the PTGFR gene2. Stimulated by PGF2\u03b1, FP plays a pivotal role in regulating inflammation, allergic responses, intraocular pressure, and blood pressure, making it a valuable target for therapeutic discovery and development1,3\u20135. FP is highly expressed in uterine myometrium, eye, smooth muscle, skin, and ovarian6,7. Uponagonist stimulation, FP is predominantly coupled to the Gq subtype of G proteins, which activation leads to subsequent PKC activation and a transient calcium signaling in response to the formation of inositol triphosphate8,9. In addition to Gq, FP activation also induces activation of small G protein Rho via G12/G13 10 and activation of Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway through Gi11. Given the diverse functions of FP, it has been targeted for therapeutic development. PGF2\u03b1, the endogenous FP activator, entered a clinical trial for glaucoma treatment12. However, its clinical application was limited by intolerable side effects, possibly caused by its low selectivity for FP receptor12. Since then, selective FP agonists have attracted extensive attention and have been developed for the treatment of glaucoma5, scalp alopecia13, and vitiligo14. From 1996 to 2012, several FP-selective prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for glaucoma treatment. As a prodrug of a selective FP receptor agonist, latanoprost (LTP) was approved to treat glaucoma for the first time in 1996. It has\nReceived: 23 November 2022\nAccepted: 2 May 2023\nCheck for updates\n1State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China. 2Sironax (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing 102206, China. 3Lingang Laboratory, Shanghai 200031, China. 4School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, 201210 Shanghai, China. 5Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350108, China. 6University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China. 7These authors contributed equally: Canrong Wu, Youwei Xu.\ne-mail: wucanrong@simm.ac.cn; eric.xu@simm.ac.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2668 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nalso been used to treat scalp alopecia15 and vitiligo14 in recent years. Latanoprost acid (LTPA), 17-phenyl-13,14-dihydro PGF2\u03b1, is an active metabolic form of LTP. Another fluorinated PGA prodrug, tafluprost (TFP), was first approved for the treatment of glaucoma in 201216. Tafluprost acid (TFPA), 15-deoxy-15,15-difluoro-16-phenoxy PGF2\u03b1, is the activemetabolic formof TFP. Due to their high efficacy, these PGAs have been the first-line drug in clinics for the treatment of glaucoma. However, through post-marketing surveillance, 5\u201320% of patients suffered side effects such as conjunctival congestion and headache, including intolerance responses toward these PGAs17\u201319. Improving the selectivity of these drugs to the FP receptor and elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional selectivity of individual prostanoid receptor family members are highly important and clinically relevant.\nExtensive efforts have been made to clarify how the binding of endogenous and synthetic ligands with various pharmacological profiles regulate FP\u2019s downstream signaling8\u201311. However, the molecular details defining the bindingmodes of ligands remain largely unknown, which is partly attributed to the scarcity of the structural information on ligands bound FP complex. Understanding the mechanism of prostaglandin-FP signaling and identifying differences in the ligand selectivity of prostaglandin receptorsmay assist in the development of selective drugs with improved safety.\nHerewepresent three cryo-EM structures of Gprotein-coupled FP in complex with its endogenous ligand PGF2\u03b1 and with two synthetic agonists, LTPA and TFPA, at global resolutions of 2.67, 2.78, and 3.14 \u00c5. Combined with functional characterizations of mutated receptors, these structures reveal conserved and divergentmechanisms of ligand binding, receptor activation, and G protein coupling by FP."

A G\u03b1q chimera was engineered based on the mini-G\u03b1s scaffold with an N-terminal replacement of corresponding sequences of G\u03b1i1 to facilitate the binding of scFv1622\u201324. Hereinafter, G\u03b1q reference to G\u03b1q chimera. The FP-Gq complex was further stabilized by the NanoBiT strategy\n25. Incubation of PGF2\u03b1/LTPA/TFPA with membranes from cells co-expressing receptors and heterotrimer Gq proteins in the presence of scFv16 and Nb35 enables efficient assembly of the PGF2\u03b1/LTPA/TFPA -FP-Gq complexes, which produces highly homogenous complex samples for structural studies26 (Supplementary Figs. 1\u20133, Table 1). The structures of the FP-Gq-scFv16-Nb35 complexes with PGF2\u03b1, LTPA, and TFPA were determined by cryo-EM to the resolutions of 2.67, 2.78, and 3.14 \u00c5 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figs. 1\u20134). The high-quality density map allowed unambiguous model building for the receptor structure containing residues 29\u2013323, except for two invisible residues in the intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) (residues 238 and 239). Thedensitymaps are also clear for three agonists, most residues of the Gq heterotrimer, scFv16, and Nb35 (Fig. 1b, c Supplementary Fig. 4).\nThe overall structure of the active FP receptor is highly similar to those of active EP2 (PDB code: 7CX2) and EP4 (PDB code: 7D7M), with root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 1.27 and 1.23 \u00c5, respectively. FP folds into a canonical seven-transmembrane helical domain (TMD). All three extracellular loops (ECLs 1\u20133) were well defined, where ECL2 forms a \u03b2-hairpin loop, which is stabilized by the highly conserved disulfide bond between C186ECL2 and C1083.25. The \u03b2-hairpin ECL2 of FP resembles those of EP2 and EP4, and tightly caps the extracellular region (Fig. 1d). We superpose the TMD structures of PGF2\u03b1-bound FPwith PGE2-bound EP2 andEP4 to compare their overall receptor conformations and ligand-binding pockets. A notable structural difference occurs in the H8 of these receptors. The H8 of FP is almost perpendicular to that of EP2, with a rotation of 82.3\u00b0, and is closer to the cell membrane compared with the H8 of EP4. (Fig. 1e). In\naddition, although these ligands share a similar chemical scaffold and relatively conserved binding pocket in these three receptors, PGF2\u03b1 displays a distinct binding pose fromPGE2 in these complexes (Fig. 1e), as detailed below."

            "heading": "The PGF2\u03b1 binding pocket of FP",
            "text": "The endogenous ligand PGF2\u03b1 is mainly composed of three parts, a carboxyl group-containing \u03b1-chain, a five-membered ring (F ring) with two hydroxyl groups, and a hydrophobic \u03c9 chain with one hydroxyl group at \u03c96 position (Fig. 2a). The cryo-EM map enabled the unambiguous assignment of PGF2\u03b1 within the receptor pocket. PGF2\u03b1 is well resolved in the FP ligand-binding pocket by adopting an L-shape conformation with its carboxyl group-containing \u03b1-chain fitting into a hydrophilic sub-pocket near the top of the receptor (Fig. 2a), formed by residues from TM1, TM7, and ECL2 (Fig. 2b). The carboxyl group in the \u03b1-chain of PGF2\u03b1 forms a salt bridge with R2917.40 and hydrogen bonds with T184EL2 and Y922.65. Mutations of residues R2917.40, T184EL2, and Y922.65, which are highly conserved in prostanoid receptors and participate directly in receptor binding, lead to decreased activity of PGF2\u03b1 (Fig. 2b\u2013d, Supplementary Fig. 5-6). Although electrostatic contacts are the major driving force for the interactions between the \u03b1-chain and the positively chargedbinding pocket of FP, several hydrophobic residues also play important roles. Particularly, we did see the side chain of M1153.23 forms lone pair-\u03c0 interaction with ethylene linkage in the \u03b1-chain (Fig. 2b, c, Supplementary Fig. 6). Mutating this methionine in FP to alanine decreased the affinity for PGF2\u03b1 by approximately 100-fold (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 5). The F ring is located in a sub-pocket formed by TM1, TM2, and TM7 (Fig. 2b). These two hydroxyl groups in F ring mainly participate in polar interactions with the receptor. Particularly, these hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds with S331.39 and T2947.43, which are not conserved among prostanoid receptor family members, indicating that this part mainly contributes to the selectivity of PGF2\u03b1 to FP.Meanwhile,mutation of S33\n1.39 or T2947.43 in FP to alanine significantly impaired the affinity to PGF2\u03b1 (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 5). Besides \u03b1 chain and F ring, the \u03c9 chain penetrates into the hydrophobic pocket formed by TM5, TM6, and TM7. This alkyl chain forms hydrophobic interactions with F2055.41, W2626.48, F2656.51, and L2907.39. Mutations of these residues in FP to alanine significantly impaired the affinity to PGF2\u03b1 (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 5). Besides hydrophobic interaction, the \u03c96 hydroxy group forms a hydrogen bond with H812.54, which mutated to alanine also caused a dramatically reduced the activity of PGF2\u03b1 to FP by over 1000 folds (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 5). Collectively, the \u03b1-chain and \u03c9-chain that bind to the sub-pockets with highly conserved residues, mainly contributes to high receptor binding affinity, while the F ring could be important for receptor selectivity.\nSpecific engagement of LTPA and TFPA with FP Even though FP is an important therapeutic target for many diseases, the poor selectivity of PGF2\u03b1 has hampered its clinical application. LTPA and TFPA, two synthetic relative selective FP agonists, have been widely used in clinical treatment for diseases including glaucoma. LTPA showed high affinity to FP with an EC50 of 3.6 nM but only moderate potency to EP1 and EP3, with an EC50 of 6.9 and 17\u03bcM, respectively27. Compared to PGF2\u03b1, the selectivity was enhanced by more than 100 times27. TFPA is the most potent FP agonist (EC50: 0.4 nM) and has a fairly low potency to the other members of the prostanoid receptor family except for EP3 (EC50: 67 nM)\n28. LTPA, TFPA, and PGF2\u03b1 all have shared \u03b1-chain and F ring, while LTPA and TFPA have bulky substitutions in the\u03c9-chain compared to PGF2\u03b1 (Fig. 3 a-e). LTPA and TFPA bond to FP in nearly identical binding poses as PGF2\u03b1 did, displaying a similar \u201cL\u201d-shape configuration in these two solved structures (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the carboxylate groups of LTPA andTFPA form strong polar interactions with R2917.40, T184EL2, and Y922.65, the\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2668 2\nethylene linkage in the \u03b1-chain forms a lone pair-\u03c029 interaction with M1153.23, and the two hydroxy groups in the F ring form hydrogen bonds with S331.39 and T2947.43 (Fig. 3b, c). Consistent with this observation, mutations of these residues in FP to alanine significantly decreased the potency of LTPA and TFPA to FP.\nThe derivatized \u03c9-chain in LTPA also directly binds to FP. The phenyl group in the \u03c9-chain of LTPA packs against F2055.41, F2656.51, F187ECL2, L2907.39, and W2626.48 with hydrophobic interactions. These residues are highly conserved in FP, EP1, and EP3. Interestingly, besides forming a hydrogen bond with H812.54, the hydroxyl group in the \u03c9 chain forms an additional hydrogen bond with S1183.35, which only exists in FP (Fig. 3d\u2013f), indicating that this residue is of vital importance for the selectivity of LTPA to FP. Consistent with this finding, mutation of this serine to alanine or asparagine significantly reduced the potency of LTPA to induce FP activation (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 5).\nSimilar to LTPA, the phenyl group in the \u03c9-chain of TFPA forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with FP. Moreover, the oxygen atom forms a hydron bond with the side chain of Q297, and the two fluoride groups in the carbon 12-position of TFPA form three hydrogen bondswith several residues in FP30, whichmayexplain its high potency to FP. One fluoride group in TFPA forms hydrogen bonds toH812.54 and S1183.35, as the hydroxyl group in LTPA did. Notably, the other fluoride group forms a hydrogen bond with N842.57(Fig. 3e, Supplementary\nFig. 6). This residue is highlydiverse amongprostanoid receptor family members. Intriguingly, among the other 8 prostanoid receptors, only EP3 and TP harbor a similar polar uncharged residue, threonine (Fig. 3f). Through structural analysis, mutation of N842.57 to threonine in FP could still form a hydrogen bond with the fluoride group (Supplementary Fig. 6). This explains its strong affinity for EP3. Consistent with this prediction, mutation of this residue to threonine does not significantly reduce ligand binding of TFPA, but mutating to alanine\n90\u00b0\n90\u00b0\n74.3\u00b0\nPGF2\u03b1\nG\u03b2 G\u03b2\nMicell\nG\u03b3\nscFv16\nNb35\nNb35\nG\u03b1q chimera\nG\u03b1q chimera\nEP4 EP2 EP4 EP2 FP FP\nactive FP\nTM7\nTM6TM5\nTM3\nTM1\nTM1\nTM2\nTM3 TM4TM5\nTM6\nTM7\nECL2\nECL2\nC186ECL2\nC1083.25\nTM2\nECL2 PGF2\u03b1\nFP FP\nLTPA\nTFPA\na\nb\nd e\nc\n82.3\u00b0 20.4\u00b0\nPGE2 in EP4\nPGE2 in EP2\nPGF2\u03b1 in FP\nFig. 1 | Cryo-EM structures of FP\u2013Gq complexes. a Cryo-EM density of FP-Gq in complexwith PGF2\u03b1, LTPA, or TFPA.

In addition, TM5 of FP laterally shifts relative to that of antagonist-bound TP. These conformation changes largely resemble that of the Gq-coupled 5-HT2AR complex (PDB: 6WHA)22 (Fig. 4a), but the outward amplitude of TM6of FP is smaller than that of 5-HT2AR (Fig. 4a).\nStructure comparison of the active FP in complex with PGF2\u03b1 and the inactive TP bound to an antagonist provide clues for understanding the activation mechanism of FP. Upon PGF2\u03b1 binding, the \u03c9chain of PGF2\u03b1 approaches the toggle switch residue W262\n6.48 to trigger the downward displacement of W2626.48 by 2.4 \u00c5 (Fig. 4b, c). The movement of W2626.48 further constitutes a hydrophobic LLW core triad, which is comprised of L1233.40, L2135.49, and W2626.48, to fasten TM3, TM5, and TM6. The importance of the LLW core triad is\nfunctionally supported by the decreased potency of PGF2\u03b1 to activate L1233.40A and L2135.49A FP mutants (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, the canonical P5.50 I3.40 F6.44 motif in majority of class A GPCRs26,32 is replaced by G2145.50 L1233.40 S2586.44. In our structure of active FP, G2145.50 is sterically apart from S2586.44 and L1233.40, leading to the lack of the conserved PIF hydrophobic triad, thus indicating that FP employs an activation mechanism not mediated by the traditional PIF motif (Fig. 4b).\nThe receptor activation also accompanies the arrangement of ionic lock (D/E3.49 R3.50 Y3.51, E1323.49 R1333.50 C1343.51 in FP), leading to the broken of the salt bridge between E1323.49 and R1333.50 and the stretching of the R1333.50 side chain towards TM6 and the latter\u2019s outward displacement of 6.7 \u00c5 compared with that of inactive TP (measured at C\u03b1 of residue 6.30). C1343.51 in the ERC motif moves inwards, forming interactions with I2225.58 and T2235.59 in TM5. The importance of motif in FP activation is evidenced by the decreased PGF2\u03b1 activity on FP mutants of E1323.49, R1333.50, and C1343.51 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Intriguingly, unlike its cognate residue R3128.47 in TP, the side chain of R3088.47 in FP undergoes a large-scale upward rotation and forms a hydrogen bond with Q2506.36, which leads to the inward shift of the cytoplasmic end of TM7 and the upshift of H8 (Fig. 4d).

            "text": "The notable outward displacement of TM6 at the cytoplasmic side opens a cavity to accommodate the G\u03b1q subunit. Structural comparisons of FP-Gq with Gq-coupled CCKAR and 5HT2AR reveal a difference in the conformations of TM1, TM6, and G\u03b1q subunits among these GqcoupledGPCR complexes (Fig. 5a). The cytoplasmic end of FP TM1 and TM6 undergoes a remarkably inward displacement relative to CCKAR and 5HT2AR. Consequently, the C-terminus of the \u03b15 helix of the G\u03b1q subunit in the FP-Gq complex rotates toward TM7 and H8 to avoid\nclashes with TM6 and forms extra hydrophobic interactions with side chains of residues inH8, accompaniedby the rotation of the entireG\u03b1q subunit (Fig. 5a). This alteration triggers a 14\u00b0 tilt of the\u03b1Nhelix ofG\u03b1q, bringing it closer to the cytoplasmic end of TM4 in the FP-Gq complex relative to CCKAR-Gq and 5HT2AR-Gq complexes (Fig. 5a). In addition to coupling Gq by interactions with H8 and TM4, the engagement of Gq is also maintained by interactions with FP from TM1, TM2, TM3, TM5, TM4, TM6, ICL1, and ICL2. The side chain of E1323.49 of the E3.49 (D) R3.50C3.51 (Y) motif in TM3 makes a direct hydrogen bond interaction with the side chain of the Y356 of \u03b15 (Fig. 5b, c).\nLike other Gq-coupled GPCR 33, the ICL2 of FP facilitates broad interactions with Gq to stabilize the complex. Typically, ICL2 adopts a helix conformation and inserts into the groove formed by the \u03b1N, \u03b22\u2013\u03b23 loop, and \u03b15 helix of G\u03b1q. Interestingly, we identified several distinct interactions between TM6 and G\u03b1q.

            "text": "Glaucoma is the leading cause of permanent eyesight loss in the world34. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 79.6 million individuals suffered fromglaucoma in2020, and the number of patients may increase to 111.8 million by 204035. Activation of prostaglandin receptors like FP, EP1\u2013EP4, and DP showed anti-glaucoma effects. Research for the discovery of pharmaceutical drugs selectively targeting each of these receptors has been extensively conducted,\nwhereas only FP selective agonists are approved for treatment due to their minimal side-effect profile36. Elucidating the mechanism underlying the functional selectivity of individual FP receptors is of utmost importance for developing new drugs with higher selectivity towards individual prostaglandin receptors to avoid or reduce undesirable side effects.\nIn this study, we present the cryo-EM structures of FP-Gq in complex with its endogenous ligand PGF2\u03b1 as well as two synthetic agonists LTPA and TFPA. Through structure analysis of the PGF2\u03b1\u2013FP\u2013Gq complex, the carboxylate-containing \u03b1-chain that binds to the sub-pocket with highly conserved residues contributes to the majority of the high potency of the receptor. In contrast, the F ring is important for receptor selectivity. Similar to PGE2 to EP3, the hydrophobic \u03c9-chain directly interacts with the toggle switch W2626.48 in FP and forms hydrophobic interactions with a set of hydrophobic residues. The hydroxyl group in the \u03c9-chain of LTPA forms an additional hydrogen bond with S1183.35 in FP in the LTPA-FP-Gq structure, which may be the key to LTPA\u2019s higher selectivity to FP. Despite PGF2\u03b1 containing the hydroxyl group at the same position as LTPA that the presence of the aromatic ring and lack of carbon-to-carbon double bonds in the \u03c9-chain of LTPA may affect the geometry of the ligand,\nFig. 4 | The active structure of the FP. a Superimposition of Gq-coupled FP with theGq-coupled 5-HT2AR complex and antagonist-boundTP (PDB: 6IIU).

Residues are shown in the sticks, with the correspondent cryo-EM density represented in the mesh.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2668 6\nindicating that these modifications in the \u03c9-chain of PGAs may improve their selectivity to FP. Compared with the LTPA, TFPA forms an extra hydrogen bond to N842.57 in FP with a fluoride group in the \u03c9 chain. EP3 harbors a similar polar uncharged residue, T2.57, which may form a hydrogen bondwith the fluoride group of TFPA. AlthoughTFPA had a higher affinity for FP than LTPA, its selectivity needs to be further improved. These structures revealed the ligand recognition of FP, which will serve as templates for the rational design of a new generation of potent agonists with desired selectivity profiles.\nThrough structural comparison and mutagenesis studies, we also elucidated the mechanisms of receptor activation and G protein coupling by FP. FP has neither the traditional \u2018PIF\u2019 core triad nor the DRY motif that is commonly involved in the activation of class A GPCRs, instead FP senses ligand binding by the conserved toggle switch W6.48 to tether TM3\u2013TM5\u2013TM6 through a hereby identified LLW core triad consisting of L1233.40, L2135.49. Intriguingly, mutation of the W2626.48 in FP to alanine did not entirely abolish these three agonists induced activation of FP. It is speculated that the\u03c9 chain of PGF2\u03b1, LTPA, or TFPA inW262Amutant still induces the activation of mutated FP because it may point downward in a similar manner to EP2 (Fig. 1e), which naturally lacks W6.48 at the toggle switch residue position37. In the FP receptor, the conserved D/ERY motif is replaced\nby ERC, which only exists in several class A GPCRs, like EP1, IP, and Neurotensin receptor type 2. Interestingly, in the active FP structure, Q2506.36 induces an upswing of the side chain of R3088.47 and forms a hydrogen bond with it that leads to the inward shift of the cytoplasmic end of TM7 and the upshift of H8. R8.47 is particularly conserved in prostaglandin receptors but rarely exists in other class A GPCRs, and Q6.36 only exists in several class A receptors, including EP1, EP3, and FP. All these key residues for activation in FP are harbored by EP1, which also primarily couples with Gq. Thus, this activation mechanism should be applicable to both FP and EP1, which have the same unique residues.\nThe distinct features of the active FP structures also define the way of Gq protein coupling. Specifically, the TM1, ICL1, and TM2 of FP form extensive interactions with Gq, which, to our knowledge, haven\u2019t been shown in any other reported Gq-coupled GPCR structures. These observed characteristics in the FP-Gq complex structures, including the arrangement of the 7TM bundle, the ligand-binding mode, the ligand-induced receptor activation, and the manner of G protein coupling, expand the understanding of lipid recognition and GPCR-Gq coupling mechanism. Collectively, our results reveal conserved and diverse mechanisms of ligand binding, receptor activation, and G protein coupling by FP.\nFig. 5 | FP\u2013Gq coupling. a The structures of Gq-coupled FP, 5-HT2AR (PDB ID: 6WHY), and CCK1R (PDB ID: 7MBY) complexes were superimposed based on TM2, TM3 and TM4, FP is shown in light sea green, 5-HT2AR in blue and CCK1R in yellow.

The global 3D classification was used to separate out 437,740 particles. We then continued the processing in Relion3.0 and refined 437,740 particles, which led to a structure at 3.40\u00c5 global resolution. After CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing, andpostprocessing, then the particleswere reconstituted to a 2.78 \u00c5 structure (Supplementary Fig. 2).\nFor FP\u2013Gq\u2013TFPA complex dataset, 279 aligned micrographs were deleted because of contaminations or bad ice quality. A total of 5,774,308 particles were extracted from the cryo-EMmicrographs and followed by two rounds of reference-free 2D classification, yielding 2,418,674 particles after clearance. The global 3D classification was used to separate out 805,802 particles. Two rounds of mask 3D classification on the receptor part were used to separate out 578,962 particles which resulted in a clearer density of PTGFR.We refined these particles, which led to a structure at 3.35 \u00c5 global resolution. After CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing, and postprocessing, then the particles were reconstituted to a 3.14 \u00c5 structure (Supplementary Fig. 3). We also performed postprocessing of all three final maps with DeepEMhancer42."

All models were fitted into the EM density map using UCSF Chimera45, followed by iterative rounds of manual adjustment and automated rebuilding in COOT46 and PHENIX47, respectively. The model was finalized by rebuilding in ISOLDE48, followed by refinement in PHENIX with torsion-angle restraints to the input model. The final model statistics were validated using Comprehensive validation (cryoEM) in PHENIX47 and provided in Supplementary Table 1. All structural figures were prepared using Chimera45, Chimera X49, and PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.).\nInositol phosphate accumulation assay IP-One production was measured using the IP-One HTRF kit (Cisbio)50.
