1. **Investigate the use of different surrogate metrics for searching the adaptive weights of the multiple pre-training tasks.** The current work uses the total energy of the molecule as the surrogate metric, but other metrics could also be explored, such as the mean absolute error of the predicted properties or the correlation between the predicted and true properties.


2. **Explore the use of different backbone architectures for the pre-trained model.** The current work uses a hybrid Graph Transformer architecture, but other architectures could also be explored, such as pure Graph Neural Networks or pure Transformer architectures.


3. **Investigate the use of different pre-training datasets.** The current work uses three datasets with 3D geometry for pre-training, but other datasets could also be explored, such as datasets with different sizes, different types of molecules, or different levels of noise.


4. **Apply the proposed method to other molecular property prediction tasks.** The current work focuses on quantum chemistry properties, but the method could also be applied to other molecular property prediction tasks, such as drug-target interaction prediction, toxicity prediction, or solubility prediction.


5. **Extend the proposed method to handle molecules with multiple conformations.** The current work assumes that each molecule has a single conformation, but in reality, molecules can exist in multiple conformations. Extending the method to handle molecules with multiple conformations would make it more applicable to real-world scenarios.
