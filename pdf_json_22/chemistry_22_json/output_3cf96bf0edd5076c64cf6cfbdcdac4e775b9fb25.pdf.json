    "abstractText": "Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (Fuzi in Chinese) is a traditional herbal medicine widely used in China and other Asian countries. In clinical practice, it is often used to treat heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and different kinds of pains. Fuzi extract and its active ingredients exert considerable anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects. The main chemical substances of Fuzi include alkaloids, polysaccharides, flavonoids, fatty acids, and sterols. Among of them, alkaloids and polysaccharides are responsible for the anticancer efficacy. Most bioactive alkaloids in Fuzi possess C19 diterpenoid mother nucleus and these natural products show great potential for cancer therapy. Moreover, polysaccharides exert extraordinary tumor-suppressive functions. This review comprehensively summarized the active ingredients, antineoplastic effects, and molecular mechanisms of Fuzi by searching PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and CNKI. The anticancer effects are largely attributed to inducing apoptosis and autophagy, inhibiting proliferation, migration and invasion, regulating body immunity, affecting energy metabolism, as well as reversing multidrug resistance. Meanwhile, several signaling pathways and biological processes are mainly involved, such as NF\u03baB, EMT, HIF-1, p38 MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and TCA cycle. Collectively, alkaloids and polysaccharides in Fuzi might serve as attractive therapeutic candidates for the development of anticancer drugs. This review would lay a foundation and provide a basis for further basic research and clinical application of Fuzi.",

In clinical practice, it is often used to treat heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and different kinds of pains. Fuzi extract and its active ingredients exert considerable anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects. The main chemical substances of Fuzi include alkaloids, polysaccharides, flavonoids, fatty acids, and sterols. Among of them, alkaloids and polysaccharides are responsible for the anticancer efficacy. Most bioactive alkaloids in Fuzi possess C19 diterpenoid mother nucleus and these natural products show great potential for cancer therapy. Moreover, polysaccharides exert extraordinary tumor-suppressive functions. This review comprehensively summarized the active ingredients, antineoplastic effects, and molecular mechanisms of Fuzi by searching PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and CNKI. The anticancer effects are largely attributed to inducing apoptosis and autophagy, inhibiting proliferation, migration and invasion, regulating body immunity, affecting energy metabolism, as well as reversing multidrug resistance. Meanwhile, several signaling pathways and biological processes are mainly involved, such as NF\u03baB, EMT, HIF-1, p38 MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and TCA cycle. Collectively, alkaloids and polysaccharides in Fuzi might serve as attractive therapeutic candidates for the development of anticancer drugs. This review would lay a foundation and provide a basis for further basic research and clinical application of Fuzi.\nKeywords: Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata, Fuzi, alkaloid, polysaccharide, anticancer, mechanism\nINTRODUCTION\nWith the incidence increasing year by year, malignant tumor has become one of the main factors that jeopardize human health. Currently, researchers are working on pathophysiology of cancer and seeking effective treatments, intending to continuously advance the progress of cancer therapy (Bray et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018). Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are common methods to treat cancer. However, these treatments are often accompaniedwith adverse reactions and complications, such as fatigue, nausea, and pain. In addition, some commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs also have drug resistance, which hinders the treatment process (Gainor et al., 2016; Gainor et al., 2017). For the past few years, natural compounds extracted from plants have become more and more popular owing to their excellent\nEdited by: Linlin Lu,\nGuangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, China\nReviewed by: Mansi Wu,\nJinan University, China Wei Huang,\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical\nCollege, China\n*Correspondence: Wen Zhang\nwenzhang@njucm.edu.cn Liuqing Di\ndiliuqing@njucm.edu.cn\n\u2020These authors have contributed equally to this work and share first\nauthorship\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nEthnopharmacology, a section of the journal\nFrontiers in Pharmacology\nReceived: 06 February 2022 Accepted: 18 March 2022 Published: 18 May 2022\nCitation:"

Many researchers are also committed to exploring natural compounds with anticancer activity as substitutes for chemotherapy (Guo et al., 2019; Rashid et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021).\nFuzi is the processed product of the daughter root of Aconitum carmichaeli Debx, which has hot-natured and pungent in flavor recorded in Shennong\u2019s Classic of Materia Medica firstly. Fuzi has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China for centuries and offers therapeutic potential for heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, gastroenteritis, depression, and other diseases (Wu et al., 2018; Meng-Qi Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). Constituents such as alkaloids, polysaccharides, flavonoids, fatty acids, ceramides, and trace elements are the material basis for Fuzi to exert a variety of functions (Wu et al., 2014). Studies indicated that alkaloids and polysaccharides in Fuzi possessed anticancer activity, which could availably induce tumor cell apoptosis, restrain cell proliferation, and regulate immunity. In addition, other compounds such as deltoin, sitosterol, neokadsuranic acid B, and 11,14-eicosadienoic acid were speculated to possess the potential to target PI3K/AKT pathway for anticancer effects under the prediction of network pharmacology and molecular docking (Xin Yang et al., 2019). In view of this, Fuzi alkaloids and polysaccharides have sparked increasing interest in the application of cancer therapy. A comprehensive perception of anticancer mechanisms is a prerequisite to the design of rational therapeutics. Therefore, the mechanisms account for the anticancer efficacies on Fuzi alkaloids and polysaccharides are required to be discussed and concluded. This review would provide a new recognition of Fuzi in treating cancer and be of great significance for guiding clinical medication and developing novel antineoplastic drugs."

Apart from the bioactivity, these compounds are also poisonous, which lead to cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Three main C19-diester-diterpenoid alkaloids (DDAs) were responsible for the toxicity of Fuzi, namely, aconitine, mesaconitine, and hypaconitine. Studies have shown that the median lethal dose (LD50) of single-dose oral aconitine in mice is 1.0\u20131.8 mg/kg, while the LD50 of mesaconitine and hypaconitine are 1.9 and 5.8 mg/kg, respectively. The dose\u2013effect relationship of DDAs on clinical therapy remains to be further studied (Wada et al., 2005; Singhuber et al., 2009). So far, nearly 80 kinds of C19 diterpenoid alkaloids have been extracted (Tang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020). The mother nucleus of C19 diterpenoid alkaloids is shown in Figure 2, and natural C19 diterpenoid alkaloids with anticancer activity are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the common ingredients of Fuzi, such as aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, benzoylaconitine, and neoline, have been proved to exhibit anticancer functions. Furthermore, the derivatives of C19 diterpenoid alkaloids could also repress the growth of tumor cells (Ren et al., 2017). The antiproliferative effects of C19 diterpene alkaloids and their derivatives on different tumor cell lines are summarized in Table 2. Among the tested cells, the HepG2 cells were highly sensitive to C19 diterpenoid alkaloids as well as their derivatives. By analyzing the structure\u2013activity relationship, it was found that the alkaloids with stronger cytotoxicity, such as aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, crassicauline A, oxonitine, and dexyaconitine, were associated with the acetoxy group (OAc) on the substituent of R6, suggesting that the positions and species of substituents on the mother nucleus were closely related to the antitumor activity of C19 diterpenoid alkaloid."

The results revealed that most derivatives exhibited considerable cytotoxic effects (Table 3). Malignant glioma A172 cells and lung cancer A549 cells were highly sensitive to most of C20 diterpenoid alkaloid derivatives.

The process of apoptosis is actually a cascade amplification process of irreversible hydrolysis of substrate by cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (caspase) (McIlwain et al., 2015), which could be divided into two major\ncategories (intrinsic pathway and extrinsic pathway) (Carneiro and El-Deiry, 2020). As a lysosome degradation pathway with the function of nutritional circulation and metabolic adaptation, autophagy is considered to be involved in the regulation of cancer (Amaravadi et al., 2019). In many cases, autophagy is closely related to apoptosis, and autophagy-related genes are also involved in the process of apoptosis (Maheswari et al., 2018).

There is usually an increase in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability in the last step of apoptosis, accompanied by the release of cytochrome C (Cyto C) (Jin and El-Deiry, 2005; Kalkavan and Green, 2018). Mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway (intrinsic pathway) is usually accompanied by changes in Bax, Bcl-2, Cyto C, ROS, caspase-3, etc. Bcl-2 and Bax are antiand pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family respectively, which could affect caspase cascade pathways in apoptosis. Cyto C is a key protein encoded by nuclear genes and its release is regulated by the members of Bcl-2 family (Li et al., 1997; Chao and Korsmeyer, 1998; Martinou and Youle, 2011). Aconitine promoted the release of Cyto C by directly increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria and ultimately induced cell apoptosis. This was demonstrated by the increased expression of caspase-3, caspase-7, Bax/Bcl-2, and PARP in HepG2 cells (Qi et al., 2018). Salsolinol (250 and 500 \u03bcM) caused the release of mitochondrial Cyto C in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. At the same time, increased levels of Bax and decreased Bcl-2 were detected by western blotting analysis (Wanpen et al., 2007).

The activation of the pathway was observed in most kinds of cancers (Yu et al., 2020). The NF-\u03baB pathway was involved in the apoptosis induced by Fuzi alkaloids. With the increment of aconitine, the expression of NF-\u03baB and Bcl-2 decreased gradually, while the protein levels of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, PARP, and Cyto C increased (Ji et al., 2016). The research indicated that inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway initiated the apoptosis program. Therefore, NF-\u03baB might serve as a promising target in cancer therapy.\nEndoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction is to blame for ERdominated apoptosis to a large extent. In cells, protein synthesis, processing, and modification depend heavily on ER. However, under the condition of viral infection and pH imbalance, the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins would cause severe ER stress (ERS) (Hu et al., 2019). The apoptosis induced by C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathway is a critical manner of ERS-mediated apoptosis, which is mainly regulated by kinase and transcription factors such as PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) (Oyadomari and Mori, 2004; Tabas and\nRon, 2011; Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2013). The triggering of CHOP pathway is closely associated with mitochondriamediated apoptosis, including increasing the expression of Bim and decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 (Hu et al., 2019). It was found that aconitine and quercetin increased apoptosis in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. The two components synergistically activated the glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a maker of ERS, eventually inducing ERS-mediated apoptosis by upregulating the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP pathway (Li et al., 2018)."

Aconitine upregulated the expression of DR5 and TNF-R1 by targeting the p38 MAPK, accordingly activating Bax in A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, revealing that aconitine exerted the anticancer effects through the death receptormediated apoptosis (Fan et al., 2016). Studies showed that p53 gene could induce apoptosis, regulate cell cycle, and repair DNA damage (Zhao et al., 2021). It is noteworthy that p53 could directly participate in the transcription and regulation of death receptors, such as Fas and DR5 (El-Deiry, 1998). Mesaconitine induced apoptosis of leukemia daunorubicin-resistant cells, whose mechanism might be related to the upregulation of p53 and caspase-3 (Guan et al., 2017). S180 sarcoma and H22 liver cancer mice experiments showed that both crude and acidic FPS inhibited neoplasm tissues growth significantly. Further research revealed that the two FPS increased tumor cell apoptosis by upregulating the expression of p53 and Fas (Dong et al., 2003a)."

Autophagy would be triggered in states of excessive hunger,\nnutritional deficiency, oxidative stress, etc. (Amaravadi et al., 2016). Beclin-1 is a critical regulator of autophagy, which mainly participates in the formation of autophagosomes and could be blocked by Bcl-2 (Mari\u00f1o et al., 2014). Studies indicated that oncogenic proteins inhibited the occurrence of autophagy. On the contrary, oncosuppressor proteins could activate autophagy (Galluzzi et al., 2015). The process of autophagy was initiated by the phosphorylated Beclin-1 gene, and then gene LC3 would be transformed into the membrane type LC3-II, eventually substrate p62 protein would be degraded (Onorati et al., 2018; Levine and Kroemer, 2019). It was reported that benzoylaconitine induced autophagy and apoptosis of human lung cancer A549 cells by upregulating Beclin-1, LC3-\u2161, Bax, and caspase-3, meanwhile downregulating p62 and Bcl-2 (Shao et al., 2019).

Evidence was provided that p38 MAPK played a pivotal part in the occurrence and progression of cancer. Aconitine could significantly reduce the phosphorylation of p38, MAPKAPK, and HSP27 in liver cancer cells, indicating that aconitine suppressed the\nproliferation of MHCC97 cells by restraining the activation of p38 MAPK pathway (Xiong et al., 2018)."

Hypaconitine could significantly suppress TGF-\u03b21induced EMT in lung cancer A549 cells. Further investigation verified that hypaconitine attenuated nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and reduced the expression of Snail, which showed a similar inhibitory effect on the NF-\u03baB inhibitor. In the meantime, a significant decrease was observed in cell adhesion, invasion, and migration (Feng et al., 2017).

The malignancy of tumor-bearing mice decreased along with a reduced expression of \u03b23GnT8 and polylactosamine in liver cancer SK-HEP-1 cells after treatment with FPS, indicating that FPS inhibited the migration and invasion through downregulating \u03b23GnT8 (Gao et al., 2016)."

MMP-2 andMMP14, two members in the MMPs family, could degrade ECM, promote vascular proliferation, enhance cell migration and invasion, and are considered potential biomarkers of certain cancers (Alaseem et al., 2019; Karamanou et al., 2020). FPS reduced the tumor weight and blocked the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-14 in mice transplanted with gastric cancer, suggesting that FPS exerted anticancer effect by downregulating MMP-2 and MMP-14 (An et al., 2019).\nThe involved mechanisms of inducing apoptosis and autophagy, inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through different molecular pathways by Fuzi alkaloids and FPS are illustrated in Figure 5.\nRegulate Immunity The immune escape of tumor refers to the phenomenon that tumor cells escape the recognition and attack of immune system through a variety of mechanisms, so as to survive and proliferate in the body. Some cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and IL-12, are able to enhance immune response. In contrast, regulatory T cells (Tregs) could rapidly detect and inhibit IL-2 or other cytokines in the early stage of the immune response to suppress autoimmunity, which might hinder the anticancer immunity (Wing et al., 2019). Therefore, inhibiting the production of Tregs is one of the methods of anticancer immunotherapy. Fuzi aqueous extract has been proved to enhance the anticancer effect of radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer. The experimental data indicated that ionizing radiation affected the anticancer immune response of mice. However, after the administration of Fuzi aqueous extract, the levels of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12 in mice serum increased, which might arouse the immune response. Moreover, Fuzi aqueous extract reduced the radiation-induced production of IL-10, TGF\u03b2, and Tregs, revealing the mechanism of Fuzi in modulating immunity and inhibiting tumor growth (Zhang et al., 2017). Another research showed that, in gastric cancer-bearing mice, aconitine was involved in the intervention of Tregs by regulating the prostaglandin E2/cyclooxygenase-2 (PGE2/COX-2) pathway. It was noteworthy that high-dose aconitine reduced PGE2 and Tregs significantly, whose effect was more obvious than that of the celecoxib-positive group. These results suggested that aconitine exerted antitumor efficacy by reversing immune escape through regulating Tregs and mediating the PGE2/ COX-2 pathway (Cheng, 2019).\nCancer immunotherapy aims to promote tumor-specific T-cell response. As antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells (DC) allow antigens to be recognized by CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, and then CD4+ T cells transmit information to CD8+ T cells and facilitate the differentiation of effector T cells to kill tumor cells (Borst et al., 2018). Aconitine possessed a direct anticancer activity, but it also had the drawback of damaging immunity to a certain extent (Qian, 2015). FPS increased the number of macrophages, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the spleen of Hepa1-6 tumor-bearing mice, indicating FPS had immuneimproving functions. The results suggested that FPS combined with Fuzi alkaloids might achieve better anticancer efficacy (Qian, 2015). Treatment with FPS induced differentiation of peripheral\nblood monocytes to DC and expressed its mature phenotypes, which acted as the second signal to activate T lymphocytes and stimulated tumor immunity (Gao L. L. et al., 2012). The synergic effect of FPS and adriamycin was evaluated in H22 tumor-bearing mice. The killing activity of NK cells and lymphocyte transformation rate were dramatically improved; meanwhile the expression of IL-2 and IL-12 in splenic lymphocytes increased, indicating that FPS enhanced the anticancer effect of adriamycin by strengthening the immune system (Dong et al., 2003b; Dong et al., 2006). The anticancer immunomodulatory mechanism of Fuzi is shown in Figure 6."

            "heading": "Affect Energy Metabolism",
            "text": "The abnormal energy metabolism is one of the major characteristics of tumor cells (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). The main sources of biological energy depend on central carbon metabolism, including aerobic respiration and glycolysis. In the presence of adequate oxygen, pyruvate, transformed from glucose, is further oxidatively phosphorylated by mitochondrial respiration. However, under hypoxic conditions, pyruvate would be reduced to lactate. Tumor cells tend to obtain ATP through glycolysis even under aerobic conditions, this phenomenon is called Warburg effect (Warburg et al., 1927). PI3K/AKT/mTOR and HIF-1 pathways would influence glycolysis and participate in the energy metabolism of tumor cells. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway could activate glucose transporters on cell membrane and the metabolic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) in glycolysis, sequentially increase glucose uptake and glycolysis rate (Gottlob et al., 2001; Roberts et al., 2013; Abdel-Wahab et al., 2019). The HIF-1\u03b1 could induce the activation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) to catalyze the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, accordingly promote glycolysis to produce ATP in the anoxic tumor microenvironment (Valvona et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018; Nagao et al., 2019).\nMitochondria are the most important organelle of energy metabolism. Besides supplying energy for life, mitochondria also regulate cell death, control redox reactions, and provide substrates for anabolism (Porporato et al., 2018). Angiogenesis in the center of many solid tumors is poor, resulting in limited supply of glucose and oxygen. However, electron transport chain (ETC) in the mitochondria could function even under hypoxia, allowing the tumor cells to breathe and produce ATP (Vasan et al., 2020). Complex I, II, III, and IV, located on the mitochondrial inner membrane, are key components of ETC to transfer electrons. Complex I and II respectively oxidize the NADH and FADH2 to NAD + (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD+ (flavin adenine dinucleotide), which keep TCA cycle running. Complex I, II, III, and IV transfer electrons to oxygen, discharge protons into the gap of mitochondrial membrane, and eventually generate ATP by ATP synthase (Letts and Sazanov, 2017). Regulation of cellular metabolism might be a significant clue in developing antineoplastic agents (Stuart et al., 2014; Wheaton et al., 2014; Kuntz et al., 2017). Figure 7 shows glycolysis, TCA cycle, and relevant pathways involved in cellular energy metabolism.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 87028211\nExisting studies found that Fuzi alkaloids regulated cellular metabolism by affecting ETC in the mitochondria. Salsolinol blocked the energy supply of SH-SY5Y cells and induced cell death. It was noteworthy that adding D-glucose to enhance glycolysis could not prevent the cytotoxicity of salsolinol on SH-SY5Y cells. Further research demonstrated that salsolinol inhibited the activity of complex II (succinate-Q reductase) and caused a rapid depletion in intracellular ATP, which might account for the cytotoxic effects of salsolinol (Storch et al., 2000). Moreover, network pharmacology predicted that Fuzi alkaloids might exert antitumor effects by suppressing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, HIF-1 pathway, and central carbon metabolism in cancer (Lu et al., 2021) (Figure 7). The evidence proved that energy metabolism and its relevant signal pathways might be involved in the anticancer process of Fuzi alkaloids."

These transporters protect cancer cells from high doses of intracellular drugs and lead to the occurrence of MDR (Bukowski et al., 2020). Many inhibitors, such as verapamil and cyclosporine A, are designed to target P-gp. However, due to the low affinity of these inhibitors to P-gp, high concentrations are required and side effects would ensue (H\u00f6llt et al., 1992; List et al., 2001; Waghray and Zhang, 2018).

Several signaling pathways and biological processes were involved in these pharmacological functions, such as NF-\u03baB, EMT, HIF-1, p38 MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and TCA cycle. The anticancer molecular mechanism of Fuzi alkaloids and polysaccharides concluded in this review could lay a foundation for further basic research and clinical application.\nOutstanding achievements have been obtained in the anticancer chemical elements and pharmacological mechanism of Fuzi. Nevertheless, there are some deficiencies in current research. Nowadays, researchers focus on alkaloid monomers, crude polysaccharide or Fuzi extract. Other constituents such as flavonoids, ceramides and fatty acids are seldomly investigated about their anticancer activity. According to the characteristics of multi-components and multi-targets of TCM, the combination efficacy and network regulation mechanism of bioactive constituents in Fuzi remain to be further studied. With the applications of diversified techniques, specific mechanisms such as drug ligand-receptor interactions and conformational changes of targets are expected to be clarified.
