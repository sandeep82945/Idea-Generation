    "abstractText": "Cardiorespiratory fitness has been substantially associated with health status. However, longitudinal studies on cardiorespiratory fitness and ideal cardiovascular health behavior (ICHB) in adolescents are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal association between ICHB (at baseline) and cardiorespiratory fitness (at follow-up). This is a 2-year prospective analysis of 445 adolescents (232 girls) aged 12\u201318 years. The ICHB was developed by the American Heart Association as meeting the ideal health behaviors for a healthy diet, physical activity, smoking status, and body mass index. ANCOVAS adjusted by age, sex, pubertal stage, socioeconomic status, and cardiorespiratory fitness showed that the higher the number of ICHB metrics accumulated at baseline (from 1 to 4), the higher the cardiorespiratory fitness levels over a 2-year period (p = 0.038). In logistic regressions, after adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratios for having high cardiorespiratory fitness at follow-up was 4.9 (95% CI, 1.2\u201320.1, p = 0.02) for those who accumulated all four metrics of ICHB, when compared to those with 1 or less metrics of ICHB. In addition, the higher the number of ICHB metrics accumulated, the higher the likelihood of having a high cardiorespiratory fitness level over a 2-year period (p for trend = 0.01). Conclusion: We identified a significant association between ICBH and cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescents. Therefore, improving ICBH in adolescence is likely to benefit the cardiorespiratory fitness.",

Recent research even indicates the possible immunoprotective role of cardiorespiratory fitness against SARS-CoV-2 [6], and highlights the importance of increasing cardiorespiratory fitness in the general population to booster resilience to COVID-19 and other possible pandemics in the future [7]. Due to its diagnostic and prognostic value, Communicated by Gregorio Paolo Milani. * C\u00e9sar Agostinis-Sobrinho cesaragostinis@hotmail.com\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n1 3\ncardiorespiratory fitness is considered an essential marker in routine health assessment [1, 8] for chronic disease prevention [3]. In youth, cardiorespiratory fitness is an important predictor of not only physical health [4, 9\u201316], but also mental health [17, 18], and increases academic achievement [19\u201322]. Higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 23], improved metabolic health [11, 13, 24], and type 2 diabetes, and adds to better lung function [15, 25] and health-related quality of life [26], in adolescents. It has also been shown that cardiorespiratory fitness, in adolescence, is an indicator of higher burden of future disability [27].\nPrevious research has analyzed individual associations between different cardiovascular health behaviors and cardiorespiratory fitness. Significant associations were found between eating habits [28], smoking [29], body mass index (BMI) [30, 31], and cardiorespiratory fitness level in teens. However, longitudinal data covering all four cardiovascular health behaviors in combination (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, diet) in adolescence is scarce. Indeed, studies targeting all four cardiovascular health behaviors (not only physical activity) in young age may contribute to health benefits through improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness. In this context, the aim of this study is to verify the association between accumulation of ideal cardiovascular health behavior (at baseline) and cardiorespiratory fitness at 2-year follow-up."

A more detailed discussion of sample and recruiting methodologies, processes, and protocols may be found elsewhere [19, 31]. In brief, baseline data for 1229 adolescents aged 12 to 18\u00a0years were collected in 2011, and 1011 and 789 patients were reevaluated 1 (follow-up 1) and 2\u00a0years later (follow-up 2), respectively. Considering potential refusals to participate in the study due to blood analysis or accelerometer use for 1\u00a0week, a \u201clayered consent\u201d was permitted. This allowed participants to consent some parts of the study protocol and not others. For example, an adolescent could perform physical fitness assessments and refuse to undergo blood analysis or accelerometer use. The present analysis consists of 445 adolescents who consented to use the accelerometers and undergo blood analysis. Therefore, at baseline and the\n2nd follow-up, 445 adolescents aged 12 to 18\u00a0years (232 females) had complete data on the variables of interest for the current study. When compared to the initial sample (n = 1229 vs n = 445), the participants included in the current analysis were similar in terms of age (14.1 \u00b1 1.6 vs 13.8 \u00b1 1.6), body mass index (21 \u00b1 3.8 vs 20.9 \u00b1 3.5), cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak mL/kg/min) (42.3 \u00b1 6.8 vs 42.1 \u00b1 6.9), KIDMED score (7.1 \u00b1 2 vs 7.2 \u00b1 2.1), and for non-smokers (90% vs 93%).\nPower analysis was calculated post hoc, for multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), assuming a power of 80%, an effect size of 0.02, at two-sided 0.05 level.\nThe study was carried out in accordance with the World Medical Association\u2019s Helsinki Declaration for Human Studies. The study was approved by the Portuguese Data Protection Authority (#1,112,434/2011), the Portuguese Ministry of Science and Education (0,246,200,001/2011), and the Faculty of Sport at the University of Porto.

            "text": "Our study showed that the accumulation of cardiovascular health behavior metrics was associated with cardiorespiratory fitness at 2-year follow-up.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the longitudinal association between ICBH (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, diet) and cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescents. Adolescence is a critical period of human development characterized by profound physiological changes, and adherence to healthy habits is particularly relevant at this stage of life, since these may influence essential indicators linked to future health outcomes, such as cardiorespiratory fitness. Indeed, cardiorespiratory fitness is considered a critical hallmark for health during youth, and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) a good indicator for it [39].\nIn addition, our results show that as increase the number of ICHB metrics as higher the cardiorespiratory fitness levels over 2\u00a0years. Moreover, those adolescents who had\n1 3\nat least 3 or 4 ICHB were significantly different from all others groups (from 1 to 4). Our findings are in line with Ruiz and colleagues who reported a cross-sectional associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and ICHB among European children and adolescents [40]. However, we have extended those results by involving a longitudinal cohort and our results highlight that meeting the ICHB metrics seems important for healthy cardiorespiratory fitness levels 2\u00a0years later, in adolescents. In adolescence, ICHB (smoking, BMI, physical activity, and diet) is associated with both mental and physical well-being which leads to an active and healthy lifestyle, reduce the prevalence of mental illnesses [17, 18], and display prognostic ability for all-cause and disease-specific mortality outcomes in adulthood [41]. Despite the fact that our results will need to be confirmed or ruled out by future studies with adolescents, it seems important that ICHB associated with cardiorespiratory fitness at 2-year follow-up, given that it has been shown that adolescence with higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness tend to perceive their health as\nbetter in terms of physical functioning, emotional wellbeing, self-esteem, and social and family functioning [42]. Another large population-based prospective study showed the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence in the prevention of future neurotic disorders [17]. Increasing cardiorespiratory fitness is not only beneficial to adolescents\u2019 mental well-being [18], but also with academic achievement [20, 43]. The effect of how each ICHB component may affect cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescents is not well established. But, it is known that diet [43], physical activity [44], smoke, and obesity [45] have been individually associated with cardiorespiratory fitness.\nA recent study showed gender differences in the prevalence of each component of the ICHB [46] and we observed similar trend in our research; we found girls engaged in less ideal physical activity than boys, but have often a healthy diet. Adolescent boys smoking prevalence is usually greater in other adolescent groups [47], which is in line with our results were. Gender plays a significant role in health behaviors throughout the lifespan [48]. During the socialization\n1 3\nprocess, boys are encouraged to be more active than girls [48], whereas among girls, body image dissatisfaction has been associated with healthier eating choices [49]. Important to mention, that our longitudinal analysis were adjusted for potential confounds such as sex, age, pubertal stage and socioeconomic status.\nWithout an ideal level of cardiovascular health behaviors during adolescence, a significant health benefit is lost, which may result in unacceptably high rates of adult-onset CVD [50]. However, early intervention and prevention actions targeting adolescent ideal cardiorespiratory fitness level have been associated with the maintenance of health parameters in later life [51]. Our findings highlight the need to promote healthy behaviors altogether in order to attained healthy cardiorespiratory fitness levels, in adolescents.\nThis study has several strengths. First, our research includes four main components of ICHB such as smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, diet and not only discusses the relationship between single component with cardiorespiratory fitness, but also integrates each component to show its relationship more intuitively by using the form of standardized scores. Second, by analyzing a longitudinal cohort we highlight that meeting all the four metrics of ICHB was important for cardiorespiratory fitness 2\u00a0years later in adolescents. And finally, the fact that we used objective measures of physical activity and a validated fitness test should also be considered a strength of this study. This study is not without limitations. Firstly, the results are not generalizable due to the sample not being nationally representative. Secondly, the ICHB was assed only in baseline; hence longitudinal research in adolescents is needed verify the changes in ICHB and its effects. Lastly, it should also be noted that the formation of the ICHB metrics relies on the use of binary variables and on the assumption that all components contained in this score contribute in the same way to the final index.\nIn summary, we identified a significant association between ICBH at baseline and cardiorespiratory fitness over 2\u00a0years in adolescents. Therefore, improving ICBH in adolescence is likely to benefit the cardiorespiratory fitness.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions C\u00e9sar Agostinis-Sobrinho and Rute Santos designed and carried out the initial analyses, drafted the initial manuscript, and participated in data collection, participated in the study design, interpretation of data and revised the manuscript; Luis Lopes and Carla Moreira participated in the study design, reviewed and data interpretation; Justina Kievi\u0161ien\u0117, Viney Prakash Dubey, Sigute Norkiene, and Alona Rauckien\u0117-Michaelsson participated in data interpretation and reviewed the manuscript; and all authors revised and approved the final manuscript as submitted.\nFunding Rute Santos is supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (CEECIND/01069/2017; FCT/UIDB/00617/2020 and ITR\u2014LA/P/0064/2020).
