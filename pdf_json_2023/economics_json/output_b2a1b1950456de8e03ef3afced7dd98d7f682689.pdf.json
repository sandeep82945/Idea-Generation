    "abstractText": "We study a mean field game in continuous time over a finite horizon, T, where the state of each agent is binary andwhere players base their strategic decisions on two, possibly competing, factors: the willingness to align with the majority (conformism) and the aspiration of sticking with the own type (stubbornness). We also consider a quadratic cost related to the rate at which a change in the state happens: changing opinion may be a costly operation. Depending on the parameters of the model, the game may have more than one Nash equilibrium, even though the corresponding N-player game does not. Moreover, it exhibits a very rich phase diagram, where polarized/unpolarized, coherent/incoherent equilibria may coexist, except for T small, where the equilibrium is always unique. We fully describe such phase diagram in closed form and provide a detailed numerical analysis of the N -player counterpart of the mean field game. In this finite dimensional setting, the equilibrium selected by the population of players is always coherent (favoring the subpopulation whose type is aligned with the initial condition), but it does not necessarily minimize the cost functional. Rather, it seems that, among the coherent ones, the equilibrium prevailing is the one that most benefits the underdog subpopulation forced to change opinion. Communicated by Xiaojun Chen.

            "text": "In this paper, we analyze a simple continuous-time dynamic multi-agent model and study the limit as the number of agents goes to infinity. We consider a group of N interacting agents (players), who are allowed to control their binary state choosing the probability rate of \u201cflipping\u201d them. This rate is a feedback control that may depend on the state of all players and (measurably) on time. Each player aims at minimizing an individual cost, which is comprised by a running cost and a final reward. We consider a standard quadratic running cost. At some final time T > 0, each player gets a reward given as the sum of two different terms:\n\u2013 the first mimics a social driver and favors imitation: the player gets a higher reward if she conforms with the majority, and if the majority becomes polarized (close to consensus); the majority is over the whole population, making the interaction between players of mean field type; \u2013 the second models the private (individual) desire to align the state with the sign of a static and predetermined random variable denoting her personal type.\nThese two terms are possibly competing and represent a classical social dilemma: the former mimics conformism, i.e., the adherence to social norms and is often referred to as social utility; the latter models stubbornness, namely, the aspiration of the agent to stay as close as possible to the prescription of personal traits, hencemimicking a private (or individual) utility. As notion of optimality, we adopt that of Nash equilibrium, and our aim is to understand the system\u2019s behavior in the limit as N \u2192 +\u221e. This falls into the realm of mean field games, introduced by J.-M. Lasry and P.-L. Lions and, independently, by M. Huang, R.P. Malham\u00e9 and P.E. Caines (cf. [19, 20]), as limit models for symmetric many player dynamic games as the number of players tends to infinity; see, for instance, the lecture notes [6] and the two-volume work [7]. As concerns the finite state mean field games, we refer the reader to [14, 15].\nThe variable representing the type is introduced in the model as a random field and is treated as an observable static component of player\u2019 state. Therefore, this term introduces random disorder and, to the best of our knowledge, it is one of the first attempts to do it in mean field games.\nIn literature, this dilemma has been analyzed from different perspectives: [5] is usually considered as a pioneering study on the trade-off between private and social drivers in (static) binary choice models. In [4], a generalization to a dynamic continuous-time setting is proposed, which is not a mean field game, as agents play static games at random times. [11] proposes a model of consensus formation similar to our, where only the social component is present and individual preferences are not considered. [2] is one of the rare examples studying the interplay between stubbornness and imitation drivers in the realm of mean field games. However, their mathematical setting\nis rather different from ours: in that paper state variables are real with Gaussian initial distribution; moreover, their linear quadratic optimization problem is solved by affine controls which preserve Gaussianity; as a consequence, their optimal control is always unique. Models close to the one proposed here, but without individual preferences, have also been introduced as examples of non-uniqueness of equilibria in mean field games (see, e.g., [1, 3, 10, 12, 17, 18, 21]). Closed in spirit are also mean field games of interacting rotators [8, 22, 23], which exhibit a synchronization/incoherence phase transition.\nSimilarly to what is contained in the last cited references, the model that we are proposing here has the following remarkable feature: for each N , there is a unique Nash equilibrium for the N -player game; however, the correspondingmean field game may have multiple equilibria. This is reminiscent of a common paradigm in Statistical Physics: finite volumeGibbs states are uniquely defined, but thermodynamic limitmay be non-unique, indicating a phase transition. The analogy with models in Statistical Physics can be carried on further: the model that we propose corresponds to the mean field Ising model (or Curie\u2013Weiss one), when there are no private signals/types, and to the random field Curie\u2013Weiss model, when disorder is introduced. The time horizon T plays a role similar to the inverse temperature in the models cited above: the higher T , the smaller the contribution of the running cost. The N -player game as well as its mean field limit are presented in Sect. 2, following the general theory developed in [10, 14, 15]. In remarkable analogy with the Curie\u2013Weiss model, we show that the mean field game has a unique equilibrium for small T , whereas several equilibria emerge as T increases. For mean field games with multiple equilibria at least four criteria for the selection of a \u201cpreferred\u201d equilibrium have been proposed [12, 18, 21]:\n\u2013 limit of the unique equilibrium of the N -player game, \u2013 minimization of the player cost, \u2013 regularization by vanishing common noise, \u2013 stability for the best response map.\nThese criteria are not equivalent, and we are not aware of general results concerning their relations. We stress that selecting one equilibrium does not imply that the remaining equilibria are meaningless. Indeed, the feedback strategy corresponding to any equilibrium of the mean field game is an \u201capproximate\u201d Nash equilibrium for the N -player game, as shown in [9].\nA detailed study of the different equilibria of the mean field limit is proposed in Sect. 3. In particular, we will see that a number of different types of equilibria can be identified: polarized/unpolarized (related to the size of the majority), coherent/incoherent (alignment of the final population state with the initial state). In Sect. 4, we discuss the selection of the equilibrium obtained by taking the limit of the unique equilibrium of the N -player game. In [10], in the absence of individual preferences and with a much simpler phase diagram, this question was rigorously answered, while a rigorous analysis is presently out of reach here. We, therefore, run numerical simulations to capture this selection. We see that there is, indeed, a unique equilibrium emerging from the N-player approximation: it is always coherent, but it could be polarized or not, depending on some parameters of the model. Notably, the prevailing equilibrium is not necessarily the one that minimizes the aggregate cost suffered by\nthe population of interacting agents. Some remarks about the rationale behind the selection of the equilibrium in the case of a finite population are collected in Sect. 4.2. Section5 contains some concluding remarks. Appendix contains all technical proofs of the results stated in Sect. 3."

            "text": "In this section, we apply the general theory in [15] to study the equilibria of the N -player game and of the mean field game in the specific model we propose.\n2.1 The N-Player Game\nWe consider N players whose binary state vector is denoted by x := (x1, . . . , xN ) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N . To each player is also assigned a variable yi \u2208 {\u2212 , }, where > 0 is a given constant, and we set y := (y1, . . . , yN ); the components of y will be referred to as local fields. The vector state x = x(t) evolves in continuous time, while y is static. Each player is allowed to control her state with a feedback control ui (t, x, y) which may depend on time, and on the values of x and y. We assume each ui , as function of t , to be nonnegative, measurable and locally integrable. Thus, for a given control u = (u1, . . . , uN ), the state of the system, x(t), evolves as a Markov process, whose law is uniquely determined as the solution of the martingale problem for the time-dependent generator\nLt f (x) := N\u2211\ni=1 ui (t, x, y)\n[ f (xi ) \u2212 f (x) ] =: N\u2211\ni=1 ui (t, x, y)\u2207 i f (x),\nwhere xi is the vector state obtained from x by replacing the component xi with \u2212xi . In order to fully define the dynamics, we prescribe the joint distribution of the initial states x(0) and of the local fields y. For simplicity, we assume all these variables are independent: all xi (0) have mean m0 \u2208 [\u22121, 1], whereas all yi have mean 0. Each player aims at minimizing her own cost, depending on the controls of all players, which is given by\nJi (u) := E [ 1\n2\n\u222b T\n0 u2i (t, x(t), y)dt \u2212 xi (T )(mN (T ) + yi )\n] , (1)\nwheremN (t) := 1N \u2211N\ni=1 xi (t) is the mean state of the population. Here, T > 0 is the time horizon of the game. Besides the standard quadratic running cost in the control, two other terms contribute to the cost:\n\u2013 the term\u2212xi (T )mN (T ) favors polarization: each agent profits from being aligned with the majority at the final time T ;\n\u2013 the term \u2212xi (T ) yi incentivizes each agent to align with her own local field. As y is uniformly distributed on {\u2212 , }N , this term inhibits alignment of behaviors, hence polarization.\nFrom a technical viewpoint, we note that, by rescaling time, one could normalize to 1 the time horizon and multiplying by T the reward. Thus, the time horizon T may be seen as tuning the relevance of the final reward as compared to the \u201cnatural inertia\u201d expressed by the running cost.\nGiven a control vector u and a measurable and locally integrable function\n\u03b2 : [0, T ] \u00d7 {\u22121, 1}N \u00d7 {\u2212 , }N \u2192 [0,+\u221e),\nwe define the control vector [ ui , \u03b2 ] by\n[ ui , \u03b2 ]\nj = { u j for j = i \u03b2 for j = i .\nDefinition 2.1 A control vector u is a Nash equilibrium if for each \u03b2 as above,\nJi (u) \u2264 Ji ( [ui , \u03b2] ) , \u2200i = 1, . . . , N .\nNash equilibria may be obtained via the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation (see for details [13])\n{ \u2202vi \u2202t (t, x, y) + \u2211N j=1 a\u2217(\u2207 jv j (t, x, y))\u2207 jvi (t, x, y) + 12a2\u2217(\u2207 ivi (t, x, y)) = 0\nvi (T , x, y) = \u2212xi (mN + yi ), (2)\nwhere \u2207 jv j (t, x, y) = v j (t, x j , y) \u2212 v j (t, x, y), mN = 1N \u2211N i=1 xi , and\na\u2217(p) := argmin a\u22650\n[ ap \u2212 1\n2 a2\n] = p\u2212,\nwith p\u2212 denoting the negative part of p \u2208 R.

As said, m corresponds to a solution of the MFG if and only if it solves such equation. Relying on (11) and (12), the Consistency Equation can be rewritten as\n1 2 sign(m + )\n[ 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 sign(m + )m0) (|m + |T + 1)2 ]\n+1 2 sign(m \u2212 )\n[ 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 sign(m \u2212 )m0) (|m \u2212 |T + 1)2 ] = m. (13)\nSolutions of (13) will be called equilibria. We are now going to identify all such equilibria. Moreover, depending on the values of the parameters of the model, we classify them emphasizing the presence or the absence of two different features:\n\u2013 polarization, which expresses the fact that agent alignment outscores individual preference, namely, |m| > ; \u2013 coherence, which indicates the fact that the majority of the agents aligns with the sign of the initial condition m0.\nWe begin by pointing out a symmetry property: if we denote by F(m, , T ,m0) the l.h.s. of (13), then\nF(\u2212m, , T ,\u2212m0) = F(m, , T ,m0). (14)\nTherefore, without loss of generality, in the remainder of this article we study (13) in the case m0 \u2265 0. We can thus specify precisely four classes of equilibria: \u2013 equilibria m \u2208 ( , 1] will be called polarized coherent; \u2013 equilibria m \u2208 [\u22121,\u2212 ] will be called polarized incoherent; \u2013 equilibria m \u2208 (0, ] will be called unpolarized coherent; \u2013 equilibria m \u2208 [\u2212 , 0] will be called unpolarized incoherent. Before stating the formal results describing in detail all the solutions to (13), we provide a visual example, where all the possible situations are depicted. To this aim, in Fig. 1 we plot the full phase diagram in the parameters , T , having fixed m0 = 0.25. The right picture is a zoom of the region within the dashed lines. We can identify nine regions, each of them corresponding to a specific typology of solutions to (13). For example, region 1, characterized by an intermediate value of T and small, shows the presence of three equilibria, one polarized/coherent, one polarized/incoherent, and one unpolarized/incoherent.\nIn Table 1, we summarize the results in terms of number of equilibria and their typology for all the regions on the phase diagram as depicted in Fig. 1. We note that in regions 6 and 9, for T small, there is a unique equilibrium which is always coherent, and it is polarized in 6, for small, whereas it is unpolarized in 9, for large. On the opposite, in zones 2, 3 and 4, for T large, there are five equilibria, and three of them are always coherent. Finally, in zones 1, 5, 7 and 8 (for T intermediate), there are three equilibria. In this situation, we see two different zones: in regions 1 and 5 (for small), only one equilibrium is coherent; in regions 7 and 8 (for large), they are all coherent.\nNote that the way the number of equilibria depends of the parameters and T is far from obvious. For instance, fixing 0.5, the number of equilibria is not monotonic in T . Similarly, fixing T 3, there is no monotonicity in .\nIn the remainder of this section, we state the results describing the phase diagram, specifying at what times the phase transitions occur. This will also serve to specify the algebraic form of all the curves separating the regions depicted in Fig. 1.

Proposition 3.4 (Unpolarized incoherent equilibria: \u2212 \u2264 m < 0) (i) Suppose \u2265 1\u2212m02 . Then, there is no equilibrium in [\u2212 , 0), \u2200T > 0, [reg. 9, 6,\n7, 8, 5, 3, 4].

Then,\n\u2013 for T \u2264 T \u2217( ,\u2212m0), there is no equilibrium in (\u2212 , 0) and m = \u2212 is an equilibrium if and only if T = T \u2217( ,\u2212m0), [regions 9, 6, 5, 3]; \u2013 for T > T \u2217( ,\u2212m0), there is a unique equilibrium in [\u2212 , 0), [regions 1, 2].\n4 The N-Player Game: HJB and Numerical Results\nIn this section, we provide a different glance to the problem and consider again the representative agent in a setting where she is best responding to a population of N opponents (note that, in doing this, the population is thus formed by N + 1 players). We now derive a new large dimensional HJB equation used to run simulations of a finite population in order to identify the emerging (unique) equilibrium in the finite dimensionalmodel. This approach is inspired by [17, 18].Different numericalmethods for finite state N -player games are developed in [16].\nAll parameters and variables are as described in the previous sections. Recall that each agent j is characterized by a predetermined local field y j \u2208 {\u2212 , }, where \u2208 [0, 1] and by a time-varying state variable x j (t) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. We take agent i playing the role of the representative agent. Concerning the remaining population of N players, we introduce two summary statistics as the number of \u201cones\u201d in the two subpopulations with different local fields (i.e., different ). To this aim, we define\nn+N = \u2211\nj =i I{x j=1}I{y j= }; n\u2212N =\n\u2211 j =i I{x j=1}I{y j=\u2212 }; n N = \u2211 j =i I{y j= }.\nNote that n N is a static variable, whereas n + N and n \u2212 N change in time and take values, respectively, in {0, 1, . . . , n N } and {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 n N }. By taking advantage of the symmetries of the model, we search equilibrium controls that, for the representative player i , are feedback depending on the state xi , on the local field yi and on the aggregate variables n+N , n \u2212 N and n N , and symmetrically for all other players.We denote by \u03b1(xi , yi , n+, n\u2212, n , t) the feedback control strategy of player i , while each other player j = i uses the feedback control\n\u03b2(x j , y j , n + \u2212 I{x j=1}I{y j= } + I{xi=1}I{yi= }, n\u2212 \u2212 I{x j=1}I{y j=\u2212 } + I{xi=1}I{yi=\u2212 }, n \u2212 I{y j= } + I{yi= }, t),\nwhere, for instance, we have used the fact that\nn+ \u2212 I{x j=1}I{y j= } + I{xi=1}I{yi= } = \u2211\nk = j I{xk=1}I{yk= }.\nUnder these assumptions, the triple (xi , n+, n\u2212) is a sufficient statistics, in the sense that its time evolution is Markovian, with transition rates:\n(x, n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (\u2212x, n+, n\u2212) with rate u(t) = \u03b1(x, y, n+, n\u2212, n , t); (x, n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (x, n+ + 1, n\u2212) with rate \u03b3 +(x, n+, n\u2212, n , t)\n= ( n \u2212 n+ ) \u00b7 \u03b2 ( \u2212 1,+ , n++ I{x=1}, n\u2212, n , t ) ;\n(x, n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (x, n+ \u2212 1, n\u2212) with rate \u03b4+(x, n+, n\u2212, n , t) = n+ \u00b7 \u03b2 ( 1,+ , n+\u2212 I{x=\u22121}, n\u2212, n , t ) ; (x, n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (x, n+, n\u2212 + 1) with rate \u03b3 \u2212(x, n+, n\u2212, n , t) = ( N \u2212 n \u2212 n\u2212 ) \u00b7 \u03b2 ( \u2212 1,\u2212 , n+, n\u2212+ I{x=1}, n , t ) ; (x, n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (x, n+, n\u2212 \u2212 1) with rate \u03b4\u2212(x, n+, n\u2212, n , t) = n\u2212 \u00b7 \u03b2 ( 1,\u2212 , n+, n\u2212\u2212 I){x = \u22121}, t ) .\nThis allows a considerable reduction in the cardinality of the state space, from 2N+1 to O(N 2). The best response u(t) = \u03b1(x(t), y, n+(t), n\u2212(t), n , t) for player i is the one minimizing the cost\nE\n[\u222b T\n0\nu2(t)\n2 dt \u2212 x(T ) (mN+1(T ) + y)\n] ,\nwith\nmN+1(T ) = 2 (n +(t) + n\u2212(t)) + I{x=1}\nN + 1 \u2212 1.\nBy Dynamic Programming, the Value Function for this stochastic optimal control problem solves\n\u2202V\n\u2202t + min u\n[ u2\n2 + u\u2207x V + \u03b3 +\u2207+\u03b3 V + \u03b4+\u2207+\u03b4 V + \u03b3 \u2212\u2207\u2212\u03b3 V + \u03b4\u2212\u2207\u2212\u03b4 V\n] = 0\nV (x, y, n+, n\u2212, T ) = \u2212x ( 2(n+ + n\u2212 + I{x=1}) N + 1 \u2212 1 ) .\nThe minimization over u leads to the optimal feedback\n\u03b1\u2217(x, y, n+, n\u2212, t) = [V (\u2212x, y, n+, n\u2212, t) \u2212 V (x, y, n+, n\u2212, t)]\u2212 (16)\nand, finally, to the HJB equation\nV\u0307 = 1 2\n([ V (\u2212x, y, n+, n\u2212, t) \u2212 V (x, y, n+, n\u2212, t)]\u2212 )2\n\u2212 \u03b3 +(x, n+, n\u2212, t) \u00b7 [V (x,+ , n+ + 1, n\u2212, t) \u2212 V (x,+ , n+, n\u2212, t)] \u2212 \u03b4+(x, n+, n\u2212, t) \u00b7 [V (x,+ , n+ \u2212 1, n\u2212, t) \u2212 V (x,+ , n+, n\u2212, t)] \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212(x, n+, n\u2212, t) \u00b7 [V (x,\u2212 , n+, n\u2212 + 1, t) \u2212 V (x,\u2212 , n+, n\u2212, t)] \u2212 \u03b4\u2212(x, n+, n\u2212, t) \u00b7 [V (x,\u2212 , n+, n\u2212 \u2212 1, t) \u2212 V (x,\u2212 , n+, n\u2212, t)]. (17)\nThe unique Nash equilibrium of the game is obtained by setting \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b1\u2217, under which the HJB reduces to a system of 4 (n + 1)(N \u2212 n + 1) ordinary differential equations in the state variables V and can be solved numerically. Specifically, we use the software Matlab to solve an ODE system backward in time, meaning that the final conditions play the role of initial conditions and the variation is inverted in time (the r.h.s of (17) is multiplied by \u22121).\n4.1 Simulations of the N-Player System\nHaving obtained the Nash equilibrium feedback control \u03b1\u2217 for N + 1 players, we rescale the problem to N players and simulate the evolution of the sufficient statistics\nn+(t) = N\u2211\ni=1 I{xi=1}I{yi= }, n\u2212(t) =\nN\u2211 i=1 I{xi=1}I{yi=\u2212 },\nwhich has the Markovian evolution\n(n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (n+ + 1, n\u2212) with rate ( n \u2212 n+ ) \u00b7 \u03b1\u2217(\u22121,+ , n+, n\u2212, n , t);\n(n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (n+ \u2212 1, n\u2212) with rate n+ \u00b7 \u03b1\u2217(1,+ , n+ \u2212 1, n\u2212, n , t); (n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (n+, n\u2212 + 1) with rate ( N \u2212 n \u2212 n\u2212 ) \u00b7 \u03b1\u2217(\u22121,\u2212 , n+, n\u2212, n , t);\n(n+, n\u2212) \u2192 (n+, n\u2212 \u2212 1) with rate n\u2212 \u00b7 \u03b1\u2217(1,\u2212 , n+, n\u2212 \u2212 1, n , t).\nInitializing appropriately (n+(0), n\u2212(0)), by independently assigning to each player xi (0) = 1 with probability 1+m02 and yi = with probability 12 , we run simulations of the above dynamics, eventually obtaining samples for mN (T ) = 2 n+(T ) + n\u2212(T )N \u2212 1. Averaging over S independent simulations we estimate the expectation E(mN (T )).\nMore in detail, in our first series of experiments we fix m0 = 0.25, and we take different values of and T . Concerning the number of simulations, we set S = 100, whereas the number of agents in the population is N = 30. This figure could appear too small to describe a large population. However, what we see in our simulations is that the expected values of mN are approximating very well the asymptotic equilibrium of the mean field game, except for some transition windows that we will discuss in more detail. Later, in a second series of experiments, we will also consider N = 60. Note that, by increasing N , the numerical problem becomes quickly intractable because of the high dimension of the HJB associated with the N -dimensional system.1\nIn Fig. 2, we compare E(mN (T )) (red circles, estimated by averaging over the S simulations), the equilibrium emerging in the finite dimensional model, with the mean field equilibria described as the solutions to the Fixed Point Equation (13) (black lines). Specifically, we consider three different values of \u2208 {0.5, 0.52, 0.6} and we let T vary from T = 0 to a large time, where the largest equilibrium value of m(T ) is approaching the limit value of 1.We expect thatE(mN (T )) converges in N towards one of the mean field equilibria solving (13). This is verified in our simulations; notably, for certain values of the parameter , we see a clear transition from a polarized to a unpolarized equilibrium or vice versa. In fact, by looking at the four panels of Fig. 2, if is large enough (see panel with = 0.6), the individual behavior prevails for all T and the population sticks with the smallest (unpolarized and coherent) equilibrium. When is small enough (see panel with = 0.5), the selected equilibrium changes continuously in T , as in the large case, but this equilibrium is unpolarized for small T and polarized for larger T . More interesting is the case of intermediate values of (see panel with = 0.52). Here, we see a continuous branch of unpolarized and coherent equilibria existing for all T > 0, while a branch of polarized coherent equilibria emerges for T sufficiently large. In this case, the N -player game agrees with the unique unpolarized equilibrium for small T , jumps to the branch of polarized equilibria as it emerges, but for larger T it jumps back to the less polarized equilibrium. We actually see \u201csmooth transitions\u201d rather than \u201cjumps\u201d, but this could be due to the small value of N in simulations.\nNote that this switch from polarized to unpolarized is not seen for all values of the initial condition m0, as seen in Fig. 3.\nIn the next section, we provide a justification behind the emergence of one selected equilibrium, in case that multiple equilibria are present in the mean field limit."

            "heading": "4.2 A Rationale Behind the Equilibrium Selection",
            "text": "In all the numerical experiments, we have performed aboutE(mN (T )), the equilibrium emerging in the N -dimensional system, we can recognize two important properties:\n1 For N = 30, we have a system of 1024 equations. For N = 60, the number increases to 3844.\n= 0.48\nProperty 1. The equilibrium E(mN (T )) is always coherent. Namely, if m0 > 0, then mN (T ) > 0.\nProperty 2. For some values of , E(mN (T )) switches from a polarized to an unpolarized equilibrium (or vice versa) depending on the length of the time horizon T .\nConcerning Property 1, when we look at the finite dimensional system, the equilibrium E(mN (T )) converges, for N large, to one of the values m(T ) solving (13). Note that, among those values, there is at least one coherent equilibrium (i.e., an equilibrium with the same sign asm0). It is then plausible to presume that the finite population will\nselect one of the coherent equilibria, in that conveying to an incoherent equilibrium would ask for a (implausible) mobilization of the subpopulation ex-ante aligned with the sign ofm0. Property 2., instead, deals with the eventual polarization of the coherent equilibrium selected when playing the finite dimensional game. Here, the discussion is more subtle, since we do not have a clear and trivial explanation of the evident phase transitions we see in the simulations. The simplest explanation could be that the population chooses the equilibrium which minimizes the total cost, J (u), defined in (3). Interestingly, this functional, being a function of the control, can be rewritten in terms of m(T ). We can take advantage of (10) to see that, depending on the value of x \u2208 {\u22121,+1} and y \u2208 {\u2212 ,+ }, we can specify the cost needed to reach a certain equilibrium value m(T ):\nvm(T )(x, y) = {\n\u2212|m(T ) + y| if sign(m(T ) + y) \u2208 {0, x} \u2212|m(T ) + y| + 2|m(T )+y|T |m(T )+y|+1 if sign(m(T ) + y) = \u2212x, (18)\nwhere vm(T )(x, y) = V (0, x, y) evaluated atm = m(T ). This functional describes the total cost sustained by each subpopulation indexed by x and y to reach the equilibrium m(T ). We can now derive the costs sustained by the underdog subpopulation (the one whose local filed is opposite in sign tom0) and by its opponent, namely the one whose local filed is alignedwithm0.With a slight abuse of notation, we denote such quantities with J (\u2212 )(m(T )) and J (+ )(m(T )) to emphasize the dependence on the prevailing equilibrium. Accordingly, we will also write J (m(T )) as the total cost sustained by the entire system. We have\nJ (\u2212 )(m(T )) = 1 \u2212 m0 2 vm(T )(\u22121,\u2212 ) + 1 + m02 vm(T )(+1,\u2212 ) J (+ )(m(T )) = 1 \u2212 m0 2 vm(T )(\u22121,+ ) + 1 + m02 vm(T )(+1,+ )\nand\nJ (m(T )) = 1 2 J (\u2212 )(m(T )) + 1 2 J (\u2212 )(m(T )).\nIt is not difficult to see that, when considering only coherent equilibria (i.e., m(T ) such that sign(m(T )) = sign(m0)), J (m(T )) decreases in m(T ), in the sense that the more polarized the equilibrium is, the lower the cost to reach it. Therefore, we could expect the polarized equilibrium to prevail. However, as said, for certain values of the parameters, this is not the case. In line with our simulations, we now shape a different conjecture. We see that the prevailing equilibrium is the one that, among the coherent ones, minimizes the functional J (\u2212 ), namely the cost related to the underdog subpopulation.We rephrase this conjecture in the following fact, which embraces both the previous properties.\nProperty 3. The equilibrium E(mN (T )) of the N -dimensional system converges to\nthe coherent solution of (13) that minimizes J (\u2212 ).\nIn some sense, abstracting a two-player game played between the favorite player (y = + ) and the underdog one (y = \u2212 ), we can say that the former imposes that the equilibrium will be coherent (and this minimizes her effort), whereas the latter decides about polarization (again, minimizing effort given the previous selection).\nTo provide evidence about the goodness of Property 3, in Fig. 4, we plot the phase diagram of J (\u2212 ) for m0 = 0.25 and for the same values of and T seen in Fig. 2. As said before, for each equilibrium value m(T ) of the mean field limit, we have the corresponding value of J (\u2212 ).\nNote that, for = 0.52, we see two transitions corresponding to the points where the two branches of J (\u2212 ) related to the polarized and unpolarized coherent equilibria intersect themselves. In the lower panel of Fig. 4, we zoom on the right-bottom panel to better recognize such intersection. We see that the two branches of J (\u2212 ) related to the polarized and unpolarized coherent equilibria intersect themselves at T \u2248 8.9. Notably, this point lies in the time interval, where the emerging equilibrium of the N -dimensional system jumps from the polarized equilibrium to the unpolarized one (panel with = 0.6 of Fig. 2). We do not report all the figures related to the other values of , but the same fact still appears, thus corroborating Property 3.\nFinally, we show that the solution m(T ) related to the prevailing solution mN (T ) does not necessarilyminimize to total cost J (m(T )). In Fig. 5 (left panel), for = 0.52, we plot the value of m(T ) that minimizes J (\u2212 ) (bold blue circles) and J (thin black line). It can be seen that the two cases coincide as soon as T exceed the value T \u2248 8.9 discussed above. In the right panel of the same figure, we plot two different branches of J , one corresponding to m(T ) which minimizes J (\u2212 ), and the second one related tom(T )which minimizes J (thin black line). We see that the two curves differ exactly for T larger than the intersection value depicted above; this is the value of T where we know that the equilibrium mN (T ) in the finite dimensional model jumps from the polarized to the unpolarized one. This shows that the equilibrium emerging in the population dynamics does not always minimize the total cost. In some sense, the unpolarized equilibrium partially favors the underdog subpopulation, in that J (\u2212 ) is minimized among the coherent equilibria.\nWe now run a second series of experiment; the aim is still to reinforce the goodness of Property 3, showing that E(mN (T )) fairly well approximates the coherent mean field game equilibrium minimizing J (\u2212 ). For this round of simulations, we increase the number of agents taking N = 60. Concerning the other parameters, we choose different values ofm0, and T , in order to consider cases where there are one, three or five solutions to (13). Specifically, in the first panel of simulations, we fix T = 1 and let m0 and vary (cf. the first six experiments reported in Table 2); in the second panel, we fixm0 = 0.2 and let T and vary (cf. the second six experiments reported in Table 2). In Table 2, we report all results. The first three columns summarize the parameters of each experiment. In the fourth, we report the value of m(T ) which matches what prescribed by Property 3. Columns five and six pertain to the finite dimensional model; we indicate by mN (T ) the average value of mN (T ) as resulting by running S = 100 simulations, with an indication of its standard deviation, SD(mN (T )). Finally, in columns seven and eight, we measure the goodness of the approximation by reporting |mN (T )\u2212m(T )| and |mN (T )\u2212m(T )|/SD(mN (T )), respectively. By looking at these latter columns, it is evident that the equilibrium prevailing in the finite dimensional\nmodel aligns with what prescribed by Property 3. This is testified by the fact that the difference between mN (T ) and m(T ) is close to 0 (the highest value is 0.038 in experiment n.7) and that such difference is always below one standard deviation (the highest ratio is, again, in experiment n.7)."

            "text": "We have studied a simple mean field game on a time interval [0, T ], where players can control their binary state according to a functional made of a quadratic cost and a final reward. This latter depends on two competing drivers: (i) a social component rewarding conformism, namely, being part of the majority (conformism) and (ii) a private signal favoring the coherence of individuals with respect to a personal type (stubbornness). The trade-off between these two factors, associated with the antimonotonicity of the objective functional, leads to a fairly rich phase diagram. Specifically, the presence of multiple Nash Equilibria for the mean field game has been detected; moreover, when looking at the aggregate outcome of the game, several different types of equilibria can emerge in terms of polarization (fraction of conformists) and coherence (sign of the majority at the final time T compared to the sign of the initial condition).\nWe have described and characterized the full phase diagram and discussed the role of all the parameters of the model with respect to the aforementioned classification of possible equilibria. We have also analyzed a N -player version of the same mean field game. It is a well-known that in this latter case, the Nash Equilibrium is necessarily unique. It becomes, therefore, interesting to identify which equilibrium is selected by the N -finite population, in case the corresponding mean field game exhibits multiple equilibria. In this respect, we detected phase transitions, in the sense that, depending on one or more parameters of the model, the equilibrium emerging in the finitedimensional game is always coherent, but it may turn from an unpolarized one to a polarized and vice versa, depending on the length of the time horizon, T . This fact seems to be new in themean field game literature. At a first glance, we could expect the finite dimensional population to select the equilibrium minimizing the cost associated with the equilibrium for the entire system (interpreted as the collective cost). By contrast, what emerges from our simulations is that the equilibrium prevailing in the finite dimensional game is the one converging, for N large, to the coherent equilibrium thatminimizes the cost functional associatedwith the ex-ante underdog subpopulation, namely, the collection of such players whose private signal opposites the sign of the majority at time zero. Put differently, it seems that the ex-ante favorite subpopulation (namely, the one whose private signal is aligned with the initial condition) imposes the selection of a coherent equilibrium, whereas the ex-ante underdog subpopulation (namely, the onewhose private signal opposites the sign of the initial condition) decides about polarization.\nFunding Open access funding provided byUniversit\u00e1 degli Studi di Padovawithin the CRUI-CAREAgreement.\nOpenAccess This article is licensedunder aCreativeCommonsAttribution 4.0 InternationalLicense,which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

            "text": "Proof of Proposition 3.1: Polarized Coherent Equilibria (m > )\nFor m > , (13) can be rewritten as\nF(m, , T ,m0) := 1 \u2212 m \u2212 1 \u2212 m0 2T 2 \u03d5\n( 1 + mT\nT\n) = 0, (19)\nwhere\n\u03d5(y) = y 2 + 1\n(y2 \u2212 1)2 .\nBefore describing the solutions of the equation F(m, , T ,m0) in ( , 1], we give some simple facts that will be useful in the proof.\nFact 1. The map m \u2192 F(m, , T ,m0) is strictly concave for m \u2208 ( , 1], for each , T ,m0.\nProof This comes immediately from the fact that \u03d5 is strictly convex in (1,+\u221e). Indeed,\n\u03d5\u2032(y) = \u22122y(3 + y 2)\n(y2 \u2212 1)3 , \u03d5 \u2032\u2032(y) = 6(y 4 + 6y2 + 1) (y2 \u2212 1)4 . (20)\nNote also that \u03d5 is strictly decreasing. As a consequence of Fact 1, (19) can have at most two solutions in ( , 1]. Fact 2. The map T \u2192 F(m, , T ,m0) is strictly increasing for T \u2208 [0,+\u221e), for each m, ,m0, with m > .\nProof To see this, note that\n\u2202F \u2202T (m, , T ,m0) = 2(1 \u2212 m0)\n[ m(1 + Tm)3 \u2212 3 2T (1 + Tm) \u2212 4T 3]\n( (1 + Tm)3 \u2212 2T 2)3\n,\nwhich has the same sign as h(m, , T ,m0) := m(1+Tm)3 \u22123 2T (1+Tm)\u2212 4T 3. Observing that h( , , T ,m0) = , that\n\u2202h \u2202m (m, , T ,m0) = (1 + Tm)3 + 3Tm(1 + Tm)2 \u2212 3 2T 2\nis increasing inm and \u2202h \u2202m ( , , T ,m0) = 4 3T 3+6 2T 2+6 T +1 > 0,we conclude that \u2202F \u2202T (m, , T ,m0) > 0 for m \u2208 ( , 1]. This proves Fact2.\nFact 3. \u2200m, ,m0, with m > ,\nF(m, , 0+,m0) := lim T\u21930 F(m, , T ,m0) = m0 \u2212 m\nand\nlim T\u2191+\u221e F( , , T ,m0) = 1 + m0 \u2212 2 2 ,\nwhereas for m \u2208 ( , 1],\nlim T\u2191+\u221e F( , , T ,m0) = 1 \u2212 m.\nThese are simple asymptotics, and the proof is omitted.\nNow, we can prove Proposition 3.1. We begin with the case \u2264 m0. By Fact 3, F( , , 0+,m0) = m0 \u2212 \u2265 0; thus, by Fact 2, F( , , T ,m0) > 0, \u2200T > 0. Since, clearly, F(1, , T ,m0) < 0 and m \u2192 F(m, , T ,m0) is strictly concave by Fact 1, the uniqueness of the solution to (19) follows readily and case (i) is proved.\nNow, consider the case \u2265 1+m02 (which implies > m0). By Facts 2 and 3, F( , , T ,m0) < 0, \u2200T > 0. Since F(m, , 0+,m0) = m0 \u2212 m, by continuity (19) has no solution in ( , 1] for T small enough. Now, we claim that there exists a unique T (1)c = T (1)c ( ,m0) > 0 such that the graph of z = F(m, , T (1)c ,m0) is tangent to the line z = 0. Since F(m, , T ,m0) is strictly increasing in T (Fact 2), such T (1)c , if any, is unique. To prove the existence of T (1)c by continuity, it is enough to show that there are values of m \u2208 ( , 1] and T > 0 such that F(m, , T ,m0) > 0: this is true \u2200m \u2208 ( , 1) as F(m, , T ,m0) \u2192 1 \u2212 m for T \u2191 +\u221e (Fact 3). The conclusions in case (ii) are now obvious consequences of concavity and T -monotonicity of F .\nConsider, finally, the case m0 < < 1+m0\n2 . We first investigate the following equation in the unknown T > 0:\nF( , , T ,m0) = 0, (21)\nthat can be rewritten as\n1 \u2212 \u2212 2 2T 2 + 2 T + 1\n4 2T 2 + 4 T + 1 (1 \u2212 m0) = 0.\nThis can be cast as a quadratic equation in T : it has real solutions if and only if < 1+m02 , and in this case the only positive solution is T\n\u2217( ,m0) given in (15). Note that > m0 implies that T \u2217( ,m0) > 0. Now, T -monotonicity and m-concavity of F(m, , T ,m0) and the fact that\n\u2202 \u2202m F( , , T ,m0) = \u22121 + 2(1 \u2212 m0)T ( T + 1)(4 2T 2 + 2 T + 1) 2 T + 1 (22)\nis strictly increasing in T , show that there are two alternatives:\n(a) if \u2202 \u2202m F( , , T \u2217( ,m0),m0) \u2264 0, then, \u2013 for T \u2264 T \u2217( ,m0), the map m \u2192 F(m, , T ,m0) is less than or equal to 0 at m = and it is decreasing: there are no solutions to (19) in ( , 1];\n\u2013 for T > T \u2217( ,m0), themapm \u2192 F(m, , T ,m0) is strictly positive atm = , concave and negative at m = 1, so (19) has a unique solution in ( , 1];\n(b) if \u2202 \u2202m F( , , T \u2217( ,m0),m0) > 0, then by continuity there exists T (1)c = T (1)c ( ,m0) \u2208 (0, T \u2217( ,m0)) such that the graph of z = F(m, , Tc,m0) is tangent to the line z = 0; as above, this T (1)c is unique. Thus, \u2013 for T < T (1)c ( ,m0), (19) has no solutions in ( , 1]; \u2013 for T = T (1)c ( ,m0), (19) has a unique solution in ( , 1]; \u2013 for T (1)c ( ,m0) < T < T \u2217( ,m0), (19) has two solutions in ( , 1];\n\u2013 for T \u2265 T \u2217( ,m0), (19) has a unique solution in ( , 1]. Note that T (1)c is defined as in case (ii), and by the Implicit Function Theorem it is continuous at , \u2200 in its domain. To complete the proof of case (iii), we are left to show that there exists (1)\u2217 \u2208 ( m0, 1+m0 2 ) such that\n\u2202 \u2202m F( , , T \u2217( ,m0),m0) > 0 if and only if \u2208\n( (1)\u2217 , 1 + m0 2 ) ,\nso that T (1)c ( ,m0) is defined for \u2208 ( (1)\u2217 , 1]. Moreover, if this is the case, continuity implies that\nlim \u2193 (1)\u2217\nT (1)c ( ,m0) = T \u2217( \u2217,m0).\nTo complete the proof we are left to show the existence of such (1)\u2217 . This is established by proving that themap \u2192 \u2202\n\u2202m F( , , T \u2217( ,m0),m0) is strictly increasing, negative\nat = m0 and diverging to +\u221e at = 1+m02 . We use the expressions (22) and (15), and the change of variable y := 1 + 2 T \u2217( ). Note that, by (15),\nT \u2217( ) = \u22121 2 + 1 2\n\u221a 1 \u2212 m0\n1 + m0 \u2212 2 ,\nso y = \u221a\n1\u2212m0 1+m0\u22122 . It is easily seen that dy d > 0, y(m0) = 1 and lim \u2191 1+m02 y( ) =+\u221e.\nWe can write, using (22),\nG( ,m0) := \u2202 \u2202m\nF( , , T \u2217( ,m0),m0) = \u22121 + (1 \u2212 m0) (y 2 \u2212 1)(y2 \u2212 y + 1)\n2 y .\nThis shows that G(m0,m0) = \u22121 and that G( ,m0) diverges to +\u221e as \u2191 1+m02 . So the last step is to prove that G is strictly increasing in . We have\n\u2202G \u2202 ( ,m0) = 1 \u2212 m02 d dy\n( (y2 \u2212 1)(y2 \u2212 y + 1)\ny\n) dy\nd \u2212 1 \u2212 m0 2 2 (y2 \u2212 1)(y2 \u2212 y + 1) y .\nUsing the facts that dyd = y 3 1\u2212m0 and = (1+m0)y2\u2212(1\u2212m0) y2 , it follows that \u2202G \u2202 ( ,m0) has the same sign as\ny3 1 \u2212 m0 3y4 \u2212 2y3 \u2212 y2 + 1 y2 \u2212 (y 2 \u2212 1)(y2 \u2212 y + 1) y\n= 1+m0 1\u2212m0 y 2 \u2212 1 y (y2(y \u2212 1)(3y + 1) + 1) \u2212 (y 2 \u2212 1)(y2 \u2212 y + 1) y\n\u2265 y 2 \u2212 1 y (y2(y \u2212 1)(3y + 1) + 1) \u2212 (y 2 \u2212 1)(y2 \u2212 y + 1) y = (y2 \u2212 1)(y \u2212 1)(3y2 + y \u2212 1) > 0, \u2200 y > 1, (23)\nwhere we have used the fact that m0 \u2265 0 and the expression in the second line of (23) is increasing in m0. This completes the proof.\nProof of Proposition 3.2: Polarized Incoherent Equilibria (m < \u2212 )\nThe proof repeats some of the arguments seen in the proof of Proposition 3.1. It is convenient to take advantage of the symmetry relation (14). This implies that we can equivalently find the equilibria in ( , 1] after replacing m0 by \u2212m0. For the regime \u2265 1\u2212m02 , the proof of part (ii) of Proposition 3.1 applies with no changes, as the assumption m0 \u2265 0 was not used. For the case 0 < < 1\u2212m02 , we can adapt the proof of part (iii) of Proposition 3.1, where the assumption m0 \u2265 0 was only used to prove the existence of (1)\u2217 . Here, we obtain the same behavior seen for (1)\u2217 < < 1+m02 in Proposition 3.1: to repeat the same argument we need to show that\n\u2202 \u2202m F( , , T \u2217( ,\u2212m0),\u2212m0) > 0, \u2200 : 0 < < 1 \u2212 m0 2 .\nIndeed, as seen in the proof of Proposition 3.1,\n\u2202 \u2202m F( , , T \u2217( ,\u2212m0),\u2212m0) = \u22121 + (1 + m0) (y 2 \u2212 1)(y2 \u2212 y + 1) 2 y ,\nwith y = \u221a\n1+m0 1\u2212m0\u22122 . Note that, asm0 \u2265 0, y > 1 for all 0 < < 1+m02 . In particular,\ny2 \u2212 y + 1 > 1 so that, with a further simple computation we get\n\u2202 \u2202m F( , , T \u2217( ,\u2212m0),\u2212m0) > \u22121 + (1 + m0) y 2 \u2212 1 2 y = \u22121 + + m0 y > 0.\nThus, the proof for the case 0 < < 1\u2212m02 can be carried out in the same way as the proof of part (iii) of Proposition 3.1 (case (1)\u2217 < < 1+m02 ).\nProof of Proposition 3.3: Unpolarized Coherent Equilibria (0 \u2264 m \u2264 )\nFor m \u2208 [0, ], equation (13) becomes:\nF(m, , T ,m0) := 2( T + 1)Tm + m0 [ ( T + 1)2 + m2T 2]\n( ( T + 1)2 \u2212 m2T 2)2\n\u2212 m = 0. (24)\nWe begin by observing that\nF(m, , T ,m0) = 1 ( T + 1)2 \u03d5\n( T 1 + T m,m0 ) \u2212 m, (25)\nwhere\n\u03d5(z,m0) := 2z + m0(1 + z 2)\n(1 \u2212 z2)2 . (26)\nIn particular, this allows to prove easily that, if m0 \u2265 0, then m \u2192 F(m, , T ,m0) is convex.\n(i) Note first that F(0, , T ,m0) = m0( T+1)2 > 0 (recall that here m0 \u2265 > 0). Moreover,\nF( , , T ,m0) = 2( T + 1) T + m0 [ ( T + 1) + 2T 2]\n( ( T + 1)2 \u2212 2T 2)2\n\u2212 = \u03c8( T ,m0) \u2212 ,\nwith\n\u03c8(y) := 2(y + 1)y + m0 [ (y + 1)2 + y2]\n(2y + 1)2 .\nAs \u03c8 \u2032(y) = 2(1\u2212m0) (2y+1)3 , we deduce that F( , , T ,m0) is strictly increasing in T , except form0 = 1 (in this case it is constant). In all cases, we have that, since F( , , 0,m0) = m0 \u2212 \u2265 0, F( , , T ,m0) > 0, \u2200T > 0. Thus, the map m \u2192 F(m, , T ,m0) is strictly positive at the endpoints of the interval (0, ). We also have F(m, , 0,m0) = m0 \u2212 m > 0 \u2200m \u2208 (0, ). Moreover, it is easily seen that for each m \u2208 (0, ),\nlim T\u2192+\u221e F(m, , T ,m0) = \u2212m < 0. (27)\nThen, theremust be a timeT (2)c ( ,m0) such that forT < T (2) c ( ,m0), F(m, , T ,m0) > 0, \u2200m \u2208 (0, ), and the graph of the convex function y = F(m, , T (2)c ( ,m0),m0) is tangent to the line y = 0. Set\nT := { T > 0 : min m\u2208(0, ) F(m, , T ,m0) \u2264 0 } .\nThe proof of this point (i) is completed as we show that T = [T (2)c ( ,m0),+\u221e). If this is not the case, by continuity, there must be a time T\u0302 \u2265 T (2)c ( ,m0), m\u0302 \u2208 (0, ) and \u03b4 > 0 such that\nF(m\u0302, , T\u0302 ,m0) = 0, d dm F(m\u0302, , T\u0302 ,m0) = 0, (28)\nbut F(m\u0302, , t,m0) > 0, \u2200t \u2208 (T\u0302 , T\u0302 + \u03b4). To show that this is impossible, it is enough to prove that\nd\ndT F(m\u0302, , T\u0302 ,m0) < 0. (29)\nTo see this, it is convenient to perform the following change of variables: u := m \u2208 (0, 1) and r := T , so that\nF(m, , T ,m0) = G(u, , r ,m0) := 1 (1 + r)2 \u03d5\n( r 1 + r u,m0 ) \u2212 u, (30)\nwhere \u03d5 is given in (26). Note that (29) is equivalent to\nd\ndr G(u\u0302, , r\u0302 ,m0) < 0, (31)\nwhere u\u0302 := m\u0302 and r\u0302 := T\u0302 .\nClaim r\u0302 > 12 .\nProof To see this, note that, being \u2264 m0,\nG(u, , r ,m0) \u2265 H(u, r ,m0) := 1 (1 + r)2 \u03d5\n( r 1 + r u,m0 ) \u2212 m0u.\nThe claim follows if we show that, \u2200r \u2264 12 ,\nH(u, r ,m0) > 0, \u2200u \u2208 (0, 1). (32)\nSince H(u, r ,m0) is linear in m0, it is enough to prove (32) for m0 \u2208 {0, 1}. For m0 = 0 this is obvious, so we show it for m0 = 1:\nH(u, r , 1) = ( 1 + r1+r u )2\n(1 + r)2 ( 1 \u2212 r2u2 (1+r)2 )2 \u2212 u =\n(1 \u2212 u)(r2u2 \u2212 (r2 + 2r)u + 1) (1 + r(1 \u2212 u))2 ,\nwhich has the same sign as p(u) := r2u2 \u2212 (r2 + 2r)u + 1). If r \u2264 12 (indeed here r < 2 would suffice), p\u2032(u) = 2r2u \u2212 r2 \u2212 2r < 0, \u2200u \u2208 (0, 1), so, p(u) \u2265 p(1) = 1 \u2212 2r \u2265 0, \u2200u \u2208 (0, 1) and for r \u2264 12 . This completes the proof of the Claim.\nWe are now left with the proof of (31). Note that\nd dr G(u, , r ,m0) = \u2212 2 (1 + r)3 \u03d5 ( r 1 + r u,m0 ) + u (1 + r)4 \u03d5 \u2032 ( r 1 + r u,m0 ) , (33)\nwhere \u03d5\u2032(z,m0) = ddz\u03d5(z,m0). By (28),\nG(u\u0302, , r\u0302 ,m0) = 0 \u21d2 \u03d5 ( r\u0302 1 + r\u0302 u\u0302,m0 ) = u\u0302,\nand\nd du G(u\u0302, , r\u0302 ,m0) = 0 \u21d2 r (1 + r)3\u03d5 \u2032 ( r\u0302 1 + r\u0302 u\u0302,m0 ) = .\nInserting these identities in (33), we obtain\nd dr G(u\u0302, , r\u0302 ,m0) = u\u0302 1 + r\u0302 ( \u22122 + 1 r\u0302 ) < 0, as r\u0302 > 1 2 .\n(ii) Note that F(0, T , ,m0) = m0( T+1)2 > 0. Moreover, limT\u2192+\u221e F( , T , ,m0) = 1+m0\n2 \u2212 \u2264 0. Since, as shown in point (i), the map T \u2192 F( , T , ,m0) is strictly increasing, then F( , T , ,m0) < 0, \u2200T > 0. Thus, m \u2192 F(m, T , ,m0) has opposite sign at the endpoints of (0, ): by convexity there is a unique solutionm = M(T , ,m0) to F(m, T , ,m0) = 0. The fact that limT\u2192+\u221e M(T , ,m0) = 0 follows from the fact that limT\u2192+\u221e F(0, T , ,m0) = 0 and that limT\u2192+\u221e ddm F(0, T , ,m0) = \u22121. (iii) In this case, F(0, T , ,m0) = m0( T+1)2 \u2265 0. Moreover, F( , T , ,m0) < 0 \u21d0\u21d2 T < T \u2217( ,m0), as already seen in the proof of Proposition 3.1, point (iii). By convexity of m \u2192 F(m, T , ,m0), for T \u2264 T \u2217( ,m0) Eq. (24) has a unique solution in [0, ). The fact that m = 0 is a solution if and only if m0 = 0 is easily verified. Moreover, by (27), for T sufficiently large F(m, T , ,m0) attains negative values, it is positive at m = 0 and m = , so (24) has two solutions in [0, ). We need, however, a sharper analysis for T > T \u2217( ,m0). Note that, in this case F(0, T , ,m0) > 0 and F( , T , ,m0) > 0. Thus, by convexity of m \u2192 F(m, T , ,m0), (24) has zero or two solutions, except for the \u201cspecial times\u201d T for which the graph of the map m \u2192 F(m, T , ,m0) is tangent to the horizontal axis. Note that these special times are identified as (T -component of the) solutions in (0, ) \u00d7 (T \u2217( ,m0),+\u221e) of the system\n{ F(m, T , ,m0) = 0 d dm F(m, T , ,m0) = 0.\n(34)\nNote that (34) has no solutions with T \u2264 T \u2217( ,m0), so we may look for solutions of (34) in (0, ) \u00d7 (0,+\u221e). The remaining part of the proof is based on the following Lemma.\nLemma A.1 Let (2)\u2217 (m0) and (3)\u2217 (m0) be as in the statement of Proposition 3.3. Then,\nm0 < (2)\u2217 (m0) < (3)\u2217 (m0) < 1 + m0 2 ,\n(unless for m0 = 0, where 0 = (2)\u2217 (0) < (3)\u2217 (0) < 12 ) such that (a) for m0 < \u2264 (2)\u2217 (m0), (34) has a unique solution (m\u0303( ,m0), T\u0303 ( ,m0)); (b) for (2)\u2217 (m0) < < (3)\u2217 (m0), (34) has two solutions (m\u0302( ,m0), T (2)c ( ,m0)) and\n(m\u0303( ,m0), T (3) c ( ,m0)) with T (2) c ( ,m0) < T (3) c ( ,m0);\n(c) for (3)\u2217 (m0) \u2264 < 1+m02 , (34) has no solutions. The proof of this lemma is postponed after the end of this section. The desired result of the solutions of (24) readily follows from this Lemma. Indeed, in case (a), there is a unique special time T (2)c ( ,m0). Since, for large T , (24) has two solutions, necessarily for T \u2217( ,m0) < T \u2264 T (2)c ( ,m0) we must have F(m, T , ,m0) > 0, \u2200m \u2208 (0, ), so (24) has no solution.\nIn case (b), there are two special times T (2)c ( ,m0) < T (3) c ( ,m0): the only possibility is that, for T \u2217( ,m0) < T < T (2)c ( ,m0), the graph of m \u2192 F(m, T , ,m0) crosses twice the horizontal axis (two solutions for (24)), for T (2)c ( ,m0) < T < T (3)c ( ,m0) it stays above the horizontal axis (no solutions for (24)) and it crosses again twice the horizontal axis for T > T (3)c ( ,m0). The proof is therefore completed.\nProof of Lemma A.1\nBy the change of variables u := m \u2208 (0, 1) and r := T as in (30), we may replace F(m, , T ,m0) by\nG(u, , r ,m0) := 1 (1 + r + ru)2\n[ m0 + 2(1 + m0)(1 + r)ru (1 + r \u2212 ru)2 ] \u2212 u = 0,\nu \u2208 (0, 1), r > 0, and (34) is equivalent to { G(u, , r ,m0) = 0 d du G(u, , r ,m0) = 0.\n(35)\nLetting, as above, U (u, , r ,m0) := m0(1 + r \u2212 ru)2 + 2(1 + m0)r(1 + r)u \u2212 u\n[ (1 + r)2 \u2212 r2u2]2 = 0,wehave thatG(u, , r ,m0) = 1[(1+r)2\u2212r2u2]2U (u, , r ,m0).\nIt is immediately seen that (35) is equivalent to\n{ U (u, , r ,m0) = 0 d duU (u, , r ,m0) = 0,\n(36)\nWe use again the identity U (u, , r ,m0) = u dduU (u, , r ,m0) + ( m0 \u2212 4 r2u3 ) ( (1 + r)2 \u2212 u2r2) , which implies that (36) is equivalent to\n{( m0 \u2212 4 r2u3 ) = 0 d duU (u, , r ,m0) = 0.\n(37)\nSumming up, the number of pairs (m, T ) \u2208 (0, ) \u00d7 (0,+\u221e) solving (34) equals the number of solutions r to the equation\nW (r , ,m0) := d du U (( m0 4 r2 )1/3 , , r ,m0 ) = 0 (38)\nsuch that m0 4 r2\n< 1, i.e., r > \u221a\nm0 4 . With the help of a symbolic calculator, we obtain\n8W (r , ,m0) = r { 16 + [ 16 + 3m0 ( 2m0 r2 )1/3] r }\n+4 (1 + r)2 { \u22122 \u2212 4r + [ \u22122 + 3 ( 2m0 r2 )1/3] r2 } .\nNow, set V (s, ,m0) := W (\u221as, ,m0). Thus, we are left with the problem of finding the solutions of\nV (s, ,m0) = 0 (39)\nwith s > m04 . This last change of variable is a trick to get the following claim. Claim The map s \u2192 V (s, ,m0) is strictly concave in (m0 4 ,+\u221e ) .\nProof Using again a symbolic calculator we get, letting k := ( 2m0 )1/3 ,\n\u221212s3/2 d 2\nds2 V (s, ,m0)\n= 6 + m0ks1/6 + [ \u221212 + 4k2s\u22121/6 + 36s + 5k2s1/3 + 24s3/2 \u2212 8k2s5/6 ] .\nTo prove the claim, we need to show that this last expression is positive. Note that s > m04 = ( k 2 )3 . Moreover, as m0 < < 1+m0 2 , then 4m0 1+m0 < k 3 < 2. Again from\n< 1+m02 , the inequality d2 ds2 V (s, ,m0) < 0 follows if we show that\n6 + m0ks1/6 + 1 + m02 [ \u221212 + 4k2s\u22121/6 + 36s + 5k2s1/3 + 24s3/2 \u2212 8k2s5/6 ] > 0. (40)\nUsing s > ( k 2 )3 and k3 > 4m01+m0 , we have that 1+m0 2 5k 2 s1/3 > 1+m04 5k 3 > 5m0, so the l.h.s. of (40) is bounded from below by\nm0ks 1/6 \u2212 m0 + (1 + m0) [ 2k2s\u22121/6 + 18s + 12s3/2 \u2212 4k2s5/6 ] . (41)\nNow, for s \u2264 14 the expression in (41) is bounded from below by\n\u2212m0 + (1 + m0) [ 2k2s\u22121/6 \u2212 4k2s5/6 ] = \u2212m0 + 1 + m0\ns1/6\n( 2k2 \u2212 4k2s )\n\u2265 \u2212m0 + (1 + m0)k2s\u22121/6 \u2265 \u2212m0 + (1 + m0) (\n4m0 1 + m0\n)2/3\n\u2265 \u2212m0 + (1 + m0)42/3 m0 1 + m0 > 0.\nFor s > 14 , the expression in (41) is bounded from below by \u2212m0 + 18s + 12s3/2 \u2212 4k2s5/6 \u2265 \u2212m0 + s5/6 [ 18 ( 1\n4\n)1/6 + 12 ( 1\n4\n)2/3 \u2212 4k2\n]\n\u2265 \u2212m0 + s5/6 [( 1\n4\n)1/6 + 12 ( 1\n4\n)2/3 \u2212 4 22/3\n]\n\u2265 \u2212m0 + 8s5/6 \u2265 \u2212m0 + 2 > 0. This proves (40) and therefore the claim.\nNow, using concavity of V (s, ,m0) and the fact that lims\u2192+\u221e V (s, ,m0) = limr\u2192+\u221e W (r , ,m0) = \u2212\u221e, we have that (39) has a unique solution whenever V (m0 4 , ,m0 ) > 0. We get\nV (m0 4 , ,m0 ) = m0(1 + m0) 2 + (1 + m0) \u221a m0 \u2212 ( 1 + e \u221a m0 ) ,\nso\nV (m0 4 , ,m0 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 =m0 = 3 2 (1 \u2212 m0) > 0,\nV (m0 4 , ,m0 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 = (1+m0)2 = \u22121 2 (1 \u2212 m0) < 0 (42)\nand\nd\nd V (m0 4 , ,m0 ) = \u22121 \u2212 \u221a m0 \u2212 m0(1 + m0) 2 2\n\u2212 \u221a m0\n(1 + m0) 2 < 0.\nTherefore, there is a unique (2)\u2217 (m0), with m0 < (2)\u2217 (m0) < 1+m02 , such that\nV ( m0 4 (2)\u2217 , (2)\u2217 ,m0 ) = 0. Moreover, for m0 < < (2)\u2217 (m0), (39) has a unique solution and, since\nd\nds V (s, ,m0) \u2223\u2223\u2223 s=m04 = 2(1 + m0 \u2212 2 )\n( 1 + \u221a m0 \u03b1 )\n\u221a m0 \u03b1\n> 0,\nit follows that (39) has two solutions as crosses (2)\u2217 (m0). This actually occurs until reaches (3)\u2217 (m0), where (3)\u2217 (m0) is characterized by the fact that the graph of s \u2192 V (s, (3)\u2217 (m0),m0) is tangent to the horizontal axis. This is a consequence of the following monotonicity property:\nd d V (s, ,m0) < 0, \u2200s \u2265 m0 4 . (43)\nThis suffices to characterize (3)\u2217 (m0); to complete the proof, we need to show that (3)\u2217 (m0) < 1+m02 , which is equivalent to\nV ( s,\n1 + m0 2 ,m0\n) < 0, \u2200s \u2265 m0\n2(1 + m0) . (44)\nWe are therefore left to prove (43) and (44). We begin with (43).\nd d V (s, ,m0)\n= \u2212 1 8\n[ m0 ( 2m0 )1/3 s2/3 + 4 (1 + \u221as)2 ( 2 + 4\u221as + 4s \u2212 ( 2m0 )2/3 s1/3 )] .\nTo show that this expression is negative, we just observe that, being 2m0 \u2264 2,\n2 + 4\u221as + 4s \u2212 ( 2m0 )2/3 s1/3 > 2 + 4\u221as + 4s \u2212 2s1/3 > { 2 \u2212 2s1/3 \u2265 0 for s \u2264 1 4s \u2212 2s1/3 > 0 for s > 1.\nThis establishes (43). Now, we show (44). We recall that s \u2192 V ( s, 1+m02 ,m0 ) is strictly concave for s \u2265 m02(1+m0) . Moreover, again with the help of a symbolic calculator\nd\nds V\n( s,\n1 + m0 2 ,m0 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 s= m02(1+m0) = 0.\nSo it is enough to show that\nV\n( m0\n2(1 + m0) , 1 + m0 2 ,m0\n) < 0,\nthat has been seen already in (42). The proof is now complete.\nProof of Proposition 3.4: Unpolarized Incoherent Equilibria (\u2212 \u2264 m < 0)\nAs done in Proposition 3.2, we use the symmetry (14). So we look for solutions m \u2208 (0, ] of the equation F(m, , T ,\u2212m0) = 0; this allows to reuse some of the ideas in Proposition 3.3.\n(i) We employ here the change of variables seen in (30), so\nF(m, , T ,\u2212m0) = G(u, , r ,\u2212m0) := 1 (1 + r)2 \u03d5\n( r 1 + r u,\u2212m0 ) \u2212 u\n= 2(1 + r)ru \u2212 m0 [ (1 + r)2 + r2u2]\n( (1 + r)2 \u2212 r2u2)2\n\u2212 u\n= 1 (1 + r + ru)2\n[ \u2212m0 + 2(1 \u2212 m0)(1 + r)ru (1 + r \u2212 ru)2 ] \u2212 u.\nWe need to show that this last expression is strictly negative \u2200u \u2208 (0, 1); it is enough to show this for = 1\u2212m02 . This amounts to prove that\n\u2212m0 + 2(1 \u2212 m0)(1 + r)ru (1 + r \u2212 ru)2 < 1 \u2212 m0 2 u(1 + r + ru)2,\nwhich follows from\n2(1 \u2212 m0)(1 + r)ru (1 + r \u2212 ru)2\n< 1 \u2212 m0\n2 u(1 + r + ru)2\n\u21d0\u21d2 4r(1 + r) < [ (1 + r)2 \u2212 r2u2 ]2 ,\n\u2200u \u2208 (0, 1). This last inequality follows if we show it holds for u = 1, i.e., 4r(1 + r) < (1 + 2r)2, that is clearly true \u2200r > 0. (ii) As seen in the proof of point (i) of Proposition 3.3, F( , , T ,\u2212m0) is strictly increasing in T . Moreover, the same computation done after (21) shows that F( , , T ,\u2212m0) > 0 if and only if T > T \u2217( ,\u2212m0). By the same change of variables used in point (i), (24) is equivalent to the equation\n1 (1 + r + ru)2 [ \u2212m0 + 2(1 \u2212 m0)(1 + r)ru (1 + r \u2212 ru)2 ] \u2212 u = 0,\nwith u \u2208 (0, 1), which is also equivalent to\nU (u, , r ,m0) := \u2212m0(1 + r \u2212 ru)2\n+2(1 \u2212 m0)r(1 + r)u \u2212 u [ (1 + r)2 \u2212 r2u2 ]2 = 0.\nOur proof is based on the following claim.\nClaim Let u\u2217 \u2208 (0, 1) be such thatU (u\u2217, , r ,m0) = 0. Then, dduU (u\u2217, , r ,m0) > 0. Proof We use the identity\nU (u, , r ,m0) = u d du\nU (u, , r ,m0) + ( \u2212m0 \u2212 4 r2u3 ) ( (1 + r)2 \u2212 u2r2 )\n< u d\ndu U (u, , r ,m0)\nwhich proves the claim. This clearly implies that such u\u2217 exists if and only if U (1, , r ,m0) > 0 (as U (0, , r ,m0) = \u2212m0(1 + r)2 \u2264 0), i.e., if and only if r > T \u2217( ,\u2212m0) and in this case it is unique. This completes the proof."
