    "abstractText": "We study how satisfaction with government efforts to respond to the COVID-19 crisis affects compliance with pandemic mitigation measures. Using a novel longitudinal household survey for Germany, we overcome the identification and endogeneity challenges involved in estimating individual compliance by using an instrumental variable approach that exploits exogenous variation in two indicators measured before the crisis: political party preferences and the mode of information measured by the frequency of using social media and reading newspapers. We find that a one unit increase in subjective satisfaction (on the 0-10 scale) improves protective behavior by 2-4 percentage points. Satisfaction with the government\u2019s COVID-19 management is lower among individuals with right-wing partisan preferences and among individuals who use only social media as an information source. Overall, our results indicate that the effectiveness of uniform policy measures in various domains, such as the health system, social security or taxation, especially during pandemic crises, cannot be fully evaluated without taking individual preferences for collective action into account.",

Governments around the world have implemented a vast number of management strategies and strict public health measures, such as lockdown and social distancing. However, in democratic societies, governments cannot enforce them by means of coercion or by monitoring and controlling the whole society is neither feasible nor desirable [1]. Moreover, the effectiveness, e.g., lower transmission rate of infection, and the efficiency, e.g., lower monitoring and enforcement costs, of these policies depend largely on behavior adaption and on individual commitment and careful preparedness [2\u20134]. From an economic point of view, a key component of strategic behavior is that individual performance and motivation depend strongly on personal attitudes and subjective well-being preferences and the expected value of a specific\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 1 / 21\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Jaschke P, Keita S, Vallizadeh E, Ku\u0308hne S (2023) Satisfaction with pandemic management and compliance with public health measures: Evidence from a German household survey on the COVID-19 crisis.

Such attitudes and subjective perceptions are considered to be important in various domains such as in the context of job-satisfaction and occupational commitment [5] and of happiness and tax compliance [6].\nFrom a health policy perspective, uniform health measures that treat all people symmetri-\ncally can bear larger social and economic costs compared to targeted measures that differentiate between risk and non-risk groups [4, 7, 8]. This is particularly the case whenever the shortterm costs, e.g., imposing strict lockdowns and social distancing, are perceived more directly than medium- and long-run benefits, e.g., well-functioning healthcare systems. As a consequence, a gap may arise between the individual incentives to comply with public health measures and the socially desired level of compliance. This study addresses the question of whether increased satisfaction with government pandemic management induces more compliance with public health measures, thereby reducing the gap between individual\u2019s perceived costs of compliance and their perceived advantages of compliance for society.\nSpecifically, the cost of public health measures in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic was\nnot equally distributed [9]. Therefore, clear communication and consultation of policy measures would enhance the understanding of policy goals. This could raise satisfaction with government pandemic management and, in turn, increase both individual protective behavior (e.g., wearing face masks or social distancing) and improve health outcomes. Furthermore, understanding the effect of satisfaction with government pandemic management on compliance with health policy measures is highly relevant for a number of reasons. In the context of medical treatment, patients\u2019 degree of satisfaction with healthcare services contributes to their commitment to and compliance with recommended treatments [10, 11]. Moreover, policies induce social action, which entails costs for some individuals to achieve positive outcomes for society. To assess the net effects of policies for society, policymakers need to take into account individual\u2019s preferences, i.e. their perceptions regarding advantages or values associated with the success of the policy [12].\nCompelling evidence on the relationship between individual satisfaction with government\nmanagement and compliance with public health measures in the context of pandemics and health crises is lacking. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate whether and how subjective satisfaction with the government\u2019s pandemic management explains individual compliance with protection and health measures. To this end, we conduct a multivariate regression analysis combining original data collected both before and during the pandemic."

SOEP-CoV is a COVID-19-related, probability-sample survey extension of the SOEP, one of the largest and longest-running panel surveys worldwide [14]. SOEP conducts annual interviews with individuals in private households in Germany. It consists of multiple random (enlargement/refreshment) sub-samples, that have been drawn throughout the years [15]. Applying survey weights, SOEP data is representative for the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 2 / 21\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nGerman private household population both in cross-sectional as well as in longitudinal analysis settings.\nSOEP-CoV is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of its \u201ccall for proposals for research on COVID-19 in the wake of the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak.\u201d The Institute for Employment Research (IAB) participated in the project as a cooperation partner for the IAB-SOEP Migration Sample (subsamples M1, M2; see [16]) and the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees (subsamples M3, M4, M5; see [17, 18]). The SOEP-CoV data is officially available to the scientific community with the regular rollout of the SOEPCore data v37 (DOI: 10.5684/soep.core.v37eu) by the SOEP Research Data Center. Information on data access can be found at [19]. Note that for access to regional data (residence places of survey respondents), an expanded data distribution contract is required (for more information refer to [20]).\nThe SOEP-CoV survey covers two waves and was administered in the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) format between April and June 2020 (wave 1) and January and February 2021 (wave 2). It is based upon a random sample of private households that previously participated in the 2018 and 2019 wave of the SOEP. In each household, one individual (18+) was interviewed. The data were collected from 6,700 respondents interviewed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (wave 1), 6,000 of whom could be reinterviewed a second time in early 2021. In wave 1, households were divided into 9 tranches, each representing a random subsample and interviewed consecutively throughout the survey phase. For an overview of the topics and a detailed explanation of the methodology, see [13].\nIn this paper, we use data from tranches 2\u20134 of SOEP-CoV wave 1 and the entire data of\nwave 2. The reason for dropping the first tranche of about 1,700 individuals is that selected components of compliance measures that we employ for our dependent variable were not elicited. Additionally, we lose about 1,500 observations from tranches 5\u20139 since our main explanatory variable \u201csatisfaction with the German Federal government\u2019s crisis management\u201d was not part of the questionnaire. The results are robust due to the random design of each tranche. Taken together, our estimation sample covers 6,149 person observations surveyed in wave 1 between April and May 2020 (3,390 person observations) and in wave 2 between January and February 2021 (5,820 person observations). This gives us both variation in the prevailing regional infection situation and in the infection prevention measures either recommended or even mandated by the government at the time of interviews; 75 percent of the interviews in wave 1 of our working sample were conducted in April, during the period in which far-reaching health-protective measures have just been implemented in Germany. Most of these measures were still in place during the field phase of the second wave or were reintroduced due to renewed increases in infection rates after the temporary easing in the summer 2020.\nThe survey data cover detailed information on respondents\u2019 current health, social and\nemployment situation, economic risks, values and preferences, and much more. We drop 19 respondents from wave 1 and 36 respondents from wave 2 who did not answer the question regarding satisfaction with the government\u2019s crisis management. In case of missing values in the remaining control variables, we control for a missing category using a dummy variable. The proportion of missing values can be inferred by comparing the values in columns titled N in Table 2, and is not more than 4% for any control variable. Given the panel structure of the data, we combine information from the COVID-19 survey with that from the regular SOEP study before COVID for each participant. Specifically, we use the SOEP-Core (v36) data collected between August and December 2019, i.e., closely before the COVID-19 crisis started. All individuals in our sample as described above also participated in the 2019 panel survey. Taken together, this provides a rich data set that includes both pre- and post-crisis information for each individual.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 3 / 21\nWe complement the SOEP survey data by including aggregate data on the unemployment\nrate and log population density per square kilometer (both measured at March-31\u20132020) in the municipality of residence [21, 22] and the COVID-19 incidence rate (measured per 100,000 residents in the last 7 days before the interview, provided by the Robert Koch Institute and downloaded from [23]) at the district level. In addition, we use an indicator of available inpatient medical care capacity (measured by the number of hospital beds available for acute care patients in 2016 per 1,000 residents [24]) at the district level. This proxy for regional health system capacity is relevant to avoid omitted variable bias. For example, individuals in regions with high hospital capacity might feel safer from the virus and therefore be less compliant while being more satisfied with the government."

First, we use the answer to the question \u201cHow satisfied are you with the coronavirus crisis management by [authority X]?\u201d as our main explanatory variable.

Particularly, we use answers to the following question: \u201cThere are various recommendations for how to behave in everyday life and in public to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. If you think back over the last seven days, have you . . .\u201d. This question included up to ten answer items. Two of these answer items were available in a few tranches only: the item \u201cregularly aired out the living areas of your home?\u201d was asked in tranche 1 of wave 1 only and the item \u201cworn a protective mask when shopping or using public transport?\u201d in tranches 2\u20134 of wave 1 only and wave 2. Therefore, in order to have a consistent set of individual compliance measures over the survey period, we exclude the item \u201cregularly aired out the living areas of your home?\u201d by restricting our final working sample to tranches 2\u20134 of wave 1 and wave 2 (see section 2.1 above). We calculate our main compliance index as the mean over the 9 items as depicted in Table 1.\nFinally, to assess the causal effect of satisfaction on compliance, we utilize two measures from the pre-COVID longitudinal SOEP wave 2019 to implement an instrumental variable estimation strategy. First, we use the question on whether participants lean toward any\nTable 1.

The response items for this question included the leading political parties across the political spectrum in Germany, such as the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the conservative Christian Democratic Party (CDU/CSU), the left-wing party (Die Linke) and the rightwing party (Alternative for Germany [AfD]). Second, we use the question regarding what people do in their leisure time. There were 11 response items, such as \u201ccontacting friends or relatives\u201d or \u201cwatching TV or movies\u201d, that respondents could report engaging in at the following frequencies: \u201cdaily\u201d, \u201cat least once per week\u201d, \u201cat least once per month\u201d, \u201cseldom\u201d, and \u201cnever\u201d. We use the two items \u201creading (daily) newspapers (including digital newspapers)\u201d and \u201cusing online social networks/chat services (e.g., Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/WhatsApp)\u201d and respectively code the answers \u201cdaily\u201d and \u201cat least once per week\u201d as 1 and the remaining answers as 0. Then, we generate a factor variable with four values according to the possible combinations of newspaper reading and social network usage.\nGiven that both blocks (political party preferences and media usage) were asked in 2019, we\nuse them as separate instrumental variables for our main independent variable \u201csatisfaction with the government\u2019s crisis management\u201d."

            "text": "A strong correlation between two variables does not necessarily reflect a causal relationship. The correlation could arise if the explanatory variable is correlated with the error term, i.e, the unexplained part of the dependent variable in the multivariate regression model. This situation is broadly referred to as endogeneity between the regressor and the outcome variable. It is a common issue in observational studies and it can be the result of several causes. For example, if attentive and careful individuals would have complied even without the government\u2019s protective measures, reverse causality would lead to a downward bias in the estimation. Moreover, there might also be omitted variable bias: Individuals who perceive themselves to be at high risk, e.g., due to chronic diseases, might be more satisfied with the government interventions and comply more with health protective measures. In presence of such endogeneity issues, standard OLS estimators are biased and estimated coefficients do not reflect causal relationships.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 5 / 21\nTo assess the causal effects of subjective satisfaction on protective behavior, we instrument\nour main explanatory variable with information elicited before the COVID-19 crisis. With our unique panel data, we are able to use information collected in 2019 about the political preferences of participants in the SOEP-CoV survey. This approach contrasts with that in existing studies, which usually use survey information collected only after the outbreak of the pandemic. Specifically, we include seven dummy variables (with no party preference as the reference category) corresponding to the six parties currently represented in the German Bundestag and one collective category, (others), for all other parties. Instrumental variable (IV) estimates are valid under two conditions ([26\u201328]). The first condition is that the instruments are relevant in explaining individuals\u2019 satisfaction with the government\u2019s COVID-19 crisis management. The second condition is that the instruments are not part of structural Eq (1), i.e., they satisfy the so-called exclusion restriction. Two assumptions underlie this condition: (i) the instruments (political preferences) should not directly affect compliance and (ii) the instrument should be independent of potential outcomes, conditional on covariates. In the next sub-sections, we discuss the plausibility of these two identifying assumptions.\n2.4.1 First condition: Relevance. To evaluate the relevance of our IV, in the online\nTable A.1 in S1 Appendix, we show the first-stage OLS results. We regress satisfaction with the government\u2019s crisis management (on the 0\u201310 scale) on our seven instruments (with no party preference as reference category). This approach is similar to that of [29, Table 2], who test trust in state government with individual dummies for whether the government is represented by the respondent\u2019s own preferred party. Supporters of the ruling grand coalition at that time (SPD and CDU/CSU) are the most satisfied, followed by supporters of the Greens. In contrast, AfD supporters have satisfaction scores that are on average more than 2 points lower than those of the reference group (no party preference). All effects remain highly statistically significant when we include additional individual and regional control variables as well as regional and time fixed effects.\n2.4.2 Second condition: Exclusion restriction. With regard to the exclusion criteria, the panel structure rules out the possibility of simultaneity because the instruments are measured in 2019, i.e, before the COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, knowing that political preferences have been measured in a different survey wave one year before the compliance variables greatly mitigates concerns that the instruments share any causes with the outcome. Furthermore, no obvious reason indicates that party affiliation should systematically and directly impact individual compliance with COVID-19 containment measures through another channel than satisfaction with the government\u2019s COVID-19 management.\nResearch from the US and Brazil does find a high explanatory power of political party affiliation for compliance with social distancing and individual containment measures; i.e., there is an enormous divergence in such compliance between Republicans and Democrats in the US ([29\u201332]) as well as supporters and opponents of President Bolsonaro in Brazil [33]. However, while media usage and risk assessment seem to play a role, little is known about the actual mechanisms [30].\nThe political situation in Germany is different. There is a cross-party consensus on the\nnecessity and usefulness of protection and hygiene measures. Until recently, even the far-right AfD, which is closest on the German political spectrum to the populist Trump and Bolsonaro administrations, supported the extensive hygiene measures recommended by the German government. In an official position paper on the COVID-19 crisis released on April 8 2020, the AfD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag criticized the federal government\u2019s crisis management but only in that the government had allegedly acted too late and instead should have implemented extensive hygiene measures earlier [34].

It was only toward the end of May 2020 that the political agenda of the party changed and the AfD parliamentary group filed a lawsuit before the Brandenburg Constitutional Court complaining about the disproportionate impact of the obligation to wear masks on the retail trade [36]. In our data, 75% of respondents in the first wave of SOEP-CoV were interviewed in April and 90% by mid-May, i.e., before the party changed course in its COVID-19 politics. Therefore, we doubt the possibility of a direct effect of political party affiliation on compliance."

This reflects the nationwide obligation to wear a mask in public only since April 29, while approximately two-thirds of the interviews were conducted before that date.

The extreme parties on the left (Die Linke) and right (AfD) of the political spectrum were favored by 4% and 3%, respectively. These shares of pre-pandemic party preferences remain nearly unchanged among 2021 respondents. Panel D) shows individuals\u2019 leisure time activities before the pandemic. In 2020, 23% said that they used social media but did not read newspapers daily or at least once per week, 19% read only newspapers, and 53% said that they used both types of media. Also, these proportions remain nearly unchanged when comparing to individuals interviewed in 2021.\nPanel E) shows summary statistics for the individual control variables. At just under 55\nyears of age, respondents in 2021 are about a year older than in 2020. Around 60% of respondents are female and about one third of respondents lives together with children in their household. While only around 8% have at the most lower secondary education (ISCED-2011: 0, 1, 2), slightly more than half have at the most post-secondary, non-tertiary education (ISCED-2011: 3, 4), almost a quarter at the most a Bachelor (ISCED-2011: 5, 6) and 15% a Master or Doctoral degree (ISCED-2011: 7, 8). More than 80% of respondents have no migration background, i.e. they were born in Germany and neither of the parents was born abroad. Respondents live in houses and apartments where one household member has an average of 51\u201352 square meters of living space. They show a mean satisfaction with their own health of 6.7 on the scale from 0 (low)\u201410 (high). Almost one quarter has been working in home-office at least partly and up to 10% have been in short-time work during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 43% of respondents were not employed just before the COVID-19 pandemic and the majority of employed individuals was in occupations whose main task can\u2014according to the so-called task-based approach literature [37, 38]\u2014be classified as \u201canalytical non-routine\u201d (22% of all respondents), followed by cognitive routine, manual non-routine, interactive nonroutine and manual routine tasks. Controlling for the main occupational task prevents omitted variable bias that might arise from the task affecting both satisfaction and compliance, e.g. because employees who have frequent interactions with customers have difficulty protecting themselves from exposure to the virus and are dissatisfied with the enforcement of the rules in place.\nThe average time between the mean interview dates in the 2020 (calendar week 17) and\n2021 (calendar week 4) survey is 40 weeks. During this period, satisfaction with the government\u2019s COVID-19 crisis management decreased by about 1 point on the 0\u201310 scale. These results are in line with other surveys in Germany that show high overall satisfaction with government management in the early phase of the pandemic [39]. In an international comparison, German residents display only a modest level of satisfaction with the imposed health measures to mitigate the pandemic. Using survey data for Austria in the period from April 17 to 29 2020, [40] report a mean level of satisfaction of 1.34\u2014on a scale from -3 (dissatisfied) to +3 (satisfied). Using a Chinese online survey of 20,000 respondents at the end of April 2020, [41] report a value of 39.2\u2014on a scale from 10 to 50. Compared to these findings, our results reveal a somewhat lower mean value of satisfaction. In contrast, using survey data for the UK collected at the end of April 2020, [42] reports that 51% of Britons approved government\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 situation, while 30% disapproved it.\nLooking at the summary statistics of regional control variables in panel F), the mean unem-\nployment rate (5.4%) and population density (about 1,100 per square kilometer) in respondents\u2019 municipality around the time of the outbreak of the pandemic is rather stable between the 2020 and 2021 survey. Comparing regional health system capacity in the district between 2020 and 2021 respondents, hospital beds for acute care patients per 1,000 residents only decreased by 0.5% to a level of 6,149. The increase in average COVID-19 incidence rate at the county level from 16 to 107 between the time of the 2020 and 2021 surveys reflects the overall increase in infection rates during this period.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 10 / 21"

An increase in satisfaction by one unit on the 11-point scale raises individuals\u2019 compliance by 3.3 percentage points in 2020 and 1.6 in 2021.

Overall, the results highlight an important implication. At the time of the survey, public perceptions of the acute health risk of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were quite high. Thus, the effect size is large given the exponential rise in the number of infection cases in Germany and many other countries around the world in the survey phase.\nTable 3 reveals further findings. Compliance of women is significantly more pronounced in 2020 than that of men\u2014on average almost 3 percentage points. One reason why this difference is no longer apparent in 2021 could be that some protection measures were made legally mandatory over the course of the pandemic. Furthermore, individuals with a direct migration background comply less than those without migration background in both surveys. Individuals who report higher satisfaction with their own health prior to the pandemic comply less in the 2020 survey."

We suspect that conspiracy theories, which are often spread on social networks such as Facebook or Twitter, are important here [43].

            "text": "Our main dependent variable is the compliance index, which is defined as the share of adhered measures out of 9 options. By definition, the share is bounded to the [0;1] interval. Although many studies have used the linear estimator to identify effects of treatment variables on fractional outcomes [44], the linear OLS and IV estimators assume an unbounded outcome. Thus, applying the linear estimator to a fractional outcome may miss important non-linearities and produce biased parameter estimates as well as incorrect confidence intervals, e.g. ranging beyond the 1\u20130 thresholds [45]. This problem becomes more severe, the closer the mean of the outcome variable\u2014and the predicted value\u2014is to the interval thresholds. In such cases, the assumption of normally distributed residuals may not be met. Given that the mean value of our main dependent variable (compliance index) is quite high at almost 0.9, we perform nonlinear regressions to rule out such concerns. Unfortunately, there is no ready-to-use estimator for fractional outcomes implemented in the commonly used statistical software packages. Therefore, we transform our compliance index into a dummy variable. Specifically, we code the dummy to 1 if respondents adhere to all out of 9 compliance measures and 0 if they adhere to 8 or less (the median compliance is 8 out of 9). Moreover, we replicate the results from\nTable A.2 in S1 Appendix, running 9 separate regressions for each component of our compliance index.\nResults are shown in Table A.4 in S1 Appendix. Similar to our main results, satisfaction\nwith the government\u2019s crisis management positively affects compliance and effects are stronger in the 2020 survey. While the probability to adhere to all out of 9 compliance measures increases, on average, by more than 4 percentage points in 2020 if satisfaction increases by 1\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 14 / 21\non the 11-point scale, the effect reduces to 2.5 percentage points in 2021 (models 1 and 11). The component-wise results are close to the linear 2SLS IV estimator in Table A.2 in S1 Appendix.: although effect sizes are marginally smaller in the non-linear case, they are positive and statistically significant across the same compliance components and survey years. Only for regularly washing hands (at least 20 seconds with soap and water), which was weakly statistically significant in the linear specification, we do not get significant results in the non-linear case. Also notable is wearing a protective mask when running errands or on public transport for which the coefficient in the 2020 non-linear model more than triples compared to the 2020 linear one (9.3 vs. 2.9). The reason for this is the larger variation compared to the other compliance components: in the 2020 survey, only 63% of respondents reported wearing a mask (other components more than 80%). The larger effect size results from the higher slope of the link function of the probit estimator in the middle range compared to the linear model."

            "text": "Although each tranche of SOEP-CoV was structured such that household composition within each tranch was representative of all private households in Germany [25], one may be concerned about non-random participation of respondents in the survey. This would induce bias in our estimates if, for example, individuals that are dissatisfied with the government\u2019s crisis management and at the same time comply strongly are systematically underrepresented in the survey. In order to rule out this mechanism, we re-estimate the effect of satisfaction with the government\u2019s COVID-19 crisis management on compliance applying survey weights. The calculation of weights builds on the existing household weights from participation in the pre-pandemic SOEP survey. These were, first, adjusted for successive dropouts in participation in SOEP-CoV (based on about 400 characteristics from previous participation in the panel survey, regional variables at the county level of residence, and telephone contact histories). Second, they were marginally adjusted according to various population distributions from the German micro-census (such as distribution of household number and size by state). Detailed information on the generation of the weights can be found in [46].\nIn column 1 of Table A.5 in S1 Appendix, we replicate our main result from Table 3 (col. 4) for the 2020 (wave 1) sample, applying the weights. The coefficient is slightly larger (not statistically significant). Note that the estimation sample is restricted to tranches 2\u20134 (out of 9) of the wave 1 sample due to changing questionnaire composition (see section 2.1). Specifically, wearing a protective mask when running errands or on public transport was not asked to respondents of tranche 1 in 2020, which makes up about one quarter of responses in SOEPCoV wave 1. In order to increase sample size, in column 2 of Table A.5 in S1 Appendix, we exclude the face mask dimension from the compliance index, which increases our sample size by more than 1,500 individuals. Still respondents of tranches 5\u20139 cannot be included as they were not asked on satisfaction with the government\u2019s COVID-19 crisis management (they make up about 20% of all SOEP-CoV respondents in wave 1). Also in this specification, which does not apply survey weights, the coefficient is very close and statistically equal to our preferred model in Table 3, col. 4). The same holds true for column 3, which differs from column 2 only in the inclusion of weights. Finally, the coefficient for the 2021 (wave 2) sample with survey weights in column 4 of Table A.5 in S1 Appendix is positive and statistically significant and confidence intervals overlap with the coefficient from the corresponding model in Table 3 (col. 8). The 2021 weights explicitly include non-response adjustments that balance varying response probabilities from wave 1 to wave 2, thus, addressing potential attrition bias in our results. Taken together, the exercises in Table A.5 in S1 Appendix do not indicate any biasing effects from potential non-random survey participation.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 15 / 21"

            "text": "Using unique panel data, this paper investigates the impact of subjective satisfaction with the German federal government\u2019s management of the COVID-19 crisis on compliance with health-protective measures. To identify the causal effect, we employ an IV approach. In doing so, we exploit the longitudinal nature of the panel sample to overcome the endogeneity concerns. The vast majority of recent survey studies on compliance with public health policies rely on ad hoc (online) surveys conducted during the ongoing pandemic. Notable large-scale and multi-purpose exceptions are the Swiss Household Panel [47], UK Household Longitudinal Study [48] and the Understanding America Study [49], which can be used to analyze changes over the pandemic based on at least one pre-pandemic observation for the same individual (see [50] for a systematic review). This also applies to some surveys with more targeted topics, such as the Swedish Pregnancy Panel [51]. In contrast, the SOEP-CoV data are based on an ongoing, representative German panel study running since 1984 (SOEP-CORE). By utilizing SOEP-CoV data instead of convenience sample data, we minimize potential undercoverage and nonresponse biases. Moreover, combining the SOEP-CoV data with detailed individual and household panel data enables us to draw causal inferences based on the information on individual preferences and attitudes collected during and before the COVID-19 crisis. We instrument subjective satisfaction with the government\u2019s COVID-19 crisis management with political party preferences prior to the COVID-19 crisis. The instrument exploits the lower satisfaction with the government\u2019s crisis management of individuals with political preferences for right-wing populist parties (e.g., AfD).\nThis paper contributes to at least two strands of the literature. First, a new set of studies\nemerged during the COVID-19 to examine compliance with health measures. One set of studies tests which factors relate to protective behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic [31, 52\u2013 55]. Previously, [56] also studied the relationship between preventive health behavior and flu vaccine take-up rates. For example, using online survey data for the U.S., [53] show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, compliance has depended on substantive moral support and social norms. Using survey data for the US, the UK and six member states of the European Union (EU), [54] show that compliance with health measures relates to threat perceptions and feelings of efficacy. [52] use survey data for Italy and show that intentions to comply with self-isolation restrictions depend on the duration of the protective measures and expectations about the extension of such measures. [31] show that partisan bias relates to risk perception and protective behavior. Their results reveal that counties with a higher share of Donald Trump voters are associated with less search activity regarding information on the virus and less engagement in social distancing behavior. [32] offer a discussion on political beliefs, partisan affiliation and compliance with health-protective measures. However, these studies mainly measure social and protective behavior as it has occurred during the pandemic. Since the COVID-19 pandemic caused an unexpected and major disruption in many people\u2019s lives, beliefs, political preferences and social behavior might have changed at the same time. This in turn could induce spurious correlations and limit the informative value of linkages between variables observed during the pandemic. Using an instrumental variable approach, this study takes a further step towards identifying the causal effect of social behavior on compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures.\nOur results show that a one unit increase in subjective satisfaction on the 11-point scale\nraises the protective behavior index by 2\u20133 percentage points. The effect size decreases as the pandemic progresses, probably because a number of containment measures became mandatory. Also, our results demonstrate that compliance is strongly related to an individual\u2019s profession and working conditions. The results also hold when we use an alternative IV approach,\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 16 / 21\ninstrumenting satisfaction with the government\u2019s crisis management with media consumption prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, these results are almost up to three times larger than those of the simple OLS estimates used in recent studies in the context of COVID-19, indicating a downward bias due to endogeneity and reverse causality issues.\nThese results augment the existing findings showing that preferences are correlated with contributions to public goods [57, 58], voting behavior [59], and compliance in crisis situations [31, 52, 55, 60, 61]. They also contribute to the general discussion about social preferences in the context of public goods [59, 60, 62\u201364]. For example, [59] find that subjective well-being explains retrospective voting behavior in favor of the incumbent. Using data for the US and for Germany, [60, 65] show that trust in institutions and social capital, respectively, determine compliance with COVID-19 measures. In this context, [64] find that in democratic societies, people\u2019s confidence in their government\u2019s actions improves more the efficacy of COVID-19 mitigation measures than implementation of strict protective measures. In relation to this literature, we investigate how preferences and attitudes with respect to social action have affected individual responses to policies during the pandemic crisis. Our findings suggest that, through its compliance-enhancing effect, subjective satisfaction with the COVID-19 crisis management increases the effectiveness of relatively mild public health measures. This can potentially increase the cost-effectiveness of anti-pandemic policies by preventing the need for more stringent measures, such as lockdowns with curfews. Hence, our results highlight that satisfaction preference is an important parameter to social planer\u2019s trade-off between economic costs and welfare benefits of uniform policies.\nSecond, our study is also related to the discussion on happiness, public policy and gover-\nnance [12, 66\u201368]. Happiness or subjective well-being is a useful approximation of individual utility [12]. Utility is a term used to rank individual\u2019s preferences over a set of their choices or actions. According to economic theory, individuals choose the option that yields the highest utility less the costs induced by the action. By inducing social action, policy entails costs for some individuals. Policymakers need to take into account individual utility to assess the net effects of policies on society. If individuals are convinced of the benefits of a government\u2019s motives and actions, they are more likely to perceive the utility associated with certain restrictions. This could sway their preferences in favor of collective action and induce them to accept certain individual costs associated with restrictions more readily. [68] shows that political freedom and private freedom correlate strongly with happiness in rich and capable countries. More generally, greater government accountability, effectiveness, and stability is associated with higher subjective well-being [12]. Empirical evidence shows that happier people tend to have pro-democratic and pro-market attitudes [67]. Similarly to this line of research, we address how satisfaction correlates with political attitudes and media consumption and how these in turn affect protective behavior. Satisfaction scores of AfD supporters are, on average, more than 2 points lower than those of the reference group with no party preference (on the 11-point scale). Individuals who predominantly and frequently use social media are approximately 0.5 points less satisfied than those who frequently read newspapers."

First, they highlight that the efficacy of COVID-19 mitigation measures depends, inter alia, on individual preferences for government policy. Second, political attitudes and sources of information seem to play an important role in how a society responds during a pandemic crisis. They shape confidence and trust in institutions and government action. Third, the efficacy of uniform policy measures depends on the costs and benefits of social action. Thus, policymakers need to take into account\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281893 February 21, 2023 17 / 21\nindividual preferences for social action to assess the net effects of uniform policies on society. Finally, our results indicate that the effectiveness of policy measures in various domains, such as the health system, social security or taxation, especially during pandemic crises, need to carefully consider individual preferences for social action and provide targeted information.\nSupporting information"
