    "abstractText": "Traditional models to train and teach young players in team sports assume that athletes learn as linear systems. However, an actual methodology called Non-Linear Pedagogy (NLP) accounts for the fact that the players and the team are complex dynamic systems. Experiences in handball under this methodology are scarce; due to this, an observational study has been conducted with a follow-up, idiographic and multidimensional design, in which 14 female school handball players belonging to four different local teams in Santiago, Chile (age = 15.55 + 0.51) agreed to participate in three special handball training sessions with the use of the NLP methodology where three different constraints were used. Descriptive analysis with the Chi-squared test showed a total of 252 observations where most of the variables were dependent on the constraints (p \u2264 0.001). Frequency showed that mainly \u201cDefense in Line of progression\u201d and \u201cProximal contact\u201d were the most activated variables, followed by \u201cHarassment\u201d and \u201cDeterrence\u201d for all constraints. However, only constraint 2 highly activated two collective motor behaviors, while the rest only did it with individual motor behaviors. It is concluded that the constraints used in training seem to be effective in activating a group of defensive handball motor behaviors, specifically those that are basic for female school handball players.",

            "text": "Handball, as a team sport, requires the domain of tactical knowledge, coordinative skills, physical fitness, mental strength, motor skills, social relationships, leadership, communicative skills, power, endurance, speed and decision-making abilities, among several other variables [1,2]. All of these are part of the dimensions that comprise athletes as human beings and which together must interact harmoniously with each player to help them perform as great as possible as a team [3]. However, traditional teaching models for team sports have only focused on the development of technique, followed by tactical skills and the introduction of the rules of the game, using an isolated context complemented with strength and conditioning training [4]. Once the expected technical-tactical skills are acquired, these are taken into a special training session where a transference methodology is used, which progressively introduces the learned skills into the real game by replicating a group of movements pre-defined by the coach [5], repeating linear mechanic-specific movements, converting the participants into replicative passive players limited in their integral development although highly trained in their physical and technical dimensions [4].\nChildren 2023, 10, 469. https://doi.org/10.3390/children10030469 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/children\nChildren 2023, 10, 469 2 of 12\nIn this sense, traditional training models have pushed the nature of teams sports as a non-cyclical game to a standardized one, where the elements of uncertainty have decreased, improving the dependence on strength and conditioning work with a lack of creativity from the players, except for those exceptional highly talented ones [6]. The aforementioned is possible to see in handball, as it has been stated that performance indicators in the World Handball Championship for men and women are exclusively the \u201cAnthropometric Indicators\u201d (only for men), \u201cAge index,\u201d and \u201cScoring index,\u201d while tactical behaviors, decision-making, and team players interaction are not taken into account [6]. Also, it has been described that handball performance is highly dependent on fast breaks and counter attacks overall other attacking elements. This tactical behavior is described as a cyclic conduct for most female teams, which explains the reduced interest of viewers worldwide compared to men\u2019s handball games [7]. Other studies have shown that for handball, the most relevant elements to training for improving performance are goalkeeper efficacy and distance shooting efficacy in order to determine whether to win or lose a match [8]. However, a recent study from Flores\u2013Rodriguez & Alvite-de-Pablo [9] has demonstrated that the dynamic nature of offensive behaviors is highly relevant to determining goal efficacy. In response to these limitations, an alternative teaching model has been developed based on the complex dynamic system theory called Non-Liner Pedagogy (NLP), which involves the interaction between the players and the environment through the implementation of adapted games [10], comprehending that this provides an ambience where players must interrelate between them to solve tactical problems by using all their skills, mainly in an integrated way from the individual perspective as well as the team perspective as a whole and not as a sum of its parts [11]. The NLP allows players to elaborate paths of verbal and non-verbal communication, organize strategical responses, reproduce emergent tactical motor behaviors, analyze the environment to make decisions, and especially adapt their individual resources to improve the team\u2019s performance [12]. The NLP understands that team sports behave as a complex dynamic system, where the team is a dynamic network of players who will interact under the logic of the theory of chaos [13]. This means that every response from the team to a given problem (defensive and/or offensive) will be generated by the interaction of every involved player but also by the value of the interaction itself, given through the perception of each involved player. Thus, every conduct of the team in the field cannot be entirely predicted because multiple variables could affect them [14]. Nonetheless, as a complex dynamic system, there are constraints that push the system to act with certain specific behaviors, although with spontaneous changes of them when something disturbs the system. This change is called the conduct of emergency, which last for a reduced period of time until the disturbance is solved [11]. The NLP to teach team sports was first described by the study of Chow et al. [13] as an argument of the methodology called TGfU (Teaching Games for Understanding), which later evolved into the current NLP as a proper methodology [15]. The arguments presented refer to the use of adapted games where the goal is given, and specific tasks are limited or obligated through what is known as constraints manipulations (CM). This is the first study to introduce the concepts of the complex dynamic system theory in the field of team sports teaching, particularly the use of CM as the key to generating motor behaviors as a solution to the emerging difficulties that constantly appear in the context where the team is involved [13]. With regards to the CMs and their effects on motor behavior, one of the first studies that have described an experimental design is the study of Praxedes et al. [12]. Their research has shown that in football, through a two-vs-one practice, when the playing area is delimited and the players are asked to move and get away from their direct opponent, the players tend to provide a better chance to their teammates to score by moving the defense, this is the first evidence of the higher effectiveness of NLP compared with the traditional model.\nChildren 2023, 10, 469 3 of 12\nLater, specifically in handball, only a few studies were conducted using the NLP [16\u201319]. Most of these describe the effects of constraints manipulation on the tactical motor behavior, mainly on the attack, in the context of specific modified game situations, particularly in male players where the use of specific special rules, the limitation of the space, and the use of a specific number of defense lines, impulses desired motor behaviors such as the relation between players to attack by penetrating the defense using crosses, short passes, and blocking. Limited evidence has been reported according to handball\u2019s defensive motor behaviors developed by NLP. At the time this article was made, only the study of Flores\u2013Rodr\u00edguez and Ram\u00edrez\u2013Mac\u00edas [18] has given some specific results of CM on defenders. This study has shown emerging motor behaviors such as individual defense to pivot player, increased number of intended pass interceptions, opponent changes, and counter blocking, among others. As the evidence has demonstrated, the effectiveness of NLP on handball\u00b4s attacking motor behaviosrs is still limited, and due to the lack of more evidence regarding handball\u2019s defensive motor behavior and the absence of this kind of study in female players, researchers have hypothesized that the use of NLP in handball training might activate specific handball\u2019s defensive behaviors. Therefore, is the aim of this research to describe the effects of the use of NLP methodology in the development of defensive motor behaviors in young female handball players."

Particularly, this corresponds to a followup, idiographic and multidimensional design, as there was an inter and intra-sessional analysis which provided data about the frequency of the performed actions and about some behaviors of the players independently as part of a system (team) in both individual and collective responses [20]. The sample included 14 female school handball players belonging to 4 different local teams in Santiago, Chile (age = 15.55 + 0.51). All of them were selected by convenience to participate in a special training program for talent identification according to the Chilean National Federation of Handball criteria. Their handball experience comprised systematic training in their clubs for the last 6 years, although the last year was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, where most of their training was focused on physical and recreational activities through virtual meetings. Two of the players have also experienced playing on the national team in a Pan-American tournament during the year 2020 that included intensive double training sessions during a week every month before the beginning of the tournament. As part of the talent identification program, all the selected players showed handball\u2019s basic motor skills already developed, however, only in terms of individual offensive abilities. At the moment of the intervention, the players had experience with basic handball\u2019s defensive tactical behaviors: ball interception, blockage, and ball interception during dribbling. However, these were technically not efficient as expected. In terms of training load, all players had 2 sessions of handball training in their clubs. However, during this study, clubs only worked on the technical skills they reported. Before the study started, both the parents/guardians and the participants were notified and informed about the procedures, making it clear that their participation was totally voluntary. Also, informed consent was signed by the parents/guardians as well as by the players. It should be noted that this research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Granada under the registration number: 2000/CEIH/2021, responsibly ascribing to the standards agreed in the Helsinki agreement [21], specifically regarding research and medical procedures involving children."

The AT had 6 handball balls, which had to be left inside the central circle (Figure 1). For this, AT players were able to use all that the rules of handball allow and forbid them to do. On the other hand, the DT had to prevent AT from reaching its goal by using different actions also limited by the rules of handball. The exercise had to be performed 6 times; each repetition had to start every time an attacker achieved the goal or if the attacker lost the ball.\nChildren 2023, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 13"

For each session, a constraint was given to conditioning the motor behavior of defenders. These constraints were the next:\n- Session 1: Each attack of the 6 had to be done with the 6 balls at the same time, and no circulation of an attacker could be done through the central circle. - Session 2: Each attack of the 6 had to be done with only one ball at a time, and no circulation of an attacker could be done through the central circle. - Session 3: Each attack of the 6 had to be done with only one ball at a time, and the circulation of an attacker can be done through the central circle as a pivot position for only 3 s.\nThe coach remembered out loud the constraints for the DT players, and no other information was given before or during the exercise, as well as no feedback after it. It is important to highlight that none of the players had experience with collective defensive tactics before this study."

Every recorded session was saved in a virtual hard drive for the posterior edition. Every video was edited using Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2020\u00ae (USA), in which the NLP exercise of every session was saved independently of the rest of the session. Every NLP video was at the time edited to highlight every time the exercise started or finished and also when the role of the teams changed; this was to facilitate posterior analysis using the Kinovea\u00ae software (Open Source). For the observation, an ad hoc observation instrument described by Anguera et al. [21] was adapted using the individual and collective defensive behaviors concepts defined by Anton [26] (pp. 140\u2013155) and completed by Anton [27] (pp. 143\u2013150) (Table 1). This instrument contemplated a system of exhaustive non-exclusive categories that give theoretical support to the observation. A group of 3 observers, all of them handball coaches, were trained to analyze handball\u00b4s individual and collective defensive skills through the observational methodology. A professional handball expert with experience in observational methodology research performed the training for the observers. As an initial phase, the expert gathered with the observers to consider and clarify any doubts they may have had about the observation process. A pilot video was given to the observers to practice the observational methodology in which the results of the observations were similar in all three coaches. In the second phase, a video of sessions 1, 2, and 3 were given to each observer in a different order to be analyzed. In this way, each observer got a different sequence of sessions to reduce the influence of the original structured order. As a third phase, each observer had to qualify the player\u2019s behaviors in each observed situation as NP (Non-Performed): Every time the player should perform the action, but she didn\u00b4t; EP (Effectively Performed): Every time the player performed a correct action as the situation need it; NN (Non-Necessary): Every time a defensive behavior was not necessary to be performed.\nChildren 2023, 10, 469 6 of 12\nFinally, all the results were arranged in an Excel (USA)\u00ae spreadsheet using a numeric code for each qualification (NP = 0; EP = 1, NN = 2) to determine the final amount of observation correctly performed."

These handball\u2019s defensive motor behaviors presented an average frequency of 23 observed actions above the same behaviors during constraint 2 and an average of 46 above constrai t one (Figure 4).\nFinally, constraint 2 was the one which has activated more collective actions such as \u201cTimely helps,\u201d \u201cDefensive Tilt,\u201d \u201cChange of Oppositions,\u201d \u201cDeterrence,\u201d and \u201cDefensive Adjustment\u201d compared with constraints 1 and 3. However, constraint 3 has activated in a higher frequency two of the aforementioned behaviors while constraint 1 only activated a few behaviors in a lower amount."

In handball, to defend against any offensive action, there are several technics and tactical skills which respond to three basic pillars that always have to be accomplished during the whole game: to avoid attackers from getting near their zone of effectiveness, to avoid attackers from shooting at the goal, and to recover the ball at any given opportunity [30\u201332].

In handball, to defend against any offensive action, there are several technics and tactical skills which respond to three basic pillars that always have to be accomplished during the whole game: to avoid attackers from getting near their zone of effectiveness, to avoid attackers from shooting at the goal, and to recover the ball at any given opportunity [30\u201332]. The results found in the present study are coincident with the aforementioned, as the specific handball motor behaviors that were activated the most with the thre diff rent c nstra nts were \u201cDe ense in Line of Progr ssi n\u201d d \u201cProximal Contact,\u201d which are the basic individual conducts that the defenders must have in order to defend the attacker to avoid them to get near to their zone of effectiveness [32]. However, a difference is given in the third constraint, where these motor behaviors were activated more compared with constraints 1 and 2, where the frequency of activation was the same for both (57 observed actions). This was probably given due to the participation of a player as the role of the pivot, who was able to move through the central zone, where the attackers had to leave the ball to accomplish the goal. In this sense, as far the attackers were from the pivot to give\nChildren 2023, 10, 469 10 of 12\nher a pass, the higher the possibility of the defenders avoiding the attacker to achieve their goal [33\u201335]. Regarding the motor behaviors of \u201cHarassment\u201d and \u201cDeterrence,\u201d these were slightly activated during constraint one. This may have happened due to the lack of receivers of a pass, as all attackers had a ball in their possession at the beginning of the exercise. In addition, the limitations that attackers in possession of the ball have in terms of mobility throughout the court compared with defenders due to the rules of the game [31] probably had impulse these lasts to stay near the central zone waiting for the attackers to use their cycle of steps to approach, as they couldn\u2019t throw the ball but just leave it on the ground in the central zone. However, in constraints two and three, these motor behaviors increased their frequency of activation as expected due to the addition of attackers without a ball, which allowed at-tackers higher mobility through the court (constraint two) and the addition of a pivot who could enter to the central zone to receive a pass (constraint three). These conducts during all constraints are coincident with the modern defensive systems that are more open and profound, as seen in the latest international handball tournaments when attackers are skilled in distance shooting or closed when the attackers are skillful in the one-against-one but not in the distance shooting [36]. Particularly constraint two was the only one that activated in a high frequency of actions the two collective motor behaviors, \u201cTimely helps\u201d and \u201cDefensive Tilt\u201d. As mentioned before, this constraint allowed more attackers to move unlimitedly through the court, with the exception of the central zone, prioritizing movements in width over those in-depth toward it. In general, the attackers tend to seek free space to penetrate into the central zone, as often is done in the real game in young female teams [37,38]. The logical response to this tactical action is to increase the number of players in the zone where the attacker wants to penetrate in order to persuade the attacker to make a pass or to help in defense when the attacker tries a one-against-one. These defensive responses are commonly proposed in the literature as the basic tactical strategy against the attack. In addition, the study of Musa & Menezes [39] about coaches\u2019 opinion on defense skills in young handball players has declared that double marking and staying close together (Timely Helps and Defensive Tilt synonyms) are the basic defensive motor behaviors that young players under 14 must dominate as a prerequisite to training in the subsequent category. In this sense, as the players in our study belong to different U16 teams, it can be expected that in addition to the individual defensive motor behavior used to avoid attackers from reaching the central zone, \u201cTimely helps\u201d and \u201cDefensive Tilt\u201d were performed. The handball\u2019s motor behavior of \u201cBall Interception\u201d, \u201cChange of Oppositions\u201d, and \u201cBall Interception during Dribbling\u201d were all slightly activated in all three constraints. The explanation for this is that in most of the attacks in every session, dribbling was barely used, passes were often given far away from the defense, and crosses of the attacker were not given regularly, except for the constrain two that activate \u201cChange of Opposition\u201d 21 times. However, these crosses were not significant in reaching the goal. One of the main limitations of our research has been the difficulty of limiting the order effect that sessions may have had on the results. However, as this is an observational study, the results are a description of what has been observed. Also, a second difficulty was finding data regarding technical and tactical skills in young female handball players, as most of the studies refer to strength and conditioning training or anthropometric profiles. However, there was enough literature from well-known international handball coaches that helped the present discussion."
