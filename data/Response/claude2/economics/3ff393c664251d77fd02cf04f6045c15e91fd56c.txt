 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Develop more sophisticated bidding strategies for the consumers to further improve market efficiency. The current linear supply function bidding can be extended to piecewise linear or quadratic bidding functions. 

2. Consider network reconfiguration as an additional control option for the DSO to alleviate congestions and voltage issues. The interactions between network topology control and flexibility procurement can be studied.

3. Extend the model to a multi-period setting and design mechanisms for procuring flexibility services in day-ahead and real-time markets. Issues like commitment and ramping constraints can be incorporated.

4. Study the interactions between the distribution-level flexibility market and wholesale electricity markets. Co-optimization frameworks can be developed for the independent system operator and distribution system operator. 

5. Implement the proposed market mechanism on a real distribution network with distributed energy resources and test it experimentally. This can provide insights into real-world challenges and limitations.
