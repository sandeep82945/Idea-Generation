1. **Investigate the impact of model architecture and training parameters on the emergent behavior of LLM-generated agents in social dilemmas.** This could involve comparing the behavior of different LLM models, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and BLOOM, or varying the training parameters used to train the models.
2. **Examine the role of social norms and reciprocity in shaping the behavior of LLM-generated agents in social dilemmas.** This could involve designing experiments that manipulate the social norms or reciprocity expectations of the agents and observing how their behavior changes.
3. **Explore the use of reinforcement learning to train LLM-generated agents to cooperate in social dilemmas.** This could involve training agents to maximize their expected utility in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma or other social dilemmas.
4. **Investigate the transferability of cooperation strategies learned by LLM-generated agents to real-world settings.** This could involve deploying LLM-generated agents in real-world social dilemmas, such as online marketplaces or social media platforms, and observing how they interact with human participants.
5. **Develop new methods for evaluating the cooperation propensity of LLM-generated agents.** This could involve developing new metrics or experimental designs that more accurately capture the ability of agents to cooperate in social dilemmas.
