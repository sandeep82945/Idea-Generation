    "abstractText": "This paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental validation of CapsuleBot, a compact hybrid aerialground vehicle designed for long-term covert reconnaissance. CapsuleBot combines the manoeuvrability of bicopter in the air with the energy efficiency and noise reduction of ground vehicles on the ground. To accomplish this, a structure named actuatedwheel-rotor has been designed, utilizing a sole motor for both the unilateral rotor tilting in the bicopter configuration and the wheel movement in ground mode. CapsuleBot comes equipped with two of these structures, enabling it to attain hybrid aerialground propulsion with just four motors. Importantly, the decoupling of motion modes is achieved without the need for additional drivers, enhancing the versatility and robustness of the system. Furthermore, we have designed the full dynamics and control for aerial and ground locomotion based on the bicopter model and the two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle model. The performance of CapsuleBot has been validated through experiments. The results demonstrate that CapsuleBot produces 40.53% less noise in ground mode and consumes 99.35% less energy, highlighting its potential for long-term covert reconnaissance applications.",

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, although significant progress has been made in unmanned systems, particularly in unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), across a range of industries including search and rescue, exploration, transportation, monitoring, and more, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] the pursuit of excellence in design and complex applications is still ongoing.\nIn the field of covert reconnaissance, UGVs are highly regarded for their low noise, low energy consumption, and stable ground mobility, making them ideal for prolonged and extensive covert reconnaissance missions [6]. However, their limited ground movement capability and relatively large size restrict their delivery radius and prevent them from performing targeted landing sites during airdrops. Moreover, in environments characterized by extensive urban operations and battlefield ruins, UGVs face various uncertain obstacles that can significantly impede their vision and action, ultimately\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52175032, the \u201cPioneer\u201d and \u201cLeading Goose\u201d R&D Program of Zhejiang under Grant 2023C01070, and Robotics Institute of Zhejiang University under Grant K12107 and K11805.\n\u2020 Equal contribution. 1The State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems, School of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China. 2Robotics Institute of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China. 3Robotics Research Center of Yuyao City, Ningbo 315400, China. 4School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore.\nEmail: {z.z, dwjcom}@zju.edu.cn Corresponding author: Jin Wang.\nreducing mission efficiency. In contrast, UAVs with flight capabilities exhibit excellent maneuverability in exploring unstructured and challenging environments [7]. They can rapidly reach target areas, provide aerial surveillance, overcome obstacles, and achieve comprehensive reconnaissance. However, UAVs are also constrained by payload capacity, flight time limitations, and susceptibility to collision damage. Additionally, they encounter difficulties in conducting covert reconnaissance over extended periods of time and maneuvering in narrow spaces.\nHybrid aerial-ground vehicles have been extensively studied as a potential solution for mobility in complex environments, as they can combine the advantages of flight and ground locomotion. However, there are limited solutions available that meet the aforementioned requirements. The use of propellers to drive the ground mode [8] [9] [10] results in significant noise and dust, while the coupling of movement modes often leads to poor system adaptability. Active terrestrial locomotion systems using walking [11] or climbing [12] have the ability to handle rough terrain at the cost of complex connections or slow movement. In this context, a vehicle structure with active wheels appears to be a more effective mechanical design. One simple solution is to mount the UGV directly under the UAV [13] [14], but this approach significantly reduces flight efficiency due to the additional load. Although there are challenges in the stable transitions between motion modes, some designs have successfully improved the integration of multi-modal ar X\niv :2\n30 9.\n09 22\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\n7 Se\np 20\n23\nvehicles and optimized the overall weight of the platform through fuselage deformation [15], reconstruction [16], and transformation [17]. These designs have also demonstrated better maneuverability in navigating through small openings.\nIn this paper, we present the design of a compact hybrid aerial-ground robot called CapsuleBot. The main objective of this robot is to perform covert reconnaissance missions for extended periods. To achieve this, we combine the aerial agility of a bicopter with the energy efficiency and noise reduction capabilities of a two-wheel self-balancing robot when it operates on the ground. This innovative design is based on the concept of actuated-wheel-rotor. By incorporating two of these structures, CapsuleBot is capable of achieving hybrid motion using only four motors. This not only enhances its versatility but also eliminates the need for additional drivers. Furthermore, we address the issue of wire winding during ground locomotion by implementing slip rings.\nCompared to previous multi-rotor hybrid aerial-ground vehicles, CapsuleBot\u2019s actuated-wheel-rotor provides enhanced ground maneuverability. This design minimizes the risk of sensory degradation and body damage by eliminating the dusty generation caused by propeller whirling. Additionally, the smaller movement noise ensures that CapsuleBot can go undetected during covert reconnaissance missions. Furthermore, the compactness and energy efficiency of the bicopter make the robot particularly suitable for certain long-term\ntasks, such as cave exploration and pipeline inspection. A bicopter consumes 30% less power than a quadrotor of the same weight and size [18] , making it more efficient. The smaller radial size also allows the vehicle to roll through narrow gaps. Fig. 2 illustrates an envisioned search and reconnaissance example.\nThe comprehensive dynamics and control system, which incorporates models of both the bicopter and self-balancing robot, has been validated through experiments. These experiments have shown a significant 40.53% reduction in noise and an impressive 99.35% decrease in energy consumption during ground mode. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CapsuleBot as a covert and persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform. CapsuleBot is capable of loitering near a target for extended periods of time.\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as: \u2022 A novel compact hybrid aerial-ground robot with two\nactuated wheel-rotors is proposed and built. This robot utilizes a single motor for both the unilateral rotor tilt in the bicopter configuration and the wheel motion in ground mode. \u2022 Comprehensive dynamics modeling and controller design are conducted, encompassing both aerial and ground locomotion. \u2022 Experimental results confirm the performance of CapsuleBot in different modes and demonstrate its high energy efficiency and low noise level in ground mode. \u2022 Two challenging missions are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of CapsuleBot in traversing regions with different types of obstacles."

The robot\u2019s main body is designed with axial symmetry and constructed using a carbon fiber frame (Fig. 3 (5)). To enhance safety and aesthetics, a spherical propeller protector is incorporated (Fig. 3 (4)). This protector is made from 3D printed ABS material, known for its partial elasticity and ability to absorb impact energy, thereby protecting the robot from potential damage during impacts. The system is powered by a 3000 mAh 6s 75c battery (Fig. 3 (8)).\nIn flight mode, we utilize two motors (Fig. 3 (7)) to control the tilt of the rotors (Fig. 3 (1)) through gearing (Fig. 3 (6)), resulting in a bicopter configuration. To generate thrust, the vehicle is equipped with T-MOTOR F90 1500KV rotors and 6-inch three-blade propellers, which have a diameter of 26 cm. For flight control and electronic speed regulation, we employ the Holybro Pix32 v6 flight controller and FLYCOLOR 45A ESC (Fig. 3 (2)).\nIn ground mode, we utilize the same motors that are used to tilt the rotors (Fig. 3 (5)). These motors drive carbon fiber wheels with a diameter of 25 cm through gearing. This design choice aims to minimize energy consumption,\nachieve low noise levels, and reduce the risk of sensory degradation and body damage caused by propeller erosion in dusty environments. The wheels are designed with two rigidly attached carbon fibre frames to ensure robustness and durability. Additionally, to address the issue of wire winding for the rotor during wheeled motion, we have incorporated slip rings (Fig. 3 (3) and (11))."

This level of performance not only satisfies the thrust requirements in this mode but also remains below the upper limits of both the ESC and slip ring in terms of current.\nIn ground mode, after the robot is activated, the motor rotates to generate torque based on the instructions provided by the flight controller. This torque is then transmitted through the gear transmission (Fig. 3(10)), with a transmission ratio of i = 16 : 25. It is important to note that the rotor only operates in flight mode and remains inactive in ground mode.\nThis approach enables our robot, CapsuleBot, to be designed in a compact manner and capable of both land and air movement, with low noise levels and reduced energy consumption. Through the effective combination of these mechanisms, the proposed CapsuleBot demonstrates significant potential for long-term covert reconnaissance applications."

The aerial mode of the robot is tested while it is connected to the flight control test rack, with the throttle manually maneuvered to 50% to 55%. We allowed the vehicle to run for an extended period of time under these conditions, during which we collected data on energy consumption.\nThe power of aerial mode, denoted as Pa, is 691.4 W (460.9 W/kg), while the power of ground mode, denoted as Pg , is 4.5 W (3 W/kg). Therefore, we can refer to the work [22] to calculate the power efficiency:\n\u03b7 = ( 1\u2212 Pg\nPa\n) \u00d7 100% = 99.35%.

Figure 6 shows the power consumption in different modes.\nIn ground mode, the power consumption is very low at approximately 4.5 W (3 W/kg), and CapsuleBot has the lowest energy consumption and highest power efficiency. In aerial mode, the power consumption of CapsuleBot is not as energy-efficient as the others, possibly due to the spherical propeller protector and the structure of the ground mode.

The sound level monitor is positioned at the center of the circular path, where the wheels rotate at a radius of approximately 1 m. Data collection is continuous throughout the experiment, the specific experimental data can be seen in Fig. 8, with recorded values ranging from a minimum of 49.1 dB to a maximum of 57.4 dB, and an average of 52.42 dB. It is important to note that the ambient noise level when the robot is not in motion is approximately 44.89 dB. Additionally, the noise generated from the motion of the outer wheel, which is approximately 5 m away, averaged 46.28 dB.\nIn the second series of experiments, the robot is connected to the flight control test rack. It begins in an idle state and is manually maneuvered to maintain the throttle at 50% to 55%. The robot is positioned approximately 1 m away from the sound level monitor. In this throttle situation, the robot\u2019s thrust and noise can simulate the actual aerial mode.

Throughout the entire duration of the experiment, the instrument consistently records data, capturing values that range from a minimum of 87.4 dB to a maximum of 89.4 dB, with an average of 88.14 dB.\nThe experimental results, shown in Fig. 8, indicate that the noise level of CapsuleBot in ground mode increases by only 16.77% compared to the ambient noise, decreases by 40.53% compared to the aerial mode (1m). The sound produced by the robot during ground operation is barely audible at a distance of 5 m and is not significantly different from ambient noise.
