INTRODUCTION\nIn pulse-Doppler radar systems, it is typical to estimate the radial velocity by evaluating multiple compressed pulses reflected by a target and estimating the linear phase change over time. It is known that the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), number of processed pulses, carrier wavelength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after pulse compression are the primary contributors to the estimation performance. Crame\u0301rRao bounds (CRBs) of velocity estimation on arrays have been described in [1], [2], but the signal models used typically omit the Doppler velocity in the array response expression since this is considered negligible. When considering multiple pulses in a burst, the fast-time Doppler effect is also commonly omitted.\nNumerous methods exist that aim to reach optimal velocity estimation on arrays [3]. However, such methods do not exploit the extra information given by using large receiver arrays, besides being able to scan more angles of arrival (AoA) and improved SNR. While these methods perform better than conventional pulse-Doppler processing, there may be more room for improvement considering a more complete signal model. Since modern radar systems are realized with increasingly larger arrays, both in terms of physical size and number of elements, such as the Sea-based X-Band Radar [4], it may be time to re-evaluate what this large amount of data allows us to do in terms of parameter estimation.\nIf the array response depends on the radial velocity, it might not be needed to evaluate a pulse train anymore. After all,\nThe work is part of a project funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and the Netherlands Defence Academy (NLDA).\nthe array response can be estimated using pulse compression of single pulses. Single pulse Doppler estimation is typically considered challenging or even infeasible since the phase changes due to Doppler shifts on the reflected waveform are so small they are negligible. However, the array response is an extra source of information on the radial velocity of the target that can be utilized to realize single pulse Doppler estimation.\nSingle pulse Doppler shift estimation can be useful for different reasons. First and foremost, it can be used in adaptive radar systems which rely on frequent and continuous updates of their surroundings to perform parameter optimization and resource allocation. The less \u2018out of date\u2019 the knowledge of the surrounding is, the better such a system should be able to perform [5]. Second, performing Doppler shift estimation on individual pulses from the array does not exclude one from performing the estimation on a burst of pulses as well. In this case, using the additional information granted by the array response, the performance of the Doppler shift estimation on the burst of pulses may improve. Third, [6] argues that single pulse Doppler shift estimation can be used as an alternative to motion compensation algorithms for fast-moving targets which move to different range cells within a full processing interval, or whose motion is not uniform. This particularly also applies to fast-moving targets at long ranges, where PRFs might be low and pulse lengths may be large.\nIn this contribution, we show the variance bounds of estimating the Doppler velocity on single pulses using only the array response, and using both the array response and the shifted radar waveform. We further show a comparison of bounds considering and not considering the array response as a source of information on the Doppler velocity, effectively comparing single pulse Doppler estimation to burst processing. We also introduce a method of estimating the Doppler velocity from the array response for the single target case, using a fast rank-1 matrix approximation and the fast Fourier transform (FFT). While the theoretical bound as well as the practical performance of the method show a large error, there may be a use for such approaches in scenarios of high SNR and/or using receive arrays with large physical aperture. Further, there may be applications in systems with lower wave travel speeds, such as sonar.\n1811ISBN: 978-1-6654-6798-8 EUSIPCO 2022\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Delft Library.

The signal is critically sampled with sampling period Ts. The target is assumed to arrive from zero elevation and as such, we only describe its angle of arrival (AoA) with the azimuth angle \u03b8. Let the Doppler shift due to the target speed be expressed by \u2206\u03bb = ( 1 + 2vrc )\u22121 , which describes the multiplicative change in carrier wavelength \u03bb0, where vr is the radial component of the target speed and c the speed of light. Additionally, let fd = 2vr\u03bb0 be the Doppler frequency, where \u03bb0 is the carrier wavelength.\nWe can then let Y be the received array data of a single reflected pulse, given by\nY = asT + V \u2208 CM\u00d7N , (1)\nwhere, under the assumption of a 2-dimensional Mx \u00d7 My array (thus M =MxMy), we have\na = ax \u2297 ay \u2208 CM , (2) ax = [ z0x z 1 x \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 zMx\u22121x ]T \u2208 CMx , ay = [ z0y z 1 y \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 z My\u22121 y ]T \u2208 CMy ,\nzx = exp { j 2\u03c0d\u03bb \u2206\u03bb sin \u03b8 } , (3)\nzy = exp { j 2\u03c0d\u03bb \u2206\u03bb cos \u03b8 } , (4)\nand s \u2208 CN is, as mentioned before, a vector describing the reflected unimodulus radar waveform as it arrives at the array, including the fast-time Doppler effect.

The radar cross section could\nbe included explicitly, but the constant phase shift within a pulse is of no concequence to the discussion of this work and we normalize such that |sn| = 1 for all n. The entries of V \u2208 CM\u00d7N are the noise realizations, which are drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance \u03c32, and the noise is spatially and temporally uncorrelated. The preprocessing SNR is equal to \u03c3\u22122.\nFrom (3) and (4), it should be clear that, if we can estimate the array response, the Doppler shift on the array response can be separated from the angle of arrival."

This is further illustrated by Fig. 2a where\nGain = CRB(v\u0302r)|\u03b1=0,\u03b3=0\nCRB(v\u0302r) (9)\nis plotted, indicating the improvement in CRB when the Doppler effect on the array is considered instead of neglected. This confirms that neglecting the Doppler effect on the array response when multiple pulses are available is valid since the listening time in that scenario is dictating the estimation performance bound. As a result, it looks like there are few scenarios where considering the Doppler effect on the array response in the signal model is worth considering. One example of when it may be beneficial still to consider the Doppler effect in the array response model is when a waveform with rangeDoppler coupling is used, such as linear frequency modulated waveforms.\nAlso, increasing the element spacing d\u03bb beyond 12 increases the contribution of the array information for velocity estimation. While this should result in spatial aliasing, it\ncan be mitigated by having sub-arrays with smaller element spacing. This way of distributing multiple antennas over a large aperture by considering multiple subarrays is similar to how multiple pulses can be distributed over a larger period of time. The bound for different amounts of antennas with different element spacings is shown in Fig. 2b."

            "text": "From Section III, it seems of little use to attempt to estimate a target velocity from the array response in general. However, it will not always be possible to perform processing on the target reflected pulse on all array elements, due to hardware constraints. If one would still desire to perform single pulse velocity estimation, there may be no other choice but to perform the estimation using the array response estimate.\nFor the single target, single pulse case, we can perform a rank-1 estimation of the array response matrix A = axaTy . We obtain A\u0302 by performing a matched filter operation on each array element individually. Let a\u0302 be the estimated array response given by a\u0302 = Y hMF, where\nhMF = s\u2217 \u2016s\u201622 = s\u2217 N . (10)\nWe can then restructure the obtained estimate a\u0302 to obtain\nA\u0302 = a\u0302xa\u0302 T y , (11)\ni.e., the resulting matrix resembles the topography of the array. Once we have estimated this array response matrix, we perform a compact singular value decomposition (cSVD)1 on it to obtain the left and right singular vectors associated with the largest singular value: u1 and v1, respectively. By (11) we can then say that u1 \u223c ax and v1 \u223c ay up to some scalar ambiguity. We then need to find the dominant normalized frequency of these vectors, which should both approximate d\u03bb ( 1 + 2vrc ) .\nTo find these dominant frequencies, we propose to use an FFT. It should be noted that to obtain a good estimation resolution, one would either need to use a very long FFT, apply methods such as [7] or perform a short local search after finding a coarse estimate. We will not further describe such, already well-documented, extensions here and will simply use long FFT lengths to obtain a sufficiently finely sampled spectrum.\nWhen the planar array is not uniform, but if the planar array response vector can be written as the Kronecker product of two non-uniform linear array response vectors (similar to (2)), then a type-II nonuniform discrete Fourier transform [8] can be employed instead of an ordinary FFT.\nThe frequency estimates can be combined to find the AoA and velocity. To keep the discussion concise, we assume the AoA known and the frequency estimate are combined in a weighted average according to the array dimensions. The velocity estimation procedure is summarized by Alg. 1.\n1A cSVD only calculates an amount of singular values, and left and right singular vectors up to the given rank of the input matrix.\n1813\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Delft Library.

This quantity can be considered the SNR after matched filter. In practice, this SNR may drop when there is a mismatch between target velocity and the specific matched filter(s) that are used. As discussed in Section IV, the length of the FFT here is large to obtain a sufficiently finely sampled spectrum. This number can be reduced in practice while maintaining resolution, as discussed earlier.\nFig. 3 summarizes the results of the Monte-Carlo simulations by showing the 3-sigma values of the simulation outputs for a few different arrays and ( S N ) MF values. There is a considerable difference in the performance of the estimator and the CRB (a factor > 2), likely due to the multi-stage approach and the considerable sensitivity of the velocity parameter."

            "text": "We have presented a method of estimating the Doppler velocity on uniform planar arrays using the outputs of matched filters, i.e., the estimated array response. This method reduces the size of the problem and uses common algorithms that are efficiently implementable. However, the method does not achieve the presented variance bound. By inspection of the variance bound in Figs. 2 and 3, we conclude that such methods will be primarily useful in (sparse) arrays with large\n1814\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Delft Library.

Restrictions apply.\napertures and/or for long Doppler-tolerant pulses, with applications such as early warning systems for very fast targets, where an order-of-magnitude estimation is sufficient.\nWe can show through the variance bounds that the gain from using the array response as an extra source of information on the velocity is negligible in most other scenarios. In scenarios where this extra source of information might be helpful, a method to estimate the velocity from the full data model, instead of only the array response or only the slow-time pulses, may be beneficial. This remains as future work.\nOur signal model results in a similar data structure as some models used in MIMO radar estimation methods [9], [10]. They present methods to solve the rootMUSIC algorithm for two variables. Such estimation methods may be adapted to the problem presented in this work, though their complexity, especially for significantly large arrays, may be too high. Conversely, our method may be applied to find the angle of departure and AoA in the single target case of [9], as a low complexity alternative to double rootMUSIC.\nSimilarly, the rootMUSIC polynomial could be solved through \u03bb-matrix latent-root-finding [11], [12]. While such methods were considered, the specific form of our problem did not allow for low-complexity methods of solving such polynomials since our \u03bb-matrix is neither regular nor coregular."
