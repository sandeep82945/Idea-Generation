    "abstractText": "In this paper, we devise a forward-looking methodology to determine efficient credit portfolios under the IFRS 9 framework. We define and implement a credit loss model based on prospective point-in-time probabilities of default. We determine these probabilities of default and the credits\u2019 stage allocation through a credit stochastic simulation. This simulation is based on the estimation of transition matrices. Using data from 1981 to 2019, in a non-homogeneous Markov chain setting, we estimate transition matrices conditional on the global real gross domestic product growth. This allows considering the effects of the economic cycle, which are of great importance in bank management. Finally, we develop a robust optimization model that allows the bank manager to analyze the tradeoff between the annual average portfolio income and the corresponding portfolio volatility. According to the proposed bi-objective model, we compute the efficient credit portfolios constructed based on 10-year maturity credits. We compare their structure to those generated by the IAS 39 and CECL accounting frameworks. The results indicate that the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks generate efficient credit portfolios whose structure penalizes riskier-rated credits. In turn, the riskier efficient credit portfolios under the IAS 39 framework concentrate entirely on speculative-grade credits. This pattern is also encountered in efficient credit portfolios constructed based on credits with different maturities, namely 5 and 15 years. Moreover, the longer the maturity of the credits that enter into the composition of the efficient portfolios, the more the speculative-grade credits tend to be penalized.

            "text": "Before the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08, the credit losses of a banks\u2019 portfolio credit were assessed based on the incurrent loss (IL) approach settled by the International Accounting Standard No 39 \u2014 IAS 39 (IASB, 2004). Under the IL approach, institutions should not account for expected credit losses arising from future events. Several authors see this procedure as one of the causes of the depth of the Global Financial Crisis (FSF, 2009) and nicknamed it as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d (BCBS, 2015).\nIn response to the criticism of the IL approach, the International Accounting Standards Board issued the International Financial Reporting Standard No 9 (IFRS 9) (IFRS, 2017) on July 24, 2014, which become mandatory on January 1, 2018. One of the key aspects of IFRS 9 lies in the shift from the IL approach to an expected credit loss (ECL) approach. Nevertheless, this ECL approach brings a lot of subjectivity about measuring future losses and requires a greater amount of information. This contrasts with the IAS 39 framework, where the losses were measured based on objective facts.\nAccording to IFRS 9, each bank can define its own internal credit loss model. Typically, the ECL computation (KPMG, 2017) is based on the product of the loss given default by the corresponding point-in-time probability of default (Andrija, 2019; Chawla et al., 2016). Moreover, this computation must contemplate three stages (Taylor, 2017). Stage 1 corresponds to the case where the financial asset has no deterioration in credit quality since acquisition. For a financial asset classified in stage 1, financial institutions should use the one-year ECL and recognize interest income on a gross basis. The occurrence of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since acquisition leads to the transfer of the financial asset to stage 2. In stage 2, the lifetime ECL should be recognized and the interest income is computed as in stage 1 (i.e., on a gross basis). Allocation to stage 3 occurs when a financial asset is credit-impaired. In this stage, institutions should compute interest income on a net basis (i.e., gross carrying amount less the ECL).\nIFRS 9 generally applies to most countries. However, the United States of America is a relevant exception since it uses the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP). Under the US GAAP update, issued in June 2016 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB, 2016), similarly to IFRS 9, businesses should implement the credit loss model based on the prospective credit loss (ECL instead of an IL approach). However, this computation deploys the current expected credit loss (CECL) framework, i.e., always applies the lifetime ECL based on point-in-time probabilities of default. Avoiding defining SICR and stage allocation constitutes the main point of divergence from IFRS 9. The CECL model will be mandatory to all institutions in January 2023 (FASB, 2019).\nThe introduction of the Basel I accord in 1988 (BIS, 1998) had triggered the discussion around the potential procyclical effects of banks\u2019 decisions. In periods of economic downturn, there tends to be a depletion of bank capital through the deterioration of credit portfolios. In these periods, banks need more capital to meet the minimum regulatory requirements when access to capital is scarce. Therefore, in economic downturns, banks tend to avoid the investment in high-risk credits precisely when the economy yearns for this kind of investment. More recently, the literature has analyzed the procyclical effects\nof the different impairment accounting frameworks, namely IFRS 9, IAS 39, and CECL. Aligned with the opinion of policymakers, Laeven and Majnoni, 2003 have found empirical evidence that most banks delay provisioning for deteriorated credits until too late, when cyclical downturns have already occurred, therefore amplifying the impact of the economic cycle on the banks\u2019 income and capital. Laeven and Majnoni, 2003 agree that provisioning based on a forward-looking approach, as introduced by the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks, reduces the procyclical effects.\nBalla and McKenna, 2009 argue that an accounting setting based in the IL model, as the IAS 39 framework, can be suboptimal to avoid bank failures and in the efficiency of credit bank investment/lending. On the one hand, the authors defend that the risk of bank insolvency increases when provisioning occurs after the economic downturn. On the other hand, they defend that the increase of the credit loss reserves, when the economy is in contraction, leads to procyclical effects.\nThe most recent work suggesting that IFRS 9 has fewer procyclical effects than IAS 39 is the study performed by Buesa et al., 2019. In an empirical exercise based on Italian mortgages from 2006 to 2018, Buesa et al., 2019 have modeled the impact of credit impairments on the Profit and Loss (P&L) statement under the three impairment accounting frameworks: IAS 39, IFRS 9, and CECL. The results suggest that IFRS 9 is less procyclical than IAS 39 and more procyclical than the CECL framework. Nevertheless, the lower procyclicality of the CECL framework comes with a significant increase in provisions.\nIn the same direction, there are other studies in the literature suggesting that IFRS 9 has fewer procyclical effects than IAS 39 (see, e.g., BCBS, 2009, FSF, 2009 and Wezel et al., 2012). However, this issue is far from being consensual in the literature.\nRecently, Abad and Suarez, 2020 have been defending that the estimation of future credit losses under the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks is challenging. These standards would be countercyclical only if the modelers were able to predict turning points in the cycle or the occurrence of crises (as the case of the recent COVID 19 pandemic) two or three years in advance (Abad & Suarez, 2020). These authors have shown empirical evidence that the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks will raise the credit loss provisions more suddenly than the IAS 39 approach when the economy switches from expansion to contraction. As a consequence, the P&L and the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio will decline more severely (Abad & Suarez, 2018) at the beginning of downturns under IFRS 9 and CECL.\nThese results are similar to the study performed in Barclays, 2017, which concludes that forward-looking approaches, such as IFRS 9 and CECL, may amplify and not reduce the effect of an unexpected increase in risk. Seitz et al., 2018 go further by exposing the high sensitivity of the ECL to the probability of default model used to estimate the corresponding probabilities of default. The point-in-time estimation of the probabilities of default could imply a severe deterioration of the banks\u2019 capital when the economy starts to contract, since the banks could not anticipate this adverse shift (ESRB, 2017).\nIFRS 9 is, at the time of writing (June 2021), a subject of great debate in light of the current coronavirus crisis. Anticipating the inability of debtors to pay back and the moratoriums given by banks worldwide, government officials have created relief measures\nto delay the full impact of IFRS 9 so that these moratoriums, for instance, are not immediately recognized as losses. The authorities have thus given flexibility to banks on adopting the assessment of the likeliness to pay (ECB, 2020; EC, 2020). These findings highlight the great importance of IFRS 9. However, to our knowledge, there is no current literature that establishes optimal credit portfolios under the IFRS 9 framework. Many specialists and strategists have anticipated stylized impacts in the business model of banks and consequently in the credit portfolios (McKinsey & Co., 2017). For instance, there will be incentives to shorten the maturity of credits and steer away from lower ratings. However, there exists no quantitative methodology to guide a bank manager in selecting a credit portfolio.\nKnowing that accounting standards impact banking asset allocation (Argimon et al., 2015) and motivated by the lack of a methodology for credit portfolio allocation under IFRS 9, we design a quantitative method to compute efficient credit portfolios under IFRS 9. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) we devise a methodology to determine the efficient credit portfolios under IFRS 9 and compare their structure to those generated by the IAS 39 and CECL frameworks; (2) we identify the accounting frameworks that imply a lower allocation to riskier credit portfolios, which have higher refinancing needs during economic recessions; thus, we add this element to the discussion of the procyclical effects of the different impairment accounting frameworks. Note that if efficient credit portfolios under a particular accounting framework allocate less to riskier credits, this behavior can lead to procyclical effects. In fact, in periods of economic downturn, cash-hungry corporations will find it more difficult to obtain bank financing precisely when they most need it.\nUnder IFRS 9, we assume that the bank manager aims to select a credit portfolio, constructed with global credits with different ratings (from AAA to B, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s RatingsDirect\u00ae, 2014) at the acquisition date. As a standard practice in banking, the credits are classified at amortized cost according to the IFRS 9 framework. Hence, the investment horizon is coincident with the credit maturity. As a baseline case, we assume that each credit has a maturity of 10 years. Furthermore, we posit that the bank manager has a certain amount to invest in the credits, and selects the credit portfolio at the end of 2019, i.e., data until the end of 2019 is assumed to be known.\nFollowing the IFRS 9 framework, we begin by defining the credit impairment model by which the bank manager can compute the annual credit income. The definition that we adopt in this paper relies on estimating the credit probability of default to calculate ECL, in line with practice (KPMG, 2017).\nThen, to simulate the credit dynamics, we make use of the one-year transition matrices reported annually by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) (see, e.g., Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings, 2019). We collect annual data from 1981 to 2019. These matrices refer to global corporate bonds that we use as a proxy of global credit data. Since cyclical macroeconomic effects are crucial to bank management, we estimate the transition matrices conditional on the real global gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\nThe most common approaches to estimate conditional transition matrices are based on the one-factor model suggested in the CreditMetricsTM (J. P. Morgan & Co., 1997) or\non numerical adjustments (see, e.g., Jarrow et al., 1997). A comparison between these two approaches can be found in Tr\u00fcck, 2008. In this paper, we closely follow the one-factor model approach, constructing a credit cycle measure determined by the real global GDP growth. The construction of the credit cycle measure is based on the historical inverse relationship between the speculative-grade ratings (BB, B, and C/CCC) probabilities of default and the global real GDP growth.\nAssuming a non-homogeneous Markov chain model (Br\u00e9maud, 2020) for the conditional transition matrices, we simulate the dynamics of 6,000 credits (1,000 for each rating grade from AAA to B) from acquisition date until maturity. As a result of this stochastic simulation, we determine the stage allocation, according to IFRS 9, for each simulated credit.\nTo implement the defined credit loss model, we need to compute the probabilities of default for each credit rating grade. IFRS 9 states that these probabilities should be estimated taking into account the economic credit cycle, i.e., should be point-in-time (Andrija, 2019; Chawla et al., 2016). Therefore, we evaluate these point-in-time probabilities of default conditional on several different projections for the global real GDP growth. More specifically, for each different prediction of the global real GDP growth, we estimate the corresponding conditional transition matrix, whose last column gives us the point-in-time probabilities of default for each credit rating grade.\nOnce specified the credit dynamics and estimated the point-in-time probabilities of default, we compute the credit income for each simulated credit. Then, we identify a representative credit, for each rating grade, that corresponds to a weighted average of the 1,000 simulated credits. Finally, based on the annual income of each representative credit, we suggest a forward-looking bi-objective optimization model whose solution allows the bank manager to directly analyze the tradeoff between the portfolio income and the corresponding portfolio volatility. We show how to tackle such a bi-objective problem by solving different convex optimization quadratic problems.\nWe use the suggested forward-looking bi-objective optimization model over 100 generated scenarios where each scenario corresponds to a global real GDP growth path. With the resulting solutions and following the robust resampling methodology proposed in Michaud and Michaud, 2007; Michaud and Michaud, 2008, we compute the robust average efficient Pareto frontier not only for the IFRS 9 framework but also for the IAS 39 and CECL frameworks. We finish our analysis by evaluating the composition of the efficient portfolios for varying maturities.\nGlobally, the results indicate that the efficient credit portfolios constructed under IFRS 9 and CECL have a structure that penalizes riskier-grade rated credits, namely speculative-grade credits. Under IAS 39, we no longer observe such a pattern. On the contrary, we notice that the more volatile efficient portfolios under IAS 39 tend to have a structure entirely concentrated in speculative-grade credits. We encounter this pattern in the efficient portfolios with the different maturities considered: 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years. Moreover, based on these three maturities, the results indicate that the longer the maturity, the more the riskier-grade rated credits tend to be penalized. This finding holds under the three accounting frameworks.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the entire methodology to estimate the credit income under the IFRS 9, IAS 39, and CECL frameworks. In Section 3 we develop the forward-looking robust bi-objective model that allows us to identify, under the different accounting frameworks, efficient portfolios in the correspondent income-risk bi-dimensional space. In Section 4 we present and analyze the results on the robust efficient Pareto frontiers computed under the IFRS 9, IAS 39, and CECL frameworks. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper."

            "text": "Let us assume that a bank manager wants to construct a credit portfolio from a set of global credits under IFRS 9. According to the S&P Global Rating Classification System (Standard & Poor\u2019s RatingsDirect\u00ae, 2014), we consider that each global credit can be classified with one of eight rating grades: AAA, AA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, C/CCC, and D. The rating grades from AAA to BBB correspond to investment-grade ratings, from BB to C/CCC to speculative-grade ratings, and the D corresponds to the default state.\nWe assume that the bank manager disposes of a funding amount, F , to invest in the set of global credits. Each global credit has a rating grade not inferior to B1.\nFollowing the IFRS 9 classification system (IFRS, 2017), we assume that the global credits are classified at amortized cost. We use this particular assumption for two reasons: 1) it is the standard accounting classification for loans, and 2) the vast majority of assets in the bank\u2019s balance sheet are classified under this category.\nFinally, we assume that all the data until the end of 2019 is known and that the global credits have a 10-year maturity. Motivated by data availability, we use data for global corporate bonds. This allows the reader to reproduce all the results presented in this paper easily. Nevertheless, note that the entire methodology that we develop in the next sections can be applied to any type of credit."

Note that, as the global credit enters in default in year t, then \u03b9G\u03c4 = 0, \u2200\u03c4 = t+ 1, . . . , T .\nThe fixed interest, C, present in equations (1)-(2) corresponds to the coupon value of each global corporate bond classified with a rating grade from AAA to B. Accordingly, for a 10-year maturity, these values are3: 2.302%, 2.483%, 2.670%, 3.173%, 4.684%, 5.391%, for a AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, and B rating grade, respectively.\nThe computation of the impairment stock, L\u03c4 (i.e., the expected credit loss - ECL), in equations (1)-(2), is conditional on the stage allocation. Therefore, the impairment stock is given by\nL\u03c4 =\n\n       \n      \nECL(one-year)\u03c4 = 1\n1 +D \u00d7 LGD \u00d7 PD\u03c4 , if stage 1 at \u03c4,\nECL(lifetime)\u03c4 = LGD \u00d7 T \u2211\nn=\u03c4\nSPn\u22121 \u00d7 PDn (1 +D)n , if stage 2 at \u03c4,\nLGD \u00d7 PD\u03c4 = LGD, if stage 3 at \u03c4,\n(3)\nwhere D is the discount rate, PD\u03c4 is the one-year probability of default in year \u03c4 , and SPi is the survival rate until year i. The discount rate, D, is set equal to 1.828%, i.e., equals the coupon rate of a AAA corporate bond with a 5-year maturity4. In turn, SPi is computed as\nSPi = i \u220f\nj=0\n(1\u2212 PDj), \u2200i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1}, (4)\nwith PD0 = 0. The income under IAS 39 of a non-default global credit at year t = 1, . . . , T will be simply equal to C \u00d7 x. In turn, if the credit enters in default at year t, then the credit income will be given by C \u00d7RR\u00d7 x\u2212 LGD\u00d7 x = [C \u00d7 (1\u2212 LGD)\u2212 LGD]\u00d7 x, and in the subsequent years, until maturity T , will be equal to 0.\nIf, instead, we considered the CECL accounting framework, the credit income will be computed similarly as in the IFRS 9 case. Nevertheless, there is an important difference. In the CECL framework, there is no stage allocation. Accordingly, the credit impairment stock will be computed based on the credit lifetime (i.e., it will be equal to the second case of Equation (3)).\nWithin the IFRS 9 framework, the ECL is computed according to three stages (see Equation 3). As IFRS 9 does not explicitly define a SICR, we follow parsimonious criteria:\n2In this work we consider a constant LGD = 62%. This value is based on the historical average of the RR for unsecured global corporate bonds reported in Moody\u2019s Investors Service, 2019.\n3The values were obtained in the Bloomberg Terminal (Bloomberg, 2021). 4We obtained this value through the Bloomberg Terminal (Bloomberg, 2021).\na credit belongs to stage 1 if it shows no downgrade greater or equal than two grades since acquisition; a credit belongs to stage 2 otherwise.\nFor the credit loss model implementation, we need to model the credit rating dynamics (to determine the stage allocation) and to estimate the probabilities of default5 for each global credit rating. We make use of probability transition matrices for both purposes."

            "heading": "2.2 Estimation of transition matrices",

Similarly to the transition matrix reported for 2019, we have access to all the transition matrices since 1981 (i.e., all the reports from 1981 to 2019 are available).\nThe raw transition matrices disclosed by S&P contain a column titled \u201cN.R.\u201d (Not Rated). Following the standard procedure in the literature (see, e.g., Wei, 2003), we redistribute the \u201cN.R.\u201d portion to the other ratings (leaving the default column unchanged) on a pro-rata basis.\nAs recommended by CreditMetricsTM (J. P. Morgan & Co., 1997) for modeling purposes, we ensure that all transition matrices satisfy some desirable properties: there should not exist non-zero probability events, i.e., all the transitions and defaults should have a non-zero probability; all rows should sum exactly one; all the transition matrices should satisfy the so-called monotonicity constraints, i.e., within each row and column, the values on each side of the diagonal should monotonically decline (for further details see J. P. Morgan & Co., 1997).\nTo ensure that there are non-zero probability events, we consider the existence of a minimum threshold set equal to 1 bp (basis point). Thus, whenever a zero probability arises, we consider that it is equal to the defined threshold, and we subtract this value to the diagonal entry. Moreover, all the rows are modified to sum exactly one by adjusting the corresponding diagonal element.\n5Note that this estimation should be point-in-time. For further details see, e.g., Carruthers et al., 2019.\nRegarding the monotonicity constraints, to minimize excessive adjustments, we strictly follow the parsimonious rules described in Wei, 2003: 1) whenever the column monotonicity is not satisfied, we swap the element in question with the previous element, and we ensure that the sum of each row is equal to one by adjusting the corresponding diagonal elements; 2) whenever the row monotonicity is not satisfied, we set the element in question equal to the previous rating\u2019s element and add the difference to the elements between the diagonal and the element in question. We point out that we may need to apply the monotonicity rules more than once to accomplish a smooth transition matrix.\nFor example, after applying the adjustments described in the previous paragraphs, the smooth version of the 2019 raw transition matrix (see Equation (5)) is equal to\nfrom/to AAA AA A BBB BB B CCC/C D AAA 99.93 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01\nAA 0.01 97.69 2.25 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 A 0.01 0.74 97.21 2.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01\nBBB 0.01 0.01 2.80 95.82 1.29 0.05 0.01 0.01 BB 0.01 0.01 0.08 2.87 91.11 5.48 0.33 0.11\nB 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 2.54 90.09 5.84 1.49 CCC/C 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.63 10.71 58.57 30.05\nD 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n. (6)\nIn Equation (6), we added the last row corresponding to the absorbing state (default state). Repeating this procedure to all the historical transition matrices, from 1981 to 2019, we have a time series of one-year smooth transition matrices, Pt, with t = 1, . . . , 39, that can be represented by\nPt =\n\n    \npt(1, 1) pt(1, 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 pt(1, 8) pt(2, 1) pt(2, 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 pt(2, 8) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 pt(7, 1) pt(7, 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 pt(7, 8) 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1,\n\n     , (7)\nwhere each number from 1 to 8 corresponds to each possible rating grade: AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, C/CCC, and D, respectively.\nWe could model the transition matrices as a homogeneous Markov chain model as in Jarrow et al., 1997. Nevertheless, this will lead to estimation error by not including cyclical effects, which are of great importance in bank management. Instead, in this work, we adopt a non-homogeneous Markov chain model approach (Br\u00e9maud, 2020). Inspired by the CreditMetricsTM (J. P. Morgan & Co., 1997) methodology and closely following the one-factor model presented in Belkin et al., 1998, we assume that the rating transitions reflect an underlying continuous credit-change indicator, ut, such that\nut = ( \u221a 1\u2212 \u03c1xt + \u221a \u03c1ht) \u223c N(0, 1), (8)\nwhere xt represents a standard normal distributed idiosyncratic component, ht represents a standard normal distributed systematic component (shared by all issuers), and \u03c1 corresponds to the correlation between ht and ut. It is assumed that these standard normal random variables are independent.\nIn Equation (8), ht can be interpreted as a measure of the credit cyclical effects. A positive ht shifts the distribution of ut to the right-hand side. In turn, a negative ht shifts the distribution of ut to the left-hand side.\nFigure 1 reports, for the period 1981-2019, the aggregate probabilities of default corresponding to investment-grade6, speculative-grade7, and overall8 ratings. As expected, we observe much more volatility of the speculative-grade probabilities of default in contrast with the more steady behavior of the investment-grade defaults.\nAn interesting fact, that we explore, lies in contrasting the behavior of the speculativegrade probabilities of default (see Figure 1) with the evolution of the real GDP growth9 (see Figure 2).\nBy contrasting figures 1 and 2, we observe a synchronous inverse relationship between the speculative-grade default probabilities and the global real GDP growth. Thus, whenever global real GDP growth goes up, default probabilities go down and vice versa. Moreover, it is well known that non-speculative probabilities of default are insensitive to the economic cycle (see, e.g., Wilson, 1997;Belkin et al., 1998).\nMotivated by these facts, we suggest constructing a credit cycle measure (based on the global real GDP growth) calibrated through BB, B, and CCC/C default probabilities.\nLet PD (S) t be the speculative-grade default probability (i.e., a weighted average of the BB, B and CCC/C probabilities of default) at time t. Inspired in previous works, such as Kr\u00fcger et al., 2018, this probability can be modeled by a probit model\n6Weighted average of AAA, AA, A, and BBB ratings. 7Weighted average of BB, B, and C/CCC ratings. 8Weighted average of investment-grade and speculative-grade ratings. 9Data for the global real GDP growth are publicly available at: https://data.worldbank.org/ (Last\naccessed: June 2021).\nPD (S) t = \u03a6(\u03b1 + \u03b2GDPGt + \u03b5t), (9)\nwhere GDPGt represents the change in the global real GDP from t \u2212 1 to t, \u03a6(\u00b7) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a normal distribution, and \u03b5t represents an error term. Hence, the relationship\n\u03a6\u22121(PD (S) t ) = \u03b1 + \u03b2GDPGt + \u03b5t, (10)\nallow us to estimate the inverse CDF of the speculative-grade default probability. Estimating Equation (10) by ordinary least squares (OLS), for the period 1981-2019, leads to the following estimates: \u03b1\u0302 = \u22121.152 (std. error = 0.131) and \u03b2\u0302 = \u22128.691 (std. error = 4.175). Both estimates are statistically significant at the level of 5%.\nWe can define the credit cycle measure, ht, as\nht = \u2212 ( \u03a6\u22121(PD (S) t )\u2212 \u00b5PD(S) \u03c3PD(S) ) , (11)\nwhere \u00b5PD(S) and \u03c3PD(S) denote, respectively, the average and the standard deviation of the inverse normal distribution of PD (S) t . The minus sign in Equation (11) turns the credit cycle measure positive whenever the GDP growth is greater than its historical average and negative whenever the GDP growth is less than its historical average.\nUsing the estimates of \u03a6\u22121(PD (S) t ), computed according to Equation (10), in Figure 3\nwe report the evolution of h\u0302t during the historical period from 1981 to 2019.\nWith the time series of the one-year smooth transition matrices (see Equation (7)), we can compute an average historical transition matrix, P\u0304 , where each entry is given by\np\u0304i,j = 1\n#TM\n#TM \u2211\nt=1\npt(i, j), \u2200i, j = 1, . . . , 8, (12)\nand #TM corresponds to the number of historical transition matrices (for the period from 1981 to 2019, #TM = 39). Now, we can map the average transition probabilities into credit scores (Belkin et al., 1998).

We have devised a methodology to model transition probabilities matrices conditional on the global real GDP growth (note that h\u0302t is estimated based on Equation (10)). Therefore, we can estimate future transition matrices based on future possible global real GDP growth paths.\nNow, we assume that the bank manager is interested in modeling the global real GDP growth as a linear process, i.e., as an Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average \u2014 ARIMA(p, d, q) model. This choice is in line with several studies in the literature, where GDP growth is modeled as a linear process (see, e.g., Dritsaki, 2015; Arneja et al., 2020). Despite this choice, by no means are we suggesting that this is the model with the best predictive power. To construct a more accurate model in terms of predictive\n10This factor does not take into account the number of observations (i.e., credits) for each row because it is not relevant, since it remains constant across columns (Wei, 2003).\n11Where \u201csuccess\u201d corresponds to a transition from rating i to rating j and \u201cfailure\u201d corresponds to any other transition.\npower, possibly one needs to take into account other sources of information (other than the historical time series). Nevertheless, this investigation is out of the scope of the present study. Here, we assume that the bank manager wants to construct the \u201cbest\u201d linear model based only on the available historical global real GDP growth time series. Surely, the proposed methodology is ready to accommodate any other global real GDP growth model that the reader finds more suitable.\nBased on the Box-Jenkins methodology (Box & Jenkins, 1976), we begin by analyzing the stationarity of the global real GDP growth time series, GDPGt, for the period from 1981 to 2019 (see Figure 2).\nFrom the augmented Dickey-Fuller test (Dickey & Fuller, 1979), we observe that the time series is non-stationarity at a 5% significant level (Dickey-Fuller = \u22123.48; p-value = 0.061). However, the first difference of the time series, \u2206GDPGt, is stationary at a 5% level (Dickey-Fuller = \u22124.03; p-value = 0.019).\nThe next step consists of finding the optimal lags, p and q, of the stationary process\n(\n1\u2212 p \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1iL i\n)\n\u2206GDPGt =\n(\n1 +\nq \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b8iL i\n)\n\u03b5i, (19)\nwhere L is the lag operator, \u03b1i represent the parameters of the autoregressive part of the model, \u03b8i are the parameters of the moving average part, and \u03b5t are the innovations.\nBased on the partial autocorrelogram and autocorrelogram (see Figure 4), we identify an ARIMA(2,1,0) as a possible model12. This model can be estimated through the\n12We have tested all possible combinations of ARIMA(p, 1, 0) with p \u2208 {1, . . . , 10} and the model with\nmaximum likelihood (computed via a state-space representation) where the model\u2019s innovations and correspondent variances are found by a Kalman filter (a detailed implementation of this procedure can be found in Gardner et al., 1980). From the model\u2019s estimation, we get that both autoregressive coefficients are statistically significant at a 5% level (\u03b11 = \u22120.3289, std. error = 0.1508; \u03b12 = \u22120.3664, std. error = 0.1504). The Ljung-Box test (Ljung & Box, 1978) applied to the innovations gives the test statistic Q = 3.997 (p-value = 0.677), which allows us to accept the assumption that the model\u2019s innovations are independent and identically distributed.\nWith the estimated ARIMA(2, 1, 0) model, we can simulate different global real GDP growth paths. Figure 5 displays 100 simulated paths for the next 10 years. In the simulation, we take into account the non-normal behavior of the model\u2019s innovations. The Jarque-Bera test (Jarque & Bera, 1980) applied to the ARIMA(2, 1, 0) innovations gives a test statistic JB = 11.45 (p-value= 0.003), which leads to the rejection of the normal distribution assumption of the innovations. Hence, we have done this simulation using the bootstrap innovations (i.e., according to the empirical distribution of the innovations) instead of unrealistically assuming that they follow a normal distribution. This simulation was performed using the R language (R Core Team, 2017).\nWe observe that the simulated paths (see Figure 5) exhibit plenty of heterogeneity to be assumed as a good approximation for a set of possible economic scenarios.\nthe minimum Akaike\u2019s entropy-based Information Criterion \u2014 AIC (Akaike, 1974) \u2014 is the ARIMA(2,1,0) (AIC= \u2212212.26)."

Fixing a simulated path s (s = 1, . . . , 100), for each year t = 1, . . . , T (with T = 10), we can compute the respective conditional transition matrix, P\u0302t|h\u0302t , according to the methodology described in Section 2.2.

Applying Algorithm 1 to each simulated path of the global real GDP growth leads to the identification of 100 J \u2019s sets that completely establish the credit rating dynamics for each credit from t = 0 to t = T . Therefore, the bank investment manager can now define the stage allocation inherent in the implementation of the credit loss model defined under IFRS 9 (see Section 2.1, for further details).\nWe also use the conditional transition matrices (see Section 2.2) for the estimation of the point-in-time probabilities of default.

With these probabilities, we can compute the impairment stock (see Equation (3)) for any simulated global credit.\nWe now possess all the data needed to compute, for each s-scenario (s = 1, . . . , 100),\nthe annual credit\u2019s income, from year t = 1 to year t = T (with T = 10), for each simulated credit k = 1, . . . , 6, 000. Let us designate the credit\u2019s income from a credit k in the s-scenario and at year t, as Iks,t.\nWe are interested in a holistic analysis by looking at each rating grade as a whole instead of looking at each one of the 6,000 simulated credits.

(29)\nLet us consider, for each s-scenario, the following bi-objective problem\nmin ws\u2208R6\nF (ws) = (\u2212ms(ws), vs(ws))\u22a4\nsubject to ws \u2208 \u2126s, (30)\nwhere \u2126s = { ws \u2208 R6 : wAAAs + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + wBs = 1 \u2227 wGs \u2265 0, \u2200G \u2208 {AAA, . . . ,B} }\ndenotes the feasible region. The formulation of this problem is motivated by the classical mean-variance optimization problem (Markowitz, 1952), which constitutes the base of the Modern Portfolio Theory.\nDefinition 1 (Pareto minimizer). ws \u2208 \u2126s is a Pareto minimizer of F (\u00b7) if\n\u2204xs \u2208 \u2126s : \u2212ms(xs) < \u2212ms(ws) \u2227 vs(xs) < vs(ms). (31)\nA Pareto minimizer, x \u2208 \u2126s, is also known as a non-dominated point.\nDefinition 2 (Set of Pareto minimizers, Ws). The set of Pareto minimizers, Ws, of F (\u00b7), is defined as\nWs = { ws \u2208 \u2126S : \u2204xs \u2208 \u2126s : \u2212ms(xs) < \u2212ms(ws) \u2227 vs(xs) < vs(ms) } . (32)\nThe set of Pareto minimizers, Ws, defines the set of non-dominated points of Problem (30). The efficient Pareto frontier, solution of Problem (30), corresponds to the mapping of F (\u00b7) on the set of non-dominated points, Ws.\nNow, consider the following linear scalarization problem\nmin ws\u2208R6 \u03b1w\u22a4s Qsws \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1)w\u22a4s \u00b5s subject to ws \u2208 \u2126s,\n(33)\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] represents a tuning parameter . Note that Problem (33) corresponds to a convex quadratic programming (QP) problem.\nIt is easy to prove that a solution of Problem (33) is a Pareto minimizer for Problem (30). In fact, let w\u2217s \u2208 \u2126s be a solution of Problem (33). Now, suppose that w\u2217s is not a Pareto minimizer of Problem (30). Then, according to Definition 1 we have\n\u2203zs \u2208 \u2126s : \u2212z\u22a4s \u00b5s < \u2212w\u2217s\u22a4\u00b5s \u2227 z\u22a4s Qszs < w\u2217s\u22a4Qsw\u2217s . (34)\nBy the fact that \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], we have\n\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1)z\u22a4s \u00b5s < \u2212(1\u2212 \u03b1)w\u2217s\u22a4\u00b5s \u2227 \u03b1z\u22a4s Qszs < \u03b1w\u2217s\u22a4Qsw\u2217s , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] (35)\nFinally, summing these two inequalities, we have\n\u03b1z\u22a4s Qszs \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1)z\u22a4s \u00b5s < \u03b1w\u2217s\u22a4Qsw\u2217s \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1)w\u2217s\u22a4\u00b5s, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], (36) from which follows that w\u2217s is not an optimal solution of Problem (33). This concludes the proof by reductio ad absurdum.\nAccordingly, for each s-scenario, we can find the corresponding set of Pareto minimizers, Ws, by solving Problem (33) for different values of \u03b1. Setting \u03b1 = 0, we obtain the maximum income portfolio and setting \u03b1 = 1 give us the global minimum variance portfolio. We solve Problem (33), varying \u03b1 between 0 and 1, in order to achieve |Ws| = 10, 002 (besides the efficient allocations corresponding to \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = 1, we find 10,000 more different efficient allocations).\nThe value of \u03b1 defines an efficient allocation for the corresponding s-scenario. Motivated by the robust resampling methodology proposed in Michaud and Michaud, 2007; Michaud and Michaud, 2008, we define the optimal efficient allocations by averaging over all s-scenarios. As a result, we obtain 10,002 optimal efficient portfolios, where each portfolio is determined by the \u03b1 value and corresponds to the average (over the 100 considered scenarios) efficient allocations."

            "text": "We have implemented the forward-looking robust optimization approach, described in the previous section, using MATLAB\u00ae (MathworksTM, 2021). Considering the baseline\ncase, where each credit has a 10-year maturity, we obtain the robust efficient frontiers under the IFRS 9 framework (see Figure 6 - (a)). This frontier allows the bank manager to directly analyze the tradeoff between the portfolio income and the portfolio income volatility. Therefore, the bank manager can select an efficient portfolio according to a desirable income-risk rule.\nInstead of focusing on the selection of a specific income-risk rule or efficient portfolio, we report the weight variation with the risk level for all the computed efficient portfolios (see Figure 7 - (a)). We can observe that a less risky portfolio has a larger AAA-grade allocation. In turn, a more risky portfolio has a larger BB-grade allocation. Under the IFRS 9 accounting framework, the efficient riskiest credit portfolio has the following structure: 12%-AAA, 22%-AA, 15%-AA, 5%-BBB, 46%-BB, and 0%-B. This portfolio has an average annual income equal to 2.80% with a standard deviation equal to 1.77%, which, for example, dominates the equally-weighted portfolio that achieves an average annual income equal to 1.78% with a standard deviation of 2.49%.\nIn Figure 6 we also report the robust efficient frontiers under the IAS 9 and CECL accounting frameworks. We observe that under the IAS 39 framework, in opposition to the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks, the efficient credit portfolios are less risky and achieve a higher average annual income. Moreover, looking at how the allocations vary by risk level (see Figure 7), we observe that the structure of the efficient credit portfolios under IFRS 9 and CECL is very different from the one under IAS 39. The riskier credit portfolio under IAS 39 (0%-AAA, 0%-AA, 0%-A, 0%-BBB, 74%-BB, and 26%-B) has a portfolio income standard deviation equal to 0.38% and an average annual income equal to 4.26%. These numbers correspond to approximately 4.66 times less risk and 1.93 times more average annual income than the riskier efficient portfolio under IFRS 9. The riskier efficient portfolio under CECL (8%-AAA, 19%-AA, 2%-A, 3%-BBB, 68%-BB, and 0%-B) achieves a higher income in comparison with the riskier efficient portfolio under IFRS 9 (3.01%>2.80%) but is riskier (2.57%>1.77%).\nFrom Figure 7 we observe that, under the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks, riskier rating allocations are penalized. Under the IAS 39 framework, the allocation of the riskier portfolios (see Figure 7 - (b)) concentrates 100% around speculative-grade rated credits (BB and B). In turn, under IFRS 9 more than 50% of the allocation (see Figure 7 - (a)) of the riskier portfolios is concentrated in investment-grade ratings (AAA, AA, A, and BBB). Under the CECL framework (see Figure 7 - (b)), this percentage is slightly less. Even so, riskier credit ratings are also very penalized. These results suggest that the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks can lead to procyclical effects when compared to the IAS 39 framework. This is in line with the results presented in previous studies (Abad & Suarez, 2018; Barclays, 2017; Seitz et al., 2018).\nTo give some insight into the sensitivity of these results to the maturity of the credits, we apply the methodology described in Section 2 and the forward-looking robust optimization model developed in Section 3 to credits with a 5-year and a 15-year maturity. We assume that the investment horizon coincides with the credit maturities.\nThe credit income computation uses as fixed interest, C, the coupon value of global corporate bonds. In the case of 5-year maturity credits, these values are equal to: 1.828%,\n1.999%, 2.146%, 2.531%, 3.536%, and 4.156% for a AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, and B ratings, respectively. In turn, for the case of 15-year maturity credits, these values are equal to: 2.631%, 2.777%, 3.075%, 3.684%, 5.412%, and 6.065% or a AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, and B ratings, respectively.\nFor the 5-year horizon, the discount rate D for the credit impairment stock, under the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks, is set to 1.659%, equaling the 2-year AAA global corporate bond rate13. In the 15-year horizon, D is set equal to the 7-year AAA corporate bond rate, 2.030%. All these values were obtained through the Bloomberg Terminal (Bloomberg, 2021). Using these data, the procedure presented in sections 2-3, which was applied initially to 10-year maturities, is replicated to 5-year and 15-year horizons.\nFor a 5-year horizon, Figure 8 and Figure 9, report, under the three different accounting frameworks, the robust efficient frontiers and the portfolio weights for different risk levels, respectively. From Figure 8, we observe that the efficient portfolios have low income and low risk, regardless of the accounting framework, when compared to 10-year efficient portfolios (Figure 6).\nFor example, we observe that the riskiest efficient portfolio under the IFRS 9 accounting framework, with the structure 1%-AAA, 17.98%-AA, 13.02%-A, 28%-BBB, 40%-BB, and 0%-B, achieves an annual average income equal to 2.24% with an income standard deviation of 1.27%. This allocation earns a lower average yearly income than the riskiest 10-year efficient portfolio (2.24%<2.80%), but also entails less risk (1.27%<1.77%). Besides the difference between the maturities of the credits, this pattern is expected due to the positive slope of the bond coupon curves.\nUnder the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks, the structure of the 5-year efficient portfolios (Figure 9) and 10-year portfolios (Figure 7) is similar. Despite the similarities, we highlight that, for both frameworks, shorter maturities lead to lower concentration on the AAA-rated credits.\nAs in the case of 10-year maturity credits, we also observe that the 5-year efficient portfolios under the IFRS 9 and CECL tend to penalize riskier ratings, namely speculativegrade classes (BB and B). In turn, under the IAS 39 framework, the short-dated riskiest efficient portfolios tend to have a higher concentration in speculative-grade credit ratings (Figures 9 - (b)). For example, under IAS-39, the riskiest efficient credit portfolio has the following structure: 0%-AAA, 0%-AA, 0%-A, 0%-BBB, 4%-BB, 96%-B.\nFinally, we test efficient frontiers and allocations for a 15-year horizon under the IFRS 9, IAS 39, and CECL frameworks, in Figure 10 and Figure 11, respectively. These efficient credit portfolios exhibit a higher annual average income and volatility (Figure 10) when compared to the 10-year efficient credit portfolios (Figure 6). The higher risk stems from the higher investment horizon, while the higher income is explained again by the positive slope of the coupon curve.\nThe structure of the 15-year efficient portfolios shows identical features to 10-year and 5-year portfolios (see figures 11, 7, and 9). Nevertheless, under the IFRS 9 and\n13Similarly to the baseline case of credits with a 10-year maturity, for credits with 5-year and 15-year maturity, we use as a discount rate, D, the coupon rate of a AAA global corporate bond with roughly half the maturity of the credits.\nCECL frameworks, we observe that the 15-year efficient portfolios tend to allocate a larger proportion to AAA ratings, avoiding the volatility caused by lower credit ratings.\nWe continue to observe that, under IAS 39, riskier ratings are less penalized. For example, the riskiest 15-year efficient portfolio shows the following allocations: 0%-AAA, 0%-AA, 0%-A, 0%-BBB, 95%-BB, and 5%-B. However, for the same level of risk, 15-year portfolios display a higher concentration in investment-grade ratings, and thus a lower concentration in speculative-grade assets, when compared to the 10-year horizons (see figures 11 - (b) and 7 - (b)))."

            "text": "In this paper, we have developed a methodology to construct credit portfolios under the IFRS 9 framework. Based on a point-in-time probability model, we have defined the credit loss model to compute the credit income under IFRS 9. We have also explained the differences between the credit loss model under the IFRS 9 framework and the credit loss models under the IAS 39 and CECL accounting frameworks.\nWe have devised a non-homogeneous Markov chain setting, based on CreditMetricsTM, to estimate transition matrices conditional on global real GDP growth. We have used these conditional transition matrices to simulate the credit dynamics and estimate the point-in-time probabilities of default, both needed to compute credit income under the IFRS 9 framework. The credit income is thus estimated taking into account the cyclical economic effects that are of great importance to bank management.\nFor each rating class, we estimated the forward-looking credit income based on a portfolio of representative credits. We subsequently implemented a robust optimization model to analyze the tradeoff between expected revenue and volatility, measured as the annual standard deviation of portfolio income.\nAccording to the proposed model, we have obtained the efficient Pareto frontiers under the IFRS 9, IAS 39, and CECL accounting frameworks. We began our tests by evaluating 10-year efficient allocations and subsequently examined the 5-year and 15-year Pareto frontiers, the impact of investment horizons on income, risk, and efficient allocations.\nThe results indicate that efficient credit portfolios constructed under IFRS 9 and CECL severely penalize riskier ratings more than IAS 39. Moreover, when changing the investment horizon, we observed that the longer the maturity, the lower the allocation to riskier ratings.\nThese results highlight the potential procyclical effects of the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks. If the bank manager anticipates an economic downturn, under the IFRS 9 and CECL, she/he will tend to penalize riskier credits. The problem is that it is precisely in downturn periods that several credits suffer downgrades as the result of the economic conditions. Therefore, the investment decisions made by the bank manager could lead to procyclical effects by contributing to intensifying the economic downturn.\nFurthermore, the several subjective decisions associated with implementing IFRS 9 and CECL may cause a lack of comparability and transparency among institutions, compared\nto the more objective procedure to account for losses under IAS 39. This feature of more recent accounting regimes demonstrates the importance of conduction more research on their practical implications."
