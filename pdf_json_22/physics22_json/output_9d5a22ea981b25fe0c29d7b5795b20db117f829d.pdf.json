    "abstractText": "In Galaxy And Mass Assembly Data Release 4 (GAMA DR4), we make available our full spectroscopic redshift sample. This includes 248 682 galaxy spectra, and, in combination with earlier surv e ys, results in 330 542 redshifts across fiv e sk y re gions co v ering \u223c250 de g 2 . The redshift density, is the highest available o v er such a sustained area, has e xceptionally high completeness (95 per cent to r KiDS = 19.65 mag), and is well-suited for the study of g alaxy mergers, g alaxy groups, and the low redshift ( z < 0.25) galaxy population. DR4 includes 32 value-added tables or Data Management Units (DMUs) that provide a number of measured and derived data products including GALEX , ESO KiDS, ESO VIKING, WISE , and Herschel Space Observatory imaging. Within this release, we provide visual morphologies for 15 330 galaxies to z < 0.08, photometric redshift estimates for all 18 million objects to r KiDS \u223c 25 mag, and stellar velocity dispersions for 111 830 galaxies. We conclude by deriving the total galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and its sub-division by morphological class (elliptical, compact-bulge and disc, diffuse-bulge and disc, and disc only). This extends our previous measurement of the total GSMF down to 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 and we find a total stellar mass density of \u03c1\u2217 = (2.97 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 8 M h 70 Mpc \u22123 or \u2217 = (2 . 17 \u00b1 0 . 03) \u00d7 10 \u22123 h \u22121 70 . We conclude that at z < 0.1, the Universe has converted 4.9 \u00b1 0.1 per cent of the baryonic mass implied by big bang Nucleosynthesis into stars that are gravitationally bound within the galaxy population.",

Received 2022 February 17; in original form 2021 July 7\nA B S T R A C T In Galaxy And Mass Assembly Data Release 4 (GAMA DR4), we make available our full spectroscopic redshift sample. This includes 248 682 galaxy spectra, and, in combination with earlier surv e ys, results in 330 542 redshifts across fiv e sk y re gions co v ering \u223c250 de g 2 . The redshift density, is the highest available o v er such a sustained area, has e xceptionally high completeness (95 per cent to r KiDS = 19.65 mag), and is well-suited for the study of g alaxy mergers, g alaxy groups, and the low redshift ( z < 0.25) galaxy population. DR4 includes 32 value-added tables or Data Management Units (DMUs) that provide a number of measured and derived data products including GALEX , ESO KiDS, ESO VIKING, WISE , and Herschel Space Observatory imaging. Within this release, we provide visual morphologies for 15 330 galaxies to z < 0.08, photometric redshift estimates for all 18 million objects to r KiDS \u223c 25 mag, and stellar velocity dispersions for 111 830 galaxies. We conclude by deriving the total galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and its sub-division by morphological class (elliptical, compact-bulge and disc, diffuse-bulge and disc, and disc only). This extends our previous measurement of the total GSMF down to 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 and we find a total stellar mass density of \u03c1\u2217 = (2.97 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 8 M h 70 Mpc \u22123 or \u2217 = (2 . 17 \u00b1 0 . 03) \u00d7 10 \u22123 h \u22121 70 .

These redshift surveys started n the 1980s with the Harvard Center for Astrophysics surv e y led by ohn Huchra and Margaret Geller (Huchra et al. 1983 ; de Lapparent,\nis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative h permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nM\nG n 1 e U S 1 N\n\u2018 fi S S D U o\no s S s s\nt t s t c s e 2\nr g s i 1 e S ( e\na O a f c ( s s T d t a a\ni r s d t G\na T b G d e t s o 2 6 v ( l A 2\nw ( D a 2 s e b o t e c ( c 2\n( 2 e e t t K m e s s A e s w\nh f 2 g 2 2 2 o t t b 6 v\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/1/439/6540978 by G ent U niversity user on 17 August 2022\neller & Huchra 1986 ; Geller & Huchra 1989 ). This continued with umerous shallow and medium-deep surv e ys conducted through the 980s and 1990s, operating mainly on the new 4-m class telescopes, .g. Stromlo-APM Redshift Survey (Lo v eday et al. 1992 ); DurhamKST Redshift Survey (Ratcliffe et al. 1996 ); Las Campanas Redshift urvey (Shectman et al. 1996 ); ESO slice Project (Vettolani et al. 997 ); Southern Sky Redshift Survey (da Costa et al. 1998 ); Canadian etwork for Cosmology (Yee et al. 2000 ), and many more. In the period leading into the millennium, the subject underwent an industrial revolution\u2019 through the advent of wide-area multiplexed bre-fed systems, as used by the 2-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift urvey (2dFGRS) on the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding pring Observatory in Australia (Colless et al. 2001 ), and the Sloan igital Sky Survey at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, SA (York et al. 2000 ). These two surv e ys pro vided \u223c250 000 and v er 1 million redshifts, respectively. Both the 2dFGRS and SDSS surv e ys based their input catalogues n flux limited samples with minimal pre-selection other than tringent star-galaxy classification criteria, see for example the DSS selection described in Strauss et al. ( 2002 ). Both surv e ys tro v e to pursue complete flux-limited samples with relatively high pectroscopic completeness ( > 80 per cent).\nThe SDSS surv e y, in particular, not only advanced the field through he provision of redshifts, but through the release of moderate signalo-noise spectra (S/N \u223c 5\u201330), and a dedicated CCD based imaging urv e y conducted in multiple ugriz bandpasses across \u223c8000 deg 2 of he Northern and Equatorial sky (Stoughton et al. 2002 ). SDSS has ontinued since this time, diversifying into more focused and niche ub-areas (i.e. SDSS II, Frieman et al. 2008 ; SDSS III, Eisenstein t al. 2011 ; SDSS IV, Blanton et al. 2017 ; SDSS V, commencing in 021, see Kollmeier et al. 2017 and also http://www.sdss5.org ). Today SDSS remains the preeminent low- z spectroscopic surv e y, esponsible for transforming our understanding of the nearby extraalactic sky. While part of the capacity to transform came from the cale, scope and quality of the data, this was magnified by the manner n which the data were made available. As of today, there have been 6 SDSS Public data releases (Ahumada et al. 2020 ), as well as the fforts of the many who pro vided deriv ed data products in an Open ource fashion suitable for immediate science e.g. Kauffmann et al. 2003 ), Brinchmann et al. ( 2004 ), Tremonti et al. ( 2004 ), Blanton t al. ( 2005 ), Simard et al. ( 2011 ), and many more.\nSince the 2dFGRS and SDSS, and post millennium, there has been bifurcation in the design and implementation of redshift surv e ys. ne branch has pursued complex target selections, usually colour\nnd/or photometric-redshift based, to maximize surv e y efficienc y or constraining cosmological parameters. This essentially trades ompleteness for sk y-co v erage, e.g. the Australian-led WiggleZ Drinkwater et al. 2010 ) and the US-led Baryon Oscillation Spectrocopic Survey (an SDSS e xtension: Da wson et al. 2013 ). While these urv e ys do remain useful for some galaxy population science (e.g. homas et al. 2013 ), the more complex selection and sub-sampling oes render some science cases unviable. Ob vious e xamples include he study of merger rates via close dynamical pairs, group finding, nd the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), ll areas where high-completeness is paramount.\nThe second branch in the bifurcation followed the path of conductng high-density high-completeness surv e ys often o v er more modest e gions of sk y, with the e xception of the v ery local hemispheric urv e ys, and with a greater focus on complementary panchromatic ata, e.g. the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (Liske et al. 2003 ); he 6-degree-Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS; Jones et al. 2009 ); the alaxy And Mass Assembly survey (GAMA; Driver et al. 2011 );\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nnd the Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey (Geller et al. 2016 ). hese surv e ys also built on the multiwavelength direction started y SDSS, and in particular capitalized on the available UV (via ALEX ) and near-infrared (via 2MASS, UKIRT, VISTA, and WISE ) ata. Through collaboration with the Hersc hel -ATLAS surv e y (Eales t al. 2010 ), the wavelength coverage of GAMA was extended into he far-IR and now spans 0.15\u2013500 \u03bcm (Driver et al. 2016 ). These urv e ys, while optimized for galaxy population studies, are subptimal for cosmology due to their limited co v erage (Blake et al. 013 ). Ho we ver, we note the ability of the very local hemispheric dFGS surv e y to place significant constraints on the Hubble Constant ia the detection and measurement of baryonic acoustic oscillations Beutler et al. 2011 ), and GAMA to assist in improving the cosmoogical constraints from the ESO KiDS weak-lensing surv e y (e.g. mon et al. 2018 ; van Uitert et al. 2018 ; Spurio Mancini et al. 019 ) With the advent of the 8-m class facilities, spectroscopic surv e ys\nere extended out to higher redshift, e.g. the VLT Very Deep Survey , Le F \u0300evre et al. 2005 ); the zCOSMOS surv e y, (Lilly et al. 2007 ); the eep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 , (Newman et al. 2013 ), nd the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey , (Guzzo et al. 014 ). Here, completeness is also an issue, as on the whole, these urv e ys are below 50 per cent redshift completeness (see Davies t al. 2018 , fig. 1). Ho we ver, this is less by design and more imposed y either the difficulty of obtaining redshifts for very distant targets, r the logistical restrictions in using multislit devices. Recently he Deep Extragalactic Visible Le gac y Surv e y (DEVILS; Davies t al. 2018 ), via stacked long-exposure integrations on the 4-m lass Anglo-Australian Telescope, is revisiting notable deep fields COSMOS, XMMLSS, ECDFs), seeking to raise the spectroscopic ompleteness to > 90 per cent, at intermediate magnitudes ( Y < 1.0 mag) and depth ( z < 1). In the very near future, forthcoming multifibre systems on 4-m e.g. DESI, DESI Collaboration et al. 2016 ; 4MOST, de Jong et al. 019 ; WEAVE, Dalton et al. 2020 ), and 8-m (MOONS, Cirasuolo t al. 2020 ; PFS, Wang et al. 2020 ) class facilities, will transform the xisting low, intermediate, and high-redshift domains taking us from he million galaxy redshift scale and into the tens of millions. In he slightly longer term, the proposed and planned 12-m Mauna ea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE), a dedicated optical/near-IR ultiple x ed spectroscopic facility (McConnachie et al. 2016 ), will xtend this to the hundreds of millions, and is essentially capable of ampling the entire observ able Uni verse at masses > 10 9 M h \u22122 70 ince z \u2248 5. Also notable are the forthcoming European Space gency Euclid (Laureijs et al. 2011 ) and NASA SPHEREx (Crill t al. 2020 ) missions that will surv e y v ery large samples within pecific high or low redshift windows at low wavelength resolution ith grism or linear variable filters, respectively. In parallel to the progression of spectroscopic surv e y campaigns, as been the rise of broad-band photometric redshift techniques (see or example the comparison of methods reported in Abdalla et al. 011 ), and the narrow-band filter surv e ys that define the middle round, e.g. COMBO17, (Wolf et al. 2003 ); COSMOS, (Laigle et al. 016 ); ALHAMBRA, (Molino et al. 2014 ); J-PAS (Benitez et al. 014 ); PAUS (Eriksen et al. 2019 ); and OTELO (Bongiovanni et al. 019 ). F or man y purposes, photometric redshifts are sufficient, but nce again for merger, group, and very low redshift ( z < 0.1) science, he traditional photometric surv e ys struggle with velocity resolutions ypically at \u223c10 000 km s \u22121 (broad-band) to \u223c1000 km s \u22121 (narrowand) compared to the typical galaxy pairwise velocity of 200\u2013 00 km s \u22121 (Lo v eday et al. 2018 ) and typical low-mass group elocity dispersions of < 500 km s \u22121 (Robotham et al. 2011 ).\n2 o c r A m e 2 R D L L e M n\no r e c p\n2 n ( a w p ( q c /\nh t l\ne ( d a o o fi S w s w 0 a u\n( f s w\n2 G\nI (\nc V 2 d C s\n2\nT c 2 f t M c ( V o n c a (\np V i d c t U f D\nd e V K p d m W t t t\na 2 a m a d v m o s 2 H\nb f t l\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/1/439/6540978 by G ent U niversity user on 17 August 2022\nThe Galaxy And Mass Assembly Surv e y (GAMA; Driver et al. 011 ), commenced in 2008 with the goal of building upon the le gac y f the original 2dFGRS and SDSS surv e ys to produce a highly omplete redshift surv e y with maximal multiwavelength data (xay-to-radio via eROSITA, GALEX , VST, VISTA, WISE , Herschel , SKAP, and MWA). GAMA data thus far, have been used to explore erger rates (Casteels et al. 2014 ; De Propris et al. 2014 ; Robotham t al. 2014 ; Davies et al. 2015 ), galaxy groups (Robotham et al. 011 ; Khosroshahi et al. 2017 ; Raouf et al. 2019 ; Taylor et al. 2020 ; aouf et al. 2021 ), the lo w- z Uni v erse (Guna wardhana et al. 2011 ; river et al. 2012 ; Kelvin et al. 2012 ; Lo v eday et al. 2012 ; Lara \u0301opez et al. 2013 ; Cluver et al. 2014 ; Oli v a-Altamirano et al. 2014 ; ange et al. 2015 ; Moffett et al. 2016 ; Beeston et al. 2018 ; Bellstedt t al. 2020b ), and in particular the low- z GSMF (Baldry et al. 2012 ; offett et al. 2016 ; Wright et al. 2017 ): the benchmark for most umerical simulations. GAMA e xtends o v er fiv e re gions of sk y co v ering 250 de g 2 , and v er the past decade, we have obtained \u223c230 000 spectroscopic edshift measurements with a median accuracy of \u00b135 km s \u22121 (Liske t al. 2015 ), and complementary imaging, either directly or via ollaboration, extending from the UV to the far-IR, i.e. 20-band hotometry (see Driver et al. 2016 ) extending from 0.2\u2013500 \u03bcm. To date, there have been three GAMA data releases (Driver et al. 011 ; Liske et al. 2015 ; Baldry et al. 2018 ), and in this paper, we ow provide the fourth (GAMA DR4), which includes all redshifts including those obtained by GAMA or by other surv e ys), all spectra, nd our revised 20-band UV to far-IR photometry for those galaxies ith spectroscopic redshifts (Bellstedt et al. 2020a ). In addition, we ro vide o v er 30 value added data tables or Data Management Units DMUs). These consist of many measured (Level 2) and derived uantities (Level 3), created by the GAMA team, providing quality ontrolled science-ready products to the global community (see http: /www .gama-survey .org/ dr4/ )\nThe paper concludes with a revised measurement of one of our eadline goals, the GSMF and its sub-division by morphological ype. It extends our previous estimates from 10 8 M h \u22122 70 to a new ower mass-limit of 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 at z < 0.1.\nIn Section 2 , we incorporate our recent image analysis (Bellstedt t al. 2020a ) of the ESO KiDS (Kuijken et al. 2019 ) and ESO VIKING Edge et al. 2013 ) Public Surv e y data with the GAMA spectroscopic ata, and explore our ef fecti ve redshift completeness for each region nd the combined primary regions. In Section 3 , we provide new r revised DMUs including photometric redshift estimates for all bjects in our revised Input Catalogue, and morphological classications for all objects with z < 0.08 and r KiDSDR4 < 19.65 mag. ection 4 describes the contents of Data Release 4. In Section 5 , e provide a revised measurement of the GSMF ( z < 0.1), and its ub-division by morphological type ( z < 0.08). Finally, in Section 6 , e discuss the implication for the cosmic stellar mass density at z < .1, including a re-normalization from the 230 deg 2 GAMA area to 5012 de g 2 re gion of the SDSS area, reducing our cosmic variance ncertainty at z < 0.1 from 12 to 6.5 per cent. We adopt a concordance \u2018737 cosmology\u2019, with ( H 0 , M , ) = 70 , 0 . 3 , 0 . 7) throughout, all magnitudes and fluxes are corrected or Galactic extinction, and all magnitudes are reported in the AB ystem.

In this section, we introduce the new ata, and quantify the implications of replacing our underlying Input atalogue in terms of revised magnitude limits for a range of desired pectroscopic completeness limits.\n.1 Incorporating Kilo-Degree Survey imaging\nhe Galaxy And Mass Assembly surv e y (Driv er et al. 2009 , 2011 ) onducted its first spectroscopic observations in 2008 (see Liske et al. 015 ). The spectroscopy was based on an initial target catalogue or the three equatorial regions (Baldry et al. 2010 ) drawn from he 6th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Adelman-\ncCarthy et al. 2008 ). Later, the surv e y was e xtended with an input atalogue for the G02 region created from the CFHT Lensing Survey CFHTLenS; Erben et al. 2013 ) and for the G23 region from the ESO ST Kilo-De gree Surv e y Data Release 1 (de Jong et al. 2015 ). These ptical imaging data, along with the UKIDSS Large Area Surv e y ear-IR data (Lawrence et al. 2007 ), formed the basis of our input atalogues using angular size and concentration, combined with an dditional ( J \u2212K s ) colour selection to recoup compact galaxy systems see full details in Baldry et al. 2010 ).\nThe GAMA optical/near-IR input catalogue data were later comlemented by UV to far-IR imaging data from GALEX , ESO VISTA IKING, WISE , and the Herschel Space Observatory, as described n Driver et al. ( 2016 ). In particular, the large majority of the GALEX ata co v ering the G23 re gion was acquired in a dedicated observing ampaign as part of the All-sky UV Survey Extension, following he hand o v er of GALEX to Caltech and prior to decommissioning. ltimately, the G02 spectroscopic surv e y was not completed to its ull extent, and all available G02 data were released as part of GAMA R3 (Baldry et al. 2018 ). Recently, we have updated the original equatorial SDSS imaging ata with deeper and higher spatial resolution ugri observations that xtend to r = 25 mag, from the European Southern Observatory\u2019s LT Surv e y Telescope Kilo-De gree Surv e y Data Release 4 (KiDS; uijken et al. 2019 ). The KiDS data complement the existing anchromatic data from UV to far-IR, providing consistent imaging ata to unify the equatorial and G23 regions on to a single photoetric and astrometric reference frame in FUV , NUV , ugri , ZYJHK , 1234, P 100/160, S 250/350/500 wavebands. The construction of he KiDS catalogue for GAMA (i.e. GKVINPUTCATV01 ) resulted in he detection and measurement of o v er 18-million objects extending o r \u223c 24 mag and is described in detail in Bellstedt et al. ( 2020a ).\nThe reanalysis of the FUV-far-IR data used a new source finding lgorithm designed for these data, PROFOUND (Robotham et al. 018 ), and is based on the precepts of dilated isophotal segments nd watershed deblending. This reanalysis included impro v ed starasking based on GAIA DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018 ), nd impro v ed Galactic Extinction corrections based on Planck ust extinction maps (Planck Collaboration XI 2014 ). A careful erification and reconstruction of all bright and dense regions with ultiple abutting segments was conducted, to ensure the integrity f the bright, large, and diffuse galaxies, i.e. those that are welluited to studies with integral field units (e.g. SAMI, Croom et al. 021 ; Hector, Bryant et al. 2020 ) and/or radio observatories (ASKAP, otan et al. 2021 ; MWA, Tingay et al. 2013 ; etc). Most importantly of all, the revised catalogue now allows us to ring together the three equatorial fields and the G23 field with ully consistent and homogeneous photometric measurements from he UV to far-IR using identical facilities to comparable sensitivity imits.\nMNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nM\nFigure 1.

This is because some alaxies with SDSS photometry brighter than our original SDSS flux imit are now found to be fainter in KiDS and vice versa resulting in less sharp cutoff in spectroscopic completeness. While the KiDSased catalogues should represent a significant impro v ement o v er the riginal SDSS data, due to the depth of the VST observations, the pectroscopic completeness remains tied to the original SDSS data.\nThe simplest way to o v ercome this is to pull back slightly in erms of the completeness limit, and to attempt to identify a revised hallower limit with a spectroscopic completeness comparable to hat of the original spectroscopic surv e y. The advantage is the bility to use the impro v ed photometry without the need to consider omplex selection functions, the disadvantage is the inevitable loss of epth (statistical significance), as some fraction of the spectroscopic edshifts are scattered fainter and some larger fraction of sources or which redshifts were not sought are scattered brightwards. For AMA, the loss of depth is compensated for, if the G23 region can be rought into selection alignment with the equatorial fields, i.e. while he surv e y depth is slightly diminished (0.15 mag, see Fig. 1 and subequent discussion), the surv e y area is increased (by 28 per cent), and he o v erall cosmic (sample) variance (CV) is reduced by 15 per cent.\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\no\nIn Liske et al. ( 2015 ), we reported a combined spectroscopic comleteness of 98.48 per cent to r SDSS = 19.8 mag in the equatorial fields G09 + G12 + G15), 95.5 per cent in the 20 deg 2 high-completeness ortion of the G02 region to r CFHT = 19.8 mag, and 94.19 per cent o i KiDSDR1 < 19.2 mag in the G23 field. Hence we aspire, with the evised photometry, to achieve comparable completeness levels of 5 or 98 per cent. All G02 data were released in Baldry et al. ( 2018 ) and as its anchromatic co v erage is quite different, we consider it no further. n Fig. 1 , we show the revised completeness of the remaining elds (coloured lines), for the equatorial regions combined (black ine), and for all four fields combined (grey lines), as a function of iDS r (top panels), KiDS i (centre panels), and VIKING Z (lower anels) magnitudes. The left-side and centre-column panels show the umulative distributions with the central panels representing a zoom n of the left-side panels. The right-side panels show a zoom in of he differential distribution. Table 1 reports the 50, 90, 95, and 98 per ent completeness limits for each of these bands, for each field and or various combinations.\nFor the remainder of this paper, we now consider the GAMA ain surv e y catalogue (GAMA MS) to be defined by r KiDSDR4 <\n9.65 mag from the combined G09 + G12 + G15 + G23 regions. This ontains 205 540 galaxies for which 195 432 have reliable (i.e. NQ 2) redshifts (i.e. 95.1 per cent).

N E W A N D UPDATED DATA M A NAG E M E N T NITS (DMUS) .1 The GAMA DR4 input catalogue v01 and v02\nn using the GKVINPUTCATV01 catalogue (Bellstedt et al. 2020a ), e identified a minor flaw in our galaxy rebuilding selection. This esulted in 77 large bright galaxies being heavily fragmented and compact group requiring deblending. For the 77 galaxies, these ere typically galaxies which intersected with a bright star, and as consequence were not selected for manual fixing (see Bellstedt t al. 2020a ). While unlikely to impact on any statistical analysis, hese very nearby large bright galaxies are of particular interest for number of nearby low redshift follow-on programmes. Hence, e take this opportunity to fix the apertures for these 77 galaxies, nd to rerun our measurement and post-processing pipelines for hese systems. As part of this process, we remo v ed 687 fragments\nssociated with these objects, and replaced their photometry with the 7 revised and rebuilt systems to produce GKVINPUTCATV02 . Fig. 3 shows before and after images for two of these bright alaxies. We note that we also revise our far-IR photometry and ur SED analysis to produce GKVPROSPECTV02 following the exact rocesses outlined in Bellstedt et al. ( 2020a, b ). The revised v02 atalogues are made available via GAMA DR4 and the original v01 atalogues are held in the team data base (i.e. they are not included in he GAMA DR4 release). Note that the one blended group (uberID = 15020829601469) we do not directly fix at this stage.

In total, there are now 0 107 galaxies without spectroscopic redshifts ( z spec ) within our evised magnitude limit. In order to provide an estimate of their ikely redshift, we employ the empirical method of Scaled Flux\natching (SFM) recently described by Baldry et al.

This matched sample consists of 222 991 galaxies. Relative and errors are applied in each of the bands in quadrature, consistent ith the floor values used in the PROSPECT analysis by Bellstedt et al. 2020a ). We, thus, produce a redshift probability distribution function PDF) for each object as the smoothed density kernel of all scaled emplates, weighted by the data-model likelihood. This allows us to erive the maximum-probability, and also the marginalized redshift alue for each object. These values are indicated by the zmax and exp columns, respectively, in the rele v ant DMU. An uncertainty stimate is made by determining half the 16\u201384th percentile range f the PDF, which is provided as zerr . The accuracy of these photometric redshifts is demonstrated in\nig. 4 for the o v erall sample in terms of the Scaled Median Absolute e viation (SMAD) gi ven by SMAD( x ) = 1.4826 \u00d7 median( | x \u2212 edian( x ) | ), and the mean offset, i.e. mean[(1 + z ) \u22121 z ]. The v erall values of the SMAD and mean[(1 + z ) \u22121 z ] are 0.0223 and 0.0004, respectively, which represents a significant improvement v er more readily used, template-based methods such as EAZY Easy and Accurate Zphot from Yale; Brammer, van Dokkum & oppi 2008 , see the discussion in Section 3.4 ). We note, ho we ver, hat the accuracy of these redshifts is surpassed by those recently resented for the KiDS-bright sample (Bilicki et al. 2021 ) using NNz, where SMAD and mean[(1 + z ) \u22121 z ] values of 0.0180 and .00012, respectively, were achieved. In Fig. 5 , we sho w ho w the SMAD and mean[(1 + z ) \u22121 z ] vary cross the sample as a function of both redshift and stellar mass. The\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nThis likelihood cut eliminates galaxies with very noisy SEDs from the omparison sample.\nd s E t\nMAD values tend to be similar o v er the redshift range, displaying a light trend towards higher values at lower stellar masses within each poch. This highlights that the photo-z values are more precise for igh-mass objects. The mean[(1 + z ) \u22121 z ] displays more systematic ariation across the sample. While the values are o v erall small (as is vident by the o v erall dark colour of the right-hand panel of Fig. 5 ), t is notable that out to z \u223c 0.4, the z phot values are biased slightly igh for galaxies around the median stellar mass, and beyond z \u223c .1, low-mass galaxies tend to have their z phot values underestimated. uch trends are not apparent when assessing the bias of the sample v erall. The z photo values for all galaxies in the r < 19.65 mag ample are provided in this release as GKVSFMPHOTOZV01 . For the ample of 10 107 galaxies without spectroscopic redshifts, the z photo alues and the PROSPECT -derived stellar masses, SFRs and gas-phase etallicities (derived in the same manner as described by Bellstedt t al. 2020a ) are released as GKVSFMPHO TOZPR OSPECTV01 .\n.4 EAZY photometric redshifts for all sources\nemplate-fit photometric redshift estimates have been derived for very SED in the GKVINPUTCATV02 DMU using EAZY (Brammer t al. 2008 ), in combination with the Brown et al. ( 2014 ) atlas of 129 earby galaxy spectra. The main rationale for the choice of templates is as a complement o heavy training; the main value of these estimates lies in the use of he best available empirical templates without prejudice. Overall, we o find that the Brown et al. templates yield slightly better photozpecz agreement in the r KiDSDR4 < 19.8 mag regime than the default AZY template set. Hence, a potential concern is that the fixed emplate set is not quite flexible enough to fully map the SED-z\nFigure 5. Demonstration of the photometric redshift accuracy for the SFM photo- z sample, as compared with the GAMA spectroscopic redshifts showing the variance (left-hand panel) and bias (right-hand panel) as a function of stellar mass and spectroscopic redshift. Note that the minimal colour variation in the right-hand panel is an indication that there is very little bias of the photometric redshifts across the GAMA sample.\ns w p i c o e T e a p t\nh s m r\nc s a a p t P t i t p\ni z t f t 0\ns 0 W f e t h z\ni a T v w t d c p fi v w r A S g = w p t\nc g t e a t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/1/439/6540978 by G ent U niversity user on 17 August 2022\npace. We therefore experimented with two-template combinations ithin EAZY, and find only very minor variations in the output hoto-zs, suggesting that this is not a leading source of error. The mplicit assumption in using a static empirical template set is that it o v ers a sufficiently wide range to contain an adequate description f the optical SED for any given target: i.e. not that galaxies do not v olve, b ut that a low-z analogue can be found for any high-z SED. his will clearly not be true for rare and/or extreme populations (e.g. xtremely metal-poor or sub-mm galaxies, etc.) or for classes that re not represented in the template set (e.g. quasars), but again the rimary moti v ation here is to have a broadly applicable benchmark o complement more sophisticated future approaches. These photometric redshift values are shown in Fig. 4 (rightand side), where they are compared to the GAMA main survey pectroscopic redshifts. As for the SFM analysis the SMAD and ean[(1 + z ) \u22121 z ] are derived, and found to be 0.0287 and \u22120.0036, espectively, and with a comparably small outlier rate. These template fit photometric redshifts are intended as a valuable\nomplement to those from machine learning and/or training sets, in everal distinct but interrelated ways. First, these template-fit results re grounded in astrophysics, in the sense that they are based on ctual integrated spectra from real galaxies. Secondly, because the rocess involves forward modelling the template spectra o v er man y rial redshifts, it is straightforward to derive the full posterior PDF, ( z). Thirdly, unlike trained approaches, they can in principle be exrapolated beyond the limit of any representative spectroscopic trainng/reference set. In these ways, template fit photometric redshift esimates can be extremely useful as a sanity check for, and especially in robing potential systematic biases in, results derived in other ways. For the purposes of SED-fitting, only the u \u2013K bands are used; the nclusion of the GALEX UV and WISE IR bands does not impro v e the phot \u2013z spec agreement. We also do not make use of EAZY\u2019s facility for emplate combination, having trialled two-template combination and ound no significant impro v ement. We adopt the default eazy v1.0 emplate error function (Brammer et al. 2008 ), with amplitude .5, and a 0.02 mag \u2018systematic\u2019 uncertainty in the photometry to\noften template mismatch effects. The redshift grid spans the range .004\u20134.3 in 209 steps, with grid steps proportional to log (1 + z). e also include an original r -band luminosity prior, which comes rom a descriptive model of the GAMA N ( m z , z spec ) distribution, xtrapolated down to r < 28 mag. Note that this prior operates mostly o exclude too-low redshift solutions that would lead to implausibly igh luminosities. It therefore has a relatively large impact on the phot \u2013z spec statistics, and plays less of a role for fainter galaxies.\nThe GKVEAZYPHOTOZ DMU packages the full EAZY outputs, ncluding both maximum likelihood estimates and minimum varince estimates, e v aluated with and without the luminosity prior. he preferred redshift estimate for any given galaxy is the z peak alue. This estimator is not well-documented, but is the prioreighted, minimum v ariance estimate, e v aluated in the vicinity of he maximum likelihood peak. Note that because this quantity is erived by marginalizing over the PDF, it will converge to some entral value where there is insufficient information in the SED to roperly constrain the redshift. We have also propagated the besttting template SED corresponding to the z peak solution. This alue is used to compute the Posterior Predictive P-Value (PPP), hich is a Bayesian summary statistic that is similar to the frequentist educed- \u03c72 , inasmuch as it provides an indication of goodness-of-fit. ssuming a particular model (in this case, the best-fitting template ED at z peak ), the PPP gives the chances of obtaining data that ive a less good fit: thus, 0.5 indicates the ideal fit with reduced- \u03c72\n1; 0 would indicate a catastrophically bad fit; a value close to 1 ould indicate o v erfitting. F or each galaxy, a random draw from the osterior PDF is also given as z mc ; this is appropriate for describing he ensemble with Monte Carlo redshift error propagation.\nThe GKVEAZYPHOTOZ DMU comprises of the full photometric atalogue of 18 + M sources, including artefacts and stars as well as alaxies, quasars, etc. Artefacts and stars can be excluded based on he photometric quality control flags, but it can also be useful to xplore how the photometry is mapped to z phot in these cases. No ttempts have been made to account for SED/spectral types outside he Brown et al. ( 2014 ) spectral atlas; e.g. rare spectral types, broad-\nMNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nM\nl o s r r f t G b r\n3\nT o b r p f l l i D c T a a w f s r p w\nb\n(\nc\nw\nw m p f i m\ni c m o a c e p\ne o o a fi i f c\na ( f i s c s C d c t T c o\nd o b e b d c\no e d o T o s a s e a i c\nm t c r t e a b s a c s i 8 c p t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/1/439/6540978 by G ent U niversity user on 17 August 2022\nine AGN, or QSOs; any photometric redshift estimates for such bjects are likely to be meaningless. Further, there is the danger of ome degree of contamination from such objects in any photometricedshift-selected galaxy sample. In addition to the main photometric edshift catalogue, this DMU also includes the full posterior P ( z) or every photometric detection. We also provide analogues of he STELLARMASSES DMU (see Section 3.6 below) in a separate KVEAZYPHOTOZSTELLARMASSES DMU. Values are derived using oth the z peak and z mc values, containing stellar mass estimates, est-frame photometry, and ancillary stellar population properties.\n.5 Morphological classification of the z < 0 . 08 GAMA sample\nhe impro v ed resolution of KiDS data (FWHM \u223c 0.7 arcsec), v er SDSS (FWHM \u223c1.5 arcsec), along with the deeper surface rightness limit ( \u03bc \u223c 2 mag per square arcsec), allows us to e vie w our pre vious morphological classifications. It also allows us to roduce new and consistent morphological classifications across the our GAMA primary regions, and to our new nominal completeness imit of r KiDSDR4 < 19.65 mag (see T able 1 ). W e adopt a redshift imit of z < 0.08 (at which point 1 arcsec = 1.51 h \u22121 70 kpc), which s matched to the redshift selection of our bulge-disc decomposition MU (Casura et al., submitted). To perform the classifications, we reate postage stamp images from grZ imaging (i.e. VST & VISTA). he image stamps are extracted at 30 h \u22121 70 kpc \u00d7h \u22121 70 30 kpc scales, nd with arcsinh scaling extending from \u03bcr = 15 mag per square rcsec to the sky level. For galaxies that overflow the spatial range, e increase the stamp size accordingly based on its R100 value rom GKVINPUTCATV02 , which represents the approximate elliptical emimajor axis containing 100 per cent of the flux. Fig. 6 shows a andom selection of images similar to those used for the classification rocess. Within these limits ( r KiDSDR4 < 19.65 mag and z < 0.08), e have 15 330 galaxies which we classify into:\nE: an early-type system with a single visual component cBD: a two-component system with a compact high-surface rightness bulge dBD a two-component system with a diffuse or extended bulge or bulge complex) D: a late-type system with a single visual component C: a compact system too small to accurately classify H: hard to classify due to extreme asymmetry (including merging omponents) HE: hard to classify but the underlying galaxy is an early-type\nith a single visual component FRAG : fragment of a galaxy STAR: stellar-like and most likely not a galaxy\nWe note that the HE class specifically denotes early-types with hat appear to be multiple cores, indicative of late-time major ergers, multiple galaxies within the halo (i.e. a compact group), or\nossible line-of-sight coincidences. In most of the discussion going orward, we combine the E and HE classes, but keep the distinction n the catalogue in case someone is interested in quickly finding ultiple-cored early-types. The classification process we follow is similar to that described n Hashemizadeh et al. ( 2021 ). First, we distribute the galaxies into lassification directories based on criteria such as colour, size, and ass. We then assign a classifier to each directory who extracts bjects for which the classification is wrong or uncertain. These are ssigned to a temporary classification folder. The custodian of each lass views the temporary classification folder for their class and ither accepts or rejects the classification into their master set. The rocess is repeated until all objects are assigned. As in Hashemizadeh\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nt al. ( 2021 ), this process was found to be flawed, as ultimately ne person is responsible for each class, and their exact definition f where the boundaries lie will vary. There is also no ability to ssess the accuracy of the classifications. Hence, we implemented a nal phase in which all classifications were re vie wed and reassigned ndependently by SPD, S(abine)B, and LJD. This resulted in three ully independent sets of classifications allowing an assessment of lassification accuracy.\nFig. 7 shows the resulting Venn diagrams for our three classifiers, nd the full classification set and for each of the six sub-classes having merged the E + HE classifications and removing the very ew objects classified as STAR or FRAG). In general, the agreement s at the 90-per cent level throughout. From Fig. 7 , we can see ome consistent disparities between the classifiers with SPD having lassified more Ellipticals than LJD or SB (denoted by the blue hading in Fig. 7 lower left). LJD identified more objects as ompact or Hard (orange shading), and SB perhaps has a slightly ifferent dBD/cBD boundary definition (green shading). For the final lassification, we take the majority decision, or in the rare case of a hree-way disagreement, a final re vie w and decision is made by SPD. he morphology DMU ( GKVMORPHOLOGYV02 ) contains the starting lassifications, classifications after the initial sort, the classifications f SPD, SB, and LJD and the final adopted classification. Note that as part of this process, we have attempted to divide the ouble component systems into those with a compact-bulge (cBD), r diffuse-bulge (dBD). This classification into cBD and dBD is ased solely on the visual appearance of the bulge-component, as ither high surface-brightness and point-like (cBD), or low surfacerightness and extended (dBD). In due course comparisons to IFU ata such as that drawn from the SAMI surv e y (Croom et al. 2021 ) an be made to determine the veracity of these sub-classifications.\nIf we combine the dBD and cBD classes into a single BD class, that ne assumes the Compact classes are predominantly poorly resolved arly-types, and the Hard class are predominantly morphologically isturbed late-types (as inspection suggests, see also Fig. 6 ), then the v erall classification consistenc y changes to that shown in Fig. 8 . his represents a surprisingly modest impro v ement suggesting that ur division into six galaxy classes is meaningful. Note that only the pec- z sample is included in this analysis, as the photo- z sample was dded later, and LJD did not classify this subset. Hence, the photo- z ample is essentially the classifications of SPD alone (and which will ither agree or disagree with those of SB). Nevertheless, the overall greement of the classification process, for the spec- z sample only, s 13 764/15 081 (91.3 per cent), or 13 974/15 081 (92.7 per cent) if lasses are merged as E = E + HE + C, D = D + H, and BD = cBD + dBD.\nTo explore whether our classification accuracy is biased in stellar ass or redshift, Fig. 9 shows how the agreement varies with these wo parameters. The scale is set so that 87.5-per cent agreement is oloured black and anything belo w v aries from dark red to bright ed, while higher agreement ranges from mauve to blue to green o yellow (100 per cent agreement). Here, agreement is defined for ach galaxy as 0.0 if all classifiers disagree, 0.5 if two classifiers gree, and 1 if all three classifiers agree. The final value, for each in, is then the mean of these agreement values. The size of the ymbol for each bin denotes the number of objects in that bin on logarithmic scale. Agreement across the M \u2217\u2013z plane is generally onsistent and abo v e 87.5 per cent in almost all bins. There is a light bias towards lower agreement at the lower mass high- z limit, .e. in the direction of decreasing signal-to-noise, but still well abo v e 7.5 per cent throughout. Hence, we conclude that our morphological lassifications are robust to \u226590 per cent o v er the majority of the M \u2212z lane that we are sampling. Nevertheless, we note and acknowledge hat morphological classification is an inexact and subjective process,\nFigure 6.

All stamps are displayed in grZ wavebands, at a resolution of 30 h \u22121 70 kpc \u00d730 h \u22121 70 kpc or larger (as indicated) if the image was likely to extend outside the box.

( 2011 ) has been completely refactored. ompared to Taylor et al. ( 2011 ), the most significant change is to eight the observed SEDs such that the stellar population synthesis SPS) modelling is done using an approximately fixed wavelength ange of 3000\u201311 000 \u00c5. The modelling assumes Bruzual & Charlot\n2003 ) stellar evolution models, assuming a Chabrier ( 2003 ) stellar nitial mass function (IMF) and the Calzetti et al. ( 2000 ) dust curve. he SPS models used in the fitting are defined via a static grid in our parameters (see section 3.1 of Taylor et al. 2011 ); namely: time ince formation (i.e. age; 8 \u2264 log t form \u2264 10.1); e -folding time for he (exponentially declining) star formation history (7.5 \u2264 log \u03c4 < 0); stellar metallicity ( \u22124 \u2264 log Z \u2264 \u22121.3); and dust attenuation (0\nA V \u2264 2.43). The values of all derived parameters given in the DMU, including he formal uncertainties, have been derived in a Bayesian way sections 3.2\u20133.4 of Taylor et al. 2011 ), with flat priors in t form , log \u03c4 ,\nMNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nM\nFigure 8.

For DR4, the STELLARMASSES DMU has been updated o include stellar mass and stellar population parameters based on all he major photometric catalogues included within the GAMA data ase, including: Source Extractor photometry from the Panchromatic ata Release (PDR Driver et al. 2016 ), matched aperture photometry\nrom LAMBDAR (Wright et al. 2016 ), and the latest ProFound hotometry (Bellstedt et al. 2020a ) used in this paper, as well as sing SDSS- or CFHT-derived photometry in the G02 field. The differences between these simple estimates and the more sohisticated ones from ProSpect are small: random scatter of 0.13 dex; ystematic offset (ProSpect masses being heavier) of 0.06 dex (see g. 34 in Robotham et al. 2020 , and associated discussions). Comared to ProSpect, the principal virtue of these stellar mass estimates s their simplicity. Using only optical-NIR photometry and simple tar formation histories make it straightforward for other surv e ys nd teams to derive directly comparable results. In other words, he y pro vide a practical basis for robust cross-surv e y comparisons. or e xample, Taylor et al. ( 2011 ) has shown v ery good agreement random scatter of 0.07 dex; systematic offest of 0.01 dex) between ur M / L s and those used by SDSS.\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\n.7 Velocity dispersions\nith DR4, we fill a long-standing gap in the GAMA data set with he inclusion of central stellar velocity dispersions as measured rom 1D spectra. As a reflection of the depth of a galaxy\u2019s central otential well, modulo structure, velocity dispersion is a valuable omplement to stellar mass estimates, and as a tracer of galaxy ormation/stellar assembly history (e.g. Sheth et al. 2003 ; Bernardi t al. 2010 ; Taylor et al. 2010 ; Bezanson et al. 2011 ). The addition f velocity dispersions into the GAMA data base is particularly owerful, as they can be connected to all the many other global alaxy properties GAMA provides, including SED-derived masses, ges, SFRs, etc.; spectral absorbtion and emission diagnostics as racers of age, metallicity, SFR, etc.; morphology, sizes, and S \u0301ersic arameters from optical-NIR imaging; environmental metrics, group ssociations and masses; and more.\nIn brief: the velocity dispersion values are derived using pPXF Cappellari 2017 ) with the MILES stellar spectral library (S \u0301anchezl \u0301azquez et al. 2006 ; Falc \u0301on-Barroso et al. 2011 ) as templates. ollowing Bezanson et al. ( 2018 ), we use both multiplicative and dditiv e Le gendre polynomials for broad continuum subtraction of oth observed and template spectra, to account for potential errors n spectral background subtraction and flux calibration. A two-pass cheme is used to identify and account for strong emission lines when tting to the continuum: in the first pass, we complement the stellar emplates with eight templates for the main emission lines; then in the econd and final measurement, we retain only those lines with signifcant ( > 5 \u03c3 ) detections. Measurements are made and reported for all\nTable 3.

The main challenge to v ercome has been the need to calibrate/cross-validate measurements ased on the heterogenous set of spectra available. As well as direct omparison to measurements by Said et al. ( 2020 ), we have used both ntra- and inter-surv e y comparisons to quantify/calibrate random and ystematic errors in the measurements as a function of S/N, velocity ispersion, or surv e y (see Table 2 ). At a median S/N of 10 \u00c5\u22121 , ypical formal errors are \u223c0.06 dex for GAMA spectra, versus 0.03 for SDSS spectra, and \u22650.1 for both 6dFGS and 2dFGRS, nd scaling approximately inversely for higher S/N. We caution hat measurements from 2dFGRS spectra show greater systematic ariations when compared to other data sources, presumably related o its coarser spectral resolution.

This builds n earlier GAMA works on these topics from Baldry et al. ( 2012 ), elvin et al. ( 2014 ), Mof fett et al. ( 2016 ), and Wright et al. ( 2017 ). pecifically, our revised estimate will make use of the following MUs: SPECCATV27 for the redshifts, GKVSCIENCECATV02 for the hotometric measurements, GKVMORPHOLOGYV02 for Hubble Clasifications, GKVPROSPECTV02 for the Stellar Masses measurements nd uncertainties, and GKVSFMPHOTOZV02 for photometric redshifts nd stellar masses of Main Surv e y objects without spectroscopic edshifts. These DMUs are all included in DR4, see Tables 3 and\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nr\n, and are available from the release website. The key advances v er our previous GSMF estimates are the inclusion of the G23 egion, the upgrade to KiDS photometry, revised stellar masses, and he inclusion of photometric data for missing and/or low surface rightness systems. We note that in this work, we do not attempt to identify and emo v e AGN. In two forthcoming papers, Thorne et al. (submitted nd in preparation), we explore the AGN contribution and its impact n our PROSPECT stellar mass estimates in detail. We now start by adopting the magnitude limit of r KiDSDR4 = 9.65 mag, as discussed in Section 2.2 , for the four primary GAMA egions (G09, G12, G15, and G23). This sub-sample contains 205 540 alaxies for which our surv e y is 95.1 per cent complete in terms of eliable spectroscopic redshifts (see Section 2.2 ). For those galaxies\nFigure 10. (Left-hand panel) Shows the mass-to-light ratio of the galaxies in our sample (blue histogram) along with the dashed line which delineates the 95-percentile value and the lower mass population impacted by this cut (red histogram) and for which our selection encloses 99.45 per cent of the sample. (Right-hand panel) Shows the total sample in the stellar mass distance plane. The red dashed line shows the implied mass completeness limit from a combination of the given flux limit of r = 19.65 mag combined with the 95 percentile mass-to-light limit derived from the left-hand panel.

Hence, we eem our sample to be 100 per cent redshift complete. We now imit our sample to the nearby Universe by imposing a redshift utoff of z < 0.1. Note that no attempt is made to fold in any volution within the interval 0 < z < 0.1 (but see later discussion in ection 6.2 ). To reduce the observed sample to an empirical mass function, we ake use of Modified Maximum Likelihood (MML) estimation, s developed by Obreschkow et al. ( 2018 ). This method a v oids inning the data, and is a Bayesian framework for fitting distribution unctions to complex multidimensional data, developed particularly or galaxy mass functions. By design, the MML framework includes ue consideration of the observational measurement errors for each ndividual object, optimal correction for systemic Eddington bias, the bility to incorporate complex observational selection functions, and he option to correct internally for the underlying large-scale structure LSS) identified within the surv e y volume. At its heart, the MML pproach consists of an iterative fitting algorithm that successively olves a standard maximum likelihood estimation and then updates he data by accounting for the previous fit and the observational ncertainties. The power of this \u2018fit-and-debias\u2019 procedure relies on he fact that its solution can be shown to converge towards the exact olution of a much more e xpensiv e full Bayesian hierarchical model, n which each observable (e.g. each galaxy mass) is a free parameter ith a prior given by the measurement (e.g. flux and redshift). The MML framework is accessible via DFTOOLS (Obreschkow t al. 2018 ), an open-source software package for the R statistical rogramming language. The code is fully documented and many xamples hav e been pro vided by Obreschkow et al. ( 2018 ). DFTOOLS an be used to derive volume-corrected binned mass functions, s well as to fit parametrized analytical functions. In both cases, FTOOLS can determine the most likely solutions and full co-variance atrices of the rele v ant model parameters. Here, we elect to fit a ouble Schechter function, able to tackle the characteristic upturn een at intermediate stellar mass by Baldry et al. ( 2012 ) and in ubsequent studies. This function is defined in Baldry et al. ( 2012 )\nF\ns M d M = e \u2212M /M \u2217 ( \u03c6\u22171 ( M\nM \u2217\n)\u03b11 + \u03c6\u22172 ( M\nM \u2217\n)\u03b12 ) d M M \u2217 , (1)\nhere \u03c6M d M is the number density of galaxies in the mass interval M and \u03c6\u22171 , \u03c6 \u2217 2 and \u03b11 , \u03b12 describe the normalization and slope arameters, respectively, for the two components. Without loss of enerality, we can al w ays choose \u03b11 > \u03b12 such that the second term n equation 1 dominates at lower masses.\nIn our usage of DFTOOLS , we adopt the stellar mass errors identified or each galaxy from the PROSPECT analysis of Bellstedt et al. 2020b ). The median error for our z < 0.1 sample is log 10 M = .043. In those cases, where photometric redshifts are used, the errors lso include the uncertainty in the redshift (see Section 2.3), although e note that in our final analysis, only 98 galaxies with photometric edshifts, (i.e. 0.7 per cent) survive through to the final sample. The observational selection function is the key component to eriving the appropriate volume correction. Given the data are flux imited in the observed r -band, yet we are looking to reco v er stellar\nass functions, this is non-trivial. To o v ercome this issue, we explore he r -band mass-to-light distribution as shown in the left-hand panel f Fig. 10 . The blue distribution shows the spread and the dashed ine shows the mass-to-light ratio that encloses 95 per cent of the full istribution, i.e. log 10 ( M / L r ) = 0.463. Note that if we only consider alaxies with stellar masses below 10 10 M h \u22122 70 (i.e. those not seen v er the entire volume), we find only 0.55 per cent with mass-to-light atios abo v e 0.463 (see the red shaded histogram in Fig. 10 ). Hence, n effect, our cut is valid for 99.45 per cent of the population impacted y the selection boundary. Fig. 10 (right-hand panel) now shows our ull sample in terms of their stellar mass and co-moving distance s grey dots, and where the LSS (horizontal banding) is clearly isible. Using our r KiDSDR4 -band limit of 19.65 mag, combined with ur 95 per cent mass-to-light limit (dashed line of Fig. 10 left-hand anel), we can now define the red dashed line. This denotes the istance limit at each redshift for which our sample will be 99.5 per ent complete for M < 10 10 M h \u22122 70 . We fit the dashed red curve on ig. 10 (right-hand panel) with a generalized logistics function, also\nMNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nM\nH z < 0.08 40 (79) 0.443 \u22120.1064 3138.3 0.4670 1.1462 11.212 0.753\nk\ny\nH w l t ( a d o a s c s l\nl i f D b v G e\n( m c p b p t fl f T d i v\ni g a v t y r t\nt r m s t l a t d t h I o f\nt f s G s u S d B 1\n5\nF i c l c h t N n ( a l\nt d b 1 t w t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/1/439/6540978 by G ent U niversity user on 17 August 2022 nown as a Richards curve, defined as follows ( x ) = A + K \u2212 A ( C + e \u2212B( x\u2212M) ) 1 /\u03bd .

Table 5 shows he fitted Richards curve parameters determined for the full sample All), or independently for each morphological class. The fit is shown s the green curve on Fig. 10 (right-hand panel) and follows the red ashed line extremely closely . Finally , we truncate the green line at ur minimum redshift ( z > 0.0013) to a v oid stellar contamination, nd our maximum redshift ( z < 0.1), to define our final sample election boundary. Although, we have essentially rejected 50 per ent of our original z < 0.1 sample, we have now transformed the ample from an r -band selected one to a near (99.5 per cent) massimited one with a very precisely defined selection function. The sample is now restricted to those galaxies that lie within the imits defined by our selection function. We input the selected galaxes\u2019 co-moving distances, stellar masses, stellar mass errors, selection unction, and desired functional form to fit into the DFTOOLS routine FFIT . This code returns the binned co-moving space density distriution (see Table 6 ), the functional fit (see Table 7 ), and the full coariance matrix for the fitted parameters. Fig. 11 shows the combined SMF data (black circles with yellow fill), along with the results for ach of the four GAMA regions separately (coloured discs). Giv en a surv e y selection function and a specific model for the MF e.g. a parametric Schechter function or a binned step-wise MF), the ost likely cosmic density variations as a function of mass caused by\nosmic LSS can be determined simultaneously while fitting the free arameters of the MF model. Intuitively speaking, this is possible, ecause a smooth selection function and a smooth MF normally redict a smooth source count as a function of mass. A comparison o the actual source count, then allows us to infer the LSS-driven uctuations. The mathematics and explicit form of the likelihood unction can be found in Obreschkow et al. ( 2018 , section 2.3). he only unknown in this automatic LSS correction is the overall ensity normalization of the surv e y volume. This we fix manually by mposing the condition that the total mass within the whole surv e y olume is unbiased.\nIn the left-hand panel, the DFTOOLS inbuilt LSS correction is not mplemented, and in the right-hand panel it is bringing the fields into ood alignment. In general the four regions agree well, showing variation consistent with what one might expect from cosmic ariance considerations of 25 per cent per GAMA region. We note hat the binned data for the total distribution (black circles with ellow fill) appear to exhibit a smooth distribution and extent, with easonable statistics, o v er the stellar mass range from 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 o 10 11.5 M h \u22122 70 .\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nComparing the GSMF derived for the four individual fields without he LSS correction (i.e. Fig. 11 left-hand panel), we see that the G23 egion has both the highest mass density as well as the steepest low ass upturn. This steep upturn is reminiscent of the mass function een in the Virgo cluster. There is therefore some possibility that he G23 region may intersect with an as yet undefined very nearby oosely bound group. This is not explored here, but will be considered s we obtain 21-cm radio observations in this region. We also note hat G12 exhibits a slightly steeper low-mass end, and lies a few egrees offset from the Virgo Southern spur (see Ferrarese et al. 2012 heir fig. 1). With the LSS correction implemented (i.e. Fig. 11 rightand panel), we see the four fields brought into closer alignment. t is reassuring that both with and without the LSS correction, the v erall GSMF is identical suggesting that the combination of the our distinct fields goes a long way towards ironing out the LSS.\nFinally, we note that both with and without the LSS correction, he G09 region (red data points) appears underdense, this has been a eature noted and highlighted in earlier GAMA papers and arguably ets the G09 field slightly apart. In Section 6 , we will explore AMA\u2019s o v erall o v er/under density relativ e to a 5012 de g 2 SDSS elected region. In due course, two imminent surveys will improve pon our measurements, namely the Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic urv e y (Driv er et al. 2019 ) which will surv e y 1150 de g 2 in two istinct regions to m Z \u223c 21 mag, and the recently commenced DESI right Galaxy Surv e y (Ruiz-Macias et al. 2020 ) which will surv e y 4000 deg 2 to a comparable depth as GAMA.\n.1 Comparison to previous measurements\nig. 12 (upper) shows our derived GSMF (with the LSS correction mplemented), for the combined GAMA sample (red dots), and ompared to our earlier GAMA measurements as well as notable iterature values (as indicated).

The one ob vious discrepanc y is with the SDSS data f Bernardi et al. ( 2018 ), where we see what looks like a systematic ffset at the very high mass end. Bernardi et al. ( 2018 ) explore, in etail, the difficulties of estimating the very high-mass end correctly, nd provide a range of possible mass estimations, highlighting that he uncertainty is due to many potential factors related to: significant hotometric corrections applied to the high-mass SDSS data; the mportance of the stellar population assumptions; and the role of dust. t this stage, we are not o v erly concerned, but note that where both AMA and SDSS statistics are good the surv e ys appear to agree well ithin the errors, with perhaps some indication of incompleteness t the SDSS low-mass end at \u223c10 9 M h \u22122 70 (as one might expect rom its shallower surface brightness limit of 23 mag per arcsec 2 ).\ne revisit this topic later in Section 6 following renormalization of he GAMA data to the SDSS volume.\nIncluded in the data shown on Fig. 12 are the narrow-band hotometric redshift data from the COSMOS15 release Laigle et al. 2016 ) as used by Wright et al. ( 2017 ) to determine a GSMF to very ow stellar masses (gold triangles). The Wright et al. ( 2017 ) result sed the combination of GAMA and COSMOS15 data, extending the\nSMF down to 10 7 M h \u22122 70 but with the caveat of increased errors, nd the potential for a systematic bias in the very low photometric edshift estimates (and reflected in the errors). Despite these caveats, he agreement is good, although see further discussion in Section 6.3 . n the end, our deeper analysis suggests these corrections may have een o v erestimated. We e xtend this work by no w sho wing the z < .1 GSMF from the DEVILS surv e y (Davies et al. 2018 ). The DEVILS data are a combination of many contributing surveys hat provide narrow-band photometric, spectroscopic, or grism data, s detailed in Thorne et al. ( 2021 ; see their Appendix C). Stellar asses for these data were determined by Thorne et al. ( 2021 ) using he same PROSPECT code as used for the GAMA data (i.e. Bellstedt t al. 2020b ). In plotting the Thorne et al. data, we need to incorporate n Eddington bias correction. This is due to the combination of the hotometric redshift error with the solid angle on the sky, resulting in ore high- z galaxies being scattered to z < 0.1, than low- z galaxies cattered abo v e. We estimate the scale of this effect by running a set f Monte Carlo simulations in which we perturb the redshift values y their quoted errors, and recompute the DEVILS GSMF after caling the masses for the redshift change.

( 2021 ) is reassuring.\nAs noticed in previous papers, and in particular Baldry et al. 2012 ), the GSMF appears to exhibit a plateau around 10 9.5 to 0 10.5 M h \u22122 70 . This feature may be due to a higher late-time merger ate at the high-mass end, as argued by Robotham et al. ( 2014 ). This istinctive feature has been shown to emerge at lower redshift ( z < ) by Wright, Driver & Robotham ( 2018 ) in their compendium of SMF\u2019s from z = 5 to 0. At lower masses, the GSMF turns up t 10 9.5 M h \u22122 70 and exhibits a linear slope [in log ( \u03c6) \u2212 log (M \u2217) pace] to the completeness limit. This trend is now extended by the ew data to 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 with no obvious sign of any significant ownturn or flattening. Hence, the most numerous type of galaxy n the nearby Universe must have a mass at, or more likely below,\nMNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nM\n1 t s 1 H o\ns m d r a ( s i t r p\nf f a i s v w o l p f p e g o r t S g n\nd d ( o h G d i d e c\nr s ( a t r M W 1 t\nm d c h s n 1 l 1\ns \u00d7 ( t t t a\nf\nr ( c p s b b g e G s p H s t i e d w n\n5\nW F d s\n\u03c6\nA m \u03b1\np s f t t t f w\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/1/439/6540978 by G ent U niversity user on 17 August 2022\n0 6.75 M h \u22122 70 . This is consistent with basic Jeans\u2019 mass arguments hat, in a Cold Dark Matter dominated Universe, the lowest mass ystem able to collapse rather than dissipate, should be around 0 4.5 M h \u22122 70 (assuming the baryonic mass is fully converted to stars). ence, we are gradually encroaching upon this limit, but are still just v er two orders of magnitude away. It is worth noting that the mass function is significantly less teep ( \u03b12 = \u22121.53 \u00b1 0.03, see Table 7 ) than the theoretical halo ass function ( \u03b1 = \u22121.8), and various studies have argued that this ecrease in the stellar mass to dark matter ratio, may be due to the ole of supernova feedback or stellar winds ejecting baryonic mass s well as shutting down star formation in a mass-dependent manner see re vie w of this topic by Wechsler & Tinker 2018 ). An interesting ide is that for this mechanism to work, star formation must occur n order to generate the SN and AGB winds. This mechanism would herefore suggest that every dark matter halo should contain some esidual stellar mass from this initial burst of star formation, albeit otentially extended and diffuse. This may eventually create a significant problem, as for stellar eedback (SN and Winds) to be the sole mechanisms responsible or the discrepant slopes (HMF v GSMF), we eventually require n extreme number of very low stellar mass galaxies residing in ntermediate mass haloes, i.e. with exceptionally high dark matter to tellar mass ratios. While some very low mass systems do contain ery high mass-to-light ratios (e.g. Battaglia et al. 2013 ), it is unclear hether these are fully representative of all low mass haloes. The bvious solutions are that these extreme systems are of exceptionally ow surface brightness and rendered undetectable, that some other rocess prevents stars from ever forming in lower mass haloes (i.e. a ailure to spark; Bullock et al. 2000 ), or that some external process revents the gas collapsing (Ben \u0301\u0131tez-Llambay et al. 2017 ). A viable xample might be the ambient radiation field that a higher mass alaxy e x erts on the surrounding environment to prevent the cooling f gas in nearby less massive haloes. At present, while we are finding elatively small numbers of very dark matter dominated systems, hese are typically restricted to rich cluster environments, thus far. imilarly, 21-cm studies have yet to identify strong cases of neutral as only systems which cannot be explained as ejected mass from a earby companion. From integrating our GSMF to 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 , we find a space ensity of 0.24 \u00b1 0.04 galaxies per Mpc 3 h \u22123 70 . This same density of ark matter haloes is reached for a standard Halo Mass Function HMF, see Murray et al. 2013 ) at a dark matter integration limit f \u223c10 9.6 M h \u22122 70 . This implies that our lowest mass systems must ave dark matter to stellar mass ratios abo v e 700, to reconcile our SMF with a standard CDM HMF without recourse to fully ark haloes abo v e \u223c10 9.6 M h \u22122 70 . While high, this is not entirely nconsistent with measurements of some nearby, albeit lower mass, warf systems, e.g. Segue 1 with 99.9 per cent dark matter, Simon t al. ( 2011 ), and consistent with the conclusions of the simulations ommunity summarized in Wechsler & Tinker ( 2018 ; see their fig. 2).\nAs well as exploring the stellar mass distribution, it is also worth e vie wing the total stellar mass density derived from integrating our tellar mass density function (i.e. Fig. 12 upper panel). Fig. 12 lower panel) shows the same data but multiplied through by the bscissa to make clear the contribution of each stellar mass interval o the total stellar mass density. Here, we see that the peak is elati vely narro w and centred around 10 10.8 M h \u22122 70 highlighting ho w \u2217-galaxies dominate the contribution to the stellar mass density. e find that 90 per cent of the stellar mass lies in the range from 0 9.6 M h \u22122 70 to 10 11.6 M h \u22122 70 . The distribution drops more steeply owards higher masses, indicating a minimal ( < 1 per cent) stellar\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nass contribution from supermassive galaxies ( > 10 11.6 M h \u22122 70 ), and rops more gradually towards lower stellar masses. Nevertheless, the ontribution of each mass interval to the total stellar mass density as dropped by a factor of 100 from the peak to our limiting tellar mass of 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 . This informs us that while the most umerous galaxy per decade of stellar mass has a stellar mass below 0 6.75 M h \u22122 70 , its contribution to the total stellar mass density is ikely to be minimal ( \u223c1 per cent from a simple extrapolation from 0 6.5 M h \u22122 70 to 0 M h \u22122 70 ).\nHere, we can report that by integrating the contribution to the tellar mass density, we reco v er a value of \u03c1\u2217 = (2.47 \u00b1 0.04)\n10 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 for a 737 cosmology. This equates to \u2217 = 1 . 81 \u00b1 0 . 03) \u00d7 10 \u22123 h \u22121 70 (also for a 737 cosmology). We note that hese values are as yet uncorrected for an y o v er/underdensity in he o v erall GAMA footprint, and are ef fecti vely a measurement at he median redshift of z = 0.079 and both of these issues will be ddressed in Section 6 .\nPutting aside the issue of stripped stellar mass not accounted or in the integral of the GSMF, there are three caveats to our \u2217 measurement worth considering. The first is that one can never ule out a dramatic upturn to the distribution below our mass-limit 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 ), e.g. a high space density of free-floating globular luster-like mass systems at 10 6 M h \u22122 70 . While this would appear unhysical, it is not impossible, but not supported by any observation or imulation. The second is whether our sample is missing low surface rightness systems. Without deeper data, this is al w ays hard to assess, ut we do note that the e xtensiv e search for low surface brightness alaxies in 200 deg 2 of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey by Greco t al. ( 2018 ), identified no low surface brightness galaxies abo v e the AMA magnitude limit ( r KiDSDR4 < 19.65 mag). The third is a fairly ubtle effect related to the first caveat. Its basis is that the galaxy opulation shows a significant diversity of form (faint-end slopes). ence, a valid question is whether the total stellar mass density hould be derived from the extrapolation of the total distribution, or he extrapolations of the distinct morphological types. For example, n earlier studies of the GAMA morphological mass functions, xtending down to 10 9 M h \u22122 70 , Moffett et al. ( 2016 ) identified ivergent slopes to some particular types, the extrapolation of which ould lead to an infinite stellar mass density. We now reconsider this otion by deriving the GSMFs for each morphological class.\n.2 The morphological galaxy stellar mass functions at z < 0 . 0 8\ne repeat the process of the previous section except for two changes. irst, we extract morphological sub-samples as either: (E + HE), cBD, BD, D, C, or H, see Section 3.5 , and secondly, we elect to fit a impler single Schechter function given by\n( M)d M = \u03c6\u2217e \u2212M /M \u2217 ( M\nM \u2217\n)\u03b1 d M. (3)\ns before, the three fitted parameters are defined by a characteristic ass, M \u2217, a characteristic normalization, \u03c6\u2217, and the faint-end slope, . To obtain the fitted parameters, we again make use of DFTOOLS and\nrovide the selected data, errors, and selection function. To obtain the election function, we examine the mass-to-light ratio distributions or each sub-population (see Fig. 13 left-hand panel) and determine he point at which the mass-to-light ratio encloses 95 per cent of hat population. These mass-to-light values are then combined with he r -band flux limit ( r KiDSDR4 < 19.65 mag), to derive the selection unctions shown on Fig. 13 (right-hand panel). These curves are fitted ith a Richards curve (see equation 2 ) and the values are reported\nTable 9. Single Schechter function fits to the GSMFs for various morphological classes at z < 0.08, and for the full sample with redshift cuts as indicated. Note that the log 10 ( \u03c6\u2217) values DO NOT include the renormalization to SDSS, or the correction to redshift zero (see Section 6 ).

These selection functions are used to select the rele v ant orphological sample, i.e. only those objects with masses higher han that indicated by the Richards curve are fed into the DFFIT outine to derive the morphological mass function for that class. able s 8 and 9 shows our results. Note that in the fitting process, we eed to incorporate one subtlety, which was to ensure that the fits for ach of the morphological classes adopted the same underlying LSS orrection. To do this, we stored the LSS correction identified from he full sample fit to z < 0.08 (i.e. the black curve from Fig. 14 ), and orced DFFIT to use this LSS solution for the subsequent fits for each orphological class. The resulting distributions and fits are shown in Fig. 14 (upper\nanel), and the contribution to the stellar mass density from each orphological class is shown in the lower panel along with a ie chart representation (inset). As can be seen in Fig. 14 , the ummed morphological data agrees reasonably well with our earlier otal estimate, i.e. (2.51 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 now versus 2.47 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 previously.\nEllipticals (red) dominate at the highest masses, followed by the BD systems (orange), the dBD systems (green), and finally the disc nly systems (blue) from 10 9.25 M h \u22122 70 and below. The compact gold) and hard (grey) classes contribute a small amount to the total ass density. Hence, the most frequent galaxy type is a disc, and he most massive galaxy type an Elliptical. The C and H classes tart to become more significant in number at low mass, and as\nC\nhe C class is nearly divergent, there is significant implied mass n its extrapolation and hence its value should be taken with great aution (as reflected in the error). The rise of the C and H classes t lower masses, also highlights the increasing difficulty in making lear classifications at our lowest mass-limit out to z = 0.08. Where tatistics are good, the fits appear to pass through the data points well, nd the single Schechter function appears to be a reasonable fit to he data.\nFig. 14 (lower panel) shows the same data but now with the ass multiplied ordinate to reflect the contribution of each type and\nach mass interval to the total stellar mass density. The dominant ontributions come from the cBD and E classes of (1.07 \u00b1 0.04)\n10 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 and (0.81 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 , espectively. Together, these classes make up 75 per cent of the otal stellar mass density (if one ignores the mainly extrapolated extrapolated masses). As noted, we now obtain a total stellar mass of (2.51 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 0 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 rather than (2.47 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 rom the double Schechter function fit to the full data set which is onsistent within the errors.\nT H E COSMI C STELLAR MASS DENSITY\nsingle GAMA region, at z < 0.1, co v ers \u223c400 000 Mpc 3 with a V of \u223c\u00b125 per cent (see Driver & Robotham 2010 , equation 3).\nMNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nM\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nFigure 15.

This error dominates o v er random or formal fitting errors ut can be reduced further by determining any over/underdensity elative to a wider area similar depth spectroscopic surv e y, with niform characteristics, and which encompass the GAMA regions. he only suitable surv e y, at the present time, is the Sloan Digital Sky urv e y (SDSS) which co v ers almost 50 times the area of GAMA and ully contains the G12 and G15 regions. .1 Normalization of GAMA to SDSS ig. 15 shows the full SDSS DR16 spectroscopic surv e y in gre y, and he region we have selected to normalize to in blue. The four GAMA egions are shown by the four orange boxes and only G12 and G15 re fully subsumed within the SDSS spectroscopic surv e y footprint. ur selected SDSS region is given by 130 \u2212 235 in Right Ascension deg) and 0 \u2212 55 in Declination (deg), plus two small extensions to o v er the G12 and G15 regions fully given by: 173 \u2212 187 in RA and 3.5 \u2212 0.0 in Dec. (G12 extension); and 210.5 \u2212 224.5 in RA and 2.5 \u2212 0.0 in Dec. (G15 extension). This equates to a contiguous area\nf 5012.134 deg 2 with an estimated CV (Driver & Robotham 2010 ) of 6.5 per cent. Hence, by bootstrapping to SDSS, we can theoretically escale our results, and reduce our CV error by two times. As only two of our regions lie within the SDSS footprint, we need o implement a double bootstrap. We first compare the density of the < 0.1 (or z < 0.08) G12 and G15 regions to the SDSS selected rea, using an SDSS tracer. We then compare the G12 and G15 egions to the full GAMA area, using a GAMA tracer. By combining he two density ratios, we can determine a normalization correction or the combined GAMA volume to the ef fecti ve SDSS selected olume.\nThere are a number of subtleties worth highlighting. This includes n underlying implicit assumption that the SDSS completeness and\nasking within the G12 and G15 regions are broadly consistent with he o v erall SDSS selected re gion. From fig. 2 of Driv er & Robotham 2010 ), we see that this is a reasonable assumption. We also need o identify an appropriate density tracer. Previously, we and other roups have adopted an intrinsic luminosity range, and quantified the umber -density of this tracer population between the various regions. ere, we adopt a slightly more sophisticated and stable measure. This s to use the full r -band luminosity density measurement by summing he intrinsic luminosities of all galaxies with r petro < 17.77 mag and < 0.1 within the desired volumes.\nWe find that G12 and G15 combined have a density 0.8781 times hat of our SDSS selected region i.e. these GAMA regions are\n12 per cent underdense. We also find, by summing the r -band flux f all galaxies in the GAMA regions with r KiDSDR4 < 19.65 mag nd z < 0.1 (spec- z or photo- z), that G12 and G15 are o v erdense ompared to the combined GAMA regions by \u00d71.0178. Note that his estimate included consideration of the star-mask reported in ellstedt et al. (2020a) . Hence, the o v erall renormalization from GAMA to SDSS selected t z < 0.1 is \u00d71.159 (and \u00d7 1.185 at z < 0.08). That is, we need to ultiply our total GAMA density measurements by a factor of 1.159 o renormalize to an ef fecti ve SDSS selected area of 5012 deg 2 . This factor is fully consistent with the estimate reported in\nriver et al. ( 2011 ; see their fig. 20), and most GAMA low- z ublished measurements have incorporated an appropriate upward caling. We can confirm that with the inclusion of G23, an upard scaling is still required and that o v erall GAMA represents a lightly underdense region of the Universe at z < 0.1. It is worth oting that this underdensity mainly stems from single region, 09. Hence G12, G15, and G23 can be considered reasonably epresentative. Finally, we note that if we did determine the correction based n number-density rather than luminosity-density, we find a reormalization value of \u00d71.195 ( \u00d71.220) at z < 0.1 ( z < 0.08),\nMNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nM\np o\na r G t d c 0 t C\nr t V t c t p i C\n6\nO e ( m ( a r e p G \u2248\nT a d d f m\nFigure 17.

Fig. 16 shows the same calculation as described abo v e, but now as function of redshift (black dots and line). The figure also shows the elative density of each GAMA field compared to the combined AMA density (coloured dots and lines). At very low redshift, he volumes are very small and the local supercluster structure ominates. The variations then damp as the volume grows and onverge to within a few per cent by z \u223c 0.3. Noticeably, at z \u2248 .1, we see a range in luminosity densities of \u00b114.4 per cent about he mean, which is less than the Driver & Robotham ( 2010 ) 1 \u2212 \u03c3 V estimate of \u00b125 per cent. We have also verified that the Virgo cluster, located in the central egion of the SDSS selected area, has no impact by redetermining he correction with a minimum redshift that includes or excludes the irgo cluster (the impact is in the fifth significant figure). We note hat all tables reported earlier DO NOT include the renormalization orrection to the SDSS selected region. Hence, one can choose o adopt the results of Section 4 as GAMA unnormalized with a redicted CV error of \u00b112.5 per cent, or re-scale by the factors shown n Fig. 16 to generate the GAMA normalized to SDSS values with a V error of \u00b16.5 per cent. .2 Evolution to a z = 0 . 0 CSMD measurement ne final correction, we consider is the potential for some small volution in the stellar masses o v er the redshift range explored 0 < z < 0.1). Typically, our measurement at intermediate to high ass is weighted towards the median redshift o v er our full volume\nz \u223c 0.079), ho we ver, at lo wer masses, where volume corrections re required, the density measurement is for a progressively lower edshift range. As most galaxies are still forming stars and have xisting stellar populations which are still evolving, there is the ossibility of some small mass-dependent bias in our measured SMF below 10 9 M h \u22122 70 as well as a small o v erall offset from z 0.079\u20130. We can estimate this effect from the recent DEVILS study by horne et al. ( 2021 ) who determine GSMF\u2019s from z \u2248 0.8 to 0 nd who fitted a smooth function to the total galaxy stellar mass ensity. This shows a net o v erall evolution in the cosmic stellar mass ensity from z = 0.079\u20130.0 of \u223c3.9 per cent. Hence, we advocate or a further correction of \u00d71.039 to correct our final cosmic stellar ass density measurement to a z = 0 value of \u03c1\u2217 = (2.47 \u00b1 0.04)\nNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\n10 8 \u00d7 1.159 SDSSrenorm \u00d7 1.039 z = 0correction M Mpc \u22123 h 70 or \u03c1\u2217 = 2.97 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 .\n.3 Comparison to earlier GAMA and SDSS DR7 GSMFs\nig. 17 shows the \u2018knee\u2019 region of the GSMF for GAMA I (Baldry t al. 2012 ), GAMA II (Wright et al. 2017 ), and GAMA KiDS (this ork), as well as for SDSS DR7 (Bernardi et al. 2018 ), and a recent ocal all sky compendium by Biteau ( 2021 ). A number of corrections ave been made to make each data set fully consistent, and these nclude: mass corrections to GAMA I ( + 0.11 dex), GAMA II + 0.17 dex), and Biteau ( 2021 ; + 0.04 dex; pri v ate communication), o the ProSpect masses used in GAMA KiDS (see Robotham et al. 020 , fig. 34), the cosmic variance correction of \u00d71.159 for GAMA iDS (as described abo v e). Note that at z < 0.06, the CV correction or GAMA I is negligible (see Fig. 15 ), and for GAMA II, the ethodology used a density-defining population from 0.07 < z < .19 within which the CV is expected to be small. For Bernardi et al. ( 2018 ), we implement a 11 per cent specroscopic completeness correction. This arises from consideration f the SDSS DR7 and DR16 completeness within the G12 and 15 regions, and which suggests 87 per cent total completeness to PETRO < 17.77 mag, and representing all types of incompleteness ncluding failed redshifts, fibre collisions, and the SDSS mask. As ernardi et al. ( 2018 ) incorporated a 2 per cent correction for fibre ollision incompleteness, we implement a further 1.13/1.02 per cent pward correction. Finally, all data sets are scaled to redshift zero sing the value from DEVILS (see Section 6.2 ), of \u00d71.039 for the < 0.1 data sets (GAMA II, GAMA KiDS, SDSS DR7), \u00d71.024 for he z < 0.06 data set (GAMA I and Biteau 2021 ), and \u00d71.030 for he z < 0.08 morphological sample.\nThe various mass functions on Fig. 17 , show good consistency round the \u2018knee\u2019 to within 5\u201310 per cent, but some significant ariations at the very high mass end. This is where photometric easurements become problematic for two reasons: extended high \u0301ersic index outer profiles, and blending as massive systems are ften in the centres of highly crowded regions. In particular, we ote that in some of our earlier works (e.g. Wright et al. 2017 ), we\nFigure 18.

From our deeper KiDS analysis, we can see that these orrections were in some cases e xcessiv e leading to an Eddingtonike bias at the high-mass end. To ensure we have captured all of the ux for these massive systems, we visually inspected all 20 GAMA iDS z < 0.1 objects abo v e 3 \u00d7 10 11 M h \u22122 70 and concluded that either photometric errors nor o v erblending is likely to be the case or the GAMA KiDS GSMF. .4 Comparison to recent measurements of \u2217 ig. 18 shows published estimates of the local cosmic stellar mass ensity (Driver et al. 2007 , 2018 ;; Baldry, Glazebrook & Driver 2008 ;  \u0301erez-Gonz \u0301alez et al. 2008 ; Li & White 2009 ; Peng et al. 2010 ; aldry et al. 2012 ; Bernardi et al. 2013 ; Moustakas et al. 2013 ; ckert 2016 ; Moffett et al. 2016 ; Weigel, Schawinski & Bruderer 016 ; Wright et al. 2017 ;L \u0301opez Fern \u0301andez et al. 2018 ; Carnall et al. 019 ; Leja et al. 2020 ; Bellstedt et al. 2020b ; Hashemizadeh et al. 021 ; Koushan et al. 2021 ; Thorne et al. 2021 ) o v er the past few ecades, along with our new value derived from the total GSMF, enormalized to SDSS and rescaled for evolution to z = 0 (rightmost lue data-point). The horizontal bands highlight the error-range ith the darkest blue band representing the formal fitting error, nd the lighter blue band the error including the CV uncertainty ollowing renormalization to SDSS (i.e. \u00b16.5 per cent). We note that he increase between this and earlier GAMA-based measurements an be traced back to a \u223c0.06 or \u223c0.14 dex increase in our stellar ass measurements from our recent PROSPECT analysis (Bellstedt t al. 2020b ) compared to earlier estimates reported in Taylor et al. 2011 ), or via MAGPHYS by Driver et al. ( 2018 ), respectively (with ll measurements using a Chabrier IMF, see Robotham et al. 2020 or details).\nWe conclude that the dominant error in the measurement of he cosmic stellar mass density, is now stemming from remaining\nystematic uncertainties in our stellar mass estimates, see for examle, the spread of the Bernardi et al. ( 2017 ) estimates on Fig. 18 ho discussed mass uncertainties due to flux, mass-to-light and ust attenuation issues (see also Sahu et al. 2019 ); and Hopkins 2018 ) who discuss mass uncertainties due to issues related to MF uncertainty/variation. Hence, limiting depth, incompleteness, rrors in redshift measurements, or statistical size (as opposed to urv e y volume) are no longer dominating. We also note the critical mportance of the adopted underlying initial mass function (IMF). he values shown on Fig. 18 are all for a Chabrier IMF. Note that a ange of IMF conversion factors are shown in Table 1 of Yu & Wang 2016 ) with a spread of \u00b18 per cent if one excludes a pure Salpeter MF etc (see also Madau & Dickinson 2014 ).\nThe conclusion is that the uncertainty in our measurement of the tellar mass density remains more significant than our formal errors rom this analysis suggest, with random and fitting uncertainties of 1 per cent, CV of \u00b16.5 per cent, stellar mass estimates for a fixed MF of \u00b118 per cent, and the plausible IMF range of \u00b18 per cent. n quadrature, this puts the combined error at \u00b121 per cent, this ncertainty is shown as the faint orange band in Fig. 18 and ndeed encompasses most previous measurements of the past decade although we have attempted to correct all measurements plotted to Chabrier IMF throughout).\nSUMMARY\nhrough this data release, we provide full access to the Galaxy nd Mass Assembly spectra, redshifts, and Data Management Units\nssembled o v er the past 12 yr by the GAMA Team. This release now ncludes o v er 230 000 new redshift measurements obtained using AOmega on the Anglo-Australian Telescope across five regions to SDSS < 19.8 mag, plus a small 1 de g 2 re gion in which we obtain 736 edshifts (with P ( z) > 0.9) to a fainter flux limit of r SDSS = 21.6 mag.\nAs reported in Bellstedt et al. ( 2020a ), we have now replaced he original SDSS DR6/7 photometry with new photometry based\nMNRAS 513, 439\u2013467 (2022)\nM\no d f g n a\nc h c m fl ( 1\nb ( h w a\ne m t 9 n r m ( a t\n( s r c m b w e\nt ( w y t b\nA\nW a t A l\nt T\nR\n(\nu a t M\nD r\nt\nC \u2018 C p D\nt a a\nt f\nU o T g U\na T D C b M a t i B P 3\nS e a\nC t p o\nD\nT D U -\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/1/439/6540978 by G ent U niversity user on 17 August 2022\nn the significantly deeper and higher resolution ESO VST KiDS ata (Kuijken et al. 2019 ). As this process shuffles many galaxies aintw ards and some brightwards, as well as gaining and losing some alaxies, this requires us to re-e v aluate our completeness limits. We ow define the GAMA Main Surv e y to be r KiDSDR4 < 19.65 mag cross the four primary regions (G09, G12, G15, G23).\nThe four primary regions (G09, G12, G15, G23) cover \u223c230 deg 2 , ontain 205 540 galaxies with r KiDSDR4 < 19.65 mag, for which we ave reliable redshift measurements for 195 432, i.e. 95.1 per cent omplete. For the remaining galaxies for which we lack spectroscopic easurements, we obtain photometric redshift estimates via a scaledux matching method identical to that described in Baldry et al. 2021 ). We also include EAZY photometric redshift estimates for all 8 million objects in GKVINPUTCATV02 . We have morphologically classified all galaxies with a redshift elow 0.08 as either Elliptical (E + HE), compact-bulge plus disc cBD), diffuse-bulge plus disc (dBD), disc-only (D), compact (C) or ard (H). The process is conducted blindly by three classifiers and e demonstrate better than 90 per cent consistency in almost all mass nd redshift bins. In the final stages of the paper, we construct the GSMF for ach region, the combined data set, and sub-divided into each orphological type. We use the Maximum Likelihood method from he DFTOOLS package and provide a selection function based on the 5th-percentile mass-to-light distribution combined with our new ominal flux limit of r KiDSDR4 = 19.65 mag. The final GSMF now eaches down to M \u223c 10 6.75 M h \u22122 70 extending over an order of agnitude beyond our previous estimates provided by Baldry et al. 2012 ) and Wright et al. ( 2017 ). The extension contains no surprises, nd is fully consistent with the earlier extrapolation and hence leads o no significant change in the o v erall stellar mass density.\nHence, we conclude that the z = 0 Universe contains: 2.97 \u00b1 0.04 random \u00b1 0.58 systematic \u00b1 0.20 CV ) \u00d7 10 8 M Mpc \u22123 h 70 of tellar mass bound within the galaxy population. This value includes enormalization to a 5012 de g 2 re gion of SDSS ( \u00d7 1.159), and a orrection to z = 0 ( \u00d7 1.039). Ho we ver, we do not address how uch stellar mass may reside in stripped mass in the intra-halo light, ut note that arguments based on the extragalactic background light ould suggest this must be fairly minimal ( < 5 per cent, see Driver t al. 2018 and Koushan et al. 2021 ). Further exploration of the GSMF to lower limits will continue, with he forthcoming 4MOST Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Surv e y WAVES; Driver et al. 2019 ) scheduled to commence in 2023, and hich should extend GSMF measurements to below 10 6 M h \u22122 70 . As et, the GSMF continues to rise to our detection limits and as such he most numerous galaxy type (per decade of log mass) remains to e disco v ered, and its properties and space density to be quantified.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne acknowledge the early support of the University of St Andrews, nd ongoing support from the International Centre for Radio Asronomy Research, the European Southern Observatory, Australian stronomical Optics, and Universit \u0308at Hamburg, in hosting the eadership team (SPD, AMH, JL), and the GAMA data base.
