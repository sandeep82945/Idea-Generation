    "abstractText": "The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 provided confirmation of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking as the mechanism by which fundamental particles gain mass and thus completed the Standard Model of particle physics. Additionally, it opened a new approach to searching for potential new particles. Many beyond the Standard Model theories predict new heavy particles that couple to the Higgs boson, leading to a resonant production mode of Higgs boson pairs. Other theories extend the Higgs sector by introducing additional scalar bosons that differ from the observed Higgs boson only by mass. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have searched for evidence of such processes using \u221a s = 13 TeV Run 2 proton-proton collision data at the Large Hadron Collider. This review article summarizes the latest experimental results from searches for resonant production of pairs of Higgs bosons or additional Higgs-like scalar bosons at ATLAS and CMS.",

            "text": "The 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson (H) [1,2] provided the final missing piece of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics by confirming the mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking to generate masses for fundamental particles. As with the discovery of all new particles, the discovery of the Higgs boson has provided an important new means of searching for evidence of new Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics effects or additional heavy particles. Many BSM theories predict the existence of new heavy particles that couple strongly to H, leading to the potential resonant production of Higgs boson pairs (HH). The observation of such a resonant production would appear as an excess in HH production over the SM prediction localized in the HH invariant mass (mHH) spectrum. An overview of searches for resonant production of scalar bosons by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations performed using \u221a s = 13 TeV Run 2 proton-proton (pp) collision data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented here. The searches use either a partial Run 2 dataset or the full Run 2 dataset. A comprehensive review of the status of theoretical and experimental efforts related to searches for HH production was previously presented in Reference [3]. The searches presented in this review include several updated results since the comprehensive review. In the descriptions of all searches provided in this review, the term \u201clepton\u201d refers to an electron (e) or a muon (\u00b5), unless otherwise specified. Furthermore, notation varies between analyses. Unless specified otherwise in an analysis-specific context, H refers to a SM Higgs boson or the observed Higgs boson with a mass of approximately 125 GeV, S refers to an additional scalar that has mass-dependent couplings similar to those of the Higgs boson, and X refers to a heavy scalar.

In general, the singlet field mixes with the SM Higgs boson, resulting in couplings to SM particles. After electroweak symmetry breaking, such extensions result in two scalar bosons (H and X). Assuming mX > 2mH where mH \u2248 125 GeV, the mixing can allow for X \u2192 HH decays, resulting in the resonant production of a pair of on-shell H. Mixing between singlets and the SM doublet can result in significant interference effects in the resonant and SM HH production modes [10]. Singlet benchmark models are discussed in detail in References [3,11\u201313]."

            "text": "One of the most common BSM extensions to the Higgs sector is the addition of second Higgs doublet, leading to a class of models referred to as Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDMs) [14,15]. There are several types of 2HDMs, classified by the couplings of each Higgs doublet to fermions. In Type-I 2HDMs, one doublet couples to up- and down-type quarks as well as charged leptons while the other doublet does not couple to fermions. In Type-II 2HDMs, one doublet couples to up-type quarks, and the other couples to downtype quarks and charged leptons. In lepton-specific 2HDMs, one doublet couples to all quarks and the other couples to charged leptons. In flipped-type 2HDMs, one doublet couples to up-type quarks and charged leptons, and the other couples to down-type quarks. There are additionally Type-III 2HDMs in which both doublets couple to all fermions and may or may not allow tree-level flavor changing neutral currents. All 2HDM extensions of the SM result in a total of five Higgs bosons. If there is no CP violation, these consist of two neutral CP-even scalars (H and X), a neutral CP-odd pseudoscalar (A), and two charged bosons (H\u00b1). Typically, H is treated as the observed Higgs boson with mH \u2248 125 GeV, and X is more massive and is often used as a benchmark spin-0 resonance that decays to HH. If there is CP violation, the three neutral states mix to form mass eigenstates with indefinite CP quantum numbers, one of which is identified as the observed Higgs boson [16].\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 3 of 66\nTwo free parameters are used in 2HDMs: the ratio of the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of the two Higgs fields, denoted as tan \u03b2, and, in the case of CP conservation, the mixing of the two neutral CP-even scalars, denoted as sin \u03b1."

In the MSSM, it is not possible for up-type and down-type fermions to couple to the same Higgs doublet, requiring it to be a Type-II 2HDM. The habemus MSSM (hMSSM) [19,20] refers to the MSSM when the observed Higgs boson with mH \u2248 125 GeV is taken into account. As a result of this measurement, the MSSM breaking scale is expected to be greater than 1 TeV, and the dominant radiative corrections to the Higgs boson masses are fixed. The hMSSM is characterized by only two parameters, tan \u03b2 and the mass of the pseudoscalar, mA. Other variants of the MSSM that take the Higgs boson mass measurement into account exist but are beyond the scope of this review.\n2.1.4. RS Model\nThe Randall\u2013Sundrum (RS) model [21] describes warped extra dimensions as a proposed solution to the Hierarchy Problem. This is achieved through the introduction of a small spatial dimension along which SM particles cannot propagate [22,23], a scenario that is referred to as RS1. As a consequence, additional particles such as a spin-0 radion [24\u201327] or the first Kaluza\u2013Klein (KK) excitation of a spin-2 graviton (GKK) [28,29] are predicted. The RS model is described by three parameters: the ultraviolet cutoff \u039bR, the size of the extra dimension l, and the warp factor constant \u03ba. The warp factor of the theory is defined as (e\u2212\u03bal), which appears in the space-time metric. The graviton case has an additional dimensionless free parameter \u03ba/MPl, where MPl is the effective four-dimensional reduced Planck scale of 2\u00d7 1018 GeV. This parameter is sometimes denoted as c or k\u0303.\n2.1.5. Resonant VBF HH Production\nMost resonant HH production models and phenomenological studies assume heavy scalar production via gluon\u2013gluon fusion (ggF). However, in many models containing extra scalars [30,31], vector boson fusion (VBF) is the dominant production mode. This predominantly occurs in models in which the 125 GeV Higgs boson does not fully align with fluctuations around the electroweak vacuum [32], with CP violation [33] or a significant nondoublet component of the electroweak vacuum [34]. In singlet extensions of the Higgs sector, VBF production becomes comparable to ggF production for heavy scalars with a TeV mass scale."

This corresponds to 126\u2013139 fb\u22121 of data collected between 2015 and 2018. The analyses are designed to search for resonances in the ggF and VBF production modes.\n4.1.1. ATLAS ggF bb\u0304bb\u0304 Search\nThe first analysis [42] is a search for ggF resonant HH production, and the results are interpreted in the context of spin-0 and spin-2 benchmark models. The heavy CP-even neutral scalar in a 2HDM is used as the spin-0 benchmark model and is generated with a narrow width that is much smaller than the detector resolution. The spin-2 benchmark model is a Kaluza\u2013Klein graviton with \u03ba/MPl = 1 with a generated width ranging from 3% to 13% of the resonance mass. Both resolved and boosted topologies are exploited to set limits on the two models in the mass range from 251 GeV to 3 TeV. The resolved channel is used to search for resonances in the mass range from 251 GeV to 1.5 TeV, and the boosted channel is used to search for resonances in the mass range from 900 GeV to 3 TeV. Both channels are statistically combined in the overlapping mass range. In the resolved channel, pairs of H candidates are reconstructed from four anti-kt R = 0.4 jets using a boosted decision tree (BDT). Events are split into 4b and 2b categories if they contain at least four b-tagged or exactly two b-tagged jets. In the 4b category, the four pT-leading b-tagged jets are used, and in the 2b category, the two b-tagged jets and the two pT-leading non-b-tagged jets are used.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 6 of 66\nEvents are selected using a combination of triggers requiring one or two high-ET b-tagged jets plus additional jets from 126 fb\u22121 of data collected between 2016 and 2018. An upper bound cut is applied on the pseudorapidity separation between the two H candidates to reduce the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet background. Additionally, a cut is applied to reject any events that are kinematically consistent with the hadronic decay of a top quark. Three regions are defined in the m(H1) \u2212 m(H2) plane, where m(H1) and m(H2) denote the masses of the reconstructed Higgs boson candidates ordered in pT. The signal region (SR), control region (CR), and validation region (VR) are shown in Figure 4, superimposed over data in the 2b category.\nFollowing the event selection, the \u201ccorrected m(HH)\u201d is constructed as the final discriminating variable. This is performed by rescaling the four momenta of the two H candidates to obtain m(H1) = m(H2) = 125 GeV. The background after the selection cuts are applied is approximately 95% composed of QCD multijet events and is estimated using a data-driven method. Other background processes are ignored. A neutral network (NN) is used to estimate the background in the 4b SR from data in the 2b SR. The corrected m(HH) distribution in the 4b SR is shown in Figure 5 for the background estimate, data, and several spin-0 signal hypotheses.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 7 of 66\nIn the boosted channel, two anti-kt R = 1.0 (large-R) jets are used to reconstruct the two H candidates. The channel uses 139 fb\u22121 of data collected between 2015 and 2018. Events are selected using a combination of triggers that require at least one high-ET large-R jet. Events are required to contain at least two large-R jets with a mass of mJ > 50 GeV and have at least one ghost-associated [43] variable radius track jet. The two pT-leading large-R jets that satisfy the mass and track jet requirements are selected as the two H candidates. An upper bound cut is applied on the pseudorapidity separation between the two H candidates to reduce the QCD multijet background. The events are split into three signal-enriched (high-tag) categories based on the number of b-tagged track jets associated with each of the H candidates. The 4b category requires each H candidate to have at least two associated b-tagged track jets. The 3b category requires one H candidate to have at least two associated b-tagged track jets and the other H candidate to have exactly one associated track jet. The 2b category requires each H candidate to have exactly one associated b-tagged track jet. Each high-tag category has an associated \u201clow-tag\u201d category that is used to estimate the background. Sketches of H candidates in the high-tag and low-tag categories are shown in Figure 6.\nSimilar to the resolved channel, the SR, CR, and VR are defined in the m(H1)\u2212m(H2) plane. The three regions are shown in Figure 7 superimposed over data from events from the 3b \u201clow-tag\u201d category, denoted as 2b-1 f .\nThe background after the selection cuts are applied is dominated by QCD multijet events with a tt\u0304 contribution ranging from 10% to 30% of the background.

A Type II 2HDM [15] is used as the broad resonance with a width of 10-20% of268 the resonance mass and is obtained by setting the ratio of the vacuum expectation values269 for the two Higgs doublet to tan(\u03b2) = 2.0 and sin(\u03b2\u2212 \u03b1) = 0.6 where \u03b1 is the mixing270 angle between the two CP-even Higgs bosons. It should be noted that this parameter271 choice has been excluded by a combination of Higgs boson measurements [46]. A generic272 scalar with a fixed width of 4 MeV is used as the narrow resonance.273 The analysis uses resolved reconstruction techniques and sets limits on both models274 in the mass range of 260 GeV to 1 TeV. Pairs of H candidates are reconstructed from275 b-tagged central anti-kt R = 0.4 jets and forward jets are used to select events with the276 VBF topology.277 Events are selected using a combination of b-jet triggers requiring at least one or278 two b-tagged jets from 126 fb\u22121 of \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collision data collected between 2016279 and 2018. Events are required to have exactly four b-tagged central jets and at least two280 forward jets. The two pT-leading forward jets with opposite sign of \u03b7, referred to as281 VBF jets, are required to be separated by a pseudorapidity of at least 5.0 and have an282 invariant mass greater than 1 TeV.283 The four central b-tagged jets are paired into the three possible combinations to284 construct the two H candidates. To be considered, each pairing is required to satisfy285 requirements on the \u2206R between each pair of jets. If there are more than one pairing that286 satisfies the \u2206R requirements, the pairing that results in invariant masses that are the287 most consistent with two H is used.288 Background events are suppressed with requirements designed to select signal-like289 events. Requirements are placed on the pT of the vector sum of the jets, the pseudora-290 pidity between the H candidates, and a variable (XWt) designed to reject events that are291 kinematically consistent with the hadronic decay of a top quark.292\nSystematic uncertainties ar evaluated for both channels. The dominant source of uncertainty for both is the data- riven background estimate. Several components are evaluated to cover various aspects of the methods. Additionally, experimental uncertainties are evaluated for the det ctor modeling, especially of hadronic jets and the b-tagging methods. Finally, theoretical systematic uncertainties are evaluated on the renormalization and factorization scales and parton showering for the signal. These are also varied for the tt\u0304 background simulation along with the POWHEG damping parameter, which regulates radiation at high transverse momentum. A profile likelihood ratio test statistic is used to test the production cross-section times branching ratio for the signal models. The likelihood fit is conducted in bins of corrected m(HH) for the resolved channel and m(HH) for the boosted channel. Data are fit separately in the resolved and boosted channels. All categories are fit simultaneously in the boosted channel. In the boosted channel, the 2b category is only used for resonance masses of at least 2 TeV. No significant excess over the background prediction is observed. Upper limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio are set at the 95% confidence level using the asymptotic CLs method [44]. The limits from both channels are combined statistically in the resonance mass range of 900 GeV to 1.5 TeV. The combined expected and observed limits are shown in Figure 9. The theoretical prediction for the bulk RS model with \u03ba/MPl = 1 is also shown. The model is excluded for masses between 298 and 1440 GeV.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 10 of 66\nVersion December 24, 2021 submitted to Symmetry 10 of 70\n4.1.2.

A Type II 2HDM [15] with a width of 10\u201320% of the resonance mass is used as the broad resonance benchmark mode. It is obtained by setting the ratio of the vacuum expectation values for the two Higgs doublet to tan(\u03b2) = 2.0 and sin(\u03b2\u2212 \u03b1) = 0.6, where \u03b1 is the mixing angle between the two CP-even Higgs bosons. It should be noted that this parameter choice has been excluded by a combination of Higgs boson measurements [46]. A generic scalar with a fixed width of 4 MeV is used as the narrow resonance benchmark model.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 11 of 66\nThe analysis uses resolved reconstruction techniques and sets limits on both models in the mass range of 260 GeV to 1 TeV. Pairs of H candidates are reconstructed from b-tagged central anti-kt R = 0.4 jets, and forward jets are used to select events with the VBF topology. Events are selected using a combination of b-jet triggers requiring at least one or two b-tagged jets from 126 fb\u22121 of \u221a s = 13 TeV data collected between 2016 and 2018. Events are required to have exactly four b-tagged central jets and at least two forward jets. The two pT-leading forward jets with an opposite sign of \u03b7, referred toas VBF jets, are required to have a large pseudorapidity separation and have an invariant mass greater than 1 TeV. The four central b-tagged jets are paired into the three possible combinations to construct the two H candidates. To be considered, each pairing is required to satisfy requirements on the \u2206R between each pair of jets. If there is more than one pairing that satisfies the \u2206R requirements, the pairing that results in invariant masses that are the most consistent with two H is used. Background events are suppressed with requirements designed to select signal-like events. Requirements are placed on the pT of the vector sum of the jets, the pseudorapidity between the H candidates, and a variable (XWt) designed to reject events that are kinematically consistent with the hadronic decay of a top quark. Similar to the ggF analysis, three regions are defined in the mlead2b \u2212msubl2b plane, where mlead2b and m subl 2b are the masses pT-leading and pT-subleading H candidates, respectively.

The non-all-hadronictt\u0304 and SM ggF HH backgrounds are normalized to their SM predictions. The post-fit m4b distribution in the SR is shown in Figure 11 for the background estimate, data, and signal hypotheses for a narrow spin-0 resonance and SM VBF HH.\nSystematic uncertainties are evaluated on the background estimate, theoretical predictions, and detector modeling. The QCD multijet background estimate is the source of the dominant systematic uncertainties. The experimental modeling of the jet energy scale and resolution also contribute significantly. The statistical uncertainty is larger than the combined systematic uncertainty.

            "text": "The CMS Collaboration has conducted two searches for ggF resonant HH production in the bb\u0304bb\u0304 final state using Run 2 LHC data. The analyses are designed to search for signal hypotheses with low masses and resolved topologies and with high masses and boosted topologies.\n4.2.1. CMS Resolved bb\u0304bb\u0304 Search\nThe first analysis [48] is a search for ggF resonant HH production with a resolved topology using a partial Run 2 dataset corresponding to 35.9 fb\u22121 of data collected in 2016. The search is interpreted in the context of narrow spin-0 and spin-2 benchmark models. A bulk radion with \u039bR = 3 TeV and \u03bal = 35 is used as the spin-0 benchmark model and a Kaluza\u2013Klein graviton with \u03ba/MPl = 0.5 and \u03bal = 35 [49] is used as the spin-2 benchmark model. Both benchmark models are generated with a width of 1 MeV. Limits are set on both benchmark models in the mass range from 260 GeV to 1.2 TeV. The analysis is split into the low-mass region (LMR) for resonance masses less than 580 GeV and the medium-mass region (MMR) for resonance masses greater than 580 GeV. Events are selected with a combination of two triggers that require at least four anti-kt R = 0.4 jets, at least three of which are required to be b-tagged. After the trigger selection, events are required to contain at least four b-tagged jets. The selected jets are paired to form\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 14 of 66\ntwo H candidates. The candidates are randomly assigned the indices 1 and 2 and have masses mH1 and mH2 . Both H candidates are required to meet mass criteria in the LMR and criteria on the \u2206R separation of the constituent jets in the MMR. A variableR is defined to show the consistency of event kinematics with those of HH events. If multiple pairs of H candidates are found in an event, the pair that minimizesR2 is used. A multivariate regression technique is used to correct the b-tagged jets\u2019 pT, following the procedures in References [50,51]. This improves the mass resolution of the reconstructed H candidates from 10\u201313% to 6\u201312% as well as the mass scale. An additional correction is applied to the b-tagged jet momenta to constrain the H candidate masses to be 125 GeV. The impact of the regression and constraint on the resonance mass, reconstructed from the two H candidates, for spin-2 resonances is shown in Figure 13.\nTwo regions are defined in the mH1 \u2212mH2 plane based onR. The SR and SB are shown in Figure 14 superimposed over data from events in the MMR.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 15 of 66\nThe signal and background are both estimated in the SR using parametric models, fit separately in the LMR and MMR. The signal parametric models are obtained using a Gaussian function in the MMR and the sum of two Gaussian functions in the LMR fit to the simulated distribution of the reconstructed resonance mass mX. The background consists primarily of QCD multijet events with a 10\u201315% contribution from tt\u0304, which has an mX shape similar to that of the QCD multijet background. The parametric model used to describe the background is fit to the mX distribution of data in control regions consisting of the SB as well as events in both the SR and SB in which one of the four jets used to reconstruct mX fails the b-tagging criteria. The LMR is split into LMR1 with mX \u2208 [260, 310] GeV and LMR2 with mX \u2208 [310, 580] GeV.

CMS Boosted bb\u0304bb\u0304 Search\nThe second analysis [52] is a search for ggF resonant HH production with a boosted topology using the full Run 2 dataset. This corresponds to 138 fb\u22121 of data collected between 2015 and 2018. The search is interpreted in the context of narrow spin-0 and spin-2 benchmark models. A bulk radion with \u039bR = 3 TeV and \u03bal = 35 is used as the spin-0 benchmark model, and a Kaluza\u2013Klein graviton with \u03ba/MPl = 0.5 and \u03bal = 35 is used as the spin-2 benchmark model. Both benchmark models are generated with a width of 1 MeV. Limits are set on both benchmark models in the mass range from 1 to 3 TeV. The analysis is split into the fully-boosted category where both H \u2192 bb\u0304 are reconstructed with large-R jets and the semiresolved category where one H \u2192 bb\u0304 is reconstructed with a large-R jet and the other is reconstructed with two anti-kt R = 0.4 jets. Events are selected with a combination of triggers that require hadronic jets. The first trigger requires a high scalar sum of the pT of all anti-kt R = 0.4 jets in the event (HT). The second trigger requires a large HT and a pair of jets with an invariant mass greater than 900 GeV and a small psuedorapidity separation. The third trigger requires an anti-kt R = 0.8 jet with a mass of at least 30 GeV. Events in the fully-boosted category are required to have at least two anti-kt R = 0.8 jets, the pT-subleading of which is required to have a mass between 110 and 140 GeV. The DeepAK8 tagger [53] is used to identify large-R jets as coming from H \u2192 bb\u0304 decays. The tagger provides either loose or tight thresholds, leading to two signal regions, one in which\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 17 of 66\nboth large-R jets pass the tight criteria and the other in which both jets pass at least the loose criteria and no more than one jet passes the tight criteria. Events in the semiresolved category are required to have at least one anti-kt R = 0.8 jet that passes the DeepAK8 tight threshold and at least two b-tagged anti-kt R = 0.4 jets. Events are required to have at least one pair of b-tagged R = 0.4 jets where both jets are \u2206R > 0.8 from the H \u2192 bb\u0304 large-R jet and are within \u2206R < 1.5 from each other. If multiple pairs of b-tagged R = 0.4 jets satisfy this criteria, the pair with the largest sum of b-tagging scores is selected as the resolved H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate. This is first tried with the pT-leading large-R jet and if no pairs are found, it is tried with the pT-subleading large-R jet. The large-R jet that leads to a successful pairing is identified as the boosted H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate. If no pair is found, the event is rejected. The invariant mass of the selected pair of R = 0.4 jets is required to be 90 GeV < mjj < 140 GeV. A modified \u201creduced\u201d invariant mass of the HH system, mred, is used in place of the direct invariant mass of the selected jets. The reduced mass is defined as\nmred = mJ J \u2212mJ1 \u2212mJ2 + 2mH (2) for the boosted category where mJ J is the invariant mass of the two H \u2192 bb\u0304 large-R jets and mJ1 and mJ2 are the masses of the individual large-R jets. For the semiresolved category, the reduced mass is defined as\nmred = mJ jj \u2212mJ \u2212mjj + 2mH (3) for the boosted category where mJ jj is the invariant mass of the two H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidates, mJ is the mass of the H \u2192 bb\u0304 large-R jet, and mjj is the invariant mass of the H \u2192 bb\u0304 R = 0.4 jet pair. Events in both categories are required to have mred > 750 GeV. Additionally, a maximum pseudorapidity separation requirement is imposed on the two H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidates. The background consists almost entirely of QCD multijet and tt\u0304 events, both of which are estimated using data-driven methods that also make use of simulation. The QCD multijet background estimate is based on the ratio of events whose pT-leading large-R jet passes the DeepAK8 tagging criteria to events whose whose pT-leading large-R jet fails the tagging criteria. The ratio is found using simulation and corrected using data outside the mass window requirement on the pT-subleading large-R jet or R = 0.4 jet pair to predict the background as a function of mred. The tt\u0304 background is estimated using simulation that is fit to data in dedicated control regions that shift the mass window requirements to contain the top quark mass peak. Slices of the mJ \u2212mred plane for data, the background estimate, and a signal hypothesis are shown in Figure 17.

For low resonance masses, the bb\u0304bb\u0304 channel presents the challenges of a large QCD multijet background and a roughly isotropic resolved signal topology that is difficult to distinguish from background. For high resonance masses, however, the large bb\u0304bb\u0304 branching ratio can be efficiently exploited using boosted topologies.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 19 of 66\nIn the resolved topology, the greatest difficulty comes from pairing b-tagged jets to form two H candidates. This pairing is necessary to provide kinematic features that can be used to separate signal from background. As shown in Figure 10, algorithms with strong mH requirements, such as the one used in the ATLAS VBF search, can sculpt the background distribution to peak exactly in the signal region. The use of machine learning techniques to pair the jets, such as in the ATLAS resolved ggF search, can help to reduce this sculpting while maintaining a good signal reconstruction efficiency. As shown in Figure 4, this can result in less severe sculpting of the background estimate with a broad peak partially overlapping with the signal region. The MMR in the CMS resolved search uses a \u2206R requirement to determine the pairing strategy, which does not sculpt the background significantly. As shown in Figure 14, this results in a smooth data distribution, consisting primarily of QCD multijet background events. The use of large-R jets in the boosted topology significantly simplifies the reconstruction and identification of H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidates. Particle-flow large-R jets identified with the constituent-based DeepAK8 algorithm used by CMS and calorimeter-based large-R jets with b-tagged track jets used by ATLAS both provide excellent performance.Additionally, the simple reconstruction of using two large-R jets or one large-R jet plus two b-tagged small-R jets does not appreciably sculpt the background estimate as shown in Figures 7 and 17. As shown in Figure 9, there is a significant range of resonance masses for which boosted and resolved reconstruction techniques are comparably sensitive. Ensuring orthogonality between the selection criteria and combining the two analysis techniques in the region of overlap can result in significantly stronger limits than either topology alone."

The first analysis uses resolved topologies to search for resonance masses between 251 GeV and 1.6 TeV. The second analysis uses boosted topologies to search for resonance masses between 1 and 3 TeV.\n5.1.1. ATLAS Resolved bb\u0304\u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 Search\nThe first analysis [54] is a search for ggF resonant HH production with a resolved topology in the \u03c4had\u03c4had and \u03c4lep\u03c4had channels. The search is interpreted in the context of a generic narrow spin-0 benchmark model. The signal samples are generated with a width of 10 MeV. Limits are set on the benchmark model in the mass range from 251 GeV to 1.6 TeV. The analysis is split into two channels based on the decay mode of the \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 system. The channel in which both \u03c4 leptons decay hadronically (\u03c4had) is referred to as \u03c4had\u03c4had and the channel in which one \u03c4 lepton decays hadronically and the other decays leptonically (\u03c4lep) is referred to as \u03c4lep\u03c4had. The presence of a \u03c4had is indicated by the presence of its visible decay products (\u03c4had-vis). Events in the \u03c4had\u03c4had channel are selected using a combination of triggers that require either one or two \u03c4had-vis. The triggers used between 2016 and 2018 that require two \u03c4had-vis also require one or two anti-kt R = 0.4 jets. Additionally, events are required to have exactly two \u03c4had-vis with opposite electric charge and exactly two b-tagged anti-kt R = 0.4 jets. Events are rejected if they contain an electron or muon. The invariant mass of the di-\u03c4\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 20 of 66\nsystem (mMMC\u03c4\u03c4 ) is estimated using the Missing Mass Calculator (MMC) [55], which uses both \u03c4had-vis and EmissT with the assumption that E miss T is exclusively from the neutrinos from the \u03c4 lepton decays. Events are required to have mMMC\u03c4\u03c4 > 60 GeV. Events in the \u03c4lep\u03c4had channel are selected using a combination of single-lepton triggers (SLTs) that require a single lepton and lepton-plus-\u03c4had-vis triggers (LTTs) that require a single lepton and a \u03c4had-vis. The LTTs used in 2017 and 2018 one or two jets. Events are split into the SLT and LTT categories based on the triggers used to select them. If an event passes SLT and LTT requirements, it is removed from the LTT category. Events in both categories are required to have exactly one electron or muon, a \u03c4had-vis with opposite electric charge to the lepton, and exactly two b-tagged anti-kt R = 0.4 jets. The MMC is used to estimate the di-\u03c4 mass from the \u03c4had-vis, the lepton, and EmissT . Events are required to have mMMC\u03c4\u03c4 > 60 GeV. Additionally, events are required to have an invariant mass of the two b-tagged jets of mbb\u0304 < 150 GeV. The backgrounds in both channels are estimated using a combination of simulation and data-driven methods. The primary backgrounds come from top quark, Z+jets, W+jets, diboson, single Higgs boson, and QCD multijet processes. These backgrounds contain \u03c4had-vis originating from a \u03c4had decay (true \u03c4had-vis), from a misidentified quark- or gluoninitiated jet (fake \u03c4had-vis), or from a misidentified lepton. Background events with true \u03c4had-vis and misidentified leptons as well as background with fake \u03c4had-vis other than tt\u0304 and QCD multijet are estimated using simulation. The normalizations of the tt\u0304 and Z plus heavy flavor jets (Z+HF) backgrounds are derived using a dedicated control region. The QCD multijet and tt\u0304 backgrounds containing one or more fake \u03c4had-vis are estimated using data-driven methods. In the \u03c4lep\u03c4had channel, the QCD multijet and tt\u0304 backgrounds are estimated using a fake factor method. Fake factors are found separately for each background process using dedicated control regions. In the \u03c4had\u03c4had channel, two different data-driven methods are used for the QCD multijet and tt\u0304 backgrounds. The QCD multijet background is estimated using a fake factor method similar to the one used in the \u03c4lep\u03c4had channel. The tt\u0304 background with fake \u03c4had-vis in the \u03c4had\u03c4had channel is estimated using simulation with corrections derived from data in the tt\u0304 control region from the \u03c4lep\u03c4had data-driven background estimate. The mHH distributions for the \u03c4had\u03c4had and \u03c4lep\u03c4had SLT categories are shown in Figure 19 for the background estimate, data, and several signal hypotheses.

ATLAS Boosted bb\u0304\u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 Search\nThe second analysis [56] is a search for high-mass ggF resonant HH production using a novel reconstruction technique for boosted final states in the \u03c4had\u03c4had channel. The search is interpreted in the context of a generic narrow spin-0 benchmark model. The signal samples are generated with a width of that is much smaller than the detector resolution. Limits are set on the benchmark model in the mass range from 1 to 3 TeV. A novel technique is used to reconstruct and identify boosted H \u2192 \u03c4had\u03c4had decays such that the hadronic decay products overlap in the detector and cannot be distinguished using standard \u03c4had reconstruction. In this method, a di-\u03c4 object is reconstructed from an ungroomed anti-kt R = 1.0 jet with pT > 300 GeV. The constituents of the large-R jet are reclustered into anti-kt R = 0.2 subjets, the two pT-leading of which are used to reconstruct the di-\u03c4 system. Tracks are matched to the subjets and are referred to as \u201c\u03c4 tracks\u201d. Other tracks associated to the large-R jet are referred to as \u201cisotracks\u201d. All tracks are required to pass criteria on their association to the primary vertex. The charge of each subjet is defined as the sum of the charge of the \u03c4-tracks, and the charge product of the di-\u03c4 object is the product of the charges of the two subjets. An illustration of a di-\u03c4 object is shown in Figure 22.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 23 of 66\nRequirements are placed on di-\u03c4 objects to identify boosted H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 decays. Both of the pT-leading subjets are required to have either one or three associated tracks within \u2206R < 0.1 to separate \u03c4had decays from hadronic jets. Additionally, a BDT is trained to differentiate between H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 and quark- or gluon-initiated jets. The BDT uses information about the \u03c4 tracks, isotracks, pT-leading subjets, and large-R jet. A cut is implemented on the BDT output to have an approximately 60% signal efficiency. Events are selected using triggers that require one high-pT large-R jet. Additionally, events are required to contain at least two large-R jets, at least one of which is a di-\u03c4 object. If multiple di-\u03c4 objects exist, the one with the highest pT is selected as the H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidate. The H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidate is required to have no more than three subjets, and the pT-leading subjets are required to be within \u2206R < 0.8 of each other. The two pT-leading subjets are also required to have charges whose product is \u00b11. Events are also required to have a large-R jet with a mass larger than 50 GeV and separated from the H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidate by \u2206R > 1.0 to reconstruct the boosted H \u2192 bb\u0304 decay. Finally, events have a minimum EmissT requirement and are vetoed if they contain an electron, a muon, or more than one b-tagged large-R jet. Three signal regions, two control regions, and three validation regions are defined based on the charge product of the H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidate, the number of b-tagged track jets in the H \u2192 bb\u0304 jet, the |\u2206\u03c6| between the EmissT and the H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidate, the mass of the H \u2192 bb\u0304 jet, and the reconstructed mass of the visible HH system mvisHH . The signal regions are defined with a charge product of \u22121, exactly two b-tagged track jets in the H \u2192 bb\u0304 jet, |\u2206\u03c6| < 1.0 between EmissT and the H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidate, and an H \u2192 bb\u0304 jet mass between 60 and 160 GeV. The signal regions are split by mvisHH . For signal hypotheses with mX \u2264 1.6 TeV, no requirement is placed on mvisHH . For signal hypotheses with mX \u2265 1.6 TeV, mvisHH is required to be at least 900 GeV, and for mX \u2265 2.5 TeV, mvisHH is required to be at least 1.2 TeV. The signal hypotheses with mX = 1.6 and 2.5 TeV are each evaluated with both mvisHH requirements that are relevant. Following the signal region requirements, the primary backgrounds come from QCD multijet with hadronic jets misidentified as di-\u03c4 objects as well as ZH and Z+jets events with Z \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 decays. The QCD multijet background is estimated with a data-driven technique that uses a control region in which the di-\u03c4 candidate has a charge product of +1 and is validated in two validation regions. The Z+jets background is estimated using simulation with a normalization derived from data in a control region with zero b-tagged track jets and validated in a validation region. An additional normalization is derived for Z+jets events with heavy-flavor jets from data in a control enriched with Z \u2192 `+`\u2212 events where ` is either an electron or a muon. Other background processes including W+jets, diboson, and events containing top quarks are estimated using simulation.\nThe distribution of mvisHH in the signal region without any requirement on m vis HH is\nshown in Figure 23 for data, the background estimate, and two signal hypotheses. The primary systematic uncertainties come from the data-driven background estimates. Additional systematic uncertainties are evaluated on the signal modeling including the choice of PDF and parton shower modeling. Other systematic uncertainties are found to be negligible compared to the statistical uncertainty. A single bin profile-likelihood fit is conducted for each signal hypothesis. No significant excesses are observed over the predicted background. The upper limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio are set at 95% CL using the CLs method and are shown in Figure 24."

[57]\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 26 of 66\nThe dominant systematic uncertainties come from the QCD multijet background estimate, the cross-section of the simulated backgrounds, and the modeling of the detector response for \u03c4 leptons. Systematic uncertainties are additionally evaluated on the detector response modeling for other particles, the lepton trigger modeling, and theoretical uncertainties on the signal simulation. A simultaneous binned maximum-likelihood fit is performed to the mKinFitHH distributions in all of the analysis categories. No significant excesses are observed over the predicted background. Upper limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio are set at 95% CL using the asymptotic CLs method and are shown in Figure 26.

CMS Boosted bb\u0304\u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 Search\nThe second analysis [60] is a search for ggF resonant HH production with a boosted topology using a partial Run 2 dataset of 35.9 fb\u22121 of data collected in 2016. The search is interpreted in the context of narrow spin-0 and spin-2 benchmark models. A bulk radion with \u039bR = 1 TeV is used as the spin-0 benchmark model, and a Kaluza\u2013Klein graviton with k\u0303 = \u03ba/MPl = 0.5 is used as the spin-2 benchmark model. Both benchmark models are generated with a width that is smaller than the experimental resolution. Limits are set on both benchmark models in the mass range from 900 GeV to 4 TeV. The analysis is split into the \u03c4had\u03c4had and \u03c4lep\u03c4had channels, and events are reconstructed using boosted techniques that make use of large-R jets. A dedicated algorithm is used to reconstruct boosted H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidates in the \u03c4had\u03c4had and \u03c4lep\u03c4had channels. First, Cambridge-Aachen R = 0.8 jets are used as seeds. The clustering sequence is undone iteratively until two subjets are found that each have a mass less than 2/3 that of the full jet. A \u03c4 lepton reconstruction algorithm is used on both subjets, and a BDT is used to identify \u03c4had. If no \u03c4had is identified, the procedure is repeated with anti-kt R = 0.4 jets as seeds. The H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidate consists of either two \u03c4had or one \u03c4had and a lepton. Events are selected with a combination of triggers that require large EmissT along with other criteria such as high-pT jets. Additionally, events are required to contain one H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidate and a H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate built from an anti-kt R = 0.8 jet with a mass of 105\u2013135 GeV and either one or two b-tagged subjets. Events are also required to have a large EmissT , a di-\u03c4 mass estimated with the SVFit algorithm between 50 and 150 GeV, and an invariant mass mX calculated from the H \u2192 bb\u0304 and H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 candidates greater than 750 GeV. Finally, events are rejected if they have any b-tagged anti-kt R = 0.4 jets that do not overlap with the H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate or if the two \u03c4 leptons have a \u2206R separation greater than 1.5. Following the selection, events are divided into categories based on the number of \u03c4had and the number of b-tagged subjets in the H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate. The primary background processes are tt\u0304 and V+jets. The tt\u0304 background is estimated using the simulation with a normalization derived from data in a control region with at\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 28 of 66\nleast one b-tagged anti-kt R = 0.4 jet that does not overlap with the H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidates. The V+jets background is estimated using data in regions in which the H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate mass is in the range of 30\u201365 GeV or greater than 135 GeV. The distributions of both background processes are fit with analytic functions that are used to estimate the background contribution in the signal region. A transfer function is used to extrapolate the V+jets estimate to the signal region. The distributions of mX for data, the background estimate, and an example signal hypothesis in the 1 b-tag categories are shown in Figure 28.

The lower panel shows the difference between data and the background estimate divided\nby the statistical uncertainty in data. [60]\nSystematic uncertainties are evaluated on the background estimate, the choice of730 PDF and scales for the signal, and modeling of the detector response. The dominant731 uncertainties come from the tt\u0304 and V+jets estimate normalization, the choice of signal732 PDF and scales and the modeling of \u03c4 lepton identification.733 A combined profile-likelihood fit of signal and background is done in the mX734 distribution. No significant excess over the background prediction is observed. Upper735 limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio are set on both models at 95%736 CL using the CLs method. The limits are shown in Figure 29. The theoretical predictions737 for a bulk radion with \u039bR = 1 and for a Kaluza-Klein graviton with k\u0303 = \u03ba/MPl = 0.5738 are also shown. The bulk radion model is excluded for masses below 2.7 TeV.739\n5.2.3. Comparison of bb\u0304\u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 searches740 Both ATLAS and CMS have performed searches with the bb\u0304\u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 final state using741 resolved and boosted topologies. The resolved analyses provide excellent sensitivity742 to resonance masses below 1 TeV. Both resolved analyses make use of the \u03c4lep\u03c4had743 and \u03c4had\u03c4had channels. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate signal from744 background and data-driven techniques are used to estimate the background processes745 that include hadronic jets misidentified as \u03c4 leptons. A major difference between the746 ATLAS and CMS analyses is that the CMS analysis uses mHH as the fit variable while the747 ATLAS analysis uses the PNN output for the fit. The PNN score fit may be the cause of748 the broad nature of the excess observed around 1 TeV due to the fact that the resonance749 mass information is not directly used.750 The CMS boosted search makes use of the \u03c4lep\u03c4had and \u03c4had\u03c4had channels using large-751 R jets to reconstruct the H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 decay. This results in sensitivity that is competitive752 at high resonance masses. The ATLAS boosted search uses the \u03c4had\u03c4had channel with753 dedicated di-\u03c4 objects to reconstruct the H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 decay. This provides a significantly754 better selection efficiency at high resonance masses than resolved reconstruction methods,755 however, the sensitivity is not competitive with other channels.

All benchmark models are generated with a width of 1 MeV. Limits are set on all benchmark models in the mass range from 260 to 900 GeV. Events are selected using triggers that require two photons that pass isolation requirements and have an invariant mass of m\u03b3\u03b3 > 90 GeV. The two pT-leading of which are selected to form the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 candidate and are required to pass identification requirements and have an invariant mass of 100 GeV < m\u03b3\u03b3 < 180 GeV. The two photons are required to have transverse momenta that are at least 33% and 25% of m\u03b3\u03b3. Events are also required to have at least two anti-kt R = 0.4 jets, each of which is separated from the nearest selected photon by \u2206R > 0.4. If there are more than two jets, the two with the highest b-tagging scores are selected to form the H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate. The selected jets are required to have an invariant mass of 70 GeV < mjj < 190 GeV. Two methods are implemented to improve the mass resolution of the reconstructed objects. A multivariate regression technique based on heavy jet fragmentation features and EmissT is used to correct the energy of the selected jets and improve the reconstructed H \u2192 bb\u0304 mass resolution. Additionally, a modified invariant mass of the \u03b3\u03b3jj system, M\u0303X , is used in place of the invariant mass m\u03b3\u03b3jj. The modified invariant mass is defined as\nM\u0303X = m\u03b3\u03b3jj \u2212mjj \u2212m\u03b3\u03b3 + 2mH . (4)\nAs shown in Figure 30, M\u0303X gives an improved mass resolution for resonant signals.\nThe analysis is split into low- and high-mass categories for signal hypothesis with mX \u2264 600 GeV and mX \u2265 600 GeV, respectively, with mX = 600 GeV being used in both categories. A BDT is trained in each category to separate signal from background. The BDTs use the b-tagging information for the selected jets, transverse momentum balance variables of the \u03b3\u03b3 and jj systems, and three helicity angles of the \u03b3\u03b3, jj, and \u03b3\u03b3jj systems in the Collins\u2013Soper frame of the four-body system [62] as inputs. The BDTs are trained on the ensemble of signal samples in each category as well as background events taken from data in a control region in which one of the two selected photons fails the identification requirements. The analysis is performed in unique signal regions for each signal hypothesis, defined using a M\u0303X window. Within each of these regions, the BDT output is used to define highand medium-purity categories. The criteria for the purity categories for a signal hypothesis depend on the mass category containing the signal hypothesis. The signal hypotheses are parameterized using fits of a double-sided Crystal Ball function [63], which consists of a Gaussian core and asymmetric power law tails, to both m\u03b3\u03b3 and mjj in each signal region. The backgrounds containing a single Higgs boson are modeled using functions fit to the m\u03b3\u03b3 and mjj distributions and are normalized to their SM predictions. A double-sided Crystal Ball function is fit to the background m\u03b3\u03b3\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 31 of 66\ndistributions. Either a double-sided Crystal Ball function or a Bernstein polynomial is fit to the background mjj distributions, depending on the production mechanism. The \u03b3\u03b3+jets background is modeled using first and second order Bernstein polynomials fit to data from the control region that are downsampled to match the total number of data events seen in the signal region. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated on the single Higgs boson background and signal models. The experimental uncertainties include the modeling of the detector response for photons, jets, and b-tagging. Theoretical uncertainties include uncertainties on \u03b1S and the choice of PDF as well as cross-section calculations for the single Higgs boson background processes.

The modified mass is defined as\nm\u2217bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 = mbb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212mbb\u0304 \u2212m\u03b3\u03b3 + 250 GeV. (5)\nAs shown in Figure 32, m\u2217bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 gives an improved resolution for resonant signals.\nA BDT-based method is used to separate signal from background. All signal samples are used together in the training, reweighted event-by-event to have the same m\u2217bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 distribution as the background events. Two separate BDTs are trained: one optimized for separating signal from the continuum \u03b3\u03b3 background and the other optimized for separating signal from backgrounds containing a single Higgs boson (primarily ZH and tt\u0304H). The outputs of the two BDTs are combined to construct a single discriminating variable. A minimum threshold on the combined BDT score is chosen for each signal hypothesis to maximize signal significance while ensuring a minimum number of events in the sideband region.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 33 of 66\nFollowing the selection requirements, the background consists of the production of single Higgs bosons in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay mode, SM production of HH in the bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 decay mode, and continuum \u03b3\u03b3+jets events that either contain at least two real photons or one real photon and one or more jets misidentified as photons. The continuum \u03b3\u03b3+jets background is parameterized with a functional form fit to a high-statistics simulated background template and normalized using data in the sideband region. The potential bias of various analytic functions on the signal event yield, referred to as \u201cspurious signal\u201d, is used to determine the optimal functional form. The functional form with the minimal number of degrees of freedom while remaining below a spurious signal threshold is chosen as exp(a \u00b7m\u03b3\u03b3). The signal as well as backgrounds involving a single Higgs boson and SM HH production are parameterized by fitting the m\u03b3\u03b3 distribution in simulated samples. The distributions are fit with a double-sided Crystal Ball function [65]. The m\u03b3\u03b3 distributions for signal and background simulation as well as data after the optimized BDT score requirements are applied are shown for two signal hypotheses in Figure 33.

The search is interpreted in the context of narrow spin-0 and spin-2 benchmark models. The RS model in warped extra dimensions with \u039bR = 1 TeV and \u03bal = 35 is used for both scenarios. A bulk radion is used as the spin-0 benchmark, and a Kaluza\u2013Klein graviton with k\u0303 = \u03ba/MPl = 0.1 is used as the spin-2 benchmark. Events are selected using triggers that require two leptons. Additionally, events are required to contain two b-tagged anti-kt R = 0.4 jets and two leptons with opposite electric charge and a dilepton invariant mass between 12 GeV and mZ \u2212 15 GeV, where mZ is the mass of the Z boson. The dilepton invariant mass requirement suppresses backgrounds containing quarkonia resonances and Z+jets processes while preserving signal events in the bb\u0304WW\u2217 channel and in the bb\u0304ZZ\u2217 channel when the off-shell Z boson decays leptonically.

This is performed using data from a control region that has no b-tagged jet requirement. Events from this region are weighted to estimate the effects of the b-tagging requirement in the signal regions. A PNN is used to discriminate signal from the large tt\u0304 background. The PNN makes use of kinematic variables and the flavor of the dilepton pair (e+e\u2212, \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212, or e\u00b1\u00b5\u2213). Three regions are defined using the invariant mass of the two b-tagged jets, mjj.

The PNN output is used as the final discriminant in each region. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated on the data-driven background estimate, theoretical predictions, and detector response. Theoretical uncertainties are evaluated on the choice of PDF as well as the renormalization and factorization scales used in simulation. Detector response uncertainties are evaluated on trigger efficiencies, lepton identification,\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 35 of 66\njet energy measurements, and b-tagging. The data-driven background uncertainty consists of propagated detector response uncertainties plus an additional normalization uncertainty.

The search is also interpreted in the context of the N2HDM where the masses of H1 and H2 are both set to 125 GeV and H3 is treated as the heavy spin-0 resonance. Two benchmark points are chosen with tan \u03b2 = 0.5 and 2.0.

The H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate is reconstructed from the pair of jets with the highest values of the b-tagging discriminant if there are at least two b-tagged jets. If there is a single b-tagged jet, it is paired with the jet that gives an invariant mass closest to 125 GeV to form the H \u2192 bb\u0304candidate.

A likelihood function is constructed from five probability density functions to extract the three components of the neutrino momentum, an indicator of whether the hadronically decaying W boson is on- or off-shell, and a correction factor for the pT of the qq\u0304 jet. The full H \u2192WW\u2217 system is reconstructed from the lepton, the extracted neutrino momentum, and the corrected qq\u0304 jet. Additionally, a discriminating variable D`\u03bdqq\u0304 is constructed using the likelihood function. The H \u2192WW\u2217 decay is reconstructed in the DL channel with assumptions about the decay kinematics. The \u03b7 of the two neutrino system \u03bd\u03bd is set to that of ``. Additionally, the \u03bd\u03bd invariant mass is set to 55 GeV, which is the average of the truth-level distribution in simulated signals. The H \u2192WW\u2217 system is reconstructed from \u03bd\u03bd and ``. In both channels, the HH invariant mass mHH is calculated from the reconstructed H \u2192WW\u2217 and the bb\u0304 jet. Additional criteria are used to separate signal from background. In the SL channel, the ratio of the H \u2192WW\u2217 pT to mHH , denoted as pT/m, is required to be greater than 0.3. In the DL channel, several criteria are applied to `` and EmissT . The `` system is required to have an invariant mass between 6 and 75 GeV and a angular separation of \u2206R`` < 1.0. Additionally, EmissT and `` are required to have a \u2206\u03c6 separation less than \u03c0/2. Finally, events are required to have EmissT > 85 GeV. Events are split into twelve categories based on several properties. The lepton flavor and the DeepAK8 discriminant DZ/H\u2192bb\u0304 on the bb\u0304 jet are used in both the SL and DL channels. Additionally, discriminants on the H \u2192WW\u2217 system are used to create highand low-purity categories in the SL channel. These discriminants are D`\u03bdqq\u0304 and the \u03c42/\u03c41 N-subjettiness ratio [69] for the qq\u0304 jet, which is a substructure variable used to identify jets that are consistent with a two-body hadronic decay. The category labels are defined in Tables 1 and 2. Two Control Regions (CRs) are defined to validate the SM background estimation and systematic uncertainties. The top CR is defined to select events containing top quarks, especially tt\u0304. This CR is defined by requiring at least one b-tagged anti-kt R = 0.4 jet that is far from the bb\u0304 jet. Additionally, requirement on pT/m is removed for the SL channel, and the \u2206R`` requirement is changed to \u2206R`` > 0.4 for the DL channel. The top CR is divided into the same twelve categories as the signal region. The nontop CR is defined to select events from Z/\u03b3\u2217+jets, W+jets and QCD multijet processes. This CR is defined in the same\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 40 of 66\nway as the signal region, except the DZ/H\u2192bb\u0304 requirement on the bb\u0304 jet is changed to reject events containing H \u2192 bb\u0304 decays. The nontop CR is divided into six categories following the lepton flavor and H \u2192WW\u2217 purity discriminants.\nThe background is split into components using generator-level information to ensure distinct mbb\u0304 distributions. These components are defined by the number of generator-level quarks from the immediate decay of a top quark or vector boson that are within \u2206R < 0.8 of the reconstructed bb\u0304 jet axis. The \u201cmt\u201d component consists of events in which three quarks fulfill the criterion. The \u201cmW\u201d component consists of events in which two quarks do. The \u201clost t/W\u201d component consists of events in which one quark does. The \u201cq/g\u201d component consists of all other events. The first three consist primarily of tt\u0304 events, and the q/g component consists primarily of W+jets and QCD multijet events. Signal and background are modeled in the mHH\u2212mbb\u0304 plane in each of the twelve event categories using smooth templates created from simulation. The background templates are modeled using conditional probabilities of mbb\u0304 as a function of mHH based on distributions of the two variables in simulation. The signal templates are modeled similarly but using conditional probabilities of mbb\u0304 and mHH as a function of the resonance mass mX . The mbb\u0304 and mHH distributions in the \u00b5 bT LP category are shown in Figure 38 for the background estimate, data, and example signal models. Alternate background templates for all four components are built with parameters proportional to mHH and 1/mHH . For the \u201cq/g\u201d and \u201clost t/W\u201d background components, additional templates are built with parameters proportional to mbb\u0304 and 1/mbb\u0304. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated on the background and signal models. The background uncertainties include variations of the background component normalizations, the bb\u0304 jet mass, and the template definitions. The signal uncertainties include uncertainties on theoretical predictions, luminosity measurements, pileup modeling, and detector response modeling for leptons, jet mass and energy scale, jet substructure, and b-tagging. The data are interpreted with a simultaneous two-dimensional maximum likelihood fit in the mbb\u0304 \u2212mHH plane in all twelve categories. No significant excesses are observed over the predicted background. The upper limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio are set on both models at 95% CL using the CLs method and are shown in Figure 39. The theoretical predictions for a bulk radion with \u039bR = 3 TeV and for bulk gravitons with \u03ba/MPl = 0.3 and \u03ba/MPl = 0.5 are also shown. The expected 95% CL upper limits for each of the twelve event categories are shown independently in Figure 40.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 41 of 66 Version December 24, 2021 submitted to Symmetry 44 of 70\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nE ve\nnt s\n/ 6 G\neV\n(13 TeV)-1138 fb\nCMS , bT, LP\u00b5\nHH) = 0.2 pb\u2192(X \u0392\u03c3\nData q/g bkg.

            "text": "The ATLAS Collaboration has conducted a search for ggF resonant HH production in the bb\u0304WW\u2217 channel in the bb\u0304`\u03bdqq\u0304 decay mode [70] using a partial Run 2 dataset of 36.1 fb\u22121 of data collected in 2015 and 2016. The search is interpreted in the context of narrow spin-0 and spin-2 benchmark models. A generic scalar is used as the spin-0 benchmark model. Two Kaluza\u2013Klein bulk graviton models with c = \u03ba/MPl set to 1.0 and 2.0 are used as the spin-2 benchmark models. The benchmark models are generated with a narrow width that is much smaller than the detector resolution. Limits are set on all benchmark models in the mass range from 500 GeV to 3 TeV. The analysis is split into resolved and boosted channels that are sensitive to resonance masses less than and greater than approximately 1 TeV, respectively. The resolved analysis uses anti-kt R = 0.4 jets to reconstruct all hadronic decay products. The boosted analysis uses a combination of anti-kt R = 0.4 jets and anti-kt R = 1.0 (large-R) jets. Events in both channels are selected with a combination of triggers that require a single lepton. Events are also required to contain at least one lepton that fulfills criteria on the impact parameters relative to the primary vertex. Events in the resolved channel are required to have at least four anti-kt R = 0.4 jets, exactly two of which are required to be b-tagged. The two b-tagged jets are used to reconstruct the H \u2192 bb\u0304 candidate. If there are exactly two untagged jets, they are used to reconstruct the hadronic W boson candidate Whad. If there are more than two untagged jets, the three pT-leading jets are considered, and the pair with the smallest \u2206R separation is used to reconstruct Whad. The full H \u2192WW\u2217 \u2192 `\u03bdqq\u0304 topology is reconstructed by solving for the z-component of the neutrino momentum using the Higgs boson mass constraint. If two real solutions exist, the result that minimizes \u2206R between the neutrino and the lepton is used. If only a complex solution exists, the real part of the solution is used. The H \u2192WW\u2217 system is reconstructed from the lepton, the neutrino solution, and Whad. Three signal regions are defined to be sensitive to different ranges of resonance masses. The first targets signal hypotheses with a mass of 500 GeV. The second is the low-mass range\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 43 of 66\nthat targets resonance masses between 600 GeV and 1.3 TeV. The third is the high-mass range that targets resonance masses between 1.4 and 3 TeV. A set of requirements on kinematic variables is optimized to maximize the expected sensitivity to signal hypotheses in each signal region. The variables used are EmissT , the mass and pT of the WW\u2217 system, the mass and pT of the bb\u0304 system, and the \u2206R separation between the two reconstructed W bosons. The same selection is used for spin-0 and spin-2 signal hypotheses. The dominant backgrounds come from tt\u0304 events with subdominant contributions from QCD multijet, W/Z+jets, single top quark, and diboson processes. The tt\u0304 background is estimated using simulation and then normalized using data in tt\u0304-enriched control regions that correspond to each signal region. The QCD multijet background is estimated in each signal and tt\u0304 control region using a data-driven method. The other backgrounds are all estimated using simulation.

            "text": "ATLAS and CMS have both performed searches in bb\u0304VV\u2217 channels. The large H \u2192 bb\u0304 and H \u2192 VV\u2217 branching fractions and the good QCD multijet suppression due to leptonic final states help to make these channels sensitive across a wide range of resonance masses. CMS performed two analyses that search for low-mass resonances in the 2-lepton bb\u0304VV\u2217 channel. The first is optimized for the bb\u0304WW\u2217 channel, and the second is optimized for the bb\u0304ZZ\u2217 channel in both the bb\u0304``qq\u0304 and bb\u0304``\u03bd\u03bd decay modes. Both of these channels have complex signature, and machine learning techniques are used to maximize sensitivity. These channels are nonetheless limited in their sensitivity compared to other channels at low mass. The ATLAS bb\u0304WW\u2217 analysis uses resolved techniques to identify and reconstruct the 1-lepton H \u2192WW\u2217 system. This is complicated by the fact that half of the signal events contain a very soft lepton from the decay of the off-shell W boson, decreasing the efficiency of the single lepton triggers. The resolved analysis is further complicated by the fact that in the other half of signal events, the hadronic W boson is off-shell, resulting in low-pT jets. Additionally, the neutrino reconstruction method is detrimental to the analysis sensitivity. In a significant fraction of events, using the H mass constraint results in the correct solution being mathematically impossible to obtain. In addition, the H mass constraint strongly sculpts the background to look like signal. In the boosted analysis, the hadronic W boson decay products overlap with each other and with the lepton for the resonance masses that result in a boosted H \u2192 bb\u0304 decay. As a result, the overlap removal between the lepton and jets results in a low signal selection efficiency and inclusion of radiated jets in the H \u2192WW\u2217 reconstruction. Future iterations of the analysis would benefit from additional triggers. The resolved analysis would benefit from more sophisticated selection and reconstruction techniques. The boosted analysis would benefit significantly from particle flow large-R jets and leptons for the H \u2192WW\u2217 reconstruction. The CMS boosted bb\u0304WW\u2217 analysis makes use of particle flow large-R jets and demonstrates the sensitivity of the 1- and 2-lepton channels for large resonance masses. For masses above 3 TeV, the single muon channel is competitive with the bb\u0304bb\u0304 channel. For masses above 1 TeV, the 2-lepton channel can provide additional sensitivity that is comparable to the 1-lepton and bb\u0304bb\u0304 channels."

The search is interpreted in the context of a generic narrow spin-0 benchmark model. The signal samples are generated with a width that is much smaller than the detector resolution. Limits are set on the benchmark model in the mass range from 260 to 500 GeV. The analysis is split into channels by the number of leptons in the final state. The channels are defined as having two leptons with the same sign electric charge, three leptons, and four leptons. The two-lepton channel is split into three categories based on the flavor of the leptons (ee, e\u00b5 and \u00b5\u00b5). The three-lepton channel is split into two categories based on the number of same-flavor opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pairs (NSFOS = 0 and NSFOS = 1, 2). The four-lepton channel is split into four categories based on the four lepton invariant mass (m3` < 180 GeV and m3` > 180 GeV) and the number of SFOS lepton pairs (NSFOS = 0, 1 and NSFOS = 2).\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 49 of 66\nEvents are selected using triggers that require either one or two leptons. In the two lepton channel, events are required to have exactly two leptons with the same sign electric charge and at least three anti-kt R = 0.4 jets. Events in the three lepton channel are required to have exactly three leptons with a summed electric charge of \u00b11 and at least two jets. Both channels have additional requirements on EmissT and the pT of the leptons. Events are rejected if they contain a SFOS lepton pair with an invariant mass m`` of |m`` \u2212mZ| < 10 GeV or m`` < 15 GeV. In the four lepton channel, events are required to have exactly four leptons with a summed electric charge of 0. Events are rejected if they have a SFOS lepton pair with m`` < 4 GeV. Events in all channels are rejected if they contain any b-tagged jets. The backgrounds include processes containing prompt leptons, leptons with incorrectly identified charges, and fake leptons that consist of nonprompt leptons and hadronic jets misidentified as leptons. The prompt lepton backgrounds include diboson, triboson, and tt\u0304Z processes and are estimated using simulation. The two- and three-lepton channels have nonprompt lepton backgrounds that come from the conversion of prompt photons in V\u03b3 processes that are estimated using simulation. The remaining fake lepton background contributions and the incorrectly identified charge background are estimated using datadriven methods.

The primary background process in the \u03c4lep\u03c4had final state is tt\u0304 production with one real lepton and one real \u03c4 lepton, which is estimated using simulation. In the \u03c4had\u03c4had final state, the background is dominated by QCD multijet events with hadronic jets misidentified as \u03c4had and Z+jets events where the Z decays into two real \u03c4had.

Three dedicated control regions (CRs) enriched in QCD multijet, W+jets and tt\u0304 events are used to determine the fake factors associated with each process. The QCD multijet CR is defined by a requirement that the two \u03c4 lepton visible decay products have the same sign electric charge. A large transverse mass of the lepton and EmissT requirement and a veto on b-tagged jets are used to define the W+jets CR. Events in the tt\u0304 CR are required to have more than two leptons. Corrections to the fake factors are derived in additional control regions to account for nonclosure effects.\nAll other background processes for both final states are estimated using simulation. Experimental and theoretical uncertainties are evaluated on the background estimates\nas well as the signal hypotheses. Uncertainties are evaluated on several aspects of the detector response modeling, the dominant of which is the \u03c4had trigger efficiency and the rate at which leptons are misidentified as \u03c4had. The \u03c4-embedding process has associated uncertainties, including an uncertainty on the composition of the events. The fake factor method has uncertainties that include normalization and nonclosure effects. An extended binned likelihood is used to fit the outputs of the NNs in each of the five categories.

Ad itionally, the mH constraint allows the \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 system to be approximately reconstructed as a way to discriminate signal from background. The exclusion limits are presented in a two-dimensional mass plane under the assumption of the NMSSM. The ATLAS analysis uses the WW\u2217WW\u2217 decay mode in multilepton final states to search for SS production. The search is constrained to mS between 135 and 165 GeV. Under the assumption that the sum rule is not followed, S\u2192WW\u2217 has the dominant branching ratio for mS > 135 GeV. The upper bound is used based on the assumption that for mS > 2mt, S would decay primarily into tt\u0304. This assumption has been shown to be invalid. Future iterations of the search would benefit from an extended mass range. Additionally, the exclusion limits in future iterations would be more useful if presented in a two-dimensional plane.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 63 of 66\nThese are the first two experimental results testing the existence of such models. A wide range of final states and topologies need to be studied to provide a comprehensive search for both SH and SS production. The two searches represent the beginning of a much larger search program for both collaborations."

            "text": "A comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art experimental searches for resonant production of scalar boson pairs by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations using \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collisions from Run 2 LHC data is presented. The searches use between 35.9 and 139 fb\u22121 of data. Searches for resonant HH production are performed in numerous channels by both ATLAS and CMS. The results from the searches are interpreted in the context of multiple benchmark signal models. A summary of the searches performed by ATLAS is given in Table 3 and a summary of the searches performed by CMS is given in Table 4. Results from the individual channels are combined and shown in Sections 9.1 and 9.2.\nAdditionally, a search for SH production in the bb\u0304\u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 channel is performed by CMS, and a search for SS production in the WW\u2217WW\u2217 channel is performed by ATLAS. No significant excesses have been observed, but searching for resonant scalar pair production is a very active area of research with many ongoing analyses in both ATLAS and CMS. Many updated and new search results are expected as the full Run 2 datasets continues to be analyzed and as the LHC Run 3 data collection begins.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 260 64 of 66\nFunding: The author gratefully acknowledges the support of BMBF Germany.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: No new data were created or analyzed in this study.
