The portion of the text mentioning future research direction is not explicitly stated in the provided text. The text primarily focuses on the methodology, results, and implications of the current study regarding the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties of Cordyceps militaris spent substrate extract. For future research directions, one typically looks for phrases like "further research is needed," "future studies should investigate," or similar language indicating areas that were not covered or questions that arose from the current study's findings. Since such statements are not directly provided in the text you've shared, it's challenging to extract specific sentences about future research directions without additional context or sections of the paper that might discuss limitations or suggestions for future work.
