We find that S06355 at z = 7.67 and S10612 at z = 7.66 are similar to local Green Peas and Blueberries. In contrast, S04590 at z = 8.50 appears to be significantly different from the other two galaxies, most resembling extremely low-metallicity systems in the local Universe. Perhaps the most striking spectral feature in S04590 is the curiously high [O III ] \u03bb4363/[O III ] \u03bb5007 ratio (RO3) of 0.048 (or 0.055 when dust-corrected), implying either extremely high electron temperatures, > 3 \u00d7 10 4 K, or gas densities > 10 4 cm \u22123 . Observed line ratios indicate that this galaxy is unlikely to host an AGN. Using photoionization modelling, we show that the inclusion of high-mass X-ray binaries or a high cosmic ray background in addition to a young, low-metallicity stellar population can provide the additional heating necessary to explain the observed high RO3 while remaining consistent with other observed line ratios. Our models represent a first step at accurately characterizing the dominant sources of photoionization and heating at very high redshifts, demonstrating that non-thermal processes may become important as we probe deeper into the Epoch of Reionization.",

Emission line ratios have been widely used at lower redshifts\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). ty.

Ho we ver, to ate, the lack of sensitive space-based near-infrared spectroscopy has eant that detailed emission line studies of the ISM within the Epoch f Reionization ( z 6) have only been possible in the rest-frame farnfrared (most notably with ALMA), where few systems have been bserved (e.g. Carniani et al. 2020 ). As a result, many studies have nstead placed constraints on the ISM conditions of galaxies within he Epoch of Reionization using various samples of local galaxies eemed to be analogues of high-redshift galaxies (e.g. \u2018Green Peas\u2019; ardamone et al. 2009 ; Yang et al. 2017a , \u2018Blueberries\u2019; Yang et al. 017b , low-metallicity galaxies; Izotov et al. 2019 , etc.). The recent successful launch and commissioning of the James ebb Space T elescope ( JWST ; Rigby et al. 2022 ) is set to change this andscape. In particular, the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec; erruit et al. 2022 ; Jakobsen et al. 2022 ) enables deep spectroscopy o be obtained across the full \u223c1\u20135 \u03bcm wavelength range, allowing s to study rest-optical emission line ratios of z 6 galaxies with nprecedented sensitivity . Already , NIRSpec spectroscopic follow p of more than 40 new high-redshift galaxy candidates identified rom NIRCam Early Release Observations (ERO; Program ID 2736, I: K. Pontoppidan) of the SMACS J0723.3-7327 lensing cluster as revealed prominent detections of numerous rest-frame optical mission lines (Pontoppidan et al. 2022 ), enabling for the first ime: (1) comparisons between the ISM conditions of \u2018high-redshift nalogues\u2019 and true z 6 galaxies; and (2) direct constraints on the SM conditions of z 6 galaxies from rest-optical emission lines.\nTo constrain the formation and evolution of some of the earliest tructures in the Universe, it is vital to compare the observed pectroscopic properties with predictions from models. This includes oth photoionization models of the ISM (e.g. Gutkin, Charlot & ruzual 2016 ; Nakajima & Maiolino 2022 ), or numerical simulations hat attempt to model the rele v ant physics from first principles (e.g. atz et al. 2019 ). Such comparisons will allow us to accurately nfer the dominant sources of ionizing photons and the important ooling and heating processes in high-redshift galaxies. To this nd, in this work, we investigate the rest-frame optical emission ines in three galaxies at z > 7.5 in the SMACS0723 field and ompare their spectroscopic properties with various low-redshift alaxy populations and infer the physics that is go v erning the ISM n the early Universe.\nThe layout of this paper is as follows: we discuss the JWST IRSpec ERO data used in this study, along with reduction steps, roperties of the three z > 7.5 galaxies and emission line fitting ethodology in Section 2 . We discuss insights obtained from mission line ratios and compare the observations of galaxies t z > 7.5 with those in the local Universe in Section 3 . In ection 4 , we explore the physics that can generate the curiously igh [O III ] \u03bb4363/[O III ] \u03bb5007 ratio observed at z = 8.5 using a uite of photoionization models. Our discussion and conclusions are resented in Section 5 .\nDATA A N D EMISSION LINE FITTING\ne use data from JWST NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) bservations of the SMACSJ0723.3-7327 galaxy cluster taken on 022 Jun 30, as part of the public ERO data release (Program ID 736, PI: K. Pontoppidan, Pontoppidan et al. 2022 ). The 0.2 arcsec \u00d7\n.46 arcsec MSA shutters are configurable and can be used to acquire pectra of hundreds of sources in a single field-of-view (Ferruit et al. 022 ). The spectra were taken in two filter/disperser combinations: 170LP/G235M and F290LP/G395M which combine to span from .66\u20135.10 \u03bcm with a resolving power of R \u223c 1000. The MSA conguration involved placing slitlets comprised of a column of at least hree consecutive open shutters in a single column on each target. wo 8753-s observations were obtained for this field (Obs 007 and bs 008 hereafter), each of which involved a three-point nodding patern to enable local background subtraction, for a total of \u223c17 507 s. Our analysis in this paper is performed on the publicly available 1 xtracted 1D spectra presented in Curti et al. ( 2022 ). These resulted rom processing Stage 1 outputs from the JWST data calibration ipeline with the GTO pipeline (NIRSpec GTO collaboration, in reparation). These data were reduced assuming a point-like source rofile, although from NIRCam imaging we see that the sources re marginally resolved. While this assumption may introduce some ncertainty on the absolute flux calibration, the analysis presented in his paper is based only on emission line flux ratios. We estimate hat the assumed source profile affects these flux ratios at the 10 per cent level. Background subtraction was performed locally y subtracting the background flux as measured by neighbouring empty\u2019 shutters. The reader is directed to Curti et al. ( 2022 ) for pecific details about the calibration of these data. Finally, we note hat, although we used the same 1D extracted spectra, the emission ine fitting presented here was done independently of that in Curti t al. ( 2022 ).\nThis study focuses on three objects confirmed to lie at z > 7.5: 04590 at z = 8.50 (RA: 110.89533, Dec: \u221273.44916), S06355 at z = .67 (RA: 110.84452, Dec: \u221273.43508), and S10612 at z = 7.66 (RA: 10.89533, Dec: \u221273.43454). These objects are all gravitationally ensed by the foreground cluster; ho we ver, crucially for this study, the chromatic nature of gravitational lensing means that the emission ine ratios are magnification-independent, and therefore, the results resented here are not affected by magnification at all. Extracted 1D pectra of all three objects along with the identified emission lines re shown in Fig. 1 .\nWe run emission line fitting for the following rest-optical emission ines, identified as being detected in the spectra: [O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729, Ne III ] \u03bb3869, H \u03b4, H \u03b3 , [O III ] \u03bb4363, H \u03b2, [O III ] \u03bb4959, and [O III ] 5007. We note that all of the emission lines used in this study are easured in the F290LP/G395M filter/disperser setting, so there is o uncertainty introduced by comparing the relative calibration of hese two settings. We find the emission line profiles can be well fit y a single Gaussian function and use the best fitting parameters to nfer line fluxes and ratios.\nTo obtain the best-fitting Gaussian, we model the continuum where detected) or noise level around each emission line as a inear fit and measure its median and standard deviation. Besttting Gaussians (red) for the main emission lines investigated in his study are shown in Fig. 1 . Although we do not force the width f the Gaussians to be consistent across all emission lines fitted, we nd good agreement in the measured full-width at half-maxima of he best-fitting Gaussians ( \u2248200\u2013250 km s \u22121 , consistent with being nresolved at R \u223c 1000). We find that our \u2018local\u2019 estimates of the ontinuum/noise that we use to fit Gaussians (blue dashed line) are roadly consistent with the noise estimates in the spectra returned by he data reduction pipeline (grey solid line) in line with expectations rom weak to no continuum detection.

We find secure detections of H \u03b2, [O III ] \u03bb4959, and [O III ] \u03bb5007 cross all three galaxies. The [O II ] \u03bb\u03bb 3726 , 3729 doublet is unreolved, and is weak with respect to [O III ] \u03bb5007, as evidenced by the elatively high [O III ]/[O II ] ratios (see Table 1 ) for all three galaxies. nterestingly, the [O III ] \u03bb4363 auroral line is securely detected in 04590 and S10612 with S/N \u2248 5.3 and \u22486.3, respectively, with a ower S/N \u2248 2.8 detection in S06355. We also securely detect H \u03b4 nd H \u03b3 in the galaxies, in addition to the [Ne III ] \u03bb3869 and \u03bb3967 ines, although the [Ne III ] \u03bb3967 line is blended with H . We then correct the emission line fluxes for the effects of dust exinction based on the observed Balmer decrement H \u03b3 /H \u03b2, applying he appropriate dust correction following the Small Magellanic Cloud xtinction curv e from Gordon et al. ( 2003 ), assuming an intrinsic alue of 0.468 corresponding to n e = 100 cm \u22123 and T = 10 4 K (e.g. sterbrock & Ferland 2006 ). For S04590 we find that dust correction f with A V = 0.64 \u00b1 0.20 is required to achieve a Balmer decrement f 0.468, 2 in line (albeit slightly lower) with what was reported y Curti et al. ( 2022 ). This dust extinction value is consistent with he lo w-metallicity, lo w-stellar mass galaxies at high-redshift in the PHINX 20 simulation (Katz et al. 2022a ). We note that even without dust correction, the RO3 value for this particular galaxy is much igher than is typically observed. We find that the other two galaxies equire no dust correction, i.e. A V < 0.1. Despite employing slightly different emission line measurement echniques, the emission line ratios we measure are in agreement ith those reported by Curti et al. ( 2022 ). The emission line ratios nd their uncertainties employed in this study are given in Table 1 . INSIGHTS F RO M REST-FRAME O P T I C A L MISSION LINES e start our analysis of the observed emission line ratios of the hree z > 7.5 galaxies by comparing them with various populations f lower redshift galaxies. Our goal is to address the question: how imilar are reionization-epoch galaxies to low-redshift galaxies and o local analogues of high-redshift galaxies?\nIn Fig. 2 we show various strong-line diagnostics: O III ] \u03bb4363/[O III ] \u03bb5007 (RO3) versus [O III ] \u03bb5007/[O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 729 (O32; top left); RO3 versus [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/[O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 729 (bottom left); RO3 versus [O III ] \u03bb5007/H \u03b2 (top right); and O III ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729/H \u03b4 versus [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/H \u03b4 (bottom right). In\nAs we discuss below, the electron temperature measured for S04590 is 10 4 K. If we instead apply a dust correction assuming a Balmer decrement alue at n e = 100 cm \u22123 and T = 3 \u00d7 10 4 K, the dust-corrected value of RO3 ncreases to 0.062 for S04590.\n3\nh\nll panels, we show emission line ratio measurements from SDSS 3 or galaxies and quasars, split based on the Kauffmann et al.

For additional comparison, where data is available, e show the locations of low-redshift Seyfert 2 nuclei (Armah t al. 2021 ), low redshift analogues in the form of Green Peas Yang et al. 2017a ), Blueberries (Yang et al. 2017b ), and extremely ow-metallicity galaxies (12 + log (O/H) 7.5; Izotov et al. 2019 ), s well as extreme emission-line galaxies (Amor \u0301\u0131n et al. 2015 ).\nInterestingly, we find that there is no single low-redshift reference ample that can perfectly explain the properties of all three z > .5 galaxies (when selecting only those that exhibit [O III ] \u03bb4363). ithin error bars, S06355 at z = 7.67 (lime green star) is qualitaively consistent with Green Peas, Blueberries, and the edge of the istribution of SDSS galaxies.

We sho w belo w that such emission line atios can also be driven by strong shocks, so this galaxy is not onclusively an AGN, nor has a signature of higher excitation energy mission lines such as He II \u03bb4686.\nSimilar to S06355, S04590 at z = 8.5 (magenta star) shows very igh O32, RO3, and [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/[O III ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729. This galaxy esides at the very edges of the distributions of Blueberries and xtremely low-metallicity galaxies. The dust-corrected RO3 value f S04590, at 0.059, is among the highest currently known in the ocal Universe. Unlike S06355, S04590 is characterized by very igh Balmer emission compared to the emission from metal lines, ith [O III ] \u03bb5007/H \u03b2 lying below the typical values in SDSS. urthermore, both [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/H \u03b4 and [O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729/H \u03b4 re low compared to the typical SDSS galaxy, as can be seen in the ottom right-hand panel of Fig. 2 . To quantify the similarity between these three high-redshift galaxes and each low-redshift reference population, we train an Isolation orest (Liu, Ting & Zhou 2008 ) on the three emission line ratios of 32, RO3, and [O III ] \u03bb5007/H \u03b2.

In contrast, S04590 at z = 8.50 is most similar to the xtremely low metallicity galaxies of Izotov et al. ( 2019 ) and sits at he very edge of the distribution of Blueberries. This quantitatively emonstrates that these three high-redshift galaxies, despite lying at imilar redshifts, are diverse in nature, and multiple different lowedshift analogue samples are needed to realistically encapsulate heir properties (cf. Schaerer et al. 2022 ; Rhoads et al. 2022 ). Since all three galaxies have high O32 and RO3 compared to DSS galaxies, the ISM in these high-redshift systems likely have igh ionization parameters, lower metallicities, and/or higher H II egion electron temperatures and densities compared to that in the ocal Universe (see also Trump et al. 2022 ). Ho we ver, with this initial nalysis, using the dust-corrected values, tw o k ey features stand out: he very high RO3 in S04590 and the very high [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/H \u03b4 and 32 in S10612. The latter can likely be explained by a high ionization arameter and low metallicity; however, the former requires more nvestigation, which we discuss further below. CURIOUSLY H I G H [O I I I ] \u03bb4363 / [O I I I ] \u03bb5007 A TIO A T REDSHIFT 8 . 5 ualitatively, the spectral feature that is immediately interesting is he strength of the [O III ] \u03bb4363 line with respect to [O III ] \u03bb5007 in 04590 at z = 8.5. For galaxies in SDSS with measured [O III ] \u03bb4363, e find log 10 (RO3) = \u22121.91 \u00b1 0.3 (i.e. 0.012). The value is larger\nor low-metallicity galaxies ( \u22121.41 or 0.039; Izotov et al. 2019 ), o we ver, S04590 has a log 10 (RO3) of \u22121.32 ( \u22121.26 when corrected or dust), which is a 2 \u03c3 outlier compared to the SDSS population ith detected [O III ] \u03bb4363. Fig. 3 shows contours of constant RO3 as a function of electron emperature and density, demonstrating the physical conditions reuired to give rise to this high RO3 value. High RO3 values can either e driven by high electron temperatures ( T e ) or high electron densities n e ). The change in level populations with temperature drives the ehaviour of the ratio with temperature, while the dependence on ensity is caused by the fact that the critical density of the \u03bb5007\nine is lower than that of the \u03bb4363 line (e.g. Osterbrock & Ferland 006 ). In order to obtain the dust-corrected value of RO3 ( \u223c0.055) as s seen in S04590, one either requires temperatures \u223c3 \u00d7 10 4 K, r densities > 10 4 cm \u22123 . Such a temperature is higher than what is ypically seen in galactic H II re gions (e.g. Deharv eng et al. 2000 ) here T e \u223c 7000\u201314000 K and n e \u223c 100 cm \u22123 (Osterbrock & erland 2006 ), and those computed from photoionization models for ypical stellar spectral energy distribution (SED) choices (e.g. Xiao, tanway & Eldridge 2018 ), while such electron densities are an order f magnitude greater than those seen in star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 2, here H II region densities can be directly inferred (e.g. Sanders et al. 016 ). To demonstrate this further, in the top row of Fig. 4 , we show he results of a set of CLOUDY models (Ferland et al. 2017 ) where e have varied the stellar age, ionization parameter, and metallicity f the gas and stellar population that is illuminating the cloud (see ppendix A for details on the models). Only the models with the owest metallicities (10 \u22122 Z ) and the highest ionization parameters 10 \u22121.5 ) begin to approach the values of RO3 and O32 seen in 04590; ho we ver, these models cannot simultaneously reproduce the trength of [O III ] \u03bb5007/H \u03b2 due to the low metallicity. Hence, under elatively standard assumptions (see Appendix B for an extended set f models) on H II region properties, it is difficult to reconcile what s driving the emission line ratios observed in S04590.\nBefore investigating the physical conditions required to drive uch a high RO3, we reiterate the fact that JWST /NIRSpec is a ew instrument and the observations underpinning this work are mong the first taken at such high redshifts. We note that in an ndependent analysis of these spectra, Curti et al. ( 2022 ) reported a lightly lower value of RO3 = 0.045 \u00b1 0.007 for S04590 (before dust orrection). While this value is lower than what we find here (0.048), e emphasize that the models described abo v e are still unable to imultaneously reproduce those RO3 and O32 ratios reported in urti et al. ( 2022 ). If further observations continue to find such high O3 ratios in high-redshift galaxies, there must be some additional hysics beyond star formation that is responsible. We consider four ossible solutions below:\n(i) The presence of an AGN (ii) Strong shocks (iii) X-ray heating (iv) Cosmic ray heating\n.1 The presence of an AGN?\nhe observation of high RO3 is reminiscent of the temperature roblem in low-redshift Seyfert galaxies (e.g. Koski & Osterbrock 976 ; Osterbrock 1978 ; Ferland & Netzer 1983 ; Dopita & Sutherland 995 ; Nagao, Murayama & Taniguchi 2001 ; Baskin & Laor 2005 ; inette et al. 2022 ). The narrow line region (NLR) around an AGN an reach the densities and temperatures that are perhaps required o explain the high RO3 in S04590 (e.g. as was shown in the hotoionization models of Baskin & Laor 2005 ). The line widths f S04590 in the spectrum remain spectrally unresolved at R \u223c 000, resulting in an upper limit of < 250 km s \u22121 , placing them on he low-end of what one might expect for an NLR. Nevertheless, we rst consider an AGN as a potential solution for the high RO3 ratio. Not only is S04590 inconsistent with SDSS QSOs and lowedshift Seyfert 2 nuclei on all diagnostics considered, it falls well elow the AGN-galaxy demarcation proposed by (P \u0301erez-Montero t al. 2007 ) on the [O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729/H \u03b4 versus [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/H \u03b4 iagnostic.

Furthermore high excitation lines such as He II lines, 5 or ny of the higher ionization state Fe lines (these are likely too weak o be detected) are absent from the spectrum, making it hard to onclusively determine whether this galaxy hosts an AGN. However, one of the av ailable e vidence suggests that it does host an AGN. or these reasons, we consider alternative solutions to explain the pectrum of this object.\n.2 Strong shocks\nast, radiativ e shocks can also increase the temperature of the gas ell abo v e 10 4 K (Allen et al. 2008 ; Dopita & Sutherland 2017 ), otentially in the regime needed to explain the high RO3 in S04590. o determine whether such shocks can plausibly reproduce the mission line ratios we see at z > 7.5, we compare line ratios from the APPINGS models of Allen et al. ( 2008 ) to the three high-redshift alaxies in Fig. C1 across the four diagnostics presented abo v e. As before, we find that S04590 remains a clear outlier even when ompared with these shock models. Therefore, we conclude that hocks alone are unlikely to explain the emission line ratios seen n this particular galaxy. We highlight that shocks can explain the Ne III ] \u03bb3869/H \u03b4 and [O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729/H \u03b4 ratios seen in S10612, uggesting that, although this galaxy lies abo v e the P \u0301erez-Montero t al. ( 2007 ) AGN demarcation line in this diagnostic plot (lower ight-hand panel of Fig. 2 ), the line ratios can be explained without nvoking the presence of an AGN.\n.3 X-ray binaries\nigh-energy photons from X-ray sources (including high-mass Xay binaries or HMXBs) can potentially provide additional heating n the ISM (e.g. Lebouteiller et al. 2017 ; Lehmer et al. 2022 ), bo v e what one would expect from photoionization due to stars lone. Observational data has shown that the X-ray luminosity per nit star formation rate increases significantly at low metallicities e.g. Mapelli et al. 2010 ; Basu-Zych et al. 2013 ; Saxena et al. 021 ). Furthermore, HMXBs have been postulated as an important ngredient to explain He II emission in low-metallicity star-forming alaxies (e.g. Schaerer, Fragos & Izotov 2019 ; Senchyna et al. 2020 ; axena et al. 2020 ; Umeda et al. 2022 ). Since faint galaxies at > 6 are predicted to have low metallicities, HMXBs could be n important source of heating that is often missing from typical II region photoionization or shock models. S04590 is predicted to ave a much lower metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 6.99 \u00b1 0.11) than 06355 and S10612 (12 + log(O/H) = 8.24 \u00b1 0.07, and 7.73 \u00b1 0.12, espectively; Curti et al. 2022 ), which means that HMXBs are likely o have a larger impact on S04590 compared to the other two galaxies.\nTo assess the impact of HMXBs, we have expanded our CLOUDY odel grid, varying the ratio of X-ray luminosity 6 to star formation ate ( L X /SFR) in the range 10 38 \u201310 42 erg s \u22121 /M yr \u22121 , where obserational constraints out to z \u223c 5 currently exist (Saxena et al. 2021 ). etails of these models are presented in Appendix A . In the middle ow of Fig. 4 we show three strong-line diagnostics along with a ubset 7 of the results from our CLOUDY models.\nThe models with weak X-ray luminosities are nearly identical (on he diagnostics that we consider) to the runs with only stars. Once\nThe optical He II \u03bb4686 line falls in a band gap. L X is defined as the X-ray luminosity in the range 2\u201310 keV. We show a subset rather than the full grid for visual clarity.\ne\n8\nw\nhe X-ray luminosity is increased, the diagnostics fan away from the hotoionization models that only include stars to high RO3 due to he additional heating from X-rays. As before, the models with lower\netallicity tend to result in higher RO3 values due to the fact that ooling becomes less efficient with decreasing metallicity. Across all hree diagnostics, the CLOUDY models with HMXBs can provide a easonable explanation for the observed emission line ratios if high X /SFR > 10 41 erg s \u22121 /M yr \u22121 is assumed. There remains some iscrepancy in [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/[O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729, but we highlight ow all three diagnostics and in particular, [O III ] \u03bb5007/H \u03b2, are ignificantly better at reproducing the observations compared to odels with stars only. In summary, the inclusion of HMXBs with igh L X /SFR as predicted by e xtrapolating observ ed trends found z \u223c \u20135 (Saxena et al. 2021 ) combined with low metallicity can plausibly eproduce the emission line ratios seen in S04590. Further tuning f the photoionization models (e.g. higher ionization parameters, hanging the mass of the HMXB, non-solar abundance ratios) may mpro v e the agreement. Ho we ver, although physically moti v ated, e emphasize that this solution may not be unique because there are ther heating mechanisms that can increase ISM temperature.\n.4 High cosmic ray densities\nerland & Mushotzky ( 1984 ) considered cosmic rays as an additional eating mechanism to explain the observed RO3 ratios in low-redshift GN. Assuming a simple model where galaxy volume scales with he size of the Universe (as (1 + z) \u22123 ), 8 it is plausible that the cosmic ay densities for high-redshift galaxies with similar star formation ates as the Milky Way may be \u223c1000 times higher than what is nferred from the galactic neighbourhood. The cosmic ray density hould further scale with star formation rate if the cosmic rays are ourced by supernova explosions. Papadopoulos et al. ( 2011 ) showed hat in cosmic ray-dominated regions where the cosmic ray density s 10 3 \u201310 4 times higher than the local neighbourhood, temperatures an easily rise to 5\u201310 \u00d7 10 4 K, which could help explain the high emperature needed to reproduce the observed RO3 in S04590. Such cenarios are predicted to operate in local ultraluminous infrared alaxies or high-redshift submillimeter galaxies. With the additional ressure and temperature, the stellar initial mass function is likely oosted in cosmic ray-dominated regions due to the increased Jeans ass, which aligns with certain predictions of a more top-heavy nitial mass function at high-redshift (e.g. Katz et al. 2022b ). To assess the impact of cosmic rays, we have further extended our LOUDY grid by systematically increasing the strength of the cosmic ay background. The bottom row of Fig. 4 shows the results of these LOUDY models compared to the three z > 7.5 JWST galaxies. Here e can see fundamentally different behaviour compared to the other wo grids. As the cosmic ray background is increased, RO3 increases ue to the additional heating from the cosmic rays. Ho we ver, initially 32, [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/[O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729, and [O III ]/H \u03b2 drop as well ue to the increased temperature in the outer regions of the gas cloud llowing for more [O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729 and H \u03b2 emission. The models ith 10 \u22122 Z , U = 10 \u22121.5 , and a cosmic ray background intensity that s 100 \u00d7 greater than that of the Milky Way can plausibly explain oth the O32, RO3, and [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/[O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729, but in his model, such low metallicity combined with the additional H \u03b2 mission means that [O III ]/H \u03b2 is systematically underpredicted.\nMNRAS 518, 592\u2013603 (2023)\nMultiple observational studies have shown that galaxy size scales strongly ith redshift (e.g. Shibuya, Ouchi & Harikane 2015 ; Allen et al. 2017 ).\n600 H.

For each choice of ionization parameter nd metallicity, there is a particular cosmic ray background intensity here the cloud switches from being ionization bounded to being ensity bounded. In this regime, O32 increases (see e.g. Nakajima & uchi 2014 ) as the O II region in the nebula is destroyed. For the same eason, [Ne III ] \u03bb3869/[O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729 also increases. Finally, t sufficiently hot temperatures, [O III ]/H \u03b2 also increases because he recombination emissivity for H \u03b2 drops with temperature. If he cosmic ray background is very fine-tuned, the models that are ight at the edge of the density and ionization bounded regimes can onspire to reproduce all of the flux ratios shown in Fig. 4 . Due to he fine tuning required, this is not our preferred solution, although e highlight that in this unique regime, cosmic rays will be the ominant driver of Lyman continuum leakage. To our knowledge, a osmic ray-dominated ISM has not been considered as a mechanism or causing ionizing photons to leak from galaxies.\nMore generally, if we increase the ionization parameter to U = 0 \u22120.5 , we can fit all the emission line ratios of S04590 shown in ig. 4 . This solution still requires a cosmic ray background intensity hat is more than 100 \u00d7 that of the Milky Way; ho we ver, such a strong ackground is not unrealistic due to the small sizes and bursty nature f high-redshift galaxies as predicted by numerical simulations (e.g. osdahl et al. 2018 ).\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne have presented an analysis on the spectra of the first three z 7.5 galaxies observed with the JWST /NIRSpec Micro-Shutter ssembly in the SMACS0723 field, realased as part of the Early elease Observations public data release. We have compared emission line ratios from these high-redshift\nalaxies to various low-redshift galaxy (SDSS), QSO (SDSS), and otential high-redshift analogue (Amor \u0301\u0131n et al. 2015 ; Yang et al. 017a , b ; Izotov et al. 2019 ) populations. We find that the properties f the high-redshift galaxies are diverse and not a single analogue opulation well represents the flux ratios of all three systems across arious diagnostics. Ne vertheless, studying only oxygen and Balmer ines, the two galaxies (S06355 and S10612) at z \u223c 7.6 are consistent ith the low-redshift analogues, while S04590 at z = 8.5 seems to eside at the very edge of the low-redshift analogue distribution. S04590 is characterized by an extremely high O III ] \u03bb4363/[O III ] \u03bb5007 ratio, which is at the upper limit f what is seen in very low metallicity galaxies in the local Universe Izotov et al. 2019 ). We consider the possibility that additional hysics beyond low-metallicity star formation is required to explain he nature of this source.\nWe show that neither AGN nor shock models can simultaneously eproduce the flux ratios observed in S04590. Ho we ver, if we assume hat high-mass X-ray binaries or cosmic rays contribute significantly o the heating of the ISM, we can reasonably reproduce many of the roperties of S04590. In such a scenario, either the L X /SFR is very igh and consistent with extrapolated predictions from z = 3\u20135 (e.g. axena et al. 2021 ), or the cosmic ray background intensity is orders f magnitude greater than what is observed in the Milky Way, in ine with expectations of decreasing galaxy size at high-redshift or enerally more concentrated star formation. Our explanations of the observed flux ratios using cosmic rays r HMXBs are unlikely to be unique. In principle, any mechanism hat can enhance the ionizing photon count and/or drive additional eating could potentially enhance RO3.\nNRAS 518, 592\u2013603 (2023)\nDue to the early nature of these observations, we remain cauious about o v er-interpreting the spectra, particularly the high RO3. evertheless, based on the available evidence, this work fa v ours dditional heating in the ISM, beyond photoheating from stars and hotoelectric heating from dust grains to explain the high RO3. osmic rays or HMXBs could provide viable explanations for the igh RO3 measured in S04590, indicating that we may need to revise ur models of the ISM in the early Universe and how photons leak alaxies and contribute to reionization. JWST /NIRSpec observations f larger samples of z 8 galaxies will quantify whether or not these dditional heating mechanisms are important in the high-redshift SM.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the referee for their detailed comments that impro v ed he manuscript.

In our fiducial set of models the inner radius of the lab is fixed to 10 30 cm for a plane-parallel model and the ionization arameter is varied between 10 \u22123.5 and 10 \u22121.5 . The shape of the stellar ED is adopted from BPASSv2.0 (Stanway, Eldridge & Becker 2016 ; ldridge & Stanway 2016 ). We assume an instantaneous burst and ary the age of the stellar population between 10 6 and 10 8 yr. We vary he metallicity of the gas and stellar population between 10 \u22122 Z and Z . Metal abundances ratios are assumed to follow Asplund et al. 2009 ). Dust grains are included using the GRAINS ISM command nd the dust-to-gas-mass ratio is assumed to scale with metallicity. or all models, we account for metal depletion on to dust grains. urthermore, we have turned off molecules. To account for X-ray binaries, in addition to the stellar SED and\nMB, we have added a modified blackbody spectrum (Mitsuda t al. 1984 ) that we assume captures the SED of XRBs. We fix he black hole mass to 25 M . Following Senchyna et al. ( 2020 ), we ssume the disk has a maximum radius of 10 4 cm and compute the pectra using ARES, which is then combined with the stellar SED Mirocha et al. 2012 ). Following observational constraints at high edshift (Saxena et al. 2021 ), we vary L X /SFR in the range 10 38 \u2212 0 42 erg s \u22121 /M yr \u22121 , where L X is the X-ray luminosity in the range \u201310 keV. To assess the impact of cosmic rays, we have expanded our LOUDY grid by removing the HMXB SED and replacing it with a osmic ray background (using the COSMIC RAYS BA CKGR OUND ommand). We vary the cosmic ray background intensities from to 10 4.8 times the mean background strength of the Milky Way. 9 or the cosmic ray runs, we also explore ionization parameters up to 0 \u22120.5 at a metallicity of 10 \u22121 Z . For all models, the calculation is stopped when the temperature eaches 4 000 K or when the outer radius of 1 kpc is reached. Note hat these models are not designed to reproduce any particular galaxy opulation. Our goal is to qualitatively assess how HMXBs or cosmic ays may impact the rele v ant emission line ratios.\nPPENDI X B: BPASS M O D E L S WI TH H I G H E R ENSITY A N D I O N I Z AT I O N PA R A M E T E R\nn Fig. B1 , we show CLOUDY model grids assuming a BPASSv2.0 ED a single burst with an age of 5 Myr extending up to densities of 0 5 cm \u22123 and ionization parameters up to 10 \u22120.5 .
