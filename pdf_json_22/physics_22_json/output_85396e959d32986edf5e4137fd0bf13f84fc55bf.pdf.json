    "abstractText": "In recent years, the use of magnetic particles for biomedicine and clinical therapies has gained considerable attention. Unique features of magnetic particles have made it possible to apply them in medical techniques. These techniques not only provide minimal invasive diagnostic tools but also transport medicine within the cell. In recent years, MRI, drug supply to infected tissue, Hyperthermia are more enhanced by the use of magnetic particles. The present study aims to observe heat and mass transport through blood flow containing magnetic particles in a cylindrical tube. Furthermore, the magnetic field is applied vertically to blood flow direction. The Caputo time fractional derivative is used to model the problem. The obtained partial fractional derivatives are solved using Laplace transform and finite Hankel transform. Furthermore, the effect of various physical parameters of our interest has also been observed through various graphs. It has been noticed that the motion of blood and magnetic particles is decelerated when the particle mass parameter and the magnetic parameter are increased. These findings are important for medicine delivery and blood pressure regulation.",

Unique features of magnetic particles have made it possible to apply them in medical techniques. These techniques not only provide minimal invasive diagnostic tools but also transport medicine within the cell. In recent years, MRI, drug supply to infected tissue, Hyperthermia are more enhanced by the use of magnetic particles. The present study aims to observe heat and mass transport through blood flow containing magnetic particles in a cylindrical tube. Furthermore, the magnetic field is applied vertically to blood flow direction. The Caputo time fractional derivative is used to model the problem. The obtained partial fractional derivatives are solved using Laplace transform and finite Hankel transform. Furthermore, the effect of various physical parameters of our interest has also been observed through various graphs. It has been noticed that the motion of blood and magnetic particles is decelerated when the particle mass parameter and the magnetic parameter are increased. These findings are important for medicine delivery and blood pressure regulation."

Such fluids are classified as non-Newtonian fluids1. Brinkman-type fluid is one of the types of non-Newtonian fluids. Brinkman type fluid is a kind of fluid that passes through a high permeable area2. Brinkman developed a model for fluid flow in the porous medium. It has enormous applications in science and engineering e.g. geohydrology, petroleum engineering, scientific study of soil, and manufacturing the products involving chemical processes3. In addition, Brinkman type fluid has massive applications in the medical field, e.g. Oxygen exchange in the blood through millions of alveoli in the lungs in capillaries, the procedure of blood dialysis in the artificial kidney, flow in blood oxygenation4. Ali et\u00a0al.5 for the first time used Laplace transform technique to get the exact solution for the Brinkman type fluid model. The influence of radiative heat flux on Brinkman type fluid with the applied magnetic field is investigated Zakaria6. Blood flow in a cylindrical tube was examined by Saqib et\u00a0al.7. In this study, blood is used as a Brinkman type fluid in this investigation. Magnetic particles are also injected into the bloodstream to investigate the effects of a perpendicularly applied magnetic field on blood and particle velocity. They found that raising values of the Brinkman parameter reduced the blood velocity. Ali et\u00a0al.8examined the influence of thermal radiation on the natural convection flow of Brinkman type fluid by the use of an applied magnetic field.\nMagnetic particles are metallic particles that are influenced by the magnetic field8. Magnetic particles has also the property of escalation of the thermal conductivity of working fluids when exposed to external magnetic field9. This property of magnetic particles makes it a good choice for researchers to use in the biomedical field10. Almost five decades ago magnetic particles were first time used for cancer treatment11. One of the characteristics of magnetic particles is their attraction to high magnetic flux density, which helps in drug targeting and biosepration12. Magnetic particles have the property of Hysteresis loss to the alternative magnetic field. This property is helpful in Hyperthermia13. Since the magnetic field is generated by magnetic particles that affects the surrounding local region. This property is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)14. Other common uses of magnetic particles are gene transfer15, immunoassays16.\nKeeping in mind the applications of magnetic particles in the biomedical field, various researchers are interested to discuss blood mixed with magnetic particles in different geometries under the application of magnetic field. Ali et\u00a0al.17 briefly examined the role of magnetic particles for therapeutic purposes. Their model is based on blood flow with suspended magnetic particles and a magnetic field applied perpendicularly. Moreover, It is noticed that the motion of particles and blood can be regulated by using adequate use of magnetic field intensity. Furlani et\u00a0al.18 used magnetic particles in the blood and formulated a mathematical model to introduce noninvasive magnetic targeting therapy. The results showed that this model is effective when the tumor is within few centimeters of the surface of the body. Grief et\u00a0al.19 examined the effects of a perpendicularly applied magnetic field on blood flow with suspended magnetic particles. They noticed that by using magnetic particles, tumor treatment can be made more effective. In order to find an effective way to deliver localized genes effectively, Kilgus20 developed a model. It was noticed that the use of magnetic particles makes this process more effective. The model developed by Shit and Roy21 using magnetic particles in blood flow is helpful for the therapy of atherosclerosis and hypertension. Their investigation shows that the use of an external magnetic field is helpful to control blood flow. Mirza et\u00a0al.22 explored the role of magnetic field for treatment of stenosed artery. They observed magnetized blood flow with suspended magnetic particles. During their investigation, strong variation in blood near the stenosed artery was observed.\nMagnetic particles work as a heat source, scientists used this property to cure cancerous cells23. Choi and Eastman24 in their research work proved that adding a certain amount of metallic particles in fluid enhances the rate of heat transfer. This property of magnetic particles has attracted many researchers to conduct further studies. The effects of heat transfer on blood with suspended magnetic particles in a small capillary were observed by Ali et\u00a0al.25. Khalid26 examined the influence of natural convection on flowing blood with suspended nanotubes and noticed that transfer of heat enhanced by the increase of carbon nanotube\u2019s volume fraction. Shah et\u00a0al.27\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:418 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-04088-9\nanalytically observed free convective blood flow. The effect of heat transmission on free convective fluid was investigated by Alsabery et\u00a0al.28 in horizontal concentric annuls. Blood also plays a significant role in mass transfer to surrounding tissues. Researchers have also noticed experimentally that the existence of magnetic particles in blood improves mass transfer29. Tripathi et\u00a0al.30 examined the behavior of two phase blood flow in a stenosed artery with combined effects of heat and mass transfer with an applied magnetic field.\nFractional calculus is almost three centuries old and is one of the exciting researches of applied analysis of sciences for modeling biological problems31. Fractional calculus shows hereditary and memory effects which are not possible by ordinary calculus32. To model any physical/biological problem, fractional calculus is more realistic than ordinary calculus. In recent years, many researchers have used fractional order calculus to model many biological problems. In order to observe the dynamic behavior of TB infection Rahman et\u00a0al.33 developed a time fractional model. Their examination pointed how to diminish the contamination in human benig. They this investigation probed that fractional order derivative significantly analysis the model rather than classical derivative. Bansi et\u00a0al.34 investigated blood flow in an artery using a fractional model. It was observed that fractional parameter is helpful to control temperature and motion of blood flow. Tabi et\u00a0al.35 used time fractional model to describe the variation in motion of blood with embedded particles in a stenosed artery with an applied magnetic field. Their investigation showed that fractional parameter is more realistic to show the behavior of blood and particles. To investigate the frequency dependence of brain tissue, Kohandel et\u00a0al.36 employed fractional calculus. By using fractional calculus, Ahmed et\u00a0al.37 proposed a cancer model. This model showed that fractional order calculus is more effective to describe tumor immune system. To study the dynamics of tumor cells, Arfan et\u00a0al.38 presented a time fractional model. The findings can be used to look into the dynamics of tumor cells, immune cells, and therapeutic reactions.\nKeeping in mind all the above mentioned literature, a time fractional model has been established. The goal is to explore the impact of heat and mass transfer on blood with uniformly distributed magnetic particles flowing through a cylindrical tube. Moreover, blood flow is exposed to magnetic field. The Hankel and Laplace transformation are utilized to get the exact solution. The impacts of the various parameters are briefly described in several graphs."

            "text": "The exact solutions for the generalized blood flow mixed with magnetic particle with joint effect of heat and mass transport are derived in this study. Various graphs are sketched to examine the flow behavior by taking fixed value for \u03c9t = 5\u03c08 ,A0 = 0.5,Gr = 3.2\u00d7 102,A1 = 0.5, 39. Figures\u00a02, 3, 4, 5 indicates the impacts of a non-integer order parameter \u03b1 on temperature, concentration, and velocity field. Figure\u00a02 illustrates the variation in fluid temperature for various values of \u03b1. Distinct curves for temperature field are obtained at a fixed time which is termed as the memory effect. This behavior cannot be obtained using classical derivatives. The obtained curves will help the experimentalists to best fit the curve with the curve drawn from the experimental data. Moreover, when the body temperature is normal i.e. at 310K0, D = 1.6\u00d7 10\u22124mm2s\u22121, k = 0.52 Jm\u22121 sec\u22121 K\u22121, \u03c1 = 1050Kg/m3, \u00b5 = 3.2548\u00d7 10\u22123Kg m\u22121. sec\u22121 cp = 3617JKg\u22121K\u22121, For fixed value of Pr = 22.6430, despite of getting curves due to \u03b1, a significant change in the behavior of temperature gradient is also noticed with the variation of time. The influence of \u03b1 on concentration profile is illustrated through Fig.\u00a03a, b by taking Sc = 1.9\u00d7 10453. In the graph time is also varied along \u03b1. It is worth noting to observe that the behavior of fractional parameter is quite opposite for larger time (\u03c4 > 1) as compared to smaller time (\u03c4 < 1). It is expected that for (\u03c4 = 1) , the different integral curves will overlap each other. Further more, Fig.\u00a03a, b shows various integral curves(solutions), which cannot be described by the non fractional model. These different solutions may provide space for the experimentalists to best fit their real data with one of these curves. Figures\u00a04 and 5 are sketched for \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03b1 = 1, to investigate the effects on fluid and particle velocity. Effect of time variation is also taken into account. Different curves obtained for fractional model solution and experimentalists can find the curve which reasonably good fits to the given data. It is also noticed that for \u03c4 > 1 , increased values of memory parameter, both the fluid and particles velocity increased and decreased for \u03c4 < 1 . Figure\u00a06 highlights the impact of magnetic parameter on both velocity profiles. It has been noticed that increased values of a magnetic parameter causes a significant decrease in fluid\u2019s velocity. The graph clearly demonstrates that blood and particle velocity reaches its peak in the center and then steadily falls. This is because an increase in the magnetic parameter escalates the resistive forces that dominate fluid motion, decelerating the fluid and particle velocity.

It is important to have a suitable external magnetic field in order to drive magnetic particles to the tumor site. Figure\u00a07 marks the change in the blood and particle motion by variation in the Brinkman type fluid parameter \u03b2 . As can be seen in the diagram, fluid and particle motion reduces as a result of an increase in \u03b2 . Physically, this is correct because the fluid\u2019s drag forces dominate and the fluid velocity falls7. It is obvious from the obtained result that, the adequate use of magnetic field intensity can be helpful in order to regulate the blood flow in medical field. Figures\u00a08 and 9 are sketched to analyze the influence of particle mass parameter and particle concentration parameter on the blood and particle velocity. Same decreasing trend for velocities is noticed when the values of Pm and Pc are raised. The physics behind this is when particle concentration is increased the collisions of the particles also increases, due to this behavior they are dispersed from streamlines. As a result deviation from dynamic equilibrium state induces a relative velocity between the particles and the blood that generates additional energy dissipation and consequently it results in an effective viscosity54, consequently, fluid grows denser and thicker, slowing the flow. The variation in the values of Pm, has also resulted the same behavior as observed for Pc. During their research, Saqib et\u00a0al.9 and Nandkeolyar and Das55 also reported this tendency .This result shows that by adjusting the values of the Pm and Pc, successful drug delivery to the tumor cite can be made possible. The influence of the Gm on blood and particle motion is seen in Fig.\u00a010 the obtained graph shows that both the velocities of blood and magnetic particles reduce due to an increase in mass Grashoff number.\nFigure\u00a05.
