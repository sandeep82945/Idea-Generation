    "abstractText": "This study investigated the relationships among Japanese nursing professionals\u2019 percetions of the importance of smoking cessation support (SCS), attitude toward SCS, SCS self-efficacy, and SCS behaviors. An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was administered to 613 nursing professionals (valid response rate: 89.9%) who participated in SCS workshops in Japan between May 2019 and February 2020. The survey measured factors such as SCS behaviors (the 5 As) and attitude toward SCS. Participants responded that they \u201calways\u201d or \u201cusually\u201d performed the 5 As at the following rates: Ask, 65.6%; Advise, 46.7%; Assess, 34.4%; Assist, 19.7%; and Arrange, 20.9%. Significant differences in implementation rates between \u201cnon-engagers\u201d and \u201cengagers\u201d were found for all steps except Ask. Those who engaged daily in SCS had significantly higher scores for SCS behaviors and SCS perceived importance, attitude, and self-efficacy than those who did not. Structural equation modeling yielded a model with 61% explanatory power, which demonstrated that beliefs about and perceived importance of SCS had a greater impact on SCS behaviors than self-efficacy. Promotion of SCS behaviors among nursing professionals in Japan requires the beliefs about and recognition of the importance of SCS to be improved. The importance of engaging in SCS daily is",

            "text": "Smoking is a major contributor to death from non-communicable chronic diseases; addressing this problem is an important part of the public health agenda [1]. Smoking cessation has been proven to reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease [2], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [3], and cancer [4]. Nurses make up the largest proportion of health care workers [5], and they are in a position to support smoking cessation, not only in medical institutions, but also in various health and welfare settings in the community [6]. Nurses are considered to be more effective as the first line of cessation support because they spend the most time with patients [7]. The International Council of Nurses, in collaboration with other national organizations, also encourages member organizations to make efforts to bring government and public attention to the harmful effects of tobacco on health and to encourage governments to reduce, curb, and eliminate tobacco use, including providing access to smoking cessation programs [8]. Regarding the effectiveness of nursing interventions for smoking cessation support (SCS), the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality Clinical Practice Guideline (AHRQ) reports that smoking cessation advice from nurses may increase smoking cessation rates [9]. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration reported that advice and support from\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2304. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042304 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nnurses may increase the success rate of SCS, both in hospital and community settings [10]. Overall, nursing SCS plays an important role in helping patients to successfully quit smoking. However, nurses\u2019 SCS have not always produced satisfactory results [11\u201313]. Self-efficacy and willpower have been associated as facilitators for nurses\u2019 SCS; Devries et al. [14] found that it is the intention to act that is directly related to behavior, and that intention is influenced by self-efficacy for the behavior, attitudes toward the behavior, and subjective norms. Based on this theoretical background, Bolman et al. [15] concluded that the factors that lead to SCS among nurses are the need to increase their attitude and self-efficacy toward smoking cessation support. These elements have also been found to influence medical nurses\u2019 compliance with SCS guidelines [16]. A review by Thornberry et al. identified factors that promote SCS by occupational health nurses; it found that the factors that contributed to the implementation of SCS among nurses were attitude, innovativeness, perceived social impact, and self-efficacy [17]. It is also important to have an attitude that strongly encourages nurses to quit smoking. Attitudes toward smoking cessation were shown to be positively correlated with the components of smoking cessation counselling, termed the 5 As. This result indicates the need to encourage and provide opportunities for nurses to receive training on SCS [11]. A previous cohort study in Japan reported the importance of counseling by nurses in maintaining patients\u2019 self-efficacy to quit smoking and helping them achieve smoking cessation [18]. A study by Li et al. has revealed the interrelationship of these factors, in the context of SCS interventions, by public health nurses for pregnant women about to give birth [19]. This study was conducted in a cohort of only public health nurses. However, to date, no study has examined the extent to which psychological factors (such as self-efficacy and attitudes towards SCS) relate to improving motivation for SCS among various types of nurses in Japan and to what extent they are structurally related. The purpose of this study is to structurally examine the relationship between the perceptions of importance, attitudes, and self-efficacy toward SCS and SCS from Japanese nursing professionals in all settings. This will be useful in examining factors that may further promote SCS provided by nursing professionals. The research questions for this study are as follows (within the nursing profession in Japan):\n(1) To ascertain whether self-efficacy for SCS, and perceptions and attitudes of the importance of SCS influence the implementation of SCS. (2) To structurally clarify whether self-efficacy for SCS, or perceptions and attitudes of the importance of SCS have a stronger influence on the implementation of SCS."

Six items found to have a factor loading of 0.3 or below in factor analysis were excluded from the modeling process: 9. Value of SCS counseling; 10. Importance of smoking cessation for (their own) patients or clients; 11. Perceived importance of SCS at their organization; 14. (Asking patients or clients about smoking) increases the chance of smoking cessation; 19. Smoking cessation counseling is time-consuming; and years as a nursing professional. The validity of the conceptual models was compared using goodness of fit indices. Model 1 (all participants), in which each of the four latent factors except the first one had an effect on the first factor [SCS behavior], showed solution convergence, but with an inadequate goodness of fit (CFI = 0.962, AGFI = 0.933, RMSEA = 0.055). Moreover, the multiple correlation coefficient (hereafter, R2) for [SCS behaviors] was 0.46. Model 2 (all participants) (Figure 1), which consolidated [importance of SCS] and [beliefs about SCS] into [SCS importance and beliefs], showed satisfactory goodness of fit (CFI = 0.962, AGFI = 0.933, RMSEA = 0.054). Further, the R2 (0.61) for [SCS behaviors] was higher in Model 2 than in Model 1. Thus, Model 2 was adopted. The results of multigroup structural equation modeling of Model 2 for engagers and non-engagers are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The model\u2019s goodness of fit indices were as follows: CFI = 0.955, AGFI = 0.908, and RMSEA = 0.039. The R2 values for [SCS behaviors] were 0.55 for non-engagers and 0.48 for engagers. The effect size was 1.96 (strong) for SCS self-efficacy and 0.73 (strong) for SCS importance/belief in non-engagers, and 0.29 (moderate) for SCS self-efficacy and 0.38 (strong) for SCS importance/belief in engagers.\nFor non-engagers, the path coefficient (hereafter, \u03b2) between [SCS self-efficacy] and [SCS behaviors] was 0.39, and \u03b2 between [SCS importance and beliefs] and [SCS behaviors] was 0.58. The covariance between [SCS self-efficacy] and [SCS importance and beliefs] was 0.13 (non-significant difference).

Pairwise comparison of non-engagers and engagers only showed a significant difference in the covariance between [SCS self-efficacy] and [SCS importance and beliefs] (CR = 2.447). Among the observed variables of [SCS behaviors], the items strongly explained by [SCS self-efficacy] and [SCS importance and beliefs] (R2 > 0.5) were \u201cAssist\u201d (R2 = 0.67) and \u201cAssess\u201d (R2 = 0.65)\u201d for non-engagers, and \u201cAssist\u201d (R2 = 0.70), \u201cArrange\u201d (R2 = 0.63), and \u201cAssess\u201d (R2 = 0.58) for engagers."

            "heading": "4. Discussion",
            "text": "Using structural equation modeling, this study quantitatively analyzed the extent to which nursing professionals\u2019 SCS self-efficacy, perceived importance, and beliefs explain their SCS behaviors. One instructive finding was that self-efficacy related to SCS, personal perception of SCS as important, and beliefs about SCS may facilitate nursing professionals\u2019 SCS behaviors. In Model 2, the R2 values for [SCS behaviors] in Figures 1\u20133 show the validity of the model with the said factors. Explanatory strength did not differ between participants who engaged daily with SCS and those who did not, confirming that perceived importance and beliefs about SCS may be greater facilitators of SCS behaviors than self-efficacy. Accordingly, nursing professionals\u2019 performance of SCS behaviors requires not only heightened selfefficacy but also an understanding that smoking cessation is necessary for all patients, that nursing professionals play a major role in the smoking cessation process, and that they\nshould not hesitate to discuss smoking cessation with their patients as doing so improves the patient\u2013nurse relationship. Choi et al. measured the predictors of intention to practice SCS among nurses and their explanatory power [22]. They found that intention to practice SCS consisted of perceived barriers to SCS (0.13), willingness to receive SCS training (0.12), positive attitude toward SCS (0.20), positive support from workplace and colleagues (0.30), and self-efficacy related to SCS (0.15), which explained 45% of the model\u2019s variance. Although these factors resemble the facilitators of SCS intervention in the present study, Choi et al.\u2019s study did not measure actual SCS behaviors. The results of this study are considered novel findings. Li et al. reported that self-efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.52) influences Japanese public health nurses\u2019 SCS behaviors toward pregnant women (R2 = 0.41) [19]. Further, Chatdokmaiprai et al. reported that self-efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.51) impacts occupational health nurses\u2019 SCS behaviors (coefficient of determination 38%) and that nursing professionals\u2019 attitude toward SCS (\u03b2 = 0.37) in turn influences self-efficacy [23]. The present study largely supports these findings. At the same time, Li et al.\u2019s model found that public health nurses\u2019 years of experience positively influenced self-efficacy, but years of nursing experience were not found to be a significant factor in the present study [19]; Chatdokmaiprai et al. similarly found no relationship between self-efficacy and a nursing professional\u2019s age or years of nursing experience [23]. The results of simple descriptive statistical analysis showed that participants who engaged daily with SCS had higher self-confidence in SCS and more positive results for importance and beliefs and were more likely to practice SCS behaviors than participants who did not engage in SCS daily. This confirms that actual experience providing SCS in the course of one\u2019s duties\u2014for example, through outpatient smoking cessation services, health checkups, or preventive education\u2014is an opportunity to master SCS skills and improve beliefs and perceived importance of SCS. These results also support the validity of analyzing the conceptual model for non-engagers and engagers separately. The results of structural equation modeling revealed that SCS self-efficacy and perceived importance of SCS, and beliefs were associated (covariance = 0.50) among participants who regularly engaged in SCS, while no such relationship was found among non-engagers. Thus, \u201cexperience\u201d in one\u2019s everyday duties serves as an opportunity to enhance \u201cskills,\u201d \u201cimportance and beliefs,\u201d and other motivating factors. Guo et al. found that nurses\u2019 attitudes as well as their frequency and practical experience in providing SCS, were significantly associated with psychiatric nurses\u2019 self-efficacy toward SCS, a result that supports the findings of the present study [24]. The results of a simple descriptive statistical analysis of specific SCS behaviors (5A) were shown in Table 1. Except for Ask, engagers were implemented more than nonengagers. Past studies on implementation rates for the 5 As among nurses include a survey of 98 home care nurses (before SCS training) that found rates of 34.0% for Ask, 46.2% for Advise, 13.7% for Assess, 34.0% for Assist, and 0% for Arrange [21]; a study of 152 nurses in the Czech Republic that found rates of 63.0%, 45.8%, 38.9%, 26.0%, and 11.8%, respectively [14]; and a study of 507 nurses in Eastern Europe (before SCS training) reported rates of 70.4%, 65.7%, 58.6%, 36.3%, and 20.4%, respectively [25]. Li et al.\u2019s study of 554 Japanese public health nurses using a 36-item survey on the 5 As found rates of 83.9%, 58.0%, 24.3%, 32.5%, and 43.9%, respectively [19]. These past findings, excluding those for home care nurses, indicate that nursing professionals Ask frequently but tend to have more difficulty with the Assess, Assist, and Arrange steps. The results of the present study are similar to those of previous studies and suggest the particular importance of mastering the Assess, Assist, and Arrange steps if nursing professionals are to provide concrete SCS to their patients. The findings of the present study suggest that Assess, Assist, and Arrange are strongly influenced by SCS self-efficacy, beliefs, and perceived importance. A review by Carson et al. found that training medical professionals to practice SCS improved performance, particularly for Assist and Arrange, resulted in a drop in the prevalence of smoking-related diseases and led to higher cessation rates [26]. The findings of the present study indicate that promoting concrete SCS practices\namong nursing professionals requires that we strive to improve both self-efficacy and perceived importance of and beliefs about SCS. The present study has some limitations. First, the survey did not ask about nursing professionals\u2019 knowledge of SCS. Leung et al. indicated that specialized knowledge of smoking is an important independent predictor of a nurse\u2019s provision of smoking cessation services [27], and studies have shown knowledge of smoking-related issues among Japanese nursing professionals to be quite low [28]. Thus, it is necessary to take into consideration the possibility that knowledge of smoking-related issues influenced the participants\u2019 behavior in the present study. Second, the participants in the present study were nursing professionals who chose to participate in SCS workshops, and the results may therefore differ from the trends for all the nurses in Japan. This study structurally presented the interrelationships among nursing professionals\u2019 SCS self-efficacy, perceived importance, and beliefs explain their SCS behaviors. The results of this study showed that, in order for nurses to contribute to SCS, it is necessary for them to be convinced of the importance of SCS themselves, as well as to have self-efficacy toward SCS. It was also suggested that nurses who come in contact with many patients on a daily basis need to take the opportunity to provide support for smoking cessation on a daily basis. On the other hand, in a review of factors associated with smoking cessation support for nurses, four key concepts were identified as relevant: socioeconomic factors, smokingrelated factors, motivational factors, and enabling factors and barriers [29]; this study was an investigation of some of these factors. In addition, there is a need for smoking cessation support for new tobacco products, such as the rise of heated cigarettes in Japan. The use of heated cigarettes has been publicly surveyed since 2018 in Japan, the 2019 results showed that about one-third of smokers use heated cigarettes [30]. There are studies demonstrating that nurses\u2019 self-efficacy in supporting smoking cessation for new tobacco products is low [31]. In the future, educational interventions to support smoking cessation should be comprehensive, taking into account these social backgrounds. Paying attention not only to the negative aspect of smoking habit, but also to the broader aspect of the patient\u2019s health habits, may be the perspective that nurses need to take in the future in order to promote new behavioral changes with patients [32]."
