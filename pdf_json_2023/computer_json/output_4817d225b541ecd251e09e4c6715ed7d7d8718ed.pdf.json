Calcium is known to be a key regulator and triggers the 33 release of insulin. This sub-cellular process can be monitored and tracked through live-cell 34 imaging and subsequent cell segmentation, registration, tracking, and analysis of the calcium 35 level in each cell. Current methods of analysis typically require the manual outlining of \u03b2-cells, 36 involve multiple software packages, and necessitate multiple researchers - all of which tend to 37 introduce biases. Utilizing deep learning algorithms, we have therefore created a pipeline to 38 automatically segment and track thousands of cells, which greatly reduces the time required to 39 gather and analyze a large number of sub-cellular images and improve accuracy. Tracking cells 40 over a time-series image stack also allows researchers to isolate specific calcium spiking patterns 41 and spatially identify those of interest, creating an efficient and user-friendly analysis tool. Using 42 our automated pipeline, a previous dataset used to evaluate changes in calcium spiking activity in 43 \u03b2-cells post-electric field stimulation was reanalyzed. Changes in spiking activity were found to 44 be underestimated previously with manual segmentation. Moreover, the machine learning 45 pipeline provides a powerful and rapid computational approach to examine, for example, how 46\ncalcium signaling is regulated by intracellular interactions in a cluster of b-cells. 47\n48\nIntroduction 49 The Islets of Langherns are groups of endocrine cells that reside in the pancreas. They 50 contain many cell types that significantly assist in glycemic regulation. The percent composition 51 of cell types remains to be agreed upon, and varying methods have yielded different assessments 52 [1]. Islets are typically comprised of approximately 50-70% \u03b2-cells [2\u20135] and 16-30% \u03b1-cells 53 [2,5,6], with \u03b4-, \u03b3-, and \u03b5-cells encompassing the remaining portion. There is an estimated 3.2 to 54 14.8 million islets in the human body, and they have been a major source of study due to their 55 roles in hormone secretion and subsequent correlation to Diabetes Mellitus [7], which is a 56 disorder that derives from the dysregulation of blood glucose levels. Type I Diabetes, 57 specifically, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the decreased secretion of insulin due to 58 the destruction of \u03b2-cells. Complications from diabetes include micro- and macrovascular 59 disorders such as thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and declines in cognitive function [8]. Two 60\nongoing challenges to the treatment and/or cure of Type I Diabetes involve the reduced 61 population of \u03b2-cells and the autoimmune attack within the body [9]. The main function of \u03b2-62 cells is the production and secretion of insulin. The release of this hormone is triggered by an 63 increase in ATP [10] as the blood becomes oversaturated with glucose. As intense research 64 efforts continue to explore this disease, many of the mechanisms behind insulin secretion are yet 65 to be fully understood. 66 Insulin hormone dynamics is strongly correlated and regulated by calcium signaling. 67 Glucose plays a large role in the stimulus of Ca2+ movement in the mitochondria, endoplasmic 68 reticulum, nucleus, cytosol, and other areas of the cell and increases the level of cytosolic Ca2+ 69 [11]. Additionally, an influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated channels impacts insulin exocytosis 70 and secretion. Insulin secretion patterns are typically studied by following the movement of Ca2+ 71 oscillations (or spikes) in \u03b2-cells [12]. For example, membrane-permeable and high affinity 72 calcium-sensitive fluorophores can be loaded into the cells. Upon binding free Ca2+ ion, 73 fluorescent signals are generated and emitted when excited by an appropriate external light 74 source. This process has been routinely captured in real-time subcellular imaging and allowed 75 the investigator to track intracellular calcium concentration. While the Ca2+ dynamics in 76 individual cells has been monitored and tracked [13], challenges remain to examine the Ca2+ 77 responses in each cell, especially in cluster of cells that are more physiologically representative 78 of islets. There is still much unknown regarding the effects of different stimuli on cell spiking 79 activity, changes due to cell-cell interactions, and how insulin secretion fluctuates based on 80 temporal or spatial variables. Additionally, measuring fluorescent intensities of individual cells 81 that are clustered and/or overlap remains a daunting problem during image analysis. Efficient, 82 accurate, and automated computational pipelines to determine potential cell-to-cell 83 communication through Ca2+, are expected to enhance the current understanding of endocrine 84 cell behaviors. 85 Automated image analysis tools are continually being developed and made readily 86 available to the investigators. Technological advancements have both decreased the time 87 required to perform wet lab experiments and enabled researchers to obtain more sophisticated 88 data. Open-source software such as ImageJ [14] and its updated architecture, Fiji [15], have been 89 widely utilized for the evaluation of biological images. Fiji\u2019s plugin, Trackmate [16], can further 90 be used for the tracking of individual cells. Multiple other tracking procedures have been written 91\nin Python for specific research needs [17\u201319]. These tools are among many that can be combined 92 with customized algorithms for enhanced biological research. 93 Segmentation is an important tool that allows researchers to computationally identify 94 regions of interest (ROIs) and analyze them using different methodologies [14]. Manual 95 segmentation has in the past been a standard protocol. However, it is time intensive and often 96 subject to human errors and biases (Supplemental Fig 1) [20,21]. Typically, analysis of 97 fluorescent images begins by outlining individual cells to measure fluorescent intensities that 98 might fluctuate with time. With the need for batch analysis of imaging data becoming more 99\nprevalent, an automated analysis tool is required to efficiently identify individual cells through a 100 time-series image stack and eventually predict and validate physiological responses (e.g., insulin 101 secretion). Hand segmentation remains a strong measure of evaluation for overall training 102 accuracy, but automated methods are quickly being established as the new primary method of 103 imaging analysis [22]. 104 In recent years, many tools have been developed to continue improving automated 105 segmentation of cellular microscopy images including watershed algorithms, pre-processing 106 techniques, deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network architectures, and 107 combinations of multiple techniques [23\u201329]. Before the wide use of deep learning, novel 108 segmentation techniques involved differentiating cells from the background through 109 thresholding, masking general cell outlines through complex mathematical operations, redefining 110 cell shapes with the watershed algorithm, incorporation of active contours to identify rounded 111 cell shapes, or a combination of multiple methods to create a more accurate segmentation of 112 clustered cells [30\u201333]. While these previous techniques are still applicable and useful in 113 conjunction with newer methods, the incorporation of deep neural networks has been able to 114 overcome common issues such as heterogenous distribution of the fluorescent markers for 115 watershed and uniform shapes making masking difficult. Deep learning-based methods are able 116 to utilize large hand annotated data sets to accurately segment cells without relying on predefined 117 shapes, distinct cell boundaries, or an evenly distributed cell culture with minimal clustering 118 [34\u201338]. More novel deep learning networks, such as Cellpose, aim to create generalist models 119 that increase flexibility of image analysis by training with a variety of cell types. 120 Cellpose [34] is a generalist, deep-learning algorithm designed for accurate segmentation 121 of a wide variation of cell types. Its model is optimal for different types of biological research, as 122\nit provides segmentation without the need for retraining [34]. The algorithm is user-friendly and 123 customizable for specific experimental needs, and its newest updates offer human-in-the-loop 124 pipelines and methods for retraining [39]. Since its inception, several studies have already 125 utilized its model. Saad et al. [40] developed a procedure using Cellpose and Fiji to characterize 126 ice crystals, and Hoeren et al. [41] adapted Cellpose into their pipeline analyzing cells adhering 127 to PMP-ECMO membranes as an alternative segmentation process to Fiji. Reinbigler et al. [42] 128 modified the model\u2019s base framework and used it in conjunction with QuPath [43] to create a 129 pipeline for the segmentation of Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) stained histopathological whole slide 130 images of myofibers. Waisman et al. [44] similarly used Cellpose for myofiber segmentation, 131 outputting the images to ImageJ for ROI analysis. Fisch et al. [45] incorporated StarDist [35] for 132 nuclear segmentation and Cellpose for nuclear segmentation in their automated workflow for the 133 analysis of host-pathogen interactions. Our aim in this study seeks to develop and apply 134 computational methods to obtain a faster, more accurate and in-depth analysis of calcium 135 signaling in \u03b2-cells. 136\n137\nMaterials and Methods 138 Our primary goal is to create an automated system that outlines cell boundaries 139 (segmentation) and track individual \u03b2-cells over a sequence of different time points (Fig 1). The 140 system includes and performs statistical analyses on the calcium intensity patterns from 141 individual cells. The completed pipeline can be used through a Jupyter Notebook and all package 142 dependencies are described in the GitHub repository. Referred to as the BetaBuddy GitHub, it 143 also contains installation and usage instructions for inexperienced programmers to easily follow 144 and create a more accessible tool for all researchers to implement in their experimental 145 procedures. The automated pipeline is expected to improve the accuracy of data and decrease the 146 overall time necessary for future studies. The entire procedure was run using an NVIDIA DGX 147 A100 High Memory GPU Supercomputer, containing 8 NVIDIA A100 high memory graphics 148 cards with 80GB of GPU RAM each for a total of 640GB of GPU RAM for training large Deep 149 Bayesian model architectures. The system also has 2 TB of HBM2 RAM and 128 AMD EPYC 150 CPU Cores, and it connects to the internet via 10 GB/S connection. The process from image 151\nconversion, segmentation, tracking, and finally statistical analysis was successfully performed 152 with 1 GPU, 12 CPUs, and 32GB of memory allocated. 153\n154\nFigure 1.

(f) Visualization of tracks created after registration and tracking. This 160 figure includes the original fluorescent image, mask image, ROI outlines, and predicted tracks 161 cells followed throughout the imaging process. (e-g) Statistical analysis is incorporated to 162 generated automated results, which can be compared with manually analyzed results (see Fig. 6 163 below). 164\nCalcium imaging and deep learning-based segmentation 165 The images used in our automated pipeline were sourced from previous experimental 166 images that monitored and recorded Ca2+ dynamics in real-time [46]. Mouse derived \u03b2TC-6 167 insulinoma cells were cultured and allowed to grow for several days. A calcium indicator dye 168 (Fluo-8) was used to measure changes in intracellular calcium levels. The cells were stained with 169 0.8 \u03bcM Fluo-8, and 1 drop/mL Nucblue to visualize the nuclei, for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and loaded 170 onto a custom-designed electric field exposure chamber [46]. Non-invasive electric field 171 stimulation (EFS; 15 min exposure) was chosen to manipulate the voltage-gated calcium 172 channels and therefore modulate intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. A Nikon microscope was used to 173 image the cells at 5 s intervals over a period of 2 min before and after EFS (Figs. 1a and 1b). 174 This method provided a baseline and changes in the intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured. 175 Data for such experiments consisted of stacked 2048x2048 pixel image sets of 25 frames before 176 and after EFS. In total, 56 image stacks were analyzed. The Fluo-8 fluorescent image data sets 177 consisted of pre- and post-exposure images of non-invasive 1 to 3 V/cm EFS. The analysis 178 pipeline was used to analyze approximately 9-10 image sets for each experimental condition. 179 Pre-exposure cells served as their own control. 180 Once the cells are imaged, multiple single or stacked images can be imported directly to 181 the script and begin segmentation after format conversion. The Java library, Bio-Formats, is first 182 used to convert the Nikon-specific file types to TIFF for ease of use in Linux ImageJ macro 183 functions. The stacked files are then merged with an image of only the nuclei (labeled with 184 DAPI) from the first frame of the exposure period (Fig. 1b). It was determined that adding a 185 DAPI channel greatly improved the segmentation process. Due to the clustering and static, non-186 migratory nature of \u03b2-cells, one DAPI image was determined sufficient in assisting segmentation 187 for all frames. 188 A validated deep learning-based generalist cellular segmentation algorithm, Cellpose, is 189 used to automatically outline the boundary of each cell and create an ROI with user-defined 190 parameters [34]. Users may specify if their images contain a DAPI channel, which channel 191\ncontains the entire cell, the Cellpose model for segmentation, and thresholds. These parameters 192 can be tested on one image to ensure quality segmentation. The generalist algorithm has a better 193 performance with the addition of a DAPI channel due to the clustering nature of \u03b2-cells and 194 difficulty differentiating neighboring cells with only one calcium indicator dye. After 195 segmentation, images defining the ROI of every cell are saved (Fig. 1c). \u2018Mask\u2019 images 196 differentiate individual cells by assigning every ROI a different grayscale color (Fig. 1c). The 197 unique color can be used as a label during cell registration and tracking. 198 The separated mask images are sorted into an image stack and merged with the original 199 image with only Fluo-8. Merging is performed by sorting each image stack into a different color 200 channel. This format will allow for the Fiji plugin, TrackMate, to begin cell registration by 201 identifying the ROIs labeled in the channel containing the mask images [47]. The cell track 202 detector analyzes the mask channel and registers every uniquely colored shape as an individual 203 cell. Next, each cell is linked across multiple frames, creating a \u201ctrack\u201d (Fig. 1d). Lastly, 204 fluorescent intensity for each frame in a cell\u2019s track is obtained by referencing the first channel, 205 which holds the original fluorescent image. The intensity values are averaged from within the 206 cell\u2019s complementary ROI. This process is completely automated using the ImageJ\u2019s macro and 207 python scripting features. This step will create an XML file that can be loaded into TrackMate 208 and create a visualization of the tracks produced. Users are encouraged to check this visual 209 before continuing to ensure the analysis is accurate. Lastly, a CSV file is saved containing 210 fluorescent intensity values, area, and spatial coordinate positions by grouping each cell into a 211 \u201cTrack ID\u201d over time. 212\n213\nPipeline customization 214 BetaBuddy was designed as a customizable tool that can be easily adapted to the specific 215 needs of each researcher. For this experiment, two primary modifications were made to the 216 pipeline to assist in its data analysis. First, to analyze control vs. experimental data, we stitched 217 the pre-exposure and post-exposure image sets together. Secondly, to account for the generalist 218 algorithm not properly identifying low-intensity ROIs, we created a composite image of the 219 maximum intensity value for every pixel, ensuring more definable cell boundaries for all active 220 cells (Supplemental Fig 2). A composite image is created for the control and experimental image 221\nsets separately. Both composites are segmented, and the masks are overlayed on all frames in 222 their respective image stacks. A flowchart for this pipeline can be seen in Supplementary Figure 223 2. 224 225\nBackground subtraction 226 Initially, the raw data CSV created after registration and tracking are very saturated with 227 external background noise (Fig. 2a). Fluorescent images typically have background noise 228 associated with excessive dye or thermal electronic fluctuation. Therefore, raw data should 229 undergo a background subtraction process. To obtain a well-distributed sample of background 230 intensities, 100 pixel locations outside of the ROIs are randomly selected from the original image 231 stack. The randomly selected pixel is compared to the mask image stack to ensure the pixel 232 intensity has a value of 0, verifying it is not within an ROI. The pixel intensities across all frames 233 are saved into a CSV file and subtracted from the raw intensity values for normalization and 234 statistical analysis (Fig. 2b). 235 236\nNormalization 237 Evaluation of all acquired data is analyzed through a procedure written in R and called 238 upon through a terminal command in the Jupyter Notebook. The working directory is set to the 239 user\u2019s current operating space, and the CSV files containing the raw tracking information and 240 background points are automatically imported. First, the average of all 100 randomly sampled 241 background pixels is calculated for each unique frame. This mean value is then merged into the 242 cell tracking information to create a singular data set. The average background intensity for each 243 time point is then subtracted from the mean intensity of each cell within that frame. Next, to 244 establish individual baseline activity, mean intensities were normalized specific to each 245 individual cell. 246\n247\nFigure 2. Intensity of Experimental Data. a) Each line represents an individual cell and its 248 fluorescent intensity tracked over a period of 2 min. The same sample was treated with a 1 V/cm 249 electric field for 15 min. b) Raw intensity values undergo background subtraction and 250 normalization for a more accurate depiction of calcium activity. 251 252 In keeping with the original experiment\u2019s methodology, a change in fluorescent intensity >=10% 253 was notated as spiking activity [46]. We kept this 10% threshold for the purpose of comparing 254\nthe accuracy of either manual or automated data analysis of calcium dynamics in b-cells. To find 255\na baseline for each cell, the number of data points until each specific Track ID reached a change 256 of >= 10% from its first recorded intensity was calculated, and the mean of these first N points 257 was divided from each background-subtracted intensity within the group. If a cell never reached 258 an intensity level greater than 10% of its first value, then its baseline was determined using the 259 mean intensity of all recorded data points for that cell. 260\n261\nSpike determination 262 The purpose of this experiment was to repeat the analysis of spiking activity within the 263 original data set that utilized hand segmentation methods. Our goal was to determine if there was 264 any significant loss of data in the original methodology. For the automated analysis, we defined a 265 calcium spike using the 10% threshold, as previously stated. The percent change in normalized 266 intensity from its previous value was calculated for each \u03b2TC-6 cell. Based on the value changes, 267 a spike was defined in two ways: either (1) the percent change from the data point immediately 268 preceding any peak in intensity was >= 10%, or (2) the sum of the cumulative percent changes 269 between two peaks was >= 10% (Fig. 3). 270\n271\n272 273\nFigure 3. Calcium Spike Determination. Computational methods were used to automatically 274 designate calcium spikes at a 10% threshold. This threshold was met through either (a) the sum 275 of percent changes between two designated peaks or (b) a singular percent change of >= 10% 276 immediately preceding a defined peak. 277 278\nResults 279 Statistical analysis 280\nPrior to statistical tests, outliers for individual trials were detected using a standard Z 281 score. Track IDs with any intensity values greater than a Z score of 3.5, or less than -3.5 were 282 automatically removed. Mean spiking activity was calculated as the total number of spikes 283 recorded for each trial divided by total number of cells over time. A two-tailed paired t test was 284 performed to compare changes in spiking activity between the pre- and post-EFS images of 1 to 285 3 V/cm. Figure 5 illustrates one experiment using 1 V/cm stimulation. Normalized calcium 286 activity was plotted from -2 to 0 min (i.e., control before EFS was applied) and from 0 to 2 min 287 following 15 min EFS. Calcium recording during 15 min EFS was not performed to minimize 288 fluorophore degradation and/or bleaching. 289\n290 291\nFigure 4. Signaling Changes Post EFS Stimulation. Variations in activity, including changes 292 in the fluorescent intensity and spiking frequency, increased significantly following a 15 min 293 exposure to 1 V/cm EFS. *** denotes p < 0.001. 294 295 Using our automated process, significant changes in the calcium signaling of the \u03b2-cells 296 in response to EFS were determined and compared against published results. Applying EFS of 1 297 to 3 V/cm, the numbers of calcium spikes determined manually and using the automated pipeline 298 were plotted and compared (Fig. 5). A clear trend is established that manually determined 299 calcium spikes were underestimated by ~ 40% in control cells without exposure to an EFS. In the 300 EFS-treated cells (1 or 2 V/cm), the same trend is observed, suggesting that the calcium spike 301 counting determined by hand is also underestimated. This finding is indicative of systematic 302\nerrors that may have been caused by human biases. It is interesting to note that a larger EFS (3 303 V/cm) did not induce statistically significant changes in the calcium spiking determined either by 304 hand or by automated pipeline. We speculated that, since the induced electrical potential depends 305 on the cluster size, larger EFS causes non-negligible and perhaps irreversible changes in the cell 306 membrane potential. Generally, automated analysis found greater overall spiking activity in the 307\nbTC-6 cells. 308\n309\nFigure 5. Comparison of Results. The number of calcium spikes determined by hand are shown 310 in the left panel. Using the same images, the results from the automated analysis are shown in the 311 right panel. * denotes p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01. 312 313\nDiscussion 314 The application of electric field stimulation to \u03b2TC-6 cells was found to successfully 315 increase calcium spiking activity. This indicates that EFS within 1 to 2 V/cm serves as a 316 potentially beneficial treatment for pre-conditioning isolated islets prior to transplantation. While 317 it remains to be further elucidated whether one-time treatment of islets with EFS is sufficient to 318 pre-condition them, it does offer a non-biologic approach to regulate insulin secretion and/or 319 trafficking. Development of the BetaBuddy pipeline therefore enables us to predict the optimal 320 application of exogenous stimuli that can be validated experimentally and provides a pathway to 321\nfully utilize the machine learning-based discoveries in the b-cell physiology. Furthermore, 322\nresults that were previously reported using manual segmentation (see Fig. 5) were compared with 323 those determined by the BetaBuddy. Both sets of results were comparable, suggesting analysis 324\nby hand was able to quantify the calcium dynamics in b-cells but underestimated the calcium 325\nspiking rate. Automated segmentation thus appears to be a viable and more accurate method for 326 obtaining reliable results without the tedious and laborious practices. 327 The output from this pipeline additionally offers considerably more information than 328 would normally be available with standard segmentation practices. Previous analysis of this data 329 only provided whole frame averages of fluorescent intensity changes. Specialized data for each 330 individual cell at every experimental time point is available through the automated method. We 331 are thus able to locate cells of interest and evaluate their spiking patterns based on specific 332 temporal and spatial points. Questions regarding calcium spiking frequency and cell-to-cell 333 interaction through calcium propagation are now feasible for detailed analysis. This is perhaps 334 one of the major advantages that were made possible by the development of automated 335 segmentation and analysis. For example, intercellular communication often relies on calcium 336 waves through gap junctions [48\u201350].Since EFS we used in this work does not penetrate the cell, 337 it may be hypothesized that the outer cells in a cluster of cells are likely affected by the EFS and 338 generate calcium activities first. Through calcium intercellular communication, the inner cells in 339 the cluster are affected at a later time. However, the cluster is collectively activated by EFS that 340 leads to an increase in insulin production. Experiments are underway to validate this hypothesis 341 and the results will again be used to train the model to recognize the calcium-dependent cell-to-342 cell communication that may be relevant to the islet physiology. 343 344\nFuture work 345 Future work will include retraining the generalist segmentation pipeline, Cellpose, with a 346 large set of \u03b2-cell images in order to create a specialized deep-learning model. Current 347 segmentation with the generalist training is very useful and can give detailed insights on the 348 image set, but it is not entirely accurate. Many cells become split into multiple ROIs, 349 neighboring cells are merged into one mask, or cells will merge or split for one frame creating a 350 broken track that will be misrepresented during normalization. We are theorizing that retraining 351 with a massive dataset of only \u03b2-cell images and similarly clustering cells will give our pipeline 352\nthe ability to create more accurate ROIs and subsequent individualized cell data for culturing 353 condition and cell interaction studies. 354 Secondly, we plan to continue expanding the accessibility of our pipeline. A cleaner, 355 more interactive user interface within the Jupyter Notebook is being developed along with an 356 Anaconda package for researchers to easily create an environment with all the necessary 357 packages pre-installed. Additionally, we are developing more user-friendly options for running 358 different data analyses. This includes options for various statistical tests depending on researcher 359 preference and the types of biological questions being asked. With these new features, users will 360 be able to run desired tests within the pipeline along with having access to both the raw and 361 normalized data. 362 363\n364 365\nFig 6. Spatial Visualization. a) Cartesian coordinates were used to visualize the locations of 366 spiking cells. Only cells currently spiking are outlined at a given time. The cells highlighted in 367 red color, for example, exhibit calcium spiking activity at t = 25 s. The visual analysis does not 368 correlate to the actual size of cell clusters. b) The generated spatial data can be used to trace back 369 and identify cells of interest in the original experimental images. 370 371 This specialized data offers many resources for analyzing calcium signaling in new ways. 372 Cell-specific spatial and fluorescent intensity data can be utilized, for example, to evaluate 373\nvarying levels of insulin secretion in given locations (Fig 6). Researchers can use these methods 374\nto not only look at current spiking patterns, but also begin to analyze how calcium signaling is 375 affected by intercellular interactions. 376\n377\nConclusions 378 Our current pipeline successfully isolates \u03b2-cells, tracks calcium signaling patterns over 379 time, and produces preliminary data values that can be used in future statistical analyses. The 380 automated segmentation additionally reduces biases, decreases time required for analysis 381 compared with manual segmentation, and provides more individualized data. With this 382 information, we are able to pinpoint individual cells with the most biologically significant 383 spiking patterns. Additionally, individual calcium activities can be monitored over time, offering 384 critical spatial and temporal information. 385 BetaBuddy has a multitude of benefits for potential research. Its customizable platform 386 allows it to be adapted for use with multiple cell types. Its base structure has already been 387 utilized for the automated analysis of mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs) and human 388 mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Additionally, the pipeline is designed in a way that 389 researchers from diverse background can use regardless of past coding experience. 390 Information obtained from this data may greatly assist in treatments for Type I Diabetes. 391 Understanding the complexities of calcium signaling within pancreatic \u03b2-cells can provide 392 guidance to better strategize and apply stem cell-derived islet transplants. There is still much to 393 learn regarding the most effective forms of islet transplants, including clinically efficacious 394 dosage and cell composition of stem cell-derived islets [9]. In the future, our algorithm has the 395 potential to be used to predict viable cells for islet transplantation. Moreover, these methods can 396 ultimately be used for the evaluation of invasive and non-invasive treatment options. Our 397 automated analysis can potentially decrease evaluation times for multiple treatment alternatives, 398 and even serve as a drug repurposing tool. This pipeline has the capability to lower the risk of 399 failed transplants and will further provide the field with a valuable computational resource to 400 significantly improve current treatment plans. 401\nAcknowledgements 402 We would like to thank Dr. Caleb Liebman for his dedicated work culturing insulinoma (\u03b2TC-6) 403 mouse cells and providing the calcium images. 404\n405 This work would not have been possible without the support of the NIH Predoctoral Training 406 Grant (HL134613; PI, Kytai Nguyen), the University of Texas System Rising STARs Award 407 (J.M.L), the CPRIT First Time Faculty Award (J.M.L), and the Alfred R. and Janet H.

(b) Our 565 automated system comprising merging DAPI with the targeted fluorescein channel, 566 segmentation, and subsequent ROI tracking was able to consistently identify more cells at a 567 higher accuracy and track localized signals. 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589\n590\nSupplemental Figure 3. Adjusted BetaBuddy Pipeline Flow Chart. (a) Original Ca2+ 591 microscopy images of \u03b2-cells (20x objective) converted to TIFF file from the Nikon-specific 592 format. (b) A composite image is made by identifying the maximum value of each pixel location 593 from the image stack. The resulting image is the brightest pixel out of all images in the stack, 594 ensuring the states where each cell is fully fluorescing is in one image. This will allow for a more 595 accurate segmentation without dropout due to non-fluorescing cells. (c) Composite Fluo-8 stained 596 \u03b2-cell image and DAPI stain of nuclei of \u03b2-cells showing only the nuclei of individual cells merged 597 with both images in a separate channel, assisting in a more accurate segmentation. (d) ROI mask 598 after composite segmentation and overlayed predicted outlines from after Cellpose segmentation. 599 (e) Mask of segmented composite image is merged with all images in the image stack. Due to this 600 step only image stacks with exceptionally minimal movement should be used. (f) Visualization of 601 tracks created after registration and tracking. This figure includes the original fluorescent image, 602 mask image, ROI outlines, and predicted tracks cells followed throughout the imaging process. (e-603 g) Statistical analysis is incorporated to generated automated results, which can be compared with 604 manually analyzed results. 605\n606 607 608\n609 Supplemental Figure 3. Previous Segmentation Loss. Initial registration and tracking was 610 limited by subtle movements between imaging periods. The total number of unique ROIs (a) 611 often decreased by ~80% when accounting for only the registered cells that could be tracked 612 between all frames (b). Customization of the BetaBuddy pipeline included merging the DAPI 613 channel with the original Fluo-8 images and creating a composite image using the maximum 614 intensity value for every pixel, allowing for optimum segmentation. 615"
