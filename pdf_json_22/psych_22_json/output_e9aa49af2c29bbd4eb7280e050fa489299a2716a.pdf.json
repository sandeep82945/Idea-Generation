    "abstractText": "Several studies have examined trends in depression, but only few have explicitly considered possible generational differences. I examined changes in the burden of depressive symptoms between 2002 and 2017 according to age, time period and birth cohort in Germany. I used population-based data drawn from the German Aging Survey (N = 33,723, 54% female, ages 40 +) from 2002, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017. Depressive symptoms were measured via the CES-D 15. Hierarchical age-periodcohort models were used to examine trends in depression. I found that depressive symptoms changed across age, time period and birth cohorts. While there was a general decrease across time periods, strong evidence for a U-shaped cohort effect was also found: Younger generations, beginning with cohorts born after the World War II, increasingly report more depressive symptoms than older generations. This U-shaped cohort trend appeared most pronounced for the somatic symptoms subscale. Contrarily, only minimal cohort differences were found regarding the positive affect subscale. Therefore, depressive symptoms, and especially somatic symptoms, seem to increase in more recent birth cohorts in Germany, who might thus be at risk to experience more mental health problems in the future. Potential reasons for these trends and the generalizability of the results to other countries should be investigated by future studies.",

            "text": "Depression is seen as the result of a complex relationship between personal and contextual factors, encompassing affective-cognitive as well as somatic symptoms (Goldberg, 2006). Depression poses a significant burden to global population health (James et\u00a0al., 2018): In addition to being a common and severe disorder itself, depression and depressive symptoms have also been shown to be major predictors of other health-related outcomes including cardiovascular disease, early retirement, dementia, and mortality (Byers & Yaffe, 2011; Gilman et\u00a0al., 2017; Karpansalo, 2005; Rice et\u00a0al., 2011; Thom et\u00a0al., 2019). Consequently, depression is also one of the leading causes of life years lost due to\nill-health, disability and early death (Kassebaum et\u00a0al., 2016; Vigo et\u00a0al., 2016).\nTherefore, studies on trends in depressive symptoms are needed (Bretschneider et\u00a0al., 2018; Thomson & Katikireddi, 2018). Changes in depressive symptoms over time can occur according to three time-related variables: age, time period and birth cohort (Y. Yang & Land, 2013). Regarding age, depressive symptoms could change over time simply due to population aging processes and the accompanying changes in mental health risks such as increased social isolation in old age (Beller & Wagner, 2018; Cacioppo et\u00a0al., 2010). In accordance with this possibility, depressive symptoms have been shown to increase in old age (Bell, 2014; Beller et\u00a0al., 2020; Sutin et\u00a0al., 2013). Depressive symptoms might also vary with the time period, which corresponds to the calendar years depressive symptoms are measured. As one example, recent large-scale changes in risk factors for depressive symptoms might have also affected depressive symptoms in the general population of developed countries, such as increased financial difficulties during the 2008 financial crisis, increased sedentary lifestyle, or advances in mental health treatments and health care access (e.g., Angermeyer Responsible Editor: Thorsten Kneip. * Johannes Beller Beller.Johannes@mh-hannover.de\n1 Hannover Medical School, Center for\u00a0Public Health and\u00a0Health Care, Medical Sociology Unit, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625\u00a0Hannover, Germany\n1 3\net\u00a0al., 2014; Lee et\u00a0al., 2010; Pescosolido et\u00a0al., 2021; L. Yang et\u00a0al., 2019). Finally, depressive symptoms might also change over time due to birth cohorts. This refers to generational effects that affect groups born within a particular time period that, because they are born in a similar time, share similar socio-historical experiences (Colman & Ataullahjan, 2010). These shared socio-historical experiences throughout the life course might affect the risk of developing depressive symptoms in specific birth cohorts. As a prominent example, experiencing the deprivation following World War II in Germany might have increased the lifelong risk to experience depressive symptoms in the respective birth cohorts of Germans (Stephan et\u00a0al., 2019). Thus, trends in depression can occur due to age, period, and cohort effects.\nSeveral studies have analyzed trends in depression, but recently only few studies have explicitly included the birth cohort as one of the potentially important contextual factors in mental health development, with contradicting results. For example, Twenge and colleagues used hierarchical ageperiod-cohort (HAPC) models to analyze trends in diverse indicators of mood disorder among US youth and adults (Twenge et\u00a0al., 2019). They found that trends were primarily due to cohort differences, with younger generations exhibiting increasing levels of psychological distress. Similarly, Sullivan and colleagues (Sullivan et\u00a0al., 2020) used a modified version of the 8-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and found that the depressive burden of US older adults decreased across birth cohorts. In contrast, Keyes and colleagues (2019) recently analyzed trends in depressive symptoms of US students of the 8th, 10th, and 12th grade from 1991 to 2018. Here, depression was measured as a continuous construct via self-report as a sum score of four depressive symptoms. The authors found that depressive symptoms increased in their samples over time, especially among girls. However, cohort effects were found to be minimal at best. In a European context, Spiers and colleagues (2011) analyzed age, period and birth cohort differences in the prevalence of common mental disorder. Using an English sample, they found little evidence for changes in common mental disorder over time. Contrasting with these results, Bramajo (2022) recently analyzed trends in depression in six European countries, including Germany. Using age-period-cohort methods, they found increases in the prevalence of depression among younger born cohorts, especially among men. Hence, studies on trends in depression disagree regarding the importance of the birth cohort: While some studies find strong birth cohort differences in depressive symptoms, others fail to replicate this finding. Additionally, although depression is seen as encompassing heterogeneous symptoms from affective as\nwell as somatic domains, studies are lacking that examine how sub-dimensions of depressive symptoms vary over time (den Hollander-Gijsman et\u00a0al., 2012). Furthermore, previous studies have been limited geographically, in that they mostly stem from samples in the USA. Thus, more research on generational differences in depressive symptoms is needed.\nThe current study aims to address these issues. It contributes to the literature by examining age-period-cohort differences in depressive symptoms between 2002 and 2017, explicitly also considering sub-dimensions of depression and utilizing a large population-based German sample (N = 33,723). Thereby the current study clarifies how depressive symptoms and their affective and somatic sub-dimensions have changed over time in Germany and the degree to which cohort effects/generational differences might explain these trends."

The German Aging Survey (Deutscher Alterssurvey; DEAS) is a cohort-sequential longitudinal, population-based study on Germans aged 40\u00a0years and older that is provided by the Research Data Center of the German Center of Gerontology (Klaus et\u00a0al., 2017; Mahne et\u00a0al., 2020; Motel-Klingebiel et\u00a0al., 2016). For the German Aging Survey, participants are drawn randomly by probability sampling in 1996, 2002, 2008 and 2014. Additionally, participants from previous waves are re-contacted in 2002, 2008, 2011, 2014 and 2017. All interviews are conducted face-to-face in the participant\u2019s residence. All procedures are in accordance with German law and the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.

Multiple studies have demonstrated the scale\u2019s validity and reliability to measure depressive symptoms in different cultures and throughout the lifespan (e.g., Karim et\u00a0al., 2015; Kliem et\u00a0al., 2020; Vilagut et\u00a0al., 2016). The CES-D 15 measures the frequency of depressive symptoms in the week prior to the interview. Participants were asked whether they (1) \u201cwere bothered\u201d, (2) \u201ccould not shake off the blues\u201d, (3) \u201chad trouble concentrating\u201d, (4) \u201cfelt depressed\u201d, (5) \u201cfelt that everything was an effort\u201d, (6) \u201cthought that their life had been a failure\u201d, (7) \u201cfelt fearful\u201d, and (8) \u201cslept restlessly\u201d, (9, reverse scored) \u201cwere happy\u201d, (10) \u201ctalked less than usual\u201d, (11) \u201cfelt lonely\u201d, (12, reverse scored) \u201cenjoyed their life\u201d, (13) \u201cfelt sad\u201d, (14) \u201cfelt that people dislike them\u201d, and (15) \u201ccould not get going\u201d. Participants could choose to respond with one of four response options ranging from \u201cnone or almost none of the time\u201d (score 0) to \u201call or almost all of the time\u201d (score 3). In accordance with psychometric evidence, a dimensional mean depressive symptoms score was calculated as the mean of all responses ranging from 0 to 3 (Liu, 2016). Additionally, three subscales of the CESD, as reported in the literature, were constructed via mean scores also ranging from 0 to 3 (the fourth sub-scale could not be constructed because half of the items were missing from the 15-item version of the CES-D): Negative Affect (items 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 13), Positive Affect (items 9, 12), and Somatic Symptoms (items 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15). In the current study, reliability of the CES-D 15 mean score was acceptable (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.76)."

            "text": "First, descriptive statistics of all variables across time periods are reported in the results section. Then, to separate the effects of age, time period, and birth cohort, I performed hierarchical age-period-cohort analyses (HAPC; Y. Yang & Land, 2013). The fundamental difficulty in separating age, period and cohort effects is their perfect linear relationship, i.e., age = period-cohort, because of which regular statistical methods such as linear regression analysis cannot be used. To separate age, period and cohort effects, certain assumptions must be made, which are determined by the specific age-period-cohort model one employs. In their HAPC model, Yang and Land (2013) proposed using multilevel models to estimate age-period-cohort effects, with age being assumed to be an individual fixed predictor, nested into time periods and birth cohorts on the second level with random intercepts. Additionally, age is typically used as a continuous\nvariable, whereas time periods and birth cohorts are used as categorical variables, with cohorts being typically grouped into five-year intervals. In line with the estimation of multilevel models, HAPC models are estimated in a two-step procedure in which first the effect of age is calculated, and then, depending on the resulting residuals, the remaining variance is allocated to period and cohort differences (Luo & Hodges, 2020). Thus, in HAPC analysis it is typically assumed that there is a prominent age-effect to which period and cohort differences are subordinated. It is also typically assumed that there are only negligible intra-cohort differences within the 5-year cohort groups and that there are no interaction effects between age, period and cohort. Furthermore, extensive simulation analyses have shown that HAPC models might underestimate cohort effects and might provide inaccurate results when strictly linear cohort effects are present, which, however, seems to be exceedingly rare in empirical research, as argued by proponents of HAPC methodology (Bell & Jones, 2018; Fosse & Winship, 2019; Fu, 2018; Luo & Hodges, 2020; Masters & Powers, 2020; Reither et\u00a0al., 2015). Notwithstanding the theoretical differences, agreement between the HAPC method and other analysis options is reported to be good (Masters & Powers, 2020).\nFollowing the recommendations of Yang and Land (2013), I estimated these HAPC models with individuals nested in birth cohort groups and time periods, allowing mean levels of depressive symptoms to vary across time periods and birth cohorts. For all HAPC analyses, the depressive symptom scores were z-scaled such that they had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, in order to improve the interpretability and comparability of results. As such the HAPC results can be interpreted similar to standardized mean differences, e.g., with a value of 0.5 denoting a change of half a standard deviation in depressive symptoms in the general population. Hierarchical age-period-cohort models have been successfully used to examine trends in multiple areas of science, including trends on health (Beller & Epping, 2020; Diouf et\u00a0al., 2010; Twenge et\u00a0al., 2019). Age, period and cohort effects can provide evidence on large-scale trends, but, as in regular trend analyses, determining the causal influences generating these trends remains difficult (Bell, 2020). According to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the multilevel model that included both random effects of time period and birth cohort was the most appropriate for the data and is hence used in the current study (Hierarchical Age-Period Model: AIC = 35,711.18;\n1 3\nHierarchical Age-Cohort Model: AIC = 35,659.42; Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort Model: AIC = 35,613.99). As the results were similar for both genders, the combined analysis is mainly presented in the results section; gender-specific results are, however, also reported. Additionally, several sensitivity analyses are reported in Appendix (an HAPC analysis including only baseline participants and an HAPC analysis using alternative model specifications). All statistical analyses were performed with R."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "I examined age-period-cohort trends in depressive symptoms in Germany and found that depressive symptoms descriptively decreased across time periods. However, I also found evidence for a U-shaped cohort effect: Younger generations, beginning with cohorts born after the World War II, reported more depressive symptoms than older generations. Although strict conclusions due to overlapping confidence intervals between subscales are not possible, this U-shaped cohort trend appeared most pronounced for somatic symptoms.\nPrevious studies in US and European samples had provided conflicting evidence regarding the existence of a\ncohort effect in trends in depressive symptoms, with some providing support for a cohort effect (Bramajo, 2022; Sullivan et\u00a0al., 2020; Twenge et\u00a0al., 2019), and others providing no support for it (Keyes et\u00a0al., 2019; Spiers et\u00a0al., 2011). As I found evidence for a general cohort effect in Germany, the current study supports the existence of a cohort effect in depression trends. Going beyond previous studies, I was able to also study trends in sub-dimensions of depression. Here, I found that the strongest cohort differences were observed in somatic symptoms, while cohort differences in (lack of) positive affect can only be described as minimal (however, it must be noted that the confidence intervals between subscales were overlapping and thus these results must be taken as preliminary). Furthermore, the effect sizes of these inter-cohort differences were substantial: Comparing the cohorts born in 1940\u20131945 and 1970\u20131975 results in a difference of about d = 0.2, which roughly corresponds to the often-analyzed gender differences in depressive symptoms observed in this study and others (Salk et\u00a0al., 2017). Hence, one potential explanation for previous contrasting results is that the extent of cohort differences in depressive symptoms differs depending on their specific latent content. If substantiated, these results are alarming from a public mental health perspective (Eaton & Fallin, 2019). As mental health problems are often chronic, future generations might experience more long-lasting depressive symptoms than previous generations in Germany, the rest of Europe and the USA (H\u00f6lzel et\u00a0al., 2011). Furthermore, as somatic symptoms of depression are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, special consideration should be given to these specific symptoms (Greden, 2003). Consequently, more prevention and intervention efforts are needed as well as research on the potential reasons for the apparent increase across generations.\nThere are several possible explanations for this increase in depressive symptoms in younger birth cohorts in Germany. First, later born birth cohorts might be exposed to increasing mental health risks (Stephan et\u00a0al., 2019). Situational characteristics relevant to depressive symptoms might have changed over time, such as increasingly stressful life circumstances, higher levels of social isolation and the use of social media (Beller & Wagner, 2018; Lin et\u00a0al., 2016; Melchior et\u00a0al., 2007). Additionally, habits are formed early in the life course and several studies have found that lifestyles differ according to one\u2019s birth cohort (e.g., Macky et\u00a0al., 2008). Thus, although empirical evidence is scarce, one potential explanation for the\n1 3\nobserved cohort differences might be that generations differ in important personal and situational characteristics like increasingly stressful environments and lower levels of physical activity.\nSecond, according to the expansion of morbidity and the dynamic equilibrium of morbidity hypotheses (Gruenberg, 1977; Manton, 1982), depressive symptoms might be on the rise because chronic diseases are also increasing. Depressive symptoms co-occur with other chronic diseases and impairments like diabetes and disability (Mukherjee & Chaturvedi, 2019; Noh et\u00a0al., 2016): Depressive symptoms might be triggered as a psychological consequence of experiencing chronic physical disease; additionally, depressive symptoms and many physical diseases share common etiological pathways (Gold et\u00a0al., 2020; Ogunmoroti et\u00a0al., 2022). Furthermore, depressive symptoms are also found to be independent risk factors for many physical diseases (e.g., Dong et\u00a0al., 2012; Knol et\u00a0al., 2006). Thus, depressive symptoms might co-increase with associated chronic physical diseases. And indeed, multiple previous studies have found that conditions such as obesity, diabetes and disability are on the rise (Beller & Epping, 2020; Sperlich et\u00a0al., 2020). As depressive symptoms represent a prevalent comorbidity of most chronic diseases, increasing rates of depressive symptoms could be partly explained by this rise of general morbidity among younger generations. This might also partly explain the observed relative stronger increases in somatic symptoms, because somatic depressive symptoms are most frequently found to co-occur with physical disease (Hays et\u00a0al., 1998; Thom et\u00a0al., 2019).\nLastly, in accordance with a \u201csnowflake effect\u201d, cognitive anchoring might affect survey responses. Perhaps, older cohorts have internalized other benchmarks of what it means to experience depressed affect, a lack of positive affect and depressive symptoms. If this was the case, the same levels of depressive symptoms might be rated as more prevalent by younger generations, although the \u201ctrue\u201d level of depression remains the same in the population. Lastly, future studies are needed to empirically examine the origin of these trends.\nCountervailing effects of the time period were found by the current study, with comparatively smaller decreases in depressive symptoms across time period, as compared to the comparatively larger increases among younger birth cohorts. This result is in line with some previous studies, in which decreasing or stagnating trends in depressive symptoms over time were found, especially among older adults (Bretschneider et\u00a0al., 2018; Kucera et\u00a0al., 2020; Zivin et\u00a0al., 2013) and mirrors the general trend toward\nmore physically healthy aging often found in developed countries (Chatterji et\u00a0al., 2015). The current study suggests that those prior findings might be caused by a synergetic effect of decreasing depressive symptoms across time periods and decreasing depressive symptoms for older birth cohorts born until about 1945. At the same time, numerous previous studies also suggested increasing trends in depressive symptoms across time in comparatively younger adults (e.g., Keyes et\u00a0al., 2019). This likely reflects the increases in depressive symptoms among more recent born birth cohorts after 1945. However, as already discussed, the present study cannot estimate the causal reasons for the observed trends, which should be explored by future analyses.\nSeveral limitations have to be taken into account when interpreting the results. The sample did not include institutionalized older adults and thus likely underestimates the true level of depression in the population. Similarly, I only studied depressive symptom trends in Germany, and future studies are needed to explore to what extent these results can be generalized to other European and international samples. Second, although I used one of the popular approaches to analysing birth cohort differences with the HAPC model, I acknowledge that there is a healthy discussion regarding the appropriate way to analyze age-period-cohort differences (Bell, 2020). Future studies might use other techniques suggested in the literature to validate the results (Fu, 2018; Yang & Land, 2013). Specifically, simulation studies suggest that the cohort effect might be underestimated by the methods used in the current study, which further emphasizes the need to validate the observed trends (Luo & Hodges, 2020). Similarly, age-period-cohort models cannot provide information on the causal reasons for the observed trends and future studies are needed that explicitly analyze potential explanatory factors for the observed generational rise in depressive symptoms. Finally, only a self-report measure of depression, the CES-D 15 was used. As discussed above, self-report measures might be susceptible to cognitive biases and as such future studies might employ other, potentially more objective indicators of depression (Marsden & Wright, 2010)."
