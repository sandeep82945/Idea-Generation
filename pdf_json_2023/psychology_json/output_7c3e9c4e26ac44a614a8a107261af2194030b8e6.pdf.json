    "abstractText": "Two diphenyl formamidine ligands, four dirhodium(II,II) complexes, and three axially modified low-valent dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers were synthesized and evaluated as anticancer agents against the A2780, A2780cis, and OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cell lines. The dirhodium(II,II) complexes show moderate cytotoxic activity in the tested tumor cell lines, with acetate and methyl-substituted formamidinate compounds displaying increased cytotoxicity that is relative to cisplatin in the A2780cis cisplatin resistant cell line. Additionally, methyland fluorosubstituted formamidinate complexes showed comparable and increased cytotoxic activity in the OVCAR-3 cell line when compared to cisplatin. The low-valent metallodendrimers show some activity, but a general decrease in cytotoxicity was observed when compared to the precursor complexes in all but one case, which is where the more active acetate-derived metallodendrimer showed a lower IC50 value in the OVCAR-3 cell line in comparison with the dirhodium(II,II) tetraacetate.",

            "text": "The success of cisplatin and related platinum-based chemotherapies in the treatment of cancer has pioneered the development and study of various inorganic and organometallic compounds, such as cytotoxic agents [1]. Metal-containing compounds have favorable chemical properties that are not exhibited by purely organic compounds, including multiple oxidation states, various geometries, and the ability for conjugation to bioactive ligands, possibly leading to multiple modes of action, which may be exploited for use in medicinal chemistry [2]. The resistance displayed by malignancies toward platinum(II) metallodrugs, coupled with the inherent lack of specificity of platinum-containing compounds has become prevalent in recent times [3]. To circumvent the undesirable shortcomings of known platinum-based chemotherapies, the development of new metal-based drugs containing other platinum group metals has become increasingly prominent [4]. Consequently, potential drug leads containing metals, such as rhenium, ruthenium and rhodium, have been at the forefront for development as anti-tumor agents with some success [5\u201312]. The documented activity of mononuclear rhodium complexes showing cytotoxicity against both cisplatin-resistant and sensitive cell lines is evident in the literature [13]. Among the various strategies to improve selectivity, multinuclearity is often used to selectively target cancer cells through a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [14]. The enhanced metabolic requirements for the proliferation of cancer cells allows for the uptake of larger molecules when compared to\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2671. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062671 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nhealthy cells. This is exemplified by the trinuclear platinum-based compound BBR3464 showing an increased response toward cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer [15]. Dendritic structures incorporating metal complex-based motifs are well reported, with general trends such as enhanced cytotoxicity and selectivity being observed for polynuclear compounds over their mononuclear analogs [16\u201320]. Dirhodium(II,II) complexes are of interest in this field of research and possess unique physicochemical properties, such as a metal\u2013metal bonded binuclear core, the presence of vacant axial sites for further ligand occupancy, and the accessibility of a wider range of oxidation states when compared to mononuclear rhodium complexes [21]. In the decades following their inception, dirhodium(II,II) complexes have shown in vitro antiproliferation effects in cell lines, such as leukemia L1210, as well as sarcoma 180 and P388 [22\u201327]. Initially, it was demonstrated that dirhodium(II,II) acetate complexes bind covalently to DNA nucleotide bases via the axial binding site in a manner akin to cisplatin, alluding to a similar mechanism of action [28,29]. Additionally, their structural diversity, electronics, and axial site reactivity allow for binding to a variety of biologically relevant enzymes and molecules that are responsible for intracellular detoxification, such as glutathione [30]. Furthermore, the nature of the bridging ligands has been reported to affect the means of DNA interaction. For example, ligands bearing extended \u03c0-electron systems have been shown to bind to DNA via intercalation [31]. The incorporation of bridging ligands containing nitrogen donor atoms in homoleptic dirhodium (II,II) formamidinate complexes has also been explored utilizing Yoshida ascites sarcoma cells, which has been observed with no appreciable cytotoxic effects [32]. Furthermore, an in vivo study showed no appreciable general toxicity in rats at a dosage of 150 mg per test subject\u2019s unit bodyweight in Kg [32]. To this end, heteroleptic dirhodium(II,II) complexes bearing formamidinate and acetate ligands have been shown to decrease toxicity toward healthy cells in comparison with homoleptic dirhodium(II,II) acetate complexes [33,34]. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new axially modified low-valent dirhodium (II,II) metallodendrimers containing dirhodium(II,II) complexes, bound via a single axial coordination site. The dendritic structure may allow for increased selective cellular uptake, alongside a multivalent drug delivery approach. The synthesized compounds were evaluated as potential antitumor agents against the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line, the cisplatin resistant A2780cis human ovarian cancer cell line, and the highly prolific OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cell line. These were then compared to the toxicity profiles of ligands (1, 2); the precursor complexes containing acetate and formamidinate bridging ligands (3\u20136); and the platinum-based drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin. The results reported in this work suggest that structural modifications of the dendritic molecules are required to improve their solubility in the biological medium. This would allow for accurate selectivity studies against healthy non-tumorigenic cell lines."

A low temperature NMR could not be attained to investigate the nature of the signals due to the observed precipitation of complex 8 from the solution and fusion temperature of DMSO.

This was observed to shift from 8.47 ppm, as was previously observed in the ligand precursor 7, thereby implicating the binding between the rhodium atom and the pyridyl nitrogen.\nFigure 2.

Despite the precipitation, the expected number of the signals and integration that was observed in the 1H NMR spectra for compounds 9 and 10 of the dendritic core was relative to the aromatic formamidinate signals. As in compound 8, downfield shifts are observed in the pyridyl doublet signals, supporting the mono-axial site functionalization of the proposed compounds 9 and 10 (Figure 4). The lack of an observed coalescence and broadening of the signals in the spectra of formamidinate complexes (9, 10), relative to those observed for acetate compound 8, was attributed to the steric influence of the ligated diphenylformamidinate moeities that was present on the conformational arrangements of the dendritic arms, which was coupled with the enhanced solubility exhibited by complexes 9 and 10.

The 13C-NMR spectrum obtained for 9 in benzene-d6.\nAdditionally, the infrared spectra obtained for complexes 8\u201310 shows a shift in the pyridyl C=N absorption band from the 1610 cm\u22121 to 1586 cm\u22121 region, further supporting the coordination of the pyridyl nitrogen atom to the dirhodium core in each case (Figures S1\u2013S3, Supplementary Materials). The weak band observed in the 3400 cm\u22121 regions in the IR spectra was ascribed to the secondary amine N-H stretching mode, thereby supporting a selective binding of the pyridyl nitrogen atom over the amine moiety. The positive-ion high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) for complexes 8\u201310 reveals the base peaks corresponding at m/z = 1768.4221, m/z = 2072.4199, and m/z = 1294.4554, thereby corresponding to the [M + Na]+, ([M + 4(CH2Cl2) + 2K]2+) and ([M + 3Na]3+) ions for complexes 8, 9, and 10, respectively. The complex fragmentation patterns observed in the mass spectra of complexes 8 and 10 were attributed to the macromolecular monodispersed nature of the dendritic structures, allowing for multiple points of fragmentation upon ionization (Figures S4\u2013S6). Meanwhile, the low signal-to-noise ratio observed for 10 was attributed to the low solubility of the compound upon ESI analysis. The encapsulation of solvent molecules within the structure that were seen for complex 9 has previously been reported for dendrimers [37,38]. The speculated encapsulation of the solvent was confirmed by a thermogravimetric analysis of complex 9 (Figure S7), whereby a percentage loss of 1.453% was observed between 32 and 110 \u25e6C, thus corresponding to the loss of one encapsulated DCM molecule. The loss at 120 \u25e6C may be attributed to conformational rotations of the dendritic arms, which results in the liberation of the remaining DCM molecules. The accompanying color change observed at this temperature was ascribed to a certain degree of decomposition, which was taking place until full decomposition occurred at around 400 \u25e6C. The stability of the compounds in solution was evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy in DMSO at an ambient temperature (20\u201325 \u25e6C) over a 48 h period. No observable change in the electronic spectra (Figure S8) was noted for complex 8 in DMSO, thus supporting the spectral data and the stability of the Rh-Npyridyl bond under these conditions. Although changes in the spectra for complexes 9 and 10 were observed, the comparison of these to the precursor complex spectra suggest a DMSO adduct formation in the first 2 h, followed by a stable species that was formed over the remainder of the elapsed time in the study (Figures S9 and S10)."

The cytotoxicity was determined using an MTT assay over a concentration range of 0.1\u2013100 \u00b5M, as previously described [39]. Serial dilutions were carried out in such a way as to obtain the final concentration of compounds over the 0.1\u2013100 \u00b5M concentration range with corresponding DMSO concentrations of 0.016\u20131%. Exceeding the maximal DMSO content of 1% is unfavorable, since higher DMSO concentrations may have an impact on the cell survival and influence that the IC50 values possess for the compounds [40]. Cisplatin and carboplatin were tested in parallel in the same concentration range for both ligands (1, 2), dirhodium complexes (3\u20136), and metallodendrimers (8\u201310). These results are presented in Table 1 and Table S1. The sigmoidal dose\u2013response curves (Supplementary Materials, Figures S11\u2013S13) depicting the relationship between the survival rate and the concentration of the compounds yielded half maximal inhibitory concentrations or IC50 values (95% confidence interval). The solubility of the compounds did not allow a testing of over 100 \u00b5M, and the calculation of the quantitative IC50 value was not possible for the selected compounds. The testing of 7 was not carried out due to a negligible solubility in the medium, which is required for biological evaluation. Nonetheless, the absorbance values and, hence, the cell survival showed a continuous leaning decrease. Therefore, the linear regression was applied in order to analyze the dose\u2013effect relationship. Furthermore, the statistical significance (p value < 0.05) of the calculated hillslope clearly demonstrated a cell growth inhibitory tendency in the studied concentration range; this was observed for all compounds in the A2780 cell line (Supplementary Materials, Figure S14, Table S1).\nThe compounds show a similar outcome in A2780cis and OVCAR-3 cell lines, with few exceptions: no changes were caused by the application of ligand 1 and complex 9 to the A2780cis and OVCAR-3 cell lines, nor by ligand 2 and complex 10 in the OVCAR-3 cell line. A pronounced increase in potency toward the A2780 cell line was observed for 2 with an IC50 value of 43.68 \u00b5M, although this result was approximately 6 times lower when compared to that of cisplatin (7.60 \u00b5M). Ligand 1 showed no appreciable activity in the tested concentration range in the A2780 cell line, and the IC50 values for ligands 1 and 2 in the A2780cis and OVCAR-3 cell lines could not be determined in the tested concentration range of 0.1\u2013100 \u00b5M, which serves as a confirmation by the linear regression (see Table S1). Inhibitory effects of the acetate-containing complexes (3 and 4)\u2014with IC50 values of 45.65 and 52.57 \u00b5M, respectively\u2014were found to favor the methyl-substituted complex (3). Interestingly, the application of complex 3 to the A2780cis cell line shows a marginally\nenhanced activity (43.25 \u00b5M) when compared to the A2780 cell line, as well as showed a greater cytotoxicity when compared to cisplatin (80.49 \u00b5M) or carboplatin (89.37 \u00b5M). Complex 4 showed no appreciable activity in the A2780cis cell line at the tested concentration range; however, its cytotoxicity was comparable to that of cisplatin, which was observed in the OVCAR-3 cell line. These results agree with previous literature findings, in which the interaction between dirhodium(II,II) complexes and DNA may allow for a growth inhibition through multiple pathways [32,33]. Complex 5 shows the greatest inhibitory effects of all tested compounds against the A2780, A2780cis, and OVCAR-3 cell lines with IC50 values of 36.18, 36.24, and 27.71 \u00b5M, respectively, thus exceeding cisplatin in all but the A2780 cell line. Notably, complex 5 was more active in the A2780, A2780cis, and OVCAR-3 cell lines than was observed for carboplatin, which is a commonly used drug in the treatment regime for ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancers such as OVCAR-3 are fast growing, spread throughout the peritoneal cavity and account for 90% of ovarian cancer diagnoses [41]. In this regard, the increased potency demonstrated by complex 5 in the OVCAR-3 cell line is encouraging. A substantial increase in efficacy across all cell lines when compared to the precursor ligand 1 was also observed, thereby suggesting a strong positive influence of the bimetallic center in this case. Complex 6 showed an increased cytotoxicity when compared to the precursor ligand 2 in the A2780 and OVCAR-3 cell lines, but an overall lower activity when compared to cisplatin. Generally, the coordination of complexes 3\u20136 to the tripyridyl scaffold 7 results in a lower cell growth inhibition, which is due to the previously observed solubility characteristics in the medium that are required for cytotoxic evaluation. Growth inhibition was observed in the application of the methyl-substituted compounds 8 and 10 in the A2780 cell line with observed IC50 values of 64.82 and 97.11 \u00b5M, respectively. This indicated that the terminally bound dirhodium(II,II) acetate moiety is a more potent agent than dirhodium(II,II) formamidinate analogs. Complex 8 shows the greatest cytotoxicity of the metallodendrimers in the A2780 and OVCAR-3 cell lines with IC50 values of 64.82 and 69.05, respectively. This suggests a positive antiproliferative effect in the OVCAR-3 cell line by binding complex 3 to the termini of the dendritic scaffold, which was not seen for complexes 9 and 10. This may be due to a mechanism of action where an additive effect of the suitable physico-chemical properties of the acetate-bearing compound 8 results in enhanced activity when compared to complex 3."

A2780 and A2780cis cells were acquired from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures through Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, while the OVCAR-3 cell line was from American Type Culture Collection (Manasses, VA, USA, acquired through LGC Standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany). The A2780 and A2780-cis cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 cell culture media, which were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; OVCAR-3 and 20% fetal bovine serum; and 0.01 mg/mL insulin from a porcine pancreas (all media and supplements were from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). For cytotoxicity testing, the cells were seeded on 96-well Nunclon Delta surface assay plates (from Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA); in addition to in wells containing 190 \u00b5L cell suspensions. The compounds 1\u20136 and 8\u201310 were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to obtain 10 mM stock solutions, and serial dilutions were prepared using a 0.01M PBS solution in order to obtain concentrations in the range of 2\u20132000 \u00b5M. Cisplatin and carboplatin were received from Actavis, through Sindan-Pharma Srl, Bucharest, Romania. The platinum-based drugs were diluted in a physiological serum, and serial dilutions were made in PBS to obtain the same concentration range as for Rh2(II,II) compounds at 2\u20132000 \u00b5M. For testing, each well containing cells was treated with the respective compound in a proportion of 1:20 (compound: cell culture media) in order to obtain a final concentration range of 0.1\u2013100 \u00b5M for the compounds in the cell culture media. In every well, a 10\u00b5L compound was pipetted and the plates were incubated for 24 h, in triplicate. Untreated cells were used as a reference for 100% cell growth. In addition, the cell culture media without cells were used as a blank, and wells filled with cell culture media and the serial dilutions of each compound were used as color control; three independent measurements were performed. To assess the cytotoxicity of the compounds, the colorimetric MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduction assay was performed [39]. Briefly, the cell culture media was gently removed from the 96-well plates. The wells were filled with 100\u00b5L of 1mg/mL MTT solution (MTT reagent and its solvent, the Hank\u2019s media were purchased from Sigma Aldrich) and the samples were incubated for 1 h. The MTT solution was removed and in each well 150 \u00b5L DMSO was dispensed. After a short (5\u201310 min) shaking on a shaking platform with incubation, the optical density of each well was measured at 570 nm on a microplate reader. Furthermore, the absorbance data were implemented using GraphPad Prism 5 software (from GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA) to obtain nonlinear, sigmoidal curves, and IC50 values. Additionally, the linear regression of each dose\u2013response dataset was also analyzed in the 95% confidence interval."

The dirhodium compounds 2\u20136 show a cytotoxicity that was greater than or comparable to carboplatin in the A2780 cell line; none of which, however, exceeded the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in this cell line. Compounds 3 and 5 showed an approximate two-fold increase in cytotoxicity in the A2780cis cell line when compared to cisplatin and carboplatin, whereas compounds 4 and 5 show the highest antiproliferative effect of the synthesized compounds in the OVCAR-3 cell line. Generally, the results for dendritic complexes (8\u201310) show a decrease in cytotoxicity when compared\nto the bimetallic precursor complexes, with acetate-containing metallodendrimer (8) displaying the greatest antiproliferative effect for the macromolecular series of compounds. Compound 5 shows promising cytotoxicity against highly proliferative human ovarian tumor cell lines in vitro, having a comparable to, or greater, activity in comparison to the tested platinum-based drugs, with similar efficacy observed across all tested cell lines. Further investigations are underway to improve on the design strategy and fine-tuning of the physicochemical properties toward the investigation of the mechanisms of action on which these complexes exert their influence, thus their selectivity for cancer cells over healthy cells may then be determined.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28062671/s1, Figures S1\u2013S3: Infrared spectra obtained for compounds 8\u201310; Figures S4\u2013S6: HR-ESI MS spectra for compounds 8\u201310; Figure S7: TGA trace obtained for compound 9.
