    "abstractText": "Over a couple of decades, space junk has increased rapidly, which has caused significant threats to the LEO operation satellites. A mitigating measure should be taken to protect the LEO space environment. An Active Debris Removal (ADR) concept continuously evolves for space junk removal. One of the ADR methods is Space Robotics, whose function is to chase, capture and de-orbit the space junk. This paper presents the development of an on-ground space robotics facility in the TCS Research for on-orbit refueling and debris capture experiments. A Hardware-in-Loop Simulation (HILS) system will be used for integrated system development, testing, and demonstration. HILS is the most effective and vital system to test the on-orbit docking mechanism\u2019s reliability, usability, and safety. The HiLS test facility of TCS Research Lab will use two Universal Robot(UR)5e and UR10 manipulators in which one manipulator is attached to the robotic-RG2 gripper, and the other is attached to a force-torque sensor named Hexa-E Onrobot and with a scaled mock-up satellite model. The first UR5 manipulator will be mounted on a 7-axis linear rail and contain the docking probe. First UR5 manipulator with the suitable gripper has to interface its control boxes. The grasping algorithm was run through the ROS interface line to demonstrate and validate the On-orbit and Debris removal operation. The manipulator will be mounted with LIDAR and a Real sense camera to visualize the mock-up model, find the target model\u2019s pose and rotational velocity estimation, and a gripper that will move relative to the target model. The other manipulator has the UR10 control, providing rotational and random motion to the mock-up satellite, enabling a dynamic simulator fed by forcetorque data. The dynamic simulator is fed up with the orbit propagator model SGP4, which will provide the orbiting environment to the target model. For the simulation of the docking and grasping of the target model, a 7-axis linear rail of a 6-meter setup is still in the procurement process. Once reaching proximity, the grasping algorithm will be launched to capture the target model after reading the random motion of the mock-up satellite model. The HILS system proposed in this paper helps develop on-orbit servicing (OOS) like repairing, upgrading, transporting, rescuing technologies, on-orbit refueling, and berthing and debris removals.",

            "text": "The growth of spacecraft launches has increased substantially over the past couple of decades, and the statistics results indicated an average of more than one hundred satellites were launched annually. Most spacecraft launches have accomplished their mission goals, but some experienced failures and irregularities.1 In the past, a launcher failure is the most typical failure of the spacecraft. However, an on-orbit failure has recently overtaken launch failures, resulting in billions of dollars lost in space organizations like NASA, ESA, ISRO, etc. Eventually, all launched satellites run out of fuel after their endof-life (EOL) span, which causes the formation of space junks/debris at different orbit regions.\nIn recent decades, the spaces junks (residual of the spent satellite, rocket staging, body and booster, junk particles from the collision of debris objects) have increased drastically in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region, which can cause a severe threat to the operation satellite at LEO orbit. Several works of literature have shown that servicing, like repairing, refueling, upgrading, etc., of damaged spacecraft in flight is cost-effective and extends the existing satellite\u2019s life span. In addition, the post-mission removal of the spent satellite, rockets staging, etc., will keep the operational satellite in a favorable orbital environment for upcoming space missions. An OnOrbit Servicing (OOS) has become instrumental in increasing the life span of many satellites, thereby helping in the sustainable utilization of space orbits.\nSah et. al. 1 37th Annual Small Satellite Conference\nar X\niv :2\n30 6.\n03 78\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 3\nJ un\n2 02\n3\nTo do the servicing of damaged spacecraft, NASA realized, as early as the 1980s, the significance of the robotics on-orbit servicing activities to protect assets in space.2 It was termed Space Robotics, which is the combination of spacecraft and robotics manipulators. Recently, Roshan et al. have developed a spacecraft with single/dual manipulators, which are termed a \u201cDebris Chaser Satellite\u201d345 whose primary function is to chase, capture, and de-orbit6 the space junks to a shallow earth orbit. However, the debris chaser satellite can also be used for servicing applications. Autonomous control of space robots for precise in-orbit operations (satellite servicing, active debris removal, etc.) has become critical for long-term sustainable use of the Earth\u2019s orbits due to a multi-fold increase in space debris. However, the spacecraft-manipulator couple system produces non-linearity to space systems\u2019 complex control problem. Manipulator motion induces reaction forces and moments on the satellite, which disturbs its position and attitude, affecting the end-effector\u2019s pose. Therefore, the dynamic interaction between the manipulator and the base satellite must be considered while designing a control law for such space manipulators.\nThe space robot consists of three different modes of approach;7\n1. Free Flying space robot:\nIt refers to the class of satellite-manipulator systems wherein the cold gas thrusters/jets facilitate89 a stabilized and controlled base for robotic manipulator motion. The fixed base is favorable for trajectory formation of manipulators, however, at the expense of fuel consumption and restricted workspace.\n2. Free Floating space robot:\nIt refers to the class of satellite-manipulator systems wherein the combined system momentum remains conserved due to the absence of an external force or torque in the terminal phase when the arm is deployed to reach the target. Only the manipulator arm motion is actively controlled in a Free Floating configuration. At the same time, the satellite base is left uncontrolled to freely translate and rotate as per the forces and moment acted upon by the arms motion. In contrast, there is no fuel consumption at all.\n3. Rotation Floating Space Robot:\nRotation floating space robots10 are a comparatively newer approach wherein the base satellite attitude is controlled using actuators like reaction wheels (RW) which preserve the system\u2019s momentum and control the manipulator\u2019s arms. The satellite base is still left free to translate. This approach causes fuel consumption in a limited amount.\nThese three approaches are primarily used for the manipulation in orbit for OOS applications. Ground-based experiments will be required to verify and explore the capability, feasibility, and limitations of the critical trajectory planning and control algorithm before servicing the satellite i.e., the space robot is launched for OOS missions. A ground-based experiment helps us to ensure that the space robot can successfully implement the mission tasks like orbit capturing and docking operations. Hence, setting up a suitable ground-based experiment system for a space robot performing fine manipulation becomes essential.\nThe ground-based experiment for the evaluation of planning and control algorithms for space robots is challenging in two ways;\n1. the coupled space robot system needs to be permitted to move in the 6DOF system, and\n2. the effect of gravity cannot be canceled as space considers the micro-gravity environment.\nOver the last decade, there have been five methods to emulate the micro-gravity environment on the ground;11\n1.

The first four methods to emulate the microgravity environment are expensive and timeconsuming. Therefore most of the space research organizing focuses on the hybrid method, which is the mathematical model combined with the mechanical model. The trajectory of the space robot in a micro-gravity environment is calculated using the gravity-based mathematical model. Then the mechanical model is forced to move according to the calculation. A precise dynamic model can emulate the behaviors of a space robot coupled system. The hybrid method is relatively cheap and can be set up using ground-based robots like UR5, UR10, and KUKA.\nOrganizations like NASA, ESA, DLR (German Aerospace Center), Surrey Space Center, and JAXA have set up several research facilities to execute the ground-based experiment to verify the space robotics operation for OOS applications. The DLR Robotics Laboratory has set up a European Proximity Operations Simulator (EPOS), which consist of two KUKA robot in which; one is used for simulating target and the other for simulation chaser, linear rail, sun simulator, and sensors. The EPOS facility can be used to test the autonomous GNC for rendezvous and\nSah et. al. 2 37th Annual Small Satellite Conference\nmission inspection12.13 Similarly, the STAR lab of the University of Surrey has developed the Orbital robotics testbed, which is used to simulate the 6DOF manipulation by using multiple robotics arms or airbearing tables. Their setup has also considered orbital disturbance and tries to grasp the 3D printed mock-up model using a range of control modes from tele-operation to full autonomy.14\nIn this paper, we have established on ground Hardware In Loop Simulation (HiLS) facility to explore and verify the capability of the space robot to execute fine manipulation, non-cooperative target capturing, and the end phase of docking. This HiLS facility is the first space robotics laboratory in India set up by TCS Research India and will be used for future ISRO OOS missions. Using groundbased robots, a hybrid simulation approach has been used to verify our trajectory and control algorithms. These verified algorithms can be used for upcoming missions.\nThe rest of the paper has been organized into the following sections; Section: Hybrid Simulation Method describes the simulation and hardware concept of dynamics emulation of chaser-target motion using the Pybullet and URs manipulator. The section: Space Robotics Laboratory(SRL) explains about objective, lab layout, and the different SRL components required for on-ground experiment systems. In the section: Results and Discussion, the initial results of the Hardware-in-loop System (HiLS)of URs replicating the chaser\u2019s and target\u2019s motion were explained. The last section deals with the conclusion and future works that will be executed in the coming days by considering the multiple scenarios of space rendezvous and docking in a more real-time consideration."

            "text": "Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the PyBullet environment created to simulate the chaser-target space robot. A red target is being tracked by a Rotation Floating space robot15 with a UR5 manipulator on-board it. Three orthogonal reaction wheels are mounted on the space robot to control the attitude of the base satellite. The objective is to use a two-layered MPC-based control16 architecture that controls the motion of the satellite base and UR5 manipulator to enable it to reach the moving target. After that, the target will be grabbed using an impedance controller, followed by bringing the arm (with the target) back to the initial configuration. PyBullet simulations have been performed, and the results are shown later. An orbital environment1718\nneeds to be incorporated with the Pybullet environment by using STK tools which will be part of the future work.\nThe dynamic equation of the space robot is generally expressed in the following form;[ Hb Hbm HTbm Hm ] [ x\u0308b \u0398\u0308s ] + [ cb cm ] = [ Fb \u03c4m ] + [ JTb JTm ] (1)\nwhereas\nHb \u2208 R6x6 and Hm \u2208 Rnxn are the inertial matrices of the base and the manipulator\u2019s arm;\nHbm \u2208 R6xn is the couple inertial matrix; cb \u2208 R6 and cm \u2208 R6 are the velocity-dependent\nnon-linear terms for base and arm;\nFb, Fe, \u03c4m \u2208 R6 are force and torques on the centroid of the base and exert on the manipulator\u2019s hand, torque on the manipulator\u2019s joints.\nx\u0307e = Jbx\u0307b + Jm\u0398\u0307s (2)\nWhereas, Jb and Jm are the Jacobian matrices dependent on the motion of the base and the manipulator; x\u0307b andx\u0307e are the absolute velocity of the space base and end-effectors. \u0398s is the joint angle of the space manipulator.\nSince no external forces and torques are acting on the free-floating system of the space robot, the linear and angular momentum is considered zero initially. Therefore, the system momentum keeps zero according to the conservation law. The equation of such a free-floating space robot is given as\nHbx\u0307b +Hbm\u0398\u0307s = 0 (3)\nSah et. al. 3 37th Annual Small Satellite Conference\nHence, the absolute velocity of the space robot can be solved from equation 3 as\nx\u0307b = \u2212H\u22121b Hbm\u0398\u0307s = H\u0398\u0307s (4)\nSubstituting the value of the absolute velocity of space base for equation 4 to 3, the following relationship can be formed,\nx\u0307e = (Jm \u2212 JbH\u22121b Hbm)\u0398\u0307s = J \u2217(\u03a6b,\u0398s)\u0398\u0307s (5)\nWhereas, J\u2217(\u03a6b,\u0398s) is the Generalized Jacobian Matrix (GJM)\nAnd by GJM, the manipulator\u2019s hand can be controlled by resolved motion rate or acceleration control in the inertial space.\nThe simulations are followed by hardware experiments to validate the results obtained from PyBullet. Towards this end, a Hardware-in-the-loop-based Hybrid approach is followed, the most commonly used approach for space robots. Figure 2 shows the philosophy behind the hardware experiments. The motion of the chaser end-effector and the target is calculated concerning a frame attached to the base of the chaser satellite. The transformed 6 DOF motion is replicated on two Universal Robot arms: Chaser on a UR5 arm and target motion on the UR10 arm. The actual motion of the hardware arms is then fed back to the PyBullet environment as real-time feedback. The 6 DOF motion is transformed back into the inertial frame, which is then acted upon by the proposed controller. The cycle repeats until and unless the chaser arm (UR5) reaches the target arm (UR10). In the preliminary results, independent motions of the UR5 (chaser motion) and UR10 (target motion) were executed in sync with the PyBullet environment in real time. Both arms produced perfect results and reproduced the PyBullet results. In the future, they will be run together to complete the pipeline executed in PyBullet."

Following the hybrid method philosophy described above, hardware experiments are independently conducted to replicate the chaser arm motion on a UR5 arm and target motion on a UR 10 arm. As explained, these motions concern a frame attached to the base satellite in the PyBullet environment. The feedback is obtained from the arms and given to the PyBullet to get the MPC command and update the system\u2019s dynamics. Figure 12 shows the motion of the UR5 arm while replicating the chaser motion leading to the plot 13 obtained. In figure 12 a., the initial hardware motion of the UR5 manipulator is shown, which shows the deviation from the Pybullet simulation command. As the chaser motion proceeds, the UR5 starts following the trajectory similar to the Pybullet simulation, shown in figure 12b. and figure 12c.

It was found that the UR5 is reaching the target point similar to the Pybullet trajectory path with slight deviation caused by the time latency, hardware friction, etc.\nFigure 13 shows the motion of the UR5 arm replicating the chaser arm motion. Solid lines are the actual trajectories of the UR5 arm, while dotted lines are the trajectories computed by the MPC, which are given as commands to the UR5 robot. It can be seen that the chaser can follow the commanded trajectory with good precision.\nFigure 14 shows the motion of the UR10 arm while replicating the chaser motion leading to the plot 15 obtained. In figure 14 a., the initial hardware motion of the UR5 manipulator is shown, which shows the deviation from the Pybullet simulation command. As the target motion proceeds, the UR10 follows the trajectory similar to the Pybullet simulation, shown in figure 14 b. and figure 14 c.

TCS Research, India\u2019s first space robotics laboratory, has developed the space robotics lab to execute the proximity rendezvous and docking process. Numerous objective has been set up that will be implemented in the space robotics lab. A hybrid simulation approach has been utilized to emulate the micro-gravity environment on the ground with minimum cost. This approach has been promising because free base motion will be captured in a simulation environment like Pybullet, and the manipulators will mimic the chaser\u2019s and target\u2019s motion in hardware. UR5e and UR10 manipulators are used to replicate the motion of the chaser and target object. A 3U CubeSat mock-up model is made, which will be mounted on UR10 and provide the tumbling motion to it. The MPC controller extends the arm with the gripper as an end effector toward the target in the desired orientation. Once reaching the proximity, an on-off controller closes the gripper, followed by a PD controller, which brings the arm and the target to their initial orientation. The paper also presents the initial results of replicating the chaser and target motion by UR5 and UR10 manipulators. The results show that the motion of the UR5 and UR10 arms against the motion of the chaser and target obtained from the Pybullets are in the same trajectory line.\nIn future work, we intend to develop the mockup model and mount it at UR10, which will act as a target. A plan to add the force torque sensor will be applied on the end-effector of UR5, i.e., the chaser manipulator, and the values will be recorded while capturing the target objects. The multiple scenarios will be run using an F/T sensor to find efficient values to design the impedance controller for the contact dynamics.
