    "abstractText": "We Haar uniformly generate random states of various ranks and study their performance in an entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) task. In particular, we analyze the efficacy of random two-qubit states in realizing device-independent (DI) QKD. We first find the normalized distribution of entanglement and Bell-nonlocality which are the key resource for DI-QKD for random states ranging from rank-1 to rank-4. The number of entangled as well as Bell-nonlocal states decreases as rank increases. We observe that decrease of the secure key rate is more pronounced in comparison to that of the quantum resource with increase in rank. We find that the pure state and Werner state provide the upper and lower bound, respectively, on the minimum secure key rate of all mixed two qubit states possessing the same magnitude of entanglement under general as well as optimal collective attack strategies.",

In particular, we analyze the efficacy of random two-qubit states in realizing device-independent (DI) QKD. We first find the normalized distribution of entanglement and Bell-nonlocality which are the key resource for DI-QKD for random states ranging from rank-1 to rank-4. The number of entangled as well as Bell-nonlocal states decreases as rank increases. We observe that decrease of the secure key rate is more pronounced in comparison to that of the quantum resource with increase in rank. We find that the pure state and Werner state provide the upper and lower bound, respectively, on the minimum secure key rate of all mixed two qubit states possessing the same magnitude of entanglement under general as well as optimal collective attack strategies.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum mechanics offers safe encryption solution based on fundamental laws (Quantum Cryptography) rather than on computation difficulty (Rivest-ShamirAdleman algorithm) [1]. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the most celebrated protocol in quantum cryptography [2]. There is another approach called postquantum cryptography which uses conventional cryptography to develop alternative public key encryption schemes that are hard even for a quantum computer to break [3]. However, these are secure against the known quantum attacks, whereas security of QKD protocols is, in principle, independent of all future advances in computational power or algorithm.\nThere are two distinct classes of QKD protocols in literature: (a) prepare and measure schemes [4, 5], and (b) entanglement based schemes [6]. In prepare and measure schemes, one party prepares the quantum state and encodes the key information which is then transmitted to the other party who decodes this by performing specific measurements. The security is based on the no-cloning principle [7]. On the other hand, the entanglement based scheme uses the entanglement between the parties to share the key. The security is based on monogamy relations [8, 9].\nDevice imperfections and implementation loopholes in realistic QKD setups can compromise the security of any QKD protocol. However, device-independent QKD protocols based on entanglement remove such concern over imperfections by demonstrating QKD using uncharacterized devices [10, 11]. Security can be checked using classical constraints on correlations between the parties via Bell\u2019s inequalities, though it has been shown recently,\n\u2217 Corresponding author; berasanu007@gmail.com \u2020 shashankg687@bose.res.in \u2021 archan@bose.res.in\nthat violation of Bell-CHSH inequality is not sufficient for secure QKD [12, 13]. Device-independence allows QKD with uncharacterized devices [10, 14\u201317]. Its security has been proven effective against collective attacks [18, 19]. On a different front, device-independent quantum secure direct communication has been recently proposed [20\u201322]. Moreover, several interesting works have been proposed on QKD such as long-distance continuous-variable QKD using optical fiber[23], twinfield QKD[24, 25], reference-frame independent QKD using coherent states[26], and so on.\nMost of the previous works on QKD have considered specific classes of pure states [27]. In experiments, generation and maintenance of perfect pure states is challenging because of environmental decoherence. This results in the natural creation of mixed states that need to be studied to get a complete picture. Two-qubit and qutrit pure states have been thoroughly studied and their performance in entanglement based QKD has been properly analyzed [1, 4\u20136, 28]. On the other hand, limited results are known for mixed states [1, 5] because of multiple state parameters giving rise to multivariate optimisation problems. In this work our aim is to investigate the performance of two-qubit mixed states of different ranks in entanglement based QKD.\nRandom states appear naturally in any experimental system. They not only arise naturally in chaotic processes, but can be generated also in a systematic manner based on randomness in the outcome of quantum measurements [29]. Moreover, against the intuition of observing random behavior, it has been found that random states exhibit some universal features. Examples include the performance of random states for certain communication tasks wherein it has been shown that the dense coding capacity as well as the teleportation fidelity decrease with increase in the rank of randomly generated states [30].\nRandomly generated density matrices [31\u201334] provide a vital tool for studying the trends of typical states in state space. Random states were instrumental in dis-\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n07 46\n4v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 3\nFe b\n20 23\n2 proving a long-standing conjecture in quantum information theory regarding additivity of minimal output entropy [35]. Random states have been also utilized for constructive feedback from a non-Markovian noisy environment [36]. Recently, advantage of employing two random key basis instead of one in device independent(DI)QKD has been demonstrated [37]. Some recent interesting works have been proposed on DI-QKD such as rate\u2013distance limit of DI-QKD[38], photonic demonstration of DI-QKD[39], and so on. The above studies motivate us to explore whether some universal understanding of DI-QKD tasks could be obtained using random states.\nIn the present work we investigate the performance of Haar uniformly generated random states in entanglement based QKD tasks. In particular, we estimate the average secure key rate of states having different ranks in DI-QKD. We first inspect the resourcefulness of the generated random state by quantifying its entanglement and Bell-nonlocality. Our results show that the efficacy of DI-QKD in terms of the secure key rate decreases with the increase of rank of the random state. We further demonstrate that for mixed two-qubit states of any rank possessing the same magnitude of entanglement, the secure key rate of DI-QKD lies between the secure key rate of a pure state and that of a Werner state under general as well as optimal collective attack strategies.\nThe paper is organised in the following way. In Sec.(II), we recapitulate the generation of random states of different ranks with the aim of utilizing them as resource for DI-QKD. In Sec.(III), we present the deviceindependent QKD scenario under consideration and provide our analysis for the resourcefulness of the randomly generated states in terms of Bell-nonlocality, as well as their secure key rates. Finally, we present a summary of our results in Sec.(IV)."

Quantum mechanics offers several non-classical resources that give advantage in different communication tasks. Here, we are interested in the following resources:\nEntanglement: Entanglement of any two-qubit state can be quantified using Negativity and Logarithmic Negativity. Using Eq.(1) to (4) we generate rank-1 to rank-4 random states respectively, and we take partial transpose of those numerically generated states and determine the eigenvalues {\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4}. Logarithmic Negativity is defined as LN = log2(2N + 1) ( where, N(= | \u2211 j \u03bbj |) is Negativity and \u03bbj are the negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed state).\nBell-Nonlocality: For a given random two-qubit state \u03c1AB the maximum value of Bell-Nonlocality that can be achieved for optimal measurements is 2 \u221a \u03bb21 + \u03bb 2 2. Here, \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the two largest singular values of the correlation matrix T (tij = Tr[(\u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3j).\u03c1AB ]) and \u03c3i(j) are the Pauli matrices.\nWe study the performance of randomly generated states in DI-QKD tasks. Our entire calculations and analysis are based on 106 Haar uniformly generated states for each rank. The distribution of states is quantified in terms of the following parameters, as defined below.\nFor a given rank of random state, the normalized distribution of quantum resource is defined as the ratio between the number of states having an amount of QR, i.e., a \u2264 Qc \u2264 b, with Qc being the measure of quantum correlation (entanglement or Bell nonlocality) and the total number of generated random states. Mathematically,\nFnD = Number of states with Qc \u2208 [a, b]\nN0 (5)\nwith N0 being the total number of simulated states. Here, \u2018n\u2019 stands for normalized and \u2018D\u2019 stands for distribution. Qc denotes logarithmic negativity and violation of Bell-CHSH inequlity, in case of entanglement\n3 and Bell-nonlocality, respectively. We divide the range of Qc \u2208 (0, 1] in 10 parts to determine the normalized distribution of quantum resource in simulated random states. The normalized distribution of entanglement is given by\nEnD = Number of states withLN \u2208 [a, b]\nN0 (6)\nSimilarly, the normalized distribution of Bell-nonlocality is defined as\nNnD = Number of states with Bell violation \u2208 [a, b]\nN0 (7)\nThe mean distribution of quantum resource is the ratio between the total number of quantum resourceful state and the total number of generated random states for a fixed rank, given by\nFmD = \u2211\nFnD N0\n(8)\nwhere we have summed over the entire range of a and b. Here, \u2018m\u2019 stands for mean distribution. This quantity represents the fraction of resourceful states. We consider Bell-nonlocal correlations as quantum resource and analyse the mean distribution of the Bell-nonlocality for the randomly simulated random states as follows:\nNmD = Number of states violating Bell-inequality\nN0 (9)\nWe investigate the performance of the random states based on the above mentioned quantities. As observed from previous studies [30], the number of resourceful state decreases as the rank increases. For a particular rank, the fraction of Bell-nonlocal states is lower than that of entangled states, exemplifying the hierarchy of these correlations for a large number of random states [40].\nIn Fig. (1) we plot the normalized distribution of entangled random two-qubit states against Logarithmic negativity. As shown in fig. (1), a large fraction of simulated pure states 85% have higher value of logarithmic negativily (0.5 and above), whereas mixed state have percentage 43.8, 16.6, 5.5 respectively for rank-2, 3, 4 states that have logarithmic negativity 0.5 and above. This implies that as the rank of the state increases, its tendency to have higher value of entanglement decreases. We observed that the quantum resourcefulness of the state decreases as the rank increases. The rest of the paper attempts to answer whether similar behavior is observed in the entanglement based quantum key distribution task. Specifically, we address the effect of rank and QR of the random state on its performance in DI-QKD."

Thus, 0.1 denotes the range (0,0.1].\nBob sharing a bipartite entangled state \u03c1AB in C2\u2297C2 as shown in fig.(2). The two parties want to establish a secure key. For this, each of them perform dichotomic measurements in two mutually unbiased measurement bases (MUBs) and get two outcomes. Alice performs measurement of the observables randomly chosen from the input x \u2208 {0, 1} and gets the outcome a \u2208 {0, 1}. Similarly, Bob randomly chooses the input measurement y \u2208 {0, 1} and gets the outcome b \u2208 {0, 1}. In the post-processing stage, both the parties publicly compare their input measurements and keep only those outcomes for which their inputs are correlated.\nOur protocol is similar to E91 protocol [6]. In a DIQKD protocol, the devices are untrusted. The security is\n4 guaranteed by checking Bell-inequality violation from the measurement statistics. The basic steps of our DI-QKD protocol are as follows:\nQuantum state preparation: Alice generates a pair of entangled photons at her lab (random two-qubit state). She keeps one of the entangled photons and sends the other to Bob\u2019s lab through a quantum channel.\nQuantum measurement: Alice performs measurement of the observable randomly chosen from the input x \u2208 {0, 1} and gets the outcome a \u2208 {0, 1}. Similarly, Bob randomly chooses the input measurement y \u2208 {0, 1} and gets the outcome b \u2208 {0, 1}. During post-processing stage, Alice and Bob keep the cases when their inputs are correlated and discard all other cases.\nBell-inequality violation: Alice and Bob use a fraction of inputs and outputs to ensure the Bell-inequality violation. Those cases are also discarded as the output values are disclosed.\nSecure symmetric key generation: Alice and Bob perform bi-directional error correction on their output values and perform privacy amplification on the corrected keys depending upon the information disclosed (function of the quantum bit error rate (QBER)) and Eve\u2019s attacking strategy. The final keys are the secured symmetric keys. The equality can be verified using a family of universal hash functions.\nLet us determine the secret key rate under different Eve\u2019s attack strategies. In the ideal scenario with no attack, Alice and Bob are left with perfectly identical keys. However, imperfections in state preparation, transmission, measurement processes and eavesdropping can yield differences in their key strings. Alice and Bob can estimate the error rate after comparing a small portion of their secure key. Formally, QBER for a given state \u03c1AB is defined as the average mismatch between the outcomes of Alice and Bob. Let us denote Alice\u2019s two MUBs as {|x\u03b1a \u3009}1a=0 (for \u03b1 \u2208 (0,1)) which are correlated to Bob\u2019s MUBs {|y\u03b1b \u3009}1b=0 (for \u03b1 \u2208 (0,1)). The perfect correlation between Alice and Bob would implies that Alice and Bob perform measurements in the same basis and when Alice\u2019s outcome is |x1a\u3009, Bob\u2019s outcome must be |y1b \u3009. In the non-ideal scenario, there can be non-zero probability of observing |x1a\u3009 in Alice\u2019s subsystem and |y1b \u3009 in Bob\u2019s subsystem where a 6= b. Hence, the QBER which is an average of all these mismatch probabilities can be expressed as\nQBER = 1\n2 1\u2211 \u03b1=0 1\u2211 a6=b=0 \u3008x\u03b1ay\u03b1b |\u03c1AB |x\u03b1ay\u03b1b \u3009\n= 1\n4 (2\u2212 |\u03bb1| \u2212 |\u03bb2|) (10)\nwhere \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the two largest singular values of the correlation matrix T (tij = Tr[(\u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3j).\u03c1AB ]) each of which is bounded from above by 1.\nThe security of entanglement based QKD necessarily requires the demonstration of nonlocal correlations. So, for example, violation of Bell-CHSH inequality is re-\nquired for the security of a DI-QKD since, none of the two parties are trusted in this scenario. Note that the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality is the necessary criterion and not sufficient [12], and hence, there are states that violate the Bell-CHSH inequality but still are not useful for the task of key distribution.\nNote that for a given two-qubit state \u03c1AB the maximum value of Bell-CHSH inequality that can be achieved for optimal measurements is 2 \u221a \u03bb21 + \u03bb 2 2 (say, S). Using Eq.(10) QBER can be written in terms of BellNonlocality (S) as\nQBER = 1\n2\n( 1\u2212 \u221a S2\n16 +\n1 2 |\u03bb1||\u03bb2|\n) (11)\nFrom this above equation we can see that with increase of Bell-Nonlocality (S), the QBER may decrease. The security proof provides a bound on the rate at which Alice and Bob can extract a secure key. The rate at which unconditionally secure key against Eve\u2019s attacks can be extracted is given by\nr(\u03c1ABE) = I(A : B)\u2212 I(A : E) (12)\nwhere, \u03c1ABE is the joint state between Alice, Bob and Eve and I is the Holevo quantity or the quantum mutual information. Usually, the joint state \u03c1ABE is not known to Alice and Bob. So, the key rate is calculated from the QBER estimation after the error correction algorithm and the effective state after the postselection (sifting etc.) is given by\n\u03be(\u03c1AB) = \u2211 u p(u)\u03c1uXY E \u2297 |u\u3009\u3008u| (13)\nThe effective key rate is then,\nr\u0304(\u03be(\u03c1AB)) = I(\u03be(\u03c1AB))\u2212 I\u2032(\u03be(\u03c1AB)) (14)\nwhere, I(\u03be(\u03c1AB)) = \u2211 u p(u)Iu(X : Y ) and I\u2032(\u03be(\u03c1AB)) =\u2211\nu p(u)Iu(X : E). Eve has the freedom to choose any attack, if it creates a state \u03c1AB contained in the set of all bipartite states {\u03c1AB} that are compatible with the measurement outcomes p(a, b|x, y), and have a given reduced state \u03c1A. The minimum secure key rate under such assumption is\nrmin = inf {\u03c1AB} r\u0304(\u03be(\u03c1AB)) (15)\nSince the global state shared between Alice, Bob and Eve are not known, the secure key rate can be determined as a function of the QBER using Eq. (13), (14) and (15).\nSecret key rate under collective attacks(CA): In the case of collective attacks, the eavesdropper applies the same attack on each system of Alice and Bob. Here the minimum secure key rate is a function of QBER(Q) and S. The minimum secure key rate is given by [18]\nrCmin \u2265 1\u2212 h(Q)\u2212 h ( 1 + \u221a\n(S/2)2 \u2212 1 2\n) (16)\n5 Where h is binary entropy and S (= 2 \u221a \u03bb21 + \u03bb 2 2) is the Bell-CHSH violation. Secret key rate under optimal symmetric collective attacks(OSCA): For the case of optimal symmetric collective attacks (attack optimised over the symmetries of the protocol, state and measurements of the communicating parties) by the eavesdropper in entanglement assisted protocols for two-qubit states with two measurement settings per qubit, the minimum secure key rate is given by [19]\nrSmin = 1 + 2(1\u2212Q)log2(1\u2212Q) + 2Qlog2Q (17)\nWe have two separate conditions for the security of a DI-QKD protocol. One being rC(S)min > 0 for a secure key to be distilled while the second is the requirement that the underlying entangled state violates the BellCHSH inequality. While it can be seen that there exist no states with non-vanishing secure key and no Bell-CHSH violation, there do exist states which show Bell-CHSH violation but have vanishing secure key.\nWe now study the behaviour of Bell-nonlocal correlations and minimum secure key rate of random states in DI-QKD. In particular, we first analyse the normalised distribution of Bell-nonlocal correlations (Eq.(5)) as shown in fig. (3). It is seen that the tendency of a random state to achieve large value of Bell-CHSH inequality (2.5 and above) decreases with increasing rank. We find 39.9, 1.9, 0.05, and 0.001 to be the respective percentage of the simulated rank-1, 2, 3 and 4 states that achieve Bell-inequality value of 2.5.\nWe next perform a comparative study of the mean distribution of rC(S) min and Bell-nonlocality of all four ranks. The fraction of random states that have non-zero value of the secure key rate is given by\nFrD = Nr\nN0 (18)\nwhereNr is the number of states that have non-zero value of secure key rate in DI-QKD. Using Eqs. (8) and (18), we plot the respective distributions for all four ranks in Fig.(4).\nIt is seen that the number of randomly simulated states that are Bell-nonlocal as well as the states which provide positive minimum secure key rate decreases with the increase of the rank of the states. The percentages of states that are Bell-nonlocal and give positive secure key rate are 56.8, 8.2, 0.70 and 0.05 for rank-1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively under optimal symmetric collective attacks. Similarly, under collective attacks, the percentages are 36.8, 1.6, 0.04 and 0.001 for rank-1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, under collective attacks. Hence, the number of states giving positive secret key rate under general collective attack are less than that under optimal symmetric collective attacks.\nNote that the respective percentage of Bell-nonlocal states are higher in both cases. This again implies that all Bell-nonlocal states are not suitable for DI-QKD, reinforcing a similar claim in a recent work [12]. Moreover,\nthe rate of decrease in rC(S)min is more prominant than Bell-nonlocality implying that higher rank Bell-nonlocal states are less useful for DI-QKD. The number of states that are Bell non-local and have positive secure key rate under general collective attacks is less in comparison to that in the optimal symmetric collective attack for every rank. This behaviour is expected because in the general collective attack strategy, Eve has the freedom to devise a strategy to maximise mutual information whereas in the optimal symmetric attack, the quantum protocol, state and measurement symmetries put constraints over the strategy of Eve. This constrains Eve\u2019s mutual information and relaxes the secure key rate requirements.\nFor a given rank of the random state, the average secure key rate is given by the ratio of the sum of the secure key rate of the simulated states to the number of states that have non-zero value of the secure key rate, as\nr\u0304 = \u2211 i ri N \u2032\n(19)\nwhere, ri is the secure key rate of the ith state and N \u2032 is the total number of states that have non-zero value of the secure key rate. The average key rate computed using Eq. (19) in DI-QKD under optimal symmetric collective attacks is 0.36, 0.15, 0.09 and 0.07 for rank-1, 2, 3 and 4 states, whereas, under collective attacks, the average key rate is 0.34, 0.14, 0.09 and 0.06 for rank-1, 2, 3 and 4 states, respectively, as shown in Table-(I). The average key rate in both situations where Eve does a general or\n6 optimal collective attack decreases with increasing rank implying that the tendency to generate positive secure key rate decreases with increasing rank. The average key rates in both the attack strategies are nearly the same for a given rank. Our entire calculations are based on 106 Haar uniformly generated states for each case. We find that a large fraction of pure states have positive value of minimum secure key rate and are Bell-nonlocal in comparison with the mixed two-qubit states. This is in accordance with a previous study [36] where it was observed that large fraction of randomly generated mixed states are Bell local states. However, this is in contrast with the observation for teleportation fidelity where it was found that with increasing rank, relative number of states that are local but gives non-classical fidelity increases [30].\nWe observe that on average, the quantum resourcefulness of the randomly generated states decreases with an increase in rank and this could be the reason that the performance of the state also decreases in the DI-QKD task as its rank increases. In particular, pure states perform better than rank-2 states, and in turn, rank-2 states perform better than rank-3 and rank-4 states. Interestingly, there are states of different rank which have the same value of the entanglement, but have different value of the minimum secure key rate. To illustrate this feature, we next perform a comparative study of pure states, general rank-2 states and Werner states. Werner states are the simplest and most studied two-qubit mixed states that help in understanding the effect of noise on maximally entangled Bell states. We determine the minimum secure key rate of these three states in terms of the negativity to show the distinction in performance for the same value of the entanglement.\nAn arbitrary two-qubit pure state in a Schmidt decomposition has the form\n|\u03c8p\u3009 = cos \u03b8 2 |00\u3009+ sin \u03b8 2 |11\u3009 (20)\nwhere, |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 are the eigenstates of the reduced density matrices, and eigenvalues of the local density matrices are cos2 \u03b82 and sin 2 \u03b8 2 . The negativity of the pure state is given by the the square root of the determinant of its reduced density matrix, i.e., sin \u03b82 .\nAny two qubit mixed state of rank-2 can be expressed as,\n\u03c122 = p1|\u03c81\u3009\u3008\u03c81|+ (1\u2212 p1)|\u03c82\u3009\u3008\u03c82| (21)\nwhere, |\u03c81\u3009 = \u03b1|0\u03b71\u3009+\u03b2|1\u03b72\u3009, |\u03c82\u3009 = \u03b1|0\u03b7\u22a51 \u3009+\u03b2|1\u03b7\u22a52 \u3009, |\u03b71\u3009 = a|0\u3009+ b|1\u3009 and |\u03b72\u3009 = a\u2032|0\u3009+ b\u2032|1\u3009 with |\u03b7\u22a51 \u3009 and |\u03b7\u22a52 \u3009 being orthogonal states to |\u03b71\u3009 and |\u03b72\u3009 respectively. The coefficients are taken to be real for simplicity and each of the states are normalised, i.e., a2+b2 = a\u20322+b\u20322 = \u03b12 + \u03b22 = 1 and 0 \u2264 p1 \u2264 1 The entanglement of state \u03c122 in Eq. (21) is given by\nN2 = 1\n2\n[\u221a p21 \u2212 x\u2212 p1 ] , if p1 < 0.5 (22)\nN2 = 1\n2\n[\u221a (1\u2212 p1)2 + x\u2212 (1\u2212 p1) ] , if p1 > 0.5(23)\nwhere, x = 4\u03b12\u03b22(a\u2032b\u2212 ab\u2032)2(2p1\u2212 1). The state parameter p1 of rank-2 state (21) can be expressed in terms of the negativity, as\np1 = N2 \u2212 \u03b12\u03b22(a\u2032b\u2212 ab\u2032)2\nN \u2212 2\u03b12\u03b22(a\u2032b\u2212 ab\u2032)2 , if p1 < 0.5 (24)\np1 = N(N + 1) + \u03b12\u03b22(a\u2032b\u2212 ab\u2032)2\n2\u03b12\u03b22(a\u2032b\u2212 ab\u2032)2 +N , if p1 > 0.5 (25)\nNext, the two qubit Werner state is given by\n\u03c1W = p|\u03c6+\u3009\u3008\u03c6+|+ (1\u2212 p)\n4 I4 (26)\nwhere |\u03c6+\u3009 = 1\u221a 2 (|00\u3009+|11\u3009) with 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1 and I4 being the identity matrix in Hilbert space C2 \u2297 C2. One can take any other maximally entangled Bell state instead of |\u03c6+\u3009 in the expression of the Werner state but the final expression of the minimum secure key rate is same. The negativity of the Werner state is 3p\u221214 .\n7 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\nR-1 R-2 R-3 R-4\nN m D\nRank\nBV PKR(OSCA)\nPKR(CA)\n0 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 0.005 0.006 0.007 0.008\nR-3 R-4\nFIG. 4.

Similarly, we calculate the secure key rate of the pure state and Werner state in terms of the negativity (see Appendix (A) for the respective expressions). In Fig. (5) we plot the minimum secure key rate of the pure state, the general rank-2 state and the Werner state in terms of negativity. From the figure it is clear that states with the same value of the negativity can have different performance (rC(S)min) in the DI-QKD task. It can also be seen that the secure key rate of the rank-2 two-qubit state lies in between the secure key rate of pure state and the Werner state at same value of negativity for both categories of collective attack, i.e.,\nrC(S)min(\u03c1p) \u2265 rC(S)min(\u03c122) \u2265 rC(S)min(\u03c1W ) (27)\nwhere rC(S)min is the minimum secure key rate in our DI-QKD scenario (17).\nWe further find numerically, that rank-3 and rank-4 states also have the minimum secure key rate within the envelope formed by the pure state and the Werner state for the same value of negativity. From Fig.(5) it can be observed that 78.6% of rank-2 states, 39.8% of rank3 states, and 22.7% of rank-4 states have rSmin 0.1 and above under OSCA. Further, from Fig.(6), it follows that 74.6% of rank-2 states, 28.2% of rank-3 states, and 16.4% of rank-4 states have rCmin equals 0.1 or above under CA. All of them are inside the envelope formed by the pure state and the Werner state. Our above analysis can be summarized as following result: Result: The secure key rate of any mixed two qubit\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5\nr S m\nin\nN\nR-2 R-3 R-4 pure state Werner state\nFIG. 5.

            "heading": "IV. CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "Quantum key distribution is set to become an integral part of modern cryptographic applications. In theory, unconditional security has been shown for the prepare and measure as well as the entanglement based schemes. However, in practice, perfect quantum key distribution cannot be achieved due to the presence of different decohering factors, device imperfections and implementation loopholes. Therefore, it is of prime importance to study quantum key distribution protocols using randomly generated states rather than confining to specific set of states, with the aim of obtining a universal perspective.\nIn this work, we have studied the secure key rate of randomly generated two-qubit states of all four ranks in entanglement based QKD. Our analysis is based on numerical results obtained by considering 106 states corresponding to each rank. We first estimate the fraction of states in each rank which are Bell-nonlocal, and the fraction of states which yield positive secure key rate in DIQKD under general as well as optimal collective attacks by Eavesdropper. We show that both Bell-nonlocality\n8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0.34 0.36 0.38 0.4 0.42 0.44 0.46 0.48 0.5\nr C m\nin\nN\nR-2 R-3 R-4 pure state Werner state\nFIG. 6. (Coloronline) Minimum secure key rate of randomly generated rank-2, rank-3, rank-4 states, pure state and the Werner state in DI-QKD are plotted versus the negativity for the case of collective attacks. It is clear that the pure state and the Werner state provides the upper and lower bound respectively, on the minimum secure key rate of mixed twoqubit states in DI-QKD.\nand the minimum secure key rate decrease with the increase of rank in general as well as optimal attack strategy, which is a fundamental feature of such randomly generated states.\nFrom our analysis we have observed that with increasing rank the decrease in secure key rate is more pronounced compared to Bell-CHSH violation. The ratio of the number of states that have quantum resource (entangled as well as Bell-nonlocal) as a function of rank decreases slowly in comparison to the ratio of the number of states that give positive secure key rate as a function of rank. For example, the ratio of the number of rank3 states that are Bell-nonlocal to the number of rank-2 states that are Bell-nonlocal is 0.183, whereas the respective ratio for the number of states that give positive key rate is only 0.085 under optimal symmetric collective attacks and 0.025 under collective attack respectively. It may be noted that quantum resourcefulness is a necessary condition to obtain secure key rate. However, the secure key rate generation is more demanding, and hence, the number of states that give secure key rate is lesser compared to the number of resourceful states.\nOur results further show that states with the same magnitude of entanglement can lead to different values of the secure key rate. We demonstrate that the minimum secure key rate of all two-qubit mixed states is upper bounded by the key rate of the pure state, and lower bounded by the key rate of the Werner state possessing the same value of entanglement quantified by their negativity in both optimal as well as general collective attack strategy. It would be worth studying if the above bounds can be obtained using analytical methods. It might also be interesting to study in future the effect of statistical fluctuations in the number of randomly generated states on the above bounds. Moreover, our present analysis should motivate further studies on the resilience of random states against particular quantum attacks in QKD protocols, as well as under other sources of error such as channel loss and misalignment rate [41].\nA detailed study using random state provides a sourceindependent analysis and establishes an efficiency and performance profile of the quantum task under consideration. For example, the random states can give a precise idea about the performance of higher rank mixed states in tasks like quantum multiparty cryptography [42], secure quantum secret sharing [43], quantum conference key agreement [44], quantum private query [45] and quantum secure direct communication [20, 21]. This in turn should further be useful in understanding the efficiency of such tasks under decoherence. This is so because decoherence can be modelled as a black box whose input may be a random state and the output is some different random state, in order to analyse the efficacy of employing random states in various quantum information protocols."
