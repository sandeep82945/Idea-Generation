    "abstractText": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a significant health concern associated with high mortality. Cofilin plays a crucial role in stress conditions, but its signaling following ICH in a longitudinal study is yet to be ascertained. In the present study, we examined the cofilin expression in human ICH autopsy brains. Then, the spatiotemporal cofilin signaling, microglia activation, and neurobehavioral outcomes were investigated in a mouse model of ICH. Human autopsy brain sections from ICH patients showed increased intracellular cofilin localization within microglia in the perihematomal area, possibly associated with microglial activation and morphological changes. Various cohorts of mice were subjected to intrastriatal collagenase injection and sacrificed at time points of 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Mice suffered from severe neurobehavioral deficits after ICH, lasting for 7 days, followed by a gradual improvement. Mice suffered post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) both acutely and in the chronic phase. Hematoma volume increased from day 1 to 3, whereas ventricle size increased from day 21 to 28. Cofilin protein expression increased in the ipsilateral striatum on days 1 and 3 and then decreased from days 7 to 28. An increase in activated microglia was observed around the hematoma on days 1 to 7, followed by a gradual reduction up to day 28. Around the hematoma, activated microglia showed morphological changes from ramified to amoeboid. mRNA levels of inflammatory [tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory markers [interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 TGF-\u03b2, and arginase I (Arg1)] increased during the acute phase and decreased in the chronic phase. Blood cofilin levels increased on day 3 and matched the increase in chemokine levels. slingshot protein phosphatase 1 (SSH1) protein, which activates cofilin, was increased from day 1 to 7. These results suggest that microglial activation might be the sequel of cofilin overactivation following ICH, leading to widespread neuroinflammation and consequent PSCI.",

            "text": "The global prevalence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was 17.9 million, accounting for 3 million deaths in 2017 [1]. Fifty percent of ICH patients die within the first month, 50% become severely disabled, and surgical intervention is the only treatment option [2\u20134]. Primary injury develops in the first few hours due to hematoma expansion that increases intracranial pressure, leading to herniation and death. Secondary injury is attributed mainly to hematoma expansion and oozing out of blood products in the hematoma. Degradation products of the hematoma, such as hemin, thrombin, and ferrous iron, initiate glial activation, neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and reactive oxygen species formation, thus\nCells 2023, 12, 1153. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12081153 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nCells 2023, 12, 1153 2 of 20\nleading to neurological impairments [3,5]. Microglia, the primary immune cells in the central nervous system, account for 10\u201315% of all cells in the brain [6\u201310], are activated within minutes of brain injury, and persist for a month [11,12]. Different phenotypes of microglia contribute to secondary brain injury and neuroinflammation. The two main microglial phenotypes, M1 and M2, reflect contrasting effects on the inflammatory response [13]; the M1 phenotype enhances inflammation and releases inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), whereas the M2 phenotype inhibits inflammatory responses and is responsible for debris removal and tissue repair. Activated microglia and persistent neuroinflammation contribute to cognitive impairment in such conditions as Parkinson\u2019s disease [14], aging, Alzheimer\u2019s disease [15], ischemic stroke [16,17], hemorrhagic stroke [18], and some psychiatric disorders [19]. Cofilin is an actin-depolymerizing protein that plays a crucial role in the actin filament turnover [20]. Cofilin regulates actin dynamics by maintaining globular actin (G-actin) monomers through depolarizing and severing filamentous actin (F-actin) [20,21]. Multiple kinases and phosphatase processes modulate cofilin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Cofilin is inactivated by LIM and TES kinases through phosphorylation at serine-3 residue (Ser3) but is reactivated by slingshots (SSH), chronophin, and phosphoprotein phosphatases (PP1/PP2A) [22\u201325]. Persistent cofilin activation results in saturated actin filaments and the formation of cofilin\u2013actin rods, which are involved in neurotoxicity, impaired synaptic integrity, and dendritic spine loss [26]. The three major mechanisms for cofilin rods/aggregates include cofilin dephosphorylation, high cofilin/F-actin ratio, and cofilin oxidation [27]. In addition, cofilin is implicated in cell death as activated cofilin translocates to mitochondria and increases mitochondrial permeability, releasing cytochrome C and activating caspases [28,29]. A recent study on four ischemic mouse models showed that cofilin activation leads to cofilin\u2013actin rod formation in neuronal processes [30]. Our previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that cofilin knockdown restores the cell viability [31] and decreases the microglia activation [31,32]. Treatment with a newly synthesized novel cofilin inhibitor (CI) improved neuronal viability and diminished microglial activation and neuroinflammation in an in vitro ICH model [33]. We have also demonstrated that cofilin knockdown by siRNA before ICH reduces neuronal apoptosis, microglial activation, and oxidative stress and improves neurobehavioral deficits [34]. This study investigated cofilin expression, microglial activation, and its morphological alteration in the human ICH brain autopsy specimens. Next, we looked at spatiotemporal cofilin signaling, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation in mice ICH model, which was complemented by the assessment of infarct volume, ventricle size, motor dysfunctions and post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Additionally, we also measured plasma cofilin and cytokine levels."

Under isoflurane anesthesia, a small hole in the skull above the left striatum of each mouse was made, and a Hamilton syringe needle was inserted to deliver the collagenase (0.6 \u00b5L, 0.09 units). The stereotaxic coordinates used for collagenase injection were 1 mm anterior to bregma, 2 mm lateral to the midline, and 3 mm depth from the skull surface. The needle was slowly withdrawn (after 10 min), and the wound was sutured. Mice were placed on a heated pad to recover from the surgery and then transferred to a clean cage. Sham mice received only insertion of the needle without collagenase injection. For the spatiotemporal signaling of cofilin, a total of 126 C57BL/6 male mice (8\u201314-weekold) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and randomly divided into the control group (sham surgery) and the ICH group. Animals were assessed for neurobehavioral parameters [such as, rotarod, grip strength, and neurologic deficit scores (NDS) performed by an expert investigator blinded to the study plan, and findings were recorded for all animals and compared among ICH groups 24 h before the hemorrhagic injury and after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. T-maze was used to evaluate spatial working memory in the acute and chronic periods. Animals were sacrificed at different times, and brain and blood samples were collected to perform various biological assays.

We found that cofilin rods/aggregates were highly expressed around the hematoma in ICH subjects (Figure 1). Cofilin intensity was significantly higher in ICH compared to the controls (t-test; p < 0.0001) (Figure 1A,C). We observed significant differences in microglia counts/field between ICH and controls (t-test; p < 0.0004) (Figure 1B,D). Intracellular cofilin rods/aggregates were localized to activated microglia in the ICH group and associated with microglia morphology changes compared to the control group (Figure 1). Male and female ICH patients showed increased cofilin intensity and microglia count around the hemorrhage compared to control groups (Figure S1). Some patients in the ICH group also showed cofilin rods/aggregates around the nucleus, raising the question of the impact of nuclear cofilin rods on transcription (Figure S2). We next characterized microglial morphological alterations in ICH and control brain sections using FracLac for ImageJ analysis. We observed activated amoeboid microglia around the hematoma area in the ICH group compared to the ramified to de-ramified microglia in the control group. We measured microglial complexity (area and perimeter), span ratio, density, radius length, and branches (processes) features using ImageJ and observed microglial area and perimeter dramatically decreased, but the thickness, span ratio, and max/min radius length were increased significantly in the ICH group compared to the control group (Figure 1E\u2013I). The number of microglia branches, process endpoints, junctions, and slab voxels, as well as the length of the branches, were markedly decreased in the ICH group compared to the control group, indicating that amoeboid microglia were the dominant form following ICH (Figure 1J\u2013N). These results suggest that cofilin and microglia are activated and upregulated around hematomas in the ICH group contributing to secondary injury.\nCells 2023, 12, 1153 6 of 20\nCells 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 19 S1).

Cresyl violet staining showed clearance of hematoma but the concomitant enlargement of the ventricles from day 7 to day 28 after ICH in the hemorrhage side. Interestingly, this difference was also apparent on the contralateral side; we observed a gradual increase in ventricle size (Figure 8A,B,D). H&E staining showed histopathological changes in the hemorrhagic area. The total volume of ipsilateral ventricles, a sign of cerebral atrophy, was significantly larger in ICH mice on days 21 and 28 compared to sham (Figure 8C). The image of the sham group showed that neurons had clear spherical nuclei with abundant cytoplasm. On the hemorrhage side, the staining was light, with loose tissue and damaged nuclei from day 1 to day 28. The number of cells decreased and were swollen with structurally deformed cytoplasm. We observed extensive vacuolization on day 28 around the hemorrhagic area, consistent with cell damage compared with the sham group (Figure 8B). The results indicate that ventricular enlargement possibly occurs due to demyelination and causes brain atrophy and, eventually, chronic cognitive impairment after ICH.

            "text": "In the present study, we investigated the cofilin expression in human ICH autopsy brains and the spatiotemporal signaling of cofilin following ICH in mice. We report for the first-time alterations in cofilin expression and cofilin localization within microglia in brain tissue of human ICH and mouse ICH longitudinal study stretching from day 1 to day 28. We showed that ICH causes motor deficits following ICH, and PSCI is observed in both acute and delayed phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate increased infarct volume from days 1 to 3 and ventricular enlargement after days 21 to 28. We demonstrate that cofilin overactivation on days 1 to 3 correlates with the SSH1 increase, followed by microglia activation on days 1 to 7. We also observed that brain mRNA levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers increased during the acute phase and decreased in the chronic phase. Furthermore, we observed blood cofilin levels increase on day 3, matching the increase in chemokine levels. The study outcomes suggest that cofilin overactivation due to SSH1 increase might play a role in microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and subsequent PSCI. The cellular mechanisms that trigger pathological changes around hematomas in ICH patients are poorly understood. Multiple inflammatory cascades and cytotoxic mediators are involved [39]. These are known to cause neuronal cell death, microglial activation, and functional impairment, which are the features of secondary brain injury following ICH [40,41]. Understanding the inflammatory processes after ICH in humans may contribute to new therapeutic opportunities. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain that maintain brain homeostasis and regulate neuronal networks and synaptic plasticity. Microglia clear and engulf damaged debris through their phagocytic activity, but excessive microglial activation after brain injury is associated with pathological injury and neuroinflammation. The effects of toxic or protective microglia depend on their phenotype and the severity of the brain ictus [42,43]. One study has shown activated microglia in human brain sections from patients with spontaneous ICH, from day 1 of ICH to day 12, which was associated with alterations of microglial size and morphology [44]. Similarly, our study on humans and mice demonstrates that cofilin is overexpressed and colocalized with activated microglia around hematomas in the ICH group, with morphological changes contributing to neuroinflammation. In addition, studies have shown that activated cofilin is redistributed in the cytoplasm, leading to changes in the cell shape [45,46]. The knockdown of cofilin is associated with an increased amount of F-actin and a change in the microglial cell morphology [47]. These observations concord with our immunohistochemical results showing cofilin activation and redistribution and altered microglial morphology after ICH. Moreover, the critical findings are the surge in inflammatory cytokines following ICH on day 3, impairing the M-2 anti-inflammatory phenotype and reducing repair mechanisms. In addition, M1 pro-inflammatory cytokines can aggravate brain injury and damage neurons and oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, microglia were observed to recover from their ameboid to ramified shapes on days 14, 21, and 28 on the ipsilateral side but were accompanied by the formation of cofilin rods localized in their processes (Figure 4). These results are consistent with the idea that cofilin rods/aggregates contribute to ICH, mainly by morphological alterations of microglia and neuroinflammation. The surge of inflammatory\nCells 2023, 12, 1153 15 of 20\nmRNA levels (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) within 1 day of ICH and lasting for 3 days provides evidence that cofilin overactivation is a starting point for widespread neuroinflammation. The decrease in cofilin expression beyond day 3 coincides with the decline in inflammatory markers. Nevertheless, the initial increase in anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and Arg1) on day 3 and then the reduction from day 7 to 28 depicts that the endogenous anti-inflammatory system does not recover from the initial onslaught of inflammation, hampering the recovery following ICH. It also implies that the inflammatory response in the CNS is a complex process that includes multiple steps with different mediators playing several roles at different times. It could be inferred that the immune response initially mounts an inflammatory response to clear damaged tissue but then tandemly switches to an anti-inflammatory response to promote tissue healing and recovery, but the severity of the injury overwhelms the antioxidant response. Plasma levels of cofilin increase, and plasma chemokines/cytokines surge within 3 days of ICH also correlates with cofilin brain levels. All these pieces of evidence point to cofilin overaction initiating inflammatory crises. Our published study where cofilin knockdown by siRNA before ICH reduced neuronal apoptosis, microglial activation, and oxidative stress and improved neurobehavioral deficits adds credence to our findings [34]. Furthermore, the idea that cofilin is associated with and is the center stage for neuroinflammation is further evidenced by the upstream and downstream signaling pathways found to be increased or decreased in our studies. To this end, SSHs is the leading player that activates cofilin. Three mammalian SSHs have phosphatase activity on cofilin. However, SSH1 is highly effective in activating the cofilin [23]. SSH1 has an N-terminal domain that interacts with cofilin, and Cys-393 residue is essential in eliminating the phosphate group from Ser-3 of the cofilin [48]. In addition, SSH1 can dephosphorylate LIMK1 and mitigate the LIMK1 enzymatic activity toward cofilin. SSH1 also has independent bundling activity to stabilize F-actin and stimulate the F-actin disassembly [49,50]. Singla et al. suggested that macrophage growth factor initiation could activate cofilin and control actin dynamics by the SSH1 pathway [51]. LIM-kinase is an actin-binding protein that phosphorylates cofilin at Ser-3, reducing actin-binding and depolymerizing cofilin activities [52,53]. LIMK1/LIMK2 regulates cofilin phosphorylation activity; LIMK1 phosphorylates cofilin by ras-linked C3 botulinum substrate 1 (Rac1), while LIMK2 inactivates cofilin through Rho and cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) [54]. Downregulation of LIMK1 restrains the lamellipodium development produced by Rac1 or insulin. Therefore, LIMK1 and LIMK2 phosphorylate cofilin via the Rac1 and Rho/CDC42 pathways [55]. An increase in SSH1 and a decrease in LIMK1 and pLIMK are conducive to cofilin activation and could be a sequel for neuroinflammation. The occurrence of PSCI after ICH suggests diverse pathophysiologic mechanisms triggering this phenomenon. Our study shows that PSCI occurs in mice in the acute and chronic phases after ICH, with findings in parallel with those observed in human ICH patients [56]. In addition, we noted that mice suffer from severe PSCI in the acute and chronic phases after ICH. The observed increase in infarct volume from day 1 to 3, which was taken over by ventricular loss after day 21 to 28, suggests that PSCI is the possible outcome of neuronal loss and tissue damage. The signaling pattern of decreased synaptophysin on day 14 in the ipsilateral region and PSD95 in the contralateral area indicates PSCI following ICH. Since cofilin overactivation or rods/aggregates lead to a reduction in synaptophysin and PSD95, it might be the possible cause of synaptic dysfunction and PSCI observed in our results. The results are in line with other studies, in which cognitive impairment occurs in the acute (5 days) [57] or chronic period (28 days [58] or 35 days [18]) after ICH. A previous study suggested that cofilin rod formation impairs synaptic structure and function in both in vivo and in vitro ischemic models [26]. Won et al. showed that cofilin activation leads to cofilin\u2013actin rods in neuronal processes in four different ischemic mouse models implicating oxidative stress main culprit due to cofilin\u2013actin rod formations [30]. A recent study showed that cofilin rod formation is significantly increased in the cortical core and penumbra after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, causing\nCells 2023, 12, 1153 16 of 20\ndegradation of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) and apoptosis [59]. Inhibiting cofilin rod aggregation by overexpression of LIMK rescued the MAP2 and attenuated the apoptosis, suggesting cofilin in direct inhibition as a treatment option for the ischemic stroke [59]. Our findings are in consonance with the aforementioned studies, suggesting that cofilin rods/aggregates might have been associated with microglial activation and neuroinflammation, subsequently impacting synaptic plasticity and PSCI. Dysregulation of cofilin signaling or expression has been implicated in several neurological conditions, including ICH [33,34], ischemic stroke [60], and traumatic brain injury (TBI) [61]. Given the similarities between ICH, ischemic stroke, and TBI in terms of the initial injury and subsequent inflammatory response, it is likely that cofilin dysregulation or overexpression may play a role in the pathophysiology of neural injury in these conditions. Cofilin overexpression has been linked to several key features of ischemic stroke pathophysiology, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Cofilin rod aggregation in ischemic stroke can contribute to excitotoxicity by promoting dendritic spine loss and disrupting the cytoskeleton, impairing synaptic plasticity and neuronal death [26]. Cofilin can also interact with other signaling pathways that enhance oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to the neurodegeneration [55]. Similarly, in TBI, the injury can cause a complex cascade of events that result in tissue damage and cell death [62]. Cofilin overexpression may contribute to this damage by promoting inflammation and disrupting cellular signaling pathways, which can aggravate tissue injury and contribute to secondary damage. Therefore, the results of cofilin signaling in ICH might help understand the pathophysiology of neural injury in ischemic stroke and TBI. Several limitations need to be mentioned. First, sex and age are essential features that impact the ICH outcomes. Studies have reported that women with spontaneous ICH show less brain edema than men [63]. Female mice with ICH also display lesser neurological deficits and brain edema than male mice, suggesting sex differences in ICH, likely mediated by estrogen-reduced iron and hemoglobin-induced neurotoxicity [64\u201366]. Aged rats with ICH show more severe neurological deficits and brain swelling than young rats, indicating that age has a crucial effect on response to ICH [67]. Therefore, future studies involving aged mice are warranted to study their impact on cofilin signaling after ICH. Moreover, later time points, such as 3 months of survival after ICH, should also be considered to evaluate long-term pathological alterations, particularly cognitive deficits. We noted that cofilin was also overexpressed in the neuropil area, a finding that merits further studies on cofilin\u2019s impact on neuronal, astrocytic, and oligodendrocyte functions. Finally, there is a limitation of not showing the direct role of cofilin by either blocking the phenotype or knocking out the gene. Such a study would have conclusively established the direct role of cofilin in neuroinflammation and other outcomes. In conclusion, the results of the present study show for the first time that hemorrhagic brain injury-induced cofilin rods/aggregates are associated with microglial activation and microglial morphological alterations in humans and mice. These results support the idea that longitudinal cofilin signaling is at the center stage of microglial activation, neuroinflammation, motor impairments, and PSCI, offering novel potential therapeutic avenues for ICH.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells12081153/s1, Table S1.
