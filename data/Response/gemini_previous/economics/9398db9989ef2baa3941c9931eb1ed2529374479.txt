1. **Incorporate uncertainty and risk into the model.** The current model assumes that all parameters are known with certainty. However, in reality, there is often uncertainty and risk associated with international trade, such as changes in exchange rates, tariffs, and transportation costs. A future research direction could be to extend the model to incorporate uncertainty and risk and to study how these factors affect the equilibrium outcomes.


2. **Consider the impact of trade policies on food security.** The current model does not explicitly consider the impact of trade policies on food security. However, food security is a major concern in many countries, and trade policies can have a significant impact on food availability and prices. A future research direction could be to extend the model to incorporate food security and to study how trade policies affect food security in different countries.


3. **Analyze the effects of different transportation modes.** The current model assumes that all commodities are transported by a single mode of transportation. However, in reality, commodities can be transported by multiple modes of transportation, such as ships, trucks, and trains. A future research direction could be to extend the model to incorporate multiple modes of transportation and to study how the choice of transportation mode affects the equilibrium outcomes.


4. **Investigate the role of market power in international trade.** The current model assumes that all firms are competitive. However, in reality, firms may have market power, which can affect the equilibrium outcomes. A future research direction could be to extend the model to incorporate market power and to study how market power affects the equilibrium outcomes.


5. **Develop a dynamic model of international trade.** The current model is a static model, which means that it does not consider the effects of time. However, in reality, international trade is a dynamic process, and the equilibrium outcomes can change over time. A future research direction could be to develop a dynamic model of international trade and to study how the equilibrium outcomes evolve over time.
