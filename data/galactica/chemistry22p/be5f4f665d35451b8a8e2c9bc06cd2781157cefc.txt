The interactions of drugs with cell membranes are of primary importance for several processes involved in drugs activity. However, these interactions are very difficult to study due to the complexity of biological membranes. Lipid model membranes have been developed and used to gain insight into drug–membrane interactions. In this study, the interaction of protocatechuic acid ethyl ester, showing radical-scavenging activity, antimicrobial, antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects, with model membranes constituted by multilamellar vesicles and monolayers made of DMPC and DSPC, has been studied. Differential scanning calorimetry and Langmuir–Blodgett techniques have been used. Protocatechuic acid ethyl ester interacted both with MLV and monolayers. However, a stronger interaction of the drug with DMPC-based model membranes has been obtained. The finding of this study could help to understand the protocatechuic acid ethyl ester action mechanism. 1. conclusions These results show that PCAEE can be incorporated into simplified models of the cell membrane represented by MLV and monolayers made of DMPC and DSPC. In addition, the results suggest that the chain lengths of the phospholipids can play an important role in interactions with PCAEE. The information obtained is important because the interactions with the components of the cell membrane are essential for a compound to have a biological effect.
