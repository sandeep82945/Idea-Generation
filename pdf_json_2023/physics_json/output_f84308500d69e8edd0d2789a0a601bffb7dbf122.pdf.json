            "text": "Methyltransferases (MTases) are a family of enzymes that transfer methyl groups to substrates. In most methyltransferases, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) acts as the methyl group donor, with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) as a metabolic byproduct [1]. Substrates for methyltransferases are diverse and include small molecules, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [2]. MTases can be classified according to the molecule accepting the methyl group, with oxygen (O-), nitrogen (N)- or carbon (C-) MTases being most common, although a few thiol (S-) MTases are known to exist and some MTases can methylate more than one type of acceptor molecule [3]. Of the known human MTases, only a few are known to metabolize drugs and these include catecholamine O-methyltransferase (COMT), which can metabolize levodopa and thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes thiopurines used in the treatment of leukemia [4]. Another MTase linked to drug methylation is thiol methyltransferase (TMT), the existence of which was hypothesized over 60 years ago when it was found that incubating liver microsomes from humans and animals with compounds such as dimercaprol, 2-mercaptoethanol, and hydrogen sulfide led to their methylation [5]. TMT\n\u00a0 3\u00a0\nactivity was also reported in the membranes of erythrocytes and was responsible for the methylation of the drugs captopril and 7-alpha thiospironolactone [6]. Recently, it was determined that METTL7A and METTL7B are the human TMTs that play this role, as both can methylate captopril and thiospironolactone, as well as other thiol-containing molecules including penicillamine and dithiothreitol [7, 8]. METTL7A and METTL7B were renamed TMT1A and TMT1B, respectively, to reflect their activity. We discovered that TMT1A was overexpressed in a series of cell lines selected for resistance to romidepsin, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDACi) [9]. Romidepsin is a prodrug that harbors a disulfide bond that must be reduced to yield the active form of the molecule. Activated romidepsin contains a thiol group that coordinates with a zinc ion to reversibly inhibit class I HDACs and methylation of the thiol group inactivates the drug [10]. We found that TMT1A overexpression confers resistance to HDACis with a thiol as the zinc-binding group, while TMT1B has a narrower substrate range [9]. We showed that TMT1A was able to methylate and inactivate the zinc-binding thiol of activated romidepsin, thus leading to drug resistance [9]. Animal model systems are frequently used to investigate the physiological function of proteins. While TMT1B is not conserved, TMT1A is found in many different model species, including the zebrafish, chicken, rat, and mouse. To determine if animal models could be used to gain insight into the role of TMT1A and TMT1B, we first needed to know if their functions are conserved across various species. By overexpressing TMT1A variants in HEK293 cells, we found that TMT1A proteins from different species were all able to confer resistance to thiol-based HDACis to varying degrees, suggesting that this function of TMT1A is conserved and that animal model systems could indeed be used to elucidate the physiological role of these methyltransferases."

Zebrafish also have three genes that are tandem duplications, tmt1a.1, tmt1a.2 and tmt1a.3. Since the TMT1B gene is not conserved\u2014 chickens and zebrafish lack the gene\u2014we chose to focus on conserved homologs of TMT1A to determine if its function was retained across species. Amino acid alignment of the different TMT1A homologs showed high conservation among species (Figure 1A). In particular, we show that the GxGxG domain, a hallmark binding domain for SAM-dependent methyltransferases [15] (noted by red asterisks and the red letters at positions 78, 80 and 82 in human TMT1A) is conserved. Additionally, the aspartic acid at position 98 (denoted by a green asterisk) also predicted to bind SAM [7, 16], is conserved as well. Furthermore, we find that there are high conservation values and consensus at each amino acid. An examination of the amino acid sequence identity among the proteins (Fig. 1B) revealed that mouse and rat TMT1A have the closest sequence identity with humans at 85.7% and 84.8%, respectively, while chicken TMT1A has 60.7% identity and zebrafish only 51% identity. In addition, a phylogeny of TMT1A homologs indicates that human, mouse, and rat form one cluster, suggesting a conservation of methylation activity, while chicken and zebrafish are more divergent (Figure 1C).

Predicted molecular weights for human (Hs), mouse (Mm), rat (Rn), chicken (Gg) or zebrafish (Dr) TMT1A are approximately 22-28 kDa and the bands appeared to be approximately the same size, with zebrafish having the highest molecular weight. A second band at approximately 40 kDa was observed for humans, and a similar band was found in the mouse and rat homologs but not in the chicken or zebrafish (Fig. 1F). Analysis of protein post-translational modification data from PhosphoSite Plus [17] of human, mouse, and rat TMT1A revealed that several amino acids are predicted to have conserved modifications. In particular, the K34, K55, K105, and K219 sites were predicted to have conserved ubiquitination modifications in human and mouse. K105-ub has been identified in several high-throughput studies [18, 19], possibility indicating its importance to TMT1A function or localization. Conversely, K211-ubiquitination and S218-phosphorylation were predicted to be conserved in mice and rats, but those modifications were not observed in humans. The presence of the ubiquitination sites may contribute to the bands observed at higher molecular weight. Having confirmed expression of the TMT1A homologs in the transfected cells, we performed three-day cytotoxicity assays with known substrates of human TMT1A. We previously reported that overexpression of TMT1A in MCF-7 cells conferred resistance to a number of thiol-containing HDACis including romidepsin, KD-5170, and NCH-51 [9]. When we compared the resistance conferred by the TMT1A homologs, we observed resistance to all the thiol-containing drugs compared to empty vector cells, although there were differences in the extent of resistance among the homologs (Fig. 2A). The highest levels of romidepsin resistance were found in cells expressing human, mouse, and rat TMT1A, while cells expressing the chicken and zebrafish homologs were less resistant. Chicken TMT1A conferred less resistance to KD-5170 (Fig. 2A) and the rat homolog conferred less resistance to NCH-51 compared to the other homologs (Fig 2A). Mouse and rat TMT1A conferred equal levels of resistance to NCH-51 compared to human. As expected, we did not observe any resistance to belinostat (Fig. 2A), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that does not have a thiol as the zinc-binding group."

            "text": "Treatment with HDACis is known to result in increased global histone acetylation and upregulation of many genes, including CDKN1A which codes for p21. Upregulation of p21 is known to cause cell cycle arrest and treatment with HDACis results in either a G1/G0 and/or G2/M arrest [20, 21]. To determine if the homologs of TMT1A would provide protection from the effects of HDACi treatment, cells expressing empty vector or the TMT1A homologs were treated with 10 ng/ml romidepsin (Dp), 10 \u00b5M KD-5170 (KD) or 25 \u00b5M NCH-51 (NCH) for 24 h and cell cycle analysis was performed. As shown in Figure 3A, empty vector cells (Vec, top row) demonstrate an increase in G2/M cells when treated with any of the HDACis, while cells expressing rat TMT1A (Rn, bottom row) did not display any changes in the cell cycle. Results with all the HDACis are summarized in Figure 3B and we found that treatment of cells expressing any of the TMT1A homologs with HDACis resulted in cell cycle changes that were less drastic than those observed in the empty vector cells. These results are in agreement with the cytotoxicity data, which indicated that overexpression of any of the homologs conferred resistance to thiol-based HDACis. As treatment with HDACis is known to cause increased p21 expression as well as increased histone acetylation [22], we next examined the effect of HDACi treatment on histone acetylation and p21 expression after a 24h treatment with 10 ng/ml romidepsin. Treatment of empty vector cells with romidepsin resulted in an increase in acetylated histone H3 and p21 (Fig. 4), while this effect was blunted in cells expressing any of the TMT1A homologs. These results suggest that expression of any of the TMT1A homologs led to resistance to the effects of thiol-based HDACis most likely due to methylation of the zinc-binding thiol."

            "text": "Early studies with liver microsomes suggested the existence of a thiol methyltransferase that could methylate thiol groups on molecules [4-6]. Recently, TMT1A and TMT1B have been identified as thiol methyltransferases capable of methylating molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, captopril and thospironolactone [7, 8]. We also recently reported that TMT1A and TMT1B can methylate and inactivate HDACis with a thiol as the zincbinding group [9]. To determine if the thiol methyltransferase activity of these enzymes is evolutionarily conserved, we transfected HEK-293 cells to express human, zebrafish, chicken, mouse, or rat TMT1A. TMT1B was not found in the chicken or zebrafish. We found that overexpression of any TMT1A isoform was able to confer resistance to any of the HDACis studied that has a thiol as the zinc-binding group. Additionally, overexpression of any of the TMT1A forms protected the cells from downstream effects of HDACi treatment, such as cell cycle arrest and increased levels of histone acetylation and p21. We thus conclude that the thiol methyltransferase activity is conserved across species and suggest that animal models may indeed aid in the determination of the physiological role of TMT1A. Previous work on the conservation of enzyme function has shown that when the pairwise sequence identity of two proteins is above approximately 40%, they are evolutionarily related [23, 24], while sequence identity above approximately 70% can be linked to conservation of enzyme function [25]. Further, conservation of catalytic residues is expected to be highest among homologs that catalyze the same reaction, followed by enzymes that perform the same reaction but on different substrates [26]. When we compared the amino acid sequences of the TMT1A homologs, we observed high pairwise sequence identity (Figure 1B) and near universal conservation of the catalytic residues, strengthening our hypothesis that these homologs would all be able to act on thiol-containing HDAC inhibitors. Similarly, when we perform 3D structure prediction with AlphaFold, we observe that TMT1A proteins from different species all adopt the conserved seven-beta-strand (7BS) MTase fold and show good structural alignment of the conserved S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding domain (Figure 1E). However, we note that the predicted structure may differ from the actual enzyme structure. As TMT1A and TMT1B are poorly described, little is known about their physiological function. Interestingly, although they are thiol methyltransferases, they do not seem to methylate thiols on endogenous compounds such as glutathione or cysteine [7, 8]. However, both enzymes are able to methylate hydrogen sulfide, which has been demonstrated to have multiple functions in the cell [27] and may be dysregulated in cancer. Elevated levels of methanethiol have been found in patients diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma [28]. In this study, we demonstrate that these enzymes share high sequence and structure conservation, and that the thiol methyltransferase activity of TMT1A is conserved across different species. Thus, generation of animals lacking either or both TMT1A and TMT1B could shed light on the normal physiological roles of these methyltransferases.\n105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

We found expression of TMT1A in the liver, breast epithelium, glial cells, and Leydig cells of the testis and TMT1B in the liver, intestinal enterocytes, and neurons [9], consistent with a protective role. TMT1A expression was also found in Bergmann glial cells, suggesting a role in the cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier. Russell and colleagues also reported high levels of TMT1A and TMT1B in human liver microsome samples and protein expression of both enzymes correlated with thiospironolactone methylation activity [8]. Interestingly, methyltransferase activity in samples varied by 8-fold [8], suggesting potential interpatient variability in the metabolism of thiol-containing drugs. Although mutations of TMT1A or TMT1B could affect their activity, further work needs to be done to support this hypothesis. Author contributions J.M.
