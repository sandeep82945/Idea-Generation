The right emission originates from the accretion of gas on to the SMBH, hich is driven by some mechanism of viscous dissipation.

An inevitable implication f thin disc models, ho we ver, is their vulnerability to gravitational nstability (GI) in the outer regions (e.g. Shlosman & Begelman 987 ; Goodman 2003 ).

I also generates spiral density waves (Durisen et al. 2007 ). These on-axisymmetries can dominate the angular momentum transport in ea vily self-gra vitating discs (e.g. Kumar 1999 ; Lodato & Rice 2004 , 005 ; Cossins, Lodato & Clarke 2009 ) and ultimately determine he disc evolution (Boley et al. 2010 ). In turn, energy dissipation ue to gas collapse and density wave propagation generates heat, hich can re-stabilize the disc. The interplay between collapse and estabilization suggests that regions of discs may exist in a quasiteady state of inflow, or a gravitoturbulent state in the case that ragmentation is suppressed (Rafikov 2009 ), where the accretion ow is partially driven albeit not terminated by GI. Fragmentation due to marginal GI has been proposed as a echanism for star formation in AGN discs (Shlosman & Begelman 987 ; Wang & Silk 1994 ; Goodman 2003 ; Goodman & Tan 2004 ; ayakshin 2006 ; Levin 2007 ) that may explain stellar discs in the alactic Centre (Levin & Beloborodov 2003 ; Nayakshin & Sunyaev 005 ; Davies & Lin 2020 ), in addition to altering the growth rate f SMBHs (Dittmann & Miller 2020 ).

AGN-assisted CR interaction s a proposed formation channel for high-frequenc y GW ev ents etectable by LIGO-Virgo, in particular to explain detected stellar rigin BH\u2013BH mergers with large constituent masses and events ith unequal mass ratios or unusual spins (Bartos et al. 2017 ; Stone, etzger & Haiman 2017 ; McKernan et al. 2018 , 2020 ; Secunda t al. 2019 ; Yang et al. 2019 ; Tagawa, Haiman & Kocsis 2020a ; agawa et al. 2020b , 2021 ; Gayathri et al. 2021 ). Embedded CRs (or tars, if not disrupted) may also migrate to the central regions of the isc where they interact with the central SMBH and become lower requency GW sources, referred to as extreme- or intermediate-mass atio inspirals (E/IMRIs), which will be detectable by future spaceased interferometers such as LISA (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017 ), ianQin (Fan et al. 2020 ), or TAIJI Gong et al. ( 2021 ). Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are a prime target for illiHz GW missions. The detection of even one will provide igh precision measurements of the central SMBH mass and spin Barack & Cutler 2007 ; Babak et al. 2017 ). If the EMRI is embedded n gas, the GW signal can carry signatures of the environment that an be potentially constrain environment properties and complex igration physics (Kocsis, Yunes & Loeb 2011 ; Yunes et al. 2011 ; arausse, Cardoso & Pani 2014 ; Derdzinski et al. 2019 , 2021 ; wick et al. 2022 ). Rate estimates of EMRI formation via dynamical nteractions in galactic nuclei span orders of magnitude in uncertainty Amaro-Seoane 2020 ). Luckily, it is becoming apparent that the resence of an accretion disc can boost the EMRI formation rate Pan & Yang 2021 ; Pan, Lyu & Yang 2021 ). One mechanism for MRI facilitation occurs due to the influence of the accretion disc n the orbits of stars and CRs in the nucleus, which tend to align and orotate with the disc (Norman & Silk 1983 ; Syer, Clarke & Rees 991 ; Fabj et al. 2020 ; Tagawa et al. 2020a ). Additionally, instabilitynduced star formation can produce in situ CRs that accrete, merge, r migrate towards the central SMBH (Goodman & Tan 2004 ; Levin 007 ). The latter works describe the collapse and aggregation of lumps in marginally stable discs that leads to the formation of a ingle, supermassive embedded star.\nIn this work, we revisit models of gravitationally unstable accretion iscs, e xtending solutions o v er a set of system parameters (namely MBH mass and rate of viscous inflow), to demonstrate the range of nitial conditions for in situ AGN stars. We investigate the diversity of he stellar mass distribution and subsequent evolutionary outcomes. ot all AGNs are the same \u2013 SMBH masses, the total gas mass, nd efficiency of inflow can vary, leading to different predictions or the location of fragmentation and the AGN star evolutionary utcomes: tidal disruption, in situ EMRIs, or lefto v er stellar popuations.

We then briefly summarize theoretical aspects of star formation SF) employed in this work, before describing our disc model in ection 2.2 . With solutions for disc structure, we derive the regime here fragmentation is expected to occur in Section 2.3 . In Section 3 , e describe the process of fragmentation to gravitational collapse of rotostars, based on the size of the instability, the collapse rate, and he accretion on to the resulting cores, and we derive the initial\nass distribution of stars. In Section 4 , we describe the subsequent volution of AGN-star populations, given their ability to migrate and volve throughout the disc. In Section 5 , we discuss the outcomes\nf embedded stars, which can be tidally disrupted or accreted by he SMBH, and we quantify the rate of in situ EMRIs for each isc solution. Finally, in Section 6 we summarize the tak eaw ays and aveats of this work.\nI NI TI AL C O N D I T I O N S\n.1 Astrophysical rationale\nhe criteria for fragmentation of gas into bound objects have been xtensiv ely tested in numerical simulations, often in the context of rotoplanetary discs. It is well understood that fragmentation will ccur if the disc cools on a time-scale comparable to the local rbital time (Gammie 2001 ; Johnson & Gammie 2003 ; Clarke, arper-Clark & Lodato 2007 ; Mayer & Gawryszczak 2008 ), alhough determining the precise conditions has pro v ed a challenging umerical problem. The criteria for fragmentation, as well as the utcome of collapsing clumps (whether at the scale of planets, stars, r something in between) are sensitive to numerical implementations f disc thermodynamics (Mayer et al. 2004 ; Rice, Lodato & Armitage 005 ), numerical viscosity (Hu et al. 2014 ), gravitational softening Young & Clarke 2015 ), and small-scale resolution (Nelson 2006 ; aardekooper 2012 ; Bruc y & Hennebelle 2021 ). Recent numerical tudies find convergence (over implementations of artificial viscosty) on the critical cooling rate below which fragmentation occurs, nding \u03b2crit \u2261 t cool \u2248 3 (Deng, Mayer & Meru 2017 ), where t cool s the radiative cooling time-scale and = ( GM / r 3 ) 1/2 is the orbital requency at a radius r in a disc around a central mass M . This is the riteria we adopt in this work.\nConvergence on the size and mass distribution of resulting clumps as yet to be attained numerically, ho we ver. Linear perturbation heory that computes the growth rate of local axisymmetric density erturbations in razor-thin discs predicts that fragmentation produces lumps on a characteristic scale, namely the most unstable Toomre avelength (Toomre 1964 ). Yet several simulations find that clumps orm at systematically smaller sizes, e ven dif fering by an order of agnitude from the predictions of perturbation theory (e.g. Boley t al. 2010 ; Forgan & Rice 2011 ; Galvagni et al. 2012 ; Galvagni & ayer 2014 ; M \u0308uller, Helled & Mayer 2018 ; Deng, Mayer & Helled 021 ). Differences arise due to finite disc thickness, departure rom axisymmetry, and non-linear effects in the gas flow dynamics mmediately prior to fragmentation. In particular, fragmentation is lmost invariably seen to occur along spiral arms generated in the nitial phase of a GI in realistic discs on a variety of scales, hence lumps form in a gas flow having inherently a non-axisymmetric haracter (see e.g. Boley et al. 2010 for protoplanetary disc scales or amburello et al. 2015 for galaxy-scale fragmentation). In addition, oon after fragmentation ensues, other effects matter in the non-linear tage, which, by construction, cannot be captured by perturbation heory, such as the rotational support in clumps (Galvagni et al. 012 ), and their vulnerability by local shear and stellar tidal forces Galvagni & Mayer 2014 ; M \u0308uller et al. 2018 ). Furthermore, and erhaps most critical for ionized gas in AGN discs, large deviations rom predictions of Toomre instability theory, both before and fter fragmentation, arise in simulations of discs threaded with agnetic fields. This results in clump sizes that are even two orders f magnitude smaller than those in non-magnetized discs (Deng, ayer & Latter 2020 ). When estimating the characteristic sizes of re-stellar clumps in this work, we draw from the results of recent umerical simulations to take these reductions into account. Considering that we are concerned with fragmentation at the AGN isc scale, we must also consider basic details of star formation.\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nM\nTable 1.

Determining the stellar mass distribution from a ollapsing cloud is a non-trivial problem given that complexities n opacity, radiative processes, rotation, and magnetic fields are all ritical for determining the resulting stellar masses (Larson 1969 ; enston 1969 ; Stahler & Palla 2004 ), particularly in regimes of high ccretion rates that lead to supermassive stars (SMSs; Hosokawa 019 ; Haemmerl \u0301e et al. 2021 ). In the case of star formation induced by GI in an AGN disc, ragmentation occurs in high angular momentum material and at nitially higher densities and temperatures than a typical molecular loud. Protostars ef fecti vely skip the initially slo w phase of prestellar ontraction. 1 Such cores collapse rapidly due to the gas conditions, as e will show, experiencing high accretion rates. Certain conditions ead to the formation of SMSs, for which there are greater uncertainies in the final stellar masses and structure (Hosokawa et al. 2013 ) nd subsequent evolution (Haemmerl \u0301e et al. 2021 ). Critically, the ormation and subsequent evolution of AGN-stars does not occur in solation: gas from the disc may feed the protostellar envelopes and x ert torques. .2 Disc model e define a system of equations describing a thin, Keplerian, steadytate accretion disc.

The viscosity is parametrized with the alphaisc prescription, as in Shakura & Sunyaev ( 1973 ). The disc model s similar to that presented in Sirko & Goodman ( 2003 ), except that, hile they adopted tabulated opacities (from Alexander & Ferguson 994 ; Iglesias & Rogers 1996 ), we use analytical opacity fits by ell & Lin ( 1994 ).

For p rad , we use an ef fecti ve radiation pressure s in Sirko & Goodman ( 2003 ). In the limit of high opacity ( \u03c4 ), this reduces to the typical scaling with mid-plane temperature p rad = 4 \u03c3T 4 mid / (3 c)). When the gas is optically thin ( \u03c4 < 1), p rad \u221d 2 T 4 mid , and the extra opacity dependence arises as a consequence of he inefficiency of radiation in an optically thin medium. This gives us effectively a system of seven equations with seven ariables: \u03c1( r ), ( r ), T mid ( r ), \u03ba( r ), \u03c4 ( r ), h ( r ), and c s ( r ), which can be olved numerically at each radius r given a choice of central mass M , ccretion rate M\u0307 [which implies T eff ( r )], and viscosity parameter \u03b1.\nOnce solving the abo v e equations o v er a range of radii, we an calculate the Toomre stability parameter Q (Toomre 1964 ; oldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965 ):\n= c s \u03c0G . (9)\neyond the radius where the Toomre Q becomes less than a critical alue Q 0 \u2261 1.4, the disc is gravitationally unstable. In this regime, e restrict Q = Q 0 , ef fecti vely holding the disc in a marginally table, self-regulated state. The solutions for the outer disc carry imple, analytical scalings with chosen parameters, as shown in e veral pre vious w orks (Rafik ov 2009 , 2015 ; Nayakshin 2006 , among thers). The assumption of a constant M\u0307 implies a constant mid-plane emperature and sound speed, and in turn changes the condition for he outer disc density to be\n= 2\n2 \u03c0GQ 0 . (10)\nass conservation means that equation ( 2 ) still applies, although the ource of viscosity mediated by \u03b1 should be no longer interpreted s the scale of turbulent eddies but by the ef fecti veness of nonxisymmetries due to GI.\nThe cooling time of the disc is calculated by\ncool = 1 \u03b3 \u2212 1 3 16 c 2 s \u03c3b T 4\n( \u03c4 + 1\n\u03c4\n) , (11)\nhere we simply take \u03b3 = 5/3 as the adiabatic index. Here, we gain utilize the opacity at the mid-plane of the disc, given that our odel does not explicitly solve for the vertical disc structure. This stimate for the cooling time comes from the presumption that the nergy dissipation due to viscous transport must equal the energy ux through the surface of the disc. Thus, from the equations abo v e, cool \u221d \u22121 in the inner disc (ensuring steady-state) and drops (in manner dependent on the opacity) in the outer disc once the ssumption of viscous dissipation (via equation 1 ) breaks down with he onset GI.\nBy assuming the viscosity is dependent on the total pressure, the adiation-pressure dominated region of the inner disc is thermally nstable (Piran 1978 ; Pringle 1981 ). One workaround for this is to ssume the viscosity depends on the gas pressure only (the so-called eta-disc model, Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974 ; Hur \u0301e, Richard & Zahn 001 ), which will weaken the viscosity in the inner region and (to aintain the same M\u0307 ) lead to a higher density. For this work, we tick with the alpha-disc assumption, given that it does not strongly ffect the properties in the outer disc region where gas pressure is ominant. Full disc solutions are shown for a range of SMBH masses and two alues of \u03b1 in Fig. 1 . One prominent feature in our disc solutions for ower SMBH masses is an opacity gap at \u223c 10 \u22123 pc. As we decrease he central SMBH mass, the lower densities and temperatures in the isc allow for the dominant opacity to change from electron scattering nd bound-free/free-free transitions to H-recombination, resulting in\nsharp opacity drop and a corresponding change in the density profile further discussed in Section 2.3 ). Note that the adoption of piecewise pacity powerlaws 3 results in unrealistically sharp transitions in the isc profiles. In a more realistic system, these transitions should be moother given that opacity regimes may overlap.\nWe also consider the effect of a temperature background on the isc, which can increase T eff and affect the cooling rate. There is bserv ational e vidence that surface irradiation contributions a subtantial fraction of the disc temperature from reverberation mapping tudies of some Seyfert AGN (Fausnaugh et al. 2016 ; Starkey et al. 017 ). If we assume that the temperature background is sourced by he accretion luminosity emitted from the central BH (or the inner isc region), then equation ( 1 ) obtains an additional component due o external disc heating:\n4 eff, irr =\n3 8 \u03c0\u03c3 2 M\u0307 \u2032 + eff M\u0307 c\n2\n4 \u03c0\u03c3r 2 h r . (12)\nere, we assume the disc albedo is zero, meaning that all incident adiation is absorbed, in order to fully demonstrate the effect of rradiation. We find that incorporating this term increases T eff by a actor of a few, and has the strongest effect for the M BH = 10 6 M odel. The primary effect is to stabilize the inner disc, or increase he distance to the region where GI and fragmentation set in. Fragmentation occurs where Q \u2264 Q 0 and t cool < \u03b2crit / . With our isc solutions, we calculate where the conditions for fragmentation re satisfied. Following previous simulations that measure fragmenation conditions, we choose \u03b2crit = 3. We discuss consequences of he opacity \u2018gap\u2019 for where fragmentation occurs in Section 2.3 .\n.3 Where does fragmentation occur?\nhe fragmenting region of the disc is determined by two concurrent onditions, namely that Q \u223c Q 0 and that the cooling time is t cool < crit , where we choose Q 0 = 1.4 and \u03b2crit = 3. It is only when both hese conditions are satisfied that a disc can achieve fragmentation. In bsence of a short enough cooling time the gas temperature will rise s a result of spiral shocks, raising Q abo v e the fragmentation limit see Durisen et al. 2007 ). Beyond the radius where this is satisfied in a regime r frag ), the disc will fragment into bound clumps which ccrete surrounding material as they collapse, forming protostars. ote that the disc does not necessarily need to be more massive than he central SMBH in order to become self-gravitating: if it is thin nd dense, the criteria are satisfied before M disc \u223c 10 \u22122 M BH (see ig. 2 ). While theory predicts that discs around more massive BHs re more prone to GI (Goodman 2003 ; Lodato 2007 ), we find hat discs around less massive SMBHs may fragment at smaller adii, provided the accretion rate is sufficiently high ( f Edd > 0.05). his is not intuitive \u2013 despite the lower gas densities, the cooler emperature allows for a different opacity source to dominate and onsequently a faster cooling time. Note that if you consider he fragmentation radius in terms of the respective Schwarzschild adii of the central SMBH, for which r S \u221d M BH , then more assive SMBHs fragment at distances of fewer Schwarzschild adii. Ho we ver, the lo wer densities in discs around less massive MBHs mean that the fragments (and subsequent AGN stars) re born with comparatively smaller masses, as we will show\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nM\nNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\ni t e t\n2\nT o t a m a a s 0 t l 1 s s s u s r o l b t a I r d a\n4\ni (\nFigure 3.

Fig. 3 shows solutions for surface density nd opacity profiles for discs with \u03b1 = 0.1 around a BH of ass M BH = 10 6 M , for three different Eddington ratios. Discs t higher steady-state accretion rates are denser, leading to GI nd fragmentation at closer radii ( r t \u223c 10 \u22123 pc, denoted by the tar symbols). The solution with the lowest accretion rate ( f Edd = .05) best demonstrates the full opacity gap, which is comparable o solutions found in Thompson, Quataert & Murray ( 2005 ). A ower accretion rate leads to fragmentation at farther radii ( r t 0 \u22122 pc) beyond the opacity gap in a region dominated by dust cattering and sublimation. In the bottom panel of Fig. 3 , we how the opacity profiles for each disc model, where the star ymbols indicate beyond which radius the disc is gravitationally nstable. In the inner disc, the opacity is dominated by electron cattering and bound-free + free-free transitions. At intermediate adii, temperatures become low enough for H \u2212 recombination to ccur, which results in a sharp opacity drop, beyond which molecular ine cooling begins to dominate. At cooler temperatures, the opacity ecomes dominated by dust sublimation and dust scattering. In hese regions, the disc is still optically thick, as shown in Fig. 1 , nd thus the transition in opacity strongly affects the cooling rate. n summary, the dominant opacity law within the fragmentation egion may vary from H-absorption to molecular interactions to ust grain sublimation, depending on the combination of density nd temperature at r t . 4\nWhile we do not address the subsequent implications for opacity changes n this work, we note that the opacity may affect the critical cooling rate Cossins, Lodato & Clarke 2010 ) as well as the resulting stellar properties.\nS\nI g c m\nIn Fig. 4 , we show the minimum radius of fragmentation, or the ransition radius r t , versus the central SMBH mass for different ccretion rates.

In he linear theory, this characteristic scale \u03bbmu is derived from the ispersion relation for local axisymmetric density perturbations, and orresponds to the most unstable wavelength mu = 2 c 2 s G , (13) he maximum scale at which fragmentation can occur is given by wice the most unstable wavelength.

We consider M frag a fiducial stimate for the initial mass of prestellar fragments, which notably redicts masses that are an order of magnitude less massive than M T . We show the range of clump masses as a function of the fragentation radius for each disc model in Fig. 5 . Note that each line epresents a value of the characteristic clump mass at each radius, ather than a strict prediction of the mass distribution. A few to several lumps may form in each radial bin with a distribution centred on the haracteristic mass. The initial mass distribution of the population ill fall within the given mass range, but with a slope that depends n the gas density and SF efficiency.\n.2 From clumps to protostars\nnce bound, pre-stellar clumps may continue to collapse depending n the gas properties.

Neglecting rotational support, the protostar embryo consists of a central hydrostatic core and a surrounding free-falling env elope. F or the rotationally dominated case, the mass of the clump is partly in a central core (the nascent protostar) and partly in a surrounding disc. Additional gas can be supplied to the circumclump disc via gas inflow into the Hill sphere.

The former contraction hase is a critical step in conventional star formation (as well as or planet formation in protoplanetary discs; Helled et al. 2014 ), uring which the first core forms. In this phase, the surrounding as is vulnerable to internal feedback once the cloud is optically hick, which slo ws do wn the infall of surrounding gas. In the AGN ase, ho we ver, star formation occurs in an environment with initially igh temperatures (see the mid-plane temperature in Fig. 1 7 ), and ritically, the bound clouds are born in a regime where thermal ffects from their contraction are unimportant. Instead, protostars re ef fecti vely born in the main accretion phase, which is analogous o the dynamical collapse phase in planet formation. Ho we ver, we tress that this outcome is where the analogy between fragmentation n protoplanetary discs and in AGN discs breaks down \u2013 in the planet ase, protoplanets are vulnerable to disruption during their initially low contraction (M \u0308uller et al. 2018 ), while in the AGN case, the nitially high temperatures and densities ensure that clumps collapse ynamically to form stars and are unimpeded by internal feedback r subsequent disruption. During (spherical) dynamical collapse, a gravitationally bound lump will collapse on the free-fall time-scale: ff = ( 3 \u03c0\n32 G\u03c1\n)1 / 2 \u2248 10 ( r\n0 . 01 pc )( 10 6 M M BH )1 / 2 yr, (16)\nhere \u03c1 is the average density of the cloud, and for the right-hand side e have plugged in the disc density scaling from equation ( 10 ), which rovides an upper limit of the free-fall time (since the protostellar lump is ab initio denser than the disc). The estimate is derived or the time for a cloud to collapse to infinite central density, but nevitably before this point the inner temperatures will become ufficiently high to ignite nuclear fusion. The rapid free-fall timecale, a result of the high densities in the disc model, suggests hat clumps in the fragmentation region collapse swiftly into AGN tars within 10 0 t ff 10 3 yr, depending on the initial density of he gas. An additional consequence of such rapid collapse is that ragments become relatively compact, reducing their interaction ross-section soon after formation. This suggests that it is unlikely or fragments to merge with each other during this stage of formation, nless a relatively large number of fragments form.\n.2.1 Accretion during protostar collapse\nuring the main accretion phase, protostars continue to grow via ccretion from their surrounding env elopes. To pro vide conte xt on he scale of rapid growth, we describe two scenarios for this process: he first a simplified, inside\u2013out spherical collapse (considered a\naximum estimate) and the second is an axisymmetric collapse in hich the growth of the prestellar core (PSC) is go v erned by the rate f angular momentum dissipation through a surrounding accretion isc. The latter case further supports the assumptions we adopt in this ork, in which the initial clump masses are lower than previously nticipated. In Fig. 6 , we provide a schematic of the pre-stellar lump assuming purely spherical infall (top panel) and including rotationally supported accretion disc (bottom panel). The latter is natural expectation from fragmentation in an accretion disc. In a\nIn principle, AGN stars may form in gas that is below the H dissociation emperature, which can occur in discs around less massive SMBHs (in fact, he 10 6 M , \u03b1 = 0.1 disc model in Fig. 1 shows that T mid ( r frag ) < 2000 K). In uch cases, the collapse may be initially delayed but should quickly presume ynamical collapse.\nt Q E a ( d p\nhearing medium, PSCs are inevitably born with angular momentum. igher angular momentum material settles into a protostellar disc, hich can delay collapse and mediate the growth of the core Galvagni et al. 2012 ).

The growth of PSCs that have significant rotation proceeds ifferently, yet may lead to similarly high accretion rates. In this ase accretion occurs via a circumstellar disc, which regulates the ow on to the protostar at a rate set by viscous dissipation (the etails of which we neglect here) as well as the gas inflow from the urrounding environment. If we consider the shear flow around the rotostar, accretion into the Hill radius occurs at a rate (following oley et al. 2010 )\n\u02d9 Hill \u2248 9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M yr \u22121\n( a\n0 . 01 pc )1 / 2 ( M \u2217 M )2 / 3\n\u00d7 ( M BH\n10 6 M\n)\u22121 / 6 (\n10 4 g cm \u22122\n) , (18)\nhere we have assumed that the surface density is constant within the rotostar region and normalized to values of interest to our system. ot necessarily all of this mass is accreted by the star, given that as can flow in and out of the Hill radius. Furthermore, accretion ia a disc must be regulated by viscous dissipation, which is often nefficient (Shabram & Boley 2013 ), so equation ( 18 ) should be nterpreted as an upper limit.\nFor both the spherical and axisymmetric cases, accretion rates on o collapsing cores are determined by gas properties which, as a onsequence of our disc model and the scaling of M frag , are constant or all nascent stars.\nF or perspectiv e, note that these accretion prescriptions can exceed he Eddington rate for an object of mass M \u2217,\n\u02d9 Edd = 4 \u03c0GM \u2217 eff \u03baes c \u2248 2 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , M yr \u22121\n( M\nM\n)( 0 . 1\neff\n) . (19)\note that we use the electron scattering opacity here, but in cooler egions of the disc where dust can condense, the lower opacity (as hown in Fig. 3 ) leads to a correspondingly higher possible Eddington ate.\nThe accretion rate during this phase is high but short li ved, gi ven he rapid free-fall time-scale (indeed a strong limit also arises from he local gas supply which quickly runs out). Protostars only increase heir masses by at most a factor of \u223c1/10th during collapse (assuming he y accrete o v er a time-scale t ff ), resulting in characteristic stellar\nasses within the range determined by the initial clump mass equation 15 ), as shown in Fig. 4 . 8 In principle, gas inflow from he global accretion disc could continue to feed the circumstellar isc after star formation. At this point we assume that once the tar is formed, feedback (either from accretion or stellar winds) ould suppress further growth, but we discuss a possible outcome f subsequent stellar accretion in Section 3.4 .\n.2.2 Opacity-limited mass\nminimum clump mass limit can be calculated by determinng the point at which the clump becomes opaque to its own adiation. This minimum mass is known as the \u2018opacity limit\u2019\nNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nIn the case of SMSs, the accretion rate in the main accretion phase is mportant for determining the final stellar mass (Hosokawa et al. 2013 ) and he stability of the growing core (Haemmerl \u0301e et al. 2019 ). By comparing to ore accretion rates of models by Haemmerl \u0301e et al. ( 2019 ), one can see that ven these rapid growth rates remain in the regime of \u2018hydrostatic growth,\u2019 .e. the structure of the PSC can readjust as it gains mass and a v oid runaway rowth that leads to instabilities.\nf\n9\ne c f S a\nass (Low & Lynden-Bell 1976 ; Rees 1976 ; Silk 1977 ). Assumng spherical collapse, the opacity-limit mass is of order M min = . 025(1 /\u03bc) 16 / 7 ( \u03baf /\u03baES ) 1 / 7 M , where \u03bc is the mean molecular eight and \u03ba f the final opacity at which the fragment becomes paque. The limit is weakly dependent on the opacity and remains elow M min 10 \u22121 M for \u03baf 1cm 2 g \u22121 , which is consistent with he range of fragment masses predicted by equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ).\nWe note that this limit may change if one considers that fragmenation occurs in the vicinity of an accreting SMBH, which can impart temperature background (if the fragmenting material is optically hin). In the presence of a radiation field, the opacity-limited mass ecomes more sensitive to the opacity under the assumption that t cannot cool below the background temperature (Low & Lyndenell 1976 ). We defer this calculation to future work, noting that he precise opacity-limit mass in the AGN regime is a complex adiative transfer problem that depends on the composition of the urrounding material, the adiabatic evolution of the fragment, and he preferential geometry of the emitted feedback, from both the GN and the collapsing fragments.\n.3 From disc properties to the stellar mass distribution\nhile the mass distribution shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates the range f possible stellar masses during a fragmentation episode, it does not uantify the total number of stars formed. For this we must assume n SF efficiency , which for simplicity we assume is constant with adius. We adopt = 1 per cent (or = 0.01), which is moti v ated y efficiencies calculated in models of starburst discs (Thompson t al. 2005 ) 9 and supported by observations of starburst galaxies Kennicutt 1998 ) and giant molecular clouds (GMCs; Murray 2011 ). We caution, ho we ver, that the star formation considered in our model ccurs on smaller spatial scales, and need not necessarily lead to imilar efficiencies as observed in GMCs.) Similarly, the efficiency f planet formation via GI in protoplanetary disc simulations suggests 10 per cent of the gas goes into bound clumps, though the fraction s lower if one accounts for subsequent disruption or additional noninear effects (Galvagni et al. 2012 ; M \u0308uller et al. 2018 ; Schib et al. 021 ). To remain conserv ati ve (and to ensure that star formation oes not shut off the accretion flow), we adopt the fiducial value f = 0.01. To account for the possibility that star formation is ore efficient, e.g. in the case that feedback from star formation is ot sufficient to restabilize the disc, we also consider the case of = 0.3, moti v ated by the maximum star formation rates observed in MCs. This choice has implications for the final EMRI rate, which e discuss in Section 5 . Stars form o v er a time-scale proportional to the orbital time: \u03c4 ff \u223c \u22121 , so the efficiency provides a star formation rate\n\u02d9 \u2217 = 2 \u03c0 \u222b r out r t \u0307 \u2217r d r , (20)\nhere \u0307 \u2217 = is the star formation rate per unit area, integrated v er the fragmenting region from r t to the outer disc edge r out . The fficiency can be interpreted as a reduction in the time-scale of star ormation, or, equi v alently, tells us what fraction of the gas turns\nWe refer to their disc model with constant gas fraction, which finds an fficiency of \u223c0.02 in the inner disc re gion. Alternativ ely, one could selfonsistently solve for the reduction in accretion rate as a function of the gas raction, as is also done in Thompson et al. ( 2005 ). In this model, a minimum F rate is required to maintain Q \u223c 1, which in low-opacity regions implies higher SF rate.\nFigure 7.

This results in a combined mass of stars \u2217, tot = \u222b r out r t d n d r d m d n d r = 2 \u03c0 \u222b r out r t r ( r )d r , (25) nd the radial number distribution is constrained by the mass budget s follows: d n d r = d M \u2217, tot d r d n d m . (26)\ntars in each radial bin d n /d r follow a mass distribution d n /d m cenered on the characteristic mass M frag ( r ). In practice, the distribution s obtained by splitting the radial profiles shown in Fig. 4 into 50 iscrete, logarithmically spaced bins, and sampling d n \u223c d m / M frag tars from a distribution centered on the characteristic mass M frag ( r ) ithin each bin. The final distribution does not depend strongly on he number of bins, as long as enough gas is contained within each o form a finite number of stars. We assume stars form only as single ystems, neglecting the binary fraction.\nThis results in the initial mass function shown in Fig. 7 , for hich we plot models with = 0.01. The AGN stellar mass istribution is top-heavy compared to the conventional Salpeter nitial mass function (IMF): Fitting a line to the data shown in ig. 7 provides a slope d N /d m \u221d m , with \u223c \u22120.7. This is onsiderably flatter than the Salpeter IMF, where the slope is SP = \u22122.35. Our finding is in agreement with the stellar mass istributions measured in simulations by Mapelli et al. ( 2012 ) of fragmenting disc for a Sgr A \u2217 type SMBH. For different gas asses and thermodynamic assumptions, they measure an IMF lope ranging from \u223c \u22120.5 to \u22121.6. In another related set of imulations by Nayakshin, Cuadra & Springel ( 2007 ), fragmentation f a disc around Sgr A \u2217 also produces a top-heavy IMF that is ependent on the stars subsequent accretion of the surrounding as. Such a top-heavy IMF is also supported by observations of biquitous metal enrichment in AGN, which can be produced by upernovae of massive stars (Wang et al. 2011 ; Xu et al. 2018 ; ittmann, Jermyn & Cantiello 2022 ; Lai et al. 2022 ; Toyouchi et al. 022 ). Our choice of a constant SF efficiency (e.g. equation 22 ) requires hat the number of stars formed decreases at outer radii to ensure hat the gas disc is not depleted. The consequence of this is that the tar forming region of the disc is finite, and only a small number of tars form at outer radii, where the heaviest end of the distribution ies. Note that in the case of a higher SF efficiency, the amplitude of he distribution increases according to equation ( 22 ), while the range nd slope of the distribution remains the same. In principle the disc ould extend to larger radii, in which case a higher SF efficiency ould potentially increasing the heavy end of the distribution and he resulting EMRI rate. To keep the model conserv ati ve, we choose o set the outer disc edge to be r out = 0.1 pc, which is also in greement with constraints on disc sizes from observed spectral nergy distributions (see Sirko & Goodman 2003 ). In the case that he efficiency varies with radius, the slope of the IMF will change as will the steady-state M\u0307 profile of the disc). Furthermore, we eglect here the possibility that fragments may merge, an increasing ossibility for cases of higher , which would skew the distribution o higher masses.\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nM\nFigure 8.

For stars moving on prograde, ircular orbits (such that the relative velocity between the orbiter and he gas is negligible), the Bondi\u2013Hoyle accretion rate is given by Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939 ; Bondi & Hoyle 1944 ; Edgar 2004 ) \u02d9 Bondi = \u03c0r 2 B \u03c1c s , (27) here r B = 2 GM \u2217/c 2 s is the accretion radius, which is defined by he region of gravitational influence. This estimate suggests rapid ccretion on to embedded stars, and has been presented as a rapid rowth mechanism for gas-embedded stellar populations (Davies & in 2020 ). In fact, the disc properties derived above suggest a Bondi ccretion rate that exceeds the accretion rate on to the central SMBH, hich would break more than the steady-state disc assumption. o we ver, the Bondi radius is in most cases larger than the disc hickness, and thus the assumption of rapid, spherically symmetric\nNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nnfall is not appropriate, especially if stars grow to larger masses. hile accretion inside the Bondi radius may occur in a superddington configuration \u2013 certain accretion/feedback geometries llow for super-Eddington growth, e.g. a slim disc (Abramowicz t al. 1988 ) or accretion with non-equatorial feedback (Jiang, tone & Davis 2014 ) or reduced radiati ve ef ficiency (Jiang, Stone & avis 2019 ) \u2013 the rate must at least be limited by the amount f gas that can flow into (and stay within) the star\u2019s sphere of nfluence.\nTo demonstrate an outcome of stellar accretion, we apply a odified Bondi rate to the initial population for which the accretion adius is limited to either the star\u2019s Hill radius or the disc thickness, uch that\nacc = 1 2 minimum ( r Hill , h ( r \u2217)) , (28)\nhere r Hill = r \u2217( M \u2217/3 M BH ) 1/3 , h ( r \u2217) is the disc scale height at the stars osition r \u2217, and the factor of 1/2 ensures that the accretion radius is ell within the disc 10 (and consequently so that the rate remains t least an order of magnitude below the disc accretion rate). The ccretion rate is given by\n\u02d9 \u2217 = \u03b7\u03c0r 2 acc \u03c1c s , (29) here we introduce an efficiency factor of \u03b7 = 0.01 to account for mpirical evidence that gas flowing into the sphere of influence does ot guarantee its accretion on to the star. In fact, simulations show hat gas flows past an embedded migrator from the outer to the inner isc (see e.g. Duffell et al. 2014 or Derdzinski et al. 2019 ). Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the stellar mass distribution after 10 7 yr, a time-scale set by the AGN disc lifetime discussed in ection 4 . Here, the accretion rates are determined by the disc roperties at the initial position and updated as the stellar mass ncreases. This assumes the lowest disc densities, leading to a onserv ati ve estimate of the Bondi rate, but also the highest disc hickness, which allows for a larger accretion radius. This accretion ncreases stellar masses by more than two orders of magnitude hroughout the disc lifetime. The result is more pronounced for discs ith \u03b1 = 0.01, for which the higher disc density leads to more rapid rowth (in these cases we limit the stellar masses to 10 4 M ). The hift in peak of the stellar mass distributions for all models is shown n Table 2 .\nWe consider this accretion rate an o v erestimate, giv en that during rowth, stars will likely reach a critical mass beyond which accretion ecomes inefficient due to radiative feedback or momentum-driven inds. The precise limit depends on details of stellar winds, feedback, nd the accretion geometry, but may lie between 30 and 60 M Ekstr \u0308om et al. 2012 ; Cantiello, Jermyn & Lin 2021, although ee Dittmann et al. 2022 ). Due to the uncertainties regarding tellar accretion, in the following section we use the initial mass istribution (shown in Fig. 7 ) as our fiducial population, which s based on the fragment mass limits from equation ( 15 ). As we how, including stellar accretion will alter the final numbers when etermining observational outcomes, but the basic story remains he same: stars of different masses will have different fates due o the interplay of migration, stellar evolution, and tidal disrup-\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nTa bl\ne 2.\nSy st\nem pa\nra m\net er\ns, st\nel la\nr po\npu la\ntio n\nch ar\nac te\nri st\nic s, an\nd E\nM R\nI ra\nte s\nfo r\nea ch\nsu\nbs eq\nue nt di\nsc an\nd m\nig ra\ntio n\nm od\nel .

In the case of disc-embedded stars with near circular orbits, it is more likely that stars are tidally dissolved , or experience Roche lobe overflow (Rossi et al. 2021 ; Dai & Blandford 2013 ; Metzger & Stone 2017 ), and that torques from the disc may complicate the picture. We can conveniently still refer to this event as a TDE.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/3/4522/7078567 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nSUBSEQUENT E VO L U T I O N A N D M I G R AT I O N F AG N STARS\ne now turn to the subsequent migration of AGN stars. PSCs collapse n a time-scale faster than migration (see the dynamical time in ig. 9 ), which allows us to calculate the subsequent evolution of GN stars separately from their formation. We break down the range f outcomes for AGN stars into three categories:\n(i) Tidal \u2018disruption\u2019: Stars migrate inwards until they reach the idal radius where they are destroyed.\n(ii) In-situ EMRIs: Stars migrate inwards until they are accreted y the SMBH, either by a v oiding disruption (depending on the elationship between the SMBH mass and stellar structure) or ollapsing to CRs.\n(iii) Lefto v er stellar population: Stars migrate inwards until the isc disperses, surviving the AGN phase.\nEach of these outcomes is dependent on the mass of the star, he mass of the SMBH, and the disc properties. For this work, we eglect details that would occur as subcategories [e.g. whether an MRI occurs as a star or a specific stellar remnant, it is categorized s outcome (ii)]. Our fiducial model assumes that no further accretion ccurs after star formation, meaning that we adopt initial mass istributions in Fig. 7 and keep the stellar masses constant. We discuss mplications of including stellar accretion (as shown in Section 3.4 ) n Section 6 .\nStars embedded in the disc will excite non-axisymmetric perturbaions that react on the star\u2019s orbit, resulting in an exchange of angular\nomentum that will affect the orbital separation (Goldreich & remaine 1980 ). In the limit of small mass ratio (here neglecting ependencies on gas thermodynamics), this migration regime is eferred to as \u2018Type I,\u2019 and the strength of the (typically inwards) orque on an embedded migrator of mass M \u2217 at a separation r in he isothermal limit can be estimated with the following expression T anaka, T akeuchi & W ard 2002 ):\nI = \u2212 1 2 f I\n( r ) r 4 2 (\nM \u2217 M BH\n)2 ( h\nr\n)\u22122 , (30)\nhere f I is a factor that depends on disc gradients. Rather than solving or r I from our disc solutions that can lead to sign changes in the orque, here we fix f I = 2 to represent a typical inward migration ate. In Appendix A , we discuss the implications of disc gradients for igration reversal. This corresponds to a change in radial separation \u02d9 I = 2 T I /v \u03c6/M \u2217, where v \u03c6 = ( GM BH / r ) 1/2 is the Keplerian orbital elocity.\nIn the classical paradigm, migration slo ws do wn if the migrator arves a gap, reducing the density in the coorbital region, which eakens the migration torque. In our case, gap-opening for AGN tars is unlikely for stars with small mass ratios compared to the entral BH (e.g. for q 10 \u22125 ), as suggested by conventional gappening criteria (Crida, Morbidelli & Masset 2006 ). Furthermore, a umber of numerical studies conducted for self-gravitating discs on arious scales have shown that migration in such systems can be even aster than implied by equation ( 30 ) due to the contribution of torques rom asymmetric flows in the vicinity of the perturber ( Mayer 2013 ;\nalik et al. 2015 ), which either inhibits gap formation completely r at least suppress the formation of a deep gap that can slow down igration sensibly (Szul \u0301agyi, Mayer & Quinn 2017 ). We note that he migration of a population of stars may not be well-represented y expressions that assume a single migrator. Simulations tend to how that while a fraction of fragments tend to migrate inwards at a ate comparable to the Type I rate, other fragments may experience\nNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nigration that slows down or reverses direction (Helled et al. 2014 ). n the inner disc, gap-opening or partial gap-opening may occur, specially if stars are able to accrete and grow. For simplicity, we onsider only inward migration but with two limiting estimates (Type and a slower, gap-corrected expression).\nIn the case that a gap begins to open, numerical simulations find n many cases that the torque on a perturber scales with the reduced urface density in the gap, and can be estimated by (Fung, Shi & hiang 2014 ; Kanagawa, Tanaka & Szuszkiewicz 2018 )\ngap = 1 1 + 0 . 04 K T I , (31)\nhere K = q 2 ( r / h ) 5 \u03b1\u22121 . This estimate takes into account the possibilty of partial gap opening, allowing for a continuous expression for he torque as a function of q and disc parameters. When calculating\nigration rates for the stellar population, we take into account the eduction in gas density due to star formation. This only results in a inor effect for models with high SF efficiency ( = 0.3), for which he migration times increase by a small factor 2. We caution that the abo v e e xpression assumes a non-selfravitating, isothermal accretion disc, and is not tested for all disc roperties or thermodynamics. Furthermore, it is known that gas ynamics in the gap-opening regime become highly non-linear, nd the resulting torque can have non-trivial dependence on disc arameters (Duffell et al. 2014 ), especially when resolving gas close o the perturber (Derdzinski et al. 2019 ) or when gaps are particularly teep (Chen et al. 2020 ). Ho we ver, due to the majority of stellar asses being below the gap-opening threshold, the correction has inor implications for the outcome of AGN stars (discussed in ection 5 ). Additionally, orbital angular momentum loss occurs due to GW adiation from interaction with the central SMBH, which, assuming circular inspiral, results in a separation evolution (Peters 1964 )\n\u02d9 GW = \u221264 5\nG 3\nc 5 ( M BH + M \u2217) 3 (1 + 1 /q)(1 + q) 1 r 3 , (32)\nhere G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light. The time-scale for a star to migrate from its initial separation r i to final separation r f is\nmig = \u222b r f\nr i\n1\nr\u0307 I + \u0307r GW d r, (33)\nssuming that gas-induced migration and GW migration are uncouled. More massive stars migrate faster and reach the inner disc first, espite being born at farther separations. In theory migration should lo w do wn once the star becomes a less massive CR. We neglect his detail here as it will only affect when, not if, the stars produce MRIs. Stars will migrate till they are accreted by the central SMBH or isrupted by tidal forces. Thus, the outcome of stars relies on the nterplay between the migration time-scale and the stellar lifetime. idal disruption 11 occurs if stars reach the tidal radius, or the region\nFigure 9.

Migration times are shown for Type I (dark purple line) and with a gap-opening correction (faded purple line) which significantly slows down migration for higher stellar masses.

For stars more massive than M \u2217/M \u2265 15, we adopt calings from rotating massive stellar models at solar metallicity Ekstr \u0308om et al. 2012 , but see also Yusof et al. 2013 ) for which A = 0.78 and B = 8.00. The final time-scale for comparison is the AGN disc lifetime,\nhich is given by the viscous time at r out , assuming that no additional as is supplied to the disc during the accretion episode:\nAGN = t visc = 2 3\nr 2\n\u03b1c s h \u223c 10 7 yr\n( 0 . 1\n\u03b1\n)( 0 . 02\nh/r )2 (10 6 M M BH )1 / 2 ,\n(37)\nhere we have plugged in the turbulence assumption for kinematic iscosity. The migration times shown in Fig. 9 assume a constant stellar ass, without taking into account that beyond a stellar lifetime, stars become\u2019 a CR of smaller mass. This does not change the migration ime considerably, since most of the migration occurs during the tellar lifetime. The main implication of the remnant mass is whether he EMRI occurs during the AGN disc lifetime or after disc dispersal.\nore massive remnants will inspiral more quickly due to stronger\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nM\nG p\nl w w w s l w i e g m\n( H t s s o t E\n4\nS l o ( W d r a n I i t i w \u223c r ( 2\nt e t G g d t E f w i l g m r e 2\n5\nB A f d\n5\nU w a S i e\n( m m t b F s i\n( m\ni 1 (\nr a t\nt l l u r M\na\nR\nW T s a t l l g C F r t s o p\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/3/4522/7078567 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nW emission, and thus more likely occur while the disc is still resent. In Fig. 9 , we show the time-scales for Type I migration (dark purple ines) from the starting separation to either the tidal radii or to 10 r S , here r S = 2 GM BH / c 2 is the Schwarzschild radius, depending on hich occurs first, as a function of the stellar mass. For comparison e show the dynamical time at the formation radius (grey line), the tellar lifetime (green line), and the AGN disc lifetime (blue dashed ine). Intersections in the lines determine the minimum mass below hich stars do not survive to leave CRs or form EMRIs. Migration s also shown with the gap correction (faded purple lines, using quation 31 ), which slows down migration for stars with mass ratios reater than q 10 \u22126 , suggesting that for each disc model more assive stars survive disruption. Gas-driven migration on its own becomes inefficient at inner radii at r 10 \u22125 pc), where the disc is thick and the gas density is low. o we v er, in this re gime GWs become important and soon dominate he inward migration, leading to comparatively fast migration timecales, around t mig \u223c 10 6 \u2212 10 7 yr depending on the disc model and tellar/remnant mass. In most cases, the migration time to disruption r accretion is less than the stellar lifetime. In the case of disruption, his suggests that stars do not survive to leave CRs or produce in situ MRIs.\n.1 Other migration regimes\nimulations of Type I migration in the non-isothermal and isothermal imits find more detailed expressions for the torque that depend n the density, temperature, and entropy gradients of the disc Tanaka et al. 2002 ; Kley & Crida 2008 ; Paardekooper et al. 2010 ).\nith our disc solutions, we can calculate the torque profiles and etermine for which regions the isothermal or adiabatic torque egimes occur. These calculations and resulting torque profiles re shown in Section A of the Appendix. We find that the magitude of torques is within an order of magnitude of the Type estimate from equation ( 30 ), whether it is in the adiabatic or sothermal regime. More interestingly, our disc solutions suggest he presence of regions where the torque changes direction from nwards (reducing angular momentum of the migrator) to outards (increasing its angular momentum), typically at distances 10 \u221210 2 r S from the SMBH. The intersection of these regions is eferred to as a \u2018migration trap\u2019 in the context of both planets Lyra, Paardekooper & Mac Low 2010 ) and BHs (Bellovary et al. 016 ). If star and/or compact object migration is halted in these regions, his could increase the interaction rate between migrators (Secunda t al. 2019 ). Ho we ver, it is likely that migration continues due o other processes and that such traps are not sustained (e.g. W emission). In particular, the highly dynamic regime of selfravitating discs is unlikely to preserve any feature requiring a elicate torque balance. Moti v ated by the latter, we neglect migration raps in our calculation of the stellar orbital evolution and resulting MRI rate. Instead, we adopt the assumption that migration is ast, inw ards, and rapid, following the scaling in equation ( 30 ), hich is a choice more in line, qualitatively, with how migration s currently understood in self-gravitating discs. Type I migration eads to a conserv ati ve in situ EMRI rate, as the inclusion of the ap correction or traps will delay the migration of stars, providing ore time for them to collapse to CRs. It is also supported by ecurring evidence of fast migration in discs with GI (e.g. Malik t al. 2015 , but see the code comparison paper by Fletcher et al. 019 ).\nNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nO U T C O M E O F T H E AG N STAR POPULATIO N\ny comparing the migration time-scales to stellar lifetimes and GN disc lifetimes, we can categorize outcomes of AGN stars. We ocus primarily on in situ EMRIs before briefly touching on tidal issolution events (TDEs) and leftover stellar populations.\n.1 In situ gas-embedded EMRIs\nnder the assumption that no additional gas is fed to the disc, e calculate a minimum EMRI rate per AGN during an isolated\nccretion episode. Such a scenario is plausible if accretion on to the MBH produces feedback that inhibits additional gas from falling nto the SMBH Bondi radius. The rate is an underestimate if SMBHs xperience multiple episodes of accretion over longer time-scales.\nThe in situ EMRI rate depends on the efficiency of star formation how much of the gas turns into stars within r frag ), the stellar ass distribution (determined by disc properties), and subsequent igration rates. From one star formation event, we can quantify the otal number of stars formed as N \u2217 (equation 21 ). Whether stars ecome EMRIs is determined by the time-scale comparisons in ig. 9 . In order to be accreted by the SMBH within the disc lifetime, tars must satisfy three constraints that depend on their masses and nitial separations:\n(i) Stars migrate towards the SMBH with the AGN disc lifetime t mig < \u03c4AGN ), which means that their mass must be abo v e a critical ass M i . (ii) Stars a v oid disruption because the tidal radius (equation 34 ) s within the regime where they become GW sources ( r tidal < 0 r S ( M BH )). This translates to their mass being below a limit M ii e.g. as shown in Fig. 9 for M BH = 10 7 M ).\n(iii) Stars a v oid disruption because they collapse to CRs before eaching the tidal radius ( \u03c4 \u2217 < t mig ), which requires that their masses re greater than a limit M iii so that their lifetime is more rapid than he migration time.\nIn other words, EMRIs originate from stars where the migration ime-scale (solid purple lines in Fig. 9 ) is less than the AGN disc ifetime, excluding regions where stars are disrupted (dashed purple ines). The total number of EMRIs per AGN is given by summing p the stars from the mass distributions (e.g. Fig. 7 ) within the mass ange that satisfies these conditions, such that N emri = N \u2217[( M \u2217 > i ) and (( M \u2217 < M ii ) or ( M \u2217 > M iii ))]. Over an accretion disc lifetime \u03c4AGN , the in situ EMRI rate per ccretion episode is\nemri = N emri /\u03c4AGN . (38) e show this EMRI rate for all disc models in Fig. 10 and in\nable 2 . Not all models produce in situ EMRIs. Specifically, the urvi v al of stars in the 10 6 M BH disc model is sensitive to ssumptions of stellar accretion and migration. Stars formed in his system are at lower masses, and efficient (Type I) migration eads to their disruption within \u223c 10 6 yr. If stars can accrete to arger masses, ho we ver, or if migration slo ws do wn due to partial ap-opening, this allows for a subset of the population to produce Rs. In these cases, the EMRI rate is R emri \u223c 10 \u22127 \u2212 10 \u22125 yr \u22121 . or disc models with larger SMBH masses, in situ EMRIs occur at ates R emri \u223c 10 \u22125 \u2212 10 \u22124 yr \u22121 depending on the disc properties, he torque prescription, and the SF efficiency. The inclusion of tellar accretion boosts the EMRI rate, in some cases by an order f magnitude. The effect of the gap-correction is less clear: in rinciple it allows for more massive stars to survive disruption\nFigure 10. EMRI rate per AGN, for discs with f Edd = 0.1 with a star formation efficiency = 0.01. Solid symbols show rates for discs with viscosity parameter \u03b1 = 0.1, hollow symbols for discs with \u03b1 = 0.01. We include the EMRI rate for discs models with Type I migration (diamonds), Type I migration plus stellar accretion (hexagons) gap-corrected migration (circles), gap-corrected migration plus stellar accretion (squares).

In practice, most stars are below the mass where the gaporrection becomes rele v ant, as sho wn in Section 3 , unless they ccrete substantially. The higher viscosity disc (with \u03b1 = 0.1) for BH = 10 7 M produces more EMRIs, despite the stars having slower igration times. This is due to the lower density discs producing arger numbers of less massive stars that can a v oid disruption. In similar fashion, models with high SF efficiency lead to a higher MRI rate, simply by increasing the number of massive stars that urvive to seed EMRIs. We note that by limiting the disc size to 0.1 pc, we also limit the umber of massive stars that form, and in turn limit the EMRI rate. e expect these rates will increase for larger discs that experience igher SF efficiencies. On the other hand, these rates may decrease f one considers mutual gravitational scattering between stars/BHs, hich may preserve some stars from disruption but also lose potential MRIs (Forgan et al. 2018 ). Interactions between BHs which can erge with each other via gas-assisted binary formation (Tagawa t al. 2020a ) could also decrease the rate, while producing higher ass EMRIs (or IMRIs). The rates we find are in agreement with the rate of in situ MRIs predicted by the models of Dittmann & Miller ( 2020 ). or further comparison, Pan & Yang ( 2021 ), compute EMRI rates ue to interactions of nuclear cluster stellar/BH population with a assiv e accretion disc. F or the \u2018conv entional\u2019 EMRI scenario in ry nuclei (via two-body interactions), they find EMRI rates around 10 \u22126 [yr \u22121 ] per galactic nuclei. In the presence of a gas disc, he EMRI rate typically increases to \u223c 10 \u22126 \u201310 \u22125 yr \u22121 per AGN, ith an order of magnitude variance depending on the mass of the MBH and the model parameters. These numbers are in line with ur calculations for models that produce EMRIs, suggesting that he in situ channel can generate EMRIs at a comparable rate to the rbit-capture channel.\nTagawa et al. ( 2020a ) consider the evolution of a population f stellar cluster stars and BHs that are captured into binaries in n AGN disc. This work is focused on the evolution of stellar ass binaries via gas-assisted mergers, but also predicts a conequent EMRI rate 0 . 1 \u2212 0 . 6 Gpc \u22123 yr \u22121 . For comparison, we can xpress the EMRI rate in terms of the central SMBH accretion ate: R m = N emri / M\u0307 BH ( \u03c4AGN ) M \u22121 . This can be used to derive a olumetric in situ EMRI rate \u02dc R = R m M\u0307 SMBHs , where M\u0307 SMBHs is n estimate of the total accretion on to all SMBHs in the local niverse. Calculations by Marconi et al. ( 2004 ) suggest M\u0307 SMBHs \u223c \u00d7 10 \u22126 \u2212 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M yr \u22121 Gpc \u22123 for z \u223c 0 to 1, respectively neglecting variance in f Edd or dependence on SMBH mass). For ur model, the per-AGN EMRI rates for the 10 6 M SMBH vary rom R emri \u223c 10 \u22127 \u201310 \u22125 yr \u22121 for an SMBH accretion rate f Edd = .1. Using the abo v e, we deriv e a ( z \u223c 0) volumetric rate of \u02dc = R emri M\u0307 SMBHs / M\u0307 BH \u223c 0 . 5 \u201310 yr \u22121 Gpc \u22123 , though we caution hat the true rate will be more dependent on the fraction of AGN hat are near-Eddington. This simple estimate suggests that the in itu EMRI rate may be comparable to or greater than the rate derived ia AGN-disc assisted binary capture. Note that these rates do not necessarily correspond to the detectable ate, given that the more massive SMBH in our disc models roduces EMRIs with GW frequencies too low to be detectable y LISA. Detectable EMRIs via dynamical processes (e.g. two body ncounters) in dry nuclei are expected to occur at a rate 10 \u2212 10 3 yr \u22121 ccording to Babak et al. ( 2017 ). Overall our results suggests an dditional boost to the EMRI rate driven by in situ formation in uf ficiently massi ve accretion discs.\n.2 Final distribution of stars and CRs\nhile most stars are disrupted or accreted by the central SMBH, a ortion of the population can be left o v er after disc dispersal if the igration time-scale is longer than the disc lifetime. This occurs for ower mass stars in discs with higher viscosity parameter \u03b1 = 0.1 or lower densities) for which the accretion lifetime t AGN \u223c 10 7 yr. he maximum mass of these remnant populations scales with the ass of the the central SMBH. For the central SMBH masses of 10 6 , 10 7 , 10 8 } M SMBH, stars with masses below { 0.1, 2, 50 } M urvive the disc phase, respectively. These ranges may change if the tars accrete substantially during their evolution, since an increase n mass will affect the migration rate. Accounting for more complex igration scenarios, such as the possibility of migration traps or, ven more likely, the mutual gravitational interactions between GN stars concurrently with disc-driven migration, would diminish he importance of conditions at birth for the stellar population. urthermore, given that we only consider a single AGN activity ycle, one should be careful not to compare our results directly to bserved stellar populations (e.g. stellar discs around Sgr A \u2217) around MBHs that may have a more complex accretion history.\n.3 Tidal disruption\nhen determining the in situ EMRI rate, we exclude \u2018disrupted\u2019 stars ince the outcome of disruption depends on the stellar structure. t is likely that rather than being promptly disrupted, these stars xperience Roche Lobe overflow (Metzger & Stone 2017 ) which may r may not be stable, depending on the impact of the accretion disc. or the 10 6 M SMBH discs in particular, surviving tidal forces from he central SMBH is the main obstacle for in situ stellar populations. hese stars might be rele v ant for the production of Quasi-periodic ruptions (Metzger, Stone & Gilbaum 2022 ) or some version of\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nM\nT s t\n6\nI a e d o o w a m o S d l c s m\nt i ( o w o s D r p\na c f m m s e d 2 r\nw I 2 d a s d t 3 t s\n1\ns e f\na T L s T s W t t a o f\nd t s y o b t K a i c c s i e d\nb a a f d l n G a t S f f i d p a d\nf v r T E a b\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/3/4522/7078567 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nDEs, 13 which we plan to investigate in a follow-up paper. If these tars survive partial disruptions, they may continue to migrate into he inner disc and potentially increase the in situ EMRI rate.\nDISCUSSION\nn this work, we show that GI in radiatively efficient, massive ccretion discs produces unique stellar populations. Subsequent volution of embedded stars can lead to three outcomes: tidal estruction of stars, accretion of stars (or their remnants) as EMRIs, r lefto v er stars after disc dispesral. The outcome primarily depends n the interplay of the stellar lifetime and migration time-scales, hich are dependent on the disc structure. Of course, not all AGNs re the same \u2013 accretion rates and geometry can vary, and our fiducial odel is one of many. We demonstrate that within a single disc model, bservables such as the in situ EMRI rate are dependent on the host MBH and accretion rate. Our disc model is appropriate for massive iscs with near-Eddington inflow rates, or quasars, and not lowuminosity, radiati vely inef ficient accretion flows which are more ommon in the local Universe. A proper volumetric rate calculation hould take into account the quasar population as a function of SMBH ass and redshift. Our work complements previous studies on in situ stellar populaions in AGN accretion discs which also suggest that star formation n AGN discs should produce stellar populations with large masses Goodman & Tan 2004 ; Levin 2007 ). One critical difference in ur work is that we neglect the interaction between in situ stars, hich may merge with each other. We hypothesize that the realistic utcome is likely a combination of the two. The interaction between tars could reduce the EMRI rate, yet lead to more massive EMRIs. etermining at what rate stars merge or evolve independently will equire a thorough investigation of the mutual interactions within the opulation. In another sense our model is conserv ati ve, gi ven that we adopt\nrelatively low star formation efficiency for the environment onsidered ( = 1 per cent ) as well as corrections to the initial ragment masses. Both of these ingredients act to reduce the ass of the stellar population. Even under these constraints, our odels predict that each accretion episode can produce a combined tellar mass of \u223c10 2 \u201310 4 M during a single isolated accretion pisode. SMBHs may experience several accretion episodes, or active uty cycles, during their cosmological evolution (Hopkins et al. 016 ), which will have implications for the cosmological EMRI ate.\nSeveral recent works consider how stellar evolution may vary hen embedded in a denser, hotter environment than the typical SM (Cantiello et al. 2021 ; Dittmann et al. 2021 ; Jermyn et al. 021 , 2022 ). These models predict a range of evolutionary outcomes epending on the initial distance of the star to the central SMBH, the ccretion mechanism, and chemical mixing. Their choice of initially olar mass stars is consistent with the range of initial stellar masses erived in this work for discs around 10 6 M SMBHs, ho we ver he density in our disc models is considerably higher (by at least or more orders of magnitude), which is beyond the capability of he numerical stellar evolution codes employed in those works. How tellar evolution is altered in higher density environments (along with\nNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\n3 Depending on the mass loss rate of the star and its interior structure, the tellar orbit may evolve adiabatically as its internal density readjusts (Rossi t al. 2021 ), allowing stars to recede from the SMBH. Ho we ver, the torques rom global gas disc will alter this evolution.\na a e t e S\nspherical accretion or radiative feedback) remains to be explored. he expected outcome based on the models by Cantiello, Jermyn & inCantiello et al. is that stars will accrete rapidly but also eject tellar winds. This ultimately limits their growth to \u223c10s \u2013100s M . he constant supply of fuel can lead to a population of \u2018immortal tars\u2019, particularly in the inner disc region (Jermyn et al. 2022 ). e expect that incorporating this aspect into this work will affect he population of stars that survive tidal disruption by increasing heir lifetime, though in reality this will depend on nuances of ccretion and feedback. Overall these works highlight the importance f understanding the interplay between stellar evolution, accretion, eedback, and migration.\nA strong prediction of GI is an initial increase in mass inflow ue to the generation of structures that increase angular momentum ransport. This is supported at different scales: One example at tellar scales arises from observations of FU Ori stars, which are oung stellar objects that demonstrate rapid increases in brightness v er short time-scales (Herbig 1977 ). These flares are interpreted as oosts in the accretion rate on to the star, which can be explained by heir accretion discs becoming gravitationally unstable (Hartmann & enyon 1996 ; Liu et al. 2016 ). Analogously, we expect that the ccretion episodes described in this work should occur with an nitially high luminosity that decreases as a portion of the gas is onverted into stars. In this case the assumption of a steady-state, onstant M\u0307 disc model is not necessarily valid o v er long timecales, for which the accretion rate will increase once the instability s triggered, then decrease as gas is depleted. Future work will xplore how the time dependence of the accretion rate affects the isc geometry and stellar outcomes. Our work supports the idea that accretion discs in AGN can oost the expected EMRI rate, not only by orbit capture of stars nd BHs in the nucleus (Pan et al. 2021 ; Pan & Yang 2021 ), but lso by in situ fragmentation. While we consider in situ EMRIs or a range of SMBH masses, only a subset of these will be etectable by future milliHz detectors. For LISA, the sensitivity ies in the \u223c 10 \u22124 \u20131 Hz range (neglecting the details of detector oise as a function of frequency). A circular inspiral generates Ws at a frequency that is twice the orbital frequency, which is t most f GW = / \u03c0 \u2248 4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 Hz ( M BH / 10 6 M ) 1 / 2 ( 3 r S /r) 3 / 2 for he final inspiral around a non-spinning SMBH. For the higher MBH mass of 10 8 M , a circular EMRI will merge at lower requencies which fall outside of the mHz band. LISA will be ideal or detecting EMRIs around less massive host SMBHs, for which n situ generation is critically dependent on whether stars survive isruption. In models where stars grow via a limited Bondi accretion rescription (reaching modest stellar masses \u223c10M ), this occurs t a rate that is comparable to that expected for EMRIs formed via ynamical estimates. Gas-embedded inspirals present an exciting class of GW sources or future milliHz detectors. Whether they are captured by the disc ia orbit intersections or born in the environment in situ , their envionmental evolution leads to distinguishable orbital characteristics: hese events will have typically lower eccentricity compared to MRIs formed via purely dynamical processes and possible spin lignment with the central SMBH (depending on the alignment of oth constituent BHs with the accretion plane). If several events re detected, the population properties will be skewed by their ccretion and migration history. Individual events also present the xciting possibility of detecting signatures of their environment in he GW signal (Kocsis et al. 2011 ; Yunes et al. 2011 ; Barausse t al. 2014 ; Derdzinski et al. 2019 , 2021 ; Zwick et al. 2022 ; Amaroeoane et al. 2023 ), which will allow us to constrain properties\no a\n6\nT\nQ s r v e b s e a m S o m\n( e a r W o\nm o f c 2 r c i o e l\nn o w i w D a ( A t t g s s l o g\nm s t\nt P M f V s F r w\n7\nW a t t F m a\nu i S\n0 1 e w\ns a o\ni t s i s\no p E s r c\nt p m w\nt \u223c s a d i\nS t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/3/4522/7078567 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nf AGN discs in regions that are electromagnetically unresolvble.\n.1 Caveats and future considerations\nhere are many aspects of the picture that deserve further exploration. Our model assumes a simplified, marginally stable disc where = Q 0 , which implicitly assumes that some feedback mechanism\nupports the disc against further collapse. In reality, Q will have adial and temporal dependence that must be solved consistently with arious forms of feedback, e.g. from star formation or accretion on to mbedded objects. (see e.g. the feedback-dominated accretion model y Gilbaum & Stone 2021 ). This also means that the SF efficiency hould have a radial dependence [e.g. as in the model of Thompson t al. ( 2005 ) or the simulations by Mapelli et al. 2012 ], which will ffect the resulting stellar mass distribution. Such considerations ay be critical for understanding the SF in discs around less massive MBHs, for which fragmentation occurs within the transition from ptically thick to thin gas (see the opacity profile of the 10 6 M disc odel). Simulations of fragmenting protoplanetary discs by Boley et al. 2010 ) and Cha & Nayakshin ( 2011 ) find that clumps form on ccentric orbits. If stars are born on initially eccentric orbits, this will ffect the subsequent accretion rate (more so if it is dependent on elativ e v elocity with the local gas, as in Bondi) and orbital evolution.\ne plan to consider in more detail the initial conditions of stellar rbits and their effect on subsequent evolution in future work. Furthermore, the stellar distribution in the disc that arises in our odel will be rele v ant only for a limited time. As the gas content f the disc diminishes due to fragmentation and accretion onto the ragments and the central AGN, stars and BHs can still evolve as a ollection of objects mutually interacting via gravity (Boley et al. 010 ; Zhu et al. 2012 ), essentially as a collisional system. Two-body elaxation and resonant relaxation would occur, as they do in star lusters, and potentially generate more EMRIs. This will have to be nvestigated in a future work, though, as the phase space structure f the collisional disc that would have to be modelled is not a trivial xtension of the case of star clusters, which is widely studied in the iterature.\nWe have considered only one stage of GI. Over longer time-scales, ew gas could flow into the nucleus and replenish the outer regions f the AGN disc, triggering another episode of fragmentation. This ill be more likely to happen at higher redshift, as more frequent nteractions between the host galaxy and smaller galactic companions ill trigger gas inflows (Callegari et al. 2011 ; Capelo et al. 2015 ). ynamical instabilities in the nuclear region of the host galaxy, such s nuclear bars, could also trigger repeated episodes of gas inflows Shlosman, Frank & Begelman 1989 ; Hopkins & Quataert 2011 ). t a minimum, such episodes would occur on a duty cycle of order he orbital time of the nuclear region. The latter time-scale is in he range 10 6 \u2212 10 7 yr at scales of 100 pc \u22121 kpc for a gas-rich alaxy (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2016 ). Hence, our EMRI rate estimate hould be taken as a conserv ati ve estimate, as se v eral c ycles of in itu star formation such as that modelled here could occur during the ifetime of a massive gas-rich galaxy. It is only between these cycles f gas replenishment that the system will evolve as a collisional ravitational system with a lesser role of gas. Finally, a word of caution should also be spent about the way igration is treated in our model. Indeed, we are assuming the tandard picture of linear torques, but it is known that disc-driven orques are considerably more complicated. F or e xample, stochastic\norques arise in both self-gravitating discs (Baruteau, Meru & aardekooper 2011 ) and turbulent, magnetized discs (Nelson 2005 ). igration rates can also be affected by the local thermal feedback rom the star or an accreting BH (Hankla, Jiang & Armitage 2020 ; elasco Romero & Masset 2020 ) or mechanical feedback from tellar winds (Gruzinov, Levin & Matzner 2020 ; Li et al. 2020 ). urthermore, changes to the initial mass distribution, such as those esulting from the inclusion of magnetic fields (e.g. Deng et al. 2020 ), ill affect the subsequent migration rates.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne present self-consistent models of geometrically thin, steady-state, nd near-Eddington accretion discs around SMBHs. By calculating he disc structure and corresponding cooling rates, we determine he conditions for fragmentation and resulting protostar properties. or a set of SMBH masses, disc viscosities, accretion rates, and igration estimates, we quantify the initial stellar mass distribution nd a resulting EMRI rate. Our results are summarized as follows:\n(i) For the parameters considered, discs become gravitationally nstable at subparsec distances. Rapid cooling and fragmentation nto protostars occurs at a few \u00d710 \u22123 \u2212 10 \u22122 pc from the central MBH, and extends up to r \u223c 0 . 1 pc. (ii) Initial stellar mass distributions are top-heavy and peak at .1 \u22121 M for discs around M BH = 10 6 M , 1 \u221210 M for M BH = 0 7 M , and 10 \u221210 2 M for M BH = 10 8 M . Assuming an SF fficiency of 1 per cent, fragmentation results in N \u2217 10 2 \u221210 3 stars ith a relatively flat mass distribution slope of d N/ d m \u221d M \u22120 . 7 \u2217 . (iii) Subsequent accretion on to stars via a limited Bondi precription (which preserves the steady-state assumption of the global ccretion disc) results in stars increasing their masses by \u223c2 orders f magnitude o v er the AGN disc lifetime of \u223c 10 7 yr. (iv) We calculate the time-scale for stars to migrate from their nitial positions to the 10 Schwarzschild radii, where they are either idally disrupted or accreted by the central SMBH. Migration of the tellar population leads to three outcomes: tidal disruption of stars, n situ EMRIs with the central SMBH, or lefto v er stars at subparsec eparations from the central SMBH.\n(v) The rate of in situ EMRIs produced via the orbital evolution f these stellar populations is R emri \u223c 0 \u2212 10 \u22124 yr \u22121 per AGN er SMBH accretion episode. Not all models considered produce MRIs: for M BH = 10 6 M , stars need to survive tidal disruption, o EMRIs only occur when stars are able to grow to 10 M . Our ate is an underestimate for SMBHs that experience multiple activity ycles.\n(vi) EMRI rates are dependent on the SF efficiency, stellar accreion, and migration prescription. Rates will increase if star formation roduces a higher number of massive stars, or if deviations from igration occur that slow down the migration of stars towards radii here they become victim to tidal forces. (vii) Our disc models suggest the presence of migration traps due o changes in density and temperature gradients. These occur at 50 \u2212300 r S , depending on the strength of viscosity ( \u03b1). At smaller eparations, the orbital evolution of stars/BHs in these regions will lso be go v erned by GW emission, and thus the traps only slow own their inevitable inspiral. For the more distant traps, the delay n inward migration may be more substantial.\nAGN-born star populations may be diverse depending on the host MBH and the gas supply, suggesting that this process will vary\nhroughout cosmological history as SMBHs grow.\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nM\nA\nW m S T f t a R N e\nD\nT f\nR\nA\nA A A A A A B B B B B B B B\nB\nB B B C\nC C\nC C C C C C D D D D D D D\nD\nD D\nD\nD\nD\nE E F\nF\nF F\nF F F G G\nG G G G G G\nG G G H\nH H H H\nH H H H\nH\nH\nH H\nH H I I J J\nJ J J K K K K K\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/3/4522/7078567 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne are grateful to the referee, Doug Lin, for his insightful coments that impro v ed this work.

These estimates are tested in simulations for the case of fully nsaturated co-rotation torque (rele v ant for discs with high viscosity, aardekooper & Papaloizou 2009 ), in the non-isothermal (Kley & rida 2008 ) and isothermal (Tanaka et al. 2002 ; Paardekooper et al. 010 ) limits. In this case, the Type I torque in the locally isothermal egime is given by (Paardekooper et al. 2010 )\niso /T 0 = 0 . 85 \u2212 \u03b1T \u2212 0 . 9 \u03b2T , (A1) here \u03b1T = \u2212 d ln d ln r , \u03b2T = \u2212 d ln T mid d ln r , and the normalization is 0 = q 2 ( r\nh\n)2 r 4 2 , (A2)\nhere is the orbital frequency of the migrator, q = M \u2217/ M BH is he mass ratio, and the disc properties correspond to those at the\nigrator\u2019s position r . In the adiabatic limit, the torque follows\nT ad /T 0 = 0 . 85 \u2212 \u03b1T \u2212 1 . 7 \u03b2T \u2212 7 . 9 \u03be/\u03b3, (A3) here \u03be = \u03b2T \u2212 ( \u03b3 \u2212 1) \u03b1T . Following Lyra et al. ( 2010 ), we nterpolate between the two torque regimes to obtain the total torque:\ntotal /T 0 = T ad \u03b2 2 crit + T iso\n(1 + \u03b2crit ) 2 (A4)\nhere \u03b2crit = t cool / t dyn is the ratio of the radiative cooling timescale o the dynamical timescale, t dyn = 2 \u03c0 / , and t cool is defined in ection 2.2 . In Fig. A1 , we plot this Type I torque as a function of radius for he isothermal, adiabatic, and interpolated regimes. While the torque s typically ne gativ e (inwards), there are regions where the torque\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nFigure A1. The absolute value of the Type I torque profiles normalized by T 0 . Red highlighted regions show where the torque is positive (outwards) due to changes in the density and temperature gradients. The total torque (solid black line) is a combination of adiabatic and isothermal, depending on the disc cooling rate. Top panel : For M6 and \u03b1 = 0.01: In the inner regions where gas is optically thick, radiative timescales are long and migration is in the adiabatic regime, resulting in a migration trap at \u223c300 r S . Bottom panel : M6 and \u03b1 = 0.1. the disc density is lower, so the total torque is in between the adiabatic and isothermal regimes. The migration trap occurs at smaller radii ( \u223c50 r S ) due to changes in the cooling rate.

In regions where the cooling is rapid ( \u03b2crit < 1), the torque converges to the isothermal assumption. Conversely n regions where the the optical depth is high, the torque is in the diabatic regime. T ad is typically weaker than the T iso at intermediate adii, but becomes stronger and positive at inner radii in regions here radiation pressure becomes important. The transition from ne gativ e (inwards) to positive (outwards) orque suggests the presence of migration traps in the inner disc, or egions where torques cancel and several migrators may congregate, s discussed in (Bellovary et al. 2016 ; Lyra et al. 2010 ). We aution that studies adopted to identify these thermodynamical ffects on the torques are based on simulations of non-self-gravitating iscs. Ho we ver, outward migration has been observed also in selfravitating discs, especially in adiabatic conditions (Durisen et al. 007 ; Szul \u0301agyi et al. 2017 ). We note that similar disc models by an et al. ( 2021 ) claim that no migration traps occur \u2013 ho we ver, he models considered in these works do not include the adiabatic omponent of the torque, which leads to a torque transition in the nner disc region. Their work also demonstrates that the inclusion of ther torque components (such as from an accretion head wind, not onsidered here), may also affect the robustness of migration traps.\nTraps do not al w ays halt the migration of embedded stars, if GW mission becomes rele v ant in the regions where traps occur. While he gas torque becomes weaker at smaller separations, the angular\nomentum loss due to GW emission becomes stronger, eventually omparable to or greater than the gas torque ( \u0307r GW > r\u0307 gas at a few \u00d7 0 r S , depending on the binary mass). Thus, the inclusion of GW mission o v er suf ficiently long timescales can e v entually ne gate an y ong-term effect of migration traps. In cases where traps occur around 0 r S , rather than being \u2018traps,\u2019 they are regions where the gas torque hanges sign and migration stalls . The o v erall inward migration lo ws do wn but continues and is e ventually dominated by GWs.\nEven if traps only slow down inward migration, their effect has ore significance in cases where stars are vulnerable to subsequent\nisruption. Traps occur outside the regime where tidal forces will estroy embedded stars. For the M BH = 10 6 M disc model, this has mplications for the number of stars that seed potential EMRIs. In his case traps may aide the survi v al of embedded stars, especially in ases where they occur at larger radii ( \u223c300 r S for \u03b1 = 0.01), where he GW emission is weak ( \u0307r GW (300 r S ) / \u0307r I \u223c 10 \u22125 ). This would lead o a delay in migration that could allow stars to survive and produce Rs, increasing the EMRI rate. We leave the quantification of this o future work, since one should also consider the mutual interaction f stars that will occur if they congregate in migration traps.\nn 19 January 2024\nMNRAS 521, 4522\u20134543 (2023)\nFigure A2.
