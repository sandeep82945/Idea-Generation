Comparative Effectiveness Research on Global Scale: Expanding the scope of this research to include a global comparison of anticancer drug costs and clinical benefits across different healthcare systems. This could involve analyzing how price negotiations, drug reimbursement policies, and healthcare system structures affect the cost-effectiveness and accessibility of anticancer drugs in various countries.

Longitudinal Studies on Drug Pricing and Clinical Outcomes: Conducting longitudinal studies to track the impact of drug price negotiations over time, especially focusing on long-term clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. This could also include evaluating how changes in drug pricing policies affect the introduction and adoption of innovative anticancer drugs in the healthcare system.

In-depth Pharmacoeconomic Analyses: Developing more comprehensive pharmacoeconomic analyses that include not only cost-effectiveness but also budget impact analyses, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and other health economic metrics. This could help in better understanding the value proposition of anticancer drugs and inform more sustainable drug pricing and reimbursement strategies.

Real-World Evidence (RWE) and Outcomes-Based Research: Leveraging real-world evidence to assess the actual clinical and economic impact of anticancer drugs post-market. This includes using data from electronic health records, patient registries, and other sources to validate the efficacy and value of drugs in real-world settings, which may differ from controlled trial environments.

Patient-Centered Value Frameworks in Drug Evaluation: Developing and integrating patient-centered value frameworks into the evaluation of anticancer drugs. This involves considering patient preferences, quality of life, and other subjective measures of drug effectiveness and satisfaction. It also includes assessing the impact of drug pricing and reimbursement policies on patient access, adherence, and outcomes.
