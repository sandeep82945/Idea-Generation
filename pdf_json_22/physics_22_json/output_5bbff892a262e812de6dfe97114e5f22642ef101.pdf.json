    "abstractText": "The interplay between dissipation, topology, and sensitivity to boundary conditions has recently attracted tremendous amounts of attention at the level of effective non-Hermitian descriptions. Here we exactly solve a quantum mechanical Lindblad master equation describing a dissipative topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain of fermions for both open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC). We find that the extreme sensitivity on the boundary conditions associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect is directly reflected in the rapidities governing the time evolution of the density matrix giving rise to a Liouvillian skin effect. This leads to several intriguing phenomena including boundary sensitive damping behavior, steady state currents in finite periodic systems, and diverging relaxation times in the limit of large systems. We illuminate how the role of topology in these systems differs in the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian limit and the full master equation framework.",

Here we exactly solve a quantum mechanical Lindblad master equation describing a dissipative topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain of fermions for both open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC). We find that the extreme sensitivity on the boundary conditions associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect is directly reflected in the rapidities governing the time evolution of the density matrix giving rise to a Liouvillian skin effect. This leads to several intriguing phenomena including boundary sensitive damping behavior, steady state currents in finite periodic systems, and diverging relaxation times in the limit of large systems. We illuminate how the role of topology in these systems differs in the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian limit and the full master equation framework.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.023160\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTopological phenomena in the non-Hermitian (NH) realm has attracted ample interest during the past few years [1\u20133]. Compared to their conventional Hermitan counterparts [4\u20136], NH effective Hamiltonians exhibit an entirely different catalog of gapped and gapless topological phases [1\u20133,7\u201314]. The arguably most dramatic effect is caused by a macroscopic piling up of eigenstates at the boundaries of the system [15\u201317], leading to a spectral sensitivity that grows exponentially with system size when coupling the boundaries [18]. This phenomenology has been dubbed the NH skin effect [19] whereby the celebrated bulk-boundary correspondence in Hermitian systems is replaced by a dichotomy described by either non-Bloch band invariants [19] or in terms of a biorthogonal bulk boundary correspondence [18]. This has led to a blossoming field of research [3,15\u201345].\nExperiments displaying the NH bulk-boundary correspondence have so far been limited to classical systems including mechanical [40,41], electrical [42,43], and photonic [44,45] platforms. Moreover, the remarkable sensitivity to boundary conditions has recently been suggested to be harnessed in applications such as NH topological sensors [38], and a quantum input-output theory of such systems has been developed [46,47]. A fully consistent quantum mechanical description\n*fan.yang@fysik.su.se \u2020qingdong.jiang@sjtu.edu.cn \u2021emil.bergholtz@fysik.su.se\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nin terms of Lindbland master equations [48] appropriate for Markovian dissipative systems [49\u201354] has earlier been studied and fruitfully employed in the context of preparing or stabilizing Hermitian topological phases [55\u201359]. Recent pioneering work has highlighted that also in such fully quantum mechanically consistent descriptions, the sensitivity to boundary conditions remains [60\u201367], but it is fair to say that a comprehensive understanding is still lacking.\nHere we advance the understanding of this problem by providing a complete analytical solution of a class of dissipative fermionic chains for both open and periodic boundary conditions (Fig. 1). Remarkably, we find that there is a NH SSH Hamiltonian HS (2.8) that fully diagonalizes the Liouvillian: All normal modes can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates\n2643-1564/2022/4(2)/023160(19) 023160-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nHS, and the rapidities, \u03b2m, of the Liouvillian are simply related to the energy eigenvalues Em of HS as\n\u03b2m = const + iEm. (1.1) This directly implies that the topological properties and the skin effect of HS carry over to the quantum context, including fluctuations and quantum jumps, although the interpretation, as we illustrate, is somewhat altered and there is no skin effect in the steady state reached at sufficiently long times.\nThe effective Hamiltonian, Heff, of our dissipative model ignoring quantum jumps is also of the form of a NH SSH model in Eq. (2.57) though the effective parameters reflect different aspects of the underlying dissipation as illustrated in Fig. 2. Using recent insights into exactly solving the full set of eigenstates and eigenvalues of NH SSH models [34], this allows us to carry out a detailed study of dynamical phenomena in the Lindblad setting, comparing to the much more studied NH phenomenology and revealing several interesting features, including anomalous damping behavior and diverging relaxation times (in large systems).\nThe structure of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the fermionic bond-dissipative SSH model in a Majorana fermion representation. The exact solutions to the quadratic Lindbladian, which can be mapped to a generalized NH SSH chain up to a total rapidity shift,\nare constructed according to the periodic and open boundary conditions. We point out the differences and links between the full Liouvillian spectrum and the energy spectrum of the truncated effective Hamiltonian that neglects quantum jumps. In Sec. III, we analyze the configurations of the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). When the boundary is closed, the Liouvillian gap vanishes in an intermediate window of hopping amplitudes and a persistent current flow is identified there. In Sec. IV, we discuss the Liouvillian skin effects in an open quantum system. The anomalous quantum dynamics are manifested in the relaxation of the current, the modulated damping behavior, and the lifetime dependence of an edge mode on the system size."

            "text": "Our model is built on a bond-dissipative SSH chain of spinless fermions, shown in Fig. 1. There are hopping terms along the chain with alternating amplitudes t1 and t2: H = \u2211 j t1a\u2020j,Aa j,B + t2a\u2020j+1,Aa j,B + H.c. In the presence of single-particle loss and gain bond dissipations, the set of Lindblad operators takes the general form: Ll = \u2211( j,\u03b1) f l( j,\u03b1)a j,\u03b1 and Lg = \u2211( j,\u03b1) f g( j,\u03b1)a\u2020j,\u03b1 . a\u2020j,\u03b1 (a j,\u03b1) creates (annihilates) a fermion in the jth unit cell that belongs to the sublattice \u03b1 = A or B and they satisfy the fermionic anticommutation relations: {a j,\u03b1, a\u2020j\u2032,\u03b1\u2032 } = \u03b4 j, j\u2032\u03b4\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 . Under different boundary conditions, we choose a total of n = 2N (2N \u2212 1) sites for PBC (OBC) with N an integer. Subjected to open boundary, the last unit cell is broken with an empty B site. The odd number of sites helps to stabilize a zero-energy boundary mode and eventually leads to an exact Liouvillian spectrum.\nThe full dynamics of the generic model is captured by the Lindblad equation [48,54],\nd\u03c1 dt = L\u0302\u03c1 := \u2212i[H, \u03c1] + \u2211 \u03bc (L\u03bc\u03c1L \u2020 \u03bc \u2212 1 2 {L\u2020\u03bcL\u03bc, \u03c1}),\n(2.1)\nwhere \u03bc denotes the summation over all types of Lindblad dissipators.\nIt is important to note that with linear dissipators, the master Eq. (2.1) generates quadratic Lindbladians from which the relaxation process of any observable can be studied by solving the equation of motion either in the Majorana fermion representation [55,56,67\u201373] or in the original complex fermion basis [60,63]. While the two approaches are equivalent, we employ the first method due to its advantage of obtaining the exact Liouvillian spectrum instantaneously."

            "text": "Before addressing the specifics of our model, we give a brief review of this general third quantization approach through which the quadratic Lindbladians are diagonalized in the canonical basis of Majorana fermions [68\u201370].\nStarting with n complex fermions, the reduced density matrix of the system \u03c1 = \u2211 jk \u03c1 jk|a j\u3009\u3008ak| lives in a Hilbert space of dimension 2n \u00d7 2n. One can always construct a pair of Majorana fermions out of one complex fermion, for instance, \u03c9 j = a\u2020l + al and \u03c9k = \u2212i(a\u2020l \u2212 al ) such that they become\n023160-2\ntheir own antiparticles \u03c9\u2020j = \u03c9 j and satisfy anticommutation relations {\u03c9 j, \u03c9k} = 2\u03b4 j,k . The Hamiltonian and the dissipators take the matrix form depending on the details of the mapping: H = \u2211 j,k w jHj,kwk , L\u03bd = \u2211 j l\u03bdj w j .\nThe Hilbert space is now represented in the 22ndimensional Liouville space K expanded by the new set of Majorana operators: P\u03b1 = w\u03b111 w\u03b122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 w\u03b12n2n with \u03b1 j \u2208 {0, 1}. We apply the notation x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk )T to represent a vector of scalars or operators. Over the space K, it is convenient to define the adjoint creation and annihilation linear maps through \u03d5 fermions: \u03d5 j |P\u03b1\u3009 = \u03b4\u03b1 j ,1|w jP\u03b1\u3009, \u03d5\u2020j |P\u03b1\u3009 = \u03b4\u03b1 j ,0|w jP\u03b1\u3009, which obey {\u03d5 j, \u03d5\u2020k } = \u03b4 j,k . One verifies that |w jP\u03b1\u3009 = (\u03d5\u2020j + \u03d5 j )|P\u03b1\u3009, |P\u03b1w j\u3009 = PF (\u03d5\u2020j \u2212 \u03d5 j )|P\u03b1\u3009. The operator PF = (\u22121)N\u0302 denotes the Fermi parity associated with the fermion number N\u0302 = \u22112nj=1 \u03d5\u2020j \u03d5 j = \u03d5\u2020 \u00b7 \u03d5. Since [L\u0302,PF ] = 0 and (PF )2 = 1, the parity is conserved and takes the value \u00b11.\nIn the canonical basis |P\u03b1\u3009, the Liouvillian in Eq. (2.1) contains the even (+) and odd (\u2212) parity sectors: L\u0302 = \u2212 4i\u03d5\u2020 \u00b7 H\u03d5\n+ (1 + PF ) 2 [\u2212\u03d5\u2020 \u00b7 (M + MT )\u03d5 + \u03d5\u2020 \u00b7 (M \u2212 MT )\u03d5\u2020] + (1 \u2212 PF )\n2\n[\u2212\u03d5 \u00b7 (M + MT )\u03d5\u2020 + \u03d5 \u00b7 (M \u2212 MT )\u03d5]. (2.2)\nHere, the matrix M = \u2211\u03bd M\u03bd arises from the loss and gain dissipators: M\u03bd = (l\u03bd )T (l\u03bd )\u2217 and \u03bd = g, l .\nSince a physical observable must contain an even number of fermionic operators, one may focus on only a definite parity sector, e.g., the even parity sector (PF = 1) in this paper. Correspondingly, the dynamics of the system is governed by\nL\u0302+ = 1 2\n( \u03d5\u2020\u00b7 \u03d5\u00b7)(\u2212X \u2020 iY\n0 X\n)( \u03d5\n\u03d5\u2020\n) \u2212 A0, (2.3)\nwith X = \u22124iH + M + MT , Y = \u22122i(M \u2212 MT ), and A0 = 1 2 Tr[X ]. After proper diagonalization, one is able to express the Liouvillian in terms of rapidities \u03b2m and normal master modes (NMMs) b\u2032m, bm:\nL\u0302+ = \u2212 2n\u2211\nm=1 \u03b2mb\n\u2032 mbm, (2.4)\nwith the band index m and NMMs satisfying the anticommutation relations {b\u2032m, bl} = \u03b4m,l .\nNotably, the complex rapidity spectrum contains rich physics. An initial state \u03c10 of positive fermion parity approaches the NESS after a long-time evolution: \u03c1ss = eL\u0302+t\u03c10|t\u2192\u221e. While the imaginary part of the rapidity \u03b2m encodes the phase oscillation frequency, the real part of \u03b2m reveals the relaxation speed of the system to the steady state and Re(\u03b2m) 0 is required naturally. To describe the asymptotic decay rate quantitively, a spectral Liouvillian gap [66,74] can be defined as\n= 2 min{Re[\u03b2m]}. (2.5)\nExtra insight comes from the upper triangular structure of L\u0302+. It infers that the rapidity spectrum must coincide with the eigenvalues of the matrix X in the diagonal block, which is NH and also called the damping matrix. The off-diagonal block Y , on the other hand, shapes the configurations of NMMs and NESS [71,72]."

In the Appendix, we construct the exact spectrum of HS as a direct generalization of Ref. [18,34] to the new limit \u03b32 = 0.

(2.10)\nH0 and M1,2 are n \u00d7 n matrices holding entries, for instance, under OBC:\nH0 = i 4 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 0 t1 \u2212t1 0 \u2212t2 t2 0 t1 \u2212t1 0\n. . .\n0 t1 \u2212t1 0 \u2212t2\nt2 0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 ,\nM1 = \u03b3 2 \u00b7 1n\u00d7n + 1 2\n\u00d7 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 0 \u03b31 \u03b31 0 \u2212\u03b32 \u2212\u03b32 0 \u03b31 \u03b31 0\n. . .\n0 \u03b31 \u03b31 0 \u2212\u03b32\n\u2212\u03b32 0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 ,\nM2 = M1(\u03b3i \u2192 \u03b7i ). (2.11) \u03b3i\u2019s and \u03b7i\u2019s stand for the sum and the imbalance of loss and gain dissipations:\n\u03b3 = \u03b31 + \u03b32, 2\u03b3i = |\u03b3 li | + |\u03b3 gi |, \u03b7 = \u03b71 + \u03b72, 2\u03b7i = |\u03b3 li | \u2212 |\u03b3 gi |. (2.12)\nIt can be seen immediately that the Majorana representation in Eq. (2.9) is better adapted to diagonalize the Liouvillian in Eq. (2.3): in the adjoint fermion basis \u03d5T = (\u03d5T\nc , \u03d5T d ), it incorporates the matrix blocks\nX = (\nXc 0 0 Xd\n) , Y = 4 ( 0 M2 \u2212M2 0 ) , (2.13)\nwith Xc = Xd = \u22124iH0 + 2M1. Notice that the damping matrix X is diagonal and depends only on the total strength of dissipations \u03b3i. By contrast, the matrix Y is off-diagonal (thus couples \u03d5c and \u03d5d -fermions) and depends only on the imbalance of gain and loss \u03b7i. Taking into account the identical structure shared by Xc and Xd , one concludes that the rapidity spectrum determined by the full damping matrix is at least doubly degenerate,\nL\u0302+ = \u2212 n\u2211\nm=1 \u03b2m(b\n\u2032 c,mbc,m + b\u2032d,mbd,m), (2.14)\nwhere \u03b2m = \u03b2c,m = \u03b2d,m. It is not difficult to find a unitary transformation Un\u00d7n = diag{1, i, 1, i, . . . , 1, i, 1} under which Xc(d ) is mapped to the\ngeneralized NH SSH Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.8):\nXc = Xd = \u03b3 \u00b7 1 + iUHSU \u22121. (2.15) The matrix form HS is given in Eq. (A8). We thus reveal one important relation aforementioned in Eq. (1.1) for the rapidity spectrum of our model:\n\u03b2m = \u03b3 + iEm, (2.16) where Em represents the eigenvalues of HS.\nIt can be checked directly that the equality in Eq. (2.16) holds true for the PBC spectrum as well. Going to the momentum space, we set the lattice spacing to unity and adopt the Fourier transform \u03d5c,( j,\u03b1) = 1\u221aN \u2211 q e\niq j\u03d5c,\u03b1 (q) with q = 2\u03c0m\u2032/N , m\u2032 = \u2212N/2,\u2212N/2 + 1, . . . , 0, . . . , N/2 \u2212 1, such that the anticommutation relations are satisfied: {\u03d5c,\u03b1 (q), \u03d5\u2020c,\u03b1\u2032 (q\u2032)} = \u03b4q,q\u2032\u03b4\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 . The same transform is applied to \u03d5d -fermions. In the basis of \u03d5(q) = (\u03d5c,A(q), \u03d5c,B(q), \u03d5d,A(q), \u03d5d,B(q))T , the Liouvillian in Eq. (2.3) turns into\nL\u0302PBC+ = 1\n2 \u2211 q ( \u03d5\u2020(q)\u00b7 \u03d5(\u2212q)\u00b7)\n\u00d7 (\u2212X \u2020(q) iY (q)\n0 X (q)\n)( \u03d5(q) \u03d5\u2020(\u2212q) )\n\u2212 A0. (2.17) X (q) and Y (q) become 4 \u00d7 4 matrices inheriting the same structures as before in Eq. (2.13) with ingredients expressed in terms of Pauli matrices:\nH0(q) = (\u2212it2 sin q) \u00b7 \u03c3 x + i(t1 + t2 cos q) \u00b7 \u03c3 y,\nM1(q) = 1 2 [\u03b3 \u00b7 1 + (\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32 cos q) \u00b7 \u03c3 x \u2212 \u03b32 sin q \u00b7 \u03c3 y], M2(q) = M1(q)|\u03b3i\u2192\u03b7i . (2.18)\nThe mapping in Eq. (2.15) from the damping matrix to the NH SSH Hamiltonian follows naturally under the unitary transformation U = diag{1, i} with HS(q) shown in Eqs. (A2). Therefore, we confirm the validity of the equality relation in Eq. (2.16) for the PBC rapidity spectrum."

(2.22) When the boundary is switched from PBC to OBC as depicted in Fig. 1, we can extract the rapidity spectrum directly from Em solved in Eqs. (A3), (A9), and (A14):\n\u03b2PBC\u00b1 (q) = \u03b3 \u00b1 i[t21 + t22 \u2212 (\u03b3 21 + \u03b3 22 ) + 2(t1t2 + \u03b31\u03b32) cos q + 2i(t1\u03b32 + t2\u03b31) sin q]1/2,\n\u03b2OBC\u00b1 (q) = \u03b3 \u00b1 i[t21 + t22 \u2212 (\u03b3 21 + \u03b3 22 )\n+ 2 \u221a\n(t21 \u2212 \u03b3 21 )(t22 \u2212 \u03b3 22 ) cos q]1/2, \u03b2OBCm=0 = \u03b3 . (2.23)\nIn the OBC spectrum, the band index m \u2208 {(\u00b1, q), 0} is assigned to n = 2N \u2212 1 bands with discrete modes q = \u03c0m\u2032/N , m\u2032 = 1, 2, . . . , N \u2212 1. Given an odd number of sites, there emerge two right and left boundary modes at zero energy E0 = 0 with exponential localization factors: rR = \u2212(t1 \u2212 \u03b31)/(t2 + \u03b32), rL = \u2212(t1 + \u03b31)/(t2 \u2212 \u03b32) [see also Eq. (A9)]. As for the bulk spectrum, analogous to the simplified NH SSH model with only one asymmetric hopping term \u03b31 [19,20,34], one finds up to a shift in q a general relation of rapidities between two boundary conditions:\n\u03b2OBC\u00b1 (q) = \u03b2PBC\u00b1 (q \u2212 i ln(r)), (2.24) where r = \u221a(t1 \u2212 \u03b31)(t2 \u2212 \u03b32)/[(t1 + \u03b31)(t2 + \u03b32)].\nIt is important to note that under OBC, in the region |r\u2217LrR| < 1 or, equivalently,\u2223\u2223t21 \u2212 \u03b3 21 \u2223\u2223 < \u2223\u2223t22 \u2212 \u03b3 22 \u2223\u2223, (2.25) the complete set of eigenvectors exhibits a nonzero biorthogonal polarization [18] and holds a nontrivial non-Bloch topological invariant [19]. It further indicates at |r\u2217LrR| = 1, the gap of Em closes [an alternative argument is given above Eq. (A13)]. As a result, when HS in Eq. (2.8) reduces to the Hatano-Nelson model at t1 = t2, \u03b31 = \u03b32 [2,76\u201378], a collapse of the exact bulk states is expected. One is nevertheless able to study the behavior of the system around these gap closing points via approximate variational states [34]. Meanwhile, in a dissipative quantum system composed of tight-binding bosons and nonlinear (quadratic) Lindblad operators, a Liouvillian can be constructed in such a way that its diagonal subspace resembles the Hatano-Nelson model, thus giving rise to a similar Liouvillian skin effect [66]."

The essence is to remove in the upper triangular structure the off-diagonal block Y that entangles adjoint fermions \u03d5c and \u03d5d . More precisely,(\u2212X \u2020 iY\n0 X\n) = W (\u2212X \u2020 0 0 X ) W \u22121.

(2.28) It is easy to discern that if \u03b7/\u03b3 = \u03b71/\u03b31 or \u03b72/\u03b32, the covariance matrix holds a simple structure:\nC = i\u03b7 \u03b3\n( 0 1n\u00d7n \u22121n\u00d7n 0 ) .

(2.30)\nA deeper understanding of the covariance matrix comes from the pairing function of Majorana fermions: Cjk (t ) = \u2212Tr[w jwk\u03c1(t )] + \u03b4 jk . In its time evolution, by applying the Lindblad Eq. (2.1) in combination with the anticommutation relations of Majorana fermions, one arrives at\n\u2202tC(t ) = \u2212C(t )X \u2212 X \u2020C(t ) + iY. (2.31) For a steady state, \u2202tCs = 0. Therefore,\nCs \u2261 C. (2.32) It can be interpreted that in the solvable limit of the Lindbladian in Eqs.

(2.33) A nonvanishing covariance matrix plays a role in counteracting the effect of the imbalanced gain and loss dissipations (\u03b7). Back to the original Hilbert space expanded by spinless fermions a, a more physical picture can be drawn as follows. Since n j,\u03b1 = a\u2020j,\u03b1a j,\u03b1 = (1 \u2212 ic j,\u03b1d j,\u03b1 )/2, the dissipative fermionic SSH chain has a tendency to evolve toward a uniformly distributed configuration with an occupation number:\nnss,( j,\u03b1) = \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b7 2\u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1].

            "text": "Based on different classification schemes [73,79], open fermion matter falls into one of the ten NH Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes. Given a quadratic Liouvillian [73], the classification can be defined through the damping matrix X , or, in our case ,Xc(d ):\nZ = \u2212iXc(d ), = \u2212i(\u03b31 + \u03b32) \u00b7 1 \u2212 [i\u03b31 + t2 sin q \u2212 i\u03b32 cos q] \u00b7 \u03c3 x\n+ [(t1 + t2 cos q) + i\u03b32 sin q] \u00b7 \u03c3 y. (2.39) The matrix Z resembling the Hamiltonian in the closed limit preserves the time-reversal, particle-hole, and pseudo-antiHermiticity (PAH, or generalized chiral) symmetries: Z = \u03c3 xZT \u03c3 x, Z = \u2212Z\u2217, and Z = \u2212\u03c3 xZ\u2020\u03c3 x. Hence, each subspace of the damping matrix belongs to class BDI with a Z classification in 1D. It should be noted that at the edge, two real Majorana fermions c and d always recombine into one complex fermion a as indicated by Eq. (2.9). When the dissipations are turned on, this edge mode shares a finite lifetime with a contribution coming from the effective Liouvillian gap (nonvanishing as indicated by the purely imaginary total en-\nergy shift in Z) and another from the non-Hermiticity of the damping matrix [see Eq. (4.9)].\nIn the presence of the PAH symmetry, a Z classification is captured by the topological invariant, spectral winding number. By shifting the reference point to (0,\u2212i\u03b3 ) in the complex plane, it is equivalent to evaluate the winding of the Bloch Hamiltonian HS(q) [2,3]:\n\u03bd = 1 2\u03c0 i \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 dq \u2202q ln{det[HS(q)]}. (2.40)\nRemarkably, when the spectral winding number becomes nontrivial, the left and right boundary modes in the OBC spectrum in Eq. (A9) start to localize at different ends of the chain:\n|\u03bd| = 1, sgn[ln(|rL|)] = sgn[ln(|rR|)]. (2.41) For \u03b31\u03b32 0, the above topological regime resides in\nt1t2 > 0, {||t1| \u2212 |t2|| < |\u03b31| + |\u03b32| ||\u03b31| \u2212 |\u03b32|| < |t1| + |t2|,\nt1t2 < 0, {||t1| \u2212 |t2|| < ||\u03b31| \u2212 |\u03b32|| |\u03b31| + |\u03b32| < |t1| + |t2|,\nor {||t1| \u2212 |t2|| > ||\u03b31| \u2212 |\u03b32|| |\u03b31| + |\u03b32| > |t1| + |t2|. (2.42)\nIn the framework of our model, the bond dissipators entail \u03b31 0, \u03b32 0. Figure 3 shows the dependence of the spectral winding number on one of the dissipation strengths with the signs of two symmetric hopping terms being either the same\n023160-6\n(t1 = t2) or the opposite (t1 = \u2212t2). As soon as |\u03bd| = 0, the left and right boundary modes exponentially pile up at different ends. This unique feature of HS can be applied to the design of the NH topological sensors exhibiting anomalous sensitivity that grows exponentially with the system size [38].\nInside the bulk spectrum, however, it is clear to see that the topological invariant \u03bd obtained from the Bloch Hamiltonian fails to locate the boundary zero modes at EOBCm =0 = 0 [if compared with Eq. (A13)]. In a closed NH system, the concept of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence has thus been generalized to allow the reconstruction of topological quantities in the biorthogonal basis [18,19] such that the occurrence of the boundary modes are accurately predicted, [see also Eq. (2.25)]. What happens to an open quantum system? Similarly, its relaxation dynamics have the Liouvillian skin effect once the NMMs of the Liouvillian pile up exponentially close to the boundary [60,66]. It is then crucial to look at the behavior around the EPs, arising naturally from the Lindblad master equation [80]:\nti = \u00b1\u03b3i, i = 1, 2. (2.43) At EPs, the geometric multiplicity of the Liouvillian is smaller than the algebraic multiplicity which holds an order that scales with the system size [1,16,20]. We check that for ti = \u00b1\u03b3i, the rapidity spectrum \u03b2OBCm in Eqs. (2.23) indeed has one or three eigenvalues. Approaching one of the EPs, the set of NMMs merges into one or three linearly independent eigenstates. Moreover, after the mapping of the damping matrix to HS in Eq. (2.8), the adjoint fermions are only permitted to hop in one direction when ti = \u00b1\u03b3i, so all NMMs become exactly localized at that one end. Consequently, we envision the most drastic Liouvillian skin effect in close proximity to EPs, which, in terms of the momentum shift parameter r defined for linking two rapidities in Eq. (2.24), is manifested as\nti \u2192 \u00b1\u03b3i \u21d4 \u2223\u2223ln |r2|\u2223\u2223 0. (2.44)\nAs expected, with a sufficiently large system size, the Liouvillian skin effect is fully determined by the localization behavior of the bulk modes [see also Eqs. (A16)\u2013(A18)] and the influence of the boundary modes is negligible. By varying the dissipation strength, alongside the spectral winding number, Fig. 3 compares the responses in different localization determinants: r jR(r j L ), r\nj (r\u2212 j ) for the piling of the right (left) boundary and bulk modes at unit cell j. To conclude, while not characterized by the Bloch topological invariant, the Liouvillian skin effect is embodied in the exceptional topology of the Liouvillian or, more precisely, the damping matrix."

Figure 4 shows the real part of the rapidity spectrum as a function of t1 under PBC and OBC.\nSubjected to a periodic boundary, with finite bond dissipation inside unit cells \u03b31 = 0, one observes drastically different gap-closing behaviors with and without the second inter-unit-\ncell dissipation:\n\u03b32 = 0, PBC = 0 for |t1| |t2|; \u03b32 = 0, PBC = 0 at t1 = t2. (2.45)\nWe find that after the introduction of the second bond dissipation, the gap closing line of the Liouvillian discovered in Ref. [60] becomes unstable and shrinks to a point in the phase diagram. It would lead to a collapse of the nontrivial (quasi-)NESS and a termination of the steady-state current in a wide parameter range (see more details in Sec. III B).\nMeanwhile, the gap-closing points vanish completely when the boundary opens up. In this circumstance, we resolve the Liouvillian gap from the exact spectrum in Eqs.

Meeting the EPs at ti = \u00b1\u03b3i, a discontinuity appears in the derivatives of the gap with respect to the symmetric hopping term \u2202ti\nOBC (see Fig. 4) as well as the asymmetric hopping term \u2202\u03b3i\nOBC (see Fig. 7).\nLastly, we mention briefly the effects of single-site loss and gain on the Liouvillian. Given a general set of loss and gain dissipators acting on individual sites,\nLl0,( j,\u03b1) = \u221a \u03b3 l0 a j,\u03b1, L g 0,( j,\u03b1) = \u221a \u03b3 g 0 a \u2020 j,\u03b1, (2.47)\n023160-7\nthe only change to the Liouvillian becomes a modified constant term in the damping matrix that ultimately lifts the minimum of the Liouvillian gap,\n\u03b3 = \u03b30 + \u03b31 + \u03b32, 2\u03b30, (2.48) with 2\u03b30 = |\u03b3 l0 | + |\u03b3 g0 |. The gap now can no longer be removed by closing the boundary. Fortunately, the on-site dissipations will not add any NH term to the damping matrix, thus not altering the Liouvillian skin effect.

Here, we compare the effective Hamiltonian description with the full Lindblad master equation framework.\nWithout quantum jumps, the time evolution of the density can be described by\n\u2202t\u03c1 = \u2212i(Heff\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1H\u2020eff ), (2.56) where Heff = H \u2212 i2 \u2211 \u03bc L \u2020 \u03bcL\u03bc. It turns out that the structure of the effective Hamiltonian becomes drastically different from the damping matrix [60]. We verify that rather than the total strength \u03b3 , the non-Hermiticity of Heff is related to the imbalance \u03b7 between loss and gain dissipations:\nHeff = N\u22121\u2211 j=1 (t1 \u2212 \u03b71)a\u2020j,Aa j,B + (t1 + \u03b71)a\u2020j,Ba j,A\n+ (t2 \u2212 \u03b72)a\u2020j,Ba j+1,A + (t2 + \u03b72)a\u2020j+1,Aa j,B \u2212 i\u03b7 \u2211 ( j,\u03b1) a\u2020( j,\u03b1)a( j,\u03b1) \u2212 is0.

For the short-time interval, regardless of the total dissipation strength \u03b3 , the imbalance \u03b7 determines the Lindblad spectrum and makes the Liouvillian gap increase with the system size rather than stay a constant value as suggested by Eq. (2.16). In the long-time limit, the EPs of the exact solutions move to ti = \u00b1\u03b7i, leaving the Liouvillian skin effect unpredictable compared with Eq. (2.44). Ultimately, the system always decays to an empty chain as there is no residual matrix Y in the equation of motion that can add up to a finite stationary occupation of fermions according to Eqs. (2.31)\u2013(2.35).\nIn spite of all the discrepancies, however, once gain dissipators are suppressed on the bonds \u03b3 g1 = \u03b3 g2 = 0, we reach one special point where\n\u03b3 = \u03b7, Qjk,eff(t ) = Qjk (t ).

For nonzero \u03b31 and \u03b32, Fig. 4 shows the real part of the PBC rapidity spectrum holds a gapless point at t1 = t2. It is easy to check that the rapidity of the bulk mode m\u2217 = (+,\u2212\u03c0 ) vanishes completely: \u03b2m\u2217 = 0. Therefore, the right set of the steady states becomes threefold degenerate: sR,0 = |NESS\u3009, sR,c = b\u2032c,m\u2217 |NESS\u3009, sR,d = b\u2032d,m\u2217 |NESS\u3009 (accordingly, the left set is expanded by \u3008NESS\u2032|, \u3008NESS\u2032|bc,m\u2217 and \u3008NESS\u2032|bd,m\u2217 ). In contrast to OBC, after a long-time evolution, the final state of the periodic system now depends on the initial configuration and may appear as a superposition among different NESSs: \u03c1ss = \u03c1ss(\u03c10).\nWhen \u03b32 = 0, from Fig. 5(a), the parameter regime allowing the threefold degenerate NESS can be extended to |t1| = |t2| where the zero-rapidity bulk mode appears at m\u2217 = (+,\u2212\u03c02 [sgn(t1t2) + 1]). Meanwhile, with \u03b32 suppressed, one observes interesting features in the relaxation behavior reflected by the Liouvillian gap [see also Fig. 4(a)]:\nPBC = \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 0, |t1| |t2| 2\u03b31 \u2212 2 \u221a \u03b3 21 \u2212 (|t1| \u2212 |t2|)2, |t2| < |t1| tc\n2\u03b31 \u2212 2\u03b31|t2|\u221a t21 \u2212\u03b3 21 , |t1| > tc, (3.2)\n023160-9\nwhere the critical value is identified as tc = (|t2| +\u221a t22 + 4\u03b3 21 )/2. In the region |t1| < |t2|, the Liouvillian gap closes at the bulk modes m\u2217 = (\u00b1,\u00b1 arccos[\u2212t1/t2]). We call them quasisteady states, which are stationary states characteristic of a vanishing decay rate and a finite phase oscillation frequency as shown in Fig. 5(b): |Re(\u03b2m\u2217 )| = 0, |Im(\u03b2m\u2217 )| =\u221a\nt22 \u2212 t21 . Similar to the degenerate NESS, the final state can also select the quasisteady states without any decay in the probability density. Once |t1| > |t2|, the Liouvillian gap of the PBC spectrum opens up but remains smaller than OBC. The bulk mode that dominates the relaxation process should be the one with a minimal decay rate. It changes from (+,\u2212\u03c02 [sgn(t1t2) + 1]) to (\u00b1,\u00b1 arccos[t1t2/(\u03b3 21 \u2212 t21 )]) when the growing amplitude |t1| goes past tc. It should be noted that the gap solution in Eq. (3.2) is valid for both the strong (\u03b31 > |t2|) and weak (\u03b31 |t2|) dissipations.\nCompared to the trivial steady state in Eq. (2.35), the degenerate and quasi-NESSs can be viewed as plane waves of fermions with fixed momenta m\u2217 on top of a static uniform occupation. It is rather important to distinguish the degenerate and quasi-NESSs from the trivial one, especially on account of the former two being a direct consequence of the closing of the Liouvillian gap.

(3.3)\nOur focal point is to study the behavior of the current in different NESSs. At larger times, only the Liouvillian gapless modes m\u2217 satisfying Re(\u03b2m\u2217 ) = 0 survive.

(3.4)\nLet us begin with the special limit \u03b32 = 0 where all three types of NESSs coexist and assume t2 > 0. For the trivial steady state m\u2217 = \u2205, thus the current vanishes in the end:\njss|\u03b32=0 = 0, |t1| > t2. (3.5) At phase transition points, the degenerate NESS generated by two bulk modes m\u2217 = (+,\u2212\u03c02 [sgn(t1t2) + 1]) supports a current flow with an amplitude\njss|\u03b32=0 = { 0, t1 = \u2212t2 1\n2N ( \u03b3+\u03b7 \u03b3 ) , t1 = t2. (3.6)\nIn the intermediate gapless region, there emerges quasi-NESS from the modes m\u2217 = (\u00b1,\u00b1 arccos[\u2212t1/t2]). Analytically, the\nstationary current can be expanded in the orders of 1/N ,\njss|\u03b32=0 t\u2192\u221e=\n( \u03b3 + \u03b7\n\u03b3\n){ 1\n2N ( t1 + t2 t2 )\n+ 1 2N2 [( t1 + t2 t2 ) cos(2t2\u03b1t ) + \u03b1 sin(2t2\u03b1t ) ]} + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n(3.7)\nwith \u03b1 = \u221a\n1 \u2212 (t1/t2)2. The time dependence in the steadysteady current arises from the finite phase oscillation frequency, a unique feature possessed by quasi-NESS. Given sufficiently large system size, to the leading order O(N\u22121), we get\njss|\u03b32=0 = 1\n2N\n( \u03b3 + \u03b7\n\u03b3 )( t1 + t2 t2 ) , |t1| < t2. (3.8)\nFor nonzero \u03b31 and \u03b32, on the other hand, the steady-state current is carried by the gapless bulk mode m\u2217 = (+,\u2212\u03c0 ) at t1 = t2, while it vanishes elsewhere. Therefore,\njss|\u03b31\u00b7\u03b32 =0 = 1\n2N\n( \u03b3 + \u03b7\n\u03b3\n) \u03b4t1,t2 . (3.9)\nOne immediately notices that when the gain and loss dissipations are in balance, namely \u03b7 = 0, the prefactor (\u03b3 + \u03b7)/\u03b3 \u2192 1. The steady state current is then independent of the dissipation strengths \u03b3i. In Fig. 6, we confirm the analytical predictions on the steady state current for \u03b32 = 0 in Eqs. (3.5)\u2013(3.8) by a measurement of jc(t ) at time \u03b3 t = 105. With balanced gain and loss bond dissipations, we verify the stationary current remains the same under different values of \u03b31. When \u03b32 = 0, in the same manner, we still find a persistent current at the Liouvillian gap closing point regardless of the choices of \u03b32 [see also Fig. 8(a)].\nBy contrast, in the description of the effective Hamiltonian, once \u03b3 = \u03b7 the real part of the rapidity spectrum for a periodic chain in Eq.

Deviating from the gap closing point, the current flow vanishes at relatively short times. Changing the boundary condition to OBC, the gapless mode in the rapidity spectrum disappears. All bulk and edge NMMs immediately pile up exponentially at one of the boundaries, thus terminating the current flow in Fig. 7(c).

In Fig. 8, we thus fix t1 = t2 and study the dynamics of the current flow occurring at the Liouvillian gap-closing point in a wide range of dissipation strengths. Consistent with our earlier prediction in Eq. (3.9) for balanced gain and loss dissipators (\u03b7 = 0), Fig. 8(a) shows that even in the presence of very weak dissipations (\u03b31 = 0.02, \u03b32 = 0.01), the current flow along a periodic chain saturates to a finite value identical to the limit of strong dissipations. However, once the boundary opens up, driven by weak dissipations, the current flow decays with oscillations and has a much shorter relaxation time as indicated in Fig. 8(b). It also represents the behaviors of those points far away from EPs (ti = \u00b1\u03b3i), bringing about weak Liouvillian skin effect. For stronger dissipations or | ln(|r2|)| 0, the amplitude of the current is enlarged as the NMMs continue to pile up in the same direction. The current flow also shares a longer relaxation time before the system evolves to the trivial NESS hosting a static uniform distribution of fermions. The relaxation time or the tail of the current flow is determined by two factors, the effective Liouvillian gap eff and the correlation length \u03be (r2) of the system. It is equal to the lifetime of the particle at one boundary in favor of the Liouvillian skin effect, of which more detailed analysis can be found in Sec. IV C.\n023160-11"

(4.2)\nA similar expression can be obtained for the even sublattice B. Here, the damping factor r2 comes from the localization of the left bulk eigenmodes. When |r2| \u2192 0(\u221e), for instance, the left eigenmodes are localized on the right (left) end of the chain, pushing the chiral wavefront toward the same boundary while the right eigenmodes center on the opposite. In the timedependent part of the particle number operator, we replace the original gap OBC with an effective Liouvillian gap eff. The comparison of two quantities is made in Fig. 13. Since we are interested in the full dynamics of the relaxation process, instead of taking the long-time limit and keeping track of the slowest decaying mode, we should include all bulk modes with various decaying rates. The summation then leads to an effective Liouvillian gap that is also useful in the evaluation of the particle lifetime in Eq. (4.9).\nThe two extremities of the Liouvillian skin effect |r2| \u2192 0 or \u221e occur at EPs: ti = \u00b1\u03b3i, when the adjoint fermions in the damping matrix are only allowed to hop in one direction after the mapping to HS in Eq. (2.8). It is noteworthy that with a large system size, the chiral damping condition can be further\nrelaxed to\n|r2| 1 or |r2| 1, (4.3) irrespective of whether the PBC rapidity spectrum is gapless or not.\nSo far, one discerns that within the framework of the full Lindbladian, the Liouvillian skin effect is closely related to the exceptional topology of the non-Bloch damping matrix, whereas it does not depend on the topology of the Bloch NH Hamiltonian HS(q) as illustrated in Fig. 3. Meanwhile, considering \u03b3i\u2019s and \u03b7i\u2019s belong to two sets of independent parameters in Eqs. (2.12), the effective Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.57) does not play a role here either.

Let us define the polarization of the damping process according to\nP(t ) = \u2211ntot\nj=1 j \u00b7 n\u0303 j (t ) ntot \u00b7 \u2211ntot j=1 n\u0303 j (t ) , (4.4)\nwhere, as depicted in Fig. 1, the length of chain is chosen to be odd ntot = 2N \u2212 1. Without loss of generality, we restrict ourselves to the case when the gain and loss dissipations are in balance: \u03b71 = \u03b72 = 0. Starting from a completely filled chain, the NESS should then be half filling at each site in Eq. (2.34). Plugging the analytical expression for particle number in Eq. (4.1), the tendencies of polarization under different hopping amplitudes and dissipation strengths are shown in Fig. 9. Figure 10 further illustrates the motion of the chiral damping wavefront along the chain as time goes by.\nAt the initial time, P = 1/2, it refers to a uniform particle-number distribution consistent with our initial condition. Around |r2| = 1, when the Liouvillian skin effect is quite weak, the polarization stays close to 1/2 and the chiral damping wavefront is absent in Figs. 10(e) and 10(b). As |r2| 1 ( 1), the NMMs of the Liouvillian start to pile\n023160-12\nup toward the right (left) end such that the particles closer to that boundary are granted a longer lifetime, thus pushing the polarization to 1 (0). From Figs. 10(a) and 10(f), the chiral wavefront also appears most distinguished in these two limits. In the intermediate parameter regime of |r2|, the polarization evolves to a finite value in between [0, 1/2] or [1/2, 1] in accompaniment with a damping wavefront growing obscure, as shown by Figs. 10(d) and 10(c). Therefore, by tuning the parameter r2, we are able to modulate the polarization or the center of the chiral damping wavefront regardless of the topology of the PBC rapidity spectrum before the boundary opens up. The left and right columns of Fig. 10 correspond to the gap closing (t1 = t2) and gap opening (t1 = t2) points in the PBC spectrum, respectively.\nOn a side note, in Fig. 9 even at relatively large times, P will not converge to 1/2 for its measurement is targeted on the excess of the particle number over a uniformly half-filled NESS rather than the real occupation number."

            "text": "From the chiral damping phenomena, the Liouvillian skin effect takes place upon changing the boundary from PBC to OBC. Since the system evolves from a completely filled initial state to a uniform steady state, the damping serves as a global effect. Nevertheless, we can also resolve the motion of a single particle and study the sensitivity of the open system to boundary conditions on broader grounds.\nIt is argued in Ref. [63] that in the thermodynamical limit, the single-particle Green\u2019s function of NH systems is independent of the boundary conditions. We show in the following within the Lindblad master equation framework, the argument is indeed true for the evolution of the density matrix at short times. However, as soon as the motion of a particle involves the edge, due to the gap closing and the Liouvillian skin effect, there emerge drastic differences in the relaxation process under PBC or OBC.\nLet us start by putting one particle in the middle of the chain: n j (0) = \u03b4 j,N . The initial condition corresponds to a Majorana pairing configuration,\nC\u0303(0) = \u2212 i(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3 ) \u03b3\n( 0 1n\u00d7n \u22121n\u00d7n 0 ) \u2212 i ( 0 D \u2212D 0 ) , (4.5)\nwhere the n \u00d7 n matrix D only holds one nonzero element D(N,N ) = 1. The time evolution of the particle number at the jth site can be described by\nn\u0303 j (t ) = \u2211 m,m\u2032 e\u2212(\u03b2m+\u03b2m\u2032 )t\u03c8\u2217Lm( j)\u03c8 \u2217 Lm\u2032 ( j)\n[ \u03c8Rm(N )\u03c8Rm\u2032 (N ) + ( \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3\n2\u03b3 ) ntot\u2211 l=1 \u03c8Rm(l )\u03c8Rm\u2032 (l ) ] .\n(4.6)\nTo make a direct comparison with Ref. [63], we suppress the gain dissipations on both bonds: \u03b3 g1 = \u03b3 g2 = 0 without violating the solvable constraint in Eqs. (2.30): \u03b31/\u03b71 = \u03b32/\u03b72 = 1. Since \u03b3 = \u03b7, the second term in the particle-number operator vanishes, and the trivial NESS refers to an empty chain indicated by Eq. (2.35).\nAlso, we focus on the relaxation process at the same point t1 = t2 as Ref. [63], where the gap of the PBC rapidity spectrum closes for arbitrary dissipation strengths \u03b31 and \u03b32. The inclusion of \u03b32 = 0 offers more tunability on the Liouvillian skin effect parameter r2. As shown in Fig. 11, the motion of the particle does not depend on the boundary condition until its trajectory hits the edge. Once that long-time evolution is permitted, contrary to Ref. [63], the motion differs a lot under PBC or OBC. We observe a persistent current jss = 1/N circulating along the periodic chain while the current quickly terminates under the influence of an open boundary.\nMeanwhile, we compare the responses of the particle motion to the presence of a strong or weak Liouvillian skin effect. When the skin effect dominates [|r2| \u2192 0 in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b)], the wave packet becomes less dispersive and oriented toward the right end under both PBC and OBC. The current also vanishes completely at the open boundary without any reflection. Both features are in marked contrast to the case of the weak Liouvillian skin effect [|r2| \u2192 1 shown by Figs. 11(c) and 11(d)].\n023160-13\nOne concludes that regardless of the initial conditions in the Lindblad setup, the Liouvillian skin effect is visible and manifested in the evolution of the density matrix given a probe of open quantum matter at longer times."

            "text": "In the last section, we resolved the relaxation time of dynamical observables under the Liouvillian skin effect. For a measurement, any local observable of the operator Q\u0302 has reached the steady state if |Q\u0303(t )| = |Q(t ) \u2212 Qss| ||Q\u0302|| = (Tr[Q\u0302\u2020Q\u0302])1/2. Along the lines of Ref. [66], one can thus define the maximal relaxation time \u03c4 of the system as that of the slowest decaying mode: |c|e\u2212\u03c4 = e\u22121 1 with the Liouvillian gap. The presence of the Liouvillian skin effect enforces the amplitude of this mode, showing an exponential localization tendency near the boundary: |c| \u223c eO(L/\u03be ). Here, \u03be denotes the correlation length of the system. It leads to\n\u03c4 \u223c 1 + 1 \u03be \u00b7 L . (4.7)\nIn our dissipative SSH model, we look at the Liouvillian skin effect region |r2| < 1 and take the dynamical observable as the occupation of a particle residing at the right boundary. More importantly, we make fewer assumptions than Ref. [66] by defining the lifetime of the nonequilibrium particle accord-\ning to\n|n\u03032N\u22121(\u03c4 )| = e\u2212l |n\u03032N\u22121(0)|, (4.8) where l is taken as a positive integer. The precision of the lifetime can be improved by increasing the value of l . The definition in Eq. (4.8) has the advantage of including the contributions from all decaying modes, staying closer to a real measurement.\nFor simplicity, we start with a completely filled chain and balanced gain and loss dissipators \u03b71 = \u03b72 = 0. Then, |n\u03032N\u22121(0)| = 1 \u2212 1/2 = 1/2. From the asymptotic scaling of the particle number evolution in Eq. (4.2), we establish that\n\u03c42N\u22121 \u223c 1 eff + ln(r\u22122) \u00b7 N eff . (4.9)\nThe correlation length of the system in Eq. (4.7) thus satisfies\n\u03be (r2) 2| ln(|r2|)| , (4.10)\nwhere the factor of 2 comes from the identification L = 2N \u2212 1. Consistent with Ref. [66], we find the lifetime of the particle at the edge grows linearly with the system size without a closing of the effective Liouvillian gap.\nNext, based on our exact solutions, we verify numerically the above relations by varying the system size and the skin effect parameter r2. It is also important to explore two limits, the weak and strong dissipations where the formation of the effective Liouvillian gap differs.\nAt weak dissipations \u03b31 < |t1| and \u03b32 < |t2|, all bulk and boundary modes share the same Liouvillian gap [see Eqs. (2.23) and Fig. 4]. Hence, eff = OBC = 2(\u03b31 + \u03b32). Figure 12(a) plots the numerical scaling of the particle lifetime at the edge \u03c42N\u22121 = \u03c4 under different system sizes at \u03b32 = 0. The linear dependence on N in Eq. (4.9) becomes more visible as the length of the chain increases. With stronger Liouvillian skin effect |r2| 1, the linear scaling holds true for a relatively small system size N \u223c 8. The system correlation length can be extracted from the slope and Fig. 12(b) confirms our analytical prediction in terms of the skin effect parameter in Eq. (4.10). Approaching the EP, \u03b31 \u2192 t1 = 1, the small discrepancy results from the fact that the strong polarization of the bulk eigenmodes challenges the numerical precision of the damping matrix decomposition in Eqs. (2.50).\nAt strong dissipations, on the other hand, from Fig. 4 different bulk and boundary modes form distinct real rapidity spectra. As a consequence, the effective Liouvillian gap incorporating effects of all decaying modes differs from OBC in Eq. (2.46). By definition,\neff = OBC, \u03b31 < |t1|, \u03b32 < |t2|; eff > OBC, otherwise . (4.11)\nStill, we can estimate its value from the established linear relation for the particle lifetime in Eq. (4.9) and at the same time, fix the correlation length by the skin effect parameter r2 in Eq. (4.10). In Fig. 13, we show the formation of the effective Liouvillian gap beyond weak dissipations: \u03b31 > |t1|, \u03b32 < |t2|. Indeed, OBC provides a lower bound for the effective Liouvillian gap.\n023160-14\nOn the contrary, when \u03b3 = \u03b7, the lifetime of a particle at the right boundary under the truncated Heff would scale as\n\u03c42N\u22121|Heff \u223c 1\n1 2(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b7) \u00b7 1 N (4.12)\nin the large N limit. Without the quantum jumps, the lifetime decreases with the system size. As expected, the effective Hamiltonian becomes problematic in describing the long-time dynamics."

This has illuminated the relation between the NH skin effect, two different effective Hamiltonians, Heff, HS, and the full quantum master equation description. A number of dynamical phenomena, such as diverging relaxation times, inherited in the quantum setup originate from the anomalous boundary sensitivity of the NH Hamiltonians and have been investigated in detail. This paper also provides a solid platform to resolve the entanglement spectrum and identify transitions between different NH topological phases [82] whose experimental realization is feasible, e.g., in ultracold atoms with a momentum lattice [59].\nDynamical probes of the quantum Fisher information [47] and the application as NH topological sensors [46] provide intriguing questions for future investigation. Meanwhile, the current model reveals the Liouvillian skin effect in the relaxation process while posing the question on the search for steady states that inherit the exceptional topology of the NH damping matrix. It is found that using monitored quantum circuits, periodic measurement allows access to biorthogonal steady state observables [29]. Future works could also be centered around the interaction effects on generic Lindbladians. For instance, the dynamical mean-field theory can be implemented to uncover the interplay of dissipation and environmental fluctuations in the open quantum matter that consists of interacting fermions [79] or bosons [83]. A mixture of particle species is a good path to the discovery of further variations of the Liouvillian skin effect. From a broader theoretical point of view, effective field theories with bosonization prove powerful in studying dissipative Luttinger liquids [84]. In presence of weak symmetries, one may tackle even strongly interacting Liouvillians [85]. The inclusion of disorder and chaos may be possible provided the solvable limit in a disorder-averaging SYK Lindbladian [86]."

The spectrum recovers the known solution by setting \u03b32 \u2192 0 and retains the main features in the new limit.\nOn one hand, there exist two zero-energy boundary states that are fully suppressed on sublattice B,\nE0 = 0 : \u03c8\u0303R0 = NR \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d rR 0 r2R 0 . . .\n0 rNR\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 , \u03c8\u0303 L0 = NL \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d rL 0 r2L 0 . . .\n0 rNL\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 , (A9)\nwith associated parameters rR = \u2212(t1 \u2212 \u03b31)/(t2 + \u03b32), rL = \u2212(t1 + \u03b31)/(t2 \u2212 \u03b32). The two eigenstates are biorthogonal to each other,\n\u03c8\u0303 \u2217 L0 \u00b7 \u03c8\u0303 R0 = 1, (A10) which brings about a constraint on the normalization factors: N \u2217L NR = (1 \u2212 r\u2217LrR)/[r\u2217LrR(1 \u2212 (r\u2217LrR)N )]. It is easy to discern that, depending on the absolute values of rL and rR, the left and right boundary modes can be localized at different ends: sgn[ln(|rL|)] = sgn[ln(|rR|)]. We find the parameters satisfying this condition all stay in the topological regime in Eqs. (2.42) where the spectral winding number is nontrivial.\nOn the other hand, to derive the bulk spectrum, we present an intuitive approach by analogy to Refs. [19,34]. Our first step is the identification of the gap-closing points when the boundary is opened. One way is to find a transformation matrix R such that the NH SSH Hamiltonian is mapped to its Hermitian counterpart H\u0304S:\nH\u0304S = R\u22121HSR. (A11) A proper construction leads to R = R1R2, where R1 = diag{1, r1, r1, r21 , r21 , . . . , rN\u221211 , rN\u221211 }, R2 = diag{1, 1, r2, r2, r22 , r22 , . . . , rN\u221222 , rN\u221212 }, and r1 =\u221a\n(t1 \u2212 \u03b31)/(t1 + \u03b31), r2 = \u221a\n(t2 \u2212 \u03b32)/(t2 + \u03b32). The Hermitian SSH chain is embedded with the anisotropic hopping strengths\nt\u03041 = \u221a t21 \u2212 \u03b3 21 , t\u03042 = \u221a\nt22 \u2212 \u03b3 22 , (A12) with the gapless phase transition occurring at |t\u03041| = |t\u03042|. HS inherits from the transformation these gap closing points:\n|t21 \u2212 \u03b3 21 | = |t22 \u2212 \u03b3 22 |. (A13)\n023160-16\nAn alternative method of reproducing the gapless points in the OBC spectrum is to study the biorthogonal polarization of the NH system [18,34], which changes its integer value at |r\u2217LrR| = 1, in consistency with our result in Eq. (A13).\nUnder the transformation in Eq. (A11), one can also link the bulk eigenstates of HS to the ones of H\u0304S by \u03c8\u0303R = R\u03c8\u0304R and \u03c8\u0303\nL = \u03c8\u0304 L R\u22121, which indicates the piling up of the right (left) states at one end with an exponential localization factor r j\n(r\u2212 j), where r = r1r2 = \u221a\nrR/rL. It is equivalent to a change of momentum in the Bloch phase factor eiq j from q to q \u2212 i ln(r), thus allowing us to build the OBC bulk spectrum from the PBC one [19,20]. More precisely, at a fixed momentum q, like the PBC spectrum the bulk energies always come in pairs (\u03bd = \u00b1): Em =0 = EOBC\u03bd (q). The two spectra are related by\nEOBC\u00b1 (q) = EPBC\u00b1 (q \u2212 i ln(r))\n= \u00b1 \u221a t21 + t22 \u2212 (\u03b3 21 + \u03b3 22 ) + 2 \u221a\n(t21 \u2212 \u03b3 21 )(t22 \u2212 \u03b3 22 ) cos(q). (A14)\nGiven an even number of sites n = 2N , the OBC spectrum obtained in this way applies only to the large N limit [19]. For an odd number of sites n = 2N \u2212 1, with additional mirror symmetry [34,87], it can be shown that the bulk spectrum in Eq. (A14) becomes exact for any finite N .\nLet us verify by building the exact left and right eigenvectors. We choose q = \u03c0m\u2032/N , m\u2032 = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1, so in total the index m \u2208 {0, (\u00b1, q)} reproduces a complete set of 2N \u2212 1 bands. A trial function for the right eigenstates can be written as\n\u03c8\u0303 R\u03bd (q, \u03b3i ) = 1\u221a 2N\n\u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d \u03c8\u0303 R\u03bd (q, 1) \u03c8\u0303 R\u03bd (q, 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u03c8\u0303 R\u03bd (q, N )\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0, (A15)\nwhere the component in the jth unit cell should be linked with the PBC eigenvector in Eqs. (A4) by the same momentum shift:\n\u03c8\u0303 R\u03bd (q, j) \u223c r jeiq j\u03c8\u0303PBC R\u03bd (q \u2212 i ln(r)). (A16) On top of that, mirror symmetry in the spectrum EOBC\u00b1 (q) = EOBC\u00b1 (\u2212q) enforces a superposition of two wave functions with opposite momenta. The relative amplitude of this superposition is determined by the boundary condition of a broken last unit cell: |\u03c8\u0303\nR\u03bd (q, 0)\u3009B = |\u03c8\u0303R\u03bd (q, N )\u3009B = 0. One arrives\nat\n\u03c8\u0303 R\u03bd (q, j) = r j(eiq juR\u03bd (q) \u2212 e\u2212iq juR\u03bd (\u2212q)), uR\u03bd (q) =\ni\u221a 2\n( (t1 + \u03b31 + (t2 \u2212 \u03b32)r\u22121e\u2212iq )/E\u03bd (q)\n1\n) .\n(A17)\nTaking into account H\u2020S (\u03b3 ) = HTS (\u03b3 ) = HS(\u2212\u03b3 ) and E\u03bd (q, \u03b3i ) = E\u03bd (q,\u2212\u03b3i )|OBC, the left and right eigenvectors are related in a way slightly different from PBC:\n\u03c8\u0303 L\u03bd (q, \u03b3i ) = \u03c8\u0303\u2217R\u03bd (q,\u2212\u03b3i ). (A18) It is straightforward to check that the energies in Eq. (A14) and eigenstates in Eqs. (A15)\u2013(A18) satisfy the eigenvalue Eqs. (2.19) for any finite system size N . The biorthogonal normalization conditions among the bulk and the boundary states are respected as well:\n\u03c8\u0303 \u2217 L\u03bd (q) \u00b7 \u03c8\u0303 R\u03bd \u2032 (q\u2032) = \u03b4\u03bd,\u03bd \u2032\u03b4q,q\u2032 ,\n\u03c8\u0303 \u2217 L\u03bd (q) \u00b7 \u03c8\u0303 R0 = \u03c8\u0303\u2217 L0 \u00b7 \u03c8\u0303 R\u03bd (q) = 0.
