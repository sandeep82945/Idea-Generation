    "abstractText": "From the quantum point of view, singularity should not exist. Recently, Bah and Heidmann constructed a five-dimensional singularity free topology star/black hole [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 151101 (2021)]. By integrating the extra dimension, a four-dimensional static spherical black hole with a magnetic charge and scalar hair can be obtained. In this paper, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the magnetic field and gravitational field on the background of this four-dimensional charged black hole with scalar hair. The odd parity of the gravitational perturbations couples with the even parity of the magnetic field perturbations. Two coupled second-order derivative equations are obtained. Using the matrix-valued direct integration method, we obtain the fundamental QNM frequencies numerically. The effect of the magnetic charge on the QNMs is studied. The differences of the frequencies of the fundamental QNMs between the charged black hole with scalar hair and the Reissner-Norstr\u00f6m black hole are very small for the angular number l = 2. However, some new interesting results are found for higher angular number.",

Recently, Bah and Heidmann constructed a five-dimensional singularity free topology star/black hole [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 151101 (2021)]. By integrating the extra dimension, a four-dimensional static spherical black hole with a magnetic charge and scalar hair can be obtained. In this paper, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the magnetic field and gravitational field on the background of this four-dimensional charged black hole with scalar hair. The odd parity of the gravitational perturbations couples with the even parity of the magnetic field perturbations. Two coupled second-order derivative equations are obtained. Using the matrix-valued direct integration method, we obtain the fundamental QNM frequencies numerically. The effect of the magnetic charge on the QNMs is studied. The differences of the frequencies of the fundamental QNMs between the charged black hole with scalar hair and the Reissner-Norstro\u0308m black hole are very small for the angular number l = 2. However, some new interesting results are found for higher angular number.\nPACS numbers:\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBlack hole physics has entered a new era since the detection of the gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo [1] and the first picture of a supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87 photographed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) [2\u2013 7]. Recently, the picture of the black hole in our Milky way was also taken by EHT [8\u201313]. These breakthroughs provide us with more possibilities to test some fundamental physical problems, for example, does singularity exist [14, 15]? Usually, a spacetime singularity is located at the center of a black hole. However, from the quantum aspect, spacetime should not be singular. In order to mimic black holes classically, some ultra-compact objects have been constructed, such as, gravastars [16], boson stars [17], and wormholes [18\u201321]. For more details, see the review [22] and references therein. But usually they need some exotic matters and the UV origin is unclear. From the top-down point view, string theory is regarded as the candidate that can unify quantum theory and gravity. Some horizonless models constructed from string theory, such as fuzz balls [23], are similar to black holes up to the Planck scale, and they have smooth microstate geometries. However, a lot of degrees of freedom in supergravity are needed, and the astrophysical observations of these horizonless moldes are difficult [24\u201326]. Recently, a five-dimensional nonsingular topological star/black hole model was proposed based\n\u2217Wen-Di Guo and Qin Tan are co-first authors of this paper. \u2020liuyx@lzu.edu.cn, corresponding author\non a five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory [27, 28]. The spacetime in this model has advantages both in microstate (smooth geometry) and macrostate geometries (similar to classical black holes). So it is interesting to study their astrophysical observations. Last year, Lim studied the motion of a charged particle in this nonsingular topological star/black hole model [29]. The thermodynamic stability of the solutions has been carefully analysed in Ref. [30]. Integrating the extra dimension, a four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory can be obtained, and a static spherically symmetric solution was solved in this background [25, 26]. Shadows of this black hole were studied in Ref. [31]. In this paper, we will study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of this model.\nAs the characteristic modes of a dissipative system, QNMs play important roles in a lot of aspects of our world. Due to the presence of the event horizon, black holes are nature dissipative systems. For a binary black hole merger system, there are three stages: inspiral, merger, and ringdown. In the ringdown stage, the gravitational waves are regarded as a superposition of QNMs [32]. Compared with the normal modes, the eigenfunctions of QNMs generally do not form a complete set, and they are not normalizable [33]. The frequencies of QNMs are complex, and the imaginary parts are related to the decay timescale of the perturbation. One can use the QNMs to infer the mass and angular momentum of a black hole [34] and to test the validity of the no-hair theorem [35\u201337]. The echoes in the ringdown signals can be used to distinguish the black hole from the ultra compact objects [15, 22, 38]. Recently, the pseudospectrum of gravitational physics showed that the QNM spectrum is unstable for the fundamental mode and the overtone modes [39, 40]. Besides, the properties of QNMs can also be used to constrain modified gravity theories [41\u2013\n2 49]. The stability under perturbations of the background spacetime can also be partly revealed from the QNM frequencies [50, 51]. Except for black hole physics, QNMs are also very useful in other dissipative systems, such as leaky resonant cavities [52], and brane world theories [53\u2013 55]. So, QNMs have been studied widely [56\u201360]. In this paper, we are interested in the QNMs of the four-dimensional spherically Bah-Heidmann black hole with a magnetic charge. The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly review the BahHeidmann black hole and the KK reduction. In Sec. III, we study the linear perturbation of the electromagnetic field and gravitational field. Separating radial part of the perturbed fields from the angular part, we derive the perturbation equations. In Sec. IV, we compute the QNM frequencies using the matrix-valued direct integration method. Finally, we give our conclusions in Sec. V."

            "text": "In this section we briefly review the black hole proposed by Bah and Heidmann [27, 28]. We start from a five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. The action is\nS =\n\u222b\nd5x \u221a \u2212g\u0302 ( 1 16\u03c0G5 R\u0302\u2212 1 16\u03c0 F\u0302MN F\u0302MN ) , (1)\nwhere F\u0302MN is the electromagnetic field tensor and G5 is the five-dimensional gravitational constant. The quantities with hat denote that they are constructed in the fivedimensional spacetime. The capital Latin letters M,N... denote the five-dimensional coordinates. The metric with three-dimensional spherically symmetry can be assumed as [61]\nds2 = \u2212fS(r)dt2 + fB(r)dy2 + 1\nfS(r)fB(r) dr2\n+ r2d\u03b82 + r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62. (2)\nThe extra dimension, denoted by the coordinate y, is a warped circle with radius Ry. The field strength with a magnetic flux is\nF\u0302 = P sin \u03b8d\u03b8 \u2227 d\u03c6. (3)\nThe solution with double Wick rotation symmetry is [61]\nfB(r) = 1\u2212 rB r , fS(r) = 1\u2212 rS r , (4)\nP = \u00b1 1 G5 \u221a 3rSrB .\nThat is to say, the metric (2) is invariant under rotation (t, y, rS , rB) \u2192 (iy, it, rB, rS). There are two coordinate singularities located at r = rS (corresponding to a\nhorizon) and r = rB (corresponding to a degeneracy of the y-circle). Bah and Heidmann found that, after some coordinate transformations, a smooth bubble locates at r = rB [27, 28]. This provides an end of the spacetime. For rS \u2265 rB, the bubble is hidden behind the horizon and the metric (2) describes a black string. For rS < rB , the spacetime ends at the bubble before reaching the horizon and the metric (2) describes a topological star [27, 28]. The metric (2) can be rewritten as\nds25 = e 2\u03a6ds24 + e \u22124\u03a6dy2, (5)\nwhere\ne2\u03a6 = f \u22121/2 B , (6)\nds24 = f 1 2 B\n(\n\u2212fSdt2 + dr2\nfBfS + r2d\u03b82 + r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n)\n.\n(7)\nWe can integrate the extra dimension y (this process is called Kaluza-Klein reduction). Then, a fourdimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory is obtained from the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory\nS4 =\n\u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g ( 1\n16\u03c0G4 R4 \u2212\n3\n8\u03c0G4 g\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u00b5\u03a6\u2202\u03bd\u03a6\n\u2212 e\u22122\u03a6\n16\u03c0e2 F\u00b5\u03bdF\n\u00b5\u03bd )\n, (8)\nwhere e2 \u2261 12\u03c0Ry and \u03a6 is a dilaton field. The Greek letters \u00b5, \u03bd, ... denote the four-dimensional coordinates. Here, g\u00b5\u03bd and F\u00b5\u03bd are the four-dimensional metric (7) and the electromagnetic field strength, respectively. The four-dimensional Ricci scalar R4 is determined by the metric g\u00b5\u03bd , and the four-dimensional gravitational constant is defined as\nG4 = e 2G5. (9)\nVarying the action (8) with respect to the scalar field \u03a6, the vector potential A\u00b5, and the metric g\u00b5\u03bd , we obtain the field equations\n6\nG4 \u2737\u03a6 +\ne\u22122\u03a6\ne2 F\u00b5\u03bdF\n\u00b5\u03bd = 0, (10)\n\u2207\u00b5F\u00b5\u03bd = 0, (11)\nR\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 1\n2 g\u00b5\u03bd = 8\u03c0G4T\u00b5\u03bd , (12)\nwhere \u2737 is the four-dimensional D\u2019Alembert operator, T\u00b5\u03bd = T s \u00b5\u03bd+T m \u00b5\u03bd is the energy momentum tensor containing the contributions of the scalar field and the magnetic field:\nT s\u00b5\u03bd = 3\n4\u03c0G4 \u2207\u00b5\u03a6\u2207\u03bd\u03a6\u2212\n3\n8\u03c0G4 g\u00b5\u03bd\u2737\u03a6, (13)\nTm\u00b5\u03bd = e\u22122\u03a6\n4\u03c0e2 F\u00b5\u03b1F\n\u03b1 \u03bd \u2212\ne\u22122\u03a6\n16\u03c0e2 g\u00b5\u03bdF\u03b1\u03b2F\n\u03b1\u03b2 . (14)\n3 We can solve the vector potential corresponding to the magnetic field as\nA\u00b5 = (0, 0, 0,\u2212 e\n2\n\u221a\n3rBrS G4 cos \u03b8). (15)\nThus, the field strength reads as\nF\u00b5\u03bd =\n\n    \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 e2\n\u221a\n3rBrS G4 sin \u03b8\n0 0 \u2212 e2 \u221a 3rBrS G4 sin \u03b8 0\n\n     . (16)\nNote that, when rB = 0, the metric (7) recovers to the Schwarzschild one. The parameters rS and rB are related to the fourdimensional Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass M and the magnetic charge Qm as\nM =\n(\n2rS + rB 4G4\n)\n, (17)\nQm = 1\n2\n\u221a\n3rBrS G4 . (18)\nOn the other hand, in terms of M and Qm, we have\nr (1) S = 2G4(M \u2212M\u25b3), r (1) B = G4(M +M\u25b3); (19) r (2) S = G4(M +M\u25b3), r (2) B = 2G4(M \u2212M\u25b3),(20)\nwhere\nM2\u25b3 =M 2 \u2212 (\u221a 2Qm\u221a 3G4 )2 . (21)\nNote that, in four-dimensional spacetime, when r < rB, f 1/2 B becomes imaginary. So, r = rB is the end of the spacetime. This is consistent with the result in fivedimensional spacetime [27, 28]. Usually, a black string scenario has the Gregory-Laflamme instability [62]. However, compact extra dimensions leading to a discrete KK mass spectrum makes it possible to avoid the GregoryLaflamme instability. Stotyn and Mann demonstrated that, the solution (19) is unstable under perturbation, while, when Ry > 4 \u221a 3\n3 Qm, the solution (20) is stable. That is to say, the solution (20) does not have the Gregory-Laflamme instability. Actually, the spacetime at r = rB is singular in four-dimensional spacetime. When rB \u2265 rS the metric (7) corresponds to a naked singularity, and when rB < rS the metric (7) corresponds to a black hole, which is named as a charged black hole with scalar hair. In this paper, we will only focus on the case rB < rS , i.e., the charged black hole with scalar hair."

            "text": "With the background solution (6), (7), and (15), we can derive the equations of motion for the perturbations.\nThe perturbed scalar field, vector potential, and metric field can be written as\n\u03a6 = \u03a6\u0304 + \u03d5, (22)\nA\u00b5 = A\u0304\u00b5 + a\u00b5, (23)\ng\u00b5\u03bd = g\u0304\u00b5\u03bd + h\u00b5\u03bd , (24)\nwhere the quantities with a bar represent the background fields, \u03d5, a\u00b5, and h\u00b5\u03bd denote the corresponding perturbations. Because the background spacetime is spherical symmetric, the perturbations can be divided into three parts based on their transformations under rotations on the 2-sphere: scalars, two-dimensional vectors, and twodimensional tensors. The spherical harmonic function Yl,m(\u03b8, \u03c6) behaves as a scalar under rotations, so it is the scalar base. The two-dimensional vector and tensor bases are introduced as follows [63\u201367]\n(V 1l,m)a = \u2202aYl,m(\u03b8, \u03c6), (25) (V 2l,m)a = \u03b3 bc\u01ebac\u2202bYl,m(\u03b8, \u03c6), (26)\nfor the vector part, and\n(T 1l,m)ab = (Yl,m);ab, (27) (T 2l,m)ab = Yl,m\u03b3ab, (28) (T 3l,m)ab = 1\n2 [\u01ebca(Yl,m);cb + \u01eb c b(Yl,m);ca] , (29)\nfor the tensor part. Here, the Latin letters a, b, c denote the angular coordinates \u03b8 and \u03c6, \u03b3 is the induced metric on the 2-sphere with radius 1, and \u01eb is the totally antisymmetric tensor in two dimensions. The semicolon denotes the covariant derivative on the 2-sphere. The above quantities behave differently under the space inversion, i.e., (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u2192 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8, \u03c0 + \u03c6). A quantity is called even or polar, if it acquires a factor (\u22121)l under space inversion. A quantity is called odd or axial, if it acquires a factor (\u22121)l+1 under space inversion. So the above quantities can be divided into two classes, the even parts V 1l,m, T 1 l,m, T 2 l,m, and the odd parts V 2 l,m, T 3 l,m. Note that, the spherical harmonic function Yl,m(\u03b8, \u03c6) is evenparity. Usually, the perturbation equations will not mix polar and axial contributions. However, we can see from Eqs. (6), (7), and (15) that the background scalar field and metric field are even-parity and the background vector potential is odd-parity. So we expect that the scalar perturbation and even-parity parts of the metric perturbations couple to the odd-parity parts of the electromagnetic perturbations to the linear order (type-I coupling). And the odd-parity parts of the metric perturbations couple to the even-parity parts of the electromagnetic perturbations to the linear order (type-II coupling). Note that, the scalar perturbation only contains the even part. Actually, these coupled perturbation equations have been studied in Refs. [68, 69]. In this paper, we study the type-II coupling perturbations. Based on the principle of general covariance, the theory should keep covariant under an infinitesimal coordinate\n4 transformation. Thus, we can choose a specific gauge to simplify the problem. In the Regge-Wheeler gauge [66], the odd parts of the perturbation h\u00b5\u03bd can be written as\nh\u00b5\u03bd = \u2211\nl\ne\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n  0 0 0 h0 0 0 0 h1 0 0 0 0 \u2217 \u2217 0 0\n\n  sin \u03b8\u2202\u03b8Yl,0(\u03b8). (30)\nThe magnetic field also has a gauge freedom. Following Ref. [70], we denote\nf\u0303\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202\u00b5a\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bda\u00b5, (31)\nthe even parts of the perturbation f\u0303\u00b5\u03bd can be written as\nf\u0303\u00b5\u03bd = \u2211\nl\ne\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n  0 f01 f02 0 \u2217 0 f12 0 0 \u2217 0 0 0 \u2217 0 0\n\n  sin \u03b8\u2202\u03b8Yl,0(\u03b8). (32)\nNote that, we have chosen m = 0 for simplify, because the perturbation equations do not depend on the value of m [66]. The asterisks denote elements obtained by symmetry. The functions h0, h1, f01, f02, and f12 only depend on the coordinate r. The perturbation of the vector potential can be expanded as\nat = \u2212 \u2211\nl\ne\u2212i\u03c9tf02Yl,0, (33)\nar = \u2212 \u2211\nl\ne\u2212i\u03c9tf12Yl,0, (34)\na\u03b8 = 0, (35)\na\u03c6 = 0. (36)\nThe field strength f01 can be derived from Eq. (31) as\nf01 = \u2202rf02 + i\u03c9f12. (37)\nSubstituting Eqs. (30) and (32) into the equations of motion (11) and (12), after some algebra calculations we can obtain the following master perturbation equations\nd2\u03c8g dr2\u2217 + (\u03c92 \u2212 V11)\u03c8g \u2212 V12\u03c8m = 0, (38)\nd2\u03c8m dr2\u2217 + (\u03c92 \u2212 V22)\u03c8m \u2212 V21\u03c8g = 0, (39)\nwhere\n\u03c8g \u2261 f1/4B fS 1\nr h1, (40)\n\u03c8m \u2261 \u221a fBr 2f01, (41)\nr\u2217 is the tortoise coordinate defined as\ndr\u2217 = 1\u221a fBfS dr, (42)\nand\nV11 = fS\n[\nl(l + 1) r2 \u2212 3(r\n2 B(13rS \u2212 9r) + 16rSr2)\n16fBr5\n]\n+ fS 3rB(2r \u2212 7rS)\n4fBr4 , (43)\nV12 = \u2212 2ifSf\n1/4 B\nel(l+ 1)r3\n\u221a\n3rBrSG4\u03c9, (44)\nV21 = i \u221a 3rBrSefS\n2 \u221a G4\u03c9f 1/4 B r 3 (l \u2212 1)l(l+ 1)(l + 2), (45)\nV22 = fS\n[\n3rBrS r4 + l(l + 1) r2\n]\n. (46)\nThe details of deriving the master equation (38) and (39) are shown in Appendix A. Note that, when the magnetic charge Qm vanishes, or rB approaches to zero, the gravitational perturbation \u03c8g and the magnetic field perturbation \u03c8m will decouple. Furthermore, the potential V11 will reduce to the potential for the gravitational perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole. Besides, the parameters e and G4 do not affect the quasinormal modes. To see this, we can redefine\n\u03c8\u0303m \u2261 \u221a G4 e \u03c8m (47)\nto eliminate the parameters e and G4 in Eqs. (38) and (39).

            "text": "In this section we will solve the master perturbation equations (38) and (39) to obtain the frequencies of the QNMs. We focus on the QNMs of the solution (20), because it is free of the Gregory-Laflamme instability. We know from Eq. (21) that the range of the magnetic charge Qm is [0, \u221a 3 2G4M ]. Compared with the range of the electric charge of the Reissner-Norstro\u0308m (RN) black hole [0, \u221a G4M ], the range of the magnetic charge is larger than that of the RN black hole electric charge. Note that, we only study the charged black hole with scalar hair, that is, rB < rS . In this situation, the range of the magnetic charge Qm is [0, 2 \u221a G4 3 M ]. This range is still larger than that of the RN black hole electric charge.\n5 The perturbation equations (38) and (39) are coupled and can be rewritten into a compact form\nd2Y\ndr2\u2217 + (\u03c92 \u2212V)Y = 0, (50)\nwhere\nY =\n(\n\u03c8g \u03c8m\n)\nand V is a 2\u00d72 matrix with components (43), (46), (48), and (49). The physical boundary conditions for the QNM problem are pure ingoing waves at the event horizon\nYn \u223c bne\u2212i\u03c9r\u2217 , r\u2217 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, (51)\nand pure outgoing waves at spatial infinity\nYn \u223c Bnei\u03c9r\u2217 , r\u2217 \u2192 +\u221e, (52)\nwhere Yn is the n-th component ofY, bn and Bn are coefficients of the boundary conditions. With these boundary conditions, solving the QNM frequencies is an eigenvalue problem. In this paper, we use the matrix-valued direct integration method. More details can be seen in Ref. [71].\nWe solve the fundamental QNMs numerically, which dominate the ringdown waveform at late time. The values of the frequencies of fundamental QNMs for the gravitational field \u03c8g and the magnetic field \u03c8m for different\nvalues of the magnetic charge Qm with l = 2 are shown in Tables. I and II. When Qm = 0, the metric (7) reduces to the Schwarzschild metric. The master equation (38) reduces to the odd parity gravitational perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity. The frequencies of the QNMs are also same as the Schwarzschild black hole case. This confirms that our numerical method is valid. Note that the charge of the charged black hole with scalar hair can be seen as a dark charge, which is very different from the U(1) charge of electromagnetism of the RN black hole. In this paper, we would like to compare our results with that of the RN black hole. Comparing the QNMs of the charged black hole with scalar hair and the RN black hole, we can see that, the differences of their numerical values are very small. So it almost can not distinguish them from the gravitational wave data. Note that, for the extreme RN black hole, the singularity structure of the perturbation equations is different from the nonextreme ones. The QNMs for the maximally charged RN black hole was studied in Ref. [72]. Our results for the RN black hole with Q/M = 0.9999 are taken from that paper. The effects of the magnetic charge Qm of the charged black hole with scalar hair and the electric charge Q of the RN black hole on the fundamental QNMs are shown in Figs. 1-3. From Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), it can be seen that the real parts of the QNMs for both black holes increase with the magnetic charge Qm or the electric charge Q. The imaginary parts of the QNMs for the RN black hole increase first then decrease as the electric charge Q increases, which can be seen from Fig. 1(c). However, the situation for the imaginary parts of the charged black hole with scalar hair is different, which can be seen in Fig. 2. When 2 \u2264 l \u2264 6, an interesting phenomenon appears. The number of peaks of the QNMs\u2019 imaginary parts for the magnetic field \u03c8m (solid lines in Fig. 2) exactly equals to the value of l. While the number of peaks of QNMs\u2019 imaginary parts for the gravitational field \u03c8g (dashed lines in Fig. 2) is always less than that of the magnetic field \u03c8m. This phenomenon does not appear in the RN black hole. When l > 6, we do not find such particular phenomenon anymore. We can see from Fig. 3 that, when l = 7 and l = 8, the imaginary parts for both the magnetic field \u03c8m and the gravitational field \u03c8g increase with the magnetic charge Qm. When l = 9 and l = 10, the imaginary parts for the magnetic field \u03c8m decrease first then increase as the magnetic charge Qm increases, while the imaginary parts for the gravitational field \u03c8g increase with the magnetic charge Qm."

            "text": "In five-dimensional spacetime, based on the EinsteinMaxwell action (1), Bah and Heidmann proposed a nonsingular black hole/topology star. This is similar to the classical black hole in macrostate geometries, more importantly, it can be constructed from type IIB string\ntheory. Integrating the extra dimension y, the fivedimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory reduces to a fourdimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory which supports a spherically static black hole/topological star solution with a magnetic charge.\nWe investigated the QNMs of the charged black hole with scalar hair by studying the linear perturbation of the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field. Because of the spherical symmetry of the background spacetime, the radial parts of the perturbed fields can be decomposed from the angular parts. The angular parts can be expanded by the spherical harmonics. The background scalar field (6) and metric field (7) are even parity under the space inversion, however, the background magnetic field (15) is odd parity. So the scalar perturbation and even-parity parts of the metric perturbations couple to\nthe odd-parity parts of the electromagnetic perturbations to the linear order, and the odd-parity parts of the metric perturbations couple to the even-parity parts of the electromagnetic perturbations to the linear order, which we named as type-I and type-II couplings, respectively. For simplicity, we study the type-II coupling perturbations. Finally, we obtained two coupled perturbation equations (38) and (39). Because the extra dimension radius Ry can be eliminated from the master equations by a transformation of the electromagnetic field \u03c8m, the extra dimension radius Ry has no effect on the QNMs.\nUsing the matrix-valued direct integration method, we computed the fundament QNMs for both the gravitational perturbation and the magnetic field perturbation, which will dominate the ringdown wave at late time. The values of the frequencies of the fundamental QNMs for\nthe gravitational field \u03c8g and the magnetic field \u03c8m for different values of the magnetic charge Qm with l = 2 are shown in Tables. I and II. The differences of the frequencies of the fundamental QNMs between the charged black hole with scalar hair and the RN black hole are very small. So it almost can not distinguish them from the gravitational wave data. The effect of the magnetic charge Qm of the charged black hole with scalar hair on the fundamental QNMs are shown in Figs. 1(a), 2, and 3. The real parts of the QNMs increase with the magnetic charge Qm, which is similar to that of the RN black hole. An interesting phenomenon which does not find in the RN black hole is that, when 2 \u2264 l \u2264 6, the number of peaks of the fundamental QNMs\u2019 imaginary parts for the magnetic field \u03c8m exactly equals to the value of l. We only studied the type-II coupling perturbations, where the scalar field does not couple to the other two fields. So we expect that the type-I coupling perturba-\ntions will give us more information about the charged black hole with scalar hair, which will be studied in the future."
