    "abstractText": "We report the observation of nonlinear three-wave resonant interactions between two different branches of the dispersion relation of hydrodynamic waves, namely the gravity-capillary and sloshing modes. These atypical interactions are investigated within a torus of fluid for which the sloshing mode can be easily excited. A triadic resonance instability is then observed due to this three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism. An exponential growth of the instability and phase locking are evidenced. The efficiency of this interaction is found to be maximal when the gravity-capillary phase velocity matches the group velocity of the sloshing mode. For a stronger forcing, additional waves are generated by a cascade of three-wave interactions populating the wave spectrum. Such a three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism is probably not restricted to hydrodynamics and could be of interest in other systems involving several propagation modes.",

These atypical interactions are investigated within a torus of fluid for which the sloshing mode can be easily excited. A triadic resonance instability is then observed due to this three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism. An exponential growth of the instability and phase locking are evidenced. The efficiency of this interaction is found to be maximal when the gravity-capillary phase velocity matches the group velocity of the sloshing mode. For a stronger forcing, additional waves are generated by a cascade of three-wave interactions populating the wave spectrum. Such a three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism is probably not restricted to hydrodynamics and could be of interest in other systems involving several propagation modes.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNonlinear wave interactions occur in a variety of systems, where waves of different wavenumbers and frequencies can exchange energy through nonlinear couplings. Such interactions also form the basis for wave-turbulent regimes, where a whole ensemble of waves with different wavenumbers interact among each other and can exhibit a cascade of energy from large to small scales [1].\nThe case of three-wave interactions is prevalent in many areas, such as plasma physics [2, 3], nonlinear optics [4], Rossby waves [5], and even mechanical systems such as suspended cables [6] or thin rings [7]. For hydrodynamic surface waves, three-wave interactions have been extensively studied in the case of gravity-capillary waves [8, 9] and hydroelastic waves [10]. In the case of gravity waves, four-wave interactions dominate [11, 12]. However, considering one-dimensional (1D) deep-water propagation leads at the leading order to five-wave resonant interactions for either pure capillary waves [13] or pure gravity waves [14, 15].\nThree-wave systems can also be the source of instability [16]. Depending on the nonlinear coupling between the three waves, a single \u201cmother\u201d wave can give rise to two \u201cdaughter\u201d waves, that then grow exponentially in amplitude. The waves of this triadic resonant instability (TRI) satisfy both resonances in wavenumber and frequency and has been widely observed in internal waves in stratified flows [17\u201319], as well as in inertial waves [20, 21] providing a potential route to wave turbulence [22\u201325]. A special case of TRI is the parametric subharmonic instability, involving daughter waves with frequencies close to the first subharmonic of the mother wave and has been well investigated in areas such as plasma physics [26, 27] and oceanic systems [28].\n\u2217 E-mail: filip.novkoski@u-paris.fr \u2020 E-mail: chi-tuong.pham@upsaclay.fr \u2021 E-mail: eric.falcon@u-paris.fr\nGravity-capillary waves on the two-dimensional surface of a fluid are well-known in both the linear regime [29] as well as the nonlinear wave-turbulent case [30, 31]. When one of the dimensions of the system is much smaller than the other, for example in canals, sloshing waves become apparent [29, 32], and lead to longitudinal waves with associated discrete transverse modes. This results in a countably infinite number of branches in the dispersion relation, each corresponding to one of the transverse modes, similar to modes of waveguides [33].\nThe sloshing modes can theoretically trigger nonlinear interactions between waves belonging to different branches of the dispersion relation [34]. However, the study of the interaction between nonlinear waves of different types (i.e., belonging to separate branches) has not been investigated experimentally so far. Such an unexplored interaction mechanism could potentially be applicable in various domains such as two-component systems [35, 36], atomic lattices [37], or plasma physics [38]. Such multiple branch dispersion relations are also characteristic of waves in waveguides, for example in solid and soft plates [33]. Besides, it provides a way to test wave turbulence in media where multiple wave species are present [39] and bears a similarity to interactions between interfacial and free-surface waves [40, 41].\nHere, we will study the interaction between gravitycapillary waves and the first sloshing mode. To the best of our knowledge, such three-wave interactions have not been considered experimentally which is possibly due to the difficulty of cleanly exciting sloshing modes in typical experiments. The system under study is a torus of fluid, which has been shown to contain multiple modes of propagation, including sloshing [42], but also easily demonstrates nonlinear behavior, as shown in the case of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) solitons [43]. Because of its relatively small size (R \u2248 8 cm), the torus is easy to manipulate and excite.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, we describe in Sec. II the experimental setup and the different branches of the dispersion relation. Section III will then present\nar X\niv :2\n30 4.\n05 66\n8v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. fl\nudy\nn] 1\n2 A\npr 2\n02 3\n2\nthe experimental results related to the three-wave twobranch interaction. In particular, the sloshing branch can trigger a triadic resonant instability, generating two gravity-capillary waves, for which the wave growth rate and phase locking are characterized. The efficiency of this mechanism is shown to be mediated by a velocity matching between the two types of propagation modes. Finally, Sec. IV draws the conclusions."

The torus of fluid is formed by depositing distilled water on top of a circular plate that has been coated with a commercial superhydrophobic treatment. The plate has a triangular groove running along its perimeter, as is shown in Fig. 1a. The angle of the groove is \u03b1 = 4.5\u25e6. It prevents the closing of the central hole of the torus due to capillarity.\nThe waves are created by a Teflon plate connected to an electromagnetic shaker with adjustable sinusoidal amplitude and frequency typically in the range 7-9 Hz [see Fig. 1b]. The waves propagate azimuthally on both the inner and outer borders of the torus. The waves also experience dissipation, which is primarily due to friction of the triple contact line, and not necessarily viscosity [43]. The motion of the border of the torus is captured by a camera located directly above the plate. By using a contour extraction algorithm we obtain the displacement\n\u03b7(\u03b8, t) of the borders. We will be focusing on the motion of the outer border unless otherwise mentioned. The second method of detecting the border displacement is through the use of a custom-made local capacitive wire probe, giving the position of the outer border over time at a fixed azimuthal point \u03b80 with a high temporal resolution (2 kHz) [see Fig. 1a]. The central radius of the groove of the plate is R = 7 cm, while the torus size is fixed at the outer border radius Ro = 7.85 cm. The torus width is then fixed to W = Ro \u2212 Ri = 2(Ro \u2212 R) = 1.7 cm."

The signal goes from a sine wave into a superposition of various subharmonics.\nthey experience an effective gravity which is given by geff = g sin\u03b1 \u2248 0.77 ms\u22122. The effective surface tension is inferred from fitting the dispersion relation as \u03c3eff = 55 mN/m. This low value is due to the channel geometry and renormalization effects [44].\nAlongside the gravity-capillary branch, we consider the first sloshing mode, also given empirically as [42]\n\u03c92\u03a3 = \u03c9 2 0 + geff k2\u03b8 R , (2)\nfor values of k\u03b8 . 40, where \u03c90 is the cutoff frequency at k\u03b8 = 0. This relationship includes only gravity, and for higher frequencies surface tension needs to be taken into account. In the present work, we will assume that the relationship is a good approximation at the low wavenumbers we consider here.\nWe now turn to the nonlinear interactions between waves. Waves are capable of exchanging energy through nonlinear resonant interactions if they satisfy the conservation of both frequency and wavenumber, which in the case of three waves are\nk1 = k2 + k3 , \u03c91 = \u03c92 + \u03c93 , (3)\nwith \u03c9i = \u03c9(|ki|), \u03c9(k) being the dispersion relation of the considered system. The above equations can be solved once the dispersion relation of the waves is provided. In addition, the involved waves do not need to be of the same type and may belong to different dispersion branches. Depending on the studied system, solutions of Eq. (3) can also give only trivial solutions which do not lead to an exchange of energy. We will be interested in studying the interaction of the two different modes mentioned above i.e., between the first two branches in Fig. 2 (namely the gravity-capillary and first sloshing branch) and whether they satisfy the conditions given by Eq.

We measure the displacement of the outer border \u03b7(t) at a fixed point for three different amplitudes of forcing as shown in Fig. 3\nAt low forcing, \u03b7(t) very closely resembles a sine wave. By increasing the amplitude, \u03b7(t) changes significantly, indicating the existence of a critical forcing amplitude and seems to become a superposition of multiple different frequencies, while still preserving some quasi-periodicity.\nWe compute the time-frequency spectrum of \u03b7(t) (also called spectrograms) to distinguish the frequency components contained in the signal, as shown in Fig. 4 for the three forcing amplitudes. For a low forcing, a single frequency is found, corresponding precisely to the forcing one, f1. As the forcing is increased, two additional subharmonic frequencies appear, neither of which is located at f1/2. This behavior is characteristic of the triadic resonant instability, where, by forcing the system at a given pump frequency f1, two subharmonic waves, f2 and f3 are pumped up from zero amplitude and thus begin to deplete the pump. It is worth noting that the sum of these two new frequencies, f2 and f3 equals f1. We also see that a typical time (of the order of 10 s) is necessary for these waves to be established in the spectrum. As the amplitude of forcing is increased further, additional frequencies besides the first pair become visible but take more time to appear, and they do so after the original pair is established.\n4"

            "text": "To verify that the signals we observe are due to a resonant three-wave interaction, we first consider the spatiotemporal signal of the torus outer border \u03b7(\u03b8, t). We then compute the corresponding space and time Fourier transform \u03b7\u0303(k\u03b8, \u03c9) as shown in Fig. 5. It gives us not only the frequency but also wavenumber information of the waves present in the system. Figure 5 shows that the pumping frequency f1 excited the sloshing branch, and the corresponding part on the gravity-capillary branch, but also two lower frequency points, f2 and f3 on the gravity-capillary branch. Note that the discreteness in k\u03b8 is due to the torus finite size, whereas the one in f corresponds to the inverse of the total measurement time.\nThus, one has to consider the following resonant conditions\n\u03c9\u03a31 = \u03c9 gc 2 + \u03c9 gc 3 , k\u03b8 ( \u03c9\u03a31 ) = k\u03b8 (\u03c9 gc 2 ) + k\u03b8 (\u03c9 gc 3 ) ,\n(4)\nwhich can be solved graphically in the (k\u03b8, \u03c9) plane as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Experimentally we find the resonance conditions in both wavenumber and frequency to be verified by the points 1, 2, and 3 displayed in Fig. 5. Since the forcing frequency is known at all times, i.e., \u03c91 = \u03c9 \u03a3 1 , we solve exactly the above Eq. (4), using the two branches of the dispersion relation of Eqs. (1) and (2), leading to a system of four equations and four unknowns. Since no analytic solution exists, we look for the two unknown daughter frequencies f2 and f3 numerically. It is also important to note that one of the daughter waves will always have a negative wavenumber, i.e., it\nwill be counterpropagating with respect to the other two waves. If exclusively three interacting gravity-capillary waves are taken into account (i.e., no sloshing), no nontrivial solution to the above equations exists far from the capillary-gravity transition [45].\nDue to the periodicity of the system and its finite size, the dispersion relation of the torus is necessarily discrete [42]. If we denote by \u2206\u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9(k\u03b8 + 1) \u2212 \u03c9(k\u03b8) the frequency gap between two adjacent discrete wavenumber k\u03b8 and by \u0393\u03c9 the frequency nonlinear broadening of the dispersion relation, we can experimentally estimate whether discrete effects are to be taken into account (\u0393\u03c9/\u2206\u03c9 1) or if the system is in a kinetic regime (\u0393\u03c9/\u2206\u03c9 1) [46].

Both the numerical solution of Eq. (4) (dashed lines), and the experimentally found values (dots) of f1 and f2 are in very good agreement as shown in Fig. 7. As we can see the frequencies satisfy the conditions extremely well, and not only confirm the frequency matching condition but also wavenumber conservation since this is implicitly included when solving the resonance conditions in Eq. (4). This confirms that the system is experiencing a resonant three-wave (two-branch) interaction. We note that below the cutoff frequency \u03c90 of the sloshing branch (f0 < 7.1 Hz - see Figs. 2 and 5), no solution occurs in Fig. 7. Indeed, forcing below f0 does not lead experimentally to the appearance of nonlinear resonant interactions."

As we saw in Fig. 4 (middle), some typical time is needed for the transfer of energy from the mother wave f1 into the daughters f2 and f3. The temporal evolutions of the amplitudes of all three waves are shown in Fig. 8. Once the mother wave is established, (t < 3 s) it then increases rapidly up to a stationary out-of-equilibrium state (t > 10 s). The growth is indeed balanced by dissipation when it begins pumping the daughter waves which grow exponentially, (12 < t < 25 s). Eventually, all three reach a stationary state (t > 35 s). The exponential growth of the two daughter waves indicates that they undergo an instability. In addition, the mother wave reaches an initially higher amplitude which then decreases to the steady one, since it transfers energy to the two daughter waves through the instability. It is important to note that the three amplitudes are of the same order of magnitude, and the mother wave cannot be considered to be much stronger than the daughter waves as it is usual in three-wave resonant interactions [8, 11, 26]."

We instead focus only on the case where the pump-wave has a fixed amplitude A1 (the socalled pump-wave approximation).

Such an atypical velocity matching involving group and phase velocities differs from the usual phase-phase velocity matching [50], but has been considered theoretically for surface and internal waves [51, 52]. The energy transfer is thus found to be maximal when the carrier of a sloshing wavepacket has the same velocity as a gravity-capillary monochromatic wave for an identical wavenumber. Note that the efficiency of the wave interaction is thus related to the velocity matching, whereas the triadic interaction is the transfer mechanism.\nSloshing branches have previously been modeled, in the linear case, using systems of oscillators [53], while their nonlinear interaction remains more complicated. A model of the branch interaction would have to resemble the driven harmonic oscillator whose amplitude depends on \u03c92c\u2212\u03c923 , similar to that found in [9], where \u03c9c = \u03c9\u03a3(kc) is the frequency at which \u2126gcp = \u2126 \u03a3 g ."

            "text": "We have demonstrated the existence of nonlinear three-wave resonant interactions occurring between two different branches of the hydrodynamic wave dispersion relation, namely the gravity-capillary and sloshing modes. To the best of our knowledge, this three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism has never been reported experimentally in any wave system.\nThe system used is a torus of fluid for which the sloshing mode can easily be excited. When subjected to a weak monochromatic forcing, a triadic resonance instability is first observed with an exponential growth of the daughter waves and a phase locking of the three waves. The efficiency of this interaction is found to be maximum when the gravity-capillary phase velocity matches the group velocity of the sloshing mode. The interaction between waves belonging to these two branches can be considered as an analog of a forced harmonic oscillator. For stronger forcing, additional waves are generated by a cascade of three-wave interactions populating the high-\nfrequency part of the wave spectrum. Since this mechanism authorizes three-wave interactions in a 1D system far from the gravity-capillary transition, it thus paves the way to reach a wave turbulence regime triggered by this atypical mechanism.\nIn the future, we plan to explore the role of the system periodicity on the wave interactions and on a possible wave turbulence regime, as previously shown for solitons [43]. Finally, such a three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism is probably not restricted to hydrodynamics and could be of primary interest in other fields involving several propagation modes, such as elastic plates [33], or optical waveguides [55]."
