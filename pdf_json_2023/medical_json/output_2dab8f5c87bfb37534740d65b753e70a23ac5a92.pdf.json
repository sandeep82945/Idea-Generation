The objective of this study was to explore the impact of the pandemic on the prevention of alcohol, drugs and tobacco (ADT) in Sweden during 2020\u201321 considering socio-demographic context. Methods: Data were collected through the Public Health Agency\u2019s survey on ADT prevention in Swedish municipalities (N\u00bc290). This study used data from 2020 and 2021, with a response rate of 90% and 88%, respectively. Survey data were analyzed in logistic regression models (odds ratios, P< 0.05, 95% confidence intervals) against variables of education level, income level and population size from national registers. Results: A majority (n\u00bc 198, 76%) of the municipalities reported a decrease in ADT prevention during the pandemic. No correlation between the decrease in ADT prevention and socio-demographic conditions was detected. A majority (2020: n\u00bc165, 63%; 2021: n\u00bc174, 68%) of the municipalities also reported that ADT prevention was adapted, however less common in smaller municipalities and municipalities where residents had lower levels of education and lower incomes. Conclusion: ADT prevention carried out by municipalities in Sweden was initially (2020) deeply affected by the preventive strategies against COVID-19. Adaptation of activities was less common in municipalities with more vulnerable socio-demographic situation. In policy, practice and research, the findings are important not only for continued progress on the national goal of equity in health but also for preparedness for future crises. . . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . ."

            "text": "P ublic health is determined by societal conditions, individuals\u2019 living and working conditions, social context and lifestyle habits as well as factors that the individual carries in the form of age, gender and genetic conditions.1 Inequalities in health arise from the fact that the presence of health-promoting and health-threatening determinants differs between groups in the population and that the factors affect some groups to a greater degree than others. It takes a wide range of efforts to address and reduce health inequalities, from the empowering of individuals to the strengthening of the public sector and its capacity to provide through all stages of life.2\nOn 11 March 2020, World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic.3 In Sweden, as in many other countries, measures were put in place to limit the spread of the virus and prevent disease.\nIn Sweden, the municipalities are the main performers of alcohol, drugs and tobacco (ADT) prevention at the local level. The reason being that preventive activities are mostly performed in schools, in social services and in the leisure activity sector, i.e. arenas where the municipalities have a high degree of responsibility.4 We know from previous studies, based on Swedish survey data, that municipalities with a more vulnerable socio-demographic situation provide less ADT prevention, despite higher levels of disease and injuries linked to ADT.5\nThe societal strategies against COVID-19 are likely to have affected a variety of health-promoting and preventive interventions,\nfrom targeting the social determinants of health to assisting individuals at risk. Local prevention against the use and harm from ADT had to deal with several challenges in order to reach targeted groups, mainly from the recommendations on physical distance. Further, the impact on ADT prevention during the pandemic years may have varied between municipalities in a way that challenge the national public health policy of good and equitable health.6,7\nThe aim of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 on ADT prevention in Swedish municipalities considering socio-demographic context."

The respondents of the survey are municipal prevention coordinators or individuals in similar positions. The current study includes two sets of web-based questionnaire data from this survey, in which questions regarding ADT prevention related to the COVID-19 pandemic were included. The first data collection was conducted between November 2020 and February 2021 and the second between November 2021 and February 2022.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurpub/article/33/6/1109/7237445 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nOutcome measures: ADT prevention The outcome measures of the study were different types of ADT prevention in the public health practice of Swedish municipalities.\nThe purpose of the first data collection was to follow up on how the measures taken to limit the spread and disease of COVID-19 had affected ADT prevention in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was done by asking three questions: if ADT prevention had decreased, if ADT prevention had increased and if ADT prevention had been adapted, all as a consequence of the COVID19 pandemic. It was possible to respond with yes/no/cannot assess on all three questions. To aid the respondents, these questions included examples of different types of ADT prevention that could be affected:\n\u2022 Decreased ADT prevention could be the cancellation of planned activities such as ADT lectures for parents. \u2022 Increased ADT prevention could be increased information about health and other services in social media. \u2022 Adapted ADT prevention could be different ways to adapt or adjust activities such as having meetings outdoors or in smaller groups.\nThe purpose of the second data collection of follow-up was to capture how ADT prevention had been affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the years 2020 and 2021, i.e. the dominant pandemic period in Sweden. This was done by asking one question: if ADT prevention had been adapted as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020\u201321. It was possible to respond with yes/no/cannot assess.\nAs such, the sets of data from the first and second follow-up differed in the sense of capturing shorter impact vs. longer impact from the pandemic. Both sets included free-text options linked to the questions on the pandemic effect on ADT prevention, but this is only used for illustrating and discussing the quantitative results.\nExplanatory variables: socio-demographic context In order to understand the potential variation of the pandemic\u2019s impact on ADT prevention, questionnaire data were supplemented by population-based register data in socio-demographic context. The explanatory variables used at the municipality level were education (proportion of the population with 3 years of post-graduate education or more),8 income (household mean income)9 and population size of municipalities.10 We used the most recently published data on education, income and population size, i.e. for education and income in the years 2019 and 2020, and for population size 2020 and 2021.\nExplanatory variables were coded into three categories: lower quartile, interquartile range (used as the reference category) and higher quartile. In the Results section, the explanatory sociodemographic variables will be referred to as education, income and population, and the three categories will be referred to as low, reference and high."

Differences in the distributions of outcome measures by explanatory variables (education, income and population) were tested by the chi-squared test.\nThe associations between ADT prevention and the explanatory variables were further analyzed by logistic regression analyses yielding odds ratios (ORs). First, results were computed as ORs in crude\nmodels (one socio-demographic variable and one ADT prevention variable), next as adjusted ORs models (each socio-demographic variable adjusted for one other variable) and finally as fully adjusted models where each socio-demographic variable was adjusted for the other two variables.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical software package, version 4.1.1.

Education and income levels have slightly increased overall, but population size has seen a small decrease in municipalities up to mean size, and vice versa in larger municipalities.\nThere is a strong correlation between education and income [(2020, q\u00bc 0.72), (2021, q\u00bc 0.69)], and education and population (2020 and 2021, q\u00bc 0.73). There is less but still considerable correlation also between income and population [(2020, q\u00bc 0.50), (2021, q\u00bc 0.48)].\nComparison of response and non-response There are only minor differences in socio-demographic situation between municipalities participating and not participating in the survey 2020 and 2021 (see details in Supplementary table S1).\nImpact of the pandemic on ADT prevention, first-year follow-up A majority of municipalities reported that the pandemic had led to a decrease in local ADT prevention, i.e. cancellation of planned activities (n\u00bc 198, 76%) in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eventually, many municipalities found ways to adapt their activities so that ADT prevention could be carried out to some extent (n\u00bc 165, 63%). Common themes for adaptations were digital\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for explanatory variables used in analyses on 2020 and 2021 survey data\nExplanatory variable Measure 2020 2021\nPost-graduate education (%) Min 9.9 10.2 Lower quartile 14.5 14.9 Mean 17.9 18.3 Higher quartile 23.2 23.8 Max 57.9 58.6 Household mean income (KSEK) Min 283.7 289.1 Lower quartile 330.2 339.8 Mean 354.7 358.9 Higher quartile 387.2 391.2 Max 695.2 681.7 Population (n) Min 2398 2391 Lower quartile 10 045 10 037 Mean 16 031 16 208 Higher quartile 36 207 36 288 Max 974 812 977 161\nNote: KSEK, thousands Swedish krona.\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurpub/article/33/6/1109/7237445 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nmeetings instead of physical meetings, outdoor activities instead of indoor activities, and new or more formats such as films and more written material. Also, organizational adaptations such as replacing drop-in visits with booked appointments, limiting the number of visitors, using larger premises and extending the opening hours.\nA third of the municipalities (n\u00bc 87, 33%) reported an increase in ADT prevention as a consequence of the pandemic, e.g. more communication of information in social media. Around 9% (n\u00bc 23) could not assess whether ADT prevention had been affected by the pandemic in 2020.\nThe decrease in ADT prevention affected municipalities in a similar way, whereas increased and adapted ADT prevention differed depending on the socio-demographic situation of the municipalities. The better the socio-demographic situation, the greater the impact on ADT prevention. This gradient is most evident when it comes to reporting adapted ADT prevention by all studied socio-demographic variables (see details in Supplementary table S2).\nIn crude regression models, municipalities with high education and high population were significantly more likely to report adapted ADT prevention than the reference categories. Municipalities with low income and low population were less likely to report that they had adapted ADT prevention in 2020 (figure 1).\nIn adjusted logistic regression models, municipalities with low income were still less likely to report adapted ADT prevention after adjusting for education (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15\u20130.64, P< 0.05), as well as population (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22\u20130.87, P< 0.05), compared with the reference category. Further, municipalities with low population remained less likely, although borderline statistical significance, to report adapted ADT prevention after adjusting for education (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27\u20131.01, P\u00bc 0.055) but not when adjusting for income (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37\u20131.47, P\u00bc 0.377).\nIn the fully adjusted logistic regression model where each sociodemographic variable was adjusted for the other two variables in the analyses, municipalities with low income remained less likely to report adapted ADT prevention than the reference category (figure 2).\nImpact of the pandemic on adapted ADT prevention, second-year follow-up A majority of municipalities (n\u00bc 174, 68%) reported that they had adapted their ADT prevention activities in 2020\u201321. Eighteen percent (n\u00bc 46) could not assess whether ADT prevention had been adapted as a consequence of the pandemic. The crude logistic regression models show that municipalities with high education were more likely to report adapted ADT prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic years 2020\u201321, thus capturing a longer impact of the pandemic. In comparison with the reference category, it was more than twice as common with adaptation in municipalities with high education\n(OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.12\u20134.49, P< 0.05). In municipalities with a small population, it tends to be less common to report adapted ADT prevention (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29\u20131.06, P\u00bc 0.074), whereas it seems to be more common in large population municipalities (OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.98\u20133.96, P\u00bc 0.062), compared with the reference category. Income does not explain variation between municipalities regarding the adaptation of ADT prevention.\nIn adjusted logistic regression models municipalities with high education are almost three times more likely to report adaptation when adjusting for income (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.34\u20136.30, P< 0.01). However, the effect of a high level of education decreases when we adjust for population and is no longer significant (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.69\u20133.37, P\u00bc 0.308). The effect in the crude analyses for population becomes significant when we adjust for income. In small municipalities, it is less common to report adapted ADT prevention (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20\u20130.88, P< 0.05), and in large municipalities, it is more than twice as common to report adaptation (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.07\u2013 4.42, P< 0.05). When the population is adjusted for education, the effect on ADT prevention remains on similar levels for small municipalities (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.27\u20131.08, P\u00bc 0.083) and decreases for large municipalities (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.78\u20133.79, P\u00bc 0.188), compared with the crude analyses, although still not statistically significant.\nIn the fully adjusted logistic regression model of adjusting the effect of population with education and income, it becomes less common for small municipalities to report adapted ADT prevention. When the effect of high education is adjusted for both income and population, it is still twice as common to report adapted ADT- prevention, although the effect is not statistically significant (figure 3)."

During the first year of the pandemic (2020), there was an overall decrease in ADT activities across the board, with no correlation to socio-demographic situation. However, the ability to adapt and carry out preventive activities shows a pattern from an equity perspective, correlating with levels of education and income, and population size in the municipalities. Seen as for example in that municipalities with low education were less likely to report adapted activities (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18\u20130.79, P< 0.05). In a follow-up analysis, capturing a longer impact of the pandemic (2020\u201321), adaptation of ADT prevention was less common in municipalities with a small population (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.93, P< 0.05).\nFigure 1 Crude logistic regression analyses with adapted ADT activities in 2020 as the outcome variable (interquartile range as the reference category)\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurpub/article/33/6/1109/7237445 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024"

            "text": "Municipalities in Sweden with a more vulnerable socio-demographic situation, for example with a lower proportion of highly educated people and with lower household incomes, have more extensive ADT-related harm and less extensive ADT preventive work.5 Our study shows that the municipalities\u2019 ability to adapt their ADT prevention during the pandemic also differs based on the sociodemographic situation. A majority of the municipalities, regardless of education and income levels or population size, stated that ADT prevention decreased in 2020. In contrast, low-income level (2020) and low population size (2020\u201321) were linked to less adaption, whereas (although borderline significant) high education level (2020\u201321) were linked to more adaption.\nOur results from the first-year follow-up in 2020 show the initial response and more immediate impact of the pandemic on ADT prevention. The second-year follow-up, with questions capturing both 2020 and 2021, is a reflection of the longer impact where the experiences and adaptations in ADT prevention made at an early stage were used. The burden of ADT-related harm and mortality is significant,11 and also differs between groups in the population. A decrease in ADT prevention runs the risk of particularly affecting groups with a higher risk of ill health, especially if we lack the ability to make adaptations to the ADT preventive work. Taken together, the pandemic effects on ADT prevention may have increased the risk of inequalities in ill health and other problems linked to alcohol, drugs and tobacco.\nQualitative data acquired in the 2020 survey from free-text answers indicate that efforts were made more often to adapt activities\nwhere children and young people were target groups, e.g. activities outdoors and in small groups. But the general public and parents were also common target groups for adapted activities. Often adapting ADT activities meant a digital approach when possible to replace, e.g. in-person meetings, seminars, and ways to inform and educate about ADT.12 This shift to digital solutions has also been seen in other public health areas during the pandemic, for example in diagnosis and healthcare delivery.13 Barriers in this shift such as for example technical challenges and age are also discussed14 and could transfer also to implications of our results. A digital transition can reduce accessibility for certain groups, who might not have the tools or the skills required. Some municipalities may have increased their already ongoing use of digital ways to reach out to specific groups and the general public during the pandemic, while for other municipalities, it may have been a resource-demanding transition. A question for further studies is thus how the transition to a digital approach has worked, both in terms of efficiency in general and consequences for equity in health.\nMeasures in the society to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have impacted public health in different ways, both directly and indirectly, and are likely to also have affected public health practice such as ADT prevention activities. Most of the recently published articles concern, as far as we have seen, how the pandemic has affected work (and employees), in care and treatment within the healthcare system in different settings. The need to learn from the lessons that the pandemic forced upon us is discussed in several studies looking at the healthcare system. Typically on the theme of adverse working conditions for the working force within healthcare, e.g. employees being stretched to their limits. And additionally, they have\nFigure 2 Fully adjusted logistic regression analyses\u2014where each explanatory variable was adjusted for the other two variables\u2014with adapted ADT prevention in 2020 as the outcome variable (interquartile range as the reference category)\nFigure 3 Logistic regression analyses\u2014where each explanatory variable was adjusted for the other two variables\u2014with adapted ADT activities in 2020\u201321 as the outcome variable (interquartile range as the reference category)\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurpub/article/33/6/1109/7237445 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nexperienced that their efforts have not always been appreciated.15\u201317 Main focus of our study is on preventive work and also outside of healthcare, which makes any direct comparisons of results difficult to make. But, care and treatment together with preventive work share the challenge to build back better. The pandemic showed the need to address health inequalities, not least to increase preparedness for future crises and prevent health gaps from growing even further as a consequence.18"

            "text": "Among the strengths of this study is the uniqueness of the collected data. It is an annual total survey on local prevention of alcohol, drugs, tobacco and gambling from a public health perspective where all Swedish municipalities are invited to participate. Since this is a total survey with a high response rate ( 90%), we have chosen to consider non-significant results (P > 0.05). ORs showing that something is substantially more or less common in comparison can be important indications and should be part of our understanding of the population we study. Therefore, we have chosen to highlight some odds ratios (ORs) in the results that are just outside the significance range.\nWe found a relatively large (23%) non-response in small municipalities compared with the reference category (10%) and the large municipalities (4%). This could lead to an underestimation of sociodemographic differences as we are comparing both small and large municipalities/categories to the reference in our analysis.\nThose who answered the surveys might have interpreted our question of adaptation of ADT prevention differently. Both a decrease and an increase in activities could have been understood as an adaptation. However, in the free-text part of the questions we found that the examples given by the respondents were in most cases precisely examples of activities that had been adapted and carried out in new ways. With this experience, the question was adjusted in the next survey in a way which means that the comparison of how the municipalities responded to the surveys must be done with caution."

            "text": "We have shown that the local ADT prevention in Swedish municipalities decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also, that the ability to adapt activities to conform to the restrictions was dependent on socio-demographic context. This may challenge the national public health goal of good and equitable health. Hence, our results from the pandemic years 2020 and 2021 should be discussed and scrutinized in policy, practice and research by decision-makers and implementers at all levels. Lessons made will be important not only for the continued ADT prevention but also for the preparedness for future crises. We believe a more resilient society can be realized by prioritizing the distribution of resources and other support in ways that strengthens the conditions for people most vulnerable to health risks."
