INTRODUCTION\nLinear optical spectroscopy is a crucial analytical tool in biology, chemistry, materials science, molecular physics, and various other disciplines. It provides information about, i.a., the dipole strengths and orientations1\u20133, energy landscape4\u20137, exciton structure8,9, and stoichiometry10 in pigment aggregates. In principle, all the information contained in an experimental spectrum could be extracted by comparison with exact simulations. The exact calculation of linear spectra is possible for Gaussian environmental fluctuations11, but is computationally expensive, and is generally only performed in order to benchmark approximate calculations on simple systems. One reliable approach for the calculation of exact spectra is the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) method11,12, which requires solving many tiers of equations for the system\u2019s reduced density matrix and is therefore memory intensive13. The addition of a single high-frequency mode to the environment\u2019s spectral density greatly increases the number of equations that have to be solved14. An alternative approach is the method of Exact Stochastic Path Integral Evaluation (PI), which is easier to implement than HEOM, converges faster, and is not memory intensive15. Nevertheless, as we discuss in this article, this method also scales poorly with the number of high-frequency modes.\nThe intractability of exact methods prevents their use for the calculation of ensemble spectra of large, disordered aggregates with complex system\u2013environment coupling. Many different approaches to the approximate calculation of linear optical spectra exist16\u201319. Most of these methods rely on the second-order cumulant expansion of the system\u2013environment coupling, and they differ mainly in their treatment of the off-diagonal elements of this coupling in the exciton basis. In two common and economical approaches, the time-independent Redfield and modified Redfield rates are included phenomenologically in the calculation of linear spectra to account for the lifetime broadening of electronic transitions6,19,20. A more explicit treatment of the second-order cumulant expansion brings about the Full Cumulant Expansion (FCE) method18,21, for which the time-dependent expressions are slower to evaluate than the rates of the Redfield-type methods, but are more accurate. Application of the secular approximation to FCE yields the faster, but less accurate, coherent time-dependent Redfield (ctR) method19.\nWhen calculating approximate spectra, it is essential to know what level of accuracy to\n2\nexpect from the method that is used, under which conditions it may be substituted with a more cost-efficient one, and what effect different approximations have on the quality of spectra. Since the approximate methods discussed above are used frequently, rely on different, common, approximations, and vary significantly in speed, their comparison provides valuable insight into the capabilities and limitations of approximate methods in general and how they may be improved. Although some of these approximate methods have been compared with one another, the previous comparisons were either done for a specific system without much variation in parameters21 or for model systems with unrealistic system\u2013environment coupling19,22. Therefore, there is clearly a need for a systematic comparison of approximate methods for calculating linear spectra in a system with realistic system\u2013environment coupling.\nGelzinis et al.19 compared the accuracy of absorption spectra obtained for a dimer using the ctR, Redfield and modified Redfield methods. They calculated the spectral qualities as functions of various system and environment parameters which they varied one at a time. Inhomogeneous disorder, for instance, was considered as one of their parameters, but was set to zero when other parameters were varied. They found ctR spectra to agree significantly better with exact spectra over a wide range of parameter values than spectra calculated with the Redfield and modified Redfield methods. They also found the modified Redfield method to perform worst for all the parameter values that they considered. For most of their calculations, Gelzinis et al. used an overdamped Brownian oscillator spectral density without any underdamped (high-frequency) modes. They included a single high-frequency mode for one of their comparison calculations and treated its energy as the only variable in that comparison.\nCupellini et al.21 used the FCE and modified Redfield methods to calculate absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the purple bacterial light-harvesting complex LH2 and compared these spectra to experimental data. The FCE spectra agreed better with experimental spectra than the modified Redfield spectra did. However, because of the uncertainty about the true molecular parameters, none of the spectra agreed well with the experimental spectra, and their comparison is consequently not as conclusive as it would be for a model study.\nIn real pigment aggregates, many of the parameters considered by Gelzinis et al., such as the amplitude and shape of the environmental spectral density and the variance of the\n3\ninhomogeneous disorder, can be estimated accurately and have similar values for a wide range of aggregates. The parameters that typically have the largest variation in the simulation of spectra are the temperature, energies of pigments, and interpigment couplings.\nTo our knowledge, neither FCE nor ctR has been used for the calculation of linear dichroism (LD) spectra, and the non-secular dipole dependence of LD has not been previously derived. In this article, we compare absorption, LD, and CD spectra calculated with the FCE, ctR, standard Redfield, and modified Redfield methods. We determine the dependence of the spectral accuracy on the simultaneous variation of pigment energy and interpigment coupling at two different temperatures for inhomogeneously broadened absorption-type spectra. Unlike Gelzinis et al.19, who used HEOM for their exact calculations, we calculate exact spectra using the more economical PI method15. This allows us to better model environmental interactions by including eight high-frequency modes in our spectral density. In order for our conclusions to be accurate for photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, we use the parameters of the first eight intramolecular modes of chlorophyll a. The inclusion of several high-frequency modes allows us to determine the effect of excitonic energy gap resonance with intramolecular modes on the quality of calculated linear spectra."

(2)\nFor a molecular system composed of multiple interacting molecules with optical band gaps,\n4\nthe electronic ground state is the collective electronic state in which all molecules are found in their respective electronic ground states. Optical properties of the system are characterized by transitions to the so-called single exciton band, which is composed of collective electronic states with an excitation residing on a single molecule of the system. For a light-harvesting complex with N pigment molecules, the ground state |g\u3009 can thus be represented by a tensor product of molecular ground states |g\u3009 =\nN\u220f n=1 |gn\u3009, where |gn\u3009 is the ground state of pigment\nn. There are N collective singly excited states represented by |n\u3009 = N\u220f m=1 m 6=n |gm\u3009 | n\u3009, where | n\u3009 denotes the electronically excited state of pigment n. The system Hamiltonian, the so-called Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian, involves the energies \u03b5n of these collective states and their mutual interaction energies Jmn. It has the general form\nH\u0302S = N\u2211\nn=1\n\u03b5n |n\u3009 \u3008n|+ N\u2211\nn=1\nN\u2211\nm=1 m 6=n\nJmn |m\u3009 \u3008n| , (3)\nwhere the ground-state energy is set to zero and \u03b5n is the energy of the vertical (FranckCondon) transition on pigment n.\nElectronic transitions observed by spectroscopic means occur between the ground state and excited eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3). These eigenstates can be found by performing an affine exciton transformation on H\u0302S, which renders it in the simple form:\nH\u0302S = N\u2211\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b5\u03b1 |\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03b1| , (4)\nwhere the exciton states are linear combinations of the site excitations, i.e., |\u03b1\u3009 = N\u2211 n=1\ncn\u03b1 |n\u3009, and \u03b5\u03b1 represent the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian.\nThe exciton energies are modulated by nuclear fluctuations in the pigment molecules and their environment and are therefore coupled to phonon modes of the environment and intramolecular vibrational modes. These modes together constitute the bath and are modeled as an infinite set of independent harmonic oscillators,\nH\u0302B = \u221e\u2211\nk=1\n\u03c9k 2 (p\u03022k + q\u0302 2 k)\u2297 I\u0302S, (5)\nwhere I\u0302S is the identity operator in the system\u2019s Hilbert space, and \u03c9k, p\u0302k, and q\u0302k are the frequency and position and momentum operators of the kth mode, respectively. In this\n5\narticle, we use units such that ~ = 1. Typically, the system\u2013bath coupling is assumed to be linear:\nH\u0302SB = \u2212 \u221e\u2211\nk=1\nN\u2211\nn=1\n\u03c9kdk,nnq\u0302k |n\u3009 \u3008n| , (6)\nand its strength is characterized by the reorganization energy\n\u03bbn = \u221e\u2211\nk=1\n\u03c9k 2 d2k,nn (7)\nassociated with each electronic transition. The reorganization energy can often be estimated from experimental measurements (e.g. from the Stokes shift) and depends on the dimensionless shift dk,nn of the excited state harmonic potential energy surface with respect to the ground state potential energy surface. In Eq. (6), spatial dimensions were separated so that q\u0302k is a scalar operator.\nThe light\u2013matter interaction is treated through linear coupling to a classical electric field\nE(t):\nH\u0302rad-mat(t) = \u2212\u00b5\u0302 \u00b7E(t), (8)\nwith the transition dipole moment operator given by\n\u00b5\u0302 = N\u2211\nn=1\n\u00b5n(|n\u3009 \u3008g|+ |g\u3009 \u3008n|), (9)\nwhere the vector \u00b5n is the transition dipole moment of the transition from the ground to the excited state on the nth molecule. The dipole moments are assumed to be independent of the nuclear coordinates (i.e., the Condon approximation is made)."

It is well known that the non-secular Redfield relaxation tensor may lead to positivity breakdown in the excited state population dynamics, while the secular form in Eq. (27) (as the so-called Lindbladian) yields strictly positive populations. When calculating linear spectra, the non-positivity may not be problematic, since the coherence block of the density matrix, which takes part in the evaluation of the linear spectra, evolves independently of the block of excited state dynamics. Although often quantitatively incorrect, the non-secular Redfield rates shows the right qualitative behaviour in describing non-secular effects in the linear spectra25. The secular approximation may significantly decrease the size of the computational problem, especially for large pigment aggregates, however, and is therefore used in this study."

An ensemble size of 5000 was used for disordered calculations of approximate absorption-type spectra.\nFor the PI method, disorder sampling commutes with Monte Carlo integration15. The noise trajectories were calculated using the procedure described by Moix et al.15, and the stochastic integration was performed with the second-order weak technique described in Appendix B. We found the second-order weak technique significantly more accurate than the first-order strong Milstein method (weak and strong approximations guarantee convergence\n12\nof the statistical moments and of individual trajectories, respectively, to a certain order\u2014 see Kloeden and Platen31 for an extensive discussion of stochastic differential equations and their solution).\nWe evaluated approximate spectra by comparing them to the exact spectra determined from PI, using the quality factor defined by Gelzinis et al.19 as a measure of the correctness of an approximate spectrum:\nQ =\n\u222b\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 ( SPI(\u03c9) \u2229 Sapproximate(\u03c9) ) \u222b\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 ( SPI(\u03c9) \u222a Sapproximate(\u03c9) ) , (35)\nwhere SPI and Sapproximate are the normalized spectra obtained from PI and an approximate method, respectively. In Eq. (35), \u2229 and \u222a denote the intersection and union of spectra, respectively.\nAll the absorption-type spectra (OD, LD, and CD) can be obtained from the absorption tensor IA(t) by element-wise multiplication with the relevant symmetrical dipole factor matrix fmn (see Eqs. (13), (14), and (15)). Since the spectra were normalized when calculating quality, only the ratio of the dipole matrix elements is important. For simplicity, we omitted the frequency and energy prefactors in Eqs. (13) and (14) when calculating spectra. For the most part, we consider the following four dipole factor matrices in our calculations:\nf 1,00,1 =\n 1 0\n0 1\n  , f 1,11,1 =  1 1\n1 1\n  , (36)\nf 1,\u22121\u22121,0 =   1 \u22121 \u22121 0   , and f 0,11,0 =  0 1 1 0   ,\nwhere f 1,00,1 and f 1,1 1,1 correspond to absorption spectra when the two dipole moments of the dimer have equal strength and are orthogonal and parallel to each other, respectively, f 1,\u22121\u22121,0 corresponds to an LD spectrum with \u00b51 a unit vector orthogonal to the LD axis (see Appendix A), \u00b52 at the magic angle (54.7 \u25e6) relative to the LD axis, and \u00b51 \u00b7\u00b52 = \u22121, and f 0,11,0 is the dipole factor for CD.\nNote that the secular approximation is almost fully valid for the dipole factor f 1,00,1 , for which Eq. (13) amounts to a trace over the (Fourier-transformed) absorption tensor. The trace is basis-independent and therefore depends only on the diagonal elements of the secular absorption tensor in the exciton basis. Transfer between these diagonal tensor elements is calculated secularly for the ctR, Redfield, and modified Redfield methods but corresponds\n13\nvery well with interdiagonal transfer for the nonsecular FCE method, as shown in Section IV B."

            "text": "In order to determine the accuracy of the approximate methods for different Hamiltonians, we varied and J in Eq. (32) independently in the ranges [0, 500] cm\u22121 and [\u221255, 55] cm\u22121, respectively. The obtained qualities for inhomogeneously broadened absorption-type spectra are shown in Fig. 1 for different dipole factors at 300 K. Spectra of selected coupling\u2013energy gap pairs (indicated for the FCE qualities in Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 2.\nIt is clear from Fig. 1 that absorption-type spectra calculated with FCE are more accurate than spectra calculated with any of the other methods for the dipole factors in this figure. The quality of these FCE spectra is practically independent of the site energy gap and coupling, and spectra for systems with many pigments (i.e., many different site energies and couplings) may therefore be calculated with predictable quality.\nIn Section II C 1 we noted that the second-order cumulant expansion may be exact when q\u0302(t) in Eq. (18) is a Gaussian process. This expansion indeed leads to exact expressions in the case of a monomeric system (or polymeric system with no interpigment coupling), when the bath is harmonic and H\u0302SB is linear in system and bath operators. Since all of the approximate methods were derived using the second-order cumulant expansion, this perfect correspondence can be seen in Figs. 1a, b and d for all the methods at zero coupling. The perfect agreement of spectra is also seen in Fig. 2b, where spectra for the different methods are shown for the coupling\u2013energy gap pair (0, 500) cm\u22121 and the dipole factor f 1,11,1 . The case for the coupling being exactly zero is not shown for CD qualities (Fig. 1c) since CD spectra are then identically zero.\nFor an excitonically coupled system, the cumulant expansion is exact for the treatment of fluctuations induced by the diagonal elements of the system-bath coupling Hamiltonian in the exciton basis. It is not exact for fluctuations induced by the off-diagonal elements, however, since terms that depend on these elements also include excitonic propagators ei\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2t (see Eqs. (24) and (25))19. In spite of the second-order truncation, the FCE method is\n14\n1,1 , (c) the CD\ndipole factor f0,11,0 , and (d) the LD dipole factor f 1,\u22121 \u22121,0 . A disorder of \u03c3FWHM = 140 cm \u22121 was used for approximate spectra. The coupling\u2013energy gap pairs for which spectra are shown in Fig. 2 are\nindicated with red frames and the inscribed labels correspond with the respective labels in Fig. 2.\nremarkably accurate for the calculation of most spectra in the considered site energy gap and coupling ranges, as seen in Figs. 1a, b and d. Only for the CD spectrum (Fig. 1c), when the anti-diagonal dipole factor prescribes significant inclusion of off-diagonal systembath coupling effects (see Section IV C), and the second-order truncation is therefore least accurate, is the quality of FCE absorption-type spectra notably worse than for the exact\n15\napproach.\nThe secular approximation is made in the derivation of the ctR, Redfield and modified Redfield methods but not in the derivation of the FCE method. In fact, this approximation is the only difference between the FCE and ctR methods. For secular methods, the off-diagonal elements of the absorption tensor (Eq. (12)) are zero in the exciton basis. The discrepancy\n16\nin quality between FCE and ctR spectra therefore depends on the contribution of these off-diagonal (i.e., nonsecular) elements to the FCE spectra. The spectral contribution from the nonsecular elements depends on both the dipole factor and the system-bath coupling Hamiltonian.\nAs discussed in Section III, the dipole factor f 1,00,1 corresponds to the calculation of a nonsecular spectrum, also for secular methods. The isolated effect of the dipole factor on the quality of absorption spectra is seen in Figs. 1a and b, where the secular approximation is fully valid for Fig. 1a (see Section III), while, for the same dipole strengths, it is least accurate for Fig. 1b. The dependence of the spectra on the dipole factor also causes the poor quality of the secular CD spectra seen in Fig. 1c, since the CD dipole factor, f 0,11,0 , corresponds poorly with f 1,00,1 . A detailed discussion of the dependence of spectral accuracy on the dipole factor is given in Section IV C.\nWhen the system-bath coupling is treated within the secular approximation, it induces population relaxation but not transfer between exciton populations and coherences, and the off-diagonal elements of the secular absorption tensors therefore remain zero. Such nonsecular transfer dynamics, when considered, would influence the exciton structure by changing the contribution of sites to exciton states in a process called the dynamic localization of excitons32. For the FCE method, nonsecular contributions are due to bath correlation functions of the form C\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 or C\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2. The factor \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 defining these correlation functions (see Eq. (22)) is small for small site energy gaps and weak couplings (Fig. S1), and for these parameters the qualities of ctR spectra are therefore almost as high as the qualities of FCE spectra (see Figs. 1b and d). The quality of CD spectra calculated with the ctR method also corresponds best with FCE qualities at small site energy gaps but (as discussed in Section IV B) CD spectra depend strongly on nonsecular elements when the coupling is weak, so that the ctR qualities differ significantly from the FCE qualities for weak coupling. The high accuracy of the secular approximation for small site energy gaps and weak couplings is contrary to the expectation20,29 that the negative effects of neglected dynamic localization on spectral quality are strongest under these conditions. CD spectra calculated with the ctR, Redfield or modified Redfield methods are impacted considerably by both the second-order truncation in the cumulant expansion and by the secular approximation, and their quality is poor for all site energy gaps and couplings considered in Fig. 1.\nThe quality of absorption-type spectra calculated using the Redfield method depends\n17\nsimilarly on the site energy gap and coupling as the quality of modified Redfield spectra. As shown in Fig. 1, these methods yield spectra that are less accurate than FCE and ctR spectra. The difference between the former pair of spectra and ctR spectra (which serve as proxy for the more accurate spectra) is most pronounced at small site energy gaps and strong coupling. The reason for this difference is the energy shift and narrowing of Redfield and modified Redfield spectra relative to ctR spectra, as seen in Fig. 2a for the coupling\u2013energy gap pair (55, 0) cm\u22121 and dipole factor f 1,00,1 . These spectral differences are due to the fact that the Redfield and modified Redfield rates in Eqs. (27) and (28) are real quantities, whereas the corresponding term, \u03be(t), in Eq. (25) is complex19. Fig. S2 shows the Redfield and long-time ctR rates that were not corrected for pigment participation in excitons (i.e., \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 was set equal to 1 in Eq. (22)). As seen in this figure, the imaginary rate-induced energy splitting in ctR spectra increases with the difference between exciton energies (exciton gap) for small exciton gaps, while the rate-induced spectral shift stays fairly constant at a value of about 30 cm\u22121 (see Figs. S2 and 2a). Although the rate-induced splitting in ctR spectra decreases momentarily for exciton gaps larger than about 35 cm\u22121, the disorder-averaged participation factor \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 increases with coupling strength for fixed energy (see Fig. S1), and the resultant effect is the worsening of Redfield and modified Redfield qualities with increasing coupling strength, especially for small site energy gaps. Note that the participation factor, \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1, is a noncontinuous function of coupling strength at zero site energy gap when inhomogeneous disorder is not included (it has a value of 0 for zero coupling and 0.5 otherwise). When inhomogeneous disorder is accounted for realistically at small site energy gaps, however, \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 is a smooth function of the coupling strength, and the phenomenological inclusion of dynamic localization in the theory20,29 is therefore not necessary to counteract excessive delocalization. Based on the (already) good agreement between the secular ctR and nonsecular FCE spectra at small site energy gaps, such attempts to account for nonsecular effects will likely not improve the quality of Redfield and modified Redfield spectra. Although the exciton gap is largest for the largest values of the site energy gap and coupling in Fig. 1, the excitons for these parameters are strongly localized (as seen from the small values for \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 in Fig. S1) and the population transfer rates between excitons are therefore small. Fig. 1a shows that the qualities of Redfield and modified Redfield spectra improve markedly with the magnitude of the site energy gap, due to the diminishing contribution from population transfer rates. In contrast to the results\n18\nof Gelzinis et al., the modified Redfield method performs slightly better than the Redfield method for the parameters considered in Fig. 1.\nThe qualities in Fig. 1 are generally symmetric in the coupling between sites, but some asymmetries are apparent, the most noticeable of which is the asymmetry between the coupling\u2013energy gap pairs (55, 220) cm\u22121 and (\u221255, 220) cm\u22121 for the LD qualities in Fig. 1d. In Fig. 2d, spectra from all the methods are shown for the parameters (55, 220) cm\u22121, and the PI, FCE and ctR spectra are shown for the parameters (\u221255, 220) cm\u22121. Although the exciton energies, pigment participations, ( cn\u03b1 )2 (but not cn\u03b1), and dipole factor are the same for these two coupling\u2013energy gap pairs, the spectra differ significantly. As discussed in Section III, the dipole factor, f 1,\u22121\u22121,0 , used in Fig. 1d corresponds to an LD measurement of a dimer in which the high-energy pigment is orthogonal to the LD axis and the other pigment is at the magic angle with the LD axis. For (\u221255, 220) cm\u22121, the high-energy exciton contributes most intensely to the spectrum. For (55, 220) cm\u22121, however, the spectral contribution is most intense for the exciton to which the LD-forbidden low-energy pigment contributes predominantly. This borrowing of excitation directly illustrates excitonic quantum superposition between states of local excitation and shows the principle by which forbidden transitions can be probed through their coupling with allowed transitions. Notice that the secular spectra differ significantly from PI and FCE spectra for (55, 220) cm\u22121, which indicates that nonsecular transfer effects are important when excitons cannot be excited directly through interaction with light.\nThe dependence of the spectral quality on the site energy gap and coupling at 100 K is qualitatively very similar to the dependence shown in Fig. 1. An image plot of spectral qualities at 100 K, similar to Fig. 1, is shown in Fig. S3."

            "text": "For the calculations in this section, the excitonic coupling was set to J = 15 cm\u22121 (an average value for most photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes) or J = 100 cm\u22121 (a strong coupling for these complexes), and the site energy gap was varied from 0 to 500 cm\u22121. For each site energy gap, the excitonic energy gap was calculated as the difference between exciton energies. Fig. 3 shows the quality of inhomogeneously broadened approximate absorption-type spectra as a function of the excitonic energy gap at 300 K. The high-\n19\nfrequency spectral density is also included in these figures and was multiplied by a factor 1/\u03c92 so that the peak heights of the underdamped modes are proportional to their HuangRhys factors. As discussed in Section III, these underdamped modes correspond to the first eight (from a total of 48) high-frequency vibrations of LHCII, which are mostly due to intramolecular vibrations in the chlorophyll a molecule. The sixth vibrational mode has the largest Huang-Rhys factor of all the modes of LHCII, and the spectral density considered in this article is therefore a good model of the system-bath coupling in a complex system like LHCII.\nIt is clear from Fig. 3 that, at 300 K, the FCE method produces accurate spectra for moderate (J = 15 cm\u22121) and strong (J = 100 cm\u22121) coupling for all of the considered dipole factors. This method performs worst for the calculation of CD spectra, for which it is still 95% accurate. As discussed in Section IV A, the full cumulant expansion is inexact due to the contribution of excitonic propagators to the absorption tensor. For a given exciton gap, the excitation delocalization scales with the coupling strength, and the pigment participation factors \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 (with \u03b1 6= \u03b2) therefore increase with coupling (see Fig. S1). Since \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 are the coefficients of terms in Eq. (21) that contain excitonic propagators, the FCE method is less accurate for strong coupling than for moderate coupling (for the same exciton gap). As noted in Section IV A, the near independence of FCE qualities on Hamiltonian parameters allows this method to be used for the calculation of absorption-type spectra with a constant, predictable error.\nFor moderate coupling, the ctR absorption and LD spectra of which the qualities are shown in Figs. 3a, b, and d, deviate less than 4% from the exact spectra, and the quality of these spectra is also nearly constant over the range of exciton energy gaps considered. For strong coupling, the quality of ctR absorption spectra corresponds with the quality of FCE spectra when the secular approximation is valid (Fig. 3a), but deviates significantly from the exact spectra for other dipole factors (Fig. 3b-d). The CD spectra are produced by dynamics of the electronic coherence between the ground state and delocalized excited states. The more delocalized the excitons are, the smaller the relative contribution of nonsecular dynamics to the CD spectrum, and the more accurately the spectrum can be calculated with a secular method. For this reason, the ctR CD spectra have a higher quality for small energy gaps or for strong coupling, when excitons are more delocalized, than for large gaps or moderate coupling. As discussed in Section IV A, the electronic transition on the second pigment\n20\nis LD-forbidden for the dipole factor f 1,\u22121\u22121,0 , and excitons that are predominantly localized on this pigment contribute to the LD spectrum mainly via transfer from other excitons. When excitons are fully delocalized, such transfer occurs due to population relaxation, as can be seen by comparing the coefficients for population transfer \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 and nonsecular transfer \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 in Fig. S1 for low site energy gaps. For strong coupling and larger energy gaps, however, \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 is comparable to or greater than \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 (see Fig. S1), indicating that nonsecular transfer effects are important for the accurate description of LD spectra that depend on interexciton dynamics.\nFor moderate coupling, the quality of Redfield and modified Redfield spectra at excitonic energy gaps larger than about 250 cm\u22121 corresponds almost exactly with the quality of ctR spectra. As discussed in Section IV A, the excitons are localized at large energy gaps and differences between the rate calculations for these methods have a negligible effect. For strong coupling, the difference in accuracy between ctR spectra and Redfield-type spectra also decreases with exciton gap, but is still present for large gaps in Fig. 3, since excitons are not yet fully localized when the coupling is strong. The inaccuracy in the calculation of Redfield and modified Redfield spectra may lead to their quality being incidentally better than for ctR spectra (Fig. 3c, d).\nThe quality of absorption-type spectra at 100 K (Fig. S4) depends similarly on the excitonic energy gap as the quality at 300 K, although at 100 K, the Redfield and modified Redfield methods produce even poorer qualities for small exciton energy gaps than they do at 300 K.\nThe quality of absorption-type spectra with zero disorder is shown in Figs. S5 (for T = 100 K and J = 100 cm\u22121) and S6 (for T = 300 K and J = 15 cm\u22121). For each coupling strength, the overall accuracy of these spectra depends similarly on the excitonic energy gap as the accuracy for inhomogeneously broadened spectra. For zero disorder, however, spectra calculated with the Redfield method are significantly less accurate than inhomogeneously broadened spectra when the energy gap is resonant with intramolecular modes. No decrease in accuracy around resonance frequencies is seen for any of the other methods in Figs. S5 and S6. For the calculation of modified Redfield rates, the Fourier-transformed correlation function is convoluted with the Fourier transform of several other time-dependent functions (see Eq. (28)), and the accuracy therefore depends more smoothly on the frequency. The sensitivity of Redfield spectra to resonance agrees well with the results obtained by Gelzinis\n21\net al.19, where the authors used a single intramolecular mode with reorganization energy \u03bb = 15 cm\u22121, comparable to the reorganization energy of \u2248 17 cm\u22121 of the sixth mode in our study. The insensitivity of modified Redfield qualities to resonance is in contrast to the small but significant decrease in quality seen by Gelzinis et al. around the resonance frequency in their study. When using a single-mode spectral density with the parameters of Gelzinis et al., the quality of modified Redfield spectra was indeed lowest at resonance (not shown) but was less sensitive to the excitonic energy gap than the quality of Gelzinis et al., likely due to the different forms used for the underdamped modes in our study and theirs (compare Eq. (34) with Eq. (31) in their article19). For the full spectral density used in our study, the insensitivity of the modified Redfield quality to resonance with a particular underdamped mode may be attributed to the convoluting influence of the other modes.\nAs discussed in Section II C 3, the Redfield and modified Redfield methods depend on the long-time rates\u2014the integrands in Eqs. (27) and (28) may persist for several picoseconds, especially at low temperature. For the temperatures considered in this study, however, the absorption tensor decays in a few hundred femtoseconds and the short-time dynamics of population transfer are therefore important. The necessity of accurately accounting for the short-time dynamics is illustrated by the fact that the quality of spectra calculated using the complex long-time ctR rates (see Fig. S2) is also strongly sensitive to resonance with intramolecular modes (not shown). The non-Markovianity of methods, and not merely the presence of imaginary contributions, therefore helps to prevent sensitivity of spectra to resonance with intramolecular modes. Apart from the non-complexity of their rate contributions (as discussed above), the Redfield and modified Redfield methods are also impacted by the Markovianity of their rates, and these methods therefore perform significantly worse than ctR and FCE.\nThe sensitivity of quality to resonance is significantly reduced at 300 K and J = 15 cm\u22121 (Fig. S6), when the weaker coupling causes localization already for small exciton gaps. When inhomogeneous disorder is treated realistically, the accuracy of spectra is independent of resonance with intramolecular modes and is therefore of no concern for the calculation of disordered bulk absorption-type spectra.\nAs discussed in Section IV A, correlation functions of the form C\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 in Eq. (21) are zero for the site energy gap being zero (corresponding to the smallest exciton gap) and nonsecular effects are therefore absent. For this reason, the ctR and FCE methods correspond exactly\n22\nfor the smallest exciton gap when the disorder is zero, and compare well when disorder is included.\nThe ratio of qualities obtained for the full spectral density and for a spectral density in which only the fourth intramolecular mode was included, is shown in Fig. S9 for J = 100 cm\u22121 at 300 K. This ratio does not depend straightforwardly on the excitonic energy gap, but is close to one for FCE and ctR spectra, indicating that the accuracy of these methods is independent of the number of high-frequency modes, and the discussion in this article pertaining to the FCE and ctR methods is likely valid for the full spectral density (with 48 modes). The quality of spectra calculated using the Redfield and modified Redfield methods may be significantly poorer for the spectral density with eight modes than for the one with a single mode, and spectra calculated with the full (48 mode) spectral density may therefore be of poorer quality than what is predicted by the analysis in this study."

In this section, we determine the dependence of the quality of absorption-type spectra on a generalized dipole factor.\nTo calculate the quality of approximate spectra, we normalized the spectra to their absolute maxima. Only the ratios of the dipole factor matrix elements in Eq. (13) are therefore important. Figs. 4a and b show the quality of absorption-type spectra for J = 15 cm\u22121 and J = 100 cm\u22121, respectively, at 300 K as a function of the off-diagonal and diagonal element of the (bottom-right normalized) dipole factor matrix\nf f11,f12f12, 1 =  f11 f12 f12 1   .

The peak heights of the high-frequency spectral\ndensity (black line) are proportional to the Huang-Rhys factors of the intramolecular modes.\nthe off-diagonal elements. For moderate coupling (Fig. 4a), the quality of ctR spectra is also high for dipole factors in the same ranges, but it is significantly worse than the quality of FCE spectra when the magnitudes of the off-diagonal elements of the dipole factor are large. For\n24\n25\nstrong coupling, dipole factors with large off-diagonal magnitudes produce more accurate ctR spectra than they do for moderate coupling. The reasons for the last two observations were discussed in Section IV B for CD spectra, for which the off-diagonal elements are infinitely large compared to the diagonal elements. The ctR method performs as good as FCE for the dipole factor f 1,00,1 , but its accuracy (and hence the accuracy of the secular approximation) for other dipole factors depends on the coupling strength. For moderate coupling, nonsecular transfer is weaker than for strong coupling, and the secular approximation is valid for a broader range of off-diagonal dipole factor elements. When the coupling is strong, the spectral quality for some LD dipole factors is worse than for CD dipole factors, and the quality depends nontrivially on the dipole factor. The accuracy of the secular approximation, as a function of the dipole factor, can be modeled straightforwardly by considering the transformation of a time-independent matrix that summarizes the absorption tensor. Such a model is shown in Fig. S7 for the exciton gaps 101 cm\u22121 (J = 15 cm\u22121) and 297 cm\u22121 (J = 100 cm\u22121) and corresponds well with the ctR qualities in Fig. 4. Notice that the FCE qualities show a similar dependence on the dipole factor as ctR (albeit with less sensitivity) and as the expected accuracy of the secular approximation (Fig. S7). This dependence is explained by noting that the diagonal elements of the exciton-basis absorption tensor contains terms for which the second-order cumulant expansion is exact (Eq. (24)) together with inexact terms that contain excitonic propagators (Eq. (25)), whereas the off-diagonal elements only contain terms with propagators. For spectra with strong relative contribution from the diagonal tensor elements (i.e., spectra for which the secular approximation performs well), the relative contribution of the terms with excitonic propagators is smallest, and the FCE method therefore performs the best.\nThe quality of Redfield and modified Redfield spectra depends similarly on the dipole factor as the ctR spectra for the exciton energy gaps shown in Fig. 4, but these techniques perform worse than ctR for all dipole factors.\nAt the smallest possible excitonic energy gap (30 cm\u22121 for J = 15 cm\u22121 and 200 cm\u22121 for J = 100 cm\u22121), the quality of absorption-type spectra is nearly zero for the dipole factor (f11, f12) = (\u22121, 0). For this dipole factor, the LD spectrum is close to zero and the error in the stochastic integration is large\u2014and the quality factor is therefore meaningless. Note that many of the LD dipole factors of CP29 correspond with (f11, f12) = (\u22121, 0) and therefore may contribute little to the total LD spectrum.\n26\nAt the energy gap of 101 cm\u22121 for J = 15 cm\u22121 and the dipole factor characterized by (f11, f12) = (\u22121, 3), the FCE and PI spectra contain clear vibronic contributions (as shown in Fig. S8), which are absent in the results of the secular methods. Due to the strong vibronic contribution, the FCE and PI spectra agree qualitatively well with each other but differ significantly from the other spectra, which is the cause for the poor quality produced by the ctR, Redfield and modified Redfield methods.\nFor moderate coupling, almost all of the absorption and LD dipole factors of the lightharvesting complex CP29 lie in the domain for which the FCE and ctR methods are accurate (as determined for the dimer considered in this study). As discussed above, the CD spectra deviate significantly from the exact spectra. Note, however, that contribution from the intrinsic CD strength of pigment molecules33 may cause significant differences between experimental spectra and exact spectra calculated from the excitonic contribution alone. For this reason, the use of accurate methods for the calculation of CD spectra may not be worth their cost. For strong coupling, LD contributions from many of the pigment pairs in CP29 may be considerably impacted by the poor performance of the secular methods. Given the similar dipole strengths of the chlorophyll pigments in other light-harvesting complexes, and the fact that the dipole vectors in CP29 do not have a particular ordered arrangement, the secular LD spectra of light-harvesting complexes that contain strongly coupled pigments may, in general, correspond poorly to exact spectra.\nIn photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, the average delocalization length varies from slightly more than one pigment for the PCE545 complex of cryptophytes34 to seven or eight pigments in the circularly symmetrical bacterial complexes LH1 and LH235 and the chlorosome antenna of green sulphur bacteria36. The delocalization length in CP29 is estimated to be two to four pigments29. The qualities at the smallest and largest energy gaps in either Fig. 4a or b represent the cases for delocalized and predominantly localized excitons in a dimer, respectively. Based on the similarity between the dependence of these qualities on the dipole factor for FCE, we conclude that the results of this study will likely extend to aggregates with multiple pigments and that the FCE method may therefore be applied to calculate accurate absorption-type spectra of aggregates with multiple pigments, irrespective of the coupling between pigments. The same reasoning may be applied to the ctR method, and absorption and LD spectra may therefore likely be calculated qualitatively accurately with the ctR method when all the pigments in a pigment aggregate are mod-\n27\nerately coupled (i.e., with couplings on the order of 15 cm\u22121). For strong coupling, the spectral quality of ctR differs significantly in its dependence on the dipole factor for localized and delocalized excitons, and extension of results in this study to the case for multiple pigments is not straightforward. Based on the dependence of accuracy on the dipole factor for intermediate delocalized states (297 cm\u22121), however, LD spectra for partially localized states in multipigment aggregates may have poor quality."

            "text": "In this study, we assessed the accuracy of approximate linear absorption-type spectra calculated with the FCE, ctR, Redfield and modified Redfield methods. We used a pigment dimer as a model system and considered a realistic model spectral density for photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes in plants. We included inhomogeneous disorder and calculated the accuracy of spectra at 300 K and 100 K. Among the approximate methods considered in this study, FCE performs best for the calculation of all types of linear spectra for all molecular parameters and at all temperatures. This method is most accurate for absorption spectra and least accurate for CD spectra. However, for the latter it is still about 95% accurate. The ctR method performs well for the calculation of absorption and LD spectra when the interpigment coupling is moderately large (\u223c 15 cm\u22121) but performs poorly for the calculation of CD spectra for moderate coupling. Spectra calculated with the ctR method are generally of much lower quality when strong interpigment coupling is present, but absorption spectra are still at least 93% accurate (for the parameters in this study). When strong coupling is present, ctR LD spectra may be of lower quality than CD spectra, and the spectra calculated with both of these techniques may differ more than 15% from the exact spectra. The Redfield and modified Redfield methods perform worse than the ctR method under nearly all circumstances and most notably when the coupling between pigment molecules is strong or the difference between site energies is small, and should not be used if a more accurate method is available. The quality of approximate spectra is not sensitive to resonance of the exciton gap with intramolecular modes when inhomogeneous disorder is included realistically, and the spectral accuracy is nearly independent of the temperature.\nFuture work may focus on quantitatively extending the results in this study to pigment aggregates with more than two pigment molecules, especially when strong interpigment\n28\ncoupling is present and on determining the dependence of spectral quality for fluorescence spectra calculated with these methods."

            "text": "An LD spectrum is the difference between absorption spectra measured for two light beams with mutually perpendicular polarization vectors. For a beam propagating in the (Cartesian) y\u0302 direction, the LD spectrum is\nILD(\u03c9) = IAz (\u03c9)\u2212 IAx (\u03c9), (A1)\nwhere x and z indicates the polarization of the light used to illuminate the sample. LD spectra of small molecules are often measured by means of gel compression. For this technique, complexes are dissolved in a polyacrylamide solvent, which forms a gel37. The gel is then compressed along the x\u0302 and y\u0302 dimensions by a factor k \u2208 (0, 1) and allowed to expand along the z\u0302 dimension. The LD spectrum (Eq. (A1)) is measured in the compressed state.\nTo derive the dipole factor f\u00b5,LDmn in Eq. (15), we perform the following mental experiment. We consider a small macroscopic volume V of the uncompressed gel containing many disk-shaped complexes, each with N pigments. The complexes are randomly oriented and therefore produce no LD signal. Without changing their orientations, we take all the complexes in V and arrange them on the surface of a sphere that fits within V , such that the\n29\nnormal vectors to the discs (which we assume can be assigned unambiguously) point radially outward. Since we measure the far-field LD spectrum, no signal is produced from this arrangement. We then compress the gel. The complexes now lie on the surface of an ellipsoid of which we can determine the geometry from the compression factor k. For this arrangement, the LD signal is nonzero. We now place the complexes at their original positions on the surface of the sphere, again without changing their orientations. While the complexes are spaced uniformly on the surface of the sphere, their normal vectors do not point radially outward. Instead, in spherical coordinates, the zenith angle \u03b2 for the normal vectors can be expressed in terms of the zenith angle \u03c6 of their position vectors (which do point radially outward) as\n\u03b2 = \u03c0 2 \u2212 tan\u22121(k tan(\u03c0 2 \u2212 \u03c6)). (A2)\nNow consider the dipole moment of pigment m, \u00b5m, that makes an angle \u03b1 with the normal vector of its disc. Since the molecules were randomly oriented originally, the many dipoles \u00b5m at any coarse-grained position on the spherical surface, populate a cone. For the complexes on the pole (\u03c6 = \u03b2 = 0), the dipole cone is parameterized as:\n  \u00b5m,x \u00b5m,y\n\u00b5m,z\n  = |\u00b5m|   sin\u03b1 cos t sin\u03b1 sin t\ncos\u03b1.\n  t \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0) (A3)\nIn general, for a disk normal vector pointing in the spherical angular direction (\u03b2, \u03b3), the\nparameterized dipole cone is determined from Eq. (A3) by consecutive Euler rotations as\n  \u00b5m,x \u00b5m,y\n\u00b5m,z\n  = |\u00b5m|   cos \u03b3(cos \u03b2 sin\u03b1 cos t+ sin \u03b2 cos\u03b1)\u2212 sin \u03b3 sin\u03b1 sin t sin \u03b3(cos \u03b2 sin\u03b1 cos t+ sin \u03b2 cos\u03b1) + cos \u03b3 sin\u03b1 sin t\n\u2212 sin \u03b2 sin\u03b1 cos t+ cos \u03b2 cos\u03b1\n  . (A4)\nWe can now calculate the LD dipole factor by performing a surface integral over the surface of the sphere (over which the complexes are uniformly distributed). We also integrate over the coordinate t that parameterizes the dipole cone around the disk normal:\nf\u00b5,LDmn = \u222b 2\u03c0 0 dt \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03b3 \u222b \u03c0/2 0 d\u03c6 [ \u00b5m,z\u00b5n,z (A5)\n\u2212 \u00b5m,x\u00b5n,x ] sin\u03c6.\n30\nBy using the parametrization of Eq.
