The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is:

"However, these may be in some cases related to specific chemical features of the complexes, and thus, it may be difficult to tackle them within a simple coarse-grained model, such as the present one. Instead, a case that would be interesting to study with the present framework is that of a much weaker electrostatic interaction, that could lead to reversible assembly and disassembly of NPs from the microgels. In the present simulations, the interactions are quite strong, even for the case q = âˆ’10 e, so that reversible association occurs very rarely during the course of the simulations. However, we repeated simulations for independent runs and such non-equilibrium effects were found not to qualitatively affect the reported results. Nonetheless, we expect that reversible association could change the present behavior at least in some aspects and, therefore, it will be the subject of future investigations."
