    "abstractText": "Background: Oral health surveys largely facilitate the prevention and treatment of oral diseases as well as the awareness of population health status. As oral health is always surveyed from a variety of perspectives, it is a difficult and complicated task to gain insights from multidimensional oral health surveys. Objective: We aimed to develop a visualization framework for the visual analytics and deep mining of multidimensional oral health surveys. Methods: First, diseases and groups were embedded into data portraits based on their multidimensional attributes. Subsequently, group classification and correlation pattern extraction were conducted to explore the correlation features among diseases, behaviors, symptoms, and cognitions. On the basis of the feature mining of diseases, groups, behaviors, and their attributes, a knowledge graph was constructed to reveal semantic information, integrate the graph query function, and describe the features of intrigue to users. Results: A visualization framework was implemented for the exploration of multidimensional oral health surveys. A series of user-friendly interactions were integrated to propose a visual analysis system that can help users further achieve the regulations of oral health conditions. Conclusions: A visualization framework is provided in this paper with a set of meaningful user interactions integrated, enabling users to intuitively understand the oral health situation and conduct in-depth data exploration and analysis. Case studies based on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in the exploration of oral diseases. (JMIR Med Inform 2023;11:e46275) doi: 10.2196/46275",

As oral health is always surveyed from a variety of perspectives, it is a difficult and complicated task to gain insights from multidimensional oral health surveys.\nObjective: We aimed to develop a visualization framework for the visual analytics and deep mining of multidimensional oral health surveys.\nMethods: First, diseases and groups were embedded into data portraits based on their multidimensional attributes. Subsequently, group classification and correlation pattern extraction were conducted to explore the correlation features among diseases, behaviors, symptoms, and cognitions. On the basis of the feature mining of diseases, groups, behaviors, and their attributes, a knowledge graph was constructed to reveal semantic information, integrate the graph query function, and describe the features of intrigue to users.\nResults: A visualization framework was implemented for the exploration of multidimensional oral health surveys. A series of user-friendly interactions were integrated to propose a visual analysis system that can help users further achieve the regulations of oral health conditions.\nConclusions: A visualization framework is provided in this paper with a set of meaningful user interactions integrated, enabling users to intuitively understand the oral health situation and conduct in-depth data exploration and analysis.

Oral infections and inflammatory factors have been proven to be highly related to chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus [1]. In the field of clinical medicine, oral diseases can be prevented and treated\nby means of regular professional dental treatments and appropriate oral hygiene practices, which would do great favors for oral health, advance systemic well-being, and improve the quality of life.\nAs an effective way to investigate oral health status, oral health surveys can determine the frequency, intensity, and spread of oral diseases, such as oral behaviors, oral health cognition, and quality of life in a particular time frame [2]. On the basis of the\nJMIR Med Inform 2023 | vol. 11 | e46275 | p. 1https://medinform.jmir.org/2023/1/e46275 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nanalysis and mining of oral health surveys, we can obtain deeper insights into the oral health status of individuals, understand oral diseases, and identify their impacting factors.\nHowever, oral health surveys are always conducted from different perspectives and thus, are presented in the form of multiple dimensions. Traditional data mining methods always use simple statistical charts to visualize surveys, which are limited for the efficient and intuitive mining of deep-seated information. For example, it is difficult to observe the differences and similarities among different oral diseases. The oral health status across different areas and age groups lacks representative descriptions and intuitive comparisons. Thus, it is a difficult task to gain insights from multidimensional oral health surveys, especially for the exploration of relationships among diseases, behaviors, symptoms, and other attributes.\nAfter a series of in-depth discussions with domain experts in the field of stomatology, it was concluded that a visualization system can deliver more comprehensive, interactive, and understandable information to users, which can further help them analyze oral health data rapidly and effectively. However, some challenges remain in implementing an oral health survey\u2013oriented visualization system:\n\u2022 Challenge 1: both oral diseases and related individuals have different general traits, which makes it difficult to present and compare the different characteristics of oral diseases in addition to their related populations (groups). \u2022 Challenge 2: the occurrence and progression of oral diseases have their own rules, and unhealthy or careless behaviors will prompt the rise of oral diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the correlations between the diseases and behaviors. \u2022 Challenge 3: oral health surveys include a rich set of data attributes, such as groups, diseases, and behaviors, which present various semantic relationships. It would be of great interest to explore the semantic relations from multidimensional attributes and provide an intelligent retrieval tool based on these relations.\nTo address the challenges, we developed a visualization framework for the visual analytics and deep mining of multidimensional oral health surveys. First, we designed a set of visualizations to depict the characteristics of diseases and groups combined with multidimensional attributes, such as the struct view, radar view, and cloud view, allowing the comparison of the different traits between various oral diseases and groups (challenge 1). We then designed a scatterplot matrix to analyze the correlation between diseases, behaviors, symptoms, and cognition based on group information, which can further help users discover the relationships among diseases, behaviors, and other attributes (challenge 2). Furthermore, a knowledge graph was designed to integrate diseases, groups, behaviors, and other information, allowing users to gain an overarching view of people with oral diseases. In addition, a query function was provided to conduct personalized retrieval, allowing users to obtain a more detailed understanding of human interests (challenge 3). A visualization framework was implemented to integrate a set of meaningful interactions, allowing users to obtain deeper insights into the patterns of oral\ndiseases according to their requirements. Case studies based on real-world data sets were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in visual analytics and deep mining of oral health surveys.\nThe major contributions of our work are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The characteristics of diseases and groups were depicted through portraits in light of multidimensional attributes, enabling users to intuitively and efficiently convey and disseminate information. \u2022 A visualization framework was implemented to enable users to visually analyze and deeply mine the correlation features among oral diseases, behaviors, symptoms, and cognitions. \u2022 A knowledge graph visualization was designed to generate structured knowledge containing semantics, supporting efficient queries on groups or attributes to grasp the semantic characteristics of multidimensional oral health surveys from macro and micro perspectives."

With the development of science and technology, multidimensional data have been reflected in a variety of fields. The oral surveys used in this study were multidimensional data with attributes, such as diseases, regions, ages, and behaviors. Currently, multidimensional data visualization includes spatial mapping,\nJMIR Med Inform 2023 | vol. 11 | e46275 | p. 2https://medinform.jmir.org/2023/1/e46275 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nglyph [12], small multiples [13], and other methods. Examples of spatial mapping include scatterplot matrices [14,15], parallel coordinates [16,17], table lenses [18], pixel charts [19], and dimensionality reduction [20,21]. Scatterplot matrices and parallel coordinates are the 2 most widely used multidimensional data visualization strategies. The scatterplot matrix presents high-dimensional data using scatterplots, arranging them based on attributes. This mapping from multidimensional to 2D space helps identify correlations, clusters, outliers, and other notable characteristics. It is a valuable tool for exploring and analyzing complex data sets. Parallel coordinates use a series of parallel axes to represent each variable dimension of high-dimensional data, with the position along each axis corresponding to the variable\u2019s value.\nIn addition to the conventional multidimensional visualizations mentioned above, users can use data portraits [22] to define and describe the various attributes of objects. Data portraits provide a more tangible representation of multidimensional data, allowing for a condensed and effective perception of information panoramas; for example, Xiong and Donath [23] proposed a novel graphical representation based on users\u2019past interactions, encoding people\u2019s data with flower and garden metaphors. He et al [24] used accounting indexes to draw the data portrait of the value creation index of all 17 industries, by means of which the characteristics of various industries under COVID-19 can be captured. In this study, we applied data portraits to depict diseases and groups of different regions, genders, and ages."

It serves as a semantic network that reveals the connections between various elements. Knowledge extraction [26], knowledge fusion [27], and knowledge reasoning [28] are the fundamental components involved in constructing a knowledge graph. Knowledge extraction is the process of extracting valuable structured information from large-scale text data, where entity extraction [29] refers to identifying specific entity objects in the text, whereas relation extraction involves extracting the associations and connections between entities. Knowledge fusion involves leveraging technologies such as information extraction, entity alignment, and relationship linking to integrate knowledge from multiple knowledge graphs. This integration results in a more comprehensive, consistent, and accurate knowledge system that enhances knowledge discovery, inference, and application. Knowledge reasoning can generate new factual conclusions by using entity and relation information, thereby expanding the knowledge graph. This process can be categorized into 3 types: logical rule\u2013based reasoning [30], distributed feature representation\u2013based reasoning [31], and deep learning\u2013based reasoning [32].\nThe data derived from knowledge reasoning can be leveraged in a variety of downstream tasks related to knowledge graphs, such as recommendation systems [33], question answering [34], and information retrieval [35]. For instance, Li et al [36] introduced KG4Vis, a knowledge graph\u2013based visual recommendation method that learns the embedding of\nknowledge graph entities and relations to capture ideal visual rules. Sousa and Couto [37] provided a new system, named K-BiOnt, by integrating knowledge graphs into biomedical relation extraction, improving the system\u2019s ability to identify true relations. Tang et al [38] proposed an intelligent question-answering search system for electric power domain knowledge. The system uses knowledge reasoning to retrieve and analyze information accurately and presents the query results in a visual format.

Clicking a small rectangle on the screen will display the region, gender, age, and urban and rural areas, along with the prevalence value. In total, 17 diseases were identified. To accommodate the limited screen space and enhance visual presentation, users can use sliding blocks. Radar View Radar view is a widely used metaphor in visualization. It allows for the presentation and comparison of group characteristics based on area, age, and gender. We developed a radar view specifically for this purpose. When the user selects a group, the radar view displays the disease attribute values in the specified region and age group for both men and women. Each axis maps the number of teeth with a type of oral disease to comprehend and compare the oral disease status of men and women in a fixed region and fixed age from a single radar view.

The original data provide the prevalence rate and average number of teeth for the disease attribute in each group.

Drink sweat milk, for instance, divides individuals into 4 categories: seldom, 1 per month, 1 per week, and \u22651 per day. It is challenging to evaluate and compare the strengths of each group in these attributes. To address this, we calculated the weighted average and converted it to a value between 0 and 1, known as the strength value.

Here, we applied internet-based methods for users to select the disease, behavior, cognition, and symptom tags in the control panel. The selected tags served as dimensions in a scatterplot matrix view. As we need to use groups to model the associations between the attributes, we first selected several groups within the group view (Figure 2B). In the scatterplot matrix view located on the diagonal, the histogram is used to show and compare the performance of the selected groups in the corresponding attributes. For disease attributes, the height of the bar maps the prevalence, whereas for behaviors, cognitions, or symptoms, the height of the bar depicts the strength value. Scatterplots outside the diagonal are deployed to present 2-by-2 relationships between attributes, with each scatter representing a group. The scatterplot has 2 dimensions: the strength value of the attribute or the normalized number of teeth. Owing to their symmetrical nature, we designed a matrix above the diagonal that offers relationships for all groups, whereas the matrix below the diagonal presents the relationships of the currently selected group under the corresponding attributes.

These relations can be broken down into 4 categories: group has diseases, group holds behaviors, group shows symptoms, and group carries cognitions. There are 112 group entities in\nthe graph; for example, \u201cJianggan District, 12-15 years old, female.\u201d\nTo characterize groups based on multidimensional attributes and establish the association between groups, we categorized the average tooth value for disease and the strength values of behavior, symptoms, and cognition under the guidance of experts. By considering the numerical distribution of all groups across each attribute and their respective strengths, we divided them into 4 to 5 categories. There are 66 disease entities, including the 4 categories of decayed tooth (DT) due to caries: almost noDT (DT1), mild DT (DT2), moderate DT (DT3), and severe DT (DT4). Similarly, behaviors, symptoms, and cognitions were classified into entities according to their strength value, with a total of 38 behavior entities, 30 symptom entities, and 60 cognition entities. This enables semantic associations among groups, diseases, behaviors, symptoms, and cognitions through the knowledge graph, providing users with a precise and comprehensive semantic expression. To efficiently extract group or attribute characteristics from large-scale entities, we set up a search function in our hub. Users can input keywords related to the node they wish to query, such as groups, diseases, behaviors, cognitions, and symptoms. When searching for a single group or multiple groups, associated disease, behavior, cognition, and symptom entities will be displayed below the search box, organized by category, and ranked to provide a visual description of various attributes of the group. Users can infer the risk of oral diseases through their own similar groups from group-related behaviors, cognitions, symptoms, and other attributes and further grant decision evidence for the prevention of oral diseases. Thus, the visualization tool can easily allow users to identify and intervene in potential oral disease risks and enable medical teams to formulate personalized prevention strategies.\nVisual Interface We provided a rich set of interactions to assist users in conducting an in-depth analysis of multidimensional oral health surveys.

We offer operations for data loading in the control panel, as shown in Figure 2A. Users can select labels from 4 categories on the control panel: disease, behavior, symptom, and cognition labels. We provided different labels for different age groups because of substantial variations in survey data across age groups. We provided a nested pie chart to display the sample size composition of the groups in 6 regions, including urban and rural areas. The inner circles indicate gender, whereas the outer circles indicate age. Users can select a region, choose age and gender within the corresponding pie chart, and click the \u201cAdd\u201d button to include the selected group. After adding the groups, they are displayed in a list below the button, distinguished by random colors. In this way, the chosen label determines the attributes of the scatter matrix, whereas the chosen groups facilitate attribute comparison in the diagonal. All attribute features of the chosen group are also visible in the cloud view and radar view. The graph view shows the semantic relationships of all groups and attributes and offers search capabilities to aid in investigating specific groups and attributes.\nJMIR Med Inform 2023 | vol. 11 | e46275 | p. 6https://medinform.jmir.org/2023/1/e46275 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX"

            "heading": "Case Study",
            "text": "Case 1: Disease Analysis Each disease has its own characteristics, and we introduced a structural view to reveal the characteristics of various diseases. As shown in Figure 3A, we recorded the patient composition of 5 diseases, fill deciduous tooth due to caries (ft), fill tooth due to caries (FT), decayed teeth root due to caries (DRoot), fill teeth root due to caries (FRoot), and attachment loss (AL)12+, in the 4 dimensions of age, city (urban or rural), area, and gender. We found that the width of block A is much larger than that of the 5 blocks on its right. Block A represents the proportion of people with ft in Jianggan. We examined the economic situation of 6 regions with this question in mind. Jianggan exhibits the best overall development among the 6 areas, which explains the higher prevalence of children with filling caries in Jianggan. Blocks B, C, D, and E represent the proportion of urban and female patients with FT and FRoot, respectively. These findings suggest that urban residents possess a better understanding of filling decayed teeth and roots compared with rural residents, and women demonstrate higher awareness than men. Blocks F, G, and H illustrate the proportions of individuals, aged 35 to 44 years, 55 to 64 years, and 65 to 74 years, with DRoot, which shows that the risk of DRoot will increase with age. Similarly, AL12+ is also more likely to occur in the older adult population. Block 1 represents the proportion of men with AL12+, which indicates that men are more likely to experience significant periodontal AL.\n\u201cYou get what you grow, you get what you grow.\u201d Oral diseases do not just appear out of nowhere; they are frequently tightly tied to certain actions and cognition. These diseases bring symptoms that affect our daily lives, and some can even spread and lead to other illnesses. As shown in Figure 3B, we intercepted 4 pairs of examples of correlation from the scatterplot matrix view: disease and behavior, disease and symptom, disease and cognition, and disease and disease. We can see that bleeding gums index (GBI) is negatively correlated with brush the teeth, DRoot is positively correlated with difficulty chewing, DRoot is negatively correlated with fluoride that does not protect teeth, and periodontal pocket depth (PPD) of \u22656 mm was positively correlated with the periodontal pocket length of 4-6 mm.\nWe have summarized some information after a thorough disease analysis. The periodontal health of men is significantly lower than that of women, and individuals lack caries awareness and treatment, and the rate of caries filling treatment is generally low. Middle-aged and older adult groups need to take more\nproactive measures to prevent and treat periodontal disease in rural areas, which is significantly lower than that in urban areas.\nCase 2: Group Analysis We proceeded with our investigation of the group after examining the characteristics of diseases. The radar view and cloud view in Figure 4A show the diseases, behaviors, symptoms, and cognitions of urban and rural groups of people aged 35 to 44 years, 55 to 64 years, and 65 to 74 years. The horizontal comparison reveals age characteristics, the vertical comparison reveals urban and rural characteristics, and the figure reveals gender characteristics. We learned that the overall disease conditions of the 35 to 44 years age group were less severe than those of the older group. With increasing age, AL, missing tooth (MT) due to caries, DRoot, and DT due to caries showed a deteriorating trend. In the cloud view, the number of yellow words representing symptoms of the group from 65 to 74 years was significantly higher than that of the age group from 35 to 34 years (data for the 55-64 years age group are unavailable and thus not included). When comparing urban and\nJMIR Med Inform 2023 | vol. 11 | e46275 | p. 7https://medinform.jmir.org/2023/1/e46275 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nrural regions, it is evident that the occurrence rates of calculus index, GBI, and DT due to caries were higher in rural areas, whereas FRoot and FT exhibited lower rates. Behaviors such as highest education, use fluoride toothpaste, and toothwash within 12 months, indicated in blue, and cognition, indicated in green, were generally stronger in cities than in villages. Analyzing men and women (55-64 years age group) in the city through the radar view and cloud view, it is apparent that men have greater severity of periodontal diseases, such as PPD \u22656mm, calculus index, GBI, and AL. On the other hand, women showed significantly higher occurrences of FRoot and FT than men, suggesting that women in this group were more conscious of filling teeth due to caries.\nThe scatterplot matrix views facilitate intuitive comparison of attributes between different groups, as depicted in Figure 4B. This figure presents behavior comparisons between boys and girls aged 12-15 years in 6 regions: Jianggan, Yuyao, Luqiao, Wenling, Wuyi, and Liandu (from left to right). Each column represents a region, allowing for comparisons across different regions within each subpart. For example, the attributes of father\u2019s highest education and mother\u2019s highest education indicate that boys and girls in Jianggan outperform those in other regions. In addition, Liandu exhibits a longer time since the last dental visit (ST) compared with others. In the attributes smoke, only child, and ST, boys are significantly more numerous than girls, while in DT and FT, girls are more numerous than boys.\nWe summarized some information after a comprehensive group analysis. There are differences in oral health conditions. The higher quality of dental care and periodontal health in rural areas compared with urban areas may be because of the difference in\neconomic prosperity and level of education and knowledge about oral health between the two. There are gender differences in oral health conditions. The mean and rate of caries in women were slightly higher than those in men, whereas the number of caries fillings and periodontal health in women were better than those in men. There are age differences in the oral health conditions. The prevalence of dental loss and periodontal diseases increased as individuals aged, especially among the older adult group with a weak awareness of the treatment of dental loss and caries. This information can aid medical teams in developing targeted and personalized prevention strategies to address these gender and age disparities in oral health.\nCase 3: Semantic Analysis We constructed a macro knowledge graph for groups, diseases, behaviors, symptoms, and cognitions, effectively converting complex and diverse objects into accessible and intuitive information. Figure 5A shows the semantic association between the different degrees of MT due to caries and the population.\nJMIR Med Inform 2023 | vol. 11 | e46275 | p. 8https://medinform.jmir.org/2023/1/e46275 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nMT1, MT2, MT3, and MT4 represent disease severity, with the population classified accordingly. Not only diseases but also behaviors, symptoms, and cognitive attributes can be categorized. Figure 5A displays the information of the group linked to the MT4 entity node, revealing that the severe dental disease group consisted entirely of older adults aged 65 to 74 years.\nAfter exploring the groups corresponding to the attributes, we further explored the attributes of groups. Figure 5B illustrates the corresponding attribute association between men and women aged 35 to 44 years in Luqiao, and the commonalities and differences between groups are intuitively presented. For example, AL in both groups was mild, whereas men were more likely than women to have PDL.\nFigure 5C illustrates the data for those aged 35 to 44 years in 6 regions. It provides a comprehensive overview of the semantic relationships between these groups, highlighting shared\ncharacteristics as well as unique attributes. Notably, we observed a consistent association between the groups facilitated by distinct attributes. Groups from the same region or gender exhibit stronger connections. Specifically, there was a significant overlap in attributes between Jianggan men (point L) and Jianggan women (point K), indicating a close relationship. In addition, a strong association exists between Jianggan women (point K) and Wuyi women (point I).\nWe summarized some information after a thorough semantic analysis. All age groups exhibited low performance in actions,\nJMIR Med Inform 2023 | vol. 11 | e46275 | p. 9https://medinform.jmir.org/2023/1/e46275 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nincluding using fluoride toothpaste, dental floss, and scheduling timely visits to an oral hospital. Thus, these actions should be appreciated and strengthened. Middle-aged individuals and older adults still have poor health knowledge and awareness of health care. It is necessary to disseminate and strengthen certain cognitions, such as the knowledge that fossa closure and fluoride can protect teeth."

We first introduce the purpose and features of this system and then teach students how to use it. Typically, users need only 10 to 15 minutes of training time to understand the meaning of each view and the function of our system. Afterward, they were asked to perform a series of tasks over a defined period, which were closely related to the analysis tasks in Methods section. The specific tasks were as follows:\n\u2022 Disease \u2022 Task 1.1. Which disease is more prevalent in Jianggan\nthan in other areas? \u2022 Task 1.2. Which gender has the highest prevalence of\nAL12+ disease?\n\u2022 Group \u2022 Task 2.1.

What are the common characteristics of the\nwomen aged 55 to 64 years in Luqiao and Wenling?\nTo further demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, users will perform the task twice, once without the system and once with it. When the system was not applicable, we provided the users with a condensed version of the surveys. For each experiment, we set the maximum completion time to 90 seconds. Table 1 and Figure 6 record the percentage of the users able to complete the task correctly in a given time and the average and SD of the time completed.\nTable 1 presents completion time, average completion time, and standard completion time for both cases. Figure 6 displays specific completion time and accuracy rate through a box chart and a bar chart.

Furthermore, we conducted a thorough investigation of the visualization analysis tools to compare them with our system. We found that existing tools and libraries provide a rich set of plotting capabilities. However, the visualization analysis tools used in our study are primarily oriented toward specific tasks to visually present and obtain deep insights into oral health surveys. It is implemented using web-based technologies such as the D3.js visualization framework, which offers greater flexibility and customization options for analyzing oral health report data. Existing tools related to oral health analysis mostly include 3D digital dental model software and oral x-ray image processing software, which provide detailed visualization of dental structures. Nevertheless, these tools fail to capture the broader context of oral health such as group characteristics and disease patterns. Moreover, they often provide simple chart-based visualizations, such as pie charts and bar charts, lacking the personalized visualization design and interactive features essential for the comprehensive examination of intricate data. Therefore, it was concluded that our system allows for more customized visualizations based on specific requirements, facilitating a more detailed analysis of oral health surveys.\nOverall, our system has specific advantages compared with other analysis tools; however, there are also some issues that\nJMIR Med Inform 2023 | vol. 11 | e46275 | p. 11https://medinform.jmir.org/2023/1/e46275 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nare not well solved, which will be addressed in future work. (1) Scalability is the major concern of this system. The current design in the scatterplot matrix view displays up to 8 attributes and 6 groups simultaneously, whereas the struct view shows up to 7 diseases simultaneously. Even if we set the interaction or scrolling function in it, it still imposes a heavy memory burden on users. Therefore, in the future, we intend to tackle the problem of how to show information more effectively in a limited screen space. (2) Despite its ability to analyze various factors, such as groups, diseases, behaviors, and other attributes in existing data, it currently lacks the capability to predict oral health for new groups or individuals. Combining the deep learning model and oral health professional knowledge, learning from existing multidimensional surveys, and predicting the prevalence of unknown groups will be the focus of future work. (3) In this study, the oral health sample was limited to Zhejiang Province, with a small-scale and narrow regional span, resulting in insufficient group differences. Future studies should consider the multidimensional feature of the disease to explore more robust results. We plan to expand our data collection by conducting oral surveys in additional regions, enabling a more comprehensive exploration of oral health from various dimensions."
