 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the factors contributing to poor sleep quality among medical students in Rwanda. The current study did not look at causes, so future research could investigate factors like stress, workload, technology use, mental health issues, etc. 

2. Conduct a longitudinal study tracking sleep quality of a cohort of students over the course of their medical training. This could provide insights into how sleep changes over time and during different stages of training.

3. Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving sleep quality among medical students. Potential interventions could include sleep education, cognitive behavioral therapy, changes to curriculum structure, etc. 

4. Assess the impacts of poor sleep on medical student health, academic performance, and patient care. This could further demonstrate the importance of this issue.

5. Expand the study to other healthcare professions students in Rwanda (nursing, pharmacy, etc.) to see if sleep issues are unique to medical students or more widespread.
