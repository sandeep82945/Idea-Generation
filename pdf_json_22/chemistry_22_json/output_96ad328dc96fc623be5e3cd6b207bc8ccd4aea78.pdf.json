    "abstractText": "We show that a chemical garden can be developed from an alkaline metal precipitate using a flowdriven setup. By injecting sodium phosphate solution into lithium chloride solution from below, a liquid jet appears, on which a precipitate grows forming a structure resembling a hydrothermal vent. The precipitate column continuously builds upward until a maximum height is reached. The vertical growth then significantly slows down while the tube diameter still increases. The analysis of the growth profiles has revealed a linear dependence of volume growth rate on the injection rate, hence yielding a universal growth profile. The expansion in diameter, localized at the tip of the structure, scales with a power law suggesting that the phenomenon is controlled by both diffusion and convection.",

            "text": "Chemical gardens, the inanimate plant-like formations discovered by Johann Glauber in 1646, result upon placing transition metal salt crystals in water glass.1 Researchers over the ages have been fascinated with these chemical structures, and numerous studies have been conducted in order to seek an explanation for their evolution (for a review see Barge et al.2) and to explain their possible connection to the origin of life here on Earth.3\u20135 One of these attempts has been made by mimicking the conditions of a soda-type ocean found on Enceladus (Saturn\u2019s moon) in the laboratory.6 This chemical garden phenomenon has been discovered to occur in nature as hydrothermal vents or chimneys7\u201310 and rusts on metals.11,12 Scientists are now focusing on the formation mechanism,13 growth behavior,14 periodic membrane rupture,15 surface instabilities16 or even pattern formation17,18 and its dynamics in thin solution layer.19,20\nThe fascination with chemical gardens has not stopped within the Earth\u2019s ground gravity. Buoyancy-aided growth coupled with osmosis occurs for the chemical garden grown under the influence of Earth\u2019s gravitational field, leading to the formation of upward growing structures.2 In microgravity, on the other hand, the presence of buoyancy is eliminated resulting in the development of randomly oriented chemical garden structures through the action of forced convection and osmosis instead.21,22\nAs part of its applications, chemical garden tubes have considerable electrochemical potential differences across them\nand could be harnessed for electric current generation.23,24 A sufficient amount of energy can be obtained when an alkaline solution of sodium sulfide, sodium hydroxide and methanol was injected into an acidic solution of iron (II) and (III) chloride and sodium nitrate, and linking several cells in series. The electric current generated from this setup is sufficient to light an LED.25 Chemical garden structures can also serve as a flowthrough reactor.26 By forging a chemical garden structure from a catalytic material, it could offer a surface for the reactants to adsorb and be transformed in the process. This method might not be easy to handle due to the lack of rigidity of the tubes retrieved, but its application could open a vast universe into the study of catalysis.27 In this chemobrionic approach, the growing chemical structures also provide an opportunity for the fabrication of functional materials28 such as gradient composites29,30 or quantum dots,31 to name a few.\nThe preparation of a macroscopic self-assembled chemical structure stems from the appearance of a reasonable chemical gradient, which continuously induces precipitation, its dissolution, osmosis, diffusion and other transport processes. One method to achieve the growth of a chemical garden is the solidin-liquid method consisting of a pellet or solid salt seeds from one of the ions placed in the solution of the other ion.6,32 The other method involves a liquid-in-liquid system, where a solution of one of the ions is injected into the solution of the other ion, leading to the formation of a concentration gradient generated by flow, and the evolution of a chemical structure.16,33\u201335 The advantage of the latter is the possibility of precise characterization of the structural development. Recently, an extension of this technique has utilized an interface of a liquid in contact with a gel containing one of the reactants, which can lead to thin precipitate tubes.36,37 a Department of Physical Chemistry and Materials Science, University of Szeged, Rerrich Be\u0301la te\u0301r 1., Szeged, H-6720, Hungary.

            "text": "We prepared a solution of 6 mol dm 3 LiCl and poured 6 mL into a cuvette of 1 cm 1 cm 10 cm dimension. Using a syringe pump (KD Scientific), 0.6 mol dm 3 Na3PO4 solution was pumped into the LiCl solution through a 0.4 mm internal diameter needle with the injection rate set in the range of 0.01\u2013 0.05 mL min 1. Several tests involved a larger square container with 3 cm width, or the reverse configuration where LiCl solution was pumped into the stagnant Na3PO4 solution. The changes inside the cuvette were monitored with a digital camera (see Fig. 1), saving side-view images every 5 s for a period of 750 s. Each experiment was repeated about 8\u201310 times. The density and the viscosity of the solutions were measured using a digital density meter (Anton Paar DMA500) with 10 4 g cm 3 precision and a rotational viscometer (Anton Paar ViscoQC 300) with 1.0% precision, respectively.\nThe images were then analyzed using a specially designed macro38 of ImageJ and other in-house programs to construct the growth profile in height and volume, and the diameter of the tube at the tip of the precipitate structure. To determine the volume of the tube, we first converted the images into binary form, and then found the centroid, i.e., the center of mass. We divided the image vertically through its center of mass and measured the radius of rotation at the height of the centroid (Rs). Because the structure can be approximated by a symmetric solid of revolution,39 the volume was calculated following Pappus 2nd centroid theorem\nV = 2pRsA (1)\nwith A being the half cross section of the structure divided through its centroid.\nFor the microscopic analyses, the lithium phosphate tubes were carefully collected, washed several times with deionized water and dried at room temperature. A scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4700) was used to visualize both the inner and the outer structure, after sputtering a double layer of gold to achieve an appropriately conductive surface."

            "text": "Upon the injection of LiCl solution into the stagnant solution of Na3PO4 from below, corresponding to the classical chemical garden scenario, a thin vertical jet reaching the liquid surface arises. The momentum of the injected liquid dominates the fluid motion at these flow rates because buoyant forces remain weak due to the small density difference between the two solutions (rLiCl = 1.1283 g cm 3 and rNa3PO4 = 1.1041 g cm 3). The small precipitate particles forming around the perimeter of the jet make it clearly visible; however, they travel with the flow and no contiguous structure is being built. Instead, close to the upper liquid surface, larger flakes of lithium phosphate appear that later sink to the bottom due to their greater density.\nIn the reverse configuration, when the solution of sodium phosphate is injected into the LiCl solution, the previously described processes are significantly less pronounced. Here, following the formation of the jet, the steady growth of a precipitate structure around it is observed, which creates a vertical column (see Fig. 2(a)). The architecture initially continuously builds upward until a maximum height is reached when the vertical only growth almost stops, while the diameter of the tubular structure further increases, especially in the vicinity of the tip.\nThe resultant precipitate tube is sufficiently rigid so that it can easily be removed from the solution, then dried and used for further analysis. The tubes consist of lithium phosphate; the carbonate concentration due to impurities in the basic solution does not reach the level required for the formation of lithium carbonate because of its greater solubility.38 The microstructures of the inner and the outer surfaces of the tube are shown in Fig. 2(b\u2013e). The outer parts of the structure comprise nanospherical crystals with rough surfaces (Fig. 2(b and c)), while the inner surface has filled spheres with hairy crystals (Fig. 2(d and e)). The observed difference in morphology is a result of the presence of concentration gradients that maintain a distinct chemical environment on the opposite sides, common characteristics of tubular precipitate assemblies in chemical gardens.28,40\nThe tube dimensions can be generally characterized by the height and diameter, and from the temporal evolution of these data, the linear and volume growth rate can be determined. The tube height increases linearly as time progresses up to a certain height as illustrated in Fig. 3(a) for several flow rates. The initial steady growth is found to be independent of the injection rate. The linear growth rate, determined from the slope of the\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The vertical growth rate suddenly drops significantly, and hence, the maximum height hmax reached by the initial evolution at tmax is defined by the intersection of the two growth regimes.\nWith our selected injection rates, the height reached during the first stage is independent of the width of the container, i.e., the return bulk flow has a negligible contribution. In addition, the solution height of the originally stagnant fluid has to be sufficiently large so that the tip does not come into the vicinity of the liquid surface.\nThe growth rate in the second stage is also found to be independent of the injection rate with u2 = 2.86 0.33 mm s 1, and therefore a universal growth profile can be constructed for all the measurements where height is scaled to the maximum height reached by the precipitate structure during the first stage. By plotting the dimensionless height, defined as H = h/hmax, as a function of the dimensionless time, t = t/tmax, the data collapse onto a single curve (Fig. 3(b)) with\nH \u00bc t t 1 1\u00fe u2\nu1 \u00f0t 1\u00de t4 1\n( (2)\nfor all the investigated injection rates, where u2/u1 is the ratio of the linear growth rates in the two regimes. Furthermore, there is a linear relationship between the injection rate qv and both\nthe maximum height hmax and the time required to reach that height tmax, as illustrated in Fig. 4.\nFig. 2 Image sequence of the lithium phosphate chemical garden obtained by injecting 0.6 mol dm 3 Na3PO4 solution into 6.0 mol dm 3 LiCl solution (a), SEM image of the outer surface of the tube (b and c), and the inner one (d and e).\nFig. 3 Growth profile of the precipitate structure at different flow rates (a) and dimensionless height, H as a function of dimensionless time, t (b).

Because of the critical lithium concentration and pH beyond which precipitation stops, it leads to saturation in the height of the precipitate structure.40\u201342 The ratio of the slopes from Fig. 4 highlights the inherent linear growth rate of 75 8 mm s 1 matching u1 determined according to Fig. 3(a).\nIn the same vein, from the area of the half structure and Rs, we calculated the volume using eqn (1). The obtained volume increases with time in the manner depicted in Fig. 5(a). The volume growth rate depends on the injection rate but in a single experiment, it remains constant even when the growth characteristics change at t = tmax. Upon comparing it with the injection rate (see Fig. 5(b)), a linear relation is revealed with a slope of 0.55 0.05. This implies that the precipitate tube does not form a closed structure, and the injected solution leaks through the porous membrane into the external solution or through any opening, mostly at the tip of the tube.\nOnce this growing precipitate structure reaches a maximum height, the diameter at the tip (Fig. 6) begins to increase. This expansion follows a simple power law function\nDd = (d d0) = k(t t0)n (3)\nwhere d is the diameter at any time t, d0 is the initial diameter at the time t0 = tmax, k is a proportionality constant, and n is the growth order. By fitting the curves in Fig. 6 to eqn (3), we obtain n = 0.75 0.01, with k = (3.12 0.03) 10 3 cm s n. Since the exponent is greater than 0.5, convection plays a role in the structure formation besides diffusion.\nThe flow characteristics are determined from the Reynolds number defined as\nRe \u00bc 4qv pnid\n(4)\nwhere qv is the injection rate, ni = 0.0322 cm 2 s 1 is the injected solution\u2019s kinematic viscosity, and d = 0.04 cm is the inlet diameter. In our experiments, the flow is laminar with 0.08 o Re o 0.4, which can maintain the steady elongation of the tubular structure in the first growth regime driven by convective transport."

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation of lithium phosphate enables the simplification of recycling procedures of the lithium ions from used batteries. We have described the conversion of lithium ions into chemical gardens for the first time to the best of our knowledge, whose principle of formation could be harnessed for the conversion of used lithium ions. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the possibility of growing hollow-tubed lithium phosphate hydrothermal vent-like precipitate structures. Because of their catalytic applications, like in the isomerization of propylene oxide to allyl alcohol,43 the hollow-tubed structures offer an opportunity for catalyzing reactions in flow-through reactors.\nFig. 5 Temporal evolution of the precipitate volume for various injection rates (a), and volume growth rate rv as a function of injection rate qv (b).\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
