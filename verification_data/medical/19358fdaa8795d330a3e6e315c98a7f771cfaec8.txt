"Our proposed method is illustrated in Figure 1. We used the dataset of a recent Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) challenge on surgical tool detection and localisation. The names of surgical tools are included in the lower part of the videos (shown on the robotic dashboard for guiding surgeons), which can mislead the model learning. To this end, we empirically demonstrate this leaked tool information significantly influences the learning capabilities of our multi-class ConvNext classifier (a famous vision model [5]). We took corrective measures to reduce the field of view (FoV) by dynamically cropping regions leaking the tool names using a U-Net-based data preprocessing strategy."
