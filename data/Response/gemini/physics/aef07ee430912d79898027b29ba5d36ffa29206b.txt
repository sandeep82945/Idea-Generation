1. **Investigate the mechanisms of action of S-epimers of ergot alkaloids and their potential to cause toxic manifestations.**

This could be done through in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the effects of S-epimers on various biological systems, such as the cardiovascular, nervous, and reproductive systems.


2. **Compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of R-epimers and S-epimers of ergot alkaloids in different animal species.**

This would help to determine the potential for S-epimers to accumulate in tissues and cause adverse effects in different species.


3. **Evaluate the potential of S-epimers of ergot alkaloids to interact with other drugs or compounds that are commonly consumed by humans or animals.**

This could be done through in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the effects of S-epimers on the metabolism and elimination of other drugs or compounds.


4. **Develop analytical methods for the simultaneous quantification of R-epimers and S-epimers of ergot alkaloids in food and feed.**

This would allow for the accurate assessment of the total ergot alkaloid content of these products and help to ensure that regulatory limits are not exceeded.


5. **Conduct epidemiological studies to assess the association between exposure to S-epimers of ergot alkaloids and adverse health effects in humans and animals.**

This would help to determine the public health significance of S-epimers and provide evidence to support the need for regulatory action.
