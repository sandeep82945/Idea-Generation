1. **Investigate the impact of climate change on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in different ecosystems.** This could involve studying how temperature, precipitation, and other climate-related factors affect the abundance and distribution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in soil, water, and air.


2. **Examine the role of horizontal gene transfer in the spread of antibiotic resistance among different bacterial species.** This could involve studying the mechanisms by which antibiotic resistance genes are transferred between bacteria, and how these mechanisms are affected by environmental factors such as temperature and antibiotic exposure.


3. **Develop new methods for detecting and monitoring antibiotic resistance in the environment.** This could involve developing new molecular techniques for identifying antibiotic resistance genes, or developing new biosensors that can detect the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in environmental samples.


4. **Evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies for reducing the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment.** This could involve studying the effectiveness of different antibiotic stewardship programs, or studying the effectiveness of different methods for reducing the use of antibiotics in agriculture and animal husbandry.


5. **Investigate the potential health effects of exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment.** This could involve studying the association between exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the development of antibiotic-resistant infections, or studying the association between exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other health problems such as asthma and allergies.
