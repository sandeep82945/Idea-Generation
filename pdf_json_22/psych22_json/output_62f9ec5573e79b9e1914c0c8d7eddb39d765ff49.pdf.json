            "text": "At the beginning of 2020, with the outbreak of COVID19, the daily life of people around the world changed a lot. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, governments took several administrative measures, such as social distancing, home quarantine, and travel restrictions, to reduce the spread of COVID-19. College students were almost limited to their homes. Sharma et al. (2020) found that individuals during epidemic isolation will have negative and repressed emotions, which have reduced people\u2019s life satisfaction. In recent years, with the epidemic situation being better and the gradual relaxation of epidemic prevention policies in China, college students have also begun to return to school, but excessive psychological pressure, anxiety, and other problems remain in some of them.\nDue to long-term home isolation, loneliness has been an important factor in describing the mental health background of college students and a reflection of a closed heart. Perlman et al. (1984) defines loneliness as an individual\u2019s feelings about the quality and quantity of social relations and it is generated when an individual\u2019s actual social relationship can\u2019t meet their expectations. Qualter et al. (2010) believes that loneliness is a negative emotional experience, which comes from dissatisfaction with the individual\u2019s social network, and it is an important factor affecting mental health and will also have an impact on the development of psychological function. Based on the concept of loneliness at home and abroad, Mellor et al. (2008) puts forward that loneliness is a negative subjective emotional experience when an individual\u2019s interpersonal relationship does not meet his satisfaction. This experience usually occurs when there is a gap between his actual communication level and his expected communication level, accompanied by feelings such as loneliness and helplessness. In general, temporary or accidental loneliness will not cause psychological behavioral disorders, but long-term or severe loneliness can cause certain emotional disorders and reduce people\u2019s mental health. Loneliness will also increase the isolation and alienation from others and society, and the isolation and alienation will then strengthen people\u2019s sense of loneliness,\nwhich will inevitably lead to personality disorders of isolated individuals over time.\nIn addition to the objective growth environment (family and society), the factors affecting loneliness mainly include the habit of self-evaluation, communicative ability, and specific emotions. Among these psychological problems, the focus of this paper is whether loneliness has an impact on psychological resilience. Psychological resilience, also known as mental resilience, refers to \"an individual\u2019s behavioral tendency to change itself to adapt to changing environments and the ability to recover from stressful situations\" (Block and Block, 1980), and resilience is a psychological trait possessed by individuals and a process of interaction between individuals and the environment (Bolton et al., 2017). Psychological resilience is a manifestation of self-healing power. An important therapeutic hypothesis in psychotherapy is that the client has self-healing power and can self-heal the trauma he has suffered (Bohart, 2000). College students are a special group. They are in the transition stage from adolescence to adulthood. Their psychological function is still in an unstable stage, and their self-regulation and antipressure abilities are poor. In the face of pressure and stress, it is very easy for them to have a variety of psychological problems. This paper assumes that loneliness is related to psychological resilience because some literature has demonstrated a similar association. Dong and Zhang (2013) found in their research on left-behind children in Yunnan minority areas that the better their psychological resilience is, the weaker their loneliness is, and the weaker their psychological resilience, the stronger their loneliness is. Among them, emotional control has a great influence on psychological resilience. In addition, positive cognition and family support also have a significant impact on the psychological resilience of migrant children (Ye et al., 2016). Research by Tang et al. (2021) on the structural model of adolescent psychological resilience found that if a teenager has a high level of psychological resilience, then the level of loneliness he feels in his study and life is very low, the level of loneliness experienced by those teenagers with medium psychological resilience is also at the medium level, while the level of loneliness with the lowest level of psychological resilience is the highest. Wang F. et al. (2019) studied children\u2019s interpersonal\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nrelationships and found that children with better psychological resilience also have higher cognitive scores on communicating with others, while children with poor psychological resilience have lower cognitive scores on communicating with others, and the good or bad of interpersonal relationships have significant predictive values for individual loneliness. According to Kaloeti et al. (2019), college students with high scores of psychological resilience can better adapt to school life, so that it is easier for them to establish good interpersonal relationships and they\u2019re less likely to feel lonely.\nIn addition, the role of self-efficacy is worth discussing. Because loneliness is largely endogenous, it is difficult to change through external forces. Therefore, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that the negative relationship between loneliness and psychological resilience will be regulated by personal selfefficacy. The concept of self-efficacy was first proposed by the American psychologist Bandura et al. (1999), who explained it as an individual\u2019s belief and assessment of their ability when achieving certain expected goals. In the past studies, it has been confirmed that the influencing factors of self-efficacy include concepts, attitudes, consciousness, methods, and parents\u2019 educational methods, etc. In addition, the interpersonal relationship among social factors also has an important impact on self-efficacy. Bing et al. (2022) confirmed that emotional regulation self-efficacy has a significant predictive effect on academic achievements. Buri\u00e6 and Macuka (2018) shows that there is a significant correlation between teachers\u2019 emotions, self-efficacy, and work commitment. Bandura et al. (1999) and his followers believe that self-efficacy is an individual\u2019s belief in and assessment of his or her ability when achieving certain expected goals. After conducting a questionnaire survey on enterprise employees, Joie-La Marle et al. (2021) found that the general sense of self-efficacy has a significant positive predictive effect on adaptive performance. To sum up, this paper believes that if the role of self-efficacy can be successfully detected, it will enable schools to provide targeted help to students with a strong sense of loneliness in the post-epidemic era, which has important reference value.\nIn recent years, some scholars have carried out research on the psychological resilience of college student \u201centrepreneurs.\u201d Ke (2009) believes psychological capital is mainly composed of transactional psychological capital and relational psychological capital, each of which includes four parts. Bockorny and Youssef-Morgan (2019) believe courage in psychological capital is as important as hope and optimism and determines life satisfaction and entrepreneurial ability. Based on a meta-analysis of psychological capital, it is proposed that self-confidence, willingness to achieve, and entrepreneurial orientation have positive impacts on entrepreneurship (Frese and Gielnik, 2014). However, researches on psychological resilience among entrepreneurial college students are still lacking. Since the participants are entrepreneurial college students, therefore, this paper investigated their loneliness and\npsychological resilience with a questionnaire survey. This study will understand entrepreneurial college students\u2019 psychological condition in response to stress and analyze the relationship among loneliness, self-efficacy, and psychological resilience, which can provide a reference for promoting the mental health development of college students. This study attempts to fill the gap of research on the psychological status of post- epidemic college students and is conducive to providing a reference for the analysis of the epidemic based on the research of college students in this paper. And from the perspective of psychology, this study has taken measures to improve the psychological resilience of post-epidemic college students and formulated corresponding intervention strategies."

Questionnaires were distributed to each group of participants via email. The reason why participants in the entrepreneurial competition were selected as the research objects of this study is that entrepreneurs have special psychological qualities and the internal personality differences of different entrepreneurs lead to different entrepreneurial results. Entrepreneurs\u2019 resources, personality characteristics, and psychological quality determine the differences in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs\u2019 business ideals, dedication, and perseverance are of great importance (Kets de Vries, 1985). Students with an entrepreneurial spirit tend to have greater variation in self-efficacy, which is more helpful for us to explore differences at the statistical level. Questionnaires were distributed to 205 students by stratified random sampling, and 200 valid questionnaires were retrieved, with an effective response rate of 97.78%. Among the objects: 72 are men (36.00%) and 128 are women (64.00%); 67 families live in rural areas (33.50%) and 53 (26.50%) in urban areas. In China, there is a conventional classification of the level of colleges and universities. And we classified the colleges and universities according to the general cognition of the society and obtained participants from different levels of colleges and universities.

The \u03b1 coefficient of the scale is 0.87, which can measure loneliness caused by the gap between the expectation of social interaction and the experience. Considering that this paper aims at the discussion related to Post-Pandemic Pedagogy, the original scale was reduced by this article and finally, five items were retained. For all these items, the respondents were asked to show how much they agreed with the statements on a 5-point scale, from one (no, I entirely disagree) to five (yes, I entirely agree). Thus, a higher score in structure reflects a higher level of measured characteristics. Specific items are as follows:\nLoneliness 1: I always feel that no friends will help me. Loneliness 2: I always feel neglected. Loneliness 3: I always feel alienated from others. Loneliness 4: I always feel sad because I seldom associate with people. Loneliness 5: Although there are people around me, I always feel that no one cares about me."

Self-efficacy is the core concept in Bandura\u2019s social cognitive theory (Beauchamp et al., 2019; Chen and Wu, 2021), which is different from outcome expectation. The outcome expectation refers to an individual\u2019s perception of the consequences of his or her actions, while self-efficacy refers to the control or dominating of his or her actions. A person who believes that he or she can handle all kinds of things will be more active and proactive in life. This perception of \"can do\" reflects a sense of control over the environment, so the sense of self-efficacy reflects a belief that an individual can take appropriate actions to face environmental challenges. Self-efficacy looks at an individual\u2019s ability to deal with all kinds of stress in life from a confident perspective. The Chinese version of the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES) was translated and revised by Wang Caikang. In the revised Chinese version of the scale, the internal consistency coefficient and retest reliability are, respectively, 0.87 and 0.83, with good predictive validity (Wang N. et al., 2019). As a pilot study, this scale has been simplified in this paper, and to better meet the\nrequirements of modeling, a five-point system has been used for Loneliness measurements.\nSelf-efficacy 1: If I try my best, I can always solve the problem. Self-efficacy 2: It\u2019s easy for me to stick to my ideals and achieve goals. Self-efficacy 3: I am confident that I can successfully deal with any emergencies. Self-efficacy 4: With my intelligence, I can cope with unexpected situations. Self-efficacy 5: I can face difficulties calmly because I believe in my ability. Self-efficacy 6: No matter what happens to me, I can deal with it freely."

It changes with the change of the environment and achieves dynamic regulation and adaptation to the environment. As early as in the 1990s, Chinese workers received foreign scholars to measure the level of psychological resilience through the psychological resilience scale. Since then, this concept has always been a frequently discussed topic, which has also made the psychological resilience scale widely used. Among them, the scale on the psychological resilience of college students is the revised version of Yu and Zhang (2007) of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which has good reliability and validity. The scale consists of three scales of resilience, strength, and optimism, with a total of 25 items, using the 5-point scale evaluation method. However, to make a preliminary exploration in this paper, we have simplified the scale into the following items and adopted a five-point system:\nPsycho Resi 1: Sometimes I encounter problems that can\u2019t be easily solved, and the god of luck will bless me. Psycho Resi 2: When facing problems, I try to treat them with a positive attitude. Psycho Resi 3: I will believe that the tempering I have experienced will make me stronger.

At the same time, the model allows measurement errors between independent variables and dependent variables. By establishing, estimating, and testing causal relations, the SEM model has become a common and important statistical method. Since the traditional regression does not consider the relationship between submerged variables and the structural equation model analysis considers the common variation among all latent variables, this paper decides to use the structural equation model to further verify the assumptions we put forward."

Kline (2015) believes that if the absolute value of the sample\u2019s observed variable is greater than 3 and the absolute peak value is greater than 10, the data may deviate from the normal score. The descriptive statistical results of the questions can be found in the Appendix, and the results show that the absolute skewness value of all questions in this study is less than 3 and the absolute kurtosis value is less than 10. The sample data obey the normal distribution and is suitable for subsequent analysis.\nThe reliability test, also known as reliability analysis, measures the credibility of the questionnaire (Zhang et al., 2022). It mainly determines whether the questionnaire data is stable and reliable, and generally analyzes the credibility of the questionnaire based on the Cronbach Alpha (\u03b1) value. The Cronbach Alpha (\u03b1) value is at 0\u20131, and the closer its value is to 1, the higher the reliability of the questionnaire data is. If the \u03b1 of the measurement dimension is higher than 0.8, the internal consistency of the measurement dimension is considered to be high; the values of loneliness, SelfEfficacy, and PsychoResi\u2019s Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (\u03b1) are 0.898 and 0.881 and 0.833, respectively. This shows that the stability of the results is high, and the reliable quality of the scale is very good.\nTo test the quality of the questions in the questionnaire, it is necessary to carry out an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) of dimension questions. Exploratory factor analysis requires that the data of KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy) is greater than 0.6, the Bartlett Spherical Test is significant, and the factor load should be as large as possible after\nfactor analysis. There is a large crossroad, and the cumulative variance interpretation rate should be greater than 40% (Hoyt and Kerns, 1999). The results show that the KMO value of the scaling topic is 0.853 and the Bartlett Spherical Test is significant (p < 0.001). The data are suitable for exploratory factor analysis.\nThe eigenvalue analysis shows that there are six components with eigenvalues greater than 1, which cumulatively explains 69.283% of the variance. Six components are extracted and rotated by using the maximum variance method. The results show that the lowest factor load is greater than 0.5 and there is no large cross loading. Except for PsychoResi1 and PsychoResi7, the structure between the factors is clear and consistent with expectations. It has good structural validity."

Observations of convergence validity include factor load, combined reliability (CR), and average extraction variance (AVE).\nIn the verification factor analysis, the factor load of the question should be higher than 0.6, and the fit of the model should meet the corresponding standard. If CR > 0.7 and AVE > 0.5, based on the Composite Reliability (CR) and the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) of standardized factor load calculation dimensions, the measurement dimension will have a good Convergent Validity (Hair, 2011).\nTo determine that each variable in the study represents its different configurations, this study uses AMOS software to analyze the validity of all variables in the model and calculates the fitting parameters of the model. In this study, the model fitting degree can be verified by \u03c72/df, GFI, RMSEA, CFI, IFI, TLI, PGFI, and PNFI. \u03c72/df generally ranges between 1 and 3, and the smaller this value is, the better the fitness of the model is, in addition, the larger the TLI and CFI are, the better and the maximum should not be greater than 1, and the RMSEA should be less than 0.08 and the smaller it becomes, the better. As can be seen from Table 1, except for GFI (acceptability), multiple fitting indicators in the model have reached the ideal situation, and the fitting effect is the best. Therefore, all variables in this study have good distinguishing validity and can represent their respective dimensions.

This has brought a lot of uncertainty to the future study and life of college students, to some extent making them confused and doubtful about whether they can effectively control the impact of the epidemic on their life planning. Self-efficacy is a belief that refers to an individual\u2019s ability to control events that affect one\u2019s life (Benight and Bandura, 2004). This study found that\nalthough COVID-19 has an impact on students\u2019 health, college students have improved the level of problem-solving and selfefficacy in the process of constantly obtaining new knowledge, which enables them to face the health threat caused by the epidemic in a more positive and rational attitude. Therefore, this also shows that the improvement of self-efficacy plays a great role in psychological resilience, which is consistent with the research results of Ye et al. (2016), that is, the higher the\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nlevel of self-efficacy of college students, the stronger the ability to control the impact of events when they encounter trauma, and the more they grow after the trauma. Relevant studies have also reported that young people are more likely to change their original thinking, cognition, world outlook, etc. in crisis events to adapt to changes in real life, which helps them achieve posttraumatic growth (Liu et al., 2017). College students are in the later stage of youth, a special period of life development. From the perspective of developmental psychology, this period is a critical period for the formation and establishment of selfidentity. Erikson and Erikson (1981) believe that self-identity is a multi-level and multi-dimensional psychological concept closely related to the development of self and personality, which essentially refers to the continuity, maturity, and integration of personality development. It has an important impact on the individual\u2019s social adaptation and mental health. The better the development of College Students\u2019 self-identity, the better the social adaptation. As the survey object of this study is only for entrepreneurial college students, there are certain limitations, so the research conclusions need to be further demonstrated and analyzed.

The results show that self-efficacy is the mediator between loneliness and psychological resilience in targeted Chinese students. Here are some suggestions for future pedagogy:\n(1) In school education, targeted educational methods should be adopted according to the emotional characteristics of college students in different grades. For first-year students, public courses in psychology can be offered to them to learn how to maintain mental health. For senior students, because they\u2019re facing the critical moment to enter society, schoolteachers should offer relevant courses on career planning catering to their needs, so that they can positively deal with the situation. (2) A variety of activities should be held to engage students to provide them with more opportunities for exercise and learning.
