    "abstractText": "Cell-free massive MIMO is emerging as a promising technology for future wireless communication systems, which is expected to offer uniform coverage and high spectral efficiency compared to classical cellular systems. We study in this paper how cell-free massive MIMO can support federated edge learning. Taking advantage of the additive nature of the wireless multiple access channel, over-the-air computation is exploited, where the clients send their local updates simultaneously over the same communication resource. Such an approach, known as over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL), is proven to alleviate the communication overhead of federated learning over wireless networks. Considering channel correlation and only imperfect channel state information available at the central server, we propose a practical implementation of OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO. The convergence of the proposed implementation is studied analytically and experimentally, confirming the benefits of cell-free massive MIMO for OTA-FL.",

            "text": "Cell-free massive MIMO is emerging as a promising technology for future wireless communication systems, which is expected to offer uniform coverage and high spectral efficiency compared to classical cellular systems. We study in this paper how cell-free massive MIMO can support federated edge learning. Taking advantage of the additive nature of the wireless multiple access channel, over-the-air computation is exploited, where the clients send their local updates simultaneously over the same communication resource. Such an approach, known as over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL), is proven to alleviate the communication overhead of federated learning over wireless networks. Considering channel correlation and only imperfect channel state information available at the central server, we propose a practical implementation of OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO. The convergence of the proposed implementation is studied analytically and experimentally, confirming the benefits of cell-free massive MIMO for OTA-FL.\nIndex Terms\nFederated learning, over-the-air computation, cell-free massive MIMO, imperfect CSI.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWith the exponential growth in data collection from distributed devices and remarkable advancements in AI applications, there is a growing interest in distributed learning, which leverages the computing capabilities of these devices. Distributed learning offers two primary benefits. Firstly, it eliminates the need to transfer massive volumes of high-dimensional data from the collecting devices to central servers (CSs) for further processing. Secondly, it inherently ensures privacy since local data is not shared. This work specifically focuses on federated learning (FL), a popular technique in distributed learning, where a CS coordinates global model training by communicating with multiple distributed clients [1]\u2013[3]. Instead of sharing local data, the parameters of the machine learning (ML) model are transferred. The FL process involves multiple ar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n06 48\n2v 3\n[ ee\nss .S\nP] 1\n8 Se\np 20\n23\n2 training rounds, during which the global model is shared with the clients. The clients then perform several local iterations using their respective local data and send their model updates back to the CS. These model updates are subsequently aggregated to obtain the new global model.\nIn this work, we focus specifically on over-the-air FL (OTA-FL), which has been recently proposed to alleviate the communication overhead of the FL process [4], [5]. By exploiting the additive nature of the multiple access channel, OTA-FL allows the clients to send their local updates simultaneously and the CS can obtain the sum directly from the received signal. Such an approach has been extensively studied in literature and has been proven to enhance the communication efficiency of FL over wireless networks. The main advantage of OTA-FL is that the communication resources needed to reach convergence do not scale with the number of clients. In contrast, the communication resources of digital transmission based FL scale with the number of clients [6].\nIn this paper, we consider implementing OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO. The latter is a promising technique for future wireless communication systems, which is expected to bring several benefits such as ultra-high reliability, high energy efficiency, ultra-low latency, and ubiquitous and uniform coverage [7]\u2013[9]. The main idea of cell-free massive MIMO is deploying a large number of distributed APs, connected to a central processing unit (CPU), that serve all users in a wide coverage area [9]. Specifically, we consider in this work the scalable cell-free architecture recently proposed in [10]. It is a user-centric architecture where a cluster composed of a finite number of APs is formed around each user terminal (UT). The latter will only communicate with the APs in its cluster. This is the main difference compared to the early architectures proposed for cell-free massive MIMO, where each UT is served by all the APs in the network [11], [12]. The scalable architecture [10] allows the number of UTs and APs to be very large while keeping all the signal processing algorithms and the fronthaul signaling practically implementable. The main objective of our work is to explore the benefits that cell-free massive MIMO can bring for OTA-FL.\nSignificant efforts have been recently dedicated for the design and performance analysis of FL over wireless networks [4]\u2013[6], [13]\u2013[31], referred to as federated edge earning (FEEL). Some of the studies focused on exploring over-the-air computation to reduce the communication overhead of the FL process [4]\u2013[6], [15], [20]\u2013[23], [25]. While most of the efforts considered first-order optimization methods, namely stochastic gradient descent (SGD), some works have studied the convergence of second-order methods such as the alternating direction method of multipliers\n3 (ADMM) [6], [32]. Moreover, different scheduling techniques have been proposed for FEEL [26]\u2013[30], where a subset of clients is selected at each communication round considering the limited communication resources. Resource allocation has been also an active research direction in FEEL [18], [33]\u2013[37], with the aim of accelerating convergence and reducing the effect of the wireless channel. Furthermore, assuming multiple antennas at the CS and designing beamforming and receiving techniques have been considered in [4], [15], [19]. In [15] a blind FEEL scheme was proposed assuming the CS is equipped with a large number of antennas and imperfect channel state information (CSI) available at the CS. The settings considered in [15] are such that the CS is connected to a base station (BS) equipped with a large number of antennas, communicating with a finite number of clients participating in the FL process. Our work differs from [15] in two aspects. Particularly, we consider in our work cell-free massive MIMO instead of cellular MIMO and the more practical scenario where the number of APs (and thus the number of antennas) and the number of clients are both large. To the best of our knowledge, our work in this paper is the first effort to study the performance of OTA-FL in the context of cell-free massive MIMO.\nOTA-FL has been studied extensively in both point-to-point and MIMO settings. However, these studies cannot be directly applied to cell-free massive MIMO scenarios. In Section III, we thoroughly demonstrate the vanishing interference terms and establish the necessary conditions specific to cell-free massive MIMO systems. These conditions differ significantly from those studied in the context of cellular massive MIMO, as outlined in [15]. Particularly, while the conditions for cellular massive MIMO focus on a large number of antennas and a finite number of clients, our findings highlight the importance of both a large number of clients and a large number of antennas for cell-free massive MIMO. Moreover, proving the interference vanishing necessitates some practical assumptions specific to this setting. These assumptions, detailed in (7), are essential to justify the feasibility of OTA-FL in cell-free MIMO systems. Our proposed analysis also addresses a critical challenge often overlooked in existing literature, which is the scalability issue. Previous studies on OTA-FL in cellular MIMO predominantly focus on singlecell scenarios with a limited number of clients, neglecting inter-cell interference. In contrast, our analysis considers the entire cell-free network with a substantial number of clients, presenting a more scalable approach. By investigating OTA-FL within this comprehensive network framework, we contribute to the understanding of its applicability and performance in largescale deployments. Finally, a strong motivation for this work is to study the advantages of\n4 implementing OTA-FL in terms of energy efficiency compared with cellular MIMO. This is an important research question and our work is a first attempt to answer it. Our experiments show clearly the advantage of cell-free massive MIMO systems in terms of energy efficiency, which is an essential factor in FL taking into account the limited power at the clients\u2019 devices.\nThe contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We study, for the first time, the performance of OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO and\ninvestigate the benefits that the latter can bring for OTA-FL in terms of energy efficiency.\n\u2022 We propose a practical implementation of OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO under\nreasonable assumptions and a practical channel model. Specifically, we propose a receiver based on maximum ratio combining (MRC) that is shown to mitigate the effect of the fading channel as well as the interference. \u2022 We provide the convergence rate of the proposed implementation and test its performance via\nextensive experiments. Numerical results show that OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO requires lower power constraints at the clients to reach convergence compared to cellular massive MIMO.\nThroughout the paper, boldface lowercase is used for denoting column vectors, x, and upper case for matrices, X.

One of the main challenges of FL is the communication overhead. In fact, the local updates are sent at every global training round to the CS usually over limited bandwidth wireless channels. To reduce the communication overhead, over-the-air communication has been proposed as a promising solution, where the model updates are sent simultaneously over the multiple access channel [4], [20]. This approach, referred to as OTA-FL, will be introduced hereafter.\nOTA-FL consists of multiple global training rounds where the CS sends the model parameter vector, \u03b8t, to the clients at each round t. Due to the high power available at the CS, the downlink communication is usually assumed to be perfect and the clients receive the global model without distortion [20]. Then, client n sets its local model as \u03b8n0 (t) = \u03b8(t) and runs its local SGD for \u03c4 iterations based on its local dataset\n\u03b8ni+1(t) = \u03b8 n i (t)\u2212 \u03b7tF \u2032n,\u03betn,i(\u03b8 n i (t)), for i = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c4 \u2212 1, (3)\nwhere \u03b7t is the SGD step size at round t and F \u2032n,\u03betn,i(\u03b8 n i (t)) denotes the stochastic gradient computed using a local mini-batch sample \u03betn,i chosen uniformly at random from the local dataset of client n.

The CS recovers the new global model from the received signals. Further details will be given in Section III."

Each AP can serve multiple UTs and a UT can communicate with several APs, which is different from classical cellular massive MIMO where each UT is served by a single BS. Cell-free massive MIMO is shown to provide better spectral efficiency than classical cellular massive MIMO [10].\nWe adopt in this work the scalable cell-free massive MIMO network proposed in [10]. Such a network can support a large number of UTs while the signal processing algorithms and the fronthaul signaling remain practically implementable. The network is composed of N single antenna UTs and L APs, each equipped with M antennas. Each subset of APs is connected to a CPU via high-capacity backhaul links. A user-centric network architecture is assumed where each UT is served by a subset of the APs providing the best channel conditions as illustrated in Fig. 1. We denote by S\u2113 the subset of UTs served by AP \u2113.\nSince the model updates of a client will be received by multiple APs, we think that implementing OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO will be more robust to poor channel conditions and CSI errors.

A more reasonable assumption is that \u03b1t is determined based on the power budgets of the clients. Such information can be exchanged between the clients and the CS before or during the learning process and the CS can choose \u03b1t accordingly. However, we adopt the constraint in (5) to have an idea about the amount of power needed to reach convergence and compare different implementation schemes of OTA-FL in terms of energy efficiency.\n1In practice, several CPUs are deployed in the network connected to a master CPU. In this case, the latter will be the CS\ncoordinating the FL process.\n8 The received signal at AP \u2113 during OFDM symbol transmission k is given by\nyk,s\u2113 (t) = \u03b1t N\u2211 n=1 hk,sn,\u2113(t)x k,s n (t) + z k,s \u2113 (t), s \u2208 [S], \u2113 \u2208 [L], k \u2208 [K], (6)\nwhere hk,sn,\u2113(t) \u2208 CM is the channel vector between UT n and AP \u2113 for transmission k over subcarrier s, and zk,s\u2113 (t) \u223c CN (0, \u03c32zIM) stands for the additive noise.\nA Rayleigh fading channel model is assumed, where the channel vector between UT n and\nAP \u2113, at global iteration t, subcarrier s, and transmission k is distributed as [10]\nhk,sn,\u2113(t) \u223c CN (0,Rn,\u2113),\nwhere Rn,\u2113 \u2208 CM\u00d7M is a correlation matrix describing the large-scale fading, including geometric pathloss, shadowing, antenna gains, and spatial channel correlation [40]. We assume that Rn,\u2113 is available at the APs, which can be obtained by one of the existing correlation estimation methods [41]\u2013[43].\nSince the UTs far away from AP \u2113 will experience a severe large-scale fading and a few UTs are close to a particular AP in practice, we will make the following assumption on the correlation matrix Rn,\u2113\n1\nM trRn,\u2113 = O(1) for n \u2208 S\u2113 \u222a S\u0303\u2113,\n1\nM trRn,\u2113 = o(1) for n /\u2208 S\u2113 \u222a S\u0303\u2113, (7)\nwhere S\u2113 is the set of UTs served by AP \u2113 while S\u0303\u2113 is a set of UTs close to AP \u2113 and not served by this AP. In a practical scenario, one can assume that the cardinalities of S\u2113 and S\u0303\u2113 are finite while the total number of UTs is large, N \u2192 \u221e. These assumptions are needed for theoretical analysis purposes, in this section, to justify that the interference will vanish as will be detailed later. When implementing our approach in practice, such assumptions are not used. We note also that (7) implies\n1\nM trRn,\u2113Rn\u2032,\u2113 = o(1) for n \u2208 S\u2113 \u222a S\u0303\u2113 and n\u2032 /\u2208 S\u2113 \u222a S\u0303\u2113,\n1\nM trRn,\u2113Rn\u2032,\u2113 = O(1) for n \u2208 S\u2113 \u222a S\u0303\u2113 and n\u2032 \u2208 S\u2113 \u222a S\u0303\u2113. (8)\nThe channel vector from all APs to UT n can be written as hk,sn (t)= [ hk,sn,1(t) T , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,hk,sn,L(t)T ]T , which has the following correlation matrix Rn = diag(Rn,1, . . . ,Rn,L) \u2208 RLM\u00d7LM . AP \u2113 has\n9 access to an estimate of the channels of its corresponding UTs, that is, h\u0302k,sn,\u2113(t) is available at AP \u2113 for n \u2208 S\u2113. The channel estimates are such that\nh\u0302k,sn,\u2113(t) = h k,s n,\u2113(t) + h\u0303 k,s n,\u2113(t) (9)\nwhere h\u0303k,sn,\u2113(t) \u223c CN (0,Cn,\u2113) is the channel estimation error with correlation Cn,\u2113 and independent of hk,sn,\u2113(t). The channel estimation can be done in a distributed manner where each AP estimates the channels of its corresponding UTs or in a centralized manner where the received pilot signals are conveyed to the CPU, which will be in charge of channel estimation. In our experiments, we have used the MMSE channel estimation technique as in [10].\nEach AP sends the received signal yk,s\u2113 (t) and the channel estimates, h\u0302 k,s n,\u2113(t), of its corresponding UTs to the CPU. The vector of all the received signals from all APs, yk,s(t) = [yk,s1 (t) T , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,yk,sL (t)T ]T , is combined at the CPU using the following receive vector\nvk,s(t) = 1\nN N\u2211 n=1 Dnh\u0302 k,s n (t) tr(DnRn) ,\nwhere Dn = diag(Dn,1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Dn,L) and\nDn,\u2113 = IM if n \u2208 S\u21130M otherwise. For notation convenience, we define cn \u225c tr(DnRn) = \u2211 \u2113\u2208Kn tr(Rn,\u2113), where Kn denotes the set of indexes of APs serving UT n. Combining the received signal vector yk,s(t) using vk,s(t), the CS obtains,\nyk,s(t) = vk,s(t)Hyk,s(t)\n= \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 N\u2211 n\u2032=1 h\u0302k,sn (t) HDnh k,s n\u2032 (t) cn xk,sn\u2032 (t) + 1 N N\u2211 n=1 h\u0302k,sn (t) HDnz k,s(t) cn = \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 hk,sn (t) HDnh k,s n (t)\ncn xk,sn (t)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nsignal term\n+ \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 N\u2211 n\u2032=1 n\u2032 \u0338=n hk,sn (t) HDnh k,s n\u2032 (t) cn xk,sn\u2032 (t)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 interf 1\n+ \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 N\u2211 n\u2032=1 h\u0303k,sn (t) HDnh k,s n\u2032 (t)\ncn xk,sn\u2032 (t)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ninterf 2\n+ 1\nN N\u2211 n=1\n( hk,sn (t) + h\u0303 k,s n (t) )H Dnz k,s(t)\ncn\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 noise term\n. (10)\nThe combined signal is composed of a signal term, two interference terms, and a noise term. In what follows, we will show that the signal term converges to the average of the model updates\n10\nand the two interference terms vanish as the number of clients grows large, N \u2192 \u221e. The signal term in (10) can be rewritten as\nyk,ssig(t) = \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 1 cn xk,sn (t) \u2211 \u2113\u2208Kn hk,sn,l (t) Hhk,sn,l (t).\nUsing the law of large numbers, when N \u2192 \u221e, the signal term approaches\ny\u0304k,ssig(t) = \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 1 cn xn \u2211 \u2113\u2208Kn Ehk,sn,l (t) Hhk,sn,l (t) = \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 xk,sn (t).\nLet us now analyze the interference terms. The expectation and the variance of hHn Dnhn\u2032 are given by\nEhk,sn (t)HDnh k,s n\u2032 (t) = 0, (11)\nvarhk,sn (t) HDnh k,s n\u2032 (t) = tr(RnDnRn\u2032Dn) = L\u2211 \u2113\u2208Kn tr(Rn,\u2113Rn\u2032,\u2113). (12)\nThus, the expectation of the first interference term is zero and its variance with respect to the randomness of the channel is given by\nvar(interf 1) = var \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 N\u2211 n\u2032=1 n\u2032 \u0338=n hk,sn (t) HDnh k,s n\u2032 (t) cn xk,sn\u2032 (t) (13)\n= \u03b12t N2 N\u2211 n=1 N\u2211 n\u2032=1 n\u2032 \u0338=n \u2211 \u2113\u2208Kn tr(Rn,\u2113Rn\u2032,\u2113) c2n |xk,sn\u2032 (t)| 2 (14) = \u03b12t N2 N\u2211 n=1 \u2211 \u2113\u2208Kn N\u2211 n\u2032 \u0338=n\nn\u2032\u2208S\u2113\u222aS\u0303\u2113\ntr(Rn,\u2113Rn\u2032,\u2113)\nc2n |xk,sn\u2032 (t)| 2 + \u03b12t N2 N\u2211 n=1 \u2211 \u2113\u2208Kn N\u2211 n\u2032 \u0338=n\nn\u2032 /\u2208S\u2113\u222aS\u0303\u2113\ntr(Rn,\u2113Rn\u2032,\u2113)\nc2n |xk,sn\u2032 (t)| 2\n(15)\nUsing the assumptions in (7) and (8), the first term of (15) is the sum of N |Kn||S\u2113 \u222a S\u0303\u2113| terms of order O(1) normalized by N2, and since |Kn||S\u2113\u222a S\u0303\u2113| is finite compared to N , this first term is o(1) when N \u2192 \u221e. For the second term, it is a sum of N |Kn|(N \u2212 |S\u2113 \u222a S\u0303\u2113|) terms of order o(1) normalized by N2, it is thus o(1). Based on the above analysis, the variance of the first interference term satisfies\nvar(interf 1) = o(1), as N \u2192 \u221e. (16)\n11\nSimilarly, the expectation of the second interference term is zero and its variance with respect to the randomness of the channel can be obtained as\nvar(interf 2) = var \u03b1t N N\u2211 n=1 N\u2211 n\u2032=1 h\u0303k,sn (t) HDnh k,s n\u2032 (t) cn xk,sn\u2032 (t) (17)\n= \u03b12t N2 N\u2211 n=1 N\u2211 n\u2032=1 tr(Rn\u2032DnCnDn) c2n |xk,sn\u2032 (t)| 2. (18)\nUsing similar arguments as in the analysis of the first interference term, one can easily show\nvar(interf 2) = o(1), as N \u2192 \u221e. (19)\nThe above analysis justifies the estimation of the global model update entries as \u2206\u03b8\u0302(2k\u22121)+2(s\u22121)K(t) = Re { yk,s(t) } \u03b1t\n(20) \u2206\u03b8\u03022k+2(s\u22121)K(t) = Im { yk,s(t) } \u03b1t . (21)\nRemark 1. We have shown in this section that the interference terms vanish and determined the required conditions for that. These conditions turn out to be completely different than the case of cellular massive MIMO studied in [15]. Specifically, both the number of clients and the total number of antennas should be large while the conditions in the case of a cellular massive MIMO are such that the number of antennas is large while the number of clients is finite."

Reducing A(t) may lead to faster convergence but it may result in increasing the value of B(t) and thus higher residual distance. For instance, increasing \u03c4 will result in a lower value of A(t) and a higher value of B(t), thus higher values of \u03c4 provide faster convergence but increased residual error.

Specifically, these parameters vanish when perfect CSI is available at the APs since Cn = 0 in this case. Moreover, the parameters \u03b3 and \u03ba are directly related to the quality of the wireless channels between the clients and their corresponding APs.

The above result can be leveraged to reduce the\n14\nlearning error of the FL process, also known as the optimality gap, by optimizing the AP-UT association scheme. Reducing the values of \u03b3+ \u03b3\u0303 and \u03ba+ \u03ba\u0303 will result in a lower learning error.\nRemark 2. Various techniques, including user scheduling [44], partial device participation [45], and gradient sparsification or compression [46], among others, can be employed in the context of cell-free massive MIMO for optimizing the FL process. The convergence analysis can be adapted depending on the specific technique but this is out of the scope of this work."

The performance is measured in terms of the test accuracy computed using the test dataset.\nWe consider both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data distribution scenarios. For the i.i.d. data distribution, the training set is randomly splitted into N disjoint datasets, and each of them is assigned to one client. As for the non-i.i.d. data distribution, the samples from the same class are splitted\n15\ninto N/10 disjoint groups (assuming N \u2265 10 is divisible by 10) and each group is assigned to a client. Thus, each client has samples from one class only.\nIn all experiments, we assume that the number of OFDM subcarriers is S = d/2, and thus K = 1 transmission time slot is needed at every global training round. We note that this assumption has no effect on the learning performance since changing the values of S and K will only change the value of the average power constraint P . We adopt the cell-free massive MIMO architecture proposed in [10], including the algorithms proposed for pilot assignment, UT-AP association, and channel estimation. The values of the channel parameters are summarized in Table II.\nIn all experiments, the convergence is reported for T = 300 global iterations. For the MNIST dataset, the learning rate is fixed to \u03b7t = 0.01 and the batch size to |\u03betn,i| = 50 while the learning rate is set to \u03b7t = 0.005 and the batch size to |\u03betn,i| = 500 for the CIFAR10 dataset. For the sake of comparison, we plot the performance of the FL process when perfect communication links between the clients and the CS are available. In such a scenario, the CS receives \u2206\u03b8(t) = 1 N \u2211N n=1 \u2206\u03b8n(t) without distortions. This will serve as a benchmark to assess the proposed OTAFL scheme.

            "text": "In the third experiment, we compare the performance of OTA-FL on cell-free massive MIMO and cellular massive MIMO. We consider N = 25 clients uniformly distributed in a 500\u00d7500m square coverage area. For cell-free massive MIMO, we consider L = 25 APs, each equipped with M = 4 antennas, and randomly distributed in the coverage area. As for the cellular massive MIMO, the clients communicate with a single BS placed in the center of the square coverage area and equipped with M\u0303 = 100 antennas. We note that for both systems, the number of antennas is the same to ensure a fair comparison. We plot in Fig. 4 the performance of both systems based on i.i.d. MNIST dataset for the same value of the power scaling parameter \u03b1t. From the figure, the performance of cell-free massive MIMO-based OTA-FL is better for a lower value of the power constraint. For example, with P = 4.47 dBm, cell-free massive MIMO-based OTA-FL provides better performance than cellular OTA-FL with P = 13.6 dBm. This highlights the benefits of cell-free massive MIMO in terms of energy efficiency. We note also from Fig. 4.b, that for the same value of the power scaling factor, cellular massive MIMO fails to reach convergence while cell-free massive MIMO guarantees an acceptable performance.\nSince the number of global training rounds does not necessarily reflect the time needed till convergence, we added a simulation where we compare the performance of OTA-FL over cellular\n18\nand cell-free architectures as a function of the training time. In particular, we report in Fig. 5 the test accuracy versus the training time using the same setting as in Fig. 4. Similar convergence behavior as in Fig. 4 is observed and this is due to the fact that a global round takes approximately the same time over both cellular and cell-free massive MIMO as we have remarked in our experiments.\nAs we mentioned in the previous section, various techniques can be employed to enhance\n19\nthe performance of the FL process in both cell-free and cellular massive MIMO such as client scheduling and partial device participation. In order to provide illustrative examples, we have conducted additional simulations incorporating different user scheduling techniques. In Fig. 6, we present a performance comparison of two distinct scheduling approaches with partial client participation, considering both cellular and cell-free scenarios.\nIn the case of partial client participation, only a subset of clients is selected to upload their local updates during each global round. For our simulations, we assume a total of N = 25 clients, out of which r = 10 clients are chosen to send their local updates at each global round. We investigate two widely adopted scheduling schemes: random selection (RS) and update significance (US). In the RS scheme, r clients are chosen randomly from the available pool. On the other hand, the US scheme selects the clients with the highest norm of the model updates.\nWe conclude from the figure that the performance of the two scheduling techniques is almost the same for i.i.d. data distribution for both cell-free and cellular architectures. On the other hand, US scheduling outperforms RS scheduling in the case of non-i.i.d. data over cellular massive MIMO. We remark also that the cell-free architecture provides better performance than cellular MIMO under different scheduling techniques for the same power scaling factor \u03b1t."

            "text": "It is important to note that the AP-UT association scheme influences the performance of cellfree MIMO in general and the FL process in particular. Our theoretical convergence analysis\n20\nremains valid for any AP-UT association scheme, as long as the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO architecture is considered. The influence of the AP-UT association scheme is reflected in the constants \u03b3, \u03b3\u0303, \u03ba, and \u03ba\u0303 through the association matrices Dn. For the sake of illustration, we conducted additional simulations to explore the effect of different AP-UT association techniques on the FL process. Specifically, we compare the performance of our proposed implementation using two distinct AP-UT association schemes in Fig. 7. The first scheme, used in all our previous experiments and proposed in [10], assigns APs and pilots jointly to UTs based on large-scale fading coefficients and pilot contamination levels. The second scheme, developed in [47], is an interference-aware massive access scheme that achieves joint AP-UT association and pilot assignment by leveraging large-scale interference characteristics.\nFrom the figure, it is clear that the AP-UT-2 scheme ( [47]) outperforms the AP-UT-1 scheme ( [10]) for smaller values of the power scaling factor \u03b1t. However, for relatively high values of \u03b1t, the performance of both schemes becomes indistinguishable."

Specifically, we have proposed a practical implementation that is shown to be convergent. The performance of the proposed implementation is studied analytically and experimentally, showing the advantages that cell-free massive MIMO can bring for OTA-FL. We have also compared the proposed scheme with cellular massive MIMO-based OTA-FL, where we have shown that the proposed implementation requires significantly lower energy to reach convergence. Future related research directions include studying different receiving techniques, such as the MMSE receiver, and investigating the convergence of second-order FL techniques, such as ADMM FL, in this context. Fine-tuning the proposed OTA-FL over cell-free massive MIMO in terms of client scheduling and uplink power optimization is also an interesting future direction."
