"The experimental values of CO2 absorption were utilized in KH determination which in turn have revealed that the CO2 absorption in APILs is attributed by physisorption interaction. This deduction was supported by 13C NMR and FTIR analyses in view of the absence of new peaks related to the formation of carbamate species. The recyclability study conducted at one cycle shows an insignificant reduction in CO2 solubility in [TBA][C7] thus suggesting the promising performance of APILs as liquid absorbents. Nevertheless, in this preliminary study of APIL recyclability, high energy vacuum system was used."
