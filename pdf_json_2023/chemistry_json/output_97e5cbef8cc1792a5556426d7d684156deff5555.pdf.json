    "abstractText": "The globalization of the food market has created a pressing need for food producers to meet the ever-increasing demands of consumers while ensuring adherence to stringent food safety and quality standards [1]. The comprehensive analysis of food quality encompasses numerous aspects, such as chemical characterization, physical properties, sensory evaluation, authentication, traceability, processing, storage, and microbiological safety [2]. Traditional analytical techniques have long been employed in food analysis, but they often involve destructive procedures that are labor-intensive, time-consuming, costly, and environmentally burdensome [3]. In response to these challenges, the field of food analysis has witnessed remarkable advancements through the utilization of advanced spectroscopic techniques. These cutting-edge methods, including X-ray-based approaches, hyperspectral and multispectral imaging, NMR, Raman, IR, mass, UV, visible, and fluorescence spectroscopy, offer non-destructive, rapid, solvent-efficient, eco-friendly, and cost-effective alternatives to conventional methods [4]. Leveraging these techniques in tandem with statistical analysis, particularly through chemometric approaches, allows for the extraction and exploration of vital information hidden within spectral fingerprints or image data. Furthermore, this extracted information can be utilized to construct calibration models for qualitative and quantitative analysis of various food samples. The integration of advanced spectroscopy and chemometrics holds immense potential in the field of food science and technology, bolstering consumer confidence and contributing to overall food quality assurance [3]. It is with great pleasure that we present this Special Issue, which focuses on recent developments and applications of advanced spectroscopic techniques in food analysis, quality evaluation, safety assessment, and practical industrial implementations, with a specific emphasis on chemometric approaches. The collection of papers included in this Issue offers a valuable insight into the diverse range of research and applications in this field, shedding light on the potential of these techniques to revolutionize food analysis.

The quality evaluation of fair-trade cocoa beans from different origins using portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is also examined, illustrating the potential of NIRS as a non-destructive tool for rapid quality assessment in the cocoa industry [9]. Additionally, the effect of moisture content on the analysis of quality attributes of red pepper powder is explored using a hyperspectral system, providing valuable insights into the impact of moisture on food analysis outcomes [10]. Moreover, time-resolved laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy is employed for the accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis of brown rice flour adulteration, offering a promising approach to combat food fraud and adulteration [11].

The chemical authentication and speciation of Salvia botanicals are explored using GC/Q-ToF and chemometrics, providing crucial insights into the identification and characterization of herbal products [13]. Lastly, the detection of pesticide residue levels in grapes is studied using hyperspectral imaging and machine learning, illustrating the potential of these techniques for ensuring food safety [14]. In conclusion, this Special Issue brings together a collection of research papers that highlight the immense potential of advanced spectroscopic techniques in the field of food analysis and quality evaluation. By presenting a range of innovative applications, these studies demonstrate the power of these techniques to enhance food safety, authenticity, and overall quality. We hope that the papers in this Special Issue provide valuable insights, inspire further research, and encourage the adoption of advanced spectroscopic techniques in the food industry.\nAuthor Contributions: M.K. and S.U. contributed equally to this Editorial.
