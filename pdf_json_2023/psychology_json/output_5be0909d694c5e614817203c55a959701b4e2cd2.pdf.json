    "abstractText": "In the current research, the binary solution containing ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-1methylmorpholinium dimethyl phosphate ([C1C2MOR][DMP]), 1-ethyl-1-methylpiperidinium dimethyl phosphate ([C1C2PIP][DMP]), or N,N,N-triethyl-N-methylammonium dimethyl phosphate ([N1,2,2,2][DMP]) with ethanol are investigated as new working fluids for absorption refrigeration technology. The IL was mixed with ethanol, which was considered as a refrigerant. Experimental (vapor + liquid) phase equilibria (VLE) of these binary systems were measured by an ebulliometric method within a temperature range from T = (328.15 to 348.15) K with an increment of 10 K and pressures up to 90 kPa. Experimental VLE data were correlated using non-random two-liquid (NRTL) within the maximum average relative deviation of 0.45%, which confirms the effectiveness of using such a model for calculations. Each of the proposed binary systems exhibit a negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s law, which is a very important characteristic for working pairs used in absorption heat pumps or absorption refrigerators. From a technological point of view, measurements of physicochemical properties play an important role. In this research, liquid density and dynamic viscosity were determined at temperatures from T = (293.15 to 338.15) K at ambient pressure over the whole concentration range. These properties were correlated using empirical equations. From experimental density data, the excess molar volumes were determined and correlated using the Redlich\u2013Kister type equation. Ionic liquid: [C1C2MOR][DMP] and [C1C2PIP][DMP] were synthesized and characterized using NMR analysis. The thermophysical characterization of pure ILs, including glass transition temperature (Tg) and heat capacity at the glass transition temperature (\u2206gCp), was determined using the differential scanning calorimetry technique (DSC) at atmospheric pressure. In this work, the combination of basic studies on the effect of the cation structure of an ionic liquid on the properties of their solutions with ethanol and the possibility of future application of the tested systems in a viable refrigeration system are presented.",

            "text": "With the need to conserve energy resources and protect the environment, the interest in absorption refrigeration equipment as an alternative to compressor units has grown significantly in recent years. Absorption chillers are devices that make extensive use of thermal energy to produce cooling. These devices, using the so-called thermal compressor (absorber, pump, desorber system) for the process of compressing refrigerant vapors, are an ideal economic solution for unearned surplus technological or waste heat. They also work well where there is a shortage of electricity. Unlike compressor chillers, the generation of cooling in absorption devices does not require the supply of expensive electricity because the energy supply of the absorption device is heat in the form of hot water or steam (so-called waste heat).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1940. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28041940 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1940 2 of 30\nAn additional advantage of absorption devices is the use of an environmentally friendly refrigerant that does not destroy the ozone layer (water). This type of equipment is most often used in industry, especially in the energy-heating sector, because large amounts of waste and inexpensive thermal energy are available in this sector. The characteristic feature that distinguishes absorption equipment from classical compressor equipment is the existence of the following two internal circuits: the thermal compressor circuit, where the working medium is a solution of absorbent (liquid absorbing substance) and absorbate (gaseous absorbed substance, which is also a refrigerant), and the actual refrigeration circuit, where the working medium is the absorbent itself. One of the most important factors determining the effectiveness of absorption chillers is the properties of the working fluids. In absorption refrigeration, a volatile substance acts as the refrigerant (absorbent), while the absorbent is a less volatile compound that has a strong affinity for the refrigerant. Working fluids should meet the following requirements: (1) the difference in boiling point between the pure refrigerant and the mixture at the same pressure condition should be as large as possible; (2) refrigerant should exhibit high heat of vaporization and high concentration within the absorbent to maintain a low circulation rate between the generator and the absorber per unit cooling capacity; (3) transport properties that influence heat and mass transfer, such as density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion coefficient, should be favorable; (4) both refrigerant and absorbent should be non-corrosive, environmentally friendly, and low cost [1]. At present, the most used in refrigeration technology are the following two types of absorption chillers: bromolite (LiBr + H2O) and ammonia (H2O + NH3) [2]. In bromolite chillers, the working medium is water, so their use is limited to producing a refrigerant of about 5 \u25e6C. They find their use in air-conditioning systems mainly because of their lower investment than ammonia systems. Ammonia chillers, on the other hand, are mainly used in industrial systems, where temperatures of the produced refrigerant below 0 \u25e6C are required. When using ammonia chillers deep freezing to temperatures as low as \u221260 \u25e6C is possible. The choice of the cooling system is determined by the final economic effect. The use of compressor cooling systems is cheaper than absorption systems. However, the use of absorption chillers can have more favorable operating effects. It is estimated that their primary energy-saving potential is between 30% and 60%. Unfortunately, these results are not often achieved by systems already in operation. Although compressor chillers have a higher cooling capacity (coefficient of performance, COP = 2\u20135, while for absorption chillers COP = 0.6\u20131.2), they consume more electricity, which gives an advantage to absorption units. An additional advantage of absorption chillers is the longer service life of absorption units compared to refrigeration units due to the presence of a small number of moving parts in the unit, which also makes servicing much easier. However, the many advantages of absorption refrigeration do not mean that it is a technology without drawbacks. The corrosive properties, explosiveness, crystallization, and toxicity [3\u20135] of the systems used to date (absorbent + coolant) make it necessary to search for alternative solutions. The search for new, more favorable working pairs has gained importance and is of interest to many research laboratories. In the world literature, several systems are proposed for use in the subject under consideration [6\u201311]. Ionic liquids are a very interesting class of compounds that exhibit unique properties, i.e., extremely low volatility, high heat capacity, non-flammability, high thermal and chemical stability, and total or partial solubility in water and organic solvents [12]. The undoubted advantage of ionic liquid chemistry is the ability to control and refine their properties through the appropriate selection of the cation and anion structure. This allows the design of new target-oriented media. Their low volatility argues for their use as alternative solvents in many chemical industries, including but not limited to chemical synthesis, in the field of extraction and separation, as electrolytes in batteries, lubricants, bactericidal and fungicidal compounds, drug carriers, wood preservatives, or in industrial-scale separation techniques [13\u201316].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1940 3 of 30\nMany ILs systems as the working fluids in absorption refrigeration are given in the literature [17\u201334]. In this work, we propose three ethanolic solutions of the dimethyl phosphatebased iLs with the following cation: 1-ethyl-1-methylmorpholinium, [C1C2MOR]+, 1-ethyl1-methylpiperidinium, [C1C2PIP]+, and N,N,N-trimethyl-N-ethylammonium, [N1,2,2,2]+ for future use in this area. The use of ethanol instead of water as a refrigerant will further expand the possibility of using such systems in the temperature range below 273 K. To determine the potential application of iLs and their systems as a working fluid in absorption refrigeration technology it is necessary to outline and describe their basic thermodynamic and physicochemical properties. The characteristics of the systems should include, in particular, measurements of (vapor + liquid) phase equilibria, enthalpy of mixing, heat capacity, and transport properties. Up to now, there are only a few publications concerning the properties of pure dimethyl phosphate-based IL or their binary solution with ethanol. The published work on the VLE data concerns the ethanolic solution of the 1,3-dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C1IM][DMP] [35\u201337], 1-ethyl-3methylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C2IM][DMP] [38,39], triethylmethylammonium dimethyl phosphate [N1,2,2,2][DMP] [40], 1-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C2PYR][DMP] [31] and 1-hydroxy-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C2OHPYR][DMP] [31]. Very few publications deal with measurements of enthalpy of mixing in ionic liquid systems with ethanol; data are available for the following ionic liquids: 1,3-dimethylimizadolium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C1IM][DMP] [35], 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C2IM][DMP] [38], and 1-ethyl-1methylpiperidinium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C2PIP][DMP] [41] 1-ethyl-1methylpyrrolidinium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C2PYR][DMP] [41], N,N,N-triethyl-Nmethylammonium dimethyl phosphate, [N1,2,2,2][DMP] [41], and 1-hydroxyethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium dimethyl phosphate, [C1C2OHPYR][DMP] [41]. More literature data concern the measurements of density and viscosity of pure iLs with DMP anion [42\u201354] but only in a few of them, there are data on the density or viscosity of an ethanolic solution of iLs [35,38,50,54]. To the best of our knowledge, among the ionic liquids analyzed in this work, there is no literature data for comparison. Therefore, the data presented here and its comparison for other dimethyl phosphate-based IL with the available literature data can be a valuable complement to the state of the art in the area undertaken."

The experimental data are collected in Table 1 and graphically presented in Figure 1. The list of available thermophysical data of the family of dimethyl phosphate-based iLs is presented in Table 1. The data shows that glass transition temperature was determined for all ion liquids, and the value of Tg increases in the following series: [C1C2PYR][DMP] (Tg = 189.7 K; \u2206gCp = 119.6 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121) < [N1,2,2,2][DMP] (Tg = 194.4 K; \u2206gCp = 154.4 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121) < [C1C2OHPYR][DMP] (Tg = 194.9 K; \u2206gCp = 148.1 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121) < [C1C2PIP][DMP] (Tg = 211.0 K; \u2206gCp = 103.9 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121) < [C1C2MOR][DMP] (Tg = 222.2 K; \u2206gCp = 132.7 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121). The melting temperature was determined for two of the presented iLs. Among dimethyl phosphate-based iLs, the lowest melting point equal to Tm = 285.2 K (\u2206mH = 0.73 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121) was determined for [C1C2PYR][DMP]. Ionic liquids: [C1C2PIP][DMP] and [N1,2,2,2][DMP] exhibit a similar melting point of about 295 K, whereas, in the case of ammonium-based IL, melting enthalpy is almost seven times higher than for [C1C2PIP][DMP]. Additionally, a (solid-solid) phase transition temperature of 275.5 K was determined only for [C1C2PYR][DMP]. According to our best knowledge, the thermophysical properties of pure IL with dimethyl phosphate anion tested in this research have not been reported in the literature; thus, in Table 1, there are no comparisons between the experimental and literature data.

Solid lines-NRTL equation with parameters given in Table 5; dashed lines-ideal solution.\nA broader comparison of the effect of the ILs cation structure for the family of the dimethyl phosphate IL, taking into account the ffect of th co structure and the presence of a hydroxyl group in the substituent n the vapor pressure of the {IL + ethanol} system i also shown in Figure 3. It wa shown that for the presented family of the DMP-based IL, the vapor pressure increases in the following series: [N1,2,2,2 [DMP]~[C1C1IM][DMP]~ [C1C2IM][ P] < [C1C2PYR][DMP]~[C1C2PIP][DMP] < [C1C2MOR][DMP] < [C1C2OHPYR][DMP]. The ighest egative deviation from Raoult\u2019s law, thus, t e strongest (IL-ethanol) interaction was determined in the case of IL with ammonium cation. A similar effect was observed for 1,3-dimethylimidazolium- and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cations. It was noted that the extension of the alkyl chain by one CH2 group in the imidazolium cation of IL has no significant effect on the vapor pressure in the studied system. This observation also holds true when increasing the core size of the cation from pyrrolidinium to piperidinium. Moreover, the vapor pressure in the system with [C1C2OHPYR][DMP] is significantly higher compared to the aliphatic analog, [C1C2PYR][DMP]. It is speculated that the presence of a hydroxyl group in an ILs cation creates a greater possibility for a molecule to form hydrogen bonds between the molecules of the ionic liquid, thereby weakening the (IL-ethanol) interaction. Similarly, in the case of an ionic liquid with a morpholinium cation, the presence of an oxygen atom in the structure of the IL cation\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1940 10 of 30\nprobably promotes the occurrence of stronger interactions (IL-IL) compared to (IL-ethanol) intermolecular interactions. In our latest paper [31], it was shown that {[N1,2,2,2][DMP] (1) + ethanol (2)} exhibit the highest vapor pressure among dimethyl phosphate-based IL. It was stated at the time that the ammonium cation substituted with alkyl groups is more aliphatic compared to the imidazolium cation, which prevents the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds with ethanol molecules. The small number of literature points under the considered temperature conditions (T = 348.15 K) prompted the authors of this work to conduct a more extensive study of VLE in this system. The experimental data compared with available literature data, is shown in Figure 3. The obtained results differ slightly from the literature data presented by Shen et. al. [40]. The reason for the reduction in vapor pressure in the {[N1,2,2,2][DMP] + ethanol} system presented in this work is the water content of the pure ionic liquid. In the present work, the ionic liquid was synthesized in the laboratory, and the claimed water content is 8000 ppm, while Shen. et al. [40] declare the water content to be 664 ppm. From the literature studies [40] on VLE measurements in {water (1) + ethanol (2) + IL (3)} ternary systems, it is clear that an increase in water content results in a decrease in vapor pressure in the system. Since the goal of the ongoing research is to search for working fluids alternative to the aqueous solution of lithium bromide, in addition to the vapor pressure data of {IL + ethanol} systems, Figure 3 also shows VLE data for {LiBr + water} system [55]. Although the tested iLs show a high ability to absorb ethanol, the vapor pressure under the same temperature conditions is higher than that of the commercially used system in refrigeration. It is worth considering the possibility of future use of ionic liquids as absorbents in cooling devices since they are designed compounds and exhibit several unique properties, and the commercially used systems are not without drawbacks. Apart from a few literature data for the ethanolic solution of ammonium-based IL, we have not found the literature data on (vapor + liquid) phase equilibria measurements for the systems analyzed in this work.\nThe NRTL equation for the excess Gibbs energy for the binary system is the following:\nGE RT = x1x2\n[ \u03c421G21\nx1 + G21x2 + \u03c412G12 G12x1 + x2\n] (3)\nwhere: G12 = exp(\u2212\u03b112\u03c412) G21 = exp(\u2212\u03b121\u03c421) (4)\n\u03c412 = g12 \u2212 g22\nRT \u03c421 = g21 \u2212 g11 RT\n(5)\nwhere g12 \u2212 g22 = \u2206g12 and g21 \u2212 g11 = \u2206g21 are the binary interactions parameters.

The maximum \u03c3 value between the experimental and calculated density data was determined to be 0.03% for each binary system under study, which indicates excellent compatibility between these data. Experimental liquid density data versus composition for {[C1C2MOR][DMP] (1) + ethanol (2)} is presented in Figure 4b as an example. The solid lines presented in Figure 4b correspond to the results of calculations using Equations (12) and (13). The results for the other two systems are shown graphically in Figures S3 and S4 in Supplementary Materials. Experimental density and viscosity data show that both pure iLs and their ethanolic solutions exhibit higher liquid density than ethanol, and, as expected, density and viscosity decrease with increasing temperature. This behavior is related to thermal expansion; the fluid density decreases and the intermolecular interactions become weaker due to the increase in the mutual distances between the molecules, and, therefore, the viscosity also decreases. Additionally, the addition of ethanol leads to a decrease in both mixture density and viscosity at each temperature. Density and viscosity are fundamental physical properties of the solvent and tested medium and are extremely important in the design and optimization of any application, including absorption refrigeration technology, since they may be correlated with the medium fluidity and mass transfer. For this reason, both experimental studies and a discussion of values based on available literature data are warranted. We found no literature data for binary solution composed of ethanol and dimethyl phosphate-based iLs as well as the density of pure ionic liquids under study. Based on experimental and literature data for other dimethyl phosphate-based iLs, it was possible to discuss the effect of the cation structure on the liquid density of the ethanolic solution. The comparison of the experimental liquid density data for {[cation][DMP] (1) + ethanol (2)} system with the literature for other dimethyl phosphate-based ILs solutions at temperature T = 298.15 K is

desirable characteristics of the studied systems from the point of view of future use as working fluids in absorption refrigeration technol-\ngy be ause this liquid de sity value is lower th n t se for lithium bromide aqueous solution, commercially used as a w rking fluid in this area. It was shown that the liquid density of {IL (1) + ethanol (2)} decreases in the following series: [C1C1IM][DMP] > [C1C2MOR [DMP] > C1C2OHPYR] [ > [C1C2IM] [DMP] > [C1C2PYR][DMP] > [C1C2PIP][DMP]~[C1C4IM][DMP] > [N1,2,2,2][DMP]. The incre se in the length of the alkyl c ain in the imidazolium ring causes a decrease in density. The same trend is observed when th cyclic chain is increased from a five-member pyrrolidinium ring to a six-member piperidine ring. The presence of a hydroxyl group in the pyrrolidinium cation results in a significant increase in density. In addition, the presence of an oxygen atom in the morpholinium cation of the ionic liquid increases the density of the binary system with ethanol compared to the system with piperidinium-based IL. From Figure 5, the ethanolic system with the ammonium-based ionic liquid shows the lowest density. These data, supplemented by the promising vapor pressure values presented earlier, allow us to conclude that the {[N1,2,2,2][DMP] + ethanol} system is the most promising for application in the area being undertaken.

A comparison of VE values at 298.15 K for the three ethanol solutions presented in this work is shown graphically in Figure 6d. It shows that below the IL mole fraction x1 = 0.5, the VE values increase in the following series: [C1C2MOR][DMP] < [C1C2PIP][DMP] < [N1,2,2,2][DMP] while for compositions above x1 = 0.5 the increase in VE is observed in the following order: [C1C2PIP] [DMP] < [N1,2,2,2][DMP] < [C1C2MOR][DMP].

The comparison of dynamic viscosity data for an ethanolic solution under study at a temperature of 298.15 K is presented in Figure 8. It can be observed that the viscosity values for the tested systems decrease in the following series: [C1C2MOR][DMP] > [C1C2PIP] [DMP] > [N1,2,2,2][DMP], therefore, the most favorable results from the point of view of technological application in as working fluids were obtained for the ethanol mixture of ammonium-based ionic liquid. Additionally, among the ethanolic solution of dimethyl phosphate-based iLs, dynamic viscosity decreases in the following series: [C1C2MOR][DMP] > [C1C2PIP][DMP] > [C1C2OHPYR][DMP] > [C1C4IM][DMP] > [N1,2,2,2][DMP] > [C1C1IM][DMP] > [C1C2IM][DMP] > [C1C2PYR] [DMP]. Within investigated temperature range, the dynamic viscosities for pure iLs vary from \u03b7 = 17,870 mPa\u00b7s at T = 293.15 K to 289.6 at T = 338.15 K for [C1C2MOR] [DMP], from 3276 mPa\u00b7s at T = 293.15 K to 136.7 mPa\u00b7s at T = 338.15 K for [C1C2PIP][DMP] and from 679.6 mPa\u00b7s at T = 293.15 K to 41.46 mPa\u00b7s at T = 338.15 K in the case of [N1,2,2,2][DMP]. The comparison of the dynamic viscosity value for pure dimethyl phosphate-based IL at a\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1940 22 of 30\ntemperature of 298.15 K is graphically presented in Figure 9.

            "text": "Thermodynamic and physicochemical properties of three pure ionic liquids and their ethanolic solution versus temperature and composition were presented in this study. Binary systems composed of IL and ethanol were analyzed for possible future use as working fluids in absorption refrigeration technology. In the studied systems, the ionic liquid would act as an absorbent and ethanol as a circulating agent. This is to search for alternative systems to the commercially used lithium bromide aqueous solution. An additional benefit would be the ability to operate the device at temperatures below 273.2 K due to the use of ethanol instead of water as the circulating medium. In the design of the new working fluid, it is desirable that the mixture exhibits negative deviations from Raoult\u2019s law (resulting in easier refrigerant absorption) and has as low density and viscosity values as possible, which allows easier mass and heat transfer. In this work, three binary solutions composed of [C1C2MOR][DMP], or [C1C2PIP][DMP], or [N1,2,2,2][DMP] and ethanol were considered as an alternative working pair for the absorption refrigeration. Using the DSC technique, the thermophysical properties of pure iLs were determined. The experimental value was compared to those for other dimethyl phosphate-based iLs. For each IL under study, glass temperature and the heat capacity at the glass transition temperature were determined. It was shown that [C1C2PIP][DMP] and [N1,2,2,2][DMP] exhibit similar melting temperatures, whereas the melting enthalpy for IL with ammonium cation is almost 7-times higher than for [C1C2PIP][DMP]. Thermodynamic and physicochemical properties, including vapor pressure, liquid density, and dynamic viscosity of binary systems composed of IL and ethanol, were experimentally determined as a function of temperature and composition. The experimental data was successfully correlated using the appropriate equations. Each system exhibits negative deviations from the ideal solution. The highest negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s equation was determined for the ethanolic solution of [N1,2,2,2][DMP]. The comparison of VLE data investigated here with those for other dimethyl phosphate-based iLs shows that the vapor pressure increases in the following series: [N1,2,2,2][DMP]~[C1C1IM][DMP]~[C1C2IM] [DMP] < [C1C2PYR][DMP]~[C1C2PIP][DMP] < [C1C2MOR][DMP] < [C1C2OHPYR][DMP]. Despite the characteristics desirable for applications in the area being undertaken, the vapor pressures of the proposed systems are higher compared to the commercially used aqueous lithium bromide solution. The correlation of the experimental data with the NRTL equation resulted in good agreement between experimental and calculated values.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1940 24 of 30\nBoth liquid density and dynamic viscosity decrease as temperature and ethanol content in the systems increase. Experimental density and dynamic viscosity data for the ethanolic solution presented here were compared to those for other dimethyl phosphate-based iLs. It was shown that the density values decrease in the following series: [C1C1IM][DMP] > [C1C2MOR][DMP] > [C1C2OHPYR][DMP] > [C1C2IM][DMP] > [C1C2PYR][DMP] > [C1C2PIP][DMP]~[C1C4IM][DMP] > [N1,2,2,2][DMP], while viscosity decreases as follows: [C1C2MOR][DMP] > [C1C2PIP][DMP] > [C1C2OHPYR][DMP] > [C1C4IM] [DMP] > [N1,2,2,2][DMP] > [C1C1IM][DMP] > [C1C2IM][DMP] > [C1C2PYR][DMP]. Based on liquid density data, the excess molar volumes were calculated and correlated using the Redlich\u2013 Kister equation with the temperature dependence of parameters. Since the main objective of the work is to search for working fluids for future use as an alternative to {LiBr + water} refrigeration systems, the experimental data presented were compared with those for an aqueous solution of lithium bromide, conventionally used in industrial-scale refrigeration technologies. The comparison shows that liquid density data for each binary system is lower than those for {LiBr + water} (see Figure 5). Dynamic viscosity for aqueous lithium bromide solution was determined within a narrow range of composition showing a steep course, and at higher concentrations of lithium bromide, the values would be diametrically higher than for the systems proposed in this work (see Figure 8). Resuming, the ethanol solutions of ionic liquid analyzed in this work, especially [N1,2,2,2][DMP], exhibit a high potential for use as a working fluid in absorption cooling technology."

The sample of [C1C2PIP][DMP] with an initial mass fraction purity 0.970 was purchased from IoLiTec. The synthesis procedure of N,N,N-triethyl-N-methylammonium dimethyl phosphate was presented in our latest work [41]. Here, 1-ethyl-1-methylmorpholinium dimethyl phosphate was synthesized.

            "text": "4.2.1. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)\nThermophysical properties of pure iLs, including temperature (Tm) and enthalpy of melting (\u2206mH), glass transition temperature (Tg), and heat capacity at the glass transition temperature (\u2206gCp), as well as temperature (Ttr) and enthalpy (\u2206trH) of (solid + solid) phase transition, were determined by DSC 1 STARe System (Mettler Toledo) calorimeter, which used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. The calibration of the apparatus was carried out by measuring the samples of 99.9999 mol% purity indium and high-masspurity n-heptane (Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), \u226599.5%), n-octane (Sigma-Aldrich, \u226599%), n-decane (Sigma-Aldrich, \u226599%), ethylbenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, \u226599%), cyclohexane (POCH, \u226599.5%), n-dodecane (Acros Organics, \u226599%), n-octadecane (Aldrich, \u226599%),\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1940 26 of 30\nnaphthalene (Acros Organics, \u226599%), and water (Millipore, \u03ba < 0.05 mS\u00b7cm\u22121). Calibration measurements were made at the heating/cooling rate of 5 K\u00b7min\u22121 in a temperature range from T = (180 to 430) K. The uncertainties are as follows: u(T) = 0.3 K, u(\u2206H) = 3.3 J\u00b7g\u22121. Measurements of all examined IL samples were performed in heating mode at the heating rate of 5 K\u00b7min\u22121. A sample of the tested ionic liquid weighing about 10 mg was placed in an aluminum pan and an empty hermetic aluminum pan was used as a reference. The apparatus includes a liquid nitrogen cooling system, and the measurements were made in an inert atmosphere with a nitrogen flux of about 200 mL/min. The experiments were carried out within the temperature range from (173.15 to 373.15) K. The experimental data were analyzed using STARe DB V12.00 software (Bhopal, India).\n4.2.2. (Vapor-Liquid) Phase Equilibria Measurements\nThe isothermal vapor-liquid phase equilibrium (VLE) measurements were performed using an ebulliometric method, where the main part of the apparatus is a specially designed ebulliometer [57]. The mixture of ionic liquid and ethanol placed in the device is in continuous movement forced by the operation of the Cottrell pump. The superheated two-phase mixture gets decompressed, and it is thrown through the tube onto the socket of the thermometer. It is assumed that the expansion in the equilibrium chamber causes the loss of excess heat of the superheated liquid, which is used to evaporate the additional amount of liquid. As a result, the equilibrium temperature is established on the walls of the thermometric socket under the conditions of pressure in the system. By changing the pressure in the system, one can set the temperature of the measurement. Measurements were made at the following three constant temperatures: 348.15, 338.15, and 328.15 K. In the equilibrium chamber, the two-phase mixture is separated into the following two streams: a steam flow and a liquid flux. Ionic liquids have a negligibly low vapor pressure, so the steam flow consists only of ethanol. Before the two streams are combined, samples can be taken from the gas phase and liquid phase reservoirs. Earlier, the steam flow enters the condenser. A very important role is played by thorough mixing of the combined streams. For this purpose, glass tubes were designed in an appropriate way and stabilizing system comprising the isolated container with a volume of 50 dm3 enabled the pressure to be kept constant within 0.1 kPa and to dampen the pressure fluctuations caused by the bumping of the liquid boiling in the ebulliometer or by the variation of the temperature of the surroundings was implemented. The equilibrium temperature was measured with a resistance thermometer (type P-550, Roth, Germany) with a precision of 0.01 K. The pressure was measured with the precision of 0.1 kPa by a tensiometric vacuum meter (type CL 300, ZEPWN, Poland). The thermometer and the manometer were calibrated by measuring the boiling points as a function of pressure for n-octane, ethanol, and water and compared to values obtained from the literature [58]. The uncertainty was at the level of u(p) = 0.2 kPa and u(T) = 0.05 K. The composition of samples taken from the ebulliometer was determined densimetrically based on previous density measurements in two-component systems using the Anton Paar GmbH 4500 vibrating-tube densimeter (Graz, Austria) with an accuracy of 1\u00b710\u22125 g\u00b7cm\u22123 at each temperature. Only the liquid phase was sampled because, as previously mentioned, the gas phase consisted only of pure ethanol. A calibration curve of density vs. mole fraction of IL was made and the uncertainty in the mole fraction composition was better than 2\u00b710\u22123. The VLE measurement error was caused by an error related to incorrect indications of the thermometer, error related to incorrect indications of the manometer, error resulting from the calibration curve of the manometer, error related to the accuracy of determining the mole fraction of the liquid phase, error related to other factors influencing the determination of the equilibrium temperature, such as the following: imperfection of mixing inside the measuring cell, which creates a concentration gradient, disturbance of the equilibrium conditions during sampling, or impurities present in the sample. The total measurement error is the sum of the factors mentioned above. The combined uncertainty of the method used for the VLE estimation is larger than the instrument error and was estimated at 0.5 kPa.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1940 27 of 30\n4.2.3. Density Measurement\nThe liquid density of pure ILs and their ethanolic solutions were determined at a temperature range from T = (293.15 to 338.15) K with an increment of 5 K at ambient pressure. The densities were measured on an Anton Paar GmbH 4500 densimeter using vibrating tube method. Measurements were made at different temperatures with a built-in thermostat. The precision in the temperature control (internally of 0.01 K) is provided by two integrated Pt 100 platinum thermometers. The apparatus was calibrated at atmospheric pressure using double-distilled degassed water and air. The densimeter is precise to within 1\u00b710\u22125 g\u00b7cm\u22123, and because of the purity of IL, estimated standard uncertainty of the density measurement, u(\u03c1) is better than 5\u00b710\u22123 g\u00b7cm\u22123.\n4.2.4. Dynamic Viscosity Measurements\nViscosity measurements for pure ILs and their ethanolic solution were carried out using DVNext Wells-Brookfield Cone Rheometer (Middleborough, United States of America). The experiment was performed within the temperature range from T = (293.15 to 338.15) K with an increment of 5 K. The apparatus consists of torque measuring system, where a calibrated beryllium-copper spring is the main part. The spring is connected to the drive mechanism of a rotating cone, and it senses the resistance to rotation caused by the presence of a liquid sample between the cone and a stationary flat plate. The resistance to the rotation of the cone produces a torque that is proportional to the shear stress in the fluid. Then, the reading is converted to centipoise units from pre-calculated range charts. The tested pure ionic liquids and their solutions with ethyl alcohol are Newtonian liquids, which means that viscosity does not depend on the shear rate. It was checked before every measurement. The system was previously calibrated to the standards by the manufacturer, and calibration was verified using appropriate standards. The mean standard deviation of viscosity was determined based on standard measurements, and the relative uncertainty, ur(\u03b7) value, was determined to be 0.03. The apparatus is accurate to within 1.0% of the full-scale range reproducibility is within 0.2%. The working temperature range is from 0 \u25e6C to 100 \u25e6C. Two cones were used for viscosity measurements. One for measurements above 250 mPa\u00b7s with a cone radius of 0.012 m and a cone angle of 1.5\u25e6, and the other for measurements below 250 mPa\u00b7s, with a radius of 0.024 m and a cone angle of 0.8\u25e6. The gap between the cone truncation and the plate was 12.7\u00b710\u20136 m.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28041940/s1, Figure S1.
