Motivated by the recent synthesis of monolayer Si2Te2, we explore a family of 2D materials, termed as the Janus Si dichalcogenides (JSD), which parallel the Janus transition metal dichalcogenides and exhibit even stronger inversion asymmetry. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate excellent stability of these materials. We show that their strong structural asymmetry leads to pronounced intrinsic polar field, sizable spin splitting due to spin-orbit coupling, and large piezoelectric response. The spin splitting involves an out-ofplane component, which is beyond the linear Rashba model. The piezoelectric tensor has large value in both in-plane d11 coefficient and out-of-plane d31 coefficient, making the monolayer JSDs distinct among the existing 2D piezoelectrics. In addition, we find interesting strain-induced phase transitions in these materials. Particularly, there are multiple valleys in the conduction band that compete for the conduction band minimum, which will lead to notable changes in optical and transport properties under strain. Our work reveals a new family of Si based 2D materials, which could find promising applications in spintronic and piezoelectric devices.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe field of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been rapidly expanding in recent years, driven by the continued realization of new materials and discovery of their novel properties [1\u20138]. A material\u2019s property is closely connected to its symmetry. While a lot of 2D materials tend to crystallize in high-symmetry structures, there also exist crystals with intrinsic structural asymmetry or exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. Such 2D materials with lower symmetry can be even more interesting, because they can host physical effects that are forbidden in high-symmetry structures. For example, piezoelectricity, which represents the coupling between electric polarization and strain/stress and is important for a wide range of applications such as sensors, actuators, and energy harvesters [6\u20138], necessarily requires the underlying crystals to have broken inversion symmetry. It is also well known that structural inversion asymmetry can help to enhance the Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in 2D systems [9], which is desired for spintronics applications. These points clearly manifest in the Janus monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) [10\u2013 15]. In these materials, the symmetry is lowered by replacing one layer of chalcogen atoms by another species in the same group. For example, starting from monolayer MoSe2 (MoS2) on a substrate, one can achieve monolayer MoSSe via controlled sulfurization (selenization) of the top atomic layer, as successfully demonstrated in experiment [16, 17]. Previous studies have indeed shown that monolayer MoSSe exhibits Rashba-type SOC and\n\u2217 sandongyuwang@163.com; These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020 These authors contributed equally to this work.\nhas large piezoelectric response, especially a nonzero outof-plane piezoelectric coefficient d31 \u223c 0.02 pm/V [18].\nTo incorporate 2D materials into the existing semiconductor technology, Si-based materials are most desired. In a very recent experiment, a Si-based 2D material, the monolayer Si2Te2, was successfully synthesized on a substrate and shown to be a semiconductor [19]. The crystal preserves inversion symmetry, so it does not allow any intrinsic piezoelectricity nor Rashba SOC. Nevertheless, one notes that the structure contains the chalcogen Te atoms forming the two outer layers, similar to the TMDs. Therefore, it is possible to use similar techniques as for synthesizing Janus TMDs [16, 17] and to convert monolayer Si2Te2 into a Janus Si dichalcogenides (JSD) monolayer.\nIn this work, we explore this idea and perform a systematic study on the monolayer JSDs, using firstprinciples calculations. We show that these materials, namely Si2STe, Si2SeTe, and Si2SSe, are all stable in the Janus monolayer structure. They enjoy good thermal and mechanical stability. Using monolayer Si2SeTe as an example, we show that its internal effective electric field along the vertical direction can reach \u223c 1.8 V/A\u030a, which is about twice of monolayer MoSSe. Importantly, the formation of Janus structure breaks the inversion symmetry of monolayer Si2Te2, leading to a sizable SOC splitting in the band structure and a large piezoelectric effect. For the SOC splitting, we show that the split bands also possess a sizable spin-z components, which requires higherorder terms beyond the simple linear Rashba model. As for piezoelectricity, we find that the in-plane coefficient d11 in Si2SeTe is larger than most existing 2D materials, and it also allows a sizable out-of-plane coefficient d31 which is an order of magnitude larger than Janus TMDs. These values are even more enhanced in Si2STe due to the larger contrast between the two chalcogen species.

Our work reveals a new family of 2D semiconductors, which have great potential for spintronic and piezoelectric device applications."

Note that to obtain the tensor elements for a 2D system, a renormalization by the z lattice parameter (i.e., the spacing two neighboring layers) is needed in the calculation [28, 29]. A \u0393-centered 18\u00d718\u00d71 k-point mesh was adopted in the calculation of C`k as well as the electronic structures, and a 10\u00d718\u00d71 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was used for ei` (due to the change of the unit cell).

It consists of four atomic layers stacked in the sequence of Te-Si-SiTe. The JSD monolayer is obtained by replacing the top Te layer by a another chalcogen element, e.g., S or Se, which leads to monolayer Si2STe and Si2SeTe, as shown in Fig. 1(b,c). For completeness, we also consider the closely related JSD material Si2SSe here. Their optimized lattice parameters are listed in Table I. One can see that these parameters are slightly smaller compared to monolayer Si2Te2 (\u223c 3.99 A\u030a) [31, 32], which can be understood because S and Se have smaller radius than Te and their electronegativity is also larger. Because the\n(a) (b)\nTe Si\nSe Si2SeTe\nTe Si\nSi2Te2\nthree JSDs share similar behavior, in the following, we shall mainly focus on Si2SeTe. The results for the other two are briefly mentioned or put in the Supplemental Material [33].\nThe formation of Janus structure lowers the symmetry of the crystal to P3m1 (No. 156). The most important change is that the inversion symmetry P originally preserved in monolayer Si2Te2 is broken in monolayer JSDs, and the system changes from a non-polar crystal to a polar crystal. This underlies the enhanced spin splitting and piezoelectricity to be discussed in a while.\nTo check the stability of these 2D materials, we compute their phonon spectra. Figure 1(d) plots the result for monolayer Si2SeTe. One can see there is no imaginary frequency modes, which indicates that the structure is dynamically stable. In the spectrum, both linear and flexural modes can be observed around the \u0393 point, which shares the general feature of 2D materials [34\u201336].\nTo investigate the thermal stability, we conduct the AIMD simulations with temperatures up to 1000 K. Figure 1(e,f) shows the simulation result on monolayer Si2SeTe at 800 K. One observes that the overall structure is well maintained at the end of the simulation time, which indicates its good thermal stability.\nWe further evaluate the elastic constants of monolayer Si2SeTe.

Using Voigt notation, the tensor takes the form of C`k with `, k = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 6. However, for 2D materials, one usually considers stresses and strains only within the basal plane, whereas the z-direction is stress/strain free. This eliminates the elements with ` or k in {3, 4, 5}. Further constrained by the C3v point group of monolayer JSD, the elastic tensor can be expressed in the form of [18, 28, 29]\nC =  C11 C12 \u00b7C12 C11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (C11 \u2212 C12)/2  , (1) where \u00b7 denotes the zero element, and we omit the 3\u00d7 3 vanishing block corresponding to `, k \u2208 {3, 4, 5}. For monolayer Si2SeTe, we find the calculated C11 = 75.69 Nm\u22121 and C12 = 33.96 Nm\n\u22121, which satisfy the Born criteria [37]: C11 > 0 and C11 \u2212 C12 > 0, confirming its mechanical stability. The shear modulus C66 = (C11 \u2212 C12)/2 is 20.87 Nm\n\u22121. The direction-dependent Young\u2019s modulus C2D(\u03b8) can be obtained as [38]\nC2D(\u03b8) = C11C22 \u2212 C212\nC11 sin 4 \u03b8 +A sin2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03b8 + C22 cos4 \u03b8\n, (2)\nwhere \u03b8 is the polar angle measured from x, and A = (C11C22 \u2212 C212)/C66 \u2212 2C12. For C3v systems satisfying relation (1), one easily finds that C2D is isotropic, as it should be, and\nC2D = C11 \u2212 C212/C11. (3)\nFor monolayer Si2SeTe, the obtained C2D is 60.45 Nm \u22121. This value is much smaller than graphene (\u223c 340 \u00b1 40 Nm\u22121) and MoS2 (\u223c 126.2 Nm\u22121) [28, 39], indicating the better mechanical flexibility of monolayer Si2SeTe. The Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd2D can also be derived from the elastic constants as\n\u03bd2D = C12 C11 , (4)\nwhich is about 0.45 for monolayer Si2SeTe. These material properties and the results for the other two JSD monolayers are listed in Table I."

To better understand this field, in Fig. 2, we plot the planar average of the electrostatic potential energy as a function of the z coordinate for monolayer Si2SeTe. One clearly observes an asymmetric distribution associated with the P breaking. This induces an electrostatic potential energy difference \u223c 0.53 eV between the sides, which can be reflected as a surface dependent work function. As shown in Fig. 2, from the slope of the curve, we extract the strength of the intrinsic polar field to be about 1.79 V/A\u030a. One notes that this value is more than two times that of MoSSe (\u223c 0.856 eV/A\u030a) [20] and is much larger than the practical value that can be achieved by a gate field. The stronger polar field implies more pronounced effects associated with P symmetry breaking.\nNext, we investigate the electronic band structure of monolayer Si2SeTe. Figure 3 plots the band structure in the absence of SOC, along with the projected density of states (PDOS). One observes an indirect gap semiconductor with a band gap of about 276 meV. The low-energy bands are dominated by the Si p orbitals. In Fig. 3, the valence band maximum (VBM) is at the V point near \u0393 on the \u0393-K path. The CBM is also on the \u0393-K path, but at a point P near the midpoint of the path.\nThe band structure with SOC included is shown in Fig. 4. One can see that the system remains a semiconductor. The band gap is slightly reduced to about 235 meV. Interestingly, while the VBM position is more or\n4 Si Se Te\nK \u0393 M K PDOS\nEn er gy (e V)\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0 0.0 0.6 1.2\nV P\nFIG. 3.

In fact, here, the CBM and VBM are quite close to each other in Brillouin zone (BZ), so the system is almost a direct gap semiconductor.\nPrevious calculations on monolayer Si2Te2 predicted it to be a quantum spin Hall insulator [31, 32]. Here, we have checked the Z2 invariant of monolayer Si2SeTe [33] (and also for the other two) by the Wilson loop method [40, 41] and found that it is trivial. Nevertheless, one observes that SOC does bring notable changes to the band structure. Especially for the conduction bands around the \u0393 point, there appears a large band splitting. The original doublet at \u0393 in Fig. 3 now split into two doublets in Fig. 4 with a sizable shift in energy \u223c 170 meV. This splitting is closely connected to the structural asymmetry in 2D JSD. In comparison, in monolayer Si2Te2, the bands are spin degenerate due to the preserved inversion and time reversal symmetries.\nLet\u2019s focus on the lower doublet, which is close to the CBM.

In Fig. 5(b-d), we plot the spin polarization on an equi-energy surface at 0.14 eV, close to the degeneracy point. Interestingly, besides in-plane spin polarization Sx and Sy, we also find a sizable spin polarization Sz in the out-of-plane direction. This is clearly beyond the simple linear Rashba model HR = \u03b1(k \u00d7 z\u0302) \u00b7 \u03c3 [9], which only has in-plane components. Here, \u03b1 is the coupling strength, k the momentum is in the 2D basal plane, and \u03c3 is a vector of Pauli matrices corresponding to electron spin. To capture the emergence of Sz component, we construct an effective k \u00b7 p model expanded at \u0393 by including higher order terms in the expansion. The doublet at \u0393 corresponds to the \u03934 double-valued representation of C3v. Using the two states as basis, the generators for C3v can be represented as\nC3 = e \u2212i\u03c0\u03c3z/3, My = \u2212i\u03c3y, (5)\nand the time reversal operator T = \u2212i\u03c3yK with K the complex conjugation. These symmetries constrain the form of the effective Hamiltonian by\nC3H(k)C \u22121 3 = H(R3k), (6) MyH(k)M \u22121 y = H(kx,\u2212ky), (7)\nT H(k)T \u22121 = H(\u2212k), (8)\nwhere the momentum k is measured from \u0393. Expanding H(k) to the k4 order under the above constraints, we obtain the following k \u00b7 p effective model:\nHeff =c1(kx\u03c3y \u2212 ky\u03c3x) + c2k2\u03c30 + c3(kx\u03c3y \u2212 ky\u03c3x)k2\n+ c4(k 3 y \u2212 3kyk2x)\u03c3z + c5k4\u03c30, (9)\nwhere \u03c30 is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix and c\u2019s are the model parameters. One observes that the first term is just the linear Rashba SOC. Up to k2 order, there is no contribution to the Sz polarization. The Sz polarization term only appears at the k cubic order, in the fourth term here. The cubic terms are also related to the hexagonal\n5\nwarping effect. The even order terms does not give a spin splitting, which is a result of the T symmetry. Using this model to fit the DFT band structure of monolayer Si2Te2, we obtain the following parameter values: c1 = 0.022 eV\u00b7A\u030a, c2 = 1.731 eV\u00b7A\u030a 2 , c3 = 25.262 eV\u00b7A\u030a 3 , c4 = 89.806 eV\u00b7A\u030a4 and c5 = 3.721 eV\u00b7A\u030a 5 ."

            "text": "Piezoelectricity results from the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and electrical states. It requires P symmetry breaking. Hence, it does not appear in monolayer Si2Te2 but naturally exists in monolayer JSDs. The piezoelectric response can be described by the piezoelectric stress tensor eijk or the piezoelectric strain tensor dijk, which are third rank tensors\nwith i, j, k = 1, 2, 3. They are defined by the relations\neijk = \u2202Pi \u2202\u03b5jk , dijk = \u2202Pi \u2202\u03c3jk , (10)\nin which Pi is the electric polarization vector, \u03b5jk and \u03c3jk are the strain and stress tensors, respectively. Typically, one combines the latter two indices in eijk and dijk by using the Voigt notation and simplify them as ei` and di`, where ` = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 6. In practice, one first calculates ei`, then di` can be derived from the relation\nei` = \u2211 k dikCk`. (11)\nFor 2D systems, as we have mentioned, one usually only considers strain and stress in the basal plane. This eliminates the elements in ei` and di` for ` = 3, 4, 5. (The out-of-plane electric polarization, i.e., i = 3, still needs to be considered.) For monolayer JSDs, the C3v symmetry requires the piezoelectric tensors taking the following form [18, 29]\ne =  e11 \u2212e11 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212e11 e31 e31 \u00b7  , (12)\nd =  d11 \u2212d11 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u22122d11 d31 d31 \u00b7  . (13) Here, for simplicity, we dropped the three columns corresponding to ` = 3, 4, 5. The relation in (11) now takes the form of\nd11 = e11\nC11 \u2212 C12 , d31 = e31 C11 + C12 . (14)\nHere, for monolayer JSDs, the piezoelectric tensor ei` or di` has only two independent element. d11 (e11) represents an in-plane response, i.e., a piezoelectric polarization along x is induced by a stress (strain) along x (see Fig. 6(a)). The more interesting part is the out-ofplane response embodied by d31 (e31), which means the stress (strain) along x can also produce a polarization in z direction (see Fig. 6(a)). Such a response is rare in 2D materials and was first proposed in Janus monolayer TMD materials [18]. It was suggested that this out-of-plane piezoelectricity could promote the flexibility of piezoelectric device operations and the compatibility with the existing microelectronic device configurations. In Janus monolayer TMDs, d31 is found to be on the order of 0.01 pm/V and d11 is of a few pm/V [18].\nOur results for monolayer JSDs are listed in Table II. One observes that due to the stronger intrinsic field, the piezoelectric coefficients are also much larger than those of Janus TMDs. The values are overall an order of magnitude larger than Janus TMDs. Among the three JSDs, the strongest response is achieved in monolayer Si2STe,\n6 1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\nEn er gy (e V)\nEn er gy (e V)\nK \u0393 M K K K\u0393 M 1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\nEn er gy (e V)\nKK \u0393 M KK \u0393 M\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nBa nd g ap (e V)\nStrain (\uff05)\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\n(e)\n\u03b5= -4\uff05 \u03b5= -1\uff05\n\u03b5= 2\uff05 \u03b5= 6\uff05\nVP\nQ V V\nR\nCBM-P VBM-V\nCBM-R VBM-V\nMetal Indirect gap Almost direct gap Indirect gap\nFIG. 7.

We note that this value of d11 is larger than most reported 2D materials [8], perhaps only lower than some members of the SnSe family (such as 2D SnSe and GeSe). The magnitude of d31 is also large among the existing 2D materials (although some predicted structures may achieve even higher values [42, 43]). In Fig. 6(b), we compare the piezoelectric properties among well-known piezoelectric 2D materials. One observes that the monolayer JSD materials stand out as the one that has large value in both d11 and d31. This indicates their great potential in device applications."

            "text": "2D materials generally can sustain much larger strains than 3D materials. Here, from the calculation of the strain-stress curve [33], we find that the monolayer JSDs have a linear elastic region extended to \u223c 8% strain, and the critical strains can be > 20%. This again demonstrates the flexibility of these materials.\nStrain engineering has been widely used as an effective way to tailor the properties of 2D materials [44\u201347]. Here, we investigate the strain effects on the band structure. In Fig. 3 and 4, we have noted that for monolayer Si2SeTe, there are two parts of the conduction band, P and Q, which compete for the CBM. One naturally expects that a small strain can switch their order in energy and determine which one becomes the CBM. This is confirmed by our results in Fig. 7, which shows the band structures under different biaxial strains. One observes that a small compressive strain \u22121% can already switch the CBM from Q to P . Then the band gap types changes from almost direct to indirect. The band gap size also shrinks with compressive strain and even closes at \u22122% strain. On the tensile strain side, the P valley moves up in energy, and the band gap increases with strain. Interestingly, at about 3% strain, the CBM changes from Q to another valley R on the \u0393-M path (see Fig. 7(d)). These results are summarized in Fig. 7(e).\nThe case in monolayer Si2STe is different from Si2SeTe. As shown in Fig. 8(b), without strain, monolayer Si2STe is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap \u223c 361 meV. Its VBM is at a similar V point like monolayer Si2SeTe. However, its CBM is at M point. Under compressive strains, the band gap decreases and vanishes at about \u22123% strain. As for tensile strains, there is a transition at about 1% strain where the CBM switches from M to R, as shown in Fig. 8(c,d). A schematic phase diagram is shown in Fig. 8(e).\nSuch transitions in the CBM location could result in notable physical effects. For example, the accompanied change in the band gap type makes a big difference in the optical properties, especially the luminescence properties of a semiconductor. In addition, the different valleys have different effective mass, which directly affects the carrier transport. For instance, for monolayer Si2SeTe, the shift of CBM from P valley to Q valley decreases the electron effective mass by almost five times from about 0.7me to about 0.15me where me is the bare electron mass. This change will manifest as a jump in the conductivity under strain."

Derived from the Janus structure, the strong spin splitting and the large piezoelectric response make these materials promising for device applications. Besides conventional concepts such as spin transistors/modulators, mechanical sensors, actuators, power transducers, etc., combining the two characters may generate some novel device concepts like some piezoelectric controlled spin devices.\nExperimentally, monolayer Si2Te2 has been successfully grown on Sb2Te3 substrate [19].

(a-d) Evolution of band structure of monolayer Si2STe under different biaxial strains. (e) shows the variation of band gap under applied strain and a schematic phase diagram for monolayer Si2STe.\nJanus TMDs. For example, they may be obtained via sulfurization or selenization of Si2Te2 on substrate at el-\nevated temperatures, due to the stronger electronegativity of S/Se than Te. Another way is to first strip off the top Te layer and replace them with H using a remote H plasma, and then proceed with thermal sulfurization or selenization. These methods were successfully demonstrated in previous works on synthesizing Janus TMDs [16, 17]. As for strain application, in practice, the compressive strain can be applied by choosing a proper substrate with a matching lattice but smaller lattice constant. Applying tensile strain on 2D materials is more convenient. It can be done by a beam bending apparatus or by using a stretchable substrate [48, 49].\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a family of Si based 2D materials, the 2D JSD materials, which could be realized from monolayer Si2Te2 using similar techniques for the synthesis of Janus TMDs. We demonstrate the good stability of these materials. We show that the their intrinsic polar field can be even stronger than Janus TMDs. Due to this strong inversion symmetry breaking, they manifest sizable SOC splitting and pronounced piezoelectric response. The SOC splitting acquires a large out-of-plane component which is beyond the linear Rashba model. The piezoelectric tensor has large value in both d11 and d31, making these materials distinct among the existing 2D materials. We work reveals a new 2D family of materials that are compatible with Si-based technology and have great potential for spintronic and piezoelectric device applications."
