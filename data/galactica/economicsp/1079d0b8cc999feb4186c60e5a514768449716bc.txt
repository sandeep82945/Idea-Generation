Aim Based on the risk compensation theory, this study was designed to investigate the relationship between health behaviors of inpatients and COVID-19 vaccination during the epidemic with regard to the Omicron variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Taizhou, China. Subject and methods We conducted an online self-administered survey with a group of inpatients in a grade III, class A hospital in Taizhou, China, from February 27, 2022, to March 8, 2022. A total of 562 complete questionnaires were collected, and 18 questionnaires completed in under 180 seconds were rejected, leaving a total of 544 (96.8%) valid questionnaires collected. The participants who had received a COVID-19 vaccine were asked to describe the differences in their health behaviors before and after the vaccination, and the data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 22.0 software. Results There were significant differences in the percentage of individuals wearing masks (97.2% and 78.9%, P < 0.001) and the percentage of hand washing after taking off the mask (89.1% and 63.2%, P < 0.001) between the inoculated group and the uninoculated group; however, there were no significant differences in other health behaviors. The participants showed better health behaviors (handwashing and wearing a mask) after the vaccination than prior to it. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the Peltzman effect did not increase risk behaviors during the Omicron epidemic. There was no reduction in health behaviors among inpatients after the COVID-19 vaccine, which may have even improved their health behaviors. conclusions In this study, the concept of risk compensation was not applicable to our results. After being vaccinated with a COVID19 vaccine, the health behaviors of the population did not decrease and may have even improved.
