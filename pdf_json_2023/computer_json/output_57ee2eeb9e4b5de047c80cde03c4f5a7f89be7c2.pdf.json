    "abstractText": "A quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix A is an infinite M -matrix that can be written as the sum of a semi-infinite Toeplitz matrix and a correction matrix. This paper is concerned with computing the square root of invertible quasi-Toeplitz M -matrices which preserves the quasi-Toeplitz structure. We show that the Toeplitz part of the square root can be easily computed through evaluation/interpolation at the m roots of unity. This advantage allows to propose algorithms solely for the computation of correction part, whence we propose a fixed-point iteration and a structure-preserving doubling algorithm. Additionally, we show that the correction part can be approximated by solving a nonlinear matrix equation with coefficients of finite size followed by extending the solution to infinity. Numerical experiments showing the efficiency of the proposed algorithms are performed..",

Quasi-Toeplitz M -matrices are infinite M -matrices with an almost Toeplitz structure, they are encountered in the numerical solution of a quadratic matrix equation [11] involved in 2-dimensional Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) stochastic processes [23] and are recently studied in [16] in terms of their theoretical and computational properties.\nIn this paper, we are interested in the quasi-Toeplitz M -matrices that belongs to the class QT \u221e = {T (a) + E : a(z) \u2208 W, E \u2208 Kd(`\u221e)}, where T (a) is a semi-infinite Toeplitz matrix associated with the function a(z) = \u2211 i\u2208Z aiz i\n\u2217The work of the first author was partly supported by by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No.12001262 and by Jiangxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation under grant No.20224BAB211006.

It has been proved in [9, Theorem 2.16] that the class QT \u221e is a Banach algebra with the infinity matrix norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e, which turns out to be \u2016A\u2016\u221e = supi \u2211\u221e j=1 |ai,j | for A = (ai,j)i,j\u2208Z+ . For A = T (a) + E \u2208 QT\u221e, T (a) is called the Toeplitz part with a symbol a, E is called the correction part. Matrices in the class QT\u221e have rich and elegant theoretical and computational properties, we refer the reader to [3\u201311, 22, 24] for more details.\nFor a quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix A = T (a) + EA \u2208 QT\u221e, it has been proved in [16] that if A is an (invertible) M -matrix, then T (a) is also an (invertible) M -matrix. Moreover, it shows that if A is invertible, there exists a unique quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix S = T (s) +ES \u2208 QT\u221e such that A = S2. Concerning the computation of matrix S, Binomial iteration and Cyclic Reduction (CR) algorithm have been proposed in [16], where the CR algorithm seems to be better suited in the numerical computations. However, both the Binomial iteration and the CR algorithm exploit the quasi-Toeplitz structure indirectly by performing approximate operations of semi-infinite quasi-Toeplitz matrices in the format. It would be natural to ask whether the quasi-Toeplitz structure can be fully exploited to propose more efficient algorithms.\nSuppose B = T (b)+EB \u2208 QT\u221e satisfies (I\u2212B)2 = A, where A = T (a)+EA is a given quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix, then we have for the symbols of the Toeplitz parts that (1\u2212 b(z))2 = a(z). Observe that for a positive integer n > 0, there is always a unique Laurent polynomial b\u0302(z) = \u2211n i=\u2212n+1 b\u0302z\ni that interpolates b(z) at the 2n roots of unity. Based on the technic of evaluation/interpolation, we investigate computation of the coefficients bi of b(z) = \u2211 i\u2208Z biz\ni, so that the Toeplitz part T (b) of the quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix A can be easily obtained.\nConcerning the computation of the correction part, we propose a fixed-point iteration with a linear convergence rate, and a structure-preserving doubling algorithm, which is of quadratic convergence rate. Moreover, we show that the correction part can be approximated by extending a finite size matrix to infinity, where the finite size matrix solves a nonlinear matrix equation. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms provide convergence acceleration in terms of CPU times comparing with the Binomial iteration and CR algorithm proposed in [16], both of which keep the whole quasi-Toeplitz matrices in the computations.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the remaining part of this introduction, we recall some definitions and properties concerning quasi-Toeplitz matrices and M -matrices. Sections 2 and 3 concern with algorithms that fully exploit the quasi-Toeplitz structure of square root of invertible quasi-Toeplitz M -matrices, in Section 2 we show how the Toeplitz part is computed, while in Section 3, we design and analyze the convergence of algorithms that are applicable in computing the correction part. In Section 4, we show that the correction part can be approximated by extending to infinity of the solution of a nonlinear matrix equation with finite size coefficients. In Section 5, we show by numerical\nexamples the efficiency of the proposed algorithms."

Denote by B(`\u221e) the Banach space of bounded linear operators from `\u221e to itself, we first recall definition of M -operators on B(`\u221e). For definition of more general M -operators on a real partially ordered Banach space, we refer the reader to [18, 21, 25] and the references therein. M -operators on the Banach space `\u221e are defined as\nDefinition 1.1. An operator A \u2208 B(`\u221e) is said to be a Z-operator if A = sI\u2212P , with s \u2265 0, P (`\u221e+ ) \u2286 `\u221e+ , where `\u221e+ = {x = (xi)i\u2208Z+ \u2208 `\u221e : xi \u2265 0 for all i}. A Z-operator is said to be an M -operator if s \u2265 \u03c1(P ), where \u03c1(P ) is the spectral radius of P . A is an invertible M -operator if s > \u03c1(P ).\nAs matrices in QT\u221e can be represented as a matrix of infinite size, we keep using the term M -matrix when referring M -operators in QT\u221e. This way, a matrix A \u2208 QT\u221e is said to be an M -matrix if A = \u03b2I \u2212 B with B \u2265 0 and \u03b2 \u2265 \u03c1(B), and A is invertible if \u03b2 > \u03c1(B). Here B \u2265 0 means that B is an elementwise nonnegative infinite matrix.\nThe following lemma contains a collection of properties of quasi-Toeplitz matrices and quasi-Toeplitz M -matrices, where properties (i) and (ii) have been proved in [13], while properties (iii) - (v) can be found from [16].\nLemma 1.2. If A = T (a) + EA \u2208 QT\u221e and B = T (b) + EB \u2208 QT\u221e, then the following properties hold:\ni) AB = T (ab)\u2212H(a\u2212)H(a+) \u2208 QT\u221e, where (H(a\u2212))i,j = (a\u2212i\u2212j+1)i,j\u2208Z+ and (H(a+))i,j = (ai+j\u22121)i,j\u2208Z+ ;\nii) it holds that \u2016a\u2016 W = \u2016T (a)\u2016\u221e \u2264 \u2016A\u2016\u221e;\niii) T (a) \u2265 0 if A \u2265 0.\niv) \u2016a\u2016 W = a(1) if T (a) \u2265 0.\nv) T(a) is an (invertible) M -matrix if A is an (invertible) M -matrix.\nThe following lemma shows that an invertible M -matrix in the class QT\u221e admits a unique quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix as a square root.\nLemma 1.3. [16, Theorem 3.6] Suppose A = \u03b2(I\u2212A1) \u2208 QT\u221e satisfies \u03b2 > 0, A1 \u2265 0 and \u2016A1\u2016\u221e < 1, then there is a unique B \u2208 QT\u221e such that B \u2265 0, \u2016B\u2016\u221e < 1, and (I \u2212B)2 = I \u2212A1.\nFor quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix A = \u03b3(I \u2212 A1) \u2208 QT\u221e such that A1 \u2265 0 and \u2016A1\u2016\u221e < 1, it can be seen from Lemma 1.3 that it suffices to compute matrix B such that (I \u2212 B)2 = I \u2212 A1. In what follows, we propose algorithms for computing the Toeplitz part and the correction part of matrix B."

Actually, the values of b\u2032\u2032(1) \u2212 b\u0302\u2032\u2032(1) can be easily obtained. Indeed, once the coefficients b\u0302j of b\u0302(z) = \u2211n j=\u2212n+1 b\u0302jz j are computed, one can easily obtain\nb\u0302\u2032\u2032(1) = \u2211n j=\u2212n+1 j(j \u2212 1)b\u0302j .

Algorithms for computing the approximations of the coefficients of g(z) has been proposed in [11], based on which we propose the\nfollowing Algorithm 1 that is more efficient in computing the coefficients b\u0302j of the Laurent series b\u0302(z) = \u2211n j=\u2212n+1 b\u0302jz j , so that we get an approximation T (b\u0302) to the Toeplitz part T (b) in the sense that \u2016T (b)\u2212T (b\u0302)\u2016\u221e = \u2016b\u2212b\u0302\u2016W \u2264 (1+ 1 2n ) for a given tolerance . It can be seen that the overall computational cost of Algorithm 1 isO(n log n) arithmetic operations. Now the Toeplitz part of matrix B is approximated by T (b\u0302), it remains to compute the correction part of B in order to complete the computation of the square root. We show this subject in next section."

This method has been motivated by the ideas in [12], where the SDA that enables refining an initial approximation is applied to solve quadratic matrix equations with quasi-Toeplitz coefficients. We fist recall the design and convergence analysis of SDA. For more details of SDA, we refer the reader to [12], [2, Chapter 5] and [15].\nIn the finite dimensional space, the design of SDA is based on a linear pencil M \u2212 \u03bbN , where M and N are 2n\u00d7 2n matrices of the form\nM = [ E O \u2212P I ] , N = [ I \u2212Q O F ] , (8)\nwhere E,F, P,Q are n\u00d7n matrices, I and O are, respectively, the n\u00d7n identity matrix and the zero matrix. Suppose there are n \u00d7 n matrices X and W such that\nM [ I X ] = N [ I X ] W.\nThen, the SDA consists in computing the sequences defined as\nEk+1 = Ek(I \u2212QkPk)\u22121Ek Pk+1 = Pk + Fk(I \u2212 PkQk)\u22121PkEk; Fk+1 = Fk(I \u2212 PkQk)\u22121Fk; Qk+1 = Qk + Ek(I \u2212QkPk)\u22121QkFk,\n(9)\nwhere E0 = E,F0 = F, P0 = P and Q0 = Q.\nWe mention that the scheme (9) is quite related to the forms of matrices M and N in (8), which is called the standard structured form-I. For different forms, say the standard structured form-II (see [2, Chapter 5]), different schemes can be obtained.\nConcerning the convergence results of SDA, it has been proved in [12] that\nLemma 3.3. [12, Theorem 2] Let X,Y,W, V be n\u00d7 n matrices such that\nM [ I X ] = N [ I X ] W, M [ Y I ] V = N [ Y I ] ,\nand it satisfies that \u03c1(W ) \u2264 1, \u03c1(V ) \u2264 1, \u03c1(W )\u03c1(V ) < 1.

We are ready to show how SDA can be applied in the computation of EB .\nSuppose A = I \u2212 A1 \u2208 QT\u221e is such that A1 \u2265 0 and \u2016A1\u2016\u221e < 1, we have from Lemma 1.3 that the matrix equation\n(I \u2212X)2 = I \u2212A1 (10)\nhas a unique nonnegative solution B \u2208 QT\u221e satisfying \u2016B\u2016\u221e < 1.

Let V = (2I \u2212B)\u22121, it is easy to check that V solves the quadratic matrix equation\nA1Y 2 \u2212 2Y + I = 0. (12)\nMoreover, we have V = 12 \u2211\u221e i=0( 1 2B) i \u2265 0 and \u2016V \u2016\u221e \u2264 12 \u2211\u221e i=1( 1 2\u2016B\u2016\u221e)\ni = 1\n2\u2212\u2016B\u2016\u221e < 1.\nSuppose T (b) with b \u2208 W is the Toeplitz part of B, replacing X by T (b)+H in equation (11) results in the following quadratic matrix equation\nH2 + (T (b)\u2212 2I)H +HT (b) +R = 0, (13)\nwhere R = T (b)2\u22122T (b)+A1. Then, equation (13) can be equivalently written as\nM\u0303 [ I H ] = N\u0303 [ I H ] B,\nwhere M\u0303 = [ T (b) I \u2212R 2I \u2212 T (b) ] and N\u0303 = [ I 0 0 I ] .\nAccording to [12, Theorem 3], the pencil M\u0303 \u2212 \u03bbN\u0303 can be transformed into the pencil M\u2212 \u03bbN , where M and N are of the form\nM = [ SA1 0 \u2212SR I ] , N = [ I \u2212S 0 S ] ,\nwhere S = 2I \u2212 T (b). It can be seen that M and N are of the same forms as those in (8), and we have\nM [ I H ] = N [ I H ] B,\nso that SDA can be applied to the pencilM\u2212\u03bbN , which consists of computing the sequences as defined in the scheme (9) by setting\nP0 = E0 = (2I \u2212 T (b))\u22121B, Q0 = F0 = S.\nOn the other hand, it can be verified that the matricesM and N also satisfy\nM [ Y I ] Z = N [ Y I ] , (14)\nwhere Y = V (I \u2212 T (b)V )\u22121, Z = (I \u2212 T (b)V )V (I \u2212 T (b)V )\u22121. It can be seen that Z has the same spectrum as V so that \u03c1(Z) = \u03c1(V ) \u2264 \u2016V \u2016\u221e < 1, we then have from the fact \u03c1(B) \u2264 \u2016B\u2016\u221e < 1 that \u03c1(B)\u03c1(Z) < 1. Hence, according to Lemma 3.3, we obtain the following convergence result of SDA when applying to the pencil M\u2212 \u03bbN .\nTheorem 3.4. For A = I \u2212 A1 \u2208 QT\u221e such that A1 \u2265 0 and \u2016A1\u2016\u221e < 1, suppose I\u2212B with B = T (b)+EB \u2208 QT\u221e is the unique quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix such that (I\u2212B)2 = A. If the scheme (9) can be carried out with no breakdown, then the sequence {Pk} converges to EB and it satisfies limk \u2016EB \u2212 Pk\u20161/2\nk \u2264 \u03c1(B)\u03c1(Z), where Z = (I\u2212T (b)V )(2I\u2212B)\u22121(I\u2212T (b)V )\u22121 and V = (2I\u2212B)\u22121.\nActually, according to the ideas in [12], the scheme (9) allows to refine a given initial approximation to EB , that is, if EB = E\u0303B +D, where E\u0303B is given\nand it satisfies \u2016T (b)+E\u0303B\u2016\u221e < 1, then SDA can be used to compute D. Indeed, if H in equation (13)is replaced by E\u0303B +D, it yields\nD2 + (T (b) + E\u0303B \u2212 2I)D +D(T (b) + E\u0303B) + R\u0303 = 0, (15)\nwhere R\u0303 = (T (b) + E\u0303B) 2 \u2212 2(T (b) + E\u0303B) + A1. Analogously to the analysis above, we obtain the matrix pencil M\u0302 \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 such that\nM\u0302 = [ S\u0303A1 0\n\u2212S\u0303R\u0303 I\n] , N\u0302 = [ I \u2212S\u0303 0 S\u0303 ] ,\nwhere S\u0303 = (2I \u2212 T (b)\u2212 E\u0303B)\u22121, and it holds\nM\u0302 [ I D ] = N\u0302 [ I D ] B, M\u0302 [ Y\u0303 I ] Z\u0303 = N\u0302 [ Y\u0303 I ] ,\nwhere Y\u0303 = V (I \u2212 (T (b) + E\u0303B)V )\u22121, Z\u0303 = (I \u2212 (T (b) + E\u0303B)V )V (I \u2212 (T (b) + E\u0303B)V ) \u22121.\nNow apply SDA to the pencil M\u0302 \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 , we obtain the sequences defined as\nE\u0303k+1 = E\u0303k(I \u2212 Q\u0303kP\u0303k)\u22121E\u0303k P\u0303k+1 = P\u0303k + F\u0303k(I \u2212 P\u0303kQ\u0303k)\u22121P\u0303kE\u0303k; F\u0303k+1 = F\u0303k(I \u2212 P\u0303kQ\u0303k)\u22121F\u0303k; Q\u0303k+1 = Q\u0303k + E\u0303k(I \u2212 Q\u0303kP\u0303k)\u22121Q\u0303kF\u0303k,\n(16)\nwhere P0 = E0 = S\u0303A1 and Q0 = F0 = S\u0303. Observe that \u03c1(Z\u0303) = \u03c1(V ) < 1, then according to Lemma 3.3 it holds that limk \u2016P\u0303k \u2212D\u20161/2 k\n\u221e < \u03c1(B)\u03c1(V ) < 1, that is, the sequence {P\u0303k} converges to D, so that EB = E\u0303B +D is computed.\nOne alternative is to set E\u0303B = (b(1)\u2212 T (b)1)eT1 , where 1 = (1, 1, . . .)T and e1 = (1, 0, . . .)\nT , then T (b)+E\u0303B is a nonnegative substochastic matrix such that (T (b)+ E\u0303B)1 = b(1)1. Numerical experiments in Section 5 shows that there are cases where a reduction in CPU time occurs when setting E\u0303B = (b(1)\u2212T (b)1)eT1 and applying iteration (16) for computing D.\nWe mention that when applying the fixed-point iteration and SDA to compute the correction part of a quasi-Toeplitz M -matrix, the computations rely on the package CQT-Toolbox of [10] which implements the operations of semiinfinite quasi-Toeplitz matrices. In next section, we show that the the fixedpoint iteration and SDA can be applied to a finite dimensional nonlinear matrix equation, whose solution after extending to infinity is a good approximation to EB ."

Substituting EB , T (b) and W into the equation (I \u2212 T (b)\u2212 EB)2 = I \u2212A1, we get\nE211 \u2212 (Ik \u2212 T11)E11 \u2212E11(Ik \u2212 T11) = W11 \u2212E12E21 \u2212E12T21 \u2212 T12E21, (18)\nwhere Ik is the identity matrix of size k. Consider the matrix equation\nG2 \u2212 (Ik \u2212 T11)G\u2212G(Ik \u2212 T11) = W11, (19)\nwhich is equivalent to\n(Ik \u2212 T11 \u2212G)2 = I \u2212A11 \u2212 T12T21, (20)\nwhere A11 is the principal k \u00d7 k submatrix of A1. Observe that A11 \u2265 0 and T12T21 \u2265 0, if in addition \u03c1(A11 + T12T21) < 1, which can be verified if \u2016A11 + T12T21\u2016\u221e < 1, then I \u2212 A11 \u2212 T12T21 is a nonsingular M -matrix. In what follows we assume \u2016A11 + T12T21\u2016\u221e < 1, then I \u2212 A11 \u2212 T12T21 admits a unique M -matrix as a square root (see [14, Theorem 6.18]), so that equation (20), as well as equation (19), has a unique solution G such that T11 + G \u2265 0 and \u03c1(T11 +G) < 1. In fact, analogously to [16, Theorem 3.1], it is can be seen that \u2016T11 +G\u2016\u221e < 1.\nSubtracting equation (18) form equation (19) yields\nG2 \u2212 E211 \u2212 (G\u2212 E11)(Ik \u2212 T11)\u2212 (Ik \u2212 T11)(G\u2212 E11) = \u2206W, (21)\nwhere \u2206W = E12E21 + E12T21 + T12E21.

(23)\nObserve that 2Ik \u2212 T11 \u2212 G is a nonsingular M -matrix as T11 + G \u2265 0 and \u03c1(T11 + G) < 1. Moreover, we have \u2016T11 + E11\u2016\u221e < 1 as T11 + E11 is the principal k \u00d7 k submatrix of T (b) + EB and \u2016T (b) + EB\u2016\u221e < 1.

Then we deduce from (22) and (24) that\n\u2016G\u2212 E11\u2016\u221e \u2264 \u221e\u2211 j=1 (\u03b1\u03b2)j\u03b1\u2016\u2206W\u2016\u221e\n\u2264 \u03b1 1\u2212 \u03b1\u03b2 (2\u2016b\u2016w + ) . (25)\nLet EG be the matrix that coincides in the leading principal k\u00d7k submatrix with G and is zero elsewhere, then we have from (17) and (25) that\n\u2016EG \u2212 EB\u2016\u221e \u2264 \u2016EG \u2212 E(k)B \u2016\u221e + \u2016E (k) B \u2212 EB\u2016\u221e\n\u2264 \u2016G\u2212 E11\u2016\u221e + \u2264 (1 + \u03b1 1\u2212 \u03b1\u03b2 (2\u2016b\u2016w + )) . (26)\nHence, we can see from (26) that for a given > 0 and sufficiently large k, if \u03b1\u03b2 \u2264 c < 1 for some constant c, then EG may serve as a good approximation to EB . This implies that the correction part EB can be approximated by firstly computing the numerical solution of equation (19) and then extending the computed solution to infinity.\nIt is not difficult to see that the fixed-point iteration (5) and SDA can be applied to equation (19) for computing the solutionG. Numerical experiments in\nnext section show that when the size k is small, it is efficient to approximate the correction part EB by computing the solution of equation (19) and extending it to infinity, while when k is large, that is, the coefficients are large-scale matrices, both fixed-point iteration and SDA lose the effectiveness.\nWe provide some insight on how to select integer k such that the matrix G of size k\u00d7 k, after extending to infinity, is approximate enough to EB . Observe that the substitution of EG into the equation (I \u2212 T (b)\u2212X)2 = A yields\nA\u2212 (I \u2212 T (b)\u2212 EG)2 = (\n0 GT12 \u2212W12 T21G11 \u2212W21 \u2212W22,\n) ,\nfrom which we see that EG is a good approximation to EB if \u2016GT12\u2212W12\u2016\u221e < c , \u2016T21G \u2212W21\u2016\u221e < c and \u2016W22\u2016\u221e < c for some constant c and a given > 0. It can be seen that these inequalities hold if\n\u2016GT12\u2016 < c1 , (27)\n\u2016T21G\u2016\u221e < c2 , (28)\nand max{\u2016W12\u2016, \u2016W21\u2016, \u2016W22\u2016\u221e} < c3 , (29)\nfor some constants c1, c2 and c3. Hence, we can choose k such that inequalities (27)-(29) are satisfied.\nActually, since W is a correction matrix, one can check that inequality (29) holds if we choose k such that \u2016W \u2212W (k)\u2016\u221e < , where W (k) is the infinite matrix that coincides with the leading principal k \u00d7 k submatrix of W and is zero elsewhere. Hence, if the matrix W has a nonzero part of size n1 \u00d7 n2, we can choose k such that k > max{n1, n2}.\nWe next show how to choose k such that inequalities (27) and (28) hold. Observe that for > 0, there is N \u2208 Z+ such that \u2016EB \u2212 E(n)B \u2016\u221e < for any\nn \u2265 N . Set k > N and G = ( G11 G12 G21 G22 ) \u2208 Rk\u00d7k, where G11 \u2208 RN\u00d7N , G12 \u2208 RN\u00d7(k\u2212N), G21 \u2208 R(k\u2212N)\u00d7N and G22 \u2208 R(k\u2212N)\u00d7(k\u2212N). Observe that\n\u2016EG \u2212 E(N)B \u2016\u221e \u2264 \u2016EG \u2212 EB\u2016\u221e + \u2016EB \u2212 E (N) B \u2016\u221e,\nwhich, together with inequality (26) and the fact \u2016EB \u2212 E(N)B \u2016\u221e < , implies that \u2016EG\u2212E(N)B \u2016\u221e < c\u03031 for some constant c\u03031. On the other hand, observe that\nEG\u2212E(N)B coincides in the leading principal k\u00d7k submatrix with ( \u2217 G12 G21 G22 ) and is zero elsewhere, where \u2217 is an N \u00d7N matrix, we thus have \u2016G12\u2016\u221e < c\u03031 , \u2016G21\u2016\u221e < c\u03031 and \u2016G22\u2016\u221e < c\u03031 .\nSuppose b(z) = \u2211p j=\u2212q bjz j , then from the partition of T (b) we know that\nT12 =\n( O\nT\u0303\n) , where O is a zero matrix of size (k \u2212 p) \u00d7\u221e and T\u0303 is a p \u00d7\u221e\nmatrix with a p\u00d7p nonzero submatrix located in the bottom leftmost corner. If k\nis selected such that k\u2212N > p, we have from \u2016G12\u2016\u221e < c\u03031 and \u2016G21\u2016\u221e < c\u03031 that \u2016GT12\u2016\u221e \u2264 max{\u2016G12\u2016\u221e, \u2016G21\u2016\u221e}\u2016T\u0303\u2016\u221e < c1 for some constant c1. Similarly, if k \u2212N > q, inequality (28) holds.\nThe above analysis indicates that if the matrix W has a nonzero part of size n1 \u00d7 n2 and the symbol b of T (b) is a Laurent series b(z) = \u2211p j=\u2212q bjz\nj , then we can choose k such that\nk \u2212N > p,K \u2212N > q and k > max{n1, n2}. (30)\nObserve that the value of N in (30) is unknown, hence we can obtain a necessary condition for determining k, that is, k > max{p, q, n1, n2}. In our numerical experiments, we have set k = 3 max{p, q, n1, n2} and it seems sufficient.\nNote that equation (18) is a special case of the following equation\nX2 \u2212AX \u2212XA = B,\nwhere A is a large-scale nonsingular M -matrix with an almost Toeplitz structure, and B is a low-rank matrix. It seems interesting to investigate whether there are more efficient algorithms for computing the solution by exploiting the quasi-Toeplitz structure of A and the low-rank structure of matrix B. We leave this as a future consideration."

The number of iterations, CPU times required in the computations and the relative residuals are reported in Table 1. In Table 2 we report the features of the computed EB computed by the fixed-point iteration, including band of the Toeplitz part, the rank and the number of the nonzero rows and columns of the correction part.\nIt can be seen from Table 1 that the number of iterations required by SDA is much less than the number of iterations required by the fixed-point iteration. Concerning the CPU time, we can see that the fixed-point iteration takes less time than SDA in Test 1, while in Test 2, the CPU time taken by SDA is about 1/3 of that taken by the fixed-point iteration. Moreover, in test 1, when applying SDA to compute matrix D such that EB = D + E\u0303B , where E\u0303B = (s(1) \u2212 T (s)1)eT1 , it takes 119.56s, which provides a reduction in CPU time comparing with the case where SDA is applied directly for the computation of EB .\nExample 5.2. Let A = I \u2212 S with S = T (s) + ES \u2208 QT\u221e, where T (s) = s0I with s0 < 1 and EB is the correction matrix with a (p+m+ n)\u00d7 (p+m+ n)\nleading submatrix EPS and zero elsewhere. Here, E P S =  Vp Om \u2212s0In , where Om is the zero matrix of size m\u00d7m, In is the identity matrix of size n,\nand the matrix Vp =\n( Up\u00d7q\nO(q\u2212p)\u00d7q\n) is a q \u00d7 q block matrix with\nUp\u00d7q =  u11 u12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u1p \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u1q 0 u22 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u2p \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u2q ... . . . . . . ... . . .\n... 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 upp \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 upq  p\u00d7q .\nwhere uii = \u2212s0 for i = 1, . . . , p, and ui,j \u2265 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , p and j = i+ 1 . . . , q. Moreover, for i = 1, 2, . . . , p, it satisfies that \u2211q j=i+1 uij < 1.\nFor different values of the parameters s0,m, n, p and q as listed in Table 3, we apply the fixed-point iteration (5) and SDA to compute the matrix EB such that (I \u2212 T (b) \u2212 EB)2 = A. It can be seen that the symbol b(z) satisfies (1 \u2212 b(z))2 = 1 \u2212 s0, which, together with the fact that \u2016b\u2016W = \u2016T (b)\u2016\u221e < 1, implies b(z) = 1 \u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 s0, so that T (b) is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements being 1\u2212 \u221a\n1\u2212 s0. In this example, we observe that EB can be obtained by the fixed-point iteration as well as SDA in just one or two steps. We also implement the Binomial iteration (BI) and the CR in [16] for computing the the whole matrix B = T (b) +EB , the CPU time and residual error are compared with the fixedpoint iteration and SDA in the computation of EB , and are reported in Table 4. We mention that the residual error for BI and CR is obtained by r = \u2016(I \u2212 Y\u0302 )2 \u2212A\u2016\u221e/\u2016A\u2016\u221e, where Y\u0302 is the computed square root.\nAs we can see from Table 4, the fixed-point iteration (5) and SDA take less CPU time comparing with the Binomial iteration and CR algorithm. Moreover,\nthe fixed-point iteration (5), comparing with CR algorithm, has a speed-up in the CPU time by a factor of about 4 in Test 1 and 2.5 in Tests 2 and 3.\nExample 5.3. Let A = cI \u2212 T (s) with T (s) = cqt(sn, sp), where c, sn and sp are constructed in MATLAB as\nsp = rand(p, 1), sn = rand(q, 1), sn(1) = sp(1) = 1, c = sum(sn) + sum(sp).\nIt can be seen that \u2016T (s)\u2016\u221e = \u2016s\u2016W < c, so that A is an invertible M - matrix. For different values of p and q, we apply the fixed-point iteration (5) and SDA for computing matrix EB such that c(I\u2212T (b)\u2212EB)2 = A, where the symbol b(z) is approximated by b\u0302(z) that is computed by Algorithm 1.\nWe also apply the fixed-point iteration and SDA to equation (19) for computing its solution G, so that EB can be approximated by extending G to infinity. Table 5 reports the CPU time taken by the fixed-point iteration and SDA when applied to matrix equation (19), as well as the CPU time needed in the computation of the EB relying on the operations of quasi-Toeplitz matrices.\nWe observe from Table 5 that when the values of p and q are both small, say p = 4, q = 2, it seems that applying the fixed-point iteration (5) and SDA to the truncated matrix equation (19) takes less CPU time. For different values of p and q listed in Table 5, the rank of the correction matrix is k=501, 1539, 8496 and 3834, respectively, we observe that when k becomes large, the algorithms applied to the truncated matrix equation (19) take more CPU times, and it can be seen that the algorithms relying on operations of quasi-Toeplitz matrices are more efficient."

We propose algorithms for computing the Toeplitz part and the correction part respectively. The Toeplitz part is computed by Algorithm 1 at the basis of evaluation/interpolation at the 2n roots of unique. We propose a fixed-point iteration and a structure-preserving doubling algorithm for the computation of the correction part. Moreover, we\nshow that the correction part can be approximated by extending the solution of a nonlinear matrix equation to infinity. Numerical experiments show that SDA in general takes less CPU time than the fixed-point iteration. There are also cases where the fixed-point iteration is inferior to SDA. There are cases where both the fixed-point iteration and SDA work better than the Binomial iteration and CR algorithm that exploit the quasi-Toeplitz structure indirectly."
