    "abstractText": "One of the biggest environmental problems of our time is the increase in illegal landfills in forests, rivers, on river banks and other secluded places. In addition, waste in rivers causes damage not only locally, but also downstream, both in the water and washed ashore. Large islands of waste can also form at hydroelectric power stations and dams, and if they continue to flow, they can cause further damage to the natural environment along the river. Recent studies have also proved that rivers are the main source of plastic pollution in marine environments. Monitoring potential sources of danger is therefore highly important for effective waste collection for related organizations. In our research we analyze two possible forms of waste detection: identification of hot-spots (i.e. illegal waste dumps) and identification of water-surface river blockages. We used medium to high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery as our data source, especially focusing on the Tisza river as our study area. We found that using satellite imagery and machine learning are viable to locate and to monitor the change of the previously detected waste.",

            "text": "As a result of stricter waste management regulations in the EU, the number of reported waste-related misdemeanors is increasing every day. A significant amount of plastic stocks endanger both human and environmental health and can also lead to water pollution and animal diseases [1,2,3]. Previous studies in the past decade have identified running freshwaters like rivers as the main source of plastic pollution in marine environments [4]. It is estimated that approximately 80% of plastic pollution is carried by rivers into the sea [5], and the annual plastic input into marine environments from rivers is between 1.15 and 2.41 million metric tons worldwide [6]. In our research we have focused on Hungary and the surrounding drainage basin territory. While an overall survey on approximately 1000 rivers showed that the average plastic load of the Danube (the major river in Hungary) is well exceeded by rivers in Asia [7], the current state of plastic pollution is still highly problematic. The plastic transport of the Danube river is estimated to 4.2 metric tons / day, so the yearly plastic load to the Black Sea ar X iv :2\n30 3.\n14 52\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n5 M\nis 1500 tons minimum [8]. Another long term observations of Hungarian water authorities revealed on the river Tisza the frequency of floating bottles can reach 500 bottles per minute leading to the name plastic flood and leaving river Tisza one of the most polluted tributary of the Danube [9].\nTherefore it is important that waste collection organizations are able to monitor potential sources of danger. Traditional methods of identifying illegal waste deposits usually require manual surveys, which is not well scalable due to its high demand of human workforce. Remote sensing studies of waste management have so far been underexplored field, due to the spectrally variable and complex nature of different materials (include plastic), and their similarity to other land covers such as water and shadow.\nEarth observation satellites equipped with medium- and high-resolution multispectral sensors have undergone great advancement in the past decade. Multitemporal imagery of designated areas became available on a monthly, weekly, or even daily basis, which can also be used for change analysis. These multispectral images can be analyzed based on both their visible and invisible spectrums, as well as the various indices created from them, in order to better separate the waste-covered areas from their surroundings.\nMachine learning can be considered a subset of artificial intelligence and consists of computer algorithms which can improve automatically using experience and data. These algorithms build a model based on sample data (so-called training data), which can be utilized to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in various applications where it is difficult or impractical to develop traditional algorithms to perform the required tasks. Machine learning is widely used nowadays and is increasingly used in remote sensing.\nThe goal of our research is to develop an accurate classification method for plastic waste detection to provide a viable platform for repeatable, cost-effective and large-scale monitoring. Such a robust waste monitoring solution would speed up the detection of illegal waste hot-spots close to water flows and floating waste islands on rivers, as well as support waste collection actions with an automatic monitoring system. The proposed solution is based on a machine learning approach, the random forest classification algorithm [10]. Some implementations also provide the possibility to control the size of the trees (e.g. the maximum height of the tree or the maximum size of the vertices), which can be used to limit the execution time of the algorithm [11].\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the most important concepts related to the topic and provides an insight into waste detection attempts in the literature. Section 3 presents the areas used to teach the classification model and the detection methods developed during the project. Then Section 4 illustrates the results obtained. Finally, a summary of the study and our own conclusions are presented in Section 5."

Its Sentinel-2 mission is based on a constellation of two identical satellites in the same orbit2. Each satellite carries an innovative, 13 spectral band, high-resolution multispectral imaging instrument that continuously monitors changes on the Earth\u2019s surface.\nSentinel-2\u2019s high-resolution multispectral instrument is based on the wellestablished legacy of the French SPOT3 and US Landsat satellites4. The multispectral imager is the most advanced of its kind - in fact, it is the first optical earth observation instrument to include three bands in the \u201dred edge\u201d range, which provide key information on the state of vegetation. It integrates two large visible near-infrared and short-wave infrared focal planes, each equipped with 12 detectors and combining 450 000 pixels. Pixels that may fail during the mission can be replaced with redundant pixels. The two types of detectors use high quality filters to ensure perfect separation of spectral bands. The optical-mechanical stability of the instrument must be extremely high, which meant the use of silicon carbide ceramics for the three mirrors and focal plane, as well as for the structure of the telescope itself. The 13 spectral bands, from visible to near infrared and shortwave infrared (as listed in Table 1), with a spatial resolution of 10 to 60 metres, bring the observation of the Earth\u2019s surface to an unprecedented level of resolution [13,14].\nThe bands we used were mostly those with a resolution of 10 and 20 meters, with a pixel covering an area of 100 and 400 m2 respectively. Hence, it was only suitable for identifying large landfills."

In the article the authors investigated whether Sentinel-2 satellite imagery could be used to identify and track plastic litter floating on the sea surface [18]. To do this, a pilot study was carried out. A 3 m \u00d7 10 m target consisting of plastic water bottles was created and subsequently placed in the sea near a port in Limassol, Cyprus (see Figures 1 and 2). An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was also used to take multispectral aerial photographs of the study area in the same time as a Sentinel-2 satellite. The spectral signature of the water and the plastic debris placed in the water was recorded using an SVC HR1024 spectroradiometer [19]. The study found that plastic debris was most easily detected in the Near Infrared (NIR) wavelength. Seven of the indices commonly used in processing satellite imagery were tested for their ability to identify plastic litter in water. In addition, the authors tested two new indices: the Plastic Index (PI) and the Reversed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RNDVI). The results are visualized in Figure 3. The newly developed Plastic Index was able to identify plastic objects floating on the water surface and was the most effective index in identifying plastic litter. In reality, the results may be spoiled by the fact that the bottles are not in such a nice condition, which could change the spectral values."

Remote sensing studies of waste management have so far been less explored due to the spectrally variable and complex nature of tyres and plastics and their similarity to other land cover such as water and shadows. Therefore, the overall objective of Page et al. was to develop an accurate classification method for detecting both tire and plastic debris to provide a viable platform for repeatable, cost-effective, and large-scale monitoring [20]. An extended land cover classification combining the thematic indices of\nthe Copernicus Sentinel-2 optical imagery and the Copernicus Sentinel-16 microwave data has been developed. They used two Random Forest classification algorithms specifically trained for the detection of rubber and plastic debris based on imagery from Scotland.\nAn important success and application of deep learning in recent years has been in the field of image processing. In their study, Youme et al. present an automated solution for detecting hidden landfills utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery in the Saint Louis area of Senegal, West Africa7, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) [21]. The results show that the model is good at identifying the areas concerned, but has difficulties in some areas where there are no clear ground truths."

In such cases, the river leaves its bed and when it recedes, it carries the waste with it and deposits it in another, undesired location. Such hot-spots along the river Tisza are mainly located in Ukraine and Romania. Hungarian waste collection organizations already have experience of the hot-spots where they have to move to after a flood. If our classification shows that the extent of the hot-spot is significant in the pre-flood picture, then an on-site investigation is justified.\nThe landfill in Pusztaza\u0301mor played a major role in teaching the model used for this method, as the aim was to detect features very similar to this area. No other procedure than classification was used. The results are visualized in Figure 4."

From the classified image, we created a binary one: waste and water classes were grouped together and everything else was left out. We performed a morphological opening on the result in order to remove noise (small areas that fall away from the river). This was followed by a dilation to widen the contours of the remaining areas. For these we used a 5 \u00d7 5 matrix as a kernel. The end result seen in Figure 5 is now mainly just the river and the island of junk floating on it."

In the other version, we used only those bands that are possible to obtain from both Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images (Table 2). The reason for this was that we wanted to embed the final solution in our own framework, which is able to process Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images in a consistent way.

Also, the processing of the images could be done in parallel, which could lead to a reduction in processing time.
