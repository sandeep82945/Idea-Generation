            "text": "Fluorescence is a technique of choice among the various imaging methods available, due to its sensitivity and minimally invasive nature.1\u20133 Ideally, dyes should absorb and emit at wavelengths compatible with live-cell imaging (red to near IR), with high levels of brightness and photostability. However, the use of uorescent probes is subject to several limitations, such as the intrinsic uorescence of the tissue (autouorescence) or a limited depth of penetration linked to the low transparency of tissues in the wavelength ranges classically used in uorescence microscopy. Two-photon excitation uorescence microscopy is a good alternative for overcoming these drawbacks, as it involves absorption in the near infrared (NIR) range, which minimizes the absorption and diffusion of light by biological\nand Modeling for the Biology of Cancer\n, France.

Moreover, excitation is conned to a small volume (around 1 fL) at the focal point, considerably decreasing the risk of photodamages.4 In recent decades, considerable effort has been devoted to developing two-photon excitable probes.5 In addition to photophysical criteria, uorophores should ideally satisfy physico-chemical and biological criteria concerning solubility in water and cell permeability, for example. Probes meeting all these requirements can be conjugated to small molecules or biomolecules for labelling purposes. However, the uorophore moiety may affect the distribution of the labelled molecule within the cell. The development of bioorthogonal reactions has been a major breakthrough, enabling the conjugation of drugs with uorescent tags aer target recognition.6 Nevertheless, distinguishing the uorescence of the free uorophore from that of the conjugated uorophore can still be an issue, particularly because the reporter dye is oen present in excess relative to the drug studied, to accelerate the kinetics of the bioorthogonal reaction. Aer incubation, it is therefore oen necessary to x the cells and wash them to remove the excess dye, which limits the usefulness of this technique for monitoring living cells. Conversely, dye washing in living cells can be time-consuming (up to several hours).7,8 This procedure can also result in the removal of the probe, if it is not sufficiently well bound to its target or organelle. Fluorogenic bioorthogonal probes have been developed to overcome these problems.9 The\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8119\u20138128 | 8119\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

This so-called \u201cturnon\u201d property enables unambiguous cell labelling and provides an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. The design of such probes is based on the prouorophore-quenching effect of the click handle. Azide,10\u201312 sydnone13\u201315 and tetrazine16\u201322 have been used to quench prouorophores via different photoinduced energy or electron transfer mechanisms. Tetrazines have been widely used, as they undergo rapid inverse electron demand Diels\u2013 Alder reactions (iEDDA) with strained dienophiles, with kinetic constants between 1 and 106 M\u22121 s\u22121.23 Tetrazine uorogenic probes with high turn-on ratios have been developed, some of which have been used for super-resolution imaging.24\u201327 Impressive uorescence enhancements, up to several thousandfold, have been reported for some uorogenic probes,17\u201319,28 but much lower turn-on ratios have been reported for red-emissive probes.29,30 Before the study by Mao et al.,30 the best turn-on ratios reported for uorogenic red-emitting bioorthogonal probes remained at about a 50-fold uorescence enhancement.26,29,31\u201335 Finally, only a few recent examples of two-photon excitable uorogenic probes have been reported.36,37 None of these probes has both a high turn-on ratio and a high two-photon absorption capacity (reported cross-sections < 65 GM) for red-emissive probes. We decided to ll this gap by designing a series of uorogenic probes based on an acridan scaffold. Our recently reported optimized probe, Acri-Py, meets all the criteria for use in live-cell imaging, including high twophoton brightness and red emission (Fig. 1).38 Finally, it also has a high cross-section relative to its molecular weight (d/M = 7.9) \u2014an essential feature of biocompatible uorophores. We then envisaged different tetrazine attachments to this scaffold to compare different quenching mechanisms (Fig. 1). We changed the nature of the spacer (conjugated Acri-vi series versus non-conjugated Acri-et series). We also modied the distance between the uorophore and its quencher by preparing ortho-, meta- and para-derivatives for both designs.\n8120 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8119\u20138128\nWe found that the ortho-derivatives had higher uorogenic efficiencies than their regioisomers. The reaction rate constants of iEDDA reactions were up to 10 times higher than those reported for this type of reaction with BCN. Ortho derivatives had impressively high kinetic constants that were explained by TDDFT calculations. We then demonstrated the potential of our best uorogenic probe, Acri-ovi, for selective protein labelling experiments and for wash-free two-photon imaging in live A549 cells."

            "text": "We based our design on the recently published Acri-Py (Fig. 1).38 The nitrogen atom of the acridan is an ideal anchor point for tetrazine attachment. We focused on the through-bond energy transfer (TBET) and photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) quenching mechanisms as we wanted to compare these designs on our two-photon excitable uorophore. We therefore prepared two series of uorogenic probes differing only in the link between the dye and the tetrazine. The distance between the two chromophores is known to affect PeT efficiency and should not be greater than 10 \u00c5. TBET requires conjugation between the two chromophores. The unsaturated linker must also prevent the chromophores from being coplanar in the ground state, thereby enabling them to be electronically independent. We thus used a styryl linker (Acri-vi series, Fig. 1). For the PeT design, we replaced the styryl linker with an oxymethylphenyl linker, which should prevent TBET without affecting the distance between the uorophore and the quencher. The Acri-vi and Acri-et series were therefore considered good candidates for a comparative study of these two quenching mechanisms. Finally, we investigated the effect of the distance between the two chromophores, by preparing ortho,meta and para derivatives. Such a study has been done on the rhodamine scaffold for the PeT design.26 In contrast, no systematic study has been reported on TBET design, as no ortho derivative with a styryl spacer has ever been described, even on well-studied rhodamine derivatives.18 However, some groups reported that meta substituted isomers exhibit higher turn-on ratios than para derivatives.28,29,39 Using TDDFT, we were also able to predict this distance on optimized structures (ESI, Fig. S1\u2020). The ortho derivative was expected to be the most efficient for PeT, as it has the shortest distance between the two chromophores (7.6 \u00c5), but all three regioisomers meet the distance criterion (<10 \u00c5). The tetrazine is perpendicular to the acridine core, which is essential for TBET (ESI, Fig. S2\u2020).\nThe syntheses of both series began from the same starting point, the commercially available 9,9-dimethylacridan, and followed a similar route. Buchwald\u2013Hartwig amination coupling was used to generate N-methoxyphenyl-9dimethylacridan 1 or N-bromophenyl-9,9-dimethylacridan 7 in moderate-to-high yields. A Vilsmeier\u2013Haack reaction on acridans 1 and 7 yielded dialdehydes 2 and 8, respectively, in good yields. We then applied the Heck coupling conditions developed by Devaraj et al. to generate vinyltetrazine derivatives 10.18 This step required the use of the non-volatile 2-(1,2,4,5-\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

We obtained the corresponding dialdehydes of the Acri-et series, by performing Williamson ether synthesis with bromomethyl tetrazine 4 as previously described.26 The nal compounds, Acri-vi and Acri-et, were obtained through a Knoevenagel reaction. Conventional conditions for the Knoevenagel reaction were adapted to avoid an excess of nucleophilic base, given the sensitivity of tetrazine to nucleophiles. Indeed, mixing dialdehyde 10 and compound 6 in the presence of pyrrolidine under classical Knoevenagel conditions led to tetrazine degradation. Stoichiometric addition of pyrrolidine at 0 \u00b0C led to the formation of iminium salts without degradation. However, the addition of the N-methyl-4-methyl pyridinium salt 6 to the iminium salts releases pyrrolidine in the reaction medium. We then simultaneously added the Nmethyl-4-methyl pyridinium salt 6 and various acids in order to trap the released pyrrolidine (ESI Table S1\u2020). Finally, acetic acid was the best candidate. Aer simultaneous addition of acetic acid and compound 6, the reaction mixture was stirred at 4 \u00b0C for 16 h. This protocol prevents the degradation of the tetrazine moiety. This reaction led to the formation of the Knoevenagel products in moderate to good yields. Finally, we obtained the desired uorogenic probes in a four- or ve-step sequence, with overall yields between 10 and 22% (Scheme 1).\nWe then studied iEDDA adducts with (bicyclo[6.1.0]no-4-yn9yl)methanol (BCN). BCN reacts with tetrazine more slowly than trans-cyclooctene (TCO), but it is a more pertinent partner, as its iEDDA cycloadduct with tetrazine (pyridazine) is no longer able to quench uorescence whereas the TCO-cycloadduct (dihydropyridazine) could display a residual uorescence quenching effect.35 We then performed the click reaction between BCN and the probes and checked the purity of the products by HPLC (ESI\u2020)."

All displayed absorption at about 485 nm, with high molar absorption coefficients (up to 61 000 M\u22121 cm\u22121), and emission in the red window, with a maximal emission wavelength between 638 and 652 nm. All dyes are very weakly uorescent in native forms.38 As they became uorescent upon immobilization, their photophysical properties and those of their click adducts were determined in a buffer containing Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to mimic a constrained environment. We rst showed that 100 equivalents of BSA were sufficient to reach the uorescence plateau for each uorogenic probe and its clicked product (ESI Fig. S3\u2020). By performing this titration experiment, we were able to ensure that the turn-on factors measured with 100 equivalents of BSA were independent of the affinity of the molecules for BSA. The photophysical properties of the probes and their click adducts in BSA are summarized in ESI Table S3.\u2020 The absorption properties of the probes and their click adducts with BSA were similar to those in buffer alone. There was a slight red-shi in the absorption wavelength (495 nm versus 485 nm). Conversely, maximal emission wavelengths were blue-shied between 590 and 605 nm. However, the spectra obtained were broad (from 550 nm to 750 nm), allowing detection in the far-red window. The uorogenic probes had low uorescence quantum yields in BSA, conrming the efficiency of uorescence quenching. Moreover, the click adducts had uorescence quantum yields of about 0.15, similar to that of Acri-Py, demonstrating the restoration of uorescence upon the uorogenic reaction (ESI, Table S3\u2020).\nIn order to accurately determine turn-on ratios, we monitored uorescence during the reaction between the probe (2 mM) and 10 equivalents of BCN, with 100 equivalents of BSA in the buffer (Fig. 2).\nThe turn-on ratios obtained were consistent with the ratios of uorescence quantum yields, with the same ranking and similar values (Table 1). Turn-on ratios were systematically higher for the Acri-vi series than for the Acri-et series. The TBET\nChem.

Moreover, the position to which the tetrazine is attached appears to have a major effect on quenching efficiency, for both PeT and TBET designs: turn-on (ortho) [ turn-on (meta) > turn-on (para) for both series (Table 1). This ranking was predicted for the PeT design, as the distance between the tetrazine and the uorophore moiety increases in the same\n8122 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8119\u20138128\norder (Fig. S1\u2020). However, it was more unexpected for the TBET design. Several previous studies have reported that meta-connected tetrazine gave a higher turn-on ratio than para isomers in TBET designs,28,29,39 but the reasons for this phenomenon have not been determined. A unique feature of our study is the comparison of ortho,meta and para substitutions on the phenyl spacer in the vinyl and ether series. Both ortho isomers displayed a high uorescence enhancement for red-emitting probes\u201422.0 for Acri-ovi and 13.6 for Acri-oet\u2014with the same ranking for kinetics. Under standard conditions for cellular imaging (micromolar concentration), both ortho derivatives reacted within 10 minutes, while the conversion of themeta and para derivatives remained incomplete aer 30 minutes. Kinetic constant measurements conrmed this trend (Table 1). The rate constants for reactions between BCN and all probes were compatible with bioorthogonal reactions in live cells (k > 29M\u22121 s\u22121, see Table 1), but the rate constant for Acri-ovi was particularly impressive (k= 1100 M\u22121 s\u22121). Unexpectedly, it was much higher than that for the other probes: 18 times greater than that of its meta analog and 38 times higher than that of its para analog (ESI Fig. S4\u2020). Similarly, the reaction of Acri-oet with BCN was faster than that of its meta and para analogs (5 times faster). This in vitro study shows that Acri-ovi is clearly the most efficient uorogenic probe of these series, in terms of both turnon ratio and kinetic constant.\nTo conrm that the conditions (BSA in buffer) can reect what happens in live cells, turn-on measurement of the reaction between Acri-ovi and BCN in cell lysate was performed. A 12-fold enhancement was observed for this uorogenic reaction, demonstrating that measurements in BSA provide a relevant in vitro model (see ESI Fig. S5\u2020).\nWe then wanted to investigate the turn-on of the probe with various dienophiles. We chose trans-cyclooctene (TCO), which is known to react fast and 2-methyl-N-(isopropyl)cycloprop-2-ene1-carboxamide (CP), which, conversely, is a weak reactive partner. However, this small strained dienophile could be of interest as it can label small molecules or biomolecules without steric impact compared with large strained cycloalkynes.40,41 We selected Acri-oet and Acri-ovi as the most uorogenic probes. We then measured their uorescence at 2 mM in BSA-containing buffer, and their uorescence two hours aer addition of the dienophile at 20 mM (Fig. 2C). Two hours is a reasonable time beyond which the reaction is difficult to apply in a biological environment. As already reported in the literature,26,28,35 we observed that the increase in uorescence is strongly dienophile-dependent. TCO-cycloadducts were less uorescent than BCN-cycloadducts for both probes. While studying kinetics between Acri-ovi and TCO, we observed a rapid conversion to a uorescent species (k= 1052 M\u22121 s\u22121, see ESI Fig. S6\u2020 and 2C) followed rst by a decrease in uorescence, which was followed by a slow restoration of uorescence. This phenomenon has already been mentioned by others28,35 and has been studied in detail recently.42 We can therefore assume that the uorescent 4,5-dihydropyridazine is formed rapidly by iEDDA and tautomerizes to 1,4-dihydropyridazine, which acts as a uorescence quencher. The subsequent increase in uorescence can be attributed to the uorescent pyrazine resulting from the slow\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

TCO is therefore not a good candidate for these uorogenic reactions, as it leads to different species. Furthermore, and unexpectedly, the rate constant of IEDDA between Acri-ovi and TCO was not higher than between Acri-ovi and BCN. Thus, BCN is undoubtedly the best partner for our probes and we have retained it for further biological applications. We also studied the uorogenic reaction between Acri-ovi and Acri-oet with CP. In contrast, no or very weak uorogenicity was detected. This is in accordance with the low kinetic constant determined for iEDDA between Acri-ovi and CP (k = 0.02 M\u22121 s\u22121, see ESI Fig. S6\u2020) which does not allow the reaction to proceed within 2 h."

TPEF requires highly concentrated samples (around 10\u22124 M). We were therefore unable to record the TP absorption spectra of these probes in buffer containing 100 equivalents of BSA as BSA is not soluble at 10\u22122 M in buffer. To circumvent this issue, measurements were performed in glycerol, a viscous solvent, which mimics a constrained environment (Table 2). Relative to their linear properties in aqueous buffer, we observed a slight red-shi in absorption and a blue-shi in emission. The probes emitted with a poor uorescence quantum yield (between 1 and 5%), whereas the BCN-clicked adducts had higher uorescence quantum yields (8 to 15%). Interestingly, the turn-on ratios of iEDDA reactions between BCN and probes follow the same order in glycerol and BSA: turn-on (ortho) [ turn-on (meta) > turn-on (para) and turn-on (Acri-ovi) = 15.3 > turn-on (Acri-oet) = 9.0, Acri-ovi remaining the most uorogenic dye (Tables 1 and 2).

All had high absorption cross-sections (>2400 GM), like Acri-Py.38 These values are particularly impressive for two-photon excitable red-emissive uorogenic probes, as the highest values reported to date are below 65 GM.37 We also compared the performances of the dyes in terms of two-photon brightness (d \u00d7 FF), the most relevant property for imaging. The brightness values obtained (up to 416 GM) were more than 20 times higher than those reported in previous studies for red-emissive compounds.36,37 Depending on the respective absorption properties of the probes and their iEDDA products with BCN, we observed that 1P turn-on can be slightly higher or slightly lower than 2P-turn-on."

The click reaction proceeds in two steps: inverse electronic demand Diels\u2013Alder (iEDDA) cycloaddition followed by a retroDiels\u2013Alder reaction (elimination of N2) to form the pyridazine ring. The overall reaction was strongly exergonic, releasing approximately 90 kcal mol\u22121 (Fig. 4, S8 and Table S5 ESI\u2020). The rst step was the rate-determining step, consistent with previous reports,43 whereas nitrogen elimination was almost barrier-less (calculated activation energy below 2 kcal mol\u22121). The calculated activation energy of the cycloaddition between BCN and Acri-ovi was 1.6\u20131.8 kcal mol\u22121 lower than that for Acri-mvi and Acri-pvi (Table 3). The conversion of these gures into reaction rates indicates a 15\u201320 times faster reaction for Acri-ovi, consistent with the experimentally observed variation (18- to 30-fold variation; Table 1). This difference can be explained by the lower energy of the LUMO of Acri-ovi than that of the other two derivatives, decreasing the energy of the early transition state (ESI Table S6\u2020).\nThe photophysical properties of the initial Acri-Xvi and their clicked counterparts were then studied by TDDFT calculations. The theoretical and experimental absorption maxima were within the usual range for such models (mean averaged error <8%, ESI Table S7\u2020). For all Acri-Xvi, the rst calculated transition at 565 nm was located on the tetrazine and corresponded to a weakly allowed n\u2013p* transition (low oscillator strength) (Fig. 5, ESI Fig. S9 and Table S8\u2020). The second calculated vertical transition was a p\u2013p* transition\nFig. 4 Schematic representations (energy vs. reaction coordinate) of th\n8124 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8119\u20138128\ncentered on the Acri chromophore, with a high oscillator strength, consistent with the high experimental 3 values (Tables S2 and S3\u2020). Aer the click reaction with BCN, only the Acri transition remained, allowing the restoration of uorescence (ESI Table S8\u2020 and Fig. 5). The Acri-Xvi series was designed to undergo uorescence quenching through excited state energy transfer (EET), which is highly dependent on the relative orientations of the chromophores involved. We hypothesized that the lower uorescence quantum yield (and higher turn-on ratio following the click reaction) of Acri-ovi might be due to a more favorable interaction between the uorophore and the quenching moiety than for the other two isomers. We quantied the interactions more accurately by evaluating the excitonic coupling between Acri and tetrazine with the transition charge from the electrostatic potential (TrESP) method (Table 4).44 The calculations revealed a much higher coupling for Acri-ovi (2.90 meV) than for Acri-mvi (1.35 meV) and Acri-pvi (0.93 meV), consistent with stronger quenching of emission by Acri-ovi.

We rst prepared and characterized human lysozymemodied with BCN by standardmethods (ESI\u2020). The reaction between BCN-tagged lysozyme and Acri-ovi proceeded rapidly atmicromolar concentrations. Aer 10minutes in aqueous buffer, the uorogenic dye was completely converted to its click adduct with a turn-on ratio similar to that for BCN alone (turn-on = 25, ESI Fig. S11\u2020). The crude reaction was analyzed by denaturing SDS-PAGE. Themodied clicked lysozyme was detected by both Coomassie blue and uorescence staining, whereas no uorescence was detected for the mixture of native lysozyme protein and Acri-ovi (column 4 versus 3, Fig. 6). We then performed the reaction in A549 cell lysate, to investigate the behavior of our dye in a more complex cellular medium.

Acri-ovi, like all the Acri-vi and Acri-et probes, had no signicant effect on the viability of A549 cells, as the IC80 exceeded 10 mM (ESI Fig. S12\u2020). Live A549 cells were incubated with 2 mM Acri-ovi for 3 h and imaged by one- and two-photon uorescence microscopy (Fig. 7A, panels a and c). No staining was observed. Aer the addition of BCN and incubation for 30 min, uorescence microscopy under the same imaging conditions (laser power) revealed clear cellular labelling, demonstrating the uorogenicity of Acri-ovi in live cells (Fig. 7A, panels b and d). The click adduct exhibits high brightness and contrast under one and two-photon excitations. We then quantied cellular uorescence intensities and determined the turn-on ratios in living cells. Fluorescence enhancements of 13.8-fold and 8.0-fold were measured under single and two-photon excitations, respectively. The difference between 1 PE and 2 PE turn-on ratios can be partly explained by the difference in one-photon and twophoton absorption properties between Acri-ovi and its clicked product. Indeed, in glycerol, we observed that the single-photon absorption of the clicked product was higher than that of Acriovi while the two-photon absorption of the clicked product was lower than the probe (Table 2 and Fig. 3).

            "text": "Two series of uorogenic probes were synthesized in this comparative study of PeT and TBET designs on the same scaffold. The synthesis of these probes required methodological developments, in particular in order to overcome the sensitivity of tetrazine to nucleophiles. Both series of probes had interesting uorogenic properties, with good-to-excellent reaction rate constants with BCN, a crucial criterion for bioorthogonal reactions. BCN was the best partner for uorogenic reactions in terms of both turn-on ratio (22 for Acri-ovi) and rate constant (k = 1100 M\u22121 s\u22121 for Acri-ovi) as TCO led to different uorescent and nonuorescent species. Molecular modeling provided a rational explanation for the unexpectedly much higher rate constant for Acri-ovi than for its regioisomers. The iEDDA was identied as the rate-determining step and activation energy was lower for the ortho derivative. Finally, we found that the TBET design was more efficient that the PeT design on this scaffold. We also investigated the effect of the distance between the tetrazine moiety and the uorophore, by connecting the uorophore in the ortho, meta and para positions. Our data\n8126 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8119\u20138128\nindicate that the efficiency of tetrazine quenching depends on this distance, with greater quenching activity for shorter distances. This effect of the distance was already known for PeT designs, but had not been reported for TBET designs. TDDFT calculations were performed to evaluate excitonic coupling, which was found to be much greater for Acri-ovi than for Acrimvi and Acri-pvi, consistent with the stronger quenching observed with the ortho isomer. Acri-ovi is, therefore, our optimized uorogenic probe and suitable for use in bioorthogonal reactions, as demonstrated by its unequivocal labelling of BCNlabelled lysozyme in a cell lysate. Moreover, these probes are the best two-photon excitable uorogenic probes obtained to date, with impressive values for both cross-section and brightness (up to 20 times higher than previously reported).37 The high turn-on measured in cells (13.8 for 1P excitation and 8.0 for 2P) allows its use without any washing steps. Live-cell imaging by two-photon microscopy showed that Acri-ovi was an efficient uorogenic probe that could be used with a very low laser power. This work paves the way for the further development of uorogenic probes based on the Acri-ovi scaffold including for in vivo two-photon microscopy."
