However, the emergence of\n(multi)drug-resistant pathogens renders these valuable antibiotics useless; making it necessary to\nderivatize compounds for new compound characteristics, which is often difficult by chemical de novo\nsynthesis due to the complex nature of the molecules. An alternative to substance derivatization is\nmutasynthesis. Herein, we report about a mutasynthesis approach, targeting the phenylglycine (Phg)\nresidue for substance derivatization, a pivotal component of streptogramin antibiotics.

The most recent new compound classes that have been introduced to the market are cyclic lipopeptides (daptomycin by Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 2003) and oxazolidinones (linezolid by Pfizer in 2000).7 Thus, discovering and developing new antimicrobials and strategies to combat resistance is a key challenge in the years ahead.\nThe most important sources for many powerful antibiotics are actinomycetes and fungi, which are the origin of up to twothirds of all antibiotics in clinical use today.8 These involve all different classes of antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines, glycopeptide antibiotics, b-lactams, rifamycins, or streptogramins.8 While the biosynthetic potential of actinomycetes for unknown antibiotics is still considered high,9,10 there are also other approaches that aim to get access to novel bioactive substances, as for instance the structural\na Department Bioresources for Bioeconomy and Health Research, Leibniz Institute\nDSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstra\u00dfe 7B,\n38124 Braunschweig, Germany.

Many compounds are difficult to generate by chemical or semi-synthesis, which limits the ability to optimize compounds by chemical derivatization.13,14 For example, the chemical synthesis of the aglycone of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin involves 19 chemical steps and is associated with several problems, notably the lack of kinetic atroposelectivity in the construction of the tricyclic scaffold, low overall yields, and the difficult synthesis of unnatural amino acids.15,16\nGenetic engineering methods are suitable alternatives for the targeted derivatization of complex natural products.17 These methods are based on the biotechnological manipulation of genes involved in antibiotic biosynthesis, which in bacterial antibiotic producers are usually organized in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).18 Mutasynthesis is a method of metabolic engineering that combines aspects of chemical synthesis with genetic engineering techniques (= mutational biosynthesis). The principle of mutasynthesis involves the genetic disruption of one or more gene(s) responsible for the biosynthesis of a key precursor, with subsequent supply of synthetic analogues of the missing precursor, designated as mutasynthons. The incorporation of a mutasynthon into the biosynthetic assembly line of the secondary metabolite then leads to the formation of novel compound derivatives (Fig. 1).19 In this way, mutasynthesis combines genetic manipulation with the principle of precursor-directed biosynthesis20 to exploit substrate promiscuity in the biosynthetic assembly lines of natural product producers.13 This can be used to modify complex natural products that are inaccessible or difficult to access by means of chemical synthesis.13,14,21 The advantage of mutasynthesis over precursor-directed biosynthesis is that by using a precursor block mutant, there is no competition between the natural precursor and the unnatural mutasynthon building block, resulting in the biosynthesis of the desired mutasynthesis product only. A prerequisite for this powerful technology is the knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway, especially that the respective precursor genes are known, the genetic tractability of the antibiotic producer strain, as well as that the mutasynthon is readily taken up by the cell and accepted by the biosynthetic machinery.19,22\u201324 Mutasynthesis has been successfully applied for the derivatization of various compound classes, such as polyketides,25\u201327 nonribosomal peptides28 glycopeptide antibiotics,14 aminoglycosides,29 alkaloids,30 aminocoumarins,31 or lincomycins.32 For example, regarding drug optimization, mutasynthesis has successfully been applied to generate derivatives of lincomycin, which showed increased activities against low-level lincosamide resistant staphylococci compared to the original compound.32 Another example includes a series of novel physostigmine alkaloids generated by mutasynthesis,\nwhere one of the modified compounds exhibited an improved selectivity and toxicity profile.30 Streptogramin antibiotics are a substance class that with pristinamycins (Synercids, Pyostacins) have found their way into clinical applications. Pristinamycins are used as an antibiotic of last resort to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.33 These antibiotics show good activities against numerous Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains (VREF). Despite the longstanding use of pristinamycin for more than 50 years, especially in French-speaking countries, the frequency of resistance remained low but has increased in recent years,33 which makes it necessary to optimize the substance in terms of broad-spectrum activity and resistance breaking characteristics, which can be achieved by derivatization of the compound by mutasynthesis. However, so far mutasynthesis has been prevented by the lack of information about precursor biosynthesis and its encoding genes. In particular, the genes coding for the biosynthesis of the non-proteinogenic amino acid L-phenyglycine (L-Phg), which is a constituent of the peptide antibiotic pristinamycin I (1), were not known until recently. L-Phg is essential for the bioactivity of streptogramin antibiotics, such as pristinamycin I (1) or its semi-synthetic derivative Synercids.34,35 Pristinamycin is a natural compound mixture produced by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis and consists of a mixture of two types of chemically unrelated substances \u2013 the macrocyclic polyketide/nonribosomal peptide hybrid compound pristinamycin II (= streptogramin group A (SA)) and the cyclic hexadepsipeptide pristinamycin I (1) (= streptogramin group B (SB)), the latter containing Phg as a structural component (Fig. 2).36 Pristinamycin I and II are co-produced by\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nS. pristinaespiralis in a synergistically active ratio of 30 : 70.36 Both compounds inhibit the bacterial protein biosynthesis by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, whereby pristinamycin II prevents the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA, while pristinamycin I (1) causes the dissociation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome.35 Each component alone exhibits moderate bacteriostatic activity, whereas in combination they act synergistically, resulting in a potent bactericidal activity.35 The synergistic mixture is used for clinical application, e.g. as Synercids, which is a combination of semi-synthetic derivatives of pristinamycin I (quinupristin (2), Fig. 3) and pristinamycin II (dalfopristin).35 Resistances against streptogramin antibiotics include, e.g. the active efflux of the antibiotics or the enzymatic inactivation of either of the two components.36 The most prevalent resistance mechanism against SB antibiotics is the N\n6 (di)methylation of a specific adenine nucleotide residue (A2058, Escherichia coli numbering) of the ribosomal 23S rRNA.37,38 This modification is mediated by Erm methyltransferases, encoded by plasmidborne erm genes, which leads to a drastic reduction of affinity for members of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) group of antibiotics.39 In S. pristinaespiralis, the SB antibiotic 1 is synthesized by the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) SnbA, SnbC, and SnbDE, whereby the latter one incorporates L-Phg as the final amino acid into the growing pristinamycin I peptide chain.36,40 L-Phg biosynthesis occurs through a series of enzymatic reactions, catalyzed by the enzymes phenylpyruvate dehydrogenase (PglB/PglC), Phg dehydrogenase (PglA), thioesterase (PglD), and aminotransferase (PglE), which convert phenylpyruvate\nto L-Phg.18,41,42 The genetic information for Phg biosynthesis is encoded on the S. pristinaespiralis pglA-E operon.41 So far, this is the first reported Phg biosynthetic pathway and has been identified in the frame of characterizing the pristinamycin biosynthetic gene cluster.40,41,43 Crystallographic analysis of a ribosome-bound streptogramin antibiotic revealed the formation of a hydrogen bond between the L-Phg carbonyl oxygen with nucleotide C2586 of the 23S rRNA (E. coli numbering) as part of the interactions involved in the binding of 1 to the ribosome.35 Additionally, the aromatic ring of Phg is involved in establishing hydrophobic interactions with the ribosome34 hinting at the functional importance of the amino acid for bioactivity.\nThe pristinamycin biosynthetic route is well-described and the producer strain S. pristinaespiralis is genetically tractable,40 making it strain a suitable chassis strain for a streptogramin mutasynthesis approach. In the current study, we report on a mutasynthesis approach for the derivatization of pristinamycin I (1) by targeting the Phg-like residue for modification to generate novel antibiotic derivatives."

Quinupristin (2), another clinically applied pristinamycin I derivative bearing an additional (R)-2-(quinuclidin-3ylthio)ethyl substituent at the 4-oxo-L-pipecolic acid moiety (Fig. 3A), has been co-crystallized with the ribosome of different species including E. coli and the two extremophiles Deinococcus radiodurans and Haloarcura marismortui.34,35,44 The structure analysis of these co-crystals reveals that quinupristin (2) binds the 23S rRNA of the bacterial large ribosomal subunit 50S at the entrance of the ribosomal tunnel through a network of hydrophobic interactions predominantly mediated and hydrogen bonds between the N6 nitrogen of the A2062 nucleotide (E. coli nomenclature in green) and the N4 nitrogen of the C2565 nucleotide (E. coli nomenclature in green) as outlined in\nFig. 3A34,35,44 with no direct contact to the ribosome protein backbone. Pristinamycin I (1) is believed to bind in a similar manner to the same binding pocket at 23S rRNA of the bacterial ribosomal 50S subunit. However, as no co-crystal structure of 1 with the bacterial ribosome is available, we have performed a virtual docking of pristinamycin I (1) into the binding pocket of quinupristin (2) at the ribosome based on the three available co-crystal structure with the ribosome of E. coli (PDB: 4U26), D. radiodurans (PDB: 1MS1), and H. marismortui (PBD: 1YJW)34,35,44 using the software SeeSAR (SeeSAR version 13.0.1; BioSolveIT GmbH, Sankt Augustin, Germany, 2023, www.biosolveit.de/ SeeSAR).

In the case of D. radiodurans (Fig. 3D, see PDB file 3D_D. radiodurans in ESI\u2020) already 2 is bound in a slightly different orientation compared to E. coli and H. marismortui, in particular, the 3-hydroxypipecolinic acid moiety is oriented to the opposite direction. The docked structure of 1 is then shifted by approximately 2.1 \u00c5 into the binding pocket of the 23S rRNA compared to 2. Presumably, this is a consequence of lacking the (R)-2-(quinuclidin-3-ylthio)ethyl substituent of 2 allowing 1 to enter deeper into the pocket. The Phg moiety of 1 points in all cases towards the inside of the 23S rRNA binding pocket. However, unoccupied space between the 23S rRNA nucleotides and the Phg moiety in all docking approaches encouraged us to virtually explore further possible Phg derivatives, which could be accessed through mutasynthesis via an in silico screening of 4-, 3- and 2-substituted Phg derivatives based on the docking of 1 into the binding pocket of E. coli. In general, smaller substituents in the 3- and 4-position seemed to be tolerated for binding to the target. Substitution in the 2-position of the Phg moiety mostly led to derivatives presumably not binding to the target structure anymore."

In S. pristinaespiralis, pglA is the first gene of the L-Phg biosynthesis encoding operon pglA-E and has been shown to be essential for pristinamycin I production.41 Inactivation of pglA in S. pristinaespiralis (MpglA) resulted in a loss of pristinamycin I production, whereas feeding MpglA with L-Phg restored pristinamycin I production, thus functionally complementing the pglA inactivation.41 The production of the SA antibiotic pristinamycin II is not affected in the MpglA mutant.41 To obtain an S. pristinaespiralis mutasynthesis strain that produces pristinamycin I derivatives exclusively, we aimed to abolish the biosynthesis of the pristinamycin II compound as well. This should allow for PI derivative production in an antibiotic-free background so that the mutasynthesis samples can be directly tested for bioactivity. For this purpose, the gene snaE1, encoding a hybrid PKS/NRPS enzyme essential for pristinamycin II biosynthesis45 was inactivated by insertion of a thiostrepton resistance cassette (thioR) using the mutational plasmid pK18-snaE1tsr, which resulted in the double mutant S. pristinaespiralis DpglADsnaE1 (Table S1, ESI\u2020).

Because of the comparatively stable and good antibiotic production behavior of the DpglADsnaE1 mutant when supplemented with 4-fluoro-L-Phg, and 4-chloro-DL-Phg, further efforts were focused on the isolation of the two halogenated pristinamycin I derivatives, which were referred to as 6-fluoropristinamycin I (3) and 6-chloropristinamycin I (4), respectively. Notably, feeding of D-Phg also led to the production of a pristinamycin I derivative as identified by HPLC-MS analysis, although the enantiomeric L-Phg is the natural precursor of pristinamycin I biosynthesis. Here, it remains unclear whether the adenylation domain of SnbE is able to accept D-Phg as a substrate or whether D-Phg was converted to L-Phg prior to incorporation. Since Phgs were solubilized by using sodium hydroxide prior to addition to the culture, chemical racemisation to D/L-Phg mixtures is quite possible. Though, polarimetric analysis of L- and D-Phg under alkaline conditions did not indicate racemisation (data not shown), which however does not exclude racemization in the organism. In a previous study, it has been described that the thioesterase domain of SnbDE can only accept L-Phg but not D-Phg,46 which makes incorporation of D-Phg in PI unlikely. Natural pristinamycin I (produced from S. pristinaespiralis DpglADsnaE1 supplemented with L-Phg) was used as a control and was referred to as C-PI. Production of 3 and 4 (for structure see Fig. 2) was confirmed using HPLC-MS/ MS analysis by comparing the fragmentation pattern of 1 with that of the respective halogenated derivatives (Fig. S1, ESI\u2020). Three prominent, reoccurring mass signals (m/z = 578.3, 663.3, and 839.4) were detected and assigned to fractions of the parental ion pristinamycin I (Fig. S1a, ESI\u2020). These fragments, which were determined to include the L-Phg residue in pristinamycin I, were shifted in masses corresponding to the addition of the respective halogen atom introduced (+34 for the chlorine main isotope, +18 for fluorine; shift is the mass of the atom 1 to account for the mass of the replaced hydrogen (Fig. S1b and c, respectively, ESI\u2020)), suggesting the incorporation of the respective halogenated\nmutasynthons at the expected position in pristinamycin I. In order to produce sufficient amounts of substance for the structural elucidation of 3 and 4 by NMR analysis, mutasynthesis was carried out on a large scale. In total, 12 l and 6 l cultures were extracted for 3 and 4 isolation, respectively. HPLC fractions were analyzed by HRESIMS analysis to confirm the presence of 3 and 4 (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI\u2020), respectively, whereby HRESIMS data of 1 served as a reference (Fig. S4, ESI\u2020). HPLC fractions containing 0.6 mg of 3 and 1.54 mg of 4, respectively, were subjected to NMR analysis (NMR data for 1, 3, and 4 are available in Table 2 and in ESI,\u2020 Fig. S5\u2013S21). As expected, the NMR data of 3 were highly similar to those of 1 (Table 2). However, the presence of two broad doublets (dH 7.24 and 7.37) in the\n1H NMR spectrum as part of the characteristic AA0BB0 system indicated the incorporation of the 4-chloro-Phg unit. In the 13C NMR spectrum of 4, the splitting of the signals C-4/C-8, C-5/C-7 and C-6 with coupling constants JC,F = 8.6 Hz, 21.5 Hz and 245 Hz, respectively, indicated the coupling to the fluorine atom. Furthermore, the single peak at dF = 113.4 ppm gave direct proof of fluorine incorporation (Table 2 and Fig. S22, ESI\u2020). The production rates of the PI derivatives were difficult to determine due to the inconsistent production behavior of the DpglADsnaE1 mutant. PI derivative concentrations were only measured for the pooled samples of C-PI, 3, and 4, which were produced in amounts of 1.52 mg mL 1, 1.55 mg mL 1, and 1.51 mg mL 1, respectively. Thus, the data indicate an incorporation of the unnatural derivatives at almost the same efficiency as the natural L-Phg precursor. Furthermore, the production of C-PI reached roughly half the amount produced by the wild-type strain (Fig. 4), which yielded an average of about 5 mg mL 1 of 1. Altogether, the lower PI derivative production yields are more likely due to the inconsistent production performance of the DpglADsnaE1 mutant strain, rather than that the acceptance of the halogenated derivatives is limiting."

Altogether, this showed that 3 and 4 have antimicrobial activities similar to that of the natural compound 1. Furthermore, MIC assays and cytotoxicity tests were performed with pure 4 as this compound was available in sufficient amounts (approx. 1 mg of the pure compound) to allow for additional bioactivity tests. MIC analysis was performed using a panel of standard test organisms, including yeast, fungi, Gramnegative bacteria, as well as B. subtilis, S. aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis as Gram-positive test bacteria. Here, the derivative 4 inhibited the growth of S. aureus at a concentration of 33.2 mg mL 1 and that of B. subtilis at a concentration of 4.2 mg mL 1, which were 16.7 mg mL 1 and 2.1 mg mL 1 for the pristinamycin I control, respectively (Table S2, ESI\u2020). Since the MIC values of 4 and 1 resided in a similar range, the generated derivative 4 is obviously similarly bioactive as the natural compound 1. Cytotoxicity assays were carried out with 4 and 1 against two standard human cell lines (KB3.1 and L929), respectively. As with the pristinamycin I (1) control, no effect on proliferation was observed for 4 (Table S3, ESI\u2020). Thus, altogether the 4 derivative shows an equal bioactivity pattern as the natural pristinamycin I (1). So far, this represents the only example of successful mutasynthesis of streptogramin antibiotics.\nIn a recent study from Walker and Clardy, 202149 on a machine learning bioinformatics approach to predict bioactivities from BGCs, it has been found that BGCs containing Phg encoding genes are explicitly associated with antibacterial activities. Unlike proteinogenic amino acids, Phg does not have a b-carbon, so it has fewer rotatable bonds than proteinogenic aromatic amino acids like e.g. phenylalanine. Therefore, Phgcontaining peptides should be more rigid, reducing the entropic cost for binding to a target.50 Thus overall, we predict to be Phgs a good target residue for derivatization to improve compound properties."

            "text": "To investigate the inhibitory effect of the pristinamycin I derivatives on protein biosynthesis as an antibiotic target, in vitro transcription/translation assays were performed using semi-purified pristinamycin I derivatives 3 and 4 and respective control samples (pristinamycin I (1) and II). Assays were carried out and evaluated as reported before.51 Based on previous studies, ivTT fluorescence values of 0\u201320% indicate strong inhibition of the assay, 0\u201340% are considered to represent specific inhibition, whereas values above 40% do not indicate inhibition of the ivTT assay. In ivTT assays with pristinamycin derivatives, it was found that pristinamycin II resulted in strong inhibition of the ivTT assay, whereas neither pristinamycin I (1) nor the halogenated pristinamycin I derivatives 3 and 4 led to an inhibition (Fig. S23, ESI\u2020). This might be explained by the insufficiency of the ivTT assay to sense streptogramin B-mediated protein synthesis inhibition as it has been reported previously that translational inhibition was also not detected in cell-free assays for streptogramin B antibiotics, such as virginiamycin S, quinupristin (2) or pristinamycin I (1).52\u201354\n2.6 Extended mutasynthesis with E. coli-derived mutasynthons\nTo generally extent the possibility of accessing further, potentially not commercially available Phg derivatives, we established an E. coli BL21(DE3) whole cell biotransformation route from halogenated phenylalanines as precursors to produce Phg derivatives (Fig. S3, ESI\u2020). We have demonstrated in a previous study that E. coli BL21(DE3) is a suitable microorganism to transform L-phenylalanine derivatives to the corresponding mandelic acid by using a heterologously expressed hydroxymandelate synthase gene hmaS from A. mediterranei.55 To expand the production platform to Phg, we further expressed the genes for mandelate oxidase (hmo) from S. coelicolor and leucine dehydrogenase (bcd) from B. thuringensis in a second E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. To overcome a NADH cofactor limitation, the glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) was additionally expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). To test the substrate spectrum of the Hmo-LeuDH-GDH cascade, a variety of halogenated mandelic acid derivatives were tested. Fluorinated Phgs were detected in the supernatant with a high enantiomeric excess of more than 95%, while chlorinated Phgs were detected with a lower enantiomeric excess of 50% for 2-chloro-L-Phg (Table S4, ESI\u2020).\nMutasynthesis is usually carried out with chemically pure mutasynthons as building blocks that are supplied to the respective biosynthesis mutant. In order to establish a completely fermentative biosynthetic route from the production of the mutasynthon to the final mutasynthesis end product, we developed a mixed mutasynthesis set-up, involving samples from the E. coli biotransformation approach that were fed to S. pristinaespiralis DpglADsnaE1 as pristinamycin I mutasynthesis strain. This should allow for a direct incorporation of noncommercially available mutasynthons and in principle also provide a more sustainable production route for drug derivatization. To test for the feasibility of such an approach, 100 mL of\nFig. 5 Diameter of inhibition zones caused by pristinamycin I derivatives.

LC-MS analysis of crude extracts from DpglADsnaE1 fed with 4-fluoro-Phg biotransformation supernatant samples led to mass signals characteristic of 6-fluoro-PI (Fig. S24, ESI\u2020). Thus, 4-fluoroPhg from E. coli supernatant samples was successfully incorporated into pristinamycin I, which proved the feasibility of the adapted mutasynthesis procedure. Thereby, the pristinamycin derivative production rates were comparable to those when supplemented with commercially available mutasynthons (Fig. S24A\u2013F, ESI\u2020). This shows that the biotransformationbased mutasynthesis approach is comparably efficient to conventional mutasynthesis.

Substance derivatization is difficult to implement chemically due to the structural complex nature structure of the streptogramin molecule(s). So far, the mutasynthesis of streptogramin antibiotics has been prevented by the lack of knowledge on precursor biosynthesis and the encoded genes. In this study, we present the first successful mutasynthesis approach for the derivatization of the streptogramin antibiotic pristinamycin I (1) based on a modification of the Phg residue. Two halogenated pristinamycin I derivatives, 6-chloropristinamycin I (3) and 6- fluoropristinamycin I (4), were generated by mutasynthesis, their chemical structures were confirmed by NMR and the bioactivity of both substances was demonstrated with antibacterial bioassays. The pristinamycin I mutasynthesis approach was extended by a biotransformation process using a genetically modified E. coli strain as a Phg mutasynthon producer, which provided Phg derivatives that were directly fed to the mutasynthesis strain. This mutasynthesis 2.0 process represents a novel extension of the original mutasynthesis method and the feasibility of the process has been demonstrated by the successful production of 46-fluoropristinamycin I (4)."

A whole cell biotransformation route with resting cells was established by heterologous expression of the genes encoding hydroxymandelate synthase (hms) from Amycolatopsis mediterranei, mandelate oxidase (hmo) from S. coelicolor, leucine dehydrogenase (bcd) from Bacillus thuringensis, and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) from B. megaterium in E. coli BL21(DE3). The construction of the plasmids used is described in Protocol S3. For the formation of cells used for whole cell biotransformation, production of Hms was done as described before.55 Coproduction of the Hmo, Bcd and Gdh was performed in 2 L shaking flasks containing 400 mL of LB medium (kanamycin (50 mg mL 1) and chloramphenicol (30 mg mL 1).
