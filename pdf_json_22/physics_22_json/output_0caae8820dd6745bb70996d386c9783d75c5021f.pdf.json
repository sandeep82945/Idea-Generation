In our own Milky Way Galaxy, young masive clusters, characterized by masses 10 4 M (Portegies Zwart, cMillan & Gieles 2010 ) and usually small age spreads ( \u223cMyr) Longmore et al. 2014 ), appear to be rare, with only a few examples way from the Galactic Centre (Joshi et al. 2016 ). Most ongoing sites f star formation appear to be lower mass, likely open clusters or arger more dispersed associations. For example, in Portegies Zwart t al. ( 2010 ), eight clusters are shown as lying in the parameter space f YMCs (Fig. 2 ) compared to tens of open clusters with masses up o a few 1000 M . For external galaxies, studies of clusters, e.g. mass nd age functions, are often limited to 5000 M (e.g. Bastian et al. 012 ; Chandar et al. 2014 ; Mulia, Chandar & Whitmore 2016 ; Messa t al. 2018 ; Krumholz, McKee & Bland-Hawthorn 2019 ), except for ocal Group galaxies (e.g. Johnson et al. 2017 ).

Elmegreen & Clemens ( 1985 ) roposed that such associations, rather than bound clusters, could rise in low-mass clouds, or smaller quiescent regions of higher mass louds. Following Lada & Lada ( 2003 ), associations were supposed o be remnants of bound clusters, following gas expulsion, stellar volution, and/or N -body interactions (Bastian & Goodwin 2006 ; astian et al. 2008 ; Pfalzner & Kaczmarek 2013 ). Ho we ver, recent inematic studies of associations suggest that there is no simple icture of expansion (Wright et al. 2016 ; Ma \u0301\u0131z Apell \u0301aniz et al. 2020 ; elnik & Dambis 2020 ; Ward, Kruijssen & Rix 2020 ). Rather, the tructure of associations is set by the structure of the gas when they re formed (Gouliermis 2018 ; Ward & Kruijssen 2018 ; Wright & amajek 2018 ; Lim et al. 2019 ). Simulations to trace back currently bserved associations suggest that they originate from subvirial and ighly structured initial conditions (Farias et al. 2018 ; Schoettler t al. 2019 ).\nNumerical simulations of galaxies have generally tended to follow igher mass clusters rather than smaller clusters or associations. gain, this is a consequence of resolution, and the time the clusters re evolved for. On galaxy scales, it is difficult to fully resolve lusters.

Hislop et al. 2022 ) find that at higher star formation rates, some clusters disperse, lthough they are not able to form realistic clusters < 1000 M .\nOn smaller scales, Grudi \u0301c et al. ( 2021 ) perform simulations of solated, massive, bound, turbulent GMCs, and find that they typically volve to form a large number of small bound clusters that reside in larger association, along with many unbound stars. Fukushima & ajima ( 2021 ) find that unless the star formation efficiency is high, ndividual clusters tend to disperse. Ionizing feedback leads to less ense clusters at lower surface densities, but has little effect at high urface densities where globular clusters or YMCs are likely to form Fukushima & Yajima 2022 ).\nIsolated cloud simulations, ho we v er, may miss e xternal gas dyamics, such as continuing gas inflow that may continue to produce tar formation. Bending, Dobbs & Bate ( 2020 ) found that ionizing adiation propagating into the surrounding medium can also trigger urther star formation. Furthermore, even on molecular cloud scales, t is difficult to resolve stars fully down to brown dwarfs, limiting he total mass of such simulations to around 10 4 M . Simulations on olecular cloud scales also do not necessarily have the capacity to ollow the clusters for long enough to see whether they would likely tay as open clusters, or disperse (e.g. Bate, Bonnell & Bromm 2003 ; onnell, Bate & Vine 2003 ). Simulations can take into account of surrounding gas by resimuating, or zooming in on small sections of whole galaxy simulations Van Loo, Butler & Tan 2013 ; Smilgys & Bonnell 2017 ; Bending t al. 2020 ; Smith et al. 2020 ; Ali 2021 ; Dobbs et al. 2022 ; Rieder t al. 2022 ). Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ) sho wed that colliding flo ws on larger cales are significant in determining the final cluster mass, partly ecause they lead to more mergers between clusters. Generally, imulations show that at least for the formation of more massive lusters, cluster formation is hierarchical and mergers are frequent Bonnell et al. 2003 ; Fujii & Portegies Zwart 2015 ; Smilgys & onnell 2017 ; Fujii et al. 2021 ; Dobbs et al. 2022 ; Guszejnov et al. 022 ). To fully model clusters, one possibility for cosmological or alactic simulations is to include the cluster evolution separately sing a theoretical or empirical model (Pfeffer et al. 2018 ) or by eparately evolving a sample of clusters (Grudi \u0301c et al. 2022 ). An lternative approach is to model the full population of stars with N - ody dynamics (Fujii et al. 2021 ; Liow et al. 2022 ; Rieder et al. 2022 ), ven if the gas resolution is low, thus achieving the same resolution n the stars as individual cluster simulations. This has the advantage hat the cluster dynamics can be followed e xplicitly. Howev er, the esolution of the stellar component would still be limiting on larger alaxy scales as modelled for longer periods of time.\nIn this paper, we simulate cluster formation and evolution in piral arm regions, taken from global spiral galaxy simulations, ith photoionizing and supernova feedback. We simply include sink articles when star formation occurs, so are unable to resolve the ull stellar population and dynamics, but we do follow the clusters ather than including any subgrid description of cluster evolution.\ne look at the effect of feedback on the star formation rate for he different regions, which are characterized by different masses Section 3.2 ). We compare the evolution of clusters as determined by nding clusters at each time frame (Section 3.3.2 ) and by following onstituent cluster sink particles (Section 3.3.4 ). We compare cluster roperties with and without feedback (Section 3.3.3 ) and also ompare the outcomes of our models to known OB associations Section 3.3.5 ). In Section 3.4 , we examine the impact of including uperno vae v ersus ionization only.\nNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nM E T H O D\nn Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), we performed simulations of two sections of a ilky Way-like spiral galaxy from Pettitt et al. ( 2015 ). In that paper, e denoted these sections as Regions 1 and 2, where Region 1 exibited strongly converging flows. We concluded that the velocities, nd gas densities, in particular for Region 1 of those simulations epresented the most extreme environment from the initial galaxycale simulation and so resulted in very massive clusters. Even in our econd re gion, Re gion 2, the gas densities were still high compared o typical Milky Way densities. In this paper, we extend the work f Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), by rerunning the regions presented in the revious work but with lower initial gas masses. Otherwise, we eep the physics included in the simulations exactly the same as n previous work, so the only parameter that is varied is the gas mass.\ne could have rerun the original galaxy simulations with a lower gas ass, ho we ver, as well as a v oiding running multiple whole galaxy imulations, the approach here also allows us to compare simulations here the initial conditions still reflect large-scale processes such as piral arms but are the same except for the initial densities. Rerunning he whole galaxy would likely substantiate the conclusions from our ifferent density runs, as for example the gas would likely also be less oncentrated in the mid-plane, with less cold gas, further increasing he difference between lower and higher density models.\n.1 Details of simulations\nhe physics included in the simulations is essentially the same as obbs et al. ( 2022 ), except for the inclusion of supernovae, but we\nnclude a summary of the previous methods here as well. We use the moothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code sphNG to carry out ur simulations. The code is based on an original version by Benz t al. ( 1990 ), but has since been substantially modified to include ink particles, cooling and heating, and stellar feedback. We model he whole stellar disc of the galaxy using star particles, but only nclude gas particles in the regions we select. The halo of the galaxy s represented by an NFW potential (Navarro, Frenk & White 1997 ). or the gas we include self-gravity, and heating, cooling, H 2 and CO hemistry according to Dobbs et al. ( 2008 ), originally from Glo v er & ac Low ( 2007 ). Sink particles are inserted once gas reaches a ertain density, and the gas is converging and bound according to ate, Bonnell & Price ( 1995 ). We use the same sink criteria and arameters as the Set 2 (highest resolution) simulations from Dobbs t al. ( 2022 ). Sinks are created for densities > 1000 cm \u22123 if they meet he abo v e criteria, but similarly to Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), we enforce ink creation if densities reach 10 5 cm \u22123 . The sink radius is set to .1 pc, the merger radius is 0.001 pc. Sink masses can be of order 0 M in our lowest mass simulation, thus potentially representing a ingle very massive star, but more likely a number of low-mass stars. n our highest mass simulations (i.e. M25R1, M25R1FB, M25R2, nd M25R2FB shown in Dobbs et al. 2022 ), the sinks typically epresent 100\u2019s of solar masses and therefore sample a full IMF of tars.\n.1.1 Stellar feedback\nnce sinks are formed, they are allocated a population of stars ccording to a Kroupa (Kroupa 2001 ) initial mass function (IMF). tars abo v e a giv en mass are treated as ionizing sources. The hotoionization scheme for our models is the same as described n Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ) and Bending et al. ( 2020 ).

Column densities re computed by summing o v er all particles whose smoothing length v erlaps with the line of sight. Specifically, the ionization fraction is volved as d H II d t = h 2 r 2 ( Q H 4 \u03c0 \u2212 \u222b r 0 r \u2032 2 n ( r \u2032 ) 2 \u03b1B d r \u2032 \u2212 1 \u03b4t \u222b r 0 r \u2032 2 n ( r \u2032 )[1 \u2212 H II ( r \u2032 )]d r \u2032 ) , (1) here h is the smoothing length, Q H is the ionizing flux, n is the umber density, \u03b1B is the recombination efficiency (here 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u221213 m 3 s \u22121 ), \u03b4t is the time interval, and H II is the ionization fraction of he gas (from 0 to 1). Gas that is ionized is heated to a temperature f 10 4 K. As in Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), the ionization is only calculated o a certain distance, to save computational time, and the same as or Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), this distance is roughly half the size of the imulated region. As in Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), we use an efficiency f 50 per cent such that half the mass of sinks is converted to stars, hich correspondingly sets the number of massive stars undergoing eedback. Unlike Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), we include this efficiency when orking out stellar and cluster masses; this efficiency reflects that ot all gas will be turned into stars on the scales we model, and eans that when we compare the masses of clusters with how many assive stars they contain this will be consistent. Ho we ver, there is n inconsistency in that 50 per cent of gas should ideally be returned o the ISM, but it is retained in sink particles. In addition to ionization, we also include superno vae. Superno vae re inserted the same way as described in Bending, Dobbs & Bate 2022 ), which is similar in turn to Dobbs, Burkert & Pringle ( 2011 ).\ne insert supernovae for stars > 18 M . For each star > 18 M , we etermine the star\u2019s lifetime using the SEBA programme (Portegies wart & Verbunt 2012 ; Toonen, Nelemans & Portegies Zwart 2012 ). nce stars reach the end of their lifetimes, they are assumed to nder go supernovae. The ener gy of the supernovae is inserted as oth kinetic and thermal energy and follows a snowplough solution. upernovae do not occur until late on in our simulations, and some imulations do not reach the point where supernovae occur. The time f the first supernova, and the total evolution time for the simulations re shown in Table 1 . Winds are not included, ho we ver we found n Ali, Bending & Dobbs ( 2022 ) that winds have little effect in our imulations.\nWe note that in our sampling and feedback prescription, sinks may xhibit masses that are much less than that required to resolve the\nMF. Ho we ver as described in Bending et al. ( 2020 ), we pre-sample he stellar masses, similar to Geen et al. ( 2018 ), and use the total\nass of the simulation to assign stars of a given mass to sink particles according also to the size of the sink particles). As such the IMF is ampled from the collective mass, which does sample the IMF. Liow t al. ( 2022 ) propose a method whereby sinks are grouped together o assign stars, which we do not use here; our method is more similar o the \u2018All grouped\u2019 method in their paper, which well reproduces he IMF.\n.1.2 Initial conditions\ne take our initial conditions from Pettitt et al. ( 2015 ) as described in obbs et al. ( 2022 ). In the latter paper, we performed two successive esimulations of regions in the galaxy such that we obtained a esolution suitable to resolve clusters. We selected two regions, ne associated with two merging or joining spiral arms where the ensities and conv erging v elocities are high (Region 1) and another rom simply a typical region along a spiral arm (Region 2) with oderate converging velocities. For both these regions, the gas ensities were fairly high and massive clusters were formed. Here, e run simulations with lower gas densities for comparison. We un a model of each Region, with 5 x lower gas mass, and we also un a further model of Region 1 with 25 times lower gas mass. We ist these different simulations in Table 1 . The models M25R1FB,\n25R1, M25R2FB, and M25R2 are those presented in Dobbs et al. 2022 ), while the other six simulations (which we primarily focus n) are presented here for the first time. The initial conditions for the new Region 2 simulations (M5R2 and 5R2FB) are exactly the same as those used in Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), o we can compare these directly with M25R2FB and M25R2. For the egion 1 simulations, the initial conditions from Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ) lready contained sink particles, so we re-ran the first resimulation denoted R1z85sI in Dobbs et al. 2022 ) with five times lower mass, nd used these as initial conditions for the Region 1 simulations resented here (M1R1, M1R1FB, M5R1, M5R1FB). Unlike Dobbs t al. ( 2022 ), the initial conditions for the Region 1 simulations resented here contain no initial sink particles. All the new Region 1 imulations here start with the same initial conditions, except that he particle masses differ. The initial conditions will be slightly ifferent from M25R1 and M25R1FB, but we only use these previous imulations for Region 1 to compare the star formation rates, the rest f the analysis does not involve those simulations. In all simulations, e include 1.1 million particles to model the stellar disc. The initial\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nM\nFigure 1.

The mass of the particles is .1 M in the models, where we decrease the mass by a factor of (M5R1, M5R1FB, M5R2, and M5R2FB), and 0.02 M in M1R1 nd M1R1FB. In Fig. 1 , we indicate where our simulations would lie in a plot f surface density versus mass, which is a simplified version of the gure shown in Tan, Shaske & Van Loo ( 2013 ). We only used the imulations with feedback for this figure. The filled panels show the ange of gas surface densities in the simulations, calculated at times id-way through when stars are forming and there is still dense gas in he vicinity of the clusters. The width in the x- direction is simply one rder of magnitude width up to the total gas mass in the simulation. he dashed box regions show the typical range of cluster masses and urface densities. As indicated by Fig. 1 , our high-mass simulation 25R2FB encompasses massive clusters in the LMC, Milky Way nd M82, such as R136 and Quintuplet. The lowest mass simulation M1R1FB) lies in the same regime as the ONC, and lower mass lusters indicated by the SF clumps. RESULTS .1 Evolution of models\ne show the evolution of the Region 1 simulations in Fig. 2 , the owest gas mass (M1R1 and M1R1FB) simulations are presented in he top panels and the moderate gas mass simulations (M5R1 and\n5R1FB) in the lower panels. In each case, the model with feedback ncluded is shown on the top. For both, we see that feedback has a ignificant effect on both the gas and the distribution of stars. For xample if we look at the middle ( t = 4 Myr) panels for the low gas ass simulations, with feedback included we see large regions that re relatively devoid of gas, while the remaining gas is arranged into airly dense, sharp features. By contrast without feedback, the gas\nNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\ns more uniformly distributed. At first glance, the ionization appears o have a greater effect in the lowest mass simulation. However if e compare at an equi v alent time, e.g. the 4 Myr panels, with the ow mass (top panels) the ionization produces regions devoid of very ow gas density, whereas at the medium mass (lower panels), the onization is producing large amounts of low density diffuse gas, ut in both cases the ionization is having a strong effect on the gas orphology. In the low gas mass model, by 7 Myr, ionization has argely emptied the regions around the clusters of gas. Gas is present urther away, so the rest of the evolution of the cluster is largely due o the N -body dynamics of the sinks.\nThe main difference we see in the stars is that the clusters appear arger (i.e. o v er a larger size scale) and more dispersed in the models ith feedback compared to those without. Particularly with the edium gas mass models, the clusters co v er a larger area. We also ee for the low-gas models (top panels) that at 7 Myr, there are around our apparent groups of stars that are quite dispersed, whereas in the o feedback case we see three or possibly four very concentrated mall clusters.\nIn Fig. 3 , we sho w the e volution of the Region 2 simulations, howing the medium gas mass runs (M5R2 and M5R2FB) and he high-gas mass models (M25R2 and M25R2FB), again both are efore supernovae occur. Again we see that the clusters are spatially uch more extended with feedback. We also see the impact of the onization, producing very low density regions in the medium mass odels (top) and creating large amounts of diffuse gas in the highass models. We also see a difference between the medium- and igh-gas mass runs. At 2.5 Myr for the medium gas mass case, there re separate clear filaments in which clusters are forming. At 4.5 Myr, hese separate filaments and clusters are still apparent. Ho we ver in he high-mass models (M25R2 and M25R2FB), these filaments have\nore or less merged into one single structure. So in the higher mass odel, the gravity from the higher gas mass, as well as the initial gas\nelocities, is producing a different morphology and clusters that are patially closer together and that are likely in the process of merging ogether.\n.2 Star formation rates\ne show the mass of stars formed versus time for the different odels in Fig. 4 with and without feedback. In all cases, feedback educes the mass of stars formed. We also see that the mass of tars forming slows down with time. In the lowest mass model with eedback, M1R1FB, star formation has largely ceased by around Myr, though in the other models star formation is ongoing. We see hat while star formation ceases in model M1R1FB, star formation ontinues throughout the duration of the equi v alent model with no eedback, M1R1. This is because in the model with feedback, gas as been mostly dispersed by 7 Myr and is low density, whereas ithout feedback, there is still quite a lot of dense gas in and around he central clusters. Consequently after 20 Myr, the mass of stars ormed in the model with feedback is around half that of the model ithout feedback. The reduction in mass with feedback included s lower in the other models; however, these run for shorter times. f we compare at the same time (e.g. 5 Myr), then the difference ith and without feedback is fairly similar for all the models. This uggests that the main difference with the models is the time-scales v er which star formation occurs. For the higher mass models, star ormation occurs o v er relativ ely short periods before ionization has uch effect. While for the low-mass models, there is opportunity or massive stars to form and significantly ionize the surrounding as before further star formation occurs. Similarly to the results in\nFigure 2. The evolution of the low-mass (top panels) and medium-mass (lower panels) Region 1 simulations are shown with and without feedback. With feedback, the photoionization is clearly producing emptier regions, and diffuse gas, and also larger more widely dispersed clusters.\nF a s\na i e t s f s g\n( t s\n3\n3\nI o a c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nigs 2 and 3 , the ionization is having a similar impact in the models t different times, but for the high-mass models, large amounts of tar formation has already occurred by later times.\nWe further compare the reduction in the mass of stars formed with nd without feedback in Fig. 5 , where we plot the mass of stars n the model with feedback divided by the mass of the stars in the qui v alent model without feedback, versus time. This figure supports he impression from Fig. 4 that the addition of feedback does not ignificantly differ between the different models at a given time rame, although for the low-mass models, feedback has an impact traight after star formation, possibly having a larger effect on dense as around new sink particles compared to in the higher mass cases\nin the M5R2FB model the ionization is actually having a slight net riggering effect at early times, though there has been relatively little tar formation at this point).\n.3 Stellar clusters\n.3.1 Clusters, OB associations, and the approach used here\nn the next sections, we look at the evolution of clusters based n (i) identifying clusters at different time frames (Section 3.3.2 ), nd (ii) identifying clusters at one time frame and following the onstituent sink particles o v er time (Section 3.3.4 ). For (i), we refer\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nFigure 3. The evolution of the medium-mass (top panels) and high-mass (lower panels) Region 2 simulations are shown with and without feedback. Again photoionization is dispersing gas or leading to diffuse gas around the clusters, and leading to more spread out clusters with larger radii.\nFigure 4. The mass of stars formed is shown versus time for all the different simulations. In all cases, photoionization reduces the amount of stars formed, more so in the lowest mass model, M1R1FB. The red dashed part indicates evolution from a larger scale simulation for that particular cluster, as described in Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ).\nFigure 5. In this figure, we plot the ratio of the mass of stars formed in each model with feedback, divided by the mass of stars formed without feedback at the equi v alent time. For clarity, only part of the whole time-scale from Fig. 4 is shown.\nt p t c o e n\nf t a s Z O W o l S r (\n3\nO b s a c u c s s t F a b f S T\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\no these simply as clusters. For (ii), we identify objects where the sink articles stay clustered together and where they disperse, grouping hese into clusters which remain or which disperse. For identifying lusters, we simply use a clustering algorithm, as typically used by bservers (e.g. Conrad et al. 2017 ; Liu & Pang 2019 ; Castro-Ginard t al. 2020 , 2022 ; Hunt & Reffert 2021 ). As such the clusters do not ecessarily need to be gravitationally bound. OB associations are groups of stars that are thought to originate rom the same star formation event but are spread out on the sky. In heir re vie w, Wright et al. ( 2022 ) suggest that densities of Galactic OB ssociations are typically 0.001 \u22120.1 M pc \u22123 , based on their typical izes and masses. Although the OB associations listed in Portegies wart et al. ( 2010 ) tend to be fairly compact, other authors identify B associations as spatially larger. The Galactic OB associations in right ( 2020 ) can be 100 pc or more in size, and within them contain pen clusters or smaller OB associations, while OB associations isted in external galaxies are typically \u223c80 pc (e.g. Elmegreen & alzer 1999 ). We simply compare the properties of our star-forming egions with characteristics of Galactic OB associations using Wright 2020 ) as a basis (Section 3.3.5 ). .3.2 Evolution of clusters\nur friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm is similar to the densityased clustering algorithm DBSCAN (Ester et al. 1996 ) but slightly impler and easier to automate. Sinks are selected that are within given distance of each other and are assigned into groups. We hoose a distance of 2 pc, which is larger than the value of 0.5 pc sed in Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), for a few reasons. First, this identified lusters that would be picked out by eye across the different data ets. Secondly, when following the clusters o v er time their relative ize, shape, positions, and memberships are liable to changes while he number of sinks unassociated with clusters increases (see e.g. ig. 2 ). With this distance the algorithm is able to correctly identify cluster at an earlier time and then find the same cluster (as would e picked out by eye) at later times, after the changes. Thirdly, we ound that 2 pc was reasonable using the approach of Rahmah & itanggang ( 2016 ) to find the optimal distance scale of a data set. heir approach works by calculating the distance from every star to\nFigur e 6. Cluster mer ger trees are shown for the different models, with time going from left to right. The size of the points scales with the log of the mass. Each final cluster, whether at the last time shown or earlier, has an individual colour. In some cases there is a choice of colours when clusters split, this is just made randomly.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nM\ni l i o t fi i\nH i d d o i o f F d n a s a\ns r p ( e e e t d a a w\nt\na\nt\nf\nt\nm c s m b t A b l a a s b\nm n T A p t t\nFigure 7.

Plotting order number versus distance, the scale s defined as the distance at which the maximum change in gradient f the slope occurs (see also Buckner et al. 2022 ). We checked he results of our algorithm with those obtained using DBSCAN, nding them to be very similar and often the clusters identified are dentical. When deciding the best algorithm to use we also considered\nDBSCAN (Campello, Moulavi & Sander 2013 ), a hierarchical mplementation of DBSCAN better at finding clusters in varying ensity data sets. Unlike the original implementation, HDBSCAN oes not require the user to specify a distance scale for a data set, nly the minimum cluster size (number of members). We found t produced clusters that agreed well with what would be picked ut by eye, but as the optimum minimum cluster size needed to be ound for each data set it was not ideal for our intended purpose. urthermore in some instances additional settings (e.g. a minimum istance between clusters for them to be considered separate) were eeded to produce sensible results, eliminating the advantage of the lgorithm that it does not require user-defined distance scales. As uch, we decided against using HDBSCAN in fa v our of our FoF lgorithm.\nTo be considered a cluster by our FoF algorithm, we required patial groupings to have more than 10 sink particles, although we educed this to 7 for the M1R1 run because there were so few sink articles in this model. In all models, the number of sinks was larger but their mass smaller) in the models with feedback. We show the volution of the clusters as cluster merger trees (see also Guszejnov t al. 2022 ), similar to galaxy merger trees, in Fig. 6 . We follow the volution of clusters o v er time, by running our algorithm at different ime frames, and identifying which particles lie in the clusters at ifferent times (as seen in the appendix, the clusters\u2019 evolution lso makes sense by eye). In Section 3.3.4 , we take an alternative pproach, where we take clusters at a particular time, and follow hat happens to the constituent sink particles o v er time.\nFig. 6 shows that mergers and splitting of clusters (as denoted by he clustering algorithm picking up multiple versus single clusters t adjacent times) is commonplace in all models. There is also a endency for more mergers and splits to occur in the models with eedback. As shown in Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), the massive clusters tend o form via the merger of a number of smaller clusters. The lower\nass clusters, unless they have recently split from more massive lusters, tend to be clusters that have formed with a lower mass and tayed low mass for the duration of the simulation. There are more ergers in the simulations with higher gas masses, here gravity will e stronger and driving additional mergers, as well as promoting he formation of more clusters. As indicated by the figures in ppendix A , clusters are not spherically symmetric (though they ecome more so with time), and sinks in the outer parts can be more oosely associated and may be unbound from the rest of the cluster nd later split. Groups of stars that are not bound to the cluster could rise because they are spatially coincident but not bound. Either they imply form close to the cluster, or dynamically come close together, ut are not bound.\nThe end cluster masses (at least for the more massive clusters) ostly tend to be similar with and without feedback, which is perhaps\not surprising when the total stellar masses are more similar (Fig. 6 ). he exception is the lowest gas mass models, M1R1FB and M1R1. t the end point shown in Fig. 6 , the model without feedback, M1R1 roduces a cluster which is an order of magnitude more massive han any of the clusters which occur with feedback. We also see hat typically there are more clusters in the model with feedback,\nNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nnd for example after 15 Myr, with no feedback there is only one luster compared to typically three with feedback. Even allowing for he caveat that the sink particle numbers are different, by eye there ppear to be more clusters in the model with feedback at later times, hereas in the model with no feedback, the sinks all merge into the luster seen at x = 3.95 and y = 4.315 in Fig. 2 at the 7 Myr time see also Figs A1 and A2 in the Appendix). Even though at earlier imes in model M1R1FB, there is a more massive cluster, this is fairly symmetric, and at least at 5 and 6 Myr it is bipartite, and simply plits apart by 7 Myr.\nSome clusters cannot be followed to the final time, sometimes hese are ones that occur as a result of a split and disperse. In ddition, in some of the no feedback models, the number of particles n the clusters is low that artificially leads to cluster dispersal (see ection 3.3.4 ). Whether stars form in clusters or not has been the subject of onsiderable debate (Bressert et al. 2010 ; Ward & Kruijssen 2018 ; ard et al. 2020 ; Grudi \u0301c et al. 2021 ). In Fig. 7 , we show the fraction f stars, by mass, which lie in clusters with time for each model. All how a decreasing fraction of stars with time. The high fractions at arly times suggest that stars do tend to form in clusters, but due to he dynamics, many are ejected. Some are only loosely associated ith the cluster and simply not picked up by the nearest neighbour lgorithm at later times. The low-mass models are the only models hat run to longer time-scales. In these cases, the model with feedback M1R1FB) stays around 20 per cent up to 40 Myr (the model with o feedback is higher at \u223c 30 per cent ). This is not dissimilar to he fiducial simulation of Grudi \u0301c et al. ( 2021 ), where the fraction is 0 per cent, though there they see a wide range of fractions of stars n bound clusters for their models.\n.3.3 Cluster properties\nn Fig. 8 , we show the masses and radii of clusters formed in all he simulations except M25R1 and M25R1FB. We use the half mass adius, as observers use; in Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), we did not use the alf mass radius as there were too few stars, but the larger spatial cale for our clustering algorithm here is probably a better choice nd means that taking the half mass radius here is more practical. 1\nT f a T (\nm t c s f a t W w S o d w s\nt c\nR\nF\nR\ni w\nR\nFigure 9.

Most clusters exhibit evolution from lower left to top right, but some just increase in radius (including the black line, the only cluster from the low-mass simulation M1R1FB shown), and the cluster shown in green decreases in mass and radius due to splitting. Spikes tend to indicate when clusters merge or split and take 2 or 3 time increments to settle.\ns w T a f n w\nw w t h t t m m T t f c i t\nr b W o s O b b t s m a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nhe clusters are taken from the end points of the simulations except or the low-mass simulations, where we take a time of 9 Myr, and re o v erplotted on observ ed clusters from Brown & Gnedin ( 2021 ). he observed clusters are taken from a sample of nearby galaxies LEGUS). Fig. 8 shows that the clusters from the simulations with feedback atch the observations much better than without feedback. We see hat without feedback, the cluster radii are on average too small ompared to the observed clusters. Fig. 8 confirms what we could ee by eye in Figs 2 and 3 , that the clusters are larger in size with eedback. This increase of radius with feedback is expected, since s gas is dispersed away from the cluster, the potential changes, and he cluster will then expand (Geyer & Burkert 2001 ; Pfalzner 2011 ). e see significant expulsion of gas from comparing the gas mass ithin the vicinity of the cluster with and without feedback (see ection 3.3.6 ). We also examined whether the velocity dispersion f the stars contributed to expansion, but there was not a significant ifference with and without feedback. We compared radii of clusters ith and without feedback at different times, and found that they tart to diverge when clusters were around 1\u20131.5 Myr old. We also see that there is a slight tendency for higher mass clusters o have larger radii. Brown & Gnedin ( 2021 ) find that the radii of the lusters o v er their full sample vary with the mass according to = 2 . 55 ( M 10 4 )0 . 24 . (2)\nor our models with feedback, we find a relation of\n= 2 . 26 ( M\n10 4\n)0 . 27 , (3)\nn excellent agreement with the data. By contrast, without feedback, e find a relation of\n= 1 . 09 ( M\n10 4\n)0 . 085 . (4)\nCompared to the observations, the simulated clusters still have a lightly larger spread than the observations in mass and radii, even ith the better matching clusters from the simulations with feedback. he higher masses could reflect that probably the star formation rates re high as in reality there w ould lik ely be a lower efficiency for star ormation when we form sink particles. The observations are also ot complete, particularly at lower masses and radii. Consequently, e cannot compare the relative numbers of different mass clusters. In Fig. 9 , we take 10 clusters from the different simulations that\ne are able to follow for a significant fraction of the simulation (and hose evolution is independent from each other, so for example not he result of splitting from another cluster which is shown), and show ow their mass and radius evolv es o v er time. All clusters are from he simulations with feedback. Taking clusters where we can follow he evolution biases us more towards clusters which end up relatively\nassiv e. As e xpected, most clusters show a tendenc y to increase in ass and radius and thus mo v e diagonally upwards across the plot. he observed relation between mass and radius likely reflects this\nypical evolution. The increase in mass comes from additional star ormation and mergers of clusters while the increase in radius likely omes from the clusters tending to be virialized, so that the radius ncreases as they grow in mass, plus the effect of feedback increasing he radius.\nHo we ver not all clusters follow a path of increasing mass and adius. We see some, e.g. grey, coral lines, where the radius increases ut the cluster does not experience a significant increase in mass. e would expect some clusters to behave like this for a number f reasons, to fill the parameter space of observed clusters with maller masses and larger radii, and because we know in the Galaxy B associations exist that have large radii and small masses (the lack line is from the M1R1FB model). The cluster represented y the green line shows quite different behaviour. This radius of his cluster decreases with time. This is the result of a cluster plitting into two subclusters \u2013 the cluster grows by attaining ore stars or merging with another group of stars, but then splits part.\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nM\nFigure 10.

The red points indicate sinks that are not part of a cluster. For the feedback model (top) all the clusters show some expansion, though in many cases some core of sink particles remains.

We ound that the 1D expansion/contraction was a slightly better preictor of cluster evolution and we discuss this further in the next ection. .3.4 Evolution of constituent sink particles in a cluster n this section, rather than identifying clusters at different times and etermining that correspond to the same object (constituting a largely imilar but not necessarily identical set of constituent sink particles), e simply take the particles that constitute clusters at one time and how them at a later time. This has the advantage that we can follow ny clusters that disperse as well as bound clusters. In Fig. 10 , we how clusters from the low-mass Region 1 simulations, M1R5 and\n1R5FB, at a time of 7 Myr, and the locations of these particles at time of 16 Myr. We also show the average expansion/contraction elocity calculated o v er all particles in the clusters at 7 Myr. This elocity is calculated as (Kuhn et al. 2019 ; Buckner et al. 2022 )\nout = v \u00b7 \u02c6 r (5) here v and \u02c6 r are calculated relative to the centre of mass of the luster. We show all six clusters found from the nearest neighbour lgorithm at 7 Myr for the M1R5FB model. At 16 Myr, it is evident\nNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nhat in the model with feedback (M1R1FB) these clusters have xpanded quite a lot. The clusters that are picked out by the algorithm t 16 Myr tend to be the cores of the distributions highlighted at 7 Myr, lus possibly stars previously identified in another cluster. Many stars f the \u2018original\u2019 clusters are now at larger radii from these cores. The clusters shown in magenta and blue have more or less ispersed at 16 Myr. We find poorly resolved clusters ( < 20 particles) end to disperse, these are stated explicitly in the text as poorly esolved. By the end of the simulation (40 Myr, not shown), there are hree clusters picked out with the algorithm. Two contain constituent tars from the black, cyan and blue clusters at 7 Myr. A third contains onstituent stars from the cluster shown in grey. The clusters shown n green (which is poorly resolved) and magenta (which is well esolved) at 7 Myr have dispersed, i.e. the clusters picked out at 0 Myr do not contain any of these sink particles. The velocities for the clusters in Fig. 10 (top panel) are all airly low, and most are positive or zero, indicating expansion or o evolution. The cluster shown in blue has the largest expansion elocity, and by eye this cluster does appear to cover the greatest patial extent at 16 Myr. Nevertheless some sink particles from this luster still belong to clusters identified at 16 Myr, and as discussed bo v e ev en 40 Myr.\nIn the lower panels of Fig. 10 , we show clusters at the same times rom the model with no feedback (M1R1).

The luster in green (well resolved) remains more intact, and has a lower xpansion v elocity, and also lower virial parameter. In Fig. 11 , we show clusters from the M5R2 and M5R2FB runs. ecause there are many more clusters in M5R2FB, for clarity, we nly study clusters with masses greater than 2 \u00d7 10 3 M that means hat the selected clusters have more particles (at least 39). For the 5R2 model, all clusters are > 2 \u00d7 10 3 M and the minimum number f sink particles is 11. Although the clusters in the feedback model re spatially larger than without feedback, we otherwise see much reater similarity between the clusters selected with and without eedback compared to in the lower mass M5R1 models. At 4 Myr left-hand panels), the same clusters are selected in each simulation. hus, feedback appears to be having less effect on the clusters, as is lso the case for the other higher mass simulations. We also see from the velocities that there are more negative values ndicative of contraction compared to the lower mass models. In the\n5R1FB model, the velocities are all positive or only borderline e gativ e. Most of the clusters are readily identifiable at the 6 Myr ime frame, and most are still fairly compact. We see in the feedback odel that some of the clusters exhibit some expansion (e.g. green nd grey), others appear very similar (e.g. cyan and brown) that ostly exhibit negative velocities at both time frames. The cluster hown in grey has positive velocities at both times, and shows more vident dispersal. In the model without feedback (lower panels),\nhe velocities appear a fairly good indicator of short-term cluster volution. The clusters shown in green and blue have high negative elocities and visually appear to contract slightly. The clusters shown n grey and cyan have high positive velocities, are poorly resolved nd disperse rapidly, but the velocities are in agreement with the volution.\nWe also performed the same analysis on clusters from the M5R1FB nd M5R1 models at time frames of 2 and 4 Myr though we do not how the plots. Between 2 and 4 Myr, nearly all the clusters picked out ndergo collisions or interactions with each other. Hence, the velocity nalysis is not very meaningful because the clusters do not evolve in solation at all (though to some extent this is also true of M1R1FB). nlike the Region 2 models, we do see some examples of clusters dentified at 2 Myr where by 4 Myr the constituent sink particles re fairly widely dispersed (and certainly no longer identifiable as lusters). Ho we ver due to the compression of the gas, the clusters ll end up quite close together, and some constituent sinks may have oined another cluster. There is some suggestion of similar behaviour o M1R1FB, whereby the region is compressed together, the clusters orm and merge or collide, and in the resulting stellar population, ome clusters remain as clusters, whereas some are or have dispersed. or model M5R2FB, which does not have such strong dynamics, and he clusters interact less, the clusters seem to remain intact at least or the duration we study them for. We also show the evolution of lusters from the different models in Table 2 , indicating only those hat are well resolved.

For our higher mass simulations, the stars tend to form n fairly bound clusters, roughly at similar times and are atypical of earby OB associations. The M1R1FB region ho we ver contains a ower stellar density ( 0.1 M pc \u22122 ), stars form o v er a prolonged ime, and groups can be unbound themselves, and with respect to ach other. We compare the region in M1R1FB with specific regions given n Wright ( 2020 ) in Table 3 . As indicated in Table 3 , some nearby B regions are larger, and correspondingly tend to be older than 1R1FB, while some lesser known ones tend to be smaller and have ewer subgroups. Of the observed associations we have extensive nformation for, our simulated region is probably closest to Orion Ia. e show a visual comparison with Orion Ia in Appendix B . M1R1FB s similar mass and size to Orion Ia. The age spread is a little lower, rion Ia is slightly smaller and also there is likely more gas still n the vicinity of Orion Ia. These could be related to the amount of eedback in the simulation, e.g. with less feedback, star formation ay be more prolonged and larger volumes of gas remain. Prolonged as inflow into the region could also lead to more gas present at later imes.

This is o see how quickly / how much photoionization clears away the gas rom clusters, and the effect on stellar mass. In Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ), e chose radii of 1 and 2 pc. Here, we choose a larger radius of pc, partly because the ionization has a stronger effect here on the urrounding gas, and also because the lo wer densities, lo wer amounts f star formation, and smaller number of clusters, means that in most ases (though not al w ays) a radius of 5 pc will just contain one cluster.\nWe show results for a sample of clusters from the M1R1 nd M1R1FB (top), M5R1 and M51R1FB (middle) and M5R2 nd M5R2FB simulations (lower panels) in Fig. 12 , which orrespondingly have the lowest to highest mass clusters forming. We nly show clusters that can be followed for most of the simulation, xclude other clusters that merge or split with those already shown, nd only include those with a clear conterpart in the no feedback odel. The mass of gas within 5 pc is shown in the left, and the mass f stars on the right. Lines of the same colour represent the same luster identified from models with and without feedback. Recalling obbs et al. ( 2022 ), where v ery massiv e clusters formed, there we aw a relatively small reduction in the stellar mass, up to around 5 per cent, while the gas mass could decrease by up to an order of agnitude. Starting with the low-mass simulations (top panels) we see that the nclusion of ionization has a dramatic effect on the mass of gas within pc. We find that within 5 Myr (from 2 to 7 Myr) the mass of gas ithin 5 pc drops by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude for the four clusters hen ionization is included. By contrast, with no ionization, the gas ass within 5 pc stays relatively constant. The mass of stars within pc is also substantially reduced, by a third or so at earlier times and ore later, and again substantially more compared to Dobbs et al. 2022 ). In the M5R2FB and M5R2 simulations (middle panel), the onization again has a clear effect on the gas, decreasing the gas ass by an order of magnitude and a half for the clusters shown n red, green, and blue o v er 3 or 4 Myr. The effect on the cluster n magenta is much less, though this cluster evolves for less time. gain, for all the clusters with ionization, the gas mass decreases v er time, whereas it stays more or less constant with no ionization. he stellar mass shows a more moderate change, unsurprisingly there s minimal change for the cluster shown in magenta, though for the luster shown in red, the mass is less than half with ionization.\nheir properties and a comparison to the stellar distribution in M1R1FB is Orion Ia (see Appendix B ).\nComparison to M1R1FB yr)\nToo large, star formation occurring o v er longer time Slightly bigger, slightly larger age spread Older, more subgroups Too big Too small Too massive\nr Too small\n\u2013\nPatna user on 19 January 2024\nFigure 12. The mass of gas and stars within 5 pc of the centre of clusters is shown for the different models. Clusters are selected that have counterparts in the no feedback simulation, and the same colour lines are used to represent equi v alent clusters.\nw l h f t m p i t c s\no t g i h\nc d o w l p\n3\nI r i e a c w a M\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nFinally the lower panels show the M5R1FB and M5R1 models, here higher mass clusters form, so closer to although still somewhat ess massive than those in Dobbs et al. ( 2022 ). Again ionization as a clear effect on the gas mass. The gas mass decreases by a actor of around 2\u20134 o v er a time-scale of 2\u20132.5 Myr. So this is less han the other simulations, but the time-scale is shorter. The gas\nass in the models without ionization shows some small decrease, ossibly because comparably more gas mass has been converted nto stars. The ionization reduces the mass by a factor of 2 for he clusters shown in red and green, but has minimal effect on the luster shown in blue, which is also the most massive in any of the imulations.\nOverall there is a tendency for ionization to have a greater effect n lower mass clusters. The trend is not completely clear because he time-scales are longer for the lo wer masses. Ho we ver, more as is remo v ed and the stellar masses tend to be more reduced by onization after 3 Myr for the lower mass clusters compared to the igher mass clusters. Generally, gas is expelled from the vicinity of\nlusters on Myr time-scales in agreement with observations. And, as iscussed in Section 3.2 , for the high-mass clusters, stellar masses f 10 4 or 10 5 M are accumulated before feedback has much effect, hereas for the lower mass clusters, mass is accumulated o v er a onger time and feedback has more chance to impact the cluster roperties.\n.4 Impact of superno v ae\nn the results presented so far, we include supernovae. We also epeated runs M1R1FB, M5R2FB, and M25R2FB with only ionzation, starting from just before the first supernovae. Like Bending t al. ( 2022 ), we did not switch ionization off when stars were the ge to undergo supernovae (see Herrington et al., in preparation). We ompare the M1R1FB, M5R2FB, and M25R2FB models with and ithout supernovae in Fig. 13 . The models M5R2FB and M25R2FB re shown at the end points of the simulation, whilst the models 1R1FB and M1R1FB are shown at 12 Myr, but the evolution of\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nM\nFigure 13. The upper panels show models with both ionization and supernov ae; the lo wer panels show models with no supernovae. The supernovae do not have a large effect, rather they fill already diffuse regions with hot gas. The dashed lines indicate where the hot gas lies; in the left-hand panels, it fills the area shown with the lowest densities as seen by eye. The column density scale differs on the left-hand panels, and the spatial extent is also larger.\nM s\ni s w M m h s g i 1\nr r s l t i t n\n4\nW w s v s t m\nc o\nc m p t S r ( 2\no t o o d i m f i r i V A t e M i ( T F\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n1R1FB does not change significantly after 7 or 8 Myr, the gas imply becomes more diffuse. As seen in Bending et al. ( 2022 ), the supernovae do not have a big mpact and are secondary compared to the ionization. The supernovae imply appear to fill the low-density regions created by the ionization ith even lower density, hotter (10 8 K) gas, marked explicitly for the 5R2FB and M25R2FB models. The supernovae appear to have a ore marked effect in the lowest gas mass model, M1R1FB, which as had a similar number of supernovae to the M5R2FB model. The upernovae create a very clear cavity, and at the edges of this the as is denser and more compressed compared to the case with only onization. The size of this cavity is also quite large, of the order of 00 pc. The superno vae hav e a v ery minor impact on the star formation ate and clusters. The supernovae slightly increase the star formation ate compared to without supernovae; the density enhancement we ee at the edges of the supernovae bubbles in Fig. 13 can be enough to ead to slightly more stars. The supernovae can also slightly change he positions of the sinks, which changes the groupings of the sinks nto clusters, but their spatial distribution is still fairly similar, and he o v erall properties and trends, e.g. the cluster radius relation, do ot change.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne have performed simulations of two sections along spiral arms ith different initial gas densities, including photoionizing and\nupernova feedback. The initial conditions are taken from preious galaxy-scale simulations, and e xhibit conv erging flows in piral arms. One region exhibits strongly converging flows, and he other moderately converging flows. We change the initial gas\nass to run lower gas density simulations whereby lower mass\nNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nlusters form, to produce a population of clusters across a range f masses. We find that photoionizing feedback has a notable effect on luster radii and is required to produce the observed cluster radius\u2013 ass relation (in agreement with Fukushima & Yajima 2022 ). As hotoionization clears away gas from the vicinity of the cluster, he gravitational potential is reduced and the cluster expands. imilarly, N -body simulations of clusters where gas is explicitly emo v ed also show that the radius of the cluster thereafter increases Bastian & Goodwin 2006 ; Moeckel & Bate 2010 ; L \u0308ughausen et al. 012 ). Superno vae hav e little impact on cluster properties. Typically, the y ccur after the cluster masses and radii have become established. In erms of cluster masses, spatial distribution, and simply the number f clusters, we find that the effect of photoionization is much greater n these properties when lower mass clusters form, i.e. at lower gas ensities and lower converging flows. This is because star formation s prolonged, so photoionization has time to act, whereas the high-\nass clusters form quickly with high star formation rates. The star ormation rate, and mass of clusters formed, is suppressed more n the lower density regions (although the total stellar mass is only educed by a factor of 2). This is similar to previous results studying ndividual molecular clouds (Dale, Ercolano & Bonnell 2012 ; Col \u0301\u0131n,  \u0301azquez-Semadeni & G \u0301omez 2013 ; Dale 2017 ; Gavagnin et al. 2017 ; li & Harries 2019 ; Kim, Ostriker & Filippova 2021 ). One caveat o this result is that we do not include radiation pressure, which is xpected to be more rele v ant in high-density regimes (Krumholz & atzner 2009 ; Kim, Kim & Ostriker 2018 ). IR radiation from dust s also expected to be rele v ant in high-density dust-rich regimes Skinner & Ostriker 2015 ; Raskutti, Ostriker & Skinner 2016 ; sang & Milosavljevi \u0301c 2018 ), although very recent work by Menon, ederrath & Krumholz ( 2022 ) finds that radiation from dust only\nh e 2\nu c u m e t w s s r 2\na T m M r o s o 2 c t\nA\nW a I I ( f a o w p f E A P S\nD\nT t\nR\nA A A B B\nB B B\nB B B\nB B B B\nC C\nC C C\nC C D D D\nD D\nE E E E E\nF\nF F F F G\nG\nG G G G\nG\nG\nH\nH\nH J J\nK K K K K K\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nas a small effect on the star formation rate, and may not be that f fecti ve at dispersing the gas (Tsang & Milosavljevi \u0301c 2018 ; Ali 021 ). During cluster evolution, mergers and splits are common, particlarly in higher density, more dynamic regions. The most massive lusters that form in each simulation tend to be those that have nder gone mer gers. Some clusters mo v e diagonally towards higher asses, and higher radii, in the cluster radius\u2013mass plot, as might be xpected if clusters gro w. Ho we ver, clusters can stay at or even move o lower masses, simply because the cluster is relatively isolated, or here a cluster has split into lower mass clusters. The fraction of tars in clusters also decreases with time, as the clusters interact and tars are ejected, and through dynamical ejection. For our longest un model, the lowest mass model, this fraction flattens out around 0 per cent. We only see a low-density group of stars similar to an OB ssociation form in our low-mass model with feedback (M1R1FB). his is not surprising, as this is the least gravitationally dominated, ost dynamic model. Unlike Grudi \u0301c et al. ( 2021 ), who model a 10 7\ncloud and obtain a dozen or so clusters in one association, our egion is lower density, lower mass and produces a smaller number f groups, some of which themselves are more like associations. The tar-forming region here is not dissimilar to Orion Ia. The evolution f this region supports the findings from recent work (Wright et al. 016 ; Ward & Kruijssen 2018 ) that OB associations are not simply lusters that are expanding, but their evolution is more complex and here is no simple picture of uniform expansion.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the referee for a useful report that helped clarify some spects of the paper.

In Figs A3 and A4 , we show the luster evolution for M5R1FB and M5R1, and in Figs A5 and A6 , e show the cluster evolution for M5R2FB and M5R2.\nFigure A1. The clusters identified from the M1R1FB model are shown between 2 and 16 Myr. Points indicated in red are sink particles not identified as part of a cluster, these are shown with smaller points for clarity. At the end point of the simulation, 40 Myr (not shown), there are three clusters.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nM\nFigure A2.

The simulation figure (right-hand panel) shows the egion in the y \u2212x plane (i.e. as would be face on). Although\not shown, the region displays a similar morphology in terms of ore gas at the lower part of the image, and the stars occupying broad diagonal distribution to the top right, in the z\u2212y plane i.e. as would be viewed through the plane of the disc in our alaxy).\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nMNRAS 517, 675\u2013696 (2022)\nFigure B1. The left-hand panel shows the Orion region (Megeath, Gutermuth & Kounkel 2022 ). The background is an extinction map from the Planck Le gac y Archive. OB stars are indicated by light blue circles. The red points indicate stars, either from the Spitzer surv e y or GAIA DR2. The right-hand panel shows the simulation, the background green-blue colour scale is the gas column density. In this figure, sinks have been converted to stars according to the method in Liow et al. ( 2022 ), with stars distributed within 10 pc of the original positions of the sinks. The main difference compared to just using the sink particles is that the number of points better matches the observations. O stars are indicated by light blue stars.\nThis paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/675/6694109 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024"
