To gain insight into the response of the cryptochrome to a weak magnetic field, we have studied the quantum-mechanical hyperfine spin states of the radical pair. We identify quantum states responsible for the precise detection of the magnetic field direction, taking into account the strongly axial hyperfine interactions of each radical in the radical pair. The contribution of these states to the formation of the cryptochrome signaling state sharply increases when the magnetic field becomes orthogonal to the hyperfine axis of either radical. Due to such a response, the radical pair may be able to detect the particular field direction normal to the plane containing the hyperfine axes of the radicals. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\nA transient radical pair is thought to be a key part of the \u201cchemical compass,\u201d which enables migratory birds to detect the direction of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field with high precision, see, e.g., the review1 and references therein. Such a radical pair is formed photochemically in cryptochrome photoreceptor proteins. These possess a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore. Cryptochrome proteins have been identified in the retinas of certain birds,2\u20134 which may indicate that the direction of the geomagnetic poles is perceived visually.5,6 The experimental characterization of these avian cryptochromes is in progress,7 and various theoretical studies explore the possible effects of a magnetic field on other better characterized cryptochromes8\u201311 and on photolyases homologous to cryptochromes,8 as well as on model compounds.12\u201315\nThe radical-pair hypothesis of cryptochrome magnetoreception1,16\u201318 suggests that a radical pair is photochemically formed between the FAD chromophore and a tryptophan (Trp) residue that undergoes spin-selective chemical\nreactions. In the cryptochrome crystal structure, three or four conserved Trp residues constitute a chain-like structure connecting the FAD chromophore with the protein surface. The radical pair either mediates the formation of the cryptochrome signaling state or recombines, re-establishing the initial state of the photoreceptor. The first process, which develops by the separation of the radicals due to electron transfer along the Trp chain and deprotonation of the terminal Trp radical,19 is spin-independent, whereas the second process is determined by the singlet electronic spin character of the radical pair. The electronic spin character of the photochemically created radical pair is the same as that of the singlet excited FAD chromophore,1 but it varies during the lifetime of the radical-pair as the radical pair undergoes interconversion of the singlet and triplet states driven by internal spin interactions and by the external magnetic field. The compass function demands an anisotropy of the internal interactions, which ensures the dependence of the interconversion yield on the magnetic field direction. In theoretical models, the sources of the internal interaction relevant to the radical-pair based compass include the hyperfine coupling (HFC) of\nJ. Chem.

Spin-dynamics simulations26 demonstrated that the recombination yield of the radical pair with these HFC interactions displays a sharp minimum, referred to as a \u201cspike\u201d or \u201cquantum needle,\u201d for a specific orientation of the radical pair in the 50 \u03bcT magnetic fields. The spike results from a strongly axial HFC contributed by the nitrogen nuclei in the FAD and Trp radicals and develops if quantum-mechanical spin coherences last sufficiently long (longer than a few microseconds). Simulations assuming a shorter spin coherence time or considering a radical pair in which only one radical possesses an axial HFC do not display the spike.9,18,26\u201332 An insufficiently dense directional grid might be the reason why the spike is missing in the simulations.33 Owing to the narrow spike, a compass based on the radical pair could detect the direction of the geomagnetic field with high precision.26 The spike feature is more pronounced in a simple model accounting for only one axial HFC in each radical of the pair. Including more magnetic nuclei weakens the spike,23 as was originally discovered in simulations26 taking into account 16 nuclear spins in total. The spike is not extremely sensitive to spin relaxation caused by reasonably rapid (faster than 1 ns) and smallamplitude (less than 10\u25cb) rotational movements of the radicals.26 However, it is important to note that the quantum needle feature was first found in simulations neglecting the inter-radical spin interactions.26 Experimental studies7,34 later demonstrated rather small exchange interactions but a significant electron\u2013electron dipolar spin coupling in the cryptochrome radical pairs. The theoretical simulations23 revealed that the electron\u2013electron dipolar coupling strongly suppresses the spike-like anisotropy. Moreover, including these interactions in simulations is essential for capturing the effect of radio-frequency magnetic fields.35 Certain spin relaxation processes36 might also weaken the spike-like response. Hence, it remains questionable whether the quantum needle phenomenon initially described for the cryptochrome radical pair has relevance for the magnetic compass in animals.\nIn the present study, we aimed at a qualitative understanding of the quantum needle phenomenon. In a two-level model, the spike in the recombination yield was attributed to an avoided crossing of the quantum-mechanical energy levels, suggesting26 that the nature of the radical-pair based compass is more quantummechanical than was previously realized. As in the original study,26 we considered the idealized FAD-Trp radical pair with the hyperfine interactions contributed by a single nitrogen nucleus in each radical. For the idealized radical pair, we rigorously computed the hyperfine spin states in a weak geomagnetic field, neglecting the inter-radical spin coupling, and focused on the state properties responsible for the formation of the spikes. Our calculations demonstrate the anisotropic response related to the electron spin alignment to the direction of the largest principal value of the nitrogen HFC tensor (referred to as the HFC axis) either in one or in both radicals. However, only the states with the electron spin alignment to the HFC axis in both radicals could be responsible for the sharp decrease in the radical-pair recombination yield and the corresponding sharp enhancement of the formation of the putative signaling state.\nThe analysis of the dependence of the radical pair energies and properties on the magnetic field direction is described in the following sections. Section II describes a quantum-mechanical approach to computing the field-direction dependency of the states, and Sec. III describes a model radical pair. Sections IV and V present the computational results for the individual radicals and radical pairs. Discussion and concluding remarks are given in Sec. VI. Appendix A provides the spin matrices for the helicity spin basis states employed in our calculations, and Appendix B outlines the derivation of an expression for the spin-interconversion singlet yield. The supplementary material contains the results characterizing the singlet weights of the computed radical-pair states."

For each radical, we take into account the coupling of the electron spin to the spins of nuclei (the hyperfine interaction) and to the magnetic field (the Zeeman interaction) and use a standard quantum-mechanical approach to compute the spin states from the states of uncoupled electron and nuclei spins.\nThe states of the single radicals are determined by the Hamiltonian\nH =\u2211 n a(n)ij si L (n) j + \u03b3e Bi si, (1)\nwhere a(n)ij are the HFC tensors of nuclei enumerated by the number n, si and L(n)j are the components of the electron and nuclei spins s and L(n), respectively, Bi are the components of the magnetic field B, and \u03b3e is the electron gyro-magnetic ratio. The indices i and j designate the axes of the coordinate frame, the same for both radicals, and the tensor notations assume summation over the repeated indices. We define the energies in terms of the magnetic field strength (1 mT corresponds to 4.253 \u00d7 10\u22129 hartree), and neglect a small deviation of the electron g-factor from 2, so that \u03b3e = 1.\nTo compute the states \u2223k\u27e9 of the Hamiltonian (1), we expand them in the states \u2223m{l}\u27e9 of uncoupled spins,\n\u2223k\u27e9 = \u2211 m{l} ckm{l}\u2223m{l}\u27e9, (2)\nwhere m and {l} are the spin magnetic quantum numbers of the electron and nuclei, respectively. The multi-spin states \u2223m{l}\u27e9 span the single-spin electron \u2223m\u27e9 and nucleus \u2223l\u27e9 states, for which the numbers m and l give projections of the spins onto a quantization axis determined by a unit vector n(\u03d1, \u03c6), where \u03d1 and \u03c6 are the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively, in the cryptochrome coordinate system. We thus employ the helicity states37 instead of the more commonly used spin basis states defined for the quantization direction along the z-axis of the reference coordinate system; see Appendix A for details. We find it practical to base our calculations on the helicity spin states since this explicitly reveals that the intrinsic HFC anisotropy does not lead to direction-dependent energies and properties of the hyperfine states in the absence of a magnetic field. On the other hand, it is straightforward to adapt the helicity\nJ. Chem.

In order to make the notations less cumbersome, we omit in what follows the curly brackets indicating sets of the nucleus spin quantum numbers and use l either as a single number or a set of numbers according to the context.\nWith the known HFC tensors, the Hamiltonian matrix \u27e8m\u2032l\u2032\u2223H\u2223ml\u27e9 was obtained via the direct product technique by using the matrices (A1) and (A2). Solving the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian matrix gives the radical spin-state energies Ek and the states (2) with the coefficients ckml possessing the orthonormality and completeness properties. For numerical solutions, we applied a standard matrix diagonalization procedure.\nTo analyze the properties of the electron spin, we evaluate the mean value and the respective standard deviation for the projection of the electronic spin onto a direction specified by a unit vector e. We consider two choices of e, along the HFC axis and along the magnetic field, and study the spin polarization along e determined by the matrix elements,\n\u27e8k\u2223se\u2223k\u2032\u27e9 = \u2211 m\u2032ml (ckm\u2032 l)\n\u2217 ck \u2032 ml \u27e8m\u2032\u2223se\u2223m\u27e9. (3)\nThis expression takes into account that the operator se is diagonal in the nucleus spin states. The sum involves the matrix elements of this operator in the electron spin states, which are straightforward to obtain using the analytical form (A1) of \u27e8m\u2032\u2223si\u2223m\u27e9 in the helicity basis. The mean electron spin projection \u27e8se\u27e9k is given by the diagonal element,\n\u27e8se\u27e9k = \u27e8k\u2223se\u2223k\u27e9. (4) The standard deviation \u03c3k(se) depends on the square of the mean projection, which, in turn, depends on the off-diagonal elements,\n\u03c3k(se) = \u221a \u27e8k\u2223(se)2\u2223k\u27e9 \u2212 (\u27e8k\u2223se\u2223k\u27e9)2, (5)\n\u27e8k\u2223(se)2\u2223k\u27e9 =\u2211 k\u2032 \u27e8k\u2223se\u2223k\u2032\u27e9\u27e8k\u2032\u2223se\u2223k\u27e9 =\u2211 k\u2032 \u2223\u27e8k\u2223se\u2223k\u2032\u27e9\u22232. (6)\nFor the polarization in the field direction e(\u03d1, \u03c6) = n(\u03d1, \u03c6), Eq. (3) simplifies to\n\u27e8k\u2223sn\u2223k\u2032\u27e9 = 1 2\u2211l [(ck1 2 ,l )\u2217ck\u20321 2 ,l \u2212 (ck\u2212 12 ,l) \u2217 ck \u2032 \u2212 12 ,l ], (7)\nsince the non-zero matrix elements \u27e8m\u2032\u2223sn\u2223m\u27e9 are \u00b11/2 for m\u2032 = m = \u00b11/2 in the helicity basis; see Eq. (A3).\nHaving computed the hyperfine states of two radicals, we determine the states and energies of the radical pair,\n\u2223k1k2\u27e9 = \u2223k1\u27e9(1) \u2223k2\u27e9(2), (8)\nEk1k2 = E(1)k1 + E (2) k2 , (9)\nwhere 1 and 2 designate the radicals. For each state of the radical pair, we obtain the singlet weight,\nSk1k2 =\u2211 l1 l2 \u2223\u27e8Sl1l2\u2223k1k2\u27e9\u22232, (10)\nwhere l1 and l2 denote the sets of the nucleus spin quantum numbers of the radicals, and \u2223Sl1l2\u27e9 are the singlet combinations of the basis states,\n\u2223Sl1l2\u27e9 = 1\u221a 2 (\u22231 2 , l1\u27e9 \u2223\u221212 , l2\u27e9 \u2212 \u2223\u2212 1 2 , l1\u27e9 \u222312 , l2\u27e9). (11)\nThe inner products in Eq. (10) are calculated with the spin wavefunctions (2) as follows:\n\u27e8Sl1l2\u2223k1k2\u27e9 = 1\u221a 2 (ck11 2 ,l1 ck2 \u2212 12 ,l2 \u2212 ck1 \u2212 12 ,l1 ck21 2 ,l2 ). (12)\nOwing to the completeness property of the radical-pair states \u2223k1k2\u27e9 and the normalization property of the singlet combinations (11), the sum of the singlet weights (10) of all the spin states of the radical pair equals the number of the nuclear spin states,\n\u2211 k1k2 Sk1k2 = Z1Z2, (13)\nwhere Z1 and Z2 are the nuclear spin multiplicities of the hyperfine manifolds of the radicals 1 and 2, respectively.\nThe probability of finding a radical pair in a singlet state oscillates with time due to the singlet-triplet interconversion. For a non-decaying radical pair, the oscillations develop around a constant value \u27e8\u03a6S\u27e9, which we refer to as the interconversion singlet yield. For a singlet-born radical with non-degenerate spin-states \u2223k1k2\u27e9, \u27e8\u03a6S\u27e9 relates to the singlet weights of the states (see Appendix B for the derivation),\n\u27e8\u03a6S\u27e9 = (Z1Z2)\u22121\u2211 k1k2 S2k1k2. (14)\nThis expression corresponds to the expression for the singlet yield derived within the spin density matrix formalism27 in the limit of very slow radical-pair recombination."

(17) and (18), degenerate levels 3,4 have an energy close to zero (on the energy scale of Fig. 2), whereas the energy separation of these levels from levels 1,2 and 5,6 is about half of the largest HFC strength a3. With respect to the electron spin polarization, we note that any linear combination of the degenerate states describes the same energy level, but the mean values of the electron spin projection [cf. Eq. (4)] are generally different for different combinations. Hence the spin polarization is not uniquely defined for the zero-field energy levels. Obtaining the direction-independent and non-polarized energy levels indicates that the intrinsic HFC anisotropy of the radical does not manifest itself in the absence of a magnetic field.\nThe magnetic field lifts the energy level degeneracy. The maximal energy separation of the split levels is B; see Eqs. (21) and (22) below. For the 50 \u03bcT field, B is much smaller than the a3 HFC strength of both FAD\u25cf\u2212 and Trp\u25cf+, so that the hyperfine levels of the radicals remain grouped in pairs; see the solid lines in Fig. 2. We also note that condition (17) describing the HFC anisotropy ensures that the relation between B and the scales of the zero-field hyperfine spin energies,\na21/a3 \u226a B\u226a a3, (19)\nis fulfilled for both radicals over the range of magnetic field strength from a few \u03bcT to about 1 mT and results in a similar response of the states of the radicals to the direction of the geomagnetic field.\nIn Fig. 2, the direction of the magnetic field B(\u03d1, \u03c6) varies with \u03d1 at \u03c6 = 130\u25cb. The lower- and higher-energy levels demonstrate clear dependency on \u03d1. The energy splitting in the level pairs is almost zero at values of \u03d1 corresponding to the orthogonal field orientations, B e3. For the HFC tensor with two zero principal values, a1 = a2 = 0, we find analytically that the splitting vanishes at B e3, and the crossing energies are\nE1,2(B e3) = \u2212(a3/2) \u221a\n1 + (B/a3)2, E5,6(B e3) = (a3/2) \u221a 1 + (B/a3)2.\n(20)\nThus, a non-vanishing splitting, i.e., an avoided crossing of the energy levels at the magnetic field orthogonal to the HFC axis, results from the small principal HFC values a1 and a2. For both radicals, the minimal splitting is particularly small for the higher-energy levels; see the insets in Fig. 2. Except for the values within the avoided crossings, the computed energies are well approximated by the sums of the zero-field energies and the Zeeman energy \u03b3eBs of the electron spin magnetic moment for the spin orientation parallel to the HFC axis,\nE1,2(B) = E1,2(0) \u2213 12 \u2223Be3\u2223, E5,6(B) = E5,6(0) \u2213 1 2 \u2223Be3\u2223, (21)\nwhere the \u201c\u2213\u201d signs correspond to the opposite possible directions of the spin. The middle-energy levels are almost independent of the field direction and differ from the zero-field energies by the Zeeman energy for the electron spin orientation parallel to the field,\nE3,4(B) = E3,4(0) \u2213 12 B. (22)\nFor the non-degenerate hyperfine states, the matrix elements (3) define uniquely the polarization of the electron spin studied for both radicals in Fig. 3. For the lower- and higher-energy states (top and bottom plots in Fig. 3), the mean values of the electron spin projections onto the HFC axis are close to \u22121/2 and +1/2, and the respective standard deviations are very small in all field directions except for the narrow domains around the directions orthogonal to the HFC axes. When the field orientation passes the orthogonal direction, the mean spin projections sharply interchange, and the standard deviations sharply approach the maximal 1/2 value. An electron spin flip then occurs, as the spin alignment to e3 changes from parallel to anti-parallel and vice versa, while the sign of the spin projection onto B is conserved. For the middle-energy states, the mean values of the electron spin projections onto the magnetic field almost coincide with \u22121/2 or +1/2, and the standard deviations are small for any direction of the field; see the middle plots in Fig. 3.\nNote that a general property of a 1/2 spin is the existence of a direction onto which the projection of the spin takes exactly the value of 1/2. For the non-degenerate states, this direction is unambiguously determined by the average of the spin, the so called spin polarization vector,39 which is straightforward to compute. We\nJ. Chem.

The results indicate that in a weak magnetic field the spin polarization vector is practically parallel or anti-parallel to the HFC axis for the states 1,2 and 5,6 and to the magnetic field for the states 3,4, so that the electron spin is coupled either to the nuclear spin or to the magnetic field. We therefore classify the spin states according to the electron spin polarization, labeling the states 1,2 and 5,6 as H (HFC-determined) and the states 3,4 as F (magnetic-field-determined)."

            "text": "The hyperfine multiplets of the FAD\u25cf\u2212 and Trp\u25cf+ radicals, each of six spin states, combine in the 36 states of the [FAD\u25cf\u2212\u2013Trp\u25cf+] radical pair with the energies Ek1k2 (k1, k2 = 1\u20136). The hyperfine levels of the radical pair comprise nine groups separated by energy and consisting of four levels each. Figure 4 shows the levels vs the polar angle of the magnetic field vector. This structure results from the separation of the lower- and higher-energy levels of one radical relative to the levels of the other radical (Fig. 2). The electron spin polarization for each state of the radical pair is defined by the H and F polarization types of the individual radical states. The four types of radical pair polarization are designated as follows: type HH is a combination of states with the HFC polarization in both radicals; type HF is the combination of the HFC polarization in FAD\u25cf\u2212 and\nthe field polarization in Trp\u25cf+; type FH is the combination of the field polarization in FAD\u25cf\u2212 with the HFC polarization in Trp\u25cf+; and and type FF combines the field polarizations in both radicals. The level energies of the FF group are practically independent of the field direction, E33 \u2248 \u2212B, E44 \u2248 B, and E34 \u2248 E43 \u2248 0. The energies of the HH, HF, and FH groups vary with the field direction and undergo avoided crossings (marked by the vertical bars in Fig. 4). In the HH groups, the crossings occur at the two field directions, each corresponding to the avoided crossing in one of the radicals, whereas in the HF and FH groups, the crossing occurs at a single direction corresponding to the avoided crossing of either FAD\u25cf\u2212 or Trp\u25cf+.\nFigure 5 shows singlet weight profiles specific to the four polarization types. The states not included in the figure have singlet weights with similar profiles and are presented in the supplementary material, Fig. S1. The singlet weights of the HH states vary step-wise with the field direction, sharply changing between values close to zero and close to 0.5 at the directions corresponding to the avoided energy crossings. The singlet weights of the HF and FH states vary, to a good approximation, with the cosine of the angle between the magnetic field and the HFC axes (of FAD\u25cf\u2212 for the HF states and of Trp\u25cf+ for the FH states). The profiles comprise two cosine branches alternating in the direction of the avoided crossing. The singlet weights of the FF states are practically independent of the field direction, likewise the respective energies, and either almost zero or 0.5. For each group comprising the four states, the sum of the singlet weights\nFIG. 5. The singlet weights Sk1k2 of the radical-pair groups of states corresponding to specific electron spin polarization types HH, HF, FH, and FF. The magnetic field direction varies with \u03d1 at \u03c6 = 130\u25cb. A separate plot in each row shows the direction profiles of the sums of the singlet weights and the singlet weights squared.\nJ.

For the nine groups of four states each, the singlet weights sum up to 9, which is the nuclear spin multiplicity in agreement with Eq. (13).\nThe squares of the singlet weights determine the interconversion singlet yield of the singlet-born radical pair according to Eq. (14). For the HH, HF, and FH groups of the states, the sums of the singlet weights squared depend on the field direction. The profiles corresponding to the HH groups of states exhibit a pair of spikes originating from the step segments of the singlet weight profiles (Fig. 5). The alternating segments do not compensate each other in the sum of the singlet weights squared, whereas the compensation is complete in the sum of the singlet weights. The sums of weights squared for the HF and FH groups of states vary with the magnetic field direction according to the cosine of the double angle between the magnetic field and the HFC axis of FAD\u25cf\u2212 and of Trp\u25cf+, respectively.\nThe field-direction dependency of the interconversion singlet yield defined by Eq. (14) provides the basis for the cryptochrome radical-pair compass.27 In Fig. 6, we show the interconversion singlet yield computed as a function of the angle \u03d1 for the two values of the angle \u03c6 (see Figs. S1 and S2 of the supplementary material for the respective singlet weights). The most striking feature of the singlet yield profiles is the sharp minima or spikes in the field directions perpendicular to the HFC axes of the radicals. In Fig. 6(a), the spike at \u03d1 = 107.9\u25cb marks the direction perpendicular to the FAD\u25cf\u2212 HFC axis, and the spike at \u03d1 = 140.5\u25cb marks the direction perpendicular to the Trp\u25cf+ HFC axis. The occurrence of the spikes is in line with the results26,35 of the spin dynamics simulations. If \u03c6 corresponds to the direction orthogonal to the both HFC axes, the two spikes are observed at a single \u03d1 value [Fig. 6(b)]. The direction of the magnetic field orthogonal to the HFC axes of both radicals can be regarded as a special direction. For the non-collinear HFC axes, it is one of the two opposite directions \u00b1e(1)3 \u00d7 e(2)3 . In the cryptochrome coordinate system, the HFC axes e(1)3 and e (2) 3 are given by Eqs. (15) and (16), respectively, and the special directions of the field are those with \u03c6 = 39.12\u25cb, \u03d1 = 117.3\u25cb [assumed in Fig. 6(b)] and \u03c6 = 219.12\u25cb, \u03d1 = 62.7\u25cb. If the HFC axes were collinear, any field direction in the plane perpendicular to them would correspond to a single spike.\nTo relate the direction anisotropy to the electron spin polarization, we computed four partial singlet yields contributed by the HH, HF, FH, and FF states (Fig. 6). The spikes occur only in the HH profile and, therefore, must result from the HFC-determined electron spin polarization in both radicals. The HF (FH) singlet yield profiles display a rolling dependency with the maximum and minimum corresponding to the directions parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the HFC axis of FAD\u25cf\u2212 (Trp\u25cf+). The FF states provide a practically isotropic contribution, which is the smallest of all the partial singlet yields. For the \u03c6 value of the special direction of the magnetic field, the HF and FH \u03d1-profiles become \u201cin-phase\u201d with the minima corresponding to the single spike in the HH profile.\nThe spike that relates to the axial HFC in one radical exists if the HFC tensor in this radical has two small but non-zero principal values. In addition, the HFC tensor in the partner radical must also possess axiality, but its two smallest principal values need not be non-zero. Indeed, letting a1 = a2 = 0 in the FAD\u25cf\u2212 N5 tensor results in the disappearance of the related spike; see Fig. 7(a). This\nFIG. 6.

The upper curve in the plots displays the total interconversion singlet yield, whereas the lower curves show the partial singlet yields determined by the contributions of the HH, HF, FH, and FF radical-pair states. In panel (a), the spikes at \u03d1 = 107.9\u25cb and \u03d1 = 140.5\u25cb mark the magnetic field directions perpendicular to the HFC axis of FAD\u25cf\u2212 and Trp\u25cf+, respectively. In panel (b), the spike at \u03d1 = 117.3\u25cb defines the field direction orthogonal to the HFC axes of both radicals.\nsituation corresponds to the true crossing of the energy levels [Eq. (20)], as noted previously.26 The spike due to the Trp\u25cf+ N1 HFC tensor remains practically unchanged in Figs. 6(a) and 7(a). The disappearance of the Trp\u25cf+ spike for an isotropic (as well as for a zero-valued) FAD\u25cf\u2212 N5 HFC tensor is demonstrated in Figs. 7(b)\u20137(d). The singlet weight profiles that determine the singlet yield profiles in Fig. 7 are described in the supplementary material, Figs. S3\u2013S6.\nFigure 8 demonstrates that the spikes in the interconversion singlet yield profiles are affected by the angle, designated \u03b1, between the HFC axes of the two radicals (for the singlet weight profiles, we refer to the supplementary material, Figs. S7\u2013S10). Changing the orientation of the HFC axes of FAD\u25cf\u2212 and Trp\u25cf+ with respect to each other varies the amplitude of the anisotropic response and the relative positions of the spikes (solid lines in Fig. 8). The largest amplitude is achieved for a single spike at \u03b1 = 0. With increasing \u03b1, the spacing between the spikes along the \u03d1-axis increases but the depth of the spikes decreases until the spikes completely disappear at \u03b1 = 90\u25cb. The amplitudes of the HF and FH singlet yields do not vary with \u03b1. Note that the spiky minima of the HH singlet yield\nJ. Chem.

The spikes thus disappear at \u03b1 = 90\u25cb because the background downshifts to the spike minima. The shapes of the spikes vary with changing HFC axiality. The up-scaled values of the a1 and a2 principal values broaden the spikes (see the dashed-line profiles in Fig. 8), whereas the down-scaled values narrow the spikes (the dotted-line profiles in Fig. 8), in agreement with the analytical model.26 The up-scaled a1 and a2 also result in lowering the profile background.

            "heading": "VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "In this paper, we have explored the quantum-mechanical nature of the effect of the quantum needle,26 a sharp variation of the recombination yield of the cryptochrome FAD\u2013Trp radical pair when the direction of a weak magnetic field varies. Our approach links the field-direction dependency of the singlet-triplet interconversion of the radical pair to the properties of the quantum states of the individual radicals. It was applied to an idealized radical pair where the hyperfine spin-states of each radical are determined by a single nitrogen HFC tensor of a highly axial shape and the interradical spin interactions are ignored. Such a radical pair with a sufficiently long lifetime is known to demonstrate the quantum needle effect26 in the direction of the magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the flavin radical HFC axis. Our results suggest that the electron spin polarization in the spin-energy states plays a key role in the peculiar anisotropic response of the radical pair to a weak magnetic field. The polarization is activated by the presence of a magnetic field and imparts particular electron spin properties to the states responsible for the quantum needle effect.\nIn the model considered here, the electron spin polarization in the hyperfine states of the individual radicals was found to be of two distinct types: either along the HFC axis (H type) or along the magnetic field (F type). The respective states respond to the field direction in essentially different ways. In the F-type radical states, the spin polarization direction merely follows the field direction. In the H-type states, the polarized electron spin flips between the two opposite alignments with the HFC axis as the field direction becomes perpendicular to the axis. The flips obey conservation of the sign of the electron spin projection onto the magnetic field direction and result in the avoided crossings of the neighboring spin-energy levels corresponding to the opposite electron spin projection signs (sublevels coming from the splitting of the hyperfine levels by a weak magnetic field). Two possible spin polarizations in each radical allow us to classify the radical-pair spin states into the four polarization types HH, HF, FH, and FF, and to link the avoided crossings of the radical-pair spin-energy levels to the electron spin flips in both radicals for the HH states and in one of the radicals for the HF and FH states (Fig. 4).\nThe flips of the HFC-polarized spins change the mutual spin alignment in the radical-pair states, as reflected in the singlet weights of the states (Fig. 5). In the states with two HFC-polarized spins, the flip of one spin occurs at a fixed polarization of the other spin. The singlet weights of the states thus vary sharply (step-wise) and contribute to the spikes in the field direction profile of the interconversion singlet yield (Fig. 6). In this simple picture of two\nHFC-polarized spins, the fixed polarization of one spin is as important as the flip of another spin for the spike to arise, underlining the exclusive role of the axial HFC in both radicals for the quantum needle effect. Formally, the spike originates from the incomplete compensation of the sharp variation in the sum of singlet weights squared if the axial HFC tensor, which defines the polarization of the spin flip, has nonzero a1 and a2 principal values, whereas the compensation is complete and the spike does not appear if a1 = a2 = 0 [Fig. 7(a)]. The jumps in HH singlet weights depend on the angle \u03b1 between the HFC axes, being maximal for the collinear axes and vanishing for the orthogonal axes (see part S3 of the supplementary material). Subsequently, the spike is maximal at \u03b1 = 0 and disappears at \u03b1 = 90\u25cb (Fig. 8).\nThe flips of the HFC-polarized spins occur in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. Therefore, in the HF and FH radical-pair states, the flip of the HFC-polarized spin occurs in the direction perpendicular to the field-polarized partner spin, so the spins remain orthogonal right before and after the flip. This means that there is no sharp change in the singlet weight due to the flip. The same is found for the HH states at the angle \u03b1 = 90\u25cb between the HFC axes. Hence, the HF and FH states, despite exhibiting the avoided spin-energy level crossings, do not contribute to the spikes in the field-direction dependency of the singlet yield (Fig. 6). The response of the HF and FH states to varying the field direction is demonstrated by a radical pair formed between a radical with the axial HFC and a radical with the isotropic or zero HFC, as, e.g., in the reference-probe model.29 For the FF polarization type, the spins of both electrons align with the magnetic field and hence with each other, so the singlet weights do not vary with the field direction, and the contribution of the field-polarized radical-pair states to the singlet yield is isotropic.\nThe radicals considered in our work possess uniquely defined HFC axes. The anisotropy of the spin system of these radicals in the magnetic field is determined by three distinct directions: those of the HFC axes and that of the magnetic field. When the HFC axes are not collinear, they define a special direction of the magnetic field orthogonal to the plane containing the two axes. A compass based on this system allows a precise bearing by orienting the radical pair in the magnetic field such that the field direction becomes special. The orientation is found when the output signals determined by the spikes in the singlet yield blend into one signal. This mechanism does not distinguish between the bearing along or opposite the direction of the magnetic field, just as the avian magnetic compass does not distinguish between the two geomagnetic poles.1 The collinear HFC axes define the plane perpendicular to the axes, and any field direction in this plane corresponds to a single spike. Such a radical pair could therefore, despite the maximal magnitude of the spike, detect a plane rather than a direction.\nThe properties of the radicals and the radical pair studied in this paper are defined by the conditions (17) and (19) on the HFC anisotropy and the magnitude of the magnetic field. Both conditions hold for the typical geomagnetic field strengths and the FAD N5 and Trp N1 HFC tensors determined by Eqs. (15) and (16), respectively. The FAD N5 and Trp N1 tensors used in the previous simulations26 satisfy these conditions equally. Moreover, the FAD N10 tensor, which determines the second largest contribution (after that of the N5 tensor) to the HFC in the radical, also fulfills the conditions (17) and (19) given the tensor values reported previously26\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 034303 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0133943 158, 034303-10\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n18 January 2024 21:16:14\nand recently.40 As the N10 tensor is almost collinear with the N5 one, we anticipate that including it in our model would retain the special direction of the magnetic field for the radical pair.\nIn describing a non-decaying radical pair, we have used a standard quantum-mechanical formalism and employed a Hilbert space of quantum states. In this respect, our considerations are less complex than, e.g., those describing the decaying radical-pair via a spin density operator41 determined in a more extended Liouville state space. The focus of our study was on the role of separate quantum states in the singlet-triplet interconversion, i.e., in the core part of the anisotropic response of a long-lived radical pair to a weak magnetic field. Although we have considered here only the simple radical-pair model, the approach presented allows for contributions of many nuclear spins to the hyperfine structure of the radicals and can be straightforwardly extended to include the inter-radical spin interactions. It may, therefore, be useful in further theoretical studies of radical-pair systems with more complex spin interactions that might be relevant to the chemical compass.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nSee the supplementary material for the results for the singlet weights of the radical-pair states and their contribution to the interconversion singlet yield."

This results in the manifold of time-dependent spin states each describing the singlet-born radical pair,\n\u2223\u03a8l1 l2(t)\u27e9 =\u2211 k1k2 exp(\u2212iEk1k2 t)\u2223k1k2\u27e9\u27e8k1k2\u2223Sl1l2\u27e9, (B2)\nwhere l1 and l2 are the nucleus spin quantum numbers of the radicals 1 and 2, respectively, and the inner product \u27e8k1k2\u2223Sl1l2\u27e9 is explicitly determined by Eq. (12). The singlet fraction is defined as the probability of finding the radical pair in a singlet state at time t and is calculated as follows:\npS(t) = (Z1Z2)\u22121\u2211 l1 l2 \u2211 l\u20321 l \u2032 2 \u2223\u27e8\u03a8l1 l2(t)\u2223Sl\u20321l\u20322\u27e9\u2223 2, (B3)\nwith Z1 and Z2 being the multiplicities of the nuclear spin states of the radicals. Expression (B3) contains the inner product with the states (B2),\n\u27e8\u03a8l1 l2(t)\u2223Sl\u20321l\u20322\u27e9 =\u2211 k1k2 \u27e8Sl1l2\u2223k1k2\u27e9\u27e8k1k2\u2223Sl\u20321l\u20322\u27e9 exp(iEk1k2 t), (B4)\nresulting in the expression\npS(t) = (Z1Z2)\u22121\u2211 l1 l2 \u2211 l\u20321 l \u2032 2 \u2211 k1k2 \u27e8Sl1l2\u2223k1k2\u27e9\u27e8k1k2\u2223Sl\u20321l\u20322\u27e9\n\u00d7\u2211 k\u20321k \u2032 2 \u27e8Sl\u20321l\u20322\u2223k\u20321k\u20322\u27e9\u27e8k\u20321k\u20322\u2223Sl1l2\u27e9 exp(i\u03c9k1k2 ,k\u20321k\u20322 t), (B5)\nwhere \u03c9k1k2 ,k\u20321k\u20322 = Ek1k2 \u2212 Ek\u20321k\u20322 . Using the completeness of the radical-pair states, \u2211k1k2 \u2223k1k2\u27e9\u27e8k1k2\u2223 = 1, and the orthonormality of the singlet basis states, \u27e8Sl1l2\u2223Sl\u20321l\u20322\u27e9 = \u03b4l1 ,l\u20321 \u03b4l2 ,l\u20322 , Eq. (B5) is readily seen to satisfy the initial condition pS(0) = 1. With varying t, the singlet fraction oscillates at frequencies \u03c9k1k2 ,k\u20321k\u20322 , and since the fraction is a real quantity, it depends on time as a superposition of the cosine functions of \u03c9k1k2 ,k\u20321k\u20322 t, cf. Ref. 27. The oscillations develop around a value that is equal to the time average of pS(t) and is referred to in this paper as the interconversion singlet yield,\n\u27e8\u03a6S\u27e9 = lim T\u2192\u221e 1 T\u222b T 0 pS(t)dt. (B6)\nWith the form (B5) for ps(t), only the terms with the zero frequencies \u03c9k1k2 ,k\u20321k\u20322 and hence independent of time contribute to Eq. (B6). When all the radical-pair states are non-degenerate, such terms are those with k\u20321 = k1 and k\u20322 = k2. In this case, the expression for the interconversion singlet yield becomes\n\u27e8\u03a6S\u27e9 = (Z1Z2)\u22121\u2211 k1k2 \u2211 l1 l2 \u27e8Sl1l2\u2223k1k2\u27e9\u27e8k1k2\u2223Sl1l2\u27e9\n\u00d7\u2211 l\u20321 l \u2032 2 \u27e8Sl\u20321l\u20322\u2223k1k2\u27e9\u27e8k1k2\u2223Sl\u20321l\u20322\u27e9, (B7)\nwhich is the explicit form of Eq. (14) along with Eq. (10)."
