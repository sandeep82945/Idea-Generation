    "abstractText": "Background: Extreme temperatures may lead to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, including low birthweight. Studies on the impact of temperature on birthweight have been inconclusive due to methodological challenges related to operationalizing temperature exposure, the definitions of exposure windows, accounting for gestational age, and a limited geographic scope. Methods: We combined data on individual-level term live births (N\u224815 million births) from urban areas in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico from 2010 to 2015 from the SALURBAL study (Urban Health in Latin America) with highresolution daily air temperature data and computed average ambient temperature for every month of gestation for each newborn. Associations between full-term birthweight and average temperature during gestation were analyzed using multi-level distributed lag non-linear models that adjusted for newborn\u2019s sex, season of conception, and calendar year of child\u2019s birth; controlled for maternal age, education, partnership status, presence of previous births, and climate zone; and included a random term for the sub-city of mother\u2019s residence. Findings: Higher temperatures during the entire gestation are associated with lower birthweight, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. The cumulative effect of temperature on birthweight is mostly driven by exposure to higher temperatures during months 7\u20139 of gestation. Higher maternal education can attenuate the temperaturebirthweight associations. Interpretation: Our work shows that climate-health impacts are likely to be contextand place-specific and warrants research on temperature and birthweight in diverse climates to adequately anticipate global climate change. Given the high societal cost of suboptimal birthweight, public health efforts should be aimed at diminishing the detrimental effect of higher temperatures on birthweight.

Studies on the impact of temperature on birthweight have been inconclusive due to methodological challenges related to operationalizing temperature exposure, the definitions of exposure windows, accounting for gestational age, and a limited geographic scope. Methods: We combined data on individual-level term live births (N\u224815 million births) from urban areas in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico from 2010 to 2015 from the SALURBAL study (Urban Health in Latin America) with highresolution daily air temperature data and computed average ambient temperature for every month of gestation for each newborn. Associations between full-term birthweight and average temperature during gestation were analyzed using multi-level distributed lag non-linear models that adjusted for newborn\u2019s sex, season of conception, and calendar year of child\u2019s birth; controlled for maternal age, education, partnership status, presence of previous births, and climate zone; and included a random term for the sub-city of mother\u2019s residence. Findings: Higher temperatures during the entire gestation are associated with lower birthweight, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. The cumulative effect of temperature on birthweight is mostly driven by exposure to higher temperatures during months 7\u20139 of gestation. Higher maternal education can attenuate the temperaturebirthweight associations. Interpretation: Our work shows that climate-health impacts are likely to be context- and place-specific and warrants research on temperature and birthweight in diverse climates to adequately anticipate global climate change. Given the high societal cost of suboptimal birthweight, public health efforts should be aimed at diminishing the detrimental effect of higher temperatures on birthweight.

The literature suggests that both hotter and colder temperatures during gestation can contribute to fetal oxidative stress and inflammation, which can reduce fetal growth and ultimately lead to lower\nbirthweight (Ferguson et al., 2018; Halonen et al., 2010; Kahle et al., 2015). Despite a growing body of literature on the impacts of temperature on birthweight, the overall results are inconclusive (Chersich et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2017; Strand et al., 2011). Some studies have shown that warmer temperatures, hot days, and higher temperature variability during pregnancy are associated with lower birthweight (Kloog et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Yitshak-Sade et al., 2020; Jakpor et al., 2020), while others have reported that colder temperatures are associated lower birthweight (Ngo and Horton, 2016; Ha et al., 2017), and still\n\u2606 This research was funded in whole, or in part, by the Wellcome Trust (awards 216029/Z/19/Z and 205177/Z/16/Z). * Corresponding author at: Institute of Urban and Regional Development, 316 Wurster Hall, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.\nE-mail address: mariab@berkeley.edu (M.

Several factors may explain these divergent results. Only recently did studies begin to routinely consider nonlinearity in the temperaturebirthweight relationship (Li et al., 2018; Yitshak-Sade et al., 2020; Jakpor et al., 2020; Yitshak-Sade et al., 2021), whereas the majority of studies have modeled the temperature-birthweight relationship linearly (Zhang et al., 2017). Most studies have used trimesters as the exposure window (Kloog et al., 2018; Ha et al., 2017; Basu et al., 2018; Bakhtsiyarava et al., 2018). However, there is currently no well-established theory on the length of exposure windows and timing of exposure most relevant to the temperature-birthweight relationship (Strand et al., 2011). Exposure measured by trimesters may introduce bias as fetal growth does not exactly follow trimesters (Wilson et al., 2017). Birthweight is a cumulative result of conditions during the entire gestational period, so it is necessary to consider exposure during the entire\ngestation. Analyses investigating each exposure window separately, as well as analyses where exposures covering the entire gestational period are specified together without an appropriate lag structure may result in incorrect identification of critical exposure windows (Wilson et al., 2017). In addition, while most recent studies explicitly account for the newborn\u2019s gestational age, earlier studies did not (Beltran et al., 2014), thus conflating term newborns who weigh little due to fetal growth retardation with premature babies who weigh little in absolute terms but have weights in accordance with their gestational age. Finally, most of the work on temperature-birthweight is from single-site studies in the Global North, while evidence from lower- and middle-income regions \u2013 such as Latin America, where the prevalence of small term babies (in terms of weight or length for gestational age) is at 11% (Lee et al., 2013) \u2013 is sparse, preventing a holistic understanding of the relationship between temperature and birthweight.\nM. Bakhtsiyarava et al.\nEnvironment International 167 (2022) 107412\nWe used unique data on all live births across 265 cities in three large countries in Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, and Chile) to describe the relationship between birthweight and ambient temperature at different points during gestation. We contribute to the prior work by (1) selecting the most appropriate form (linear vs non-linear) of the temperaturebirthweight relationship; (2) expanding the growing but still limited literature on environmental effects on birth outcomes that uses finescale exposure windows; (3) using a large live births sample from Latin America \u2013 an extremely understudied region of the world that is also characterized by different climatic patterns compared to the more researched regions of the Global North. Given the warming trends across Latin America, growing urban population, urban heat island effect, and high frequency of adverse pregnancy outcomes, this study provides important descriptive evidence regarding ambient temperature exposure and human wellbeing."

SALURBAL is an interdisciplinary multinational collaboration aimed at investigating the social and environmental determinants of health in Latin American cities (Quistberg et al., 2019). As part of SALURBAL, we obtained the live births data from the live birth registries collected by the countries\u2019 national statistical offices. Among the 11 SALURBAL countries, we included live births from Brazil, Mexico, and Chile as these countries had data on the day, month, and year of birth necessary for assigning temperature exposure. We focused on live births clustered in 909 sub-cities (Fig. 1). SALURBAL defines cities as clusters of administrative units that encompass the visually apparent urban extent or built up area of all urban agglomerations of > 100,000 residents (Quistberg et al., 2019). The administrative areas that compose cities (e.g., municipalities) are referred to as sub-cities (Quistberg et al., 2019).\nThe outcome is birthweight (in grams) for term births during 2010\u20132015. Informed by the existing literature, we extracted the following mother and child-level covariates that impact weight at birth: child\u2019s sex, mother\u2019s age (in years), education (primary, secondary, higher than secondary), partnership status (yes/no), and whether the mother had any previous births. Data on mother\u2019s smoking status and weight/height were not registered in the vital statistics where the live births come from. Term births were defined as those 38\u201341 weeks of gestation according to the categorical variable of gestational age (<28 weeks; 28\u201337 weeks; 38\u201341 weeks; >41 weeks). After excluding live births with missing data on birthweight, the length of gestational age, and other covariates (Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material), the final sample consisted of 8,079,872 live births in Brazil; 6,405,777 live births in Mexico; and 890,156 live births in Chile. Overall, the level of missingness amounted to 0.2% in the case of Chile and 9% for both Brazil and Mexico."

ERA5-Land is a global, publicly available reanalysis dataset that produces high-resolution (9x9 km) hourly meteorological data. Temperature data are described in more detail in Supplementary Material S2.

The WorldPop data can be obtained here: https://www.worldpop. org/project/list. Weighting the temperature data by population\ndistribution allowed us to obtain a more accurate measure of true temperature exposure compared to assigning temperature from the ERA5-Land grids to the entire population of a sub-city without taking into account population distribution. We also used the Ko\u0308ppen climate classification (Beck et al., 2018) that divides the Earth\u2019s main climates into groups based on temperature and dryness, and further into subgroups by seasonal patterns of precipitation (Table S4 in Supplementary Material)."

DLNMs have been widely used in temperature-mortality studies (Gasparrini, 2014) and only recently started being used in temperature-birthweight research (Jakpor et al., 2020; Yitshak-Sade et al., 2021). The DLNMs model a relationship between a time-varying exposure (average temperature at every month of gestation) and outcome measured a single time (birthweight). The DLNMs are particularly relevant when a health outcome measured at a particular time is the result of cumulative exposure over time \u2013 which is the case for birthweight. For every lag period, the lag-response component of the DLNMs models the non-linear association between temperature and birthweight in each exposure window (e.g., month of gestation) while adjusting for exposure that occurred over all the other months. This feature of the DLNMs is particularly advantageous for an analysis of temperature and birthweight because there is no unified theory on which period during gestation is most critical for the health of a newborn. The model also yields an estimate of the pregnancy-wide cumulative association between temperature and birthweight."

            "text": "To choose an optimal functional form of the temperaturebirthweight association, we estimated a series of multi-level distributed lag models: (1) a model that estimated the relationship between temperature exposure and birthweight linearly; and (2) non-linear models with varied placement of the knots for modeling the nonlinear temperature-birthweight association. Please refer to Supplementary Material S3 for model specification details for this step. After estimating these linear and non-linear models with different functional forms of the temperature-birthweight associations, we selected the final model as one with the overall best fit as indicated by smallest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Gasparrini, 2014). A non-linear model was statistically preferred based on the AIC comparison. Therefore, the final model specified birthweight as a function of average temperature during each month of gestation with natural cubic splines with internal knots at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the country-specific temperature, as favored by the AIC comparison approach and because of their wide use in the literature (Gasparrini et al., 2015). The lagresponse curve was modeled with natural cubic splines with knots at months 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 for every pregnancy.\nFor each term newborn we modelled term birthweight as a continuous outcome variable with temperature as the primary predictor described above. We estimated separate models for every country\nM. Bakhtsiyarava et al.\nEnvironment International 167 (2022) 107412\nbecause the distribution of temperature and birthweight differed by country, which could result in country-specific patterns in the temperature-birthweight relationship. We adjusted for newborn\u2019s sex, season of conception, calendar year of child\u2019s birth, and controlled for the following maternal characteristics: categorical age, education, partnership status, presence of previous births, and climate zone. Births were clustered within sub-cities by including a random intercept for the sub-city of mother\u2019s residence.\nFor displaying the results, we use 19 \u25e6C as a reference temperature\u2014average temperature across all sub-cities in the study. The estimates relative to each country\u2019s average temperature are reported in Supplementary Material Table S9 and Fig. S10. Having a single reference temperature enables us to compare associations within and between countries. For the cumulative associations, we estimate a difference in birthweight at a given country-specific temperature percentile (5th, 50th, 95th) compared to the reference temperature. For the monthly exposures, we estimate difference in birthweight associated with a 5-degree higher temperature in a given gestational month compared to the reference temperature (19 \u25e6C).\nModels were also stratified by infant sex and by maternal education (separate stratifications) to examine the potential differential effects by these factors. Maternal education as an indicator of a mother\u2019s socioeconomic position can be reflective of her access to and use of prenatal care, diet during pregnancy, and timing of fertility, all of which can impact birthweight (Silvestrin et al., 2013). Because of the small number of live births to mothers in the lowest education category (less than primary) we combined this category with live births to mothers who did not complete secondary education to facilitate the estimation of the stratified models. Since testing interactions of the non-linear temperature-birthweight associations and other factors is not straightforward in the non-linear distributed lag models, we instead examined whether the stratified models improve model fit. We compared the AIC of the primary model (where sex/education is modeled as a categorical predictor) to the sum of the AIC from the stratified models. When the AIC of the primary model is higher, stratification yields better fit. Model estimation was done using the \u201cdlnm\u201d package of the R Environment for Statistical Computing (Gasparrini et al., 2010)."

            "text": "As mentioned above, we included live births within 38\u201341 weeks of gestation because of how the categorical variable on gestational age was coded. The data on gestational age for Mexico and Chile were available in weeks but it was not available for Brazil. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for Mexico and Chile as these countries had data on gestational age in weeks and included births at 37, 39, 40, 41, and 42 weeks. The DLNMs require that all live births have the same time lags in the model structure, which precluded us from estimating a pooled model with varying gestational age. To deal with that complication, we estimated models using 10 months (42 weeks) as the main exposure period; for those births occurring before 42 weeks we assigned exposure in the missing weeks using temperature from the last observed week. This sensitivity analysis is similar to that in Jakpor et al. (Jakpor et al., 2020).\nWe also conducted the following sensitivity checks: an analysis for nulliparous mothers; an analysis based on the continuous variable of gestational age (available for Mexico and Chile); modeling average temperature for every month during the three-month preconception period, in addition to the main gestation period; repeated the main analysis for live births stratified by climate zone and the patterns of inter-annual temperature variability."

We observe a similar pattern for Mexico except that associations of lower temperature with higher birthweight are statistically significant: relative to a gestationaverage of 19 \u25e6C, gestation-average temperature in the 5th percentile of Mexico\u2019s temperature distribution (p50 = 11.9 \u25e6C) is associated with an 8.87-gram (95% CI: 2.72; 15.01) higher birthweight. For most of the temperature range in Chile we do not observe statistically significant associations, though point estimates suggest that lower temperatures (below 19 \u25e6C) are associated with lower birthweight. A gestationaverage temperature in the 50th percentile of Chile temperature distribution (p50 = 14.2 \u25e6C) is associated with 26.38-gram lower birthweight (95% CI: \u2212 47.92; \u2212 4.85), compared to the 19 \u25e6C-reference. In sum, for the cumulative associations, average monthly temperatures during gestation that are higher than 19 \u25e6C are generally associated with lower birthweight, whereas most estimates for the temperatures lower than the reference (19 \u25e6C) are not statistically significant."

In Mexico, higher temperatures during the first two months of gestation are associated with higher birthweight, but toward the end of gestation, particularly, in months 7 through 9, higher temperatures are associated with lower birthweight. The magnitude of these month-specific associations in Mexico is similar to that in Brazil. No statistically significant associations are observed in Chile, which is the coldest country in our sample (Fig. 4)."

For the highest temperatures, we observe associations between temperature and birthweight that are larger in magnitude among the women in the lowest educational strata (Table 3 and Fig. 5).

Our results show that higher temperatures (relative to the 19 \u25e6C reference) during gestation are associated with lower birthweight, particularly in Mexico and Brazil, after accounting for newborn and maternal characteristics, seasonality, and climate zone. This potential cumulative effect of warmer temperatures on birthweight is mostly driven by stronger temperaturebirthweight associations during the last months of gestation. The associations between higher temperatures and lower birthweight were of greater magnitude during months 7\u20139 of gestation, particularly in Brazil and Mexico, where warmer temperatures are more common. We found no sex differences in the temperature-birthweight association, but maternal education may modify the association \u2013 the results suggest that higher levels of maternal education attenuate the negative temperaturebirthweight association observed especially at very high temperatures (95th percentiles of country-specific average monthly temperatures).\nEvident from the estimates for Brazil and Mexico, we mostly observe statistically significant negative associations between temperature and birthweight for warm (in absolute terms) temperatures. Chile is the coldest country in our sample, so one potential explanation for the lack of statistically significant associations between higher temperatures and birthweight in Chile is that air temperature there does not reach levels high enough to trigger a physiological response affecting birthweight. The absence of statistically significant negative associations between lower-than-average temperatures and birthweight compared to the statistically significant estimates observed for average temperatures (Table 2) may suggest adaptation to cooler temperatures in Chile. Moreover, babies in Chile might be better protected from the detrimental effect of warm temperatures given the high levels of access to prenatal medical care and overall better socioeconomic conditions evidenced by lower maternal and infant mortality and higher human development index, compared to Mexico and Brazil. (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, 2021) This finding emphasizes the importance of considering location-specific climate impacts and the need to conduct analyses of temperature-birthweight relationships in diverse climates."

While not large from an individual-level perspective, these differences may decrease the average birthweight at the population level and lead to a higher prevalence of term low birthweight. We estimate that, should the average monthly temperature increase by 5 \u25e6C in Mexico relative to its current levels, the average birthweight would decrease by 13 g.

In addition to these public health considerations, studies have shown that a 10% increase in birthweight is associated with a 0.9% increase in earnings and 1.2% increase in high school graduation (Black et al., 2007).

For example, studies from the U.S. by Ha et al. (2017) and Yitshak-Sade et al. (2021) found that high temperatures during the last trimester or the last few weeks of gestation are associated with lower birthweight. Our results identified critical exposure windows in months 7\u20139 of pregnancy, which agrees with these studies, even though they assessed the relationship using different exposure windows (trimesters and weeks). The nonlinearity of the temperature-birthweight association is also in line with results from previous work. Li et al. found that, compared to maternal exposure to maximum temperature above 30 \u25e6C, exposure to 20\u201325 \u25e6C was associated with 11-g (95% CI 8;18) higher birthweight (Li et al., 2018). Similarly, Yitshak-Sade et al. (2021) revealed a non-linear association between average weekly temperature during gestation and birthweight, with the temperature effect sustained at the end of gestation.\nIt should be noted that none of these prior studies were conducted in Latin America, so we are not comparing studies from areas with similar political, socioeconomic, and climatic conditions. Moreover, because our study relied on distributed lag models, which so far have been rarely used in this line of work, our results and the results from other studies using different methods are not directly comparable. One exception is a recent study by Jakpor et al. (2020) on a cohort of term births in France, which showed that weather variability (standard deviation) of weekly temperature during pregnancy is associated with decreases in birthweight, while mean weekly temperature is not. Like our study, Jakpor et al. used distributed lag models, but the AIC comparison approach in their case favored a linear form of the temperature-birthweight relationship, and they also focused on a shorter timescale \u2013 weeks. Another study that utilized the same class of models (distributed lag nonlinear) is a U.S.-based study by Yitshak-Sade et al. (2021) discussed above."

Pregnant women have a limited ability to thermoregulate because of the increased metabolic demands of pregnancy.

In addition, heat stress can trigger the production of heat-shock proteins that have been associated with preeclampsia and preterm birth, which are closely related to fetal growth retardation and low birthweight, respectively (Beltran et al., 2014). Another potential explanation is the rise in inflammatory, hemostatic, and lipid markers during heat exposure that could lead to hypertension and diabetes during pregnancy and eventually to lower birthweight (Wells and Cole, 2002). Overall, the literature suggests that any inflammatory pathway associated with non-optimal temperatures could trigger fetal growth retardation and ultimately lower birthweight."

However, these studies are from different locations than ours \u2013 USA and France, and, while Jakpor et al.

More evidence is needed to make a conclusive statement regarding differential susceptibility among male and female newborns. Though not many studies analyzed temperature-birthweight association by mother\u2019s education, our finding of greater susceptibility to warmer temperatures for mothers with low education is in line with other work (Yitshak-Sade et al., 2021). Mothers with higher educational attainment may have better resources for prenatal care, nutrition, and living/working conditions, which are recognized protective factors against low birthweight. In addition, higher maternal education is closely related to a better socioeconomic status and adequate living conditions, which might minimize exposure to heat during pregnancy."

            "text": "Our study is innovative in several ways. First, the use of distributed lag non-linear models allowed us to specify the most appropriate and data-driven functional form of the temperature-birthweight relationship. The lagged structure of the exposure\u2013response association allowed us to identify critical exposure windows during gestation while accounting for exposure in the other months. This is an important contribution given that (1) only recently did studies routinely begin to consider non-linearity and the lagged structure of exposure\u2013response in studies of temperature and birthweight (Li et al., 2018; Yitshak-Sade et al., 2020; Jakpor et al., 2020); (2) the existing studies have been heterogeneous with respect to whether they model temperature exposure over the entire gestation or only focus on selected periods (Li et al., 2018; Basu et al., 2018). Birthweight is a cumulative result of conditions during the entire gestation, so focusing on select time periods \u2013 as opposed to exposure windows that cover the entire gestational period \u2013 may provide an incomplete picture of the temperature conditions relevant to birthweight. Second, this study is one of the few multi-site studies of temperature and birthweight. By including multiple cities with different climatic conditions, our analysis presents more robust evidence for the association between temperature and birthweight. Third, this study also extends the geographic scope of our knowledge on birthweight. So far, most studies have focused on countries in the Global North and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Latin America is extremely underrepresented in this research; two recent reviews of epidemiologic evidence on the association between temperature and pregnancy outcomes did not include/identify a single study on temperature and birthweight from Latin America (Chersich et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2017).

            "heading": "5. Limitations",
            "text": "Our study is not without limitations. First, the temperature exposure variables are ecological and represent an approximation of women\u2019s actual exposure to temperature, which is in turn determined by how much time they spend outside, their activity patterns, and the use of air conditioning inside. As such, exposure misclassification could be present in the study. We suspect this potential misclassification to be nondifferential as ambient temperature at 2 m above surface is assigned to women independent of factors that could modify their actual exposure (e.g., the use of air conditioning). Relatedly, temperature exposure measured at sub-city level or another spatial unit (as opposed to measuring it at women\u2019s residential address) is also conceptually appropriate if one thinks of potential population-level interventions (e. g., those that address climate change or other area-level interventions like greening) to minimize exposure to heat. Second, we did not have information on mothers\u2019 moves to other addresses prior to giving birth. However, three factors may alleviate the implications of the absence of this information on the results: 1) On average, residential mobility during pregnancy is often local and is unlikely to result in a drastically different temperature exposure (Bell and Belanger, 2012); 2) Most women do not move, though an estimated 9\u201332% may move (Bell and Belanger, 2012; Chen et al., 2010); 3) New residential location is unlikely chosen on its temperature regime, so the misclassification error is\nnon-differential. Research on the impact of residential mobility during pregnancy on the measurement of air pollution exposure (we did not identify studies that used temperature as exposure) concluded that the results from studies that did not consider residential mobility during pregnancy were robust to that omission (Warren et al., 2018). The third limitation refers to how gestational age was measured. In Brazil and Chile, gestational age was determined based on 1) women\u2019s last menstrual period or 2) the 1st trimester ultrasound if the data on the last menstrual period was not available. For Mexico gestational age was based on the Capurro exam. Early-pregnancy ultrasound is currently the most accurate way to determine gestational age, and pregnancy dating based on the recall of the last menstrual period or a clinical assessment of newborns tend to overestimate gestational age (Lee et al., 2017). As such, weekly exposure windows based on the gestational age data in our sample would likely be off by a few weeks, with implications for the accuracy of temperature exposure. Monthly exposure windows may be more robust to this misspecification. Relatedly, the continuous gestational age variable was available for Mexico and Chile but not for Brazil, and we relied on the categorical variable in the main text for consistency. Fifth, while air pollution is associated with lower birthweight (Yitshak-Sade et al., 2021), we did not control for it because temperature plays a role in the formation and quantity of air pollutants (Buckley et al., 2014; Reid et al., 2012); therefore air pollution may be on the causal path between temperature and birthweight (Jakpor et al., 2020). Sixth, data on whether the live births were a result of multiple gestation were not available. According to the estimates of the rates of multiple gestation in the countries of interest, as much as 10% of our sample may represent non-singleton births (Smits et al., 2011). We were also not able to collect information about mother\u2019s health behavior pre- and during pregnancy, such as smoking status, BMI, alcohol drinking habits, diabetes, or hypertension, which can contribute to fetal growth retardation.\nM. Bakhtsiyarava et al.\nEnvironment International 167 (2022) 107412\nThe study may lose power due to not adjusting for these important predictors of birthweight. However, not adjusting for these factors is unlikely to result in confounding bias. Conditioning on term births may have created collider bias. We adjusted for common causes of prematurity and low birthweight including education, age and birth order but cannot rule out the possibility of collider bias. Finally, our conclusions can only be applied to live births as our study did not consider outcomes such as still births, miscarriages, and abortions."
