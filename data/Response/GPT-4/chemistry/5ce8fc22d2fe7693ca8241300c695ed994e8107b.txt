Exploration of CBEO in Other Cancer Types: Given CBEO's effectiveness against melanoma cells, further studies could explore its cytotoxic effects on other types of cancer cells. This research could help determine if CBEO has broad-spectrum anticancer properties or if its effects are specific to certain cancer types, potentially opening up new therapeutic avenues for cancers with limited treatment options.

Mechanistic Studies on (Z)-2-lachnophyllum Ester (EZ): The major compound in CBEO, EZ, shows promising interaction with key proteins involved in cancer cell survival and death. Future research could focus on in-depth mechanistic studies to understand how EZ interacts with these proteins at the molecular level, potentially leading to the development of new, targeted cancer therapies.

Combination Therapy Potential of CBEO: Investigating the potential of CBEO as part of combination therapy with existing chemotherapeutic agents could be valuable. This research would aim to evaluate if CBEO can enhance the efficacy of current treatments, reduce side effects, or overcome chemoresistance by targeting multiple pathways involved in cancer progression.

Development of CBEO-based Drug Delivery Systems: The development of novel drug delivery systems (such as nanoparticles, liposomes, or hydrogels) encapsulating CBEO or EZ could enhance its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy while minimizing potential toxicity. Research could focus on optimizing these delivery systems for targeted cancer therapy.

Clinical Trials of CBEO or EZ in Cancer Treatment: Building on preclinical studies, the next step would involve conducting clinical trials to assess the safety, optimal dosing, and therapeutic efficacy of CBEO or EZ in humans. This research is crucial for translating laboratory findings into a clinically relevant cancer treatment option.
