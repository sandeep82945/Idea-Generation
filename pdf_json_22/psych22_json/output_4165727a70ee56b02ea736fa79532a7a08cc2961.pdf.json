    "abstractText": "Objective To evaluate perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in women considering or undergoing fertility treatment. Materials and methods Cross-sectional anonymous survey (n= 3558) from a single academic fertility center. A total of 1103 patients completed the survey (response rate = 31% of those emailed, 97.6% of those who opened the email). Participants were randomized 1:1 to a one-page educational graphic providing facts and benefits regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Assessment of vaccine hesitancy was conducted via the Medical Mistrust Index (MMI). Mental health was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results The majority of participants were married, nulliparous, white women with > 1 year of infertility and moderate to severe distress. As compared to the non-intervention group, participants in the intervention group believed that COVID-19 vaccination does not cause genetic abnormalities in a fetus (98.0% v. 94.2%) and infertility (99% v. 96.2%) and that severe infection has been associated with pregnancy (81.3% v. 74.6%) (P <0.05). Higher MMI scores were associated with vaccine hesitancy (P = 0.01), higher GAD-7 scores (P = 0.01), and greater concerns about side effects of the vaccine (P < 0.05). GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores were not associated with vaccine hesitancy. Nearly a quarter of participants initiated psychiatric treatment after March 2020. Conclusion Vaccine hesitancy was associated with mistrust of the medical system. Psychological distress was highly prevalent in this study. Efforts should be made to improve patient trust and provide psychological support for fertility patients.",

Since 2020, nearly 50 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the USA alone, with close to 800,000 deaths. By early 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized\nthe emergent use of three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the USA (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson). None of these vaccines have been shown to have adverse pregnancy-related outcomes or infant adverse outcomes in vaccination trials and thus pregnant and postpartum women, as well as women attempting to conceive, were encouraged to receive the vaccine [1, 2].\nSince the onset of the pandemic, multiple studies have demonstrated that pregnant women who are COVID-19 positive have an increased risk of severe infection [1\u20133]. Pregnant women with COVID-19 have been shown to be 3 times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and require respiratory support compared to non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Symptomatic pregnant women with COVID-19 have also been reported to have a 70% increased risk of death compared to non-pregnant women with COVID-19 with pregnant women of color having a * MaryEllen Pavone m-pavone@northwestern.edu 1 Department of\u00a0Obstetrics and\u00a0Gynecology, Division of\u00a0Reproductive Endocrinology and\u00a0Infertility, Northwestern University, 259 E. Erie Suite 2400, Chicago, IL\u00a060611, USA\n1 3\ngreater risk of death from COVID-19 than pregnant white women [3, 4]. There have also been reports of increased stillbirth and preterm delivery associated with COVID-19 infections in pregnancy [5].\nAs a result of the significant risks of the COVID-19 virus in pregnant women and the safety of the vaccines (which was supported by limited research at the time of vaccine availability), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), and the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM) issued a joint statement in February 2021 and recommended COVID-19 vaccination for women who were trying to conceive or who were pregnant [6]. However, despite these recommendations, anecdotal stories of women and men who feared that vaccination could directly harm their chances of conceiving or cause negative pregnancy outcomes began to be shared through social media [7]. To date, no study has identified an association between COVID-19 vaccination and infertility in either men or women and COVID-19 vaccination has not been shown to increase the risk of miscarriage or other pregnancy risks and is therefore considered safe in pregnancy [3\u20135, 8\u201310].\nIn addition to unfounded concerns related to the effects of the COVID-19 vaccines on reproduction, distrust of information about the vaccines from healthcare systems and organizations has also resulted in vaccine hesitancy [11, 12]. Medical mistrust is defined as the extent to which an individual or a community demonstrates a lack of trust in the healthcare system, medical scientists, and government health agencies, as well as doctors or other healthcare professionals [11]. Medical mistrust has previously been shown to affect vaccine hesitancy (e.g., influenza vaccine hesitancy) and shown to be higher among racial and ethnic minority groups, especially among Black individuals [12]. Cultural mistrust of medical systems is another factor that is likely contributing to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 within the Black community [13]. Cultural medical mistrust has been attributed to the tendency to mistrust traditional medical institutions, which is deeply rooted in inequalities in medical treatment and unethical/abusive historical medical research (e.g., the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment) and has been linked to COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy among the Black community [13].\nIn addition to individuals in the Black community, the emergent approval of the COVID-19 vaccines was met by vaccine hesitancy among several groups of individuals. For example, vaccination rates were shown to be lower among individuals under the age of 50, in women, Black individuals, and among people without a college degree [14]. In addition to anxiety related to the pandemic and vaccines, high levels of psychological distress were also found among people of color and other minority communities due to ongoing experiences of racism and discrimination [11].\nHigh levels of distress were also seen among patients trying to conceive during the pandemic because of the effect of the pandemic on their lives in general, but also specifically related to their chances of conceiving. Fertility treatments were paused for several months in the early 2020 and delays in restarting treatment were also reported. It is generally accepted that fertility patients often report high levels of distress related to infertility and delays in fertility care due to the pandemic appear to have intensified that distress [15, 16]. Patients undergoing fertility treatment have also been reported to alter their behaviors (e.g., lifestyle habits) in order to maximize their chances of conceiving [17]. Concerns related to the COVID-19 vaccine and negative reproductive-related side effects could therefore lead to reduced acceptance of the vaccine and increased health risks during pregnancy. Indeed, a study published prior to the availability of the COVID-19 vaccines in fertility patients showed that few women were open to future receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine [18].\nThis study aimed to assess the perception of COVID-19 vaccination in a large population of women undergoing or planning on undergoing fertility treatments at a time when COVID-19 vaccines were available for use. A secondary goal of the study was to assess if providing a one page educational graphic would affect COVID-19 vaccination beliefs."

After the randomization with the educational handout section, participants answered a set of questions about vaccine receipt and beliefs that were created by the study authors (see Table\u00a01). As summarized in Table\u00a01, questions included (1) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the participant\u2019s employment, (2) previous or current COVID-19 infection, (3) previous hospitalization due to COVID-19 or if a loved one died from COVID-19, (4) concerns that the COVID-19 vaccine has potential risks on future pregnancy (e.g., leading to a miscarriage or genetically abnormal fetus, (5) concerns that COVID-19 vaccination can negatively impact fertility and/or the ability to get pregnant, and (6) concerns that COVID-19 vaccination would cause genetically abnormalities in vaccine recipients or (7) in a fetus if administered to a pregnant woman. Additionally, questions assessed participants\u2019 knowledge regarding (8) clinically proven more severe COVID-19 infection in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women as well as (9) in women of color, specifically Black or Latina women."

Although research conducted prior to introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines indicated that the majority of fertility patients would not get the vaccine, results of our study showed that the majority of respondents did receive the vaccine.

Given that research on unvaccinated individuals shows that increased information and research about the vaccines could positively influence vaccination, it is likely that new information and research during the months preceding our study influenced the uptake in vaccinations [25]. Additionally, the high level of education in our population could explain such a trend as it may be that this group of women have greater access to accurate, evidence-based information and sources related to COVID-19.\nAlthough new data about vaccine safety likely influenced the increased acceptance of the vaccine for some, that new data may not change the beliefs of those who distrust the scientific bodies generating that new information. By June 2021, it was reported that up to 65% of Americans over the age of 18 received at least one vaccine dose [25]. However, vaccination rates among pregnant people have been lower, with population data from the CDC showing that as of January 1st 2022, only approximately 40% of pregnant women between the age of 18 and 49 had been fully vaccinated either prior to pregnancy or antenatally. For Black pregnant patients, the number was even lower, at 25% which may suggest the greater presence of medical mistrust and thus vaccine hesitancy among these patients [26].\nAmong the risk factors related to medical mistrust and vaccine hesitancy, race and ethnicity, especially within the Black/African American community, have been reported to be strongly associated with general vaccine hesitancy (e.g., influenza vaccine hesitancy) in the USA [23, 27, 28]. Historically, medical mistrust in the Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) population is triggered by factual historical root causes, particularly unethical practices during clinical trials [13]. Vaccine hesitancy among specific populations such as Latina/Hispanic and Black individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively affect these populations, with these groups experiencing more severe COVID-19 illness in pregnancy, including higher intensive care unit admissions and even death [3, 4, 13, 23]. These disparate beliefs about vaccines could also potentially propagate long-term racial health inequalities with patients who do not receive the vaccine having greater risks to morbidity and mortality when exposed to the COVD-19 virus.\nDespite prior research finding a relationship between race and vaccine hesitancy, our study did not show any significantly statistical differences in vaccine hesitancy based on race or other demographic or fertility treatment-related variables except for education. However, our findings may be limited by the demographically homogenous sample in our\nstudy, with a highly educated group of primarily married White women (77.1%) and only 4.4% of respondents being Hispanic/Latina and Black/African American participants. Additionally, even though we found that the educational intervention was not associated with vaccine hesitancy, which may be due to the majority of respondents being vaccine receptive, it was associated with a small but significant increase in knowledge related to the vaccine. Because we did not conduct a pre-intervention assessment of vaccine receptivity, we do not know if this difference in knowledge was related to the intervention or some other factor. However, given that there were no significant demographic differences between the intervention and no-intervention groups, it is reasonable to hypothesize that group differences in knowledge were influenced by the intervention; this remains to be further explored in the future. With this limitation in mind, it may be that education about the safety of the vaccines may aid in improving vaccine knowledge for those who trust the source of the scientific data but not for those exhibiting distrust of the medical/scientific systems conducting or promoting the research-driven data.\nInterestingly, we also found that higher scores on the Medical Mistrust Index were associated with both vaccine hesitancy and psychological distress. In our study, participants were found to be distressed since the beginning of the pandemic, with almost a quarter of women reporting an initiation of mental health treatment due to anxiety and/or depression. Higher levels of anxiety were associated with greater mistrust in the medical system though the direction of the relationship is unclear. Our study supports the idea that reducing psychological distress but also mistrust in the healthcare system could potentially have a positive impact on COVID-19 vaccination.\nOverall results of our study showing that education and psychological distress are associated with mistrust and vaccine hesitancy as well as prior research on vaccine hesitancy [7, 11, 12, 22, 28, 9] suggest that a multi-pronged approach is needed to improve use of vaccines in the future including (1) data driven education about the risks and safety of the vaccine that is transparent and acknowledges the limits to these data, (2) efforts to decrease medical mistrust through avenues such as collaboration between medical teams and trusted community organizations, shared-decision making, racially diverse medical teams, and the development of strong patient-provider relationships all of which must be contextualized within the history of racism in the USA [28], and (3) assessment of patients for psychological distress and provision of emotional support to those experiencing distress in order to reduce distress and potentially improve vaccine acceptance.\nSome of the strengths of our study is its large sample size and the inclusion of a randomized educational intervention as well as the utilization of validated questionnaires\n1 3\nto measure depression, anxiety, and medical mistrust. Our study also highlights the unique experiences of infertility patients related to vaccine perceptions and vaccine hesitancy over a discreet period of time when the COVID-19 vaccine was available. This study also uniquely highlighted the relationship between increased anxiety and higher medical mistrust, which clinically allows for potential ways to intervene on and identify at risk patients who might need more counseling and education regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Limitations of our study include the selection of patients from a single academic center with an overall demographically homogenous sample with a high vaccination rate. However, this study included a large sample size and is currently the only study to assess the effect of supplemental education on acceptance of vaccines and medical mistrust. Replication of this study at another institution with potentially a more diverse patient population and with lower rates of vaccination could, however, provide additional information about vaccine hesitancy among different racial and ethnic groups.\nGiven the unpredictable trend of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing risk of emerging highly contagious and even more virulent variants as well as future unrelated pandemics, reducing mistrust and addressing emotional distress are essential to future acceptance of vaccination. Such care delivered in a team-based approach by both mental health providers and physicians is crucial in providing empathetic and exceptional care to this patient population.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10815- 022- 02641-7."
