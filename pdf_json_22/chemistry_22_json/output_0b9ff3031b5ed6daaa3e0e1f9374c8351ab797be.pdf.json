Current sensor detection methods are harsh due to the shortcomings of antibody preparation and preservation conditions. Therefore, developing a recognition material with strong specificity, good stability, and low cost is of practical significance in designing a sensitive, simple, and rapid method. This study used precipitation polymerization to synthesize molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). The MIP was prepared into a fiber membrane using the electrostatic spinning method. After that, the fenvalerate hapten-mouse IgG-Eu fluorescent probe was synthesized, and the side flow chromatography strip was constructed to determine fenvalerate in vegetables using the immunocompetition method. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of MIP to fenvalerate was 3.65, and the adsorption capacity on MIPFM (an electrospinning membrane containing the fenvalerate MIPs) was five times that of free MIP. The test strip showed good linearity with R2 = 0.9761 within the range of 50 \u00b5g/L-1,000 \u00b5g/L. In conclusion, substituting fenvalerate monoclonal antibodies with a molecularly imprinted electrospinning membrane is ideal for rapid onsite detection of pyrethroids.\nKEYWORDS\nfenvalerate, molecularly imprinted polymer, electrospinning membrane, test strip, fluorescence\nFrontiers inNutrition 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Pyrethroid pesticides have the broadest spectrum of high efficiency, low residue, moderate toxicity, and are biodegradable in plants. It effectively prevents and controls the storage of insect pests and has become the preferred pesticide in today\u2019s agriculture (1, 2). Type II pyrethroid pesticides have good efficacy and stability and are widely used to protect crops against insects. The highest detection rate was reported in crops, followed by sediment, soil, and water. M-phenoxybenzoic acid (3 PBA) is a common metabolite of several pyrethroid insecticides (3). In addition, studies have shown that pyrethroids can trigger immune disorders, which may seriously impact the occurrence of immune-related diseases (4). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor pyrethroids in agri-products. Many countries and agencies have set tolerance or maximum residue limits (MRL) for pyrethroids based on the potential impact of a pesticide on humans, referred to as risk assessment. For instance, in the EU, the MRL of fenvalerate in vegetables ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 mg/kg. In the Codex Alimentarius (CAS), the MRL of fenvalerate in vegetables ranged from 0.05 to 3.0 mg/kg. In Japan, the MRL of fenvalerate in vegetables ranged from 0.05 to 3.0 mg/kg. In the Republic of Korea, the MRL in vegetables ranged from 0.05 to 10.0 mg/kg, whereas in China, the MRL in vegetables ranged from 0.05 to 10.0mg/kg. As they are lipophilic, their absorption in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts is higher than on the skin. They are also transmitted directly and indirectly through the food chain and eventually threaten human health and life (5).\nAt present, pyrethroids are detected by various techniques, including chromatography (6\u20138), liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (9\u201311), and immunological methods (12). Chromatography-mass spectrometry is mostly used as a confirmation method due to the separation power of chromatography combined with the high selectivity of mass spectrometry. It is a high-throughput hyphenated technique that can detect multiple analytes in a single run. However, the sample preparation is time-consuming, and the equipment is expensive and requires professional personnel to operate. Immunoassays (IAs) are bioanalytical techniques that measure enzymes and proteins quantitatively and qualitatively using a combination of antigens and antibodies. Conversely, the immunochromatographic assay is an analytical method that combines immunotechnology and chromatography using fluorescent substances or colloidal gold (13, 14) labels. It is widely used in various fields. However, pyrethroids are small molecules that do not trigger an immune response. Preparing antibodies in the mouse body and optimizing storage conditions increase the cost and necessitate the sacrifice of animals. Therefore, to meet the demand for large-scale assessments, it is necessary to establish a fast, sensitive, accurate, and low-cost onsite analysis to monitor food pyrethroids (15).\nMolecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have an affinity for the predetermination and specific identification of a molecule in addition to their practicability. The polymer has a simple preparation process, low-cost, good mechanical and chemical stability, and long service life to satisfy the features of a specific recognition material with reasonable practicability (16\u2013 19). For instance, Azizollah Nezhadali et al. (17) prepared a selective molecularly imprinted polymer-based solid-phase extraction (MISPE) by bulk polymerization using fenvalerate as a template and polypyrrole (PPy) as a monomer. The detection and quantification limits of this method were 0.19 ng/g and 0.63 ng/g, respectively, with a relative standard deviation of 4.07%. The method is simple and utilizes the minimum solvent volume, replacing the traditional sample preparation. Furthermore, Wang et al. (20) established a highly selective and sensitive photochemical sensor, CdTe QDS-MIP, fixed on a paper-based working electrode to determine fenvalerate in fruits and vegetables. This method has higher photocurrent transfer efficiency and the advantages of simplicity, speed, and low cost compared with pure CdTe QDs. Moreover, Wang et al. (21) developed a method for the selective identification and detection of \u03bb-cyhalothrin with 5-isothiocyanate (6) (FITC) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS)/SiO2 combined with fluorescent MIP. This method eliminates the interfering substances in the sample and improves the detection limit. Due to its excellent properties, MIP has been used as a direct substitute for natural antibodies, receptors, and enzymes in submolecular biology (22). In this study, MIP was directly immobilized on a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane by streaking, and it flowed away with the solution. Therefore, a relatively fixed method is needed to firmly stabilize the MIP particles on the NC membrane. Electrospinning is a non-mechanical electrostatic technique that can spin nanofibers directly from the polymer solution (23). The obtained fiber has the advantages of a large specific surface area, high porosity, fast mass transfer rate, and easy separation (24\u201327). For instance, Xing et al. developed an atrazine (ATZ) molecularly imprinted nanofiber membrane based on electrospinning. The membrane has a large specific surface area, enhanced rebinding ability, and selective permeability of ATZ, as well as having strong practicability for separating ATZ in water samples (28). Furthermore, Ruggieri et al. synthesized MIPs using ATZ as a template and dispersed MIPs in an electrospinning solution dissolved in polystyrene to prepare a molecularly imprinted electrospun nanofiber membrane (MIM). The adsorption evaluation of ATZ, ATZ metabolites atalido-deisopropyl, carboxylin, linuron, atraton, and chlorpyrifos was carried out in distilled and river water. Compared with the adsorption capacity of MIP for these five pesticides, the adsorption capacity of MIM significantly increased (37). In addition, under low pesticide concentrations, the efficiency of commercial SPE was higher than that of the MIM prepared in this study; however, for\nFrontiers inNutrition 02 frontiersin.org\ncomplex matrices and high concentrations, MIM can replace commercial products well.\nIn our previous study, we developed a test strip based on surface molecularly imprinted electrospun affinity membranes to detect triazophos residues in water. We prepared the test line on a nitrocellulose membrane using a molecularly imprinted electrospinning technique. Then, we synthesized a triazophos hepten-murine IgG/fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (THBu-IgG-FITC) to directly compete with the target triazophos on the molecularly imprinted binding sites (29). However, the Stokes shift of the ordinary fluorescent group was 1\u2013100 nm, the fluorescence lifetime was short, and quenching was easy, for example, for fluorescence quantum dots (30, 31). In comparison, time-resolved fluorescence immunoassays used trivalent rare-earth ions\u2014such as Eu (III), Tb (III), and Sm (III)\u2014as markers. These ions can produce high-intensity fluorescence and decay for a long time. Accordingly, short-delay measurement and interference with natural fluorescence can be eliminated, significantly improving the method\u2019s sensitivity (32, 33). It should be noted that the preparation of antibodies for pyrethroids is complicated; therefore, few strips can be used for rapid onsite detection. It is worth noting that there is no literature on the combination of molecularly imprinted electrospun nanofiber membranes and time-resolved fluorescence microspheres Eu. Hence, this study established a rapid determination method using a biomimetic immunoassay based on molecularly imprinted recognition material for the rapid and sensitive detection of fenvalerate in Brussels sprouts, cucumbers, and eggplants. Herein, timeresolved fluorescent latex microspheres Eu were labeled with a conjugate of fenvalerate hapten-IgG (FH-IgG). It competed with the pyrethroid molecule in the sample to bind specific binding sites on the MIPs. The method was evaluated from the quantitative standard curve, detection limit, linear range, and actual examples by exploring the assembly of the biomimetic immunofluorescence strip. The findings were compared with the results of GC\u2013MS/MS."

The fluorescence was sprayed on the mat at a speed of 0.5 \u00b5L/mm by the injector and then dried in the oven at 37\u25e6C for further use.\nGoat-mouse IgG was coated on a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane as a control (C) line by an HM3030 XYZ 3Dmembrane spraying instrument (Shanghai Jieyi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at a proper jetting rate. The coated membrane and sample pad treated with blocking buffer were dried overnight at 37\u25e6C. Then, the NC membrane, sample pad, and absorbent were assembled on a fluorescent plastic backing and cut to 4mm in length. Afterward, the electrostatic fiber membrane was removed from the foil paper and stuck on the sticker, and then the area of the MIP membrane was cut into pieces 2mm in width, 4mm in length, and then stuck 5mm from the C-line as the T-line.\nDetection principle of the immunochromatographic strip test\nThe MIP was fixed on the NCmembrane by electrospinning (alternative to antibody) as the T-line and goat-mouse IgG as the C-line immobilized by the instrument and sprayed the FHIgG-Eu solution onto a mat as a fluorescent mat. As shown in Figure 3, when fenvalerate was dripped onto the sample pad, it moved to the fluorescent mat, and the FH-IgG-Eu was dissolved in the buffer solution and flowed to the NCmembrane together. The target fenvalerate and the FH in FH-IgG-Eu could compete for the binding site at the MIPs so that the fluorescence intensity of the T-line forms an inverse relationship with the concentration of fenvalerate. The remaining fluorescence probes are transported to the C-line and combined with secondary antibodies to effectively control the quality of the label flow strips. Finally, the immunofluorescence card reader (Beijing Qinbang Biology Co., LTD. Beijing, China) read T, C, and T/C values according to the intensity of T-line fluorescence and T/C value to be quantified.\nImmunochromatographic strip optimization procedure The fixation method of the T-line and the use of fluorescent microspheres\nBecause MIPFM replaces the T-line, its fixation needs to be optimized to do the T-line work normally and reduce agglomeration. Therefore, the following two methods were tested. One method involved not cutting the NC membrane directly to glue the MIPFM and fixing it on the NC membrane as a T-line. Another way required cutting the NCmembrane and sticking the MIPFM with foil paper as a T-line.\nTwo methods were tested: one mixed the fluorescent probe and buffer solution and dropped it into the test (way 1), and the other used the fluorescent pad for the test (way 2). According to the calculation, the spraying amount of the fluorescent pad was approximately 2 \u00b5L/4mm. Thus, 2 \u00b5L of fluorescent probes were added to 100 \u00b5L of buffer solution in the direct drip method.\nFrontiers inNutrition 05 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 Assembly of the biomimetic immunochromatographic strip assay.\nFIGURE 3 Detection principle."

As shown in Figure 4, the NIP was similar to the MIP, but the spheres were smoother, and the particle diameters of the MIP and NIP were approximately 1.3\u00b5m. The surface area measurements of unwashed, washed MIP and NIP were performed and were 2.1170, 2.9272, and 0.8669 m2/g, respectively. The BET areas ofMIPs are 3.37 and 1.3 times higher than those of NIPs andMIPs without elution, respectively. From Figure 5, the pore volumes of MIPs are 6.1 and 2.3 times higher than those of NIPs and MIPs without elution, respectively. These results indicate that after eluting the templates, many mesopores of the templates are imprinted on MIPs. MIPs with more imprinted cavities and active sites would exhibit greater adsorption capacity and a greater number of combined target molecules than NIPs and MIPs without elution.\nTo further confirm the chemical bonds and functional groups of the MIP, the materials were characterized by FTIR spectrometry (Figure 6). The characteristic peaks of the unwashed MIP at wavelengths of 1,160 cm\u22121 and 1,260 cm\u22121 are higher than those of NIP and washed MIP, which might be attributed to the C-H in-plane bending vibration of the ester group of ethyl chrysanthemate and dowtherm A, respectively. Strong characteristic peaks at 1,730 cm\u22121 and 3,450 cm\u22121 are assigned to the stretching vibration of amide C=O and O-H or N-H of acrylamide, respectively.

Supplementary Figure S1A shows that the adsorption capacity of MIP and NIP concerning fenvalerate increases gradually with increasing time, and the saturation adsorption time was determined to be 90min. Supplementary Figure S1B shows that the adsorption capacity of MIP and NIP increased with increasing fenvalerate concentration. MIP had a higher adsorption capacity for fenvalerate than NIP. Therefore, MIP has specific adsorption to fenvalerate. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1C, Q/C and Q were linearly related, suggesting that MIP had a single binding site per template molecule. According to formulas (1) and (2), Qmax is 3.65 mg/g, and Kd is 47.62 mg/L, which are higher than those in the literature (34). By comparing the experimental results with those in other literature (Table 1), we concluded that\nthe MIPs have a high adsorption capacity. The PyMIP exhibited specific adsorption of fenvalerate better than the other pesticides and had apparent selectivity for fenvalerate (Figure 7)."

The results showed that way 1 had a high background value when we dropped the fluorescent probe directly. However, the opposite result was observed in way 2, which used a fluorescence pad. When the buffer solution had been chromatographed, the background was spotless; therefore, we selected the second method to use a fluorescence pad for further experiments."

However, pyrethroids have low water solubility and are hydrophobic. We needed an organic reagent that could dissolve in water, so the influence of the organic reagent on the strip was determined when 5% acetonitrile was added to the buffer solution. Without adding Tween-20, we found that the brightness of the T- and C-lines was relatively shallow compared to that of Tween-20, even though there was no brightness on the T- and C-lines in many repeated experiments. When a certain amount of sucrose was added to the buffer solution, the brightness of the T- and Clines was not changed significantly. Thus, the method without sucrose was chosen to simplify the experimental process. It must be noted that the addition of cations would have a particular influence on the charge balance of time-resolved fluorescence microspheres, so PB buffer was selected as the buffer solution. In conclusion, 0.02m PB+20% Tween-20 was taken as the optimal buffer solution, and acetonitrile, the tolerable amount of organic solvent in the strip, was added to determine the analytes in the matrices. Then, the strip was measured by diluting the analytes with buffer solution.\nOptimization of the organic solvent tolerance of the immunochromatographic strip test\nThe results showed that the darker the background color is, the more significant the impact on T and C read values when the competitive inhibition rate is higher than 60%. False-positive or false-negative results were judged when the background color was darker than the T-line. Therefore, acetonitrile was selected for further testing.\nBy comparing the amount of acetonitrile added in different ratios under a UV lamp, the brightness of the T and C lines gradually decreases with increasing acetonitrile content. The background of the strip was red, and the value read by the card reader of the strip was no longer accurate, resulting in incorrect interpretation. When the amount of acetonitrile was more than 5%, the edge of the T-line and C-line strips became no longer apparent. Hence, the highest organic solvent tolerance of the strip was 5%."
