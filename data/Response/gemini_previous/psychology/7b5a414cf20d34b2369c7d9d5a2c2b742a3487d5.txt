1. **Investigate the effect of different linker lengths and compositions on the binding affinity, internalization, and biodistribution of PSMA-targeting agents.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of compounds with different linker lengths and compositions and evaluating their properties in vitro and in vivo.


2. **Explore the use of different chelators for radiolabeling PSMA-targeting agents.** Different chelators have different properties, such as stability, lipophilicity, and metal-binding affinity. By exploring different chelators, it may be possible to improve the radiochemical properties of PSMA-targeting agents.


3. **Evaluate the potential of PSMA-targeting agents for theranostic applications.** Theranostic agents are molecules that can be used for both imaging and therapy. By combining a PSMA-targeting agent with a therapeutic agent, it may be possible to develop a new treatment for prostate cancer that is more effective and less toxic than current therapies.


4. **Investigate the use of PSMA-targeting agents for targeted drug delivery.** Targeted drug delivery is a method of delivering drugs specifically to tumor cells. By attaching a drug to a PSMA-targeting agent, it may be possible to improve the efficacy of the drug and reduce its side effects.


5. **Develop PSMA-targeting agents that can be used for in vivo pretargeting.** In vivo pretargeting is a method of administering a targeting agent and a therapeutic agent separately. This can reduce the off-target toxicity of the therapeutic agent. By developing PSMA-targeting agents that can be used for in vivo pretargeting, it may be possible to improve the efficacy of PSMA-targeted therapy.
