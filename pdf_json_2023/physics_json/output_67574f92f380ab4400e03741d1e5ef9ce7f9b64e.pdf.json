    "abstractText": "Starting with the clinical application of two vaccines in 2020, mRNA therapeutics are currently being investigated for a variety of applications. Removing immunogenic uncappedmRNA from transcribedmRNA is critical in mRNA research and clinical applications. Commonly used capping methods provide maximum capping efficiency of around 80\u201390% for widely used Cap0and Cap-1-type mRNAs. However, uncapped and capped mRNA possesses almost identical physicochemical properties, posing challenges to their physical separation. In this work, we develop hydrophobic photocaged tagmodified cap analogs, which separate cappedmRNA fromuncappedmRNAby reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Subsequent photoirradiation recovers footprint-free native capped mRNA. This approach provides 100% capping efficiency even in Cap-2-type mRNA with versatility applicable to 650 nt and 4,247 nt mRNA. We find that the Cap-2-type mRNA shows up to 3to 4-fold higher translation activity in cultured cells and animals than the Cap-1-type mRNA prepared by the standard capping method.",

Removing immunogenic uncappedmRNA from transcribedmRNA is critical in mRNA research and clinical applications. Commonly used capping methods provide maximum capping efficiency of around 80\u201390% for widely used Cap0- and Cap-1-type mRNAs. However, uncapped and capped mRNA possesses almost identical physicochemical properties, posing challenges to their physical separation. In this work, we develop hydrophobic photocaged tagmodified cap analogs, which separate cappedmRNA fromuncappedmRNAby reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Subsequent photoirradiation recovers footprint-free native capped mRNA. This approach provides 100% capping efficiency even in Cap-2-type mRNA with versatility applicable to 650 nt and 4,247 nt mRNA. We find that the Cap-2-type mRNA shows up to 3- to 4-fold higher translation activity in cultured cells and animals than the Cap-1-type mRNA prepared by the standard capping method.\nDecades of research intomRNA therapeutics1,2 have culminated in two approvedmRNA vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic in 20203,4. The 5\u2032 cap plays a critical role in mRNA therapeutics, wherein N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is attached to the 5\u2032 end ofmRNA via a 5\u2032\u22125\u2032 triphosphate bridge (Fig. 1a)5,6. The interaction between the 5\u2032 cap and the poly-A chain at the 3\u2032 end of mRNA enhances the translation activity of mRNA5,6. The other roles of the cap structure include splicing, protection to nuclease, and nuclear transport5,6. Structurally, the 2\u2032- hydroxyl groups at the 5\u2019 end of mRNA are methylated in the cap structure5\u20138. The cap structures of the first two nucleotides possessing zero, one, and two 2\u2032 O-methyl (OMe) groups are called Cap-0, Cap-1, andCap-2, respectively (Fig. 1a). Themethylation in the cap structure is\nReceived: 4 October 2022\nAccepted: 21 April 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8602, Japan. 2Research Center for Materials Science, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8602, Japan. 3Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 1-5 Shimogamohangi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-0823, Japan. 4Innovation Center of NanoMedicine (iCONM), Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion, 3-25-14 Tonomachi, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki 210-0821, Japan. 5Medical Research Institute, TokyoMedical andDental University (TMDU), 1- 5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan. 6CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 7, Gobancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-0076, Japan. 7Institute for Glyco-core Research (iGCORE), Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan. 8These authors contributed equally: Masahito Inagaki, Naoko Abe. e-mail: h-abe@chem.nagoya-u.ac.jp\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\na marker of \u201cself\u201d mRNA, making mRNA with less immunogenic9\u201311. A recent study provides insight into the identity and functions of Cap-2 cap structure inmRNA,whichhave remainedunknown for years12. Cap2 structure drastically reduces the mRNA affinity to retinoic acidinducible gene-I (RIG-1), an innate immune receptor recognition compared to Cap-1 structure, with moderately increasing mRNA stability and translation activity12. In mammals, when the first transcribed base of capped mRNA is A, most of its N6 position is methylated, formingm6A5,6. The presence of m6A increases resistance to anmRNAdecapping enzyme, Dcp213.\nIn chemical or semi-chemical methods of capped RNA synthesis14\u201317, the length of the RNA strand is limited to about 150 bases. For synthesizing longer cappedmRNAwith high efficiency, RNA polymerase of phage origin is mainly used, especially T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP). The current capping methods include enzymatic and co-transcriptional capping5. In the enzymatic capping, transcribed mRNA is treated with a capping enzyme5,18, often followed by methyltransferase treatment to convert the Cap-0 structure to the Cap-15. In co-transcriptional capping, a synthetic cap analog, i.e., m7G-containing nucleotide, is added to the in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction19,20. The first generation dinucleotide cap analog m7G(5\u2032) ppp(5\u2032)G had the problem of the chain-elongation starting from the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group of the m7G. The unintended elongation results in 30\u201350% of the reversely capped RNA being inactive for translation20. This issue was solved by an anti-reverse cap analog [ARCA, m2\n7,3\u2019-OG(5\u2019) ppp(5\u2019)G] methylated in the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group of m7G, ensuring the chain-elongation exclusively from the desired side21,22. Recently, new cap analogs consisting of trinucleotides and tetranucleotides have been developed23\u201327 to introduce the Cap-1 or Cap-2 structure into mRNA directly. Despite such progress, co-transcriptional capping still has a challenge in obtaining capped mRNA with 100% efficiency because nucleotides such as GTP compete with cap analogs for the initiation step of the transcription reaction.\nThe uncapped byproduct has a triphosphate (ppp) at the 5\u2032 end, a motif found in viral mRNA, triggering an immune response via innate immune receptors such as RIG-1 and melanoma differentiationassociated protein 5 (MDA5)11,28. Moradian et al. have reported that a small amount of 5\u2032 ppp-RNA byproduct from a standard cotranscriptional capping method induces substantial immune responses29, wherein the capping method provides around 80\u201390% capping efficiency30. These studies highlight the necessity tomaximize capping efficiency or minimize uncapped ppp-RNA contaminants. The enzymatic treatment is a standardmethod to removeuncappedmRNA byproducts. For example, the 5\u2032-terminal triphosphate of uncapped RNA will be converted to the monophosphate by RNA 5\u2032 polyphosphatase, followedbydegradingmonophosphorylatedRNAusingXRN I, a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exoribonuclease requiring 5\u2019 monophosphate24,26,27,31. However, consideringmRNA susceptibility to non-specific degradation, the number of purification processes should be minimized. In addition, repeated enzymatic treatment significantly increases the production cost, hampering commercial mass preparation of mRNA. These issues motivate us to develop a non-enzymatic methodology for diminishing the uncapped mRNA immunogenicity.\nPhysical separation of capped mRNA from uncapped mRNA would become a simple, robust, cost-effective purification strategy. However, capped and uncapped mRNA have almost the same physicochemical properties, posing challenges for their separation.\nIn this study, we design hydrophobic cap analogs, namely PureCap analogs, for purifying capped mRNA. PureCap cap analogs are integrated into the mRNA 5\u2019-terminal during the IVT reaction. Its hydrophobicity enables the purification of the capped mRNA using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (Fig. 1b, c). Using a photodegradable 2-nitrobenzyl derivative as a hydrophobic tag enables tag removal under mild conditions by light irradiation32. This method relies on RP-HPLC, a standard purification\nprocess for nucleic acid medicine, rather than enzymatic treatment. Especially, purification of mRNA by RP-HPLC is an established method for eliminating double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) contaminants produced during the IVT, which increases the immunogenicity of mRNA and inhibits its translation33\u201337. Thus, the PureCap method can isolate cappedmRNA from the two significant impurities, uncapped ppp-RNA and dsRNA, simultaneously providing a practical advantage in mRNA production.\nUsing the PureCap technology, we succeeded in footprint-free purification of the capped mRNA in a native form with 100% capping efficiency, which to the best of our knowledge, has not been achieved previously for the first time. The PureCap mRNA shows undetectable immunogenicity even without enzymatic treatment. Achieving 100% efficiency in various cap species, our approach provides an unbiased platform to study their structure-activity relationship by excluding the influence of different capping efficiency observed among cap species. Notably, we prepare fully capped Cap-2 mRNA, which shows up to three- to four-fold higher translation activity in cultured cells and animals compared with mRNA prepared by standard capping methods."

            "text": "Design and synthesis of dinucleotide PureCap analogs We designed and synthesized PureCap cap analogs modified with a hydrophobic tag (Figs. 1c, 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1\u201314). To begin with, four dinucleotide PureCaps were synthesized. The structure of a hydrophobic tag contains a tert-butyl (tBu) group in a 2-nitobenzyl (Nb) photocaging molecule32, where tBu moiety works to enhance its hydrophobicity and chemical stability38. In three of the four designed cap analogs, the Nb tag was introduced into either the 2\u2032 or 3\u2032 hydroxyl group of m7G. DiPure (1) is an analog that links the Nb group via an acetal group at the 2\u2019 position and has a free 3\u2032 hydroxyl group since methylation of the 2\u2032-hydroxyl has been reported to inhibit chain elongation fromm7G as well as that of the 3\u2032-hydroxyl39. The other two analogs haveO-methyl (OMe) andO-Nbmodifications at the 2\u2032/3\u2032 positions of m7G. Analogs with OMe modifications on either 2\u2032 or 3\u2032 were named DiPure/2\u2032OMe (2) or DiPure/3\u2032OMe (3), respectively. Using the ONb and OMe modifications, all three analogs have anti-reverse activity. Being deprotected after introduction into mRNA, three types of purely capped mRNA can be prepared that differ only in the presence or absence of the OMe modification. As a result, we planned to make a precise comparison in the translation activity with the structure without OMe modification, which was impossible before. The remaining compound, DiPure/N2 (4), is a cap analog modified with the Nb at the exocyclic amino group of m7G.\nThe key step in synthesizing cap analogs is synthesizing the corresponding diphosphate by phosphorylation of guanosine derivatives. For the synthesis of cap analogs known as the ARCA derivatives, protocols consisting of monophosphorylation by the Yoshikawa method using phosphoryl chloride, activation of monophosphate through phosphorimidazolide formation, and diphosphate formation by reaction with alkylammonium phosphate were applied19. However, this method is complicated because it is based on the stepwise introduction of phosphate groups. It requires multiple purifications with aqueous solvents, such as ion exchange and reversed-phase chromatography. The introduction of a lipophilic moiety, such as in the PureCap analogs, is expected to decrease the solubility of the intermediates in aqueous solvents, making purification particularly difficult. Therefore, we applied a one-pot synthesis of the diphosphate directly from the nucleoside to avoid the solubility problem and simplify and shorten the synthetic processes. In the first approach, phosphoryl chloride is applied to a guanosine derivative, and the diphosphate is obtained by adding an alkylammonium phosphate salt to the resulting phosphorodichloridate intermediate40\u201342. The second\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 2\napproach is to obtain the diphosphate directly from 5\u2032-tosylated guanosine by reacting with tetrabutylammonium pyrophosphate salt43\u201346. The resulting diphosphate is converted to the desired dinucleotide PureCap analog by methylation at the N7 position and subsequent condensation reaction with guanosine monophosphate imidazolide in the presence of zinc chloride. 2\u2032-O-Nb-modified guanosine 14 as a phosphorylation precursor was synthesized from N2-isobutyrylguanosine 11 in four steps (Fig. 2a). First, N2-isobutyrylguanosine 11 was reacted with 1,3-dichloro-1,1,3,3tetraisopropyldisiloxane (TIPDSCl2) in pyridine to afford the 3\u2032,5\u2032-Oprotected compound in a quantitative yield47. The key Nb group was introduced by reactionwith nitrobenzyl alcoholmethylthioacetal 12 in\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 3\nthe presence ofN-iodosuccinimide (NIS) and TfOH in THF at \u221240 \u00b0C to afford the corresponding product 13 in 76% yield. The silyl protecting group was subsequently removed with tetrabutylammonium fluoride to afford the unprotected compound in 75% yield, which was then treated with 28% aqueous ammonia at 55 \u00b0C to remove the isobutyryl group to afford 2\u2032-O-Nbmodified guanosine 14 in 70% yield. In the first approach, 14 was reacted with phosphoryl chloride in trimethyl phosphate, and then tetrabutylammonium monophosphate salt was applied to afford the corresponding diphosphate 15 in one pot after hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 3). Although 15 could be synthesized by this method in a short step, the low yield of the diphosphate formation (13%) was a problem. Therefore, direct diphosphorylation via 5\u2032-O-tosylated form 14 was investigated as a second approach. First, 2\u2032- O-Nb guanosine (14) was reacted with tosyl chloride in pyridine to obtain the 5\u2032-O-tosylated form in 60% yield, which was then reacted with tetrabutylammoniumdiphosphate salt to give the diphosphate 15 in 54% yield. The resulting diphosphatewas reactedwithmethyl iodide in DMSO to afford the 7-methylguanosine diphosphate derivative in 72% yield. This compound was then converted to the corresponding phosphorimidazolide 16 by treatment with imidazole, 2,2\u2032-dithiodipyridine, and triphenylphosphine in 89% yield. Finally, compound 17 was reacted with guanosine monophosphate phosphoroimidazolide 18 in the presence of zinc chloride to afford PureCap analog DiPure (1) in 50% yield (Fig. 2b). 2\u2032-O-methylated analog DiPure/2\u2019OMe (2), 3\u2032-Omethylated analog DiPure/3\u2019OMe (3), and N2-Nb-protected analog DiPure/N2 (4) were synthesized similarly (Supplementary Figs. 6\u20138). Design and synthesis of tri/tetranucleotide PureCap analogs The cap structure produced by the co-transcription of dinucleotide cap analogs is Cap-0. However, in 2009, Ishikawa et al. reported that mRNAs with the Cap-1 structures could be prepared using trinucleotide cap analogs23. Sikorski et al. recently synthesized a series of trinucleotide cap analogs and compared their translation activity of mRNA containing Cap-1 with that of mRNA containing Cap-0, reporting a higher translation activity of the former in some mammalian cultured cells24. Methylation of the terminus 3\u2032 hydroxyl of the trinucleotide cap analogs cannot introduce the Cap-2 structure intomRNA, as is known as the rationale for developing ARCA21,22,39. To this end, tetranucleotide cap analog are required to introduce a Cap-2 structure in mRNA, as reported recently by ref. 27. We synthesized tri- or tetranucleotide PureCap analogs in this study to produce quantitatively capped mRNAs with Cap-1 and Cap-2 structures (Figs. 1c, 2c).We selected A andm6A bases as the base of the sites to whichm7G links in the tri- or tetranucleotides; according to the report that the highest translation activity with Cap-1 mRNA was observed when the base in the cap structure was A or m6A24. Sikorski et al. reported the synthesis of trinucleotide cap analogs by reacting 5\u2032-monophosphorylated dinucleotides synthesized by a\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 4\nsolid phase method with N7-methylguanosine diphosphate imidazolide in the presence of zinc chloride24. Senthilvelan et al. also reported the synthesis of trinucleotide cap analogs using 5\u2032-monophosphorylated dinucleotides synthesized by a liquid phase method26. The 5\u2032-monophosphorylated dinucleotides (19, 20) and 5\u2032-monophosphorylated trinucleotides (21, 22) synthesized by these synthetic methods were reacted with N7-methyl-2\u2019-O-Nb-guanosine diphosphate imidazolide 16 in the presence of zinc chloride to synthesize PureCap analogs in trinucleotide (5, 6) and tetranucleotide (7, 8) forms. (Fig. 2c).\nPreparation and purification of mRNA using dinucleotide PureCap analogs First, we examined whether the synthesized dinucleotide cap analog DiPure could isolate and purify cappedmRNA by RP-HPLC as planned.\nUsing 676-bp double-stranded DNA containing the T7 promoter and encoding NanoLuc luciferase (Nluc) as a template48, mRNA of 650 bases was transcriptionally synthesized using T7 RNAP. DiPure was added to this reaction, and the resultingRNA transcriptswere analyzed by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3). Control samples were prepared without the cap analog and with the commercially available ARCA [m2\n7,3\u2019-OG(5\u2019)ppp(5\u2019) G]. First, as is common in capped mRNA preparation reactions using ARCA to increase the introduction of the cap analog, the GTP concentration was reduced to 0.5mM, and NTPs other than GTP and cap analog concentrations were set to 2mM for the transcription reaction. (Fig. 3a). The resulting RNA transcripts were analyzed by RP-HPLC, and RNA was eluted at 16.4min in case no cap analog was added or with ARCA (Fig. 3b, c). On theother hand,with the capanalogDiPure, a peak at 18.5min was observed in addition to the peak at 16.4min (Fig. 3d).\na\n1000\n500\n300 (nt)\nCap analog (2 mM) (-) (-) 2 2 0.5 0.5[GTP] (mM) T7 RNAP (-) (+) (+) (+)\nc ARCA\n-0.01\n0.04\n0.09\n0.14\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nA bs\n26 0\n(A U\n)\nTime (min)\n16 .4\n1\n16 .3\n9\ni)\nii)\nA bs\n26 0\n(A U\n)\nTime (min)\nb\n-0.01\n0.04\n0.09\n0 5 10 15 20 25 i) Crude\nii) After HPLC purification\n16 .3\n9\n16 .3\n7\nCap(-)\ng d DiPure\n-0.01\n0.04\n0 5 10 15 20 25\niii) After photoirradiationA bs 26\n0 (A\nU )\nTime (min)\n(1 6.\n41 )\n18 .4\n8 (5\n9% )\n18 .5\n2 1 6.\n39\ni)\nii)\n650-nt Nluc mRNA\n5\u2019 m7G-ppp-G- 3\u2019\n35-nt DNAzyme\n5\u2019 fragment (23-nt)5\u2019 m7G-ppp-G- 3\u2019\nf\nh\n1000\n500\n300\n(nt)\nLane 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0 0.05 0.5 5 50 (ng)i\nCrude mRNA (#6)\n1210 11\n6 7 8 9\n1 2 3 4 5\n13 14\nCap(+) Cap(-)\n56Capped% - >99 98 57\nLane 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n>99 >99\n20220601_08 an4674_a 0:H10 MS Raw\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\nIn te\nns .

Source Data are provided with this paper.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 5\nWe judged that the elution time of capped RNA containing DiPure changed from 16.4 to 18.5min due to its hydrophobicity (Fig. 3d). To confirm this, the peak at 18.5min was collected, and 365-nm light was irradiated to the RNA. The elution time of the RNA changed from 18.5 to 16.4min due to the removal of the hydrophobic protecting group. To confirm the structure of the 5\u2032 end of the RNA, 650-nt Nluc mRNA purified by RP-HPLC was cleaved at 23 bases from the 5\u2032 end by DNAzyme 10\u20132349. The product was subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (dPAGE) and mass analysis (Fig. 3f, g and Supplementary Table 1). The results showed that the mRNA prepared with ARCA had a capping rate of 57% and was a mixture of capped and uncappedmRNA, whereas the mRNA purified by RP-HPLC with DiPure contained no uncapped mRNA. For all mRNAs, including uncapped mRNA, minor bands were observed above and below the main band of the cleavage product, which we believe is due to the 5\u2019 end heterogeneity of the transcript produced by T7 RNAP (Fig. 3f)50. These results indicate that capped mRNA can be quantitatively prepared by RP-HPLC purification using the DiPure cap analog.\nDiPure/N2, a cap analog with a protecting group at theN2 position ofm7G,was similarly added to the IVT reaction, and the generated RNA was analyzed by RP- HPLC. As a result, it was found that cappedmRNA could be isolated and purified for mRNA containing this analog using the hydrophobicity of the cap analog (Fig. 3e).\nWhen T7 RNAP transcribes RNA, it is known that highly immunogenic dsRNA is produced as a byproduct33\u201337. When this dsRNA is included in the mRNA as an impurity, the translation activity of the mRNA is significantly impaired due to the triggering of a cellular immune response24,33,35. Purification by RP-HPLC or removal using cellulose powder is known for removing dsRNA impurity24,33,35. In our preliminary study, we also noticed that purifying capped RNA by RPHPLC increased the translation activity in HeLa cells by about 50\u2013100- fold. Detection experiments using anti-dsRNA J2 antibody showed that this increase in activity was due to the removal of dsRNA by RP-HPLC purification. Using RNA transcripts with no cap analog added, we examined the elution time of the dsRNA impurity by RP-HPLC and found that it eluted about 2\u20133min later than the main product, 650-nt\nmRNA, under our analytical conditions (Supplementary Fig. 15). This position coincides with the elution position of mRNA containing PureCap analogs. Therefore, mRNA containing PureCap had to be purified once by HPLC preparative purification of cappedmRNA using its hydrophobicity, followed by deprotection by light irradiation. Then a second HPLC purification was added for complete dsRNA removal. Control mRNA samples were also purified by HPLC twice to match the number of cycles in the HPLC purification process.\nCapped NlucmRNAs using DiPure/3\u2019OMe and DiPure/2\u2019OMewere also prepared (Supplementary Fig. 16). In this case, we examined the transcription reaction conditions. We found that the capped mRNA yield after RP-HPLC isolation increased if the GTP concentration was not reduced in the reaction and kept at 2mM, the same as other NTPs, although the incorporation rate of the PureCap analog decreased. Therefore, in subsequent experiments, the GTP concentration was not reduced, and the desired pure-capped mRNA was isolated from the resulting RNA transcript mixture by RP-HPLC.\nThe purity of the resulting capped mRNAs was confirmed to be nearly identical by dPAGE (Fig. 3h). A detection assay for dsRNA contamination using the anti-dsRNA antibody confirmed that dsRNA was similarly removed from the capped mRNAs (Fig. 3i). These highly purified capped mRNAs were used for subsequent immunogenicity and translation activity evaluations.\nPreparation and purification of mRNA using tri/tetranucleotide PureCap analogs First, a trinucleotide PureCap analog TriPure_1 and a tetranucleotide PureCap analog TetraPure_2 were tested to determine whether they could be incorporated in the IVT using a short RNA transcription system on 60-bp dsDNA templates (Fig. 4). As a control experiment, the efficiency of incorporation of untagged cap analogs was evaluated to know the effect of the modification by comparison. We tested three different promoter sequences: the first was a sequence called Type III \u03d56.5, known as the most versatile and powerful promoter sequence; the second was Type II \u03d52.5, initiated from ATP, anticipating the previously reported 5\u2032 end high uniformity51,52.

First, IVT reactions were performedwith all NTPs and cap analog at 2mM concentration, and transcripts were analyzed by dPAGE (Fig. 4). To resolve the 3\u2032 end heterogeneity of the purified RNA transcripts and to facilitate confirmation of the product, the RNA was digested by DNAzyme at ten bases upstream from the 3\u2032 end of the RNA49. They were analyzed by dPAGE in the same manner. The results showed that the incorporation efficiency of the trinucleotide cap analog was higher than that of the tetranucleotide for all promoters used and that tag introduction to the trinucleotide did not affect the incorporation efficiency. Indeed, with the A-inserted promoter, the generation of the uncapped transcript was lower, and the selectivity of the transcription initiation from the trinucleotide capwas higher25. Unlike the trinucleotide counterpart, a reduction in the incorporation efficiency due to the introduction of the tag was observed for the tetranucleotide cap analogs. Next, we used the Type III \u03d56.5 promoter to determine whether decreasing the GTP concentration increases the amount of capped RNA obtained (Fig. 4c)27. The results showed that lowering the concentration of GTP, which competes with the cap analog in the initiation phase, increased the capping ratio but decreased the amount of capped RNA produced.\nWhen using the PureCap analog, the amount of uncappedRNAwas not an issue because RP-HPLC could separate the capped RNA. From these results, we chose to keep the GTP concentration the same as the other NTPs in the transcription reactionwith PureCap analogs to prepare the mRNA. As for the lower incorporation efficiency of the tetranucleotide cap analogs regardless of the promoter type, it was speculated that its steric bulk makes it difficult to stabilize the initiation complex formed between the tetranucleotide, template DNA, and polymerase53. Nluc mRNA was then prepared using these PureCap analogs to study the effects of Cap-0, Cap-1, and Cap-2 structures on translation activity (Fig. 5). Cap-0 and Cap-1 structures were introduced into mRNA using the corresponding trinucleotide PureCaps, TriPure_0, TriPure_1, respectively (Fig. 1a, c). Cap-2 structures were introduced using the tetranucleotide PureCaps TetraPure_2 or TetraPure_2/m6A. Preliminary experiments were performed to compare the amount of capped RNA produced by the two promoters shown in Fig. 4, Type III \u03d56.5 and A-inserted. As a result, we found that the Type III \u03d56.5 promoter made the highest amount of the capped mRNA and that it was appropriate to use this promoter to prepare mRNA (Supplementary\nFig. 17). NlucmRNAwas transcribedwith 2mMconcentrations of NTPs and cap analog from DNA containing the Type III \u03d56.5 promoter. As shown in Fig. 5,mRNAswith PureCap analogs showed different elution times than uncapped mRNAs, and RP-HPLC could isolate capped\ni)\nii)\niii)\nTriPure_0\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nTriPure_1\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0 5 10 15 20 25 (1\n3. 74\n) 15 .6\n015 .5\n0 (6\n8% )\n13 .7\n5\n(1 3.\n96 ) 15\n.7 9\n(5 4% ) 15 .6 3 13 .7 7\nA bs\n26 0\n(A U\n)\nTime (min)\nA bs\n26 0\n(A U\n)\nTime (min)\ni)\nii)\niii)\nA bs\n26 0\n(A U\n)\nTime (min)\nTetraPure_2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n13 .7\n6\n15 .6\n2\n(1 3.\n75 )\n15 .5\n9 (2\n5% )\ni)\nii)\niii)\nc\ni)\nii)\niii)\nTetraPure_2/ m6A\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n13 .7\n8\n15 .8\n2\n(1 3.\n70 )\n15 .7\n5 (2\n1% )\nA bs\n26 0\n(A U\n)\nTime (min)\nd\na b\ng h i\nTri_1\n-0.02\n0.03\n0.08\n0.13\n0.18\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nA bs\n26 0\n(A U\n)\nTime (min)\ne\ni)\nii)\n13 .5\n2\n13 .8\n0\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nTetra_2f\nA bs\n26 0\n(A U\n)\nTime (min)\ni)\nii)\n13 .5\n3\n13 .9\n5\nPromoter A-inserted\nCapped % - >99>99 9598 -60 22 87 52\n1000\n500\n(nt) 300\nLane 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 0.05 0.5 5 50 (ng)\n1311 12\n6 7 8 9\n1 2 3 4 5\n14 15\n10\nFig. 5 | Nluc mRNA (650-nt) preparation using tri/tetranucleotide PureCap analogs. a\u2013f RP-HPLC analysis of IVT-RNAs.

Consistent with the previous results producing short RNA transcripts, the incorporation efficiency of tetranucleotide PureCaps was lower than those of trinucleotide PureCaps: 68 and 54% for TriPure_0 and TriPure_1, and 25 and 21% for TetaPure_2, TetraPure_2 /m6A, respectively. To check the identity of the 5\u2032 end of the HPLC-purified mRNAs, they were cleaved using DNAzyme 10\u201323 at 23 bases from the 5\u2032 end and analyzed by dPAGE andMALDI-TOFMS (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 18). The capped mRNA produced using PureCap analogs showed almost no band derived from uncapped RNA and observed molecular weight of the 5\u2032 end fragments were consistent with theoretical ones. Control mRNAs were prepared using two cap analogs without tag, a trinucleotide cap analog Tri_1 and a tetranucleotide cap analog Tetra_2 from templates containing two different promoters, Type III \u03d56.5 and A-inserted one, and the differences in their capping efficiencies were examined (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 18). As shown in Fig. 5g, both cap analogs were incorporated into mRNA at higher ratios when the template containing A-inserted promoter was used25. Therefore, the control mRNAs were transcribed from the template containing the A-inserted promoter and utilized for subsequent biological activity measurements.\nImmunogenicity of mRNAs prepared using PureCap analogs Mammalian cells have an immune system as a defense mechanism against infection by foreign organisms such as viruses11,28. Externally introduced RNA is recognized by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, TLR8, and RIG-I, triggering an immune response in host cells28. If the prepared mRNA contains uncapped 5\u2032 ppp-RNA and/or dsRNA impurity, the defense mechanism against antiviral infection will be activated11,28. When they are sensed by RIG-1, a cellular-type immune response occurs, activating protein kinase R and inhibiting intracellular translation. 5\u2032 ppp-RNA is also recognized by the antiviral proteins Interferon-\ninduced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and IFIT554. Therefore, removing as much uncapped mRNA as possible when preparing capped mRNAs is essential, which may cause unwanted immune responses.\nSince highly purified, quantitatively capped 650-nt Nluc mRNAs were prepared by the PureCapmethod described above, the immunostimulatory properties of these mRNAs were evaluated using NF-\u03baB reporter (Luc)-HEK293 cell line55. Control mRNAs and mRNAs prepared by the PureCap method were introduced into the cells by lipofection, cultured, and lysed. The activation level of the NF-\u03baB pathway was measured as the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. In this system, after activating proinflammatory cytokines or agonists of lymphokine receptors, endogenous NF-\u03baB transcription factors bind to the DNA response elements, inducing the luciferase reporter gene transcription. As shown in Fig. 6, the expression level of the luciferase gene by mRNAs prepared with the PureCap analogs was almost the same as that of the mock-transfected sample (No RNA). In contrast, when mRNA was prepared using the control cap analogs, ARCA or Tri_1 was transfected, and 2.7- and 2.2-fold higher luciferase expression was observed than in the mock-transfected sample. The expression decreased when the mRNA was dephosphorylated using Antarctic phosphatase, which indicates that their immunogenicity was attributed mainly to the uncapped 5\u2032 ppp-RNA byproduct9,11,56. We confirmed that RP-HPLC purification significantly reduced the amount of luciferase expression, which would reflect the removal of dsRNA impurities (Fig. 6a, ARCA, crude vs. ARCA)33.\nThese experiments demonstrate the effect of removing 5\u2019-triphosphate fromuncappedmRNA, which is included as an impurity, on lowering the immunostimulatory effect of prepared mRNA. At the same time, they show the effectiveness of the PureCapmethod, which can remove both 5\u2032-ppp-RNA and dsRNA impurities in the RP-HPLC purification process.\n****\n*\nR el\nat iv\ne lu\nci fe\nra se\na ct\niv ity\na b\nR el\nat iv\ne lu\nci fe\nra se\na ct\niv ity\nns ns\n****\n** ns ns ns ns\nFig. 6 | Evaluationof the immunostimulatory effect of cappedmRNAsusingNF\u03baB reporter (Luc)\u2012HEK293 cells. 650-nt Nluc mRNA prepared/ purified using dinucleotide cap analogs (a) or tri/tetranucleotide cap analogs (b) was transfected into the cells using LipofectamineMessengerMAX reagent.

Capped Nluc mRNAs were isolated by RP-HPLC, and both samples were introduced into culturedHeLa cells derived fromhuman cervical carcinomabefore and after deprotection by light irradiation (Fig. 7a). It was found that the presence of Nb protecting group at N2 of m7G base significantly suppressed mRNA translation, showing only 1.6% of the activity after deprotection. This observation is consistent with a recent report by Klocker et al. that the translation of mRNA containing a cap structure with a photocleavage group on the exocyclic amino group of m7G could be triggered by light irradiation in cultured cells31,57. They attributed the translation inhibition effect of the photocleavage group to the inhibition of binding to eIF4E31. On the other hand, unlike the case above with DiPure/N2, the mRNA prepared with DiPure showed almost the same translation activity before and after light irradiation, indicating that the Nb group at the 2\u2032 O-position does not impair the translation activity. We chose the hydroxyl group of the sugar moiety of the m7G as the position for introducing the Nb group as a purification tag because of the relative ease of synthesis and the possibility of introducing subsequent chemical modifications at the N2 position of m7G. Next, we checked the effect of increasing capping efficiency on mRNA translation activity (Fig. 7b). We prepared a pair of mRNAs differing only in capping efficiency, with almost 100% in one and lower\nHeLa cellse JAWSII cellsf\nHeLa cellsc JAWSII cellsd\necnecseni muli m eh C C he m ilu m in es ce nc e\necnecseni muli meh C\n**** 24-h 48-h 72-h 120-h\n24-h 48-h 72-h 120-h\n12-h 24-h 48-h\n12-h 24-h 48-h\nns\n*** **\nns\n**** ****\n****\nns\n**** ****\n****\nns\n*\n****\n***\nns\n****\n****\n****\nns\n****\n***\n*\nns\n****\n****\n****\nns\n**\n****\n****\nns\n** **\nns\nns\n****\n***\nns\n* *\nns\nns\n****\n****\nns\nns\n*** ***\nns ns\nns\nns\nns\n****\n****\nns\n* *\nns ns\n**** ****\nns\nns ns\nnsns\n**** ****\nns\nns ns\na b\nns****ecnecseni muli meh C\nDeprotection (-) (+) (-) (+)\n** **\nnsns\nC he\nm ilu\nm in\nes ce\nnc e\n24-h 48-h\nns ns\nCapping ratio (%)\n0 56 57 >99 98\nHeLa cells (24-h) HeLa cells\nFig. 7 | Translation activities of Nluc mRNAs in cultured mammalian cells.

Source Data are provided with this paper.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 9\nin the other. Firstly, mRNA transcribed using DiPure cap analog (1) was divided into two groups. From one, capped mRNA was purified using RP-HPLC followed by photo-irradiation. This process provided mRNA with over 99% capping efficiency, which is denoted as DiPure. The other group of mRNA was photo-irradiated before RP-HPLC purification. This method provides a single peak in RP-HPLC containing the mixture of uncapped and cappedmRNA, as photo-irradiation removes a hydrophobic tag from capped mRNA. The resulting mRNA mixture showed a capping efficiency of 57%, denoted as DiPure (mixture). DiPure and DiPure (mixture) originated from the same mRNA stock, possessed the same cap structure, and similarly received HPLC purification but differed only in capping efficiency. After the introduction to HeLa cells, DiPure (mixture) mRNA showed approximately 60% translation efficiency of that obtained by DiPure mRNA with 100% capping efficiency. The difference in capping efficiency may explain the difference in translation activity in this result.\nSince the above experiments showed that the PureCapmethod of mRNA preparation is effective for obtaining the highest translation activity of mRNA, we evaluated the translation activity of Nluc mRNAs with various cap structures in more detail. Nluc mRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells, a representative of non-immune cells, and mouse immature dendritic cell-derived JAWS II cells, a representative of immune cells, to examine the effect of different cap structures on the translation activity of mRNA (Fig. 7c\u2013f and Table 1). As shown in Fig. 7b, c, mRNA prepared with DiPure showed two to three times higher translation activity thanmRNA prepared with ARCA in cultured HeLa cells. Dephosphorylation of the uncapped mRNA in ARCA- capped mRNA hardly changed the translation activity (ARCA vs. ARCA/ AnP). Similar results were confirmed using JAWS II cells, where DiPurecappedmRNA showed approximately 3-foldmore potent activity than ARCA-cappedmRNA (Fig. 7d). These differences in translation activity between these two will be attributed to the difference in the capping efficiency. That is, DiPure-capped mRNA was quantitative, although ARCA-capped mRNA was about 60% (Fig. 3f). From these results, we confirmed that the preparation of quantitatively capped mRNA using PureCap analogs contributes to improving mRNA translation activity.\nTo investigate the effect of the methyl group introduced into the 2\u2032 or 3\u2032 hydroxyl of m7G on the translation activity, mRNAs prepared\nwith three PureCap analogs, DiPure, DiPure/2\u2032OMe, and DiPure/3\u2032OMe were compared (Fig. 7c, d, Table 1, and Supplementary Fig. 19a). In cultured HeLa and JAWS II cells, O-methylation at the 2\u2032 positions slightly reduced its translation activity. Still, no apparent change in the activity was observed when onemethyl group was introduced into the cap structure58. These experimental results are consistent with in silico docking simulations showing that the methyl group introduced at the 3\u2032-O position of m7G of dinucleotide cap analog would not interfere with the interaction of the cap-binding protein V39 of cap-specific mRNA 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase or the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E22. In the end, we conclude that DiPure is the best of the three analogs because it is the easiest to synthesize, has the best incorporation by T7 RNAP, and exhibits high mRNA translation activity.\nThe translation activity of Nluc mRNAs with Cap-0, Cap-1, and Cap-2 cap structures was compared using cultured HeLa and JAWS II cells (Fig. 7e, f and Table 1). In these experiments, unlike previous reports24, there was no apparent difference in activity betweenmRNAs withCap-0 andCap-1 inbothHeLa and JAWS II cells. On the other hand, the translation activity of Cap-2-mRNAs introduced using the tetranucleotide PureCap analogs TetraPure_2 and TetraPure_2/m6A were higher than that of mRNAs with Cap-1 and Cap-027. The enhanced translation activity of Cap-2 mRNA was more pronounced in JAWS II cells than in HeLa cells and was up to 4.2-fold more active than Cap-1 mRNApreparedwithTri-1 cap analog. The results of our experiment, in which the translation activity of mRNA containing the Cap-2 structure is higher than that having the Cap-1 structure in JAWS II cells, differ from the results of a study reported by ref. 27. Still, the reason for this difference is unclear at this point. For control mRNAs prepared from a DNA template containing the A-inserted promoter, the translation activity of Cap-1 mRNA prepared using the Tri_1 trinucleotide cap, which had a high capping efficiency of 90%25, was comparable to that of mRNA prepared using the PureCap analog TriPure_1, both in HeLa and JAWS II cells. The activity of Cap-2 mRNA prepared with the tetranucleotide cap Tetra_2, in which only about 50% of the cap was introduced, was only about 1/3 of that of Cap-2 mRNA prepared with TetraPure_2. This result reflects the low capping efficiency of tetranucleotide cap analogs and indicates the PureCapmethod\u2019s usefulness\nTable 1 | Summary of translation activity of Nluc mRNAs evaluated in this study\nName of mRNAa Capping efficiency (%)b Normalized Nluc expressionc\nHeLa cells JAWS II cells Mice liver Mice spleen\nDinucleotide Cap analogs (m7G-ppp-G)\nARCA 56 1.00 \u00b10.02 1.00\u00b10.03 n.d. n.d.\nARCA/ AnP 56 0.97 \u00b1 0.03 1.13 \u00b1 0.03 n.d. n.d.\nDiPure >99 2.36 \u00b10.05 3.51 \u00b1 0.09 n.d. n.d.\nDiPure/3\u2032OMe >99 2.27 \u00b1 0.07 3.11 \u00b1 0.21 n.d. n.d.\nDiPure/2\u2032OMe >99 2.01 \u00b1 0.09 2.58 \u00b10.08 n.d. n.d.\nTri/ tetranucleotide cap analogs m7G-ppp-AG(G)\nTri_1 87 1.00 \u00b10.04 1.00\u00b10.05 1.00\u00b1 0.15 1.00 \u00b10.13\nTri_1/ AnP 87 1.07 \u00b1 0.03 1.51 \u00b1 0.06 1.47 \u00b1 0.23 0.61 \u00b1 0.08\nTetra_2 52 0.52 \u00b1 0.02 0.70 \u00b10.04 n.d. n.d.\nTetra_2/AnP 52 0.51 \u00b1 0.02 0.53 \u00b10.02 n.d. n.d.\nTriPure_0 >99 1.12 \u00b1 0.06 1.04 \u00b10.08 n.d. n.d.\nTriPure_1 >99 1.31 \u00b1 0.05 1.07 \u00b1 0.05 0.80 \u00b10.08 0.90 \u00b10.07\nTetraPure_2 98 1.91 \u00b1 0.06 2.99 \u00b10.19 4.86 \u00b10.61 2.48 \u00b1 0.29\nTetraPure_2/m6A 95 1.98 \u00b10.07 3.60 \u00b10.19 4.07 \u00b1 0.48 3.58 \u00b10.63 aThe.RNAs were named after the cap analog used.

All data were considered for evaluation If the activity was measured at more than one time point.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 10\nin introducing Cap-2 structures using tetranucleotide cap analogs with low incorporation efficiency. As for Cap-2 mRNA containing m6A prepared using TetraPure_2/m6A, a slight increasewhen comparedmRNA with TetraPure_2 in translation activity was observed in JAWS II cells.\nWe also compared the translation activity ofmRNAswith this Cap0, 1, and 2 structures in a cell-free translation system based on HeLa S3 cells59. In this experiment, Cap-2-mRNAs also showed higher translation activity than Cap-0/1 mRNA, especially the Cap-2 with m6A (Supplementary Fig. 19b).\nIn our experiments, since the Cap-2 cap structure was found to increase the translation activity of its mRNA compared to the Cap-1 cap structure in cultured cell lines, these translation activities were subsequently compared in animal experiments using mice (Fig. 8). mRNA was encapsulated into ionizable lipid-based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for systemic administration. In vivo luminescence imaging revealed that TetraPure_2 and TetraPure_2/ m6A tended to show enhanced Nluc expression compared to the Cap-1-containing mRNA prepared with the PureCap analog TriPure_1, or control compound Tri_1 (Fig. 8a). LNPs provided strong Nluc expression in the liver. At the same time, the expression in the spleen may also contribute to the luminescence from the left\nmouse side. This observation led us to evaluate the Nluc expression level more quantitatively using the liver and spleen homogenates. As observed in the in vivo imaging, Cap-2containing mRNA showed ~3-fold higher translation in the liver and spleen with statistical significance compared to the Cap-1containing mRNA in Nluc quantification from the homogenates (Fig. 8b, c and Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, this result demonstrated the advantage of Cap-2-mRNA over Cap-1-mRNA in increasing protein expression efficiency in animals for the first time.\nPreparation/purification of longer mRNA by the PureCap method Using the PureCapmethod,we attempted topurify cappedmRNAwith a longer sequence. As a general trend, we found that the degree of separation decreased as the length of the mRNA increased. Therefore, we designed and synthesized more hydrophobic cap analogs (Fig. 9a, 23\u201325 and Supplementary Figs. 12\u201314). The substituent at the benzyl position of Nb was changed from the original tert-butyl to more hydrophobic phenylethyl, n-hexyl, or n-undecyl in the dinucleotide PureCap analog DiPure (1). We selected 4247-nt mRNA encoding the\nreplicates (n = 8). The statistically significant differences in one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s test were marked as follows: ns, p >0.05 (not significant); *, p <0.05; **, p <0.01; ***, p <0.001, ****, p <0.0001.

In a preliminary study, the most hydrophobic compound 25 formed a precipitate in the reaction mixture, producing almost no transcript (Supplementary Fig. 20). The other three analogs successfully provided RNA transcripts according to agarose gel electrophoresis, although compound 24 caused a slight decrease in transcription efficiency (Fig. 9b). This result suggests that highly hydrophobic cap analogs may hamper the transcription reaction of T7 RNAP. Meanwhile, cap analogs with increased hydrophobicity, compounds 23 and 24, improved the separation of capped mRNA compared to the original compound 1 in RP-HPLC analysis, with a slight decrease in incorporation efficiency of cap analogs into mRNA (Fig. 9c). Notably, theproportionof a cap in thewholemRNA is 6.5-fold less in the spikemRNA compared to NlucmRNA (one cap in 4247-nt in the spike mRNA and one cap in 650-nt in Nluc mRNA), making the separation of capped and uncapped mRNAs more difficult. However, the capped and uncapped long mRNAs were still separable with the original analog DiPure (1) and the cap analogs with enhanced hydrophobicity (compounds 23 and 24). Capped mRNA was then separated twice by RP-HPLC, followed by 5\u2019-end analysis using DNAzyme 10\u201323 (Fig. 9d). 95%, 98 and 90% of cap incorporation was achieved for compounds 1, 23, and 24, respectively, after photo-cleaving and RPHPLC purification."

            "text": "Various cap analogs with different structural features have been developed to prepare cappedmRNAs by IVT19. First tomention are the dinucleotide cap analogs ARCAs21,22,39,58,60, which were designed to control the direction of introduction of the dinucleotide cap analog m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G. It was reported that methylation of the 2\u2032 or 3\u2032 hydroxyl group completely controlled the direction of strand elongation, resulting in an approximately 2\u20133-fold increase in mRNA translation activity in cultured cells58,60. Following the successful development of ARCA, many modified analogs for dinucleotide caps\nhave been developed. Many examples of modification of the phosphate moieties61,62. Extensions of triphosphate linkage to tetra- and pentaphosphates were reported, and improved translation activity of capped mRNA prepared using these analogs was reported39. The development of analogs in which bridging or non-bridging oxygen atoms were replaced by S, Se, CH2, and BH3 was also reported\n61\u201363. Synthesis of cap analogs in which a non-phosphate linkage was introduced into the phosphate moiety by the click reaction has been reported64,65. These modifications in the linkage often increase the translation activity of the mRNA, mainly because they increase its resistance to degradation by the scavenger mRNA-decapping enzyme DcpS. Synthesis of functional cap analogs that can create labeled translatable mRNA by introducing fluorescent groups or biotin into the 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 hydroxyl groups of m7G was also reported63,66,67. The introduction of a benzyl group at the N2 position of m7G or the substitution of a 7-methyl groupwith an arylmethyl groupwas reported to enhance the translation activity ofmRNA in human cultured cells58,68,69. Some cap analogs have been developed for on/off control of the mRNA translation31,70\u201372. For example, Ogasawara et al. reported the synthesis of cap analogs that contained photo-responsible groups such as phyenylazo or styryl group or at the N2 or C8 position of m7G and that their cis/trans conformation enabled photo-switchable translation control70\u201372. As the biological significance of the Cap-1 and Cap-2 structures becomes clearer, tri- and tetranucleotide cap analogs have also been developed to introduce them directly into mRNA23\u201327.\nCompared to the development of the cap structures mentioned above, much less effort has been devoted to improving capping efficiency25,67. Currently, a method to improve the incorporation efficiency of trinucleotide cap analogs exploiting their complementarity with the template is widely used25. Although the capping efficiency with this method is reported to be 80\u201390%30, further improvement of the capping efficiency will be necessary because of the substantial amount of contaminating 5\u2032 ppp-RNA that induces strong innate immunity29. As is well known, it is important to remove immunostimulatory dsRNA byproducts produced by T7 RNAP during transcription33,34. We undertook the present study to remove these byproducts for the therapeutic use of mRNA. The significance of this study lies in designing cap analogs for increasing capping efficiency, while previous studies derivatized numerous cap analogs for improving cap functionalities as mentioned above; the PureCap method we aredeveloping here is unprecedented in that it removes 5\u2032ppp-RNAby chromatography. Indeed, we succeeded in completely suppressing innate immune responses without enzymatic treatment, such as Antarctic phosphatase (Fig. 6). Further notably, the hydrophobic tag introduced for purification can be removed simply by light irradiation, leaving no unnatural modification in the capped mRNA.\nPureCap technology also provides a reliable platform to study structure-activity and the relationship of cap analogs. In cotranscriptional capping, different cap structures resulted in different capping efficiency (Fig. 5g), causing bias in their comparison. Indeed, our PureCap method achieved almost 100% capping efficiency in various capping structures, including Cap-0, Cap-1, and Cap-2, with or without modification in 2\u2032 or 3\u2032 hydroxyl of m7G and N6 position of the first transcribedA (m6A). Especially, quantitative cappingwasobtained in preparing Cap-2 mRNA, which shows low capping efficiency in the conventional method (Fig. 5g). Cap-2 mRNA thus prepared showed up to three- to four-fold higher translation activity in cultured cells and animals than mRNA prepared by standard capping methods without inducing innate immune responses (Figs. 6\u20138). Intriguingly, Cap-2 mRNA improved protein translation efficiency by approximately threefold in the liver and spleen, two major target organs of mRNA therapeutics. Numerous studies and clinical developments target the liver for treating single genedisordersproviding therapeutic proteins systemically73,74, and the spleen for cancer vaccines75,\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 12\nimmunotolerance vaccines76, and chimeric antigen receptor T cell potentiation77. The Cap-2 mRNA technology is capable of potentiating these therapeutics.\nOne issue to be resolved in the future is the low incorporation efficiency of the tetranucleotide cap analogs to give the Cap-2 structure inmRNA,whichwas about 25%of the total. Currently, wild-typeT7 RNA polymerase is used, but in the future, we would like to improve this, for example, with modification of the polymerase78. Scalability issues in the RP-HPLC purification process may be a concern. We will be able to learn from the process of the commercial-scale manufacturing of therapeutic oligonucleotides that have recently been launched79. Due to their structural complexity, these oligonucleotides are purified by HPLC even on a commercial scale80\u201382. We believe that mRNA purification above the gram scale using RP-HPLC is feasible using a system similar to that used for oligonucleotide therapeutics.\nIn summary, we synthesized quantitatively capped mRNAs by the PureCap method using synthesized hydrophobic cap analogs. To the best of our knowledge, our system provides a footprint-free purificationmethodof cappedmRNAwith 100%capping efficiency for thefirst time. Notably, increasing the capping efficiency of mRNA resulted in increased translation activity and reduced immunostimulation. Practically, this technology requires only RP-HPLC for purifying capped mRNA, avoiding repeated enzymatic treatment commonly performed for reducing mRNA immunogenicity. Furthermore, this approach is versatile to apply tomRNAwith different lengths (650 nt and 4247 nt). Achieving 100% capping efficiency in various cap species, our approach provides an unbiased platform to study their structureactivity relationship by excluding the influence of different capping efficiency observed among cap species. In this study, we prepared fully capped Cap-2 mRNA, which shows low capping efficiency in conventional methods. Ultimately, Cap-2 mRNA thus prepared showed up to three- to four-fold higher translation activity in cultured cells and animals than mRNA prepared by standard capping methods without inducing innate immune responses. Worth notably, Cap-2 mRNA improved protein translation efficiency in the liver and spleen, two major target organs ofmRNA therapeutics, providing an excellent tool for future mRNA-based medicines."

The content of Solution_B was raised from 0 to 20% over 20min. The column temperature was maintained at 50 \u00b0C. After purification of mRNA by RP-HPLC, RNA was recovered by alcohol precipitation from the eluate in the presence of NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2-propanol. RNA concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260nm on NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo).

After light irradiation, the progress of the deprotection reactionwas confirmed by the change in the elution time in RP-HPLC analysis. The deprotected capped mRNA was purified by RP-HPLC under the same conditions as above to remove residual dsRNA contamination.

When the cell number reached the order of the ninth power of 10, cultured cells were precipitated by centrifugation and washed three times with the washing buffer [35mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 140mMNaCl, and 11mM glucose] and once with the extraction buffer [20mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 45mM potassium acetate, 45mM KCl, 1.8mM magnesium acetate, and 1mM DTT]. Then, the cell pellet was suspendedwith anequal volumeof the extractionbuffer and still left in the pressure vessel (Parr Instrument company), kept under 500 psi of nitrogen gas for 30min on ice. Cells were disrupted by the sudden release of nitrogen gas pressure dissolved in the cell suspension. After disruption, 1/300 volumeof the high potassium buffer [20mMHEPESKOH (pH 7.5), 945mM potassium acetate, 945mM KCl, 1.8mM magnesium acetate, and 1mM DTT] was added to the lysate and mixed well. It was centrifuged three times at 4 \u00b0C to recover the supernatant as cell extract, being divided into aliquots and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Translationmixture composed of 0.5\u03bcL of 30 ng/\u03bcL NlucmRNA (650- nt), 4.35\u03bcL of HeLa S3 cell extract, 3.25\u03bcL of Mixure-2 [12.7mM DTT, 5.42mM magnesium acetate, 85.4mM potassium acetate, 282mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5)], 0.9\u03bcL of Mixture-3 [12.6mMATP, 1.22mMGTP, 200mM creatine phosphate, 0.6mg/mL creatine kinase, 0.08\u20131.2mM 20-amino acids mixture], was incubated at 32 \u00b0C. The expression of Nluc was measured after 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6 h using Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Statistical analysis of the data was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software.\nTranslation activity measurement of Nluc mRNA using mice For lipid nanoparticle (LNP) preparation, 595 \u03bcg/mL of mRNA was dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 3.0) and lipid mixture from D-LinMC3-DMA (MedChemExpress), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC, Wako), cholesterol (Sigma), and 1,2-dimyristoylrac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG2000, Avanti) was dissolved in ethanol at D-Lin-MC3-DMA/DSPC/Sigma/ DMG-PEG2000 molar ratio of 50/10/38.5/1.5 and total ethanol concentration of 35mM. The citrate buffer and ethanol solution were mixed at a volume ratio of 2 to obtain a nitrogen/phosphate ratio of 5 using microfluidics (NanoAssemblr\u00ae Spark, Precision Nanosystems). The solvent was exchanged for PBS by diluting the solution 40-fold and concentrating LNP using Amicon Ultra-15\u201330K centrifugal units (Merck Millipore). About 2 \u03bcg of mRNA encapsulated in LNP was injected into Balb/c mouse (female, 7-week-old, Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. Housing conditions were maintained as follows: 12-h/12-h dark/light cycle, 23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2657 14\ntemperature and 40 to 60% humidity). For in vivo imaging, 5 \u03bcg/ mouse of furimazine (Chem Shuttle) was injected from the mouse tail vein. Immediately after the injection, the mouse was observed using IVIS Spectrum SP-BFM-T1 (Perkin Elmer). The liver and spleen were excised at 4 h after the LNP injection for quantification using tissue homogenates. The organs were homogenized with Passive lysis buffer (Promega), followed by luciferase assay using Lumat3 LB9508 luminometer (Berthold Technologies) and Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Kaleida Graph 5.0 software.\nPreparation and purification of spike protein mRNA of SARSCoV-2 Reaction conditions in the transcription of capped 4247-nt mRNA encoding spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 using cap analogs were the sameas that of 650-ntNlucmRNA. IVT templatewaspreparedby a PCR reaction using poly-dT80-containing reverse PCRprimer to introduce a poly-A80 tail to mRNA. mRNA sequence is described in the Supplementary Information file. Transcribed mRNA was analyzed and purified by RP-HPLC using YMC-TriartBio C18 column (YMC corp., 250\u00d7 4.6mm I.D., TA30S05-2546PTH) on Shimadzu ProminenceHPLC system (pump, LC-20AD; detector, SPD-M40) with Solution_A (100mM TEAA (pH 7.0) containing 5% acetonitrile) and Solution_B (100mM TEAA (pH 7.0) containing 50% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1mL/min. The content of Solution_B was raised from 15 to 22% over 30min. The column temperature was maintained at 50 \u00b0C."
