Impact of Different Regulatory Policies on Information Disclosure and Market Dynamics: Investigate how various regulatory frameworks across sharing economies (e.g., data protection laws, marketplace rules) influence sellers' strategies for information disclosure and pricing. This research can include simulation models and empirical studies to understand the impact of regulatory environments on market equilibria, competition, and consumer welfare.

Role of Technology in Enhancing Transparency and Trust: Explore the development and integration of blockchain and AI technologies to improve transparency and trust in sharing systems. This could involve creating decentralized platforms that ensure secure and verifiable information disclosure, studying the impact on sellers' willingness to share information, and evaluating changes in buyer behavior and market efficiency.

Cross-Market Analysis of Information Disclosure Strategies: Conduct comparative studies of information disclosure behaviors across different sharing economy platforms (e.g., accommodation vs. car sharing vs. freelance services). This research would identify unique market dynamics, uncover best practices for information disclosure, and propose platform-specific strategies to enhance user experience and platform reputation.

Psychological and Behavioral Economics Factors Affecting Disclosure Decisions: Delve into the psychological aspects influencing sellers' decisions to disclose or withhold information, including the role of risk perception, privacy concerns, and competitive behavior. Utilizing behavioral economics theories, this research can provide insights into designing mechanisms that encourage optimal disclosure, benefiting both sellers and buyers.

Longitudinal Study of Market Evolution and Adaptation Strategies: Examine how sharing economy markets evolve over time with changes in technology, consumer preferences, and regulatory landscapes. This would involve longitudinal studies tracking the adaptation strategies of sellers and platforms, the emergence of new equilibria, and the long-term impact on market structure and consumer satisfaction.
