    "abstractText": "This experimental assessment was carried out to study the viscoelastic performance of crude oil-xanthan emulsions employing a RheoStress RS100 rheometer. Crude oil with a concentration range of 0\u201375% by volume was used to prepare the oil-gum emulsions. Two xanthan gums of Sigma and Kelzan were added in the emulsions with concentration ranges of 0\u2013104 ppm. The linear viscoelastic ranges of all the tested oil-gum emulsions were found in the range of 0.1\u201310 Pa. Thus, the experimental tests were completed within the linear viscoelastic range of 1 Pa. The complex modulus increased gradually and steadily with frequency and gum concentration for all the examined emulsions. The addition of crude oil into the lighter xanthan concentration of <103 ppm provided almost the same behavior as the xanthan solution, whereas the presence of crude oil within the higher xanthan concentrations significantly stimulated the measured values of the complex modulus. For lower gum concentrations of up to 1000 ppm, oil concentration displayed no effect on both the storage and loss moduli, whereas for gum concentrations higher than 1000 ppm, both moduli increased gradually with crude oil concentration.",

            "text": "The application of polymer solutions in the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) stage is very helpful to preserve the crude oil production rate at the economical level after traditional techniques have been completed. As explained by Arjmand et al. (2012), Wang et al. (2013), and Wei et al. (2018), the pumping of polymer aqueous solutions into an oil formation is very efficient to acquire a substantial quantity of retained oil [1\u20133]. Therefore, the injection of polymer solutions into oil wells can be utilized effectively to extract more oil via raising the viscosity of the injected solution [4]. Polymers are employed in EOR as thickeners to modify the rheological characteristics of the aqueous phase to improve the mobility ratio and sweep efficiency and to escalate recovery and oil production rates [5]. This situation causes the development of a crude oil-polymer emulsion, i.e., the occurrence of distributed oil droplet phase within the continuous immiscible phase [6]. It is important to assess oil droplet phase involvement within the aqueous continuous phase to understand the oil displacement mechanism of polymer solutions. Many experimental investigations have been carried out on the rheological measurements of emulsions in which the continuous phase is Newtonian fluid [7\u20139]. For a low concentration of oil phase within an aqueous phase, viscosity rises linearly with oil concentration. For a medium oil concentration, viscosity increases nonlinearly, while the emulsion is still Newtonian. However, at high oil concentrations, emulsions show nonNewtonian pseudoplastic behavior with associated yield stress at oil concentrations higher\nPolymers 2023, 15, 470. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15020470 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 470 2 of 16\nthan 75% [10\u201312]. A lesser number of studies can be found on experimental rheological investigations of oil emulsion where a non-Newtonian polymeric solution is used as a continuous phase [6,13,14]. Sosa-Herrera et al. examined the rheological characteristics of an oil-water emulsion in which 30% sunflower oil and different sodium caseinate and gellan gum amounts were added [15]. They found low viscosity values and almost Newtonian behavior for caseinate, gellan gum, and mixed caseinate and gellan aqueous solutions. In addition, they noticed that the emulsions without gellan exhibited almost Newtonian behavior, whereas in the presence of 0.03% or higher gellan within an emulsion, the nonNewtonian behavior of shear thinning response was detected. Numerous experimental studies are available on the rheological behavior of dispersed solid particles in liquid emulsions [16\u201320]. The polysaccharide biopolymer xanthan gum is considered to be the most commonly used polymer in the flooding stage. Kamal et al. (2015) and Agi et al. (2018) each reported that many biopolymers could be utilized as injected polymers in EOR, but xanthan gum is the recommended biopolymer often utilized. It is stable at high temperature and salinity, reasonable in cost, non-poisonous, and environmentally friendly [21,22]. Consequently, xanthan gum delivers various positive features, such as forming aqueous solutions of required viscosity with smaller amounts of xanthan addition and being chemically stable for function in oil well conditions [23]. Xanthan gum is a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide formed by bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas campestris. There are many important applications that include xanthan gum, including the foodstuff, cosmetic, medicine, and oil industries [24]. Chemical and physical techniques have been used to study the characteristics of xanthan solutions [25,26]. Xanthan aqueous solutions show pseudoplastic and suspending activities. This kind of flow response allows xanthan to be included in a range of useful uses, including suspension, coagulation and emulsification agents in a variety of industries, such as the medical, foods, and crude oil industries [27]. Rodd et al. (2000) investigated the flow characteristics of xanthan gum solutions [28], and Whistler et al. (1997) found pseudoplasticity behavior of xanthan gum solutions due to the formation of high-molecular-weight assemblies of stiff rod molecules [29]. Milas et al. (1979) reported that xanthan macromolecules in a well-organized helical arrangement stiffened a polysaccharide solution [30], and this led the xanthan solution to be one of the stiffest natural biopolymers [31]. Morris (1995) and Sato et al. (1984) each reported that xanthan molecules formed stiff rods at low molecular weights and stiff, wormlike coils at high molecular weights [32,33]. Study of the viscoelastic characteristics of crude oil-xanthan emulsions is useful to understand the flow behavior of these emulsions in the EOR phase. The viscoelastic behavior of crude oil-gum emulsions is important for many practical practices, such as those in the crude oil industry. The purpose of this investigation is to explore the viscous and elastic behaviors for different crude oil-xanthan emulsions. For the current study, oscillated stresses are applied on a prepared crude oil-xanthan emulsion and compared against time. The resulting deformation is observed and analyzed. Viscoelastic materials contain long-chain molecular structures. At a minimum energy level, these molecules merge and loop with each other to provide a complicated arrangement. When oscillated stresses are applied, these molecules stretch and surge the bond vector angles, and their energy states are elevated. Predicting and understanding crude oil-xanthan emulsion flow behavior is necessary for the selection, design, and operation of equipment used in the preparing and pumping processes. The current work focuses on studying viscoelastic behavior in terms of complex, storage, and loss moduli for crude oil-xanthan gum emulsions employing a RheoStress RS100 rheometer. A wide range of crude oil and xanthan gum concentrations are covered in the presence of two types of xanthan gums.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 470 3 of 16"

            "text": "2.1. Materials 2.1.1. Crude Oil\nNorth Sea crude was supplied by Shell Canada Limited with a viscosity equal to 7.16 mPas at 40 \u25e6C, a density of 880.6 kg/m3 at 15 \u25e6C, and an API of 29.1 at 288 K. The crude oil had an acid number of 0.0012 Kg KOH/Kg, which was obtained through the ASTM D664 standard titration procedure. Crude oil-gum emulsions were organized from crude oil, xanthan gum aqueous solution, and surfactant material. Two crude oil concentrations of 25% and 75% by volume were added into the polymer solutions to prepare the crude oil-xanthan emulsions. These two concentrations of crude oil were designated to represent typical examples of low and high crude oil involvement within gum emulsions.\n2.1.2. Emulsifying Agent\nA surfactant material was required to formulate the crude oil-gum emulsions. A surfactant material is usually added into the oil-aqueous phase system as an emulsifying agent to achieve two objectives. The first one is to decrease the interfacial tension between the oil phase and the aqueous solution phase, hence forming an emulsion system. The second objective is to stabilize the occurrence of the oil droplet phase within the aqueous continuous phase to prevent the coalescence mechanism between oil droplets [7]. Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd.,) was utilized as an emulsifying agent, with a specific gravity of 1.07 and a flash point of 113 \u25e6C.\n2.1.3. Xanthan Gums\nTwo kinds of xanthan gums were used for this study. The first xanthan type was of chemical grade (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON L6H 6J8, Canada), with a product name and number of Sigma and G1253, respectively. The other type was of industrial grade (CP Kelco, Atlanta, GA 30339, USA), with a product name and number of Kelzan and 10040282, respectively. These two kinds of xanthan gums were acquired and used without any extra treatment. Both kinds were white-to-tan-colored powders, with a molecular weight of 241.112 g/mol and a molecular formula of C8H14Cl2N2O2 utilized for non-food applications, such as thickening and rheology control agents. The tested gum solutions were prepared by adding the xanthan powder slightly into a quarter liter of warm distilled water until all the gum completely dissolved. This study examined a wide range of concentrations over the range of 0\u2013104 ppm for the two types of gum materials. An amount of 1 gm of formaldehyde was dissolved into the samples, which were stored at 4 \u25e6C to avoid bacterial growth.\n2.2. Methods 2.2.1. Rheometer\nA Rheostress RS100 rheometer (Haake GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to carry out all the required measurements at a room temperature of 22 \u25e6C using the oscillation (OSC) mode of the cone-plate sensor. A water bath was attached to the RS100 instrument to control the assigned temperature. The RS100 reheometer inspected the resulting deformation of the examined emulsions with a digital encoder, which processed one million impulses per revolution to allow the detection of small strain values. The RS100 operating system could be simply switched between different operating modes; it also assigned oscillating stress and frequency sweeps. The sensor devised of the RS100 comprised of a stainless-steel cone and plate of 35 mm in diameter, with a 0.137 mm gap at the cone tip and a 4\u25e6 cone angle [34].\n2.2.2. Dynamic Test\nTo address the viscoelastic characteristics of the crude oil-xanthan emulsions, we utilized a dynamic test in which the applied stress oscillated in a sinusoidal time function within the controlled stress mode of the RS100 instrument, as shown in Equation (1) [35].\nPolymers 2023, 15, 470 4 of 16\nThe effects and the outcomes of the applied oscillating stresses on a given material were studied.\n\u03c4 = \u03c4a sin (w t) (1)\nwhere \u03c4 is the applied shear stress in Pa, \u03c4a is the stress amplitude in Pa, and w is the frequency in s\u22121. Equation (2) introduces the complex modulus G* in Pa, which designated the sample total resistance for the imposed stress and can be given as follows [35]:\nG* = \u03c4a/\u03b3o (2)\nwhere \u03b3o is the strain amplitude in -. The complex modulus G* comprises both the storage or elastic modulus term G\u2032 and the viscous or loss modulus term G\u2032 \u2032. The elastic modulus term described the stress energy that could be stored through the experiment and could be recovered, while the other term of the viscous modulus signified the stress energy dissipated to initiate the flow that was permanently spent into shear heat. For only viscous behavior, the test results showed that the viscous modulus G\u2032 \u2032 almost equaled the complex modulus G*. However, for purely elastic behavior, the results specified that the elastic modulus G\u2032 almost equaled the complex modulus."

            "text": "A prior study on crude oil-xanthan emulsion flow behavior reported non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior in which the shear stresses of these emulsions relied on shear rate, crude oil, and xanthan concentrations. The apparent viscosities of the examined crude oil emulsions were higher than their corresponding aqueous solutions. For lower crude oil concentrations of \u226425% and gum concentrations of \u22641000 ppm, crude oil-gum emulsions displayed analogous viscosity behaviors, regardless of the gum type. The Casson model shown in Equation (3) could be utilized to predict the experimental measurements of crude oil-xanthan emulsions over the examined concentration range [36]. The xanthan solutions exhibited shear-thinning behavior in which the viscosity weakened with shear rate. Similar profiles were observed and reported by both Yeon et al. (2014) and Khan et al. (2018) [37,38]. Jha et al. (2018 and 2021) evaluated the influence of polymers on the rheological characteristics of oil-water emulsions and the consequences of xanthan gum on drilling fluids. These studies concluded significant shear-thinning profiles of the examined emulsions [39,40].\n\u03c4 = [\u03c4o 0.5 + ( . \u03b3\u03b7c) 0.5 ] 2\n(3)\nwhere \u03c4 is the shear stress in Pa, \u03c4o is the apparent yield stress in Pa, . \u03b3 is the shear rate in s\u22121, and \u03b7c is the Casson apparent viscosity in Pa.s. It is important to utilize the stress sweep test on crude oil-xanthan emulsions to determine the linear viscoelastic range. This is the range where the complex modulus remains unaffected with the applied stress. This examination excluded considering the viscoelastic features of emulsions within the non-linear viscoelastic range. Within the nonlinear viscoelastic range, the sample structure is stressed considerably to the level that the temporary bonds are demolished, and a significant contribution of the introduced energy disappears as heat [35]. Different crude oil-xanthan emulsions of low, medium, and high concentrations were examined through stress sweep tests over the applied stress range of 0.1\u2013100 Pa. The results showed that the linear viscoelastic ranges for all the tested emulsions were found in the range of 0.1\u201310 Pa. Accordingly, all the following measurements were carried out at the applied stress of 1 Pa to confirm that the crude oil emulsion samples were tested within the linear viscoelastic range."

For all the examined emulsions with xanthan concentrations less than 103 ppm, Table 2 exhibits minor values with slight changes in Go and a power index n of almost 2. For the other concentrations of \u2265103 ppm, Table 2 displays much higher values of Go with xanthan addition.\nG* = [Go 0.5 + B0.5 w]n (4)\nPolymers 2023, 15, 470 7 of 16\nTo explore the role of the crude oil within the crude oil-xanthan emulsions, the complex modulus G* of the selected xanthan solutions with concentration ranges of 250\u20135000 ppm and their corresponding emulsions were experimentally studied using oscillatory shear effect over the range of 0.05\u201310 s\u22121. Figure 2a,b illustrate complex modulus behavior versus frequency for different concentrations of Sigma and Kelzan, respectively. The reported experimental values of the complex modulus increased steadily and gradually with frequency for all the examined Sigma and Kelzan solutions. For the lower concentrations of Sigma and Kelzan, the G* varied almost linearly with the applied frequency, as can be concluded from Figure 2a,b. On the other hand, for the higher concentrations of 1000 and 5000 ppm, the reported G* behavior exhibited non-linear behavior that was different from that described for the lighter concentration. Both Figure 2a,b display the significant role of xanthan concentration at low frequencies, which vanished gradually with increasing frequency to the level that all the reported curves approached each other and developed into nearly one curve at a frequency of 10 s\u22121. The addition of the crude oil into the lighter xanthan concentration provided almost the same behavior for the xanthan aqueous solutions. However, as seen in Figure 2a,b, the existence of the crude oil within the higher xanthan concentrations of 103 and 5000 ppm significantly promoted the measured values of the complex modulus due to the generated interactions between the crude oil droplet phase and the three-dimensional network structure of the xanthan gum. As has been concluded by Ghannam (2003) and Ghannam et al. (2014), the addition of crude oil into the polymer solution enhanced the dynamic viscosity of the prepared emulsions due to droplet interaction and collision with the formed polymer networks [6,36].

The presence of the dispersed crude oil phase within the xanthan gum continuous phase improved the resistance of the emulsion deformation, which could be generated from the strong interactions and collisions between the oil phase and the polymer network [6,36]. The complex modulus behavior of the crude oil-xanthan emulsions was in consent with the features of the flow behavior discussed earlier due to the existence of the oil phase [36]. Sosa-Herrera et al. (2008) found that the elastic contribution of oil emulsions was higher than that of polymer solutions due to the occurrence of the distributed oil droplets within the polymer solution [15,44]. Furthermore, higher addition of the dissolved xanthan materials resulted in higher G* measurements, as can be found in Figure 3. Therefore, Figure 3 displays the enhancement role for the presence of crude oil within the xanthan solutions on the measured values of G*.

Figure 9 displays the effect of crude oil concentration over the range of 0\u201375% by volum on the behavior of G\u2032 and G\u2032 \u2032 for Sigma emulsions. Two different frequency values of 1.35 and 9.24 s\u22121, as typical examples of low and high frequencies, are presented in Figure 9a,b, respectively. Both Figures exhibit that all the tested emulsions provided significantly higher storage modulus values than their counterpart of loss modulus for each xanthan concentration. For the lower xanthan concentration of 1000 ppm, oil concentration revealed no effect on either G\u2032 or G\u2032 \u2032 for the two cases of frequencies. However, for the xanthan concentrations higher than 1000 ppm, G\u2032 and G\u2032 \u2032 grew gradually with the crude oil concentration. Nakamura et al. (2004) reported that the surface charges of xanthan molecules permitted for the interconnection for the oil and xanthan surfaces [46]. Many investigations have reported that hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions show strong influences on oil-gum structures [47]. Jiang et al. (2020) noted that the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions of oil-gum emulsions developed pseudoplastic behaviors with oil elastic response [48]. Accordingly, these results for crude oil-xanthan emulsions were ascribed as follows: firstly, the existence of the high xanthan concentration continuous phase, which was viscoelastic in principle; secondly, an oil droplet distributed phase with high concentration, which displayed some degree of elastic behavior; and thirdly, the elasticity responses that were generated from the interactions between the oil droplets and the xanthan networks formed within the emulsions. From the general observation of the current study, the crude oil-xanthan e ulsions showed viscoelastic activities for all the studied xanthan types and crude oil concentrations.

Understanding the xanthan emulsion behavior through viscoelastic investigations under different conditions had a significant impact and offered important knowledge of the used polymer molecular structures, which facilitated the ability to change molecular structure to achieve special application needs. Once the assigned frequency exceeded the crossing point between the viscous and elastic profiles, the common concluded behavior was that G\u2032 significantly surpassed G\u2032 \u2032. This result reflected that the elastic activities dictated the overall behavior, which is usual for gel- and solid-like behaviors. Furthermore, this indicates that some sort of networks were structured within crude oil-xanthan emulsions [49].\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000 G\" G' 5000 ppm Sigma Oil % 0.0 25 75 G ' a nd G '', Pa w, s-1 Figure 7.

For the xanthan concentration of 1000 ppm, Figure 8-a shows that both xanthan emulsions exhibited elastic behavior for frequencies higher than 0.3 s\u22121 since the G\u1fef for both emulsions were positioned above their G\u1fef\u1fef curves. Furthermore, Figure 8-a displays that the 25% crude oil-Sigma emulsion resulted in higher G\u1fef and G\u1fef\u1fef values than the corresponding values for the 25% crude oil-Kelzan emulsion up to the frequency of 3 s\u22121. For the higher xanthan concentration of 5000 ppm, Figure 8b shows that the emulsions of both Sigma and Kelzan illustrated similar profiles with mostly elastic behavior, as the storage modulus values were located well above t e loss modulus for the whole range of the examined frequency.\n0.1 1 10 0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000 (a)\nG\"\nG'\nXanthan = 1000 ppm Crude Oil = 25% Vol\nSigma Kelzan\nG ' a\nnd G\n'', Pa\nw, s-1\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 19\n0.1 1 10 100\n1000\n10000 (b)\nG\"\nG'\nXanthan = 5000 ppm Crude Oil = 25% Vol\nSigma Kelzan\nG ' a\nnd G\n'', Pa\nw, s-1\nFigure 8.

            "text": "A viscoelastic investigation of crude oil-xanthan emulsions in terms of complex, storage, and loss moduli was completed. All the tested emulsions exhibited linear viscoelastic behavior within the range of 0.1\u201310 Pa. For gum concentrations of \u2265103 ppm, the gum addition displayed a strong effect on the complex modulus G* behavior in a linear profile, followed by non-linear behavior at a certain critical frequency. The results of the Sigma and Kelzan emulsions reported almost similar wc values, which rose with gum concentration. The m thematical model of Equation (4) could be used to describe the complex modulus behavior. The existence of cr e oil within the lower gum additions of <103 ppm ex ibited almost similar behavior to the gum s lutions, while the ccurrence of crude oil\nithin the higher xanth n concentrati ns increased the measured v lues of G* considerably. For the lowe co cent ati ns of 1000 pm xanthan and 25% crude oil, the G* values of Sigma were significantly higher than the reported values of t e Kelzan emulsion. This diverge ce betwee the Sigma d Ke za s declined with the greater addition of crude o l. For he higher gum content of 5000 pp , both Sigma and Kelzan illus rated comparable and adjacent behaviors for the 25% and 75% crude oil emulsions. F r the lower gum contents of \u2264103 ppm, the G* displayed i dependent behavior from crude oil addition, whereas the role of crude oil addition was much more substantial in the presence of xanthan content >103 ppm due to oil droplet interactions with the xanthan network structure. The storage modulus G\u2032 increased with oil addition in the presence of\nPolymers 2023, 15, 470 15 of 16\nhigher xanthan content due to strong interactions between the oil droplets and the xanthan network structure. For the xanthan content of \u22651000 ppm, both the Sigma and Kelzan emulsions displayed mainly elastic behavior for frequencies higher than 0.3 s\u22121. For the higher xanthan concentration of 5000 ppm, both the Sigma and Kelzan emulsions exhibited similar profiles, with mostly elastic behavior. For the xanthan content of \u2264103 ppm, both G\u2032 and G\u2032 \u2032 showed independent behavior from oil concentration. However, for xanthan concentrations of >103 ppm, both moduli rose gradually with crude oil.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.T.G.; Methodology, M.T.G. and N.E.; Software, N.E.; Validation, M.Y.E.S. and A.Y.Z.; Investigation, M.T.G.; Resources, M.Y.E.S., A.Y.Z. and N.E.; Data curation, M.Y.E.S.; Writing\u2014original draft, M.T.G. and M.Y.E.S.; Writing\u2014review & editing, A.Y.Z.; Project administration, A.Y.Z. and N.E.
