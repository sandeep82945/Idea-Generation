    "abstractText": "Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is critical to cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is important to understand the binding affinity between TGF-\u03b21 and its receptors. In this study, their binding force was measured using an atomic force microscope. Significant adhesion was induced by the interaction between the TGF-\u03b21 immobilized on the tip and its receptor reconstituted in the bilayer. Rupture and adhesive failure occurred at a specific force around 0.4~0.5 nN. The relationship of the force to loading rate was used to estimate the displacement where the rupture occurred. The binding was also monitored in real time with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and interpreted with kinetics to acquire the rate constant. Using the Langmuir adsorption, the SPR data were analyzed to estimate equilibrium and association constants to be approximately 107 M\u22121 and 106 M\u22121 s\u22121. These results indicated that the natural release of the binding seldom occurred. Furthermore, the degree of binding dissociation, confirmed by the rupture interpretation, supported that the reverse of the binding hardly happened.",

            "text": "Transforming-growth-factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) is a cytokine that plays multifunctional roles in major regulatory signaling pathways [1]. Once TGF-\u03b21 ligands bind to the extracellular domains of their receptors, the receptors form a serine/threonine kinase complex with other factors [2]. This complex activates a signaling cascade for biological processes such as development, proliferation, differentiation, and migration [3]. Since the pathway is involved in these processes, its inhibition has been considered as a potential drug target [4]. Two theoretical approaches\u2014kinase targeting and formation interruption\u2014have potential for this inhibition. Most of the current approaches are based on kinase targeting, which lacks specificity and can lead to side effects. Therefore, formation interruption via the disruption of the binding of the TGF-\u03b21 ligands to their receptors was investigated. However, the mechanism behind the activation is little understood. Supported lipid bilayers have been widely utilized as biomimetic platforms, where membrane protein has been reconstituted for further investigations on apoptosis, transport, signal transduction, and energy production [5\u20138]. These bilayers are accessible to analytical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, neutron reflectometry, quartz crystal micro-balance, surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [9\u201317]. AFM has been used to investigate the morphology and the mechanics of these bilayers with the surface force measurements under physiological conditions, while SPR allows for the real-time\nMembranes 2023, 13, 446. https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes13040446 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes\nMembranes 2023, 13, 446 2 of 6\nmonitoring of their formation and interaction in a label-free manner and with pM-scale sensitivity. In this study, we wanted to investigate the binding information between TGF-\u03b21 and its receptor reconstituted in biomimetic membranes. This information\u2014force, kinetics, and equilibrium\u2014may represent a novel approach for diagnosis or therapy associated with TGF-\u03b21."

No, HY-P78524, MedChemExpress) was reconstituted in biomimetic membranes made with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphothioethanol (DPPTE) and dioleoylphosphatidylcho line (DOPC) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). First, a lipid monolayer was formed via thiol-tethering between lipid headgroups and gold surfaces. Then, another lipid monolayer was created on the formed previously monolayer. This creation was generated through vesicle fusion via hydrophobic interaction. Last, the binding site to TGF-\u03b21 was only distributed on the outer layer. Gold surfaces (BIAcore SA, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) were covered with a solution (sulfuric acid:hydrogen peroxide = 3:1) at 60 \u25e6C for 10 min and dried with nitrogen stream immediately before the surfaces were immersed in 2 mL of chloroform of 1 mM DPPTE and 0.5 mM DOPC for 2 h. After DOPC vesicles were prepared for fusion into a 10 mg/mL lipid concentration and analyzed according to the procedures published previously, 10 \u00b5L of 1 \u00b5g/mL TGF-\u03b21 receptor II in ethanol was added to 1 mL of the vesicle solution for reconstitution [18]. Force measurements were performed identically to the procedures published previously [19]. Prior to the TGF-\u03b21 immobilization, the cantilever was treated with 0.1 mM 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid and 0.9 mM 1-mercapto-1-undecanol (MUD) in ethanol and an ethanoic solution of 15 mg/mL 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 6 mg/mL N-hydroxysuccinimide in sequence. Then, the cantilever was rinsed with DI water and incubated with 0.1 mg/mL TGF-\u03b21 for 2 h. The forces were measured between the cantilever and the reconstituted membrane and collected as curves with respect to a cantilever position. Only the curves with the highest adhesion among the collections were interpreted. SPR was observed following the procedures described in the previous publication [20]. The membrane formation was repeated with identical steps to the force measurement above. The concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 \u00b5M."

            "text": "Little substantial attraction was observed between TGF-\u03b21 receptor II and the MUDs, and this observation showed that the MUDs made a great background for measuring the TGF-\u03b21-specific interaction. In contrast to the attraction between TGF-\u03b21 receptor II and the MUDs, the attraction between the DOPC layer and the TGF-\u03b21 immobilized on the tip was 0.06 to 0.1 nN. The attraction between TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b21 receptor II was clearly distinguished: 0.4 to 0.5 nN. These attractions are shown in the plot of the force versus the surface distance (Figure 1). Not only the magnitude of the attraction but also the snap-off was significantly different. Therefore, the attraction of the DOPC layer seemed to be non-specific membrane-adhesion force, while the attraction of TGF-\u03b21 receptor II did seem to be specific. The strong snap-off may have arisen from either the rupture of the specific TGF-\u03b21 bond or the detachment of TGF-\u03b21 receptor II from the membrane. Since the attraction was measured repeatedly, the surface was reversibly modified by the measurements. Therefore, the snap-off resulted from the rupture. Furthermore, previous studies suggested that the lipid layer on the solid substrate was unperturbed with loads of more than 0.6 nN [21]. Therefore, the specific bond between TGF-\u03b21 and its receptor was ruptured before the lipid bilayer was disturbed. The range of 0.4 to 0.5 nN was attributed to the change in the orientations of TGF-\u03b21 and its receptor and their location during the load.\nMembranes 2023, 13, 446 3 of 6 Membranes 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 6\nFigure 1.

Real-Time Binding The binding formation between TGF-\u03b21 and its receptor was monitored with respect to time using the SPR response, as shown in Figure 2. A baseline, before point 1, was established at the receptor reconstituted under the buffer solution. At point 1, the TGF-\u03b21 solution was injected. The amount of the bound TGF-\u03b21 was increased with its concentration. The TGF-\u03b21 receptors were mostly occupied at a solution of more than 0.5 \u00b5M TGF\u03b21. Therefore, the response at 2 \u00b5M was clearly presumed to be for all receptors.\nFigure 2.

Linear relation between reciprocal of coverage fraction and reciprocal concentration. The linear relation is located in the range of the limits.\nBecause koff was found from the analysis of the rupture force, the association rate was estimated to be approximately 106 M\u22121 s\u22121. This rate was also close to the results published previously [25]. The association rate seemed consistent with the rapid increase in the SPR curve right after the TGF-\u03b21 injection, while a slight decrease was observed for more than 1000 s after the equilibrium was reached. This interpretation suggested that little reverse reaction happened. Since the TGF-\u03b21 coverages were acquired under the condition of the unbound TGF\u03b21 and its receptor, the reverse reaction may be still of concern. However, the analysis of the rupture force indicated little occurrence of the reaction. The binding energy, estimated from the multiplication of the rupture force and the displacement, was approximately 5.0 \u00d7 10\u221219 J, 200 times higher than the thermal fluctuation at room temperature.
