Mona Lisa (or Monna Lisa), aka La Gioconda, is one of the world\u2019s most iconic artworks and also one of the most studied not only by art historians but also by vision scientists. The titles Mona Lisa and La Gioconda are both derived from Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574, Italian painter, architect, and art historian), best known for his book Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\nVasari identified the sitter in LeonardoDaVinci\u2019s masterpiece as Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Hence, when Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588\u20131657, Italian scholar and art collector) wrote d\u2019una tal Gioconda referring to the masterpiece he saw during his visit to Fontainebleau in 1625, he was most likely making a play of words, given that in Italian \u2018\u2018giocondo\u2019\u2019 means both \u2018\u2018playful\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018he who brings joy\u2019\u2019. In more than one sense, La Gioconda has indeed proven to be playful (Pedretti, 1956).\nWhile in more recent times several art historians have challenged Vasari\u2019s account (e.g., Pedretti, 1956; Zapperi, 2012), troubling themselves in trying to figure out the real identity of the woman portrayed, several vision scientists have, instead, dabbled with the elusive quality of Mona Lisa\u2019s facial expression, as if it were a visual illusion. The portrait, in fact, is considered to have an enigmatic facial expression, sometimes smiling, sometimes not, but always with her gaze fixed on the observer, whatever her/his position in front of the painting. The goal of most studies has been, therefore, to uncover the factors underlying the mobility of Mona Lisa\u2019s expression. Research has focused mostly on her gaze or on her smile. As stated above, this article also deals with the direction of Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze and with her smile, the last, however, still in reference to her gaze, seeking for an answer to the question: is she smiling with her eyes? Hence, this article will look into Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes by reporting results from two studies. The first study, was devoted entirely to the direction of Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze; in the second study, instead, we considered both her gaze and the affective expression of her eyes. The studies we present here were conducted before the sars-cov-2 outbreak."

            "text": "By googling \u2018\u2018Mona Lisa effect\u2019\u2019 one finds over 43,000,000 results related to the phenomenon of a portrait\u2019s eyes (be it a drawing, a painting, or a photograph) that appear to stare at those who are observing the picture, whatever their position and despite their moving about while looking at the picture. However, recently Horstmann and Loth (2019) have produced empirical evidence showing that the gaze of Mona Lisa is directed approximately at 15.4\u25e6 to the right side of the observer. In other words, she should appear to be not looking at us. Nevertheless, not only the vulgate, but also several vision scientists believe, or at least take for granted, that Mona Lisa is staring at us (e.g., Rogers et al., 2003; Todorovic, 2006; Al Moubayed et al., 2012; Boyarskaya et al., 2015). In fact, several years ago, in a small workshop on the psychology of art, we also argued that Mona Lisa is not actually looking at the observer, claiming that her gaze is oriented to the right of the viewer\u2019s head. To our astonishment, most of our peers were in total disagreement. We, therefore, started to review the issue by considering how people get to know about this masterpiece.\nThere are obviously several possibilities, but the most common is by seeing a reproduction in a book, a magazine, on the web, or by going to the Louvre. However, in the first three cases, reproductions are most likely heavily scaled in size, whilst in the last case, because of important security measures, Mona Lisa would be seen from an average distance of about\n3\u20133.5 m. Considering that the painting measures 77 \u00d7 53 cm, the average retinal sizes of the entire painting would not go much beyond 14 \u00d7 10 deg during a visit to the Louvre, which is even smaller than the retinal sizes one may have by looking at a digital reproduction of the painting on a laptop. We, therefore, considered retinal size as the main factor that may impact the impression whether Mona Lisa is staring at the observer or not. To test this hypothesis, we decided to work with a more \u2018\u2018ecological\u2019\u2019 setup, similar to one of the setups employed by Soranzo and Newberry (2015) to study La bella principessa, in which angular sizes were manipulated by the distance of observation of artworks."

The within factor was the viewing distance of the stimulus, which had six levels: 55 cm (47.41 \u00d7 33.39 deg), 110 cm (24.76 \u00d7 17.06 deg), 220 cm (12.52 \u00d7 8.57 deg), 420 cm (6.58 \u00d7 4.49), 520 cm (5.31 \u00d7 3.63 deg), and 755 cm (3.66 \u00d7 2.50 deg). The between factor was the first distance of observation, which was set at either 55 or 755 cm. The task was simply to respond to the following question: Is the person portrayed looking at you? Answers were dichotomous, being simply yes or no. Hence participants either started the experiment by looking at the stimulus from 55 cm and moving backward to look at it from each of the subsequent further distances, or, vice versa, by looking at the stimulus from 755 cm and moving forward to each of the next closest distances. The purpose of the within variable distance was to test for eventual changes in participants\u2019 responses due to distance; the purpose of the between variable first distance was to control for an eventual carryover effect related to participants\u2019 answers from the first two positions of observation.\nThe experiment took place in a long corridor of the Department of Psychology of the University of Milano-Bicocca. A text was read to the participant explaining that the task was to look at an image from different distances and to answer\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\nthe question that would have been posed for each distance of observation with a simple \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019. It was stressed that there were no right or wrong answers. The participant was then brought to the starting position of his/her group while instructed to look down at the floor. After answering the question from the first position, the participant was asked to stand up and to turn around so that their back was facing the stimulus. Hence, the chair was moved to the next position, which, based on the participant\u2019s group, was either further away or closer to the stimulus. The participant was then guided to the next position.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\nPositions were marked on the floor so that the chair would be positioned always in the exact same positions.

Wald \u03c72 statistics returned a significant effect on the model for distance (\u03c72(5,180) = 29.241, p < 0.001, w = 0.441, but neither for first distance (p > 0.4) nor the interaction first distance\u2217distance (p> 0.3).\nAs one can see from Figure 2, there is a clear-cut difference between the three nearest distances (55\u2013220 cm) and the three most remote distances (420\u2013755 cm). Pairwise comparisons between the marginal means of the factor distance, conducted within the GEE model, confirmed such differences: estimated marginal means for distances 55, 110, and 220 are not statistically distinguishable (p> 0.07), but all three are significantly different from the estimated marginal means for distances 420, 520, and 755 cm (p < 0.05). The estimated marginal mean for distance of 420 cm is statistically different from the mean for 755 cm (p < 0.05), but not from that of distance 520 cm (p > 0.1). Moreover, \u03c72 tests conducted to verify differences between yes and no responses confirm that distances 55\u2013220 cm are ambiguous (p > 0.2), whilst distances 420\u2013755 cm show a statistical difference in participants answers, in favor to the response yes (Mona Lisa is looking): 420 cm \u03c72(1,30) = 4.8, p < 0.028; 520 cm, w = 0.444; 520 cm \u03c72(1,30) = 13.33, p < 0.001, w = 0.666; 755 cm \u03c72(1,30) = 13.33, p< 0.001, w = 0.666.\nWhen looking at the portrait from the two greatest distances (520\u2013755 cm), the impression reported by most participants from both groups is that Mona Lisa is staring at them. This impression decreases significantly from position 220 cm, suggesting that Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze appears intrinsically ambiguous from closer distances, while she appears to be mostly staring back at the observer when looked at from greater distances. A possible explanation for the ambiguity of Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze may be related to the position of her head with respect to her gaze that, as measured by Horstmann and Loth (2019) is diverted to the right of the observer, while her head is slightly turned to the left, showing more of its right side."

            "text": "Results from experiment 1 support our hypothesis, according to which the impression of the direction of Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze may vary depending on the retinal size of the image. However, we also hypothesized that bigger retinal images of the picture would\ndetermine the impression that Mona Lisa is not looking at the observer.\nHere we report data concerning Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze derived from another experiment in which we studied both the direction and the smiling impression of gazes in both painted and photographic portraits. In this study, we did not manipulate the retinal size of a reproduction of La Gioconda, which was viewed from a constant distance; instead, we manipulated the portion of Mona Lisa\u2019s head that was visible: a full head, or only a section with her eyes. Such manipulation allowed us to study the role of head position in understanding the direction ofMona Lisa\u2019s gaze.\nThe general goal of the experiment, from which we extrapolated the data pertaining to Mona Lisa, was to study the role of gaze direction and expression in pictorial artifacts, factors that are known to impact mental models about a person\u2019s state (Marino et al., 2015), and, therefore, may contribute to the interpretation and aesthetic appraisal of portraits.\nWith regards to the ambiguous impressions generated by Mona Lisa\u2019s portrait, along with the direction of her gaze, also her smile is one of the aspects that has attracted the attention of several researchers. Kontsevich and Tyler (2004, p. 1493) report that Mona Lisa \u2018\u2018is the best-known example of an expression at the ambiguity point between a happy and a sad dimension\u2019\u2019. It is possible that different interpretations of Mona Lisa\u2019s affective state are related to the effect determined by her lips, which appear to be more \u2018\u2018smiling\u2019\u2019 when not directly looked at, that is when the area of interest is dominated by low spatial frequencies (Livingstone, 2000). When looking at Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes, the projection of her lips is eccentric with respect to the center of one\u2019s gaze where acuity is greater because of higher spatial frequencies. According to Livingstone, the elusive appearance of Mona Lisa\u2019s affective expression is therefore related to her smile, and to Leonardo\u2019s sfumato technique. Hence, the impression of Mona Lisa also smiling with her eyes may depend on the lips smiling more when not directly looked at.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Kontsevich and Tyler (2004) were the first to investigate whether Mona Lisa is also smiling with her eyes. They concluded that the impression one may have of Mona Lisa smiling also with her eyes is due to the mouth region: the eyes appear to be smiling only because her lips are smiling. But if we put together Livingstone\u2019s account with the conclusion drawn by Kontsevich and Tyler, we get a rather interesting contradiction. If one stares at Mona Lisa\u2019s lips, her smile dims; instead, if one looks at her eyes the smile on her lips increases, making her eyes also appear to be smiling. This means that if one looks at Mona Lisa\u2019s lips, the eyes should not appear to be smiling, as the smile \u2018\u2018fades\u2019\u2019, according to Livingstone. Hence, if the eyes are not smiling by themselves, then the impression should be of a sad Mona Lisa when looking at her lips.\nThat the mouth influences the affective expression of a face, thus also modulating the expressiveness of the eyes, should not come as a surprise: faces are rather complex and dynamic gestalts, in which changes in a core feature, such as the mouth or the eyes, will affect the \u2018\u2018whole\u2019\u2019 and also its \u2018\u2018parts\u2019\u2019. This said, the questions here are different: regardless of other facial features, is Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze fixed on the observer? Is it smiling?\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288"

Responses to session\u2019s 2 question (smiling) were analyzed with SPSS through a GEE binary logistic model for repeated measures in which participant served as the subject variable, smiling as the dependent variable, and group as between factor. The factor group (whole head vs. eyes only) did not affect the model: \u03c72(1,123) = 2.664, p = 0.1, w = 0.147. Figure 3D shows percentages of \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 responses for the two groups. The eyes appear to be smiling in both sets of stimuli.\nThe first consideration to make is that contrary to our expectations, response latencies were not significantly different between the two groups for both session tasks. We expected, in fact, both tasks to be relatively harder for group eyes-only, which would have reflected in significantly greater latencies.\nResults from session 1 show that when only Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes are visible the impression is that they are not staring at the observer, while when the whole head is visible results are ambiguous, with approximately only half of the participants seeing her not staring back at them (Figure 3B). These results suggest a major role of the position of the head in the perceived direction of Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze, as suggested also by research on gaze direction and face eccentricity (Maruyama and Endo, 1983; Todorovic, 2009). Such a factor, however, is not able to override completely the impression that her gaze is not directed towards the observer. Hence, results confirm the findings for the closest positions in experiment 1, that is when retinal images of Mona Lisa\u2019s face (and therefore of her eyes) are relatively big, and in particular when observers move closer to the portrait.\nResults from session 2 show that Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes appear to be smiling by themselves (Figure 3D); in other words, though the smile on her lips certainly adds to the expressiveness of her eyes, these alone are, however, already intrinsically smiling. Our results do not support the claim by Kontsevich and Tyler (2004), according to which her eyes appear smiling only because of the smile on her lips. Our manipulation of the image portraying Mona Lisa was different from the aforementioned study (and also from the manipulation by Livingstone, 2000): we did not manipulate the spatial frequencies of the image, nor did we apply visual noise to it. Instead, we isolated the eyes from the rest of the image, whilst Kontsevich and Tyler selectively applied random noise to the image to determine \u2018\u2018sad\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018happy\u2019\u2019 outcomes. Their Figure 4 (p. 1496) illustrates the problem related to such manipulations: while the noise applied to the lower part of the head alters dramatically the expression of the mouth, showing a frown in their panel A and an unnatural extended smile in\ntheir panel B, the noise applied to the upper part of the image does not alter in a significant way the expression of the eyes in their panels C and D. The conclusion they draw, that the smile affects the expression of the eyes, is therefore correct, but it tells nothing about the expressiveness of the eyes. By showing the eyes in isolation (Figure 3) we got rid of any effect by other facial features on their affective appearance, in particular, the effect due to the mouth: what our participants mostly saw were still smiling eyes."

            "text": "We offered an overview of the research we devoted to studying Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze (specifically or indirectly), because we believe that, along with her smile, also her eyes play a central role in the aura of mystery that accompanies the perception of the painting.\nLet us first consider findings relative to the expression of Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes. In the second study along with gaze direction we also addressed the issue of whether eyes may appear to be smiling, even when only a pair of eyes are visible. At the time the experiment was conducted we were not living under Covid-19 restrictions so we could not anticipate how interesting the issue would have become of understanding another\u2019s affective state just by looking at their eyes, in particular when the other person is wearing a mask covering mouth and nose. Considering only Mona Lisa\u2019s case, the answer to the question of whether her eyes are smiling is positive: Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes do carry a somewhat cheerful expression by themselves. This, however, does not mean that the expression depicted on Mona Lisa\u2019s face cannot change into sadness if the mouth were to be modified, as demonstrated by Kontsevich and Tyler (2004). However, given that faces are indeed complex Gestalts, it might be interesting to see whether profound modifications to the expression of Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes can also affect the overall affective interpretation of her facial expression, just as the changes in the expression of her mouth affected the expression of her eyes. However, all in all such manipulations would only tell us something about the perception of affective states, but nothing important about Da Vinci\u2019s painting.\nWith regards to the issue of where Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze is directed, our general hypothesis was that Mona Lisa is not staring at us, as the geometry explained by Horstmann and Loth (2019) informs us. However, given that most people believe that Mona Lisa is staring at them, we considered a more specific hypothesis related to retinal image sizes: we hypothesized that with relatively big retinal images of Mona Lisa\u2019s head, the impression would be that her gaze is not directed at the observer, while with relatively small retinal images the impression would be the opposite (experiment 1). We clearly found the second case to be true. This finding appears to be opposite to the findings reported by Horstmann and Loth. One might think that the issue is related to how retinal sizes weremanipulated: Horstmann and Loth manipulated retinal size without manipulating distance by zooming in and out of the portrait; we instead manipulated retinal size by manipulating viewing distances. However, such differences in manipulations should not determine different results given that even when the portrait\u2019s angular size is reduced\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\nby increased viewing distance, the focus of attention is on the portrait, and it is unlikely that other visual information from a larger field of view would interfere with one\u2019s impression of the direction of Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze. We are left with two possible explanations, which, however, are not necessarily alternative to each other. The first concerns the concept of the gaze cone (Gamer and & Hecht, 2007), an \u2018\u2018area in space that is defined by the range of gaze directions that an observer will accept as directed at him or her\u2019\u2019 (Horstmann and Linke, 2021, p. 1061). The findings reported by Horstmann and Linke support the idea of the gaze cone subtending a constant visual angle (according to the literature, the range is between \u223c5 and 10\u25e6; Gamer and & Hecht, 2007; Balsdon and & Clifford, 2018; Horstmann and Linke, 2021). The gaze cone metaphor implies that the impression of being looked at should become stronger as the distance between the looker and the person who feels looked upon increases. This might account for our findings: a very strong impression that Mona Lisa is looking directly at the observer from more distant observation distances. Nevertheless, Horstmann and Loth (2019) report Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze to be directed 15.4\u25e6 to the right of the observer, a visual angle which is way beyond the range of the cone of gaze. Hence, if the cone of gaze is responsible for the switch in impression between relatively close and relatively far observation distances, we must assume that, at least in Mona Lisa\u2019s case, the cone is not constant in shape, as the visual angle it subtends would appear to increase with distance. The second explanation that might account for the differences in findings between Horstmann and Loth (2019) and our findings applies in particular to the results of the nearest observation position (55\u2013110 cm), for which we found thatMona Lisa\u2019s gaze is intrinsically ambiguous. It is most likely that the differences between the two experiments may depend on how gaze direction was measured: Horstmann and Loth employed an indirect metric measurement, which may or may not coincide with one\u2019s impression, whilst we relied only on impressions by asking directly whether the portrait was staring or not at the participant. Results from experiment 2 for the participants who evaluated Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze seeing the whole head support the results from exp. 1, showing that with relatively big retinal images of Mona Lisa\u2019s head, observers tend to divide into two groups, those who perceive her gaze on them and those who do not. However, results from the group that only saw a section with the eyes of Mona Lisa clearly support the findings reported by Horstmann and Loth (2019). The discrepancy between the data for whole-head vs. eyes-only suggest an important role of Mona Lisa\u2019s head posture in the statistical ambiguity we found with respect to the direction of her gaze with relatively big retinal images. Results from experiment 1 also show that the impression created by Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze is dynamic, as it is likely to change more towards the impression that she is not staring at the observer as the observer moves closer to the image instead of\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\nmoving further away (which, on the other hand, supports the hypothesis that the visual angle subtended by Mona Lisa\u2019s cone of gaze increases with distance).\nIn conclusion, regardless of any measurement, one might want to perform on the direction of Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze, when conducting research in visual perception the priority is to study what is actually perceived, not what one ought to perceive based on the geometry of a scene or the theory ones adheres to (ActisGrosso and Zavagno, 2015). Hence, the fact remains that from afar (or with relatively small retinal images) the perception of Mona Lisa staring at the observer is prominent; from up close, or with relatively big retinal images, the impression becomes statistically ambiguous.\nThese findings are quite interesting, as they defy the very concept of image robustness: the painting\u2019s scenographic background, Mona Lisa\u2019s torso, and hands do not change much when one moves horizontally, or back and forth, while looking at the image; however, depending on the distance from the portrait and whether one moves closer or further away, the direction of her gaze may shift from staring at the observer to overlooking her/his left shoulder. What is the relationship between a portrait that always follows you with its eyes and the robustness of other surfaces in the portrait that do not seem to change as one moves about?"

Hence, the so-called \u2018\u2018Mona Lisa effect\u2019\u2019 is best described as one of \u2018\u2018omnidirectional staring\u2019\u2019. The illusion is obviously not limited to Mona Lisa, and it is certainly not limited to gazes: a very similar illusion can be found, for instance, in the posters designed by Alfred Leete in 1914 and by James Montgomery Flagg in 1917, depicting respectively Lord Kitchner and Uncle Sam staring and pointing their index fingers at the observer. Both gazes and fingers continue to follow and to point at viewers as they move about while looking at those images. Given that the illusion does not concern Mona Lisa alone, and that it is not limited to gazes, we dubbed the illusion as the omnidirectional pointing phenomenon (OPP).\nFor decades both common observers and visual scientists have been intrigued by OPP. However, if one considers OPP with respect to picture perception in general, a bit of wonder washes away. We believe, in fact, that OPP falls within the more general phenomenon known as robustness of perspective (Kubovy, 1986), a phenomenon that in reality extends to all images, not only to those created with linear perspective. This phenomenon consists in the fact that pictures created by obeying the rules of linear perspective do not appear distorted when not viewed from the correct position (i.e., standing right in front of the vanishing point) despite projections on the retina of such representations may undergo dramatic changes as the observer moves in space while looking at the pictures. According to recent literature, the robustness of perspective does not appear to be \u2018\u2018all or none\u2019\u2019: structures in such pictures show some degree\nof distortion when viewed from different angles (Todorovic, 2008), strongly suggesting a graded phenomenon (Pagel, 2017). Nevertheless, the phenomenological experience one has is that a picture\u2019s layout remains the same; that is, distortions are not consciously experienced or, maybe, they are just overlooked by the observer (probably because of the double nature of picture perception; Gibson, 1979; Hagen, 1986; Zavagno, 2007; Pagel, 2017), unless one tries to measure them. In this sense, the experience of robustness is most likely common to all pictures regardless of the geometry adopted to create them. To understand this point, we must consider what the robustness experience is all about, from a phenomenological point of view. Let us first consider the case of pictures that obey the rules of linear perspective: moving in front of one of such pictures determines a series of retinal projections that all differ from one another to some degree; the impression, however, is that the pictorial scene does not change in relation to a rather large range of viewing angles not orthogonal to the vanishing point. In fact, to perceive major distortions the eccentricity of one\u2019s position with respect to the vanishing point must be dearly great. This, of course, unless the image is made such as to appear as an extension of the real world. Such works are known as trompel\u2019oeil, i.e., optical illusions\u2014see for example the case of Andrea del Pozzo\u2019s (1642\u20131709) ceiling in the Church of St Ignatius in Rome (Pirenne, 1970; Kubovy, 1986).\nNow, if we consider a figurative picture not created according to the set of rules of linear perspective, as for example a child\u2019s drawing, or even somethingmuchmore sophisticated such as the Madonna in the Church by Jan van Eyck (1325\u20131441; Figure 4) which displays a rather intuitive sense of spatial perspective, we can move in front of the image and the geometry of the church, along with the Madonna with child, will appear more or less unchanged.\nWhat does all this have to do with OPP? Let us consider the painting Winter at Barbizon in Figure 5: in this marvelous wintery painting by the Romanian artist Ion Andreescu (1850\u20131882) we can see a road that from afar proceeds frontally towards us, to then turn slightly to our left. If onemoves sideways with respect to the image, one should notice that the portion of the road that appears more in distance (where the people are), right before the curve, is always facing us (always pointing in our direction), while the portion of the road that appears closer, right after the curve, never seems to really point at us. This is one of the basic facts pertaining to picture robustness: if something appears frontal to the observer it always will; if something does not, it never will.\nNow let us consider the two images in Figure 6 on the left, one of Pablo Picasso\u2019s (1881\u20131973) last self-portraits; on the right, a self-portrait by Vincent Van Gogh (1853\u20131890). While Picasso\u2019s self-portrait is starring in our direction, Van Gogh\u2019s is looking slightly to our right. We can attempt to move sideways to avoid Picasso\u2019s troubled stare; or move to our right to capture van Gogh\u2019s serious gaze, but all our attempts are doomed to fail. Picasso will continue to stare at us, and van Gogh will continue to avoid looking at us, no matter how hard we try. In both cases, the images show a strong resistance to distortion. In other words, they both prove to be robust to the point that the\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\nperceived directions of the depicted gazes never shift. Each of those gazes is like a portion of the road depicted by Andreescu. In this sense, both OPP and what we here playfully name the never pointing phenomenon (NPP) are actually one and the same thing, both being just instances of picture robustness. We believe that once the mechanisms driving picture robustness will be uncovered, then also the mystery behind OPP and NPP will vanish.\nGetting back to Mona Lisa, is her portrait robust or is it a rare deviation from picture robustness? This, we believe, is to be the really challenging question."

            "text": "Mona Lisa has and will continue to cause much ink to flow. We certainly have not unraveled the enigma behind her expression, nor do we think this to be entirely possible, or even necessary. It\nis clear, though, that her eyes play a big part in our fascination, whether we are aware of this or not. We are not certain whether her smile is uncatchable, as suggested by others (Livingstone, 2000; Soranzo and Newberry, 2015), but we are certain that her gaze is even more ambiguous than her smile, and that it might be truly considered uncatchable, unless looked from afar. In this sense, Da Vinci\u2019s painting defies the typical robustness of pictorial images without being a scenographic trompe l\u2019oeil: even most of those who do not see her looking at them when viewing a big, decent reproduction of the painting, will have the impression of her gaze following them when the retinal image is relatively small, as when visiting the Louvre or looking at a reproduction in a journal. When instead the image is big enough, people will divide spontaneously into two groups, those who see her staring at them, and those who see her looking aside.\nThe short passage that entitles our conclusive paragraph is taken from the description of the portrait of Mona Lisa written by Giorgio Vasari; the passage concludes: . . .che era cosa pi\u00f9 divina che umana a vederlo, et era tenuta cosa maravigliosa,\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\nper non essere il vivo altriment i (Vasari, 1991). The whole passage has been translated into English as such: \u2018\u2018And in this work of Leonardo\u2019s there was a smile so pleasing, that it was a thing more divine than human to behold; and it was held to be something marvellous, since the reality was not more alive\u2019\u2019 (Vasari, 1914).\nWhen describing the painting, Vasari mentions eyebrows and \u2018\u2018lustri\u2019\u2019 (lights) in the eyes, which, however, are both absent in the painting. Some say due to excessive cleaning, however, without providing proof. Vasari never really saw the original painting, which most likely was sold after Salai\u2019s death (Gian Giacomo Caprotti, 1480\u20131524, one of Leonardo\u2019s favorite apprentices) to Francis I, along with other paintings by Leonardo. Hence, Vasari\u2019s description is second hand, probably based on descriptions by others and/or copies of the painting (drawings, etchings) that might have been circulating, maybe created by Salai himself or another of Leonardo\u2019s apprentices; after all, that is how ideas circulated in the artworld of the time (Danto, 1964)1. What is remarkable about Vasari\u2019s description is that word of the effect of Mona Lisa\u2019s expression was already circulating, as testified by Vasari\u2019s use of the terms ghigno tanto piacevole to\n1Artworld is a concept developed by Arthur Danto (20) to explain contemporary aesthetics. The concept, however, with some re-interpretation, can be employed and extended to talk about the production and appreciation of art also in times that are far from our own.\ndescribe Mona Lisa\u2019s facial expression. The word ghigno does not simply refer to a smile, rather it refers to a complex facial expression and it has always retained a negative meaning, best translated from Italian with \u2018\u2018malevolent smile\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018sneer\u2019\u2019. Hence, the official English translation does not do justice to Vasari\u2019s linguistic skills, it does not render the sense of his oxymoron. By accosting the adjective \u2018\u2018pleasant\u2019\u2019 to sneer, Vasari transformed Mona Lisa\u2019s smile into an enigma, best translated not simply with a \u2018\u2018pleasant smile\u2019\u2019, as reported by the English translation, but with a \u2018\u2018rather playful smile\u2019\u2019.\nWhy did Leonardo never depart from his painting? Why didn\u2019t he sell it to Francesco del Giocondo, Mona Lisa\u2019s husband who commissioned the painting (hence the Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda)? Of course, we do not have an answer to such questions, and we do not know if the painting is a portrait of Monna Lisa, Francesco del Giocondo\u2019s wife. What we propose from here on is mostly an academic exercise, that, however, might hold a pinch of truth. If not, it is still a rather entertaining hypothesis.\nThe hypothesis that La Gioconda was dear to Leonardo because he realized that he had achieved one of the goals that he set in one of his many annotations, which would become known as Trattato della pittura, probably put together by Francesco Melzi (1491\u20131568), another of Leonardo\u2019s apprentices who inherited many of his manuscripts and drawings. A goal that an artist should set, according to the Trattato, is to represent\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 11 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 878288\naccidenti mentali and moti mentali, the first to be intended as emotions and affective states, the second as thoughts and motivations. For example, in the annotation 372 entitled Che se le figure non esprimono la mente sono due volte morte (Da Vinci, 1804), Leonardo writes: Se le figure non fanno atti pronti i quali colle membra esprimano il concetto della mente loro, esse figure sono due volte morte, perch\u00e9 morte sono principalmente ch\u00e9 la pittura in s\u00e9 non \u00e8 viva, ma esprimitrice di cose vive senza vita, e se non la si aggiunge la vivacit\u00e0 dell\u2019atto, essa rimane morta la seconda volta (Leonardo, 1804, p. 192; \u2018\u2018How figures not expressive of the mind are twice dead. If figures do not make lifelike gestures with their limbs which express what is passing through their minds, these figures are twice dead\u2019\u2019. Pedretti, 1964, p. 46).\nPortraits do not normally portray actions, and in particular, Mona Lisa\u2019s posture is rather statuesque, showing the final stages of Leonardo\u2019s artistic interests, with the torso blocked in a half twist (Marani, 1994). However, out of will, or by chance, Leonardo infused in Mona Lisa\u2019s facial expression \u2018\u2018motion\u2019\u2019. Not the motion that characterizes facial expressions such as anger, fear, joy, or sadness, which can induce an implicit sense of dynamism to the figure represented (Actis-Grosso and Zavagno, 2015; Della Torre et al., 2021), but something much more subtle, elusive, like someone whose gaze is lost in the void while looking in the direction of another person. Is she looking at me? Leonardo managed to depict an actual moto mentale, the act of thinking that often characterizes such stares. As an acute observer of all the phenomena he encountered, Leonardo must have realized right away that the impressions generated by the portrait went far beyond different interpretations of Mona Lisa\u2019s facial expressions by different observers; he might have also noticed that different distances of observation of the painting changed one\u2019s own interpretation of her gaze/expression, resulting in an image that appeared alive. The final words by Vasari, et era tenuta cosa maravigliosa, per non essere il vivo altrimenti, describe exactly this.\nThe moto mentale he managed to portray through Mona Lisa may be the reason why he did not insert \u2018\u2018highlights\u2019\u2019 in the eyes, which would have fixed forever Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze in one direction, as shown in a work in preparation in which highlights were placed in Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes in different positions (Succi, Avanzi, and Zavagno, in preparation). This may also be the reason why the eyebrows are missing, as they also would have contributed to fixing her facial expression. Both highlights and eyebrows are instead visible\nin an interesting copy of Mona Lisa that can been seen in the Prado Museum, datable between 1503\u20131519 and painted by one of Leonardo\u2019s apprentices. Maybe La Gioconda had become a portable experiment for Leonardo, with which he could amuse those who visited him, while studying their reactions.\nAs said previously, ours is only academic speculation. What matters for a psychology of art is that regardless of the actual direction of Mona Lisa\u2019s gaze, this is modulated by distance and all kinds of people, not only scientists, either feel her gaze upon or beyond them, all remaining blissfully puzzled by her playfully enigmatic expression. Could this be the effect that Leonardo was looking for? We do not have an answer to such a question. But we can say one thing: in some sense, the painting La Gioconda is more ambiguous than robust, maybe because Leonardo depicted an affective trompe l\u2019oeil."
