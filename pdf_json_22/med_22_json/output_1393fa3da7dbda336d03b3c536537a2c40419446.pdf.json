An underestimation can be caused by several factors, among those - proton conductivity via a large-amplitude motion of protons (O\u2013H tumbling and the shortrange diffusion) that occurs along OH\u2013 chains. The P\u2013H distance deduced for AMP, i.e. the compound with HPO42\u2013 as the dominant structure, is fairly well matching to the crystallographic data. This means that the CP MAS kinetics is a capable technique getting a complementary information on the proton localization in H-bond and the proton transfer in the cases, where traditional structure determination methods fail."

            "text": "\u201cOur populations are aging. Some experts predict that 30% of hospital beds will soon be occupied by osteoporosis patients\u201d \u2013 this sentence was brought out beginning the review article by Bohner et all.1 The bone tissue consists of about 70% of calcium phosphates (CaPs) that makes CaPs materials of choice for potential treating of bone diseases by repairing damaged bone tissues. Hydroxyapatites (HA) are thermodynamically the most stable form of CaPs, and therefore they are very attractive objects for investigation as from the physical point as well as for applications. The most important applications are: preparation of biocompatible materials such as artificial bones and teeth catalysis, pharmaceutics, fertilizers, protein chromatography etc.2-4 Each particular application depends on HA structure, crystallinity, particles size, and morphology. This causes the growing interest to HA synthesis. Several synthesis routes, such as wet precipitations, sol-gel, reverse micelle templates, hydrothermal method, etc. have been developed and used.4-6\nCalcium hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, CaHA) represents a privileged member for the applications due to its close resemblance to the mineral of hard tissues (bone, enamel, dentin, etc.) resulting in high biocompatibility.2-4 The interest to CaHA arises from the physical point of view because it belongs to the class of low-dimensional proton-conducting materials possessing a largeamplitude motional freedom of protons along OH\u2013 chains.7,8 An interplay between the surface and bulk effects results in other interesting features of the nano-structured CaHA (nano-CaHA).9 Nevertheless, the dynamic features and structural manifolds in CaHA are still not well understood.\nThe solid-state NMR is a proper tool for the studies of these problems. There was published a plenty of works on CaPs performed using NMR spectroscopy. The 1H and 31P chemical shifts were analyzed at the visual resolution or decomposing the complex signal shapes.9-14 However, in many cases the peaks were assigned rather intuitively, without any adequate support from quantum\nchemistry side. It has to be noted the work on octacalcium phosphate.15 The high-level DFT calculations of 31P magnetic shielding tensors were performed for the unit cell that consists of hydrated and apatitic layers. The 31P chemical shifts were rigorously assigned basing on the calculation results.15\nAnother widely used NMR technique is the cross-polarization (CP), often combined with magicangle spinning (MAS).15-18 Typically, CP is used to enhance signals of less abundant spins (S) by using magnetization of abundant ones (I) with larger gyromagnetic ratio. CP is also feasible between abundant nuclei. Despite the signal enhancement in such case is ineffective, the CP technique between abundant nuclei is very useful extracting the unique information on the structure and dynamics of complex materials through the time (contact time) evolution of communication between the subsystems of interacting spins.19 As CP is promoted by the dipolar I\u2013S interactions that are intrinsically sensitive to internuclear distances, it plays a major role for probing short-range ordering and local dynamics.20,21 This technique can reveal fine aspects of structural organization at the atomic level in soft and complex solids, where other traditional methods work unsatisfactorily.22-24\nTraditionally, in the presence of strong heteronuclear dipolar coupling, the CP kinetics is described by the so-called I\u2013I*\u2013S model combining a coherent term of the isolated I*\u2013S spin pair and an incoherent term related to interactions with other protons in a thermal spin-bath in a phenomenological way.18,19,22 However, in the works on CaHA only the classical I\u2013S and isotropic I\u2013I*\u2013S models were used.10,11,23-26 There are no works, where the angular averaging of spin coupling, that is necessary for powder samples, was carried out.\nIn the present work, the series of the samples containing amorphous phosphate phase (AMP), composite of AMP + nano-structured calcium hydroxyapatite (nano-CaHA) and high-crystalline\nnano-CaHA was synthesized and studied applying solid-state NMR techniques (1H and 31P NMR spectra as well as CP MAS kinetics). The comparative study monitoring the changes in NMR spectra along this series allows deeper to understand the stages of nano-structuring. The DFT calculations of the 1H and 31P magnetic shielding tensors of crystalline CaHA were performed for theoretical support to the peak assignments and for some supplementary insights into the experimental observations.\nThe earlier studies on CaHA have revealed that the nano-CaHA is a slowly relaxing spin system.23,24 This makes the nano-CaHA very suitable for the testing of various microscopic quantum models of spin dynamics without taking into account the spin-lattice relaxation effects. A broad set of spin dynamics models (isotropic/anisotropic, relaxing/non-relaxing, secular/seminon-secular) were applied and fitted to the experimental CP MAS data."

Three different synthesis routes have been used that produced the samples containing amorphous phosphate phase (AMP), composite of AMP + nano-structured calcium hydroxyapatite (AMP+nano-CaHA) and high-crystalline nano-CaHA, respectively.

In order to remove the adsorbed water from nano-CaHA, the sample was vacuum-dried at 373 K for four days.\nThe characterization of the samples. The synthesis products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) using a Helios NanoLab 650 scanning electron microscope coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry system. SEM micrographs of CaHA samples prepared by Synthesis I - III are shown in Fig. 1.\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected in the range of 10 \u2264 2q \u2264 60\u00b0 using Ni-filtered CuK\u03b1 radiation on Rigaku MiniFlex II diffractometer working in Bragg-Brentano (q/2q) geometry. The\nXRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 2. As it is seen, the XRD diffraction patterns contain diffraction lines attributable to calcium hydroxyapatite. The obtained results are in a good agreement with the reference data for Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (PDF [72\u20131243]).\nNMR measurements. The solid-state NMR experiments were performed using 600 MHz Bruker AVANCE NEO NMR spectrometer equipped with 2.5 mm Bruker TriGamma triple resonance MAS probe. The experiments were performed in 14.095 T magnetic field using Ascend 54 mm standard-bore superconducting magnet. The resonance frequencies of 1H and 31P nuclei were 600.3 MHz and 243.0 MHz, respectively. The 1H\u219231P CP MAS experiments were performed for the spinning sample at 5, 10, 20 and 30 kHz at the n = + 1 and + 2 Hartmann-Hahn (HH) matching condition. The CP contact was achieved with rectangular 71 kHz RF pulses for 31P and properly varying it for 1H (Fig. 3). The sample temperature was set to 298 K and controlled by Bruker BCU II temperature regulation system. The 1H and 31P chemical shifts were referenced to external standards of tetra-methylsilane (TMS) and 85% H3PO4 aqueous solution, using adamantane (\u03b4(1H) = 1.85 ppm) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (\u03b4(31P) = 0.8 ppm), respectively. Spectra\nconsisted of 7142 real data points and were registered using single scan, the repetition delay was set to 125 s which is equal to 5\u00b7 T1 (1H). The CP MAS kinetics were registered by varying the contact times from 50 \u00b5s to 10 ms in increments of 10 \u00b5s. Processing of CP MAS kinetics was\ncarried out using the Microcal Origin and MathCad packages."

The atomic coordinates used in the calculation are given in ESI. In the two models, OH\u2013 groups face up or down as seen in Figs 4a and 4b, respectively. The net charge of the calcium cations and phosphate anions is zero in both models, thus the total charge of the entire system of -6 is determined solely by the number of hydroxyl groups.\nThe NMR isotropic shielding constants have been computed using the PBE0 exchange correlation functional.28 The two central OH\u2013 groups as highlighted in Fig. 4 have been described by the 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis sets, while the smaller 6-31G* basis set was employed for the rest of the system.

There is assumed\nthat only one spin I* interacts with the I-spin bath (or infinite energy reservoir of I spins), which is described in a phenomenological way.\nThe spin dynamics is described by the time evolution of the reduced density operator \ud835\udf48 \ud835\udc61\nsolving the generalized Liouville-von Neumann differential equation\n% %& \ud835\udf48 \ud835\udc61 = \u2212\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc6f+, \ud835\udf48 \ud835\udc61 \u2212 G \ud835\udf48 \ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udf48 \u221e , (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc6f+ is the system Hamiltonian, and G is the spin-diffusion superoperator.18,22,32 For a fast fluctuating I-spin bath, the spin diffusion superoperator can be written as32\nG \ud835\udf48 = \ud835\udc45%/0 \ud835\udc702 , \ud835\udc702, \ud835\udf48 + \ud835\udc45%40 \ud835\udc705 , \ud835\udc705, \ud835\udf48 + \ud835\udc706 , \ud835\udc706, \ud835\udf48 + \ud835\udc45%4+ \ud835\udc7a5 , \ud835\udc7a5, \ud835\udf48 +\n\ud835\udc7a6 , \ud835\udc7a6, \ud835\udf48 , (2)\nwhere RIdp and RIdf are the (homonuclear) spin-diffusion rate constants of the I\u2217 spin and RSdf is that of the S spin (heteronuclear). The rate constants RIdf and RSdf are associated with the flip-flop terms of the homonuclear (I\u2013I\u2217) and heteronuclear (I\u2013S) dipolar Hamiltonians, respectively, and allow the complete thermal equilibration with the bath, whereas RIdp acts on the damping of the coherence driving the system to the internal quasi-equilibrium.32\nThe solution of the general non-secular equation is rather cumbersome to implement. A series of the simple analytical solutions were derived in the secular approximation, i.e., under the conditions : i) the applied RF fields are much stronger than I*\u2013S coupling (\u03c91I, \u03c91S >> |b|); ii) the I*\u2013S coupling constant is much larger than the spin diffusion rate constants (|b| >> RIdf, RIdp). In ref\n32 it was shown that the generalized Liouville-von Neumann equation has a semi-non-secular analytical solution under a softer condition |b| >> |RIdf \u2013 RSdf|.

(4)\nNote, in the case of the isotropic spin-diffusion (RIdf = RIdp = R) the Eq. (3) converts to the well-\nknown expression derived in the work of M\u00fcller et al.31\nAs the dipolar splitting b is an 'angular' function, the proper angular averaging has to be performed in order to adapt this equation to powder samples.33,34 The angular averaging (AA) for CP MAS experiments is carried out as\ncos \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc61 MM = > ? cos \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc61 sin \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc51\ud835\udefdQ< .

The angular averaging was carried out numerically in all cases.\nThe anisotropic relaxing model (Naito and McDowell,35 corrected by Hirschinger and Raya,36 further \u2013 cNMD). The secular non-relaxing model (Eq. (3)) was extended by Naito and McDowell, taking into account the rates of spin-lattice relaxation processes in the rotating frame (\ud835\udc45I1r = 1/TI1r, \ud835\udc45S1r = 1/TS1r). The original Naito-McDowell equation35 is for convenience rewritten in the notations of Eq. (2), replacing RI + RS \u00ae RSdf, \ud835\udc45S1r = \ud835\udc45I1r + \ud835\udc45S1r and RZI \u00ae RIdp as\n\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3c< > ? \u2212\nBCD S\nBCD S EBefS\neA BCD S EBefS & +\nBCD S\nBCD S EBefS\neABef G & \u2212\n> ? eA\ne [ BCF G E?BCD S ABefS EBefG &cos \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc61 . (7)\nAs expected, Eq. (7) converts into Eq. (3) in the case of very slow spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame (1/TI1r \u00ae 0, 1/TS1r \u00ae 0). However, we have recently shown that the solution\noriginally derived by Naito and McDowell (Eq. (7)) is incorrect in the presence of T1r relaxation.36 The correct NMD (cNMD) solution with the angular averaging procedure is written36\n\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3c< > ? \u2212\nBCD S\nBCD S EBefS /?ABefG /?\neA BCD S EBefS /? & +\nBCD S\nBCD S EBefS /?ABefG /?\neABef G & \u2212\n> ? eA BCD S EBCF G /?EBefS /P & cos \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc61 MM .

(8)) not only exhibits the expected decaying rate (\ud835\udc45S1r/2) in the limiting case of an Ising system\u2013environment interaction (\ud835\udc45Sdf = 0),22 but also shows a reduced damping rate (\ud835\udc45S1r/4) for the coherent term.\nSecular anisotropic model for spin clusters I*N\u2013S (Kolodziejski and Klinowski,19 further \u2013 SEC-C). Both above models (Eqs (3) and (8)) consider a I*\u2013S spin pair. It was be modified for the spin clusters I*N\u2013S introducing the parameter l that is related to the cluster size N.19 In the case of very long relaxation TS1r \u00ae \u00a5 (note, this is indeed true for nano-CaHA), it is written as\n\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3c<\ud835\udc52A&/hef G 1 \u2212 leABCD S & \u2212 1 \u2212 l eA BCD S EBCF G /? & cos \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc61 MM . (9)\nAs l depends on the group mobility it must be adjusted by the fitting of experimental and calculated curves. Its value optimized for a I*2\u2013S spin system is ~ 0.25 - 0.33.19,37 In the limit RIdp >> RIdf (highly anisotropic case), it is possible to distinguish two regimes: one in which the I*N\u2013S spin system decoheres and reaches a quasi-equilibrium state characterized by RIdp and the other in which polarization transfer from the bath is completed with a rate RSdf. The parameter l then\naccounts for the fact that the quasi-equilibrium state polarization does not coincide with the time averaged value in an isolated IN\u2013S spin system.18 This model (with some modifications, however, without AA) was most often used in the CP MAS studies of HAs and related systems.10,23-26 The isotropic spin-diffusion approach (RIdf = RIdp = R = 1/Tdf, Tdf is the proton spin-diffusion time constant) was set in all those cases.\nSemi-non-secular model (Hirschinger and Raya,32 further \u2013 SNS):\n\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3c< 1 \u2212 > ? eABCD S & 1 + eA e [BCF G & cosh \ud835\udf11\ud835\udc61 + BCF G ?k sinh \ud835\udf11\ud835\udc61 MM , (10)\nwhere \ud835\udf11 = \ud835\udc45%/0 /2 ? \u2212 \ud835\udc4f?. It is easy to notice that the transient oscillations of CP intensity will\nappear when j becomes imaginary, i.e. b2 > (RIdp/2)2. If (RIdp/2)2 > b2, oscillations convert to an overdamped regime. This approach in preferable if the physical legitimacy to use the Eqs (3), (8) and (9) for describing weakly interacting spins (b \u00bb RIdp) is in a certain doubt."

            "text": "The signal shape analysis of 1H and 31P NMR spectra. This procedure is the most suitable for the monitoring of structural changes in the studied series going from AMP to nano-CaHA. The shapes of 1H and 31P NMR signals were analyzed in many works on CaHAs on various levels.9-14 Perhaps the most detailed consideration is given in ref 9. There was pictured a complete visual \u2018map\u2019 of structural manifolds. However, for the sake of clarity, the spectral components of the complex NMR shapes were represented only schematically, avoiding the question to resolve them possessing real experimental data arrays. In other words, the chances to deduce the true number of\noverlapping peaks and their parameters (positions, widths, intensities) on the statistically reasoned level were not discussed.\nIn the present work a precise 1H and 31P NMR signal contours analysis was carried out\napproaching the shapes of \u2018elementary\u2019 bands by Voigt functions. The non-linear multiple peak fitting was performed gradually increasing the number of the overlapping bands and keeping a check on the statistical parameters (the correlation coefficient R2 and the sum of weighted squares of deviations c2) as well as on the errors of the optimized parameters. The procedure used to stop when no improvement in R2 and c2 was noticed and the standard errors started to diverge.\nHence, in the present work the positions, widths and relative intensities of the separated\nspectral components were determined and presented in a realistic manner (Fig. 5). The fitting results depend on the perfection of the real experiment caused by instrumental settings, stability, signal-to-noise ratio, etc. Therefore, it is not surprising that not all peaks predicted in ref 9 were resolved. The attribution of some 31P NMR peaks used in ref 9 was slightly revised on the ground of DFT calculation results taken from ref 15. There was carried out a very thorough high-level calculation of 31P chemical shifts of octacalcium phosphate (OCP). As AMP contains significant amount of structural water (Fig. 5), it should be satisfactorily mimicking by the hydrated layer of OCP, whereas the apatitic layer is similar to nano-CaHA. The calculated 31P chemical shifts decrease as d(PO43\u2013surf) > d(PO43\u2013bulk) > d(HPO42\u2013). The same tendency follows from the DFT calculations carried out in the present using the truncated model (Fig. 4). The 31P isotropic shielding constant averaged over the phosphorous atoms in the internal circle, denoted in Fig. 4 as the bulk, appeared to be by ~ 7 ppm larger than that in the external one, i.e. on the surface (382 ppm and 375 ppm, respectively). As the chemical shifts are obtained by subtracting the computed isotropic shielding constants from the corresponding reference shielding constants this means that\nd(PO43\u2013surf) > d(PO43\u2013bulk). The simple in vacuo calculation of the isotropic 31P shielding constants of PO43\u2013 and HPO42\u2013 moieties indicates that d(PO43\u2013) should be ca 11 ppm higher than d(HPO42\u2013) (see ESI). Therefore, the above rules for the chemical shifts were adopted assigning the resolved 31P NMR peaks in the present work (Fig. 5).\nAs the integrated intensities of NMR signals are proportional to the numbers of corresponding nucleus, some quantitative evaluations of the structural contents can be done. The 1H NMR signal at 5.5 ppm is clearly dominant in AMP (84%, Fig. 5). It is assigned to the structural water in the H-bond networks (H2O\u2026H2O\u2026)i with the aggregation number i \u2265 4, i.e. water tetramers and higher.38,39 The AMP sample is the most hydrated one in the studied series. Comparing the percentage of the integral intensities of P\u2013O\u2013H and HPO42\u2013 peaks (Fig. 5) 0.15 NH = 0.67 NP, it follows NH/NP = 4.5 (within \u00b1 10 % uncertainty). Then, the structure of AMP in the stoichiometric form is written as Ca3(PO4)2\u00d7(4.5 \u00b1 0.5) H2O.\nRepeating this routine for P\u2013O\u20131H and H31PO42\u2013 peaks in AMP + nano-CaHA sample, it follows that the hydration of AMP, being as one of the components of the composite, is strongly reduced\nto NP/NH = 1.1 \u00b1 0.1. A lower content of water in the composite sample can be due to the different synthesis route. However, it can be supposed that a significant amount of H2O molecules moves to the sites on the crystallite surfaces of nano-CaHA. The drastic increase of intensities of the 1H NMR peaks at 1.0 and 1.4 ppm (from less than 1% in AMP to 5% + 2% in the composite), i.e. the peaks attributed to water on the surfaces,9,10,13 confirms this idea. Some amount of water molecules can occupy the isolated vacancies in OH\u2013 chains.14\nRoughly supposing that the HPO42\u2013 may appear only as the defects to ideal CaHA structure,9 the presence of these groups in nano-CaHA could be neglected. This indeed is supported by the 31P\nNMR shape analysis. The single symmetrical peak centered at ~ 2.6 ppm was observed in nanoCaHA (Fig. 5). The peaks at this position are usually attributed to the PO43\u2013 groups in the bulk.9,10,12,13 Hence, there are no indications of the presence of the structural unit different from PO43\u2013. Such approach provides the possibility to characterize the phase purity of the composite by\nproperly defined phase composition indices. Possessing 1H and 31P NMR spectra and using integrated signal intensities, it can be done comparing the number of phosphorus atoms in coexisting phases. The integrals of OH\u2013 and HPO42\u2013 peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum are almost equal (within \u00b1 10 % uncertainty). As it is supposed that all protons in the nano-CaHA belong to the OH\u2013 chains, the stoichiometric ratio NP/NH for Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 is 3. The phase composition index can be defined via the atom numbers as PC = (NP/NH)CaHA/((NP/NH)CaHA+ (NP/NH)AMP). Hence, for the composite sample studied in the present work PC = 0.75.\nOnly two OH\u2013 peaks centered at 0.13 ppm and \u2013 0.08 ppm were resolved in the spectrum of the composite AMP + nano-CaHA (6% + 6%, Fig. 5). It was not succeeded to resolve three peaks as it was predicted in ref 9 and arbitrary assigned to \u00b4up\u00b4 and \u00b4down\u00b4 orientations of the hydroxyl groups in the OH\u2013 columns and OH\u2013 protons on the surfaces, respectively. However, it was succeeded in the nano-CaHA sample \u2013 three peaks in the approximate intensity ratio of 2:3:2 were resolved as in the \u2018wet\u2019 as well as in \u2018dry\u2019 samples (Fig. 5). This ratio was negligibly changing upon drying. It can be concluded that the drying of nano-CaHA removes only the H2O molecules in the H-bond networks whereas its action on the structural water on the crystallite surfaces and on the OH\u2013 chains is very weak. The DFT calculations show that the difference of the 1H NMR isotropic shielding constants of the two central hydroxyl groups between the \u00b4up\u00b4 and \u00b4down\u00b4 structural configurations as shown in Fig. 4 is around 0.06 - 0.12 ppm. Having in mind the limitations of the truncated computational model applied in the present work, we find this result to lend reasonable support to the interpretation of experimentally observed difference of around 0.2 ppm of the two resolved peaks centered at around 0 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 5 to originate from the \u00b4up\u00b4 and \u00b4down\u00b4 configurations of the hydroxyl moieties.\nThe origin of the low-intensity peak at ~ 2.2 ppm in 1H NMR spectrum of nano-CaHA is not clear. The change of its intensity under drying correlates with that of the structural water in Hbond network at ~ 5.5 ppm (Fig. 5). Probably, this peak belongs also to the H-bonded water, however, to the shorter aggregates (dimers or trimers)37,38 captured in the vacancies of OH\u2013 channels14 or defects and cavities.\nSpin dynamics. The 1H \u2013 31P CP MAS kinetic experiments on AMP, the composite AMP + nano-CaHA and nano-CaHA were carried out at 20 kHz MAS and HH matching n = + 1 (Fig. 6). In order to check the data reproducibility, two independent experiments were performed with AMP (run 1 and 2, Table 1). It is known that in AMP the processes of spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame occur in the time scale of ~ 10\u20132 s.23,24 Therefore, the relaxing cNMD model (Eq.\n(8)) has be applied to describe the spin dynamics in AMP and for the amorphous component in composite AMP + nano-CaHA.\nThe non-linear curve fitting was carried out for all used models (Eqs (3), (8) - (10)) applying the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm implemented in the Microcal Origin and MathCad packages. The quality of the fitting is demonstrated on the kinetic curves measured at 20 kHz MAS and HH matching for n = +1 (Fig. 6). The values of fitted parameters for all studied kinetics with statistical criterions are presented in Table 1.\nSEC-C, l = 0.23 90 1790 \u00a5 \u00a5 920 1240 0.990/2.0 SNS 2 2190 \u00a5 \u00a5 1480 1620 0.985/3.1 20 kHz MAS, n = + 1 SEC 23 2250 \u00a5 \u00a5 810 1190 0.991/1.7 SEC-C, l = 0.22 260 1340 \u00a5 \u00a5 960 1210 0.995/1.3 SNS 7 2450 \u00a5 \u00a5 1340 1460 0.993/1.9\n*- concerning this artifact, see comment in text; **- all b and DIS values for nano-CaHA, which belongs to I2\u2013S spin system, are rescaled by 2, see explanation in text.\nTo our knowledge, in all works on CaHA and related systems, simplifying the CP MAS kinetics models, the approach TI1r << TS1r, TS1r \u00ae \u00a5 was used. In the present work the cNMD model was applied, which includes the complete scheme of the rotating frame spin-lattice relaxation pathways. It was deduced that the processes of spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame in AMP occur in the same time scale of tens of milliseconds as for 1H (= I) as well as for 31P (= S) spins. However, a certain doubt arises concerning this result. Indeed, the determined relaxation rate of the S spin is much lower than the spin diffusion rate RSdf, so that the precision of TS1r must be very bad since only the sum of RSdf and 1/TS1r appears in Eq. (8). This is not the case for the relaxation time of protons TI1r, because it solely drives the decay of the magnetization through the second exponential term of Eq. (8). The slowdown of the relaxation of 31P spins (TS1r \u00ae \u00a5) is seen in the composite sample and nano-CaHA (Table 1). Such behavior of spin-lattice relaxation times in the rotating frame (TI1r and TS1r) is very similar to that observed in some polymers40 \u2013 the higher content of structured water (Fig. 5), i.e. the larger proton bath, the faster relaxation (Table 1).\nAs it follows from the above signal shape analysis, the dominant structural unit in AMP is HPO42\u2013 (67 %, Fig. 5). The spin system can be considered as a single S\u2013I* spin pair (31P\u2013O\u20131H) characterized by the heteronuclear dipolar coupling constant DIS = 3350 \u00b1 50 Hz. The cNMD model is valid for arbitrary values of the spin-diffusion and the relaxation rates as long as these rates are much lower than the S\u2013I* dipolar coupling constant. The b value (in s\u20131) ~ 2pDIS fulfills this condition. Hence, the use of cNMD model is legitimated. The close values of RIdp and RSdf deduced for AMP (RIdp/RSdf ~ 2, Table 1) show the spin-diffusion in this system is close to isotropic. Note, the value RIdp ~ 8000 s\u20131 deduced for amorphous component in the composite sample seems to be a computational artifact - despite a good general fit, it was not succeeded to\nreproduce the first 'shake' of I(t) at ~ 0.5 ms (green points and green line, Fig. 6b). This was because\nof low peak intensity (12 % of total, Fig. 5) and high noise level.\nThe heteronuclear dipolar coupling constant deduced for AMP corresponds to the P\u2013H distance 2.44 \u00b1 0.01 \u00c5. This is a reasonable value for HPO42\u2013, knowing from crystallography7,8,27 that the P\u2013O and O\u2013H distances in CaHA are 1.4 - 1.6 \u00c5 and ~ 0.94 \u00c5, respectively. Hence, the experimental CP MAS kinetics and the applied spin-diffusion model correctly reproduce the P\u2013H distance.\nAs distinct from AMP, the CP MAS kinetics in nano-CaHA measured at 5 kHz MAS rate pointed towards an extremely high anisotropy of spin-diffusion process in this system.41 It even looks that the Ising-type interaction (RIdf = RSdf = 0) should be dominant. However, from the practice, the CP MAS experiments with HH sideband matching are rather sensitive to radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity.21,42-44 This impedes the interpretation of the spin diffusion rates or even leads to unreliable values. The extent of possible errors can be evaluated varying RF power, MAS rate and carefully matching the HH conditions. Therefore, in the present work the CP kinetics in nano-\nCaHA have been studied (Fig. 7a) precisely matching HH conditions n = \u00b1 1, \u00b1 2 and varying the RF power within 76 - 131 kHz and the MAS rate from 5 to 30 kHz (Fig. 3). Note, some points on the kinetic curve measured at 30 kHz MAS were significantly dropped out. This could be due to the problem of the long-term spinning stability as this MAS rate was close to the technical limit of the probe. Therefore, despite the Fourier transform over the CP kinetics at 30 kHz provides rather conscious value of dipolar splitting (Fig. 7b), this curve was excluded from the further treatment. It is gratifying to see (Fig. 7b) that the experimental b values for n = +1 and n = +2 HH matching\ndiffer by the factor of 2, as it has to follow from the bn definitions (Eq. (6)).\nAs nano-CaHA is a slowly relaxing spin system, i.e. TI1r, TS1r \u00ae \u00a5,23,24 the experimental curves (Fig. 7a) were fitted using non-relaxing SEC (Eq. (3)), SEC-C (Eq. (9)) and SNS (Eq. (10)) models, with- and without numerical angular averaging. The determined values of spin-diffusion rates, dipolar splitting and coupling constant are spread over a certain area, depending on the experimental settings (MAS rate and HH conditions) and the model was used (Table 1). The angular averaging effect is clearly seen in the DIS vs. b plot using the b values that follow from the calculations with no AA (Fig. 8a). Depending on model, the AA procedure leads to the rescaling\nDIS \u00bb (1.2 \u00b1 0.1)b.\nIt can be reasonably assumed that the calculations implementing the angular averaging (Eq. (5)) should provide more accurate evaluation of the spin-diffusion rates RIdp and RSdf. For a powder, the destructive interference of the orientation-dependent coherences is expected to contribute significantly to the decay of the transient oscillations. The effect of the angular averaging is clearly seen on the RIdp values (with- and without AA, Fig. 8b), whereas it was not significant on the RSdf values. Extremely low values of RSdf indicate that the Ising-type interaction (RIdf = RSdf = 0) is indeed dominant in the nano-CaHA spin system. The calculations applying SEC-C model, i.e. including the I*N\u2013S clusters, lead to slightly larger values RSdf ~ 102 s\u20131 (Table 1, not shown in Fig. 8b). However, the anisotropy of spin-diffusion persists to be very high (RIdp/\ud835\udc45S\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 >> 1). As the spin-diffusion in AMP is very close to isotropic, it can be supposed that the anisotropy of spindiffusion is tightly coupled with the degree of anisotropy of proton baths. The proton bath in AMP consists of H-bonded water molecules in a bulky three-dimensional network (84 % of total water content), whereas in nano-CaHA it is formed of low-dimensional OH\u2013 chains (77 %, Fig. 5). Alternatively, a slow fluctuation regime of the local fields controlled by the spin dynamics of the bath could explain the anisotropy of spin diffusion in nano-CaHA.45\nThree kinetic models that were applied for nano-CaHA provide comparable values of statistical fit parameters (R2/c2) as well as the strength of dipolar coupling (b, DIS, Table 1). The knowing of the accurate DIS values are important for the determination of 1H\u201331P distances.42 The deduced DIS values are dispersed over the range of ~ 1200 - 1800 Hz (Fig. 8a). According crystallography, 7,8,26 the shortest distance between 1H and 31P spins in CaHA is 3.847 \u00c5 that corresponds to DIS \u00bb 855 Hz. The reasons of such discrepancy has to be discussed in more details.\nThe first point is the secularity. As the secularity condition |b| >> RIdf, RIdp is not rigorously fulfilled, it can be suspected that the overestimation of DIS is due to the illegal use of the secular models (SEC, SEC-C). The use of SNS model, which has much softer condition (|b| >> |RIdf \u2013 RSdf|), is then legitimate. However, the SNS model provides even higher DIS values than the secular ones (Fig. 8a). Actually, the fact that the coupling constant fitted with the SNS solution is higher than the one obtained with the secular solution is expected due to the decrease of the transient oscillation frequency induced by the I\u2013I* Ising term in the SNS model when b becomes comparable to RIdp. Furthermore, we have already noticed that this decrease is overestimated by the I\u2013I*\u2013S model (cf. Fig. 1a of ref 32).\nThe next factor for overestimation may arise because the nano-CaHA should be considered as a multiple-spin system. The crystallography data26 show that there are in the OH\u2013 chains two protons distanced from phosphorus by 3.85 \u00c5. It is known that for multiple-spin systems the effective dipolar coupling beff, which value is determined from the CP oscillation frequency, has to be properly rescaled.17,44 At 20 kHz MAS the SEC and SER-C models with the rescaling by a factor\nof 2 (i. e. considering that interactions other than the first two proton neighbors are neglected and the splitting of a perfect equidistant I2\u2013S CP spectrum at straight I\u2013S\u2013I angle, 180\u00b0 or 0\u00b0) give the DIS value ~ 1200 Hz (Table 1, Fig. 8a). This value is reasonably close to the expected one (855\nHz). However, assuming that the n = \u00b11 HH condition is perfectly matched, the CP spectra\ncalculated for I2\u2013S systems with equal I\u2013S internuclear distances are generally complex and exhibit four intense singularities and steep jumps whose positions largely depend on the angle \ud835\udf12 between the two I\u2013S vectors.44,46,47 It has nevertheless been noticed that the I\u2013S interatomic distance can be\ndirectly obtained from the c-independent sub-splitting of the internal singularities, \ud835\udc46nop = \ud835\udc46\u00b1> = \ud835\udc370+ 2, for angles c ranging from 45\u00b0 to 135\u00b0.44,46,47 This spin-pair-like splitting has been observed for strongly coupled CH2 groups (\ud835\udc370+ \u2248 23 kHz and \ud835\udf12 \u2248 109\u00b0) in Lee-Goldburg CP MAS46 and CP with varying contact time (CPVC) experiments under ultra-fast MAS.48 These characteristic features are not detected experimentally in the case of the weak dipolar couplings (\ud835\udc370+ \u2248 1 kHz) of nano-CaHA (Fig. 7b).\nThe third point is radiofrequency (RF) field mismatch/inhomogeneity. In principle, the CP\nMAS experiment with sideband HH matching is more sensitive to RF inhomogeneities than an experiment with matching at the static HH condition. Indeed, for sideband matching, the modified HH condition can no longer be fulfilled independently of the position of the spins within the sample volume.49,50 RF inhomogeneity effects on HHCP are then expected to be important. However, a number of authors have successfully used CPVC to measure heteronuclear couplings and hence internuclear distances.21,33,42,44,47,48,51 Actually, the practical robustness of CPVC has been attributed to the high spatial selectivity of the sideband HH matching conditions under fast MAS that overcomes complications caused by RF inhomogeneity21,42,47 and to the truncation of the weak heteronuclear dipolar couplings by the much larger interaction of the strongly coupled spin pairs.44 Although RF field inhomogeneity causes distortions and a decrease of the CP transfer efficiency\nthe relevant splitting (\ud835\udc46\u00b1> = \ud835\udc370+ 2) of the Pake-like powder pattern obtained by Fourier transformation of the oscillatory CPVC kinetics is found to be little sensitive to experimental missettings.21,42,47 However, it is noteworthy that this analysis is entirely based upon the simplified angular dependence of the polarization transfer for an isolated spin pair (\ud835\udefe encoding).44 To the best of our knowledge, RF inhomogeneity effects have not been previously considered in the more complicated case of multiple-spin systems such as I2\u2013S and I3 \u2013S groups.42,44,46,47 Indeed, the I2\u2013S CPVC spectrum leads to a \ud835\udefe-encoded powder pattern of splitting \ud835\udc46\u00b1> 2 = \ud835\udc370+ only in the specific case of a straight angle (\ud835\udf12 = 180\u00b0 or 0\u00b0).46\nIn principle, a quantitative analysis of the effects of RF inhomogeneity would necessitate\nthe knowledge of the RF field amplitudes at an arbitrary position within the sample volume. In the absence of such a detailed information and since the CP process in the high-field approximation only depends on the mismatch parameter \u0394 = \ud835\udf14>0 \u2212 \ud835\udf14>+ the main characteristics of the signal\nmay, nevertheless, be examined by assuming a given HH mismatch distribution \ud835\udc43 \u0394 . A convenient choice for \ud835\udc43 \u0394 is the Gaussian distribution defined by\n\ud835\udc43 \u0394 = > wx ?Q exp A {A{ [ ?wx [ , (11)\nwhere \u0394 and \ud835\udf0e{ are, respectively, the mean value and standard deviation of \ud835\udc43 \u0394 . We have previously used this HH mismatch distribution to account for the effect of RF inhomogeneity on CPVC experiments and verified that only the general shape of \ud835\udc43 \u0394 is relevant.21 It must also be pointed out that Eq. (11) gives CPVC lineshape distortions (cf. Fig. 6 of ref 21) that are very similar to the ones obtained by using a realistic model of the RF inhomogeneity profile across the sample space for single-coil probes.42 The simulation of CPVC spectra (and CP kinetics) were performed using FORTRAN programs written by us. All other interactions, except the applied RF fields and\nthe I\u2013S or I2\u2013S heteronuclear dipolar coupling(s), were removed from the system Hamiltonian \ud835\udc6f+. \ud835\udc6f+ is then diagonalized analytically applying zeroth-order average Hamiltonian theory, as described previously.21,44 The influence of the mismatch distribution \ud835\udc43 \u0394 on I\u2013S and I2\u2013S CPVC spectra is reported in Fig. 9. In accordance with previous works,21,42,47 the splitting of the I\u2013S pair pake-like doublet is independent of the width of the RF field distribution and the effect of \ud835\udc43 \u0394 is limited to a slight loss of central intensity and a moderate inhomogeneous line broadening, in addition to the expected decrease in total signal amplitude (Fig. 9a). By contrast, it is readily seen that the CPVC spectra of I2\u2013S three-spin systems with I\u2013S\u2013I angles \ud835\udf12 = 71\u00b0 or 109\u00b0 and \ud835\udf12 = 30\u00b0 or 150\u00b0 are strongly affected by RF field inhomogeneity, the relevant internal singularities being barely visible as soon as \ud835\udf0e{ \ud835\udc370+ is higher than ~1 4 (Fig. 9b,c). This means that the observation of well resolved internal maxima is generally limited to coupling constants for which \ud835\udf0e{ \ud835\udc370+ \u226a\n1, i.e., \ud835\udc370+ 2\ud835\udf0b \u227f 10 kHz.46,48 On the other hand, ccomplications caused by RF inhomogeneity must clearly be taken into account in the case of weakly coupled multiple-spin systems (\ud835\udc370+ 2\u03c0 \u227e 1 kHz). Fortunately, Fig. 9b,c shows that external singularities of splitting close to \ud835\udc370+ become prominent when \ud835\udf0e{ \ud835\udc370+ \u227f 1/4. Furthermore, we have checked that a similar behavior is observed regardless of the angle \ud835\udf12. Assuming that the local spin geometry is a I2\u2013S system with equal I\u2013S interatomic distances, this means that a simplified analysis of the CPVC spectra based on the isolated-like spin-pair approach can be used to get an estimation of the coupling constant \ud835\udc370+ provided that the scaling factor of 2 is taken into account. This is illustrated in Fig. 10, where the\nCPVC kinetics of the I2\u2013S triplet with \ud835\udf0e{ \ud835\udc370+ = 0.42 is compared with that of an isolated I\u2013S pair under perfect homogeneous HH matching. Indeed, the relevant first transient oscillation observed experimentally (Fig. 7a) is well reproduced by the I\u2013S spin-pair calculation with \ud835\udc370+ 44 = \ud835\udc370+ 2. This allows an estimation of the coupling constant DIS assuming the local geometries shown in Fig. 11 (I\u2013S pair for AMP and I2\u2013S triplet for nano-CaHA).\nIt is pronounced in the experimental CP spectra obtained by Fourier transform over the CP\nMAS intensities (Fig. 7b). It should be noted that the determination of DIS is more accurate using higher MAS rates,21,47,48 because MAS averages out the proton homonuclear couplings. Indeed, the curve fitting at the MAS rates of ~ 20 kHz, applying SEC and SEC-C model provide the DIS value that is the closest to the crystallographic one (855 Hz, rP\u2013H = 3.847 \u00c5, Figs 8a and 11). The remaining discrepancy may be attributed to a slight departure from the n = +1 HH matching condition21,42,47 and/or to the fact that only the first two proton neighbors have been explicitely considered (I2\u2013S spin system) in Fig. 9b,c. Moreover, the fact that the transient oscillations of the CP MAS kinetics are strongly damped in multiple-spin systems (Figure 10 for \ud835\udf12 \u2260 0 or 180\u00b0) may be accounted for by an increase of the Ising system-environment interaction rate constant \ud835\udc45%/0 in\nthe corresponding I\u2013S spin-pair calculation. The observed highly anisotropic behavior (\ud835\udc45%/0 \ud835\udc45%4 \u226b 1) could then be attributed to the fact that the actual system size is larger than a I\u2013S spin pair. Indeed, the inadequacy of the I\u2013I*\u2013S model to describe CP experiments in nano-CaHA is supported by several observations. First, all models reported in Section 4 assume that the spin population ratio \ud835\udc410\u2217 \ud835\udc410 is negligible (infinite reservoir of I spins). Whereas the high content of structured water can represent a proton bath in AMP (\ud835\udc410\u2217 \ud835\udc410 = 0.15), this is clearly not the case for nano-CaHA, especially for the \u2018dry\u2019 sample (\ud835\udc410\u2217 \ud835\udc410 = 0.77) (Fig. 5). Second, the SEC and SEC-C model provide a better agreement with the crystallographic data than the SNS model\nalthough the secular approximation breaks down. Third, the fitted values of the parameter l in the SEC-C model (Table 1) indicate the presence of a IN\u2013S spin system with N \u00b3 2.19 Fourth, both RIdp and RSdf are found to be independent of the MAS rate (Table 1 and Fig. 8b) in contradiction with the fact that spin diffusion is expected to slowed down by MAS.\nkHz\n0 0.5 1.51-0.5-1-1.5\n(a)\n1.510.50\nkHz\n-0.5-1-1.5\nkHz\n1.510.50-0.5-1-1.5\n(b) (c)\nFig. 9 Theoretical calculations of CPVC spectra in the case of (a) an isolated I\u2013S spin pair (\ud835\udc370+ = 1188 Hz) and a I2\u2013S three-spin system (\ud835\udc370+ (>) = \ud835\udc370+ (?) = 1188 Hz) with an angle between the two I\u2013 S vectors (b) \ud835\udf12 = 71\u00b0 or 109\u00b0 and (c) \ud835\udf12 = 30\u00b0 or 150\u00b0 for \u0394 = \u00b1 \ud835\udf14U and several values of \ud835\udf0e{ : \ud835\udf0e{ = 0 (black line), \ud835\udf0e{ = 50 Hz (brown line), \ud835\udf0e{ = 0.1 kHz (red line), \ud835\udf0e{ = 0.2 kHz (blue line), \ud835\udf0e{ = 0.3 kHz (green line), \ud835\udf0e{ = 0.4 kHz (purple line), \ud835\udf0e{ = 0.5 kHz (orange line), \ud835\udf0e{ = 1 kHz (grey line). The spectra are plotted on the same amplitude scale so that they can be directly compared.\nFig. 10 Polarization evolution of the S-spin magnetization as a function of the CP contact time for an isolated I\u2013S spin pair under perfect homogeneous HH matching with \u0394 = \u00b1 \ud835\udf14U and \ud835\udc370+ = 1680 Hz (black solid line), \ud835\udc370+ = 1188 Hz (black dotted line) and for a I2\u2013S three-spin system (\ud835\udc370+ (>) = \ud835\udc370+ (?) = 1188 Hz) under imperfect inhomogeneous HH matching (\u0394 = \u00b1 \ud835\udf14U and \ud835\udf0e{ = 0.5 kHz)\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nContact time\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n(ms)\nwith an angle between the two I\u2013S vectors \ud835\udf12 = 90\u00b0 (red line), \ud835\udf12 = 71\u00b0 or 109\u00b0 (blue line), \ud835\udf12 = 30\u00b0 or 150\u00b0 (green line), \ud835\udf12 = 0 or 180\u00b0 (orange line). The CP signal amplitude under perfect homogeneous HH matching (case of the I\u2013S spin pair) have been multiplied by a factor 0.57 for comparison of the time evolution.\nBeside the above factors, the shortening of P\u2013H distance to ca 3.4 \u00c5, deduced directly from Fourier transform over the experimental CP MAS intensities (Fig. 7b) and by the model calculations (Fig. 8a, Table 1), can have an intriguing physical reason \u2013 proton conductivity. The crystalline CaHA is well-known as a proton conductor (see ref 8 and references cited therein). A large-amplitude motion of protons occurs along OH\u2013 chains. It was succeeded to visualized the proton migration pathway through the neutron diffraction experiments.7,8 It consists of the O\u2013H tumbling and the short-range diffusion (Fig. 11). It is very likely that such zigzag motion causes the shortening of the effective P\u2013H distance.\nConclusions\n1. The combined analysis of the solid-state 1H and 31P NMR spectra provides the possibility\nto determine the hydration numbers of the components and the phase composition index.\n2. The anisotropic spin dynamics models with the angular averaging of dipolar coupling were\napplied for amorphous CaP and nano-structured CaHA for the first time. It was deduced that the spin diffusion in AMP is close to isotropic (RIdp/RSdf, \u00bb 2), whereas it is highly anisotropic in nano-CaHA being close to the Ising-type (RIdp/\ud835\udc45S\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 >> 1). This can be caused by the different number of internuclear interactions that must be explicitly considered in\nthe spin system for AMP (I\u2013S spin pair) and nano-CaHA (IN\u2013S spin system with N \u00b3 2).\n3. The spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame in AMP sample occurs in the time scale of\n~ 10\u20132 s as for 1H as well as for 31P spins. This process slowdowns with increasing amount\nof structural water (composite sample) and becomes infinitely slow in nano-CaHA.\n4. The P\u2013H distance in nano-CaHA was found being significantly shorter than its\ncrystallographic value. This can be due to a certain overestimation of DIS values caused by multiple-spin interactions and RF field mismatch/inhomogeneity, or alternatively - due to proton conductivity. In other words \u2013 in the systems with a large-amplitude proton motion the 1H\u201331P CP MAS kinetics provides a certain effective distance between 1H and 31P spins that can be shorter than the crystallographic, i.e. \u2018frozen\u2019, one. 5. The P\u2013H distance deduced for AMP, i.e. the compound with HPO42\u2013 as the dominant\nstructure, is fairly well matching to the crystallographic data. If the formation of HPO42\u2013 is considered as the proton transfer that goes via H-bonding PO43\u2013\u2026H\u2013O\u2013H \u00ae HPO42\u2013 + OH\u2013, the correct P\u2013H distance is very promising result. This would mean that the CP MAS kinetics is a capable technique getting a complementary information on the proton localization in H-bond and the proton transfer in the cases, where traditional structure\ndetermination methods do not work properly, e.g. soft disordered solids or gels, amorphous or nano-structured materials, supramolecular aggregates, etc.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare."
