    "abstractText": "T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) has been recently identified as one of the factors involved in the internalization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human cells, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), neuropilin-1, and others. We hypothesized that specific microRNAs could target TIM-1, with potential implications for the management of patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By combining bioinformatic analyses and functional assays, we identified miR-142 as a specific regulator of TIM-1 transcription. Since TIM-1 has been implicated in the regulation of endothelial function at the level of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its levels have been shown to be associated with stroke and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, we validated miR-142 as a functional modulator of TIM-1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). Taken together, our results indicate that miR-142 targets TIM-1, representing a novel strategy against cerebrovascular disorders, as well as systemic complications of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.",

Specifically, miRNAs are able to recognize and bind the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of certain genes, inhibiting their expression. Therefore, miRNAs are involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes [5\u201314]. We and others have identified several miRNAs involved in the regulation of endothelial function [15\u201320]. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) is a type I cell-surface glycoprotein that includes four main domains: a carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a mucin domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an amino-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain [21]. TIM-1 is expressed on endothelial cells, antigen-presenting cells, neurons and microglial cells, and proximal tubular cells in the kidney (it is also known as Kidney Injury Molecule-1; KIM-1). TIM-1 has been shown to act as a cell receptor or entry factor for a number of viruses, including Hepatitis A (indeed, another of its nomenclatures is Hepatitis A Virus Cellular\nInt. J. Mol.

Intriguingly, emerging investigations have proposed TIM1 as a co-factor for the internalization of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells [35\u201337]. Specifically, TIM-1 has been shown to enhance a recombinant replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus that encodes SARS-CoV-2 spike (rVSV/Spike) infection over a wide range of ACE2 concentrations [38], whereas a mutant of TIM-1 that does not bind to phosphatidylserine was unable to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry [39]. Since TIM-1 has been implicated in the regulation of endothelial function at the level of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), and its levels have been shown to be associated with stroke and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury [21,40], the main aim of this study was to identify and validate miRNAs that specifically target TIM-1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs)."

O e of the key findings of the present\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10242 5 of 11\nwork is the demonstration of the functional role of miR-142 in the regulation of endothelial leakage, which represents a fundamental step in several disorders caused by different viruses, which do not have to necessarily display a definite endotheliotropism [57\u201364]. Moreover, many viral infections, including COVID-19, have been shown to lead to the involvement of different tissues and organs, often culminating in a systemic inflammatory response, in which the endothelium plays key roles [50,65\u201368]. Our results in terms of endothelial permeability are also corroborated by data showing that miR-142 can regulate the expression of Occludin, a tight-junction protein that is functionally involved in viral neuro-invasion [69]. Since TIM-1 has been shown to represent an entry co-factor for a number of viruses causing major diseases in humans [22\u201337,39,70], our findings have a major relevance in terms of public health and should enthuse further dedicated investigations exploiting miR-142 as a biomarker as well as a potential target for novel therapeutic approaches. For instance, in line with these observations, we have previously demonstrated that endothelial miRNAs can be harnessed as reliable biomarkers for cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19 [71]. Notably, the crucial role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathobiology of COVID-19, initially described by our research group [72] has been later confirmed by numerous investigators [72\u201384]. Indeed, endothelial cells have been shown to express the key co-factors involved for the internalization of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells, including angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), cathepsins B and D, TIM-1, neuropilin-1, and others, thereby representing a natural target of SARS-CoV-2 [83,85\u201392]. Furthermore, the systemic inflammatory viral reaction observed in patients affected by COVID-19 has been shown to be linked to endothelial dysfunction [93\u201397], leading to thromboembolic events [98\u2013100], which represent a common feature of COVID-19 cases with a severe outcome [101\u2013103]. Additional potential applications of our discovery include kidney disease, disturbances of iron metabolism, and the modulation of the immune response. Indeed, plasma levels of TIM-1 have been found to be associated with underlying tubulointerstitial and mesangial lesions and progression to kidney failure in two cohort studies of individuals with kidney diseases [104]. Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that TIM-2, the rodent homolog to TIM-1, is a binding partner to H-ferritin [105], a protein initially thought to be solely used for iron storage [106\u2013108], which was later shown to serve as an iron delivery protein, secreted from the endothelial cells within the BBB as a source of iron for the brain [109]. TIM-1 can also mediate the tethering between T cells and endothelial cells in vivo and the rolling of lymphocytes on the vascular endothelium [110]. Our study is not exempt from limitations, including having performed the luciferase assays only in one cell type; nevertheless, we demonstrated that TIM-1 is indeed expressed (and regulated by miR-142) in three different types of endothelial cells, namely, hBMECs, HUVECs, and HMVEC-Ls. Further dedicated experiments are warranted to prove the effects of miR-142 in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular events and on the actions of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses."

To assess the effects of miR-142 on TIM-1 gene transcription, we used a luciferase reporter containing the 3\u2032-UTR of the predicted miRNA interaction site, both wild-type and mutated, in hBMECs cells. The mutant construct of TIM-1 3\u2032-UTR (TIM-1 MUT, as shown in Figure 1), harboring a substitution of three nucleotides within the predicted miR-142 binding sites of TIM-1 3\u2032-UTR was obtained using the NEBaseChanger and Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) as we previously described [111,114,116]. We transfected hBMECs with the 3\u2032-UTR reporter plasmid (0.05 \u00b5g) and miR-142 mimic (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham MA, USA) or miR-142 inhibitor, as well as a non-targeting negative control (scramble), all used at a final concentration of 50 nMol/L, using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific) [111,116]. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection, using Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), normalizing Firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity [20,111,114]. The cellular expression of TIM-1 was determined using RT-qPCR as we previously described [20,114,117,118], normalizing to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The sequences of oligonucleotide primers (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) are reported in Table 1."
