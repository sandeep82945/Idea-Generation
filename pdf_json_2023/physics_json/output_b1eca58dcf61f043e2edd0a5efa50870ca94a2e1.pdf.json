            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nEfficient averaging of isotropic and anisotropic interactions is a prerequisite to achieving high spectral resolution and sensitivity in solid-state NMR. This is typically implemented by simultaneously spinning the sample about the magic angle (MAS) and radio-frequency (RF) irradiation on the non-observed nuclei. The latter allows decoupling abundant nuclei (often 1H) from the dilute, observed nucleus (often 13C or 15N) and is called heteronuclear spin decoupling.1,2 Heteronuclear decoupling works best if either the nutation frequency of the rf field is much larger or much smaller (typically by at least a factor of 3 in both directions) than the MAS frequency. If the two frequencies are in the same range, rotary-resonance recoupling conditions can lead to a recoupling of the heteronuclear dipolar interactions, severely reducing the performance of the heteronuclear decoupling sequences.3\u20135\nImproving the efficiency of spin decoupling is a subject of continued interest in solid-state NMR, especially with the recent developments in instrumentation, e.g., fast spinning frequencies (> 100 kHz)6,7 and high magnetic fields (up to 35.2 T).8\u201310 As a consequence of these instrumental advances, a wide range of new or improved applications has become possible.7,11,12 Heteronuclear decoupling sequences contain a series of pulses modulated by the amplitude, frequency, or phase.1,2,6,7,13\u201319 To avoid resonance conditions, the basic building block is often short but can then be expanded using approaches such as super cycling of the basic block,20 incorporation of refocusing \u03c0-pulses,21 and non-rotor-synchronized22 or rotor-synchronized schemes.23,24\nFor decoupling at high MAS frequencies (\u03bdr \u2273 60 kHz), low-power irradiation is preferred, leading to a reversal of the averaging processes compared with high-power decoupling. Lowpower decoupling was first implemented using continuous-wave\nJ. Chem.

It has a low-duty cycle in the pulsed decoupling regime, and only the pulse lengths require optimization. It was found by numerical simulations, and experimental measurements that the delay between the \u03c0-pulses (n\u03c4r) should be selected based on the spinning frequency to avoid rotary-resonance (R3) recoupling conditions and obtain a sequence that is almost independent of the RF power. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the sequence is very robust against 1H offset at fast spinning frequencies (100 kHz). However, there is not yet a theoretical description of the sequence, which would explain this behavior. Such a theoretical understanding would also allow further optimization to obtain the best decoupling efficiency and propose further improvements.\nHere, we use a generalized theoretical framework based on Floquet theory32 to investigate the robustness of the ROSPAC sequence toward 1H offset and RF field inhomogeneities, as well as the effect of the spacing of the pulses on the decoupling efficiency. Numerical calculations based on analytical solutions were done for three spinning frequencies, 100, 60, and 40 kHz, and three decoupling regimes, low-power, intermediate-power, and high-power decoupling, i.e., at 1H nutation frequencies of 20, 70, and 160 kHz, respectively. The non-resonant second-order effective Hamiltonians that characterize the residual couplings arising from crossterms between heteronuclear dipolar couplings and chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensors and from cross-terms between heteronuclear and homonuclear dipolar couplings under MAS were evaluated. Their scaling factors were obtained from the interaction-frame\ntrajectory. In addition, the magnitude of the first-order resonance conditions was calculated. The optimum decoupling conditions and further improvements are discussed."

In liquid-state NMR, very good offset compensation at\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 154113 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0148400 158, 154113-5\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\nthe lowest possible field is one of the design features of the most commonly used decoupling sequences. In solid-state NMR, highpower decoupling sequences (i.e., \u03c91 > 3\u03c9r) are usually inherently broadband enough since nutation frequency of the rf-field is about an order of magnitude larger than the chemical-shift range for protons. For low-power decoupling (i.e., \u03c91 < 13 \u03c9r), however, the nutation frequency of the decoupling field is significantly smaller than the MAS frequency and is often in the same order of magnitude as the chemical-shift range of protons. Therefore, the chemicalshift offset dependence becomes an important parameter for these sequences.\nFigure 2 shows the logarithm of the magnitude of the scaling factors [log10(q (\u03bd) IS\u2297I) and log10(q (\u03bd) IS\u2297II)] for the second-order cross terms as a function of the RF amplitude (\u03bd1) and 1H offset frequency (\u0394\u03a9), for three MAS frequencies: 100, 60, and 40 kHz. One can observe that the \u03bd = 1 cross term has a slightly higher contribution to the effective Hamiltonian than the \u03bd = 2 cross terms, due to their scaling with \u03c9r and 2\u03c9r, respectively. Moreover, the dipole-dipole cross terms are as expected, zero for on-resonance irradiation, but are increasing in the off-resonant case. One can clearly see that the offset dependence of the second-order cross terms improves with increasing spinning frequency and also increasing rf-field amplitude. However, all of the second-order cross-terms have a relatively small magnitude, independent of the radio frequency power or the 1H offset, and therefore, we expect reasonable decoupling for the whole parameter range.\nThe magnitude of the Fourier coefficients a(k0 ,0)\u03c7 at the resonance conditions n0\u03c9r + k0\u03c9m = 0 determine the scaling of the resonant part of the Hamiltonian that directly reintroduces part of the heteronuclear dipolar coupling. Their magnitude for a certain k0 value changes with the 1H offset and RF field amplitude because of the changes in the interaction-frame trajectory. Figure 3\nshows the logarithm of the magnitude of the resonant Fourier coefficients log10(a\n(n016n,0)) for n0 = 1 and n0 = 2 as a function of the RF field amplitude (\u03bd1) and offset frequency (\u0394\u03a9) for the three MAS frequencies 100, 60, and 40 kHz, respectively. In all cases, the resonant contributions are minimal on-resonance and increase with increasing resonance offset. With increasing rf-field amplitude, offset effects become smaller. For lower MAS frequency, the value of k0 = n016n at the resonance condition is smaller due to the choice of the spacing of the pulses (smaller value of n) and the values of log10(a\n(k0 ,0)) get larger. For 100 kHz MAS, the magnitude of the Fourier component\nat the resonance conditions increases for higher values of the RF field, the enhancement in magnitude being faster for n0 = 1 than for n0 = 2. For on-resonant irradiation, i.e., \u0394\u03a9 = 0, the line broadening by the resonance conditions is negligible, whereas for off-resonance irradiation, there is a significant influence on the decoupling efficiency, especially in the high-power irradiation regime. One can see that in the low-power decoupling regime, the magnitude of the resonant contribution to the linewidth is quite small even for off-resonance irradiation, suggesting a better robustness toward 1H offset under low-power irradiation than in the case of high-power irradiation. If the spinning frequency is decreased, lower values of k0 determine the Fourier coefficients at the resonance conditions. The magnitude of the resonance conditions becomes quite large (except on resonance), and therefore, the decoupling will be worse at lower MAS frequencies. In conclusion, the main contribution to the line broadening as a function of 1H offset is from the first-order resonance conditions and not the second-order cross terms. The amplitude of the resonance conditions is especially high in the high-power irradiation regime or for low spinning frequencies. Therefore, robustness regarding 1H offset is expected in the low-power irradiation regime under fast MAS.\nFIG. 5.

Especially the resonant terms generate directly a dipolar coupling scaled by the Fourier coefficient. Even Fourier coefficients as small as 10\u22123 and below will lead to a significant broadening of the line due to the large values of the one-bond couplings. The same is true for the second-order cross terms between homonuclear and heteronuclear couplings that can both have anisotropies in the order of 45\u201350 kHz."

In our previous work,25 it was demonstrated experimentally that n should have different values, depending on the MAS frequency, to obtain a decoupling sequence that is almost independent of the RF power. It was found that good choices are n = 6 for \u03bdr = 100 kHz, n = 4 for \u03bdr = 60 kHz, and n = 2 for \u03bdr = 40 kHz, respectively. Here, the effect of the delay\nJ. Chem.

The results obtained for 60 and 40 kHz MAS are presented in the supplementary material (Fig. S3). It was found that the larger the delay between the \u03c0-pulses, the smaller the magnitude of the second-order cross-terms, whatever the rotation frequency. This case of large delays corresponds to a pulsed decoupling regime, where the spacing between the pulses is at least twice the pulse length. This is not surprising since second-order cross-terms between the CSA and the heteronuclear dipolar coupling would be zero without RF irradiation and only\ncross-terms between the homonuclear and heteronuclear dipolar coupling would exist.\nThe magnitude of the first-order resonance conditions as a function of the RF power and 1H offset for 100 kHz MAS and different delays between the \u03c0-pulses are shown in Fig. 5, whereas the results for 60 kHz MAS and 40 kHz MAS can be found in the supplementary material (Fig. S4). Increasing the delay between the \u03c0-pulses, the magnitude of the first-order resonance conditions becomes smaller, especially for low RF fields. This is not surprising since higher Fourier coefficients are important at the resonance conditions that are typically decreasing in magnitude. One can see that for 100 kHz MAS and a radio-frequency field of 20 kHz, the resonance conditions for both n0 = 1 and n0 = 2 are small, enabling to obtain robustness toward 1H offset, whatever is the delay between\nFIG. 7.

For lower spinning frequency, it is not possible to avoid simultaneously the two resonance conditions (n0 = 1 and n0 = 2), whatever the RF power. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve robustness toward 1H offset.\nThese results demonstrate that robustness toward 1H offset can be obtained for fast spinning frequencies (e.g., 100 kHz) and low radio-frequency irradiation. Increasing the delay between the \u03c0-pulses has no significant effect on the 1H offset since magnitude of the second-order cross-terms and first-order resonance conditions exhibit a small modification in their magnitude. Therefore, one can use the ROSPAC decoupling sequence in the intermediate decoupling regime, where the delay between the \u03c0-pulses is closer to the \u03c0-pulse lengths (e.g., 6\u03c4r for 100 kHz MAS). In that case, one achieves good robustness toward 1H offset and one obtains a decoupling that is almost independent of the RF power."

            "text": "The RF field over the full volume of a rotor that is generated in a solenoid coil is inhomogeneous over the sample volume, and in addition, MAS modulates the rf-field amplitude. A spin system travels through areas of different RF amplitudes, and the modulation becomes particularly severe at the end regions of the coil where the relative RF amplitude varies up to 25%.34 Static and MASmodulated RF-field inhomogeneities affect the signal intensity in the NMR spectra. Thus, the design of heteronuclear decoupling pulse sequences that are robust toward RF-field inhomogeneities is of great interest. In this subsection, we demonstrated the influence of\nthe flip angle on the decoupling performance to illustrate robustness toward RF field inhomogeneities.\nFigure 6 shows the logarithm of the magnitude of the scaling factors [log10(q (\u03bd) IS\u2297I) and log10(q (\u03bd) IS\u2297II)] as a function of the RF pulse flip angle, for a rotation frequency of 100 kHz, in three decoupling regimes: low-power, intermediate-power, and high-power. The second-order cross terms between heteronuclear dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy are slightly affected by radiofrequency field inhomogeneities, especially in the low-power decoupling regime, where the CSA and RF terms have the same order of magnitude. However, one can see that choosing a flip angle in the range of 160\u25cb\u2013170\u25cb or 190\u25cb\u2013200\u25cb enables us to minimize variations due to the RF field inhomogeneities. The second-order cross-terms between heteronuclear and homonuclear dipolar couplings present resonance conditions outside the previously mentioned intervals (e.g., for a flip angle of 180\u25cb), but their magnitude remains small whatever the variation of the magnetic field. The scaling factors were also calculated for 60 and 40 kHz spinning frequencies, and are reported in the supplementary material (Fig. S5). Decreasing the spinning frequency, the magnitude of the second-order crossterms between heteronuclear dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy becomes slightly higher, but the decoupling is still robust toward RF field inhomogeneities for the same ranges of the flip angle as in the case of 100 kHz MAS.\nThe first-order resonance conditions as a function of the RF pulse flip angle were also evaluated, for three rotation frequencies: 100 kHz (Fig. 7), 60, and 40 kHz, respectively (supplementary material, Fig. S6). They have the same behavior as the second-order\nFIG. 8.

This result is in agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 8) that show also a plateau of good decoupling in the range of roughly 160\u25cb\u2013200\u25cb. Moreover, it was observed experimentally that changing the delay between the \u03c0\u2212pulses does not have a strong influence on the robustness toward RF field amplitude changes. These results confirm the ease of setup of the ROSPAC heteronuclear decoupling sequence."
