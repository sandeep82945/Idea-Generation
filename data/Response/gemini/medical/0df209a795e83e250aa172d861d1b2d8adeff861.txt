1. **Investigate the role of specific microbial metabolites in the pathophysiology of depression.**

   * Identify and characterize microbial metabolites that are altered in individuals with depression.
   * Determine the mechanisms by which these metabolites affect brain function and behavior.
   * Develop strategies to modulate the production of these metabolites as a potential therapeutic approach for depression.


2. **Explore the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the microbiota–gut–brain axis in individuals with depression.**

   * Conduct clinical trials to assess the efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics in improving symptoms of depression.
   * Investigate the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the gut microbiome, microbial metabolites, and brain function in individuals with depression.
   * Determine the optimal dosage, duration, and strain of prebiotics and probiotics for the treatment of depression.


3. **Investigate the role of the microbiota–gut–brain axis in the bidirectional relationship between obesity and depression.**

   * Determine the mechanisms by which obesity and depression influence the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites.
   * Investigate the effects of weight loss interventions on the microbiota–gut–brain axis and symptoms of depression.
   * Develop strategies to target the microbiota–gut–brain axis as a potential therapeutic approach for both obesity and depression.


4. **Develop novel prebiotics and probiotics with enhanced efficacy and safety for the treatment of depression.**

   * Screen and identify novel prebiotics and probiotics with specific properties that are beneficial for brain health.
   * Develop targeted delivery systems to improve the bioavailability and efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics in the gut.
   * Investigate the potential of combining prebiotics and probiotics with other therapeutic approaches for depression, such as antidepressants or psychotherapy.


5. **Investigate the long-term effects of prebiotics and probiotics on mental health.**

   * Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of prebiotics and probiotics on symptoms of depression and other mental health outcomes.
   * Investigate the potential of prebiotics and probiotics to prevent the development of depression and other mental health disorders.
   * Determine the optimal timing and duration of prebiotic and probiotic interventions for long-term mental health benefits.
