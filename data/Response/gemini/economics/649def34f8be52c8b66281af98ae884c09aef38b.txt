1. **Developing models for predicting textual relations and detailed concept descriptions in scientific papers.** This would help to close the gap in KB coverage of scientific concepts and improve the quality of the literature graph.
2. **Augmenting the relations imported from the KB with relations extracted from text.** This would help to improve the coverage and accuracy of the literature graph.
3. **Developing methods for extracting non-textual components such as charts, diagrams, and tables from scientific documents.** This would provide access to key information that is currently not available in the literature graph.
4. **Developing models for classifying citations as important or incidental.** This would help users to better understand the impact of a paper and effectively navigate its citations.
5. **Developing models for predicting which papers should be cited in a given draft.** This would help to improve the quality of a paper draft before it is submitted for peer review or used to supplement the list of references after a paper is published.
