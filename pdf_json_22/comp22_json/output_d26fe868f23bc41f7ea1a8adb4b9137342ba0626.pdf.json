    "abstractText": "In recent times, Distributed Generation (DG) penetration, especially, through Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has been growing immensely due to marginal carbon footprints. Furthermore, they make system more reliable by minimizing the voltage deviation of the distribution network. Nevertheless, to exploit the DGs in the best manner, they need to be sited and rated optimally. Diverse solutions exist for the problem mainly classified as: analytical approaches, classical non-linear optimization algorithms and meta-heuristic methods. With the objective of minimizing power loss, this manuscript proposes a novel hybrid meta-heuristics approach: Particle Swarm Optimization-Coral Reef Optimization (PSO-CRO) for identifying an optimum positioning and rating of Type-1, Type-2 & Type-3 DGs (at 0.82 optimal power factor) in IEEE 33, 69 & 118 bus Radial Distributed System (RDS). Furthermore, the results from the proposed hypothesis are compared with its prevalent peers, namely, PSO, CRO, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), PSO-GSA and PSO-Grey Wolf Optimization (PSO-GWO) etc. The results of the proposed algorithm are also compared with the results of GAMS/CONOPT commercial solver. The simulation results prove the robustness, higher efficacy and faster convergence of the proposed method when applied to larger distribution systems.

INTRODUCTION\nAN electrical power network consists of a transmissionsystem and a distribution system. A distribution network is usually a radial or weekly connected ring type system that draws power from a single generator bus and transmits it to individual load buses. Such type of structures have high R/X ratio which results in high power loss as well as low voltage profile [1]\u2013[3]. Additionally, industrial loads often cause dramatic load variations that causes voltage collapses.\nPreventive measures like \u201cfeeder reconfiguration\u201d [4], [5] and \u201ccapacitor bank/DG placement\u201d [6] may be employed to reduce high power loss and low voltage profile respectively. Distribution systems have various tie-switches which may be opened/closed in such a manner that the power loss is minimized which inherently improves voltage profile.\nGenerally, low rating renewable energy sources come in the category of DGs. They have emerged as the alternative\nsolution to power loss and voltage regulation problems in RDS. Proper sizing and placing of DGs reduces total active power loss [7] and improve the voltage profile of each bus [8]. DGs can be employed to inject the appropriate type of power as enlisted in table I. DGs may also be utilized for reliability augmentation and future investment deferral on the system equipment.\nContemporarily most power system optimization problems are being catered through metaheuristic algorithms. Numerous applications of metaheuristic optimization approaches in power system include optimal DG integration [9], network reconfiguration [10], optimal phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement [11], optimal scheduling of generators [12], [13], real time economic dispatch with DGs [14], [15] and VAR compensation [16].\nEssentially, DGs integration problem encapsulates the optimal siting and sizing of utility owned DGs in RDS.

[17], [18] . Copious methodologies are available for the said problem in the scripts like analytical approach, classical non-linear optimization algorithms and bio-inspired approaches [19].\nBio-inspired algorithms used for the for DG allocation and sizing problem include particle swarm optimization (PSO) [20], improved PSO (IPSO) [21], genetic algorithm (GA) [22], hybrid GA-PSO algorithm [23], harmony search algorithm (HS) [24], big bang-big crunch algorithm (BBBCA) [25], [26], grey wolf optimization (GWO) [27], Genetic Algorithm-Tabu Search (GA-TS) [28], Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) [29] and PSO & shuffled frog leaping algorithm (PSO-SLF) [30] etc.\nA. LITERATURE REVIEW\nMost researchers use power loss minimization as the fitness function for the problem of optimal siting & sizing of DG. [31] utilized GA-PSO to optimize the size of DG and also determine the site of the same by taking active, reactive power loss & voltage deviation as an weighted fitness function and the results were compared with GA and PSO individually with DG and without DG. In [32] , authors proposed a mixed integer conic programming (MICP) model to find the optimal type, size and site of DG to minimize the cost in several aspects objective function, investment, production, CO2 emission and load shedding for various cases like when considering only gas turbine generation, wind turbine and energy storage device (ESD), PV generation, intermittent of DG and ESD and considering all alternatives. The proposed approach is directly applied to the application. In [33] Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA), a two stage optimization\napproach has been employed for optimal zero power factor DG integration in 123-bus IEEE network. Voltage regulator tap and power loss minimization has been taken as objective function. Results has been compared with that of classical mixed-integer nonlinear programming, GA, PSO and GWO. A hybrid of empirical discrete metaheuristic & steepest descent method is proposed in [34] to solve problem of optimal DG location-allocation by minimizing power loss. Qualitative and quantitative analysis in terms of efficiency, convergence & robustness has been carried out on 34-bus IEEE network. Optimal planning of only Type-1 DG has been presented in the paper. An improved parameter PSO and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) has been proposed in [35] for optimal planning of individual and multiple Type1 DGs with the aim of minimizing active power loss. The results are tested over 33 & 69-bus IEEE networks. The novel quasi-op-positional chaotic symbiotic organisms search algorithm has been proposed in [36]. The aim is to minimize system power loss and place the multiple Type-1 and Type2 DGs with appropriate size at optimal location in 33 & 69- bus IEEE networks. Every optimization algorithm may not be suitable for finding the optimal solution of each type of DG. Uniform Voltage Distribution Algorithm (UVDA) proposed in [37] is not suitable for optimal siting and sizing of Type-2 DG. Authors in [38] came up with new hybrid of Cuckoo Search technique & Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm for optimal planning of Type-1 DG. The objective function adopted is weighted sum of loss, voltage deviation and cost of DG power generated. Single and multi-objective based improved harris hawks optimization algorithm has been presented in [39] for optimal integration of unity pf, 0.95 lead pf and optimal pf DGs in 33 & 69-bus IEEE networks. An improved eco system based optimization approach is implemented by the authors in [40] for optimal integration of unity pf, fixed pf & optimal pf DGs in 33 & 69-bus IEEE networks."

CONTRIBUTION AND PAPER ORGANIZATION\nRadial distribution system has large R/X ratio that results in high power loss during power transmission. Now-a-days optimally placed distributed generators (DGs) are utilised to generate power in decentralised manner to compensate the power loss in the distribution system. Several work has been reported in literature on optimal placement of distributed generators for loss minimization. These methodologies may broadly be classified as analytical approaches and metaheuristic approaches. Analytical approaches are found most accurate in solving optimal DG integration problem but the major drawback is that these are not suitable for large power system networks [41]. The drawback of the analytical approaches has been overcome by classical non-linear optimization algorithms. But such optimization algorithms generally get stuck at local minima and fail to find optimal solution [41].\nLately, meta heuristic optimization techniques have been employed by several researchers for a variety of optimization problems. The convergence and efficacy of the metaheuristic approaches can further be improved by hybridizing two optimization techniques. This motivated authors of the paper to propose a new metaheuristic approach for optimal placement of DGs by hybridizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) and coral reef optimization (CRO). The exploration capability of PSO and the exploitation capability of Coral reef optimization (CRO) approach enables the proposed metaheuristic approach to avoid local minima and reach global optimal solution. Convergence and accuracy of the effectiveness of PSO-CRO is tested over five test functions recommended by IEEE. Further, the applicability of the approach is demonstrated on 33, 69 and 118-bus IEEE networks for optimal integration of Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 DGs. Also, the results obtained by the proposed approach for Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 DGs are compared with PSO, CRO, GSA, PSOGSA, PSO-GWO, GAMS/CONOPT commercial solver [42] and some other existing work reported in the literature. Investigations carried out on three test systems shows the preeminence of proposed approach over existing approaches.\nThe paper has been structured as follows. Section II provides an overview of DG classification based on of active/reactive power absorption/dispatch to/from grid. Section III provides mathematical outlook of the problem. Section IV depicts the fundamentals of the proposed method. Section V confers the results of the various methods for Type-1, Type-2 & Type-3 DGs on both 33, 69 & 118 bus systems and critically compares the results. Statistical analysis proves the superiority of the proposed approach over PSO & CRO. Simulation results depict the optimal size of DGs, system power loss corresponding to the optimal DG size and voltage profile for 33, 69 & 118 bus IEEE networks. Section VI summarizes the method\u2019s conceptual and programming simplicity, fastness and efficacy and its ability to identify the optimal solution in all types of RDS."

Zero indicates neither injection nor absorption.\nDistributed generators having unity power factor and injecting only active power to the power system (like PV cell and fuel cell) falls into category of Type-1 DG. Zero power factor DGs (like KVAr compensator, synchronous condensers and capacitors) inject only reactive power to the power system and falls in Type-2 category of DGs. Distributed generators with leading power factor such as diesel genset that injects both active and reactive power to the power system network fall into the category of Type-3 DG. Type-4 DG injects active power to the power system and absorbs reactive power. Such type of DGs operate at lagging power factor. Wind turbines/wind energy generator or induction generators operating at fixed speed fall under the category of Type-4 DG. However, Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) can either absorb or deliver reactive power to the grid. Wind turbine driven DFIG operating at leading power factor and injecting reactive power to the grid can be considered as Type 3 DG instead of Type 4.\nIn this work, optimal placement of Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 DGs have been contemplated."

The proposed approach exhibits improved performance, flexibility in decision making, intelligence and high scalable property over conventional optimization approaches. PSOCRO is flexible in decision making and it determines the alternate optimal solutions for a problem. On the contrary, conventional algorithm\u2019s flexibility in decision making depends on the user\u2019s understanding over problem. Intelligence in the proposed approach involves a bottom-up approach, which generates simple basic rules, whereas in conventional algorithm rules generation is problem dependent. Improved CRO approach is highly scalable but conventional algorithms are scalable up to certain extend. Less computational time, cost effectiveness, ease of programming and lesser mathematical complexity are the advantages of improved CRO approach over conventional optimization methods.\nThis section presents the application of the proposed PSOCRO approach for finding optimal location and size of DG for minimum system active power loss. It is apparent from equation (2) (in Section III) that real power loss (PLoss) is a function of power injected by DG placed at same bus. Thus, injected power as well as location of DG can be varied by proposed approach to get minimum real power loss in the network.

In this way quality of the solution is measured by mean/average and standard deviation (SD) values. Table 3 sum up the convergence profile of the three optimization techniques (PSO-CRO, PSO and CRO) for five different test functions. The proposed PSO-CRO approach is better as compared to CRO and PSO, irrespective of all test function due to lower value of mean and SD values. To assess the search capability of the proposed approach over PSO and CRO, simulations are carried out for dimension (D=5) and is shown in Fig. 10.

Convergence rate of the proposed approach is found better as compared to PSO and CRO method.\nInvestigations for optimal placement of Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 DGs on IEEE 33, 69 and 118 bus test systems have been carried out in the paper and showed proposed approach to be more effective compared to existing approaches. Statistical results showed that the proposed method has the best performance, as the median of the proposed method is nearest to the exact solution of the problem. Additionally, there are no outliers for the proposed method in any case, which indicates that it very rarely gets trapped into the local minima. Also, the Q1 and Q3, boundaries of the box, are very near to Q2 (median) which indicates that the proposed method gives the answer with minimum deviation when not able to converge onto the exact solution.\nSimulation of PSO-CRO has been carried out in the MATLAB software. Simulation results of the proposed approach present the optimal DG size and location for which system power loss is minimum. In IEEE 33 bus system the optimal solution (i.e. location and size) for Type-1, Type-2 and Type3 DGs are 6th bus (2.5751 MW), 30th bus (1.2559 MVAr) and 6th bus (3.0985 MVA), respectively. In IEEE 69 bus system the optimal solution (i.e. location and size) for Type1, Type-2 and Type-3 DGs are 61st bus (1.8666 MW), 61st bus (1.3285 MVAr) and 61st bus (2.2396 MVA), respectively. In IEEE 118 bus system the optimal solution (i.e. location and size) for Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 DGs are 71st bus (3.0073 MW), 110th bus (2.3000 MVAr) and 71st bus (3.4861 MVA), respectively.\nThe proposed method is found better based on accuracy, computational time and convergence rate as compared to PSO and CRO. The proposed method is compared and tested on 33, 69 and 118-bus IEEE networks against metaheuristic algorithms, namely, CRO, PSO, GSA, PSO-GSA & PSOGWO as well as on the GAMS/CONOPT commercial solver, and some other existing approaches. It is observed that proposed approach yields better results for optimal DGs placement compared to existing approaches considered in this work. In future research, the PSO-CRO approach might be tested on multi-objective function for optimal DG integration in radial distribution network as well as meshed system. Further research may also consider placement of Type-4 DGs using proposed PSO-CRO based approach.\nAPPENDIX\nSimulation parameters in PSO-CRO Population size=50 Maximum iterations=100 \u2227 = 55 \u03c10 = 1114 = 0.785 Fb = 0.9 Fa = 0.01 Fd = 0.1 K = 3 w = 0.5 C1 = C2 = 1 DG maximum capacities 33-bus IEEE Network Type\u2212 1DG = 4MW Type\u2212 2DG = 2.5MVAr Type\u2212 3DG = 4.5MVA 69-bus IEEE Network Type\u2212 1DG = 4MW Type\u2212 2DG = 3MVAr Type\u2212 3DG = 5MVA 118-bus IEEE Network Type\u2212 1DG = 4MW Type\u2212 2DG = 4MVAr Type\u2212 3DG = 5MVA\nREFERENCES [1] H.
