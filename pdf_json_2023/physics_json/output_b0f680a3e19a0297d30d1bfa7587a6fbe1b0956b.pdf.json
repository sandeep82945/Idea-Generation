This methodology allows access to\nhighly fluorinated glycans, illustrated with the synthesis of a penta-\nfluorinated disaccharide.\nGlycans are a large class of biomolecules that have important roles in diverse areas such as human health and biomaterials.1,2 The study of how glycans interact with proteins and how glycan structure determines materials properties is therefore of great importance. Selective fluorination of glycans is one of the strategies that enable such studies. It can be used for epitope-mapping studies, for example by comparing binding affinities3,4 or by using 19F NMR based experiments,5 for 18F based diagnostic applications,6 or fluorine can be introduced to deliberately modify protein-carbohydrate interactions as its small size, high electronegativity, and non-polarizable electron pairs affect most of the interaction mechanisms.7 Finally, carbohydrate fluorination influences their hydrolytic and enzymatic stability, and has received attention for property optimisation in a drug development context.8,9 Insights in glycan-based materials properties can be obtained by fluorination, which disrupts local hydrogen bonding networks.10,11\nIn the vast majority of cases, monofluorinated sugar units are employed. Site-selective fluorination, even of smaller oligosaccharides, is not trivial, and glycosylation involving fluorinated monosaccharide building blocks is usually the only practical way to obtain fluorinated glycans. Enzymatic\nglycosylations are possible,12,13 but so far only work with monofluorinated donors.14 Fluorination has a negative effect on glycosylation rates because its strong electron withdrawing effect destabilizes glycosylation transition states.7 Chemical synthesis of glycans involving one or more monofluorinated sugar building blocks has been successfully demonstrated.15,16\nGlycosylation involving polyfluorinated donors is less common,17 and demonstrated with 2,6-18,19 and 3,6-20 difluorinated donors (Fig. 1A). With fluorination at successive carbon atoms next to the anomeric centre, only glycosidation reactions have been reported (Fig. 1B). With a hexafluorinated donor, DiMagno notably achieved glycosidation using the very reactive triflate leaving group.21 Our group reported an anomeric\na School of Chemistry, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK b Department of Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry, Ghent University,\nGhent 9000, Belgium.

Using the same donor, BF3 OEt2-mediated SN1-type anomeric alkylation also led to good results (not shown).26,27\nIncorporation of polyfluorinated sugars into glycans will enable novel opportunities for the study of protein-carbohydrate interactions and glycan-based biomaterials. As anomeric alkylation is inherently less attractive for this purpose, not least due to the inevitable inversion of configuration at an acceptor ring position, a conventional glycosylation approach is desired. Here we report our first results of glycosidation and glycosylation of 2,3-difluoro- and 2,3,4-trifluorinated glucose and galactose donors (Fig. 1C).\nAnticipating a low donor reactivity, our attention went first to the use of glycosyl triflates as donors, which were synthesised by treatment of the reducing sugar with Tf2O. However, they proved too reactive to be isolated, and their reaction with excess methanol as acceptor led to a complex reaction mixture. The corresponding tosylate donor, which was synthesised by reaction of the hemiacetal with Ts2O, was stable enough to be isolated, but glycosidation reactions also led to complex reaction mixtures. To our delight, attempts to use the conventional trichloroacetimidate group as donor proved successful, prompting their further investigation.\nThe syntheses of the trichloroacetimidate donors was achieved according to the procedure developed by Schmidt et al28 using the corresponding reducing sugar, 10 equiv. of trichloroacetonitrile, and 0.1 equiv. of DBU (Scheme 1). The reaction was stirred overnight to maximise the formation of the a-anomer, and high yields and selectivities were obtained. Deactivating ester protecting groups were selected in the first instance as a \u2018worst case\u2019 reactivity scenario.\nTo enable comparison with Gilmour\u2019s seminal work on 2-F glucose and -galactose donors,29 glycosidation with 2-propanol under TMSOTf catalysis was investigated first. In our hands, increasing the equivalents of TMSOTf from 0.1 to 0.2 and using rigorously dry conditions including distilled dichloromethane\nsolvent over CaH2 was required to achieve reproducible reactions. In order to ensure quantitative integration of anomeric ratios by 19F{1H} NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture, a delay time of 3 s was used. The glucose and galactose donors 7 and 11 were investigated first (Table 1). In general, reactions proceeded in excellent yields with the glucose donor displaying a lower reactivity compared to the galactose donor, for which almost quantitative yields were obtained even at 50 1C. This was a surprising finding, given the corresponding peracetylated 2-deoxy-2-fluoro galactose trichloroacetimidate was reported not to react below 01 (leading to 45% yield of the isopropyl glycoside).\u202116,30 The anomeric selectivity is enhanced in favour of the b-anomer at lower temperature, with high b-selectivities obtained for the galactose donor. Reaction of the glucose donor 7 at room temperature or higher resulted in the a-glycoside as the major anomer in a 1.2/1 ratio.\nThe glycosidation was then investigated with the different donor substrates (Table 2), all at temperatures of 30 1C. For the glucose donors, the change of an acetate for a benzyl group (8) led to a slight decrease in yield and anomer ratio, which was unexpected based on Gilmour\u2019s report of pronounced\nScheme 1 Syntheses of the trichloroacetimidate donors.\na Isolated yield. b Determined by 19F{1H} NMR spectroscopy of the crude reaction mixture. c Not tried. d Calculated from isolated mixture of SM and P.\nDonor X (Y = H) Glucoside Yielda (a/bb) Donor Y (X = H) Galactoside Yielda (a/bb)\n7 OAc 13 499% (1/3.2) 10 OAc 17 499% (1/4.7) 8 OBn 15 86% (1/1.4) 11 OBz 14 90% (1/4.0) 9 F 16 34% (1/2.1) 12 F 18 499% (1/9.0)\na Isolated yield. b Determined by 19F{1H} NMR of the crude reaction mixture.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

For the galactose donors, the presence of a smaller acetate (10) instead of benzoate (11) slightly increased the anomeric product ratio, while reaction of the 2,3,4- trifluorinated galactose donor 12 yielded the glycoside 18 in quantitative yield with a much higher 1 : 9 b-selectivity.\nNext, glycosylation using sugar-based acceptors was investigated. Such glycosylations are more challenging, given the reduced reactivities of sugar alcohol groups. The six donors 7\u201312 were reacted with galactoside diacetonide (Table 3). To enable comparison with the data in Table 2, reactions were also carried out at 30 1C. For both the glucose and galactose donors, excellent yields were obtained, which were superior (in the case of glucose-based donors 7\u20139) or similar (galactosebased 10\u201312) compared to the isopropanol glycosidation yields. In contrast, in all cases significant erosion of the anomeric selectivities was observed compared to the results in Table 2.\nThe glycosylation scope of 11 and 12 was further investigated (Fig. 2). Glycosylation at the 4-position of a rhamnoside acceptor led to disaccharides 25 and 26 in excellent yield. In contrast, glycosylation at the 6-position of a 2-deoxy-2azidoglucoside acceptor was low-yielding (27, 28), although raising the temperature to 0 1C was sufficient to obtain 28 in 89% yield. Glycosylation with a difluorinated acceptor at 30 1C to give the tetra- and pentafluorinated disaccharides 29 and 30 proceeded only in good yield with donor 10, but increasing the temperature to 0 1C significantly enhanced the yield. The anomeric selectivities were much reduced, with glycosylations to give 27 and 29 even displaying a-selectivity.\nA control experiment was conducted to investigate the possibility of anomerisation under the reaction conditions (Scheme 2). A mixture of trichloroacetimidate 7 (1.0 equiv.) and isopropyl galactopyranoside 17 (1.0 equiv., a/b 1 : 5.2) were subjected to glycosylation conditions, with 1-propanol (2.4 equiv.) as acceptor at 0 1C. 19F{1H} NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture indicated no change in the anomeric ratio of 17, or any evidence for the formation of crossglycosylation products such as 13 or 32. Hence, the reaction is not reversible under the employed reaction conditions\n(Scheme 2). Incidentally, the higher anomeric ratio of the glycosidation product 31 compared to that of the isopropyl glycoside (1 : 1.3 a/b, Table 1) is expected given the lower steric hindrance of propanol.30\nA tentative model for the observed anomeric selectivities of the peracetylated donors, limited to the 4H3 and\n3H4 halfchair conformations, is shown in Fig. 3. The reactivity of the acetylated polyfluorinated donors is clearly similar compared to the peracetylated 2-deoxy-2-fluoroGlc/Gal trichloroacetimida-tes investigated by Gilmour,29,30 While this was not expected, fluorine and acetate groups do have similar \u2018field inductive effect parameters\u2019.31 Hence, a similar \u2018\u2018SN1-like\u2019\u2019\n29 transition state (TS) is assumed as well as the preponderance of the\nTable 3 Glycosylation with galactose diacetonide at 30 1C\nDonor X (Y = H) Glucoside Yielda (a/bb) Donor Y (X = H) Galactoside Yielda (a/bb)\n7 OAc 19 499% (1/1.1) 10 OAc 22 499% (1/1.0) 8 OBn 20 499% (1/1.0) 11 OBz 23 89% (1.3/1)c 9 F 21 499% (1/1.0) 12 F 24 499% (1/1.7)\na Isolated yield. b Determined by 19F{1H} NMR. c 50 1C.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

When glucose-configured, substituents at the 3- and 4-position are axial, which has been reported to individually lead to stabilisation of the TS,32 but as part of a glucose framework also undergo destabilising steric interactions,32,33 leading to lower levels of b-selectivities. This could be the reason why 13, with a small fluorine at C3, is formed with higher selectivity compared to 32, which has a larger acetate group at C3. There may also be unfavourable 1,3-diaxial interactions between the substituents at the 2- and 4-positions, which will be larger with a 4F substituent, consistent with a lower b-selectivity for 16. For the galactoses, the substituent at the 4-position is equatorial, which is also expected to destabilise the positive charge at the reacting centre. This effect may lead to a shift in reaction mechanism away from SN1, which would favour b-selectivity. Glycosylation with the less reactive sugar acceptors is expected to give increased SN1 character. 34 Larger nucleophiles also experience repulsion from the axial substituent at C3,35 which reduces b-selectivities, as observed (Table 3 and Fig. 2). These data show that this reduction in b-selectivity is much more pronounced with a 4-OBz substituent compared to 4F, indicating that the effect of a 4-OBz group further increases the TS energy difference in favour of the 4H3 halfchair, for which it is tempting to invoke remote ester participation.36 However, there are other effects at play, including involvement of covalent glycosyl triflates and hyperconjugative stabilisations, as well as the presence of other oxonium ion conformations.33,37,38\nIn summary, a series of novel 2,3-difluorinated and 2,3, 4-trifluorinated glucose and galactose trichloroacetimidates are excellent donors for both glycosidation and glycosylation under typical Lewis-acid catalysed conditions, despite their high fluorination content. Excellent anomeric selectivities were obtained for glycosidation reactions with isopropanol, but glycosylation reactions using less reactive alcohol acceptors generally proceeded with low selectivities. As expected, galactose configured donors are more reactive. The glycosylation allows the synthesis of polyfluorinated disaccharides with multiple fluorination in each ring. Further optimisations to increase anomeric selectivities are ongoing. This convenient glycosylation of polyfluorinated glycosyl donors opens up new avenues in glycan-based glycobiology and materials research.\nK. H. and B. L. thank Southampton University for funding.
