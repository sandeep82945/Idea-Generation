    "abstractText": "Stigma is one of the main barriers to prevention, treatment and recovery from mental illness. However, bibliometric studies in this area are still scarce. Therefore, our aim was to quantify and analyze the scientific literature on the stigma of nursing students and professionals towards mental disorders. To this purpose, bibliometric indicators of scientific production, impact and collaboration were used. Among our results, it stands out that only 14.3% of the total number of studies analyzed measure the efficacy of the interventions carried out to reduce stigma. Furthermore, with exceptions such as Happell B and Byrne L, collaborations between authors and institutions are limited. \u201cService user involvement\u201d appeared as a prominent keyword in 2018, coinciding with the increase in publications on the effectiveness of interventions. Interventions based on the involvement of people with psychiatric diagnoses in the design of nursing curricula seem to become a promising line of research. More studies measuring the efficacy of such interventions are needed. Knowledge of the lines of research that are being developed and of the researchers and institutions involved can contribute to creating synergy between the different researchers and to continue adding projects to the existing ones, thus contributing to the generation of more robust results that show the most indicated interventions to reduce the still present stigma and improve care for people with psychiatric diagnoses.",

            "text": "Although mental health is a priority for the World Health Organization (WHO), as expressed by its statement that there can be \u201cno health without mental health\u201d [1], mental disorders remain one of the main causes of disability and dependence. In 2007, neuropsychiatric diseases accounted for 14% of the global burden of diseases [2]. Moreover, their incidence continues to increase annually, such that the WHO estimates that by 2030, depression will be the leading cause of disability worldwide. The economic burden attributed to mortality and morbidity associated with mental illness exceeds 4% of the gross domestic product (GDP), approximately EUR 600 billion, of the 28 countries that comprise the European Union [2]. Several national governments are implementing initiatives to reduce the impact of mental illness and its associated costs. However, the expected results have not been achieved. There is still a large difference between the need for treatment by users and its provision by healthcare systems. In low- and middle-income countries, between 76% and 85% of individuals with severe mental disorders do not receive treatment, and in high-income countries, the figure is between 35% and 50% [1]. Stigma is one of the main barriers to the prevention, treatment of and recovery from mental illness. Unsurprisingly, because of its negative consequences, stigma is considered\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1839. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031839 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1839 2 of 14\nby several researchers to be a \u201csecond disease\u201d for individuals with a diagnosed mental disorder [3,4]. Stigma occurs when negative attributes, such as dangerousness and lack of responsibility and credibility, are associated with a person or group. Consequently, there is a desire for distancing and avoidance on the part of the majority social group, which results in the stigmatized group\u2019s loss of status and discrimination at both the individual and structural levels [5]. In the field of health services, health professionals exhibit stigmatizing behaviors towards individuals with mental illness [6]. Health professionals\u2019 perceptions of schizophrenia, depression and substance abuse do not differ from the views held by the general population [6\u20138]. Specifically, nursing professionals perceive individuals with mental illness as dangerous, unpredictable and emotionally unstable and experience fear, guilt and hostility towards patients with psychiatric illnesses [8]. Because of the stereotypical association with danger, health professionals are less willing to care for the patient or to administer such care alone [9,10]. In turn, the lack of credibility afforded to persons with mental disorders makes it possible for discomfort described by the patient to be attributed to side effects of psychotropic drugs or to the mental disorder itself rather than to the presence of a somatic pathology, resulting in fewer preventive interventions [11\u201313]. Consequently, individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have a higher risk of high blood pressure, diabetes or cardiac or respiratory problems than the general population and have a shorter life expectancy due to the associated complications [14]. Scientific journals are the main means of validating new knowledge and disseminating it within the research community and to society and its agents [15]. Bibliometric analyses are increasingly used in the medical sciences because they facilitate the evaluation of published scientific research results and analysis of both scientific productivity on a given topic and the impact of research on a specific topic in terms of visibility, trends and future inquiry. However, few such bibliometric studies were conducted in the field of nursing and psychiatry [16,17], although nursing is one of the health professions that can make the greatest contribution to the treatment and recovery of individuals suffering from mental illness. In this study, we used bibliometric indicators of scientific production, impact and collaboration with the aim of quantifying and analyzing the scientific literature on the stigma of nursing students and professionals towards mental disorders. Specifically to know the research activity and collaboration among authors and identify future trends in this line of research."

Discussion The aim of this study has been to synthesize information on the production, impact, areas of interest and general characteristics of studies conducted on the stigma of nursing students and professionals towards people with mental disorders The earliest article related to nursing and attitudes towards mental illness that was identified was Change in nursing students\u2019 expectations regarding mental patients [23]; this work was published in the US Journal of Nursing Research. After 1966, the production trend remained stable, with an average of one article published per year, until 1996, a year in which production began to increase gradually. Between 1999 and 2005, the European Commission published a series of resolutions and conclusions about the need to promote mental health and combat stigma and discrimination towards those suffering from mental illness [24]. In addition, the WHO published a document characterizing the magnitude of the problem in terms of the number of people affected by a mental disorder and its future repercussions [25]. We believe that the resolutions adopted by the European Commission, together with the WHO\u2019s declaration, contributed decisively to an increase in the number of studies on this topic, with the most-cited article thus far having been published in 2009: Stigma, negative attitudes and discrimination towards mental illness within the nursing profession: A review of the literature [12]. This article was published in the JPMHN, and it has a total of 168 citations for an average of 14 citations per year. The year 2015 marked the acceleration of the number of publications, with 86 articles published in just 5 years, representing 44.10% of the total production. Our results show that the countries that have published the most on this topic are the USA (n = 29), Australia (n = 27) and England (n = 17). These results are in line with those obtained by [26]. The USA traditionally leads lists of countries with the most publications. This result is partly expected due to the country\u2019s large number of research institutions and universities; thus, in absolute numbers, its number of publications is very high. Australia has increased its production of nursing publications since 2000 due in part to two factors: First, since that date, nursing professionals are able to choose to earn a doctorate; and second, Australian institutions have shown an interest in making research results visible with the aim of improving clinical practice [27]. In fact, the two authors who have researched the study topic the most, Brenda Happell and Chris Platania-Phung, are affiliated with Australian institutions.\nFigure 7.

This result is partly expected due to the country\u2019s large number of research institutions and universities; thus, in absolute numbers, its number of publications is very high. Australia has increased its production of nursing publications since 2000 due in part to two factors: First, since that date, nursing professionals are able to choose to earn a doctorate; and second, Australian institutions have shown an interest in making research results visible with the aim of improving clinical practice [27]. In fact, the two authors who have researched the study topic the most, Brenda Happell and Chris Platania-Phung, are affiliated with Australian institutions. On the other hand, it should be noted that 77.9% of the studies were conducted in countries with high SDI. The SDI is an index that measures the socio-economic development of a region and is therefore closely related to health outcomes. It is in these countries that the issue of professional stigma is of interest and studied. It seems logical for several reasons. One of them is, as we have indicated above, developed countries conduct the most gross research (on any topic), and that is reflected in this topic as well. However, other reasons could be that in less developed countries, research efforts are focused on health problems that are more significant for them or where nurses are still minorly involved in health research, or it may even be related to cultural and/or organizational issues related to the view of mental illness or the scarcity of specialized services to care for people with mental illness. Analysis of a co-citation map reveals the most influential authors on a specific topic and the closeness of the research topics [28]. We identified two main clusters. The largest cluster is formed mainly by authors affiliated with large research groups. In particular, Corrigan P.W. and Link B.G. are psychologists affiliated with research groups on stigma in the US. Thornicroft G. and Angermeyer M.C. are psychiatrists who belong to research groups on stigma in the UK and Germany, respectively. These authors have researched stigma since the 1990s and have investigated the stigma process and the consequences for persons suffering from stigma. In addition, they have developed a theoretical framework to generate an operational definition and allow for the quantification of this phenomenon [5,29]. The most co-cited author in this study, Brenda Happell, belongs to the next largest cluster. This author has collaborated in research groups from various Australian universities, with one of her main lines of research being lived-experience participation in nurse education [30]. At the author level, analysis of the co-authorship graph reveals that most studies were carried out in isolation, with little cooperation among authors from different entities and countries. For example, authors from Australia, China, Spain, the UK and the US published studies on the effectiveness of different interventions to reduce stigma in nursing students and professionals, but no collaboration was observed among them [31\u201335]. One of the exceptions to this phenomenon of localism in research was found in a group of authors who have collaborated frequently on the subject of interest. Happell B. and Byrne L. (two of the most co-cited authors according to our results), together with authors belonging to other institutions (Platania-Phung Ch., Schulz B., Bocking J. and Bradshaw J., among others), have collaboratively published various studies on lived-experience participation in nurse education [30,36\u201339]. Possibly due to the influence of these collaborations, we observed the evolution of the co-occurrence of keywords over the last 10 years. Synchrony was observed between the greater visibility of words related to nursing students and mental health service users and the increase in the publication of studies on lived-experience participation in nurse education. Moreover, in 2018, coinciding with greater use of the keywords \u201cservice user involvement\u201d and \u201cconsumer participation\u201d, the COMMUNE project (Co-production of Mental Health Nursing Education) was published [40]. We believe that a line of research with experienced stakeholders developed by the authors mentioned above has been well established via a collaborative project at the international level. This project is being developed in five countries: Australia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland and the Netherlands. Mental health nurses, together with users of mental health services, are collaborating\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1839 11 of 14\nclosely in the development of each of the project phases with the objective of implementing a \u201cmental health recovery\u201d module within the nursing degree curriculum [41,42]. When reviewing the nature of the studies included in this work and noting that most are observational, one can speculate on a change in trends. Starting in 2010 and coinciding again with the emergence of new lines of research involving people with a psychiatric diagnosis, the number of experimental studies measuring the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions increased [34,43\u201345]. These results are in line with those obtained by Heim et al. (2019) [46], who also observed an increase in intervention studies in recent years. Stigma is known to be one of the main barriers to maintaining physical health and to recovery in people with mental disorders [47,48]. Although research provides evidence for this theory, the data from several reviews indicate that nursing students and professionals maintain stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders [8,12,49]. We believe that continuing the lines of research initiated in recent years, in which attempts are being made to implement systematized training interventions with the participation of experts by experience within the official curricula for earning a nursing degree, will contribute to reducing stigmatizing attitudes among future nurses in addition to improving care for people with a psychiatric diagnosis.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations that must be recognized. First, a single search engine, the WOS, was used, which could bias the results. Second, due to the overlap of publications, the creation of research networks, self-citations and the mobility of researchers from one institution to another, a careful interpretation of the list of active authors and institutions may be necessary. On the other hand, in this study, the institutional attribution of documents and authors was based on the total count criterion. That is, each document was assigned simultaneously to each of the institutions affiliated with the authors. Although there were other options, this attribution was chosen because it allowed the participation of the different institutions to be quantified separately (although it had the disadvantage of increasing the number of documents in the counts)."

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform a bibliometric analysis of the publications available to date on the stigma of nursing students and professionals towards people with mental disorders. It was observed that in recent years there was an increase in research articles on this topic; however, only 15% of the texts identified were aimed at designing and measuring the effectiveness of interventions to reduce it. Currently, the most promising lines of research are those that design interventions involving people with lived experience. In this regard, in recent years, an international project has emerged in which experienced persons collaborate in the design and implementation of a recovery module that is included in nursing curricula [39]. Despite this, it appears that this international collaboration is the exception, as most research is conducted in very small contexts, with national collaborations at most. This study has made it possible to identify the main authors and institutions that research and publish on the stigma of nursing professionals towards people with mental disorders, as well as to learn about new lines of research. We believe that making this information known through this article can help to create synergies and to develop new collaborative projects for the existing ones. Collaboration between different authors, institutions and countries, especially between researchers and institutions from \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d or \u201cmiddle\u201d SDI countries, is essential to generate more robust results that show which are the most appropriate interventions to reduce the stigma still present and improve care for people with psychiatric diagnoses.\nInt.
