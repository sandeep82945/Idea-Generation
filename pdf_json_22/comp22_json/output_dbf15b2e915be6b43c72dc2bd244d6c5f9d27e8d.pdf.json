            "text": "*e history of ideological and political education (IPE) has a special status in its discipline and plays an irreplaceable basic role [1]. IPE is an important part of Chinese college education, which plays an important role and significance in improving the ideological and political level and moral cultivation of contemporary college students [2]. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that IPE should run through the whole process of education and teaching. It should not only run through the education from beginning to end but also implement the students\u2019 growth and talent from beginning to end. Although the quality of IPE work in colleges and universities has improved, there are still weak links that need to be improved [3]. Especially with the development of the Internet, whether the online moral behavior of college students is standardized has also attracted the attention of the state. On February 3, 2015, China Internet Network Information Center released the 35th Statistical Report on Internet development in China.\n*e report shows that as of December 2014, Chinese netizens reached 649 million. Students are still the largest group of Chinese netizens, accounting for 23.8%. From the research report on Internet behavior of Chinese youth in 2014, the weekly online time of college netizens increased to 25.9 hours, an increase of 0.9 hours over the previous year. College students are the largest and most active group of Chinese netizens [4]. College students\u2019 world, life, and values outlook are not fully mature, and they are easily affected by some bad factors and have network moral problems. *erefore, research on college students\u2019 network moral security behavior is necessary [5].\nUsually, in order to understand and deeply analyze the thoughts or mental health of college students, scholars use questionnaires to collect relevant data. *ey combine some data processing techniques to dig out the underlying patterns in the data. Educators can formulate some strategies for assistance and improvement based on the final analysis results. Ilieva et al. evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on college students\u2019 learning and collected information and\nHindawi Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience Volume 2022, Article ID 9885274, 8 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9885274\nRE TR AC TE D\ndata on college students\u2019 attitudes toward distance learning by issuing questionnaires. *ey proposed a new frame of reference for educational data processing. *e framework combines machine learning, multicriteria decision-making, and big data techniques with information symmetry and asymmetry [6]. Taeymans et al. distributed a questionnaire to university students to explore whether college students\u2019 lifestyle of studying during the outbreak of COVID-19 is healthy. *ey analyzed the questionnaire data using frequency analysis and nonparametric statistical methods [7]. Fook et al. pointed out that since smartphone users include students from middle school to university, frequent use of mobile phones will lead to mobile phone dependence. *is phenomenon can negatively impact the academic performance. *erefore, college students\u2019 smartphone use, time spent, factors, and activities involved were investigated, and the possible risks of college students\u2019 mobile phone addiction were demonstrated. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistical methods such as mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage [8].

            "text": "2.1. Analysis of Deep Learning Algorithms. Geoffrey Hinton first proposed deep learning (DL) in the journal Science, and it was studied by later generations and gradually emerged. DL research extends the original basis of machine learning [10]. Compared with the machine learning network, the DL network optimizes the hierarchical data of the network\nstructure, making the overall structure more complex. *e internal operation algorithm has also undergone greater progress [11, 12].\nDL learns the inherent laws and representation levels of sample data by analyzing the underlying laws and data structure levels within the sample data. *e data obtained during the learning process are used to provide reference interpretations to data in other domains [13]. Initially, the research goal of DL algorithms was to be used in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), helping AI to have the ability to analyze and learn like humans and to recognize various forms of data. DL has achieved results in many fields. *e analysis and learning ability of AI is improved through DL, thereby helping humans solve many complex data research problems [14].\nDL is a general term for data research models and methods, and DL is classified according to specific research content. *e classification results are shown in Table 1 [15].\n2.1.1. CNN. CNN is a kind of artificial neural network, which is often used in speech analysis and image recognition, and the recognition and the analysis effect is accurate and direct, so it has been widely used [16]. *e internal structure of CNN is like the biological neural network. A new weight-sharing network structure is constructed by reducing the complexity of the network structure and reducing the input weights of the model input layer. *e difference between CNN and ordinary neural networks is that CNN contains a feature extractor composed of convolutional and subsampling layers. In a convolutional layer of a CNN, a neuron is only connected to some of its neighbours. A convolutional layer of CNN usually contains several feature maps. Each feature plane consists of some neurons arranged in a rectangle, and neurons in the same feature plane share weights. Here, the shared weights are the convolution kernels. *e convolution kernel is usually initialized in the form of a random decimal matrix. During the training process of the network, the convolution kernel will learn to obtain reasonable weights. *e immediate benefit of sharing weights (convolution kernels) is to reduce the connections between the layers of the network, which in turn reduces the risk of overfitting.\nSubsampling is also called pooling, and there are usually two forms of mean subsampling and max pooling. Subsampling can be seen as a special kind of a convolution process. Convolution and subsampling greatly simplify model complexity and reduce model parameters. When the input image is a multidimensional layer, it is directly input into the algorithm structure, which saves the complicated analysis time and improves the algorithm\u2019s efficiency [17]. Additionally, CNN also has the advantage of high efficiency in training weights. For example, in the traditional neural network structure, the neuron structure of the upper and lower layers is connected to form a whole. In the process of training the weights, the parameter values that need to be trained are doubled. As for the CNN structure, it shares image data input inside the structure to each neuron through the internal \u201cconvolution kernel\u201d as the intermediary between\nRE TR AC TE Dupper and lower neurons and maintains the original locationstructure after neural network processing. *erefore, a CNN is more akin to a special multilayer perceptual device that recognizes the structure of a two-dimensional image. *e network structure also enables CNN to effectively deal with many forms of image deformations [18]. CNN is a multilayer neural network. Its structure is shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1, the basic operating units of CNN include convolution, pooling, full connection, and recognition operations. *e operation principle and process of each unit are analyzed in detail. Convolution operation: it uses the feature map of the previous layer to perform a convolution operation with a learnable convolution kernel. *e output of the convolution result after the activation function forms this layer\u2019s neurons, thus forming the feature map of this layer, also known as the feature extraction layer. *e input of each neuron is connected to the local receptive field of the previous layer, and the local features are extracted. Once the local feature is extracted, its positional relationship with other features is determined. *e input image matrix and the subsequent convolution kernel and feature map matrix are square matrices. Suppose the input matrix size is w, the convolution kernel size is k, the stride is s, and the number of zeropadded layers is p. *e feature size calculation after convolution is shown in the following equation (1) [19]: w \ufffd (w + 2p \u2212 k) s + 1. (1) Pooling operation: it can aggregate features well and reduce dimensionality to reduce the amount of computation. *e pooling operation divides the input signal into nonoverlapping regions, and the spatial resolution of the network is reduced by a pooling (downsampling) operation for each region. For example, max pooling is to select the maximum value in the area, and mean pooling is to calculate the average value in the area. *is operation is used to remove skew and distortion from the signal [20].\nFull connection operation: after the input signal undergoes multiple convolution kernel pooling operations, the extracted data features are mapped to the output layer to realize feature output. *e output is multiple groups of signals. After the full connection operation, the multiple groups of signals are sequentially combined into a group of signals.\n*e operation of the input value of each convolutional layer is shown in the following equation:\nV \ufffd conv2 (W, X, valid) + b. (2)\nIn (2), conv2 is the function of convolution operation; the third parameter valid refers to the type of convolution operation; b is the bias [21]; W is the weight matrix; the weight matrix of each layer is different; and X is in matrix form.\n*e output is shown in the following equation: Y \ufffd \u03c6(V). (3)\nIn (3), Y is in matrix form. Assuming that the last layer of the connection layer is L, the total error is shown in the following equation:\nE \ufffd 1 2 d \u2212 y 2 L2. (4)\nwhere d is the variable that is expected to be output and y is the variable output by the CNN.\n2.1.2. DBN Analysis. DBN can be interpreted as a Bayesian probabilistic generative model consisting of multiple layers of random latent variables. *e upper two layers have undirected symmetric connections, and the lower layers get top-down directed connections from the upper layer. *e state of the bottommost unit is the visible input data vector. If DBN consists of a stack of 2F structural units, the structural unit is usually a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). In the stack, the number of visible layer neurons of each RBM unit is equal to the number of hidden layer neurons of the previous RBM unit. According to the DL mechanism, the input samples are used to train the firstlayer RBM unit, and its output is used to train the secondlayer RBMmodel. *e RBMmodel is stacked to improve the model performance by adding layers. In the unsupervised pretraining process, after the DBN code is input to top-level RBM, the top-level state is decoded to the bottom-level unit to realize the reconstruction of the input. As the structural unit of DBN, RBM shares parameters with each layer of DBN [22]. DBN solves the optimization problem of deep neural networks by adopting layer-by-layer training. *e layer-by-layer training gives the whole network better initial weights to reach the optimal solution only after fine-tuning. *e essence of RBM is a powerful tool for supervised learning. It can be used to reduce the dimensionality of images with less hidden layer settings, learn to extract features for hidden layer output, auto encoder, and DBN stacked with multiple RBM, and so on.\n2.1.3. RNN. RNN is a special neural network structure mainly used to study temporal sequence-related problems. It has a tree-like hierarchical structure and can perform\nRE TR AC TE\nrecursive operations on the input information of network nodes in the order of their connection. RNN is a composite neural structure composed of multiple layers of neural structures, and each layer has the same neural structure. Its input is two child nodes (or more than one), and the output is the parent node generated by encoding these two child nodes. *e dimension of the parent node and each child node is the same data. After the input, the hidden neuron structure is repeated internally. *e input is not only the real-time data but also the forgetting state of the previous stage [23]. RNN can encode a tree or graph structure information as a vector, mapping the information into a semantic vector space. *is semantic vector space satisfies certain properties, such as semantically similar vectors being closer. *e research of RNN started in the 1980s and developed into one of the DL algorithms in the early 2000s. Among them, bidirectional RNN (Bi-RNN) and long shortterm memory (LSTM) networks are common RNN. *e structure of RNN is shown in Figure 2 [24]. In Figure 2, the RNN will have an input xt at every moment. *en, calculate the new state ht according to the state ht\u22121 at the previous moment and outputOt.*e current state ht of the RNN is jointly determined according to the state ht\u22121 at the previous moment and the current input xt. At the time t, the state ht\u22121 condenses the information of the previous sequence and is used as a reference for the output. Since the length of the sequence can be extended indefinitely, the h state with a limited dimension cannot save all the information of the sequence. *erefore, the model must learn to retain only the most important information related to the later tasks [25]. For any sequence time t, the hidden state ht is calculated by xt and ht\u22121, as shown in the following equation:\nht \ufffd f s t\u22121 , xt, \u03b8 . (5)\nIn equation (5), s is the internal state, f is the excitation function, and \u03b8 is the weight coefficient inside the cyclic unit. *e calculation of the output value Ot at time t is shown in the following equation:\nOt \ufffd Vht + c. (6)\nIn equation (6), V and c are weight coefficients.\n*ere are two ways to connect RNN: recurrent unitrecurrent unit connection and output node-recurrent unit connection.\n(1) Cyclic unit-cycle unit connection is also known as \u201chidden-hidden connection (HHC)\u201d or full connection. *e state of the current time step of each recurrent unit is determined by the input and the state of the previous time node, as shown in the following equation:\nht \ufffd f Uht\u22121 + Wxt + b( . (7)\nIn (7),U andW are the weights of the loop nodes, the former is called the state-state weight, and the latter is called the state-input weight. A bidirectional RNN (BRNN) can be obtained by stacking forward and reversing recurrent unit-recurrent unit connections.\n(2) Output node-cyclic unit connection: in this connection, the state of the recurrent unit is determined by the input of the time node and the output value of the previous time node [26], as shown in the following equation:\nht \ufffd f Uot\u22121 + Wxt + b.(  (8)\n2.2. Back Propagation through Time. Back propagation through time (BPTT) is an extension of the backpropagation algorithm combined with the RNN structure. *e cyclic structure is decomposed into a layer structure by expanding the RNN structure. Each layer structure is calculated according to the framework of RNN. According to the parameter sharing nature of RNN, the gradient of the weight is the sum of all layers [27]. *e loss function L operates as shown in the following equation:\nL \ufffd \u2212  \u03c4\nt\ufffd1 logp y\n(t) |x1, . . . , xt . (9)\n*e error E is shown in the following equation:\nE \ufffd 1 2 \nl\nk\ufffd1 dk \u2212 f netk(  \n2 . (10)\nRE TR\nAC\nTE D\nRNN works with serialized structured data by connecting neurons into strings of structures. Each neuron can use internal variables to hold input sequence data previously. *erefore, the whole sequence is compressed into an abstract representation. *e lower part of the data can be classified, or a new sequence can be generated according to this representation.*erefore, the RNN structure is often used to study time-related problems [28]. 2.3. RNN\u2019s Analysis of College Students\u2019 Network Moral Behavior. Data acquisition: this study used a questionnaire survey method to collect data. Undergraduate students in the Baoding city are surveyed on the online moral behavior of college students, supplemented by discussions, oral surveys, and online surveys. In order to make the survey results more representative, the survey subjects cover a wide range of subjects, and the subjects of the questionnaires cover liberal arts, science, engineering, medicine, art, and other disciplines. A total of 220 questionnaires are distributed in this survey. Two hundred five questionnaires are recovered, there are 200 valid questionnaires, and the effective recovery rate is 90.9%. *e details of the grade distribution of the survey respondents are shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3, in this valid questionnaire, there are 43 freshmen, 43 sophomores, 52 juniors, and 62 seniors. *e distribution of the surveyed subjects is uniform.*e subjects of the survey are shown in Figure 4.\nIn Figure 4, among the respondents of this valid questionnaire, there are 50 people in the liberal arts department, 42 people in the science department, 38 people in the medical department, 36 people in the art department, and 34 people in the engineering department. *e distribution of subjects is relatively even.\nA questionnaire on the Internet morality of college students is compiled, which went through the preliminary drafting of questions, multiple revisions, small-scale testing, reexamination, and final drafting to ensure the credibility and validity of the survey results. *ere are 33 questions in the questionnaire, and the content mainly includes four aspects: (1) the basic information of the respondents, such as\ngender, grade, age, school type, and discipline; (2) the specific characteristics of the respondents, such as Internet access time, location, the purpose of surfing the Internet, network media, and network behavior; (3) respondents\u2019 views on certain online ethical issues, such as online speech, online pornography, network security, and network hacking; (4) respondents\u2019 views on certain online moral issues; the knowledge of online moral education, such as the way to carry out online moral education, and the methods and suggestions for improving the level of online moral education.

However, only 14.8% of the students said that they are very interested in the online moral education carried out by the school. As high as 80.1% of the respondents said, they did not care about the online moral education courses carried out by schools. Even 5.1% of the students said that they hated online education courses. As a result of this polarization, the cybersecurity education courses carried out by colleges and universities will have a little effect, and the contradictory attitude towards cybersecurity education will also lead to the lack of cybersecurity education knowledge. *e situation of the respondents receiving the education on online moral behavior is investigated, as shown in Figure 7. In Figure 7, 18% of the respondents have received education on network ethics and security, 22.3% have only had access to the education on network security ethics, and 15.7% of the respondents have learned about relevant network security education norms. At present, the progress of China\u2019s cyber security ethics education is still relatively slow, and the proportion of educated people is relatively small.

            "text": "IPE has long dominated Chinese higher education. Under the background of the new era, it is necessary to do a good job in the online moral education of college students. In the process of online moral education for college students, not only the efforts of colleges and universities but also the joint efforts of the government and society are needed to gather forces from multiple parties to study the road of integration to further accelerate the process of college students\u2019 online moral education. Based on the development history of IPE, the online moral behavior of college students is analyzed and studied. *e innovation lies in the introduction of CNN, which is convenient for time-series data processing in the data analysis process to improve the accuracy of the output results and increase the objective credibility of the research. *e results show that 80.1% of the students do not care about the development of online moral education courses. Among them, 5.1% said they hated the course. *e proportion of students who understand or have received cybersecurity education is less than 20%. A considerable part of the subjects did not think that browsing pornographic websites, cyber-attacks, and human flesh searches were unreasonable. Almost all the subjects believed that their reallife behaviors differed from Internet behaviors. *is study investigates college students\u2019 perceptions of online ethics education. *e concept of online moral behavior and students\u2019 behavior is used to analyze and judge the current online moral behavior of college students and provide a certain reference for the subsequent research and analysis of online moral behavior education in colleges and universities. *e inadequacy lies in the fact that fewer objects are involved in the questionnaire survey, and the data selection range is small. *e conclusions of the experimental analysis are only applicable to college students in the surveyed area, and it remains to be further verified whether it is also applicable to other areas. Additionally, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research on whether there are differences in online moral behavior among students of different genders, ages, and majors."
