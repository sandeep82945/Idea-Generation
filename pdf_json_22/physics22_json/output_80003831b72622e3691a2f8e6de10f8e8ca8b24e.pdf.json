    "abstractText": "With the development of silicon photonics, dense photonic integrated circuits play a significant role in applications such as light detection and ranging systems, photonic computing accelerators, miniaturized spectrometers, and so on. Recently, extensive research work has been carried out on the phase shifter, which acts as the fundamental building block in the photonic integrated circuit. In this review, we overview different types of silicon photonic phase shifters, including micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), thermo-optics, and free-carrier depletion types, highlighting the MEMS-based ones. The major working principles of these phase shifters are introduced and analyzed. Additionally, the related works are summarized and compared. Moreover, some emerging applications utilizing phase shifters are introduced, such as neuromorphic computing systems, photonic accelerators, multi-purpose processing cores, etc. Finally, a discussion on each kind of phase shifter is given based on the figures of merit.",

            "text": "The past few decades have witnessed a huge growth in silicon photonics. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have been widely used and studied in areas such as telecommunications, lab-on-a-chip sensing, and quantum computing [1\u20137]. Benefitting from the broadband optical transparency (from 1.3 \u00b5m to 8 \u00b5m), high refractive index (n = 3.4757 at \u03bb = 1550 nm, room temperature), and compatible manufacturing process with matured complementary metal\u2013oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies [8\u201310], the silicon-oninsulator (SOI) substrate has become one of the most important platforms for on-chip PICs [11\u201313]. To meet the rapidly increasing demand for data communication, optical path routing, and optical signal modulation, passive and active optical components based on the SOI platform have been extensively studied in the past few decades [8\u201310,14\u201317]. Furthermore, the commercialization of silicon photonics has begun to take shape [18]. Some matured and advanced commercial foundries, such as the Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF) from Singapore, the American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics (AIM) from the United States, and the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC) from Belgium, have made great efforts and built promising PIC component libraries, including strip and rib waveguide, power splitter, grating coupler, waveguide crossing, directional coupler, micro-ring resonator, thermal-optical phase shifter, and so on. With intensive efforts, the propagation loss of silicon wire waveguide has been reduced to below 1.0 dB/cm by researchers, which paves the way to build large-scale PIC applications [19]. Moreover, packaging technology has been extensively explored [20\u201323], which leads to a high-level chip-scale integration including on-chip components such as photodetector (PD), modulator, laser source, and fiber-to-chip coupler. With the development of dense PICs, effective and high-performance on-chip active components are urgently needed to realize complex on-chip functions. Phase shifters are\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1509. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13091509 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1509 2 of 24\none of the most important components in building PICs. A building block that offers two inputs and two outputs capable of power tuning and phase shifting can be considered a fundamental unit in large-scale PICs [24]. The phase shifter here refers to modulating the phase of the transmission wave only without changing the amplitude, where the power tuning function can be obtained by forming the interferometer based on phase shifters. Using enough amounts of such building blocks, an arbitrary linear optical system can be built. Using well-integrated phase shifters, researchers have reported various applications such as neuromorphic computing systems [25,26], optical phased arrays [27\u201330], light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems [31,32], on-chip spectrometers [33\u201335], photonic accelerators [26,36,37], and so on. In this review paper, we focus on the recent progress of phase shifters on the SOI platform. For silicon photonics, phase shifting mechanisms are mainly based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), thermo-optics effects, and free-carrier-dispersion effects, to name a few (see Figure 1). MEMS is an effective modulation mechanism with low power consumption and optical insertion loss [38]. Its modulation speed is commonly limited by mechanical frequency. The thermo-optic mechanism could be realized by a simple fabrication process. Its moderate modulation efficiency and low insertion loss are preferred [39]. Considering the further dense integration, its heat dissipation and thermal crosstalk should be well engineered. In addition, a fast and effective phase shifter can be obtained using the free-carrier-dispersion mechanism, where the optical loss induced by the free-carrier absorption should be well controlled to scale it up [14]. On the other hand, due to the lack of second-order nonlinearity, common silicon-based materials usually exhibit negligible electro-optic (EO) effects. Silicon-based modulators that utilize EO effects require heterogeneous integration of other materials, such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3), graphene, etc. [40,41].\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 25 With the development of dense PICs, effective and high-performance on-chip active components are urgently needed to realize complex on-chip functions.

It modulates the optical mode in the waveguide to realize a variety of functions by MEMS actuation. This technology has flourished in the past few decades with the development of advanced silicon micro- and nano-fabrication technologies, and its applications have gradually evolved from free-space optics such as digital micromirror devices (DMD) to on-chip PICs [47,48]. Due to the excellent optical and mechanical properties of silicon, such as low optical absorption loss, low cost, matured fabrication technologies, reliable mechanical properties, and excellent ability to integrate electronic functions, the SOI substrate has become one of the most important platforms for on-chip MEMS applications. The driving mechanisms include electrostatic actuation, electrothermal actuation, piezoelectric actuation, and so on. The MEMS-based phase shifter has attracted tremendous attention from worldwide researchers in academia and industry due to its high modulation efficiency, ultra-low power consumption, small footprint, and low insertion loss. In this section, we first introduce the figures of merit (FOMs) that are used to evaluate the MEMS-based phase shifter and discuss the outstanding works so far according to these FOMs.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1509 4 of 24"

Half-Wave Voltage Length Product (V\u03c0 \u00b7L\u03c0)\nMEMS-based phase shifters are mainly driven by electrostatic actuation; hence, a potential difference needs to be applied between the movable and rigid parts. V\u03c0 \u00b7L\u03c0 refers to the voltage that needs to be applied on the phase shifter of length L\u03c0 to achieve \u03c0 phase shift, which indicates the modulation efficiency and footprint of the device. By embedding a phase shifter into one arm of the MZI, V\u03c0 can be obtained by measuring the DC voltage required to modulate the MZI transmission at an exact wavelength from minimum to maximum. Thus, a smaller V\u03c0 \u00b7L\u03c0 indicates a higher efficiency for phase shift.\n3.1.2. Insertion Loss (IL)\nMEMS-based phase shifters usually modify or perturb the optical mode in the waveguide, which inevitably has an impact on the optical transmission. Therefore, the insertion loss here not only refers to the initial insertion loss in the unactuated state but also includes the extra loss induced by MEMS actuation. For MEMS-based phase shifters driven by electrostatic actuation or electrothermal actuation, oxide-to-air transition loss happening in the rigid-to-movable region is another source, while piezoelectric actuation method does not suffer from this loss since the entire phase shifter area is wrapped in cladding material [49\u201351]. Additionally, in some cases, mode conversion is involved, such as ridge-to-slot transition, which induces extra loss. For phase shifters embedded in an imbalanced MZI, the power imbalance between two branches of the MZI can be extracted by fitting the measured MZI transmission spectrum to the theoretical one [52].\n3.1.3. Response Time\nAs the dynamic response of the MEMS-based phase shifter is determined by its mechanical structure, mechanical frequency should be measured to evaluate its response time. The 3 dB cutoff bandwidth refers to the frequency of the dynamically modulated signal (AC voltage) applied when the modulated power amplitude variation of MZI is decreased by 3 dB. The mechanical resonant frequency (f ) can be extracted from the 3 dB measurements, and the response time can be estimated to be 1/f. Specifically, the response time can be read from the optical output rise and fall time by applying a square wave modulated voltage signal."

Figure 2a,b shows the modulation mechanisms by perturbing the evanescent field of the optical mode in the bus waveguide through a mechanical beam with mode cut-off dimensions. Figure 2c,d shows the modulation mechanism by directly modifying the optical mode field distribution in the waveguide. The modulation mechanism shown in Figure 2e,f is to modulate the optical path length.\n3.2.1. Evanescent Field Perturbation\nThis type of phase shifter changes the effective refractive index of the optical mode by perturbing its evanescent field. The relevant working principles are shown in Figure 2a,b. The perturbation structure was designed to avoid mode coupling or leaking from the waveguide. In 2016, Pruessner et al. proposed a three-dimensional phase shifter configuration utilizing one silicon nitride bridge placed above the bus waveguide to perturb its optical evanescent field (Figure 3a,b) [53]. The 120 \u00b5m long phase shifter achieved \u03c0 phase shift under 3.8 V applied voltage and 2\u03c0 phase shift under 4.2 V applied voltage. However, the over-perturbation by the silicon nitride beam and the gold layer coated on it may induce large extra loss during modulation (1.5 dB extra loss after 2p phase shift). To overcome this limitation, the authors proposed to modulate the phase shifter through gradient electric fields instead and increased the initial gap between the silicon nitride\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1509 5 of 24\nbeam without the gold layer and the bus waveguide. In this case, the 100 \u00b5m long phase shifter realized p phase shift with 33 V applied voltage, and the extra loss was reduced to 0.04 dB.

            "text": "The working principle of the thermo-optics phase shifter is to change the refractive index of the waveguide and cladding material by injecting a current into a resistive heater along them, thereby changing the effective refractive index of the optical mode. The relationship between the phase change and the temperature change is given as [39]:\n\u2206\u03d5(\u2206T) = 2\u03c0 \u03bb ( dn dT ) e f f \u2206TL (4)\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, and (\ndn dT ) e f f is the change in the effective refractive index of the\ntransmission mode versus the change in temperature. This coefficient is not only affected by the change in the refractive index of silicon, but also the change in the refractive index of the surrounding claddings (e.g., silicon dioxide, silicon nitride). \u2206T is the change in the temperature, and L is the length of the heating waveguide region.\nAccording to Equation (4), the required temperature change to achieve p phase shift is:\n\u2206T\u03c0 = \u03bb 2 \u00b7 L \u00b7 (\ndn dT ) e f f\n(5)\nThus, one of the FOMs, the power consumption, can be approximately given by [67]:\n\u2206P\u03c0 = \u2206T\u03c0 \u00b7 G (6)\nwhere G is the thermal conductance between the heated waveguide and the heat sink in a unit of W/K. Two other important figures of merit are the propagation loss of the waveguide and the modulation speed. The modulation speed can be evaluated by a time constant, which is determined by [67]:\n\u03c4 = H G\n(7)\nwhere H is the heat capacity of the heated arm. The gap of finite thermal conductance between the heat source and the waveguide is not considered in the above equations. A common configuration of the thermo-optics phase shifter is shown in Figure 6a. The silicon waveguide is patterned in the cladding and a heater is placed above the waveguide. It is noted that the vertical gap between the heater and waveguide should be kept large enough to avoid excessive optical insertion loss. Hence, an upper cladding is usually grown and covers the silicon waveguide to isolate and support the metal heater. While designing a thermo-optics phase shifter, the width of the silicon, and the thickness and type of the cladding and heater must be carefully designed. The steady-state heat distribution for a conventional thermo-optics phase shifter with different kinds of claddings is shown in Figure 7a [68]. Based on the traditional thermo-optics phase shifter, many research efforts have focused on optimization targeting the power consumption, modulation speed, and insertion loss, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 6b achieves thermal insulation between the silicon waveguide and the claddings and substrate layer by processing a free-standing waveguide to improve power consumption.

            "text": "4.2.1. Toward Low Power Consumption\nOne of the approaches towards a low-power-consumption thermo-optics phase shifter is to reduce the waste heat to the surrounding material other than the waveguide itself. Sun et al. proposed a 100 \u00b5m long free-standing waveguide thermo-optics phase shifter with a Pp of 540 \u00b5W, as shown in Figure 7b [70]. The insertion loss for an MZI switch that\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1509 11 of 24\ncontains two proposed phase shifters was measured as 2.8 dB. However, the modulation speed degraded to less than 10 kHz due to slower heat dissipation. Instead of reducing the heat dissipation, one can take advantage of power multiplexing to improve it. Benefitting from the spiral waveguide photonic structure, the heat generated by heaters can be absorbed almost entirely by the optical waveguide. While designing the layout of spiral waveguide, some interesting and effective methods were proposed to reduce the device propagation loss. Qiu et al. proposed to set the adjacent waveguide widths as different to reduce coupling loss and an offset at the connection part between the bending waveguide and the straight waveguide reduce mode mismatch (Figure 7c) [71]. The insertion loss for the phase shifters decreased from 1.9 dB to 0.9 dB after these optimizations, and power consumption reduced to 3 mW without sacrificing modulation speed (a modulation bandwidth of 39 kHz). The third optimizing strategy is reducing the gap between the heater and the waveguide. A metal heater with smaller gap between the bus waveguide will improve power consumption and modulation speed while inducing a larger scattering loss. To solve this problem, some optical transparent materials with relatively high electric resistance were utilized, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and graphene [68]. Yan et al. utilized a slowlight-enhanced silicon photonic crystal waveguide with graphene heaters deposited on it (Figure 7d) [69]. A tuning efficiency of 1.07 nm/mW and power consumption per free spectral range of 3.99 mW/FSR were achieved. The response time 750 ns was obtained. In addition to the optimization of heating efficiency, the phase shifter could be advanced by multi-mode waveguide circuit design. Miller et al. proposed a method which used multiple direction coupler mode converters to route the multi-mode optical wave propagation [72]. The proposed approach effectively increased the heating optical path length by letting optical wave multi-pass the phase shift region, thus improving the modulation efficiency and reducing the power consumption (Figure 7e). By utilizing six mode converters, an 8-fold longer optical path extension could be achieved. They demonstrated only 1.7 mW Pp with a modulation speed of 6.5 \u00b5s. Compared with the widely adopted ring resonator type of phase shifter, the proposed approach could have a superior working bandwidth with the optical path extension. The insertion loss reached up to 6 dB due to the cascading of multiple mode converters and could be improved by optimizing the optical structure and fabrication process.\n4.2.2. Toward Low Loss and High Modulation Speed\nA suitable balance between modulation speed, power consumption, and propagation loss could be achieved by doping the same carrier on both sides of the waveguide. The heat is generated by applying a continuous current to the doped part, and its steady-state heat distribution is shown in Figure 8a [67]. A 357 kHz modulation bandwidth could be achieved by improving the proximity of the heat source and the waveguide [73]. A more compact design decreased the heated arm heat capacity H and the time constant \u03c4. At the same time, by carefully designing the doping silicon distribution, the insertion loss of the phase shifter could be significantly reduced to 0.23 dB for a 61.6 \u00b5m long phase shifter [74]. Some typical thermo-optics phase shifters based on doping silicon heaters are shown in Figure 8b,c [75]."

Compared with the phase shifter without air trenches, the one with air trenches shows much less power consumption but has a slower modulation speed. While designing and using a thermo-optics phase shifter, a trade-off between power consumption and modulation speed is an important factor for researchers to consider, as thermal inductance has opposite effects on these two FOMs. Thus, a composite FOM P\u03c0 \u00b7\u03c4 is widely used to characterize a thermo-optics phase shifter that relies on the designed thermal inductance.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1509 12 of 24\n2\nIn addition to the structure of the thermo-optics phase shifter, the type of heater is also a factor to consider. Commonly used heaters include metal, which is placed on top of the bus waveguide, and a doped-silicon resistor, which is placed on both sides of the bus waveguide. According to the experimental results of thermo-optics phase shifters with different types of heaters processed in the commercial foundries IMEC and AMF, phase shifters with metal heaters and doped-silicon heaters show similar modulation efficiencies, while the modulation speed of doped-silicon-based phase shifters is faster but has a larger footprint [67,76]. Besides benefitting from the excellent optical properties and high electric resistance, optical transparent materials such as graphene and ITO are also favorable candidates for heater materials. Even with a moderate modulation speed, the thermo-optics phase shifter is widely preferred in silicon photonics due to its high modulation efficiency and easily access from commercial foundries. Considering a densely integrated on-chip system, a thermo-optics phase shifter requires not only a calibration of the initial state, but also avoiding thermal crosstalk by planning the layout. Random phase noise is another factor that needs to be considered in some exact applications. Song et al. demonstrated a 2 \u00b5m width silicon photonic thermo-optics phase shifter with a TiN heater, which reduced the normalized phase error to 1e-3 \u03c0/nm [77].\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1509 13 of 24"

            "text": "The modulation efficiency of EO modulation directly on the silicon material is very low due to the weak second-order nonlinearity of silicon itself [104]. Benefitting from the high birefringence, liquid crystal material (e.g., E7 liquid crystal mixture) is a promising candidate to achieve EO modulation by injecting it above the silicon waveguide as cladding [105]. When no external electric field is applied, the director (the average orientation of the molecules) of the liquid crystal is parallel to the waveguide. In contrast, the director rotates, and its orientation becomes perpendicular to the waveguide while applying a sufficient large electric field. During the rotation process, the waveguide mode neff is modulated, thus changing the phase of the transmission wave. The commonly used waveguide platforms for liquid crystal-based phase shifters include strip waveguide platform and slot waveguide platform. Strip waveguide is easy to process, and the propagation loss can be maintained at a very low level. However, its modulation efficiency is relatively low due to the less evanescent field overlap with the liquid crystal claddings. On the other hand, a large portion of the optical field of slot mode is confined in the slot structure, which indicates large overlap between the optical field and liquid crystal claddings. In this case, the modulation efficiency is much larger and a larger propagation loss is induced. Some promising works about liquid crystal-based phase shifters were proposed [106\u2013109].

The amorphous state of GST material could be highly transitive and electrically conductive. On the other hand, the crystalline state of GST material causes large optical absorption and is electrically resistive. The transition between these two states is generally achieved through heating, and optical or electric pulses usually act as external stimuli to heat the material. Furthermore, the GST material is widely used in all-optical photonic computing systems as the weight module due to its optical controllability and non-volatile nature. Some applications based on the GST materials are discussed in the Section 7."

Photonic Accelerator\nMatrix multiplication is one of the most basic and important calculations in traditional computing architectures, especially in the field of neural networks and deep learning. In the process of deep learning, the weight matrix is fixed after training, and nonlinear operations are often performed. Considering that, all-optical computing could be a valuable solution for neural networks. In the all-optical neural network, the weights are implemented either by modulating the splitting ratio of the MZI through a phase modulator, or directly by changing the optical absorption rate of the PCM material. Shen et al. proposed an optical implementation of matrix multiplication using the MZI optical coherence module (Figure 10c) [124]. Before the signal was input into the optical neural networks (ONN), the authors preprocessed the input signals into a high-dimensional vector, and then encoded them into pulse signals of different amplitudes. Each layer of ONN contains an optical interference unit (OIU) to represent matrix multiplication and an optical nonlinearity unit (ONU) to implement nonlinear activation functions. In the experimental setup, the OIU is implemented by 56 MZIs, each containing a thermo-optics phase shifter. The function of\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1509 18 of 24\nthe phase shifter is to change the splitting ratio of the MZI to route the optical signal and implement matrix multiplication. One more thermo-optics phase shifter was patterned on the output of the MZI to control the differential output phase. The authors then built an ONN containing four layers of OIUs with four neurons in each layer and showed acceptable performance (76.7% accuracy) in vowel recognition. In addition, Feldmann et al. realized the parallel computing of matrix multiplication by combining PCM and optical frequency, which greatly improved the operation speed (Figure 10d) [36]. Zhang et al. utilized the MZI coherence and achieved complex-value calculation through optical neural networks (Figure 10e) [125]. Some promising works such as logic gate realization, classification tasks, and handwriting recognition were proposed."

Trade-off between each FOM is the key in designing individual devices and selecting an appropriate phase shifter in a complicated system. It is hard to improve all FOMs simultaneously. The mechanical dimensions of the MEMS actuator have opposite effects on the applied voltage and modulation speed, while the initial position of the MEMS actuator affects the (dynamic) insertion loss and modulation efficiency. For thermo-optics phase shifters, a balance between the modulation efficiency and modulation speed needs to be determined according to the applications, and footprint and thermal crosstalk are sometimes important considerations. For free-carrier-depletion-based phase shifters, the free-carrier concentration and distribution affect the modulation efficiency, insertion loss, and modulation speed simultaneously. On the other hand, these three kinds of phase shifters complement each other from the perspective of the application. The free-carrier-dispersion-based phase shifter is widely used in applications requiring high-speed phase modulation, such as telecommunications. However, it has the inherent disadvantage of relatively large dynamic insertion loss. The thermo-optics-based phase shifters offer efficient and stable phase modulation without dynamic insertion loss. However, the layout of the thermo-optics phase shifters must be carefully designed in large-scale PICs due to the limitation of large power consumption and thermal crosstalk. MEMS-based phase shifters appeared around two decades ago and had major developments in the past five years. Benefitting from its extremely low power consumption and no thermal crosstalk, MEMS-based phase shifters show significant potential for the future dense PIC applications. Nevertheless, due to the fatigue and other failure risks of non-solid-state systems, the packaging and long-term stability of MEMS-based phase shifters are still worth investigating.
