Chromatographic fractionation of a methanol extract of Helichrysum rutilans afforded seven known compounds. The isolated compounds were identified as 5,7,8-trihydroxy-3,6-dimethoxyflavone8-O-2-methyl-2-butanoate (C-1), 5,7-dihydroxy-3,6,8-trimethoxyflavone (C-2), 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8-tetramethoxyflavone (C-3), 5-hydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (C-4), ent-kaurenoic acid (C-5), ent-kauran-18-al (C-6), and 15-α-hydroxy-(-)-ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid (C-7). Compounds C-1–C-4 demonstrated high antioxidant capacities on ORAC hydroxyl radical (2.114 ± 4.01; 2.413 ± 6.20; 1.924 ± 16.40; 1.917 ± 3.91) × 106; ORAC peroxyl radical (3.523± 3.22; 2.935± 0.13; 2.431± 8.63; 2.814± 5.20)× 103 μMTE/g; and FRAP (1251.45 ± 4.18; 1402.62 ± 5.77) μMAAE/g, respectively. Moderate inhibitory activities against Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation were observed for C-1–C-4 as IC50 values of 13.123± 0.34, 16.421 ± 0.92, 11.64 ± 1.72, 14.90 ± 0.06 μg/mL, respectively, while their respective anti-tyrosinase activities with IC50 values of 25.735 ± 9.62, 24.062 ± 0.61, 39.03 ± 13.12, 37.67 ± 0.98 μg/mL were also observed. All compounds demonstrated TEAC values within the range of 1105–1424 μMTE/g. The result is an indication that a methanol extract of H. rutilans might possibly be a good source of natural antioxidants against ailments caused by cellular oxidative stress and as inhibitors against skin depigmentation, as well as possible raw materials needed for slowing down perishable agricultural products. This is the first report on the phytochemical and biological evaluation of H. rutilans. 1. conclusions As skin biochemistry and skin aging are very complex processes, it is not surprising that ongoing research efforts are aimed at uncovering more natural phytochemicals that can slow down the detrimental effects of noxious substances, including free radicals produced in the skin. Seven known compounds were isolated and characterized by our previous analytical tools. Flavones have been shown to possess good antioxidant activity and have been implicated as inhibitors of lipid peroxidation. The evidence presented from this study suggests that a dietary intake of flavonoid-containing foods may be of benefit in lowering the risk of certain pathophysiologies associated with free radical-mediated events. This in vitro study showed that a methanol extract of H. rutilans can be considered a good antioxidant and skin depigmentation option for the relevant industries. Results from the current study present the first report to be documented on H. rutilans, a widespread plant in the coastal parts of the western and mountainous parts of the eastern provinces in South Africa.
