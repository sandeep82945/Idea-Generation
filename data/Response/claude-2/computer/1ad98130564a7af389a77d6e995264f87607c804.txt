 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate different architectures for fusing handcrafted and CNN features, such as multi-stream or cascaded networks, to further improve segmentation performance. The optimal fusion strategy could be task-specific.

2. Incorporate attention mechanisms into the hybrid architecture to help the model focus on the most salient features and regions for segmentation. Attention could enhance the contextual reasoning of the model.

3. Explore the integration of other traditional feature extraction techniques, such as graph-based methods or shape models, to provide additional complementary information to the CNN.

4. Develop semi-supervised or weakly-supervised training methods to reduce reliance on large annotated datasets. This could involve leveraging unlabeled data or scarce annotations more efficiently.

5. Validate the hybrid approach on diverse clinical datasets, with varying imaging protocols, scanners, and populations. Assess generalization ability to real-world conditions.
