    "abstractText": "The impact of psychosocial factors on increasing the risk of HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) has attracted increasing attention. We aimed to develop and validate an integrated prediction model, especially incorporating emerging psychosocial variables, for predicting the risk of HIV infection among MSM. We surveyed and collected sociodemographic, psychosocial, and behavioral information from 547 MSM in China. The participants were split into a training set and a testing set in a 3:1 theoretical ratio. The prediction model was constructed by introducing the important variables selected with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, applying multivariate logistic regression, and visually assessing the risk of HIV infection through the nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, calibration plots, Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test and population stability index (PSI) were performed to test validity and stability of the model. Four of the 15 selected variables\u2014unprotected anal intercourse, multiple sexual partners, involuntary subordination and drug use before sex\u2014were included in the prediction model. The results indicated that the comprehensive prediction model we developed had relatively good predictive performance and stability in identifying MSM at high-risk for HIV infection, thus providing targeted interventions for high-risk MSM.",

            "text": "In 2020, there are 38 million people living with HIV worldwide, thus making HIV infection one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for an integral part of new HIV infections, which has posed an unprecedented challenge to global HIV prevention and control [1]. In China, MSM also constitute a key population at high risk of HIV infection. The risk factors of HIV infection in MSM identified by current research mainly include sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychosocial aspects, such as sex, age, unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), multiple sexual partners (MSP), alcohol and drug use before sex and depression [2,3]. Given the variety of risk factors of HIV infection among MSM, identifying MSM at greatest risk for HIV infection by using predictive models could facilitate targeted prevention interventions specific to this population, while permitting more focused delivery of prevention resources. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the risk of HIV infection in a more holistic perspective for early targeted screening and prevention among MSM.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1010. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19021010 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1010 2 of 14\nSince sexual behavior is considered as the main way of HIV transmission and infection among MSM, most HIV prevention interventions have focused on directly reducing unprotected sexual behavior, while neglecting the impact of psychological factors related to HIV infection. As a sexual minority group, the MSM is subject to stigma, discrimination, and isolation from society, which in turn causes a range of defensive social mentality encompassing cognition, feelings and behaviors, and ultimately contributes to various psychosocial problems [4,5]. The resulting psychosocial problems may lead to high-risk behaviors-such as UAI and MSP, which might provide immediately physical or emotional gratification but could increase the risk of HIV transmission and infection in the long run. Considering the characteristics of MSM and the surrounding social environment, involuntary subordination, sexual impulsivity and social support are emerging as new public health concerns among MSM [6\u20138]. Involuntary subordination (IS) is a mechanism adapted by humans for competing resources that switch off fighting behaviors when a losing organism cannot struggle anymore (thus saving the organism from injury) [9]. Individuals with high levels of IS are more difficult to accept defeat or escape from a defeated situation, and then give up resistance or abandon themselves. This possibly makes MSM vulnerable to HIV infection. However, there are few studies focused on direct relationship between involuntary subordination and HIV infection among MSM. Recently, a cross-section study revealed that high level of IS was associated with multiple sexual partners [10]. As we all know, multiple sexual partners, as a sexual risk behavior, may increase the risk of HIV infection. Therefore, we speculate that IS, as a psychosocial variable associated with sexual behavior, may be a significant predictor of HIV infection among MSM. Sexual compulsivity (SC) is a trait characterized by sexual fantasies and behaviors that increase in intensity and frequency over time and, therefore, interfere with personal, interpersonal, or career pursuits [11,12]. Compared with MSM lacking this characteristic, MSM with sexual impulsivity experienced a higher incidence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections [13]. The MSM engaging in compulsive sexual behavior may also partly stem from the pressures and stigma they feel as a sexual minority. In addition, some evidence suggested that high levels of social support were associated with decreased likelihood of engaging in sexual risk behaviors [14\u201317]. Therefore, social support that can provide emotional and material resources to MSM could help reduce the risk of HIV infection [18,19]. In summary, especially among MSM, multidimensional factors, particularly emerging psychosocial factors, need to be considered in predicting the risk of HIV infection. There are many studies at home and abroad that have developed HIV infection risk assessment tools targeting MSM, including the Menza score [20], the Denver score [21], and the San Diego Early Test score [22]. In addition, prediction models specific to Chinese MSM have been developed to estimate HIV infection risk [23,24]. However, all the models mentioned above included only socio-demographic and behavioral factors, not psychosocial factors, thus could not comprehensively predict the risk of HIV infection among MSM. To our knowledge, there are few studies using machine learning methods to construct multidimensional HIV infection prediction models that include emerging psychosocial variables. In this study, we aimed to establish and validate an integrated HIV infection risk assessment tool that incorporated variables selected from demographic, psychosocial and behavioral factors using machine learning approach, and inform targeted interventions in MSM."

Anonymous face-to-face interviews were carried out between our outreach workers and the participating MSM. Participants were briefed about the study in detail. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants before the interview. Interviewers were requested to sign\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

We made sure that, in the whole process of dealing with our participants, we strictly complied with American Psychological Association ethical standards. The recruitment procedure and the design of this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\n2.3. Measurement 2.3.1. Socio-Demographic Variables\nSocio-demographic information collected included age, income, current marital status, employment status, education level, registered residence status, self-reported sexual orientation.\n2.3.2. Psychosocial Variables Involuntary Subordination\nInvoluntary subordination was measured using the 32-item, 5-point Likert-type Involuntary Subordination Questionnaire [9]. Answers were rated ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) where a higher total score indicates a higher level of involuntary subordination (Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient = 0.883; range 35\u2013136).\nSexual Compulsivity\nThe 10-item Likert-type Sexual Compulsivity Scale was applied to measure individual\u2019s out-of\u2013control sexual thoughts and behaviors [25]. Answers were rated ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), with a higher total score indicating higher sexual compulsivity (Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient = 0.854; range 10\u201340).\nSocial Support\nWe employed the Multiple Scales of Perceived Social Support to assess subjectively recognized social support from family, friends, and significant others [26,27]. The scale is a 7-point Likert scale with 12 items, ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree). A higher total score indicated higher social support (Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient = 0.932; range 18\u201384).\n2.3.3. Behavioral Variables Multiple Sexual Partners\nWe asked participants \u201cHow many male sexual partners have you had anal sex with in the past 6 months?\u201d. The options included \u201conly one\u201d, \u201ctwo\u201d, \u201cthree\u201d, \u201cfour\u201d, and \u201cfive or more\u201d. We classified those who answer this question with more than one male partner as having existing MSP.\nUnprotected Anal Intercourse\nParticipants were asked about the frequency of condoms use when they had sex with any male partner in the past 6 months. Responses were rated ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (every time). Unless the answer was \u201cevery time\u201d, they were described as \u201cengaging in UAI\u201d.\nAlcohol Use before Sex\nWe measured drug use by asking the participants whether they had drinks before sex. Those without a \u201cnever\u201d answer was regarded as groups who drink before sex.\nDrug use before Sex\nWe measured drug use by asking the participants whether they had used any drugs including ecstasy (3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine), crystal meth (methamphetamine), marijuana, cocaine, and others. Those without a \u201cnever\u201d answer was regarded as groups who use drugs before sex.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1010 5 of 14\nVoluntary HIV Counseling and Testing (VCT)\nParticipants were asked if they had voluntarily received HIV counseling and testing in the past six months, and participant\u2019s blood samples were voluntarily drawn and tested for HIV infection. Then, they were privately informed of their serostatus. If participants have a positive result, they are referred to a local hospital specializing in HIV/AIDS treatment."

            "text": "The 547 participants were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set for internal validation at the theoretical ratio of 3:1 [28,29]. The data from the training and testing sets were guaranteed not to be replaced during the analysis, thus improving the reliability and robustness of the study findings. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages and continuous variables are described as mean and SD (normal distribution) or median and quartile (non-normal distribution). Chi-square test, corrected Chi-square test, and Fisher exact test were used to assess differences in categorical variables between training and testing set. Differences in continuous variables between the training and testing set were evaluated using Unpaired t test (normal distribution) and Mann\u2013Whitney U test (non-normal distribution). Previous studies have shown that least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis outperformed several other machine learning approaches [30\u201332]. Therefore, LASSO was adopted to reduce the data dimension of the training set and to pick out the most influential and optimal factors for the predictive model. LASSO regression analysis minimizes the prediction error of continuous dependent variables by imposing constraints on the model parameters that causes the regression coefficients of certain predictor variables to shrink to zero. Variables with non-zero regression coefficients are considered risk factors that are strongly correlated with the response variable. On the contrary, predictor variables with regression coefficients equal to zero after the contraction process are excluded from the model. The 10-fold cross-validation solves the problem of overfitting variables and multicollinearity during model extrapolation by centralizing and standardizing the included variables for optimizing lambda. After the risk factors were identified by LASSO regression analysis, a prediction model was constructed by using multiple logistic regression analysis on the training set, which was presented in the form of a nomogram. Then, a predictive nomogram based on identified risk factors was established as a tool to assess HIV infection risk visually and quantitatively among MSM. The discrimination, calibration and stability of the HIV infection risk nomogram were thoroughly assessed based on the training set and the testing set, respectively. Discrimination of nomogram was quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K-S) test. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used to assess the agreement between the predicted and actual probabilities of HIV infection risk and higher K-S values indicating greater ability of the model to discriminate the samples. It is generally considered that K-S > 0.2 denotes a strong risk differentiation ability of the model developed in the study. The calibration plots and Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test were used to evaluate the calibration of prediction model. Internal and external consistency of the discrimination and calibration performance were measured using bootstrap resampling procedure. In addition, population stability index (PSI) was introduced to monitor model stability by assessing the degree of population bias based on the difference between the expected distribution of the training sample and the actual distribution of the test sample. Lower PSI means smaller difference between the two datasets and better stability of the model, and generally considered as PSI between 0 and 0.1, indicating no significant population bias and excellent stability of the model. All analyses were conducted with R statistical software (version 3.6.1) equipped with the \u201ccaret\u201d, \u201cglmnet\u201d, \u201crms\u201d, \u201crmda\u201d packages. All tests were two-sided and p \u2264 0.05 was set as the level of significant difference.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1010 6 of 14"

Discussion Our study identified four risk factors of HIV infection in MSM from 15 sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychosocial predictors based on LASSO regression, including UAI, MSP, IS, and drug use before sex. We constructed a predictive model that incorporated the above risk factors of HIV infection in MSM, and further developed and validated a HIV infection risk nomogram. The nomogram we developed targeted at MSM has moderate predictive discrimination and calibration in the training set. In addition, the lower PSI also confirmed the relatively good stability of the prediction model. Finally, the internal validation of the nomogram supported its good predictive performance and accuracy in predicting HIV infection risk among MSM.\n4.1. Association of UAI and MSP with HIV Infection among MSM UAI and MSP were well-known as the main routes of HIV infection in MSM [33,34]. From adolescents to older men, UAI remained common and put MSM of all ages at higher risk for acquiring and infecting HIV [35\u201337]. In addition to UAI, the mean number of total sexual partners in MSM had increased significantly in recent years, and MSP was emerging as a high-risk factor for HIV infection [38]. Some studies provided further evidence that unprotected sexual behaviors with multiple sexual partners expedited HIV transmission among HIV-positive MSM [39,40]. Our study also confirmed that UAI and MSP were both independent predictors for HIV infection among MSM. However, the above two predictors were not the main HIV infection contributors in this nomogram, which may be related to the duration of the survey regarding previous sexual behavior. It is difficult to assess the impact of high-risk sexual behavior on HIV infection during the lifetime of MSM in cross-sectional studies; therefore, most cross-sectional studies generally investigate short-term (usually the past six months) high-risk sexual behavior among MSM.\nFigure 7.

Previous studies have also reported that drug use was associated with high HIV infection risk [41,42]. This relationship is postulated to be attributed to the acute effects\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1010 11 of 14\nof drug use that can enhance sexual desire and increase intoxicating highs, thus stimulating risk-taking sexual behaviors, such as UAI, MSP [43,44]. In addition to illegal drugs, some popular recreational drugs that but not defined as illegal, such as rush poppers and erectile dysfunction medications, have similarly been confirmed to play a role in increasing rates of sexual risk behavior and HIV infection [45\u201348]. Furthermore, several epidemiological studies have also shown a positive dose\u2013response relationship between frequency and number of drugs used or polydrug use and HIV risk to support our findings [49\u201351]."

            "text": "Interestingly, our study found the risky role of involuntary subordination in HIV infection among MSM. As far as we know, we were the first to reveal this direct association between involuntary subordination and HIV infection risk among Chinese MSM. We confirmed that the higher the level of IS, the greater the risk of HIV infection. This may be explained by the fact that MSM suffered more discrimination, isolation, and stress than heterosexuals, thus making MSM more prone to feel stuck and low perception (poor social comparison), give up resistance, and abandon themselves when confronted with adversity, eventually resulting in risky sexual behavior [10] and mental disorder such as anxiety and depression [8]. Recently, some studies also confirmed that involuntary subordination fully mediated the relationship between self-esteem and depression among MSM [52,53]. In addition, IS was found to be associated with neediness [9] and dependency [54], which was also compatible with the characteristics of sexual minorities compared to heterosexuals. Currently, the concept of IS was expanded into a range of interconnected feelings and perceptions, including submissive behaviors, entrapment, social defeat and poor social comparison, which may stimulate multiple risk pathways that synergistically increase the risk of HIV infection, thus partly explaining the higher contribution of IS in the nomogram. This finding could inform future research, especially when additional mental health variables are available for predictive purposes. More research is needed to focus on the potential impact of involuntary subordination on HIV infection and provide further insights into the unclear causal relationship between IS and HIV infection."

            "text": "There were several limitations to this study. Firstly, since this study was a crosssectional study, the ability to infer causality from these findings was insufficient. Secondly, participants\u2019 responses might not be completely honest because sexual-related questions are relatively private in China and the questionnaire in our study was completed through face-to-face interviews. Therefore, it was inevitable to generate biases from the self-reported data collected. Finally, given the difficulty of including all psychosocial and behavioral factors that may be associated with HIV infection in the model, large prospective cohort studies containing more comprehensive variables are needed in the future to further expand the applicability of this HIV infection risk assessment tool."
