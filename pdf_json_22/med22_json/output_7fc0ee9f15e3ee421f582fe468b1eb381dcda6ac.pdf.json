    "abstractText": "Education, teaching, and learning topics, known to have gained an international dimension with technological developments, are still seen as the most discussed themes and subject to change. It is clear that in the 21st century, the increasing information density, the means of transfer, and the technological adaptation skills of the teacher and the learner are at the forefront, and more efforts are required to develop them. The integration of technologies in education and training is related to the necessity of preparing learners in the most suitable way for future work and lifelong learning within the information society. For this reason, for the COVID-19 pandemic process and thereafter, starting with known education models makes it necessary to enable the development of education, teaching, and learning under better conditions and situations by blending them with technological developments. Everyone has understood the ever-changing and developing universal digital world much better during this pandemic. The 7E model of the Constructivist Learning Theory (CLT), known as the student-centered model based on distance education, has been mandatory for the entire education community during the first global pandemic of the digital age. Augmented Reality (AR) is another web-based technological development that can work in harmony with the 7E model. In the 7E model, the teaching of the lessons was at the forefront since the learners learn by doing, experiencing, and applying, directly participating in the lesson, and sharing opinions. For the present study, a scale was developed to determine the perceptions of the learners about the 7E model-based AR-enriched computer lesson. Validity and reliability studies were also conducted on the data obtained from the developed scale. The scale, which was prepared using a five-point Likert scale, was applied to 400 students who fit the profile of the sample group. A statistical analysis of the results concluded that 26 low-factor loading items should be removed from the questionnaire, and the final version of the 28-item scale was a six-factor structure. The statistical analysis concluded that the scale was suitable for all criteria in terms of validity and reliability. Considering the values revealed in the study, it was concluded that the overall scale (\u03b1 = 0.932) was highly reliable.",

            "text": "Human beings learn something new every day, and they do this through education [1]. The concept of teaching emerged to make education more meaningful and understandable [2]. There are two elements to education. These are the ones who teach and those who learn [3]. For a teacher to teach effectively, they must also have qualifications and experience in instructional design [4]. The learner\u2019s success is achieved once they transfer the updated and correct information to the new generation [5].\nSustainability 2022, 14, 12037. https://doi.org/10.3390/su141912037 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nEducational scientists have researched how new technologies could be integrated into education and how knowledge could be transferred more successfully to new generations [6]. They have stated in their studies that the structuring of learning-teaching environments is insufficient in terms of meeting the requirements foreseen in the 21st century [7]. Educational needs, which are thought to be insufficient [8], appear as inevitable parts of learning [9] (pp. 6\u20137) within the scope of contemporary education understanding. It is necessary to design and develop the physical condition of the teaching environment, a democratic climate, the seating arrangement, and the teaching tools to be used, taking into account the individual differences of the students to motivate them and ensure their participation in the activities to be conducted in the contemporary teaching approach [10]. Based on this, there is a strong hypothesis that the Behavioral Learning Theory (BLT) is insufficient to meet the educational needs of today\u2019s generation, which is a versatile one [11]. The technological developments mentioned above highlight the need to change the existing BLT education system [11] to meet the educational needs of new generations. There has been a gradual distancing from the BLT-based education system in the 21st century. Educators who search for new systems prefer Constructivist Learning Theory (CLT), which represents an educational approach related to student-centered knowledge and learning [12\u201314]. CLT aims to encourage students to use and reflect on thoughts they produce in their daily lives in the classroom environment [6,15,16]. Kanl\u0131 [17] states that the concrete foundations of CLT are in the Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS) and that some models emerged during the implementation of the theory, which contributed to its development. These models are the 3E, 5E, and 7E. The 3E model consists of three steps, the 5E model consists of five steps, and the 7E model consists of seven steps. In the 1960s, the \u201cLearning Cycle\u201d model emerged during the primary education curriculum project supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [18]. The stages of exploration, concept introduction (explanation), and concept application (expansion) constitute the learning cycle [19]. The most basic learning circle of CLT is 3E, where the learners\u2019 conceptual development is based on the outcome of their acquisition of knowledge through classroom discussions [20,21]. As a result of their efforts to make the 3E model more efficient, the researchers developed the 4E model, which has four steps: explore, explain, expansion, and evaluation [22]. After the 4E model, educational scientists developed the 5E model. For the development of the 5E model, Kanl\u0131 [17] stated that \u201cthe model which is generally accepted and widely applied by science educators divides the exploration phase in the 3E model into curiosity/participation and discovery, expresses the term introduction phase as the explanation phase, changes the concept application phase to expansion, and additionally expresses the last phase as evaluation\u201d. In the 5E model, which is shaped by the CLT like the 3E model, each E symbolizes a stage in the model, experiential learning is deliberately encouraged, and learners are motivated and engaged [23]. The 5E model was regarded as inadequate by Eisenkraft [24], so they developed the 7E model, a higher education version with more training steps. S\u0327ahin [25] stated that although the educator needs to exert a little more effort during the preparation stage for the lesson in the 7E model, the model responds to all phases of contemporary education. In addition, Eisenkraft [24] and S\u0327ahin [25] stated that this effort and time can be used correctly thanks to the fact that all learners in the classroom can follow the class equally, participate, discuss in groups, and produce new information based on their existing knowledge. Furthermore, educators have adopted the view that learners are aware that they can access information at any time and place outside the classroom-school and learn it effortlessly without needing to memorize it and that the learning process is an enjoyable one during which they can participate and express their opinions [25,26]. The Flipped Classroom Model (FCM), which resources the Internet, stands out as another educational model that fully overlaps with the aforementioned issues [27]. The pedagogical foundations of the FCM are based on\nCLT and were developed by trainers [28]. In the FCM, each student in the classroom has the opportunity to participate in the practices equally since the learners can rewatch the lesson as many times as they want in a comfortable environment at home or in any environment suitable for them, with interactive video, and come to the class having learned the subject [26]. On the other hand, in traditional education, some maintain that learners do not receive equal educational opportunities in the classroom [25]. The course content prepared with the FCM is presented to the students using an easy-to-access web-based Learning Management System (LMS). In addition, an LMS is also known as a virtual learning application [29,30]. However, Web 2.0 tools are used as add-ons to assist training on LMSs [31]. Web 2.0 tools emerged as a result of web-based technological developments [32]. Another innovation that is one of the web-based technological developments is Augmented Reality (AR) [33]. Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and Kloos [34] defined the concept of AR, which is becoming more common every day, as follows: \u201cIt is a 3D technology that improves the user\u2019s sensory perception of the real world with a contextual information layer.\u201d At this point, it is worth noting that the idea of using AR in education continues to gain popularity with new trials every day. In fact, educational scientists who support this idea agree that AR has been the most popular and promising subject in educational research in the last decade [34\u201336]. AR applications attract student attention, especially when studying at home. They appeal to the learners visually and audibly; therefore, they are much more engaging than the traditional educational methods [37], hence why AR and FCM videos are associated. In addition, students experience psychological anxiety in the computer lab just like they do in other labs. [38] The reason for this is that the laboratory is an unfamiliar environment. They think that these tools and equipment will harm them, so they refrain from using the equipment [38]. However, AR effectively provides a friendly atmosphere [39] in the labs; therefore, the learners adapt much more easily and faster. In light of what has been said, many maintain the belief that AR-supported CLT, which can best integrate with present-day technological developments in education and training, can meet the educational needs of the present-day generation [11]. COVID-19, which bears the title of the first global pandemic of the digital age, has made itself fully felt in the global context since March 2020 and has also highlighted the adoption of technology in terms of Digital Learning (DL) [40]. In line with all the information mentioned above, including AR, both during COVID-19 and thereafter, it is foreseen that DL and its varieties will be an indispensable part of education as a support to education but will not completely replace traditional education [41,42]. In the first global pandemic of the digital age, COVID-19, the negative effects on stress, anxiety, and learner ability [43] associated with the pandemic show that DL alone cannot be sufficient [44,45]. However, a study by Zawacki-Richter [46] found that learners who have some of their courses online are more likely to prefer blended environments and less likely to elect solely face-to-face courses. In this respect, we can clearly state that the necessity of using face-toface education along with DL has become a governing choice in education. In addition, blended learning has various benefits such as \u201cpedagogical richness, ease of access to information, social interaction, cost-effectiveness, reorganization, and flexibility\u201d [47]. It is possible to maintain that DL, which has come to the fore with technology acceptance, has gained popularity with the necessity of using it in conjunction with face-to-face education. In other words, under the current pandemic conjuncture, DL will be used together with face-to-face education and will take its place as blended learning shortly [47,48]. Researchers have carried out separate studies that deal with each of the definitions and concepts mentioned above. However, a study in which all of the \u201c7E Model\u201d consisting of \u201cAugmented Reality\u201d, \u201cFlipped Classroom Model\u201d, and \u201cLearning Management System\u201d blended was not found in the literature to date. This study found that it is necessary to determine the extent of the required perception levels of the learners within the scope of the 7E model-based AR-enriched computer course. The literature review proved that studies related to AR, the 7E model related to FCM, and LMS-related studies were reached separately. This scale development study aims to fill\na gap in the existing literature, arouse curiosity in the field of education, and help future similar studies by creating a scale on which all the concepts of the 7E Model, AR, FCM, and LMS are used together for a computer course. We believe the present study will contribute to the literature in this context.\nPurpose of the Research\nThe purpose of this research is to develop the scale to determine the students perceptions of the 7E model-based AR enriched computer course. For this purpose, validity and reliability studies were conducted on the data obtained from the developed scale."

The Simple Random Sampling Method (SRSM) was implemented during the selection process [49]. Taherdoost [49] defines SRSM as an impartial selection method in which each member of a population has an equal chance of being a participant. Accordingly, 40 students were selected from each faculty to reach the total number of 400 students. In the first week, the students received the necessary information about the technologies they were going to use in the course and the method that was going to be applied. After obtaining all the required permissions, we completed the study in 7 weeks. The study aimed to provide an equal educational opportunity to all participants (students) who participated in the study voluntarily, regardless of whether they had previous experience, so each student had a good command of the subject. In the presentation, the students learned about which tools they were to use, how to access the system, how to be active in the system, how to use the applications, and how they could find answers to many questions as such. This orientation period was carried out face-to-face and even one-on-one at times. In addition, all questions were answered one by one to eliminate any doubts the participants might have. After the participants were oriented, they attended the course as part of the research for 7 weeks. Before coming to the lesson, the students were required to follow the subjects prepared with FCM, which were uploaded on the LMS by the teacher. Since the students were familiar with the subject of the day, the 7E steps were applied one by one. This helped to attract the student\u2019s attention, and the learning phase was reinforced with group work and activities. Regarding the gender ratio, 51.2% (205) female students and 48.8% (195) male students participated. Of the 400 students, 35.7% (143) were in their sophomore year, 35.5% (142) were in their junior year, and 28.8% (115) were in their senior year. Furthermore, we determined that 97.5% (390) of the students participating in the study used computers, 2.5% (10) did not, 95.5% (382) had a personal computer at home, and 4.5% (18) did not."

            "text": "The scale was developed to determine the university students\u2019 perceptions of the 7E model-based AR-enriched computer course. During the scale development stage, a literature review helped create a pool of 59 items. Two different linguistic experts examined the drafted items for expression, spelling, and punctuation errors, and the necessary corrections were made in line with their feedback. In addition, the scale item was measured for content validity [50]. A study should include sufficient expert opinions to determine the intended feature\u2019s coverage power to measure the scale item [51\u201356]. The reason is that if the number of experts (between 5\u201340) is limited to a sufficient number, the scale\u2019s validity will be high [51,57,58]. Therefore, we consulted five instructors from the Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies for content and coverage validity and made the necessary corrections in line with their feedback. We removed five statements from the scale and finalized the data collection tool with 54 items (see Table A1).\nThe 400 students who fit the criteria of the population were subjected to the scale to test its validity and reliability. Expressions unrelated to the subject should be removed, and those reflecting the essence of the subject should be included to determine the exact content and scope of the scale [54,55,57,58]. As a result of the statistical analysis and in light of the data obtained, 26 more items with low-factor loading were removed from the questionnaire. The remaining 28 items made up the final version of the scale (see Table A2), which had 6 factors.\nThe 6 factors created are as follows:\n\u2022 Emotional Attitudes Towards Computer Courses (Factor 1): This sub-dimension aims to measure whether students thought the computer course is fun, interesting, straightforward, motivating, and important; \u2022 Flipped Classroom Videos (Factor 2): This sub-dimension aims to assess whether the teacher\u2019s explanation of the subject increased student participation, whether it was clear and informative, and whether the lecturer supported their statements with examples; \u2022 Computer Assisted Education Applications (Factor 3): This factor aims to assess whether applications in computer lessons increase teacher-student interaction, increase student-student interaction, help students understand better, and make learning more enjoyable and efficient; \u2022 Laboratory Assisted Computer Course (Factor 4): To assess the development of empathy skills, the increase of communication skills, the development of new perspectives, the encouragement of working with computers, and the contribution of the practices in the development of thinking skills, and the improvement of these practices in the computer lab; \u2022 AR Activities (Factor 5): To assess whether AR activities in the computer courses arouse curiosity, provide a sense of reality to the atmosphere, and help learn threedimensional technology; \u2022 Computer Lab Anxiety (Factor 6): To assess why learners do not wish to participate in the activities in the computer lab.\nThe following paragraph was prepared as a cover page of the questionnaire. It aimed to familiarize the participants with the nature of the questionnaire and how to respond to the questions. \u201cDear students; This scale aims to measure student perception toward the computer course enriched with Augmented Reality, designed with the 7E Model.

Its range was from \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d (5 points) to \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d (1 point), and the statistical analyses were carried out based on the answers the participants gave. A Factor Analysis (FA) was performed to explain the large-scale variables with the smaller number of variables called \u201cFactor\u201d to determine the relationship between the developed scale and the variables [60]. To perform the FA, the Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin Test (KMO) [61] was applied to determine sample adequacy. The Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity [61] was also implemented to ensure that the data conformed to the multivariate normal distribution [62]. Exploratory Factor\nAnalysis (EFA) [63] was applied to the acquired data to obtain information about the nature and structure of the factors measured with the developed scale. In FA, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) [64] was used at the stage of separating the factors into new factors to understand and increase the ability to interpret them. In parallel, the Varimax rotation technique [65] was used, and the factor loading matrix [66] was calculated by Kaiser normalization [65].

The SPSS-24 package program was used in the analysis of the collected data and EFA [63] was applied first. PCA [64] and the Varimax rotation method [65] were implemented during this process. In addition, as a result of these procedures, items with item loading values below 0.40 and items with a load value less than 0.10 differences across multiple factors were excluded from the analysis, and the FA continued through repetition. As a result of EFA [63], we obtained a six-factor structure consisting of 28 items. To determine the conformity of this structure, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was utilized [68], by using the AMOS-24 program, and for testing the CFA [68], we implemented the maximum likelihood method [69]. A Pearson correlation analysis [70] was applied to determine the concordance validity between the factors. To determine the reliability of the measurement tool obtained from the FA, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha value of the whole scale was determined by calculating the total from each subdimension."

This value ranges from 0 to 1 and is considered perfect when it is above 0.90 [71\u201373]. Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity was also statistically significant (\u03c72 = 6079.890, p < 0.001). According to the results obtained from these values, we can say that the sample size is sufficient and the dataset meets the necessary criteria to continue the FA.\nIn Figure 1, the eigenvalue scree plot of the 7EMAGBA\u00d6 scale is examined, and six breakpoints can be identified with an eigenvalue of over 1. When these breakpoints are considered, it is visible that the scale has a factor structure consisting of six dimensions. When we examined the eigenvalue and explained variance ratios of each factor in Table 2, we found that it has a six-factor structure with an eigenvalue above 1, the variance ratio of Factor 1, which consists of seven items, has an eigenvalue of 10.224, and factor loads ranging from 0.533 to 0.829, was 36.51%.

According to Tabachnick and Fidel [74], the minimum value of factor load values should be 0.32. The analysis shows that common variance values vary between 0.444 and 0.823. According to the literature, a total variance value between 40 and 60% is considered an adequate criterion.

            "text": "The results indicate an increase in student attitudes towards the computer courses in line with their proficiency. A study conducted by G\u00fcnd\u00fczalp and Y\u0131ld\u0131z [80] had similar findings concerning computer proficiency. The results of the present study also found an increase in the participation and learning skills of the students with the FCM videos used in the computer courses. Y\u0131lmaz et al. [81] reached similar conclusions about students\u2019 performance, participation, and learning skills in their study. The results of this study\nfurther found that students gained positive attitudes and their self-efficacy perceptions increased with the computer-aided education applications used in the course. Polat and Karakus\u0327 [82] reached similar results in their research on the effects of computer-aided education applications. This study found that the students were more successful with the AR activities used in the computer courses compared to the classes conducted using traditional methods. Al\u0131nl\u0131 and Yaz\u0131c\u0131 [83] reached similar results in their study on the implementation of AR activities in the course. In the light of the developments in technology in recent years, delivering better education to learners, trying to find the best among the existing education models, ensuring the active participation of the learners in the class, researching this subject, and following the latest research have become a necessity for all educators who wish to improve themselves [84]. We found that a positive attitude toward the use of technology in education [84,85], self-efficacy [84\u201386], and perceived usefulness [84] were strong predictors [84,85,87]. Accordingly, the educator should carefully select appropriate auxiliary resources (such as the Internet, LMS, and Web 2.0 tools) to increase the quality of education in computer courses [4]. Learners should be able to receive education in the best conditions in the computer laboratories and benefit from them [88]. Therefore, it is necessary to determine learners\u2019 perceptions of computer courses. Creating the course plan based on the 7E Model of CLT with all its phases [89], uploading the class videos created via FCM [90] on the LMS and presenting them to the learners, planning the activities using the LMS, planning the laboratory environment and activities, and using AR for activities and applications constitute the infrastructure of the computer course. However, reintroducing mobile devices, which have been included in this infrastructure and have started to become a problem both inside and outside the classroom, into education [91] is necessary. In this context, it is important that learners access AR via mobile devices to use classroom applications [92]. A scale is needed to determine the learners\u2019 perceptions of their proficiency in the course. However, the literature review proved that an adequate and qualified scale for scientific studies in this area does not exist. Consequently, it becomes clear how important the study is. The scale for the 7E Model-Based AR Enriched Computer Course developed in the study proved an empirically valuable scale that will enable national and international researchers to conduct further research. Educational scientists are searching for new education models and systems not only for the new generation but also for all future generations due to the conditions of the first global pandemic of the Digital Age, COVID-19. For education to continue under all circumstances, the emphasis is on a student-centered education model in which technology acceptance and DL are part of the education. The most recent technology and tools should be included and utilized to the maximum extent to implement the training model. Once these conditions have been met, a DL model can be created. It will be possible for the learners to use their existing knowledge without getting bored, to add their comments and opinions, and to understand the subjects more consciously by actively participating and applying. As a result, since learners will be conscious at every stage of education, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption of education will not be experienced. At this stage, it is necessary to determine how effective the education is. For this, it is imperative to determine the self-efficacy perceptions of the learners towards the course content. For this purpose, the 7EMAGBA\u00d6 scale was confirmed in six dimensions through a 28-item CFA. The developed scale is the first of its kind in developing countries such as TRNC. The results concluded that the scale was suitable for all criteria in terms of validity and reliability. Thus, a scale developed within the scope of DL can be implemented to determine learners\u2019 self-efficacy in future scientific studies conducted in TRNC and other countries to identify the \u201cPerceptions of the 7E Model-Based AR Enriched Computer Course\u201d (Appendix A).\nAuthor Contributions: Supervision, E.E.; methodology, E.E. and A.Y.; writing-review and editing, E.E. and A.Y.; conceptualization, A.Y.; investigation, A.Y.; resources, A.Y.; writing\u2014original draft, A.Y.
