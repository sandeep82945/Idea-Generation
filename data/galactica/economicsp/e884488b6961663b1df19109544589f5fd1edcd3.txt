To address challenges associated with climate change, population growth and decline in international trade linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, determining whether national crop production can meet populations’ requirements and contribute to socio-economic resilience is crucial. Three crop models and three global climate models were used in conjunction with predicted population changes. Compared with wheat production in 2000–2010, total production and per capita wheat production were significantly (P < 0.05) increase in 2020–2030, 2030–2040 and 2040–2050, respectively, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 due to climate change in China. However, when considering population and climate changes, the predicted per capita production values were 125.3 ± 0.3, 127.1 ± 2.3 and 128.8 ± 2.7 kg during the 2020–2030, 2030–2040, 2040–2050 periods under RCP4.5, or 126.2 ± 0.7, 128.7 ± 2.5, and 131.0 ± 4.1 kg, respectively, under RCP8.5. These values do not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the baseline level (127.9 ± 1.3 kg). The average per capita production in Loess Plateau and Gansu-Xinjiang subregions declined. In contrast, per capita production in the Huanghuai, Southwestern China, and MiddleLower Yangtze Valleys subregions increased. The results suggest that climate change will increase total wheat production in China, but population change will partly offset the benefits to the grain market. In addition, domestic grain trade will be influenced by both climate and population changes. Wheat supply capacity will decline in the main supply areas. 1 conclusions of Ye et al. (2020), that potential wheat yields in HH would increase by ca. 4.6 and 11.7 Mt with 1.5 and 2.0 °C warming, respectively. This clearly indicates that HH, the main wheat production area, will continue to be the most important wheat growing area and account for more wheat production than the other subregions in the future. The findings are also consistent with findings by Tao et al. (2017b), that the wheat yield in the HH subregion benefited historically from increases in the minimum temperature. To reduce the uncertainties in the results, three crop models and three GCMs were used to predict changes in the potential yield of wheat. Wang et al. (2020a) found that the main sources of uncertainty in climate-crop modeling were crop models in China and GCMs in Australia. Coefficient of variation (CV) of the different crop models and different GCMs were calculated in this study. Using the same GCM with different crop models, the CV was 3.1%. Using the same crop model with different GCMs, the CV was 0.9%. This result was similar to the reported by Ye et al. (2020), whose study demonstrated that wheat yields simulated under the same GCM by different crop models had a larger
variation than those simulated under the same crop model by different GCMs in China. Without considering population growth, the annual per capita production amounts were significantly higher (p < 0.05), under both climate scenarios, than baseline levels. However, when considering population growth, the corresponding annual per capita production amounts did not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the baseline level. Comparison of the changes in predicted per capita production with and without population growth indicates that the anticipated benefit of climate change for food security may be weakened by population change. However, the population change may not cause food crises, as no significant reduction in per capita production was predicted. Policies of the Chinese government are intended to ensure that net carbon dioxide emissions peak by 2030 and fall to zero by 2060. Increases in soil organic carbon storage were observed in farmland soil in China during 1980–2000, and farmland soil may be able to absorb approximately 1.03 Pg carbon in the next 30–50 years (Yu et al., 2021). Moreover, with increasing wheat yields under climate change, more carbon will be needed in the process of crop growth (Kimball & Idso, 1983; van der Kooi et al., 2016). Thus, climate change may assist efforts to meet the target dates for peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality. 4.2 relationships between climate variables and potential wheat yield Atmospheric CO2 concentration can increase the photosynthetic rates, biomass formation, and crop yields (Deryng et al., 2016). As a C3 plant, wheat receives more benefits from CO2 increases than some other crops that are C4 plants (Kang et al., 2002). In addition, some studies have shown that 9800–10600 3.9 10.9 12.2 15.8 9.2 11.8 22.9  9000–9800 21.0 29.8 29.9 27.5 31.6 31.6 21.5  8200–9000 24.0 7.9 8.6 8.5 9.6 8.9 8.5  7400–8200 9.3 10.0 8.6 7.8 8.9 7.5 7.5  6600–7400 11.0 15.5 16.0 16.7 15.8 17.5 17.1  5800–6600 13.6 7.7 7.1 7.9 8.3 7.6 9.3  5000–5800 8.3 10.6 10.2 8.7 10.4 8.8 6.3 1 3
temperature increases are more beneficial for wheat growth in relatively cool regions than in warmer regions (Wang et al., 2017). This is consistent with findings of this study, that increases in LP and HH (the cooler subregions) will be
larger than those in YV and SW (the warmer subregions). Ye et al. (2020) found that the potential wheat yields in SW subregions would decrease while those in other subregions would increase under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming. These
findings partly conflict with results of this study, which may be due to differences in the GCM models used and time periods considered. Moreover, according to Araya et al. (2020), elevated CO2 concentrations have weaker effects on wheat yields in areas with relatively high temperatures. This may cause the increases in yield in the SW subregion to be smaller than those in other subregions (Ye et al., 2020). According to the results of RFR (Table 2), the influences of climatic variables on wheat yield had spatial differences. For the LP and HH subregions, the influence of TMAX was larger than that of SAD. For the SW and YV subregions of southern China, the influence of SAD was larger than that of TMIN. This may contribute to the differences in the solar radiation and temperature distributions in China. In southern China, sunshine duration of spring, summer, autumn, and winter were smaller than northern China (Xiong et al., 2020). Therefore, in southern China, solar radiation is lower than northern China (Feng & Wang, 2021; Feng et al., 2021). At the same time, temperature in southern China is warmer than those in northern China due to latitude. Therefore, for wheat growth in southern China, SAD is a more important limiting factor than temperature. The importance of SAD in southern China was larger than that of temperature in RFR analysis. 4.3 uncertainties of the results A premise of this study was that the planting area would not change in the future, so in the upscaling process it was assumed that the planting area would remain the same as the area recorded during 2000–2010 in the future. However, previous studies indicate that suitable planting areas will change under climate change. Gao et al. (2020) concluded that maize-wheat double-cropping systems will move toward the northeast and northwest of China in the future. In addition, Yang et al. (2015) found that northern shifts in suitable planting areas under climate change will result in a 2.2% increase in the Chinese production of three major crops (maize, wheat and rice). Therefore, if the increase in suitable planting area is also taken into account, national wheat production will increase further. Changes in cultivar and sowing date can also significantly influence wheat yields. For example, Bai et al. (2016) found that cultivar renewal improved wheat yields by 6.5–27.8%, and according to Sun et al. (2018) it could increase wheat yields by 6.93, 17.69, 24.87, and 52.72% in Northern China, the Yellow and Huai River Valleys, the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valleys, and Southwestern China, respectively. Sun et al. (2007) found that sowing delays significantly reduced winter wheat yields, by 0.5% per day. However, neither cultivar renewal nor adaptation management, both of which may be undertaken by farmers in the future, were considered in this study. The other main uncertainties of this study are the population increases. Population changes are affected by many factors, especially government policy. Regression analysis provided satisfactory results for the historical data and predicted a slow increase in the Chinese population. However, prediction was limited to about 30 years. This is too short for long-term national and global policies. A more comprehensive approach, such as a machine learning method, with the ability to take the birth rate, death rate, and other factors into account would be more favorable. In addition, in this study only the national production of wheat in China was projected, and changes in production of other crops and crops in other countries were ignored. Clearly, more comprehensive evaluation of the production of major crops in both China and elsewhere is essential for rigorous determination of the relationship of food security and climate change. 4.4 implications As shown by the calculated spatial distributions of per capita wheat production in the future in section 3.5, and Fig. 8, per capita wheat production was higher in the northern part of the research area (HH, LP, and GX subregions) than in the southern part (SW and YV subregions). Notably, the wheat production in most areas of the SW and LP subregions was too low to meet requirements of the local population, and the per capita wheat production in these subregions was lower than the Chinese average. Therefore, three types of regional food security and domestic grain trade were recognized in China. First, most areas in LP, HH, and GX subregions produced enough wheat to satisfy the local populations’ food needs and excess grain to transport to other regions. Second, the SW and YV subregions produced wheat, but not enough to satisfy needs in these regions. Therefore, there was no excess grain to transport to other regions. Third, wheat was not planted in regions outside the study area, so wheat needs in them would have to be met by the grain trade. There was also spatial variation in per capita wheat production under the population and climate change scenarios. It increased in some areas, mainly in northern parts of the study region, and decreased in others, mainly in southern parts. The per capita wheat production decreased in most areas of GX and LP under
1 3
both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. It also decreased in the northern part of HH. However, projected per capita wheat production in most areas of SW and YV increased, indicating that climate and population change will influence the self-sufficiency of different regions and domestic food trade. Briefly, the supply capacity will decline in the main supply areas, i.e., the first type mentioned above, but increase in the second type. 5 conclusions Compared with wheat production in 2000–2010, wheat production and per capita wheat production were significantly (P < 0.05) increase in 2020–2030, 2030–2040 and 2040–2050, respectively, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 due to climate change in China. When considering population growth, the corresponding per capita potential production amounts did not significant differ (P > 0.05) from baseline levels. The projections indicate that the average per capita wheat production will decrease in the Loess Plateau and Gansu-Xinjiang subregions, but increase in the Huanghuai, Southwestern China, and Middle-Lower Yangtze Valleys subregions. The results suggest that population growth will partly offset the benefits of climate change for the grain market, but there will be no food crisis due to climate change or population growth in China, although supply capacities of the main supply areas will decline.
