            "text": "The synthesis of chiral amines is of signicant importance to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry as this group is widely distributed amongst the most used bioactive compounds in the world.1,2 Their synthesis is oen accomplished through reductive amination,3 in which an amine is reacted with a ketone partner to form an intermediate hemiaminal, which then loses water to give an imine that is subsequently reduced to the corresponding amine (in the case of primary and secondary amine formations, the major focus of this perspective, Scheme 1).3\nHigh optical purity is crucial for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacture and therefore a wide variety of reaction systems has been developed for asymmetric reductive amination to form chiral amines.\nAsymmetric reductive amination is oen accomplished using organocatalysis4\u20136 or chiral transition metal (TM)-based catalysis.7\u201310 In an early example of the latter, Blaser showed that the precursor 1a of the herbicide (S)-metolachlor could be synthesized from methoxyacetone 1 with 2-methyl-5ethylaniline a and hydrogen using an iridium catalyst\n, Heslington, York YO10 5DD, UK.

However, challenges remain for the general application of TM-catalyzed reductive amination, such as imperfect stereoselectivity, gaps in amine and ketone scope, as well as inhibition by amine derived intermediates.\nGiven the increasing pressure on the chemical industry to develop more sustainable routes to bioactive molecules, there has also been signicant interest in developing biocatalytic methods for chiral amine production.13,14 Focusing on enzymes\nScheme 1 The asymmetric synthesis of chiral secondary amines via hemiaminal and imine formation by reductive amination (adapted from ref. 3).\nChem.

The rst of these are u-transaminases (u-TAs, Scheme 3A),15,16 which convert ketones to amines through the use of an amine donor, such as L-alanine or isopropylamine 5. This amine donor is used by u-TAs to aminate the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) to pyridoxamine-5-monophosphate (PMP), with subsequent transfer of the amino group on PMP to the ketone substrate. u-TAs have been the focus of a large amount of research in the last twenty years, including process improvements that combine protein and reaction engineering enabling large-scale industrial processes17,18 despite the need for excess amine donor to create a favourable reaction equilibrium. Additionally, a key limitation of u-TA catalysis is that only primary amines can be synthesized and therefore secondary amine targets must be prepared through further elaboration.\nThe second type of enzyme that catalyzes reductive amination is the amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs).19,20 AmDHs catalyze the direct reductive coupling of ketones with ammonia by\nScheme 3 Biocatalytic amination of ketones by various enzymes. (A) u-Transaminases (u-TAs); (B) amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs); (C) opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs); (D) imine reductases (IREDs); (E) reductive aminases (RedAms).\n4698 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 4697\u20134713\nforming an imine intermediate that is subsequently reduced by the biological hydride transfer agent NAD(P)H (Scheme 3B). Enzymes that catalyze the reductive amination of a-keto acids to a-amino acids (Amino Acid Dehydrogenases, AADHs) using this mechanism are well characterised, including, L-leucine21 and Lphenylalanine22 dehydrogenases (LeuDH and PheDH respectively). The simplicity of this route prompted protein engineering of LeuDH, targeted at altering the carboxylate binding pocket of the enzyme, and yielded a mutant for the enantioselective reductive amination of the aliphatic methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK, 7) to give (R)-1,3-dimethylbutylamine 8 with 99.8% e.e.23 There are now numerous reports detailing the subsequent evolution and application of engineered AmDHs,24\u201326 which make use of other AADH scaffolds including PheDH and also an 3-deaminating L-lysine dehydrogenase (LEAmDH),27,28 for the transformation of non-native substrates. More recently, a family of naturally occurring AmDHs was identied,29,30 that could transform simple ketones to amines using ammonia. These studies will prompt further screening and evolution efforts to expand the available substrate scope of AmDHs. The application of NAD(P)H-dependent AmDHs is attractive from an industrial perspective, given the simple nature of the amine donor, and also the use of nicotinamide cofactors, as technology for their implementation is wellestablished for the industrial exploitation of ketoreductase (KRED) enzymes.31 AmDHs are a valuable resource for the asymmetric amination of ketones, however, excluding a few recent exceptions,32,33 the product scope is limited to primary amines.\nA third type of enzyme, opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs), which in Nature couple a-keto acids and an a-amino acids to form dipeptides,34 can also be engineered for the coupling of aliphatic ketones with primary aliphatic amines, in this case to form secondary amine products (Scheme 3C). For example, 9c could be synthesized from 5-methoxy-2-tetralone 9 and nbutylamine c using a variant of N-(1-D-carboxyethyl)-L-norvaline dehydrogenase (CENDH) obtained by directed evolution.35\nNotwithstanding the discovery and application of engineered OpDHs, which does not appear to have been further explored by academic groups, the reductive amination of ketones to form chiral secondary amines, using alkylamine partners as co-substrates, remained both an attractive goal and a challenge for biocatalysis. In recent years this challenge has been met through the discovery and development of the fourth type of enzymes, the NAD(P)H-dependent imine reductases (IREDs),36,37 which catalyze the asymmetric reduction of cyclic imines such as 2-methylpyrroline 10 (Scheme 3D). IREDs can also enable the reductive amination of carbonyls when the amine partner is provided in large excess, recruiting the imine formed in solution for asymmetric reduction. In some cases the reductive amination between ketone and primary and secondary amine partners provided at a 1 : 1 molar ratio is achievable using the h type of enzyme, a sub-class of IREDs called the reductive aminases (RedAms, Scheme 3E). Since the description of this activity in 2017,38 applied on a 50\u2013100 mg scale to laboratory proof-of-principle reactions, the technology has been very rapidly adopted by groups in academia and\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

IREDs were rst described by Nagasawa and co-workers from Gifu University in a patent led in 2009,41 their activity being identied in strains of Streptomyces that catalyzed the asymmetric reduction of a model cyclic imine, 2-methyl pyrroline 10, to (R) or (S)-2-methylpyrrolidine 11.42 Isolation of these enzymes, followed by reverse genetics studies, led to the sequencing and heterologous expression of genes that encoded IREDs capable of either the (R)-43 or (S)-44 selective reduction of 10 when provided with NADPH. The identication of IRED sequences enabled the discovery of many thousands of genes of previously unknown function capable of imine reduction, and in the years up to 2017, several academic and industrial groups45\u201354 showed that panels of IREDs could be applied, either in cell-free form or expressed in whole cells, for the reduction of a broad range of substrates, such as monocyclic, bicyclic and even large tricyclic imines and iminiums, with excellent complementary stereoselectivity to (R)- or (S)enantiomers.\nThe rst published structures of IREDs45,49,53,54 permitted insights into their broad substrate scope, and also informed mutational studies that looked to provide the rst information on possible mechanisms of catalysis. The IRED fold, typied by\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthe enzyme Q1EQE0 from Streptomyces kanamyceticus,45 is shown in Fig. 1A. IREDs are dimers, constructed of two monomers each with an N-terminal Rossmann domain connected to a helical bundle C-terminal domain by a long interdomain helix. A domain sharing arrangement dictates that the active site is formed between the N-terminal domain of one monomer and the C-terminal domain of its partner, resulting in a large cle that accommodates the nicotinamide cofactor and the substrate. Structures of IREDs that feature more than one dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit show that the cle can exist in either more open or more closed states, the latter providing a hydrophobic environment for substrate binding.45\nOne characteristic of the active sites is a hydrophilic amino acid residue, in most cases, an aspartate or tyrosine, which projects from the ceiling of the active site pocket towards the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor (Fig. 1B). Enzymes featuring Asp43 or Tyr44 were shown to be (R)- or (S)-selective for the reduction of 2-methylpyrroline respectively. While the role of these residues in IRED catalysis has yet to be determined unambiguously, their mutation in (R)-45 or (S)-48 selective IREDs to alanine led to a marked decrease in activity. A structure of the enzyme from Amycalotopsis orientalis (AoIRED), in complex with the amine product (R)-1-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline ((R)MTQ) 13 (Fig. 2A) of the reduction of prochiral 1-methyl-3,4dihydroisoquinoline 12,54 showed that the product was oriented in the active site in such a way that the electrophilic carbon of the substrate imine should be well positioned to receive hydride from the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor from one face, giving the experimentally observed (R)-conguration in the product (Fig. 2B).\nThese and other structures suggested that the binding site was particularly suited to the reduction of hydrophobic cyclic imines and showed how a prochiral substrate could be positioned such that hydride delivery occurred predominantly at one face of the C]N bond.\nChem.

However, the discovery that IREDs possessed broad substrate scope, high activity and stereoselectivity, as well as negligible activity toward the reduction of ketones, prompted researchers to ask whether, in addition to cyclic imines, the activity of IREDs could be expanded to include the formation and reduction of acyclic C]N bonds.\nIn 2014, Mu\u0308ller and co-workers rst established that the IRED from Streptomyces GF3546, if challenged with 20 mM 4- phenyl-2-butanone 14 in a reactionmedium containing 250mM methylammonium buffer, representing a 12.5 molar equivalents (m.e.) of amine, gave a low conversion (8.8%) to the secondary amine product (S)-2-(methylamino)-4-phenylbutane 14b (Scheme 4).49 However, a good enantiomeric excess of 72% demonstrated the principle that a prochiral imine, recruited from solution, could be bound and reduced asymmetrically by an IRED. Further work by Nestl55 consolidated this\n4700 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 4697\u20134713\ndiscovery by showing that further IREDs, such as the (R)-IREDSr from Streptosporangium roseum, would catalyze the reductive amination of ketones including acetophenone 15, with small amine partners such as methylamine b, when provided at 50 m.e., to give the chiral secondary (R)-amine product 15b with 53% conversion and 78% e.e. (Scheme 4). Interestingly, NMR studies were unable to detect imine formation in solution for this reaction, suggestive of the ability of the IRED to rapidly draw the imine from solution for reduction.\nResearchers at Roche published the rst survey of an industrial library of IREDs applied to reductive amination reactions (Scheme 5).\n28 enzymes were screened for their ability to enable the amination of model ketones including acetophenone, cyclohexanone\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Reductive aminations with methylamine were found to be the most effective, but in this case acetophenone was shown to be a poor substrate, with no enzymes yielding conversion >10%. However, aliphatic ketones (2-hexanone 16 and cyclohexanones) could be coupled successfully with methylamine b. The IR_20catalyzed reductive amination of 2-hexanone 16 with methylamine b was scaled up to 400 mg, offering (R)-amine product 16b in 55% isolated yield and 96% e.e. Similarly, the reductive amination of (R)-3-methylcyclohexanone 17 with ammonia d using IR_20 gave a 50% yield of (1S,3R)-amine product 17d with 94% d.e. Matzel and co-workers, working with the Roche collection of IREDs, then demonstrated the synthesis of the anti-Parkinson's agent (R)-rasagiline 18e directly from indanone 18 (Scheme 6) and propargylamine e, if the latter were supplied in large excess.57\nIR-14 was also applied to the 100 mg scale amination of 10 mM 18, with 40 m.e. of amine e, to give the product (R)-18e in\nScheme 6 IREDs from the Roche library catalyzed the synthesis of both enantiomers of rasagiline 18e and tertiary amine 19f.57\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

IR-14 also enabled the reductive amination of cyclohexanone 19 with 40 m.e. of N-methyl propargylamine f, the rst secondary amine accepted in IREDreductive amination to give product 19f, in 59% yield (Scheme 6). The same group also showed that IREDs could mediatedynamic kinetic resolution reactions during the reductive amination of racemic a-branched aldehydes, which are liable to racemise under aqueous reaction conditions, leading to the synthesis of enantioenriched b-chiral amines.58 Hence when IRSip was presented with 20 mM rac-20 or 21 and 10 m.e. of methylamine, 20b or 21b were prepared in 56% yield and 28% e.e. or 81% yield and >95% e.e. respectively (Scheme 7). The reductive amination of aldehyde 22 with amines g and h in pursuit of the (S)-congured fungicides febropidine and fenpropimorph proved more challenging, giving only 9% and 6% conversion respectively. This low turnover was attributed to steric constraints within the active sites of the selected IREDs.\nThese encouraging observations prompted investigation into the role of IREDs in the catalysis of the reductive amination reaction. It was clear that reduction must be achieved in the enzyme once the prochiral imine was formed, but there was little evidence about the role of the enzyme in imine formation as conversions and reaction rates at low amine:ketone ratio were reported to be low."

This study raised for the rst time the possibility that the enzyme was, in some cases, catalyzing not only the reduction of an imine recruited from solution, but also the formation of the imine from ketone and amine. This subclass of IREDs were termed \u2018Reductive Aminases\u2019 (RedAms). Notably, AspRedAm catalyzed the reductive amination of hexanal with allylamine at pH 7.0 and 9.0 at similar rates, which was in contrast with other IREDs, for which a 20-fold increase in activity was observed under basic conditions, in which imine concentration in solution is more pronounced. This observation further suggested that AspRedAm was able to catalyze imine formation as part of the reductive amination process. Kinetic measurements established that the enzyme employed a ter\u2013bi mechanism, analogous to that employed by N-methyl L-amino acid dehydrogenase,59 in which cofactor, then ketone, then amine, are bound sequentially, followed by release of the secondary amine product and nally the oxidized cofactor.

Following this, the small amine bound and was activated for attack at the carbonyl by D175, in combination with N98. Both Y183 and D175 residues are conserved in fungal RedAms that were the subject of this study, but it is clear that many IREDs with reductive aminase activity possess different residues at these key positions, notably Y in the case of D175, and W in the case of Y183, although no mutation or complex structural data has yet been presented to clarify the roles of those residues in relevant enzymes. Indeed the variety of amino acids within IREDs that appear to catalyze reductive amination reactions suggests that a number of variations on this model will exist.\nScheme 11 Reductive aminations catalyzed by RedAms from Neosartorya spp.63,64"

            "text": "The discovery of the IRED-catalyzed reductive amination instigated further applications of the reaction and also studies into enzyme homologs that may catalyze reactions with complementary substrate range and selectivity.\nIt was rst demonstrated that, in addition to the quantitative formation of chiral secondary amines from ketones, fungal RedAms, such as AspRedAm, would also catalyze the resolution of chiral secondary amines if supplied with the oxidized cofactor NADP+, at the elevated pH of 10.5.61 Hence the Q240A variant of AspRedAm catalyzed the resolution of racemic N-allyl4-phenylbutan-2-amine 24 to give 49% conversion to amine (S)24 with >99% e.e., using NADPH oxidase (NOX) to recycle the cofactor (Scheme 10).\nIn addition, the W210A mutant of AspRedAm, which oen displayed complementary enantioselectivity, catalyzed the resolution of the same compound to give the (R)-24 product, again with 54% conversion and >99% e.e.\nThe catalytic promiscuity of the fungal RedAms extended to the amination of uoroketones. Catalysis by IREDs is, for the most part, distinguished by their inability to reduce ketones to alcohols, except in the case of highly activated substrates such as 1,1,1-triuoroacetophenone.62 Gonza\u0301lez-Mart\u0301\u0131nez and coworkers studied this phenomenon with respect to a number of fungal RedAms and mono, bi- and triuorinated ketone substrates with small amines.63 It was determined that, while the expected amines were produced, the proportion of alcohol product increased with the number of uorine substituents, but this was also dependent upon the nature of the amine partner. Hence a,a-diuoroacetophenone 25 was transformed by AdRedAm to a mixture of alcohol 26 and amine 25j when allylamine j\nScheme 10 Resolution of racemic amine 24 by AspRedAm.55\n4704 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 4697\u20134713\nwas the donor, but to a much higher proportion of alcohol 26 and amine 25d with ammonia (Scheme 11).\nThis result was attributed to the competition for binding of the ketone and relevant imine intermediate in each case. The superior ability of some fungal RedAms to enable reductive aminations using ammonia was further investigated by Mangas-Sanchez and co-workers.64 When challenged with 10 mM cyclohexanone and only one m.e. of ammonia, RedAms from the fungi Neosartorya fumigatus (NfRedAm) and Neosartorya scheri (NsRedAm) gave 90% and 81% conversion respectively. Interestingly, while NfRedAm catalyzed the amination of 2-hexanone 24 to give (R)-2-aminohexane 24d with 72% conversion and 97% e.e. (Scheme 11), a switch in stereoselectivity was observed for 2-decanone 27, with (S)-27d being obtained with 41% conversion and 84% e.e. with the addition of 100 m.e. of NH4Cl. The Neosartorya RedAms were also observed to be more thermotolerant than other fungal RedAms, with only a small reduction in activity following incubation at 50 C for 60 min. NfRedAm was applied to the amination of 2-hexanone 16 at a substrate concentration of 80 mM (8 g L 1), to give a space-time-yield (STY) of 0.34 g L h 1 of 16d, but this performance was greatly improved by immobilization of the enzyme on an EziG resin, which resulted in continuous production of (R)-2-aminohexane 16d with an STY of 8.1 g L h 1.\nReductive amination activity was also described for IREDs from outside the realm of fungi. Researchers at Pzer published a study of 45 IRED enzymes from bacteria, in which their capacity for the reductive amination of model ketones with amine partners was evaluated.65 In addition to IREDs displaying activity with known substrates, the study was successful in identifying enzymes with some affinity for bulkier ketone and amine partners. Hence IR91 catalyzed the amination of 2-tetralone 23 with methylamine b to give (S)-23b in 74% conversion and >98% e.e., whereas IR46 gave the (R)-enantiomer. IR44 catalyzed the amination of cyclohexanone with benzylamine,\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The amination with pyrrolidine was performed on a 625 mg scale at a substrate concentration of 125 mM, giving a 71% isolated yield of N-cyclohexylpyrrolidine. Interestingly, little conversion was observed with ammonia as the amine partner.\nIn a similar fashion, researchers at GSK assembled a library of 85 IREDs from diverse sources, and again tested their abilities to catalyze reductive aminations of cyclohexanone 19, 4- uorophenylacetone, and aromatic aldehydes, with bulkier amines including aniline and benzylamine, but also amino thiophenes and aminopyridines, each provided at only 1.1 m.e.66 As part of this screen, IR-01 was reported to catalyze the amination of cyclohexanone 19 with 3-thienylmethylamine k to form N-(thiophen-3-ylmethyl)cyclohexanamine 19k, a precursor of a melanin-concentrating hormone receptor agonist, with 97% conversion (Scheme 12).\nScheme 13 (A) Chemical basis of IRED-y-to-go screen.68 The oxidative NADPH, which is used by diaphorase to reduce tetrazolium salt 28 to re enabled aminations of acetophenones 30 and the production of tertiary a for the amination of esters.68,69\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Interestingly, IR01 also exhibited selectivity in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone using benzene-1,4-diamine, giving a 99 : 1 ratio of monoaminated to diaminated products.\nMontgomery and co-workers at Johnson-Matthey formulated a library of 95 IREDs that included targets from both fungal and plant genomes.67 As in the Pzer and GSK studies above,65,66 enzymes were identied that were competent for the reductive amination of cyclohexanone 19 with bulkier amines, such as benzylamine, phenethylamine and aniline, provided at only 2 m.e. Three enzymes, p-IR06, p-IR-17 and p-IR-79 gave >60% conversion for the amination with benzylamine. The conversion of 50 mM cyclohexanone 19 with 100 mM aniline by p-IR89 was improved through the incorporation of co-solvents, notably cyclohexane, when added as a 200 mL layer to a 700 mL reaction, giving a conversion of 81%.\nMarshall and co-workers recently presented an extensive survey of 384 IRED sequences which, unlike the industrial libraries detailed above, were largely identied from metagenomic samples.68 This study was also successful in addressing the high-throughput evaluation of IRED reductive aminase activity, which is complicated by the range of possible ketone and amine partners. This was accomplished through the development of a colorimetric screen (IREDy-to-go) that could be applied and read in multi-well plates, in which the NADPH\nactivity of an IRED, acting on a secondary amine substrate, generates d dye 29.

The expressed genes were evaluated for their catalysis of a number of reductive amination reactions, revealing a diversity of activity with respect to imine reduction versus reductive amination, activity and stereoselectivity. In addition to known transformations, the survey was especially revealing in identifying IREDs with superior activity for \u2018difficult\u2019 substrates such as acetophenone, than had been observed previously.\nFor example, pIR-361 catalyzed the amination of 3,5-ditriouromethylacetophenone 30 with methylamine b to give amine 30b, a precursor of the NK1 receptor antagonist orvepitant, with >99% e.e., albeit with 7% conversion, (Scheme 13B). pIR-23 catalyzed the amination of hydrocinnamaldehyde 31 with dimethylamine l to give the tertiary amine product 31l with 86% conversion (Scheme 13B). Selected IREDs were also identied that catalyzed the amination of b-keto esters with small amines to give N-substituted b-amino esters. In this mode, eight IREDs were identied and pIR-117 was applied to the synthesis of 32e from ethylacetoacetate 32 and propargylamine e (Scheme 13C), with an isolated yield of 54% and >99% e.e.68\nThis library of metagenomic IREDs also furnished catalysts for the reductive amination of a-keto esters to form Nsubstituted a-amino esters.69 Screening against the model substrate 25 mM ethyl-2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate 33 with 2 m.e. of propargylamine e, 78 and 20 enzymes from the library were found to be (R)- and (S)-selective respectively. pIR-117 catalyzed the synthesis of (R)-33e with 86% conversion and >99% e.e., but when the substrate had a methyl substituent, the (S)-product with 97% e.e. was obtained (Scheme 13C). Preparative scale reactions were performed for selected enzymes and substrates, with pIR-271 used to accomplish the reductive amination of 34 to give product (R)-34e with 61% isolated yield and >99% e.e.\nThe library of metagenomic IREDs was further evaluated for the reductive amination of bicyclic 2-ketotetralin and 2-ketochroman derivatives by Citoler and co-workers.70 Screening of the panel with 5 mM ketone, and either 100 or 200 m.e. of amine, identied enzymes pIR-88 and pIR-221 that successfully aminated 5-methoxy-2-tetralone 35 with n-propylamine m to give the secondary amine product 35m with conversions of 87% and 92% and enantiocomplementary (R)- and (S)- products with >99% and 92% e.e. respectively. pIR-221 was applied to the 1 mmol scale synthesis of 35m at 20 mM concentration, giving a 78% isolated yield of (S)-35m with 92% e.e., which could then be further elaborated by N-alkylation and demethylation over two steps to give the anti-Parkinson's agent (S)-rotigotine 36 (Scheme 14).\nScheme 14 Synthesis of anti-Parkinson's agent (S)-rotigotine 36.70\n4706 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 4697\u20134713\nIn an elegant extension to the reductive amination reaction, Nestl and co-workers showed that IREDs could be applied to the synthesis of piperazines from diamine and dicarbonyl substrates through a double reductive amination.71 The \u2018RIRED_Ms\u2019 enzyme from Myxococcus stipitatus catalyzed the formation of (R)-1-methyl-3-phenyl piperazine 37n with >99% conversion and >99% e.e. when the enzyme was incubated with 5 mM and 1.25 m.e. of the diamine n and dicarbonyl substrate 37 respectively (Scheme 15).\nIncubation of 5,6-dimethyl-2,3-dihydropyrazine with the enzyme gave no products, suggesting that the reactive pathway was likely to proceed via a condensation\u2013reduction\u2013condensation\u2013reduction, rather than by two condensations followed by two reductions, one of which would constitute an intramolecular reductive amination. The substrate scope was expanded to 2,3-diamines and 1,4-dicarbonyl substrates with a variety of alkyl substituents tolerated. The production of (R)-1methyl-3-phenyl piperazine 37n was scaled up to 50 mM substrate concentration, giving 8.1 g L 1 of the product in 87% isolated yield.\nA study of the synthesis of 2-substituted azepanes by IREDs revealed a further possible intramolecular reductive amination reaction catalyzed by these enzymes.72 While a straightforward asymmetric reduction of seven-membered ring imine 38 might be envisaged, this species is not detectable in solution by NMR, suggesting that equilibrium favours the ring-opened amino ketone 39 (Scheme 16).\nHence, the IRED IR-22 was used to catalyze the intramolecular reductive amination of the compound to (R)-2-phenylazepane 40 with 70% conversion and 90% e.e. Additional IREDs were employed in the reductive amination of related substrates, with CfIRED from Cystobacter ferrugenius, giving the (S)-series of products and the metagenomic IRED mIRED10 giving the (R)-enantiomers. This phenomenon of intramolecular reductive aminations was further investigated by Zhu and co-workers, who screened a library of 48 IREDs for the enantioselective formation of 1,4-diazepanes,73 through cyclisation of substrates such as 4-((2-aminoethyl)(5-chlorobenzo[d] oxazol-2-yl)amino)butan-2-one 41 (Scheme 16), a precursor to the insomnia treatment Suvorexant. Activity for the formation of both enantiomers of the product was detected in multiple \u2018IRED-fold\u2019 IREDs, but the best enzyme, then selected for improvement by structure-guided mutagenesis, was actually a pteridine reductase \u2018IR1\u2019 from Leishmania major, an enzyme involved in folate metabolism, which synthesized the sought aer (R)-enantiomer of the product in 99% e.e.

The feasibility of applying IREDs in multienzyme cascades had been established in a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR)-u-TA-IRED cascade for the conversion of carboxylic acids to cyclic amines.74 The reductive amination capability of IREDs could also be applied to the synthesis of secondary amines if ketone substrates could be generated in situ.\nIn a rst application, it was realized that NADPH-dependent RedAms might be combined with NADP+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) to convert racemic alcohols to chiral amines in one pot with closed loop cofactor recycling \u2013 a hydrogen-borrowing cascade.75 In this mode ADH-150 was combined with AspRedAm in the one-pot oxidation-amination of 5 mM cyclohexanol to N-propargyl-cyclohexylamine with 91% conversion using 1 mM NADP+ and 50 m.e. of propargylamine. A combination of a further ADH, the W110A mutant ADH from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus (TeSADH) and AspRedAm, was successful in converting racemic 1-(4- uorophenyl)-2-propanol to the (R)-amine product with 41% conversion and 95% e.e. ADH-150 and AspRedAm were nally combined in a 100 mg scale conversion of cyclohexanol to Nallylcyclohexylamine in 61% yield.\nIn an extension to this study, Tavanti and co-workers showed that cyclohexane 43 could be successively hydroxylated, to cyclohexanol 44, oxidized to cyclohexanone 19 and then aminated using a cascade of the R47L/Y51F/R966D/W1046S mutant of cytochrome P450BM3, the W110A mutant ADH from\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nThermoanaerobacter ethanolicus (TeSADH) and AspRedAm.76 The choice of enzymes permitted the closed-loop recycling of reducing equivalents from NADPH for the RedAm as TeSADH used NADP+ as cofactor (Scheme 17).\nA mixture of enzyme lysates transformed cyclohexane, provided neat to form a two-phase system, to 4.5 mM N-methylcyclohexylamine, but conversions were negatively affected by inhibition of the P450 by the amine donor, and also the competition of endogenous E. coli enzymes for reducing equivalents. Hence, a two-step, one pot approach was adopted, in which hydroxylation was completed prior to the addition of ADH, RedAm and amine, resulting in 19.6 mM of N-propargylcyclohexylamine 19e. A 20 mL scale two-step reaction was performed that yielded 50 mg of the product.\nThe necessity for separation of biocatalytic steps in the last example is illustrative of the lack of compatibility between some systems that militates against the construction of one-pot cascades. Mattey and co-workers have investigated continuous ow systems in an effort to separate otherwise incompatible systems, and applied these to reductive amination cascade reactions.77 Amultipoint injection reactor (MPIR) was employed in which an immobilised choline oxidase mutant rst generated aromatic aldehydes from alcohol substrates. The product was then fed into a reactor containing the immobilised RedAm from Ajellomyces dermatitidis (AdRedAm) and a glucose dehydrogenase for NADPH recycling. This gave a ow system that produced an STY of 2.1 g L 1 h 1 for 4 h. In a further elaboration, the amine donor for the RedAm reaction could be generated by a u-TA, with both immobilized u-TA and RedAm kept in separate packed bed reactors to stop cross reactivity with amines. In this mode, aldehydes such as butyraldehyde and benzaldehyde could be generated using the u-TA and then fed to the RedAm reactor with cyclohexanone, giving STYs of the\nChem.

The ow cascade was applied to the synthesis of the pharmaceutical precursor 4-O-methyl norbelladine 47 (Scheme 18) from isovanillyl alcohol 45, which was rst oxidized to isovanillin using an immobilised galactose oxidase variant (GOase M3\u20135) in the rst reactor. The intermediate aldehyde was then fed to the second reactor containing the RedAm IR80, along with amine donor tyramine 46, to synthesize the product 47 with an STY of 2.26 g L 1 h 1 over a 4 h period.\nA further cascade process combined the successive C]C bond reduction catalyzed by ene-reductases (EREDs) with the IRED mediated reduction of C]N bonds, to convert cyclic ene\u2013 imines to amines with two chiral centres.78 However, it did not prove possible to perform both reactions in one pot, as the IRED reaction was much faster than that of the ERED, and the allylic amines formed were not substrates for the latter enzyme. However, a subsequent screen of the ene\u2013imine substrates against IREDs alone unearthed a surprising promiscuous activity of some enzymes for the reduction of both C]C and C]N bonds.79 A screen of 389 IREDs revealed that 44 of the enzymes were competent for the four-electron reduction of the model ene\u2013imine compound 48 (Scheme 19) to the saturated amine 49 with a particular enzyme, termed EneIRED, catalyzing the reaction with 83% conversion and a diastereomeric ratio of 79 : 21. An extension to this observation was that EneIRED also catalyzed the C]C bond reduction in cyclohex-2-enone 50 followed by reductive amination using allylamine j, giving Nallylcyclohexylamine 19j with 69% isolated yield, constituting a conjugate reduction-reductive amination reaction (CR-RA).79 No CR products were formed in the absence of the amine substrate, strongly indicating a mechanism whereby the substrate for CR is the condensation product 51 of unsaturated ketone and amine (Scheme 19). Following reduction of 51 using NADPH, release of the intermediate 52 into solution would result in hydrolysis to the saturated ketone, which would then be bound by the IRED, along with the amine, in the active site with NADPH to achieve a reductive amination to give secondary amine product 19j. The CR-RA catalysis by EneIRED extended to a range of acyclic and cyclic enones and also enals, in which double bonds were reduced and intermediates reductively aminated with small amines to give products in up to 77% isolated yield. The dual activity of IREDs in this mode suggests that further complex multi-electron reductions catalyzed by these enzymes might be achieved in the future.\n4708 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 4697\u20134713\nScalable reactions and industrial examples\nA Design of Experiments (DoE) approach was taken to the optimization of a model IRED catalyzed reductive amination reaction at scale.80 Dominguez and co-workers employed a customized factorial design, followed by principal component analysis, to the study of the reductive amination of cyclohexanone 19 with cyclopropylamine i. Initial measurements indicated that the concentration of ketone and amine, and the stability of the IRED enzymes used for the study, were the most signicant parameters in reaction optimization. Initial reactions using 200 mM 19 and 2 m.e. of the amine in batch reactions gave 87% conversion to the product using IRED-69, although attempts to increase substrate concentration were not successful with this system. Conversions and yields at higher substrate concentration could be achieved using a fed-batch system in which concentrations of up to 750 mM ketone, supplied at 100 mM h 1, were converted quantitatively to the amine product 19i using IRED-33, with a turnover number of 48 279 and an STY of 12.9 g L 1 h 1.\nThe rst published use of extensive protein engineering for the optimisation of an IRED-catalyzed reductive amination was published by researchers at GSK.39 In this study, the target was the coupling of the aldehyde 53 with bulky amine tranylcypromine sulfate o, with the desired product being the (1R,2S)product 53o (Scheme 20), an intermediate for the synthesis of the lysine-specic demethylase-1 (LSD) inhibitor GSK2879552.\nAn initial screen of GSK IREDs for the reaction using 2.2 m.e. of the racemic amine identied \u2018IR-46\u2019 from Saccharothrix espanaensis as the superior enzyme, which gave the product with 42% isolated yield and 99.9% e.e. in a 5 g scale reaction. The enzyme was targeted for evolution for process suitability, especially for lower pH, to assist reactant and product solubility, but also for improvements in substrate and biocatalyst loading. 256 out of 296 possible residues were subjected to site\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Mutant Y142S (\u2018M1\u2019) was identied as the superior mutant under these conditions, with conversion improved 40-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme. A model of IR-46 suggested that the amino acid side-chain at position 142 makes an H-bond with the pendant aspartate D194 in the active site. Combined with information on other sites at which benecial mutations were identied, a combinatorial library of 4000 variants based on the rst round was further assessed, and yielded the multiple-site mutant \u2018M2\u2019 (Y142S, L37Q, A187V, L201F, V215I, Q231F, S258N) with mutation sites at different locations within the IRED (Fig. 5A). Modelling again suggested that, although some mutations were within or near the active site, and may have roles in substrate positioning (L198M, L201F) or cofactor interactions (G44R, V92K), some\nFig. 5 (A) Model of structure of \u2018IR-46\u2019 derived using AoIRED (5FWN).39 mutated in variant \u2018M3,\u2019 applied in the kg-scale synthesis of 53n in Schem residues mutated in variant Q194L/S220T/H230Y, used in the gram-scal showing locations of residues mutated in variant \u2018R3-V6\u2019 used in the ton\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Interestingly, a study of both melting temperature and half-life of the enzyme showed the improved process performance of mutant \u2018M3\u2019 was largely due to increases in these parameters, which were improved by 30 C and 500-fold respectively over the wild-type, while specic activity was increased only 13-fold.\nResearchers at Novartis have combined genome mining with recent advances inmachine learning for the evolution of an IRED for the stereoselective reductive amination of ketone 54 with methylamine b to molecule ZPL389 54b (Scheme 21), an H4 receptor antagonist used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.81 Library screening plus genome mining was used to identify the enzyme \u2018IRED88\u2019 as being able to catalyze the amination of 54 to the product 54b with 70% conversion, and to the required (R)enantiomer, but with only 30% e.e. A deep mutation scanning (DMS) approach was taken rst, in which a library of mutants composed of all amino acid positions mutated to the 19 alternative residues was screened for activity by mass spectrometry. This revealed a mutant S220T, at the mouth of the active site\nThe model shows the location of amino acid residue sites that were e 20; (B) structure of IRED88 (ref. 81) (PDB 7OG3) showing locations of e synthesis of 54b in Scheme 21; (C) model of structure of SpRedAm40 -scale synthesis of 58b (Scheme 22).\nChem.

Three rounds of error prone PCR (epPCR) using S220T as the platform gave mutant Q194L/S220T/ H230Y with 85% conversion and 99% e.e. The locations of these mutations are shown in Fig. 5B. Applying these data to machine learning algorithms suggested mutants which, when expressed, gave lower e.e.s. However, when machine learning was coupled with structure-guided evolution, superior mutants were identied, including M129L/A156S/Y177W, which gave 59% conversion and 93% e.e. The epPCR generated variant Q194L/S220T/ H230Y was selected for a 1 g scale reaction in which a 72% yield of the product was obtained at a substrate concentration of 100 mM, and with >99% e.e. Further analysis of this variant determined that it had a markedly increased melting temperature of 57 C versus 42 C for the wild-type, and two-fold the specic activity. This study led to several interesting conclusions about IRED engineering: machine learning was useful as a \u2018sample efficient\u2019 strategy to suggest variants with improved properties, which can each serve as a basis for more focused mutation strategies. In any case, it was important that hits were validated using larger scale reactions. The study also showed that a combination of improvements in both specic activity and stability were desirable, and also that linear additivity was observed for mutant loci outside the active sites, but that this phenomenon was more difficult to predict for active site mutations, where cooperativity between amino acids involved in the mechanism of stereoselectivity was likely.\nResearchers at Pzer also instigated a programme of work directed at the application of IREDs to industrial reductive amination reactions. Following their description of a family of enzymes with a range of activity,65 they then reported the application of enzyme IR_064 from Myxococcus fulvus to the production of sertraline using an imine reduction.82 In this work, the enzyme catalyzed the enzymatic reduction of the precursor ((E)-4(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)imine) 55 to make (S,S)-sertraline 56 (Scheme 22).\nThis was followed up by a study of a reductive amination reactions focusing on the synthesis of a key intermediate for an inhibitor of the oncology target CDK/2/4/6.83 88 IRED enzymes were screened for the ability to catalyze the kinetic resolution and reductive amination of 200 mM racemic hydroxyketone 57 with 120 mM benzylamine hydrochloride p to give secondary amine product 57p (Scheme 22). The enzyme IR007, identied as the best candidate, was subjected to directed evolution, to give a nal variant IR007-143 of superior activity, giving 43% conversion from a substrate concentration of 50 g L 1. A 35%\n4710 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 4697\u20134713\nisolated yield from the racemate with 98.4% e.e. was achieved. A cofactor recycling system using glucose dehydrogenase was applied, with sodium hydroxide to maintain the pH of 7.0, as the system results in the formation of gluconic acid. Developments in RedAm engineering were consolidated at Pzer with the recent development of a RedAm-catalyzed process for the production of a precursor of the Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor abrocitinib 59 (Scheme 22).40 80 IREDs were initially screened for their ability to catalyze the amination of isopropyl (1S,3S)-3(methylamino)cyclobutane-1-carboxylate 58 with methylamine b to form the cis-isomer of the desired product 58b (Scheme 22). An IRED from Streptomyces purpureus (SpRedAm) was identied as the best candidate and applied to the 7.5 g scale reactions at a substrate loading of 20 g L 1, giving the product with 27% isolated yield and a d.r. of >99 : 1. SpIRED was therefore selected for protein engineering, starting with site saturation mutagenesis at 93 sites of 296 possible residues, based on homology models and bioinformatics analysis. The most improved variants, for which mutational sites were at or near the active site, gave >75% conversion at 50 g L 1 substrate. A second round of evolution combined some of the benecial mutants to give double and triple variants, of which N131H/ A170C and A170C/F180M were selected for further rounds, with position 170 further from the active site. A multi-site random recombination approach was applied to the best mutants to give variants with 4 to 6 mutations of improved activity at substrate loadings of 75 g L 1. Further recombination in a 3rd round gave variant \u2018R3-V6\u2019 (N131H, A170C, F180M, G217D) (Fig. 5C) of which only position 180 was within the active site, with the others located in the 2nd shell. The nal variant, which exhibited an improvement in activity of 206-fold was applied to the synthesis of the product on an increasingly large scale, from batch (1\u201310 kg) to pilot (50\u2013100 kg) to manufacturing (>200 kg), with 77% conversion reported, against 0.75% for the wt under process conditions. Using this procedure 3.5 MT of the product was synthesized."

In this particular case, the process has been accelerated by the availability of a wide range of contemporary techniques in various disciplines that are now available as established tools for enzyme improvement. Hence, following enzyme discovery and initial biochemical and structural characterisation, informed choices of homologs as starting points for enzyme programs can be made either through screening database homolog sequences or metagenomic resources, using rapid cloning technology and the design of appropriate HT screens. Following this, medium or high-throughput mutation of targets for process improvement can advance initial hits quickly, and data that result from these experiments can now be fed into machine-learning algorithms for the identication of the most useful improvements, and in some cases, in the prediction of further benecial mutations. These studies have already illustrated that, in the case of IREDs and RedAms, considerations of the process suitability of biocatalysts, including thermostability, tolerance of co-solvents and half-life, can be as important as mutations that directly affect substrate recognition or turnover. In the case of reductive aminations, although many advances have been made, many challenges remain. The basis for improvements in activity has been difficult to characterize, as structural data on candidate enzymes in complex with their target molecules is difficult to acquire. This difficulty is compounded by a lack of understanding of the nature of the enzymatic process that is being catalyzed. A continuum appears to exist between true reductive aminations, catalyzed by RedAms, and typied by the reaction of small activated ketones such as cyclohexanone and small hydrophobic amines, and imine reductions, where pre-formed imines are rapidly recruited from solution for asymmetric reduction. More specic information will be required on each target reductive amination therefore, in order for improvements in ketone, amine, and imine recognition to be better targeted, providing more robust platforms for enzyme redesign."
