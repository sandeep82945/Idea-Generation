            "text": "Over the past few decades, urbanization and industrialization have become a global phenomenon. Especially in China, the speed of urbanization and industrialization is unprecedented and has attracted global attention. In the process of rapid urbanization and industrialization, cities are no longer isolated, but rapidly concentrated and linked together in the form of urban agglomerations. In the world of globalization and information explosion, the high-quality development of urban agglomerations is of increasing importance. Facing the challenges of globalization, urban agglomerations actively participate in global urban competition, division and cooperation by virtue of industrial clusters and scale economies, and are also playing an increasingly important role in international competition. In particular, some worldclass urban agglomerations are not only the core of national economic development, but also extend the administrative boundaries, profoundly affecting the world\u2019s economic and social development. In fact, urban agglomerations have become technology incubation centers, production factor allocation centers and wealth creation centers, and are becoming more and more important. Under the influence of market mechanism and government regulation, various factors such as talent, technology, knowledge, information, and capital are continuously concentrated in competitive urban agglomerations (1\u20133). Urban agglomerations have become an important strategic approach for countries to develop productivity and optimize production factors.\nWith the rapid development of urbanization, the land use efficiency of urban has increasingly become a key factor affecting economic, social and environmental development. Land is an indispensable factor of production and the basic support for all social and economic activities. As a unit with a high concentration of economic entities, urban agglomeration is closely related to the utilization of land resources. Land is the spatial carrier of social and economic development, and rational and efficient utilization of land resources is an important guarantee for economic stability and sustainable growth (4). Under the rigid constraints of the relative scarcity of land resources, the contradiction between urban land use and the quality of economic growth has become increasingly prominent. The development model of driving the regional economy by expanding the scale of the city is unsustainable (5). Therefore, promoting the cooperation of various types of urban land, thereby improving the land use economic efficiency, has become an important path to promote the sustainable development of urban agglomerations. Land Use Economic Efficiency (LUEE) of urban agglomerations is a manifestation of the realization degree of land value in economic development, and an intuitive reflection of the economic efficiency of industrial activities. LUEE in urban agglomerations reflects the ratio of input and output of land resources, including two interrelated levels.\nThis paper measures LUEE from the perspectives of single factor productivity and total factor productivity. LUEE in urban agglomerations is an important driving force for the improvement of the quality of economic growth. Therefore, under the rigid constraints of limited urban land supply, improving LUEE is also an important way to solve the problem of excessive land cost in the economic growth of urban agglomerations.\nAt present, urban agglomeration is still in the stage of rapid development. With the continuous improvement of the economic level, the population of urban agglomerations has doubled, the process of urbanization has continued to accelerate, and the demand for land has continued to increase, and the way and structure of land use will inevitably change. However, the demand for land corresponding to the rapid economic development has expanded rapidly, and the extensive land use has become increasingly prominent, which in turn will have a huge negative impact on the economic development of urban agglomerations. Different from previous research, there are four aspects of contribution: First, the coupling coefficient model is established to measure the coordination between the severity of the epidemic and the degree of impact on the land market. Second, a theoretical and empirical analysis framework for driving factors of land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations is constructed. This paper regards land as an important economic factor, and mainly measures the land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations from an economic point of view and analyzes the driving factors. Third, this paper constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system for land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations composed of single factor productivity and total factor productivity. It comprehensively evaluates the land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations and their respective driving factors can be analyzed and compared. Fourth, this paper selects multiple urban agglomerations as the case study and focus on the driving factors of land use economic efficiency. The sustainable development of urban agglomerations is closely related to the land use efficiency. As a regional economic growth pole, urban agglomeration is the gathering place of various resources. An in-depth study of land use economic efficiency of major urban agglomerations in China and its driving factors will help to clarify the average level and gap of land use economic efficiency of each city within the urban agglomeration, which is helpful to adjust human production and living activities, and improve the overall land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations. This will promote urban agglomerations to enter the track of land intensification and high-quality economic development, and also provides relevant theoretical basis for promoting sustainable and green economic development of urban agglomerations.\nThe next section of this six-section paper reviews the literature and develops research hypotheses. The four section describes materials and empirical methods. The five section\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\ninterprets the results. The final section summaries the major findings, contributions, followed by suggestions for future work."

            "text": "Urban land use efficiency is always the core proposition of land science research. Scholars conducted research on intensive land use, measurement and evaluation of land use efficiency, spatial and temporal differences and evolution patterns of land use efficiency and its influencing factors, and provided many suggestions for the improvement of land use efficiency.\nScholars used mathematical statistics to measure the land use efficiency. On the basis of fully understanding the connotation of land intensification, Fonseca (6) selected indicators such as building density and plot ratio to measure urban land use efficiency (6). Harrison and Haklay (7) studied the reality and efficiency of urban land use, and established an index evaluation system and model for land use efficiency (7). Siciliano (8) integrated urbanization strategies, rural development and land use into a holistic framework for a comprehensive analysis (8). Erb et al. (9) integrated the three levels of input intensity, output intensity, and related systemic impacts of terrestrial production, and proposed a conceptual framework to quantify and analyze urban land use efficiency (9). Haque and Asam (10) established an optimization model of land use allocation in urban development zones based on genetic algorithm (10). Enrique and Vanessa (11) used mobile social media applications as an important sensor of urban land use, and used Twitter to test the land use of Manhattan, London and Madrid, and found that Twitter\u2019s positioning information could be used as a powerful data source of urban land use planning application (11). Kishii (12) established a model to evaluate the state of land use efficiency in Japanese cities, and pointed out an integrated approach to planning and utilizing public areas and private property spaces (12). Alexander et al. (13) introduced an explicit indicator and land use management support system to assess land use efficiency at the landscape level by combining land use ecosystem service indicators with land use performance indicators based of optimal land allocation, which provided certain data support for spatial planning and resource management (13).\nScholars studied the driving factors of urban land use efficiency from multiple dimensions. Daniel (14) studied the issue of urban land intensive use and believed that the improvement of urban land use efficiency was inseparable from the land intensive use and the continuous optimization of land use structure (14). Keller (15) used the FDI technology spillover effect theory to study the impact of the similarities and differences of location factors on the urban land use efficiency. Sivam (16) conducted an in-depth study of land use efficiency from an economic perspective. Tanrivermis (17) found that the main factors causing changes in land use types were agricultural\nproductivity, population and urbanization (17). Kironde (18) studied the land use efficiency of five representative cities in Tanzania by establishing an urban land efficiency evaluation model, and proposed that the government\u2019s strong support for the urban land market could improve the efficiency and level of urban land management (18). Lambin et al. (19) pointed out that economic globalization accelerated the conversion of agricultural land and forested to urban land, and land use change posed challenges to sustainable development. Therefore, land must be regarded as an open system, using globalization to improve land use efficiency and control the irrational expansion of urban land (19). Marco et al. (20) found that the nonlinear trend of urban land use efficiency in Attica, Greece, just mapped the urban expansion characteristics of the region at different stages from 1960 to 2010, and pointed out that urban land use efficiency was an important indicator of urban future growth patterns (20). Fetzel et al. (21) empirically studied the relationship between land use and yield in Africa from 1980 to 2005 and showed that land expansion could not increase yield (21). Dadi et al. (22) used GIS to explore the driving factors of urban expansion and its impact on land use change in central Ethiopia. The study showed that industrialization, residential expansion and infrastructure development were the main driving factors of land use conversion, but the transformation of land use efficiency was not high (22). Guastella et al. (23) took the Lombardy region of Italy as the research object, and constructed an economic model to analyze the decisive factors of urban spatial expansion in this region. The study showed that the larger the scale of the city, the higher the land use efficiency, and the smaller city\u2019s land occupation. The problem was less concerned and the land use efficiency was low. Therefore, effective differentiated land planning policies should be adopted to address land use issues (23). Choi and Wang (24) measured the land use efficiency of 16 cities in South Korea by using the SSBM model with undesired outputs. The study showed that the urban land use efficiency in South Korea was on the rise from 2006 to 2013, and the economic development policy of the South Korean government was an important factor in urban land use efficiency (24). Deilmann et al. (25) evaluated the land use efficiency of German cities through data envelopment analysis, and the results showed that medium-sized cities, as the development centers of residential areas and transportation areas, had the highest land use efficiency, and residential area was not the only factor determining high efficiency, high density alone did not guarantee efficiency (25).\nThe impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic on public spaces has been extensively assessed in public health. Scholars have pointed out strategies for responding to urban epidemics by developing a pandemic-resistant urban form at different stages of response (26). The flexibility of urban spaces has been greatly affected by COVID-19 and needs to adapt to existing structures such as public institutions or infrastructures (27). In response to the crisis, planning for an equitable and sustainable environment\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 03 frontiersin.org\nfor citizens, economies and communities makes sense, and it is the \u201cnew normal\u201d in urban areas (28). The risk of COVID-19 transmission is associated with land use mix, but the conclusions are inconsistent (29\u201331).\nJudging from the existing literature, scholars have mainly analyzed the driving factors of urban land use efficiency from the aspects of location, city size, industrialization, government policies, and infrastructure. The theoretical analysis and empirical investigation of land use economic efficiency and its driving factors from the perspective of economics are rare, and it is urgent to strengthen research in this area."

            "text": "The COVID-19 epidemic in late 2019 had a huge impact on the economies of China and other countries around the world (32). Since 2022, a new round of COVID-19 epidemic has broken out in many places. Compared with the COVID19 epidemic that occurred in 2020, this epidemic has spread faster, has more confirmed cases, and is expected to last for a longer time. This has a great impact on China\u2019s macroeconomy and land market. Based on this, this paper proposes a hypothesis.\nH1: The COVID-19 epidemic has a great impact on the land market of urban agglomerations in China, and it shows great differences.\nAs a special economic factor, the input-output efficiency of land is also closely related to economic agglomeration, industrial structure and other factors. Therefore, based on theory and literature analysis, this paper examines the driving factors of land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations in China from the aspects of industrial agglomeration, industrial structure, technological progress, marketization institution and infrastructure.\nAgglomeration is an inevitable trend of economic development, and urban agglomeration is the main place and important carrier of economic agglomeration. With the improvement of economic development and urbanization level, economic agglomeration is mainly manifested in the gradual improvement of the information transmission system and service system of a specific industry or related industry, which provides a basis for the realization of service sharing, infrastructure sharing and forward-backward linkage between industries. Therefore, land users in the agglomeration area can easily obtain market information and various related services, which greatly reduces transaction costs. At the same time, agglomeration will further strengthen industrial division and specialization. In this process, the land users in the agglomeration area also gradually achieve the optimal level of economic scale, and can gain the advantage of scale economy,\nwhich will greatly increase the land income. Industrial agglomeration also produces knowledge and technology spillovers. The geographical proximity of land users will promote the generation of knowledge and technology spillover effects, which is beneficial to the improvement of land use benefits. Based on this, the hypothesis is proposed as follows.\nH2: Industrial agglomeration is conducive to improving land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations.\nThe process of urban economic development is not only manifested in the growth of the total economic volume, but also in the upgrading and transformation of the industrial structure. The evolution of the industrial structure shows a certain regularity: with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization, the primary industry is gradually transformed into the secondary industry and the tertiary industry, and convert in turn to the stage where laborintensive industries dominate and capital-intensive industries dominate and technology-intensive industries dominate. Industrial development should rely on land, and the qualitative transformation of industrial structure needs to be reflected through changes in land use. That is to say, the evolution of industrial structure will eventually lead to changes in land use structure. Therefore, differences in industrial structure will lead to differences in land use structure and land use methods, and have different effects on the use efficiency of land resource. Based on this, the hypothesis is proposed as follows.\nH3: Industrial structure change is conducive to improving land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations.\nTechnological progress is the source of economic growth and the key to improving the economic efficiency of urban agglomerations. As the size of themetropolitan area expands, the proportion of innovators increases, making it easier to promote productivity (33). A network of cities or urban agglomeration with closely connected cities has greater diversity and creativity than individual cities, more freedom of location and less congestion (34). Batten (35) pointed out that the network city was a creative urban agglomeration in the 21st century, which had better superiority in technological cooperation innovation, so that cities in the urban agglomeration would benefit from technical exchanges and technology spillovers between cities (35). For example, European urban agglomerations are the \u201cengine\u201d of the European economy, and the growth of urban agglomeration economies is the result of the concentration of research-intensive and knowledge-intensive industries (36). Therefore, the technological progress of individual cities within the urban agglomeration will bring the technological progress of the urban agglomeration, and the proximity of the cities within the urban agglomeration is very conducive to mutual technical cooperation and technology spillover, which will further accelerate the technological progress of the urban agglomeration, and thus promote the land use economic\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 04 frontiersin.org\nefficiency of urban agglomerations. Technological progress can be measured by the level of technological innovation and technological cooperation between cities in the urban agglomeration. Based on this, the hypotheses are proposed as follows.\nH4: Technological innovation is conducive to improving land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations.\nH5: Technological cooperation is conducive to improving land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations.\nUrban agglomerations are the product of social, economic and spatial organization changes, and therefore must be influenced by institutions or policies. Urban agglomerations occur in the institutional network of market economy and government, and the minimum transaction cost is the main driving force (37). Scholars believe that the marketization mechanism and the government policy system of urban agglomeration reflect institutional changes, and the advantages or convenience brought by various institutions and policies will ultimately have an important impact on land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations. However, themarketization institution itself is a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d Based on this, the hypothesis is proposed as follows.\nH6: Marketization institution is conducive to improving land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations.\nUrban agglomerations are gradually formed as the links between cities become increasingly close. The transportation and information infrastructure are the basis and driving force for the formation and evolution of urban agglomerations, which constitute the channel of communication between cities. Good transport infrastructure network conditions in urban agglomerations are an important factor in promoting the expansion of economic activity between cities in the region (38). The improvement of public transport in urban agglomerations can improve the availability of labor, increase information exchange and promote industrial division and professional development, so that the urban agglomeration can obtain economic benefits (39, 40). Of course, the radiation effect of transportation infrastructure in urban agglomerations is also conducive to the improvement of land use economic efficiency. Infrastructure can be measured from two main perspectives, namely, the density of transportation infrastructure and the level of information infrastructure. Based on this, the hypotheses are proposed as follows.\nH7: Transportation infrastructure is conducive to improving land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations. H8: Information infrastructure is conducive to improving land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations."

The function expression is as follows.\nHt = 2\n\u221a\nF1(t, x)F2(t, y) [\nF1(t, x)+F2(t, y) ]2 (1)\nWhere Ht is the coupling index of the COVID-19 epidemic and land market of cities in urban agglomerations at time t; F1(t, x) is the comprehensive evaluation value of the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic at time t (indicated by the number\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 05 frontiersin.org\nof confirmed cases in one million people); F2(t, y) is the comprehensive evaluation value of the degree of impact on the landmarket of cities in urban agglomerations at time t (indicated by the growth rate of comprehensive land prices). Dispersion standardization is performed on the original data of Ht , and the result falls into the [0, 1] interval through linear transformation of the original data.\nAccording to the coupling index, the type of coordination between the severity of the epidemic and the degree of impact on the land market of cities in urban agglomerations can be classified (Table 1). When Ht = 1, the coupling index is the largest, indicating that the two systems are fully coordinated at time t, and the severity of the epidemic is completely consistent with the degree of impact on the land market of cities in urban agglomerations.When 0.5 \u2264 Ht < 1, the coupling index is large, indicating that the two systems are more coordinated at time t, and the severity of the epidemic and the degree of impact on the land market of cities in urban agglomerations is \u201cSynchronous type.\u201d When 0 \u2264 Ht < 0.5, the coupling index is small, and the sensitivity of landmarket of cities in urban agglomerations to the COVID-19 epidemic can be judged according to the magnitudes of F1(t, x) and F2(t, y). If F1(t, x) > F2(t, y), it means that the severe epidemic does not have a great impact on the land market of cities in urban agglomerations, and the relationship between the two systems can be classified as \u201cstrong type.\u201d If F1(t, x) < F2(t, y), it means that the mild epidemic has a greater impact on the land market of cities in urban agglomerations, and the relationship between the two systems can be classified as \u201cfragile type.\u201d\nDriving factors of land use economic e ciency of urban agglomerations\u2013panel data model\nThe land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations is the performance of the realization degree of land value in economic development, and it is an intuitive reflection of the economic efficiency of industrial activities. As a measure, it is the ratio of output to input. The land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations can be measured not only by single factor productivity, but also by total factor productivity. In essence, the land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations is also achieved through a series of micro-mechanisms and approaches. Based on literature and theoretical analysis, this paper argues that the comprehensive effects of industrial\nagglomeration, industrial structure, technological progress, marketization institution and infrastructure jointly explain the changes and differences in the land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations. According to the theoretical analysis framework and research hypotheses, this paper constructs the following panel data models:\nlnLGDPit = \u03b20 + \u03b21lnIAit + \u03b22lnKLit + \u03b23lnTPit + \u03b24lnTCit\n+ \u03b25lnMIit + \u03b26lnTIit + \u03b27lnIIit + \u03b5it (2)\nlnLTFPit = \u03b20 + \u03b21lnIAit + \u03b22lnKLit + \u03b23lnTPit + \u03b24lnTCit\n+ \u03b25lnMIit + \u03b26lnTIit + \u03b27lnIIit + \u03b5it (3)\n\u03b5it = \u00b5i + \u03bbt + uit (4)\nwhere LGDPit is the land use economic productivity (single factor productivity) of the i-th urban agglomeration in the t-th year, and LTFPit is the land use economic productivity (total factor productivity) of the i-th urban agglomeration in the tth year; IAit is the industrial agglomeration level of the i-th urban agglomeration in the t-th year (Krugman Specialization Index), and KLit is the industrial structure change level (capitallabor ratio) of the i-th urban agglomeration in the t-th year, and TPit is the number of patent application for the unit land area of the i-th urban agglomeration in the t-th year, and TCit is the technical market inflow for the unit land area of the i-th urban agglomeration in the t-th year, and MIit is the marketization index of the i-th urban agglomeration in the tth year, TIit is the transportation infrastructure for the unit land area of the i-th urban agglomeration in the t-th year, and IIit is the information infrastructure for the unit land area of the ith urban agglomeration in the t-th year.

Single factor productivity is an absolute efficiency indicator, and its benefit is real, easy to understand and compare. The other type is the total factor productivity measurement\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 06 frontiersin.org\nmethod. Themainmeasurementmethods include growth kernel algorithm, frontier analysis and index method. As a frontier analysis method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) uses the optimization method to determine the weight of various input factors endogenously, avoiding the specific expression of the relationship between input and output, and eliminating the interference of many subjective factors on the measurement method. It also has advantages such as no relationship with market price, and is especially suitable for economic efficiency evaluation of complex economies. This paper uses both single factor productivity and total factor productivity methods, so as to more comprehensively measure LUEE of urban agglomerations.\nFirst, referring to the research of scholars such as Pain (45), this paper uses the single factor productivity method to measure LUEE of urban agglomerations. LUEE is measured by the ratio of the sum of gross domestic product (GDP) to the total land area of urban agglomerations.\nSecond, the total factor productivity method is used to measure LUEE of urban agglomerations. This paper uses the DEA-Mamquist model to measure LUEE (total factor productivity) of urban agglomerations. The input factors are labor, capital and land, and the output factor is GDP. The capital stock is estimated using Goldsmith\u2019s Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM). The DEA-Malmquist model can be used to measure the change in total factor productivity of urban agglomerations in China from 2001 to 2020. The land use total factor productivity (LTFP) of an urban agglomeration can be expressed as:\nLTFPit = LTFPit\u22121 \u00d7 TFPCHit (5)\nWhere LTFPit is the land use total factor productivity of the i-th urban agglomeration in the t-th year, and TFPCHit is the Malmquist index of the i-th urban agglomeration in the t-th year. This paper sets 2001 as the base period, that is, LTFPi2001 = 1. i = 1, 2, . . . , 10, representing 10 urban agglomerations; t = 1, 2, . . . , 20, representing time 2001, 2002, . . . , 2020.\nIndustrial agglomeration of urban agglomerations\nThere are many methods for calculating the level of industrial agglomeration. The representative methods are the structural similarity coefficient method proposed by the International Industrial Research Center of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the Krugman Specialization Index proposed by Paul Krugman, structural coincidence index proposed by Finger and Kreinin, and location entropy method, etc. Among them, most studies believe that the Krugman Specialization Index method performs best in measuring the level of regional industrial\nagglomeration. Therefore, this paper also uses the Krugman Specialization Index to measure the industrial agglomeration of urban agglomerations. The calculation formula is as follows.\nIAr = 1\nm\n\u2211\nm i=1\n\u2211\nn k=1|Xik \u2212 Xk| (6)\nWhere IAij is the industrial agglomeration level of the r-th urban agglomeration (Krugman specialization index, which is the average value of the industrial agglomeration level of each city in the urban agglomeration); m is the number of cities in the urban agglomeration, k is the number of industries, and k = 1,2,3. . . ,n; Xik is the proportion of the number of employees in the k-th industry in i-th city to the number of employees in the entire industry, and Xk is the proportion of the number of employees in the k-th industry in all cities in the urban agglomeration to the number of employees in the entire industry in all cities.\nIndustrial structure change of urban agglomerations\nThe industrial structure change of urban agglomerations is measured by the capital-labor ratio (KL), which reflects the degree of the transformation of the regional industrial structure from labor-intensive industries to capitalintensive industries, so as to measure the impact of the regional industrial structure change on the land use economic efficiency.\nTechnological progress of urban agglomerations\nThe technological progress of urban agglomerations is measured by two indicators. One is the number of patent applications per unit of land area in the urban agglomeration (TP). That is, TP is the ratio of the total number of patent applications to the total land area of the urban agglomeration. And the other is the contract income of technical market inflow per unit of land area in the urban agglomeration (TC). That is, TC is the ratio of the total contract income of the technology market inflow to the total land area of the urban agglomeration.\nMarketization institution of urban agglomerations\nThe institution is a very abstract variable, and its content and dimensions are also very rich. There are also many scholars in the academic world who are trying to measure the institution level of each urban agglomeration, and the measurement indicators used are also different. Referring to the practices of other scholars, this paper uses the marketization index in the\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 07 frontiersin.org\n\u201cChina Marketization Index Report\u201d as the marketization institution variable (MI). Therefore, the marketization institution indicator score of each urban agglomeration is the arithmetic mean of the corresponding marketization index of the provinces or municipalitys included in the urban agglomeration."

Even within the same urban agglomeration, individual city shows differences. Hypothesis H1 passes the test. From the perspective of the coupling index, the cities where the severity of the epidemic has little impact on the land market (strong type) are all located in the eastern and central regions of China. These regions are population inflow areas with developed economies and strong support for land market demand. Cities where the severity of the epidemic and the impact on the land\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 08 frontiersin.org\nmarket are relatively consistent (synchronized type) are mainly located in the central region of China, and a few cities are located in the eastern or western regions. The impact of the land market in these cities is basically the same as the severity of the epidemic. Most of the cities where the severity of the epidemic has a greater impact on the landmarket (fragile type) are located in the western region of China, and a small epidemic can cause large fluctuations in the land market.\nAnalysis of driving factors of land use economic e ciency\nAccording to the theoretical hypothesis and the panel measurement model, this paper analyzes the LUEE (single factor productivity and total factor productivity) and its driving factors of urban agglomerations. In order to minimize the interference of heteroscedasticity on the regression estimation results, the regression equations use robustness estimates."

In this paper, the four kinds of stationarity test methods of Levin-LinChu panel unit root test (LLC), Im-Pesaran-Shin panel unit root test (IPS), Fisher-Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF-Fisher) and Fisher-Phillips-Perron test (PP-Fisher) are used to ensure the accuracy of the test conclusion.

It can be seen that the indexs are the same order. The cointegration test of the interpreted and explanatory variables can be performed before the regression analysis.\nCointegration test between indexs\nThe Pedroni cointegration test method is the most commonly used co-integration test method, which can provide multiple test statistics at the same time, thus enhancing the scientificity of the test conclusion.

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "This paper focuses on the evaluation of land use economic efficiency and its driving factors of urban agglomerations, and the selected samples are 10 urban agglomerations in China. To sum up, this paper draws the following main research conclusions.\nFirst, the COVID-19 epidemic has a great impact on the land market of various cities in China\u2019s urban agglomerations, but it has shown great differences. Due to the profound changes in globalization and competition, although China\u2019s economic operation has temporarily overcome the impact of the epidemic, the foundation for economic recovery is not yet solid. The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly and in many ways, posing a serious threat to human life and health. China\u2019s land system has made positive contributions to epidemic prevention and control, and played the role of safety valve, reservoir, and stabilizer. However, this epidemic has also brought challenges to China\u2019s land system, and it is urgent to propose countermeasures and suggestions to improve the land system.\nSecond, the empirical test of the driving factors of land use economic efficiency of in China\u2019s urban agglomerations found that some theoretical hypotheses passed the test, and some theoretical hypotheses were not supported. Industrial agglomeration, industrial structure change, technological progress, and transportation infrastructure play a significant role in promoting the land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations. The marketization institution does not have a significant driving effect on the land use economic efficiency (single factor productivity) in urban agglomerations, nor does information infrastructure drive the land use economic efficiency (single factor productivity and total factor productivity) of urban agglomerations.\nThird, whether using single factor productivity or total factor productivity, the test results of the driving factors of land use economic efficiency in China\u2019s urban agglomerations show consistency. Specifically, whether single factor productivity or total factor productivity is used to measure land use economic efficiency of urban agglomerations, the driving effects of industrial agglomeration, industrial structure change, technological progress, and transportation infrastructure are all significant. The driving effect of information infrastructure on land use economic efficiency (single factor productivity and total factor productivity) in urban agglomerations is also consistent, but the statistical result is not significant. The driving effect of the marketization institution on land use economic efficiency (single factor productivity and total factor productivity) in urban agglomerations is also consistent, but the statistical significance test is inconsistent.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 11 frontiersin.org\nAccording to the calculation results of land use economic efficiency in China\u2019s urban agglomerations and the analysis of driving factors, each urban agglomeration should be improved according to the decomposition of land use economic efficiency and specific driving factors. Because the driving factors are multi-dimensional, it is not only necessary to consider from a single factor, but also to analyze the total from the systematic perspective. Overall, the improvement of land use economic efficiency of China\u2019s urban agglomerations should be considered from the following aspects: First, it is necessary to take a series of measures to reform the marketoriented allocation of land elements, and improve a longterm mechanism for the smooth operation of the land market. The supply of land resources is tightening, and promoting the high-quality utilization of industrial land has become an important factor for China to stabilize investment, stabilize expectations, ensure employment, ensure supply of industrial chains, and ensure grassroots operation services. Second, on the basis of scientific assessment of the level of industrial agglomeration in urban agglomerations, strengthen industrial division and cooperation, and give better play to the role of industrial agglomeration effect, and take the prevention of congestion effect as the core content of land use management in urban agglomerations. Third, it is necessary to optimize the industrial structure of urban agglomerations, promote the rationalization and advancedization of the industrial structure, and improve the intensification level of land use. The fourth is to improve the technological innovation structure of urban agglomerations, increase investment in technological innovation, continuously improve the incentive mechanism for technological innovation, and enhance the ability of technological progress to support the sustainable development of urban agglomerations. Fifth, the combination of market mechanism and government macro-control provides an institutional basis for the high-quality development of urban agglomerations. Sixth, continue to improve the infrastructure construction of urban agglomeration, such as transportation and information communication, and use its radiation effect to promote economic interaction between cities in the urban agglomeration.\nHowever, further research is needed as follows. First, environmental factor is not incorporated into the analytical framework of the land use economic efficiency. Future research will consider incorporating environmental and social factors into the analytical framework of land use efficiency, and analyze the coupling and coordination relationship between the land use economic efficiency, the high-quality development of the economy, and the ecological environment. The second is the spatial effects of land use economic efficiency in urban agglomerations. In the future, the spatial correlation, spatial structure characteristics\nand spatial effects of land use economic efficiency will be studied."
