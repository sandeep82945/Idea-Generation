Their main result indicates an increase mortality within 30\u00a0 days following discharge from the referring ICU in the subgroups of clinical and capacity transfers, with adjusted odds ratio of 1.17 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.36) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.06\u20131.49), respectively.\nAs the authors notice, the main result is somewhat surprising as higher mortality has not been reported in recent literature [2, 3]. Reasons could be explained as follow: first, the authors specify that 20% of capacity transfers occurred at night, involving severe critically ill patients with acute lung injury, sepsis, and cardiogenic\nshock. In light of these results, one could wonder whether it is safe or not for the patient to undergo a night ICU-toICU transfer compared to withholding the interhospital transport for a few hours until the sun rises, since nightshift patient\u2019s discharge has been associated with a higher mortality [4].\nSecond, the authors pointed out that Sweden has a low number of ICU bed which could play a role in the higher mortality rate found following interhospital capacity and clinical transfers [5].\nSolutions to tackle this higher mortality related to interhospital transfer would be to build up local resources for critical care: increasing ICU beds, recruiting ICU highly trained staff and Intensivist doctors to avoid transfers of critically ill patients at nights with severe unstable pathologies (especially during wintertime when respiratory sepsis and acute respiratory distress occur more frequently [6]).\nFurthermore, the authors\u2019 message must be balanced when facing crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming that interhospital transfers are unsafe and choosing a strategy of implementation of new ICU beds to face surge of critically ill patients could lead to a higher mortality [7]. During the first months of the COVID-19 crisis, countries planned and organized large-scale interhospital transfers either for clinical or capacity reasons and demonstrated that transferred patients did not have a higher mortality rate [2, 3, 8]. However, we agree with the authors and acknowledge that \u201cunderstanding the impact of ICU-to-ICU transfer on patient outcome is complex and must consider a couple of important aspects\u201d such as identifying appropriate control patients.\nOpen Access\nThis comment refers to the article available online at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13613\u2011 022\u2011 01003\u2011x.\n*Correspondence: benoit.painvin@chu\u2011rennes.fr; jean\u2011marc.tadie@chu\u2011 rennes.fr\n1 Service des Maladies Infectieuses et de R\u00e9animation M\u00e9dicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes, H\u00f4pital Pontchaillou, 2 rue Henri le Guilloux, 35033 Rennes, France Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 2Painvin\u00a0et\u00a0al.
