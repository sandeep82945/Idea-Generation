1. **Extending the model to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in the coefficients.** The proposed model assumes that the coefficients of the covariates are constant across space. However, in many applications, it is likely that the coefficients will vary across space, reflecting the different characteristics of different regions. Extending the model to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in the coefficients would allow for a more flexible and realistic representation of the data.
2. **Developing a Bayesian approach to estimation.** The proposed model is estimated using a frequentist approach. However, a Bayesian approach to estimation could offer several advantages, such as the ability to incorporate prior information and to quantify uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Developing a Bayesian approach to estimation would be a valuable extension of the proposed model.
3. **Investigating the use of alternative spatial weight matrices.** The proposed model uses a contiguity-based spatial weight matrix. However, there are many other types of spatial weight matrices that could be used, such as distance-based weight matrices or kernel-based weight matrices. Investigating the use of alternative spatial weight matrices would help to determine the robustness of the proposed model to the choice of spatial weight matrix.
4. **Applying the model to other types of data.** The proposed model is applied to age distribution data in the empirical analysis. However, the model could be applied to other types of data, such as income data, health data, or crime data. Applying the model to other types of data would help to demonstrate the versatility of the model and its potential for use in a wide range of applications.
5. **Developing a model for spatial interactions among multiple functional outcomes.** The proposed model considers spatial interactions among a single functional outcome. However, in many applications, it may be of interest to consider spatial interactions among multiple functional outcomes. Developing a model for spatial interactions among multiple functional outcomes would be a challenging but important extension of the proposed model.
