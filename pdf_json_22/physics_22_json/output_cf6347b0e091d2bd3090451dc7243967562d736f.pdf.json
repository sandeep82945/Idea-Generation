    "abstractText": "The Institute of Plasma Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences is developing the REBCO cable in conduit conductor (CICC) technology for applications in next-generation nuclear fusion devices. The aim is to develop a CICC comprised of six REBCO sub-cables to satisfy the requirements of operation with a current of around 40 kA and a peak field of up to 20 T. To qualify the performance of the sub-size REBCO cable to be used in the CICC, two 25-turn insert solenoids have been designed, manufactured and tested at a current exceeding 6 kA subjected in a background field supplied by a water-cooled resistive magnet. The insert solenoid, wound from a 11.5 m long REBCO CORC\u00ae cable, was designed to investigate its current carrying capacity under high field and electromagnetic (EM) load at 4.2 K. Tests were performed under a background magnetic field up to 18.5 T, resulting in a peak magnetic field on the innermost layer turns of around 21.1 T at an operating current of 6.3 kA. The effects of operation with cyclic EM loads were tested by repeated current ramps to around 95% of the critical current. Moreover, the V\u2013I characteristics were measured at 77 K and the self-field, to check the effects from warm-up and cool-down (WUCD) cycles between room temperature and 77 K with liquid nitrogen. The results show no obvious degradation after dozens of high-current test cycles in background fields ranging from 10 T to 18.5 T. The insert solenoid demonstrates the stable operation of the REBCO sub-size cable for CICC with EM loads of about 90 kN m\u22121 and WUCD cycles between room temperature and 77 K.

            "text": "Based on the development of commercial manufacturing technologies of high-temperature superconductors (HTS), more designs of fusion reactors are considering REBCO tapes [1, 2]. REBCO conductors have the potential to enable magnet operation with peak fields above 15 T, beyond the reach of more conventional Nb3Sn conductors like the ones presently used for ITER [3]. To promote REBCO tapes for high field applications, tests have been carried out to study their critical current (Ic) carrying properties as a function of temperature, magnetic field and operational stress/strain conditions [4\u20137]. The commercially available 4 mm wide REBCO tapes can operate at 4.2 K and 18 T with a Ic of around 300 A. However, tests show that the current carrying capacity largely depends on the deformation caused by the compression, tension or torsion loads induced during manufacturing and high magnet field operation of cables in conduit conductor (CICC) conductors and magnets [8]. The irreversible strain limits partly depend on the manufacturing processes developed by different suppliers. These provide references for optimal cable configuration design and the development of manufacturing technology.\nTo satisfy the requirements of carrying a high current to generate high magnetic field for fusion magnets, several design concepts, i.e. twisted stacked tape conductor [9], Roebel [10], conductor on round core (CORC\u00ae) [11], and symmetric tape round (STAR) [12] cables have been proposed. Among them, the CORC\u00ae and STAR concepts have round cross-sections, made up of a round central core and spiralwound HTS tapes, resulting in a more isotropic behavior in all bending directions. To demonstrate their current-carrying capacity under a high magnetic field, cyclic tests of a STAR cable wound from 2.5 mm wide tapes were carried out in a magnetic field of up to 31.2 T [13], reaching a stable critical current of around 900 A. CORC\u00ae cables were manufactured in straight, bended or wound into insert solenoid configurations and then tested in liquid nitrogen and/or liquid helium with different backgroundmagnetic fields. The aim is to verify the feasibility of the CORC\u00ae cable concept for application in high field magnets. In 2013, CORC cables were wound into 1.5-turn loops and 12-turn, double-layer coils and tested in a magnetic field of up to 20 T [14], and Lorentz forces achieved around 40 kN per turn. Then, in 2016, a cable comprised of 38 REBCO tapes was demonstrated to carry a current of around 8 kA at 4.2 K in a background field of 10 T at CERN [15]. Meanwhile, the cable sustained 11 quenches initiated using heaters without Ic degradation. In 2020, a four-layer, 45-turn insert solenoid was tested at 4.2 K and reached a peak field of 16.77 T on the conductor while operatingwith a critical current\nof 4.4 kA [16]. With help from external support incorporated between layers, no significant performance degradation was observed on the solenoid after high-current tests carried out in fields ranging from 10 to 14 T. In addition, a cable containing eight 3 mm-wide and 75 \u00b5m-thick tapes was wound into a two-layer, nine-turn solenoid [17]. It exhibited stable current carrying properties while experiencing electromagnetic (EM) load at a field up to 19 T. All these results demonstrate the potential of the CORC cable for fusion magnets with an operational field exceeding 15 T.\nConsidering the complex configuration of fusion magnets, high-flexibility of sub-size cables is required to produce large size CICC and to enable coil winding. Characteristics such as current sharing between tapes, superior mechanical properties and low energy losses at AC operation conditions are needed for maintaining stable operation, especially for the central solenoid (CS) coils of a tokamak-type fusion reactor [18]. Therefore, the CORC concept [19\u201321] has been taken as a reference for sub-size cable design for the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor CS coil, which is expected to operate with a current of higher than 40 kA and a peak field above 17 T [22].\nAlthough the CORC\u00ae concept shows good prospects for application in high field magnets, investigations also showed that the cabling and jacketing processes to produce a CICC affected the current carrying capability [23, 24], especially while operating with high cyclic EM loads. Here, CICC sub-size cables using commercial REBCO tapes have been designed, manufactured and coiled into two insert solenoids for testing at 4.2 K and in different background fields supplied by a water-cooled resistive magnet. Critical currents were measured at 77 K in the self-field and 4.2 K in background magnetic fields of up to 18.5 T. Effects from high EM loading up to around 90 kN m\u22121 and from stresses generated during warm-up and cool-down (WUCD) cycles between room temperature and liquid nitrogen on current-carrying stability were investigated. Suggestions for improving cabling technologies and CICC performances for future applications were also identified."

Then a cable wound from 30 REBCO tapes was designed (see table 1) and manufactured. The tapes are 4 mm wide and\nCopper former diameter 3.85 mm Number of superconductor layers 12 Number of REBCO tapes 30 (tapes per layer \u00d7 layer: 2 \u00d7 6 + 3 \u00d7 6) Number of copper layers 1 (3 tapes per layer) Number of insulation layers 3 (Over-lapped polyimide tapes) Outer diameter 7.2 mm\naround 100 \u00b5m thick (while the thickness of the Hastelloy substrate is 50 \u00b5m). They were wound into 12 layers around a 3.85 mm central core. The inner six layers had two tapes and the outer six layers had three tapes for each layer. After the cabling of the REBCO tapes, one layer of copper tapes combined with three over-lapped layers of polyimide tapes were designed and wound outside the REBCO cable for mechanical concerns and insulation, respectively.\nThe bore of the water-cooled resistive magnet in the Hefei high field lab is around 200 mm, and the inner diameter of dewar is 160 mm for the insert coil testing. A 2D finite element model has been conducted for the analysis of the magnetic field and hoop stress by using the ANSYS ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL). Figure 1 shows the model and the results of the stress with a 5 kA operation current for the insert solenoid coil, which had four layers and 25 turns in total, and an inner diameter of 95 mm.\nThe geometry and boundary conditions for hoop stress and EM analysis are as shown in figure 1(a). Outside of the coil, there was a stainless steel shell with a thickness of 1mm. Properties for each material [25\u201329] used in the ANSYS modeling are provided in table 2. The results are shown in figure 1(b); a maximum hoop stress of about 182 MPa occurs on the cable in the inner layer.\nAs shown in figure 2, the computed peak field on the cable is around 2.1 T with a current of 5 kA, corresponding to 0.42 T kA\u22121 while it is 0.26 T kA\u22121 for the field in the coil center."

To mimic the operating conditions of the sub-size cable in a CICC, no additional supports were added between the coil layers. To consolidate the two coil ends, plates (see figures 4(a) and (b)) were machined and attached to the structure; the plates also\nguide and support the cable in the transitions between coil layers during winding. The coil layers were wet wound with Stycast 2850. Finally, the coils were protected against hoop stress by overbanding with stainless steel tapes. For the terminations, the same procedure was followed as described in [17]. To avoid effects at the transition sections, the radius for every arc-shaped part was set to be higher than 90 mm."

Then, the dewar was mounted inside the 200 mm bore of a water-cooled resistive magnet built by the HighMagnetic Field Laboratory at theChinese Academy of Sciences. The magnet can provide a highly homogeneous background field of up to 20 T. Eight power supplies were connected in parallel to provide a maximum current of 9.6 kA for testing the insert coil current carrying performance. A protection system was designed to be activated to automatically cut off the supplied current when the voltage across the power supply exceeds 5 V. Further, voltages across the solenoid coil and the two terminations were monitored through pairs of voltage taps attached at the termination ends. Among them, two pairs were\nplaced across the full length of the cable, but did not include the two terminations, and were used for Ic measurements. The other two were used to measure the joint resistance of terminations. The current can also be switched off manually when the measured voltage across the solenoid coil exceeds the criterion of 1 \u00b5V cm\u22121. In addition, a hall sensor was assembled in the center of the solenoid coil for magnetic field measurement.\nTests have been carried out including: Ic measurements at 77 K and 4.2 K with current ramp rates around 50 A s\u22121; EM cycling tests at 4.2 K and background fields ranging from 10 T to 18.5 T; Ic measurements at 77 K in the self-field after every WUCD cycle between 77 K and room temperature. The Ic and the n-value were calculated by means of the fitting equation provided in [17] from the recorded V\u2013I data. The voltage used for Ic determination was based on an estimated distance of 10.7 m between voltage taps and an electric field criterion of 1 \u00b5V cm\u22121. The n-value is determined from an electric field interval between 0.1 and 1 \u00b5V cm\u22121."

Figure 5 shows the measured central field as a function of coil current at 4.2 K, which corresponds to a transfer function of 0.258 T kA\u22121. This value is consistent with that derived from the ANSYS analysis (see section 2.1), which confirms that the maximum peak field on the cable of the insert coils during operation was around 0.42 T kA\u22121."

Due to the fact that the voltage wires were not co-wound with the cable, an inductive voltage of around 0.7 mV was measured and subtracted from the signals for the critical current determination. Figure 6 presents the electrical field versus the current measured on the two solenoid coils referred to as YIC-01 and YIC-02 for the first cooldown. The results show a good reproducibility between the two solenoid coils, resulting in an estimated Ic of 1603 and 1645 A, respectively. These were taken as a reference critical current (Ico) for the WUCD tests that followed. The calculated n-values are consistent with 18.4 and 17.4, respectively.\nThe REBCO tapes used for the two solenoid coils have a Ic ranging from 150 to 210 A at 77 K in the self-field (provided by the supplier). The sum of the tape Ics used for the cable was around 4980 A as in the single tape self-field. The manufactured two unit lengths of cables have a comparable Ic at 77 K in the self-field, both in straight samples (see figure 3) and solenoid coils (see figure 5). It indicates that the cable and coil winding processes have not induced obvious performance degradation on the tapes.\nIn total, sevenWUCD cycles of between room temperature and 77Kwere carried out on theYIC-01 coil and five cycles on the YIC-02 coil. The Ic and n-value were measured when the solenoid coil was immersed in liquid nitrogen. For the YIC-01 coil, the measured Ic in average was 1565\u00b1 37 A, over all the cycles. A degradation of around 6%was observed on themeasured Ic, while the n-value reduced to around 11. During tests, a different direct current shunt was used for the number three and four cycles, causing an anomalous and higher degradation on the measured critical current. It has been recovered for the cycles that followed when reusing the old direct current shunt. Figure 7 summarizes the normalized Ic for the WUCD cycles carried out on the YIC-01 coil. For the YIC-02 coil, no obvious degradation was observed from the measured Ic and n-value after five WUCD cycles."

            "text": "During the YIC-01 coil test, a fault occurred on the watercooled resistive magnet, and the maximum background field achieved was only up to 10 T during this test campaign. Thus, tests for this insert solenoid were carried out at 4.2 K and a background field of 10 T. As shown in figure 8(a), a superconducting to normal transition was observed for currents above about 7000 A. The corresponding Ic was estimated to be around 7879 A and the n-value was about 13.6. However, the shutting off of the current was not done in a timely manner,\ncausing a quench of the insert solenoid. To assess the effects from the quench, the procedure was repeated, leading to a second quench. Small variations were observed between the recorded curves of voltage across the solenoid as a function of current. The calculated Ic and n-value during the test with the second quench were 7638 A and 10.1, respectively. But after the second quench, the measured Ic and n-value decreased to around 7407 A and 7, respectively.\nTo investigate the Ic of the insert solenoid at 4.2 K and a maximum magnetic field on the cable exceeding 20 T, the second solenoid coil (YIC-02) was tested after the issue on the water-cooled resistive magnet was fixed, enabling the generation of a background field up to 18.5 T. As shown in figure 8(b), the measured voltage was relatively stable for currents less than 4000 A, a level above which large voltage spikes were recorded. These spikes affected the measurements of voltage across the solenoid coil, and a quench happened without obvious indication of superconducting-tonormal transition. During the current ramp-up, the current was maintained at 6.3 kA for around 5 min before the quench. Finally, the maximum current achieved was around 6.7 kA, which corresponded to a peak field on the innermost cable of 21.3 T (18.5 T background field + 2.8 T generated field by the insert coil). The measured Ic and n-value from the fitted\ncurve shown in figure 8(b) for the YIC-02 insert solenoid were 6512 kA and 4.1, respectively. The measurement shows that an insert solenoid coil wound from 30 REBCO tapes with a 4 mm width and 50 \u00b5m thick substrate has shown an estimated Ic of 6.5 kA at 4.2 K and a peak field of about 21.2 T. Based on extrapolation of the tape performance from Ic measurements at 4.2K and 10 Twith a lift factor of about 0.6 extracted from [5], the expected Ic of the cable without considering the thermal and EM stresses on the tapes at a field of 21.2 T is around 9 kA. This indicates that the inserted solenoid coil retained at least 75% of the initial tape performances.\nAfter this ramp, the background field was lowered to 18 T and the Ic test was repeated, but the superconducting to normal transition became visible when the solenoid coil was energized to a current of about 4200 A, which indicated a current reduction of 35% as a consequence of the undetected quench."

            "text": "It is noticed that both solenoid coils experienced a current carrying performance degradation after a quench. That is 8% for YIC-01 and 35% for YIC-02. Simultaneously, the n-values were both decreased to lower than 10, at 4.2 K and 10 T for YIC-01 and at 4.2 K and 18 T for YIC-02. This is most likely caused by the local thermal stress concentrations during quenching. In spite of the quench-induced current performance degradation, further tests were carried out to investigate the effects of cyclic EM load. To avoid more quenches, the current was ramped up to a constant value of around 95% of the calculated Ic at a rate of 50 A s\u22121.\nFor the YIC-01 solenoid coil, 50 current cycles between 0 and 7000 Awere carried out at 4.2 K and in a background field of 10 T. From the recorded V\u2013I curves, the critical currents appear fairly stable, ranging from 7336 to 7446 A as shown in figure 9, and no obvious degradation was observed.\nFor the YIC-02 solenoid coil, a total of 18 EM cycles have been carried out at 4.2 K and in background fields of 10 T, 12 T, 15 T and 18 T. Figure 10(a) shows the measured V\u2013I curves and figure 10(b) shows the measured Ic and n-values corresponding to the EM cycles at different background fields. The relatively stable critical current values indicate that no further degradationwas observed on the coil for these given levels of EM loads, ranging from 60 kN m\u22121 to 80 kN m\u22121. However, the recorded V\u2013I curves are not smooth enough, which may be affected by the weak points generated during quenching. They can cause a current re-distribution during current loading, and further induce voltage oscillation. Thus, the fitted n-value fluctuated between 5 and 20.\nBoth solenoid coils demonstrated stable operation under cyclic EM loading in excess of above 80 kN m\u22121 at 4.2 K, with a peak field of 19.8 T, even after the initial degradation caused by quenching discussed above. This stability confirms the potential for HTS cable applications under severe EM conditions but underlines the importance of quench detection and protection. In addition, large voltage spikes, as recorded and shown in figure 8 for currents exceeding 4 kA, may indicate\nsome information about the origin of the phenomenon. It is quite remarkable that such spikes were not observed upon subsequent testing at background fields ranging from 10 T to 18 T, as shown in figure 10(a)."

To assess the performance of REBCO CORC\u00ae cables during operation with high EM and thermal cyclic loads, two insert solenoid coils with an inner diameter of 95 mm have been wound each from 11.5 m unit lengths of CORC\u00ae cables. The two solenoid coils were tested at 77 K in the self-field, as well as 4.2 K in background fields up to 18.5 T supplied by a water cooled resistive magnet. At 77 K, self-field conditions, the performance of the solenoid coils is consistent with the expectations from the test results of straight cables indicating that the fabrication processes did not cause degradation. A Ic of around 6.5 kA was achieved at 4.2 K with a maximum peak field on the conductor of 21.2 T.\nWUCD cycles between room temperature and liquid nitrogen do not appear to affect cable performance. However, quenches result in a Ic degradation. The degradation may be induced to a minor extent by local tape defects from cable and coil fabrication.More likely factors are local thermal stress concentrations during quench and EM loads. Powering cycles carried out after this initial quench-induced degradation do not lead to further degradation for cyclic EM loading up to about 80 kN m\u22121 and a conductor peak field of about 19.8 T. The results demonstrate that such cables can perform reproducibly under high magnetic fields and with high-carrying currents. For high field magnet application, it is critical to avoid local defects in the tapes during cable and magnet manufacture.\nData availability statement\nAll data that support the findings of this study are included within the article (and any supplementary files)."
