    "abstractText": "Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that manifests mainly as chronic inflammation in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract, and its incidence has come to be increasing in recent years. Ferroptosis, a novel type of programmed cell death, it seems the role of ferroptosis\u2010related biomarkers in CD has not been mentioned. Thus, the role of ferroptosis in CD and its relationship with immune infiltration were explored in this study. The CD dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The validated ferroptosis genes (FRGs) were retrieved from the public FerrDb database. The gene expression matrix of the CD dataset was analyzed with the \u201climma\u201d package in R language to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between diseased and healthy samples. Then, intersecting genes between DEGs and FRGs were identified as differentially expressed ferroptosis\u2010associated genes (DE\u2010FRGs). Protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and visualization were carried out with STRING and Cytoscape, and key CD ferroptosis\u2010related genes (CD\u2010FRGs) were identified along with their Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using the clusterProfiler package. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed with CIBERSORT. The correlation between key CD\u2010FRGs and immune\u2010infiltrated cells in CD was studied by Spearman\u2019s correlation method. A total of 37 DE\u2010FRGs and 6 key CD\u2010FRGs (CAV1, CD44, HIF1A, IFNG, TIMP1 and TLR4) were identified. GO and KEGG functional analysis indicated these genes enrichment in programmed cell death and apoptotic process, HIF\u20101 signaling pathway and IBD. Infiltration matrix analysis of immune cells showed abundant T cells CD4 memory activated, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, Mast cells activated and Neutrophils in CD intestinal tissues. The 6 key CD\u2010FRGs were correlated with immune\u2010infiltrated cells in CD based on correlation analysis. Taken together, immune cells with abnormal infiltration can be implicated in CD due to ferroptosis. This study identified 6 key CD\u2010FRGs that may be key biomarkers of ferroptosis in CD; they include CAV1, CD44, HIF1A, IFNG, TIMP1 and TLR4. These findings suggest that the immune response is critical in CD caused by ferroptosis through the interaction between key CD\u2010FRGs and immune infiltrating cells.",

Ferroptosis, a novel type of programmed cell death, it seems the role of ferroptosis\u2011related biomarkers in CD has not been mentioned. Thus, the role of ferroptosis in CD and its relationship with immune infiltration were explored in this study. The CD dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The validated ferroptosis genes (FRGs) were retrieved from the public FerrDb database. The gene expression matrix of the CD dataset was analyzed with the \u201climma\u201d package in R language to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between diseased and healthy samples. Then, intersecting genes between DEGs and FRGs were identified as differentially expressed ferroptosis\u2011associated genes (DE\u2011FRGs). Protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and visualization were carried out with STRING and Cytoscape, and key CD ferroptosis\u2011related genes (CD\u2011FRGs) were identified along with their Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using the clusterProfiler package. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed with CIBERSORT. The correlation between key CD\u2011FRGs and immune\u2011infiltrated cells in CD was studied by Spearman\u2019s correlation method. A total of 37 DE\u2011FRGs and 6 key CD\u2011FRGs (CAV1, CD44, HIF1A, IFNG, TIMP1 and TLR4) were identified. GO and KEGG functional analysis indicated these genes enrichment in programmed cell death and apoptotic process, HIF\u20111 signaling pathway and IBD. Infiltration matrix analysis of immune cells showed abundant T cells CD4 memory activated, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, Mast cells activated and Neutrophils in CD intestinal tissues. The 6 key CD\u2011FRGs were correlated with immune\u2011infiltrated cells in CD based on correlation analysis. Taken together, immune cells with abnormal infiltration can be implicated in CD due to ferroptosis. This study identified 6 key CD\u2011FRGs that may be key biomarkers of ferroptosis in CD; they include CAV1, CD44, HIF1A, IFNG, TIMP1 and TLR4. These findings suggest that the immune response is critical in CD caused by ferroptosis through the interaction between key CD\u2011FRGs and immune infiltrating cells.\nCrohn\u2019s disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that manifests mainly as chronic inflammation in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract, and its incidence has come to be increasing in recent years1. However, the etiology of CD remains unclear, and it has been shown that genetic, immunological and environmental factors increase the risk of its development and progression2. The disease course of CD is progressive and devastating, with not only intestinal destruction but also extraintestinal systemic manifestations, which will seriously affect the quality of life and prognosis of patients3. In the last two decades, the use of biologics such as infliximab, adalimumab and vedolizumab has greatly expanded the therapeutic options for CD4,5. Even though these therapies account for significant advances in the treatment of CD, there are still several patients that are not sensitive to these agents (e.g., anti-TNF antibodies)6. Notably, specific biomarkers can help clinicians benefit in the diagnosis and intervention of CD, as well as play a role in clarifying treatment response and predicting CD\nOPEN\n1Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 34 North Zhongshan Road, Licheng District, Quanzhou 362000, Fujian, People\u2019s Republic of China. 2Department of Rheumatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, Fujian, People\u2019s Republic of China. 3Department of Neurosurgery, Zhangzhou Municipal Hospital of Fujian Province and Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian Province, People\u2019s Republic of China. 4These authors contributed equally: Xiaoting Tang and Weitao Hu. *email: fangtaiyong122@126.com\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:12769 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40093-w\nrelapse. Therefore, it is important to study and explore the precise molecular mechanisms and markers of CD for the development of its therapeutic strategies.\nIt has been demonstrated in many studies that the progression of IBD is associated with cell death. A growing body of evidence suggests that programmed cell death, including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, is involved in the progression of CD in various ways7\u201310. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered regulated form of cell death in recent years, which is driven by the lethal build-up of lipid peroxides catalyzed with cellular free iron11. The essential features of Ferroptosis, including iron deposition, glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) deactivation, and lipid peroxidation, have been found in abundance in the damaged gastrointestinal tract of patients with IBD10. Xu et\u00a0al. found that Ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, attenuated the pathological changes of CD-like colitis induced by TNBS in mice12. It has been shown that abnormal ferroptosis has been detected in CD13. Of interest, in terms of dietary habits, it has been shown that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) is a trigger for GPX4 (which prevents ferroptosis) to limit the inflammatory phenotype of human CD mucosa14. However, studies on ferroptosis in CD are still relatively few and, furthermore, it seems that the role of ferroptosis-related biomarkers in CD has not been mentioned so far.\nTo investigate whether or how ferroptosis is involved in the progression of CD, microarray data were collected from the GEO database with intestinal tissues of CD patients and healthy individuals. Subsequently, CD-related ferroptosis genes were screened by bioinformatics methods and immuno-infiltration analysis was performed to analyze their correlation. Finally, 37 differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DE-FRGs), and 6 key CD ferroptosis-related genes (CD-FRGs) were identified as potential ferroptosis-related biomarkers of CD."

The GSE1687916 dataset, containing 12 healthy controls and 37 CD intestinal tissue samples was selected. Probes were converted to gene symbols according to the GPL570 platform ([HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array). FerroptosisRelated Genes (FRGs) that drive, suppress, or mark ferroptosis were retrieved from the public FerrDb database (http:// www. zhoun an. org/ ferrdb)17. The final 365 FRGs obtained after removing duplicate genes were used for subsequent analysis. Two microarray datasets of CD (GSE5907118: 8 active CD vs. 11 healthy controls; GSE95095: 24 active CDs vs. 12 healthy controls) were used to validate the expression of key CD-FRGs. Fold changes greater than 2 or less than 0.5 were considered to be significantly differentially expressed.

In addition, |log2 FC|> 1 and adj. P-value (FDR) < 0.05 were set as the selection criteria for DEGs. Subsequently, the overlapping genes between DEGs and FRGs were identified as differentially expressed ferroptosisrelated genes (DE-FRGs).\nProtein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network construction and module analysis. Analyses of the interactions between different DE-FRGs were performed using the STRING database (http:// string- db. org/)19. The PPI network was built and visualized with Cytoscape software 3.9.1. (http:// cytos cape. org/)20. The key module in PPI network was identified using the Cytoscape plugin Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) (version 2.0), a plug-in for clustering based on the topology of a given network to identify densely connected regions21. The overlap of the top 10 genes of the MCC, Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), DNMC, Closeness, Degree and Edge Infiltration Component (EPC) algorithms were identified as key Crohn\u2019s disease ferroptosisrelated genes (CD-FRG) using Cytoscape\u2019s plug-in cytoHubba.\nFunctional enrichment of DE\u2011FRGs and hub CD\u2011FRGs.

A normalized gene expression matrix was shown to be transformed by CIBERSORT into a composition of 22 immune cell types based on a deconvolution algorithm25. In this study, CIBERSORT was used to calculate the composition of immune cells in CD and healthy samples. The algorithm used the LM22 signature and performed 1000 permutations.\nAnalysis of correlations and differences between immune\u2011infiltrated cells.

The GSE16879 dataset was retrieved from the GEO database, which contained gene expression profiles from 12 healthy intestinal and 37 CD intestinal biopsy tissue samples. After normalization of microarray results, 1372 DEGs were identified, including 1082 up-regulated genes and 290 down-regulated genes (Fig.\u00a01A,B). A total of 365 FRGs with experimentally validated FRGs were retrieved from FerrDb, a database of regulators, markers and diseases implicated in ferroptosis. After overlapping DEGs and FRGs to take the intersection, a total of 37 FRGs were identified as DE-FRGs (Fig.\u00a01C). Figure\u00a01D showed the expression of 37 DE-FRGs in the CD dataset GSE16879.\nConstruction of PPI network, analysis of modules and identification of key CD\u2011FRGs. The PPI construction for DE-FRGs was performed with the STRING database and the results were subsequently visualized with Cytoscape (Fig.\u00a02A). The MCODE plug-in recognized the most densely connected regions (11 nodes and 51 edges) of the PPI network (Fig.\u00a02B). The top 10 genes were obtained by 6 algorithms of Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba (Table\u00a01). Subsequently, the final six crossover genes obtained by overlapping the results derived from the MCC, DNMC, MNC, Degree, Closeness and EPC algorithms were chosen as the key CD-FRGs, which included CAV1, CD44, HIF1A, IFNG, TIMP1 and TLR4 (Fig.\u00a02C). Of note, all these key CD-FRGs were upregulated in patients with CD. Table\u00a02 indicated the details of these 6 key CD-FRGs.\nValidation of the key CD\u2011FRGs expression in CD. We selected two additional microarray datasets (GSE59071 and GSE95095) for validation to determine whether key CD-FRGs are differentially expressed in the CD datasets. A total of 751 DEGs were found in GSE59071 and 11,480 DEGs were found in GSE95095 (Fig.\u00a03A,B). In the datasets GSE59071 and GSE95095, the 6 previously screened key CD-FRGs were validated to be upregulated DEGs.\nFunctional enrichment of DE\u2011FRGs and key CD\u2011FRGs. For predicting the biological functions of DE-FRGs, functional enrichment analysis was performed. GO analysis indicated that DE-FRGs were enriched mainly in programmed cell death, immune system process, apoptotic process and regulation of cell death (Fig.\u00a0 4A); whereas KEGG pathway analysis indicated DE-FRGs were significantly enriched in HIF-1 signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, Ferroptosis and IBD (Fig.\u00a04B). GO analysis revealed that key CD-FRGs were enriched significantly in regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process, programmed cell death and apoptotic process (Fig.\u00a05A); whereas KEGG pathway analysis indicated key CD-FRGs were significantly enriched in HIF-1 signaling pathway and IBD (Fig.\u00a05B). The results of functional enrichment analysis obtained for GO terms or KEGG revealed that these CD genes were associated with either programmed cell death or IBD.\nDistribution of immune\u2011infiltrated cells. Screening of the microarray with CIBERSORT inverse convolution method at P < 0.05 resulted in 12 healthy intestinal tissues and 37 CD intestinal tissue groups on the heat map. Memory CD4 + T cells activated, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, Mast cells activated and Neutrophils were all more abundant in intestinal tissues of patients with CD than in healthy controls, while CD8 + T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), Eosinophils and resting NK cells were less expressed in the intestinal tissues of CD patients than in the healthy control group (Fig.\u00a06A). The distribution of the 22 immune cells in each sample was detailed in Fig.\u00a06B.\nAnalysis of the correlation and differences in immune\u2011infiltrated cells. A positive correlation was found between memory resting CD4 + T cells and resting Dendritic cells (r = 0.72, p < 0.0001), activated Mast cells and activated dendritic cells (r = 0.58, p < 0.001), as well as activated Mast cells and Neutrophils (r = 0.52, p < 0.01) (Fig.\u00a07A).

In the present study, total of 37 DE-FRGs were found to be significantly expressed in CD intestinal tissues, whereas 6 key CD-FRGs were found, but further studies are still needed to investigate how or to what extent they participate\nFZD7\nIL1B\nGJA1\nGPX4\nCAV1 TIMP1\nACSF2\nEGR1\nTRIB2\nFADS2\nDPP4\nPDK4\nSLC7A11\nLCN2\nIFNG\nRRM2\nHIF1A\nCGAS\nMUC1\nCHAC1\nMT1GENPP2\nALOX12\nACSL1\nHMOX1\nPROK2\nRBMS1\nTLR4\nIL6\nPML\nCBS\nQSOX1\nNOS2\nCD44\nPTGS2\nLPIN1\nIDO1\nCAV1\nTIMP1\nIFNG\nHIF1A\nTLR4 CD44\nA B\nC\nFigure\u00a02.

Functional enrichment analysis of GO terms indicated that DE-FRGs were enriched mainly in programmed cell death, immune system process, apoptotic process, and regulation of cell death. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that DE-FRGs were mainly enriched in HIF-1 signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, Ferroptosis and IBD. Among the PPI network of DE-FRGs, high scores were obtained for 6 of the 37 genes (CAV1, CD44, HIF1A, IFNG, TIMP1 and TLR4) in the 6 algorithms of cytoHubba. GO terms analysis revealed that these 6 key CD-FRGs were highly enriched in regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process, programmed cell death and apoptotic process, as well as in KEGG of HIF-1 signaling pathway and IBD. Defective apoptosis has long been thought to be associated with IBD, and the cause of CD pathogenesis is thought to be an excessive T-cell response due to an intrinsic defect in the T-cell apoptosis pathway26. Impaired regulation of cell death will disrupt the intestinal epithelial cell barrier and trigger a range of intestinal diseases, including CD27. The important role of IL-17 signaling pathway in CD has been demonstrated by numerous studies6,28. It has been demonstrated that HIF-1\u03b1 stabilizers can be used to treat IBD29. These results for both GO terms and the KEGG pathway indicated that the DE-FRGs or key CD-FRGs found in the present study may be involved inin the progression of CD through the above pathways.\nCaveolin-1 (CAV1) is a scaffold structural protein of caveolae involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, cellular signaling pathways and inflammation mediated by endothelial cells30. Caveolin-1 has been shown to inhibit fibroblast autophagy by regulating Sequestosome 1, which decreases intestinal fibrosis in CD31. As a suppressor of ferroptosis, CAV1 has been shown to indicate ferroptosis in acute immune-mediated liver injury by attenuating nitrogen stress32. Therefore, it is speculated that CAV1 may affect intestinal fibrosis in CD by alleviating ferroptosis, but further studies are still needed to validate it.\nCD44 (CD44 Molecule) is a cell surface glycoprotein which has long been researched as a cancer molecule owing to its vital function in the biological activities of normal cells and in the pathological actions of cancer cells (e.g., cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration)33. Liu et\u00a0al. revealed that CD44 expression inhibited ferroptosis in cancer cells in an OTUB1-dependent manner34. It has been suggested that the absence of specific CD44 variable splice exons in macrophages prevents CD35. It remains to be investigated whether CD44, a ferroptosis inhibitor, could exacerbate CD by reducing ferroptosis in CD.\nGene symbol Description Function\nCAV1 Caveolin-1 May act as a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes.

The study by Mimouna et\u00a0al. demonstrated that co-activation of autophagy and HIF1A expression may be a new approach to address adherent invasive E.\u00a0coli (AIEC) infection in CD patients37. HIF1A has been shown to be not only a driver38 but also an inhibitor39 of ferroptosis. Thus, it is crucial to maintain the balance of HIF1A in CD to control ferroptosis in CD..\nInterferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3, namely IFNG) is a pro-inflammatory factor which regulates numerous immunerelated genes40. Interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) released from CD8 + T cells impairs the uptake of cystine by tumor cells, thereby promoting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in tumor cells41. IFNN has long been thought to be a driver of inflammatory factors in CD and to exacerbate its course42,43, and coupled with its driving role in ferroptosis, we speculated that it may promote CD by exacerbating ferroptosis.\nTissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) is one of the four members of the glycoproteome (TIMP14), whose main feature is to mediate extracellular matrix turnover. Since the main cellular sources of TIMP-1 are macrophages and fibroblasts, regulation of these cells is essential for the prevention of colonic fibrosis in patients with CD44,45. Shi et\u00a0al. demonstrated that silencing TIMP1 inhibited ferroptosis in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells through downregulation of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR-1)46. However, whether TIMP1\nA B\nFigure\u00a04. Functional enrichment analysis for DE-FRGs associated with CD. (A) Bubble diagram showing DE-FRG enriched with GO terms.

It has been demonstrated that knockdown of TLR4 significantly improves left ventricular remodeling in heart failure by inhibiting ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes49. Therefore, we venture to speculated that TLR4 may be able to exacerbate CD by promoting ferroptosis in intestinal cells.\nA\nB\nFigure\u00a06.

Earlier studies have shown that soluble caveolin-1-Ig inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production in response to recall antigen or alloantigen-presenting cells (APC), and in combination with our study, CAV1 was negatively correlated with memory resting CD4 + T cells, suggesting that CAV1 may be involved in CD progression by inhibiting T cell proliferation52.CD44 has been shown to block apoptosis of CD4 + T cells that activate colitis35,53. The inhibitor of ferroptosis, CD44, was negatively correlated with memory resting CD4 + T cells in the present study, which\nA\nB\nFigure\u00a08.

It has been demonstrated that the microenvironment of IFN-\u03b3 polarizes macrophages and induces intestinal Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) affecting CD fibrosis54, which in addition combined with the positive correlation of IFNG with macrophage M1 in our study may suggest that IFNG could be involved in the pathogenesis of CD through macrophages. One study showed that the anti-inflammatory factor interleukin-10 can act on dendritic cells and induce their production of TIMP155, with our study, this suggests that TIMP1 and dendritic cells may interact to affect CD. Li et\u00a0al. found that ferroptosis coordinates neutrophil recruitment to damaged myocardium by promoting neutrophils adhesion to coronary endothelial cells via the TLR4/TRIF/I type IFN signaling pathway56, and combined with the positive association of TLR4 and neutrophils in our study, suggests that TLR4 may affect CD by regulating ferroptosis of neutrophils in the intestine. However, how HIF1A mediates ferroptosis causing CD through these immune infiltrated cells still needs to be explored. Experiments with these CD-FRGs specific immune cell knock-out may contribute to unraveling the underlying mechanisms in the future.\nThere are also some limitations in this study. First, it was a secondary mining and analysis of previously published datasets. Thus, the results of the experiments may vary from the findings of earlier experiments, probably due to bias in the data analysis because of a small sample size or other reasons. Second, since the CIBERSORT deconvolution algorithm relies on limited genetic data, different diseases have variability in susceptibility factors and disease phenotypes, which will lead to inaccurate results. Despite this, our study could still provide compelling evidence and new research ideas for further investigation of the role of these immune-infiltrated cells or immune-related genes in ferroptosis of CD."

This study identified 6 key CD-FRGs that may be key biomarkers of ferroptosis in CD; they include CAV1, CD44, HIF1A, IFNG, TIMP1 and TLR4. These findings suggest that the immune response is critical in CD caused by ferroptosis through the interaction between key CD-FRGs and immune infiltrating cells."
