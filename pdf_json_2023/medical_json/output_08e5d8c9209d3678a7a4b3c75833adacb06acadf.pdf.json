    "abstractText": "Pregnancy and/or the puerperium involve social, physiological and psychological changes that make women more vulnerable to mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, even more so if these develop in stressful contexts such as the pandemic. The aim of this study is to identify factors associated with the risk of postpartum anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among postpartum women (n = 69) who gave birth between March 2020 and March 2021 in Melilla, a Spanish cross-border city with Morocco whose borders were closed, making it a confined city. The scales used were the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Results reported an elevated risk of depression (85.5%) and anxiety (63.8%), with severe anxiety reaching 40.6% of cases. Predictors of postpartum depression comprised a personal history of mood disorders (\u03b2 = 8.421; CI95% = 4.863/11.978) and having been diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum (\u03b2 = 4.488; CI95% = 1.331/7.646). As regards anxiety, it is predicted on the basis of mood antecedents (\u03b2 = 14.175; CI95% = 7.870/20.479), the fact of having been diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum (\u03b2 = 8.781; CI95% = 2.970/14.592) and the fact of being a multipara (\u03b2 = 5.513; CI95% = 0.706/10.321). In conclusion, special attention should be paid to women with a history of mood disorders and a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum, even more so in the case of multiparous women, because of its impact on mental health during the postpartum period.",

            "text": "Pregnancy and postpartum periods are characterised for being periods in which women experience many changes at social, physiological, and psychological levels (Lutkiewicz\net\u00a0al., 2020), which may lead to the appearance or relapse of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety (Biaggi et\u00a0al., 2016). These two disorders affect both the mother\u2019s and the new-born\u2019s health and even the relationship between them (Mohammad-Redzuan et\u00a0al., 2020; Biaggi et\u00a0al., 2016; Branquinho et\u00a0al., 2020).\nPursuant to the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 2014) postpartum depression (PPD) is the most frequent mental disorder during the puerperium. It is defined as a major depressive episode which may start during pregnancy or during the first four weeks following the postpartum period and which may persist until a year after delivery. It is characterised by sadness, anhedonia, fatigue, low selfesteem, sense of guilt, sleep disorders, decreased appetite, worries about the baby\u2019s health, and suicidal ideation (Missler et\u00a0al., 2020). On the other hand, postpartum anxiety is characterised by excessive and persistent distress related * Mar\u00eda Adelaida \u00c1lvarez-Serrano adealvarez@ugr.es 1 Department of\u00a0Nursing, Faculty of\u00a0Health Sciences, University of\u00a0Granada, 18016\u00a0Granada, Spain 2 Department of\u00a0Nursing, Faculty of\u00a0Health Sciences, University of\u00a0Ja\u00e9n, 23071\u00a0Ja\u00e9n, Spain 3 Department of\u00a0Nursing, Faculty of\u00a0Health Sciences, University of\u00a0Granada, St. Cortadura del Valle S/N, 51001\u00a0Ceuta, Spain 4 Guadix High Resolution Hospital, 18500\u00a0Granada, Spain\n1 3\nto disquiet, irritability, nervousness, fear, and sleep disorders. It is connected to PPD, and may lead to a lower possibility of breastfeeding, an increase in the risk of child abuse, new-born\u2019s cognitive and social impairment, and a higher probability of anxiety in the baby (Mohammad-Redzuan et\u00a0al., 2020).\nPPD is present in 10-15% of women, particularly in less developed countries. On the other hand, postpartum anxiety affects between 8% and 13% (Molgora & Accordini, 2020) and the comorbidity of both is approximately 75% (Mohammad-Redzuan et\u00a0al., 2020).\nAlthough the exact causes remain unknown, multiple factors could influence the onset of PPD and anxiety. On the one hand, biological factors such as hormonal changes after childbirth (Molgora & Accordini, 2020). On the other hand, social and cultural factors, such as a history of child abuse (Biaggi et\u00a0al., 2016), lack of social/family support during pregnancy and/or postpartum (Yan et\u00a0al., 2020), poor relationship (Biaggi et\u00a0al., 2016), not being married (Stepowicz et\u00a0al., 2020), belonging to a low socioeconomic level (Missler et\u00a0al., 2020), or being a smoker and using drugs (Spinola et\u00a0al., 2020). There is also evidence of the influence of obstetric factors, for example, being multiparous (Stojanov et\u00a0al., 2020), having a negative behaviour towards the pregnancy, or the type of delivery, so that there is a relationship between caesarean delivery and higher levels of PPD and anxiety (Mohammad-Redzuan et\u00a0al. al., 2020). Finally, psychological factors have also been highlighted, for example, having low self-esteem and being emotionally unstable (Biaggi et\u00a0al., 2016), a family or personal history of bipolar disorder, anxiety, or depression (Missler et\u00a0al., 2020; Spinola et\u00a0al., 2020), and serious illness, bereavement, miscarriage, and previous high-risk pregnancies (Yan et\u00a0al., 2020). Having these disorders during pregnancy carries obstetric and perinatal health risks for the mother and foetus, such as an increased likelihood of pre-eclampsia, hypertension, and gestational diabetes (Stojanov et\u00a0al., 2020). It is affirmed that such disorders are related to low scores on the Apgar test, prematurity, congenital disorders, low birthweight, reduction of head circumference, higher probability of suffering from depression, anxiety, attention deficit disorder, and hyperactivity in the future. PPD is also linked to disorders in the cognitive, physical, and linguistic development of children during the first year of life (Do et\u00a0al., 2018; Lebel et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThe pandemic has generated in the population an increase in the levels of fear, depression, anxiety, and stress (Stojanov et\u00a0al., 2020). The prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety during the pandemic in the Spanish population was 18.7% and 21.6%, respectively (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sanguino et\u00a0al., 2020). Several authors conclude that stressful contexts increase the prevalence of mental disorders in women during pregnancy and the\npostpartum period. In this sense, the global COVID-19 pandemic also seems to have had an impact on higher levels of anxiety and postpartum depression (Stepowicz et\u00a0al., 2020; Yan et\u00a0al., 2020; Lebel et\u00a0al., 2020; RomeroGonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al. 2020). Specifically in Spain, it has been quantified that the symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women increased by 59% and 38%, respectively, during confinement (Brik et\u00a0al., 2021).\nMeasures implemented by health services to control infection have directly affected the psychological wellbeing of pregnant women. These measures include spacing obstetric appointments, introducing online medical consultations or online childbirth preparation classes, and even being unaccompanied during labour. Indeed, lack of support during childbirth is one of the variables most frequently associated with the occurrence of PPD (Stojanov et\u00a0al., 2020; Yan et\u00a0al., 2020; Bertholdt et\u00a0al. 2020; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2022).\nRomero-Gonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al. (2020) state that fear of contagion, solitude, and stress experimented by pregnant women during the pandemic are risk factors for the development of PPD and anxiety. Likewise, during pregnancy, women are more prone to infections, which makes them a vulnerable group in the case of COVID-19. Such fact, associated with a potential transmission of the virus to the foetus, has generated a higher level of anxiety, depression, and stress in women (Mari\u00f1o-Narv\u00e1ez et\u00a0 al., 2021). Additionally, Garc\u00eda-Le\u00f3n et\u00a0al. (2022) stated that the youngest pregnant Spanish women in the first quarter of pregnancy were the most vulnerable to the effects of stress and concerns about COVID-19. However, the fear of contagion made pregnant women one of the most aware groups and predisposed to get vaccinated, even willing to pay for the vaccine if necessary (Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2021).\nBased on previous research on risk factors for the development of PPD and anxiety, the following hypotheses were established:\n1) The risk of suffering PPD and/or anxiety differs between those who gave birth before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. 2) The risk of suffering PPD and/or anxiety differs according to sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, relationship status, religion, level of education and working status. 3) The risk of PPD and/or anxiety differs between women who have help raising their children and those who do not. 4) The risk of PPD and/or anxiety differs between those who have a history of mood disorders and those who do not. 5) The risk of PPD and/or anxiety differs between new and multiparous mothers.\n1 3\n6) The risk of suffering PPD and/or anxiety differs among those who have maintained close contact with or have been infected by COVID-19 and those who do not.\nThe objectives of this study were to identify the level of anxiety and the risk of postpartum depression during the pandemic, related factors, and predictive factors."

Items assessed as reversed are 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Total score varies between 0 and 30, 10 being the cut-off value, which indicates risk of suffering from said disorder, 0 to 10 being deemed with no risk, and 10 to 30 being deemed risk of PPD (Krauskopf & Valenzuela, 2020)."

It is the self-administered questionnaire mostly employed by Spanish psychologists to assess anxiety. It consists of 40 items, divided into two subscales with 20 items to assess trait anxiety (STAI-R) and 20 items to assess state anxiety (STAI-E) using a 4-point Likert scale running from 4 (rarely or nothing) to 3 (almost always or often) in trait and state anxiety, respectively. Updated by Guill\u00e9nRiquelme & Buela-Casal (2011), Cronbach\u2019s alpha reliability was 0.90 for Trait and 0.94 for State Anxiety. Reversed items are considered for STAI-R (21,26,27,30,33,36, and 39) and for STAI-E (1,2,5,8,10,11,15,16,19, and 20). For this study, a simplified version of this questionnaire was utilised, the STAI-E, which assesses the level of anxiety generated by a stressful episode, such as the postpartum period, as used by other authors (Gancedo-Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al., 2017; Navas-Arrebola et\u00a0al., 2022). Total score fluctuates from 0 to 60, including no anxiety (<20 points), mild anxiety (20-25 points), moderate anxiety (26-32 points) and serious anxiety (33-60 points) (Gancedo-Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al., 2017)."

To check the normality of the sample, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used.\n(2) Bivariate analyses were conducted for depression and anxiety, the sociodemographic variables (age, level of education, marital status, and working status), other variables (number of children, maternal education, mood antecedents, and having had help during the postpartum period to take care of the new-born) and variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID19 diagnosis and close contact with the virus) being deemed the independent variables. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was applied to calculate the relationships of the total of depression and anxiety risk scales with the age and number of children, and the Student\u2019s T Test was applied for the relationship of the total of scales with the remaining dichotomous variables utilised in the study. Furthermore, the chi-squared test was conducted to associate the classified scores of the depression and anxiety risk scales with the other variables. The statistically significant level was set at p <\u00a00.05. (3) Two models of multiple linear and forward stepwise regression were designed by introducing every independent variable, calculating the beta, standard error, and confidence intervals values at 95%. Linearity and independence of residuals were verified by means of the Durbin-Watson statistic, determining acceptable independence values inferior to 2.5."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The purpose of this study was to identify the anxiety level and the postpartum depression risk during the pandemic, related factors, and predictive factors. This study contributes significant data on the influence of COVID-19 on the development of anxiety and postpartum depression risk.\nPrevious studies conducted before the pandemic reported a mean prevalence of postpartum anxiety of 18.1 \u00b1 7.4, mild anxiety predominating (Gancedo-Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al., 2017). Our results, however, show a higher prevalence of postpartum anxiety during the last year due to the pandemic, with a mean of 26.91 \u00b1 12.32, severe anxiety being the most predominant. The results obtained on the risk of PPD in our sample were an average of 16.14 \u00b1 6.54, while studies carried out before the pandemic (M\u00edguez et\u00a0al., 2017), informed mean values of 8.16. This data shows that the risk of PPD has increased in the pandemic period. Both results confirm our first hypothesis, which posited that the risk of PPD and/or anxiety differs between those who gave birth before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and confirm that the risk is higher in both cases.\nThe increase in anxiety and depression risk levels during the pandemic may be due to the several measures taken by the government to reduce the propagation of the disease, including social isolation, which have had a negative impact on the mental health of the population from multiple countries, in general (Le et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0al.,\n2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2021), and on puerperal women, in particular (Galea, Comerciante & Lurie, 2020; Brisk et\u00a0al., 2021). Additionally, the study conducted by Wang, et\u00a0al. (2021) found that the Spanish population reported higher levels of stress and depression, as well as\n1 3\nmore symptoms and use of medical services than participants from China.\nOur study wanted to analyse other factors that may influence anxiety disorders and PPD, as established in the initial hypotheses. In accordance with the second hypothesis, the sociodemographic variables such as age, marital status, level of education, working status, and maternal education were not significantly related to the appearance of postpartum anxiety and depression in our sample, as stated by Pham et\u00a0al. (2017) before the pandemic. Nevertheless, such result differs from other studies, which consider that being younger than 30 and single are PPD risk factors (Cordova, 2017; Mel\u00e9ndez et\u00a0al., 2017; Wu et\u00a0al., 2020). While as regards the level of education, several authors disagree with our results by stating that having primary education or being an illiterate person is related to the risk of PPD appearance (Cordova, 2017; M\u00edguez et\u00a0al., 2017; Pham et\u00a0al., 2017); in contrast, Yan et\u00a0al\u2019s study (2020) noted that it was related to the mothers\u2019 high level of education.\nAlthough our results did not show an association between working status and these pathologies, many authors represented that unemployed mothers had higher PPD risk (M\u00edguez et\u00a0al., 2017; Pham et\u00a0al., 2017; Romero et\u00a0al., 2017; Yan et\u00a0al., 2020). Likewise, having a low socioeconomic level is deemed a risk factor for such disorder (McCartney, 2019). These variables in our study may have been not significant due to the participants\u2019 profile, most of our sample was older than 30, were in a relationship, had a higher level of education, and were employed.\nWith regard to the third hypothesis (the risk of PPD and/ or anxiety differs between women who have help raising their children and those who do not), our study shows an increase in cases of postpartum anxiety and depression risk in women who had no help to take care of the newborn. Therefore, our results confirm this hypothesis and are in accordance with previous research (Brisk et\u00a0al., 2021; Berthold et\u00a0al., 2020; Fallon et\u00a0al., 2021; Pham et\u00a0al., 2017; Wu et\u00a0al., 2020; Yan et\u00a0al., 2020). In our results, limitation on health attendance has had no impact on the increase in cases of such pathologies; however, Davenport et\u00a0al. (2020) discovered a relationship between health restrictions and an increase in psychological issues; this may be due to the fact that the women of our study accepted the health attention restrictions imposed due to the pandemic.\nIn response to hypothesis four (the risk of PPD and/or anxiety differs between those who have a history of mood disorders and those who do not), when adjusted to the rest of variables, having mood antecedents maintained an association with postpartum anxiety and depression risk. Hence, this result confirms the hypothesis and coincides with other studies performed before the pandemic (Gancedo-Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al., 2017; M\u00edguez et\u00a0al., 2017; Pham et\u00a0al., 2017; Spinola et\u00a0al., 2020; Brisk et\u00a0al., 2021). It\ncan be stated that this variable could be considered a risk factor present both in non-pandemic and pandemic contexts.\nRegarding hypothesis five (the risk of PPD and/or anxiety differs between new and multiparous mothers), our results show that the number of children was also significantly related to both pathologies. Multipara women reported more postpartum anxiety and risk of depression. These results confirm this hypothesis and are in line with other authors (Romero et\u00a0al., 2017; Bertholdt et\u00a0al., 2020; Yan et\u00a0al., 2020). This is justified on the basis that taking care of a new-born is a great psychological burden that alters the mother\u2019s mental health, such disorder being higher during the pandemic as a consequence of the social isolation they had to face and not being able to receive any help with the baby from their relatives and/or acquaintances, in addition to taking care of the other children not attending school or doing so within reduced hours.\nWhen considering COVID-related variables, those who had close contact with the disease and/or a positive diagnosis during pregnancy or the postpartum period showed more anxiety and risk of PPD. This finding coincides with the results of Wu et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2020) and Missler et\u00a0al.\u2019s studies (2020). This may be due to the fear pregnant women felt about the lack of knowledge on the vertical transmission to the foetus (Romero-Gonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al., 2020; Spinola et\u00a0al.,2020). These results confirm our last hypothesis, the risk of suffering PPD and/or anxiety differs among those who have maintained close contact with or have been infected by COVID-19.\nOnline psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) could have been useful in relieving stress and reducing postpartum anxiety (Ho, Chee & Ho, 2020; Soh et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhang & Ho, 2017). In addition, accurate dissemination of health information and follow-up during pregnancy and postpartum by telephone or online would reduce depression during this period."

Second, during the pandemic the birth rate in the city decreased due to mobility reasons derived from the geographical characteristics of Melilla, an isolated border city. In addition, access to Health Centres to recruit women was restricted. In order to reduce this limitation, successive calls were made at different times. Finally, this study was not randomised, therefore it is possible that respondents were the most motivated women with more knowledge of such variables; nonetheless, given the\n1 3\npandemic context and the limited access to women, a randomised sample was not a choice."

This was higher in multiparous women, who had had close contact with the disease, who had been diagnosed with COVID19, with antecedents of mood disorder, and who had no help during the postpartum period to take care of the newborn. Most of the sample showed high levels of PPD risk during such period. Depression risk was higher in puerperal women who had had close contact with COVID-19 patients, who had been diagnosed with it, who had mood antecedents and who had no help to take care of the baby. Mood antecedents and a positive COVID-19 diagnosis during pregnancy or the postpartum period predicted an increase in the risk of postpartum depression; while for postpartum anxiety, the predictive factor of being multipara must be added to mood antecedents and being diagnosed with COVID-19.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s12144- 023- 04719-6.\nFunding Funding for open access publishing: Universidad de Granada/ CBUA The study was not funded; no researcher received grants, salary, or reimbursements for the realisation of the study.\nData Availability The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nDeclaration\nEthical Approval Statement This study follows the good clinical practice, as specified by European Directive 2001/20/CE and Law 14/2007, of July 3, on biomedical research.
