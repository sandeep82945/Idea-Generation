            "text": "Objective: Independent of weight status, rapid weight gain has been associated with underlying\nbrain structure variation in regions associated with food intake and impulsivity among pre-\nadolescents. Yet, we lack clarity on how developmental maturation coincides with rapid weight\ngain and weight stability.\nMethods: We identified brain predictors of two-year rapid weight gain and its longitudinal effects on brain structure and impulsivity in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM\nStudy\u00ae. Youth were categorized as Healthy Weight/Weight Stable (WSHW, n=225) or Weight Gainers (WG, n=221, >38lbs); 63% of the WG group were healthy weight at 9-to-10-years-old.\nResults: A five-fold cross-validated logistic elastic-net regression revealed that rapid weight\ngain was associated with structural variation amongst 39 brain features at 9-to-10-years-old in\nregions involved with executive functioning, appetitive control, and reward sensitivity. Two\nyears later, WG youth showed differences in change over time in several of these regions and\nperformed worse on measures of impulsivity.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that brain structure in pre-adolescence may predispose\nsome to rapid weight gain and that weight gain itself may alter maturational brain change in\nregions important for food intake and impulsivity. Behavioral interventions that target inhibitory\ncontrol may improve trajectories of brain maturation and facilitate healthier behaviors.\nIntroduction:\nRapid weight gain is defined as abnormal growth within a short period and contributes to childhood obesity risk and exacerbated metabolic consequences.1\u20134 However, apart from infancy,\nrapid weight gain later in development is poorly understood. The neural mechanisms that may\ncontribute to weight stability versus cause others to experience rapid (or excessive) weight gain\nindependent of their weight status (i.e., healthy weight vs. overweight/obese) remain elusive. Given the current obesity epidemic in youth,5 it is imperative to understand the mechanisms\ndriving weight stability versus rapid weight gain during childhood. The 10-year longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (ABCD Study\u00ae) permits a closer\ninvestigation into whether neural differences precede or result from excessive weight gain among\n9-to-10-year-old children. Furthermore, we can learn how neural differences correlate with\nbehavior and potentially identify targets of future interventions.\nThe predictors and long-term effects associated with abnormal rapid weight gain during infancy are well-documented. Correlates of rapid weight gain during infancy include, being born small6 or large7 for gestational age, prenatal stressors such as substance exposure, preterm delivery, maternal obesity, and undernutrition.6,8,9 Rapid weight gain during infancy been associated with later obesity risk10 and medical comorbidities, such as reduced lung function,1 early menarche,2 and cardiometabolic risk.3,4 Rapid weight gain during puberty,11,12 while less studied than in infancy, may be more consequential for cardiometabolic health,13 highlighting the need for\nfurther study in this age range.\nGenerally, weight gain occurs in response to a surplus of calories (i.e., overeating). Although\nreasons for overeating and obesity are multifactorial, the brain plays a key role as it controls food intake via homeostatic and hedonic control pathways.14,15 Within this realm, obesity in children has been correlated with altered brain structure,16 resting-state functional connectivity,17,18 brain activity during a working memory task,19 and altered brain responses in reward and inhibitory control regions to pictures of food,20,21 suggesting that aberrations in brain structure and function\nmay be one reason for overeating. We have previously shown that there are brain regions in 9-to10-year-old children that predict one-year rapid weight gain,19 but it is not known whether\nweight gain itself may affect trajectories of change in brain structure because of rapid weight\ngain.\nThe current study assessed the longitudinal relationship between brain structure and weight gain,\nindependent of weight status, in a cohort of youth classified as either Healthy Weight/Weight\nStable (WSHW) or Weight Gainers (WG) over a two-year period in development. We first assessed if brain regions predictive of one-year weight gain19 showed continued structural\nvariation after weight gain onset. However, because rapid weight gain can be temporally\nsensitive (e.g., some youth may gain weight within one year and stop, while other youth will\ncontinue to show continued multiyear rapid weight gain trajectories), we also assessed if there\nwas structural variation at baseline that was predictive of youth who would have sustained, two-\nyear weight gain and how these regions changed after two-years of weight gain. To contextualize\nextreme weight gain in terms of observable behavior, we investigated neurocognitive metrics\nfocusing on reward and inhibitory control, as deficits in these decision-making processes have been linked to both overeating and obesity.20\u201323 A greater understanding of the relationship\nbetween rapid weight gain and brain structure may permit more accurate identification of\nchildren at risk for obesity, thereby allowing for interventions to prevent risky eating behaviors\nbefore they start.\nMethods\nStudy design: Data were curated from the ABCD Study\u00ae (3.0 data release), which is a 21-site\n10-year longitudinal cohort study aimed to assess neurocognitive development from 9-to-20years-old. A general overview of the ABCD Study\u00ae has been published elsewhere.24\u201327 Here, we\nfocused on anthropometric data from the baseline appointment (9-to-10-years-old) and the one-\nand two-year follow-up assessments, as well as the neuroimaging data collected at baseline and\nthe two-year follow-up (ages 11-to-12-years-old). Data were available for the entire sample at\nbaseline and one-year follow-up (nbaseline=11,878; nyear1=11,235) and contained half of the participants\u2019 data for the two-year follow-up (nyear2=6,571 youth). Data collection for the baseline assessment occurred between 2016-2018.\nExclusion criteria: Details of exclusion criteria during screening for participation have been previously published28 and include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindications (e.g.,\nmetal implants), not being fluent in English, a history of major neurological disorders (e.g., low\nfunctioning autism), premature birth <28 weeks, infant hospitalization >30 days after birth, and\ndisinterest in committing to a longitudinal study.\nThe current manuscript excluded youth from the analyses if they met the following at any of the\ntime points (e.g., baseline, year 1, or year 2): (1) underweight (according to the Center for Disease Control\u2019s [CDC\u2019s] age-sex-height-weight-specific growth curves29); (2) took\nmedications known to alter food intake (e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, insulin); (3) met\ncriteria for neurological, psychiatric, or learning disabilities (e.g., attention deficit hyperactive\ndisorder); (4) met diagnostic criteria for eating disorders (e.g., anorexia, bulimia, binge eating\ndisorder) as assessed by the caregiver-reported Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS)30; (5) mislabeled sex-assigned at birth combined with a mismatch with\nsex-specific pubertal questionnaires or transgendered youth (i.e., due to sex-specific effects on\nbrain function); (6) missing covariate data; (7) height measurement error (e.g., decrease in height\nover time) (see Supplemental Materials Table S1 for details); or 8) youth with weight loss to\navoid those with restrictive eating habits (e.g., dieting). MRI quality control was performed by the ABCD Study\u2019s\u00ae Data Analytics, Informatics, & Resource Center. Tabulated exclusion\ncriteria were provided for the user to apply.\nAnthropometrics. Annually, height and weight were measured twice (and then automatically\naveraged), by a trained researcher, to the nearest 0.1in and 0.1lb; a third measurement was collected if there was a large discrepancy. Height and weight were converted into BMI (kg/m2)\nand BMI z-scores (BMIz) and percentiles according to the CDC\u2019s sex-age-heigh-weight-specific cutoffs29 per CDC-provided SAS code.\nWeight stability assessment: To evaluate excessive weight gain beyond normative\ndevelopment, youth were split into two groups based on three years of anthropometric data:\nWSHW and WG. Groups were defined based on clinical cutoffs and weight gain criteria. Clinical\ncutoffs for weight stability have used BMI z-score standard deviation (SD) criterion,31\u201334 in\nwhich an SD<0.2 is considered weight stable, and an SD\u22650.2 is considered not weight stable (Fig1A). Yet, BMI z-scores are poor indicators of weight gain over time35 and have several methodological limitations (see Hendrickson et al., (2021)36 and Palmer et al., (2021)37). Further,\nthe clinical criterion did not capture rapid weight gain (Fig1B), so we added a broader weight\ncriterion to better identify youth who were truly WSHW or WG. The WSHW youth had a BMI zscore SD<0.2 and BMI percentiles <70% at all time points. This percentile cutoff was arbitrary\nbut made to limit the number of youths who may transition to overweight at a later point. In\ncontrast, WG youth SD was \u22650.2 and had gained \u226538.3 pounds from baseline to the year-two\nfollow-up (1SD above the mean, Mweight gain=25.7\u00b112.6lbs; Fig1C). Fig1D illustrates that a growth spurt (i.e., height change) was not influencing group dichotomization. Additionally, the\ncriterion captured youth across a range of BMIs (Fig1E) and weight classes (Fig1F and Fig1G).\nOut of all youth with eligible data, 748 met criteria for the WSHW or WG group (see Supplemental Materials FigS1 for a flow chart).\nOnly 32.5% of WG youth and 39% WSHW at the one-year follow-up published\npreviously19 were included in analyses here, either because data were not yet available for the two-year follow-up, some youth with one-year rapid weight gain19 did not show continued\nweight gain trajectory over the two-years (Fig1H, Supplemental Materials TableS2), or\nbecause some youth initially identified as WSHW at the one-year follow-up were no longer WSHW at the two-year follow-up (Fig1H).\nPubertal assessment. Puberty was assessed via caregiver and self-report sex-specific questionnaires. Scores were converted into sex-specific Tanner staging categories38 and averaged\nacross caregiver and youth reports (1=Prepubertal, 2=Early puberty; 3=Mid puberty; 4=Late\npuberty; 5=Postpubertal).\nDemographic assessments. Caregiver-reported child\u2019s race/ethnicity, date of birth, and sex at\nbirth were obtained at the baseline visit (see Supplemental Materials for details).\nPrenatal assessments: Caregivers reported preterm delivery (yes/no/refuse), weeks born\npremature, birth weight, prenatal tobacco exposure before and after pregnancy confirmation\n(yes/no/refuse), and prenatal alcohol exposure before and after pregnancy confirmation\n(yes/no/refuse).\nKiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age youth (KSADS).\nThe KSADS assessed psychiatric illnesses (including eating disorders, such as binge eating,\nanorexia, and bulimia) via caregiver report. In sum, 32 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) child psychiatric diagnoses were created including codes for\npresent, remission, and lifetime diagnoses and converted into 0 (absence of diagnosis) or 1\n(definitive diagnosis). KSAD diagnoses for eating disorders were used as exclusion criteria (see\nSupplemental Materials TableS3 for details).\nCognitive Assessments: Youth completed a modified and original Behavioral Inhibition\nSystem/Behavioral Approach System (BIS/BAS) questionnaire, which is used to assess trait-\nbased reward and inhibitory control. Youth also completed the Urgency, Premeditation,\nPerseverance, Sensation Seeking, and Positive Urgency (UPPS-P) Impulsive Behavior Scale,\nwhich assess impulsivity (see Supplemental Materials Methods and TableS3 for details).\nNeuroimaging acquisition and preprocessing. MRI data were collected with 29 scanners: Details on data acquisition and analyses are published elsewhere26,39. The current manuscript\nfocuses on structural MRI data, collected with the T1-weighted, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) acquisitions. Cortical data were parcellated with Freesurfer using the Destrieux Atlas (148\nregions of interest [ROI]). Volumetric data was parcellated before surface projection using an\natlas of 16 ROIs. Structural data consisted of cortical thickness (mean thickness per ROI),\nsurface area (total surface area per ROI), and subcortical volume. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and\nmean diffusivity (MD) white-matter ROI estimates sub-adjacent to each cortical were extracted\nfrom full-shell DTI images. Subcortical estimates for each FA and MD ROI reflect a mixture of\nboth white- and gray-matter estimates."

Three elastic-net regressions were run to get\nthe independent effects of brain only, nonbrain only (i.e., covariates like age, sex, puberty,\nrace/ethnicity, highest household education, scanner ID), and a model that combined both brain\nand nonbrain features. Only models that included brain and nonbrain features are reported in the\nmain manuscript, while the results from the additional models are reported in the Supplemental\nMaterials TablesS6."

            "text": "Sample Characteristics: The WSHW group consisted of 527 youth (MWS=18.2\u00b15.1 lbs). The WG group consisted of 221 youth (MW=47.7\u00b19.1 lbs; Fig1C and Fig1D, Table1), and 63.3% were classified as having a healthy weight at baseline (Table1). Despite rapid weight gain, 17.6%\nremained of a healthy weight at the two-year follow-up (Fig1G).\nThe WG group differed significantly from those in the WSHW group on all demographic variables (age, sex, BMI, puberty, race/ethnicity, parental highest education). Youth in the WG\ngroup were two months older (p<0.001), had more advanced puberty (p<0.001), and consisted of\nmore females (p=0.026). Additionally, the WG group had higher percentages of Black and\nHispanic youth (p<0.001) and lower percentages of parents with advanced education (p<0.001;\nTable1).\nMothers of youth in the WG group reported higher rates of short-term prenatal tobacco exposure\n(i.e., exposure during the first trimester, but discontinued post pregnancy recognition; n=40,\n18.1%) compared to youth in the WSHW group (n=52, 10%; p<0.001). Although significantly different, only 7% of youth in the WG group were exposed to prenatal tobacco continuously (i.e.,\nexposure during all three trimesters; n=15) compared to youth in the WSHW group (n=42, 4%; p=0.03). However, youth in the WSHW group were more likely to be exposed to continuous alcohol exposure (n=16, 3%), than those in the WG group (n=5, 2%; p=0.40, Supplemental\nMaterials TableS4). Because youth in the WG group differed on these demographic factors,\nthey were controlled for in the subsequent analyses.\nDo regions identified as predictive of one-year rapid weight gain19 show continued structural\nchange over a two-year period of sustained weight gain?\nMixed models revealed that while controlling for age, sex, BMI, puberty, race/ethnicity,\neducation, intercranial volume, and caregiver report of prenatal exposure to alcohol and tobacco,\nthere was a main effect of Group (F(1, 1092.61)=19.2, p<0.001) and a Group \u00d7 Time interaction\n(F(1, 1241.5)=10.0, p<0.001) in the right frontomarginal gyrus and sulcus (TableS5). Youth in\nthe WG group had thinner cortices (M=2.602\u00b10.025, 95%CI [2.545,2.59], Fig4A) in this region\ncompared to those in the WSHW group (M=2.684\u00b10.023, 95%CI [2.634,2.736]] and showed greater acceleration of thinning in this region by year two (M=2.573\u00b10.03, 95%CI [2.51,2.644];\nFig4C) than WSHW youth (M=2.682\u00b10.03, 95%CI [2.652,2.274]). For a complete list of main effects and interactions, please refer to TableS5.\nAre there underlying differences in brain structure at baseline that can predict group\nmembership (e.g., WSHW/WG) two years later?\nA logistic elastic-net regression identified 39 brain ROIs, along with baseline age,\nbaseline puberty, highest household education, and motion, as features that predicted WG group\nmembership two years later (AUCtrain=0.75, Matthews Correlation Coefficient [MCC]=0.38; AUCtest=0.68, MCC=0.22). In the test set, 17 out of 33 (52%) WG and 81 out of 109 (74%) WSHW youth were correctly identified, while the overall balanced accuracy was 62.5%. The brain features included 10 cortical-thickness ROIs, 13 surface-area ROIs, 5 cortical-FA ROIs, 9\nMD ROIs, 1 subcortical-FA ROI, and 1 subcortical-MD ROI (see FigS2, Table2). ROIs\nidentified for rapid weight gain over two years were largely non-overlapping (92%, n=36) with those identified for one-year rapid weight gain19 (Table2). Results for the brain only and\nnonbrain only (i.e., covariates) are presented in the Supplemental Materials TableS6.\nFeature Beta weight Cortical thickness\nFrontomarginal gyrus RH b -0.09422 Medial orbito-olfactory sulcus RH -0.04753 Orbital gyrus LH -0.03948 Parieto-occipital sulcus LH -0.06094 Posterior ramus of the lateral sulcus RH -0.0668 Posterior ventral cingulate gyrus RH 0.012326 Rectal gyrus LH b -0.01181 Rectal gyrus RH -0.01684 Sulcus intermedius primus (of Jensen) RH 0.008321 Superior frontal sulcus LH -0.02883\nSurface Area\nAnterior occipital sulcus RH b -0.01295 Frontomarginal gyrus RH -0.00979 Inferior circular insula sulcus RH 0.003891 Inferior frontal opercular gyrus RH 0.038942 Inferior temporal gyrus LH -0.02406 Lateral orbital sulcus RH 0.014423 Middle temporal gyrus LH -0.06602 Pericallosal sulcus RH 0.083268 Planum polare of the superior temporal gyrus LH -0.11852 Postcentral sulcus LH 0.03637 Precuneus gyrus LH -0.0761 Superior frontal sulcus LH 0.048763 Superior occipital sulcus and transverse occipital sulcus LH 0.011407\nFractional anisotropy\nAccumbens area LH 0.029662 Anterior transverse temporal gyrus LH -0.0033 Parieto-occipital sulcus RH -0.04135 Posterior ventral cingulate gyrus RH -0.01394 Subcallosal gyrus RH 0.044645 Superior part of the precentral sulcus RH -0.00169\nMean diffusivity\nAccumbens area RH -0.02754 Anterior cingulate gyrus and sulcus LH -0.07266\nAt baseline, WG youth had thinner cortices (80% of the predictive CT ROIs), decreased\nMD (100% of the predictive MD ROIs), and decreased FA (67% of the predictive FA ROIs) but\ngreater surface area (64% of the predictive SA ROIs; see Supplemental Materials FigS2 for a\nvisual representation). Baseline age, puberty, and motion during DTI were positive predictors of\nWG youth two-years later, while household highest education was a negative predictor of group\nmembership.\nDo regions found at baseline to be predictive of WSHW/WG group membership two-years later show additional longitudinal structural changes over time (i.e., after weight gain onset)?\nOut of the 39 baseline brain features associated with two-year sustained weight gain, only six\nbrain features (all right hemisphere) showed significant group differences in change over the two\nyears (p\u2019s<0.001). Mean differences, confidence intervals, and significance are reported in\nTableS7. The Supplemental Materials contain visual representations of these effects (FigS3-5).\nWhen compared to WSHW youth, over the two-years, WG youth had greater reductions in cortical thickness in the right frontomarginal gyrus (aforementioned, t(4.4), p<0.001, FigS3A)\nand rectal gyrus (t(3.04),p=0.001, FigS3D), greater reductions in FA in the right parieto-occipital\nsulcus (t(3.66),p<0.001) and posterior ventral cingulate gyrus (t(3.31),p=0.001), and greater\nreductions in MD in the nucleus accumbens (t(4.42),p<0.001). Effects were independent of age,\nsex, baseline puberty, BMI, race/ethnicity, highest household education, intracranial volume,\ncaregiver report of prenatal exposure to alcohol and tobacco, and motion (for FA and MD). No\nother main effects or interactions were observed (TableS7 lists effects and interactions, corrected\nand uncorrected; TableS8 shows posthoc comparisons). Youth who were overweight/obese at\nbaseline were removed from the analyses to confirm that the prediction model was not being\ndriving by brain/BMI associations. Even with a reduced sample size (nWG=140), the elastic net identified WSHW versus WGHW youth (AUCtest=0.76, MCC=0.34, balanced accuracy=0.71, confusion matrix percent correct=67%).\nBehavioral differences between groups.\nLastly, to effectively contextualize the behavioral relevance of neurostructural differences\nbetween WSHW and WG groups, we conducted a series of analyses to determine how the WSHW and WG groups differed with respect to impulsive behaviors.\nBIS/BAS: No effects survived multiple-comparisons correction (TableS9).\nUPPS-P: WG youth scored significantly higher on the lack of perseverance subscale (i.e., the\ntendency to quit when a task gets hard or boring) (F(1, 1020.12)=7.6, p=0.005, M=7.3\u00b10.3,\n95%CI [7.11,8.35]) than those in the WSHW group (M=7.11\u00b10.3, 95%CI [6.55,7.67]; TableS10, FigS6A). For positive urgency (i.e., the tendency to respond impulsively to positive affective\nstates), there was a Group \u00d7 Time interaction (F(1, 1195.06)=11.0, p=0.002, FigSC). At\nbaseline, WG youth scored higher (M=9.02\u00b10.3, 95%CI [8.26,9.77]) compared to WSHW youth (M=8.46\u00b10.3, 95% CI [7.71,9.21], p=0.03), but no differences were observed at the two-year\nfollow-up (MWSHW=7.95\u00b10.371, 95%CI [7.18,871], p=0.2; MWG=7.43\u00b10.4, 95%CI [8.4,9.06]). All main effects and interactions were independent of age, sex, BMI, baseline puberty,\nrace/ethnicity, highest parental education, and caregiver report of prenatal exposure to alcohol or\ntobacco. No other main effects or interactions were observed (TableS10).\nDiscussion:\nMuch research has focused on understanding the metabolic consequences of rapid weight\ngain during infancy, but little is known about this weight gain phenomena later in development.\nHere, for the first time, we show that (1) there are different trajectories of rapid weight gain (i.e.,\nshort, one-year; sustained, two-year), (2) structural variation at 9-to-10-years-old can predict who\nwill experience rapid weight over longer periods of time (two years), and (3) the pattern of brain\nstructural differences between WSHW and WG groups are largely non-overlapping for shortversus long-term weight gain. Further, we show that trajectories of maturational change in some\nbrain regions are altered by two-years of rapid weight gain after its onset. These findings are of\nconsiderable significance, as they show that individual differences in brain structure may\npredispose such individuals to sustained unhealthy weight gain over longer periods of time and\nthat brain structure may change as a function of the excessive weight gain itself. Overall, our results attest to the power of studies like the ABCD Study\u00ae given its longitudinal design,\npermitting investigation of competing hypotheses/predictions, and its large demographically\ndiverse sample, allowing for the analytical power to investigate relatively rare\nphenotypes/outcomes (e.g., rapid weight gain independent of diagnostic criteria for eating\ndisorders).\nAdolescence is a developmental period of risk for weight gain due to the effects of\npuberty on growth46 and the emergence of eating disorders.11,12 Our research highlights the\nimportance of studying rapid weight gain during adolescence as we observed phenotypic\ndifferences in weight gain (i.e., short vs. sustained) that corresponded with different patterns of\nstructural variation predicting which youth would experience rapid weight gain over a short (i.e., one-year) and longer (i.e., two-year) duration. When compared to one-year weight gain,19 two-\nyear weight gain was predicted by more widespread structural variation at 9-to-10-years-old in\nregions involved with executive functioning (e.g., frontomarginal and rectal gyri, and superior\nfrontal sulcus), reward and appetitive control processing (e.g., nucleus accumbens, anterior\ncingulate), emotion regulation (e.g., anterior and postrior cingulate gyrus), and working memory (e.g., parieto-occipital sulcus).45\u201347 Decreased available resources (e.g., reduced cortical\nthickness, decreased FA) across more regions associated with decision-making and food intake,\nmay make it increasingly hard for some youth to inhibit food intake, and thereby result in longer\ndurations of rapid weight gain. Animal studies add support to this theory as neuroinflammation affects the brain prior to weight gain onset48 and is modulated by dietary intake.49 Therefore, it\nmay be that greater structural variation prior to two-year weight gain may be indicative of more\nneuroinflammation that coincides with increase caloric intake of high fat foods. This corresponds\nwith our observed phenotypic differences suggesting that food intake patterns may differ\namongst those with short and sustained weight gain. Additional longitudinal data will continue to\nadd to our knowledge of the neural differences between these weight gain phenotypes. However, combined with our previous work,19 this demonstrates the predictive power of brain structure as\na potential biomarker for identifying youth who are at risk for gaining weight over a short and\nrelatively longer period of time.\nAfter two-years of weight gain onset, we observed continued structural change in some of\nthe regions identified to be predictive of prospective two-year (but not one-year) weight gain. By\n11-to-12-years-old, youth with two-years of rapid weight gain continued to present with\nsignificant differences from their WSHW youth counterparts in regions implicated in food intake and obesity45\u201347 such as the frontomarginal and rectal gyrus, parieto-occipital sulcus, ventral\ngyrus, and nucleus accumbens. Structural variation in these regions may send the wrong signals to the hypothalamus to trigger food intake49 that creates a predisposition to and contributes to\nweight gain maintenance via a cyclical pattern garnered in food intake facilitation and\nsubsequent future weight gain. Because our data only covered a two-year time span, future\nstudies are needed to assess the role of structural variation and maintained rapid weight gain.\nInterestingly, no other regions that were predictive of two-year weight gain showed sustained\nchanges after weight gain, nor did baseline regions that were predictive of one-year weight gain.\nThere are several explanations for this: It may be that (1) a two-year period during development\nis not long enough to observe detrimental consequences of weight gain on brain structure, (2)\nthat differences in brain structure occurred earlier (or will occur later) in development, or (3)\nregions predictive of one-year weight gain may be indicative of another phenotype of weight\ngain (i.e., short term) that may be subject to little variation over time. Although the neuroinflammatory effects of weight gain have been established in humans and animals,49 its\ntemporal course is not clearly defined. Neuroinflammatory effects on brain structure may be moderated by diet and exercise,50,51 and normative developmental brain maturation and reorganization52,53 may adjust deleterious effects of weight gain on brain structure if the\ndetrimental effects of neuroinflammation can be reversed. While these findings serve as a\nreference point, additional research is needed to understand how the brain changes over a\nprolonged period in response to short and sustained (i.e., multi-year) weight gain during this period of maturation.52\nThe literature suggests that one reason for overeating may be rooted in deficits in\nimpulsivity20,54 (i.e., the ability to control urges to eat). Our data supports this possibility as WG\nyouth presented with thinner cortices in regions that are involved with impulsivity (e.g.,\nfrontomarginal gyrus and sulcus). Additionally, WG youth were more likely to act impulsively\nduring a positive mood (i.e., positive urgency) and scored higher on the lack of perseverance\nsubscale of the UPPS-S. Together, this suggests that rapid weight gain may be partly explained by deficits in impulsivity regarding food intake decisions. However, the ABCD Study\u00ae did not\nmeasure objective food intake or how decisions may change in the presence of food. Therefore,\nmore research is needed to understand how structural changes in inhibitory control regions relate\nto weight gain and impulsive food choices over time."

            "text": "To our knowledge, this was the first study to assess how the brain changes after two-\nyears of rapid weight gain in regions showing structural variation prior to weight gain. Because\nyouth did not meet diagnostic criteria for binge eating or other eating disorders, these findings\nhave relevance for understanding the brain\u2019s role in rapid weight gain development, maintenance, and its deleterious neurological and cognitive effects. However, the ABCD Study\u00ae\ndid not collect measurements of emotional overeating or objectively measured food intake,\nwhich limits the inferences that can be made from the brain and weight-gain associations. While\nthe WG youth differed significantly from those in the WSHW on several key demographics, these variables were added as covariates in the mixed models, though, we lacked statistical power to\nfurther explore these potential associations. Moreover, due to sample-size limitations, we were\nnot able to investigate longitudinal phenotypic and neurological differences between youth who had short versus sustained weight gain. Fortunately, future releases of the ABCD Study\u00ae data\nmay afford larger samples of these two phenotypes so that we can further understand how youth\nwho experience shorter durations of weight gain (and then plateau) differ from those with\nsustained weight gain. While the elastic net chose the best model that was predictive of weight\ngain, it is possible that there are other regions that are also important but that were not selected\nfor inclusion in the model. Lastly, information about parental weight, a strong predictor child obesity risk, was not collected by the ABCD Study\u00ae.\nConclusion:\nAdolescence is a period in development at risk for excess weight gain. Despite growing\nobesity trends, little is known about the causes and effects of rapid weight gain and its temporal\nnature. The current study sheds light on the predictive power of the brain as a biomarker for\nidentifying youth with rapid weight gain trajectories who may present with subclinical eating\ndisorders but do not yet meet diagnostic criteria. Moreover, a large percentage of youth were of a\nhealthy weight prior to weight gain, but still exhibited patterns of structural variation that were\nassociated with weight gain prediction and maintenance. These findings add to the literature\nsuggesting that overeating may produce neuroinflammatory effects that cause brain structure\nvariation prior to weight gain, suggesting that changes in the brain may be an early marker of\nobesity later in life. Two-year rapid weight gain was preceded by structural variation in brain\nregions associated with inhibitory control, emotion regulation, and appetitive control, and these\ndifferences were maintained over a two-year period. This suggests that structural variation in\nthese regions may be important not only for initiation but for continuation of rapid weight gain\ntrajectories throughout adolescence. Further, these findings add to the growing body of literature\naimed at understanding the causes and consequences of rapid weight gain during adolescence.\nFollow-up studies are needed to examine how these brain structures continue to differentially\nrelate to rapid weight gain trajectories in adolescence.\nConflicts of Interest: No authors report conflicts of interest.
