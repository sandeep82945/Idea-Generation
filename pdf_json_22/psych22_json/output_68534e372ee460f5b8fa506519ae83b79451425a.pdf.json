    "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19) produced an incontestable impact on the mental health of people around the world . This impact is conditioned by a complex interrelation of social, cultural, economic and COVID-19-associated factors . However, insufficient data on comparison of parameters of mental health of the population in different countries limits our understanding of these interrelations . AIM: To evaluate and compare the frequency of mental health disorders (general problems and problems related to COVID-19) and their correlations in four countries: Albania, India, Iran and Nigeria . MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the problems of mental health of the population of four countries (Albania, India, Iran and Nigeria) were investigated . The participants were selected in the period from July 07, 2020 to November 13, 2020 . The study used a cross-check anonymous online questioning to assess the degree of depression, anxiety and insomnia, which included \u201cPatient Health Questionnaire\u201d (PHQ-9), \u201cGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\u201d 7 (GAD-7) questionnaire and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) . To assess the mental health problems associated with COVID-19, the survey included Corona Anxiety Scale (CAS), Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) . To analyze the data, \uab532, Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests and multiple linear regression were used . RESULTS: In general, the prevalence of general anxiety, depression, insomnia and COVID-19-associated anxiety, was higher among the Iranian population compared to the other three countries . Risk factors for increased anxiety about the new coronavirus infection were fear, depression, trouble and age; however, these factors were different in the four studied countries . The parameter was highest (47%) in the Albanian population and lowest (20%) in India . CONCLUSIONS: This study shows different prevalence of psychological health disorders during the ongoing pandemics, including problems associated with COVID-19, in different countries . Therefore, healthcare policy and measures adopted in different countries, should be adapted to specific needs of the country rather than be based on the universal global responsive measures .",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the mental health of people across the world [1] . Despite existing reports of an increased prevalence of mental health issues during the pandemic, the majority of these issues have remained unrecognized and untreated [2\u20135] . This is likely due to the need to focus health efforts on controlling the pandemic . However, this necessary focus has opened a gap that requires further attention, and the full extent of these issues remains unknown .\nMost studies about the impact of the pandemic and its mitigation strategies on people\u2019s mental health have focused on common mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, among specific populations, e . g ., health care workers [6\u20139] . This literature is heterogeneous in methodology (e . g ., tools or scales, duration of data collection), often devoid of scales that assess COVID-19 related mental health issues, and commonly lacking in cross-country comparisons [10, 11] . However, some studies have also explored COVID-19 related mental health issues, and they have reported an increased mental health burden associated with these issues [12\u201314] . Moreover, it has been reported that coronavirus anxiety has had harmful effects on people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing across the world [15] .\nAlthough COVID-19 infection is a global issue, as it moves across borders, cultures, and socio-political environments, its impact on people\u2019s mental health is framed by these structures . Thus, the rise in mental health issues is also likely framed by country-specific characteristics, such as differences in mitigation strategies, coping responses between different populations, religion and other socio-cultural factors, and pre-existing mental and physical illnesses . Cross-country studies using validated scales and homogenous methods are needed to examine and compare the psychological effects of COV\u0130D-19 on individuals in different countries .\nThe aim of the study to estimate and compare the epidemiology of mental health issues (common mental health issues and COVID-19 related mental health issues) and their correlates across four countries, viz ., Albania, India, Iran, and Nigeria ."

The survey included sociodemographic information and the translated and validated versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [16], the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) [17], and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [18] . The survey also included three COVID-19 related mental health assessment tools, the Corona Anxiety Scale (CAS) [19], the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS) [20], and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) [21] . Prior to the study, these three COVID-19 related mental health assessment tools were translated into the included countries\u2019 local languages, after obtaining permission from the original authors, as per the standard protocol set up by the World Health Organization [22] .\nStudy tools: Corona Anxiety Scale (CAS): CAS is a self-report mental health screener of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the coronavirus . It is a brief, Likert-type, seven-item scale with good psychometric properties (validity, internal consistency, and reliability) . A total score of five or more indicates the presence of coronavirus anxiety [19] .\nObsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS): OCS is a selfreport mental health screener of obsessive thinking about COVID-19 with good psychometric properties . A total score of seven or more indicates persistent and dysfunctional thinking about COVID-19 [20] .\nFear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S): The FCV-19S is a seven-item scale that assesses people\u2019s fear of COVID-19 [21] . Participants are asked to rate their agreement with each of the seven statements on a 5-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) . Higher scores indicate greater fear of COVID-19 .\nPatient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): PHQ-9 is a Likert-type scale that assesses symptoms of depression in the previous two weeks . The total score is interpreted as suggesting mild (5\u20139), moderate (10\u201314), moderately severe (15\u201319), or severe (20\u201327) depression . A total score of 10 or more indicates a possible diagnosis of depressive disorder [16] .\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7): GAD-7 was designed to assess anxiety symptoms of the generalized anxiety disorder from the DSM-IV [17] . It comprises seven items, each scored from 0 to 3, with total scores ranging from 0 to 21 . Higher scores indicate greater self-reported anxiety symptom severity . A total score of 10 or more indicates the presence of anxiety .\nInsomnia Severity Index (ISI): The ISI is a self-rated questionnaire with seven questions evaluating usual sleep habits during the previous two weeks . Possible scores range from 0\u201328, and they are interpreted as indicating the absence of insomnia (0\u20137), or a sub-threshold (8\u201314), moderate (15\u201321) or severe (22\u201328) insomnia [18, 23] . A total score of 15 or more indicates the presence of insomnia .\nParticipant\u2019s recruitment. The online survey developed using Google\u00ae form was distributed to potential participants via email and the instant messaging application (WhatsApp\u00ae) . The form included information about the study, explaining that participation was voluntary and that\nthe survey was anonymous . Participants aged 18 years and above who consented to participate were included in the study . Data collection took place between 07th July 2020 to 13th November 2020 .\nTable 1 depicts the socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants . A total of 1787 participants were included in the final analysis (excluding duplicates = 43, nonresponse = 98 and incomplete response = 23) . A significant difference was observed among the study populations across the four countries regarding age, gender, occupation, and marital status . The Indian study population was younger (age: 30 .69 \u00b1 10 .67 years), predominantly male, and unmarried compared to other countries .\nThe number of participants who had been infected with COVID-19 was higher in the group from Iran (9 .02%) and lower in the group from Nigeria (2 .73%), versus Albania (5 .97%) and India (5 .88%) . The number of participants who reported that one or more family members had been infected with COVID-19 was also higher in the group from Iran (51 .98%), closely followed by the group from Albania (49 .24%), versus India (23 .52%) and Nigeria (21 .3%) . Similarly, the number of participants who reported living with a family member who had been infected with COVID-19 was higher in the group from Iran (6 .46%), versus Albania (4 .90%), India (2 .48%), and Nigeria (1 .26%) .\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17816/PAVLOVJ97131\nStatistical analysis was performed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS v21, Chicago, IL, USA) . Descriptive parameters were expressed in terms of mean, standard deviation, or percentage . The categorical variables in the study were tested by the chi-square test of association . The Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used to determine the differences between two or more groups . A posthoc Dunn's multiple comparisons test was used to compare the difference in the sum of ranks between two groups . Multiple linear regression analyses were also performed to evaluate the substantial determinants of coronavirus anxiety across the four countries . To test for collinearity, correlation coefficients and variation inflation factor (VIF) were examined ."

            "text": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic is a global affair, it has likely affected people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing differently across different countries . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has assessed both COVID-19 related mental health issues and common mental health issues across countries . The four included countries, Albania, India, Iran, and Nigeria are middle to low-income countries with low mental health research capacity, yet different in terms of mitigation strategies, religion, and other socio-cultural factors . The results from the present study suggest a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and coronavirus anxiety in Iran than in Albania, India, and Nigeria . Still, the prevalence of these mental health issues varied across countries, suggesting the need for locally tailored responses to the mental health needs of each country .\nWhen comparing our findings with previous studies that also used the PHQ-9 to assess depression, we found that the prevalence of depression in the four included countries seems to be diminishing . In Albania, two previous studies conducted in March-April 2020 found a prevalence of depression of 20 .44% and about 25%, respectively [24, 25] (versus 13 .56% in the present study) . Similarly, two previous studies in India, one conducted early in 2020 [26] and the other in April 2020 [27], found a prevalence of depression of 12 .0% and 10 .5%, respectively (8 .13% in the present study) . Likewise, a previous study conducted in March\u2013April 2020 in Nigeria found that 35 .1% of the healthcare workers and 23 .5% of the general population presented with depression [28], versus 15 .28% in the present study . Finally, the present study also found a prevalence of 34 .31% of depression among Iranian participants . In contrast, a previous study with nurses in Iran found depression in 37 .5% of their participants [7], signaling a similar prevalence or a slighter downward trend when compared with the other countries .\nRegarding anxiety, there was no shared trend in all four included countries when comparing our findings with previous studies . A prior study in Nigeria from March\u2013April 2020 found anxiety in 58 .4% of healthcare workers and 49 .6% of the general population [28], while we only found a prevalence of 7 .79% . Similarly, a previous study from India\nconducted in April 2020 reported a prevalence of about 14% of anxiety [27], versus 5 .19% in the present study . Likewise, a previous study in Iran, conducted in April 2020 with nurses, found a prevalence of anxiety of 38% [7], versus 22 .38% in the present study . However, a previous study in Albania found a prevalence of anxiety of about 13% [25] (reference), versus 11% in the present study, indicating a slighter shift in the prevalence of anxiety in this country . So, while it seems like the prevalence of depression and anxiety is moving down in India and Nigeria, there is a less apparent movement in the prevalence of depression in Iran and anxiety in Albania .\nFewer studies have specifically focused on exploring insomnia with validated tools such as the ISI during the COVID-19 pandemic in any of the four included countries . There is one study from Nigeria, conducted in March\u2013April 2020, using this tool, which found that about 14% of the male and 16% of the female participants reported insomnia [29], (versus 16 .87% of the Nigerian participants in the present study) . A study in India, conducted in April\u2013May 2020, found that about 15% of their participants reported insomnia using the ISI tool [30] (versus 7 .68% of the Indian participants in the present study) . The lower presence of insomnia in India could be related to the apparent reduction in the prevalence of depression and anxiety in that country . Still, this again signals the different ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing in different countries .\nRegarding COVID-19 related mental health issues, there are even fewer studies conducted in the four included countries . A previous study conducted in India (June\u2013July 2020) reported a prevalence of 3% of coronavirus anxiety (versus 7% in the present study), 13 .4% of obsession with COVID-19 (versus 4 .75% in the present study), and 47% with fear of COVID-19 . A study conducted in Nigeria (April and July 2020) with pregnant women found a prevalence of 16% of coronavirus anxiety (versus 6% in the present study) . Also, in the present study, contrary to our expectations, people infected with COVID-19 scored lower in the CAS, indicating less coronavirus anxiety . Plus, the lower explained variance for coronavirus anxiety indicated data with high variability and involvement of multiple external factors that were not considered in the study . These differences between studies and countries further signal how the COVID-19 pandemic has different effects in different communities, and how these communities\u2019 specific contexts frame these effects .\nDespite the differences in presentation between the four included countries, the previous and current study findings support the peak phenomenon of the emotional epidemic curve, as suggested by R . Ransing, et al . [1] . During the infectious disease outbreak, the emotional epidemic curve is characterized by a steep increase in mental health issues, followed by a decline and then a surge in the prevalence of mental health issues . The present study suggests that this epidemic curve may express differently in different\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17816/PAVLOVJ97131\n\u0421\u041f\u0418\u0421\u041e\u041a \u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0427\u041d\u0418\u041a\u041e\u0412 1.
