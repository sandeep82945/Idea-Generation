1. **Investigate the use of different metal ions for doping NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF.** This could potentially lead to the development of sensors with improved sensitivity, selectivity, and response time.


2. **Explore the use of Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF for the detection of other food contaminants.** This could include pesticides, heavy metals, and mycotoxins.


3. **Develop a portable device for the on-site detection of melamine in milk powder.** This would make it possible to quickly and easily test milk powder for melamine contamination in the field.


4. **Investigate the use of Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF for the detection of melamine in other food products.** This could include infant formula, dairy products, and processed foods.


5. **Study the long-term stability and reusability of Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF.** This would help to determine the feasibility of using this sensor for routine monitoring of melamine contamination in food products.
