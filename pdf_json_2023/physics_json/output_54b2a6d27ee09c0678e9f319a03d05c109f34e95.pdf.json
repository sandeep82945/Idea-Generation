    "abstractText": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the primary reason for cancer-related deaths in the US. Genetic mutations, drug resistance, the involvement of multiple signaling pathways, cancer stem cells (CSCs), and desmoplastic stroma, which hinders drug penetrance, contribute to poor chemotherapeutic efficacy. Hence, there is a need to identify novel drugs with improved delivery to improve treatment outcomes. Curcumin is one such compound that can inhibit multiple signaling pathways and CSCs. However, curcumin\u2019s clinical applicability for treating PDAC is limited because of its poor solubility in water and metabolic instability. Hence, we developed a difluorinated curcumin (CDF) analog that accumulates selectively in the pancreas and inhibits PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo. In the present work, we developed its 2-hydroxy-propyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HCD) inclusion complex to increase its water solubility and hydrolytic stability. The CDFHCD inclusion complex was characterized by spectroscopic, thermal, and microscopic techniques. The inclusion complex exhibited increased aqueous solubility, hydrolytic stability, and antiproliferative activity compared to parent CDF. Moreover, CDF and CDFHCD inhibited colony and spheroid formation, and induced cell cycle and apoptosis in PDAC cell lines. Hence, CDFHCD self-assembly is an efficient approach to increase water solubility and anticancer therapeutic efficacy, which now warrants advancement towards a clinical proof of concept in PDAC patients.",

PDAC is characterized by rapid progression, invasiveness, and profound drug resistance, resulting in poor treatment outcomes [1,2]. PDAC is expected to be the second leading reason for deaths associated with cancer by the end of this decade [3]. Despite the extensive research conducted in diagnostic and therapeutic PDAC treatment, it remains a significant problem worldwide [4,5]. Moreover, the existence of germline and acquired genetic mutations such as KRAS, TP53, CDK2NA, and SMAD4/DPC4 are associated with an even poorer prognosis [6]. The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) [7], the occurrence of tumor-associated immune\nInt. J. Mol.

The current chemotherapy for PDAC consists of gemcitabine combined with nab paclitaxel [10] or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) [11,12], which only improves overall survival between 8.5 and 11 months with a response rate of 23\u201331% [10]. Hence, it is essential to identify novel targets that are more effective treatments and that improve survival for PDAC patients. Nature is a rich source of compounds called phytochemicals, which inhibit multiple signaling pathways, multiple cell types, and CSCs and their signaling pathways [13,14]. Phytochemicals have gained wide attention in the last 20 years because of their excellent safety profiles and ability to target several signaling pathways in cancer cells [13,14]. We have synthesized and studied analogs of phytochemicals for their anti-cancer activities, including curcumin [15], resveratrol [16\u201318], honokiol [19], plumbagin [20\u201322], cucurbitacin B and I [23], celastrol [24], triptolide [24], chalcones [25], mangostin [26], and quinomycin A [27]. We have summarized the biological activities of these phytochemicals and their analogs against various cancers in recent review articles [13,14,28\u201335]. We selected curcumin from the plant Curcuma longa. Curcumin has been found to be effective against various cancers; however, its poor bioavailability and poor water solubility have limited its clinical utility [13,14,28\u201330]. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new chemical analog of curcumin, 3,4-difluoro-benzo-curcumin, commonly known as CDF. CDF showed superior bioavailability, effective delivery to and uptake into pancreatic tissues, and the inhibition of the PDAC cell growth [36,37]. Cancer studies investigating CDF have demonstrated its effects on multiple cancerassociated pathways and phenotypes. CDF significantly inhibited the sphere-forming ability (pancospheres) of PDAC cells by down-regulating the cancer stem cell (CSC) markers EPCAM and CD44. CDF treatment inhibited tumor growth and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and miR-21 in a mouse xenograft model, while increasing both PTEN and miR-200. The up-regulation of miR-200 in tumors remained [38,39], and the reduction in miR-21 resulted in the induction of PTEN [40]. The CDF compound inhibited VEGF and IL-6 production and, when in hypoxic conditions, further reduced Nanog, Oct4, and EZH2 expression and miR-210 and miR-21 levels in PDAC cells [41]. CDF inhibited cell growth [42] in prostate cancer as well as chemo-resistant colon cancer cells by eradicating CSCs [43]. It inhibits the growth of 5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin-resistant colon cancer cells by down-regulating miR-21 levels and restoring PTEN levels with decreased p-Akt levels [44\u201346]. Recent reports have also shown that CDF inhibits MMP9 expression and activity in 549 and H1299 NSCLC cells [47]. Basak and coworkers [48] reported the anticancer activity of CDF delivered via a liposomal formulation in cisplatin-resistant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma CSCs. Recently, CDF-folic acid-conjugated polymeric micelles have also been shown to have inhibitory effects on ovarian and cervical cancer cells by inhibiting NF-kB and causing significant apoptosis [49]. Although CDF showed remarkable anticancer activity compared to curcumin in vitro, poor water solubility and metabolic instability present significant barriers to advancing this compound to clinical proof of concept. Cyclodextrin inclusion complexes have been used to enhance the water solubility, improve the bioavailability and enhance the biological activity of several phytochemicals and their synthetic analogs [15,22,50]. Yallapu and coworkers [51] have recently reported on the enhanced therapeutic activity of the \u03b2-cyclodextrin\u2013curcumin inclusion complex compared to free curcumin against prostate cancer. Previously, pharmacokinetic studies conducted in our laboratory showed that CDF-\u03b2-cyclodextrin conjugate increases the systemic bioavailability of CDF from 6 ng/mL to 110 ng/mL, as well as tissue uptake from 300 ng/mL to 410 ng/mL in the serum and the pancreas, respectively. Moreover, we could not detect CDF following four hours of administration. In contrast, we noticed the CDF- \u03b2-cyclodextrin inclusion complex at 35 ng/mL and 280 ng/mL in serum and the pancreas, respectively. These data indicated that \u03b2-cyclodextrin conjugation increased the solubility and stability of CDF in the blood\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 6336 3 of 19\nand pancreas [15]. Although \u03b2-cyclodextrin conjugates have been extensively used to improve the solubility of the drugs, toxicities are associated with clinical use [52,53]. However, the 2-hydroxypropyl derivative of \u03b2-cyclodextrin (HCD) is well tolerated when dosed orally and utilized in several approved drug products [54,55]. Hence, we prepared and assessed the anticancer properties of the CDF 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HCD) inclusion complex against PDAC cells."

It therefore only allowed the identification of clusters of signals due to the different types of glycosidic or 2-hydroxypropyl protons, which made it difficult to appropriately assign the protons; meanwhile, the appearance of the methoxy protons of CDF in the CDFHCD spectra further complicated the assignments. These peaks in the methoxy groups of the CDF were shifted from 3.798 to 3.788 ppm (\u22120.010), and from 3.859 to 3.849 ppm (\u22120.010) after the formation of the inclusion complex, respectively, suggesting the involvement of aromatic rings in the complexation of CDF with HCD.

Nonetheless, the peaks of CDF between 6 and 8 ppm in the CDFHCD spectra were not clear enough to assign the shifts; this was due to the merging and reduced multiplicity of the peaks, which is characteristic of an inclusion complex [51,66,67].

CDF and CDFHCD Inhibit the Proliferation of PDAC Cells\nFirst, we studied the effects of CDF and CDFHCD (dose range 0\u20135 \u00b5M) on the proliferation of PDAC cell lines based on their mutation, origin, and metastatic potential. Both CDF and CDFHCD inhibited (time- and dose-dependent effects) the proliferation of MiaPaCa-2 (KRASG12C, p53R248W), Panc-1 (KRASG12D, p53R273H), Panc 01728 (patientderived cell line), and S2-007 (Metastatic) cells (Figure 3A). The IC50 values of CDF and CDFHCD against PDAC cell lines at different time points are summarized (Figure 3B). We observed the significant increase in the antiproliferative activity of CDF after HCD inclusion complexation (Figure 3B, p < 0.05), which can be attributed to a higher water solubility and a higher uptake of CDF into pancreatic cancer cells through the formation of the cyclodextrin inclusion complex [15]. We then used the clonogenic assay to study the long-lasting effects of CDF and CDFHCD on PDAC cell lines.

Further, we evaluated the effect of CDF and CDFHCD on HPNE cells (immortalized epithelial pancreatic ductal cell line) to characterize the cytotoxicity potential. While CDF produced cytotoxicity in HPNE cells at a 1 \u00b5M concentration, CDFHCD did not induce any toxicity up to a 5 \u00b5M concentration (Supplementary Figure S1). This suggests the potentially lower cytotoxic effects on immortalized cells. However, more detailed studies with different normal cell lines are needed in the future to evaluate this.

After 48 h, the cell culture media containing CDF or CDFHCD was replaced with fresh drug-free media and grown for 10\u201314 days.

CDF and CDFHCD Induce Cell Cycle Arrest\nWe studied the effects of CDF and CDFHCD on cell cycle progression using flow cytometry. The treatment of CDF and its inclusion of complex CDFHCD caused a significant (p < 0.01) increase in the number of cells in the sub-G0 phase at 24 h and 48 h in PDAC cell lines (Figures 5A,B and S2A,B). Moreover, the concentration of CDF that is equivalent to CDFHCD produced less potent effects than CDFHCD. The overexpression of Cyclin D1 plays a role in cancer progression and development [70] by controlling the cell cycle progression. Hence, we performed the western blot analysis and observed the significant (p < 0.01) downregulation of cyclin D1 after CDF and CDFHCD treatment (Figure 5C,D). These data suggested that CDF and CDFHCD induce cell cycle arrest in PDAC cells.\n2.7.3. CDF and CDFHCD Induce Apoptosis\nThe accumulation of cancer cells in a sub-G0 stage after CDF and CDFHCD treatment can result from DNA fragmentation, suggesting probable cytotoxic effects. To study this, we utilized the Annexin V/PI assay with flow cytometry. We observed an increased cell number over 48 h in the late apoptosis stage after CDF and CDFHCD treatment compared to the control cells (Figures 6A and S3A). We observed CDF autofluorescence interfering in early apoptosis readings differentially; hence, we cannot decisively determine the role that CDF and CDFHCD play in early apoptosis. We further confirmed apoptosis using caspase 3/7 assays to examine the effector activity of caspase. CDF and CDFHCD treatment increased the caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 6B, p < 0.01) in PDAC cells. Mechanistically, the western blot analysis showed the enhanced expression of cleaved PARP protein (p < 0.05) in CDF and CDFHCD-treated cells (Figures 6C and S3B). The CDF and CDFHCD treatment reduced the levels of the anti-apoptotic markers Mcl1 (p < 0.05) and Bcl2 (p < 0.01), while proapoptotic protein Bax expression was not significantly changed (Figure 6C). A decrease in Bcl-2 levels is established as a mechanism of apoptosis in cancer cells [71]. These data suggest the utility of CDF and CDFHCD in combination with\nInt. J. Mol.

We further confirmed apoptosis using caspase 3/7 assays to examine the effector activity of caspase. CDF and CDFHCD treatment increased the caspase 3/7 activity (Figure 6B, p < 0.01) in PDAC cells. Mechanistically, the western blot analysis showed the enhanced expression of cleaved PARP protein (p <\n0.05) in CDF and CDFHCD-treated cells (Figures 6C and S3B). The CDF and CDFHCD\ntreatment reduced the levels of the anti-apoptotic markers Mcl1 (p < 0.05) and Bcl2 (p <\n0.01), while proapoptotic protein Bax expression was not significantly changed (Figure\n6C). A decrease in Bcl-2 levels is established as a mechanism of apoptosis in cancer cells\n[71]. These data suggest the utility of CDF and CDFHCD in combination with the first-\nline chemotherapeutic drugs [72,73]. These data indicate that the CDF and its inclusion in\nthe CDFHCD complex can induce apoptosis in PDAC cells.\n2.7.4. CDF and CDFHCD Inhibit the Spheroid Formation\nIncreasing evidence suggests that CSCs are involved in causing drug resistance, aggressiveness, and recurrence in PDAC [74]. Several surface markers that mark CSCs, including CD44, have been identified in PDAC [75]. Moreover, the overexpression of CD44 induces the activation of cMyc, which in turn activates the MEK and ERK pathway to inhibit apoptosis in cancer cells [76]. cMyc is also overexpressed in CSCs in order to maintain the pluripotency [77], and its overexpression is involved in PDAC progression and drug resistance [78]. Recent studies have also shown that doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a novel PDAC CSC marker [79]. Hence, to completely eradicate cancer, it is essential to understand CSCs\u2019 growth and develop novel therapeutic agents that target those mechanisms. It is reported that CSCs form spheroids in ultra-low attachment plates in suspension culture. Hence, we used a spheroid formation assay to analyze the effect of CDF and CDFHCD on CSCs. CDF and CDFHCD treatment reduced the spheroid formation (size\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 6336 11 of 19\nand number) in MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells (Figure 7A,B). Moreover, CDF and CDFHCD treatment downregulated the expression of CD44 (p < 0.01), DCLK1 (p < 0.01) and cMYC (p < 0.01) in MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells (Figures 7C and S4). These datasets showed that CDF and CDFHCD inhibit spheroid growth and CSC marker protein expression. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 21\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 6336 12 of 19"

CDF and CDFHCD inhibited colony and spheroid formation, producing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PDAC cell lines. Moreover, HCD improved the hydrolytic stability of CDF. Future studies will be directed toward characterizing the ability of the CDFHCD inclusion complex to deliver sufficient CDF into PDAC tumors, the engagement of CDF with the target(s) within PDAC cells, the effects on tumor development and progression, as well as survival in validated mouse models of PDAC.\nInt.
