Biological membranes, primarily composed of lipids, envelop each living cell. The intricate composition and organization of membrane lipids, including the variety of fatty acids they encompass, serve a dynamic role in sustaining cellular structural integrity and functionality. Typically, modifications in lipid composition coincide with consequential alterations in universally significant signaling pathways. Exploring the various fatty acids, which serve as the foundational building blocks of membrane lipids, provides crucial insights into the underlying mechanisms governing a myriad of cellular processes, such as membrane fluidity, protein trafficking, signal transduction, intercellular communication, and the etiology of certain metabolic disorders. Furthermore, comprehending how alterations in the lipid composition, especially concerning the fatty acid profile, either contribute to or prevent the onset of pathological conditions stands as a compelling area of research. Hence, this review aims to meticulously introduce the intricacies of membrane lipids and their constituent fatty acids in a healthy organism, thereby illuminating their remarkable diversity and profound influence on cellular function. Furthermore, this review aspires to highlight some potential therapeutic targets for various pathological conditions that may be ameliorated through dietary fatty acid supplements. The initial section of this review expounds on the eukaryotic biomembranes and their complex lipids. Subsequent sections provide insights into the synthesis, membrane incorporation, and distribution of fatty acids across various fractions of membrane lipids. The last section highlights the functional significance of membrane-associated fatty acids and their innate capacity to shape the various cellular physiological responses. 1. conclusions and future perspectives This review intends to provide an in-depth overview of the lipids of eukaryotic cell membrane lipids, with a particular emphasis on fatty acids. It introduces the extensive array of lipids present in biomembranes and delves into their composition within healthy organisms, thereby illustrating the intricate nature of lipid metabolism and its fundamental role within cells. This perspective underscores the remarkable adaptability and flexibility inherent in the fatty acid profiles of biomembranes, enabling organisms to rapidly respond to various stimuli, including alterations in environmental temperature, dietary factors, inflammatory processes, or diseases. Thus, the absence of a universally defined “physiologically normal fatty acid composition” underscores the natural variability in fatty acid composition. This natural phenomenon is, likewise, a continuous process of adaptation. This review further provides an in-depth exploration of fatty acid biosynthesis and postsynthetic modifications, such as elongation and desaturation. In addition, it highlights the preferences of fatty acids for incorporation into diverse complex membrane lipids and their roles in biological systems, encompassing both physicochemical properties and the regulation of biological signaling. This understanding holds significant implications across various disciplines, including lipid-based drug delivery, cell membrane engineering, and the advancement of lipid-based biomaterials. Evidently, the pivotal role of fatty acids in biomembranes is ascending and is poised to exert a substantial influence across various disciplines, notably within the realms of nutrition and medicine. This review serves to illuminate the multifaceted roles and contributions of distinct membrane lipids, along with their associated fatty acids, with a specific focus on matters pertaining to health and the intricate aspects of inflammatory responses. Enhancing our comprehensive comprehension of the diverse repertoire of membrane lipids stands to be invaluable for assessing the overall health of organisms. The trajectory of the field nutrition is set to emphasize progressively specific fatty acids that are indispensable for organism health. In this context, the n3 and n6-fatty acids are assuming paramount significance due to their critical roles as precursors for bioactive lipids that play a pivotal role in the modulation of inflammatory processes. They also contribute indispensably to the development and sustenance of vital organ functions, exemplified by the brain, heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. Elevated levels of these fatty acids have been consistently correlated with to the regulation of chronic maladies, encompassing diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and certain forms of cancer. However, it is crucial to recognize that the opti-
mization of fatty acid biosynthesis, the preservation of their stability, and a comprehensive understanding of their various roles in biological systems continue to remain areas ripe for exploration.
