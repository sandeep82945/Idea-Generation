1. **Investigate the effect of linker length and rigidity on the stability and performance of peptide-based biosensors in different environmental conditions.** This could involve testing the biosensors in various temperatures, humidity levels, and pH values to determine how these factors affect their sensitivity, selectivity, and stability.


2. **Explore the use of different types of linkers, such as non-proteinogenic amino acids or synthetic polymers, to further improve the performance of peptide-based biosensors.** This could involve investigating linkers with different chemical properties, such as hydrophobicity or charge, to determine how they affect the binding affinity of the biosensors to different target molecules.


3. **Develop new methods for immobilizing peptides on transducer surfaces to improve the stability and performance of peptide-based biosensors.** This could involve investigating different immobilization techniques, such as covalent bonding, physical adsorption, or self-assembly, to determine which methods provide the best results for different types of peptides and target molecules.


4. **Investigate the use of peptide-based biosensors for the detection of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as those associated with different diseases or environmental pollutants.** This could involve developing new peptides that are specifically tailored to bind to these VOCs and testing the biosensors in real-world applications.


5. **Explore the use of peptide-based biosensors for the development of new diagnostic tools for diseases such as cancer or respiratory diseases.** This could involve developing biosensors that can detect specific VOCs that are associated with these diseases and testing the biosensors in clinical settings to determine their accuracy and sensitivity.
