The characterization and cytotoxicity of the essential oil from Conyza bonariensis (L.) aerial parts (CBEO) were previously conducted. The major compound was (Z)-2-lachnophyllum ester (EZ), and CBEO exhibited significant ROS-dependent cytotoxicity in the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28. Herein, we employed the Molegro Virtual Docker v.6.0.1 software to investigate the interactions between the EZ and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB), and the Protein Kinase B (PKB/AKT). Additionally, in vitro assays were performed in SK-MEL-28 cells to assess the effect of CBEO on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and these signaling pathways by flow cytometry and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using MAPKs inhibitors. CBEO induced a significant increase in the sub-G1 peak, as well as biochemical and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. The in-silico results indicated that EZ interacts with Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1 (ERK1), c-Jun N-terminal Kinase 1 (JNK1), p38α MAPK, NF-κB, and PKB/AKT. Moreover, CBEO modulated the ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK, NF-κB, and PKB/AKT activities in SK-MEL-28 cells. Furthermore, CBEO’s cytotoxicity against SK-MEL-28 cells was significantly altered in the presence of MAPKs inhibitors. These findings support the in vitro antimelanoma effect of CBEO through apoptosis induction, and the modulation of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, NF-κB, and PKB/AKT activities. 1. conclusions Preliminary data obtained by Ferreira et al. (2023) [19] have demonstrated that the in vitro antimelanoma effect of CBEO is Reactive Oxygen Species-dependent. Oxidative stress is implicated in the modulation of various intracellular signaling pathways, including MAPKs, NF-κB, and PKB/AKT. Herein, our results provide evidence of the involvement of these signaling pathways in the apoptosis induced by CBEO on SK-MEL-28 cells.
