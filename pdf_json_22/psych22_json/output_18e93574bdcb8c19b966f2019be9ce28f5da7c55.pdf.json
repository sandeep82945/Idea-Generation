Music interventions show promise for supporting early parent\u2013child relationships; however, their effects on attachment security are unclear as few music intervention evaluations have measured attachment outcomes. This systematic literature review aimed to synthesize published empirical literature examining the effects of music interventions on relationship quality between typically developing children aged birth to 5\u00a0years old and their parents. The study aimed to: (1) establish whether music interventions were associated with changes in attachment-related outcomes; (2) identify music intervention\nJournal of Music Therapy, 59(4), 2022, 430\u2013459 https://doi.org/10.1093/jmt/thac012\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\ncharacteristics likely to support secure attachment; and (3) elucidate processes through which music techniques may have contributed to attachment-related changes. Included interventions focused on the parent\u2013child dyad, involved a substantial music component delivered by a music therapist or an allied health professional, and assessed and/ or described relationship outcome/s. A\u00a0 total of 23 studies describing 15 unique interventions met criteria for inclusion and represented approximately 808\u2013815 parent\u2013child dyads. Mothers were the most common caregivers. All interventions demonstrated some effectiveness, including in attachment-related outcomes such as bonding, emotional co-regulation, and parental sensitivity. All interventions involved singing, suggesting it may be especially suitable for supporting parent\u2013 child attachment; other music techniques used included instrument playing and movement to music. Findings suggested that music interventions may facilitate attachment-related changes through intervening in psychological processes, including parental sensitivity, reflective functioning, and emotional co-regulation. Future research should develop music interventions aiming specifically to support attachment quality, and music intervention evaluations should use validated attachment assessments and longitudinal study designs.\nKeywords: children; early intervention; infants; music; systematic review\nParent\u2013child attachment refers to a child accessing their parent as a \u201csafe haven\u201d to provide comfort when they are distressed, and a \u201csecure base\u201d from which to explore their environment. A\u00a0secure attachment develops when a parent consistently meets their child\u2019s needs in these areas, while an insecure attachment develops when a parent does not meet some or all of these needs reliably (Ainsworth et\u00a0al., 1978; Bowlby, 1969; Powell et\u00a0al., 2014). Parent\u2013child attachment quality can be influenced by proximal and distal factors, such as the parent\u2019s history with their own caregivers and environmental stressors (e.g., parental mental illness; Fonagy et\u00a0al., 1991; Sroufe, 2005; Tronick, 2007). Insecure attachment (which encompasses ambivalent, avoidant and disorganized subtypes; Ainsworth et\u00a0al., 1978; Main & Solomon, 1986) in early childhood is associated with challenges in adulthood (e.g., mental health difficulties; Sroufe, 2005); therefore, interventions that support attachment security in early childhood are warranted.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nParent\u2013child attachment security is influenced by various factors, including parental sensitivity and parental reflective functioning (PRF). Parental sensitivity refers to the parent\u2019s level of \u201ccontingent responsiveness\u201d (Nicholls & Kirkland, 1996, p.\u00a059; i.e., the appropriateness, timing, and consistency of their responses) to their child\u2019s needs (Ainsworth et\u00a0al., 1978; Bigelow et\u00a0al., 2010; Nicholls & Kirkland, 1996). PRF refers to the parent\u2019s ability to understand and reflect on their child\u2019s internal states and engage in observation and self-reflection of their own internal experience. It is theorized to enable a parent to understand their child\u2019s inner world and thereby respond sensitively to their needs (Fonagy et\u00a0al., 1991; Slade, 2007). For example, a mother who interprets her infant\u2019s crying as a reflection of distress may respond by soothing her infant. Parent\u2013child attachment is also influenced by affect attunement, which refers to parental mirroring, imitation and/or matching of the child\u2019s internal states in a way that shows the child that their parent has resonated with their felt experience (Stern, 1985), and emotional co-regulation, which involves the mutual regulation of affective states by parent and child. Emotional co-regulation encompasses shared positive affect and repair of negative affect (e.g., a parent reconnecting with their child and soothing them; Guo et\u00a0 al., 2015; Schore, 2001; Tronick, 2007).\nMusic interventions have features which make them suited to supporting parent\u2013child attachment (Edwards, 2011; Perry, 2009). Parents can attune to and co-regulate their child\u2019s emotional states using musical elements such as rhythm and pitch (Malloch, 1999; Stern, 1985; Trehub et\u00a0 al., 1997). Aspects of music (e.g., rhythm) can provide \u201cpatterned, repetitive neural input\u201d (Perry, 2009, p.\u00a0243), which is proposed to support the regulation of the lower order brain structures often affected by early attachment problems (Perry, 2009). For example, a parent could provide patterned input by singing and rhythmically patting their infant in time with their singing. Singing can also improve self-regulation and social engagement through inducing changes in affect and physiology (Porges, 2011). These features of music may enhance co-regulation through improving self-regulation (Perry, 2009; Porges, 2011; Schore, 2001). Additionally, music-based parenting interventions are reported to be more acceptable to parents than other forms of therapy (e.g., behavioral therapy; Abad & Williams,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\n2007). High acceptability of music interventions may facilitate parental engagement in intervention, which could potentially lead to greater relationship improvements than interventions with poorer parental engagement (Hackworth et\u00a0al., 2018).\nThe potential of music interventions for supporting parent\u2013 child attachment is evident. However, it is not possible to conclude whether music interventions increase attachment security, as no studies have evaluated the efficacy of music interventions using valid and reliable observational methods to assess parent\u2013child attachment quality (e.g., the Strange Situation Procedure; Ainsworth et\u00a0 al., 1978; Main & Solomon, 1986). Nonetheless, studies have evaluated the effects of music interventions on attachment-related outcomes (e.g., parental sensitivity; Nicholson et\u00a0 al., 2008). Examining studies which explore music intervention effects on attachment-related outcomes may enable researchers to draw preliminary conclusions about whether music interventions may increase attachment security.\nA systematic review of studies evaluating whether music interventions support parent\u2013child attachment quality has not yet been undertaken, possibly because no studies have examined the impact of music interventions on attachment security. However, some studies have reviewed available theoretical and research literature about music interventions to support parent\u2013child attachment. A\u00a0descriptive literature review examining music therapy for children up to 5\u00a0years old found no peer-reviewed articles exploring music intervention effects on parent\u2013child attachment, suggesting that there was limited or no empirical research on attachmentspecific music interventions from 1990 to 2012 (Tuomi et\u00a0 al., 2017). Other authors theorized about using music techniques to support parent\u2013child attachment, although they did not systematically review music intervention evaluations (Creighton, 2011; Edwards, 2011).\nThere is currently no evidence available to definitively establish whether music interventions improve attachment security. Therefore, the present study focused on synthesizing available literature exploring music intervention characteristics, attachmentrelated outcomes, and change processes during music interventions. Change processes were defined by Elliott (2010) as processes during therapy and changes occurring within clients throughout therapy that contribute to outcomes. The aim of the review was\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nto locate and synthesize peer-reviewed literature evaluating the impact of music interventions on parent\u2013child relationships for typically developing children aged from birth to 5\u00a0years old. The specific research aims were: (1) to determine whether the existing evidence suggested changes in attachment-related outcomes due to music interventions; (2) to identify characteristics of music interventions likely to support early attachment security; and (3) to describe the processes through which particular music techniques may have contributed to attachment-related parenting and parent\u2013 child relationship changes.\nMethod\nStudy\u00a0Design\nA systematic review was undertaken to locate peer-reviewed primary publications evaluating the impact of music interventions on parent\u2013child relationships with typically developing children aged from birth to 5\u00a0years old. The PRISMA-P (2015) checklist (Moher et\u00a0al., 2015) informed the design and methodology of the systematic review protocol and reporting of study findings. Given the small number of studies overall, various research designs (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods) were included, comprising a convergent integrated approach to data extraction (Lizarondo et\u00a0 al., 2020). Unlike most systematic reviews using a convergent integrated approach, data was not transformed, and findings were presented as a narrative synthesis integrating both quantitative and qualitative findings (Heyvaert et\u00a0 al., 2017). The first author oversaw the narrative synthesis process in consultation with the second and third authors. All included studies were undertaken in real-world rather than laboratory settings and many studies did not involve stringently manualized or standardized intervention protocols, suggesting that the body of research more closely resembled effectiveness than efficacy studies overall (Singal et\u00a0al., 2014). Thus, the authors determined that it was appropriate to conduct quality and effectiveness assessments to explore whether music interventions improve attachment-related outcomes. The quality and effectiveness assessments were not intended to establish intervention effectiveness for improving attachment security; therefore, the authors determined that it was not necessary to conduct interrater reliability.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024"

            "text": "The first and second authors developed the search strategy and the inclusion criteria. Search terms were developed from initial database searches and included key terms in four areas: music or singing, caregivers, children, and relationship quality including attachment. Terms were refined and those not returning records were excluded (e.g., \u201ctoddler\u201d, \u201cfather*\u201d, \u201ccaregiver*\u201d, \u201cfamily,\u201d and \u201cfamilies\u201d). Final search terms and Boolean operators were: (music OR singing) AND (attachment OR bond* OR respons* OR relationship* OR interaction*) AND (parent* OR mother*) AND (child* OR infant* OR bab*).\nDatabases likely to include music interventions were searched, particularly PsycInfo, Scopus, EbscoHost (indexing RILM Abstracts of Music Literature and Music Index) and selected databases from Proquest (refer to Supplementary Material for a list of the databases searched from Proquest). Additional records were located by mining the reference lists of identified articles and other closely related articles. The first author conducted searches and screening during December 2019, first by title, then abstract and finally full text, with articles not meeting inclusion criteria at each stage being excluded. Decisions about inclusion were discussed with the second and third authors for 20 records where decisions were unclear to the first author. No date range was applied and searches were limited to peer-reviewed publications in English. Gray literature, commentary pieces, and clinical reflections, which did not evaluate an intervention, were excluded.\nParticipants Studies were included if participants were dyads comprising a parent and a typically developing child. \u201cParent\u201d refers to a child\u2019s primary caregiver, including biological parents, foster carers, adoptive parents, or other caregivers (e.g., grandparent). Studies with antenatal samples were included if therapist and/or parent intervention delivery continued postnatally and studies combining parent\u2013fetal and postpartum parent\u2013infant bonding were included if postpartum findings were reported. Studies reporting caregiver mental illness, hospitalization, and/or domestic violence were included because the focus was on relationship quality, irrespective of potential contributors to relationship difficulties.\nStudies involving a child without their parent, children with a mean age over 5\u00a0years old, and/or children with additional needs\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nwere excluded. Children with additional needs were defined as children who had developmental delays, physical and/or intellectual disabilities, medical conditions, physical injuries, or were in hospital (e.g., premature infants). Samples including typically developing children and children with additional needs were only included if findings were presented separately for each group.\nInterventions Music interventions were defined by the researchers as the intentional use of music techniques (e.g., singing, songwriting, playing instruments, or music-assisted relaxation) for therapeutic purposes. To meet review criteria, interventions primarily focused on music techniques, and the study authors clearly outlined the music techniques and described how they were used. Interventions aimed to improve parenting or the parent\u2013child relationship, interaction, bond, or attachment quality with a focus on the parent\u2013child dyad, even in group sessions or with other family members present. Included studies reported outcomes quantitatively (e.g., questionnaires) or qualitatively (e.g., parent interviews).\nInterventionists Intervention delivery could be by (a) a qualified music therapist (henceforth, music therapist); (b) an allied health professional (e.g., nurse, psychologist); (c) a parent delivering an intervention to their child after receiving training, which clearly instructed the parent about when and how to deliver the intervention outside of sessions, from an allied health professional or music therapist (i.e., parent-mediated interventions); or (d) an allied health professional or music therapist with another professional (e.g., musician, researcher). Interventions primarily led by other individuals, including but not limited to musicians or teachers, were excluded to ensure that the interventionist had appropriate training to deliver a therapeutic intervention which aimed to improve parent\u2013child relationship quality."

Each study was classified as Weak, Medium, or Strong based on the percentage of study components present (i.e., \u201cYes\u201d responses) which demonstrate a strong design. The first and second authors developed the following classifications: Weak (<25%), Weak to Medium (25\u201330%), Medium (31\u201369%), Medium to Strong (70\u201375%), and Strong (>75%; refer to the Supplementary Table 1 for the score and percentage of each quality assessment). Percentages rather than numerical criteria were used because the number of study components identified as representing a strong design differed depending on the Critical Appraisal\u00a0tool.\nStrength of evidence of quantitative studies was determined using the JBI Levels of Evidence for Effectiveness, in which Level 1 (experimental designs) was the strongest and Level 5 (expert opinion and bench research) was the weakest. Strength of evidence of qualitative studies was determined using the JBI Levels of Evidence for Meaningfulness, wherein Level 1 (qualitative or mixed-methods systematic review) was the strongest, and Level 5 (expert opinion) was the weakest (Joanna Briggs Institute Levels of Evidence and Grades of Recommendation Working Party, 2013). The quality of the body of evidence overall was rated based on the quality assessments of individual studies."

Qualitative and case study ratings were based on \u201cclinically significant\u201d changes (Kazdin, 2001), defined as whether the intervention led to noticeable improvements in parent\u2013child relationship quality (e.g., parents perceiving a closer parent\u2013child relationship). Improvement in quantitative studies was defined as: statistically significant (p < .05) increases from pre- to post-intervention (quasi-experimental designs) or higher relationship quality in the intervention than control group (concurrent cohort or randomized experiment designs); a clear trend indicating clinically significant improvement (even if\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nnot reaching statistical significance) for the aforementioned study designs; or a majority of participants (i.e., 75% or more) reporting improved relationship outcomes post-intervention on descriptive statistics.\nStudies were rated as \u201cVery Effective\u201d if study authors reported clinically meaningful improvements for a majority (i.e., at least 75%) of participants on all aspects of the parent\u2013child relationship overall in qualitative designs, or if improvements were reported on all overall and a majority of subscale scores in quantitative designs. Studies were rated as \u201cSomewhat Effective\u201d if author/s reported no improvement for a majority of participants on one or more aspects of the parent\u2013child relationship overall in qualitative designs (e.g., parental sensitivity was described as unchanged for four out of five participants after intervention) or if any overall scores and/or a majority of subscale scores did not show improvement in quantitative designs. Although the rating refers to an individual study rather than all studies exploring an intervention, studies rated as Somewhat Effective are labeled as \u201cSomewhat Effective interventions\u201d where appropriate throughout the paper. A\u00a0 classification of \u201cNot Effective\u201d was deemed unnecessary, as all studies demonstrated some effectiveness. For mixed-methods studies where the rating was discrepant between quantitative and qualitative components of the study, the overall rating was based on the aspect of the study rated as lower in effectiveness.

The first author extracted main themes in qualitative studies from reported themes and/or descriptions of change due to intervention. Some study authors clearly described main themes theorizing about changes in the parent\u2013child relationship; however, the authors of other studies did not clearly identify and/or describe the main themes. When main themes were unclear, attachment-related psychological frameworks (e.g., maternal sensitivity [Ainsworth et\u00a0 al., 1978]) were used to interpret qualitative descriptions of change and identify attachment-related behaviors described in the original papers\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\n(e.g., quality of parental responses to their child being identified as parental sensitivity).\nThe outcomes and main themes were synthesized according to four categories which emerged during the synthesis process. Parent\u2013child relationship findings were synthesized to respond to the first study aim. Parental mental health and children\u2019s emotional and behavioral functioning were included because they may relate to, impact, and/or mediate changes in parent\u2013child attachment (Schechter & Willheim, 2009; Sroufe 2005). Other outcomes, particularly intervention acceptability and parents\u2019 use of music techniques outside of sessions, were also explored as they may influence or reflect engagement in interventions and could thereby contribute to parent\u2013child relationship changes (Hackworth et\u00a0al., 2018).\nThe analytic strategy to synthesize change processes was developed by the first and second authors. The first author identified qualitative data and discussion sections of quantitative articles which speculated about change processes, and recorded descriptions of change processes from these studies in word processing documents. The first author developed main themes by identifying descriptions of change consistent with attachment theory, with assistance from the second author. Consensus about main themes was reached following discussion between the first and second authors. Themes directly related to attachment, those evident in multiple studies and/or described in detail were given greater emphasis when reporting findings than themes reported infrequently (e.g., in one study) and/or with minimal detail. No studies which met review criteria included statistical analyses of change processes (e.g., moderation, mediation, or regression analyses); thus, findings presented are derived from qualitative data and theorizing in the discussion sections of quantitative studies, which provide a basis for preliminary exploration about how music interventions may have facilitated parent\u2013child relationship changes."

For ease of reading, studies are referred to by number hereafter.\nQuality assessment No Randomized Controlled Trials (Level 1 evidence for effectiveness) met review criteria, and the only randomized experiment did not include baseline measures (9). Designs assessing effectiveness included eight quasi-experimental studies (Level 2)\u00a0and one concurrent cohort study (Level 3), although there was a higher proportion (50% of included studies) of case studies (n\u00a0=\u00a013; Level 4). Evidence for meaningfulness identified no Level 1 or Level 2 evidence, with single qualitative studies being the only design identified (n\u00a0=\u00a09, some of which were also case studies; Level 3). Qualitative designs were generally rated as higher quality than quantitative designs, with one case study (20) and two qualitative studies (22, 23)\u00a0 receiving a rating of Strong. The highest rating of a quantitative study was Medium\u2013Strong (8, the concurrent cohort study) and all other quantitative designs (e.g., quasi-experiments) were rated as Medium or Weak, meaning that no Level 1 or 2 evidence for effectiveness or meaningfulness was rated as Strong. Methodological weaknesses in quantitative designs included that only three studies used validated relationship outcome measures (1, 8, 9)\u00a0 only two studies included a control group receiving standard care (8, 9). The literature base was small (N\u00a0 =\u00a0 23 studies; 15 unique interventions). Considered together, these findings indicate that the quality of the body of evidence is relatively weak overall.\nPublication dates and country Publication dates were from 1992 to 2019 with only two studies published before 2000. Four interventions were conducted in Australia (5, 6, 13\u2013211), two in the United States (2, 9), two in England (7, 10), and one each in Scotland (4), Italy (8), and Belgium (12).

Approximately 809\u2013817 parent-child dyads participated and were included in the synthesis.3 The mean age of children could not be calculated due to unclear reporting of child age in some studies (4, 6, 11, 13\u201317). Children\u2019s age spanned antenatal and postpartum in two studies (4, 8). In three studies, participants were newborns 3\u00a0months and under (n\u00a0=\u00a0312; 2, 8, 9). Other participants were up to 2 years (n = 46\u201348; 1, 5, 12, 18\u201321), 3 years (n = approx. 231\u2013237; 4, 7, 10, 13\u201317) or 5 years old (n = 210, one intervention; 6). Participants were toddlers or older children aged 2\u20135 years old in three interventions (n = approx. 10; 3, 11, 22, 23).\nNine of the 15 interventions were open to any caregiver (1, 3\u20137, 10, 13\u201317, 22, 23), although only biological parents were reported as participants. Mothers were reported in six interventions (2, 8, 9, 11, 12, 18\u201321), including five with infants (2, 8, 9, 12, 18\u201321) and one with toddlers (11). Father involvement was reported in four studies (3, 4, 14, 22), including fathers participating in prenatal sessions (4) and in sessions with 3\u20135-year-old children (3, 22). One study involving children aged birth to 3\u00a0years old mentioned father participation, although none of the case studies presented involved fathers\u00a0(14).\nStudies recruited both vulnerable participants and those from the general population. Nine interventions involved participants who were vulnerable or at-risk for various reasons, including: parenting, bonding, interaction, and/or attachment difficulties (7, 13, 14, 16; Oldfield & Bunce, 2001); socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., low income; 2, 6, 11, 13, 14, 16, 22); single (11, 13\u201316) or young parents (6, 13\u201316); current and/or historical substance misuse (4, 13, 14)\u00a0 or maternal mental illness, including bipolar (3) or depression (12, 22, 23); parent and/or child trauma history (e.g., domestic violence; 13, 14, 16, 22, 23); child behavioral problems (7, 16; Oldfield & Bunce, 2001); young women in crisis (13\u201316); and/or being part of a cultural minority (e.g., Indigenous Australians, non-English speaking background; 13, 14, 16, 17). Six interventions involved participants from the general population in prevention studies (1, 5, 8\u201310, 18\u201321). Settings included medical or hospital (2, 8, 9, 12), community agency (5, 6, 13\u201317) or center (10), participant\u2019s homes (4, 18\u201322), a University-affiliated clinic (22, 23), a shared living facility (11), a children\u2019s unit (7), and two studies did not specify (1,\u00a03).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nOutcomes assessment Parental self-report was used to assess outcomes in most studies. Nine studies used parental selfreport questionnaires (1, 2, 6\u201310, 14, 15). Three studies used validated measures: the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS; 8), the Kessler 10 (6), and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (9). A\u00a0 fourth study used items from the Child Rearing Questionnaire and Parental Perceptions and Behaviors Scale (6). The remaining studies used interventionist- or researcherdesigned questionnaires to determine parent\u2013child relationship changes (2, 15), maternal relaxation (2), child behavior changes (7), satisfaction with the intervention (2, 6), effects of music improvisation (10), and music use at home (15), and qualitative parent comments about child behavior, parenting and parent\u2013 child relationship changes, and experiences of music and/or intervention were also collected via questionnaire (1, 2, 7, 10, 14). Other sources of parent feedback included written comments (17) informal discussions with parents (3\u20135, 9, 11, 13\u201315, 17), parent consultations (22, 23), parent journal or diary (18\u2013 23), and structured (8, 9)\u00a0 or semi-structured interviews with parents (10, 18\u201323).\nStructured quantitative observational analyses were used in five studies. Only two used validated measures: the Indicator of Parent\u2013 Child Interaction and Early Communication Indicator (1), and the Looking, Touching, Talking and Smiling (LoTTS) Parent\u2013Infant Interaction Coding Scale (9). Three studies used other observational analyses, including a microanalytic video analysis of intersubjective moments (12), an interventionist observation checklist (6), and a video coding scheme of parent and child behaviors (7). Qualitative observations such as therapist observations, notes and diaries (3, 4, 11, 14\u201316, 22, 23), and video review of sessions (10, 11, 22, 23)\u00a0were used to evaluate six interventions. No studies measured parent\u2013child attachment quality using self-report or observational measures.\nOf the 10 interventions evaluated using quantitative research designs, pre- and post-intervention data was collected in six (1, 6, 8, 12, 18\u201323) and post-intervention data only was collected in four (2, 7, 9, 10). Formal follow-up was included in only one study at 48\u00a0hours, and 1, 2, and 3\u00a0months after birth (8). Follow-up longer than 3\u00a0months was not reported in any study.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nOutcomes and main themes\u00a0 Parenting and parent\u2013child relationship findings. All studies reported parent\u2013child relationship improvements, including in attachment-related outcomes. Studies comparing intervention to control conditions found significantly greater observed maternal warmth and responsiveness at 6 weeks postpartum (9) and motherreported bonding (i.e., the process of developing a connection or bond between parent and child; Bowlby, 1969) at 3\u00a0 months postpartum (8). Significantly greater parental sensitivity (defined as \u201cawareness of the child\u2019s signals,\u201d 6, p.\u00a0 229), engagement, acceptance, and child responsiveness to their parent (6); occurrence, quality, and duration of intersubjectivity (i.e., reciprocal mother\u2013infant interactions, including shared attention and mutual responsiveness; 12); and parent facilitation and child engagement parent-child interaction (1) were observed from baseline to post-intervention in quasi-experimental designs. Additionally, parents reported reduced parenting irritability from baseline to post-intervention in one study (6). Case and qualitative studies found improved parent\u2013child interactions (1, 4, 5, 10, 13\u201317, 22, 23), child initiation of interactions with her mother (23), bonding (2, 9, 14, 18\u201323), maternal responsiveness and/or sensitivity (11, 15), parent-child attunement (2, 11, 18\u201323), intersubjectivity (11), parent-child co-regulation (including repair of negative emotions and/or mutual positive states; 5, 11, 22), and maternal representations of her child (7). Two studies reported improved father\u2013child relationship quality (3, 22). No studies measured attachment security as an outcome.\nEighteen studies were rated as Very Effective for supporting the parent\u2013child relationship. Five studies were rated as Somewhat Effective for the following reasons: not all aspects of parent\u2013child interactions improved (1); parental warmth did not improve (6); parenting difficulties (e.g., difficulties setting limits with the child) were not resolved (3); a mother repeatedly did not acknowledge her child\u2019s negative feelings (23); and only 53% of parents felt closer to their child (15).\nParental mental health and wellbeing findings. Findings suggested improved parental mental health outcomes due to music interventions, which theoretically could have contributed to improved parent\u2013child attachment quality (Schechter & Willheim, 2009). Nine interventions reported parental mental health and/\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nor wellbeing outcomes (2, 4\u20136, 8\u201310, 13, 15, 16, 18\u201321), with eight reporting improvements. One study found significantly lower perceived maternal stress on one of two measures at 1\u00a0 month postpartum for intervention compared to control group participants (8), while another study found significant improvements in self-reported parental mental health from pre- to post-intervention (6). Maternal self-report and interventionist observations suggested increased positive feelings (e.g., joy, pride, relief, calmness, relaxation; 2, 4, 5, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18\u201321) and reduced stress and anxiety symptoms due to intervention (18\u201321). Two studies reported no significant differences between intervention and control conditions on some or all parent outcomes (8,\u00a09).\nChildren\u2019s emotional and behavioral findings. Studies reported improved child outcomes due to music interventions, which theoretically could have occurred because of parent\u2013child relationship improvements and/or because improved child outcomes could have contributed to parent\u2013child relationship changes (Sroufe, 2005). Child outcomes were reported in 12 interventions (1\u20136, 8\u201310, 13\u201322), with 11 reporting improvements. One study found significantly less crying at 1\u00a0month, neonatal colic at 1 and 2\u00a0months, and overnight waking at 2\u00a0months postpartum (8), and another found significantly lower weekly mean crying time over 6 weeks (r\u00a0=\u00a00.7; 9), in intervention compared to control conditions. Parent report and therapist observations suggested that infants went to sleep and settled more quickly (13\u201315, 18\u201321), children were more relaxed, calmer and soothed, and less distressed and irritable (2, 4, 5, 10, 13\u201315, 18\u201322), children improved in social, communication, play, and other developmental outcomes (6, 13\u201317), and child behavioral problems, tantrums, and asthma attacks reduced (3). Three studies reported no significant changes on some or all child outcomes (1, 6,\u00a08).\nOther findings. Findings suggested high levels of enjoyment, satisfaction, engagement, and intervention use, which theoretically could have contributed to improved parent\u2013child relationship outcomes (Hackworth et\u00a0al., 2018). Parent participants reported self and child enjoyment (5, 10, 13\u201315, 20)\u00a0and high satisfaction with music interventions (2, 6). One study found significant increases in child engagement from pre- to post-intervention (1), and high parent and child engagement was observed during sessions in another study (7). Additionally, parents used music interventions\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\noutside of sessions (1, 8, 9, 15, 18\u201321, 23). One study found that mothers used contingent lullaby singing with their infants an average of four to five times daily (9). In the only study including follow-up measures, 88% of mothers reported that they still sang to their infant 2\u00a0months after birth (8). Mothers indicated still using music techniques 3\u00a0months post-intervention in one study (9) and reported intending to continue using the music techniques in two studies (2, 19)."

Most Somewhat Effective interventions involved children from birth to 5 years old and various caregivers (1, 3, 6, 15), although one of these studies involved a mother-toddler dyad (child aged 3-years-old; 23). All five interventions involving mother-infant dyads (infants aged up to 2-years-old) were rated as Very Effective (2, 8, 9, 12, 18\u201321). This suggests that music interventions with mother\u2013infant dyads may improve relationship outcomes more consistently than interventions with other populations.\nIntervention aims Focusing specifically on attachment did not appear to enhance relationship outcomes. Only five interventions aimed to strengthen attachment (4, 6, 9, 15, 23), three of which were rated as Somewhat Effective (6, 15, 23), while other interventions focused on different relationship aims. Interventions aiming exclusively to improve parent-child relationships and parenting appeared to lead to improved relationship quality more consistently than those with multiple aims, as all six studies focused on relationship and parenting aim/s only were rated as Very Effective (4, 7, 10\u201312, 22).

It is possible that some interventions with multiple aims were less targeted, which may have decreased their effectiveness for improving the parent\u2013child relationship; however, given that most studies with multiple aims were rated as Very Effective, it is likely that other factors contributed to some of these interventions being rated as Somewhat Effective.\nInterventionists Findings suggested that interventions delivered by music therapists, allied health professionals and mother-mediated music therapy interventions supported parent\u2013child relationship outcomes. Most interventions were delivered by music therapists (n =13), although allied health professionals delivered two interventions (8, 12)\u00a0and assisted with two of the 13 music therapy interventions (4, 7). Additionally, two music therapy interventions involved mother-mediated delivery (9, 18\u201321). All interventions involving allied health professionals (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and mother-mediated interventions (n\u00a0 =\u00a0 2) were rated as Very Effective. Nine studies of interventions delivered by music therapists were rated as Very Effective (2, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 22)\u00a0and five were rated as Somewhat Effective (1, 3, 6, 15, 23).\nMode of delivery Nine interventions were delivered to a group (1, 5\u20138, 10\u201317), while six were delivered to one or more individual families or dyads (2\u20134, 9, 18\u201323). Effectiveness of an intervention did not appear to be impacted by mode of delivery, as Somewhat Effective interventions included three group (1, 6, 15) and two interventions delivered to individual dyads (3, 23).\nNumber of sessions The number of sessions ranged from 1 to 14 (M\u00a0 =\u00a0 6.7). All single session interventions were rated as Very Effective (2, 9, 18\u201321) and Somewhat Effective interventions involved 4\u201310 sessions (1, 3, 6, 15, 23). These ratings suggest that brief music interventions may be equally or more effective for improving parent\u2013child relationships than longer interventions; however, all single session interventions focused on mother\u2013infant dyads and two were mother-mediated, making it unclear whether the single session format or other intervention features contributed to relationship outcomes.\nIntervention techniques All interventions involved singing (1\u201323) and most involved parent and/or child instrument playing (2\u20137, 10, 11, 13\u201317, 22, 23). Interventions focused on singing only appeared\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nto more consistently improve the parent\u2013child relationship than those involving instrument playing, as four out of five Somewhat Effective interventions involved instrument playing (3, 6, 15, 23). Most interventions designed for infants 2\u00a0years old and under focused on singing (1, 8, 9, 12, 18\u201321) and one involved instrument playing (2), indicating that use of instrument-based techniques with infants requires further investigation. Two interventions involved training mothers in singing techniques (9, 18\u201321) and six included a parent education component about parenting, parentchild interactions and/or music use (2, 4, 9, 18\u201323); all except one of these studies (23) were rated as Very Effective. Interventions without this type of parent training and/or education were rated as Very (5, 7, 8, 10\u201314, 16, 17)\u00a0or Somewhat Effective (1, 3, 6, 15); however, some of these interventions involved implicit parent training such as modeling (e.g., 6, 15). Thus, parent education or training was not required for an effective intervention, although it may have contributed to intervention effectiveness."

Lullaby singing was described as calming mothers and infants and supporting infants\u2019 sleep, which decreased mothers\u2019 stress and improved their confidence (18\u201321). In case- and interview-based studies, vocal interventions (e.g., singing, humming) accompanied with multimodal stimulation (e.g., rhythmic patting, rocking, stroking, walking, and/or swaying) were described as settling infants, decreasing infant distress, and/or inducing sleep, which sometimes led to positive feelings for mothers (4, 13\u201315, 19\u201321).\nAuthors of two quantitative studies postulated about processes which may have contributed to stronger relationship outcomes for dyads participating in a music intervention than a control condition (8, 9). The \u201cexpressiveness and intimacy\u201d (8, p.\u00a0e219) of lullaby singing may have contributed to significantly greater mother-reported bonding at 3\u00a0 months postpartum for lullaby singing intervention participants compared to a control group. Lullaby singing may have facilitated infant relaxation and made\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nit easier for mothers to calm their infants, as intervention participants also reported significantly lower frequency of crying episodes in the first month postpartum than control participants (8). Mothers participating in a contingent lullaby singing intervention reported significantly lower infant crying than mothers in a control condition, which may have contributed to significantly higher maternal responsiveness and warmth and better mother\u2013infant interactions for intervention than control participants, in addition to possibly improving maternal self-care, lowering maternal stress, and increasing maternal rest\u00a0(9).\nInferences about change processes were explored in studies using qualitative analysis of session videos (10, 11, 22, 23), therapist notes (11, 22, 23), and parent interviews (10, 22, 23). In two studies exploring one intervention, an author described that singing, songwriting, and music-assisted relaxation supported intimacy and connection; singing, songwriting, and instrument playing facilitated exploration through musical play; and singing, instrument playing, and musical games facilitated parent\u2013child affection with 3\u20135 year old children (22, 23). Three studies reported that music techniques (instrument playing and improvisation, improvised singing [sometimes with dancing], and musical games) facilitated parent\u2013child attunement with 2\u20135-year-old children (10, 11, 22). Instrumental improvisation was reported to facilitate mothers\u2019 observation of their child\u2019s responses (10-month-old infant, 10; child aged between 2 and 4\u00a0years old; 11)\u00a0and a mother following her 2\u00a0year old child\u2019s responses to music (10)."

            "text": "No studies included in the review measured attachment security as an outcome, meaning that clear conclusions about whether music interventions increase attachment security cannot be drawn. Nonetheless, all interventions showed at least some effectiveness for improving attachment-related outcomes, such as bonding, interaction quality, emotional co-regulation, and parental sensitivity (1\u201323). Music interventions were also associated with improved child emotional, developmental, and behavioral outcomes (2\u20136, 8\u201310, 13\u201322) and parental mental health and wellbeing (2, 4\u20136, 8, 10, 18\u201321). Findings suggest that music interventions have advantages such as participant enjoyment (5, 10, 13\u201315, 20)\u00a0and high parental satisfaction (2, 6), which could have enhanced engagement in intervention and thereby contributed to improved parent\u2013child relationship quality (Hackworth et\u00a0al., 2018).\nMusic interventions delivered antenatally or during early infancy were associated with positive relationship outcomes (2, 4, 8, 9, 18\u201321), including higher mother-reported bonding (8) and observed maternal warmth and sensitivity (9) in intervention than control conditions. Findings of a meta-analysis suggests that there are fewer effective interventions for supporting parent\u2013infant attachment for infants 6\u00a0months old and younger than for older infants (Bakermans-Kranenburg et\u00a0 al., 2003). Music interventions may address a gap in available interventions, as they have features which may make them suitable for use from birth, such as infants\u2019 inherent musicality and the musical qualities of mother\u2013infant interactions (Edwards, 2011; Malloch, 1999). Mother-mediated singing interventions may be especially suited, as they can be integrated into infants\u2019 everyday routines at home and could be brief and cost-effective (e.g.,\u00a09).\nMusic interventions also appeared to support parent\u2013child relationship outcomes (e.g., attunement; emotional closeness) and child exploration through musical play for 2 to 5 year old children (3, 7, 10, 11, 22, 23). These findings suggest that music interventions supported important aspects of parent\u2013child attachment during toddlerhood, including autonomy development through exploration and the child\u2019s emotional closeness to their parent (Lieberman, 1992). Additionally, two studies reported improved\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nfather\u2013child relationship quality with children aged 3\u20135\u00a0 years old (3, 22), suggesting that music interventions are suited to supporting both mother\u2013child and father\u2013child relationships with children this age."

            "text": "Inferences about change processes were based on interpreting findings of included studies from the perspective of attachment theory, in order to speculate about how music interventions could increase attachment security and guide future research to test these postulations. One study found greater maternal responsiveness (an aspect of sensitivity; Nicholls & Kirkland, 1996) in a lullaby singing intervention than a control group (9), and another reported improved parental sensitivity from pre- to post-intervention (6). Metaanalytic evidence indicates that interventions targeting maternal sensitivity increase parent\u2013child attachment security (BakermansKranenburg et\u00a0al., 2003), suggesting that improved parental sensitivity due to the music intervention may have enhanced attachment security.\nFindings suggest that music techniques may have facilitated parent\u2013child relationship improvements through intervening in Parental Reflective Functioning (PRF) in a similar way to psychological interventions not involving music. Lullaby singing (18\u201321) and instrumental improvisation (10, 11)\u00a0 were reported to facilitate maternal observation of their infant or young child\u2019s responses, which appeared to lead to sensitive maternal responses in at least one intervention (18\u201321). Some psychological interventions aiming to develop PRF encourage parents to observe their child\u2019s behavior and reflect on the internal experiences potentially underlying their child\u2019s behavior (Powell et\u00a0al., 2014; Slade, 2007), which is a similar process to what reportedly occurred through music techniques. Lullaby singing may be particularly suited to supporting PRF, as it is believed to direct maternal attention to observing their infant\u2019s responses and thereby encourages reflection on the infant\u2019s behavior (Trehub et\u00a0al., 1997), which is similar to what mothers described experiencing in a lullaby singing intervention (18\u201321).\nSinging techniques appeared to support mother\u2013infant co-regulation processes (5, 8, 9, 18\u201321), which also influence attachment security (Guo et\u00a0al., 2015; Schore, 2001; Tronick, 2007).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nLullaby singing interventions were reported to support infant (4, 13\u201315, 8, 9, 18\u201321) and maternal self-regulation (18\u201321), and mothers participating in lullaby singing interventions reportedly found it easier to soothe their infants than those in control conditions (8, 9). Listening to their mother\u2019s singing may have improved infants\u2019 self-regulation. Additionally, the act of singing may have improved mothers\u2019 ability to regulate their own emotions (Porges, 2011), which could have supported mothers to co-regulate their infants\u2019 emotions (Schore, 2001; Slade, 2007). Rhythmic qualities of music may have also supported physiological regulation, especially when paired with movement and/or multimodal stimulation (Perry, 2009); therefore, multimodal stimulation with singing could have enhanced the regulatory effects of music for infants (4, 13\u201315, 18\u201321). Infant responses to music interventions (e.g., decreased crying) also appeared to contribute to improved maternal mental health and wellbeing (4, 9, 13\u201315, 18\u201321), and authors of one study proposed that less infant crying in the intervention group may have improved mother\u2013infant interactions (9). These findings suggest that music intervention effects on the infant may lead to maternal and relationship improvements, although further research is needed to explore this possibility.\nFindings suggested that interventions delivered by music therapists, allied health professionals, and mother-mediated music therapy interventions supported parent\u2013child relationships. The mother-mediated interventions included in this review focused on singing with individual mother\u2013infant dyads (9, 18\u201321) and both interventions delivered by allied health professionals involved group singing with either mother\u2013infant dyads (12) or pregnant mothers (8). All interventions with mother\u2013infant dyads were rated as Very Effective and singing interventions were generally associated with positive outcomes. Thus, it is unclear whether interventionist characteristics, such as the training of allied health professionals or the potential of mothers using music techniques in-between sessions, contributed to parent\u2013child relationship outcomes. Future research could explore whether the interventionist impacts outcomes in comparable interventions. Additionally, interventions delivered by allied health professionals involved comparatively simple musical techniques (e.g., singing), suggesting that more complex techniques (e.g., songwriting) are within the scope of music therapists rather than\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nallied health professionals. Future research could explore which types of music techniques are suitable for a range of health professionals to implement, and which techniques are more suitable for music therapists to implement.\nClinical Implications\nSinging was used in all included interventions, suggesting that it is a central music technique used to support parent\u2013child attachment. Instrument playing also appeared to facilitate parent\u2013child relationship improvements; however, interventions including instrument playing appeared to improve relationship quality less consistently than those involving singing only. Findings suggest that interventionists could support parent\u2013child dyads to develop a more secure attachment by facilitating parental observation of their child\u2019s cues and supporting parents to respond sensitively to their child during music-making. Interventions with young infants and their parents could also focus on supporting emotional co-regulation using singing and multimodal stimulation. Music interventions were shown to be adaptable to various settings, flexible depending on the client\u2019s needs, and suitable for implementation by music therapists and allied health professionals. Findings suggest that music interventions could be used for both prevention and intervention. The acceptability of music interventions may make them especially suitable for dyads where engagement, attendance, or retention in interventions has been difficult."

Music therapy is a small discipline compared to some allied health professions; for example, there are currently 9,107 Board Certified Music Therapists in the United States and overseas (Certification Board for Music Therapists, 2020), while there were over 681,000 social workers employed in the United States in 2020 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021). Thus, allied health professionals could support the dissemination of music interventions more widely within the community. Additionally, allied health professionals with expertise in parent\u2013child attachment\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\n(e.g., psychologists) could collaborate with music therapists to design music interventions targeting attachment processes (e.g., parental sensitivity) and assist with evaluating intervention effects using observational measures of attachment (e.g., the Strange Situation Procedure; Ainsworth et\u00a0al., 1978; Main & Solomon, 1986). These contributions could support the development of attachmentspecific music interventions and strengthen the evidence base for music interventions aiming to improve parent\u2013child attachment.\nFuture studies evaluating music interventions aiming to support parent\u2013child attachment could employ more rigorous research designs (e.g., Randomized Controlled Trials) than studies included in the present review, in order to assess intervention effects and to compare music to other intervention types. Studies could evaluate interventions using validated parent\u2013child relationship outcome measures alongside measures aiming to capture other salient outcomes (e.g., emotional regulation) and use longitudinal follow-up to explore long-term effects, similar to Persico and colleagues (2017). Studies could also statistically analyze change processes (e.g., using mediation, moderation, and/or regression analyses) in order to better understand attachment-related change processes in music interventions.\nParticipant characteristics limit the generalizability of findings. Most participating caregivers were mothers, few fathers participated, and no studies involved other caregivers (e.g., adoptive parents) or father\u2013child dyads with children under 3\u00a0 years old. Most studies exploring change processes with infants involved participants not identified as vulnerable or at-risk (8, 9, 18\u201321). Additionally, Western participants were overrepresented, and no studies were published from non-Western countries. Thus, music intervention effects and change processes need to be evaluated with a more diverse range of participants, including parent\u2013child dyads with insecure attachment. Research is also needed to synthesize the existing evidence and design attachment interventions for children with additional needs, given that studies involving this population were excluded from this\u00a0review.\nLimitations of this review include using researcher-designed criteria to classify study quality and effectiveness, which involved some subjectivity in the rating process. Multiple authors were involved in the quality and effectiveness assessments and data synthesis process; however, potential biases were not controlled for by inter-rater reliability. Additionally, publication bias and/or selective reporting\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm t/article/59/4/430/7095549 by guest on 17 January 2024\nof results were not assessed in this review. A\u00a0future review could employ more rigorous methodology, including inter-rater reliability and assessing for publication bias (particularly if the review also includes gray literature), which may allow researchers to draw clearer conclusions about the effects of music interventions on parent\u2013 child attachment security. However, more research evaluating music interventions to support parent\u2013child attachment must be conducted before such a review is possible or warranted."

Findings suggest that music interventions improve attachment-related outcomes, such as bonding, emotional co-regulation, interaction quality, and parental sensitivity. Techniques such as singing, instrument playing, and movement or multimodal stimulation with music appear to support parent\u2013child relationship quality. Music interventions may facilitate parent\u2013child relationship changes through supporting psychological processes, such as parental sensitivity, reflective functioning, and emotional co-regulation. Findings suggest that participants perceived music interventions as acceptable, which may enhance participant engagement in interventions and could thereby improve parent\u2013child relationship outcomes. Music interventions aiming to improve attachment quality need to be designed and evaluated, as few included interventions focused on improving attachment quality and no studies included measures of parent\u2013child attachment quality. Additionally, the existing evidence base is relatively small and weak in quality, indicating that further research is required to determine whether music interventions impact attachment security and to elucidate processes through which relationship changes occur. These advances could allow clearer conclusions to be drawn about whether music interventions support attachment security and may enable interventionists to use music interventions to remediate parent\u2013child attachment difficulties more effectively."
