Introduction\nSince their development by Kumakhov (1990), polycapillary optics have been widely used in X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) to focus or parallelize X-ray beams (Kumakhov, 2000; MacDonald, 2010; Matsuda et al., 2008). With the use of two polycapillary optics \u2013 one between the X-ray source and the sample to focus the primary beam, and the other between sample and detector to limit the visible area of the detector \u2013 a confocal setup can be realized (Nakazawa & Tsuji, 2013a; Ingerle et al., 2020; Haschke, 2014), allowing for 3D imaging of samples from various fields of study [e.g. biology, geology, cultural heritage etc. (Fittschen & Falkenberg, 2011; S\u030cmit et al., 2004; Nakano et al., 2011; Nakazawa & Tsuji, 2013b; Sun et al., 2010, 2020; Kanngie\u00dfer et al., 2005)]. Quantitative interpretations of such measurements rely heavily on the transmission properties of the polycapillary optics used (Mantouvalou et al., 2012). Information about these properties from the manufacturer is often insufficient for an exact quantitative evaluation of confocal micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis (CMXRF) measurements.\nISSN 1600-5775\nPublished under a CC BY 4.0 licence\nIn this paper, as a step towards 3D elemental quantification with a CMXRF setup, the transmission properties of three polycapillary half lenses (PC-50, PC-236, PC-246) were established, with experiments carried out in the laboratory and at a synchrotron source. Two of the investigated lenses (PC-236, PC-246) are used in the confocal laboratory setup reported by Ingerle et al. (2020). The results are compared with data given by the manufacturer and simulated values established with the software polycap (Tack et al., 2020).\nIn addition to previously reported similar investigations of polycapillary lenses (Matsuda et al., 2008; Wolff et al., 2009; Haschke & Haller, 2003), we present newly developed analytical models for the estimation of the global divergence and the transmission ratio of the polycapillary optics."

The count rate in channel 500 (right) is sufficient for a channel-wise evaluation, whereas channels in the low-energy regime, such as channel 100 (left), do not measure a statistically relevant signal, making the result of the fit arbitrary to some degree. Sensible results in reasonable measurement times can be found for energies between 6.2 keV and 18.0 keV.

As can be seen in the images, the use of the screen and camera available at the synchrotron allows for a much more detailed investigation of the 2D intensity distribution of the beam than knife-edge scans, considering only two axes and neglecting the orientation of the capillary with respect to rotation around the beam axis. As expected, a smaller spot size for higher energies is observed (see Fig. 8). The energy dependence of the out-of-focus spot size is shown in Fig. 11. In order to better establish the form of the beam intensity distribution, a 3D model of the beam was created with ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012) (see Fig. 12).\nWhile the intensity distribution of the beam is not strictly a multivariate normal intensity distribution (see Fig. 12, left), smoothing the measured data with the Interactive 3D Surface Plot function of ImageJ shows a near multivariate normal distribution (see Fig. 12, right). Thus, centre and standard deviation of a 2D normal distribution were established by an algorithm calculating the moments of the data and optimizing the established initial guesses for the parameters of the distribution (SciPy, 2022; Virtanen et al., 2020). Such a fit is shown in Fig. 13.\nThe calculated parameters can be used to determine the global divergence of the polycapillary optic, i.e. the beam shape far outside the focal distance, which is additionally dependent on the curvature of the optic [see d in Fig. 14 and equations (2) and (3)] compared with the local divergence close to the focal distance predominantly dependent on the critical angle and therefore the beam energy [see dLB in Fig. 5 and equation (1) (MacDonald, 2010)].\nThe energy-dependent divergence far outside the focal distance d(E), measured as the FWHM of the spot, can be written as (see Fig. 14)\nd\u00f0E\u00de \u00bc 2 \u00f0 f \u00fe a\u00de tan 0\u00f0E\u00de \u00fe C\u00f0E\u00de\nRExit\u00f0E\u00de\na\n; \u00f02\u00de\nJ.

In the low-energy regime, the average number of reflections of an X-ray inside the capillary \u2013 in our case approximately 40 \u2013 reduces the number of transmitted photons (see Fig. 6). In the high-energy regime, the number of transmitted rays is reduced due to a higher number of rays hitting the surface in the outer capillaries under an angle larger than the critical angle (see Fig. 16) (Haschke, 2014).\n1380 Michael Iro et al.

Alternatively we present, to our knowledge, the first in-depth analytical model for an estimate of the transmission function, not based on the high computational effort of tracing single rays through the optic\n(Tack et al., 2020; Chi, 2020).

With this the total transmission function T(E) shows its typical shape (see Fig. 17).\nResults for the transmission were established using the 2D Gauss fits of the measurements at the synchrotron (see Fig. 13). Such measurements were conducted for different energies between 6 keV and 20 keV. The respective intensities (i.e. the volume under the established multivariate normal distribution) were normalized to pinhole measurements for each energy (i.e. the volume under the established cylinder, using a pinhole with 250 mm diameter). This results in relative values for the transmission.\nThese values (red) are compared with simulated results using the polycap code (blue) and the analytical model presented in this paper (orange). The measured values are scaled accordingly to illustrate the trend of the energy dependence.\nThe measured values for the transmission are in good agreement with values taken from a Monte Carlo simulation with polycap code, as well as values generated with the analytical model presented."

While this generally good agreement can be seen as the comparable trend of the empirical and estimated values in Fig. 7, it is also clearly visible that the absolute deviations for single energies from the manufacturer data and the geometric estimations make an exact investigation necessary for quantitative CMXRF measurements. To illustrate this Table 2 shows the values for three different energies read from Fig. 7.\nAlthough the trend of all curves shows a similar behaviour and deviations of up to 20% between manufacturer values and can generally be considered small, a wrong estimation can have a significant influence on quantitative interpretations of CMXRF measurements. Furthermore, the deviations can be even larger for energies on the border of the energy interval given by the manufacturer; for example, a spot size of 25 mm for 7.5 keV may be given compared with approximately 30 mm (vertically) 35 mm (horizontally) leading to a mis-estimation of the spot size of up to 30%.\nSpot sizes in distances much larger than the focal distance were measured using the synchrotron setup and compared with Monte Carlo simulated data using the polycap code.\nJ.

Again, all measured, calculated and simulated results show the same energy trend (see Fig. 17). All transmission results are relative to each other, leaving a linear scaling factor for the curves.\nThis characterization of the capillary optics is an important step towards the quantitative interpretation of measurements with the monochromatic CMXRF setup, presented by Ingerle et al. (2020), applicable in the laboratory and at the synchrotron.\nThe good agreement of the measured data and values calculated with the polycap code supports the applicability of this software for the development of a new voxel-based Monte Carlo ray-tracing code for the quantitative interpretation of CMXRF, which will be presented in a future publication."
