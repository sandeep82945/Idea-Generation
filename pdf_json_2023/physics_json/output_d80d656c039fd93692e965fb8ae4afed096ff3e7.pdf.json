    "abstractText": "Diazomethane (CH2N2) presents a notable hazard as a respiratory irritant, resulting in various adverse effects upon exposure. Consequently, there has been increasing concern in the field of environmental research to develop a sensor material that exhibits heightened sensitivity and conductivity for the detection and adsorption of this gas. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the geometric structure of three systems: CH2N2@MgO (C1), CH2N2@YMgO (CY1), and CH2N2@ZrMgO (CZ1), in addition to pristine MgO nanocages. The investigation involves a theoretical analysis employing the DFT/ uB97XD method at the GenECP/6-311++G(d,p)/SDD level of theory. Notably, the examination of bond lengths within the MgO cage yielded specific values, including Mg15\u2013O4 (1.896 \u00c5), Mg19\u2013O4 (1.952 \u00c5), and Mg23\u2013O4 (1.952 \u00c5), thereby offering valuable insights into the structural properties and interactions with CH2N2 gas. Intriguingly, after the interaction, bond length variations were observed, with CH2N2@MgO exhibiting shorter bonds and CH2N2@YMgO showcasing longer bonds. Meanwhile, CH2N2@ZrMgO displayed shorter bonds, except for a longer bond in Mg19\u2013O4, suggesting increased stability due to shorter bond distances. The study further investigated the electronic properties, revealing changes in the energy gap that influenced electrical conductivity and sensitivity. The energy gap increased for Zr@MgO, CH2N2@MgO, CH2N2@YMgO, and CH2N2@ZrMgO, indicating weak interactions on the MgO surface. Conversely, Y@MgO showed a decrease in energy, suggesting a strong interaction. The pure MgO surface exhibited the ability to donate and accept electrons, resulting in an energy gap of 4.799 eV. Surfaces decorated with yttrium and zirconium exhibited decreased energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), as well as decreased energy gap, indicating increased conductivity and sensitivity. Notably, Zr@MgO had the highest energy gap before CH2N2 adsorption, but C1 exhibited a significantly higher energy gap after adsorption, implying increased conductivity and sensitivity. The study also examined the density of states, demonstrating significant variations in the electronic properties of MgO and its decorated surfaces due to CH2N2 adsorption. Moreover, various analysis techniques were employed, including natural bond orbital (NBO), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and noncovalent interaction (NCI) analysis, which provided insights into bonding, charge density, and intermolecular interactions. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the sensing mechanisms of CH2N2 gas on nanocage surfaces, shedding light on adsorption energy, conductivity, and recovery time. These results hold significance for gas-sensing applications and provide a basis for further exploration and development in this field.",

Amodu,ac Ernest E. Ekereke,ac Innocent Benjamin,a Stephen A. Adalikwua and Adedapo Adeyinkae\nDiazomethane (CH2N2) presents a notable hazard as a respiratory irritant, resulting in various adverse effects upon exposure. Consequently, there has been increasing concern in the field of environmental research to\ndevelop a sensor material that exhibits heightened sensitivity and conductivity for the detection and\nadsorption of this gas. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the geometric\nstructure of three systems: CH2N2@MgO (C1), CH2N2@YMgO (CY1), and CH2N2@ZrMgO (CZ1), in addition to pristine MgO nanocages. The investigation involves a theoretical analysis employing the DFT/\nuB97XD method at the GenECP/6-311++G(d,p)/SDD level of theory. Notably, the examination of bond\nlengths within the MgO cage yielded specific values, including Mg15\u2013O4 (1.896 \u00c5), Mg19\u2013O4 (1.952 \u00c5),\nand Mg23\u2013O4 (1.952 \u00c5), thereby offering valuable insights into the structural properties and interactions\nwith CH2N2 gas. Intriguingly, after the interaction, bond length variations were observed, with CH2N2@MgO exhibiting shorter bonds and CH2N2@YMgO showcasing longer bonds. Meanwhile, CH2N2@ZrMgO displayed shorter bonds, except for a longer bond in Mg19\u2013O4, suggesting increased stability due to shorter bond distances. The study further investigated the electronic properties, revealing\nchanges in the energy gap that influenced electrical conductivity and sensitivity. The energy gap\nincreased for Zr@MgO, CH2N2@MgO, CH2N2@YMgO, and CH2N2@ZrMgO, indicating weak interactions on the MgO surface. Conversely, Y@MgO showed a decrease in energy, suggesting a strong interaction.\nThe pure MgO surface exhibited the ability to donate and accept electrons, resulting in an energy gap of\n4.799 eV. Surfaces decorated with yttrium and zirconium exhibited decreased energies of the highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), as well as\ndecreased energy gap, indicating increased conductivity and sensitivity. Notably, Zr@MgO had the\nhighest energy gap before CH2N2 adsorption, but C1 exhibited a significantly higher energy gap after adsorption, implying increased conductivity and sensitivity. The study also examined the density of states,\ndemonstrating significant variations in the electronic properties of MgO and its decorated surfaces due\nto CH2N2 adsorption. Moreover, various analysis techniques were employed, including natural bond orbital (NBO), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and noncovalent interaction (NCI)\nanalysis, which provided insights into bonding, charge density, and intermolecular interactions. The\nfindings contribute to a deeper understanding of the sensing mechanisms of CH2N2 gas on nanocage surfaces, shedding light on adsorption energy, conductivity, and recovery time. These results hold\nsignificance for gas-sensing applications and provide a basis for further exploration and development in\nthis field.\narch Group, University of Calabar, ail.com Faculty of Physical Sciences, University\nysical Sciences, University of Calabar,\nUniversity of Wukari, Wukari, Taraba\neDepartment of Chemical Sciences, University of Johannesburg, South Africa fCentre for Herbal Pharmacology and Environmental Sustainability, Chettinad Hospital and Research Institute, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Kelambakkam-603103, Tamil Nadu, India \u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

Various efforts have been made to evaluate and gain insights into the properties of fullerene and fullerenelike cages.12 Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) nanomaterials have been given full attention due to different chemical agents.13 One of the most commonly and widely used two-dimensional nanostructures in the area of electronic sensors is graphene.14 Unfortunately, weak interaction has been observed and reported in pure graphene. Consequently, it is not suitable to be applied as a chemical sensor.15 Metal oxides, as inorganic nanomaterials, have drawn considerable attention due to their promising and unique physical and chemical properties.16 Fullerene-like cages such as MgO, CaO, and aluminum nitrides (AlNs) are of great use as a result of the closed electronic shells of the nanoclusters. The great stability and essential roles of the named nanomaterials in the development of procient sensor devices.17 Due to their unique physical and chemical properties, low electron affinity, and large band gap, AlNs have made waves in this area of research.18 Ionic insulator nanostructures such as magnesium oxide (MgO), with a wide band gap and a variety of applications in catalysis, energy storage, sensors and ceramics, are used in this present study.19 Numerous approaches, such as functionalization by endohedral and exohedral encapsulation, have been suggested to tackle the problems arising from weak interactions and to enhance the electronic properties.20 Mohsen Doust et al. reported in their theoretical investigation of X12O12 (X = Be, Mg\n25392 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 25391\u201325407\nand Ca) in sensing CH2N2 (DFT study) that the energy calculations show a strong size-dependent adsorption, indicating that nanocages containing large atoms have the tendency to attract CH2N2 more strongly, hence showing effective binding. Significant changes to HOMO and LUMO energies have resulted from this adsorption.21 Also, in a DFT study to gain insight into the use of silicon carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs) in the catalytic decomposition of toxic diazomethane (DAZM) gas, Mohammad Solimannejad et al. reported that the DAZM molecule decomposed over the surface of (6,0) SiCNT with the activation energy of 0.523 eV. It was also concluded that adsorption over smaller diameters of SiCNT is thermodynamically more favorable than over larger diameters.22 Hitler Louis and team reported that the adsorption of phosgene gas follows an increasing pattern of adsorption energy: AlN < MgO < CaO, showing that CaO surface has the greatest negative adsorption energy of \u22124.79372 eV and \u22125.27066 eV using both levels of theory (PBE0 and uB97XD), respectively. This is followed by MgO surface, with adsorption energy values of \u22121.2105 eV and \u22121.3279 eV for PBE0 and uB97XD, respectively.23 In the adsorption of some small gas molecules such as N2O, NO2, NO, H2S, SO2, and SO3 on Mg12O12, Be12O12 and Ca12O12 surfaces, the adsorption was observed to follow an increasing trend of Ca12O12 > Mg12O12 > Be12O12, showing that these gases are fairly adsorbed on the Mg12O12 nanocage.24\nIn this present study, investigation was carried out on the adsorption of diazomethane (CH2N2) on pure magnesium oxide (MgO) and X-decorated (X = Y and Zr) magnesium oxide (MgO) surfaces. This study aimed at designing a potential nanosensor material for the efficient adsorption of diazomethane gas molecule in the atmosphere. Density functional theory (DFT) was employed throughout this study to carry out various geometric optimizations, calculations, and theoretical evaluations. All computational works have been accomplished within the framework of the uB97XD range-separated DFT functional, assigning the Gen/SDD/6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Investigations on the nature of interactions, inter- and intramolecular interactions, and sensor mechanisms have been achieved by the computational parameters hailing from the frontier molecular orbital (FMO), HOMO\u2013LUMO analysis and natural bond orbitals (NBO). Study of weak interactions was accomplished using the RDG and quantum theory of atoms in molecule (QTAIM) analysis. Topological electron localization function (ELF) was employed to study the chemical bonding features between the pure MgO and its decorated surface with the adsorbate (CH2N2) gas."

Additionally, the use of GenECP allows for efficient modeling of heavy atoms by replacing the inner-core electrons with effective core potentials, reducing computational complexity. The advantages of this theoretical algorithm over other algorithms lie in its accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability. The combination of DFT with the uB97Xd functional and appropriate basis sets provides accurate predictions of molecular properties. The GenECP method further enhances computational efficiency by reducing the computational burden associated with heavy atoms. Overall, this approach strikes a balance between accuracy and computational cost, making it versatile for studying various molecular systems and phenomena and offering valuable insights into their electronic structures and properties.

The geometry and structural parameters were optimized using the DFT/uB97XD functional at the GenECP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory, enabling the determination of minimum energies and congurations as well as the assessment of structural changes upon CH2N2 gas interaction. Fig. 1 provides a visual representation of the MgO cage, accompanied by a density of states plot that reveals a band gap value of 4.799 eV. Furthermore, Table 1 presents the calculated bond lengths for the MgO cage.

A change in the energy gap can bring about a change in the electrical conductivity, hence bringing a rise in sensitivity, and an observable change in the energy gap as was noticed aer decoration, which indicates an increase in the adsorption strength of Y@MgO, Zr@MgO, CH2N2@MgO, CH2N2@YMgO, and CH2N2@ZrMgO interactions, respectively.

Table 2 shows the aforementioned computed and calculated topological parameters, and Fig. 4 shows the pictorial view of the analysis of atoms in molecules. It can be observed from Table 2 that electron density values are all less than one (ranging from 0.128 to 0.677), indicating the accumulation of electron density between two atoms that are bonded.41 Classication into partially covalent, noncovalent, and strongly covalent was achieved using the V2r(r) and H(r) simultaneously. This follows that: V2r(r) > 0 andH(r) < 0;V2r(r) > 0 and H(r) > 0; and V2r(r) < 0 and H(r) < 0 denoting partially covalent, noncovalent, and strongly covalent, respectively. The partial covalent bond observed in all complexes is due to the resulting condition (H(r) < 0; V2r(r) > 0). For example, in CH2N2@MgO, the V2r(r) and H(r) values of 0.128 and \u22120.440 indicate partial covalence. Similarly, in CH2N2@YMgO (V\n2r(r)= 0.422 andH(r)= \u22120.372) and CH2N2@ZrMgO (V2r(r) = 0.677 and H(r) = \u22120.391) indicate partial covalence. Also, the nature of intermolecular interactions of the studied systems can be accounted for using the l1/l3 values. The l1/l3 was observed to be less than one in the case of CH2N2@YMgO and CH2N2@ZrMgO, depicting the presence of strong intermolecular interactions.42 Insights into the regions of charge density accumulation and bond stability were gained via the ellipticity of electron density (3).43 Lower ellipticity oen signies greater stability, and vice versa.44 From Table 2, the lower 3 values of 0.023 a.u., 0.015 a.u., and (0.109, 0.037 a.u.) for CH2N2@MgO, CH2N2@YMgO, and CH2N2@ZrMgO, respectively,\n25396 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 25391\u201325407\nimply the stability of the following bonds: N25\u2013Mg20, O4\u2013Y25, N26\u2013 Zr25, and N27\u2013Mg19.

The HOMO, LUMO, and the corresponding energy gap of the studied systems are presented in Table 3, and the pictorial view of the charge distribution within the studied systems is presented in Fig. 5 for better understanding of their electronic distribution.

Also, zirconium-decorated MgO (Zr@MgO) was observed to have a decreased HOMO value of \u22125.036 eV, with a corresponding LUMO value of \u22120.154 eV, giving rise to an energy gap of 4.882 eV. It can be seen that before adsorption of diazomethane (CH2N2), which is an extremely sensitive explosive yellow gas, Zr@MgO was observed to have the higher energy gap, which makes it more stable compared to the studied surface. Upon adsorption of the CH2N2 gas on the studied surface, C1 was observed to have a much higher energy gap of 8.299 eV, compared to the decorated surfaces CY1 and CZ1, with the energy gaps of 5.388 and 5.472, respectively. The drastic decrease in the energy gap of the decorated surface implies that decoration of the MgO nanocage increased the conductivity and sensitivity of the pure surface. This is in agreement with previously reported works that the doping and decoration of pure surfaces increases the conductivity and sensitivity of the studied systems.50 From Fig. 5, it can be observed that before adsorption of CH2N2 gas, the LUMOwas highly delocalized at the decorated metals, while the HOMO was evenly distributed on both the surface and the adsorbate. It can be seen that the HOMO is highly distributed at the nanocage. Aer interaction of the surface with CH2N2, C1 was observed to have its HOMO highly distributed at the adsorbate, while the LUMO is on the nanocage. CY1 was observed to have its HOMO distributed through the decorated metal and the adsorbate, while the LUMO is highly distributed on the nanocage and the decorated metal. This was similarly observed on the CZ1 complex. In order to fully understand the behavior of diazomethane based on the electronic properties of the modelled systems, the global quantum descriptors were calculated by employing the popular Koopmans approximation.51 The quantum descriptors presented in Table 3 were calculated using equations presented in the literature.52 The famous Koopmans approximation53 was used to further understand and assess the sensitivity and conductivity of the examined sensor material in terms of chemical hardness (h), described as the resistance of atoms or atom groups to charge transfer;54 electronegativity (c), the tendency of an atom or atom group to attract electrons;55 chemical potential (m) or electronic potential, the measure of an atom or group of atoms' likelihood of escaping its ground/non-excited state;56 electrophilicity index (u), a measure of the electron acceptor affinity to gain an additional electronic charge from the surrounding systems;57 and chemical soness (s), which accurately depicts an atom's proclivity to accept electrons/electrons.58 As a result, these\ncharacteristics provide additional light on the reactivity, stability, and intermolecular interactions of chemical systems, as well as the electric and optical properties of the same systems, which were approximated using Koopmans' approximation and conceptual density theory. These characteristics, as shown in Table 3, were found to be in excellent agreement with other researched objectives and provide additional insight into the changes in the electrical properties of the studied system before and aer adsorption."

It was used in this study to obtain more information about the electronic charge transfer, conductivity, and sensitivity of the pure MgO nanocage and its decorated surface towards the adsorption of CH2N2 gas.

The values obtained showed the interaction of CH2N2@YMgO (CY1) to be closer to zero, while its counterparts are close to unity. To further analyze the chemical bonding concept and to support the QTAIM analysis, topological analysis of the electron localization function ELF was employed in this study. ELF is reported to be the local measure of the effect of Pauli repulsion on the kinetic energy density. Weaker repulsion in the region of space is observed to have an ELF closer to one; hence, as previously reported in Table 2, C1 and CZI were observed to have weaker repulsion. However, CY1 had parallel pairing, since the ELF value was observed to be closer to zero. Different maps of the electron localization function, as presented in Fig. 7, were calculated with the help of MultiWfn as previously reported in the computational details. In Fig. 7, the dark-blue region is an indication of a decrease in the electron delocalization function. This implies that electrons tend to be localized in the outer side of the region. As we can see from the pictorial view of the HOMO\u2013LUMO analysis, for C1, the electron exhibits a localization domain at the adsorbate; for the decorated surface CY1, there was an ionic bond formation that exhibits a localization domain between Y23\u2013N25, and the localized region extends towards Y23 due to the charge transfer from the surface to the absorbate CH2N2. Similarly, for CZ1 complex, the electron delocalization function was mostly localized at Zr25\u2013N25 and Mg10\u2013N27. As a result, the HOMO\u2013 LUMO analysis, QTAIM, and ELF all indicate the same pattern. Thus, ELF topological analysis offers a thorough tool for evaluating the electrophilic substitution site and, more broadly, for localizing reactive sites in clusters. This also gives qualitative visual information via the graphical depiction of the regions of localization. The ELF descriptive approach augments the reactive sites of the cluster afforded by the molecules' frontier orbitals."

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nComputational imaging of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions inside and between the complexed molecules showed numerous remarkable zones enabled by the isosurfaces, including van der Waals contacts, steric repulsion, and strong attractive interactions. From the NCI analysis, the green isosurfaces show weak interactions caused by van der Waals dispersion forces, which are used to explain charge uctuation, resulting in a nonspecic and nondirectional attraction. The red isosurfaces, on the other hand, show strong interactions caused mostly by steric repulsion, but they also impact the conformation and reactivity of ions and molecules. The isosurfaces are depicted with colors ranging from blue to red depending on the values of l2. Hydrogen bonding is represented by deep blue color, while red indicates repulsive forces. According to literature review, small changes in the electronic density result in a large change in the reduced density gradient value, and the interaction in NCI is characterized by the Laplacian of the electron density (Vr(r)), along with three principal axes with three eigenvalues I of the Hessian matrix and the Laplacian, and is expressed in eqn (15).\n(Vr(r)) = l1 + l2 + l3, (15)\nFrom eqn (15), much information about the type of bond formation is examined by l2 in such a way that if l2 has negative values, the contact is considered hydrogen bonding, whereas positive values of l2 represent repulsive force. From the result of the QTAIM analysis, C1 had \u22120.245 a.u., CY1 had \u22120.101 a.u., and CZ1 had \u22120.200 a.u. and \u22120.516 a.u., respectively, indicating that all the studied systems had strong interaction between the surface and the adsorbate. For better understanding, Fig. 8 presents the NCI 2D-RGD graph. From the plot, a wide blue peak was observed from the C1 complex, conrming the higher positive values of the adsorption energy, which is an indication of the physically adsorbed system. On the other hand, the two decorated complexes were observed to have higher spike peaks spread around the decorated atoms. The appearance of the green isosurface in the 3D plot of the CY1 complex reveals intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, among the three complexes, the depth of the blue color bonded by the RDG isosurfaces and the accompanying spike peaks are very similar, indicating strong attraction between the modelled nanosurfaces and the interacted gas (CH2N2), as the spike peaks are approximately ranged from 0.00 to 1.40 a.u., respectively."

These insights shed light on the structural properties and interactions with CH2N2 gas. Post-interaction, CH2N2@MgO exhibited shorter bond lengths; CH2N2@YMgO had longer bond lengths; and CH2N2@ZrMgO showed shorter bond lengths except for Mg19\u2013 O4. CH2N2@ZrMgO achieved greater stability due to a shorter bond distance. Electronic properties were investigated, revealing changes in the energy gap, which inuenced electrical conductivity and sensitivity. The energy gap increased for Zr@MgO, CH2N2@MgO, CH2N2@YMgO, and CH2N2@ZrMgO, indicating stable interactions on the MgO surface. Y@MgO exhibited a decreased energy value, suggesting an increased conductivity and reactivity. The pure MgO surface donated and accepted electrons, resulting in an energy gap of 4.799 eV. Decoration with yttrium and zirconium decreased the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), as well as the energy gap, indicating increased conductivity and sensitivity. Zr@MgO had the highest energy gap before CH2N2 adsorption, but aer adsorption, C1 exhibited a signicantly higher energy gap, indicating increased conductivity and sensitivity. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) revealed partial covalent bonding in all complexes. Intermolecular interactions were indicated by l1/l3 values, with CH2N2@YMgO and CH2N2@ZrMgO showing strong interactions. Delocalization of the LUMO and distribution of the HOMO were observed before and aer CH2N2 adsorption, consistent with previous studies on enhanced conductivity and sensitivity through surface decoration. Regarding adsorption energy, CH2N2@YMgO (CY1) showed an energy of \u22124.817 eV, while CH2N2@ZrMgO (CZ1) had an even more negative value of \u22127.422 eV, indicating chemisorption with negative enthalpy. In contrast, CH2N2@MgO (C1) had a positive adsorption energy of 12.52 eV, suggesting physisorption. CZ1 exhibited the highest negative adsorption energy of \u22127.422 eV, indicating superior adsorption performance. Adsorption energy was correlated with recovery time, with higher energy leading to longer recovery times. CZ1, with the most negative energy of \u22127.422 eV, had the longest recovery time. This study provides insights into CH2N2 gas sensing mechanisms on nanocage surfaces, including adsorption energy, conductivity changes, and recovery times, with implications for gas-sensing applications."
