    "abstractText": "Increased dental biofilm commonly occurs during orthodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a combined toothbrushing method on dental biofilm cariogenicity in patients with stainless steel (SSL) and elastomeric (EL) ligatures. At baseline (T1), 70 participants were randomized (1:1 ratio) to the SSL or EL group. Dental biofilm maturity was evaluated using a three-color-disclosing dye. The participants were instructed to brush their teeth using a combined horizontal\u2013Charters\u2013modified Bass technique. Dental biofilm maturity was reassessed at the 4-week follow-up (T2). We found that at T1, new dental biofilm was the highest, followed by mature and cariogenic dental biofilm in the SSL group (p < 0.05). In the EL group, cariogenic dental biofilm was highly observed, followed by mature and new dental biofilm (p < 0.05). After intervention, cariogenic dental biofilm significantly decreased in both groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, a marked decrease in cariogenic dental biofilm was observed in the EL group compared with the SSL group (p < 0.05). However, the change in mature dental biofilm in the groups was similar (p > 0.05). Our results demonstrated that the combined toothbrushing method reduced cariogenic dental biofilm in the SSL and EL groups.",

            "text": "Biofilms are defined as matrix-embedded microbial populations adherent to each other and/or to surfaces. Dental biofilm or dental plaque is a specific type of biofilm in which a diverse community of oral bacteria is found on the tooth surface as a biofilm [1]. In orthodontic treatment, placing fixed appliances consisting of metals and polymers creates surfaces that differ from those of the natural oral hard and soft surfaces. This creates retention areas in which it is difficult to perform mechanical plaque control [2]. In addition, fixed appliance features increase the amount of dental biofilm and cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli) [3,4]. The accumulation of dental biofilm around the brackets is also influenced by the archwire ligation material [5]. Stainless steel ligature (SSL) [6] and elastomeric ligature (EL) [7] are the most commonly used materials to secure the archwire to the bracket slots. SSL demonstrates less dental biofilm retention compared with EL [8,9]. Higher levels of acidogenic bacteria are detected with EL, most noticeably S. mutans and Lactobacilli [9,10]. In contrast, other studies found that the two orthodontic ligatures did not cause alterations in the number of S. mutans [11,12] and Lactobacilli [12] in dental biofilm around orthodontic brackets.\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 731. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11050731 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 731 2 of 14\nPatients with fixed orthodontic appliances have difficulty achieving good oral hygiene because the appliances can be a barrier to mechanical cleaning. Food is commonly trapped around the brackets and under the archwires after eating. Moreover, the patients\u2019 lengthy treatment increases the risk of dental caries formation. Therefore, orthodontic patients require enhanced personal oral hygiene programs and regular professional prophylaxis [3,13]. The most effective and frequently used method for dental biofilm control is oral hygiene, consisting of toothbrushing complemented by using dental floss and other supporting dental care. However, in patients with fixed appliances, the procedures become more complex due to the difficulty caused by the appliances. Therefore, conventional toothbrushing techniques need to be modified to determine the best method for orthodontic patients. Currently, there is insufficient evidence concerning the most effective toothbrushing method for orthodontic patients. Randomized clinical trials that follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines are required to provide adequatequality evidence of the relative effectiveness of manual toothbrushing techniques [14]. The modified Bass technique is the most commonly recommended technique for controlling dental biofilm [15]. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of toothbrushing on dental biofilm in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. The horizontal technique, in combination with the Charters brushing techniques, is recommended to clean the bracket sites, whereas the Bass technique is used to remove dental biofilm at gingival sites [16]. Moreover, the scrubbing technique was found to be more effective than the modified Stillman technique, followed by the Bass technique in reducing dental biofilm in orthodontic patients [17]. Little is known about the effectiveness of manual toothbrushing on dental biofilm\u2019s cariogenicity in orthodontic patients. A previous study demonstrated that the modified Bass brushing technique significantly reduced the prevalence of S. mutans in the dental biofilm of patients undergoing orthodontic fixed appliances after a 4\u201312 month follow-up, compared with that of habitual toothbrushing [18]. Powered-toothbrushing combined with antibacterial regimens yielded lower biofilm viability than manual brushing in patients with stainless steel retention wires [19]. Most orthodontic trials used the original Silness and Loe plaque index, which does not demonstrate the dental biofilm\u2019s cariogenicity [20]. A three-color disclosing dye (GC TriPlaque ID GelTM, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) has been developed to determine dental biofilm maturity. The three-tone staining color relies on the pH selective response of different dyes, which are rose Bengal (red pigments) and brilliant blue (blue pigments), included in sucrose-containing disclosing liquid, to intraorally reveal the dental biofilm\u2019s age and acid production. The disclosing dye shows newly formed dental biofilm aged less than 1 day old as pink due to the red dye staining on the surface. Older or mature dental biofilms are seen as blue/purple because the blue dye is trapped within the thick dental biofilms that reflect inefficient toothbrushing. Light blue staining indicates areas of cariogenic dental biofilm due to the fermentation of sucrose in the dye resulting in acid production (pH < 4.5) [21]. We previously reported that when using a three-color disclosing gel, high cariogenic dental biofilm was commonly observed in orthodontic patients [22]. Currently, there is no report on the effect of the toothbrushing method on cariogenic dental biofilm removal in orthodontic patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a combined toothbrushing technique on reducing the cariogenic dental biofilm in orthodontic patients treated with SSL and EL ligatures."

In addition to brushing, 74.29% of the SSL group used dental floss, compared with 82.86% in the EL group. We found that 71.43% of patients with SSLs used interdental brushes, while this rate was 82.86% for the patients with ELs. Our results indicated that 57.14% of the SSL group and 74.29% of the EL group used mouthwash. Furthermore, 8.58% of the SSL group used other oral care products compared with 20% for the EL group. The frequency of professional fluoride application was 11.43% and 22.86% in the SSL and EL groups, respectively."

Discussion\nIn this study, the confounders of dental caries were well-controlled between the two groups at baseline [35]. Toothbrushing is the most common oral hygiene practice for mechanical plaque control. It is a fundamental behavior for maintaining and promoting oral health [36]. The American Dental Association states that powered and manual toothbrushes are both effective at removing the dental biofilm that causes dental caries [37]. However, currently, there is no consensus on the recommendations for manual toothbrushing techniques between dentists, oral health therapists, and dental products [15]. Therefore, it is important to define toothbrushing techniques and to determine which techniques are more effective in removing dental biofilm to provide consistent and evidence-based oral hygiene education. Notably, the complete removal of dental biofilm can never be achieved, and after a single self-performed brushing, the amount of oral biofilm\nFigure 5.

Toothbrushing is the most common oral hygiene practice for mechanical plaque control. It is a fundamental behavior for maintaining and promoting oral health [36]. The American Dental Association states that powered and manual toothbrushes are both effective at removing the dental biofilm that causes dental caries [37]. However, currently, there is no consensus on the recommendations for manual toothbrushing techniques between dentists, oral health therapists, and dental products [15]. Therefore, it is important to define toothbrushing techniques and to determine which techniques are more effective in removing dental biofilm to provide consistent and evidence-based oral hygiene education. Notably, the complete removal of dental biofilm can never be achieved, and after a single self-performed brushing, the amount of oral biofilm can only be reduced by 50\u201360% [38,39]. Fixed orthodontic appliances caused significant changes in the distribution of the dental biofilm. An increase in the amount of supragingival dental biofilm not only on the interproximal but also on the vestibular surface of the teeth was markedly observed in orthodontic patients [40]. In orthodontic patients, the number of locations out of reach of mechanical removal is higher, making orthodontic patients more prone to oral diseases than non-orthodontic patients [2]. In the present study, we found that the combined horizontal\u2013Charters\u2013modified Bass tooth brushing technique decreased the cariogenic dental biofilm in the SSL and EL groups to 8% and 25%, respectively. This implies that the toothbrushing technique effectively reversed the imbalance in dental biofilm in orthodontic patients [4]. Based on the ecological plaque hypothesis, caries preventive strategies should focus on reducing the cariogenic virulence factors that are responsible for dental biofilm dysbiosis [41]. However, previous studies on toothbrushing effectiveness typically monitored the quantity of dental biofilm rather than dental biofilm cariogenicity. Acid production at low pH is an important trait of cariogenic bacteria. Therefore, an assessment of acid production by the cariogenic bacteria in the biofilm can be an adjunctive indicator for caries risk assessment. Several tests have been developed to detect the presence of acidogenic bacteria in dental biofilm. Colorimetric tests for chairside use provide a simple means for assessing the pH-lowering potential of dental biofilm without emphasizing any one particular organic acid [21,42]. Our results indicated that we could use a three-tone disclosing gel to monitor the effectiveness of toothbrushing in reducing dental biofilm cariogenicity. Currently, there is a lack of sufficient scientific evidence to support any recommendations on toothbrushing techniques for orthodontic patients [16]. A previous study compared the effectiveness of different toothbrushing methods in orthodontic patients [17]. They found a significant reduction in the Silness and Loe plaque index in orthodontic patients when using the scrubbing (46.1%), the modified Stillman (41.7%), and the Bass (32.5%) techniques for 9 months. In contrast, Bhatia et al. [18] reported that there was no significant difference in the Silness and Loe plaque index and S. mutans levels in dental biofilm in patients treated\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 731 11 of 14\nwith fixed appliances after using the modified Bass toothbrushing technique for 12 months. However, they found a significant difference in the plaque index and S. mutans levels between the modified Bass and habitual technique groups. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the horizontal technique combined with the Charter\u2019s and modified Bass techniques based on the reduced dental biofilm cariogenicity in the EL and SSL groups. Mature dental biofilm is closely related to periodontal diseases [43]. However, combined toothbrushing reduced the percentage of mature dental biofilm in the SSL but not the EL group. These differing results might be due to the differences in new retentive areas and the physical properties of the two ligatures. A rough surface provides a favorable environment for bacterial adhesion and biofilm maturation because a rough surface plays a protective role against shear force and increases the area available for biofilm formation [44]. SSL had pits, grooves, and scratches on the surface after being used in the oral cavity for four weeks [45] and two months [46]. In addition, a positive correlation was found between surface roughness and oral microbial adhesion on different orthodontic wires [45]. EL is considered an organic material, which would be more amenable to bacterial colonization than SSL, which is an inorganic material with an inert metal surface. The differences in surface topography and structural characteristics of EL and SSL may also enhance bacterial colonization [47]. A key strength of our study is that the CONSORT guideline was used to improve the quality of this trial [24]. Another strength is that the short-term nature of this trial was useful for controlling confounding variables, such as participant compliance. We also standardized our methodology by adhering to the combined horizontal\u2013Charters\u2013modified Bass toothbrushing technique. In addition, we assessed dietary habits as a possible confounder because dental biofilm formation is directly affected by diet habits and can vary depending on the types of foods consumed and oral hygiene practices [48,49]. Currently, for time-efficient orthodontics, elastic rings are used as the material of choice to ligate orthodontic arch wires to brackets rather than stainless steel ligatures. However, our results suggest that stainless steel wire ligation may be better than elastomeric ligation for dental biofilm management in orthodontic patients. A systematic review suggested that large, well-designed, randomized controlled trials are required to provide unequivocal recommendations for a particular ligation method that can effectively reduce dental biofilm formation in patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances [5]. This study has some limitations. Blinding of the investigator and participants was not feasible because the difference in ligation materials was recognizable. To limit the potential for bias due to unblinded assessment, a clinical study suggested that the trial needed to modify the definition of the study outcome to be objective rather than subjective [50]. In the present study, dental biofilm maturity was objectively assessed because the different staining colors were distinctly discernable by the investigators and participants. In addition, the differences in the baseline PMS scores between the groups in this trial might affect the follow-up scores after the intervention. Therefore, the chance of bias was reduced by adjusting the statistical analysis for the baseline variables. The change scores were used to assess the effects of the assigned toothbrushing on the PMS in the SSL and EL groups."
