Since the improper use of antibiotics21 and the natural selection of bacteria,22 more and more diseases are difficult to cure by current antibiotics, new strategies must be developed, such as the discovery of derivatives of known antibacterial agents.\nou University, Lanzhou, China.

Furazolidone (FZD, 3-(5-nitrofurfurylideneamino)-2-oxazolidinone) and Nitrofurantoin (NFT, 1-(((5-nitro-2-furanyl) methylene) amino)2,4-imidazolidinedione) are members of 5-nitrofurans (NFs),28 which have broad-spectrum antibacterial effect against Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria.29,30 In particular, FZD was proved to be the only successful NFs against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).30,31 Therefore, modication of N-a position of these two antibacterial drugs can afford more active compounds without affecting the target.\nHerein, we successfully modied theN-a position of FZD and NFT, and converted the N-a position C\u2013H bond into C\u2013O, C\u2013C, C\u2013N, and C\u2013S bonds by Cu(I) catalyzed C\u2013H LSF (Fig. 1c) and the reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 1d. 18 analogues including 16 FZD derivatives and 2 NFT derivatives were synthesized and their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in vitro were measured. Several compounds were superior to parent drug in activity. We hope that this method can provide an idea of LSF at the N-a position to medicinal chemists and help them obtain desired compounds in a fast and low-cost way."

A variety of functional groups, such as those containing O, N, and S, were projected to be introduced in N-a position in order to increase the receptor-binding capacity and activity of the drug. Herein, we successfully converted C\u2013H bonds into C\u2013O and C\u2013C bonds. Since N and S are the most common active atoms in medicinale compounds, we also paid attention to C\u2013N and C\u2013S coupling for the rst time. Derivatives of FZD were obtained using copper(I) catalyzed C\u2013H LSF in desired yield (43\u201395%). A series of groups were added in N-a position of NFs containing \u2013OH, \u2013OCH3, \u2013N3, \u2013CN, etc. The analogues are shown in Fig. 2, including 16 FZD derivatives and 2 NFT derivatives.\nWe initially oxidized FZD with the conditions of CuOAc/ Ligand, H2O and N-uorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) in CH3CN, obtained hemiaminal 1 in 91% yield. Replacing water with methanol or azidotrimethylsilan in above system, the corresponding FZD derivatives 2 and 3 were formed in one-step with good yields (93% and 83% respectively).\nInuenced by the one-step reaction of trimethylsilane, we proceeded with the C\u2013N coupling. Amines were initially added\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nto our reaction system in order to obtain C\u2013N coupled products in one-step, but the reaction failed. Therefore, a one-pot reaction was performed. Aer the completion of the reaction of hemiaminal 1, an amine was added to afford 4 and 5 in excellent yields (89% and 87% respectively). It is worth mentioning that chain amines such as dimethylamine, n-propylamine, Nmethyl-n-propylamine and ammonium salts including methylamine hydrochloride and ethylamine hydrochloride could react with hemiaminal 1 giving corresponding C\u2013N coupling products. However, these desired products were all unstable, they partially hydrolyzed during purication, back to hemiaminal 1, preventing us from obtaining pure products.\nNext, we focused on the C\u2013C coupling at the N-a position of NFs. Methylation of 1 with diethylaminosulfur triuoride (DAST) afforded 6 in moderate yields (71%). Treatment of 1 with BF3$OEt2 and trimethylsilylcyanide provided products 7 in moderate yield (45%). Moreover, in order to evaluate the effect of active hydrogen, we further synthesized amide 8 with two active hydrogens based on product 7 under the conditions of LiOH and H2O2, the overall yield of two steps was 43%. Compounds 9\u201310 were products of hemiaminal 1, BF3$OEt2,\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 3204\u20133209 | 3205\nFig. 2 Late-stage functionalization of FZD and NFT.

Unexpectedly, when propanethiol, isopropylthiol, and benzylthiol were used as nucleophiles, BF3$OEt2 could not promote the reaction. Other Lewis acids were also used for the same reason but failed.

However, compound 2, with an additional \u2013OCH3, exhibited low activity against these three bacterial strains. We speculated that the enhanced activity of compound 1 is due to the active hydrogen on the hydroxyl group. Compounds 3\u20135 containing C\u2013N bonds also showed strong inhibition against S. aureus and E. coli. Neither compound 6 nor 7 which containing small groups such as \u2013CN, \u2013CH3 showed better activity. It is worth mentioning that we synthesized compound 8, an amide with two active hydrogens based on compound 7. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds might form in compound 8, but the activity was poor. Antibacterial result showed 8 even had lower activity than compound 7. Coupling with allyl group afforded compound 9, which led to a substantial decrease in activity. Introducing an aromatic moiety into N-a position resulted in analogues 10 and 11, which were found to have a complete loss of activity in comparison to FZD. This may have been because the aromatic moieties of 10 and 11 inuenced their binding ability to the target. Furthermore, the introduction of sulfur did not afford better activity for compounds 12\u201316. In addition, representative compounds 1 (OH-FZD) and 6 (Me-FZD) were chosen and their ability against H. pylori was tested. MICs of FZD, 1, and 6 were all less than 0.0976.

This method was rstly applied to the coupling of C\u2013N and C\u2013S bonds. A series of functional groups were added including \u2013OH, \u2013OCH3, \u2013N3, \u2013CN, etc. We successfully synthesized 16 FZD derivatives and 2 NFT derivatives in moderate to good yields. Three bacteria strains and one fungi strain were measured, the modied compounds had broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, especially derivatives 1 and 18. Compounds 1, 3, 4, and 5 exhibited identical or better activity than that of the parent compound FZD against S. aureus. Cell cytotoxicity assays of potent compounds 1, 3, 4, 5, and 18 indicated non-cytotoxic against HepaRG cells. This study is an attempt to explore the application of copper(I) catalyzed C\u2013H LSF, which provides good results and proves the practicability of this method. We believe our study could provide a reference for the application of LSF in pharmaceutical chemistry."
