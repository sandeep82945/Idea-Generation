Os\u00f3rio1, Foued Amrani1,2, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Delahaye1,2, Ali Dhaybi1, Kostiantyn Vasko 1, Federico Melli3, Fabio Giovanardi3, Damien Vandembroucq4, Gilles Tessier5, Luca Vincetti 3, Beno\u00eet Debord1,2, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric G\u00e9r\u00f4me1,2 & Fetah Benabid 1,2\nWhile optical fibers display excellent performances in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet ranges remain poorly addressed by them. Obtaining better fibers for the short-wavelength range has been restricted, in all fiber optics, by scattering processes. In hollow-core fibers, the scattering loss arises from the core roughness and represents the limiting factor for loss reduction regardless of the cladding confinement power. Here, we report on the reduction of the core surface roughness of hollow-core fibers by modifying their fabrication technique. The effect of the modified process has been quantified and the results showed a root-mean-square surface roughness reduction from 0.40 to 0.15 nm. The improvement in the core surface entailedfiberswith ultralow loss at short wavelengths. The results reveal this approach as a promising path for the development of hollow-core fibers with loss that can potentially be orders of magnitude lower than the ones achievable with silica-core counterparts.\nHollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HCPCFs) approach their 30th anniversary1. Their remarkable performances, demonstrated in both fundamental and applied fields, justify the great efforts devoted by the HCPCF community toward a better understanding of their properties, the optimization of their designs and fabrication processes, as well as the consolidation of the application fields. Historically, photonic bandgap (PBG) fibers1 were the first HCPCFs to appear as an alternative to overcome the fundamental constraint imposed by the Rayleigh scattering limit of glass and attain ultralow loss, particularly in the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges, where silica attenuation dramatically increases. PBG fibers, however, have been dismissed as eligible candidates to surpass solid-core silica fibers\u2019 loss levels due to limitations such as the strong core-cladding optical overlap, the presence of surface modes, and their core surface roughness. In addition, having PBG fibers guiding at short wavelengths (<1\u03bcm) requires smaller cladding pitches, which further complicates PBG fibers\u2019 fabrication processes. The lowest loss reported for PBG fibers is 1.2 dB/km around 1600 nm2. At shorter wavelengths, the minimum attenuation is much higher: 870dB/km at 557nm3. Alternatively, inhibited-coupling (IC) guiding fibers4 have been proven to exhibit confinement loss (CL) figures comparable to PBG fibers but with the outstanding difference that the core-cladding optical overlap is several orders of magnitude smaller. Moreover, as IC fibers work on the large pitch regime, greater cladding pitches can be used to operate at short wavelengths. Furthermore, the criteria for IC guidance cause the fiber CL to be strongly dependent on the core contour shape. It inspired, for example, the proposal of the hypocycloid core contour (negative curvature) in 20105,6, which provided a dramatic reduction of the loss in IC fibers. Also, the demonstration of guidance in single-ring tubular lattice (SR-TL) HCPCFs7 stands out as an important achievement that motivated further developments in HCPCF technology.\nReceived: 25 July 2022\nAccepted: 14 February 2023\nCheck for updates\n1GPPMMGroup, XLIM Institute, CNRSUMR 7252, University of Limoges, Limoges 87060, France. 2GLOphotonics, 123Avenue Albert Thomas, Limoges 87060, France. 3Departament of Engineering \u201cEnzo Ferrari\u201d, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena 41125, Italy. 4PMMH, CNRS UMR 7636, ESPCI Paris, PSL University, Sorbonne University, Paris Cit\u00e9 University, Paris 75005, France. 5Vision Institute, CNRS UMR 7210, Sorbonne University, Paris 75012, France.\ne-mail: f.benabid@xlim.fr\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1146 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nThe current state-of-the-art loss levels in IC fibers are set by the surface-roughness scattering loss (SSL) for fibers guiding at short wavelengths (<1\u03bcm)andby thefiber design forfibers guiding at longer ones8,9. Concerning the latter, alternative cladding design to kagome and SR-TL HCPCF has entailed ultralow loss figures in the infrared range10\u201313. On the other hand, for shorter wavelengths, SR-TL HCPCFs have provided loss values of 7.7 dB/km at 750nm and 13.8 dB/km at 539nm7,14. Nested-tubesHCPCFs, in turn, display lossfigures of 0.6 dB/ km at 850 nm and 2.85 dB/km at 660nm12,15. Finally, conjoined-tubes HCPCFs show the figures of 3.8 dB/km at 680nm and 4.9 dB/km at 558nm16. In the UV range, loss figures values of 100 dB/km at 218 nm and 130 dB/km at 300 nm have been measured17,18.\nIn this framework, although improvements in the cladding design of IC guiding fibers have allowed decreasing the loss figures in the infrared range, obtaining fibers for the visible and ultraviolet range remains amore challenging task due to the SSL limitation. Indeed, SSL is set by the core surface roughness, which arises from thermal surface capillary waves (SCW) that are frozen during the fiber draw2. SSL assumes the form of \u03b1SSL =\u03b7\u00d7 F \u00d7 \u03bb=\u03bb0\n3 (where F is the core mode optical overlap with the core contour, \u03bb is the wavelength, and \u03bb0 is a calibrating constant) and scales quadratically with the surface roughness root-mean-square (rms) height, i.e., \u03b1SSL / h2rms2. Indeed, the factor \u03b7 in the SSL formula relates to the surface quality, being proportional to h2rms. Reducing the SSL, therefore, implies controlling and/or reducing the roughness height. In this context, despite recent results showing that increasing the drawing stress during the fabrication process of silica capillaries diminishes the roughness along the drawing direction19, no work has been reported so far on HCPCFs and on how to mitigate SSLdominated scenarios.\nHere, we report that, by revisiting the HCPCFs fabrication technique, reduction of the rms roughness of the core surfaces of HCPCFs is possible. Our innovative technique incorporates the concept that shear flow can attenuate capillary waves20,21 in the fiber drawing process. Having counter-directional gas and glass fluxes during the fiber fabrication allowed to attain increased shear rate on themembranes of SR-TL HCPCFs while preserving the fiber structural integrity and suitable microstructure geometrical dimensions. In our investigation, we studied two sets of fibers, the first one produced by using the standard HCPCF fabrication method and the second one by using this innovative technique. Optical profilometry measurements showed that the rms roughness was reduced from 0.40 nm down to 0.15 nm via the utilizationof the techniqueproposedherein. The reductionof the core surface roughness allowed to obtain fibers with loss figures as low as 50 dB/km at 290nm, 9.7 dB/km at 369 nm, 5.0dB/km at 480 nm, 0.9 dB/km at 558 nm, and 1.8 dB/km at 719 nm. We believe that our results provide a new framework for the development of optical fibers transmitting light in the visible and ultraviolet ranges, and open exciting prospects in UV-photonics."

            "text": "Surface capillary waves within HCPCFs\u2019 scenario During HCPCF fabrication, the structured glass preforms undergo heating inside a high-temperature furnace. The heating process entails melting of the preform, which allows, by suitably pulling the fiber and pressurizing its internal microstructure, to successfully fabricate the desired HCPCF architecture. Within the heating process context, the dynamics of SCW is established as a result of two competing effects, namely the thermal noise, which is prone to ruffle the surface, and the interface tension, which tends to attenuate the SCW oscillations. Indeed, the SCW dynamics has been proven to govern the surface roughness of the glass surfaces in HCPCFs, as they are abruptly frozen at the glass transition temperature,TG2. Under the SCW framework, the Fourier spectrum of the surface height profiles, which is typically assessed via their power spectral density (PSD) functions calculated over 1D surface profiles, is expected to display a 1/f behavior, where f is\nthe spatial frequency. The 1/f-trended behavior of PSD functions accounted from HCPCFs core surface profiles has been observed in previous works2,21\u201323. For low spatial frequency values (<5 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u00b5m\u22121), however, deviation from the 1/f trend has been observed, and PSD functions following a 1/f3-trendhavebeendetected23. The latter is likely to be due to boundary conditions imposed by the heat zone length of the drawing furnace.\nAsmentioned before, we here develop a technique for reducing the roughness of HCPCFs core surfaces to attain ultralow loss figures in the short-wavelength range. In our study, we employ eight-cladding tubes SR-TL HCPCFs due to their potential to provide ultralow loss in the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges allied to a simple fiber structure from a fabrication viewpoint. Thus, hereafter all the fibers studied in the present work are eight-cladding tubes SR-TL HCPCFs. Figure 1a presents the cross-section of one of the SR-TL HCPCFs used in our investigations, which has been fabricated by using standard HCPCF fabrication methods. To assess the quality of the core surfaces in the fiber, optical profilometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been employed. Figure 1b shows typical height profiles (\u0394h) along the fiber axis measured by using AFM (top plot) and a picometer-sensitivity optical profilometer (bottom plot)22,23. Figure 1c, in turn, presents a representative AFM-measured surface profile taken for a 6\u03bcm\u00d76\u03bcm area on the fiber core surface. The optical profilometer and AFMdata allow obtaining the PSD plot shown in Fig. 1d. Optical profilometry is limited to low spatial frequencies (a few 10\u22121\u03bcm\u22121) by diffraction and probe spot spacing. Conversely, the scanning ranges limit AFM to higher frequencies, between 1 and a few tens of \u03bcm\u22121. The combination of the two measurement techniques provides a spatial frequency interval ranging from 1\u00d7 10\u22122 \u00b5m\u22121 to 20 \u00b5m\u22121. For comparison, we include in the plot a 1/f trend calculated from Eq. (1) given below2:\n\u2223HSCW f\u00f0 \u00de\u22232 = kBTG 2\u03c0\u03b3f\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant and \u03b3 is the surface tension, which stands for the PSD expected from 1D surface profiles under the SCW scenario. Here, we used TG/\u03b3 = 2000K.m\n2/J, which is consistent with the TG and \u03b3 values reported in ref.\n2 for drawn silica capillaries. It is seen that the PSD trend deviates from the 1/f behavior for f < 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u00b5m\u22121, similar to what has been found in recent investigations22,23. While the 1/f behavior directly results from the freezing of SCW, the deviation of it at lower frequencies can be ascribed to boundary size effects. As an additional comparison, we show in Fig. 1d a modified trend (green dashed line in Fig. 1d, attained when quantizing the SCW transversally), obtained when multiplying Eq. (1) by coth Wf2 , where W is the perimeter of the cladding tubes2. The latter is calculated here for cladding tubes with 15\u03bcm diameter, a typical value in our fibers. While the trend modulated by the hyperbolic cotangent term allows calculating larger PSD values at low spatial frequencies compared to the 1/f trend, the measured PSD remains larger than it, consistently with what has been reported previously23.\nShear stress as a means to structure the surface roughness profile The inherent roughness of glass surfaces arises from fluctuations of capillary waves, which, as discussed in the last section, result from the interplay between the thermal noise and the glass interface tension24. In the absence of shear, the rms height of these frozen fluctuations\namounts to ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi kBTG 2\u03c0\u03b3 ln \u039bM\u039bm r \u22480:4nm, which is obtained when using\nTG = 1500K, \u03b3\u22480:3J=m 2, and the upper and lower spatial cutoffs, \u039bM and \u039bm, associated respectively with the silica capillary length (4mm) and molecular length (0.5 nm)25. This rms height level is, hence, referenced as thermodynamic equilibrium surface roughness.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1146 2\nIn 2006, Derks et al.21 concluded that shear can suppress capillary waves and make interfaces smoother. To describe this effect, the authors introduced the concept of effective interfacial tension, \u03b3ef f , to be assigned to sheared systems, which increases with the shear rate. According to the model proposed in ref. 21, the effective interfacial tension can be expressed by Eq. (2), where \u03b30 is the interfacial tension at zero shear and\u03a6 \u03ba\u00f0 \u00de is a positive function that grows with increasing shear rate \u03ba.\n\u03b3ef f \u03ba\u00f0 \u00de= \u03b30 +\u03a6 \u03ba\u00f0 \u00de \u00f02\u00de\nIf one considers a glass surface surrounded by air, the function \u03a6 \u03ba\u00f0 \u00de will be given by Eq.

Particularly, Smith et al.26,27 performed simulations on the dynamics of laterally driven surfaces and concluded that the existence of shear implies the reduction of the interfacial width. They affirmed that shear acts as an effective confinement force in the system which can suppress the interfacial capillary wave fluctuations. Similar to ref. 21, they argued that defining a \u201cnonequilibrium surface tension\u201d to theoreticallyfit the behavior of the heightheight correlation functions of the sheared surfaces entails an increase of such tension as the system is more strongly driven.\nWithin the context of optical fibers, the reduction of the roughness of sheared glass surfaces has been assessed by Bresson et al. on glass tubes19. In the latter, by evaluating the surface profiles of the glass tubes with typical diameters of 220\u03bcm and thicknesses of 15\u03bcm, the authors identified that the surface roughness levels can be lowered by the fiber drawing process thanks to the attenuation of the SCW along the drawing direction. In this context, they detected an anisotropic behavior of the height correlations in the fabricated fibers and showed that the glass surfaces can retain a structural signature of the direction of the flow that took place during the fiber fabrication.\nThe parameter chosen in ref. 19 for studying the SCW attenuation, the tension experienced by the fiber during fabrication, results however from several draw parameters such as furnace temperature, draw speeds, the dimensions of fiber to be drawn and of its preform. Hence, although it had allowed the authors in ref. 19 to correlate the lessening of the surface roughness levels in the studied glass tubes with the drawing process, such a parameter does not present itself as the most adequate indicator of flow establishment inside HCPCFs for our\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1146 3\ninvestigation, whose aim is to study the reduction of the surface roughness levels inside SR-TL HCPCFs.\nThus, in order to establish a flow inside the microstructure of SRTLHCPCFs, we haveworkedwith the application of pressure gradients inside the preforms during fiber fabrication, as described in the following. To study the motion of the gas inside the fiber during its fabrication and, thus, provide a toy model to account for the shear rate levels inside the fiber core, one can approach Navier\u2013Stokes and continuity equations applied to the flow of a gas inside a tube with varying diameters28. If one hypothesizes on having a fully developed laminar flow scenario and assumes that the transition region between the preform and the fiber has an exponential shape, the velocity of the gas along the axis of the fiber (z-direction), uz , can be written as in Eq. (5), where \u0394P =P1 P2 is the pressure variation between the preform and fiber regions (P1 and P2, respectively), L is the preform-to-fiber transition length, and r is the radial coordinate. The parameter \u03be , in turn, considers the exponential shape of the preform-to-fiber transition and is given by Eq. (6), where r0 and rf are the preform and fiber radii, respectively29,30. Figure 2a provides a diagram of the transition region between the preform and the fiber.\nuz = \u2223\u0394P\u2223 4\u03bcairL r20exp 2\u03be z L\nh i r2 h i \u00f05\u00de\n\u03be = ln r0 rf\n! \u00f06\u00de\nWe remark that the laminar flow hypothesis is sound as the calculated Reynolds number for the gasflowwe study herein has anorder of magnitude of 10\u22124. In addition, we mention that our toy model considers no glass flow. This is also a sound hypothesis as the axial velocity of the glass is considerably lower than the speed of the gas inside thefiber (the ratio between the axial velocities of the gas and the glass flows is estimated to be ~30). Finally, in our model, we consider no collapse or expansion of the glass. This assumption is valid because we control the pressure levels inside the fiber to avoid glass collapsing, and, although in our draws we use pressure to inflate the microstructure holes, the rate of such expansion is small. These considerations allow us to use the negative exponential to describe the shape of the preform-to-fiber transition region.\nEquation (5) allows calculating the volumetricflow rate at a certain position z and, subsequently, the shear rate \u03ba associated with such a\nflow. The resulting expression is shown in Eq. (7).\n\u03ba= \u2223\u0394P\u2223r0exp \u03bezL\n2\u03bcairL\n\u00f07\u00de\nThis, in turn, allows estimating the effective interfacial tension of the sheared surface of the tube wall by using Eq. (2). Figure 2b shows a color plot of\n\u03b3ef f \u03b30\nfor typical ranges of pressure gradient, \u2223\u0394P\u2223, and fiber and preform radius ratios,r0rf , during HCPCF drawing. By observing Fig. 2b, one sees that the toy model one approaches herein provides a working range for the fiber drawing parameters entailing increased\n\u03b3ef f \u03b30\nratio (e.g., pressure values, preform, and fiber dimensions), which are expected to impact h2 D E values. In particular, in Fig. 2c, we present a graph of \u03b3ef f \u03b30\nas a function of r0rf for \u2223\u0394P\u2223= 5kPa, where we can observe that for r0rf =35, a typical down-ratio value in our fiber drawings,\u03b3ef f \u03b30 = 3:2, which stands for the expected reduction ratioon h2 D E\nvalues, according to Eq. (4). In the graph shown in Fig. 2c, we used T =2300K, L=2cm, \u03bcair = 5:817 \u00d7 10\n5Pa s, \u03bcglass =6:165 \u00d7 103Pa s, \u03b30 =0:3N=m, \u03c1air =0:199kg=m 3, and \u03c1glass =2200kg=m 3.\nWhile the above model is satisfactory in demonstrating the establishment of a shear flow, an essential condition for surface roughness rms reduction, and gives a qualitative h2 D E reduction factor consistent with the experimental results to be described in the next sections, we signal that such a simplified model certainly does not consider all the complexity of the fiber drawing. Furthermore, the choice of the parameters in making the preform and the fibers must ensure both the fiber structural integrity and the establishment of the necessary shearing during the fiber draw. Consequently, the fiber design and drawing follow a highly demanding trade-off between the different preform and fiber drawing parameters, an experimental work that has been very carefully designed and carried out by us. In our investigation, and considering the limited range of the fiber drawing parameters, the design of fiber fabrication entails adequate fiber microstructures, preform and fiber dimensions, fiber drawing speeds, as well as the pressure values to be applied in the internal microstructure of the fibers during fabrication, able to accommodate the shear flow conditions and attain fibers with optimized performances.\nSurface roughness reduction in SR-TL HCPCFs The usual technique for drawing SR-TL HCPCFs employs the pressurization of core and cladding regions, so adequate dimensions are achieved on the fiber cross-section. Current techniques, thus, uses co-directional gas and glass flows during fabrication. Differently,\nc Graph for \u03b3ef f\u03b30 as a function of r0 rf for \u2223\u0394P\u2223= 5kPa.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1146 4\nhere we propose the utilization of counter-directional gas and glass flowswithin the fibermicrostructure during the fiber draw for adding shear to the microstructure\u2019s glass membranes and, hence, attaining smoother core surfaces. In our technique, a vacuum is applied to the fiber core, while the ring of tubes in the SR-TL HCPCF structure is pressurized so to achieve adequate fiber geometrical parameters (Fig. 3a). Figure 3b presents a diagram for the interfaces between the surfaces of the cladding tubes, the fiber core, and the internal region of the cladding tubes. During the fabrication routines following our methods, the fiber outer diameter variation was no larger than 0.5%. Also, evaluation of the fiber microstructure elements allowed for ascertaining a highly consistent fiber cross-section along the 500\u20131000m typically fabricated lengths.\nTo demonstrate the reduction of the core surface roughness via the utilization of the approach proposed herein, we systematically studied two sets of SR-TLHCPCFs, both fabricated by using the stackand-draw technique. The first group (G#1, composed of five different SR-TL HCPCFs fabricated in independent fiber draws, with cladding tubes thickness ranging from 230 to 580 nm) was produced by using the standard fabrication method for HCPCFs. Fibers in the second group (G#2, composed of nine different SR-TL HCPCFs fabricated in independent fiber draws, with cladding tubes thickness ranging from 300 to 1220 nm), instead, were produced by the innovative technique reported herein, i.e., during fiber fabrication, controlled vacuum\nwas applied to the fiber core while pressure was used to inflate the cladding tubes. Table 1 presents the geometrical dimensions of the fibers in G#1 and G#2. It is worth mentioning that to adequately perform our analyses, we have endeavored to have, in G#1 and G#2, fiberswith comparable cladding tube dimensions, as one can verify in Table 1.\nThe core roughness profiles along the propagation axis of the fibers in G#1 and G#2 have been experimentally measured by using a picometer-resolution optical profilometer22,23. Figure 3c shows typical surface profiles for fibers in G#1 (left-hand side) and G#2 (right-hand side) measured in the optical profilometry experiments. It is seen that fibers in G#2 present reduced peak-to-peak roughness values compared with fibers in G#1 (for fibers in G#1, peak-to-peak values are around 1.5 nm, and, for fibers in G#2, around 0.5 nm). Moreover, Fig. 3d exposes typical PSD traces for fibers in G#1 and G#2. Noteworthily, the fabricationmethods reported herein entail a reductionof the PSD values at spatial frequencies lower than 10\u22121 \u03bcm\u22121, which, in turn, readily impacts the rms roughness of the fibers. It is worth mentioning that, although one observes larger PSD values at spectral frequencies greater than 1\u03bcm\u22121 for fibers in G#2 than for fibers in G#1, the PSD figures at larger spatial frequencies are orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding PSD values at lower spatial frequencies. It entails that the spectral components of the roughness at higher frequencies have a significantly reduced impact on the rms surface\n(sample numbering according to Table 1). AFM atomic force microscopy, PSD power spectral density.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1146 5\nroughness compared with the components at lower spatial frequencies, and also on the SSL.\nIn this context, Fig. 3e shows box charts for the rms roughness values, accounted from the optical profilometry measurements, for fibers inG#1 (left-hand side) andG#2 (right-hand side). Values in Fig. 3e were obtained from the rms roughness values measured in several scans (with typical lengths of 200\u03bcm) for the fiber samples in G#1 and G#2. It is seen that fibers in G#1 have rms roughness values that vary around 0.40 nmwhile fibers in G#2 have rms roughness values around 0.15 nm. Indeed, the utilization of our techniques allowed improving the quality of the core surface of the HCPCFs by a factor of 2.7 and attaining fibers with core surface roughness lower than the thermodynamic equilibrium level.\nUltralow loss in SR-TL HCPCF in the short-wavelength range As described in the last section, the utilization of our methods has entailed fibers with smoother core surfaces. A direct effect of the reduction of the roughness levels of the core surfaces is the lowering of the SSL in the fabricated fibers. In this framework, we report on SR-TL HCPCFs with ultralow loss in the short-wavelength range (i.e., \u03bb < 1 \u03bcm).\nFigure 4 summarizes the transmission loss of both groups of fibers along with the numerically simulated main sources of power attenuation during the optical propagation.\nFigure 4a presents the loss spectra of representative fibers in G#1 and G#2 with similar cladding tube thicknesses (t ~ 0.6 \u00b5m). By observing the loss spectrum of G#1 fiber (black curve; core diameter 41\u03bcm), one sees that there is a considerable loss increase for wavelengths lower than 600 nm. Otherwise, the results for G#2 fiber (blue curve; core diameter 27 \u03bcm) show that a decreasing loss trend is maintained even for wavelengths lower than 600 nm, and this is despite having a smaller core diameter and its subsequent higher CL. Thedifference between the loss values for the band between600and 1000nm is likely due to the different core diameters of the two considered fibers. To further substantiate our observations, we plot, in Fig. 4b, the loss values of the representative fibers in G#1 and G#2 multiplied by Rco4, where Rco is the core radius. Multiplication by such a factor allows to normalize the fiber loss trends with respect to the core radii of the fibers31 and provides a clearer visualization of the difference between the loss trends for fibers in G#1 and G#2. The distinction between the loss behaviors of fibers in G#1 andG#2 shown in Fig. 4b is, therefore, a strong indicator of the SSL reduction in G#2 fibers as one will further analyze in the following when considering the different loss mechanisms in HCPCFs.\nIn order to quantify the impact of the surface roughness considering the different transmission lossmechanisms, which are the CL,\nSSL, bending loss, and microbending loss (MBL)32, we have started by estimating the surface roughness impact on the CL. This was done by considering a transverse roughness-free SR-TL-HCPCF with a core radius of 13.5 \u03bcmand thickness of 0.6 \u00b5m (purple dashed line in Fig. 4c and labeled ideal structure) and comparing it with the same fiber but displaying a transverse roughness rms value of 0.15 nm (blue solid line in Fig. 4c and labeled t-roughness)\u2014weclarify that, althoughwedid not measure the roughnesson the transversedirection,we assume that the transverse surface height variations follow the characteristics of the roughness measured along the fiber axis as its formation stems from a stochastic process. Observation of Fig. 4c allows verifying that the transverse roughness levels minorly impact the CL values in our operating conditions. We can, thus, disregard this influence in our following analyses.\nThe breakdown of the contributions of the different loss mechanisms accounted from the simulations (CL, SSL, MBL, and TL = CL + SSL +MBL) is presented in Fig. 4d, e (dashed and dotted curves), together with the measured loss spectra (solid curves). In the literature, the MBL is described according to MBL = \u03b220C \u0394\u03b201 0\u2223x2\u22230 \u2223 1\u2223x2\u22230 \u22232 , where \u03b20 is the propagation constant of the core fundamental mode, C \u0394\u03b201 =C0=\u0394\u03b2 2 01 is the PSD of the microbending stochastic process computed at \u0394\u03b201, the difference between the propagation constants of the core fundamental and LP11-like modes, and C0 = 1 32. In turn, 0\u2223x2\u22230\nis the power lost by the core fundamental mode and \u2223 1\u2223x2\u22230 \u22232is the power transferred from the fundamental mode to the LP11-like modes32. Herein, we used \u2223 1\u2223x2\u22230 \u22232 = 033. It is worth mentioning, however, that although we present the MBL contributions corresponding to our fibers so as to situate our results among the other studies available in the literature, we consider the description of the MBL in HCPCFs as a model still in construction which calls out for further studies by the HCPCF community. In addition, we mention that the CL values shown in Fig. 4d, e consider the bending loss corresponding to a curvature radius of 1 m, which have been the radius of the fiber coils in the loss measurements.\nThe most striking information one can assimilate from Fig. 4d, e concerns the SSL. Data in Fig. 4d (G#1 representative fiber) shows that the factor \u03b7 in the SSL expression (\u03b1SSL =\u03b7\u00d7 F \u00d7 \u03bb=\u03bb0\n3, as described in the introduction) that entails adequate fitting between the simulated TL and themeasured loss is \u03b7G#1 = 8:0\u00d7 10\n3. In turn, the value of \u03b7 that allows attaining suitable fitting between the simulated TL and the measured loss for the representative fiber in G#2 is \u03b7G#2 = 1:1 \u00d7 10\n3. If one reminds that, as discussed in the introduction, \u03b7 can be related to the square of the rms surface roughness, the ratio between the square roots of the obtained \u03b7 can be readily associated with the reduction of the rms core surface roughness values in our fibers. Remarkably, ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03b7G#1 \u03b7G#2 q \u22482:7, which is consistent with our surface roughness measurement results. In the above-mentioned analyses, we used \u03bb0 = 1700 nm. Also, we mention that different C0 values in the MBL formula have been considered (from 0 to 2.8633), and the ratio of the rms roughness suppressionwas found to be in the range of 2.3\u20132.7.\nFinally, we report on record attenuation values for fibers guiding at short wavelengths. Figure 5a, b exhibits the cross-sections of the fibers we report here (referenced as Fiber A and Fiber B, both fabricated by following the innovative fabrication methods reported herein) and their corresponding measured loss. The minimum loss figures of Fiber A are 50.0dB/km at 290 nm, 9.7 dB/km at 369 nm, and 5.0dB/km at 480 nm. In turn, the minimum attenuation values for Fiber B are 0.9 dB/km at 558nm and 1.8 dB/km at 719 nm. Table 2 displays the fibers\u2019 geometrical parameters.\nFigure 5c contextualizes the results of Fiber A and Fiber B within the IC HCPCF framework in the wavelength interval between 250 and 900 nm. In addition, Fig. 5c presents the silica Rayleigh scattering limit trend (SRSL), which stands as a benchmark for situating our results\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1146 6\nwithin the fiber optics context. Noteworthily, Fiber A and Fiber B loss figures stand for record low-loss values in the short-wavelength range and lie under the SRSL, which is a fundamental limitation that hinders the reduction of attenuation values of silica-corefibers. In addition, it is remarkable that such ultralow loss figures have been attained by using a fiber architecture as simple as SR-TL HCPCFs without the need for other more complex IC HCPCF structures."

Improvements in the loss displayed by solid-core fibers, however, tend to bemarginal as they are fundamentally restricted by silica properties. HCPCFs, on the other hand, emerge as promising alternatives to circumvent\nsilica-core fibers limitations. However, the performances of HCPCF working at short wavelengths have been hitherto limited by scattering processes arising from the roughness of the fiber core surfaces.\nIn this manuscript, we reported on HCPCFs with reduced core surface roughness obtained by modifying these fibers\u2019 usual fabrication techniques. Here, we proposed the use of counter-directional gas and glass flows during the fiber draw to add shear to the fiber silica membranes and, thus, achieve smoother core surfaces. We showed that the rms roughness values were reduced from 0.40 to 0.15 nm via the application of the process proposed herein.\nThe amelioration of the core surface quality\u2014and, therefore, the reduction of SSL\u2014allowed attaining fibers with record low-loss figures in the short-wavelength range. Remarkably, the record loss figures reported herein have been accomplished by using an HCPCF structure\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1146 7\nas simple as the SR-TL HCPCF design. We understand that the results presented in this paper identify a step-change path for the developmentofopticalfibers operating at shortwavelengths.We envisage that our achievements will motivate new research efforts toward further reduction of core surface roughness in HCPCFs and, hence, toward the demonstration of even lower attenuation values, especially in the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges."

            "text": "For wavelengths larger than 400 nm, the attenuation values were obtained from cutback measurements using light from a supercontinuum source and an optical spectrum analyzer. When accounting for the loss at wavelengths shorter than 400nm, a plasma lamp was used as the light source, and the transmitted signal was measured in a spectrometer. In the setup for loss measurements in the UV range, since the spectrometer measurements\u2019 results are dependent on the alignment of the optical beam directed to it, one placed a flip mirror in-between the fiber end and the spectrometer so to allow correct positioning of the fiber output. The alignment of the fiber output beam with respect to the spectrometer window has, therefore, been performed by using the CCD camera image as a target for beamorientation.When the correct positioning of the fiber end was assured, the mirror was flipped, and the spectrometer measured the transmission signal. During the lossmeasurements, the fibers have been set in loops of 1m-bending radius. In addition, we mention that the input coupling conditions have been meticulously adjusted using free-space optics to achieve a fundamental mode-dominated modal content.
