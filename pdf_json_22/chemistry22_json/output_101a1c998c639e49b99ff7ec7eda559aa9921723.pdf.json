In this context, this work proposes a quantum Stirling cycle based on a dinuclear metal complex as a working substance. The results show that the quantum cycle operational modes can be managed when considering the change in the magnetic coupling of the material and the temperature of the reservoirs. Moreover, magnetic susceptibility can be used to characterize the heat exchanges of each cycle step and, therefore, its performance. As a proof of concept, the efficiency of the heat engine is obtained from experimental susceptibility data. These results open doors for studying quantum thermodynamic cycles by using metal complexes; and further the development of emerging quantum technologies based on these advanced materials.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn the past few decades, the rise of several technologies based on the quantum properties of advanced materials has attracted the attention of the scientific community [1\u20135]. Quantum correlations and coherence have been extensively explored as primary resources in this novel quantum devices such as quantum transistors [6, 7] and batteries [5, 8\u201311]. Furthermore, the fast development of these technologies has led the literature to increasingly consider thermodynamic aspects for describing quantum processes, leading to the development of the quantum thermodynamics area [12, 13].\nAnalogous to the development of the classical thermodynamics, the study of heat engines have become widely explored in the area of quantum thermodynamics [14\u201336]. In particular, coupled spin systems appear as robust platforms for the development of the so-called quantum heat engines (QHEs) prototypes [18\u201323, 30]. In this class of materials, low-dimensional molecular magnetic systems as quantum antiferromagnets [37\u201347] appear as promising platforms for quantum technologies [1, 5]. In these advanced materials, intramolecular interactions are strong enough to suppress external and intermolecular interactions [41, 43, 44, 48]. As a consequence, its quantum features presents highly stability against external perturbations such as high temperatures [5, 41, 43, 44], magnetic fields [45, 49] and pressure [42, 45]. Moreover, its quantum coherence and correlations are related to substantial structural and macroscopic properties [41, 42, 45, 50], which allows the management and control of its quantum properties by experimental techniques [4, 41, 42, 45].\n\u2217 clebson.cruz@ufob.edu.br \u2020 h.rastegar@jahromu.ac.ir \u2021 maronanka@id.uff.br \u00a7 troliveira@id.uff.br \u00b6 marioreis@id.uff.br\nMetal complexes has been explored in the literature for several caloric applications through classical thermodynamic cycles [38\u201340, 48]. In this scenario, this work analyzes the realization of a quantum Stirling engine whose working medium consists of a dinuclear metal complex in a d9 electronic configuration. The cycle operates between two heat baths and two magnetic couplings, handled by an external hydrostatic pressure change.\nThe results show that the four operation modes - heat engine, refrigerator, accelerator and heater - allowed by the second law of thermodynamics can be tuned by the control of the parameters of the cycle. In addition, the heat exchanged during the cycle is analytically characterized in each cycle step through the working substance\u2019s dimensionless magnetic susceptibility. Thus, from an experimental point of view, this work also shows a proof of concept for the presented theoretical model, where the efficiency of the heat engine operational mode is obtained through magnetic susceptibility data. The presented results can provide insights for future research regarding the caloric properties of metal complexes, opening doors for studying the caloric properties of metal complexes through quantum thermodynamic cycles. These can be used in the application of dinuclear metal complexes as quantum heat engines in terms of their operation modes. Therefore, this paper lays the groundwork for future research into applying metal complexes as working substances of quantum heat engines toward the development of emerging quantum technologies based on these advanced materials."

            "text": "Let us consider a dinuclear metal complex in a d9 electronic configuration as the working substance to a four-stroke Quantum Stirling cycle [15, 23, 24, 29\u201336]. This class of materials can be defined as an ideal realization of coupled 1/2-spins [5, 42, 45]. The Hamiltonian of this working substance is\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n14 54\n8v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 0\nM ay\n2 02\n3\n2 given by the Heisenberg interaction H = J~S 1 \u00b7 ~S 2, where S (k)n = (1/2)\u03c3kn are the spins of the d\n9 metallic centers, with \u03c3kn being the Pauli matrices (k \u2208 {x, y, z}), and J the magnetic coupling constant: J > 0 corresponds to an antiparallel alignment, with entangled ground state (EGS); and J < 0 corresponds to a parallel alignment, with separable ground state (SGS). The energy levels consist in s = 0 singlet (J > 0) and s = 1 triplet (J < 0) states [37]. Diagonalizing H , one can obtain the energy eigenvalues Es and the corresponding eigenstates |s,ms\u3009 [37] as\nEs=1 = 1 4 J \u2192  |s = 1,ms = +1\u3009 = | \u2191\u2191\u3009 |s = 1,ms = 0\u3009 = 1 \u221a 2 (| \u2191\u2193\u3009 + | \u2193\u2191\u3009)\n|s = 1,ms = \u22121\u3009 = | \u2193\u2193\u3009\n, (1)\nEs=0 = \u2212 3 4 J \u2192 |s = 0,ms = 0\u3009 = 1 \u221a 2 (| \u2191\u2193\u3009\u2212| \u2193\u2191\u3009) . (2)\nBesides the energy levels, the populations %n and, consequently, the entropy have a pivotal role in quantum thermodynamic processes [51, 52]. For the working substance at thermal equilibrium, the density matrix for the coupled system is given by the Gibbs form \u03c1(T ) = e\u2212H/kBT /Tre\u2212H/kBT , which can be written in terms of the populations %n, on the local basis {| \u2191\u2191\u3009, | \u2191\u2193\u3009, | \u2193\u2191\u3009, | \u2193\u2193\u3009} as the X-shaped matrix:\n\u03c1 = 1 2  2%2 0 0 0 0 %1 + %3 %3 \u2212 %1 0 0 %3 \u2212 %1 %1 + %3 0 0 0 0 2%4  . (3) Thus, from the system Hamiltonian H and the spectral decomposition of the state \u03c1, the working substance state eigenvalues %n (population) and its corresponding eigenvectors |%n\u3009 are written as a function of the molar magnetic susceptibility of the substance [41, 42, 45] as\n%1 = %2 = %3 = kBT\u03c7(J,T ) 2NAg2\u00b52B \u2192  |%1\u3009 = | \u2191\u2191\u3009 |%2\u3009 = 1 \u221a 2 (| \u2191\u2193\u3009 + | \u2193\u2191\u3009)\n|%3\u3009 = | \u2193\u2193\u3009\n,\n(4)\n%4 = 1 \u2212 3%1(T )\u2192 vert%4\u3009 = 1 \u221a\n2 (| \u2191\u2193\u3009\u2212| \u2193\u2191\u3009) , (5)\nwhere NA is the Avogadro\u2019s number, g is the Lande\u0301 factor, \u00b5B is the Bohr magneton, and \u03c7 is the Bleaney-Bowers molar magnetic susceptibility [37, 41\u201345, 53\u201355] of the compound\n\u03c7(J,T ) = 2NA(g\u00b5B)2 kBT 1 3 + eJ/kBT . (6)\nFrom Eqs. (4) and (5) one can obtain the von Neumann entropy S = \u2212\u03a34i=1%i ln %i of the system, given by:\nS (J,T ) = \u2212F (J,T ) { e J kBT ln [1 \u2212 3F (J,T )] + 3 ln [F (J,T )] } ,\n(7)\nwhere F (J,T ) is the so-called dimensionless magnetic susceptibility [37], which is defined in terms of the BleaneyBowers equation:\nF (J,T ) = kBT\u03c7(J,T ) 2NA(g\u00b5B)2 = 1 3 + eJ/kBT . (8)\nIn particular, for dinuclear metal complexes, it is well known that its magnetic coupling can be handled by applying an external pressure [5, 39, 42, 45, 56\u201358]. Studying the magnetic properties of metal complexes when the compound are subjected to an external hydrostatic pressure is the main purpose of the high-pressure magnetometry area [57, 59, 60]. When a high pressure is applied to a metal complex, it is possible for changes to occur in the electron density, bonding, and crystal structure of the system [60]. As presented in ref. 42, the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation [61\u201363] relates the magneto-structural change in metal complexes with the pressure to which the substance is subjected. Thus, a hydrostatic pressure allows one to control the magnetic coupling, which then controls the degree of quantum correlations in low dimensional metal complexes [42]. Hence, one can manipulate the magnetic coupling (J) of the working substance during a thermodynamic process. Accordingly, the external pressure induces a change in the lattice parameter, and the bridging angles [39, 56\u201358]; and, as a consequence, the magnetic coupling constant can be handled, which allows the control of the energy levels. Therefore, this approach allows the investigation of the relationship between the structure and magnetic properties of metal complexes. In references [56, 57], the authors studied several copper dimers materials and analyzed the magnetic coupling constant as a function of the bridging angles. They found that a dependence of this constant with the metal-oxygen-metal angle in metal complexes, as below:\nJ/kB = 106\u03b8 \u2212 10387 [K] . (9)\nNote the critical angle that makes J = 0 is \u03b8 = 97.5o (see references 56 and 57).\nThe values of applied pressures to achieve such angles are of the order of GPa [42, 57], which are experimentally achieved using commercial diamond anvil cells. It can therefore be assumed that an antiparallel alignment of the spins is expected for \u03b8 > 97.5o, while a parallel alignment is expected for \u03b8 < 97.5o [57]. In other words, the coupling constant changes from positive (singlet state - EGS) to negative (triplet subspace - SGS) depending on the changing of the bridging angles. Thus, the magnetic coupling constant of the working substance can be handled during the isochoric processes by regulating the external pressure."

While Carnot and Otto cycles have been exhaustively studied in the past few years, a wide range of other cycles can be generalized for quantum\n3 working substances [23]. In particular, the Stirling cycle has attracted the attention of the scientific community as an alternative for the adiabatic cycles [15, 23, 24, 30\u201336]. The Stirling cycle is characterized by four main processes: (i) isothermal expansion, (ii) isochoric cooling, (iii) isothermal compression, and (iv) isochoric heating.\nThere is an ongoing debate about the best definition of work for microscopic quantum systems [64, 65]. Here we will use the most common definition [12, 13, 51] considering work as the (average) energy exchange due to external changes in the system\u2019s Hamiltonian. In this scenario, for spin systems this change can be achieved through varying an external magnetic field [24, 30], or the magnetic coupling J between the spins, as we will consider here.\nThus, the quasi-static quantum Stirling cycle can be implemented by two quantum isothermal and two quantum isochoric strokes. In this regard, the properties of the quasi-static quantum isochoric and isothermal processes are described below."

However, from Eq. (17), one can estimate the total work done by/on the system.

In a manner comparable to that of Figs. 2 and 4, figure (a) illustrates a working material that increases magnetic coupling during an expansion, while (b) decreases it. Therefore, the discrepancy between these two figures is because the same working material cannot simultaneously increase and reduce coupling owing to expansion/compression.\nthe amount of heat that is transferred between the isochoric strokes is equal to \u2206QBC + \u2206QDA = 0 along the curves, i.e., the heat that is given out during the isochoric cooling (B\u2192 C) is balanced out by the heat that is taken in during the isochoric heating (D\u2192 A).\nIn this regard, by controlling the ratio between the parameters of the cycle, one can change the sign of the total work of the cycle. Thus, from Eqs. (17), (15), and (16), one can illustrate the regions of operation for this quantum Stirling cycle in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics [25, 28].\n8 For the case Th > Tc the regions of operation of any thermodynamic cycle can be defined from the Clausius formulation of the second law of thermodynamics [25, 28, 29], as in Table I.\nHeat engine: absorbs heat from the hot bath at Th (Qin > 0) and releases it into the cold one at Tc (Qout > 0), converting part the heat flux between these two reservoirs in work done by the system (W > 0). The external work performed on the system in the isothermal compression is smaller than the work performed by the system in the isothermal expansion: WAB > WCD.\nRefrigerator: forces a heat flow from the cold bath at Tc to the hot one at Th; i.e, the working substance absorbs heat from the bath at Tc (Qout > 0) and releases it in the one Th(Qin < 0). For this mode, the work on the system is greater than the work performed by the system: WAB < WCD (W < 0), which induces a heat flow from the cold bath to the hot one.\nAccelerator: uses the work done on the system (W < 0) to enhances the heat flow from the bath at Th to the one at Tc (Qin > 0 and Qout < 0).\nHeater: uses the work performed on the system (W < 0) to induce heat flow in both baths, i.e., the working substance releases heat in both baths (Qin < 0 and (Qout < 0).\nFig. 7 illustrates the operating regions for a full quantum Stirling cycle in terms of the ratio of the heat baths temperatures (Th/Tc) and the magnetic couplings (JA/JB), calculated from the analytical versions of Eqs. (15), (16) and (17).\nThe four regions described above are represented in the JA/JB,Th/Tc plane, different from the results observed for the classical analogs and the magnetic version of the quantum cycle [24], where only the heat engine and refrigerator modes are found. Boundary lines separate the different operation regions; and crossing these boundaries means changing the sign of the respective energy exchange according to Table I. The most striking result which emerges from Fig. 7 is that the operation of a quantum Stirling cycle, based on a spin-1/2 dinuclear metal complex, can be tuned by the management of the ratio between different magnetic couplings (JA/JB) and the temperature of the thermal baths (Th/Tc). In particular, the ratio JA/JB leads to the control of the operational regime of the\nJA >0, JB>0JA <0, JB>0\nEngine Accelerator Refrigerator Heater Carnot Points W = 0\nJA >0, JB<0 JA <0, JB<0\nEngine Accelerator Refrigerator Heater Carnot Points W = 0\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 7.

The black dashed line is the boundary W = 0 of the positive work condition. The open circles represent the Carnot Points, in which the four operation modes coincide.

In a similar fashion as done in Figs. 2 and 4, figure (a) represents a working substance that increases the magnetic coupling during an expansion while (b) reduces it. Therefore, the difference between these two figures is due to the fact that the same working substance cannot increase and decrease coupling simultaneously due to expansion/compression.\ncycle through the management of the applied pressure during the isothermal compression.\nIn addition, any operation mode can be achieved regardless of the presence of an entangled ground state. However, the boundaries between the operation regions can be tuned by the parameters of the cycle. In this regard, turning to the positive\n9 work condition, the work done on the system to change the magnetic coupling from JA to JB in the isothermal expansion is greater than the work performed in the isothermal compression. This region becomes predominant as we increase the ratio between the couplings regardless of the ground state. In other words, for systems in which the coupling is reduced by applying an external pressure (JA > JB) [57], the predominant regime is the heat engine.\nOn the other hand, by analyzing the zero work curves, one can be seen that as the ratio between the temperatures of the cycle decreases, the curve reduces to a single point at Th/Tc = 1 where the four operation modes coincide. These points are also known as Carnot points, where all energy exchanged goes to zero (nothing happens) while the efficiency in the Heat Engine operation approaches the Carnot efficiency [25].\n\u03b7C = 1 \u2212 Tc Th . (18)\nAlternatively, in a system that does not meet positive working conditions, efficiency is no longer an important performance indicator [28]. Apart from the heat engine mode, the regions of accelerator, refrigerator and, heater (W < 0) are observed for lower values of the coupling ratio in Fig. 7. In particular, the refrigerator mode is only observed by reducing the ratio between the temperature of the thermal baths. This result is consistent with the fact that fixing the temperature of the hot reservoir (Th), extracting heat from the cold bath becomes harder as the temperature Tc increases. In this scenario, the work done in the isothermal compression will be greater than the work performed in the isothermal expansion.\nIn contrast, the fraction of the work done can induce a free flow of heat from the hot to the cold bath, which makes the system operate as an accelerator; or reject heat in both baths as a heater. Moreover, increasing the ratio Th/Tc in the negative work region lowers the heater operational mode. These results are consistent with the intuitive idea that fixing the temperature of the cold bath (Tc), damping heat in both reservoirs becomes difficult as we increase the temperature of the hot bath (Th), favoring the appearance of the accelerator region."

However, as reported in this paper, in the case of dinuclear spin-1/2 metal complexes, the heat exchanged, and the work performed in one complete cycle are expressed via the experimentally observed magnetic susceptibility of the system. In order to get some advance for the presented model in a practical point of view, we consider dinuclear hydroxo-bridged Cu(II) compound with formula: [Cu2(OH)2(bpy)2][BF4]2(bpy = 2,2\u2032- bipyridine). Reference 57 shows the experimental study of the magnetic susceptibilities through High-Pressure Magnetometry. The compound has a central metallic structure that comprises a diamond-like [Cu(II)2(OH)2] unit, composed of two Cu(II) ions bridged by two m-OH- ligands. For this particular class of compounds, the relationship seen between the Cu\u2013O\u2013Cu bridging angles and the degree of magnetic coupling are given by Eq. (9), which makes this system an experimental realization of the working substance described on Section II.\nBefore to the high-pressure experiment, the magnetic characteristics of the metal complex are determined at ambient pressure after its synthesis. The sample is then inserted in the gasket of a diamond anvil cell, which comprises of two opposing diamond anvils that can exert intense pressure on the sample by tightening the screws of the anvil [57, 59, 60]. After achieving the required pressure, the sample\u2019s magnetic characteristics are measured using a SQUID magnetometer [57, 59]. Finally, the magnetic measurement data is then examined to identify the influence of high pressure on the magnetic susceptibility of the metal complex [57].\nAs shown in reference 57, applying a hydrostatic pressure resulted in a considerable deformation and modification of the structure in this metal complex, which is reflected in a change in the magnetic coupling between metallic centers [57]. As pointed out in Section II, this fact is true, especially for bond distances and angles between the metallic center and the bridging ligands [39, 58]. In this scenario, structural changes manifest in the magnetic behavior of the complexes, as shown by the magnetic susceptibility measurements reported. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in the temperature range 20 \u2212 350 K in an applied static magnetic field of 1 kOe at ambient pressure and 0.84\nGPa [57]. The applied magnetic field is low enough to maintain the system at the regime of magnetic susceptibility in the system [37]. The susceptibility data were also described by the molar Bleaney-Bowers magnetic susceptibility, Eq. (6), where the authors fitted the magnetic coupling constants for each pressure applied. They found the coupling JA/kB = \u221242 K for an applied pressure of PA = 0.84 GPa, and JB/kB = \u221232 K for the ambient pressure (PB = 10\u22124 GPa), i.e., during an expansion process the system will increase the magnetic coupling (JB < JA). In order to use the experimental data in the Quantum Stirling Cycle model reported in this paper, the strokes have to be implemented as quasistatically as possible. However, since no time is involved in the quasi-static model, the static magnetic susceptibility measurements can be used to show that the proposed model is consistent with a real scenario. Each experimental point is obtained in the order of seconds; meanwhile, as pointed out in ref. [2, 50, 66, 67], the spin-spin relaxation times for such metal complexes are typical of order 1 \u223c 100 \u00b5s. Thus, the two baths are implemented considering the temperature of the magnetometer since the measurement time is far greater than the relaxation of the system itself.\nApplying the Quantum Stirling Cycle model reported in this paper, one can find, from the operation modes shown in Fig. 7, that this system can only operate as a heat engine, regardless of the temperature of the heat baths. Therefore, using the data reported in the reference 57, one can obtain the dimensionless magnetic susceptibility, Eq. (8), through the Bleaney-Bowers equation, Eq. (6). Thus, from Eqs. (15) - (17) and (19), one can obtain the energy exchanged, as well as the efficiency of the Quantum Stirling Heat engine from the magnetic susceptibility experimental data. Fig. 9 shows the experimental measurement of work output, heat absorbed, released, and efficiency in terms of the temperature of the hot reservoir, by fixing the temperature of the cold bath at 20 K - the lowest temperature measured in ref. 57.\nAs it can be seen in Fig. 9 (a), the theoretical curves are in agreement with the experimental points obtained from the magnetic susceptibility measurements as shown in ref. 57. This result corroborates the fact that static magnetometry data can be used in a quasi-static scenario, considering the time scale of the measurement and the spin-spin relaxation times. Furthermore, as anticipated in section III, the energy scale of the work output and the heat exchanged obtained from experimental data are in agreement with the results shown in Figs. 2- 6, considering the ratios between the magnetic couplings and the temperatures of the thermal baths. In addition, the work output, which is obtained in the order of 10\u22127 eV, as shown in Fig. 9 (a), is several orders of magnitude smaller than the energy scale of the system given by the magnetic couplings (in the order of 10\u22123 eV).\nTurning to the engine performance, as shown in Fig. 9 (b), as the temperature of the hot reservoir approaches the cold one, the measurement of the efficiency approaches the Carnot efficiency (dashed blue line), as expected for the quantum Stirling cycle [15, 24, 29] in agreement with the theoretical model (solid red line), also showed in Fig. 8. Therefore, the present results are significant in at least two major respects. First, it\n11\nshows a proof of concept for the theoretical model developed for the quantum Stirling cycle using a dinuclear metal com-\nplex as a working substance. In addition, the evaluation of the efficiency of the heat is experimentally accessible through the analytical results shown in this paper. Thus, by measuring a macroscopic property of the system, one can characterize the performance of a quantum heat engine."

            "text": "In summary, this work shows an implementation of a quantum Stirling cycle using the model of a spin-1/2 dinuclear metal complex as a working substance. The system operates between two heat baths with temperatures Th and Tc, regarding the hot and cold bath, respectively, and two magnetic couplings JA and JB, induced by the applying of an external hydrostatic pressure. This study has illustrated that four operation modes allowed by the second law of thermodynamics can be tuned by controlling the parameters of the cycle, such as the temperature of the thermal baths and the magnetic couplings of the working substance.\nOne of the more significant findings that emerges from this study is that the dimensionless magnetic susceptibility of the working substance could be used to characterize the performance of the Heat engine mode of the quantum Stirling cycle. This fact is experimentally shown through a proof of concept, where the susceptibility-based measurement of the efficiency is obtained from dinuclear hydroxo-bridged Cu(II) as a working substance. Thus, the data obtained from highpressure magnetometry experiments can be used to determine the work done, heat exchahed and the efficiency of the heat engine. Therefore, the presented model can provide insights for future research since it can be used in the application of d9 dinuclear metal complexes as working substances of quantum heat engines in terms of their operation modes, from experimental values of magnetic susceptibilities for different values of pressure.\nAlthough this study focuses on the quantum Stirling cycle, these findings may well have a bearing on solid-state caloric effects since metal complexes belong to the class of advanced materials explored for caloric applications. Thus, the presented theoretical results lay the groundwork for future research into the application of metal complexes as working substances of quantum heat engines toward the development of emerging quantum technologies based on these advanced materials."
