Network pharmacology methods such as target prediction, pathway identification, and network construction were used to determine the mechanism through which the D. officinale extract inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation. MTT assays, fluorescence confocal microscopy, clone formation, and flow cytometry were used to verify the inhibitory activity of the D. officinale extract on gastric cancer cell proliferation in vitro. The UPLC-MS/MS analysis identified 178 chemical components from the D. officinale extract. Network pharmacology analysis showed that 13 chemical components had the potential to inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, with the possible involvement of 119 targets and 20 potential signaling pathways. In vitro experiments confirmed that the D. officinale extract could significantly inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Therefore, we believe that the D. officinale extract can inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells through effects on multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways.",

Although the incidence of gastric cancer has decreased in recent years, it is still the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. The 5-year relative survival rate of patients with gastric cancer in most countries is still less than 30% (Chen et al., 2016). Global cancer statistics for 2018 indicate more than 1 million new cases of gastric cancer and an estimated 783,000 deaths (Bray et al., 2018).

Therefore, the development of new anti-gastric cancer drugs will be of great significance.\nIn contrast to the approach of Western medicine, Chinese medicine researchers generally believe that the multiple compounds in a Chinese herbal medicine can act on multiple various cell targets through different means, which achieves the therapeutic effects with fewer side effects and less drug resistance. According to preliminary studies, Chinese herbal medicine treatments can be helpful to maintain a reduced tumor size and alleviate tumor-related symptoms (Ling et al., 2014). In addition, studies have shown that Chinese herbal medicine alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy can improve the immunity and quality of life of patients with tumors (Liu et al., 2017; Xiao and Tao, 2017; Yang et al., 2019). However, the presence of multiple compounds in Chinese herbal medicine also leads to the complexity of its molecular mechanism. Consequently, revealing the mechanism of the multiple components of Chinese herbal medicines is of great significance in promoting the clinical application of Chinese herbal medicine in the field of antitumor research.\nD. officinale is a perennial herb belonging to the genus Dendrobium of the family Orchidaceae. As a traditional Chinese herbal medicine and health food, it has been used in China for thousands of years and offers great value for medicine development value and excellent application prospects. Existing studies have shown that D. officinale contains an abundance of diverse secondary metabolites, including polysaccharides, alkaloids, stilbenes (phenanthrenes, bibenzyls), sesquiterpenes, and flavonoids; these compounds, have broad-spectrum biological effects, enhance the immune function of the body (Li et al., 2020), and exert antitumor and adjuvant antitumor effects (Zhang et al., 2020). They are commonly used in the clinical adjuvant treatment of malignant tumors and provide a potential resources for the research and development of antitumor drugs.\nIn this study, we identified themain bioactive substances of the D. officinale extract. Through a series of network pharmacological analyses including target prediction and enrichment, pathway analysis, and network construction were carried out to determine\nthe potential mechanism of GC-related targets and the D. officinale extract. In addition, to confirm the inhibitory effect of the D. officinale extract on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, a series of cytological experiments including cell proliferation, monoclonal formation, and apoptosis were performed in three gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901, MGC803, and MKN-45. A schematic diagram of the network pharmacological analysis and overall experimental flow for the D. officinale extract in this study is shown in Figure 1. The results of our study not only proved the synergistic anticancer properties of the compounds in D. officinale extract but also provided further insight into the molecular mechanism through which the D. officinale extract inhibits the proliferation of GC cell."

Correlated with 16 cell types, the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm is the first. These proteins were related to 20 biological processes, with the largest association with apoptotic signaling pathway, positive regulation of cell death, cellular response to nitrogen compound, and response to drug (Supplementay Table S4).\nIn order to verify the correlation between the biological process involved in the target protein and the occurrence of gastric cancer, KEGG pathway analysis was performed for the target proteins (p < .01), and 20 signaling pathways were\nidentified (Figure 6B).

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We explored the molecular mechanism through which the D. officinale extract inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by network pharmacology. In this paper, a series of databases were used to screen the potential active substances of the D. officinale extract and identify their related targets. The protein interaction network identified the key proteins associated with the inhibition of gastric cancer proliferation by the D. officinale extract. The results showed that the D. officinale extract directly or indirectly interacted with eight key targets such as TP53, STAT3, JUN, MAPK3, EGFR, HRAS, MAPK8, and MAPK1, thus exerting anticancer effects.\nTP53 connects 35 nodes in the PPI network. Its main functions are to control cell-cycle progression, cell senescence, DNA repair, apoptosis, and the inhibition of angiogenesis. The inhibition of TP53 promotes the development of gastric cancer (Feng et al., 2019), which means that TP53 acts as a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer. EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that connects 22 nodes in the PPI network. The activation of EGFR may lead to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, thereby regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (Komposch and Sibilia, 2015). MAPK8, MAPK1, and MAPK3 are members of the MAPK family, and they are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, transformation, and apoptosis. JUN, MAPK8, MAPK1 and MAPK3 are signal proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway, and they are involved in the process of apoptosis (Li et al., 2021). Therefore, these proteins are the key targets of the D. officinale extract inhibiting gastric cancer cell proliferation.\nFIGURE 7 | Target-pathway network of the D. officinale extract. The red nodes represent the pathways, and the green nodes represent the targets. The size of the nodes is proportional to the degree of the node.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8321348\nThe main feature of cancerous cells is that they are immortalized without apoptosis. Screening assays for antitumor compounds in natural plants have revealed that the target substances have cytotoxic effects, that can directly kill cancer cells rather than through the induction of apoptosis (Hengartner, 2000). Screening for compounds that can induce apoptosis in tumor cells is conducive to reducing the toxicity of drugs and lead to better development prospect. In this paper, GO enrichment analysis and KEGGpathway analysis were performed, and it was found that the potential active components of the D. officinale extract could act on signaling pathways such as axon guidance and the MAPK signaling pathway. The activation of the caspase signal transduction\npathway can play an anticancer role by inducing SGC-7901 cell apoptosis.\nMembers of the caspase family of proteins play an important role in the regulation of apoptosis (McIlwain et al., 2013; Wnek et al., 2017; Van Opdenbosch and Lamkanfi, 2019). Bcl-2 family members are important regulators of the endogenous pathway of mitochondrial initiation. Based on their regulatory function, proteins in the Bcl-2 family are divided into two categories, antiapoptotic and apoptotic. The anti-apoptotic members include Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1 and apoptotic members include Bak and Bax. Bcl-2 family members form dimers, which interact with each other, affecting the permeability of\nFIGURE 9 | D. officinale extract exhibited anti-cancer effects in SGC-7901, MGC-803, and MKN-45 cells.
