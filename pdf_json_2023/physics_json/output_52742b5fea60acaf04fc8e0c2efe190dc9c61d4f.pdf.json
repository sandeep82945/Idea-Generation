            "text": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development and progression of a variety of malignant tumors including glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most lethal malignancies with a median survival of approximately 16 months.1 Novel anti-tumor therapies that target the ATP-binding site of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR have become popular and have resulted in the development of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with some demonstrating signicant clinical efficacy in EGFR mutant lung cancer.2 By contrast, in GBM, rst- and second-generation EGFR TKIs have failed to improve outcomes for these patients.3 Their limited efficacy is largely attributed to the presence of a physical barrier \u2013 the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) \u2013 which precludes the delivery of more than 98% of all therapeutics.4 To achieve therapeutic efficacy in GBM, BBB permeability is considered an essential property to maximize patient benet and clinical outcome.\nPositron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging provides a unique opportunity to non-invasively study disease and has contributed a key role in accelerating drug development, particularly in the elds of neurology and oncology.5 The availability of a radiolabeled isotopologue of the small molecule drug candidate in the early stage of CNS drug development can\nPharmacology, David Geffen School of les, CA, 90095, USA id Geffen School of Medicine, University of mail: jmmurphy@mednet.ucla.edu tion (ESI) available.

The structural modications of JCN037 and ERAS-801, relative to TKIs erlotinib and lapatinb, resulted in considerably improved potency and BBB penetration. Superior efficacy was demonstrated in a GBM orthotopic patient-derived xenogra model (GliomaPDOX) where JCN037 was shown to signicantly extend the survival of EGFR-altered, tumor-bearing mice.14a Notably, ERAS-801 which contains an N-methylpiperazine moiety is currently being investigated in phase I clinical trials for treatment of patients with GBM (NCT05222802).\nWe rationalized that a PET tracer for these TKIs could enable noninvasive measurements of drug biodistribution and accumulation and, importantly, inform on BBB penetration, providing key data largely responsible for the predictive measure of therapeutic efficacy and success. In this work, we report the synthesis and in vivo biodistribution of uorine-18 isotopologues of JCN037 and ERAS-801, namely 18F-JCN037 and 18F-ERAS-801 (Fig. 1). To avoid differences in their in vivo behavior, the radiotracer and the parent compound have exactly the same chemical structure and, as a result, identical biodistribution, affinity, lipophilicity, polar surface area, etc. Additionally, in vivo imaging was conducted in EGFR-altered GliomaPDOX to evaluate target expression and accumulation of 18F-ERAS-801 in EGFR-driven tumors. We anticipate this novel radiotracer could provide unique insights into the intratumoral drug distribution in the brain for EGFR-driven GBM tumors and facilitate clinical development.\n13826 | Chem.

            "text": "Construction of these radiotracers was envisioned to arise from the conventional SNAr between aniline\n18F-2 and the 4-chloroquinazoline pharmacophore 3 to forge the key carbon\u2013 nitrogen bond (Scheme 1). The 4-chloroquinazoline core for 18FJCN037 and 18F-ERAS-801 could be synthesized following literature protocol; thus, to achieve our goal, the critical synthetic step would be generation of radiolabeled aniline 18F-2.14\nA particularly noteworthy characteristic of 18F-2 is that it exhibits a sterically hindered ortho-disubstituted [18F]uoroaryl moiety which is a considerable synthetic challenge. Radiolabeling methodologies that tolerate bulky substituents ortho to the reactive site are limited with few examples of ortho-disubstituted [18F]uoroarenes in the literature.15 We have previously reported the nucleophilic radiouorination of N-arylsydnones which facilitates large ortho-substitution and readily affords [18F]uoroarenes in high yields.16 Utilizing this methodology, we proposed to generate 18F-2 via radiouorination of the corresponding sydnone 1 followed by Pd-catalyzed reduction (Scheme 1).\nFirst, we began our synthetic strategy with preparation of 2- bromo-6-nitrophenyl sydnone precursor 1 as shown in Scheme 2. Formation of the N-aryl glycine 5 was accomplished in 79% yield via SNAr with bromo-2-uoro-3-nitrobenzene 4. The N-aryl glycine was converted to the corresponding nitrosamine with tbutyl nitrate followed by cyclodehydration to form the sydnone 1 in 72% yield from 5.\nWe initially evaluated various conditions for radiouorination of precursor 1 directly on an automated radiosynthesis module (Table S1\u2020). Given the strong activating nature of the ortho-nitro substituent towards SNAr, conversion of precursor 1 to 18F-4 was nearly quantitative aer 10 min at 70 \u00b0C (Table 1). Investigation of lower temperatures revealed that the radiouorination proceeded efficiently at 30 \u00b0C in 8 min to cleanly afford the desired nitrobenzene 18F-4 in 97% RCY.\nWe next sought to prepare aniline 18F-2. Formation of 18F-2 proceeded in 48% RCY upon the reduction of 18F-4 in methanol with NaBH4 in the presence of Pd/C at ambient temperature for 5 min (Table 2, entry 1). We rst focused on the amounts of Pd/ C and NaBH4, keeping a consistent ratio of around 2- to 3-fold excess reducing agent over transition metal (Table 2, entries 1\u2013 4). Lowering the mass amount of NaBH4 provided cleaner HPLC traces with less side product formation. Signicantly lowering the mass of palladium was unproductive and completely suppressed the reduction (see Table 2, entry 4).\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Further renement continued to improve the conversion and generate 18F-2 in 85% RCY within 2.5 min (Table 2, entry 9).\nWith aniline 18F-2 in hand, we focused on the substitution reaction with 4-chloroquinazoline 3a to produce 18F-JCN037 and rigorous screening was conducted. Initially, we used crude 18F-2, without further purication, and found that the addition of 3a into the reaction vial in two equal portions, with the second portion being added aer 15 min, revealed greater consumption of 18F-2 and increased product formation (Table S6\u2020). Therefore, a two-part addition of 3a was continued throughout the optimization process. Product formation was observed in 41% RCY upon treatment of crude 18F-2with 1.3mg of 3a in IPA at 95 \u00b0C for 20 min (Table 3, entry 1). Screening solvents revealed IPA to be superior and increasing the mass amount of 4-chloroquinazoline 3a yielded slightly higher RCYs (Table 3, entries 2\u20135).\nIntermediate HPLC purication of 18F-2 was briey investigated, generating 18F-JCN037 in 95% RCY albeit adding excessive time constraints to the overall process (Table S7\u2020). Alternatively, to avoid the lengthy HPLC purication, C18 SepPak cartridge purication of 18F-2 was pursued. In IPA, 18FJCN037 was generated in 76% RCY upon treatment of cartridgepuried 18F-2 with 5.0 mg of 3a in IPA at 95 \u00b0C for 30 min (Table 3, entry 7). When this step was translated to an automated radiosynthesis module, the moderate solubility of 4- chloroquinazoline 3a in IPA created an unsatisfactory heterogeneous reagent mixture. Alternatively, solubility of 3a in acetonitrile enabled the consistent and complete addition of\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 13825\u201313831 | 13827\nFig. 2 (A) Radiosynthesis of 18F-JCN037.

The radiouorination and substitution steps as well as the intermediate cartridge purications were fully automated. The reduction step was conducted under inert atmosphere; as such, intermediate 18F-4 was pushed into a sealed vial equipped with an argon balloon, situated on a stir plate next to the radiochemical synthesis module (Fig. S8\u2020). Following the reduction, the vial was manually unscrewed and placed back into the ELIXYS for the completion of the automated synthesis.

Remarkably, the in vivo biodistribution of 18F-ERAS801 in a SD rat revealed a slow initial uptake of the radiotracer in the rat brain, with a SUVmean value of 0.33 at 2 h p.i., followed by a long retention time of activity in the brain at 4 h p.i. (Fig. 3C).\nEncouraged by the signicantly improved pharmacokinetic properties and brain retention of 18F-ERAS-801, microPET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in mice with GliomaPDOX tumors implanted in the brain to assess targeting and sensitivity (Fig. 4). In parallel, non-tumor bearing NSG mice were evaluated as a control group. To better visualize the brain anatomy and the implanted glioblastoma, MRI was performed in addition to PET and CT due to its superior so tissue contrast (Fig. 4A). The PET signal is signicantly higher in the whole-brain of the tumor-bearing mice compared to the whole-brain of the healthy control mice (Fig. 4B). Aer 1 hour tracer uptake, 18F-ERAS-801 displayed 1.7-fold higher PET signal in tumor tissue than healthy brain tissue, with relatively high retention in the tumor over the next three hours (Fig. 4C). Notably, at the 4-hour time point, 18F-ERAS-801 accumulation was nearly 3-fold higher than tracer signal in the healthy tissue of the corresponding brain, conrming target specicity (Fig. 4C).\nThe greater uptake of 18F-ERAS-801 in the brain suggests that ERAS-801 may overcome the poor BBB penetrating properties of other EGFR TKIs that have been tested and failed in GBM. It remains to be determined if these improved properties of ERAS801 will translate into a clinical benet for GBM patients. However, the improved outcomes for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with brain metastasis treated with the CNS penetrant EGFR TKI Tagrisso20 suggests that higher brain exposures of an EGFR TKI can be effective and non-toxic in the brain."

            "text": "In summary, we have developed two PET tracers, 18F-JCN037 and 18F-ERAS-801, that are uorine-18 isotopologues of JCN037 and its clinical derivative ERAS-801, recently developed TKIs against EGFR-driven GBM. PET imaging studies of these tracers enabled noninvasive, whole-body pharmacological measurements including brain accumulation and retention, valuable data for CNS drug development. The synthesis of 18F-ERAS-801 was fully automated on a commercial radiosynthesis module in 8 \u00b1 2% activity yield. PET imaging studies of 18F-ERAS-801 conrmed BBB penetration and, importantly, provided insights into the intratumoral drug distribution in the brain for EGFRdriven GBM tumors.\nPET tracers that can validate tumor engagement during preclinical drug development, visualize and quantify EGFR expression in vivo, differentiate between EGFR mutational statuses, and potentially predict patients' response to TKI treatment are of great interest. PET imaging was recently reported to enable precise quantication of EGFRmutation status in NSCLC patients and improve overall patient management and care.8c The benecial role of 18F-ERAS-801 to provide this type of predictive information for the clinical assessment of\n13830 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 13825\u201313831\nERAS-801 treatment remains to be seen and additional studies are ongoing to validate this potential value."
