1. **Investigate the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automate the knowledge elicitation process.** NLP techniques could be used to extract the relevant information from domain experts' explanations and automatically generate the symbolic primitives and parameters. This would further reduce the time and effort required to develop knowledge-based systems.


2. **Explore the use of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the knowledge elicitation process.** Machine learning techniques could be used to learn the relationships between the symbolic primitives and the fault conditions, and to identify the most important features for fault detection. This would help to ensure that the knowledge-based system is as accurate and efficient as possible.


3. **Develop a methodology for evaluating the quality of knowledge-based systems developed using the proposed approach.** This methodology would help to ensure that the knowledge-based systems are accurate, reliable, and effective. It would also help to identify areas where the knowledge-based systems can be improved.


4. **Investigate the use of the proposed approach to develop knowledge-based systems for other types of problems.** The proposed approach could be used to develop knowledge-based systems for a wide range of problems, such as medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, and manufacturing quality control. This would help to demonstrate the generality and applicability of the approach.


5. **Develop a software tool to support the development of knowledge-based systems using the proposed approach.** This tool would provide a user-friendly interface for eliciting knowledge from domain experts, generating symbolic primitives and parameters, and developing the knowledge-based system. This would make it easier for engineers and other non-experts to develop knowledge-based systems.
