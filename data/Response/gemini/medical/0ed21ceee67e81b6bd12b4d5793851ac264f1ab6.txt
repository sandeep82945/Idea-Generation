1. **Investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological strategies for managing migraine, such as physical strategies (massage, acupuncture, and exercise), psychological strategies (yoga, rest, and psychotherapy), and self-initiated strategies (doing nothing, diet change, and dietary supplements).** This research could help to establish evidence to support the use of these strategies and update guidelines for the management of migraine.


2. **Explore the differences in migraine management between males and females.** This research could help to identify specific treatments that are effective for women with migraine, who are more likely to experience the condition than men.


3. **Examine the impact of COVID-19 on migraine prevalence and management.** This research could help to identify ways to support people with migraine during the pandemic and in the future.


4. **Investigate the misuse of over-the-counter (OTC) medications for migraine.** This research could help to identify ways to prevent misuse and ensure that people with migraine are taking the recommended doses of OTC medications.


5. **Develop and evaluate interventions to improve the diagnosis and treatment of migraine.** This research could help to reduce the burden of migraine and improve the quality of life for people with the condition.
