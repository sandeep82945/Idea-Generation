    "abstractText": "Sperm maturation in the epididymis is based on interactions with proteins from epididymal fluid (EF). The aim of the study was to profile canine EF proteome and investigate correlations between EF protein content and epididymal spermatozoa (ES) motion parameters. Twenty-three male dogs were divided into two groups: good sperm motility (GSM) and poor sperm motility (PSM). The total motility and progressive motility differed significantly (p = 0.031; p < 0.001, respectively) between the GSM group and the PSM group. The semen samples were centrifuged to separate the EF apart from the ES. The canine EF proteins were analyzed using nano-liquid chromatography, which was coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (NanoUPLC-Q-TOF/MS) and bioinformatic tools for the first time. A total of 915 proteins were identified (GSM\u2014506; PSM\u2014409, respectively). UniProt identification resulted in six unique proteins (UPs) in the GSM group of dogs and four UPs in the PSM group. A semi-quantitative analysis showed a higher abundance (p < 0.05) of four differentially expressed proteins in the GSM group (ALB, CRISP2, LCNL1, PTGDS). Motility-dependent variations were detected in the EF proteome and were related to important metabolic pathways, which might suggest that several proteins could be potential ES motility biomarkers.",

            "text": "The essential role of the epididymis in male fertility has been described extensively [1\u20133]. As sperm passes through the epididymis, it undergoes a maturation process that is characterized by morphological and physiological modifications necessary to obtain full capacity for fertilization. These modifications comprise changes in the biochemical composition of plasmalemma, including the addition, removal, or transformation of proteins and lipids, as well as final chromatin condensation and the acquisition of functional features, such as progressive motility [4,5]. This functional epididymal sperm (ES) maturation occurs in response to modifications in the epididymal fluid (EF) microenvironment [6]. The ES surface during transit along the epididymis is directly exposed to an epididymal milieu rich in numerous proteins, which may interact with the sperm in a specific manner [4,7]. This may have an impact on the functional features of the male reproductive cells [8]. Epididymal fluid proteins are thought to have a significant role in the subsequent steps leading to acquiring the ES functional capability for fertilization [9]. The mammalian spermatozoa leaving the testicles are immobile. In order to reach the oocyte, the sperm must be able to move progressively forward. Therefore, motility is a significant functional sperm parameter in both natural and assisted reproduction. Of all known semen quality parameters, sperm motility is considered to be a highly predictive\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14790. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241914790 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14790 2 of 19\nmarker of male fertility [10]. The sperm acquire this property gradually while they pass through the epididymal tract. Considering that approximately 17.5% of couples worldwide face fertility problems [11], as well as the development of animal husbandry and the breeders\u2019 attitude towards reproductive success, it seems advisable to understand the mechanisms of sperm motility regulation by molecules present in EF. A complete profiling of proteins present in a tissue or a cell is defined as proteomics [12]. Currently, this field of science is commonly used and has promising potential in animal reproduction research. The detection and identification of proteins found in EF may reveal unknown interactions between the components of these fluids and the sperm, which may affect the functional features of male gametes. Identification of the sperm motilitymodulating proteins may be used in biomedical applications in strategies of infertility treatment, semen assessment, and conservation centers, both in animals and humans [13]. The development of a procedure for the identification of protein markers, which proves the quality of semen and its usefulness for reproduction on a dog model, would allow for the expansion of knowledge, not only in the aspect of dog breeding and preservation of endangered canine species but also in the field of human reproduction. Taking into consideration that the epididymis provides a unique environment in which sperm acquire the fertilizing ability [7], it was decided to: (i) Provide profiling of the canine EF proteome; (ii) Investigate correlations between cauda EF proteins and selected ES motion parameters in the search for protein markers of ES motility."

Discussion Proteins found in EF are known to exert an important influence on sperm function and metabolism [1,14\u201317]. Each epididymal segment is considered an individual \u201corgan\u201d and creates its unique microenvironment, with its own genes, regulatory proteins, and signal transduction pathways [18]. As part of the search for protein markers of epididymal semen quality, our goal was to check whether some proteins present in the dog\u2019s EF may be related to the quality of spermatozoa present in this fluid as measured by the motion parameters. The study demonstrated that certain proteins were associated with an EF surrounding ES exhibiting good motility parameters, while another group of proteins was found to be indicative of the EF of ES with poor motility. Proteins unique to the EF of the GSM group may potentially exert a specific positive influence on sperm motion parameters, as shown in the current study. Some UPs found in the canine EF in which spermatozoa were showing poor motion parameters may exert an inhibitory effect on sperm motility. The exact mechanism of this action is specific for each protein and must be discussed\nFigure 7.

Proteins unique to the EF of the GSM group may potentially exert a specific positive influence on sperm motion parameters, as shown in the current study. Some UPs found in the canine EF in which spermatozoa were showing poor motion parameters may exert an inhibitory effect on sperm motility. The exact mechanism of this action is specific for each protein and must be discussed separately. However, we cannot rule out that there are functional relationships between some proteins, which was shown in the PPI network. In the study, proteome profiling of the canine EF was performed using NanoUPLCQ-TOF/MS for the first time. There are no such reports in world literature, only EF mass spectrometry research in humans [19], boars [20], bulls [21\u201324], rams [25,26], and monkeys [27].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14790 10 of 19\nIn the analyzed groups of semen differing in motility, it was found that the EF homologous with sperm of good motility possesses some UPs, such as ACTB, ALPL, CARD6, CLU, GALNT6, and OLFM4, which are important for the ES metabolism. ACTB builds the cytoskeleton, flagellar, and acrosomal membrane of spermatozoa [28,29]. It is responsible for cell volume changes, and its role was proposed in sperm capacitation and motility [28\u201330]. ACTB was previously found in the canine ES, and its expression was correlated with the dog\u2019s age [31]. It seems to be a part of the ES structure, but a high abundance of it was found in the EF of the GSM group. The exact mechanism of the EF ACTB influence on ES motility needs to be evaluated in the future. In dogs, most ALPL is produced in the epididymis [32]. Alkaline phosphatase appears in very high concentrations in canines [33] EF. It plays a role in the transport of sugars and other organic molecules across biological membranes [34]. Its activity has been demonstrated in cytoplasmic droplets, which raises the hypothesis that ALPL catalyzes dephosphorylation and transport of phosphate groups between the ES and EF. The source of the presence of this enzyme in EF could be the intense release of it from the cytoplasmic droplets during the maturation of the ES in the epididymis. Immune response, cell proliferation, and apoptosis are controlled by proteins containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) [35]. CARD6 may be involved in microtubular transport mechanisms. Accordingly, proteins that interact with CARD6 may be targeted to the microtubule-organizing center, resulting in either their inactivation or translocation to a site where they can perform their functions [36]. This protein was found in the canine EF for the first time, and its function in the canine reproductive processes is unknown. CLU is an extracellular chaperone secreted in high amounts by epididymides [37] and testes [38]. Its presence in the canine ES was established in an earlier study [31]. It participates in sperm maturation by membrane remodeling, takes part in DNA reparation, and it may inhibit cell apoptosis [39]. It could be hypothesized that CLU might be adsorbed from the EF and cover ES plasma membranes while somehow positively influencing ES motility. Currently, GALNTL was found in male reproductive organs in rodents and cattle [40\u201343]. A KEGG pathway analysis indicated that GALNT6 participates in mucin-type-O-glycan biosynthesis in the canine ES [31]. GALNTL5 was localized in the head\u2013tail coupling apparatus of cauda ES in mice [42], and the expression of GALNTL5 was positively correlated with sperm motility [44]. In this study, we showed that GALNT6 is also important for ES motility in canines. OLFM4 is a glycoprotein for which the absence of gene expression has been shown in human prostate cancer [45,46]. Olfactomedins play essential roles in cell development and differentiation [47]. Olfactomedin-4 precursor was found in human epididymosomes [48]. The role of OLFM4 in ES physiology is unknown, along with its influence on the abovementioned reproductive cell motility. Summarizing, it may be hypothesized that the above-mentioned EF proteins exert their essential impact on the ES good motility by participating in sperm cell differentiation, sperm membrane remodeling, and regulating sperm motility. In EF homologous with poor motility of ES, the following proteins were found to be unique: BOLL, LOC606925, LOC607874, and WAPdcp. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including BOLL, are a group of proteins capable of regulating a plethora of cellular posttranscriptional processes, the perturbation of which leads to impaired spermatogenesis [49]. A reduced number of BOLL mRNA transcripts is associated with spermatogenic failure [50,51]. The presence of BOLL in the EF of the canine was shown for the first time in this study. It might be suggested that it was released into the EF from immature sperm or sperm with impaired spermatogenesis, resulting in reduced sperm motility. LOC606925 is a protein containing a Krueppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. It was found in about one-third of eukaryotic Krueppel-type C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) [52]. The members of the KRAB\u2013ZFPs family are involved in processes including apoptosis,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14790 11 of 19\ncell proliferation, and tumorigenesis [52]. It has been reported that they are abundantly expressed in the testicles [53,54]. Although this protein might also be released from the ES into the EF milieu, its function and influence on sperm motility have not been determined. LOC607874 is a cystatin-C-like protein, the content of which was associated with ageing of the canine epididymis [31]. The gene connected with this protein is specific for epididymis [55]. Considering that the presence of LOC607874 has been shown both in the canine ES of old dogs and in the EF with poor sperm motility, this protein might be considered in the future to be a poor epididymal semen quality marker. Most regions of the canine epididymis show mRNA expression for WAPdcp [56]. Considering that it possesses serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity [57], it might be suggested to act as a serine-protease inhibitor specific for canine epididymis. This protein was found in the canine ES membrane [58] and in the EF, which might suggest that it was bound to the sperm plasma membrane or released from spermatozoa to the EF. WAPdcp was found in ES of very young or old dogs [31]. According to the above-mentioned information, we could hypothesize that BOLL, LOC606925, LOC607874, and WAPdcp might be released from dead or impaired spermatozoa to the EF milieu and, due to this fact, were found to be characteristic of lower-quality epididymal semen. The study showed that 11 proteins were present in both types of dogs EF (GSM and PSM): AFP, ALB, CES5A, CRISP2, ELSPBP1, GPX5, LCNL1, LTF, NPC2, PLS3, and PTGDS. Four of them were selected based on statistical analysis, which showed content variability depending on the motility group. The content of ALB, CRISP2, LCNL1, and PTGDS was higher in the EF surrounding ES with good motility. The presence of ALB, CRISP2, and PTGDS in the canine cauda EF was confirmed by WB analysis. However, statistical differences between analyzed groups were shown only for ALB and PTGDS. CRISP2 is a cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family member found in the authors\u2019 previous study of the canine ES [31]. CRISP2 was identified in spermatids [59,60] and in the ejaculated sperm acrosome and sperm tail [61\u201364]. A decrease in CRISP2 amounts in the sperm is associated with male infertility [65\u201367]. This fact corresponds with the authors\u2019 recent study in which this protein content in the canine ES cells was lower in very young and senile dogs [31]. LCNL1 is a member of the lipocalin family. These proteins transport or store small molecules, such as vitamins, hormones, and secondary metabolites [68]. LCN proteins are hypothesized to be important for sperm maturation [69]. LCNL1 was expressed in different regions of the epididymis [70]. Epididymal fluid LCNL1 seems to be somehow important for ES sperm motility, but the exact mechanism needs to be investigated. Albumins are low-molecular weight proteins (about 65 kDa) [71], which are secreted by the testes, epididymides, and prostate. Studies have shown that albumins are implicated in the fertilization-associated events, such as sperm capacitation [72] and the zona pellucida penetration [73]. In one of our previous studies, we have shown that the seminal plasma albumin (ALB) is highly correlated with the motility parameters of stallion spermatozoa [74]. Moreover, albumins have been shown to regulate the number of bivalent cations and possess antioxidant properties [75,76]. It could be suggested that the binding of albumins to the ES plasma membrane might play a protective role in sperm motility [74]. It is likely that the albumins, analyzed in the current study, could have a potential effect on the ES motility by another mechanism in which zinc ions might play a significant role. It has been demonstrated that albumins have a strong affinity for zinc ions, thus reducing their concentrations in spermatozoa [74]. Such a mechanism has been shown to enhance sperm motility [74], and we suggest that a similar mechanism could be responsible for improved ES motility, as shown in the current study. The presence of PTGDS (prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, also known as prostaglandinD2-synthase, or lipocalin-type prostaglandin-D-synthase [77]) was found in the EF and seminal plasma of rams [26] and cats [78]. It is an enzyme that converts the cyclooxygenase product of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). It binds small\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14790 12 of 19\nnon-substrate lipophilic molecules such as retinoids [79], which affect the permeability of the plasma membrane, resulting in a greater input of ions from the outside [80]. This phenomenon may be related to the regulation of access of Ca2+ ions to the sperm cell, which might be related to sperm motility [1,81]. Intracellular retinol content was shown to positively correlate with sperm motility in humans [82]. A positive correlation between PTGDS content in human sperm and the cells progressive motility was shown [83]. Additionally, PPI networks have revealed that PTGDS is interconnected with several other essential proteins involved in sperm metabolism such as CRISP2, LCNL1, and SERPING1. However, the exact function of PTGDS in ES metabolism is unknown and requires further study. A broad-range proteomic study revealed that ALB and PTGDS present with greater abundance in EF surrounding sperm with good motility, with high probability are important for the good ES motility. As immature spermatozoa pass through the epididymis tracts, there is a process of mixing between the EF and the ES, allowing for contact between the substances present in them. The influence of the analyzed proteins on ES mobility should be considered in two aspects. Firstly, the degree of release of proteins from the ES during their maturation or from damaged or immature spermatozoa is important. Secondly, the ES motility might be influenced by secretory proteins produced by the epididymal tissue, which will coat ES and provide changes in the ES surface properties, biochemistry, and metabolism. This metabolically complex environment of the sperm functioning in the epididymis is still a mystery to scientists."
