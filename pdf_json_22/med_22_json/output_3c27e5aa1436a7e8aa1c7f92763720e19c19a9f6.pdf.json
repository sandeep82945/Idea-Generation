In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose depletion triggers a redistribution of TORC1 from a dispersed localization over the vacuole surface into a large, inactive condensate called TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domains). However, the mechanisms governing this transition have been unclear. Here, we show that acute depletion and repletion of EGO complex (EGOC) activity is sufficient to control TOROID distribution, independently of other nutrient-signaling pathways. The 3.9-\u00c5-resolution structure of TORC1 from TOROID cryo-EM data together with interrogation of key interactions in vivo provide structural insights into TORC1-TORC1\u2032 and TORC1-EGOC interaction interfaces. These data support a model in which glucose-dependent activation of EGOC triggers binding to TORC1 at an interface required for TOROID assembly, preventing TORC1 polymerization and promoting release of active TORC1.\nThe target of rapamycin (TOR) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase and a member of the phosphatidylinositol kinase-related protein kinase family1. TOR functions as the catalytic subunit of distinct multiprotein complexes, rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 and rapamycin-insensitive TORC2. Both are broadly conserved across eukaryotes, functioning as essential regulators of cell homeostasis2,3. In yeast, TORC1 controls cell mass and volume according to nutrient availabilities and abiotic stresses, whereas TORC2 maintains biophysical properties of the plasma membrane4,5.\nYeast TORC1 is composed of either of the two TOR paralogs Tor1 or Tor2, in addition to Kog1, Lst8 and the yeast-specific subunit Tco89 (refs. 6,7). In humans, mTORC1 (mammalian TORC1) contains mTOR, Raptor and mLst8. TORC1 phosphorylates the AGC-family kinase Sch9, which serves as a reporter of TORC1 activity in the presence of good nutrient sources and inhibition upon nutrient deprivation as well as exposure to osmotic, redox or thermal stresses8.\nTORC1 effectors regulate a plethora of molecular processes ranging from ribosome biogenesis to autophagy and from lipid biosynthesis to membrane trafficking9\u201312. mTORC1 is also regulated downstream of growth-factor signaling and phosphorylates the AGC-family kinase S6K1. Compromised mTORC1 regulation has been implicated in several illnesses including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders13.\nX-ray crystallography and cryo-EM14\u201316 studies have demonstrated that mTORC1 is dimeric and elucidated how rapamycin recruits the proline isomerase FKBP12 to sterically occlude the kinase active site. Multiple GTPases regulate mTORC1 activity. The Rheb GTPase couples growth-factor and energy cues to mTORC1, with binding of GTP-loaded Rheb leading to allosteric rearrangements that increase kinase activity of mTORC1 (ref. 16). The role of RAG GTPases, downstream of nutrient cues, is more nuanced. There are two sets of RAG paralogues, RAGA/B, and RAGC/D. They form obligate heterodimers,\nReceived: 7 January 2022\nAccepted: 21 November 2022"

            "text": "EGOC activity change affects TOROID independently of glucose Based on phenotypes of \u0394gtr1 \u0394gtr2 cells, and cells expressing GTP/GDP-locked Gtr1/2, we previously proposed that TOROID regulation downstream of glucose cues was mediated via the EGOC27. However, glucose signals also regulate TORC1 activity via additional, parallel pathways including Snf1/AMPK and pH34,35. Therefore, we wished to determine whether orthogonal, glucose-independent manipulation of EGOC function alone would alter TOROID dynamics.\nTo rapidly inactivate EGOC, we introduced a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site into the N-terminal region of Ego1, downstream of the lipidation sites (Ego1TEV; Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a)28,36. TEV protease was expressed downstream of the CTH2 promoter, whose tight repression by Fe2+ is quickly reversed by addition of the iron chelator bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid (BPS)37. Neither acute BPS treatment nor TEV protease induction affected TORC1 activity in otherwise wild-type (WT) cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b).\nAlthough the EGO1TEV allele does not display a phenotype, expression of the TEV protease renders these cells hypersensitive to rapamycin (Extended Data Fig. 1c)25,38. In EGO1TEV cells, TEV expression diminishes the EGOC vacuolar localization by 50% after 30 min, and almost completely after 75 min (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Shaving EGOC from the vacuolar membrane doubled the number of cells presenting TOROIDs after ~60 min (Fig. 1c,d). Single-cell measurements estimated the half-time of TOROID formation following EGOC depletion to be about 7 min (Fig. 1e,f).\nTo rapidly reactivate EGOC, we exploited the vacuole fusion that occurs during zygote formation39. We crossed a MATa \u0394gtr1 \u0394gtr2 strain, which constitutively displays a TOROID marked with GFP-Tor1, with a MAT\u03b1 partner containing Vph1-mCherry to delineate the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 1g); a MAT\u03b1 \u0394gtr1 \u0394gtr2 VPH1-mCherry strain served as a control. Budding zygotes were staged as either early, intermediate or late (Fig. 1g). In crosses between \u0394gtr1 \u0394gtr2 parents, a TOROID was detected in about 50% of buds and in some MAT\u03b1 parents already at the intermediate zygote stage (Fig. 1g,h). This was not observed in crosses with the GTR1 GTR2 partner. In this case, TORC1 puncta were observed in only very few buds and at late stages even disappeared from the MATa parent (Fig. 1h). In live, single-cell imaging, TOROIDs from this mating were observed to dissolve promptly upon entry into the bud, that is, upon encounter with functional EGOC (half-time ~2.5 min; Fig. 1i,j).\nThese data indicate that acute loss or reestablishment of EGOC activity, in the absence of other confounding nutrient-regulated pathways, is sufficient to respectively assemble or dissolve TOROIDs. This supports the notion that the EGOC regulates TOROID formation, potentially through a previously described physical interaction with TORC1 (refs. 25,40) and/or TOROIDs.\nTOROIDs partially colocalize with EGOC puncta We assessed how EGOC and TORC1/TOROIDs localize with respect to one another. TORC1 (GFP-TOR1) and EGOC (EGO3-3xmCherry) have been reported to colocalize in discrete puncta41,42. However, in this background these alleles displayed a synthetic interaction, as TORC1 puncta are present even in glucose-replete conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Importantly, when assessed separately, both TORC1 (GFP-KOG1) and the EGOC (EGO3-GFP) localized diffusely around the vacuole membrane in glucose-replete cells but collapsed into a punctum within 10 min of acute glucose depletion. Both puncta dissolved again within minutes of glucose replenishment (Fig. 2a,b).\nThe GFP-KOG1 EGO3-3xmCherry strain was relatively uncompromised, with levels of TOROIDs in glucose-replete and postdiauxic shift (PDS) cultures close to those seen in singly tagged strains (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). In PDS cultures, colocalization between TORC1 and EGOC was moderate (Pearson\u2019s coefficient (PC): 0.44; Extended Data Fig. 2b) and asymmetric; whereas EGOC overlapped strongly with\nwith GTP-loading status determining the distance and relative orientation between the two G-domains17,18. The RAGs are anchored to the lysosome membrane via the heteropentameric Ragulator complex19\u201321. Recent structures of the Raptor\u2013RAG\u2013Ragulator complex suggest that active RagAGTP\u2013RagCGDP is able to bind the Armadillo domain of Raptor and grasp a specific short \u03b1-helical fragment termed the \u2018claw\u201922,23. This binding recruits mTORC1 to the lysosome, where it can be activated by RhebGTP.\nIn contrast to mammalian cells and Schizosaccharomyces pombe24, the yeast Rheb orthologue, Rhb1, does not appear to contribute to TORC1 regulation. Furthermore, yeast TORC1 appears to be constitutively localized to vacuole and/or endosome membranes, regardless of its activity status25,26. Acute glucose starvation triggers the condensation of TORC1 into a large, vacuole-associated helical polymer named TOROID27. TOROID formation leads to Sch9 dephosphorylation, implying that this polymerization is responsible for TORC1 inactivation. Consistently, a low-resolution TOROID structure has suggested that stacking of TORC1 sterically occludes the kinase active site, analogous to rapamycin-FKBP12 binding27. TOROID formation was found to be inhibited by the two yeast RAG orthologues Gtr1 (RAGA/B) and Gtr2 (RAGC/D), because \u0394gtr1 \u0394gtr2 cells form constitutive TOROIDs, even in the presence of glucose, and do not downregulate Sch9 phosphorylation upon glucose starvation27.\nGtr1 and Gtr2 bind to the EGO ternary complex (EGO-TC) composed of Ego1, Ego2 and Ego3 to form EGOC, which is tethered to the vacuolar membrane via myristoylation and palmitoylation of the Ego1 amino-terminal extremity28. Ego1, Ego2 and Ego3 cradle the carboxyl-terminal dimerization domains of Gtr1 and Gtr2 (ref. 29) in a manner that presents the N-terminal G-domains to regulators and effectors. The GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that act on Gtr1 and Gtr2 are SEACIT and Lst4\u20137, respectively30,31. Although numerous guanine nucleotide exchange factors that act on Gtr1 have been reported18,25,31, Gtr2 may not require a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as it possesses an intrinsically high dissociation constant for GDP32. The guanine nucleotide-loading status of the Gtrs appears to have a direct effect on TORC1 localization and activity regulation in yeast. In cells expressing \u2018inactive\u2019 Gtr1GDP\u2013Gtr2GTP, a TOROID punctum on the vacuolar membrane is prominent, and TORC1 activity is reduced; in cells expressing \u2018active\u2019 Gtr1GTP\u2013Gtr2GDP, TORC1 is diffusely localized over the vacuolar surface, and its activity is high26,27. However, the molecular details of how the EGOC governs TOROID assembly, alone or in conjunction with other nutrient-regulated signaling pathways, remain unknown.\nTo assess the contribution of the EGOC to TORC1 localization dynamics, independently of other signaling pathways33, we developed orthogonal approaches to acutely abrogate or reintroduce EGOC activity. Proteolytic shaving of the EGOC from the vacuole membrane triggered TORC1 puncta (TOROID) formation, whereas reintroduction of the EGOC to the vacuole membrane triggered puncta disassembly. We also observed that the EGOC colocalized with TORC1 puncta in a Gtr-dependent fashion. To better characterize this interaction, we used cryo-EM to obtain a 3.9-\u00c5-resolution structure of TORC1 from TOROID cryo-EM maps. We found that a central hub of interactions locks the Kog1 Armadillo domain on top of the kinase domain of Tor2 (Tor2\u2032) in the neighboring protomer/dimer in the TOROID helix (such interprotomer interactions are indicated with a prime throughout) to sterically occlude the kinase active site. CRISPR\u2013Cas9 mutagenesis and pull-down assays were used to verify these core features and revealed that this same hub is engaged by EGOC to activate TORC1 signaling in response to glucose. Based on these data, we propose that the EGOC is necessary and sufficient to prevent TOROID assembly, by competing for a common binding hub; binding of the Kog1 hub to Tor1\u2032/2\u2032 sequesters TORC1 into an inactive TOROID, whereas binding to active EGOC liberates TORC1 dimers that are able to signal to downstream targets.\nNature Structural & Molecular Biology | Volume 30 | March 2023 | 273\u2013285 275\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00912-6\nG FP\nD IC\n0 90 BPS\n(min) 7560453015\nEGO3-GFP, EGO1TEV\n0 90\nEGO3-GFP, EGO1WT\npTEV\n0 9075604530150 90\nG FP\nD IC\nBPS (min)\nGFP-TOR1, EGO1TEVGFP-TOR1, EGO1WT pTEV\n0 90\nEGO3-GFP, \u2206ego1\n0 90\nC el\nls w\nith T\nO RO\nID (%\n)\nBPS treatment (min)\n4\u20190\u2019 6\u20192\u2019 8\u2019 10\u2019 18\u201914\u201912\u2019 20\u201916\u2019\nGFP-TOR1, EGO1TEV, pTEV (30 min BPS)\n0 20 40 60 80\n100 120\n5 10 15 20 250\nTime (min)\nTO RO\nID in\nte ns\nity (%\n)\nEgo1TEV Ego1WT\nHalf-time: 7 min\na GFP-TOR1, \u2206gtr1, \u2206gtr2 \u00d7\n\u03b1 VPH1-mCherry, GTR1, GTR2\nDIC GFP mCherry\nLa te\nIn te\nrm ed\nia te\nEa rly\na GFP-TOR1, \u2206gtr1, \u2206gtr2 \u00d7\n\u03b1 VPH1-mCherry, \u2206gtr1, \u2206gtr2\nDIC GFP mCherry\n(1) (2)\nBu dd\nin g\nzy go\nte s\nta ge\n1412108642\n140\n\u201340\n120 100\n80 60 40 20\n0 \u201320\n0\nBl ea\nch -c\nor re\nct ed\nTO RO\nID in\nte ns\nity (%\n)\nTime (min)\nHalf-time: 2.5 min\nTOROID entering the\nbud\n(1) (2)\n0 151413121110987654321\nTOROID in mat a cell TOROID in B cell\nTime (min)\nEntering the bud\nZygote cell a haploid control (1)\n(2) Zygote cella haploid control\nTEV\nVacuole\nGtr1\nGtr2\nEgo1-3\nMyrist./Palmit. v.m.\nFe2+\nBPS\nTOROID nucleation\ni\nj\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\na \u03b1\nB\nTEV site\nGFP-TOR1, \u2206ego1\na b\nc d\ne f\ng\nh\ni j\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90 10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40 P = 0.0029 P = 0.0012\n50\n100\n0\n100\nW ith\nT O\nRO ID\n(% )\n(1) (2)\nEa rly\n0\n50\nIn te\nrm ed\nia te\nW ith\nT O\nRO ID\n(% )\n0\n50\n100\n0\n50\n100\nLa te\nW ith\nT O\nRO ID\n(% )\n0\n50\n100\n0\n50\n100\nP = 0.0016\nP = 0.0017 P = 0.0033\n* *\nFig. 1 | Acute removal of the EGOC from the vacuole membrane and its restoration induce TOROID formation and dissolution, respectively. a, Schematic depicting the strategy used to shave EGOC from the vacuole membrane. b, EGOC (EGO3-GFP) localization in Ego1WT and Ego1TEV strains following TEV protease induction and in an \u0394ego1 strain as control lacking vacuolar localization. c, TORC1 (GFP-TOR1) monitored in the strains described in b. d, Quantification of data represented in c from n = 3 independent experiments with at least 171 cells examined per condition. e, Single-cell analyses after 30 min of TEV induction in GFP-TOR1, ego1TEV.

Together, these data show that both EGOC and TORC1 form condensates upon acute glucose depletion or in PDS cells, and that large EGOC puncta seem to require a TOROID but not vice versa.\nWe characterized how guanine nucleotide-loading status of the Gtrs affected EGOC puncta. Although deletion of GTRs promotes TORC1 puncta formation (Prouteau et al.27, Fig. 1), EGO-TC puncta were absent in this strain (Fig. 2d). Reintroduction of \u2018active\u2019 GTR alleles (Gtr1GTP\u2013 Gtr2GDP) antagonized both TORC1 and EGOC puncta formation regardless of the growth state, whereas reintroduction of \u2018inactive\u2019 GTR alleles (Gtr1GDP\u2013Gtr2GTP) enhanced formation of TOROIDs but, curiously, not EGOC puncta (Fig. 2e,f). In \u0394gtr1 \u0394gtr2 and Gtr1GDP\u2013Gtr2GTP strains, which contain TOROIDs, TORC1 activity was reduced as evidenced by their rapamycin hypersensitivity (Fig. 2g). As a complementary approach, we used mutant strains in which Gtr GAP activities had been altered. IML1/SEA1 deletion, which leads to Gtr1GTP accumulation, antagonized EGOC and TORC1 puncta (Extended Data Fig. 2d\u2013f), whereas deletion of SEA3 or LST4\u2013LST7, which lead to Gtr1GDP or Gtr2GTP accumulation, respectively, augmented EGOC and TORC1 puncta in exponentially growing cells (Extended Data Fig. 2d\u2013f). Collectively, these results extend our previous observations27 that the nucleotide-loading status of the Gtrs dictates TOROID formation; whether generated by nutrient levels, mutations in the GAPs or mutations in the GTRs themselves, Gtr1GTP\u2013Gtr2GDP antagonize whereas Gtr1GDP\u2013Gtr2GTP promote TOROID formation. The EGOC also forms a punctum, which, in most but not all cases, correlates with the presence of a TOROID, the notable exceptions being the lack of EGOC puncta in \u0394gtr1 \u0394gtr2 cells and in exponentially growing cells expressing \u2018inactive\u2019 GTRs. These last results demonstrate that EGOC puncta are not necessary for TOROID formation but can assemble with TOROIDs in a Gtr-dependent manner. By contrast, active EGOC is needed to prevent TOROID formation.\nWe next performed in vitro binding assays between EGOC variants and free TORC1 dimers purified from exponentially growing cells or TOROIDs from PDS cells. The \u2018active\u2019 EGOC interacted preferentially, albeit weakly, with TORC1 dimers (Fig. 2h,i), while \u2018inactive\u2019 EGOC interacted robustly with TORC1 dimers and even more so with TOROIDs (Fig. 2h,i). Thus, in contrast to the situation in mammalian cells21, the EGOC binds TORC1 regardless of which guanine nucleotides are bound to the Gtrs.\nHigh-resolution cryo-EM TOROID structure To better understand the molecular regulation of TOROID (dis) assembly, we purified TORC1 from KOG1-TAP \u2206tor1 cells grown PDS and acquired a high-resolution TOROID structure by cryo-EM. We hypothesized that TOROIDs containing exclusively Tor2 would yield a higher-resolution structure. Initial structure determination attempts using helical reconstruction resulted in three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions at rather low resolution (Fourier shell correlation (FSC)0.143 = 9.1 \u00c5). The relatively poor precision of helical symmetry determination on the unsymmetrized map (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4) suggested that instead of being a rigid helix, TOROID filaments resemble a flexible slinky-like spring with varying pitch. To overcome this issue, we employed signal subtraction protocols43,44, using the known positions of TORC1 units in the helical reconstruction, to obtain a set of signal-subtracted particles that could be further analyzed using regular single particle analysis (SPA) (Extended Data Fig. 3).\nUsing these particles for 3D reconstruction (Methods)45 resulted in a 3.87-\u00c5 map (FSC = 0.143), which enabled us to build a nearly complete\nstructural model of yeast TORC1 in the TOROID (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Table 1). Although the final map showed resolution heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), the symmetric nature of the TOROID could be exploited to unambiguously build the majority of the TORC1 structure, with many regions resolving individual amino acid side chains (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the 3D reconstruction and local resolution estimation showed that the interactions between adjacent TORC1 units along the TOROID helix (intracoil) were more prominent than interactions along the helix z direction (intercoil; Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), consistent with the resolution difference at the intracoil and intercoil interfaces.\nThe overall yeast TORC1 structure extracted from TOROIDs was very similar to its mammalian counterpart (mTORC1; Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 5). Whereas yeast and human Lst8 were virtually identical (r.m.s. deviation (r.m.s.d.) = 0.9 \u00c5 over 252 aligned main chain atoms), the main differences between Tor2/mTOR (r.m.s.d. = 3.3 over 1608 aligned main chain atoms) and Kog1/RAPTOR (r.m.s.d. = 2.4 over 866 aligned main chain atoms) could be traced to a conformational difference in Tor2 and the presence of previously uncharacterized additional \u03b1-helical regions for Kog1 (Fig. 4b,c). We compared our structure of yeast TORC1 present in TOROIDs with structures of mTORC1 with basal activity (nonactivated state) and active mTORC1 bound to Rheb16. Tor2 in TOROIDs is structurally more like mTOR in nonactivated-state mTORC1 (r.m.s.d.inactive = 3.3 \u00c5) than in Rheb-bound mTORC1 (r.m.s.d.active = 10.4 \u00c5; Fig. 4b). Indeed, TORC1 in TOROIDs had an even more \u2018open\u2019 conformation than nonactivated-state human mTORC1 (Fig. 4a): the HORN region of Tor2 made 10\u00b0 and 24\u00b0 outward shifts compared with nonactivated-state and Rheb-bound mTORC1, respectively (Fig. 4b).\nAlignment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kog1 with orthologous sequences from Homo sapiens, S. pombe and Chaetomium thermophilum reveals a \u2018Twix\u2019 region contributed by two \u03b1-helices connected by a polyglutamine linker uniquely present in budding yeast (Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). The Twix region is situated between \u03b1-helices 26 and 29 of Kog1 and interacts with the FRB\u2032 domain of Tor2\u2032 in an adjacent TORC1\u2032 in the TOROID (Fig. 4d). Adjacent to the Twix region, we observed a map region corresponding to an \u03b1-helix not directly connected to surrounding parts of the structure, yet near Lys1016 of Kog1, which terminates \u03b1-helix 34 (residues 1,005\u20131,016, Extended Data Fig. 5c), and termed this part of TOROID the \u2018Tack\u2019 region. Careful inspection of the sequence succeeding Lys1016 and ensuing model building in Coot led us to propose this region to be a helix with sequence \u2018P1069MRTSLAKLFQSLGFSES1086\u2019 (Figs. 3c and 4d and Extended Data Fig. 5d) of Kog1. Sequence alignments demonstrated that this region precedes the sequence that aligns with the RAPTOR \u2018Claw\u2019 that was shown to interact with RagC in RAPTOR\u2013Rag\u2013Ragulator reconstructions22,23. In this vicinity, the structure displays several prominent molecular interactions leading to a robust TORC1-TORC1\u2032 binding interface that we term the hub of interactions. This hub is centered around Trp2207, which sits between Arg884, Lys885 and Arg888 of Kog1, forming a prominent cation-pi interaction with Arg884 situated near the tip of the Tack \u03b1-helix and the base of the Twix region (Fig. 4d). Altogether, the interactions within this hub shield the kinase active site and thereby block substrate access, potentially contributing (see below), together with the presumed TORC1 subunit allosteric change described above, a structural explanation for why TORC1 is inactive in TOROIDs (Fig. 4d).\nMutations confirm observed TORC1-TORC1\u2032 interfaces To interrogate the functional importance of the intercoil and intracoil interfaces, we mutated selected residues using CRISPR\u2013Cas9 (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 6) and assessed their impact on TORC1 puncta size in cells grown PDS (Extended Data Fig. 6e). In parallel, all mutants were tested in spot assays on rapamycin plates to assess TORC1 activity (Extended Data Fig. 6f). As controls, we first probed exposed residues that were in the vicinity of the intracoil and intercoil interfaces but\nNature Structural & Molecular Biology | Volume 30 | March 2023 | 273\u2013285 278\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00912-6\nnot obviously engaged in TORC1-TORC1\u2032 interactions. As expected, these mutations (Kog1K1383A and Kog1\u03941544-end) did not significantly affect TOROID size or rapamycin sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c,f). By contrast, mutation of Tor1W1279, which is not predicted to mediate contacts within the helix but is predicted to stabilize the BRIDGE domain, yielded a reduction in TOROID size as well as rapamycin hypersensitivity, consistent with TORC1 particle destabilization (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c,f).\nIntercoil interactions, although visible after helical reconstruction, appeared to be almost completely absent in the signal-subtracted map and only became apparent at high contour threshold levels. The intercoil interface was predominantly formed between the Tor2\nHORN and the Kog1\u2032 WD domain (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Two exposed loops in the HORN, Tor2337\u2013345 (Tor1326\u2013334) and Tor2379\u2013381 (Tor368\u2013370), were substituted by poly alanine-glycine stretches. These strains displayed a significant reduction in TOROID size as well as an increase in rapamycin resistance (Extended Data Fig. 6b,d\u2013f). A protruding region of the Tor2 FAT/kinase domain (FATKIN) also appeared to interact with Kog1\u2032; mutation of this region of Tor1 (Tor11449/54/56A) resulted in similar phenotypes (Extended Data Fig. 6b,d\u2013f).\nIntracoil interactions were plentiful, and mainly contributed by Kog1 interacting with Kog1\u2032, Lst8\u2032, and the FATKIN\u2032 and BRIDGE\u2032 regions of Tor2\u2032 from an adjacent TORC1\u2032 protomer unit.

Similar results were obtained with reciprocal mutations in Kog1 (Kog1E784A, Kog1S895-896A; Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Gly781 in Kog1 interacts with Gln29 of Lst8\u2032; alanine substitution of this Gln residue strongly reduced TOROID formation and led to an increase in rapamycin resistance (Extended Data Fig. 6a,e,f). Among the intracoil interactions, the TORC1-TORC1\u2032 \u2018hub\u2019 is formed through extensive contacts between the Twix helices of Kog1 and the FRB domain of Tor2\u2032 (Fig. 4d), the end of the Tack helix and the Tor2\u2032 FATKIN (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Figs. 5d and 6), and a basic pocket of Kog1 that hosts Trp2207 from the Lst8-binding element of Tor2\u2032.

To test if this interaction was important for TORC1 regulation, we substituted this tryptophan with arginine in both Tor1 and Tor2 (Tor1W2203R, Tor2W2207R). In these cells, TOROID formation was absent, and TORC1 was hyperactive as shown by increased rapamycin resistance, consistent with a charge repulsion with Kog1\u2032 (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Substitution of Arg884 of Kog1 to Asp (the corresponding human residue; KOG1R884D) partially blocked TOROID formation in PDS (30% reduction versus WT; Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Multiple efforts to change codons R884/R885/ K888 to alanine or aspartate unfortunately failed.\nkog1HC allele unveils the TORC1-EGOC interaction domain TOROIDs have not been reported in other systems, and we wondered whether the yeast-specific Twix helices \u03b127 and \u03b128 of Kog1 might be a reason for this. To test this, we made two kog1 mutant strains, one (kog1\u0394Twix) in which the Twix helices \u03b127 and \u03b128 were \u2018cleanly\u2019 replaced with a short (AG)4 linker and a second, (kog1\nHC, humanized chimera) in which \u03b126 to \u03b129 were replaced with the corresponding, shorter sequence of human Raptor (Fig. 6a). kog1\u0394Twix cells formed TOROIDs normally when cultured PDS (Fig. 6b,c), had nearly normal sensitivity to rapamycin (Fig. 6d) and displayed essentially WT Sch9 phosphorylation kinetics upon acute glucose starvation and repletion (Fig. 6e). Kog1HC cells cultured PDS also formed TOROIDs\nindistinguishably from WT cells (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 6e). Thus, the Twix helices are not necessary for TOROID formation or TORC1 regulation.\nThe kog1HC allele replaces helix \u03b129, which contains the three basic residues (Kog1R884/K885/R888) thought to interact with Trp2207 of Tor2 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Although KOG1R884D did not suppress the inability of TOR1W2203R TOR2W2207R cells to form TOROIDs, we found that kog1HC did do so (Extended Data Fig. 6e). As expected, the TOR1W2203R TOR2W2207R kog1HC strain had lower rapamycin resistance than the TOR1W2203R TOR2W2207R strain (Extended Data Fig. 6f). However, we unexpectedly noticed that kog1HC cells contained TOROIDs when growing exponentially (Fig. 6b,c) and displayed hypersensitivity to rapamycin (Fig. 6d), like \u2206gtr1 \u2206gtr2 cells. Furthermore, in kog1HC cells, TORC1 activity was reduced and largely insensitive to acute changes in glucose levels (Fig. 6e), and EGOC puncta were absent (Fig. 6f,g). Last, unlike WT TORC1, Kog1HC-containing TORC1 failed to robustly interact with purified EGOC (Fig. 6h,i and Extended Data Fig. 7c). Collectively, these results suggest that the EGOC-binding site lies within helix \u03b126 and/or \u03b129 of Kog1, that is, within the TOROID hub of interactions. The results also demonstrate that TOROID assembly is necessary but not sufficient for EGOC puncta formation.\nBased on these observations, we wondered whether kog1HC suppressed the inability of TOR1W2203R TOR2W2207R cells to form TOROIDs because of its own inability to bind the EGOC rather than, or in addition\nor Kog1C777R-TAP or Kog1\u0394\u03b121-TAP using cobalt-Dynabeads precoated with purified (His)6 proteins.

Consistent with this idea, we observed that the \u2206gtr1 \u2206gtr2 double deletion was epistatic to TOR1W2203R TOR2W2207R: \u2206gtr1 \u2206gtr2 TOR1W2203R TOR2W2207R cells presented constitutive TOROIDs (Extended Data Fig. 7d).\nExclusive interaction of TORC1 with EGOC or TORC1\u2032. We observed a strong anticorrelation between TOROID size in PDS and rapamycin sensitivity among our mutant strains (PC: \u22120.75; Extended Data Fig. 7e). Strains with mutations compromising TORC1-TORC1\u2032 interactions have small TOROIDs and are resistant to rapamycin, whereas those with mutations abrogating TORC1-EGOC binding have large TOROIDs and are sensitive to rapamycin. Thus, sensitivity to rapamycin depends on the proportion of free and active TORC1 dimers. Exploiting this idea, we set up a CRISPR-based PCR random mutagenesis screen, targeting the region surrounding \u03b126\u2013\u03b129 (Kog1696\u2013922), to define further the TORC1-EGOC interface (Fig. 7a). The first selection step was rapamycin hypersensitivity, expecting that mutants of interest would present a hypersensitive phenotype like that of \u0394gtr1/2 and kog1HC strains. The second step was to select for TOROID formation in glucose-replete cultures. From a library of 3,500 mutants, 42 rapamycin-sensitive clones were identified, of which 13 presented TOROIDs in glucose-replete media (Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 8a,d). Seventeen point mutations were identified, of which seven (marked in bold below) were the only mutation present in the clone and could thus be deemed causative (Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 8b\u2013d). Remarkably, although the Twix-encoding region was included in this screen, no mutation within this sequence was recovered, supporting the idea that it does not participate in EGOC-dependent regulation of TOROIDs.\nSeveral mutations, alone (in bold) or in combination, altered leucine residues involved in hydrophobic interactions between \u03b1-helices (L762P, L765P, L766P, L900P, L912Q; Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 8c,d), suggesting that local perturbation of domain packing may affect EGOC binding. L737Q (found in combination with L762P), at the junction of the \u03b121-22 helices, C777R and M778T in helix \u03b124, I802N and A804E in helix \u03b126, and I891N in helix \u03b129 were identified (Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 7b\u2013d) and mapped to a region which in Raptor is important for interaction with RagA (Raptor residues N557, C594 and 634\u2013636; Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 5c)23. Consistently, replacing Kog1 helix \u03b121 (corresponding to \u03b123 in Raptor, which is important for RagA binding) with an alanine-glycine linker resulted in constitutive TOROID formation (Fig. 7c). We next queried whether \u2018activity\u2019 of the EGOC was important for TORC1-TOROID binding. Strikingly, we found that whereas TORC1WT interacted with both active and inactive EGOC, TORC1 harboring Kog1HC, Kog1C777R or Kog1\u0394\u03b121 lost the ability to interact with active EGOC but retained the ability to interact with inactive EGOC (Fig. 7d and Extended Data Fig. 8e), suggesting that there are multiple binding modes between EGOC and TORC1.\nIn TOROIDs, the Tack helix is at the TORC1-TORC1\u2032 interface and occupies a location similar to that of the Claw fragment of Raptor that interacts with RagC. To probe the function of Tack, we made several polyAG substitutions. Replacement of the proximal \u03b1-helix 34 (Kog11004\u20131022) had no effect on TOROID regulation, whereas replacement of residues 1,069\u20131,086 of Kog1, which we attribute to the TOROID Tack helix, caused a mild but significant impairment of TOROID formation (Extended Data\nFig. 8f,g). Replacement of the putative yeast Claw-equivalent sequence (Kog11121\u20131131)23 had no significant effect on either TOROID formation or regulation (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). Thus, the Tack helix does not function equivalently to the Raptor Claw but provides structural elements (Kog1F1083 binding to Tor2\u2032P2201) needed to stabilize the TOROID.\nBased on these collective observations, we propose that, analogous to the binding observed in mammalian cells, active EGOC binds to helices \u03b121, \u03b124, \u03b126 and \u03b129 of Kog1. This binding competes with a critical interface needed for TOROID formation and would thus release free TORC1 dimers that are competent to signal to downstream effectors (Fig. 7e). Inactive EGOC appears to also bind via an independent, yet to be determined, interface within TORC1-TOROIDs."

Our previous, low-resolution, 3D reconstruction revealed that TOROID-sequestered TORC1 is inactive owing to a rapamycin-FKBP12-like occlusion of the kinase active site.\nWe show here that the EGOC alone is sufficient to control the dynamic equilibrium between active TORC1 dimers diffusely localized on the surface of the vacuole, and inactive TORC1 dimers polymerized into a TOROID. Consistently, across many mutant strains, we observed a strong anticorrelation between TORC1 puncta size and rapamycin resistance (Extended Data Fig. 7c). We note that the EGOC is not the sole regulator of TORC1 activity (indeed TORC1-mTORC1 activity is still apparent in gtr1 gtr2/rag mutants46). How regulators such as Snf1 and Pib2 (refs. 47,48) interface with TOROID-based regulation remains an important unknown. Furthermore, distinct pools of TORC1 (for example, endosomal TORC1)26 could be subject to distinct upstream regulatory mechanisms.\nThe major advance of our present work is the molecular insight into how EGOC binding liberates TORC1 dimers from TOROID polymers. Our high-resolution TORC1 map revealed that TOROIDs are rather spring-like with loose intercoil interactions and robust intracoil interactions. The intracoil interactions occlude access to the active site, which, together with presumed allosteric changes to the catalytic spine, ensures inactivation of TORC1 engaged in a TOROID. Closer inspection of the TORC1-TORC1\u2032 interface proximal to the kinase active site revealed a hub of interactions primarily involving Kog1 and Tor2\u2032. Using CRISPR\u2013 Cas9-supported random mutagenesis of this region, we found that \u03b1-helices 21\u201326 and 29 of Kog1 serve as a binding platform for Gtr1\u2013Gtr2. This observation was satisfying because the corresponding region of Raptor (\u03b123\u2013\u03b129) had previously been found to bind to RagA\u2013RagC23.\nCollectively, these observations clearly demonstrate that EGOC binding to this region of Kog1 disrupts the hub of interactions needed to sustain TOROID assembly, providing a mechanism to explain how EGOC can liberate and/or maintain free, active TORC1 dimers. This conclusion was not obvious because the positioning of the Twix helices should occlude this mode of GTPase binding.\nIndeed, the Twix (Kog1 \u03b127 and \u03b128) and Tack (proposed residues 1,069\u20131,086 of Kog1) helices formed prominent features near the active site of an adjacent TORC1 in the TOROID structure. Modeling of the Twix helices could be unambiguously performed due to their direct connection with neighboring Kog1 residues. Conversely, the Tack region corresponds to an isolated helix not directly connected to Kog1, yet in close proximity to Kog1 Lys1016 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). The medium local resolution (Extended Data Fig. 5d) allowed us to hypothesize that the Tack helix corresponds to Kog1 residues 1,069-1,086. We argued from their placement that the Twix and Tack helices could be important in TOROID stabilization and TORC1 regulation. However, this appears not to be the case. Removal of the Twix helices slightly increased TOROID formation and rapamycin sensitivity, suggesting that they promote or stabilize active TORC1. By contrast, removal of the Tack partially compromised TOROID formation, suggesting that it helps to stabilize the TOROID structure. We hypothesize that these helices are mobile and are displaced upon EGOC binding. The molecular details of this displacement await a structure of TORC1 bound to active EGOC.\nAlthough this model of TORC1 regulation is appealing, it is oversimplified, as it does not consider the nucleotide-loading status of Gtr1 and Gtr2. A priori, one could posit that only \u2018active\u2019 EGOC binds TORC1, preventing its association into a TOROID. However, the following compelling evidence suggests that inactive EGOC also binds TORC1.\n(1) In in vitro pulldowns, TORC1 interacted with both \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018inactive\u2019 EGOC, apparently through distinct interfaces (Figs. 2h,i and 7d and Extended Data Fig. 8e). (2) \u2018Inactive\u2019 EGOC puncta partially colocalize with TOROIDs (Supplementary Fig. 2). (3) Expression of \u2018inactive\u2019 gtr alleles produce phenotypes that are more severe than those resulting from simple gtr1/2 deletion25.\nConsistently, the expected accumulation of Gtr1GDP/\u2013Gtr2GTP appears to cause synthetic lethality when deletion of LST4 or LST7 is combined with hypomorphic sec13 alleles (encoding a SEACAT component)49. (4) Loss of RAG GTPases in S. pombe leads to hyperactivation of TORC1 (ref. 50). The RAG GTPases do not solely interact with TORC1; they also interact with their respective GAPs. Recent evidence suggests that with both GATOR1 and Folliculin-Fnip, the RAGs also have multiple binding modes18,51,52. How inactive EGOC inhibits TORC1 activity will be an important question for future studies.\nConsidering TOROIDs beyond yeast, there does not appear to be any structural argument to preclude the existence of TOROID in mammalian cells. Indeed, mTOROID-like regulation could explain why mTORR2266P and possibly RaptorD635N are associated with carcinoma, based on our finding that substitution of the analogous residue in Tor1W2203R Tor2W2207R generated cells that did not form TOROIDs and appeared to possess hyperactive TORC1 signaling (that is, were resistant to rapamycin). This double mutant is intriguing as it still requires the Gtrs to prevent TOROID formation. It may possess a higher affinity for low levels of \u2018active\u2019 EGOC in PDS cells. Further characterization of this mutant is clearly warranted."

TORC1 filaments were picked manually using the e2helixboxer module in EMAN2 (ref. 58) from a total of 3,864 micrographs (1,037 micrographs did not contain any TOROID filaments), resulting in 8,625 picked filaments. A total of 219,455 particles were extracted in RELION2.0 (ref. 59) using the -helix option, with an extract size of 600 pixels (810 \u00c5), an outer diameter of 620 \u00c5 and a helical rise of 26.75 \u00c5. Following particle extraction, per-particle CTF correction was performed using Gctf60.\nInitially, helical reconstruction was performed in RELION2.0 using binned particles (2.7 \u00c5 per pixel), a previously acquired low-resolution map of TOROID27 low-pass filtered to 30 \u00c5, and corresponding previously determined helical parameters as input, while imposing D1 symmetry and allowing for a helical symmetry search to optimize the respective helical parameters. The result of this helical reconstruction converged to a map with a resolution of around 9.1 \u00c5 based on the 0.143 gold-standard FSC criterion61. The 3D classification and subsequent helical refinement in RELION2.0 did not result in an increase in resolution. Next, we imported nonbinned particles and the reconstructed map resampled to a voxel size of 1.35 \u00c5 into cryoSPARC 3.01 (ref. 62) and performed helical reconstruction imposing D1 symmetry, while allowing a helical symmetry search starting from the helical parameters obtained from the RELION helical reconstruction. The resulting 3D reconstruction had a resolution of 9.3 \u00c5, similar to the helical reconstruction in RELION. The broad peak of the mean squared error in a plot showing the estimated twist and rise (Supplementary Fig. 3a) indicated a relatively poor accuracy for determining the helical symmetry parameters on the unsymmetrized map of the last 3D refinement round. Indeed, similar scores were obtained for a twist ranging from approximately 46.9\u00b0 to 47.7\u00b0 and rise from approximately 25.2 \u00c5 to 28.2 \u00c5, which would translate into pitch changes from 201 to 205 \u00c5 and 192 to 215 \u00c5, respectively (given an average twist for variable rise and vice versa).\nWe thus argued that the rather low resolution obtained after helical reconstruction in RELION and cryoSPARC could be the consequence of a varying pitch along the helices, resulting in an averaging of the structure while implying one set of helical parameters. To test this, we used the 9.1 \u00c5 helical reconstruction map (resampled to a voxel size of 1.35 \u00c5) to create a mask containing the whole TOROID filament segment except for one central TORC1 assembly and its interacting regions with adjacent TORC1 complexes to ensure that information on the TORC1-TORC1\u2032 interfaces remained intact. We then performed signal subtraction in RELION2.0, using this mask and the structure and segment coordinates of the helical reconstruction, to generate a set of 219,455 subtracted particles containing one isolated TORC1 assembly per segment. Next, we employed the \u2018localrec\u2019 module in\nNature Structural & Molecular Biology\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00912-6\nScipion43,44 to crop and recenter the signal-subtracted particles in a smaller box of 300 pixels (405 \u00c5), as well as assigning to each particle a refined defocus based on the helical geometry. SPA of the subtracted particles using 3D refinement in RELION2.0, while imposing D1 symmetry, resulted in a map with a resolution of 4.5 \u00c5 (FSC = 0.143). We then imported the particles from the RELION2.0 refinement into cryoSPARC 3.01. After two-dimensional classification and class selection, a set of 213,808 selected particles was used for nonuniform refinement45 in cryoSPARC 3.01, employing a dynamic mask, imposing D1 symmetry, using the option to keep particles from the same helix in the same half-set, and allowing high-order aberration estimation and correction, which resulted in a final map with a resolution of 3.87 \u00c5 (FSC = 0.143).

The Alphafold Tor2 model was predicted equally well but displayed a closed conformation (similar to active mTOR, Fig. 4b), in stark contrast to the open conformation of Tor2 extracted from our TOROID structural model, resulting in a r.m.s.d. value of 8.5 \u00c5 (1894 aligned main chain atoms). Whereas the Kog1 Alphafold model showed high overall agreement with the Kog1 extracted from the TOROID structure (r.m.s.d. = 0.8 \u00c5 over 1,016 aligned main chain atoms), the \u2018Twix\u2019 region displayed a tilt that markedly differed from the TOROID structure. Residues 1,069\u20131,086 Kog1 which we assigned to the 'Tack' region, although correctly predicted as a helix surrounded by long loop regions, is predicted to be in a different location. Accordingly, the model confidence score of this particular region in the Kog1 Alphafold structural prediction was very low. Nonetheless, we were able to use the Kog1 Alphafold model to improve the TOROID Kog1 structure in regions where the EM map was very weak, notably the Kog1 N terminus and the C-terminal WD domain, resulting in significantly improved protein geometry validation statistics. A summary of refinement and validation statistics can be found in Table 1."

The terminator contains AU Rich Elements (AREs) recognized by the Cth2 protein that, when bound, destabilizes the transcript triggering its fast turnover. The promoter is additionally activated by Aft1 and Aft2 transcription factors which are repressed by the presence of Iron. Bathophenantroline dissulfonic acid is a specific Iron chelator used to quickly induce the TEV protease expression. The TEV site has been inserted into the N-terminal non-conserved sequence of Ego1 downstream of the lipidated residues. This expression system, unlike other, commonly used inducible promoters (such as the GAL1 promoter), was chosen as it does not per se effect TORC1 signalling. b) Western Blot analyses of TEV expression (\u03b1-HA tag) and TORC1 activity were monitored by anti-Sch9 Ser758 phosphorylation (\u03b1-P-Sch9) and anti-total Sch9 (\u03b1-tot-Sch9) antibodies. WT cells transformed with empty\nor TEV plasmid (pTEV) were subjected to BPS and rapamycin treatments as indicated. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Averages of the TEV expression normalized to the maximum are indicated with the standard deviations for N = 3 replicates. The induction half-time is 23 minutes (EC50 Pearson\u2019s coefficient = 0.989). c) Serial 10-fold dilutions of strains of the indicated genotype were spotted onto plates containing vehicle or 2.5 nM rapamycin and 100 \u00b5M Mohr salt or 25 \u00b5M BPS. d) Bar chart representing the quantity of Ego3 present around the vacuolar membrane. EGOC depletion from the vacuolar membrane was determined by measuring the normalized Vacuolar Enrichment (see graphic): vacuole associated Ego3-GFP signal minus cytosolic background signal from Fig. 1b) Vacuolar depletion half-time is 25.5 minutes after TEV protease induction in a Ego1TEV strain. The measures are based on n = 3 independent experiments with 10 cells analysed per replicate.\nNature Structural & Molecular Biology\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00912-6\nExtended Data Fig. 2 | EGOC puncta formation requires TOROIDs and is regulated by Gtr-GAPs. a) Cells expressing GFP-KOG1 or GFP-TOR1, and EGO33xmCherry were imaged in exponential phase, after 30 minutes of acute glucose depletion or in PDS by confocal microscopy. (Scale bar, 5 \u00b5m) b) Confocal images of PDS GFP-KOG1 EGO3-3xmCherry-expressing cells were used to assess EGOC puncta and TOROID colocalization. Global 3D Pearson coefficient is indicated in black and reflects the global colocalization. Manders coefficients using mCherry (1) or GFP (2) channels are indicated in gray and reflects the overlaps of GFP in mCherry and mCherry in GFP signals, respectively. These parameters were calculated using Imaris software. The data represented on the bar charts were generated from n = 3 independent experiments. c) Workflow of the image analysis used to calculate the extent of TOROID colocalization with EGOC puncta and vice versa, A and B respectively.
