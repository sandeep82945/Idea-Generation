    "abstractText": "Aims: The objective of this study is to longitudinally assess sociodemographic and psychological correlates of increased alcohol use during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) period among adolescents and young adults. Methods: Pre-COVID period is defined as the 1-year period on or before 31 March 2020, and during-COVID period is defined as the period from 1st April 2020 to 30 March 2021. Univariable logistic regression models are used to evaluate the association of demographic characteristics, Area Deprivation Index (ADI), rurality, changes in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale severity, and the risk of increased alcohol consumption (binge drinking, number of drinks and drinking regularity) from pre-COVID to during-COVID period. Results and conclusion: Our study found that worsened anxiety symptoms, older age, being in college and current cigarette smoking status were associated with increased alcohol use among youth during the pandemic year. Socioeconomic position (measured by ADI) and rural status were not found to be associated with increased alcohol use among adolescents and young adults.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic upended normal life across all age spectra and presented as an abrupt disruption to education, employment and living conditions (Chaturvedi et al., 2021). These disruptions, together with the fear associated with contracting COVID-19 infection and death, compounded anxiety and stress (Sharma et al., 2020). A recent meta-analysis suggested that one in four youth globally experienced clinically elevated depression symptoms, whereas one in five youth experienced clinically elevated anxiety symptoms (Racine et al., 2021). Evidence indicates negative affective states and anxiety triggered by social conditions are risk factors for substance use in young people, similar to adults (Sinha, 2008). The increase in anxiety and depression due to the pandemic, and the associations between these conditions and alcohol use, have led to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use in youth (Clay and Parker, 2020; McKay and Asmundson, 2020).\nThe longitudinal studies so far provide mixed results on the direction and the magnitude of changes in alcohol consumption, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Some studies reflected increased use (Oksanen et al., 2021;\nBollen et al., 2022; Patrick et al., 2022), whereas others observed decreases in level of drinking (Evans et al., 2021; Jaffe et al., 2021; Pelham 3rd et al., 2021; Ryerson et al., 2021; Vasconcelos et al., 2021) among young people. Yet, most of these studies were conducted in small convenience samples and follow-up was limited to only a few weeks to months.\nResearch examining potential risk factors reported poor overall mental health, depression, anxiety and associated increases in alcohol consumption (Sallie et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2020; Garnett et al., 2021; Guignard et al., 2021; Jacob et al., 2021). Indeed, events that are stressful (Park et al., 2004), traumatic and anxiety-invoking could trigger the onset of problematic alcohol consumption (Elsayed et al., 2018; Cloutier et al., 2019). In addition, the use of other substances such as tobacco and cannabis also appear to be relevant along the spectrum of alcohol use among adolescents and young adults. In a longitudinal study during the pandemic, college students who experienced a relatively low meaning of life (which could be independently associated with depressive states), perceived more general and COVID-19 stress and were associated with more alcohol use (Jaffe et al., 2021). Given the COVID-19 pandemic was a traumatic and stressful event for many and was associated with increased anxiety and\nic.oup.com /alcalc/article/57/6/648/6576449 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\ndepression severity (Liao et al., 2021; Thorisdottir et al., 2021; Varma et al., 2021), we hypothesized that it has contributed to changes in alcohol use.\nFurthermore, from a socioecological perspective, a dynamic interplay of the factors at the individual and environment/community level may contribute to individual outcomes (alcohol use in this case; McLeroy et al., 1988). Because the pandemic has affected income, employment and financial stability, along with physical and social isolation (Nicola et al., 2020), changes in alcohol consumption during the ongoing pandemic could potentially be associated with socioeconomic status and urban versus rural residence.\nOverall, the existing data suggest that the pandemic has had a widespread impact on affective state, stress and alcohol use; however, data are limited and conflicting among adolescents and young adult populations. To address these evidentiary gaps, we studied associations between demographic factors (including socio-demographic factors), changes in the severity of psychological distress and changes in alcohol use before and after the onset of COVID-19 in adolescents and young adults. We hypothesized a positive association between increased alcohol use and greater severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as demographic factors such as area-based socioeconomic disadvantage and living in a rural area."

Data were collected through self-reported responses to three questions about alcohol use during the clinical visit. Drinking regularity was categorized as: never, monthly or less, 2\u20134 times a month, 2\u20133 times a week or 4 or more times a week. Drinking frequency was categorized into 1 or 2, 3 or 4, 5 or 6, 7\u20139 or 10 or more drinks per drinking day. Binge drinking regularity was categorized as never, less than monthly, monthly, weekly or daily or almost daily.\nIndependent Variables Independent variables included demographic characteristics of patients including area-based socioeconomic disadvantage and rurality of patients\u2019 residence and changes in depression and anxiety over the previously mentioned periods.\nDemographic characteristics (age, gender and race/ethnicity), smoking status (any smoking during study period) and education status (highest during the study period) were extracted from the EHRs.\nSocioeconomic position was measured by the Area Deprivation Index (ADI; Singh, 2003) and the rurality (USDA, 2020) of the patients\u2019 residence. Because these patients were young adults and adolescents, traditional measures of socioeconomic status, such as income, typically used for adults were not applicable; these variables came closest to reflecting socioeconomic status for patients in our cohort. ADI scores were obtained from 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. ACS is an annual survey conducted by the US Census Bureau that provides population-level estimates that are representative of the noninstitutionalized US population. Indepth survey methods can be found on the US Census Bureau website (ACS, 2020). We used 17 block-group indicators, representing income, employment, housing and education, to compute ADI scores for all US Census block groups (Kurani et al., 2022). All block groups were ranked by ADI scores. Each block group was assigned to a quintile of ADI scores from the least deprived 20% of block groups (quintile 1) to the most deprived 20% of block groups (quintile 5). Weights that were assigned to each variable in the ADI. A geographic hot spot map of block group ADI scores in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin (n = 11,230) was created and has been previously described (Kurani et al., 2020). Rurality was ascertained from patient zip codes to identify corresponding Rural\u2013Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. Based on published definitions (Johnson et al., 2018; USDA, 2020), the RUCA codes classified areas as urban or rural.\nDepression and anxiety symptoms were assessed by PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively, both self-reported scales with strong internal and test\u2013retest reliability as well as construct and factor-structure validity (Kroenke et al., 2001; Spitzer et al., 2006; Kroenke et al., 2010). GAD-7 was categorized into four levels (0\u20134: minimal anxiety, 5\u20139: mild anxiety, 10\u201314: moderate anxiety and 15\u201321: severe anxiety) and PHQ-9 was categorized into five levels (0\u20134: none-minimal depression, 5\u2013 9: mild depression, 10\u201314: moderate depression, 15\u201319: moderately severe depression, 20\u201327: severe depression; Kroenke et al., 2001; Spitzer et al., 2006)."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We explored predictors of increased alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents and young adults. Overall, the majority of the youth in our sample did not increase their alcohol regularity, consumption or frequency of binge drinking. Worsened anxiety symptoms, older age,\neducation level (being in college) and current cigarette smoking status were associated with increased alcohol use during the pandemic year compared to the previous nonpandemic year.\nStudies longitudinally assessing the mental health predictors of problematic alcohol use among youth during the first year\nof the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. A recent study by Venanzi and colleagues found that symptoms of depression, greater pandemic-related stress assessed by Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and intolerance of uncertainty predicted 3-month follow-up alcohol use severity in young adults (aged 18\u201325; Venanzi et al., 2022). Our longitudinal study makes\na novel contribution to the literature by exploring changes in participants\u2019 drinking behavior between the pre-pandemic and pandemic year (across a span of 2 years), demonstrating that an increase in anxiety severity independently predicted patterns of problematic alcohol use (Drinking Regularity and binge drinking) among adolescents and young adults.\nOur study findings also align with pre-pandemic literature that anxiety among adolescents and young adults is associated with problematic substance use. Studies outside the context of COVID-19 have found that college enrollment has been associated with an increased risk of alcohol use (Quinn and Fromme, 2011). We found that college-aged young adults may have been particularly at higher risk of increased alcohol\nuse patterns during the pandemic. Mental health problems were already high among emerging adults even prior to the pandemic (Oswalt et al., 2020); the emergence of the pandemic could have contributed added psychiatric burden on this population leading to problematic drinking. Given our data are limited to 2 years and two-time points, it is difficult to infer that the associations we found are in relation to\nongoing COVID-19. In addition, psychiatric disorders and cooccurring substance use (alcohol use in this case) evolve over time and may be associated with other life factors that are not fully explored in our study. However, our study provides a preliminary indication of such an association. Longer longitudinal studies assessing change in trajectories over time could provide more clear answers.\nOur study has both clinical and research implications. Given that we are still in the pandemic and, mounting evidence indicates that college students/young adults are an important demographic that experienced significantly increased anxiety, depression and alcohol use, our findings have practical implications for clinicians and health care providers. For example, adolescents and young adults should be periodically screened for depression, anxiety and substance use, and the treatment should be individualized based on the assessment of social determinants of health.\nOur study has some potential limitations that should be noted. Most notably, selection bias is a concern as the study population is limited to individuals who received healthcare at two points and also completed the alcohol use questionnaires. This type of selection can induce collider bias because both the independent exposure variables and the alcohol use outcomes likely influence seeking healthcare and completing the alcohol use questionnaires. Therefore, the observed changes in alcohol use and the effect estimates should be interpreted with caution. We analyzed data extracted from existing medical records, which are prone to errors including missing data. Substance use, including alcohol use, is typically underreported due to social stigma associated with substance use screening and reporting (Harrison et al., 2007). Our sample was mostly white, limiting generalizability to other diverse patient groups albeit located in five different states. The EHR does not utilize validated measures to capture substance use; however, our study could circumvent this limitation since we are measuring the change in substance use in the same individuals to capture changes between April 2019\u2013March 2020 and April 2020\u2013 March 2021. Despite these limitations, our study has many strengths such as large sample size and a longitudinal study design. We also accounted for area-level characteristics at a granular level (block group), which is a novel approach, particularly for this age group to better understand how individuals\u2019 areas of residence can impact their alcohol use. In addition, data were collected at the time of a clinic visit, limiting participant recall bias."
