    "abstractText": "The development of high-performance and cost-effective earth-abundant transition metalbased electrocatalysts is of major interest for several key energy technologies, including water splitting. Herein, we report the synthesis of ultrathin CoMoP nanosheets through a simple ion etching and phosphorization method. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability towards oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER), with overpotentials down to 273 and 89 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122, respectively. The produced CoMoP nanosheets are also characterized by very small Tafel slopes, 54.9 and 69.7 mV dec\u22121 for OER and HER, respectively. When used as both cathode and anode electrocatalyst in the overall water splitting reaction, CoMoP-based cells require just 1.56 V to reach 10 mA cm\u22122 in alkaline media. This outstanding performance is attributed to the proper composition, weak crystallinity and two-dimensional nanosheet structure of the electrocatalyst.",

            "text": "Hydrogen, with a high gravimetric energy density (142 MJ kg\u22121) and zero-carbon emissions, is both a key component in the chemical industry and a very appealing energy carrier for clean and sustainable energy storage and supply [1,2]. Since molecular hydrogen is not freely available in nature, it needs to be extracted from hydrogen-containing compounds. Currently, fossil fuels are the main source of H2, which involves the release of large amounts of carbon. The electrochemical water splitting is the main green alternative to produce H2, but it is seriously hampered by the high cost and insufficient durability of current electrocatalysts, based on scarce novel metals such as Pt, Ir and Ru [3\u20136], and the slow kinetics of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER, OER), which makes water electrolysis not competitive with steam reforming of natural gas or coal gasification processes [7\u20139]. In order to overcome the current challenges and enable the massive production of H2 by water splitting, substantial efforts were devoted to the development of high activity, stable and cost-effective electrocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS). Among the wide range of materials proposed for alkaline water electrolysis, including metal oxides/hydroxides [10\u201312], chalcogenides [13\u201316], nitrides [17,18] and carbides [19,20], metal phosphides demonstrated particularly attractive catalytic performances [21,22].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1098. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12071098 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1098 2 of 12\nThe outstanding performance of phosphides was related to their high electrical conductivity, favorable electronic structure and high stability against corrosion [23,24]. Amongst phosphides, cobalt phosphide (CoP) exhibits an exceptional HER activity associated with a proper electronic structure and specifically to the effective capture of protons by the negatively charged phosphorous atoms [25,26]. Besides, CoP is also characterized by a very high OER activity associated with the high ability of the positively charged cobalt cations to adsorb oxygen intermediates while the negatively-charged P facilitates the desorption of O2 molecules [27,28]. However, the OWS in CoP still requires too large overpotentials for practical applications, mainly ascribed to the high dissociation energy of water and the sluggish OER kinetics involving a multi-electron transfer process [29,30]. An effective strategy to optimize a material\u2019s performance is the introduction of an additional element that provides additional degrees of freedom to modulate its electronic structure and surface properties. Within transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts, additional metals enable a fine-tuning of the d-band position, optimizing the adsorption free energy of the reactants/intermediates/products and thus improving the catalytic activity and even stability. In this direction, Xiao et al. reported the HER catalytic activity of CoP to be boosted by vanadium doping [31]. The introduced V strongly interacts with the hosted Co atoms, enhancing the VCoP electron density and thus accelerating the HER. Other elements, such as Zn [32], Mn [33], Ni [34], Ce [35], Cr [36] and W [21], were also demonstrated to promote either the HER or OER through enhancing electron interactions [28]. Beyond composition, the structure, morphology and organization of the catalyst particles are key parameters defining the density, accessibility and activity of the catalytic sites, which ultimately determine the catalytic activity. In this regard, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), with a crystalline and porous structure formed by metal ion/cluster bridged by organic ligands, were demonstrated to be excellent sacrificial templates to produce porous carbon-based nanomaterials with tuned composition and morphology [37\u201340]. Inspired by the above considerations, we rationally designed a novel and highly effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for OWS. This new catalyst is based on CoP, structured as 2D ultrathin nanosheets and derived from the ZIF-67 MOF. It includes Mo6+ as a high valence 4d transition metal ion, which ionic radius of 0.62 \u00c5 matches well with that of Co3+ (0.63 \u00c5), thus allowing the substitution of Co3+ by Mo6+ within the CoP lattice [41,42]. We demonstrated here that the proposed porous nanosheet-based structure and the incorporation of Mo within the CoP lattice enable rapid water dissociation and effective and stable HER and OER performances."

The ZIF-67 was reacted with ammonium molybdate with the double role of etching the structure and partially replacing Co3+ cations by Mo6+, yielding a porous wrinkled nanosheet-based material that we refer to as Co\u2013Mo MOF (Figure 1c).

Hydrogen Evolution Reaction The HER performance of CoMoP was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH using a three-electrode system, and it was compared wit that of Mo\u2013CoP, CoP and a commercial Pt/C catalyst. As shown in Figures 5a and S8b, the CoMoP electrocatalyst displayed a relatively low HER overpotential of 89 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm\u22122, slightly above that of Pt/C (42 mV) and well below that of Mo\u2013CoP (154 mV), CoP (165 mV) and most previously reported phosphide-based HER electr catalysts (Table S2). The Tafel slope of CoMoP (69.7 mV dec\u22121) was also much lower than those of Mo\u2013CoP (83.7 mV dec\u22121), CoP (113.4 mV dec\u22121) and close to that of Pt/C (56.1 mV dec\u22121) (Figure 5b), which indicated rapid HER reaction kinetics following the Volmer\u2013Heyrovsky mecha ism [61,62]. CoMoP also displayed the smallest semicircular diameter in the Nyquist plot of the EIS data among the phosphide catalysts tested (Figure 5c), showing the lowest charge transfer resistance during catalytic processes. In terms of stability under HER conditions, Figure 5d displays how CoMoP suffered a minor change i he LSV curves after 3000 cycles. Additionally, the CA measurement showed the current density to decrease just 6% after 100 h of continuous operation under HER conditions at an overpotential 89 mV (Figure 5e). The morphology and composition of the catalyst after long-term HER are displayed in Figure S11. In this case, minor changes in structure and a moderate P loss wer observed, which points to notable catalyst stability under HER.\nFigure 5. (a) HER polarization curves in 1.0 M KOH.

Conclusions\nIn conclusion, ultrathin CoMoP nanosheets were engineered using the Co\u2013MOF ZIF67 as a self-sacrificial template and ammonium molybdate as a shape-defining agent and Mo source. CoMoP nanosheets exhibited outstanding performance towards HER and OER in alkaline media, which we associate with the proper transport properties and electronic energy levels provided by their composition and their porous nanosheet structure. In particular, CoMoP presented low overpotentials of 89 and 273 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, CoMoP electrocatalysts also showed excellent long-term stabilities in alkaline electrolytes, with a minor current density decrease after 100 h continuous operation. When used for OWS, a cell voltage of only 1.56 V was needed to reach a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. This work provides a suitable strategy to synthesize high-performance Co\u2013Mo\u2013P electrocatalysts with abundant exposed active sites and effective avenues for charge and electrolyte transport, and it can be\nFigure 6.
