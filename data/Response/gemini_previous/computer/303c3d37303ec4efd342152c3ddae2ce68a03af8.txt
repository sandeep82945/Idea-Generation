1. **Exploring the use of different depth estimation methods:** The paper uses the MiDaS model for depth estimation, but there are other depth estimation methods available that may produce more accurate or detailed depth maps. Future research could investigate the impact of using different depth estimation methods on the quality of the stylized images.


2. **Investigating the use of different style transfer models:** The paper uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model for style transfer, but there are other style transfer models available that may produce different or improved results. Future research could investigate the impact of using different style transfer models on the quality of the stylized images.


3. **Exploring the use of different loss functions:** The paper uses a combination of style loss and content loss to optimize the stylized image, but there are other loss functions that could be used. Future research could investigate the impact of using different loss functions on the quality of the stylized images.


4. **Investigating the use of different regularization techniques:** The paper does not use any regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, but there are several regularization techniques that could be used. Future research could investigate the impact of using different regularization techniques on the quality of the stylized images.


5. **Exploring the use of the proposed method for other applications:** The paper demonstrates the use of the proposed method for image editing and virtual reality, but there are other applications where the method could be used. Future research could investigate the use of the proposed method for other applications, such as architectural visualization, entertainment and animation, and robotics.
