            "text": "Page 2/20\nIntroduction Fluoride is one of the most important ingredients in su cient amounts to have bene cial effects on bones and teeth. However, intake of excessive uoride poses serious threats to human health and the environment. Prolonged use of high uoride water affects calcium and phosphorus assimilation resulting in uorosis of bones and teeth. It can also cause infertility and anemia (Cai et al. 2018; Demelash et al. 2019; Dessalegne et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2019). Drinking water sources in several countries, including Ethiopia and India, do not meet the WHO standard for uoride of 1.5 mg/L (Cai et al. 2018; Haseena et al. 2017). Hence, it is crucial to remove uoride from water to avoid environmental and health risks.\nThere are various de uorination methods such as adsorption, ion exchange, chemical precipitation, activated carbon treatment, membrane separation, advanced oxidation technology, etc. Among these, adsorption is low cost, easy to operate, and has attracted much attention owing to several advantages. Adsorption is a physico-chemical process that occurs at the interface of two phases. It is the principal separation technology that helps the selective removal of the substance under investigation from multicomponent in the solution. Development of tailored and functionalized adsorbents is very important in advancing adsorption science (Chubar et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019). Wide array of materials have been reported for uoride removal, including aluminum oxide-based sorbents (He et al. 2019), carbon-based sorbents (Velazquez-Jimenez et al. 2014), zeolite-based adsorbents (Yang et al. 2022) and iron-based sorbents (Cai et al. 2018). However, these materials are associated with the disadvantages of low adsorption e ciencies, interference due to other ions, separation problems, limited pH range, and very low regeneration cycle (Dhillon et al. 2017).\nPage 3/20\nActivated alumina is one of the extensively employed materials for adsorption of uoride from water to ensure drinking water safety. However, several inherent defects of activated alumina, such as narrow optimum pH (4-5), chemical instability at acidic or basic pH, easy clogging during prolonged operation, and di culty in regeneration, resulting in limited applications of activated alumina for de uoridation in real world conditions (Ju et al. 2016; Zarei et al. 2017). Activated carbon, with a native (unmodi ed) surface, is a poor adsorbent for removing uoride from water and requires modi ers with high uoride a nity (Velazquez-Jimenez et al. 2014). Hence, it is signi cant to develop an e cient and reusable adsorbent that can be applied over a wide pH and temperature ranges.\nPresently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have received much attention because of their extraordinary anion exchange performances and are reported as a special type of adsorbent known to be as nextgeneration anion exchangers (Cai et al. 2018; Chubar et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019). They are expressed with the general formula of [M1-xIIMx(OH)2]x+(An-)x/n.yH2O, where MII, MIII, An- and x represent divalent cation, trivalent cation, anion and MIII/(MII+MIII) ratio, respectively. They possess two main parts, the layers and the interlayers and can be denoted in short form as [LcDXLcD]n where L and D denote hydroxide anion layers, c denotes metal cation layers, and X represents interlayers such as anions like CO32-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, etc. and neutral molecules like H2O. Due to interlayer anions, they are also commonly known as anionic clay minerals. They can be found naturally or produced synthetically (Forano et al. 2013; Mishra et al. 2018).\nRecently, several papers have proposed high-valent Rare-earth elements such as Ce, Zr, and La as modi ers of adsorbents that can complex with uoride ion or provide an active site for ion-exchange to improve the de uoridation performance of adsorbents (Cai et al. 2018). Only some of the studies containing Ce such as Ce-MOFs (Tang et al. 2023), Ce-AlOOH (Tao et al. 2020), CeO2/SiO2 (Lin et al. 2018), and Fe-Al-Ce (Wu et al. 2007) have been reported to have promising uoride removal e ciencies. Compared to other rare-earth elements Ce modi cation is largely believed to meaningfully enhance uoride removal (Tao et al. 2020). Ce4+-containing Ni-Al LDHs have not been reported so far for uoride removing from aqueous solutions to the best of our knowledge.\nThus, in this study Ni-Al-Ce LDHs nanoparticle were synthesized using different Ce amounts (5%, 10% and 20% of Al) using co-precipitation method synthesis to improve the capacity, effectiveness and selectivity of the primary sorbent. The resulting materials were characterized by a wide range of techniques, and the de uoridation performance of Ni-Al-Ce LDHs against the amount of adsorbent, initial uoride concentration, pH, temperature and variety of competing anions was evaluated. Furthermore, the reusability was investigated, and the modi cation mechanism induced by Ce doping was established with help of in-depth characterization of used adsorbents.\nExperimental Section Synthesis\u00a0\nPage 4/20\nIn this study, Ni-Al-Ce LDHs were synthesized through a co-precipitation method using the respective inorganic salts. The molar ratios of Ni:Al:Ce used in the synthesis were 0.75:0.25:0, 0.75:0.2375:0.0125, 0.75:0.225:0.025, 0.75:0.2125:0.0375, and 0.75:0.2:0.05, denoted as Ni-Al-Ce-0, Ni-Al-Ce-5, Ni-Al-Ce-10, and Ni-Al-Ce-20, respectively. Throughout the synthesis process, the pH was maintained at 10 (Sokol et al. 2019; Wagassa et al. 2023).\u00a0\nAdsorption Experiments\nBatch adsorption technique based optimization of one parameter at a time was performed by varying pH, adsorbent dose, initial concentration, contact time, agitation rate and temperature using Ni-Al-Ce LDHs. The adsorption e ciencies of the synthesized Ce4+ doped Ni-Al LDHs were compared in the rst set of tests. Once the best performing LDH was identi ed, it was used for further studies. Adsorption experiments were carried out by adding appropriate quantity of the adsorbent into 40 mL of a uoride solution of desired initial concentration prepared in deionized water in polypropylene conical asks. The time (15 \u2013 120 min), solution pH (3 \u2013 11), adsorbent concentration (0.25 \u2013 1.25 g/L), F- concentration (10 to 60 mg/L), agitation rate (50 \u2013 250 rpm) and solution temperature (25 \u2013 55 \u00b0C) were varied to investigate their effect on the uoride ions removal e ciency. Fluoride ion selective electrode was used for determination of concentration of uoride ions after ltration through 0.45\u03bcm nylon syringe lter.\nThe uoride uptake capacity and removal percentage were determined using the following respective equations:\nwhere Co (mg/L), Ce (mg/L), Qe (mg/g) and m (g) are initial concentration, equilibrium concentration, adsorption capacity and weight of the adsorbent, respectively.\nAdsorption Isotherms and Kinetics\u00a0\nAdsorption isotherms of uoride were investigated at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mg/L initial concentrations by the addition of 1.25 g/L of LDH to 40 mL of uoride ion solutions and shaking at 200 rpm in a controlled incubating shaker for equilibration time. To delineate the adsorption mechanism, various isotherm models including Freundlich, Temkin, Jovanovic and Langmuir isotherm models were employed.\nThe adsorption kinetics was determined by conducting adsorption experiments at different contact times using 40 mL of uoride solution mixed with 1.25 g/L of adsorbent at a temperature of 25 oC and shaken\nPage 5/20\nvigorously at the corresponding contact times. The resulting residual F- concentrations were used in modeling the adsorption kinetics using pseudo- rst order and pseudo-second order rate equations.\nCoexisting Ions Effect\nAnions such as sulfate, chloride and nitrate are commonly found in uoride-contaminated water. They compete with F- for active adsorption sites, thus reducing the removal e ciency of the adsorbent (Zhang et al. 2015). The in uence of these anions on the uoride removing e ciency was also investigated at naturally occurring concentrations of 5 to 20 mg/L to establish the applicability of the material in real world conditions.\nRegeneration Experiments\nThe regeneration study is signi cant because it demonstrates the potential of Ce4+ doped Ni-Al LDH materials for removing of uoride ions. Additionally, the ability to regenerate the materials multiple times without reducing their capacity for uoride adsorption is an important factor for their use in practical applications (Suh et al. 2020).\u00a0\nTo test the adsorbent renewability, 20 mg of the synthesized nanomaterial was placed in a plastic conical ask. Then, 40 mL of a solution comprising 10 mg/L of F- was transferred to the ask. The resulting mixture underwent shaking at a speed of about 150 per minute for 1 hour at 25 \u00baC.\nAfter each adsorption process, the adsorbent was separated from the solution through ltration using Whatman lter paper 42. Then the separated adsorbent was washed using 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, followed by washing with deionized (DI) water. Finally, the washed adsorbent was dried overnight at a temperature of 110 \u00baC for reuse. These regeneration steps were repeated for a total of four cycles, meaning that the adsorbent was regenerated and reused four times.\nResult and Discussion\nCe-doped Ni-Al LDHs Characterizations for Adsorption of Fluoride According to the XRD investigation depicted in Fig.\u00a01A, the as-synthesized Ni-Al-Ce LDHs exhibited distinct diffraction patterns at speci c angles. The observed peaks occur at 11.47\u00b0, 23.12\u00b0, 34.94\u00b0, 39.22\u00b0, 61.0\u00b0, and 62.32\u00b0, can be related to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (110), and (113) crystal planes, respectively. These planes are associated with the hydrotalcite-like structure of the LDHs, as per the JCPDS reference code 00-015-0087. The presence of crystal planes (012), (015), (018), and (110) in the Ni-Al-Ce LDHs indicates a hexagonal coordination with rhombohedral 3R symmetry. (George & Saravanakumar 2018; Hanif et al. 2019; Jitianu et al. 2013; Wagassa et al., 2023).\nPage 6/20\nIn Fig.\u00a01A, it is evident that as the amount of Ce4+ dopant increased, the diffraction peaks slightly shifted to lower 2\u03b8, the d-spacing increased (Table S1) and the intensity of the peaks decreased. Again, upon increasing Ce4+, secondary phases appeared in addition to the LDH phases. All these may be due to that the ionic radius of Ce4+ (0.87 \u00c5) is larger than that of Al3+ (0.39 \u00c5) (Liao 2006).\nThe Ni-Al-Ce LDHs chemical compositions were also investigated using ATR-IR. The ATR-IR spectrum is shown in Fig.\u00a01B. The intensi ed ATR-IR peak at 3400 cm\u2212 1 can be attributed to the vibrational stretching of O-H groups of the layer hydroxides, and H2O molecules in interlayer (dos Santos et al. 2013; Karami et al. 2019). The peak at about 1619 cm\u2212 1 is because of the bending vibration of the H2O molecules (Jabeen et al. 2017; Karami et al. 2019). The peak at 1361 cm\u2212 1 may be related to vibration of the carbonate interlayer anion (George and Saravanakumar 2018; Jabeen et al., 2017; Karami et al., 2019; Lei et al. 2017). The band at about 1106 cm\u2212 1 can be speci cally assigned to Ce-O-Ce vibration in the Cedoped Ni-Al LDHs, which is not present in the pristine LDH (Aponte et al. 2020). The intensi ed peak in the low-frequency region found at 556 cm\u2212 1 can be associated with metal\u2013oxygen-metal and oxygen-metal\u2013 oxygen bending vibrational modes as in the case of Ni-O or Al-O or Ce-O or Ni-Al-O or Ni-Ce-O vibrational modes (George and Saravanakumar 2018; Jabeen et al. 2017; Ouyang et al. 2021).\nXPS was utilized to analyze the composition and electronic state of Ce4+ doped Ni-Al LDH. The survey scan XPS spectrum clearly displayed characteristic features of elements in Ni-Al LDH, and an additional signal in the binding energy range of 870 to 930 eV corresponding to the Ce 3d state. This observation indicates successful incorporation of Ce into the Ni-Al LDH matrix (Fig.\u00a02) (Gao et al. 2021). The Ni 2p spin-orbit doublets were evident in the spectrum, with peak positions at 856.24 and 874 eV, and their shakeup signals appeared at 861.91 and 881.41 eV, con rming the presence of Ni2+ ions (Fig.\u00a02B) (Li et al. 2018; S. Wu et al. 2017). The peaks of Al 2p were observed at 68.19 and 73.65 eV, which correspond to Al 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively (Fig.\u00a02C) (Lei et al. 2017). Furthermore, the high-resolution spectrum spanning from 870 to 925 eV in the Ce 3d region provided further evidence for the presence of Ce4+ ions in the sample (Fig.\u00a02D) (Gao et al. 2021).\nThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ce-doped Ni-Al LDHs synthesized through coprecipitation at pH 10 are presented in Fig. S1. The images reveal that the synthesized LDHs exhibit a distinct morphology characterized by irregular particle structures. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that these irregular particles are agglomerations of very small sheet-like grains, arranged in a layered morphology. The observed morphologies of the synthesized Ce-doped Ni-Al LDHs are consistent with those previously reported for LDHs synthesized under similar conditions (Xu et al. 2018). The irregular particle shapes and layered structure are indicative of the crystalline nature of the LDHs, with the layers stacked on top of one another. The sheet-like grains within the LDH structure likely arise from the growth of individual layers during the co-precipitation process.\nFigure\u00a03 displays TEM and HRTEM images of the Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH samples. The TEM analysis of Ce4+-containing Ni/Al LDH revealed the presence of nanoplates with a distinct morphology, forming\nPage 7/20\naggregates of superimposed multilayer structure (Fig.\u00a03A). Furthermore, the HRTEM analysis provided insight into the internal structure of the discrete nano-plates, revealing the presence of a number of nanosheets within each plate (Fig.\u00a03B). The Ce-doped LDH exhibited a hexagonal plate-like morphology, comprised of numerous superimposed nanosheets with an average size of approximately 11.51 nm. Moreover, HRTEM examination displayed lattice fringes with d-spacing values of 0.26 and 0.2298, related to the (012) and (015) crystallographic planes, respectively (Fig.\u00a03C). These results con rm the presence of particles of sheet-like with a structural phase of hexagonal, indicative of the layered structure of Ni-Al LDH, which aligns with the ndings from XRD (Fig.\u00a01A) and SEM (Fig. S1) investigations. The corresponding SAED patterns shown in Fig.\u00a03D provided further insight into the Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH nanosheets. These patterns clearly demonstrated the polycrystalline nature of the Ce-doped LDH, indicating the presence of multiple crystal domains within the nanosheets. Our ndings correlate with other reports (Li et al. 2018; Wagassa et al. 2023; Wu et al. 2017).\nAdsorbent properties, including speci c surface area and pore sizes, play a decisive role in adsorption processes. BET textural features of Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH were determined. These results of BET are presented in Table S2. They were evaluated to understand the structural properties of these LDH nanomaterials. Accordingly, the Ni-Al-Ce-0 sample exhibited surface area of 2.30 m2/g, pore volume of 0.0015 cm3/g, as well as an average pore size of 13.44 nm. On the other hand, the Ni-Al-Ce-5 sample displayed signi cantly higher values for surface area (25.85 m2/g) and pore volume (0.054 cm3/g) with a reduced average pore size of 4.21 nm. The observed differences in textural characteristics between the pristine and doped samples can be attributed to the presence of Ce in the Ni/Al LDH matrix. Ce is known to possess catalytic properties and can enhance the textural properties of pristine materials, like surface area and pore volume, due to its ability to modify surface chemistry and morphology. Previous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of cerium addition on the textural characteristics of catalysts (Kim et al. 2020). The signi cant increase in surface area as well as pore volume observed in Ni-Al-Ce LDH sample suggests a higher accessibility of active sites, which can enhance its performance in various catalytic applications. The reduction in average pore size indicates a more re ned pore structure, potentially facilitating mass transfer and improving the overall catalytic e ciency (Wang et al. 2014). Therefore, these ndings highlight the potential of cerium as a promoter to improve the textural properties of materials, thereby enhancing their adsorption performance.\nThe thermal stability of the as-prepared Ni-Al-Ce LDH was examined using TG-DCS, and its thermogram is shown in Fig. S2. The decomposition of the LDH sample as indicated in the thermogram produces a twostep mass loss peak, and a corresponding endothermic peak is observed on the DSC curve. A total mass loss of about 31% was observed. The rst mass loss of about 12.5% has happened in the range of 36 to 300\u00b0C at the endothermic peak of 175 oC. This loss of mass could be ascribed to the removal of adsorbed and interlayer H2O. The second stage mass loss of about 18.5% happened at about 395 oC endothermic peak in the range of 300 to 550 oC, and this could be because of the dehydroxylation of the hydroxide layers and the decomposition of interlayer carbonate anions. Large amount of the mass loss of the synthesized LDH happened in this second stage. Above 550\u00b0C, the hydrotalcite-like structure of the\nPage 8/20\nLDH nanoparticles collapsed and produced mixed metal oxides. There was no signi cant change in mass after 550\u00b0C, indicating that the conversion of LDH to oxide was complete (Smalenskaite et al. 2017). Adsorbent Dose, pH, Temperature, and Agitation Speed Effects on Fluoride Removal E ciency To investigate the effect of pH, initial concentration, contact time, adsorbent dose, temperature and agitation speed on the adsorption e ciency of uoride on Ce-doped Ni-Al LDHs, batch adsorption technique was used. The adsorption e ciencies of LDHs were compared in the rst set of tests in which Ni-Al-Ce-5 LDH was identi ed as the best performing LDH and it was used for further studies.\nThe Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH with different doses (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25 and 1.5 g/L) were studied for the adsorption e ciency of F\u2212 from aqueous solution of initial concentration of 10 mg/L uoride at 25 oC stirring at 200 rpm for a contact time of 60 min.\nThe result in Fig.\u00a04A shows that adsorbent exhibit high removal e ciency of more than 92% and which marginally improved from 92.5\u201394.02% with the rise in the adsorbent concentration from 0.25 to 1.25 g/L, while it decreased when the adsorbent weight was further increased. As proved in previous literature, increasing the adsorbent dosage can increase the removal of uoride ions as number of sites available for adsorbent\u2013adsorbate interaction increase. A further increase in the concentration of adsorbent makes restrictions to mass transfer of uoride, and consequently minimizes the number of active adsorption sites. An increase in adsorbent dosage may also lead to adsorbent aggregation, and consequently, a decrease in available adsorbent sites (Mullick and Neogi 2019).\nTo investigate the pH effect on uoride adsorption e ciency, experiments were performed at pH values between 3 and 11 with an initial concentration of 10 mg/L, adsorbent dosage of 1.25 g/L, temperature of 25\u00b0C, and interaction time of 60 min. The result of pH effect on uoride adsorption is given in Fig.\u00a04B. As the result indicates, the removal e ciency decreased slightly from pH 3 to pH 5, then remained constant up to pH 9 and decreased beyond that. Thus, it can be witnessed that the as-synthesized LDH has a wide range of pH stability and removal e ciency.\nThe in uence of temperature on adsorption e ciency of uoride (10 mg/L) was tested using 1.25 g/L adsorbent at 200 rpm in the range from 25 to 55\u00b0C, and the results are presented in Fig.\u00a04C. The results showed that throughout this range the effect of temperature was found to be negligible, and the material showed a large range of thermal stability.\nThe in uence of stirring rate was also conducted by changing the stirring rate from 50 to 250 rpm using an incubator shaker with 10 mg/L (initial concentration), 1.25 g/L (adsorbent concentration), 60 min (contact time), and 25 \u00baC (temperature). Experimental results showed the removal e ciency increased signi cantly as the stirring speed increased up to 200 rpm (Fig.\u00a04D). The increase in stirring rate results in the dispersion of adsorbent particles in aqueous solution which can minimize the boundary layer for mass transfer and enhances the uoride removal e ciency.\nPage 9/20\nHowever, after 200 rpm, the e ciency of uoride removal decreased with increasing stirring rate. This was happened due to the higher the stirring rate, the faster the adsorbate movement and the adsorbent kinetic energy and this leads to the temporary entrapment of F\u2212 to the surface of adsorbent. Therefore, the loosely attached adsorbates began to separate from the surface of adsorbent. Again, high agitation may create a vortex which may decrease the uoride-adsorbent interaction. A similar study by Mondal and Roy (2016) also reported that increasing agitation rate beyond 200 rpm reduced the uoride removal e ciency by MWCNTs.\nKinetics and Isotherm Study of the Adsorption of Fluoride A study showing the impact of interaction time on the e ciency of F\u2212 removing using 1.25 g/L LDH adsorbent in 10 ppm F\u2212 aqueous solution at agitation of 200 rpm and 25 \u00baC temperature is shown in Fig. S3. The results speci ed that the removal e ciency of F\u2212 increased in the rst 60 min, and thereafter there was no signi cant change.\nIt is obvious that the existence of more adsorption sites at the start of the adsorption process allows faster removal because of the more surface area of adsorbent available for uoride adsorption. However, further increase in contact time leads to almost a constant uoride removal rate as the adsorption sites are occupied (El Rouby et al. 2020).\nThe kinetic models such as PFO and PSO were employed to investigate the performance of uoride removing from aqueous solution over a time range of 15 to 120 min, and the results are presented in Fig. S3B and Table S3. CAVS software was employed to nonlinearly t the models. As evidenced from the results, uoride adsorption is slightly better tted by the PSO kinetic model (R2 = 0.999). Thus, the results suggested that the removal mechanism was dominated by PSO kinetics of adsorption, and implying that the process was controlled by the chemisorption process (Ho and McKay 1998).\nExperimental results on the in uence of initial concentration of uoride ion on its removal were tested at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mg/L using 1.25 g/L adsorbent at 25 oC and 200 rpm for 60 min is shown in Fig. S3C. The results revealed that the adsorption e ciency decreased with increasing initial concentration. Similar ndings were previously reported indicating a decrease in uptake when initial concentration increases due to the lling of the adsorbents active sites with increasing initial concentration (El Rouby et al. 2020).\nThe isotherm experimental results obtained over the range of 10 to 60 mg/L concentration are given in Table S4 and Fig. S3D. Isotherm models like Freundlich, Temkin, Langmuir and Jovanovic were employed to determine the effect of initial concentration on the adsorption process. CAVS software was used for tting the experimental results to these models. Experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity was calculated according to Eq.\u00a0(1). The maximum adsorption capacity of Ce-doped Ni/Al LDH was 238.27 mg/g according to Langmuir model and 130.73 mg/g from Jovanovic model. The best tted model provided the maximum adsorption capacity greater than the experimentally result which indicates that\nPage 10/20\nthe tested adsorbent can hold a larger quantity of F\u2212 than those found in solution. According to the R2 values recorded in Table S4, a marginal difference was observed between the three models Freundlich, Langmuir and Jovanovic models. Freundlich was found to t the results somewhat better than other models (Fig. S3D). Otherwise, the adsorption can be explained in terms of the three models. Thus, multilayer (physical) as well as monolayer (chemical) adsorption phenomenon can be observed between Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH and uoride ions. Based on the dimensionless equilibrium parameter (KL) of Langmuir model values of less than unity indicates uoride adsorption by Ce-doped Ni/Al LDH is a favorable process (Langmuir 1918). Co-existing Ions In uence on Removal Effectiveness The in uence of Cl\u2212, NO3\u2212 and SO42\u2212 anions at 5, 10 and 20 mg/L concentrations on the de uoridation performance of Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH is presented in Fig. S4A. The data shows that NO3\u2212 does not signi cantly affect the uoride adsorption performance of Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH when present at lower concentrations, and when its concentration matches that of uoride. This result parallels previous ndings of F\u2212 removal. This may be justi ed by the possible chemical reaction of the AlFx complexes, the precipitation of CeF4 and its complexes being involved in the removal process. Therefore, F\u2212 has a stronger a nity for Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH adsorbents than NO3 (Wei et al. 2020).\nHowever, even though Cl\u2212 and SO42\u2212 signi cantly affect the uoride adsorption performance, the effect of SO42\u2212 is more pronounced. This was due to competitive adsorption on the active sites available on the surface of adsorbent during adsorption process. The sulfate ion has a higher anionic charge than chloride and nitrate ions, and its interfering on uoride adsorption is possibly related to the Coulombic force. The SO42\u2212 in the solution can progressively reside in the active adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface, making the adsorbent unable to take up much of the uoride ion (He et al. 2019; Tao et al. 2020). Therefore, the in uence of these ions on de uoridation may be due to their relatively higher a nity toward LDH. As reported in a previous study, indeed LDH shows a preference for interlayer anions in the order CO32\u2212>> F\u2212/SO42\u2212 > Cl\u2212 > NO3\u2212 (Cavani et al. 1991; Hibino 2018). Expected Mechanisms in Fluoride Adsorption-PostAdsorption Characterizations There are a number of potential mechanisms that could account for the adsorption process based on the ATR-IR analysis and the observed changes in the spectrum following the uoride adsorption by Ce4+containing Ni-Al LDH (Fig. S5B), whereas the adsorption of F\u2212 onto LDH exhibited negligible effects on the lattice structure of the LDH, according to the result from XRD in Fig. S5A. La-doped Li/Al LDH showed similar outcomes (Cai et al. 2018). A few methods, including surface complexation, ion exchange, hydrogen bonding, and ligand exchange, can be proposed based on the results of ATR-IR to aid the uoride adsorption onto Ce4+-containing Ni-Al LDH.\nPage 11/20\nThe disappearance of OH\u2212 peaks suggests that surface complexation reactions may occur during the adsorption process. The uoride ions (F\u2212) likely form complexes with surface hydroxyl groups (OH\u2212) present on the LDH surface, such as HF or H2O-F. These surface hydroxyl groups can act as binding sites for uoride, leading to the formation of surface complexes. The formation of uoride surface complexes can be described by the Lewis acid-base interaction, where the F\u2212 ions act as Lewis bases and the surface hydroxyl groups act as Lewis acids. This interaction involves the donation of electron pairs from uoride ions to vacant sites on the LDH surface, resulting in the formation of stable surface complexes. Additionally, F can form surface complexes with Ce4+ as Ce4+ + 2F \u2192 CeF22+. This formation can be deduced from the absence of a peak at 1106 cm\u2212 1 attributed to vibration of Ce-O-Ce in FT-IR (Fig. S5B). The formation of the CeF22+ complex reduces the amount of free F\u2212 in the solution, contributing to the de uorination process (Kong et al. 2019).\nAnother possible mechanism is ion exchange, where the uoride ions replace other anions (such as hydroxide or carbonate ions) present in the LDH on the surface or in the interlayer. The absence of peaks corresponding to OH and CO32 in the spectrum could indicate the release of these ions upon the adsorption of uoride. This suggests that the uoride ions are exchanging with other anions present on the LDH surface. The Ce4+-doped Ni-Al LDH possesses a layered structure with interlayer anions, such as carbonate ions (CO32\u2212) and OH ions. The uoride ions can potentially replace these interlayer anions through an ion exchange mechanism. During the adsorption process, the uoride ions can exchange places with the carbonate ions (CO32\u2212) and OH in the interlayer spaces of the LDH. This ion exchange process occurs due to the difference in a nity between uoride and other ions for the LDH surface (Liu et al. 2019).\nThe absence of peaks associated with OH in the spectrum of LDH can also suggest the involvement of hydrogen bonding in the adsorption mechanism. Fluoride ions may form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the LDH surface. This type of interaction can contribute to the adsorption of uoride and the subsequent changes observed in the ATR-IR spectrum (Ren et al. 2021).\nThe presence of Ce4+ ions in the LDH structure could have a role in the adsorption mechanism. The F\u2212 may undergo ligand exchange reactions with the Ce4+ ions, forming Ce-F complexes. This interaction could be responsible for the changes observed in the ATR-IR spectrum, indicating the existence of uoride on LDH surface after adsorption (Kong et al. 2019).\nThe layered structure of Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH nanoparticles provides a large surface area for uoride adsorption. The mechanism might involve the interaction between F\u2212 and the active sites of the LDH surface (Ren et al. 2021).\nLDH surface sites + F \u2192 LDHF (Surface adsorption)\nPage 12/20\nThe incorporation of Ce4+ ions into the LDH lattice enhances the surface reactivity and increases the binding sites for uoride ions. Reusability of Ce-doped Ni-Al LDH in Fluoride Adsorption We used 0.1 M NaOH solution as a desorption agent to regenerate Ce4+ doped Ni-Al LDH after uoride adsorption from aqueous solution. We performed a series of adsorption and desorption experiments with the doped LDH, and the obtained results are indicated in Fig. S4B. These results demonstrated that Ce4+ doped Ni-Al LDH could be reused up to four times without signi cant loss of adsorption capacity. This was because the Ce4+ dopant enhanced the reusability of the adsorbent and resulted in uoride removal e ciencies of 92.96%, 84.5%, 78.71%, and 70.76% for the rst four cycles. Therefore, Ce4+ doped Ni-Al LDH showed enhanced regeneration performance.\nThe regeneration performance of LDHs is a crucial factor in their practical applications for removing uoride from aqueous solutions. The study by Tao et al. (2020) investigated the regeneration performance of Ce-AlOOH towards uoride adsorption with 2% and 3% oxalic acid solutions. They found that Ce-AlOOH and Ce-AlOOHoa exhibited good regeneration performance with an average removal e ciencies of 76% and 70%, respectively after ve consecutive regeneration cycles.\nConclusions In conclusion, this study presents the successful synthesis and characterization of a novel nano-sized Ce+ 4-doped Ni-Al LDH material for the de uoridation of aqueous solutions. The Ce-Ni-Al LDH exhibited a well-de ned nanoscale sheet-like morphology, a high surface area, and a strong adsorption capacity towards uoride.\nThe kinetics of the de uoridation process using Ni-Al-Ce LDH followed a PSO model, indicating the mechanism to be chemisorption. Isotherm models, Langmuir, Freundlich and Jovanovic, provided a good tting to the experimental results, indicating multilayer and monolayer adsorption of F\u2212 onto the Ni-Al-Ce LDH surface. The maximum adsorption capacity observed was 238.27 mg/g. The mechanism of uoride removal involved ion exchange, hydrogen bonding and complexation reactions, as con rmed by XRD and ATR-IR analyses.\nFurthermore, the Ni-Al-Ce LDH nanomaterial demonstrated good recyclability, maintaining 71% of its uoride adsorption capacity after four consecutive cycles. This highlights its potential as a sustainable and cost-effective de uoridation agent.\nOverall, the ndings of this study support the use of Ce-doped Ni/Al LDH as an e cient and promising material for uoride removal in water treatment applications. Further research can focus on optimizing the synthesis process, exploring its performance under varying conditions, and assessing its long-term stability to ensure its practical applicability and evaluations in real world conditions.\nPage 13/20\nDeclarations Authors contributions: Ararso Nagari Wagassa: generating the raw data, compiling, interpreting, and manuscript write-up; Amit Bansiwal: supervision, project management, proofreading, editing and technical inputs; To k Ahmed Shifa: supervision, proofreading, editing and technical inputs; Enyew Amare Zerffa: supervision, proofreading, editing and technical inputs\nFunding: The authors declare no funds, grants or other support were received during this manuscript preparation.\nCon icts of Interest Statement: The authors state that they do not have any identi able nancial interests as well as personal associations that could have in uenced the ndings presented in this report.\nEthics approval and consent to participate: Not applicable\u00a0\nConsent for publication: Not applicable\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of CSIR-TWAS and CSIR-NEERI.\nReferences 1.
