1. **Investigate the long-term effects of IRWH and intercropping on soil health and fertility.** This could be done by conducting a longitudinal study that monitors soil properties, such as organic matter content, nutrient levels, and microbial activity, over several growing seasons. This information would help to determine the sustainability of IRWH and intercropping practices in the long term.


2. **Evaluate the economic feasibility of IRWH and intercropping for smallholder farmers.** This could be done by conducting a cost-benefit analysis that compares the costs of implementing IRWH and intercropping with the benefits in terms of increased crop yields and reduced risk of crop failure. This information would help to determine whether IRWH and intercropping are economically viable options for smallholder farmers.


3. **Explore the potential of IRWH and intercropping to mitigate climate change.** This could be done by conducting a study that measures the carbon sequestration potential of IRWH and intercropping systems. This information would help to determine the role that IRWH and intercropping can play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change.


4. **Develop decision support tools to help farmers adopt IRWH and intercropping practices.** This could be done by developing computer models or mobile apps that provide farmers with information on the best IRWH and intercropping practices for their specific conditions. These tools could help farmers to make informed decisions about how to implement IRWH and intercropping in their fields.


5. **Conduct research on the social and cultural factors that influence the adoption of IRWH and intercropping practices.** This could be done by conducting surveys and interviews with farmers to understand their perceptions of IRWH and intercropping, as well as the factors that influence their decisions to adopt or reject these practices. This information would help to develop more effective strategies for promoting the adoption of IRWH and intercropping among smallholder farmers.
