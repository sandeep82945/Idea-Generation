    "abstractText": "The microwave backscattering model is one of the most effective tools for surface soil moisture (SSM) inversion, which has strong theoretical support, but the inverse problem is difficult to solve. Advance in artificial intelligence offers possibilities to learn complex nonlinear relationships in a data-driven way, but it lacks physical mechanism. To combine the advantages of model-driven and data-driven methods, an SSM inversion approach that couples the AIEM-Oh model with deep neural networks (DNNs) was proposed in this study. DNNs with different inputs were trained with a large number of simulation data generated from the AIEM-Oh model, thus embedding physical mechanisms in the data-driven scheme. Two field experiments at different scales were carried out to evaluate the performances of the proposed approach over bare surfaces. The effects of polarization modes and prior knowledge of surface roughness on SSM inversion were explored, and the accuracy of the approach was compared with the existing methods. The results suggest that satisfactory accuracy was obtained by the proposed approach, the RMSE between the measured and estimated values of SSM was 0.03\u20130.04 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 with prior knowledge of soil roughness, and the RMSE was 0.08\u20130.10 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 without the prior soil roughness information. VV polarization was more sensitive to SSM over bare surfaces than VH polarization. Moreover, the approach showed stable performance in different experimental regions. The results demonstrate the capability and reliability of the coupled approach for SSM inversion over bare surfaces.",

Conventionally, SSM is measured through in-situ field observations by gravimetric method, time-domain reflectometry, and cosmic-ray neutron method [3], [4], [5]. However, it is difficult to obtain SSM at large spatial scales because in-situ observations require a massive investment of time and manpower. Fortunately, the rapid development of remote sensing technology provided a more efficient and cost-effective way for the investigation of SSM at different scales [6], [7]. Compared with optical remote sensing, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has strong application potential in SSM retrieval because it can provide continuous observations independent of weather conditions such as clouds, rain, and fog. More importantly, the unique sensitivity between microwave backscattering coefficient (MBC) and soil dielectric properties makes SAR remote sensing the most promising way for SSM retrieval [8], [9], [10], [11]. Ma et al. [12] explored the sensitivity of soil parameters related to MBC with a global sensitivity analysis method and the advanced integral equation model (AIEM). Ezzahar et al. [13] employed the support vector machine technique to retrieve SSM by using SAR data. Comprehensive evaluations of SSM retrieval models were made by Kumar et al. [14] using Sentinel-1A satellite images. SAR systems with high spatiotemporal resolution have been frequently used for the retrieval and mapping of SSM [15], [16].\nThe inherent complexity of microwave backscattering mechanisms makes the simulation of MBC a difficult issue. To address this problem, empirical models, semiempirical models, and theoretical models have been proposed. The empirical and semiempirical models such as the Oh model and the Dubois model established relationships between SSM and MBC by using specific datasets and statistical analysis methods, which have limitations in modeling surface backscattering for different surface profiles, as these models were established on specific datasets, the performance is not well as expected when soil mechanical composition and surface roughness condition changes [17], [18]. While theoretical models such as the integral equation model (IEM) and the AIEM were built on a strict foundation of physical mechanisms and can clearly reflect the characteristics of the interaction between electromagnetic fields and bare surfaces [19], [20], [21]. Despite the complexity of theoretical models, they are often regarded as the most effective tools for MBC simulation under a variety of surface conditions [22].\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nThe AIEM is the most widely recognized theoretical model in the field of SAR remote sensing [23], which describes the forward physical process of the backscattering of the land surface over a wide range of sensor configurations and surface conditions. For copolarization, the applicability of the AIEM in SSM retrieval has been extensively verified, while for crosspolarization, the AIEM is usually not effective for MBC simulation as the model ignores the multiple scattering effects [24]. The Oh model described the semiempirical relationships between SSM and MBC of copolarization and cross-polarization using a large measured database. It has been reported that the Oh model can provide accurate simulations of MBC for cross-polarization, while it does not perform as well as the AIEM under copolarization [25], [26]. Therefore, the combination of the AIEM and the Oh model is considered as an effective way for MBC simulation over bare surfaces [13], [27].\nThe inversion process is a challenging task for the modeldriven method due to the possible ill-posed inversion issue and the complexity of the SAR backscattering mechanism [28], [29], [30]. Eliminating the influence of surface roughness has always been an essential part to resolve ill-conditioned situations. Conventionally, field observation is the predominant way for obtaining surface roughness parameters in the field of SAR-based SSM inversion. Although there have been advancements in the development of surface roughness inversion methods by using SAR data with multiple polarizations, frequencies, and angles, the difficulty in data acquisition and the complexity of inversion methods restrict their application [31], [32].\nTo address the limitations of traditional statistical algorithms when dealing with complex inversion problems, data-driven machine learning algorithms (ML) have been extensively used with great capabilities in modeling complex nonlinear relationships [33]. Deep learning (DL), as a subset of ML, exhibits superior performance than traditional ML in multiple aspects [34], [35], [36], [37]. As an important branch of DL, deep neural network (DNN) can be described as a collection of neurons organized in a sequence of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer, where the neurons receive input signals from the previous layer and perform computation. The traditional ML networks are shallow structure algorithms, which are insufficient to express complex relationships with a limited number of computing units, while DNN can learn deep features from massive data by increasing the number of fully-connected hidden layers and units in a single layer. With sufficient training data, DNN is able to handle problems with high degrees of nonlinearity and complexity between input and output variables, and potentially provide more accurate results while tackling the issues of overfitting through various approaches [38], [39]. However, the data-driven method focuses on learning and establishing the internal relationships from large amounts of data, it is essentially a black box, lacking physical mechanism support and interpretability. Therefore, networks trained on datasets obtained from a specific study area often perform poorly when applied to other regions.\nPhysical models have strict theoretical basis, but the numerous parameters and complex structure make it difficult to invert target parameters. DNN has superior capabilities in modeling complex nonlinear relationships, which can quickly establish\nthe connection between independent and dependent variables, achieving accurate inversion of target parameters. Therefore, considering the model-driven method and embedding it into the data-driven process will benefit from prior knowledge to optimize the inversion results, as well as improve modeling efficiency, prediction accuracy, and generalization ability.\nInspired by this, an SSM inversion approach was proposed by coupling the AIEM-Oh model and DNN in this study. First, a synthetic database containing 1 02 000 sets of data was generated by using the physical model-driven method. Next, in order to increase data authenticity, two Gaussian random noise scenarios were designed for the synthetic database to avoid the issue that the data-driven DNNs trained on the synthetic database are not robust when applied to real scenarios. Based on the Sentinel-1A dual-polarized data and in-situ ground observation data in different regions, the performances of the DNNs with different combinations of input parameters in SSM inversion were compared and evaluated. Finally, SSM maps were generated with the proposed approach and the result of this study was compared with previous research."

A single Sentinel-1 satellite can complete a global observation every 12 days in ascending or descending pass, and the two-satellite constellation is able to produce global observations with a revisit period of 6 days. The Sentinel-1 satellite is equipped with a C-band SAR instrument with a frequency of 5.4 GHz. Copolarization and cross-polarization images with 5\u201340 m spatial resolution can be obtained in all weather conditions.\nIn this study, Sentinel-1A level 1 ground range detected data of interferometric wide imaging mode on June 21, 2021 and June 21, 2022 were acquired through the European Space Agency (ESA, https://scihub.copernicus.eu/). The SAR image was taken on an ascending orbit and the incidence angle (\u03b8) was between 31.05\u00b0 to 35.82\u00b0, which was calculated by linearly interpolating the incidence values at the near range and far range and assuming flat topography. Both VV and VH polarization signals were obtained for SSM inversion in this study. The main preprocessing steps of SAR data were shown in Fig. 1. The refined Lee speckle filter with a 5 \u00d7 5 window size was applied to eliminate the speckle noise while preserving the edge information, and the SRTM 3Sec DEM data was used for terrain correction. The MBC (\u03c3\u00b0) was derived according to pixel size,\nlocal incidence angle, and DN value. All preprocessing procedures were performed using SNAP 8.0. After preprocessing, the spatial resolution of Sentinel-1A image is 10 m and the geographic registration error is less than 0.5 pixels.\nB. In-situ Ground Observations\nTwo experimental areas located in the North China Plain and the Nanyang Basin, respectively, were selected to conduct in-situ ground observations [Fig. 2(a)]. Located in the alluvial plain of the Yellow River, Yuanyang County is one of the most important agricultural regions in the North China Plain with flat terrain and a warm temperate continental monsoon climate. The average temperature is 21\u00b0C and the annual average precipitation is 573.3 mm. Alluvial soil is the most widely distributed soil type in this region. A county-scale observation experiment was conducted on June 21\u201322 in 2021, 43 in-situ observation sites were evenly distributed over an area of 1022 km2 [Fig. 2(b)].\nGoulin town is located in the middle of the Nanyang basin, it is a key development area of the national agricultural industry of China. The soil type is mainly yellow-cinnamon soil, with an annual precipitation of 723 mm and a temperature of 15.1\u00b0C. A field-scale observation experiment was conducted on June 21 in 2022, 24 sampling sites were arranged in the experiment, and each sampling site corresponded to an individual plot as far as possible [Fig. 2(c)]. For both experiments, the observation date is simultaneous with the sensing date of Sentinel-1A satellite. At the time of in-situ experiments, winter wheat has been completely harvested and summer maize was unseeded. The land surface can be approximated as bare surfaces since there was almost no vegetation cover.\nThe SSM was measured by the Field Scout TDR 350 (Spectrum, United States) with 7.5 cm probes. In the measurement process, 5 sampling points were selected evenly within a 10 m radius of each in-situ observation site, the SSM of each point was measured 3 times by TDR 350, and the average value of 15-time measurements was calculated as the SSM of the observation site. The gravimetric sampling method was also adopted to measure SSM to verify the accuracy of TDR, as well as to calculate soil\ntexture parameters such as soil bulk density, and sand-silt-clay percentages. Three soil samples (0\u201310 cm) were randomly collected around the sample site with steel cylinders of 200 cm3. The samples were weighed immediately after collection, then heated in the laboratory at 105 \u00b0C for at least 10 h and weighed again, the average value of SSM and bulk density of each site were calculated. The sand and clay percentages were measured by using Malvern 2000 soil laser particle size analyzer.\nSoil surface roughness was measured by a simplified reference scaling whiteboard and digital camera, the root mean square height (s) and correlation length (l) were calculated by a computer vision technique (Fig. 3). Detailed information about the method can be referred to [40]. In order to verify the accuracy of the computer vision technique for soil roughness measurement, a traditional scale plate of the same size is also used to observe the roughness of each sample point [Fig. 3(b)]. Fig. 3(c) suggested that the results of the two methods are quite consistent. Both the two field observation experiments were conducted in agricultural regions, where the land is plowed before crop planting, resulting in relatively rough surface conditions. The quantitative details about the measured parameters are shown in Table I. The UniStrong GPS device was used to mark the accurate latitude and longitude information of sample sites to ensure spatial agreement between the in-situ ground observation data and Sentinel-1A images."

Establishing an accurate correspondence between the soil dielectric constant and SSM is an important part of SSM inversion.

In this study, a dielectric mixing model named the mineralogy-based soil dielectric model (MBSDM) is used\nto convert the soil dielectric constant to SSM. The MBSDM model is developed from the generalized refractive mixing dielectric model and the experimental data.

The DNN architecture generates compositional models where the object is represented as a layered composition of primitives [44]. With multiple hidden layers, a DNN is able to learn abstractions relationships within the data and how the features interact with each other on a nonlinear level. It has been proved that DNNs could model complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network [45], [46], [47].\nThe DNN structure for SSM inversion is composed of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The layer of a DNN consists of several neurons and an activation function. The output of each layer, which is also the input of the next layer, is calculated by the following formula:\nhk = fk ( bk +W khk\u22121 ) (9)\nwhere k is the number of layers, hk is the output of the kth layer, fk is the activation function of the kth layer, bk is the bias of the kth layer, and W k is the matrix of weights of the kth layer. h0 = x, x is the input variable of the network.\nActivation functions are used to add nonlinearity relationships between the input and output variables. Compared with other activation functions, ReLU can alleviate the gradient disappearance problem since the gradient of non-negative interval is constant, so that the convergence rate of the model is maintained in a stable state in DNN training. The formula of the ReLU activation functions is shown in the following:\nReLU (x) = max (0, x) . (10)\nMean absolute error (MAE) is a commonly used cost function to quantify the dissimilarity between the actual value and the predicted value over an entire training dataset, which is calculated as follows:\nMAE =\n\u2211n i=0 |y \u2212 y\u2032|\nn (11)\nwhere y is the actual value of training sample, y\u2032 is the predicted value of a DL framework, and n is the number of training samples.\nThe number of neurons in the hidden layers was adjusted according to the training and validation accuracy of the network, and 64 hidden neurons in each hidden layer give a good estimate of SSM while keeping a reasonable computing time. The ReLU activation function is used in the input layer and hidden layers, the linear function is used in the output layer. MAE is selected as the cost function. The stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm with learning rate = 0.01, decay = 1e-6, and momentum = 0.9 shows the best performance in the networks.\nThe DNNs were built and evaluated using the Keras library on top of Tensorflow in Windows 10 operating system with Intel Core i7-9700 processor, 3.00 GHz CPU, and 32 GB RAM, the processing software is Pycharm.\nFig. 4 shows the scatterplots between the simulated MBC with the measured SSM, incidence angle and surface roughness parameters and the MBC derived from Sentinel-1A image. The results suggest that the RMSE between simulated and observed MBC in VV polarization is 0.71 dB with a bias of \u22120.44 dB for Yuanyang and \u22120.55 dB for Goulin, and the RMSE between the two in VH polarization is 2.13 dB for Yuanyang and 1.47 dB for Goulin with a bias of 1.42 dB and 0.72 dB, respectively. The low error between simulated and observed values of MBC indicated that the AIEM-Oh model could be used to generate the training dataset for DNNs. Similar errors were also found by Baghdadi et al. [48] in different regions with RADARSAT images.\nDue to the systematic and random errors, the simulated MBC of physical models and the observed values from SAR data are not exactly consistent. By analyzing the characteristics of RMSE and Bias between the simulated results of the AIEM-Oh model and the actual values, two Gauss random noise scenarios were designed to add noise to the synthetic database to make it more closely approximate the real MBC (Table II)."

Other factors such as soil texture, soil temperature, and so on are set to fixed values according to the measured data. A number of 1 02 000 sets of surface parameter combinations were generated by a cyclic combination within the range of main variables, and the corresponding MBC was calculated by using the AIEM-Oh model and MBSDM model. The relationships between SSM and MBC under a wide range of conditions are shown in Fig. 6.\nFig. 6(a) suggests that there is a significant positive correlation between MBC and SSM in the case of the same \u03b8, the growth rate of \u03c30vv, \u03c3 0 vh is slowing down with the increase of Mv . When Mv < 0.2 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123, the SAR echo signal is very sensitive to Mv, while the sensitivity of \u03c30vv, \u03c3 0 vh to Mv decreased significantly when Mv > 0.3 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123. This can be attributed to the saturation phenomenon of SAR signal at high SSM. With a certain Mv , the SAR echo intensity decreases gradually with the increase of \u03b8. When soil is moist, the effect of the change in \u03b8 on \u03c30vv, \u03c3 0 vh is reduced, and this phenomenon is more obvious under VH polarization. For a given s, apparent logarithmic relationships between \u03c30vv and Mv , as well as \u03c30vh and Mv were found [Fig. 6(b)]. The MBC of both VV and VH polarization increase and gradually saturated with the increase of Mv. s has significant effects on MBC. At the same Mv , \u03c30vv, \u03c3 0 vh are positively correlated with s when it is less than 2.0 cm, while when s is higher than 2.0 cm, their relationship becomes negative. The main reason is that the surface microwave scattering is dominated by single scattering when s is small, while with the increase of s, the contribution\nof multiple scattering to the total surface scattering increases gradually [49]. Besides, when the surface is rough, the sensitivity of MBC to s decreased significantly due to the saturation of SAR signal.\nFig. 6(c) shows the relationship between Mv and MBC under different l. As Mv increases, \u03c30vv, \u03c3 0 vh grows rapidly at the beginning and then slows down. For the same Mv, the MBC of VV and VH polarization decreases with the increase of l. This can be attributed to that the surface SAR echo signal weakens due to the influence of multiple surface scattering with the decrease in surface roughness [50]. Besides, the backscattering intensity of VV polarization is always higher than that of VH polarization, it is because the VH polarization is more susceptible to multiple scattering of ground objects."

It is observed that DNNs trained with different synthetic databases achieve very high accuracies in validation datasets, but their performances vary significantly in real SSM inversion scenarios. For validation datasets, the DNN trained with the original synthetic database shows the highest accuracy with an RMSE of 0.01 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123. While the accuracies of DNNs trained with noisy synthetic databases decrease, the RMSE of Noise Scenario 1 and Noise Scenario 2 are 0.03 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 and 0.04 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123, respectively.\nThe opposite occurs in test datasets, where the DNN trained with the original AIEM-Oh synthetic database performs poorly with high RMSE (0.08\u20130.10 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123) and positive bias (0.06\u20130.07 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123) in SSM inversion. One reason for this phenomenon is the uncertainty from human errors in field observations and theoretical errors induce discrepancy between the simulated and real MBC over bare surfaces. The other reason might be attributed to that the in-situ observation sites are located in ploughed agricultural fields with relatively large surface roughness, where the MBC is slightly underestimated by the physical model, which leads to a general overestimation of SSM with the networks trained on the original synthetic database. DNNs trained on both noisy synthetic databases perform much better than that trained on the original synthetic database, with a noticeable decrease in RMSE and bias for SSM inversion. The best performance is observed in the DNN trained with Noise\nScenario 2, the RMSE of which is 0.03 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 for Yuanyang and 0.04 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 for Goulin, and the Bias is about 0.01 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 for both regions (Fig. 8).

For each noise scenario, the difference in RMSE between the predicted and measured SSM values between the two areas is less than 0.02 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123, and the bias is nearly identical.

Other pixels including river, settlement, road, and vegetation-covered surfaces are masked so that they are excluded from participating in the subsequent SSM inversion, these pixel values are set to 255, which appear white in SSM maps. For each bare surface pixel, the input variables are \u03b8, s, l, \u03c30vv, \u03c3 0 vh and \u03b8, \u03c3 0 vv, \u03c3 0 vh, respectively, and the output variable is SSM. Results show that the coupled approach could accurately reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of SSM over bare surfaces with prior knowledge of soil roughness. The estimated SSM mainly ranged between 0.1 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 and 0.3 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123, which is consistent with the measured data. The high SSM regions have fragmented distributing characteristics in agricultural areas due to irrigation activities, and areas with low SSM are distributed in the marginal areas of townships, where there is usually reclaimed bare ground for the construction of new residences and factories. Without soil roughness parameters as input, an obvious overestimation was observed and the spatial difference of the estimated SSM is relatively small, which indicates that the surface roughness has a non-negligible effect on the accuracy of SSM inversion in the field of SAR remote sensing. But it is noticed that the coupled approach could still reflect the distribution feature in SSM mapping, it is mainly due to \u03c30vv \u2212 \u03c30vh contains a certain degree of soil roughness information, which contribute to the inversion of SSM."

            "text": "Approaches of SSM inversion by SAR remote sensing over bare surfaces can be divided into five categories, which are 1) change detection method, 2) regression method, 3) iterative optimization method, 4) look-up table method, and 5) neural networks. Table V presents a comparison of the performance of the proposed approach in this study with those of previous researches. It is noticed that the accuracy of the change detection method and neural network (NN) is generally higher than other methods in the field of SSM inversion based on microwave scattering models. The change detection method is established on the assumption of constant surface roughness, which does not valid in agricultural areas. Besides, how to convert the relative SSM obtained by the change detection method to absolute values is a matter of concern [22], [56]. Compared with other NNs, the DNN structure used in this study shows better performance in SSM inversion with an RMSE of 0.03\u20130.04 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 with the prior knowledge of surface roughness and 0.08\u20130.10 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 without surface roughness information. The most important reason is that DNNs have better learning ability and nonlinear modeling capability than traditional shallow NNs. Besides, by adding the Gauss random noise to the training dataset after analyzing the error characteristics between physical simulated MBC and SAR observed MBC over ploughed agricultural surfaces, the accuracy and stability of DNNs in SSM inversion were both improved.\nThe advantages of the proposed approach are not only reflected in the accuracy but also include the following aspects:\n1) the coupled approach utilizes the simulation dataset of the physical model to conduct end-to-end training, which eliminates the complex data analysis and model simplification process for SSM inversion in traditional model-driven methods. 2) DNNs trained on physical models have excellent generalization capabilities, which could be theoretically applied to most bare surfaces with a wide range of soil features."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "An SSM inversion approach coupling model-driven and datadriven methods was proposed in this study, and the capacity of the coupled approach over bare surfaces was explored using Sentinel-1A dual-polarized SAR image and in-situ observation data. According to the model-driven method, it was observed that there were significant logarithmic relationships between \u03c30vv, \u03c30vh and SSM under different condition of \u03b8, s, and l. With the increase of s, the contribution of multiple scattering to total surface scattering increased, which resulted in an underestimation of MBC. By embedding the interpretable information from the physical model into the data-driven DNNs, high SSM inversion accuracies were achieved over bare surfaces.\nThe DNN trained with a synthetic database with Gauss random noise of \u00b11 dB (VV) and \u00b11.5 dB (VH) and using \u03b8, s, l, \u03c30vv , \u03c3 0 vh as inputs showed the best performance in SSM inversion, the RMSE is 0.04 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 for the validation dataset, and 0.03\u20130.04 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 for real datasets. For dualpolarized SAR data, VV polarization mode was more sensitive to SSM than VH polarization, the RMSE of SSM inversion\nresult was 0.04 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 when using VV polarization alone, which was very close to that using VV and VH polarization simultaneously.\nBesides, the prior information on surface roughness had a noticeable influence on SSM inversion results, the RMSE between estimated SSM and measured SSM is 0.03\u20130.04 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 with prior knowledge of soil roughness, and the RMSE was 0.08\u20130.10 cm3 \u00b7 cm\u22123 without the prior soil roughness information. Moreover, the trained DNNs showed stable performances over different experimental areas, which indicated good potential and generalization ability for applying the model-driven and data-driven coupled approach for SSM inversion over bare surfaces.\nBased on Sentinel-1A dual-polarized SAR data, this study has made some efforts in SSM inversion by coupling the modeldriven microwave backscattering model and data-driven DNN, but there are still some points left to be improved. First, measured data from two experimental areas were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed SSM inversion approach in this study, although satisfactory accuracy was observed in both regions, more data are needed to further verify the stability and robustness of the approach. Second, surface roughness parameters in this study were obtained by field observation, which is time-consuming and laborious. Further efforts should be made on the acquisition of soil roughness information to improve the capability of the coupled approach in SSM mapping over large scales. Moreover, how to expand the coupled approach to vegetation-covered surfaces by integrating optical and SAR remote sensing is worth exploring in order to achieve continuous inversion of SSM."
