            "text": "The doctor-patient relationship is another casualty of NHS backlogs The NHS is under intense pressure and doctors need more support handling the repercussions of patients' dissatisfaction, writes Caroline Fryar\nCaroline Fryar director of medical services\nUK doctors are increasingly telling us at the Medical Defence Union (MDU) that pressures on the NHS are eroding the doctor-patient relationship that is so essential for good medical care. In the face of long waiting times for appointments, tests, and elective care, patients\u2019 frustrations are often spilling over into their interactions with healthcare professionals. It has become more common, for instance, for a doctor to spend several minutes of a consultation calming down a disappointed patient and apologising for things that are outside a clinician\u2019s control. This situation isn\u2019t good for patients, who then have less time to discuss their health and receive care, or for healthcare professionals, who feel demoralised and dissatisfied on behalf of their patients.\nThese system pressures are likely to be one factor behind the steep rise in written complaints about the NHS in England.1 Between 2020-21 and 2021-22, complaints about primary care increased by 33 950 (40%)andcomplaints abouthospital andcommunity health services were up by 21 607 (25%). Healthcare staff are trying their best in very challenging circumstances and, understandably, receiving a complaint can have a huge personal impact.\nA survey of 843MDUmembers found that 85%ofGPs and 64% of consultant and hospital doctors felt their relationshipswithpatientshadbecomemore strained over the past two or three years.2 A quarter (26%) had experienced a patient complaint or safety incident, with a fifth (21%) experiencing abuse or threats.\nManaging patient expectations can help to minimise complaints. Thismight involve explaining thatpeople won\u2019t receive a callwith their blood test results unless they are abnormal, for example, or that you are going to refer them to a specialist but there will be a wait to be seen and what they should do if their condition worsens. These conversations can be difficult but help to maintain trust. They do not, however, tackle the root causes of delays in the health service, or fully alleviate patients\u2019 dissatisfaction and the increasing strain on healthcare staff.\nFour in 10 respondents to our survey said they were likely to retire or leave practice in the next five years, while nearly half (48%) had reduced their hours to copewithworkplacepressures.2 Testimony fromstaff on the ground adds to a picture in which workplace stress is forcing some doctors to step back from frontline care for the good of their health.\nFormer obstetrics and gynaecology registrar Sabrina Cardillo, who now works as a MDU medico-legal fellow, explained: \u201cI might have 20 minutes with a new patient but the first five to 10 minutes can be taken up with them upset and sometimes shouting\nat me about the wait to be seen. Many doctors are traumatised now because of covid-19 and need support and yet a lot of the conversation about wellbeing and burnout has focused on building resilience. I think we have passed that point.\u201d\nMany doctors responding to our survey were turning to copingmechanisms, likemindfulness or breathing exercises, to help with workplace pressures. These strategiesmight helpwith symptoms, but it shouldn\u2019t be necessary for people to turn to such techniques to deal with their workload. And they are certainly not a cure for the stress and burnout that doctors are increasingly at risk of. In the GMC's 2022 annual survey of 67 000 UK doctors, two thirds of trainee doctors said they were \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d worn out at the end of their working day, while 44% said they were regularly exhausted in the morning at the thought of another day of work.3 The GMC warned that their analysis of these findings show that 63% of trainees, and 52% of doctors who work as trainers, are at moderate or high risk of burnout.\nMany professional organisations are highlighting these problems and stepping up with support. For example, the Association of Anaesthetists, the Royal College of Anaesthetists, and the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine are running a Fight Fatigue campaign to tackle the negative effects of shift working and fatigue on the NHS workforce. The Royal Medical Benevolent Fund (RMBF) runs a confidential psychotherapy service for doctors alongside theBMA. The MDU supports these initiatives and offers members legal representation if things gowrong and adviceoncomplaintshandling.4 Wecanalso signpost those in need to health and wellbeing resources, including our peer-to-peer support network.5\nThese efforts all help but it is vital that regulators, such as the General Medical Council (GMC), are compassionate andunderstand the realities of current practice. A key test will be the soon to be released update to theGMC\u2019sGoodMedical Practice guidance.\nWe need to frame workplace conditions and staff morale as key pillars in patient safety. An interim report by theHealthcare Safety InvestigationBranch, published in February 2023, found that NHS staff working in urgent and emergency care were experiencing \u201c\u2018significant distress\u201d\u2019 at not being able to help patients.6 The report emphasised the \u201c\u2018strong link\u201d\u2019between staffwellbeing andpatient safety and recommended that staff health and wellbeing be included in the NHS patient safety strategy\u2014 a suggestion the MDU would echo. Regulators, NHS employers, and the government need to recognise and tackle the impact of a demoralised workforce on safe patient care.\n1the bmj | BMJ 2023;381:p934 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.p934\nOPINION"

Ultimately, the government must make good on its pledge to bring down waiting lists and publish a workforce strategy this year that starts to fill the gaps in service provision that are the root cause of many complaints.\nEven with these developments, it could take years to rebuild the health service and restore public confidence in the NHS.
