    "abstractText": "Aflatoxin pollution poses great harm to human and animal health and causes huge economic losses. The biological detoxification method that utilizes microorganisms and their secreted enzymes to degrade aflatoxin has the advantages of strong specificity, high efficiency, and no pollution inflicted onto the environment. In this study, Bacillus subtilis WJ6 with a high efficiency in aflatoxin B1 degradation was screened and identified through molecular identification, physiological, and biochemical methods. The fermentation broth, cell-free supernatant, and cell suspension degraded 81.57%, 73.27%, and 8.39% of AFB1, respectively. The comparative transcriptomics analysis indicated that AFB1 led to 60 up-regulated genes and 31 down-regulated genes in B. subtilis WJ6. A gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the function classifications of cell aggregation, the organizational aspect, and the structural molecule activity were all of large proportions among the up-regulated genes. The down-regulated gene expression was mainly related to the multi-organism process function under the fermentation condition. Therefore, B. subtilis WJ6 degraded AFB1 through secreted extracellular enzymes with the up-regulated genes of structural molecule activity and down-regulated genes of multi-organism process function.",

            "text": "Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus naturally produce secondary mycotoxin metabolites, aflatoxins [1], of which aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most toxic and carcinogenic due to its potential to induce liver toxicity and oxidative stress [2]. AFB1 pollution occurring during the processes of production, harvest, transportation, processing, and the storage of cereals, milk, and nuts usually causes serious public security problems and huge economic losses [3]. To reduce AFB1 contamination in food and feed, various strategies of physical, chemical, and biological approaches have been applied in the removal and degradation of AFB1 [4]. Although physical means (such as high temperature, ultraviolet rays, and microwave) and chemical means (such as ammoniation, neutral electric oxidation water, and sodium sulfite) have been applied in AFB1 degradation and removal, these two approaches have the disadvantages of an excessive energy consumption, serious nutrient loss, and even chemical residue pollution [5\u20137]. The microbial degradation and removal of AFB1 have the advantages of the conversion of toxins into low-toxic or nontoxic products, strong specificity, high efficiency, low energy consumption, and low toxicity without damage to nutrients [8]. The microbial degradation of AFB1 was carried out by microorganisms (such as Bacillus licheniformis [9], Fusarium oxysporum [10], Levilactobacillus brevis [11], and Streptomyces cacaoi [12]) and enzymes (such as catalase [13], laccase [14]). The possible mechanisms of AFB1\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 785. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13070785 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 785 2 of 14\ndegradation and removal are: (1) adsorption by secondary metabolites N-acetylmuramic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, and peptidoglycan in the cell wall [15] and (2) degradation catalyzed by secreted extracellular or intracellular proteins [16]. The reported references with regard to the degradation of AFB1 mainly focused on the specific products of microorganisms, such as the protein extract of Lactobacillus helveticus [17], the extractable oxidase components of Rhodococcus pyridinvorans [18], Bacillus licheniformis extracellular fraction [19], and CotA laccase in B. licheniformis [20]. In practice, microorganisms usually simultaneously degrade and remove AFB1 through various enzymes for degradation and composite components for adsorption [21]. In this study, a strain of Bacillus subtilis WJ6 (B. subtilis WJ6) that degraded AFB1 was isolated and identified. The possible causes for AFB1 degradation were investigated by determining intracellular and extracellular enzymes and other components in the fermentation broth. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of AFB1 degradation by B. subtilis WJ6 was explored based on a comparative transcriptomics approach at the mRNA expression level."

Single colonies were screened on the prepared screening medium. After 12 h, single colonies were picked out for purification and further culture. In the logarithmic phase, the bacterial suspension was used for DNA extraction using Bacterial Genomic DNA Extraction Kit with the following processes. The mixture of binding solution and proteinase K was used to rapidly lyse cells and inactivate nuclease in cells. Additionally, genomic DNA was then selectively adsorbed on the silicon matrix membrane in the centrifuge column in the state of highly disordered salt. Through a series of rapid rinsing centrifugation steps and inhibitor removal, rinsing solutions were used to remove impurities such as cell metabolites and proteins. The low salt elution buffer was used to elute pure genomic DNA from the silicon matrix membrane. The universal primers for the V3 region in the 16S-rRNA gene were F341: 5-CCTACGGG GAGGCAGCAG-3 and R518: 5-ATTACCCGGGCTGG-3.

The microbial degradation of AFB1 was achieved via biological adsorption, living organisms, supernatants, and purified enzyme approaches [30]. Previous references showed that AFB1 could be degraded by microorganisms via the enzymes secreted in the fermentation supernatant (Table 1). Multiple strains such as Trichoderma reesei [31], Stenotrophomonas acidoaminiphila [32], Lactobacillus plantarum [33], and Cerrena unicolor [34] possessed the capability of AFB1 degradation by extracellular enzyme expression in a liquid medium. The percentages of AFB1 degradation by different strains varied from 46.9% to\n98.56% under the conditions of different treatment time and initial AFB1 concentrations.\nBacillus strains possessed a strong capability of AFB1 degradation in the fermentation\nmedium [35\u201337]. In this study, B. subtilis WJ6 could degrade 81.57% of AFB1 from the\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 785 12 of 14\ninitial concentration of 5 \u00b5g/mL after treatment for 48 h through an extracellular enzyme in a liquid medium. The high AFB1 degradation rate generally needed a long treatment time and/or initial AFB1 concentration. For example, Stenotrophomonas sp. degraded 91.2% of AFB1 with a low initial AFB1 concentration of 0.047 \u00b5g/mL by a combination of enzymes and oxides [32]. In addition, C. unicolor was able to degrade 98.56% of AFB1 after a period of 14 d [34]. B. subtilis WJ6 possessed a higher efficiency of AFB1 degradation with a higher initial concentration of AFB1 and shorter catalytic time compared with the reported strains [35,38]. Additionally, this study also revealed the mechanism based on the up-regulated genes of structural molecule activity and the down-regulated genes of multi-organism process function. Therefore, B. subtilis WJ6 still had an advantage in AFB1 degradation based on the comprehensive comparison of substrate concentration, catalytic time, and degradation efficiency.\nGlycolysis and gluconeogenesis path analyses were performed using the DEGs data based on the transcriptomics (Supplementary File S2). Enzymes participating in the glycolysis/glucose neogenesis pathway exhibited significant overexpression. In the pentose phosphate pathway, the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-P from D-fructose-1,6-P2 via glycerone-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P, represented significant overexpression. In addition, the enzyme for the conversion of glycerate-2-P and phosphoenolpyruvate also displayed significant overexpression. Therefore, gene expression related to AFB1 degradation could involve in the pentose phosphate pathway. The possible limitations of this study lacked the determination of specific AFB1 decomposition enzymes and the feasibility analysis of the multi-enzyme degradation of AFB1 using the synergistic approach. In addition, artificial intelligence and machine learning would be used to modify the AFB1-degrading enzyme with high activity and specificity, which was a key direction of AFB1 degradation in the future."
