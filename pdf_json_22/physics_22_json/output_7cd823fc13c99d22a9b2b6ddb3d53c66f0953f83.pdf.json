    "abstractText": "The dependence of the actual/e ective ionic concentration on the nominal salt concentration is experimentally investigated for aqueous solutions of NaCl and KCl. The actual ionic bulk density is determined by means of the impedance spectroscopy technique using two approaches for the data analysis: A rst approach scrutinizing the real part's plateau of the cell's electric impedance spectrum versus the bulk density of dopant when the impedance is written in the series representation. A second one via extraction of the ionic density from simultaneously tting of the real and imaginary parts of the impedance spectrum by using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model. The validity of this procedure reposes on the hypothesis that both the di usion coe cient and the dielectric constant are independent from the salt concentration in the explored range of concentrations. Our experimental results indicate that a rst-order reaction describes well the dissociation phenomenon. The dissociation-association ratio of the reaction has been calculated. Deviations from linearity appear at rather low concentrations of the order of mM.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe impedance spectroscopy technique is a powerful method to characterize, from the dielectric point of view, solid and liquid materials, by measuring the electric impedance of a sample versus the frequency of an applied electric signal of small enough amplitude. The theoretical analysis of the response of the sample, in the frequency range where the ions present in the medium contribute to the electric response of the system under consideration, is made by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model [1, 2]. The PNP model is based on the continuity equations for anions and cations and on the equation of Poisson relating the actual potential to the bulk ionic charge density. Several versions of this model have been proposed along the years considering di erent boundary conditions and physical systems [3 9].\nThe spectra of the impedance's real and imaginary parts in the series representation in the low frequency regime (smaller than one hundred Hz) strongly depend on the physical properties of the electrodes. On contrary, for frequencies larger than approximately one kHz, the electric response of the cell is independent of the electrodes, which can be considered as blocking. In this frequency range, the real part of the impedance presents a large plateau whose amplitude depends only on the di usion coe cient, D, and the bulk density of ions, n, in thermodynamic equilibrium [10]. From the analysis of this part of the spectrum it becomes possible to obtain information about D and n. Taking into account that the di usion coe cient, in the limit of small salt concentrations, is independent of the solute's concentration [11], D can be considered as a known quantity, and n can be derived from this part of the spectrum. Alternatively, D and n can be calculated by tting the real and imaginary parts of the impedance in order to validate the plateau method.\nRecently, we have investigated the concentration dependence of the capacitive to inductive transition observed in electrolytic solutions [12], related to the presence of a parasite inductance connected to the connection cables. In that particular case, the parasite inductance was found to be responsible for a cusp in the modulus of reactance, appearing at a well de ned frequency, depending on the salt concentration present in the solution.\nHere, we use the same system to investigate the dissociation of NaCl and KCl in water and, in particular, the dependence of the recombination coe cient on the salt concentration. To this end, we calculate the actual/e ective density of ions in the cell and compare it to\nthe added salt concentration in the water. For the data analysis, we use the plateau method to obtain the actual ion's density. In addition, the e ective ionic concentration is calculated by tting the real and imaginary parts of the impedance.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we outline the PoissonNernst-Planck model used for the analysis of experimental data and provide some useful formulas for deriving the ionic bulk density at the impedance level. In Sec.

            "text": "A. Impedance\nIn the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model's framework, we have shown that the electric impedance Z of an electrolytic cell in the shape of a slab of thickness d and surface area S limited by blocking electrodes, is given by [10]\nZ = 2\ni\u03c9\u03b5\u03b22S\n{ 1\n\u03bb2\u03b2 tanh\n( \u03b2 d\n2\n) + i \u03c9d\n2D\n} . (1)\nIn Eq. (1) above, \u03c9 denotes the circular frequency of the applied external eld, \u03b5 the dielectric constant of the liquid free of ions, D the di usion coe cient of the ions in liquid, \u03bb =\u221a \u03b5kBT/(2nq2) the Debye length, and\n\u03b2 = 1\n\u03bb\n\u221a 1 + i\u03c9 \u03bb2\nD . (2)\nIn the expression de ning \u03bb, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, q the ionic charge, and n the bulk density of ions in thermodynamic equilibrium. Equation (1) holds in the case where cations and anions have the same electrical charge and di usion coe cient, as happens for NaCl and KCl. A generalization of the analysis in cases where ions have di erent valence and di usion coe cients and the electrodes are not blocking has been presented in Ref. [13]. Yet, for the case under consideration the simple analysis relevant to the monovalent ions, with the same di usion coe cient, is enough for the analysis of the experimental data.\nIntroducing the Debye relaxation circular frequency \u03c9D = D/\u03bb 2, Eq. (1) can be rewritten\nas\nZ = i\u03c9d+ 2\u03c9D tanh(\u03b2d/2)\ni\u03c9\u03b5\u03b2(\u03c9D + i\u03c9)S . (3)\nIf in the circuit a parasite inductance L is also present, then the reactive contribution i\u03c9L appears as well, and Eq. (3) needs to be reformulated as folows\nZ = i\u03c9d+ 2\u03c9D tanh(\u03b2d/2)\ni\u03c9\u03b5\u03b2(\u03c9D + i\u03c9)S + i\u03c9L. (4)\nIn this form the expression of the electric impedance has been used recently to investigate\nthe dependence of the capacitive-inductive transition on the ionic density [12]. De ning\nM = d\n2\u03bb , Rp =\nd\n\u03b5\u03c9DS , \u2126 =\n\u03c9\n\u03c9D , and L = \u03c9DL, (5)\nequation (4) can be put in the form\nZ = Rp i\u2126M\n\u221a 1 + i\u2126 + tanh(M \u221a 1 + i\u2126)\ni\u2126M(1 + i\u2126)3/2 + i\u2126L. (6)\nUsually \u03bb d, and hence M 1. In this framework Eq. (6) is very well approximated by\nZ = Rp 1 + i\u2126M\n\u221a 1 + i\u2126\ni\u2126M(1 + i\u2126)3/2 + i\u2126L. (7)\nThe quantity indicated by Rp coincides to the value of the plateau of the spectrum of R = R(\u03c9) [10]. As it follows from its de nition, Rp depends on both \u03bb and D. However, for aqueous solutions with concentrations as those investigated in the current work, the di usion coe cient depends only weakly on the concentration and it is well approximated by that of the diluted solution [11]. From the measured value of the resistance of the plateau Rp, for a given nominal concentration n0, it is then possible to evaluate the actual ionic density n.\nFor circular frequency very small with respect to \u03c9D, yet still high enough to neglect the\ncontribution of electrodes to the impedance, such that \u2126 1, we get from Eq. (7) Z \u223c Rp \u2212 i ( Rp M\u2126 + (Rp \u2212 L)\u2126 ) . (8)\nFrom this expression it follows that in this frequency regime the modulus of the reactance has a minimum for the reduced circular frequency\n\u2126m = 1\u221a\nM(1\u2212 L/Rp) , (9)\nwhose value is\n|X(\u2126m)| = 2 Rp\u221a M\n\u221a 1\u2212 L\nRp . (10)\nThese relations indicate that, changing Rp is also changing the minimum of the reactance modulus and its position, as it is experimentally observed.\nB. Recombination-dissociation phenomenon\nIn order to derive information on the recombination-dissociation phenomenon, we assume that the decomposition of a salt in water can be described by a chemical reaction whose order depends on the ions generated. In the case where the produced ions have the same valence, the reaction is of rst order, and the neutral molecule A dissociates in two monovalent ions B+ and C\u2212, that is, A = B+ + C\u2212, according to Refs. [12, 14 16]. For an in nite sample (d \u2192 \u221e) in the absence of any external power supply, the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium, and the bulk density of neutral, positive, and negative species are positionindependent. If we denote by n0, nn, and n the bulk densities of salt molecules that can dissociate, neutral, and charged particles respectively, and by kd and ka the constants of dissociation and recombination, we arrive at\nn+ nn = n0, and kd nn = ka n 2. (11)\nIt follows that the bulk density of ions is given in thermodynamic equilibrium by\nn = \u2212 kd 2ka + \u221a( kd 2ka )2 + kd ka n0. (12)\nThe degree of dissociation de ned as \u03c1 = n/n0 follows then as\n\u03c1 = \u2212\u03ba 2 + \u221a(\u03ba 2 )2 + \u03ba, (13)\nwhere \u03ba = kd/(kan0). From the measured values of n, and via the nominal concentration n0, it is possible to determine the ratio kd/ka of the reaction."

            "text": "We measured the impedance spectra of saline solutions composed of (i) potassium cloride (KCl) and (ii) sodium chloride (NaCl), both in Milli-Q water. The concentration of solutions\nin NaCl or KCl salt varied from 3 \u00d7 1022/m3 up to 1.42 \u00d7 1025/m3, see Tab. I. The full description of the saline solution preparation and impedance spectroscopy measurement is given in Ref. [12]. Impedance measurements were performed by applying a harmonic potential of 25 mV in amplitude between the electrodes of the cell containing the electrolyte. Linearity has been tested by varying the amplitude of the applied potential. In what follows we present the impedance spectra of three KCl solutions in order to describe the results and manifest the analysis method. All impedance spectra are given in the Appendix.\nFigures 1 3 illustrate the real (R) and imaginary (|X|) parts of the impedance for three typical concentrations of KCl (The spectra for NaCl are similar and are not shown here\nfor brevity). The appearance of a cusp in the absolute value of the reactance results stems from a parasitic inductance due to the coaxial cables of the experimental set up [12]. This latter inductance was measured equal to L = 2\u00b5H [12]. The cusp signals a transition from the capacitive to inductive regime [17]. The dependence of the cusp's frequency position on the ionic concentration reveals the existence of a critical concentration where this frequency shows a jump of approximately two orders of magnitude, i.e., from the MHz regime to a few tens of KHz [12].\nIn order to obtain the e ective ionic concentration n as function of the nominal one n0 for the various salt solutions and use the obtained results to reckon the dissociation-regeneration coe cient, we follow the protocol of Sec. II. This is based on the experimental value of the resistance at the plateau, Rp. These Rp values are shown in Fig. 4 for both KCl and NaCl. Note the minor di erences in their values which is due to the di erent di usion constants.\nFor the numerical calculations the di usion coe cient at room temperature of KCl is taken equal to DKCl = 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2/s. For NaCl we use DNaCl = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2/s respectively [18 20]. Note that in the case of NaCl the di usion coe cient for anions and cations are di erent. Nevertheless, in the plateau range free di usion is important since the ambipolar e ect is crucial only at lower frequencies [21]. The ions are monovalent with q = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221219 C and the water dielectric constant is taken as \u03b5 \u223c 80 \u00d7 \u03b50 [11]. The geometrical parameters of the experimental cylindrical cell are: (i) the thickness d = 0.65 \u00d7 10\u22123m, and (ii) the surface area S = \u03c0 \u00d7 10\u22124m2 of the electrodes. From the expression Rp = kBTd/(2q 2 S D n), and using the experimental values of the plateau resistance, one may calculate the e ective concentration of ions n. In order to test the obtained results, we used them to reproduce the resistance and reactance of the cell for each concentration. This procedure indicates that for low concentrations one can reproduce the experimental spectra fairly well in the regime above the zone where boundary conditions in uence the sample's response. Yet, the method seems to fail above the critical concentration. Therefore, we tried also to t simultaneously R(f) and |X(f)|, as shown in Figs. 5 7. Continuous lines are the result of tting using the PNP model. We t R(f) and |X(f)| only in the frequency range above a few kHz in order to avoid complication due to the electrodes. At low concentrations we nd results compatible to those obtained via the Rp method, while at higher concentrations the obtained results di er by less than \u223c 20%.\nFinally Fig. 8 shows the e ective ionic concentration versus the nominal one. Points are\ncalculated via: (i) the Rp method (blue points for NaCl and green ones for KCl) and (ii)\ntting R(f) and |X(f)| (red points for NaCl and gray ones for KCl). Continuous lines show the best ts using Eq. (12). The colors of the continuous line and corresponding points are identical and the dashed line marks complete dissociation. The obtained values for the ratio k = kd/ka are listed here: kNaCl = 2.76 \u00d7 1025/m3 and kKCl = 2.54 \u00d7 1025/m3 fro the Rp method and kNaCl = 2.21\u00d7 1025/m3 and kKCl = 2.04\u00d7 1025/m3 from the simultaneous t of R(f) and |X(f)|. Several comments are in the order at this point: (i) Discrepancies among KCl and NaCl e ective concentrations are small and could originate from the approximated di usion constants used in the above analysis. (ii) With increasing concentration of the solution, the association-dissociation e ect has to be taken into account even for concentrations of \u223c 10\u22123 M. (iii) Other contributions resulting from at distance interactions among ions and among ions and solvent molecules might be important especially at higher concentrations than the ones considered here [22, 23].\nClosing, we would like to mention that we have limited our analysis at frequencies above 10 kHz where the in uence of electrodes' properties on the electric response of the cell to the external harmonic excitation is negligible. Moreover, in this frequency regime the ambipolar di usion is not signi cant. Adding a Warburg element in order to take into account the role of electrodes, in series to the impedance evaluated by means of the PNP-model, it is possible to t the experimental data over the entire frequency range. Warburg impedance [24, 25] has the functional form ZW = RWi(\u03c9/\u03c9W ) \u03b3 where RW is a real observable having the dimension of a resistance, \u03c9W a typical circular frequency, and \u03b3 < 1, are parameters of the model, depending on the state of electrodes and the interface electrode-solution. However, several phenomena contribute to ZW, as the adsorption, ambipolar di usion, roughness of the surface, and others. Considering RW, \u03c9W, and \u03b3 as tting parameters it is possible to obtain a good quality t, still without being possible to decipher the physical origin of these parameters. For this reason we limited our analysis at high enough frequencies, as described above."

            "text": "To summarize, we have calculated the e ective concentration of ions in NaCl and KCl solutions in water as a function of the nominal salt concentration by the plateau method and by tting the measured impedance using the PNP model. As shown both methods gave compatible results giving credit to our two-fold analysis. Assuming that the salt dissociation is described by a rst-order reaction we calculated the reaction quotient. The analysis has been done in the approximation of constant di usion coe cient and dielectric constant. It would be interesting to compare results of the above described method for evaluation of the e ective ion concentration with measurements on the same samples by other experimental methods, such as conductivity [26] and spectroscopic ones [27 30].\nAcknowledgements G.B. acknowledges partial support by the MEPhI Academic Excellence Project.
