"Future research should focus on quality improvement initiatives aiming to protect IM trainees from mental illness and burnout for the remainder of this pandemic and throughout the evolution of Graduate Medical Education. This could include evaluating strategies to ensure the preservation of education and supervision for trainees under any circumstance, and to promote a culture focused on resident wellness, mutual respect, and humane work hours. Further survey-based research should also be conducted to elicit the causes of systemic discrimination in the healthcare setting during challenging societal events."
