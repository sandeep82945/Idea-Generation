            "text": "Covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous organic materials synthesized from secondary building units through reticular chemistry.1,2 COFs are a rich materials platform and have gained attention due to their compositional modularity, structural diversity, pore size tunability, and chemical stability.3\u20135 Despite these advantages, experimental and computational studies have reported the presence of various types of defects and disorder within COF structures, which can influence their crystallinity, stability, porosity, and conductivity.6\u201314 One example is stacking disorder, in which layers of a COF with twodimensional (2D) connectivity are offset at different amounts relative to adjacent layers. Recent evidence for stacking disorder comes from athermal density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed a variety of stacking modes can exist in contrast to eclipsed stacking (i.e. zero layer offset) typically reported in experiments.6,8,13,15 However, the stacking behaviour obtained from DFT simulations is inherently static in nature and limited by the small system size that can be studied. As a result, prior models may not be representative of the true stacking behaviour of layered COFs at ambient temperature.\nThe stacking disorder in COFs is challenging to probe experimentally due to the averaging effect of time and space from various probes. In 2011, Lukose et al.16 used DFT calculations and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate the formation of four different stacking sequences (eclipsed, zigzag, serrated and inclined) in a set of reported and hypothetical 2D COFs and found that these\na Department of Materials, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.\nE-mail: a.walsh@imperial.ac.uk b Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722,\nRepublic of Korea c Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, London W12 0BZ, UK d Department of Physics, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 03760, Korea \u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

They are often heralded for their ordered nature and high crystallinity, especially in comparison to traditional organic polymers with strong connections in only one dimension. However, there is growing evidence from crystallographic and spectroscopic probes, as well as from materials modelling, that these frameworks contains high amounts of disorder. In particular, an eclipsed configuration is often assumed for layered COFs for applications ranging from gas storage to batteries. The structure is however a saddle point on the potential energy surface. The energy of the system is lowered when adjacent layers are displaced. Our study probes this phenomenon using a multi-technique approach with a room temperature description provided by a machine-learning force field that has been actively learned from density functional theory energies, forces, and stresses. We show how the local structure distorts in time and gives rise to the average features that can be seen in slow experimental probes. Hidden stacking disorder is likely a common feature across many families of layered COFs and metal\u2013organic frameworks.\nMaterials Horizons\nCOMMUNICATION\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In 2017, Fan et al.17 confirmed that SIOC-COF-8 and SIOC-COF-9 stack in an inclined arrangement using a combination of powder XRD, pore-size distribution analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. In 2022, Kang et al.11 used 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) to study the chemical environment of atoms in adjacent layers of 2D COFs and reported that different stacking modes can be quantitatively characterized by the split signals of the methoxy/methyl side groups. In the same year, Natraj et al.10 employed continuous rotation electron diffraction and XRD to demonstrate that TAPPy-PDA and TAPB-DMPDA COFs are disordered along the stacking c direction while remaining ordered within the ab plane.\nCOFs can be viewed as organic macromolecules with typically more than 100 atoms in the crystallographic unit cell. Thus, it is unfeasible to study their dynamics and disorder over long time and length scales using ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As an alternative, more efficient but generally less accurate simulation methods, such as Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)12,18 and classical MD simulations,13,19,20 have been applied to study COFs and related metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs).21\u201323 For classical MD simulations, force fields with fixed functional forms are required to describe the interatomic forces. Popular force fields such as OPLS24,25 and DREIDING12,26\u201329 have been used to study the dynamics of COFs. However, the accuracy depends strongly on the particular force field parameterization and its ability to describe the local structure and extended interactions.\nAn alternative approach to obtain near DFT accuracy for dynamic simulations at a lower computational cost is machine learning force fields (MLFFs).28,30\u201336 MLFFs trained on DFT data have demonstrated high efficiency and accuracy in predicting atomic energies and forces.32,34,37 On-the-fly learning is an efficient method for force field training. It constructs a DFT reference database by sampling an MD trajectory for structures with high predicted uncertainty.31 This approach means that during the MD simulation, only a fraction of the force evaluations are performed using DFT, with the rest provided by the MLFF. This state-of-the-art method has been used to study the dynamical properties of many materials, including the melting points of Al, Si, Ge, Sn and MgO,31 the phase transitions of hybrid perovskites,38 and the thermal conductivity of zirconia.39 These previous studies indicate the potential of applying MLFFs to understand the dynamics of structurally and compositionally complex materials such as COFs.\nIn this work, on-the-fly MLFF models are trained for the prototype COFs, Tp-Azo40,41 and DAAQ-TFP42 (Fig. S1, ESI\u2020), which have exhibited high energy storage performance as battery electrodes. We find COF structures that are initialized in an eclipsed stacking arrangement spontaneously shift to a zigzag stacking mode during MLFF-MD simulations. In contrast, the inclined structures retain their stacking throughout, suggesting that both zigzag and inclined stacking are locally stable arrangements. Using classical force fields to simulate longer time and length scales, similar, but more diverse, stacking properties are observed. These different stacking sequences in COFs lead to\ndifferent radial distribution functions (RDF) and predicted XRD patterns, and we show that a zigzag motif is in best agreement with experimental observations."

Energies, forces, and stresses calculated from the MLFFs and DFT for the eclipsed and inclined validation structures are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI\u2020). The RMSE of energy (0.42\u20130.66 meV per atom), force (0.077\u20130.084 eV \u00c5 1), and stress (0.30\u20130.44 kbar) of the validation dataset, as presented in Table 1, are almost the same as the RMSEs observed during the training. These results indicate that the force fields have been trained to sufficient accuracy.\nTo investigate the stacking behaviour of the COFs, we performed production calculations in a 2 2 8 supercell (containing 3456 atoms). Calculations were performed with the NpT ensemble at 300 K for a total of 100 ps and a time step of 0.5 fs. MLFF-MD runs were performed for the eclipsed and inclined structures of both COFs. The Bayesian errors for the production MD runs remained stable throughout the entire trajectory and are illustrated in Fig. S5 (ESI\u2020). The lattice parameters of the eclipsed and inclined Tp-Azo structures during the production runs are presented in Fig. 4 (Fig. S6, ESI\u2020 gives the results for DAAQ-TFP). The cell lengths (a, b, c) and angles (a, b, g) averaged over the whole trajectory are given in Table 2. We also report the internal energy (E0) of the final\nstructure at the end of the MD run after being relaxed using the MLFF. The average lattice parameters differ slightly from the initial equilibrium starting structures (a and b change less than 0.5%, c expands in the range of 3\u20136%) as expected due to the inclusion of temperature in the MD run (Table S1, ESI\u2020). Fig. 4 (Tp-Azo) and Fig. S6, ESI\u2020 (DAAQ-TFP) reveal the structures are dynamically stable during the trajectories with lattice parameters that remain roughly constant.\nThe plots of total internal energy versus time, presented in Fig. S7 (ESI\u2020), demonstrate the excellent stability of the entire MLFF-MD trajectory. The stability of the simulations indicates that both configurations can be considered metastable states, which will be further rationalized in the following section.\nA comparison of the internal energy calculated from the relaxation of the final structures in the MD using MLFF also shows that the internal energy of the inclined stacking is lower than that of initially eclipsed COFs that distort to a zigzag structure during the simulation in Table 2. In Tp-Azo, the energy difference between the zigzag and inclined structures is 0.24 eV per unit cell (2.20 meV per atom), while it is 0.11 eV per unit cell (1.04 meV per atom) in DAAQ-TFP. However, the energy difference between the two stacking modes is relatively small suggesting competition between the two arrangements will be present at ambient temperatures."

During the MD simulations, it was observed that the eclipsed COFs shifted into a zigzag stacking mode while the inclined COFs retained their original stacking behaviour (Fig. 5 and Fig. S8, ESI\u2020). This indicates that eclipsed stacking is not a stable stacking mode whereas inclined stacking is locally stable. We find that the layers in the inclined COFs are more corrugated than those in the zigzag COFs. This follows similar reports of corrugated frameworks in 2D COFs, which are believed to originate from inter-layer interactions between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.54\nOur results reveal that the main source of disorder occurs along the c direction of stacking rather than in the ab plane. This is in agreement with continuous rotational electron diffraction experiments, which found that 2D COFs of TAPPy-PDA and TAPB-DMPDA behave as single-crystals in the ab plane but are disordered in the c dimension.10 To demonstrate this point, in Fig. 6 we plot the stacking disorder averaged over the full MD trajectories for initially eclipsed and inclined Tp-Azo (the same analysis is presented in Fig. S11 (ESI\u2020) for DAAQ-TFP). The disorder is quantified by the offset of each layer relative to adjacent layers. The offsets are decomposed into their components along the x, y and z directions and are averaged along the MD trajectories after equilibration (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI\u2020). For the x and y directions, an offset of 0 \u00c5 indicates a fully eclipsed structure, whereas a constant positive or negative offset indicates inclined stacking. A constant offset in the z direction indicates a fixed layer separation.\nFor zigzag Tp-Azo (initially eclipsed pre-equilibration), the average absolute offset for the x, y, and z directions are 0.2 \u00c5, 2.2 \u00c5, and 3.4 \u00c5, respectively.

The offsets for the y direction oscillate from B 2.2 to B2.2 \u00c5, indicating each layer is shifted by an equal but opposite amount relative to adjacent layers. This oscillating offset is a characteristic signature of a zigzag stacking mode. The relatively constant offset in the z direction indicates the layer separation remains roughly fixed throughout the entire MD run. The total absolute displacement in the ab plane is 2.1 \u00c5, highlighting the strong deviation from the idealised\neclipsed structure. The eclipsed DAAQ-TFP structure also shifts to a zigzag stacking mode during equilibration. The interlayer offsets show broadly the same features as Tp-Azo, with a relatively large overall displacement distance in the ab plane of 1.8 \u00c5 (Fig. S11a, ESI\u2020).\nThe inclined COF structures retain their inclined stacking throughout the entire MD run. This can be seen in the stacking disorder analysis which reveals a roughly constant negative offset of 2.6\u20132.8 \u00c5 in the x direction and 0.6\u20131.1 \u00c5 in the y direction for Tp-Azo (offsets in DAAQ-TFP are 2.1\u20132.4 \u00c5 and 0.4\u20130.7 \u00c5 in x and y, respectively). The overall offsets in the ab plane are 2.4 \u00c5 (Tp-Azo) and 2.5 \u00c5 (DAAQ-TFP) (Fig. 6b and Fig. S11b, ESI\u2020). Thus, the overall offsets are marginally larger for inclined stacking than initially eclipsed stacking in both COFs. The inter-layer distances are very similar, around 3.4 \u00c5 in each case, independent of the stacking mode (Fig. 6 and Fig. S11, ESI\u2020). The calculated offsets in the ab plane fall in the predicted energy minimum basin from static DFT calculations which span 1.7 \u00c5 to 3.5 \u00c5.15\nConfigurational entropy is a thermodynamic driving force for the observed behaviour. In the ab plane, there are multiple degrees of freedom in the zigzag configuration, but only one in the inclined configuration. As there is only a small difference in the internal energy of zigzag and inclined configurations, an entropic contribution from stacking faults in a zigzag configuration, which is not present in the inclined configuration would be sufficient to change the order of free energies at T = 300 K. Thus, we expect the zigzag mode to be the favoured structure at ambient temperature.\n3.2.2 Radial distribution functions.

A recent study of the imine-linked TTI-COF used RDF analysis and simulations to compare the total scattering functions of different stacking modes, revealing random layer offsets at low temperature.14\nWe first calculate the RDF of the eclipsed and inclined structures from static DFT relaxed structure.

The layers are numbered from 1 to 8.\nFig. 6 Offsets in the x, y, z directions between adjacent layers in (a) zigzag and (b) inclined Tp-Azo.

In the inclined stacking structure, the peak position is shifted to 4.2 \u00c5 due to additional displacement along the ab plane (Fig. 7).15 Comparable results are found for DAAQ-TFP (Fig. S12, ESI\u2020).\nWe next calculate the average RDF across the MLFF-MD trajectories after the structures are equilibrated. We find that the small-distance sharp peaks are broadened and shifted to larger distances compared to the static DFT RDFs. The shift in the initially eclipsed structures is larger than that of the inclined structures, primarily as the eclipsed structures shifted to a zigzag arrangement during the simulation. There is a qualitative difference in the RDFs of the inclined and zigzag structures, indicating that RDF analysis can be used as a probe for stacking disorder.\n3.2.3 Simulated diffraction patterns. The stacking modes of 2D COFs can be experimentally observed through powder XRD measurements. To establish a connection between simulation results and experiments, we predict the diffraction patterns of COFs in different stacking modes. The averaged diffraction patterns of zigzag and inclined COFs were simulated by sampling the trajectory every 5 ps. We compare these to the eclipsed and inclined structures obtained from static DFT relaxations. XRD patterns were simulated using pymatgen.55\nThere are significant differences in the simulated XRD patterns of the zigzag and inclined structures (Fig. 8 and Fig. S14, ESI\u2020). The zigzag structure shows a single sharp low-angle diffraction peak, whereas the inclined structure has a split low-angle peak. The peak splitting in the inclined structure is due to the reduced symmetry in slip-stacked structures and is consistent with previous simulated XRD patterns from DFT relaxed COFs.14,56\nFor both Tp-Azo41 and DAAQ-TFP,42 the simulated XRD of the zigzag structure shows a significantly improved fit with the experimental PXRD pattern compared to the inclined structure. Interestingly, the averaged zigzag XRD pattern and the XRD from the eclipsed static DFT relaxation look similar up to high angles (subtle differences are observed for the (001) reflection peaks in Fig. S13 and S14, ESI\u2020). Many studies have concluded that the stacking of COFs is eclipsed based on good agreement between the PXRD data and the simulated eclipsed diffraction patterns.\nHowever, our work demonstrates that comparisons of experimental diffraction patterns with simulated patterns from static DFT are not sufficient to unambiguously assign the stacking mode. Indeed, the instability of the eclipsed stacking in our simulations combined with the good agreement of the zigzag structure with experimental XRD patterns, suggest that previous work may be incorrectly assigning the eclipsed configurations."

Lower accuracy is expected here as there has been no systemspecific tuning of the model parameters; however, the equilibrium structures obtained from the OPLS-AA force field show reasonable agreement with the MLFF (and underlying DFT) values (Table S2 and Fig. S15, ESI\u2020).\nAgain we considered room temperature dynamics starting from the two initial stacking configurations. Qualitatively similar dynamic behaviour is observed. Importantly, the eclipsed COFs spontaneously disorder into the zigzag configuration at equilibrium, while the inclined COFs maintain their stacking mode in these large-scale MD simulations (Fig. 9, Fig. S16 and S17, ESI\u2020). This analysis gives us confidence that our predictions with the MLFF are not limited by finite size-effects in the MD simulations."

However, due to the larger entropic contribution to the zigzag stacking, we expect this to be the favoured structure. The predicted diffraction patterns of the \u2018\u2018random\u2019\u2019 zigzag mode from the MLFF exhibit significantly better agreement with the reported experimental PXRD than the (perfectly) eclipsed or inclined stacking patterns, highlighting the importance of sampling the dynamic structures. This questions the common assignment of eclipsed structures on the basis of low-quality PXRD patterns often reported for 2D COFs in the literature. The results from classical force field dynamics are qualitatively consistent MLFF-MD simulations, supporting that a zigzag stacking structure is realistic on longer lengths scales.\nOverall, the results of the room temperature simulations indicate that the on-the-fly MLFF is a valuable tool for accurately describing the dynamic properties of 2D COFs and that the stacking structure of these materials is more complicated than previously reported.\nAuthor contributions\nJu Huang: conceptualization, investigation, methodology, visualization, writing \u2013 original draft, writing \u2013 review & editing.
