    "abstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most deadly cancers worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies have low success rates and several side effects. This relevant clinical problem requires the discovery of new and more effective therapeutic alternatives. Ruthenium drugs have arisen as one of the most promising metallodrugs, due to their high selectivity to cancer cells. In this work we studied, for the first time, the anticancer properties and mechanisms of action of four lead Ru-cyclopentadienyl compounds, namely PMC79, PMC78, LCR134 and LCR220, in two CRC-derived cell lines (SW480 and RKO). Biological assays were performed on these CRC cell lines to evaluate cellular distribution, colony formation, cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and motility, as well as cytoskeleton and mitochondrial alterations. Our results show that all the compounds displayed high bioactivity and selectivity, as shown by low half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) against CRC cells. We observed that all the Ru compounds have different intracellular distributions. In addition, they inhibit to a high extent the proliferation of CRC cells by decreasing clonogenic ability and inducing cell cycle arrest. PMC79, LCR134, and LCR220 also induce apoptosis, increase the levels of reactive oxygen species, lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, induce actin cytoskeleton alterations, and inhibit cellular motility. A proteomic study revealed that these compounds cause modifications in several cellular proteins associated with the phenotypic alterations observed. Overall, we demonstrate that Ru compounds, especially PMC79 and LCR220, display promising anticancer activity in CRC cells with a high potential to be used as new metallodrugs for CRC therapy.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This type of cancer is the third most frequent, as well as the second most common cause of death all over the world [1]. In 2020, more than 1.9 million new cases and 935,000 deaths were estimated worldwide [1]. Taking into account time profiles and population projections, the global burden of CRC is estimated to growth by 60% to over 2.2 million new cases\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1731. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15061731 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1731 2 of 32\nand 1.1 million deaths by 2030 [2]. Conventional therapeutical strategies for CRC consist of surgical resection followed by chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is the most widely used agent to treat CRC and can be used alone or in combination with other drugs. However, it possesses success rates as low as 10\u201315%, due to severe side effects and resistance problems [3\u20135]. The limitations of current therapeutic strategies instigate researchers to discover new and more effective therapeutic alternatives. In the last decades, transition metal-based compounds have been widely studied as anticancer drugs [6\u20138]. In this field, platinum-based drugs constitute the most successful group of anticancer agents. Cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin are employed in the treatment of various types of cancers, such as CRC [9]. Despite their clinical success, platinum-based drugs have many associated disadvantages and chemotherapy is frequently accompanied by severe side effects and treatment resistance [10]. Among the numerous metal complexes investigated to date, ruthenium compounds have emerged as some of the most promising metallodrugs. Among their other characteristics, Ru-based compounds have shown good anticancer activity, with some Ru complexes being selective for cancer cells. In addition, they present different modes of action, chemical stability, and structural variety, with diverse ligand bonding modes and achievable redox properties [11,12]. Nowadays, there are some Ru(II) and Ru(III) complexes in phase I and II clinical trials for cancer therapy, namely NKP1339 for colorectal carcinoma treatment and, more recently, TLD1433 used with photodynamic therapy for the treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer [12\u201314]. The group of Ru(II) organometallic compounds has also drawn much attention in the medicinal chemistry field, presenting promising anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. The most studied organoruthenium compounds are those with a piano stool configuration based on a Ru(II)-(\u03b76-C6H6) core [15,16]. However, another promising group of piano-stool-structured compounds designated as Ru(II)-cyclopentadienyl complexes (RuCp), based on Ru(\u03b75-C5H5) derivatives, is also gaining attention due to their recognized anticancer potential [7,17]. Over the last few years, our group has been dedicated to the development of a family of RuCp complexes, in particular, those bearing 2,2\u2032-bipyridine-based ligands, and their functionalization, as potential anticancer drugs for chemotherapy [7,11,18]. The first RuCp complex of this class that showed promising in vitro results was TM34 (Figure 1) [19,20]. Based on the characteristics of this complex, a second generation of RuCp compounds was designed [18]. This new family comprises a low molecular weight parental compound (Figure 2\u2014PMC79), to which a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer was added at the bipyridine ligand, leading to a polymer-ruthenium conjugate (Figure 2\u2014PMC78) [11,18]. The incorporation of polylactide, recognized by the FDA for drug delivery applications, increased the molecular weight of the complex, which might benefit in vivo from an enhanced permeation and retention effect (passive targeting) [11,21,22]. Envisaging the benefit from active targeting, our group also developed and started to evaluate the biological activity of new derivatives containing biotin (vitamin B7) in the bipyridine ligand [23\u201325]. Biotin is fundamental for our bodies, having multiple biological functions [26]. This particular targeting approach takes advantage of the constant division, intense metabolic activity, and fast growth of cancer cells, which has to be accompanied by a strong uptake of essential vitamins. To this end, the receptors involved in vitamin internalization are frequently overexpressed on the cell surface [27]. In the case of biotin, the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter is overexpressed in several cancer cell lines [28]. From our library of biotinylated compounds, two stood out, LCR134 and LCR220. Both compounds showed promising in vitro anticancer activity and preliminary in vivo studies in zebrafish and/or nude mice confirmed they are worth exploring (Figure 2) [23\u201325]. The structural difference between the two compounds lies in the presence of a polymer, similar to PMC78, which confers on the LCR220 complex the possibility to benefit from both passive and active targeting.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1731 3 of 32\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 31 polymer, similar to PMC78, which confers on the LCR220 complex the possibility to benefit from both passive and active targeting. Although some studies on the anticancer effects of these compounds have already been performed in breast and ovarian cancer models, so far, no study on the anticancer properties of these compounds have been performed on the CRC model. Furthermore, it is important to note that the different genetic backgrounds between breast and ovarian cancer models and the CRC model do not allow conclusions to be drawn about whether these compounds are promising for CRC therapy. However, due to the CRC burden and the need for specific and effective therapies, studying the anticancer properties of these four Ru compounds in CRC-derived cell lines might have additional value in finding new therapeutic avenues for CRC.\nWith this in mind, in this work the anticancer characteristics of this group of\ncompounds were evaluated in the CRC model. For this purpose, several biological assays,\nnamely cellular distribution, colony formation, cell cycle distribution, proliferation, and\napoptosis analysis, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial\nalterations assessment, and alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and motility were\nperformed in different CRC cell lines. In addition, alterations of the cellular proteome\ninduced by these compounds were also analyzed in CRC cell lines.\nFigure 1. Chemical structure of TM34.\nFigure 2.

After 48 h, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed using a 6 M urea solution and a cell scrapper. The lysate was transferred to a microtube and passed through a syringe with a 25 G needle to make the solution less viscous. Protein quantification was performed using a DC\u2122 protein assay kit (5000116, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The samples (10 \u00b5g) were reduced with dithiothreitol (30 nmol, 37 \u25e6C, 60 min) and alkylated in the dark with iodoacetamide (60 nmol, 25 \u25e6C, 30 min). The resulting protein extract was first diluted to 2 M urea with 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate for digestion with endoproteinase LysC (1:10 (w:w), 37 \u25e6C, 6 h, Wako, cat # 129-02541), and then diluted 2-fold with 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate for trypsin digestion (1:10 (w:w), 37 \u25e6C, o/n, Promega cat # V5113). After digestion, the peptide mix was acidified with formic acid and desalted with a MicroSpin C18 column (The Nest Group, Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The samples were then analyzed using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) coupled to an EASY-nLC 1200 (January 2019) (Thermo Fisher Scientific (Proxeon), Odense, Denmark). Peptides were loaded directly onto the analytical column and were separated with reversed-phase chromatography using a 50 cm column with an inner diameter of 75 \u00b5m, packed with 2 \u00b5m C18 particles spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). The chromatographic gradients started at 95% buffer A and 5% buffer B with a flow rate of 300 nl/min, and gradually increased to 25% buffer B and 75% A in 79 min, and then to 40% buffer B and 60% A in 11 min. After each analysis, the column was washed for 10 min with 100% buffer B. Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid in water and buffer B was 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile (January 2019). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ionization mode with the nanospray voltage set at 2.4 kV and the source temperature at 305 \u25e6C. Acquisition was performed in the data-dependent acquisition mode and with full MS scans, with 1 micro scans at a resolution of 120,000 used over a mass range of m/z 350\u20131400, with detection in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. The auto gain control (AGC) was set to \u2018standard\u2019 and the injection time to \u2018auto\u2019. For each cycle of the data-dependent acquisition analysis, following each survey scan the most intense ions above a threshold ion count of 10,000 were selected for fragmentation. The number of selected precursor ions for fragmentation was determined using the \u201cTop Speed\u201d acquisition algorithm\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1731 7 of 32\nand a dynamic exclusion of 60 s. Fragment ion spectra were produced via high-energy collision dissociation at a normalized collision energy of 28% and they were acquired in the ion trap mass analyzer. AGC MS2 was set to 2E4 and an isolation window of 0.7 m/z and a maximum injection time of 12 ms were used. The digested bovine serum albumin (New England biolabs cat # P8108S) was analyzed between each sample to avoid sample carryover and to assure the stability of the instrument. Qcloud was used to control instrument longitudinal performance during the project [38,39]. The acquired spectra were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer software suite (v2.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Mascot search engine (v2.6, Matrix Science, Singapore) [40]. The data were searched against a Swiss-Prot human database (as of June 2020, 20,406 entries) plus a list of common contaminants and all the corresponding decoy entries [41]. For peptide identification, a precursor ion mass tolerance of 7 ppm was used for MS1 level, trypsin was chosen as the enzyme, and up to three missed cleavages were allowed. The fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da for MS2 spectra. Oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation were used as variable modifications, whereas carbamidomethylation on cysteines was set as the fixed modification. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide identification was set to a maximum of 5%. Only proteins with at least two unique peptides identified were considered for quantification. Peptide quantification data were retrieved from the \u201cPrecursor ion area detector\u201d node from Proteome Discoverer (v2.3), using a 2 ppm mass tolerance for the peptide-extracted ion current (XIC). The obtained values were used to calculate protein fold changes and their corresponding adjusted p-values (q-values). The raw proteomics data have been deposited to the PRIDE repository with the dataset identifier PXD041324 [42]."

Discussion The high incidence and high mortality levels of CRC all over the world make CRC treatment highly relevant to society [1]. Classical chemotherapeutical options are limited to 5-FU and its combination with other drugs [45\u201347]. The use of these therapeutic regimens is frequently associated with low efficacy, several side effects, and resistance to treatments [48]. Platinum-based drugs are classic drugs used in clinics for the treatment of various types of cancer; however, as with other drugs, their use is accompanied by several side effects and resistance problems [10,49]. The lack of specific anticancer agents for CRC therapy with increased efficacy and specificity, and the need to overcome the resistance mechanisms of the agents currently used and reducing their range of side effects, highlights that the development of new target drugs is still a major challenge and a relevant clinical issue for CRC. Over the last few years, researchers have devoted much effort to developing alternative metal-based cancer chemotherapies. Within the group of metallodrugs, Ru compounds have emerged as one of the most promising [12]. At present, some Ru(II) and Ru(III) compounds have entered phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of lung metastases, CRC, and bladder cancer, which brings confidence to the use and study of Ru complexes for cancer therapy [12\u201314]. Previous results from this group have shown that the Ru compounds studied here possess promising anticancer activity against breast and ovarian cancer models [11,23\u2013 25]. However, so far, nothing is known about the anticancer properties and mechanism of action of these compounds in a model with such a distinct genetic background as the CRC model. In this work we study, for the first time, the effects of PMC79, PMC78, LCR134, and LCR220 compounds on CRC biological hallmarks, and explore their mechanism of action and cellular targets.\nSW480KRAS\nFigure 17.

However, so far, nothing is known about the anticancer properties and mechanism of action of these compounds in a model with such a distinct genetic background as the CRC model. In this work we study, for the first time, the effects of PMC79, PMC78, LCR134, and LCR220 compounds on CRC biological hallmarks, and explore their mechanism of action and cellular targets.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1731 22 of 32\nOur results show that all the Ru compounds have low IC50 values, with RKO cells being the most sensitive. In addition, the Ru compounds were more active against both CRC cell lines than cisplatin for almost all the compounds. Previous studies have already demonstrated that these four Ru compounds have high bioactivity in cell lines derived from breast and ovarian cancers (A2780, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231) with an IC50 lower than cisplatin [11,23,25]. Comparing the doses, the IC50 values calculated for the Ru compounds were in the range of the values previously obtained for other cancer models, and also for the same CRC lines with different Ru compounds [11,23,25,34,37]. Moreover, the CRC cell lines were shown to be more sensitive to our Ru compounds than the noncancerous cell line (NCM460), which had higher IC50 values than the CRC cells, with the exception of cisplatin. The SI calculation revealed that Ru compounds selectively affect CRC cells (SI > 1) in contrast to cisplatin (SI < 1). Some authors support that a SI higher than one indicates that the cytotoxicity on cancer cells has surpassed that on healthy non-cancer ones, revealing a selectivity to cancer cells [43,50]. Other authors consider a SI equal to two to be an interesting value, meaning that the compound shows double the cytotoxicity for cancer cells as compared to normal cells [51]. Our results demonstrate that all the Ru compounds were selective for CRC cells, contrary to cisplatin. This is a promising result, since one of the major goals of chemotherapy in clinics is that the dose of a drug eliminates the cancer cells without affecting the normal cells. Additionally, these results also highlight previous toxicity studies\u2019 results, which have shown that PMC79 and LCR134 are well tolerated in the in vivo zebrafish model [24,52]. Both compounds showed anticancer characteristics, but did not impact normal cell proliferation [52]. Furthermore, the preliminary in vivo assay in mice proved that LCR134 and LCR220 compounds were tolerable at the maximum dose tested [23]. Overall, our Ru compounds seem to be highly selective to cancer cells without affecting normal cells. We observed that all the compounds decreased cell growth in the two CRC cell lines studied. We further investigated if the decrease in cell growth was due to the inhibition of cellular proliferation and/or increased cell death. Our results show that the inhibition of cell growth was primarily due to an inhibition of proliferation observed for all the compounds through a decrease in colony formation, the maintenance of CFSE intensity, and cell cycle arrest, starting at 24 h of exposure to the compounds. Subsequently, for some of the compounds, the inhibition of proliferation resulted in cell death by apoptosis, observed through an increase in the sub-G1 population in the cell cycle, an increase in the TUNEL-positive cells, and in the AV-stained cells after 48 h of incubation with PMC79, LCR134, and LCR220. In general, our data demonstrate that in the first 24 h of exposure to our Ru compounds, an inhibition of proliferation was observed in both CRC cells. In addition, at 48 h the effect on proliferation was maintained for PMC78, while PMC79, LCR134, and LCR220 led to an increase in apoptotic cell death. Once again, our data are in agreement with previous results from this group. PMC79, PMC78, LCR134, and LCR220 have been shown to decrease cellular proliferation in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer-derived cell lines, and induce apoptosis as the main type of cell death [11,23,25]. Moreover, other Ru(II)-cyclopentadienyl compounds have also been demonstrated to decrease cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in CRC-derived cell lines [34,37]. Considering the mechanism by which our Ru compounds induce apoptosis, in recent years, some studies have shown that mitochondria play a central role in the mechanism of action of Ru compounds [53,54]. This organelle is responsible for cellular metabolism and apoptotic cell death under certain conditions [55]. Mitochondrial alterations, including the loss of \u2206\u03a8m, are essential events that occur during drug-induced apoptosis [56,57]. Some studies have demonstrated that Ru compounds decrease \u2206\u03a8m, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Subsequently, they activate the mitochondrial\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1731 23 of 32\napoptosis pathway through the expression of pro-apoptotic members of the B-cell lymphoma-2 family, which helps to release cytochrome c and then triggers the cascade reactions of members of the caspase family to induce apoptosis [58,59]. Moreover, other studies have also supported the idea that the mechanisms of action of some Ru compounds comprise the induction of apoptosis by a ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction pathway via increasing ROS levels [60\u201362]. PMC79 and PMC78 have previously been shown to induce apoptosis and mitochondrial alterations in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line [11]. In addition, our intracellular distribution results indicated that PMC79 and LCR134 in both CRC cells and LCR220 in the RKO cells are mainly distributed in the membrane fraction. This fraction comprises membrane proteins which include cellular organelles and organelle\u2019s membrane proteins, excluding the nuclear membrane proteins [63]. Taking into account the results of the intracellular distribution, ROS production, mitochondrial mass, and \u2206\u03a8m, along with our proteomics results, we might suggest that mitochondria is the target of our compounds. Moreover, our results show a time-dependent increase in ROS levels, which is concordant with the increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells observed for the PMC79, LCR134, and LCR220 compounds. This ROS production increase is also in agreement with the increase in mitochondrial mass and the tendency for a decrease in \u2206\u03a8m under the same conditions. Considering these data, we can conclude that PMC79 in the SW480 cells, and LCR134 and LCR220 in both CRC cell lines induce apoptosis via ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our intracellular distribution results also show that PMC78 and LCR220 localize at the cytoskeleton level. Previous results have shown that Ru compounds are mainly distributed in the cytoskeleton of breast cancer cells and lead to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton of these cells [11,23]. Considering all the work and knowledge of this group regarding these compounds, it is worth noting a tendency towards intracellular localization at the cytoskeleton level for polymeric compounds, such as PMC78 and LCR220, whereas non-polymeric compounds, such as PMC79 and LCR134, are mainly distributed at the membrane fraction level. Actin has an important function in cellular adhesion, migration, polarization, mitosis, and meiosis [64]. F-actin is necessary for the maintenance of several cellular functions, including motility, shape, and polarity [65]. Concerning changes in the actin cytoskeleton, our data are in agreement with previous group results showing that all Ru compounds induce alteration in F-actin organization and morphology [11,23]. In addition, the PMC79 compound also showed a decrease in expression levels of \u03b2-actin in the SW480 cells. Overall, our data suggest that our Ru compounds also target the actin cytoskeleton of CRC cells. Apart from cellular proliferation and cell death, another important hallmark of cancer that needs to be explored in the discovery of a new anticancer compound is cell migration. Cell migration is a fundamental process involved in various biological processes, with a high importance in cancer progression. Our data reveal that PMC79 and LCR220 in SW480 and RKO cells, respectively, significantly inhibited migration in CRC cells. Overall, considering the effects of our Ru compounds on the actin cytoskeleton and wound healing assay, we can suggest that our Ru compounds have little effect on cellular migration. Concerning the different chemical structures of PMC79, PMC78, LCR134, and LCR220 compounds and their anticancer properties, we expected that the biotinylated compounds could increase the targeting of cancer cells more than the non-biotinylated ones. As we mentioned before, several studies have reported that CRC is one of the cancer models that overexpress sodium-dependent multivitamin transporters in the cell surface [28]. Thus, our hypothesis was that CRC therapy could benefit from the introduction of biotin to the Ru compounds. In general, the biotinylated compounds LCR134 and LCR220 showed good anticancer characteristics in terms of selectivity towards cancer cells, inhibition of proliferation, and induction of apoptosis in both cell lines. LCR220 was demonstrated to\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1731 24 of 32\nhave a higher effect in RKO cells, being the only one that inhibited cellular motility and also induced higher levels of apoptotic cell death. Overall, in RKO cells (with a BRAF mutation), LCR220 was shown to be the most promising compound, suggesting that the presence of biotin might increase the targeting of CRC cells with a BRAF mutation. This mutation is one of the most frequently found in CRC, and for which no specific treatments are available [66]. In summary, here we show, for the first time, that PMC79, PMC78, LCR134, and LCR220 have promising anticancer properties for CRC treatment. Our data reveal that all Ru compounds are highly active and selective for CRC cells. In addition, all the compounds inhibited proliferation in both CRC cell lines. PMC79, LCR134, and LCR220 also induced cell death by apoptosis. PMC79 stood out in the SW480 cell line, harboring a KRAS mutation, by inhibiting proliferation and migration and leading to a very pronounced increase in apoptosis. In the RKO cell line, with a mutation in BRAF, the compound LCR220 was the most promising. Similar to PMC79 in the SW480 cell line, LCR220 also inhibited proliferation and migration, in addition to inducing apoptosis in RKO cells. For these compounds, the different genetic background of both CRC cell lines seems to have influenced the mechanism of action, which may be an advantage for treating CRC with KRAS or BRAF mutations. The functionalization of LCR220 with a biopolymer and biotin endowed this compound with anticancer characteristics that make it a promising compound for the treatment of CRCs with a BRAF mutation. Moreover, Ru compounds seem to have the mitochondria and the cytoskeleton as targets, and induce apoptosis via ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction. Altogether, these results highlight the specific anticancer potential of these new Ru compounds toward CRC cells, offering opportunities for their therapeutic application.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics15061731/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.R.B., P.F., T.M., J.M.-S., E.S., A.M.M.A., A.V. and A.P.; methodology, A.R.B., P.F., T.M., J.M.-S. and E.S.; validation, A.R.B., P.F., T.M., J.M.-S., E.S., A.M.M.A., A.V. and A.P.; formal analysis, A.R.B., P.F., T.M., J.M.-S. and E.S.; investigation, A.R.B., P.F., T.M., J.M.-S. and E.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.R.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.M.-S., E.S., A.M.M.A., A.V. and A.P.; supervision, A.V. and A.P.
