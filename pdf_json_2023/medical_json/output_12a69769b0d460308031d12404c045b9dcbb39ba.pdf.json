    "abstractText": "Background. Neuroligin 4 X-linked (NLGN4X) harbors a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02-restricted tumorassociated antigen, overexpressed in human gliomas, that was found to induce specific cytotoxic T cell responses following multi-peptide vaccination in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Methods. T cell receptor (TCR) discovery was performed using droplet-based single-cell TCR sequencing of NLGN4X-tetramer-sorted T cells postvaccination. The identified TCR was delivered to Jurkat T cells and primary human T cells (NLGN4X-TCR-T). Functional profiling of NLGN4X-TCR-T was performed by flow cytometry and cytotoxicity assays. Therapeutic efficacy of intracerebroventricular NLGN4X-TCR-T was assessed in NOD scid gamma (NSG) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I/II knockout (KO) (NSG MHC I/II KO) mice bearing NLGN4Xexpressing experimental gliomas. Results. An HLA-A*02-restricted vaccine-induced T cell receptor specifically binding NLGN4X131\u2013139 was applied for preclinical therapeutic use. Reactivity, cytotoxicity, and polyfunctionality of this NLGN4X-specific TCR are demonstrated in various cellular models. Intracerebroventricular administration of NLGN4X-TCR-T prolongs survival and leads to an objective response rate of 44.4% in experimental glioma-bearing NSG MHC I/II KO mice compared to 0.0% in control groups. Conclusion. NLGN4X-TCR-T demonstrate efficacy in a preclinical glioblastoma model. On a global scale, we provide the first evidence for the therapeutic retrieval of vaccine-induced human TCRs for the off-the-shelf treatment of glioblastoma patients.",

In a first-in-human phase I dose-escalation trial, GD2-directed CAR T cells were manufactured and administered to patients with H3K27M-mutant midline gliomas such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, after cyclophosphamide/ fludarabine-based lymphodepletion. A remarkable fraction of patients experienced a reduction in clinical symptoms and radiographic response.3 Similarly, a recent report on intracerebroventricular transfer of B7-H3 CAR T cells in 3 patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma resulted in clinical and radiographic improvement in one patient,14 further providing evidence of efficacy of immune-receptor engineered T cells in primary central nervous system tumors that typically only harbor few targetable surface molecules.\nA main advantage of T cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells is their ability to target not only extracellular but also intracellular antigens that are naturally processed and presented on MHC classes I and II molecules. T cells modified to express TCRs targeting tumor-associated antigens led to tumor regressions and T cell persistence in patients with different solid tumors.15,16\nThe GAPVAC study conducted by Hilf et al. provided first evidence that the administration of personalized multi-peptide vaccines targeting glioblastoma-associated antigens in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma was feasible and safe. APVAC1 peptides contained wildtype antigens that were previously identified in the peptidome of glioblastoma specimens17, selected for the off-the-shelf use, and ranked by HLA-ligandome analysis for each patient, resulting in an individualized multi-peptide composition.1 Sixteen patients were enrolled in the study and 12/13 (92.3%) developed MHCI-restricted T cell responses to at least one of the APVAC1 peptides after administration of APVAC1.1 Nine of 15 (60.0%) vaccinated patients received a multi-peptide vaccine containing the tumorassociated epitope neuroligin 4, X-linked NLGN4X131-139.\n1 Immunogenicity for this particular peptide was 86.0%. One patient with a favorable clinical course (PFS > 27.4 months, censored) showed an expansion of NLGN4X131\u2013139-specific CD8+ T cells after vaccination and specific lysis of NLGN4Xexpressing glioma cells by these cells.1\nNLGN4X is overexpressed in human gliomas with limited expression in healthy tissue.18 Publicly available single-cell RNA expression data show low expression in healthy tissue with predominant expression on neurons and precursor oligodendrocytes.18 Neuroligins (NLGNs) are postsynaptic adhesion molecules binding to neurexins on the presynaptic membrane19 and are essential for synaptic formation.20 NLGN4X is predominantly expressed on excitatory neurons regulating excitatory synaptic transmission.21\nHere, we investigated the therapeutic potential of a patient-derived vaccine-induced HLA-A*02+-restricted TCR directed against NLGN4X131\u2013139, providing the first evidence that vaccine-induced TCRs targeting glioblastomaassociated antigens can be exploited to develop off-the-shelf TCR-engineered T cell therapies."

Next, we generated episomal nano scaffold matrix attachment region (nano-S/MAR) DNA vectors with the respective variable alpha and beta chains of the top 4 TCR clones (frequotype 1-4 = ft1-4) and transfected TCR-deficient Jurkat T cells (Jurkat76). TCR surface expression was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of the murine TCR beta chain (mTCRb) allowing specific detection of the transgenic TCR and excluding mispairing with the endogenous TCR in primary T cells (Figure 1B). TCR-transfected Jurkat76 were then co-cultured with peptide-loaded BOLETH HLAA*02+ presenter cells and CD69 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. The T cell activation marker CD69 was upregulated only in TCRft1-expressing Jurkat76 when exposed to the NLGN4X131\u2013139-epitope (Figure 1C). Thus, TCRft1 was consequently used for downstream reactivity assessment. As a mode of action for antigen-dependent T-cell stimulation, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) represents a hallmark of TCR signaling. Therefore, TCRft1-expressing Jurkat76 were co-transfected with a luciferase NFAT-reporter and subsequently co-cultured with peptide-loaded HLA-A*02+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and HLA-A*02+ U87 glioma cells (Figure 1D and E) that do not endogenously express the NLGN4X protein (Supplementary Figure S1 A\u2013C). Using PBMCs as antigen-presenting cells, the NLGN4X131\u2013139-induced a luminescence signal intensity was similar to TCR stimulation by anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Figure 1D)."

TCRft1-SFG-IRES-GFPexpressing T cells acquired a CD45RA+ CD45RO\u2212 CCR7+ T cell phenotype (Figure 2G; Supplementary Figure S3B) that resembles na\u00efve T cell states26 and suggests that transduction with TCRft1-SFG-IRES-GFP does not lead to differentiation of T cells into terminal effector cells.

As the most relevant effector proteins, Granzyme-B (GrzB), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) production was assessed. Independent of healthy T cell donors, we found robust expression of the highly cytotoxic cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and GrzB by NLGN4X131\u2013 139-specific TCR-expressing T cells (Figure 3A\u2013D). Strikingly, when benchmarking NLGN4X131\u2013139-specific TCRexpressing primary human T cells with the well-established high-affinity melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1)-specific TCR that has been used for phase I and II clinical trials,15,28 we observed similar expression levels of GrzB, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 in our co-culture systems (Figure 3B\u2013D). To confirm that the robust expression of cytotoxic proteins by NLGN4X131\u2013139-specific TCR-expressing primary human T cells leads to target cell killing, we utilized a modified version of the Vital-FR assay to detect specific lysis of peptide-loaded K562 target cells (Figure 3E).27 Importantly, NLGN4X131\u2013139-specific and MART1-specific T cells (MART1-TCR-T) showed comparable cytotoxic activity against peptide-loaded K562 target cells (Figure 3F).\nNext, we aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic capacity of NLGN4X-TCR-T against the HLA-A*02+ adherent glioma cell line U87. U87 wildtype cells loaded with the NLGN4X131\u2013139 peptide induced specific upregulation of GrzB, CD69, and 4-1BB (CD137) in NLGN4X-TCR-T (Figure 4A; Supplementary Figures S4, S5A\u2013C). In line with these findings, NLGN4X131\u2013139-specific T cells were able to specifically lyse U87 cells loaded with the target peptide in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-based and flow cytometry-based killing assays (Figure 4B and C). In co-culture assays applying synthetic MHC class I-restricted peptides for reactivity testing, MHC molecules are usually saturated, and external MHC loading might occur. Although the NLGN4X131\u2013139 was previously identified by HLA-ligandome analysis in some glioblastoma patients,1 we aimed at demonstrating endogenous presentation of NLGN4X131\u2013139 in our tumor model system. Thus, we expressed the NLGN4X131\u2013139 antigen by using either a tandem-minigene (TMG) with different MHC class I epitopes including NLGN4X (U87 TMG) or a retroviral vector containing full-length NLGN4X (U87 NLGN4X), confirming endogenous processing. Overexpression of the NLGN4X antigen was confirmed by qPCR and Western blot (Supplementary Figure S1A\u2013C). Similar to our findings with K562 cells as target cells, we found specific upregulation of GrzB, CD69, and 4-1BB when we co-cultured NLGN4X-TCR-T with U87 NLGN4X or U87 TMG target cells (Figure 4D, Supplementary Figure S5D\u2013F). Moreover, U87 TMG and U87 NLGN4X were specifically lysed by NLGN4X-TCR-T (Figure 4E). Next, we aimed to assess the reactivity of NLGN4X-TCR-T against a patientderived glioblastoma cell line that endogenously expresses NLGN4X (Figure 4F). When we co-cultured these PB-1 cells with NLGN4X-TCR-T, we observed specific upregulation of the activation marker 4-1BB and the effector protein perforin (Figure 4G; Supplementary Figure S5G) and ratio-dependent killing of the target cell line (Figure 4H). In summary, we demonstrate that TCRft1-SFG-IRES-GFPexpressing primary human T cells specifically recognize and lyse tumor cells expressing the NLGN4X131\u2013139 epitope including a patient-derived glioblastoma cell line with natural processing of NLGN4X protein in vitro."

            "text": "Having demonstrated specific recognition of the NLGN4X131\u2013139 epitope and tumor cell lysis of the NLGN4Xexpressing U87 human glioma cell line by NLGN4X131\u2013139specific TCR-engineered human T cells, we next aimed to assess their therapeutic potential in vivo. Therefore, we challenged NOD scid gamma (NSG) MHC class I and II knockout (NSG MHCI/II KO) mice, that do not develop graft versus host disease after T cell transfer, with intracranial U87 TMG experimental gliomas. Mice received either NLGN4X131\u2013139-specific TCR- (NLGN4X-TCR-T) or negative control (influenza [Flu]) TCR-engineered human T cells (FluTCR-T) via intracerebroventricular transfer or did not receive any T cell treatment ((NTC) = No T cell control; Figure 5A). Two injections of 5 \u00d7 106 TCR-engineered primary human HLA-A*02+ T cells with 86.6\u201387.4% (Supplementary Figure S6) mTCRb surface expression after transduction were performed at days 15 and 22 (Figure 5A) into the lateral ventricle of the nontumor-bearing hemisphere. Treatment with NLGN4X-TCR-T resulted in prolonged survival of glioma-bearing animals compared to Flu-TCR-T or NTC mice (Figure 5B). By using longitudinal MRI, we aimed to investigate if treatment with NLGN4X-TCR-T leads to objective radiographic responses, therefore we assessed tumor volumes between days 11 and 67 according to the modified RANO criteria.29 At day 67 as the timepoint of best response, we observed stable disease in 11.1%, partial responses (PR) in 22.2%, and complete response (CR) in 22.2% of NLGN4X-TCR-T treated mice resulting in an objective response rate (ORR: CR + PR) of 44.4% in comparison to 0.0% in both Flu-TCR-T and NTC mice (Figure 5C; Supplementary Figure S7A and C). In addition to the assessment of radiographic responses upon NLGN4X131\u2013 139-specific TCR-engineered T-cell therapy, longitudinal MRI enabled the local assessment of tumor growth (Figure 5D and E). Interestingly, 2 mice with late recurrence of U87 TMG tumors (Figure 5E; Supplementary Figure S7B) had shown radiographic responses (one PR, one CR) in previous MRI (Figure 5E). Thus, we performed a flow cytometric analysis of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes from recurrent late-stage tumors (Figure 5F). In these tumors, 78 days after the second administration of NLGN4X-TCR-T, we found predominantly CD4+ T cells with low GFP expression within the experimental tumors. Moreover, T cells were CD45RA\u2212 CCR7\u2212 and had low expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 and high PD-1 expression (Figure 5F).\nNotably, recurrent U87 TMG tumors maintained expression of the NLGN4X131\u2013139 antigen as demonstrated by qPCR, and in addition, MHC class I expression was still detectable by immunofluorescent staining (Figure 5G and H; Supplementary Figure S8A\u2013C). Overall, our findings suggest that late recurrence results from the absence of intratumoral cytotoxic NLGN4X131\u2013139-specific CD8\n+ T cells (Figure 5F\u2013H; Supplementary Figure S8).\nFurthermore, we evaluated if NLGN4X-TCR-T were also able to target the U87 NLGN4X glioma cell line carrying the full-length NLGN4X protein in vivo (Supplementary Figure S9A). Mice treated with NLGN4X-TCR-T showed reduced tumor growth at day 42 (Supplementary Figure S9B), leading\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /neuro-oncology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/neuonc/noad172/7275527 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\n7Kr\u00e4mer et al.: NLGN4X TCR transgenic T cells to treat gliomas N\neu ro-\nO n colog y\nNL GN\n4X 13\n1- 13\n9 P\nCo nt\nro l P\nCD 3/\nCD 28\nT ce\nlls o\nnly\n% GrzB+\nD1\nA\nDC\nE F\nB\n80\n60\n40\n% o\nf m T\nC R\n+ C\nD 8+\n% T\nN Fa\n+ o\nf m T\nC R\nb+\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20 0.0963\n0.0209 0.0010\n0.7251\nD2\nD3\n0\nTa rg\net P\nCo nt\nro l P\nCD 3/\nCD 28\nTa rg\net P\nCo nt\nro l P\nCD 3/\nCD 28\nTa rg\net P\nCo nt\nro l P\nCD 3/\nCD 28\nTa rg\net P\nCo nt\nro l P\nCD 3/\nCD 28\nTa rg\net P\nCo nt\nro l P\nCD 3/\nCD 28\nTa rg\net P\nCo nt\nro l P\nCD 3/\nCD 28\n20\n40\n60 0.0044\n<0.0001 0.0005\n0.3141\nNLGN4X-TCR-T\nMART-1-TCR-T\n% IFN-y+\n% TNFa+\n% GrzB+\n% IFN-y+\n% TNFa+\n% GrzB+\n% IFN-y+\n% TNFa+\n% IF\nN y+\nm T\nC R\nb+\n0\n50\n10\n<0.0001 <0.0001\n<0.0001 <0.0001\nNLGN4X-TCR-T\nMART-1-TCR-T\nGranzyme B Perforin\nNLGN4X-TCR-T CellTrace FarRed labeled\ntarget cell\nCellTrace Violet labeled non-target cell\nFACS analysis\n0\nun loa\nde d Ta rg et P un loa de d Ta rg et P\n500\nliv e\nce ll\nco un\nt\n1000\n0.6026\n0.0407\n0.0275\nNLGN4X-TCR-T\nMART-1-TCR-1\n% G\nrz B\n+ m\nT C\nR b+\nFigure 3.

However, specific upregulation of various activation and effector cell markers in NLGN4X-TCR-T compared to Flu-TCR-T (Figure 6F) suggests antigen recognition and specific intratumoral T cell activation. However, the fundamental difference between the early phenotypes of intratumoral NLGN4X-TCR-T (Figure 6D) and those found at late recurrence (Figure 5E) supports the hypothesis that loss of cytotoxic CD8+ NLGN4X-TCR-T results in late tumor recurrence.

            "text": "The overall concept that TCR-expressing T cells are of great therapeutic potential has been underpinned by the recently published phase 3 study on patients with advanced melanoma who received TIL therapy (TIL-T). PFS was significantly longer among TIL-T-treated patients than among those who received the checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab.30 Here, we show that an HLA-A*02-restricted TCR that was identified and retrieved from the blood of a glioblastoma patient following multi-peptide vaccination targeting\u2014 among other tumor-associated antigens\u2014NLGN4X, and exogenously expressed in primary human T cells, can specifically recognize and lyse tumor cells and mediate objective responses in experimental glioblastoma.\nAlthough still in its infancy, adoptive T-cell therapies using TCR-engineered T cells have already proven to be clinically beneficial in metastatic melanoma.15,31 However, until now, most experimental T-cell therapies in brain malignancies utilize CAR T cells.3\u20135 A major limitation of CAR T cells is that the extracellular antibody domain of CARs is only able to bind extracellular surface antigens, thereby excluding all intracellularly processed epitopes that are presented on MHC class I molecules. TCR-transgenic T cells, in contrast, are able to specifically target intracellularly expressed antigens, but rely on antigen presentation on MHC molecules. While neoantigens, mostly highly patientindividual, are of great interest for the future development of TCR-engineered T-cell therapy, we choose here to develop an off-the-shelf HLA-A*02-restricted TCR-engineered T-cell therapy for the potential use in glioblastoma patients. Antigen-specific vaccines1 can induce such high-affinity TCRs as a potential source for transgenic T cell modification. We exploited this concept to retrieve a TCR robustly recognizing NLGN4X131\u2013139, a glioblastoma-associated antigen with a limited off-tumor expression that is presented on HLA-A*02. We expressed the NLGN4X131-139-specific TCR in human T cells using a retroviral vector that is already in clinical use. The transduction process applied here resulted in a TCR-T cell product that resembles a na\u00efve T-cell phenotype associated with favorable anti-tumor properties.5 To date, the only comparable study assessing the preclinical potential of TCR-engineered T cells in glioma targeting an MHC class I-restricted antigen is the study by Chheda et\nal., proposing the use of an anti-H3.3K27M TCR for glioma therapy.32 Chheda et al. report a cytotoxicity against peptideloaded U87 glioma cells of about 80.0% at an effector ratio of 5:1. While this is a highly innovative neoantigen-targeting concept, endogenous presentation of the H3.3K27M antigen in patients will determine the efficacy of this cellular concept in future clinical trials.33 A limitation of our study is the use of the model cell line U87 genetically engineered to express the NLGN4X antigen. Using a patient-derived glioblastoma cell line, we provide evidence that NLGN4XTCR-T cells are able to recognize their target when naturally expressed and processed. In addition to MHC class I-restricted TCR-engineered T cell therapy, we have previously described the first MHC class II neoantigen-specific TCR-engineered preclinical T cell therapy targeting mutant Capicua transcriptional repressor (CICR215W) in syngeneic and MHC-humanized experimental gliomas.34 While this represents another promising neoantigenic concept for patients with CICR215W-mutated oligodendrogliomas, direct cytotoxicity of CICR215W-specific TCR-engineered MHChumanized murine T cells was not observed; hence, in vivo efficacy was strongly dependent on auxiliary signals from, for example, the irradiated tumor microenvironment.34 Irradiation leads to upregulation of intratumoral NF-\u03baB and the type I interferon responses and enhances myeloid recruitment. While irradiation can potentially augment or suppress TCR-engineered T cells depending on treatment schedules and T cell phenotypes,35,36 we observed an improved efficacy when combining preclinical irradiation with CICR215W-TCR-T; hence, it is tempting to speculate that the efficacy of NLGN4X-TCR-T can also be improved further.\nNLGN4X shows limited mRNA expression in healthy neurons and oligodendrocytes; however, in humans, NLGN4X is detectable on protein level only in the tumor and not in healthy tissue.17 Up to now, it remains unclear if this results from limited sensitivity or if there is indeed no biologically meaningful target antigen processing and presentation in noncancerous cells. Of note, the NLGN4X antigen is not conserved between mouse and human37, limiting meaningful preclinical off-tumor cytotoxicity assessment. A solution to this would be to conduct safety studies in NLGN4X-humanized mouse model systems. However, such mice would only allow for the assessment of on-target offtumor side effects. Off-target off-tumor effects would not be reliable in such testing systems. Ultimately, a clinical dose-escalation trial will be needed to assess the safety of NLGN4X131\u2013139 TCR-engineered T cells. Similar to the multifaceted strategies in the CAR-T field, safety concepts such as the SynNotch system,38 or safety switches using reversible control of cell products either by supply or removal of small molecules, by supply of protein-based regulators, or by physical stimuli such as light, ultrasound, or heat39 are in principle adaptable for TCR-engineered T cells as well. In addition, local administration of such T cell products could increase efficacy and minimize off-target side effects. Lastly, in our model, late-stage tumor recurrence limits the long-term clinical response and is most probably driven by the loss of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with persistent expression of the transgenic TCR. Here, repetitive infusions over a longer period of time or an innovative approach using co-expression of a co-stimulatory receptor offer promising solutions.40 Collectively, with the constantly increasing\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /neuro-oncology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/neuonc/noad172/7275527 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\n12 Kr\u00e4mer et al.: NLGN4X TCR transgenic T cells to treat gliomas\ntechnical solutions in the field of synthetic immunology, TCRengineered cellular therapies that target patient-individual or patient-associated antigens could pave a future path in the treatment of malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma."
