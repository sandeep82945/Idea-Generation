1. **Investigate the use of biogenic thiosulfate for the recovery of other PGMs, such as platinum, rhodium, and iridium, from spent automotive catalysts.** This would help to expand the applicability of the proposed method and make it more versatile for the recovery of a wider range of valuable metals.


2. **Explore the use of different types of bioreactors for the production of biogenic thiosulfate.** This could include investigating the use of membrane bioreactors, which have been shown to be effective for the removal of hydrogen sulfide from biogas, or using different types of microorganisms that are capable of producing thiosulfate.


3. **Optimize the conditions for the bioleaching of PGMs from spent automotive catalysts using biogenic thiosulfate.** This could involve investigating the effects of different leaching parameters, such as temperature, pH, and the concentration of thiosulfate, on the leaching efficiency.


4. **Investigate the use of biogenic thiosulfate for the recovery of PGMs from other sources, such as electronic waste or mining waste.** This would help to further demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method and its potential for recovering PGMs from a variety of sources.


5. **Conduct a life cycle assessment of the proposed method for the recovery of PGMs from spent automotive catalysts.** This would help to evaluate the environmental impacts of the process and compare it to other methods for recovering PGMs.
