    "abstractText": "| In order to overcome the capacity limitations of current lightwave systems based on the single-mode optical fiber, massively parallel transmission in the spatial domain [space-division multiplexing (SDM)] supported by extended parallelism in the frequency domain (ultrawideband (UWB) systems) must be used. This article reviews key aspects of parallel transmission systems as the only significant capacity scaling option going forward and discusses the various tradeoffs on an architectural level and a hardware integration level. In doing so, this article also serves as an introduction to the more detailed accounts of fiber-optic systems and their future scaling within this Special Issue of the PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE.",

I N T R O D U C T I O N Some 25 years ago, it was still widely believed that optical fiber would provide enough capacity for all practical purposes of data exchange that one could ever think of, frequently supported by estimates of the maximum information that a human brain would be able to process.

Fueled by the increasing popularity of videostreaming and cloud computing, the demand for higher data rates in communication networks has been growing at an unabated annual growth rate of 40%\u201360% year over year, i.e., network traffic has been doubling every 1.5 to two years [2], [3]. Only a portion of this network traffic growth is accommodated by new fiber deployments, with an estimated six billion kilometers of single-mode fiber (SMF) installed worldwide today, growing by about 15% each year [3], [4]. The rest of the 40%\u201360% of annual network traffic growth is accommodated by putting into highcapacity service the already installed base of currently unlit (\u201cdark\u201d) fiber and/or by upgrading outdated lightwave systems to state-of-the-art capacities. The scaling deficiencies of these systems, however, became clear to researchers around 2010 when a good understanding of the fiber-optic channel\u2019s transmission capacity limit had been obtained [5] and concerns about the possibility of a capacity crunch had been clearly voiced [6]. Each year, optical fiber networks are more closely approaching their Shannon limit estimates, i.e., estimates for the maximum rate at which data can be reliably transmitted, leaving only little room for further capacity improvements [7], [8]. There is no other transmission medium in sight that can handle as massive traffic demands as optical fiber, and it is highly unlikely that the transition to order-of-magnitude higher carrier frequencies, which was accomplished when lowloss optical fiber replaced copper cables and directional microwave links starting in the late 1970s, can be successfully repeated [9]. Hence, optical fiber communications\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Record transmission rates over a single strand of fiber achieved in today\u2019s research labs range from \u223c250 Tb/s in SMF [10] to \u223c10 Pb/s using multicore fibers (MCFs) [11], [12]. Commercial terrestrial systems carry up to \u223c70 Tb/s per fiber [8], [13], and the currently highest-capacity submarine cable in operation, the Dunant system owned by Google [14], can carry an aggregate of >300 Tb/s across a 6600-km trans-Atlantic distance using 12 fiber pairs [15]. In addition, the Grace Hopper system, also built for Google and to be completed in 2022, will carry an aggregate of >350 Tb/s over 6300 km across the Atlantic using 16 fiber pairs [16]. Furthermore, NEC announced that it will build a 24-fiber pair submarine cable for Meta, with a total capacity of 500 Tb/s [17], and HMN Technologies Company announced a next-generation submarine repeater prototype designed for 32 fiber pairs and a total capacity transmission beyond 700 Tb/s [18], indicating that it is only a matter of a few years until submarine cables will approach the 1-Pb/s mark per cable.\nThe purpose of this Special Issue of the PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE is to give an overview of the state of the art in fiber-optic communications technologies and an outlook on how these technologies will likely evolve in the future. While each paper in this Special Issue addresses a specific facet in more detail, this introductory paper examines general limits to optical fiber capacity scaling and approaches to overcome these limits. Throughout our discussions, it will become evident that massive parallelism is the only viable upgrade strategy to deal with a permanently looming capacity crunch. In this context, parallelism refers to the efficient use of spatial and spectral diversities to maximize transmission capacity while minimizing a transmission system\u2019s overall cost and energy consumption."

            "text": "The history of optical fiber communications to this day can be roughly divided into three major eras [2], [3], [6]. One may argue that the first era was set off in the second half of the 1970s with inventions such as vapor-phase axial deposition (VAD) that enabled mass production of highquality optical fibers [19], [20] and the announcement of the first 0.2-dB/km SMF at a wavelength of 1.55 \u03bcm [21], following the pioneering predictions of Nobel laureate Charles Kao in 1966 [22] and the pioneering work at Corning in 1970 on bringing down the attenuation of optical fibers for the first time to below 20 dB/km at\na wavelength of 0.633 \u03bcm [23]. Toward the end of the 1970s, fiber losses were already remarkably close to the fundamental limit of pure silica core fiber losses with the best fibers made today achieving losses of 0.142 dB/km at a wavelength of 1.56 \u03bcm [24], [25]. During this first era, optical transmission systems employed ON\u2013OFF keying (OOK), where laser light was simply switched ON and OFF to represent logical ones and zeros. The corresponding direct-detection receivers, i.e., optical power detectors, enabled optoelectronic regeneration and had to be periodically placed at distances of some 10 km. Data rates ranged from several 10 Mb/s to \u223c1 Gb/s. The transmission medium was originally based on multimode fibers (MMFs) but quickly transitioned to SMFs to eliminate modal dispersion, thereby achieving better transmission performance.\nThe second era was ushered in by the commercial introduction of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) [26], [27] in the mid-1990s [28]. In combination with chromatic dispersion (CD) management techniques [29] to reduce the impact of otherwise detrimental nonlinear propagation effects (in particular fourwave mixing due to the optical Kerr effect [30]), full exploitation of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), i.e., parallelism in the spectral domain, across the EDFA\u2019s gain spectrum was made possible. In an amplified WDM system, individual communications signals are transmitted simultaneously on sufficiently separated optical carrier frequencies. Due to increasingly more frequency-stable laser and optical filter technologies, initial WDM channel spacings of several 100 GHz were constantly reduced to as little as 25 GHz. Today, WDM spacings only slightly exceed the transponder\u2019s symbol rate and are typically between 50 and 200 GHz. By periodically compensating for optical losses in the optical domain, the EDFA enabled unregenerated transmission over many 1000 kilometers of optical fiber, i.e., the need for optoelectronic conversion was largely pushed toward the end nodes of a link. The above innovations led to unprecedented growth in long-haul fiber capacities in the 1990s and enabled costeffective high-speed data transmission over transoceanic distances. This not only largely improved voice communications (many international phone calls were still relayed via satellites at the time) but also became the key enabler of a universally accessible and widely affordable Internet over the following years. To a large part within that second era, transmission capacities per fiber of commercial WDM systems increased by a factor of 2 (i.e., by 100%) every year, from a few 10 Gb/s in the mid-1990s to about 5 Tb/s in the 2000s [31]. These systems employed bit rates of up to 40 Gb/s per wavelength using binary modulation [OOK and differential phase shift keying (DPSK)], which led to severe problems due to: 1) polarization mode dispersion (PMD) [32] causing pulse broadening due to randomly varying optical birefringence in the fiber and 2) the need to carefully adjust residual CD through tunable optical dispersion compensators. The reduced tolerance to noise from in-line optical amplifiers (OAs) was counteracted by distributed (Raman) amplification,\n1620 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nadvanced modulation (DPSK), and more powerful forward error correction (FEC). It was clear at the time that the step to 100 Gb/s per wavelength could not be accomplished in a commercially meaningful way through binary modulation at 100 GBaud1 but rather required higher order modulation, such as differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK), which was initially used in conjunction with direct-detection receivers to demonstrate 100-Gb/s optical networking [33]. Fortunately, the inherently faster paced progress of CMOS integrated circuits at 40% per year as opposed to the 20% progress in per-wavelength interface rates [3] enabled high-speed analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) together with the associated DSP to digitize and digitally process signals in the multi-GBaud range. In the early 2000s, high-speed ADCs started to be used for advanced 10-Gb/s detection of OOK using maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) [34] and high-speed DACs were used for digitally predistorted 10-Gb/s OOK [35].\nFrom then on, DSP rapidly enabled the third era of digital-coherent systems [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. The concept of digitally coherent optical receivers dates back to the early 1990s [44] and is, today, almost exclusively used by high-speed optical transmission systems exceeding a reach of \u223c100 km. Digital-coherent systems phase-lock a free-running local oscillator (LO) laser to the received signal through DSP in an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) after highspeed sampling/digitizing, thereby eliminating the need for analog LO frequency/phase locking that posed a major practical problem in earlier coherent (heterodyne and homodyne) systems, which did not make it into volume production [45]. In addition to digital phase-locking, modern coherent receivers also digitally undo any polarization rotations occurring along the transmission fiber, which allows the use of polarization-division multiplexing (PDM) and digitally compensates for nearly arbitrary amounts of CD and PMD. High-speed coherent systems also obviate the need for periodic in-line dispersion compensation to manage fiber nonlinearities, which considerably simplifies system design. In addition, the use of coherent detection allows one to modulate simultaneously the real and imaginary parts of the optical field via its two quadratures (i.e., sine and cosine components) and, thereby, enables the use of modulation formats at higher spectral efficiency (SE) than OOK and DPSK, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK). A further doubling of spectral efficiencies is achieved by using the optical field\u2019s two polarization states by means of PDM. Together this has enabled transmission at rates well above one bit of information per pulse (or equivalently one bit per symbol, one bit per channel use, or one bit per second per Hertz of channel bandwidth). Sophisticated modulation and FEC schemes can be used in concert with DSP to enable systems to operate close to their\n1Baud is the unit of the symbol rate, which refers to the number of pulses per second, i.e., 1 Baud = 1 symbol per second. One symbol (i.e., pulse) can represent one bit or several bits.\ntheoretical (Shannon) limits. Using all these advanced communications techniques, aggregate per-fiber capacities in commercial products have increased by roughly a factor of 7 over the last decade (i.e., \u223c20%/year) to a total of \u223c70 Tb/s for C + L-band system operation (see Fig. 9 for detailed information on the fiber-optic transmission band nomenclature).\nRecord research experiments based on C +L-band SMF transmission reported at top conferences for distances above 1000 km have hardly exceeded 100 Tb/s, which let the 100-Tb/s mark often be quoted as the \u201ccapacity limit\u201d of SMF. Note, however, that the 100-Tb/s mark certainly does not represent a hard capacity limit of SMF-based systems, as we will discuss in Section III-B. Nevertheless, operating long-haul systems at this capacity level indicates the proximity to operating near the Shannon limit and the near exhaustion of the EDFA bandwidth, which makes it increasingly difficult to deal effectively with further growth in data traffic. These limitations suggest that we are on the verge of entering the fourth era of optical communications, which may become known as the era of \u201cmassive parallelism\u201d and will manifest itself in space-division multiplexing (SDM), complemented in as far as economically beneficial by ultrawideband (UWB) transmission. SDM describes the multiplexing of signals in the spatial domain (in the form of parallel fibers, parallel fiber cores, or copropagating spatial modes), while UWB (or multiband) transmission exploits the simultaneous use of multiple transmission bands in a fiber\u2019s low-loss transmission window, known as the O-, E-, S-, and U -bands to complement the C- and L-bands supported by EDFAs and used in today\u2019s products. Such UWB systems come at the cost of more than twice the minimum possible fiber propagation loss and, as we will show in Section IV, are not nearly as scalable as SDM systems. Nevertheless, UWB approaches may be used as a stop-gap solution where the deployment of new cables cannot keep up with traffic demand in a short term, as well as in conjunction with SDM approaches in future systems, subject to applicable technoeconomic tradeoffs (see [46] and [47] for an example of technoeconomic tradeoffs in submarine systems and [48] for technoeconomic tradeoffs in data-center interconnect systems).\nIn the research community, SDM began to attract attention with the announcement of the first successful data transmission experiments based on direct detection through a 100-m multimode MCF using VCSELs [49], succeeded shortly thereafter by single-mode MCF transmission experiments over more than 10 km [50] with direct detection, and over more than 16 km [51] as well as 76 km [52] with coherent detection. In terms of exploiting multiple fiber modes in an MMF as parallel data transmission paths, early proposals go back to the 1980s [53], with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing of fiber modes proposed in the early 2000s [54]. The first few-mode fiber (FMF) transmission experiment that combined mode-selective optical signal launch and detection of a fiber\u2019s complete mode basis with digital coherent detection and MIMO DSP was reported\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1621\nin 2011 [55]. These and all subsequent SDM experiments (based on MFCs and FMFs, as well as variations and combinations thereof) demonstrated a clear advantage over SMF in terms of aggregate per-fiber spectral efficiencies and ultimately per-fiber capacities, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Moreover, coupled-core MCFs (CCFs) were also shown to outperform SMFs in terms of transmission distance, owing to a higher tolerance to nonlinear signal distortions [56].\nIn terms of field installations, a unique field-deployed SDM testbed is available in the city of L\u2019Aquila, Italy [57], [58], [59], and SDM fibers are expected to make their first appearance in operating networks over the next decade. Laboratory research progress on SDM fibers and related components, as well as network designs based on SDM concepts, have received tremendous research attention over the past decade. Furthermore, considerable efforts toward standardization and refined fabrication processes [60] are under way to bring SDM technologies closer to their adoption in commercial systems."

            "text": "The total capacity C of a polarization-multiplexed WDM transmission system can be written as\nC = 2 M m=1 N n=1 Rmn. (1)\nNote that, in line with common industry terminology, we loosely use the term \u201ccapacity\u201d throughout this article to\ndenote the net information throughput of a fiber-optic transmission system. In this context, the term \u201ccapacity\u201d as used here may denote a commercially specified system capacity, an experimentally measured system capacity, or may more rigorously refer to a system\u2019s achievable information rate (AIR), whose upper bound is given by the information-theoretically stricter definition of \u201ccapacity\u201d (see [67] and [68] for an overview of various capacity metrics used in the analysis of fiber-optic transmission systems). The factor of 2 in (1) represents polarization multiplexing,2 M is the number of parallel spatial paths (spatial parallelism), N is the number of WDM channels (spectral parallelism), and Rmn is the net information bit rate of a WDM channel. Modern systems can adapt their per-channel bit rate to the conditions of the respective WDM channel using, e.g., probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) [68], [70], [71], [72]: increasing the probability of the lower power inner constellation points and decreasing the probability of the higher power outer constellation points of a high-order modulation format (e.g., a 64-QAM template), a Gaussian constellation distribution can be approximated. A Gaussian constellation distribution is optimum for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Using PCS, the width of the Gaussian constellation distribution can be finely adapted to the channel\u2019s noise conditions. Note, in this context, that the fiber-optic channel in many modern optical transmission systems of practical interest can be modeled in good approximation by an AWGN channel, as we also assume throughout this article.\nIn the idealized case of a homogenous WDM system, where each WDM channel carries the same net information bit rate, i.e., Rmn = R, (1) can be simplified to\nC = 2MNR. (2)\nA homogeneous WDM system is defined as a system where each WDM channel: 1) uses the same modulation and coding at a uniform channel spacing; 2) has a constant channel bandwidth of Bch = B/N ; 3) has a constant launch power of Pch = P/N , with P being the total launch power; and 4) encounters the same transmission-line properties such as propagation loss, chromatic dispersion, amplifier noise figure etc.\nThe SE of an optical communication system is defined as the capacity per unit bandwidth, usually per spatial path and frequently (as also used in this article) per\n2As polarization is a fundamental modal property of waveguides, various authors sometimes consider 2M spatial modes by folding the polarization property of light into the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic mode field. A separation between polarization and spatial mode properties is possible for circular-symmetric fibers with a small index difference between the core and cladding, which leads to quasilinearly polarized (LP) pseudomodes [69].\n1622 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\npolarization, i.e.,\nSE = C\n2MB (3)\nwhere B is the optical system bandwidth encompassing all WDM channels. For a homogeneous WDM system, the SE can be written as\nSE = C\n2MNBch . (4)\nUsing (2), the per-channel net information bit rate in such a uniform WDM system is\nR = BchSE. (5)\nUnder the assumption of an AWGN channel, the SE is upper bounded3 by the Shannon limit [74], [75]\nSE = RS Bch log2 (1 + SNR) (6)\nwhere RS represents the symbol rate and SNR is the electrical signal-to-noise-ratio (i.e., the total signal power divided by the total noise power4 within a bandwidth corresponding to the symbol rate RS , assuming the use of Nyquist pulses). For a detailed discussion of the information theory of fiber-optic transmission systems, the reader may refer to, e.g., [7] and [67]. In practical systems, the SNR is furthermore affected by an implementation penalty \u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2264 1) accounting for effects, such as nonideal hardware and nonideal FEC decoding in the receiver, which are difficult to capture in the SNR (see, e.g., [76]), resulting in\nSE = RS Bch log2 (1 + \u03b7SNR) . (7)\nThe symbol rate is typically chosen smaller than the WDM channel bandwidth, RS \u2264 Bch. With ideal Nyquist pulses (i.e., sinc pulses), one can in principle achieve RS = Bch without incurring WDM crosstalk between neighboring channels. Practical systems use pulse shaping (sometimes also called spectral shaping) to generate root-raised-cosine (RRC) shaped pulses. These become Nyquist pulses after matched filtering at the receiver. RRC pulses have a finite spectral roll-off that broadens their spectral extent beyond RS . Pulse shaping involves a balance between digital shaping complexity, WDM channel spacing, WDM crosstalk, and bandwidth requirements of the transponder\n3If the channel is not AWGN, higher capacities are in principle achievable [67]. The fact that the exact statistics of some optical noise sources are unknown hints to the difficulties in speaking of a true information-theoretic \u201cShannon limit\u201d of the fiber-optic channel and let expressions such as (6) only be Shannon limit estimates [73].\n4In a single-polarization system, the SNR takes into account signal power and noise power in a single polarization. In a polarizationmultiplexed (or dual-polarization) system, the SNR takes into account signal and noise powers in both polarizations. In this article, we consider only the practically more relevant dual-polarization case.\nelectronics. Note that pulse shaping applies to the shaping of the analog signal waveform and should not be confused with constellation shaping (mentioned earlier in this section), which applies to the shaping of the digital symbol alphabet [77]. Together with the use of a guard band between WDM channels, to accommodate laser and optical filter frequency drifts, RS < Bch in practical systems.\n5 The relationship between RS and Bch is given by\nRS = 1\n(1 + \u03c1ro) (1 + \u03c1gb) Bch (8)\nwhere \u03c1ro (\u03c1ro \u2265 0) denotes a roll factor and \u03c1gb (\u03c1gb \u2265 0) is a guard band ratio. Today\u2019s commercial systems typically use RS/Bch of \u223c0.6 for datacenter interconnect (DCI) applications (<100 km), \u223c0.6\u20130.9 for terrestrial mesh networking applications, and even slightly above 0.9 for some submarine applications.\nSpatial parallelism is achieved by multiplexing each data signal onto a different spatial path (i.e., parallel fibers, parallel cores in an MCF, or multiple modes in an FMF or CCF). Spectral parallelism uses different carrier wavelengths for each WDM channel. The bit rate R of a WDM channel is determined by the underlying modulation and coding within a channel bandwidth Bch. The symbol rate that may be used by a WDM channel is determined by the speed of optical modulators and detectors, including the associated analog, ADC, and DAC electronics. Commercial systems operate at symbol rates in the 25\u2013150-GBaud range, leading to typical WDM channel bandwidths Bch between 50 and 200 GHz. In research experiments, symbol rates of \u223c200 GBaud have been demonstrated [78], [79]. Interestingly, symbol rates in research experiments have not shown any notable progress much beyond the 200-GBaud mark since 2016 and seem to have saturated around that level, as the associated electronics with electrical bandwidths beyond 100 GHz are exceedingly difficult to build.6\nIn the following discussion, we assume that RS = Bch, i.e., a roll-off factor of 0 and no guard bands. The SE then also represents the information rate, i.e., the number of information bits per modulation symbol. While it may seem straightforward to increase the SE [and, thus, the bit rate at a fixed symbol rate; cf. (5)] by using a higher order QAM template for PCS, the logarithmic scaling of the SE with the SNR [cf. (6)] makes a K-fold increase in SE require at least a 2K-fold increase in SNR, which is increasingly difficult to achieve for higher K.\nTo appreciate the difficulties in increasing the SNR, we examine the factors that influence the SNR in a coherent\n5In some system experiments, partial-response modulation, fasterthan-Nyquist modulation, and single-sideband modulation are being used, all of which can operate at RS > Bch. However, none of these modulation schemes offers an SE advantage over complex modulation using ideal Nyquist pulses, i.e., SE \u2264 log2 (1 + SNR) remains the limit for all such systems.\n6In fact, the most recent announced record experiment with a symbol rate of 260 GBaud [80] is also limited by 75-GHz bandwidth electronics and therefore had to resort to optical equalization. Also note that the highest available symbol rate does not necessarily lead to the highest bit rate [77].\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1623\npolarization multiplexed system. In such a system, the SNR is given by\nSNR = Pch\nPSH + PASE + PTRX + PNLIN + PXT (9a)\nwhere Pch denotes the dual-polarization signal power per WDM channel launched into the fiber at the transmitter and restored by every OA following a transmission span (see Fig. 7). Alternatively, the SNR can also be expressed as\n1\nSNR =\n1\nSNRSH +\n1\nSNRASE +\n1\nSNRTRX +\n1\nSNRNLIN +\n1\nSNRXT\n= 1\nSNR1 +\n1\nSNR0 +\n1\nSNR\u22122\n= 1\nSNRL +\n1\nSNRNLIN . (9b)\nThe first line of (9b) separates the total system SNR into its individual physical effects. The second line separates the SNR according to its dependency on Pch: a term SNR1 that depends linearly on Pch (SNRSH and SNRASE), a term SNR0 that is independent of Pch (SNRTRX and SNRXT), and a term SNR-2 that depends inverse quadratically on Pch (SNRNLIN).7 The third line then groups SNR0 and SNR1 into a linear SNR term SNRL and rewrites SNR-2 as the nonlinear SNR term SNRNLIN. PSH is shot noise (typically dominated by LO shot noise in a coherent receiver), and PASE is noise due to accumulated amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) generated by in-line optical amplification within the WDM channel\u2019s signal bandwidth. Expressions for PSH and PASE are given in the Appendix. Practical transponders exhibit a noise floor resulting in a maximally achievable SNR, denoted SNRTRX, which is reflected by PTRX = \u03baPch (i.e., SNRTRX = 1/\u03ba) in (9) with \u03ba 1 [82], [83], [84]. The nonlinear interference noise (NLIN) PNLIN = \u03c7P 3 ch is an equivalent noise term due to the presence of Kerr nonlinearities in the optical transmission fiber. The NLI coefficient \u03c7 can be derived using a time-domain model [65], [85], [86], or from analytic equations based on the frequency-domain Gaussian Noise (GN) model [87], [88]. Key equations underlying the results shown in this paper are summarized in the Appendix. Finally, PXT = \u03bePch captures uncompensated linear crosstalk effects, such as crosstalk from imperfect optical add/drop multiplexers (MUXs), crosstalk from multipath interference (MPI), crosstalk from neighboring WDM channels, length-dependent crosstalk from guided acousticwave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) [89], [90], [91], and crosstalk between parallel spatial paths in an SDM system. Some transponders actively compensate for linear crosstalk through digital echo cancellation or MIMO DSP.\n7Note that SNR terms with other signal power dependencies exist as well but are neglected here as they are typically not dominant. For example, a term SNR\u22121 can include an insufficiently suppressed interference term due to self-mixing (direct detection term) of multiple channels being detected by an intradyne receiver, which can become important, e.g., in colorless wavelength drop situations with an insufficient common mode rejection ratio [81].\nPXT can be relevant in form of GAWBS at ultralong transmission distances or in an SDM system using, e.g., nominally uncoupled MCFs (as discussed in more detail in Section V-A1). Although some noise terms in (9) may not be strictly additive Gaussian, assuming them to be additive Gaussian has so far not contradicted any measured data from practical systems in terms of their capacity limit estimates.\nAt sufficiently low optical powers, both PNLIN and PTRX are negligible, and the SNR increases linearly with optical launch power until the SNR saturates due to PTRX and/or PXT. At optical signal powers that are high enough to let PNLIN dominate all other noise terms, the SNR becomes inversely proportional to the square of the signal power. These dependencies of the SNR on the optical signal power are illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Typical optical signal launch powers in terrestrial long-haul systems are chosen to maximize the SNR, at a point where PNLIN is not negligible but also not dominant, and the SNR peaks at an optimum launch power [7], [67]. Using this peak SNR in the Shannon formula [cf. (6)] has become widely known as the \u201cnonlinear Shannon limit\u201d or the \u201cfiberoptic Shannon limit,\u201d but stated more precisely, due to the many underlying assumptions, this process only yields an estimate of the practically achievable capacity of whatever particular fiber transmission system is being investigated.\nThe transponder noise floor PTRX is mainly due to practical limitations from the transmitter and receiver electronics. This includes quantization noise from ADCs and DACs, an imbalance (skew) between the signals in the modulator\u2019s in-phase and quadrature arms used to generate QAM formats [92], [93], as well as any magnitude and phase mismatch in the frequency responses between nominally identical high-speed analog electronic components, which generally becomes more pronounced at high symbol rates. Other factors contributing to a residual noise floor comprise phase noise of the transmitter and LO laser, as characterized by the respective laser linewidths, and the inherent dithering of digital filter parameters in adaptive DSP control loops. This practically relevant noise floor, which is rarely considered in theoretical fiber capacity analyses, caps the system capacity even if the fundamental limitations due to ASE and NLIN would still allow for higher system throughputs. Typical high-speed optical transponders in commercial products operate at an SNRTRX of \u223c20 dB [94], [95], record high-SE research results at much reduced symbol rates have achieved an SNRTRX of \u223c30 dB [96], [97], and laboratory results exploiting special techniques, such as single-sideband modulation (SSB) in conjunction with image-band rejecting heterodyning at the receiver, have shown to reach an SNRTRX of \u223c38 dB, albeit only at low symbol rates [93]. For the system analyses presented in this article, it is reasonable to assume that realistic transponders in the foreseeable future will not exceed an SNRTRX of 30 dB (i.e., \u03ba = 10\u22123). The limiting effect on the SNR due to SNRTRX is clearly visible in Fig. 2(a), where the SNR peak reflecting the tradeoff between ASE and NLIN is substantially\n1624 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nflattened for transmission distances below a few hundred kilometers. The severe impact of SNRTRX can also be seen at longer transmission distances for ultralow-loss and\nultralow-nonlinearity fibers, as discussed in Section IV-A1. The calculations shown in Fig. 2 assume distributed amplification, no implementation penalty (i.e., \u03b7 = 1) and a homogenous WDM system across the C + L-band (11.5 THz) operating over a standard SMF. Key formulas and parameter assumptions used in these calculations are summarized in the Appendix.\nFig. 2(b) shows the achievable SE as a function of SNRL, the portion of the SNR that comprises SNR0 and SNR1, i.e., is only due to linear effects. Neglecting, first, all nonlinearities, transponder noise floor, and crosstalk (i.e., PNLIN = 0, PTRX = 0, and PXT = 0), SNR is linearly proportional to the signal launch power Pch. As reflected by the black dotted curve in Fig. 2(b), this lets the SE grow unbounded with increasing Pch at a rate of \u223c1 bit/s/Hz per 3-dB increase in Pch (or SNRL) for SNRL 1 (i.e., SE \u2248 SNRL,dB/3 for SNRL 1). The dashed curves include NLIN but still do not include a transponder noise floor or crosstalk yet. Increasing the signal launch power eventually lets PNLIN become the dominant noise term, and the SE peaks at an SNRL that is referred to as the nonlinear optimum. This peak SNR decreases approximately by 3 dB for each doubling of system reach L. Finally, when including PTRX or a mathematically equivalent crosstalk term PXT, SNRL saturates at its respective floor (SNR0) with increasing Pch. In the case of Fig. 2(b), this happens at an SNRTRX of 30 dB, as we assume no additional crosstalk here, i.e., PXT = 0. This saturation can occur at an SNRL that is significantly below the NLIN-ASE (nonlinear) optimum. At short distances, the SE drops sharply near SNRL = SNRTRX, which is because SNRTRX can only be approached for very large Pch where NLIN lets the SE drop to 0. This implies that practical systems up to about 100 km are capacity-limited by their transponder noise floors rather than by NLIN. This capacity limitation may, however, extend to many thousands of kilometers for ultralowloss and ultralow-nonlinearity fibers, as discussed in Section IV-A1.\nFig. 2(c) displays the tradeoff between SE and transmission distance. The y-axis represents the aggregate SE over M spatial and N spectral channels. The red dashed line represents a system with M \u00d7N = 1 without transponder noise floor, and the red and orange solid curves apply for an SNRTRX of 30 and 25 dB, respectively. An SE below these curves is achievable by proper modulation and coding, while values above these curves are not achievable without spatial (M) or spectral (N) parallelism. The optical launch power is optimized for each transmission distance so that the system always operates at its peak SE [cf. Fig. 2(b)]. At the respective optimum signal launch power and in the absence of PTRX (dashed line), the interplay of ASE and NLIN deteriorates the SE approximately linearly on a logarithmic scale, with a slope of almost exactly 1 bit/s/Hz for every doubling in transmission distance (equivalent to the above-mentioned \u223c3-dB drop in SNR) [7]. This slope applies down to an SE of \u223c2 bit/s/Hz (i.e., SNR of \u223c5 dB) where the curve starts to level off as the \u201c1+\u201d\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1625\nterm within the logarithm of the Shannon formula [cf. (6)] starts to become nonnegligible [this regime is beyond the axis ranges of Fig. 2(c)].\nIn practical systems, effects such as electronically enhanced phase noise (EEPN) [101], [102] and GAWBS, both of which contribute to the SNR0 term [cf. (9b)], also reduce SE (and, thus, capacity), but their effects are more prominent at large transmission distances. At distances below 1000 km, SNRTRX starts to dominate capacity and manifests in a capacity saturation. This saturation effect is also evident from the record experimental results shown as markers in Fig. 2(c). From these observations, it is also clear that the often-cited capacity-distance product cannot be used for an objective performance comparison of optical communication systems: increasing system reach by a factor m at a fixed SE is, in general, easier to achieve than increasing SE by the same factor m at a fixed reach. Instead of the frequently used capacity-distance product (or equivalently the SE \u00d7 L product), the correct metric to compare optical fiber systems (for SNR 1 and at transmission distances where noise is not dominated by PTRX) is 2SE \u00d7 L [48], [103]. In this regime, doubling transmission distance at fixed SE is a similar achievement as increasing the SE by 1 bit/s/Hz at a fixed distance.\nIn terms of system capacity scaling, consider as a target the aggregate SE of 14 bit/s/Hz at 1000 km [solid green marker in Fig. 2(c)], which implies a doubling in SE relative to a state-of-the-art system and is well beyond the 7 bit/s/Hz at 1000-km limit that is achievable through modulation and coding (red open circle marker). The SE of 14 bit/s/Hz could, in principle, be achieved only by modulation and coding if serially concatenating 100{M \u00d7 N = 1} systems at 14 bit/s/Hz with an individual reach of 10 km per system (green open marker on the red dashed line). Apart from being nonviable from an energy and cost perspective [103], this approach goes far beyond the capabilities of practical transponder electronics in terms of SNRTRX (red or orange solid curve) and must, therefore, be ruled out. Hence, the only practical option to double capacity is to employ multiplexing parallelism, either by doubling the spectral channels (N \u2192 2N), or by doubling the number of spatial channels (M \u2192 2M), or more generally by doubling the product of spatial and spectral channels (MN \u2192 2MN). All these options are reflected by the green curve in Fig. 2(c). To accommodate even the lowest predicted traffic growth rates of 40% per year, such a doubling would be needed every other year. It is, thus, evident that the exploitation of massive spatial and spectral parallelism is mandatory to deal with exponential traffic growth throughout all network segments."

            "text": "Various estimates exist today for the nonlinear Shannon limit of different optical fiber types as a function of system bandwidth B and transmission distance L [1], [7], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66]. A paper devoted to the information-theoretic aspects of the Shannon capacity is also part of this Special Issue [67].\nHowever, an exact answer to this question with practically relevant parameter sets has not yet been and is unlikely to be derived, even under realistically idealized conditions. In addition, almost all accounts of fiber capacity limits assume ideal transponders without a noise floor represented by SNRTRX. Furthermore, the fundamental ability and the realistic practicality to digitally compensate for fiber nonlinearities depend on whether point-to-point systems or optical mesh networks are being considered [7] and what kinds of WDM nonlinearity compensation (NLC) strategies are being pursued [104], [105]. Finally, the maximum total power Ptot \u2265 P (where P is the total signal launch power and represents the case without any Raman pumps) that can be safely propagated in an optical fiber is limited by the fiber fuse effect [106], a destructive fusion phenomenon occurring in the fiber center due to hot plasma formed at contaminated connector end faces, microcracks, or tight fiber bends. The fiber fuse threshold depends on the fiber design and is estimated to be between 1 and 2 W (30\u201333 dBm) for the safe operation of deployed communication fibers [107], [108]. In other words, a fiber capacity limit can certainly not be represented by a single number, such as the frequently quoted \u201c100 Tb/s,\u201d even if that number captures the rough order of magnitude of the limit of practical long-haul fiber-optic communication system designs operating over today\u2019s commercial system bandwidths.\nTo illustrate the interplay of the parameters B, L, and SNRTRX, Fig. 3 depicts a range of estimated capacities and optimum total launch powers P for a lightwave system as a function of transmission distance, calculated with the GN model (for details on the model, see the Appendix) for three transmission bands: the C-band (1530\u20131565 nm or 4.4 THz), the C + L-band (1530\u20131625 nm or 11.5 THz), and the S + C + L-band (1460\u20131625 nm or 20.9 THz). Some realistic assumptions for a system with lumped optical amplification are given in Table 1 where nsp is the amplifier\u2019s spontaneous emission factor corresponding to the given noise figure if the amplifier is operated with sufficient gain, i.e., G 1, as discussed in the Appendix. Assumptions about the fiber parameters are also stated in the Appendix. As exemplified in Fig. 3(a), if a system of this kind is operated only in the C-band, it could never reach the 100-Tb/s mark; if operated in the C + L-band, it could transmit 100 Tb/s up to \u223c3 000 km; and if operated in the S + C + L band it could potentially transmit 100 Tb/s even beyond 10 000 km. The markers in Fig. 3(a) show recent experimental records. The main reason why short-reach transmission experiments for the C-, C + L-, and S + C + L-bands experience difficulties in reaching capacities above \u223c60, \u223c140, and \u223c260 Tb/s is due to a maximum transponder SNR below 25 dB, and why particularly ultrawideband systems have difficulties in reaching their Shannon limit estimates (cf. Fig. 11) is also due to higher amplifier noise figures and higher implementation penalties resulting from higher band-splitter/combiner losses and stimulated Raman scattering [113]. As shown in\n1626 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nFig. 3(b), the estimated optimum signal launch power becomes nearly independent of distance [7] for transmission distances exceeding a few span lengths. For short transmission distances below the respective span lengths of 50 and 100 km, the system consists of only a single amplified span. At intermediate transmission distances of less than \u223c10 span lengths, the effect of a shorter final span, following an integer number of spans, manifests itself in a wavy curve, as explained in more detail in Section IV-A3 (in conjunction with Fig. 8). We note that, despite the idealization assumed in our model based on a homogeneous WDM system, the estimated ranges of power are in good agreement with the total launch powers used in the experiments. From Fig. 3(b), it is also evident that, even for a fully loaded S + C + L-band system, the total system launch power is still about a factor of 3\u20135 (i.e., \u223c5\u20137 dB) lower than the power threshold of the fiber fuse. However, when used in conjunction with distributed Raman amplification instead of or in addition to lumped optical amplification, optical power levels within a fiber\nmay get substantially higher. This may leave only little margin to further increase the transmission bandwidth due to the need for several Raman pumps per transmission band with typically >100-mW optical output power per pump [114]. In addition, once system bandwidths exceed the Raman gain bandwidth of \u223c13 THz, Raman pumps and signal wavelengths start to spectrally overlap, which reduces fiber capacity due to the need to depopulate signals in lower wavelength regions of the system bandwidth, where Raman pumps are situated to amplify the longer wavelength regions of the system bandwidth [115]."

            "text": "1) Reducing Fiber Loss and Nonlinearity: Both fiber loss and fiber nonlinearity are responsible for noise accumulation during transmission: loss needs to be compensated by OAs that add noise, and nonlinearity both limits the maximum signal launch power (which makes amplification necessary in the first place) and also causes signal distortions that manifest, to a good approximation, as GN in modern coherent systems without in-line optical dispersion compensation, which is the basis for an equivalent NLIN term in the SNR [cf. (9)]. Since the announcement of the first 0.2-dB/km fiber in 1979 [21], much research effort has been devoted to further reduce the impact of fiber loss and nonlinearity, resulting in today\u2019s record-low loss and nonlinear coefficients of \u223c0.14 dB/km and \u223c0.6 (W \u00b7 km)\u22121 obtained with pure silica-core fibers [24], [25].\nOn a parallel research path, hollow-core fibers (HCFs) have been investigated for over two decades. These fibers promise substantially reduced propagation loss and nonlinearity, far beyond the fundamental limits of solidcore fibers [116]. In recent years, impressive progress in fabricating a special variant of low-loss HCF known as\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1627\nthe nested antiresonant nodeless fiber (NANF) [117] has heightened expectations that this type of HCF may be able to replace solid-core SMFs in the future. Simulations predict loss coefficients to be as low as \u223c0.02 dB/km and nonlinear coefficients that are three to four orders of magnitude lower compared to those of their solid-core counterparts [117]. However, the capacity gains of such fibers on a systems\u2019 level are fairly small, as both a reduced fiber loss and nonlinearity coefficient \u201conly\u201d improve the SNR, which merely results in a logarithmic impact on capacity [cf. (6)]. To quantify the potential capacity benefits of a NANF system relative to an SMF system, Fig. 4 shows the SE gain of a lumped-amplified NANF system over an ideal distributed-amplified (reference) SMF system: 1) without and 2) with a transponder SNR limit of 30 dB. Lumped amplification for the NANF system has to be assumed because distributed Raman amplification relies on fiber nonlinearities and due to their very low nonlinearities being inherently difficult to achieve in HCFs. The SMF parameters are the same as those used for Fig. 2 (for fiber parameter details, see the Appendix). Both systems have\na total link length of 1000 km and operate across the C +L-band. Note that the choice of using the same system bandwidth for both fiber types in this comparison was not dictated by limitations in the bandwidth of either fiber but by limitations in the bandwidth of practically available optical amplifiers.\nThe NANF system is equipped with ideal lumped amplifiers (nsp = 1) at uniform span lengths of 100 km. The NANF\u2019s dispersion parameter is assumed as 2 ps/nm/km [118]. Its loss coefficient \u03b1 is varied between 0.001 and 0.2 dB/km, and its nonlinear coefficient \u03b3 is varied between 0.0001 and 1.3 (W \u00b7 km)\u22121. The green area depicts all {\u03b1, \u03b3} combinations that result in a NANF SE gain > 1 relative to the SMF reference system. The blue marker near the bottom of the figures represents an \u201cideal NANF\u201d with the best loss and nonlinear coefficients numerically predicted to-date (\u03b1 = 0.02 dB/km and \u03b3 = 0.00013 W\u22121km\u22121) [117]. The total optimal launch power (across all WDM channels) was calculated to be \u223c40 dBm for the ideal NANF and \u223c18 dBm for the SMF reference system. Disregarding the practical difficulties of reliably generating such power levels with uniform spectral density across the C+L-band, SE gains of \u223c2.4 could, in principle, be achieved for the ideal NANF and ideal transponders. An optimistic practical transponder noise floor of 30 dB reduces this value to \u223c1.4. A noise floor of 20 dB, reflecting the current state of the art in high-speed commercial transponders, reduces the benefit of NANFs to only \u223c1.1.\nTo better understand why a transponder noise floor has such a dramatic impact on the SE gain potential of an ideal NANF system, Fig. 5 depicts the SE as a function of transmission distance L for the cases of the ideal NANF system, the ideal distributed-amplified SMF reference system, and a more realistic lumped-amplified low-loss SMF\n1628 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nsystem (SMFLL, see the Appendix for parameter details). Due to the transponder SNR limit, the SE of the NANF is clamped to \u223c10 bit/s/Hz. In other words, it is the noise floor of practical transponders that prevent NANFs from reaching their full potential. The SE gain with respect to the SMF systems increases with transmission distance but does not exceed a factor of 3 (a factor of 2 in the case of SNRTRX = 20 dB) even for trans-Pacific distances up to 10 000 km [84]. But, even without a transponder noise floor, Fig. 5 shows that the SE gain of NANFs is limited to between 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 (ratio of dashed lines) across relevant transmission distances, satisfying traffic demand increases for no more than four years, even in the most optimistic scenario.\nFinally, we also note that these SE gains were obtained without considering intermodal interference (IMI)8 within the NANF. We estimate that IMI would have to be less than \u221260 dB/km across the whole transmission band in order to not significantly impact transmission performance at trans-Pacific distances. In this respect, we also note that the effect on the SE due to crosstalk in form of IMI at a certain distance is identical to that of a transponder noise floor at the same value since both noise terms constitute SNR0 [cf. (9b)]. For example, the individual noise contribution of IMI with \u221260 dB/km at L = 1000 km is identical to a transponder noise floor at \u221230 dB, and thus, IMI by itself reduces the SE to 10 bit/s/Hz (cf. blue solid line in Fig. 5) at L = 1000 km. Furthermore, the combined effect of IMI and an actual transponder noise floor would bring down the SE to 9 bit/s/Hz as the 1/SNR0 term dominates all other 1/SNR terms in this particular example with an ultralow-loss and ultralow-nonlinearity NANF at L = 1000 km. The relationship of these noise terms is further discussed in Section V-A1. The latest NANF designs have demonstrated an IMI suppression down to \u221256 dB/km on average, with a variation of \u00b12 dB/km across the C-band, uncabled, and under controlled laboratory conditions [119]. Although these accomplishments are very impressive from a technological perspective, from a systems perspective, we conclude that even the most optimistic IMI suppression, and loss and nonlinear characteristics of NANFs are not able to offer a sufficient SE gain benefit with respect to SMFs that would be needed to effectively deal with exponential traffic growth in the long term.\n2) Reducing the Effect of Nonlinearities in the Digital Domain: The SNR of (9) can also be improved by reducing PNLIN through digital NLC [104], [105], which can be performed on only one channel (intrachannel NLC) or across multiple WDM channels (interchannel NLC), as shown in Fig. 6. Interchannel NLC is limited by three key aspects: first, in order to perform interchannel NLC, one needs to get digitally sampled versions of multiple\n8By design, NANFs cannot be made purely single-moded. IMI represents a length- and wavelength-dependent crosstalk to the data-carrying fundamental mode from undesired copropagating and constantly crosscoupling higher order modes.\nWDM channels into a common ASIC for joint processing. However, typical coherent DSP ASICs process only a single channel (with some exceptions having two processor cores) due to the large involved algorithmic complexities that need to be performed in real time at high speeds and make multichannel DSPs quickly untenable.9 Even if such NLC coprocessing were done, multichannel NLC has been shown to quickly lead to diminishing returns [105]. Second, to effectively compensate for interchannel nonlinearities, WDM channels should propagate alongside each other from the same transmitter to the same receiver. This scenario applies to point-to-point systems (such as is the case for most submarine links) but does not apply to terrestrial optical mesh networks, where individual wavelengths are routinely routed to different fibers throughout the network at reconfigurable optical add/drop MUX (ROADM) nodes, and neighboring channels at any given receiver will generally only have shared a fraction of their nonlinear propagation path. Third, the nonlinear mixing of signals and ASE sets a fundamental limit to NLC [7]. Finally, just as with the reduction of fiber loss and nonlinearity coefficients, even a heroic 3-dB increase in SNR due to NLC only amounts to a 1-bit/s/Hz increase in the per-polarization SE, which is negligible in the bigger picture of an annual traffic growth rate of 40% or more.\n3) Reducing the Noise Generated by Optical Amplification: The SNR of a transmission link also depends on the type and amount of optical amplification. Owing to the loss of SMF, transmission distances significantly exceeding 100 km make periodic in-line amplification mandatory to obtain sufficient SNR at the receiver. In-line amplification is carried out with either lumped or distributed amplification, as illustrated in Fig. 7.\nThe by-far most widely deployed lumped OA is the EDFA. Submarine cables typically use regular amplification spans between 50 and 100 km, while terrestrial systems place amplifiers approximately every 80\u2013120 km, depending on\n9At 100 GBaud, 1.5\u00d7 oversampling, and 8 bits of ADC resolution, the aggregate bit rate of the digitized samples of only a single WDM channel (with two quadratures and two polarizations) amounts to 4.8 Tb/s that need to be real-time processed by the coherent DSP.\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1629\nthe available locations of repeater huts. Each amplifier nominally compensates for the loss of the preceding span, i.e., the amplifier has a gain of G = e\u03b1LS , where LS is the length of the preceding span. The ASE power accumulated per WDM channel over the total transmission distance can be expressed as PASE = 2nspNshfRS(e\n\u03b1LS \u2212 1), where nsp is the amplifier\u2019s spontaneous emission factor (whose relation to the amplifier\u2019s noise figure is discussed in the Appendix), NS is the number of spans, h is Planck\u2019s constant, f is the optical carrier frequency, and RS is the symbol rate.\nThe most commonly used distributed amplification scheme is Raman amplification [114], where several pump lasers operating at wavelengths about 100 nm (\u223c13 THz) shorter than the signal wavelengths amplify the signals via stimulated Raman scattering by directly pumping the transmission fiber, usually with an optical power on the order of a few 100 mW. Raman pumping schemes comprise both forward pumping (FWP) and backward pumping (BWP). Higher order bidirectional pumping (where secondary and sometimes tertiary Raman pumps are used to pump the primary Raman pumps) generates the least variation in the gain experienced by the signal as it propagates down the transmission fiber, thus approximating the ideal case of maintaining constant signal power along the link. This, however, comes at the expense of MPI that must be taken into account in practical system designs [120]. The ASE noise power depends on the Raman gain coefficient, the fiber loss, and the pump power distribution along the fiber. Under the assumption of ideal distributed amplification, where the signal power and gain stay constant across the entire fiber, the ASE power is given by PASE = 2hfRSKT\u03b1L, which represents the minimum ASE noise power generated by an amplified system [7]. KT is proportional to the phonon occupancy factor and amounts to \u223c1.14 for realistic Raman amplification [114]. Assuming ideal distributed amplification with KT = 1 in the GN model results in an optimistic estimate for the capacity of a system that uses distributed amplification. As indicated\nby the black double arrows in Fig. 8, for regional to longhaul lightwave systems (i.e., NS 1), the SE degradation (relative to ideal distributed amplification) due to lumped amplification amounts to \u223c0.6 bit/s/Hz per polarization for LS = 50 km and \u223c1.6 bit/s/Hz for LS = 100 km. The amplifiers\u2019 spontaneous emission factor is assumed to be 1 (corresponding to a noise figure of 3 dB if the amplifier is operated with sufficient gain, i.e., G 1). All other parameter assumptions are the same as those used in Fig. 2 (for fiber parameter details, see the Appendix).\nNote that, for systems with short transmission distances below the respective span lengths of 50 and 100 km, the system consists of only a single amplified span with a span length equal to the transmission distance. This lets the curves representing lumped amplification in Fig. 8 converge toward the curve representing distributed amplification with decreasing transmission distance. In a similar vein, for cases where the transmission distance is not an integer multiple of the span length, the final span consists of an amplified span with a reduced length. The presence of a shorter final span manifests in small ripples that are only visible for a few spans. Also note that this graph already indicates the potential of a substantial capacity gain in power-limited systems when taking out every other amplifier (i.e., increasing the span length by a factor of 2) and using the freed-up amplifier power to set up a parallel spatial path to double the reduced capacity. For example, at 1000 km, a 50-km span system has an SE of 6.6 bit/s/Hz. Taking out every other amplifier reduces the SE to 5.5 bit/s/Hz, which adds up to an aggregate SE of 11 bit/s/Hz when using the freed-up amplifiers in a second spatial path. This strategy, which will be discussed in more detail in Section IV-C, works provided that: 1) doubling the total number of transponders and the total\n1630 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\npower consumed by those transponders is tolerable and 2) the amplifiers do not consume significantly more power when providing twice as much gain for the same output power.\nRaman amplification achieves gain bandwidths of \u223c13 THz (100 nm) if pump wavelength and signal wavelength are kept in disjoint wavelength bands [114], [121]. Larger amplification bandwidths can only be achieved by sharing the system bandwidth between the signal and Raman pumps [115]. On the other hand, doped amplifiers typically achieve only \u223c5 THz of gain bandwidth. Semiconductor OAs (SOAs) [122], [123] can achieve much wider lumped amplification bandwidths than doped amplifiers but generally attain worse noise performance than EDFAs.\nParametric amplifiers [124] have attracted considerable attention in the research community as they promise a reduced noise figure at the expense of more complicated to manage phase-sensitive amplification. A reach improvement of up to 5.6\u00d7 has been demonstrated experimentally [125]. However, these benefits of parametric amplification come at the cost of: 1) using twice the bandwidth due to the need to copropagating an idler (i.e., a phaseconjugated copy of the signal) and the pump signal; and 2) increased system complexity due to the need for pump recovery and dispersion control at each amplifier stage. Sacrificing half the available system bandwidth for a potential 3-dB SNR advantage will in most scenarios reduce system capacity, as bandwidth is a prelog factor to capacity, while the SNR is inside the logarithm [cf. (6)]. It is, thus, unlikely that parametric amplification can effectively deal with exponential traffic growth in operational networks in the future."

            "text": "The costs associated with installing new regional and long-haul fiber are very high, on the order of $20 000 per kilometer, provided that ducts already exist. These costs are by far dominated by cable installation costs, as standard SMF strands cost less than $10 per kilometer in volume [48]. Therefore, and in contrast to short-reach applications, where cable deployment costs are much lower, regional and long-haul systems must exploit the vast installed fiber base to scale capacity as much as possible. This is done through multiband transmission systems, e.g., by deploying an L-band system in addition to an existing C-band system on the same fiber to double capacity. When considering multiband systems to boost the capacity of the installed fiber base, the loss distribution of already deployed fibers across the intended operating bands becomes a key consideration. Fig. 9 shows the loss distribution of various fiber types as a function of optical frequency. Note that, in contrast to typically published representations, the figure has the optical frequency as its lower x-axis and, only for reference purposes, shows the optical wavelength at its upper x-axis. Plotting wideband\nsystems on a linear wavelength axis can be misleading because the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength makes \u201cbandwidths\u201d on a wavelength axis appear larger at longer wavelengths than they are when expressed in terms of frequency. For example, 150 nm centered in the L-band and 100 nm centered in theO-band both correspond to a frequency bandwidth of \u223c17.5 THz. Yet, it is the bandwidth measured in units of frequency (and not in units of wavelength) that matters in terms of system capacity [cf. (1)]. As can be seen from the blue double arrows in Fig. 9, the C + L-band has a bandwidth of 11.5 THz at a \u223c0.2-dB/km loss level. When tolerating a loss coefficient of 0.23 dB/km, the SMF bandwidth extends to 23 THz, and 65 THz when tolerating a loss coefficient of 0.4 dB/km, which increases the system bandwidth by a factor of 2 and \u223c6 relative to the C + L-band, respectively. The need to compensate for twice as much dB-loss has negative implications on the system design and energy budget, but the effect only impacts capacity logarithmically (through the SNR), as opposed to the linear capacity scaling when expanding system bandwidth. Shortening amplification spans through new repeater huts (if operationally viable) can help to mitigate higher losses at the edges of the system operating bands.\nApart from the SMF loss spectrum, Fig. 9 also shows experimentally measured loss curves of three recently fabricated NANFs (NANF-A/B/C) [119], [126] together with the results of an optimistic simulation of a NANF [117] discussed in Section IV-A1, which predicts an unrivaled 0.2-dB/km bandwidth of 110 THz, about 10\u00d7 that of deployed SMF. Note, however, that the motivation to go to UWB systems is primarily to reuse existing fiber infrastructure. Therefore, the deployment of NANFs has to compete against the new installation of multiple parallel SMF strands or other value propositions. For example, the ultralow loss of these fibers, provided that cabling and splices do not add substantial loss once a NANF cable is actually deployed over long distances in the field, may enable long-haul transmission systems without any optical amplification [see also Fig. 7(c)] [127]: Assuming a uniform loss coefficient of 0.02 dB/km across the C + L-band (11.5 THz), an analysis similar to that carried out in Section IV-A1 reveals a maximum SE gain of \u223c1.5 for an unamplified NANF relative to a distributed-amplified SMF system for a transmission distance of 2000 km, as depicted in Fig. 10. The results apply for an SNRTRX of 30 dB. An SNRTRX of 20 dB reduces the benefit of an unamplified ultralow-loss NANF system to \u223c1.2, as shown in Fig. 10(b), showing the SE gain of an unamplified ideal NANF system relative to an SMF system with distributed amplification as a function of SNRTRX (or SNR0) for different transmission distances. Note, however, that such low losses will be difficult to maintain in a deployed systems context as splices and cabling will unavoidably induce additional losses. As evident from Fig. 10(a), an additional loss of only \u223c0.015 dB/km suffices to place the ideal NANF system on the \u201cSE gain = 1\u201d contour line, where the\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1631\nNANF system shows no SE gain relative to the SMF system anymore. Also note in this context, that, in unamplified systems, any additional losses between transmitter and receiver, such as optical component insertion losses or nonideal photodetector responsivities, impact the SNR dB for dB, while amplified systems allow for the compensation of such lumped loss elements through dedicated lumped amplifiers with negligible impact on the SNR.\nConsequently, the practical systems\u2019 benefit of NANFs in terms of scaling system capacity is mainly its increased bandwidth expansion factor (if it can be realized as predicted), and whatever bandwidth expansion factor may be achievable has to compete against an equivalent number of parallel SMFs. An additional, capacity-unrelated benefit of HCFs in general (and NANFs in particular) is the 50% increased propagation speed of light due to signals traveling mostly in air instead of glass. This can be a benefit in latency-sensitive systems, for applications such as high-frequency trading, memory disaggregation, distributed computing, and mobile fronthaul and backhaul. To assess whether or not HCFs might be beneficial in such situations, one has to assess whether the propagation delay is a limiting factor relative to an application\u2019s other critical time constants, including latencies from signal processing and communication protocols. Furthermore, the estimated (gain flattened!) optimum total optical launch power for an unamplified UWB system based on NANFs would range from many 10 to more than 100 Watts depending on the transmission distance, which comes with huge challenges in handling these high levels of optical launch powers at MUXs, splitters, connectors, or splices at the transmitter.\nAside from the fiber type and the problems with optical amplification and power handling, developing system components, such as lasers, high-speed photodetectors, modulators, and filters that operate equally well over multiple optical frequency bands, is a huge challenge in practice. To\nillustrate this challenge in experimental practice, Fig. 11 shows the actually achieved SE in recently reported transmission experiments as a function of system bandwidth. To account for the impact of different transmission distances across experiments, the measured SEs are normalized to the estimated SE at the respective transmission distance as per (6), and SEs are reported as a percentage of those estimated for each point. Since the SE estimate is made for an SNRTRX of 25 dB [cf. the orange solid line in Fig. 2(c)], the measured SE above 100% [96] represents a shortreach small-bandwidth experiment that was conducted with a higher SNRTRX and, hence, is above the capacity limit estimate for SNRTRX = 25 dB. Although these measurements were taken under very different experimental conditions, such as different amplification schemes and different transmission distances, it can be clearly seen that wider system bandwidths make it much more difficult to stay close to the theoretical estimate. In other words, the capacity gain from operating a system across a wider bandwidth is partially lost in practice by a reduced SE due to difficulties in building wideband system components. This is a general truth throughout engineering applications: systems with a small relative bandwidth Brel (i.e., a small system bandwidth divided by the system\u2019s average carrier frequency fc, Brel = B/fc) are much easier to build than systems with a large relative bandwidth [3], [9]. The C-band has a relative bandwidth of 2.3%, a recent SOA-based system [122] has a relative bandwidth of 6.6%, and the hypothetical NANF of Fig. 9 has a nearly octavespanning relative bandwidth of 61%.\nThe need to develop different system component technologies for each band implies that \u201cmultiband\u201d parallelism is not the same type of parallelism that has so successfully been used for WDM or spectral superchannels [131], [132], where multiple carrier frequencies can be simultaneously passed through the same devices within\n1632 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nthe same wavelength band. The latter entails an immense benefit in terms of energy and cost reduction by means of integration. It is, thus, important to keep in mind that parallelism is most effective if the system components that are used in parallel are actually based on a common technology platform, i.e., use a reasonably small relative bandwidth. Using different technologies to accommodate multiple bands (e.g., through the use of widely different dopants in doped OAs) does not leverage parallelism most efficiently. As noted earlier, UWB transmission also interferes with distributed amplification as Raman pumps share spectrum with signals and raise concerns with regard to damage caused by a potential fiber fuse and eye safety for the system\u2019s maintenance personnel."

            "text": "The concept of exploiting spatial parallelism to increase data throughput is highly effective as it simply replicates\nthe same technology within the same optical operating band M times in parallel. Spatial parallelism is successfully deployed in many other areas, such as in microchips, where the same transistors are used billions of times, in computers using parallel data buses, in cellular wireless systems reusing frequencies in spatially disjoint cells from macrocells to femtocells, and in multifiber cables for shortreach optical interfaces. How many parallel spatial channels should be used as opposed to how much information should be packed onto a single high-capacity spatial path is a tradeoff between the cost of the transmission medium (including its cabling, deployment, and connectorization) and the cost of the transponders (including their PDM and WDM multiplexing mechanisms). For short transmission distances, where the transponder cost is much higher than the cost of the fiber link, it is generally cheaper to refrain from excessive multiplexing, while multiplexing is essential in long-haul transmission to amortize the cable cost across as many transponders as possible. Table 2 quantifies this tradeoff, showing the approximate cost of a spatial fiber path in terms of 100-Gb/s transponder\nTable 2 Cost per Fiber Path in Units of Transponder Cost/100G\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1633\nunits [47], [48]. At trans-Pacific distances, the cost per spatial path (including fiber, cable, and amplifiers) amounts to about 1200 times the unit transponder cost per 100 Gb/s. Hence, it is mandatory to multiplex a large number of WDM channels onto each fiber to balance transponder costs with cable costs. On the other hand, in highperformance compute (HPC) systems with transmission reaches of 100 m and less, the cost per fiber path can be \u223c10% (or less) of the cost of a 100-Gb/s transponder, which currently makes multiplexing of any form an unnecessary endeavor. It is much cheaper in such short-reach systems to deploy massively parallel fiber bundles than to multiplex many wavelengths onto a single fiber.\nAs today\u2019s long-haul optical communication systems are being operated close to their nonlinear Shannon limit estimates, with essentially all practical capacity-increasing methods exhausted, it is natural to migrate to spatially parallel systems. However, the important question is how this migration should take place to meet the growing demand for capacity most economically. Simply deploying M parallel systems leads to an M -fold capacity increase at M times the cost. This lets the cost per bit remain constant, which is not what society expects of digital communication services. SDM systems must, therefore, be built to share system components among spatial channels, as shown in Fig. 12, thereby reducing the cost and energy overhead that are dominant in each individual component [133]. Sharing becomes most effective by array integration across all system components, including transponders, fibers, splices and connectors, OAs, MUXs, filters, and switches. SDM research over the past decade has been mostly concentrated on novel fiber designs and demonstrating transmission records on those new media. Pursuing massive array integration of other system components is at least as important, though.\nIn addition to massive array integration, SDM offers other system-level benefits. For example, power-limited systems can significantly benefit from SDM even without any array integration, as has recently been shown [46], [47], [134] and has been implemented in the latest generation of submarine cables [14]. To illustrate this point, Fig. 13(a) shows the achievable aggregate SE (dubbed SESDM) of a power-limited system\nas a function of SNRL. SESDM is the total transmitted information per polarization and per unit bandwidth across all parallel spatial paths. The blue curve shows the maximum achievable SE of a single spatial path. For the following analysis, we assume that our reference system (SNRM=1) operates at a sufficiently high SNR but not above the nonlinear optimum10 [cf. Fig. 2(b)]. As shown in Fig. 13(a), when considering a system that consists of a single spatial path to which a total SNRL of 15 dB is available due to limited electrical system power supplying\n10To be more precise, we assume that the reference system operates in a regime where the 1/SNR1 term dominates all other 1/SNR terms, i.e., the ASE power dominates all other noise terms. If 1/SNR\u22122 (i.e., 1/SNRNLIN) cannot be neglected, i.e., if the reference system operates very close to or even slightly beyond the nonlinear optimum, SESDM will be slightly lower than described here. On the other hand, if the 1/SNR0 term is dominant, i.e., if the reference system is limited by 1/SNRTRX or 1/SNRXT, SESDM will be higher than described here. This could be the case for a NANF system, as discussed in conjunction with Fig. 5.\n1634 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nthe in-line OAs, we get an SE of log2(1 + 32) \u2248 5 bit/s/Hz per polarization. Splitting the available power among two parallel spatial paths yields SESDM = 2log2(1 + 16) \u2248 8 bit/s/Hz (equivalent to an aggregate SE gain of 1.6\u00d7, although the SE per spatial path drops by 19%). Using four parallel spatial paths yields SESDM = 4log2(1 + 8) \u2248 13 bit/s/Hz (equivalent to an aggregate SE gain of 2.5\u00d7 although the SE per spatial path drops by 37%). Increasing spatial parallelism at the cost of a smaller SNR (and, hence, a smaller SE) per spatial path brings about an overall capacity gain in a power-limited system since the prelog multiplier outside the logarithm is much more valuable than the associated SNR dilution. This concept has become particularly attractive for power-limited submarine cables, where system designers and operators realized that, by diluting the fixed amount of total power over a larger number of fiber pairs, the overall system cost per bit can be significantly reduced [46], [47], [134], [135]. This also prompts the question of what the limits in capacity gain due to parallelism and power dilution may be.\nUnder the assumption of a uniform lossless distribution of the signal power across all spatial paths, ideal Nyquist pulses, and no implementation penalty (i.e., \u03b7 = 1), SESDM as a function of spatial multiplicity M is shown in Fig. 13(b), with the Shannon-limited SNR as a parameter that reflects the total power available to the system [SNRM=1; cf. Fig 13(a)]. Since SNRM=1 is fixed, both the span length and total launch power are also assumed not to change with increasing M as these parameters affect SNRM=1. Two cases are shown:\nCase 1 (solid lines) assumes constant-gain amplifiers resulting in the same signal power at the amplifier output for all spans. This case is dubbed the \u201cno droop\u201d case with SESDM given by\nSESDM = M log2 1 + SNRM=1 M . (10)\nCase 2 (dashed lines) assumes constant-output-power amplifiers. While constant-gain and constant-power cases converge for high SNRs, they significantly differ for low SNRs as the amplifier output power consists of both signal and ASE power. This effect has become known as the \u201csignal droop\u201d effect [135], [136], [137] since the signal power decreases relative to the amplifier output power further down a long transmission line, and the accumulated ASE takes on an increasingly larger portion of the amplifier\u2019s total output power [138]. From the generalized droop model [137], SESDM follows as\nSESDM = M log2\n1 + 1\n1 + MSNRNS=1,M=1\nNS \u2212 1\n(11)\nwith NS being the number of amplifier spans and SNRNS=1,M=1 representing the SNR after the first span.\nIn case 1, SESDM saturates at the value SNRM=1log2(e) for M \u2192 \u221e, and for typical SNRM=1 values ranging from 10 to 20 dB, the SESDM obtained by ideally distributing the total power over many parallel paths ranges from about 14 to 144 bit/s/Hz, which corresponds to an SE gain of about 4\u00d7 to 21\u00d7 relative to the SE at M = 1.\nIn contrast, for case 2, which represents the way today\u2019s power-limited submarine systems are operated, a maximum SESDM is reached at a much lower spatial multiplicity. Note that the achievable SESDM in the signal droop case also depends on NS . For the hypothetical case of NS = 1, there is no signal droop, and the SEs are identical to case 1 (solid lines). The dashed curves represent the case NS = 100, which is virtually identical to all cases where NS > 100. In this case, the maximum achievable SESDM is given by11 SESDM = M \u2248 SNRM=1/log2(e), which corresponds to an optimum SE per spatial path of 1 bit/s/Hz per polarization and an optimum SNR per spatial path [represented by the compound fraction in (11)] of 0 dB, consistent with [139]. Consequently, the maximum achievable aggregate SE gain (relative to the SE at M = 1) is 2\u00d7, 4.3\u00d7, and 10.4\u00d7 for an SNRM=1 of 10, 15, and 20 dB, respectively.\nIt is important to note that, in the above analysis, the spatial multiplicity M does not necessarily equal the actual number of fibers or fiber pairs contained in a submarine cable but rather represents the number of parallel spatial paths that share a limited power supply that would result in SNRM=1 if it were used on a single spatial path. For example, a submarine cable that was designed to use eight fiber pairs operating near the nonlinear optimum at SNRM=1 = 12 dB per fiber [e.g., as represented by the cyan curve in Fig. 2(b)], reflecting a certain amount of available electrical supply power, could be upgraded to 88 fiber pairs (i.e.,M = 11) to boost the SESDM of the cable by a factor of 2.7 with the same amount of electrical supply power. In practical systems, the optimum SE and SNR per spatial path depend on the total link length and various other link parameters. Hence, optimization with regard to span length, power efficiency, and cost [47], [140], as well as operational overheads and some unavoidable loss due to power distribution among the spatial paths, may lead to a slightly higher optimum SE (and, consequently, also a higher optimum SNR) per spatial path, which, however, reduces SESDM. In this respect, we also remark that the main purpose of this analysis is to show that in a power-limited system signal droop leads to a finite M when attempting to maximize capacity solely by means of power dilution. Increasing capacity beyond that point will inevitably require adding more electrical power to the system.\nAn interesting side benefit of diluting power over multiple parallel systems is that each fiber is pushed to operate in the linear regime, which makes fiber nonlinearities\n11This value is approached for a sufficiently large number of spans (NS 1) and M 1. For M = 1, the optimum is found at SESDM = SNRM=1 = 1.\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1635\na nonissue for cost-optimized high-capacity submarine cables in the future. This is particularly interesting as these systems have traditionally been the most nonlinearityplagued fiber-optic communication systems.

            "text": "The most straightforward spatially parallel system architecture uses a high-density fiber bundle, i.e., a cable with multiple individual fiber strands that connect two network end points in parallel. To reduce the overall cable diameter and weight, with implications discussed in Section V-A5, a reduced cladding and coating diameter may be used for the fiber strands [143]. Cables with an outer cable diameter of 23-mm housing 3000 parallel optical fiber strands [147] and a diameter of 29-mm housing 6912 parallel optical fiber strands [148] with a coating diameter of 200 \u03bcm are already deployed.\nIn order to further reduce cable diameter and weight, dedicated SDM fibers have been intensively explored in research labs over the past decade. These can be broadly classified into fibers with uncoupled spatial paths and fibers with coupled spatial paths, as illustrated in Fig. 14. Whether a system is considered to have uncoupled spatial paths or coupled spatial paths depends on whether or not MIMO DSP across multiple parallel spatial paths is needed at the receiver to undo the crosstalk (XT) between spatial paths in the process of recovering the signals.12 If the XT between parallel spatial paths is below this systemspecific \u201cMIMO threshold,\u201d the exact amount of crosstalk is irrelevant as XT is absorbed as a noise term (PXT) into the achievable SNR, and systems operate within the allocated crosstalk penalty budget. If the crosstalk is above the MIMO threshold and MIMO DSP is used to separate the signals traveling on parallel spatial paths, the exact amount of XT is again irrelevant, as MIMO DSP can cope with arbitrary amounts of XT, i.e., a signal launched into any of the coupled-path SDM fiber\u2019s M parallel spatial paths at the transmitter may be equally distributed among all paths\n12Coherent systems on standard SMF always use a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO DSP to separate the two polarization components at the receiver, which are always fully coupled in realistic transmission scenarios.\nduring transmission. The definition of a \u201cMIMO threshold\u201d results in a clean (but transponder- and system-specific) separation of fibers into uncoupled and coupled variants.\n1) Uncoupled Spatial Parallelism (Core Multiplexing): The concept of having parallel spatial channels (i.e., cores) physically separated while embedding them in the same cladding structure has led to the design of MCFs. Individual cores can be nominally identical (homogenous MCFs) or deliberately different (heterogeneous MCFs) in terms of their size and refractive index [149]. The trench-assisted core profile [150], [151] uses a refractive index trench around each core to suppress intercore XT and has been popular owing to its effectiveness and low fabrication complexity, which is similar to that of bend-insensitive SMFs [152]. The heterogeneous core layout [153] can additionally suppress intercore XT but comes at an increased fabrication complexity.\nIn MCFs (sometimes also referred to as weakly coupled MCFs), intercore XT arises due to random perturbations in the refractive index caused by structural fluctuations, manufacturing imperfections, bends, or twists [154], [155], in addition to a small but nonnegligible overlap of the field from the interfering core, i.e., the core where the XT signal originates from, with the surrounding (interfered-upon) cores, i.e., the cores where the XT signal is coupled to. Recent studies have shown that intercore XT is influenced by the strength of intra-core random polarization mode coupling [156], [157]. We further note that although XT is a strictly stochastic quantity [158], [159] and its variance (i.e., the amount of random deviations from a mean value over time) can depend on the modulation format as well as the symbol rate of the transmitted signal [160], for modulation schemes and symbol rates typically used in conjunction with coherent detection, XT can be considered virtually stationary and thus is sufficiently described by its mean value. Intercore XT is a function of the propagation\n1636 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\ndistance L and is defined as XT(L) = P2(L)/P1(L), where P1 is the power in the core under consideration measured at distance L when no interferers are present, and P2 is the power that has accumulated due to XT from all interferers at distance L in the core under consideration when no power is coupled into the core under consideration at distance 0. The unit \u201cdB/km,\u201d commonly used to describe intercore XT, refers to the amount of XT accumulating in 1 km of fiber. For example, in the case of an MCF with a per-km XT of \u221260 dB/km, the accumulated XT after 1000 km of propagation amounts to \u221230 dB.\nAs the amount of intercore XT depends on how far the optical field reaches into the cladding, XT can be suppressed by operating the fiber closer to the theoretical cutoff wavelength of the next-higher order mode. Similar to SMFs, a typical MCF is designed with a cable cutoff wavelength of \u03bbcc < 1260 nm to guarantee single-mode operation including the O-band (cf. Fig. 9) [161]. Operating a single-mode core designed for \u03bbcc < 1260 nm at 1550 nm results in a mode with a broader cladding field (and consequently higher XT) than what would be obtained if the core were designed for, e.g., \u03bbcc < 1460 nm. To illustrate this effect, Fig. 15 shows the normalized propagation constant b and normalized mode field diameter (MFD) as a function of normalized frequency V for a standard SMF with a step-index profile. These fiber parameters are defined as [69], [162]\nb = n2eff \u2212 n22 n21 \u2212 n22 , V = 2\u03c0a \u03bb n1 \u221a 2\u0394, \u0394 = n21 \u2212 n22 2n21 , and\nMFD = 2 2 \u221e 0 \u03c82rdr \u221e\n0 d\u03c8 dr 2 rdr\nwhere 2a represents the core diameter, neff is the mode\u2019s effective refractive index (or modal index), which is the ratio of the mode\u2019s propagation constant (or wavenumber) to that of a plane wave in free space, \u0394 is the relative index difference between core (n1) and cladding (n2), and \u03c8 stands for the mode\u2019s field distribution. The red and green areas in Fig. 15 depict the frequency range of the C + L-band for the cases of \u03bbcc \u2248 1180 nm (obtained here with 2a = 8.5 \u03bcm and \u0394 = 0.35%) and \u03bbcc \u2248 1450 nm (obtained here with 2a = 8.5 \u03bcm and \u0394 = 0.5%), respectively. For an MCF designed with a cable cutoff of \u03bbcc \u2248 1180 nm, the fundamental (LP01) mode at 1550 nm has an MFD of \u223c1.2\u00d7 the core diameter, which induces XT onto nearby cores much more strongly compared to an MCF with a cable cutoff of \u03bbcc \u2248 1450 nm, where the MFD is only \u223c1.05\u00d7 the core diameter. While the latter case is preferred for intercore XT suppression, it also increases the probability of exciting the LP11 mode, which may lead to MPI problems for such designs.\nThe concept of the cable cutoff wavelength is used to obtain a realistic estimate of the attenuation of the first higher order mode (LP11 mode in the case of SMFs) in cabled fibers subject to perturbations such as bends and twists [163]. Note that, for a standard SMF, the cable cutoff wavelength is about 150 nm shorter than the theoretical mode cutoff wavelength. The latter is defined as the wavelength where b = 0 for the LP11 mode, i.e., where the modal index becomes equal to the refractive index of the cladding. Above this wavelength, the relevant waveguide mode turns into a cladding mode and, thus, loses its lightguiding property. How much the cable cutoff wavelength differs from the theoretical cutoff wavelength depends on the core profile. For example, if the core is surrounded by a deep index trench, it is common to find the theoretical cutoff wavelength much closer to (or even slightly below) the cable cutoff wavelength as the propagation loss in such more bend-resistant fibers is predominately governed by leakage loss in a straight fiber rather than by bend loss in a bent fiber [164]. Nevertheless, the cable cutoff wavelength remains the relevant parameter to quantify attenuation (i.e., suppression) of the first higher order mode.\nFig. 16 shows the MFD and the intercore XT as a function of wavelength across the C+L-band for the two cable cutoff wavelengths discussed above. We first note that intercore XT increases by \u223c10 dB across the C + L-band. In general, intercore XT increases with wavelength at a rate of \u223c0.1\u20130.15 dB per nm (depending on the core profile and layout) [165]. Signals with the longest wavelength in a WDM system, therefore, experience the largest XT. Hence, it is this XT value that needs to be considered when evaluating the maximum impact of XT on a system\u2019s transmission quality (see Figs. 17 and 18). As expected from Fig. 15, a significant reduction in XT (in this example, from \u223c\u221230 to \u223c\u221265 dB/km) can be obtained if the cable cutoff wavelength is moved closer to the lower edge of the C-band [166], provided that the operation at shorter wavelength bands than the C-band is not required. XT is\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1637\nalso inversely proportional to the core pitch \u039b (see Fig. 14). In terms of XT suppression, it is, therefore, desirable to place the cores as far apart as possible, which stands against the desire to pack as many cores as possible into a given MCF cladding diameter. Furthermore, cores placed too close to the cladding boundary exhibit excess loss due to the optical field leaking into the lossy coating. An outer cladding thickness (i.e., the distance from the outermost core\u2019s center to the cladding-coating boundary) of \u223c35 \u03bcm is typically needed for single-mode MCFs with a trench-assisted core profile to keep the excess loss below 0.01 dB/km at \u03bb = 1.625 \u03bcm [166], [167]. Like intercore XT, this value depends on the core profile and bend condition of the fiber. For MCFs that deliberately support multiple propagation modes per core in their few-moded cores, the outer cladding thickness and the core pitch have to be increased with an increasing number of modes propagating in the cores of an FM-MCF, as higher order mode fields tend to spread farther into the cladding [149], [155]. A minimum required core pitch and outer cladding thickness limit the number of cores that can be accommodated within a given cladding diameter [60]. Increasing the cladding diameter is problematic because the cladding size critically affects the fiber\u2019s mechanical reliability [168]. Typical SMFs have a cladding diameter of 125 \u03bcm, and a cladding diameter of 230\u2013250 \u03bcm is believed to be the practical upper limit for silica fibers to be reliably used in optical networks. While MCFs with a cladding diameter of 242 \u03bcm [169] enclosing as many as 32 uncoupled cores have been demonstrated in conjunction with high-capacity transmission record experiments [170], keeping the typical SMF cladding diameter of 125 \u03bcm is currently preferable in terms of mass production, as well as cabling and connectorization. This currently limits the maximum number of cores to 4 [60] for operation in the C + L-band if XT\nand its impact on SE are to be kept sufficiently low across a wide range of transmission distances (see Figs. 17 and 18). One way to increase the core density at a fixed MCF cladding diameter is to only allow for opposite propagation directions in adjacent cores [171]. Since XT only occurs between copropagating signals, directionally interleaved propagation results in an effective increase of the XTgenerating core-to-core spacings at the highest possible core density. The resulting MCFs in a deployed scenario then have a \u201cpolarity\u201d though, with clearly defined \u201cinput ports\u201d and \u201coutput ports.\u201d\nMathematically, the noise contribution due to linear crosstalk is captured in (9) through PXT = \u03bePch = (\u03be1 + \u03a5(\u03be2L))Pch with \u03be1 describing length-independent XT, such as the XT from neighboring WDM channels, and \u03be2 representing length-dependent XT, such as intercore XT in MCFs. In a well-engineered transmission system, \u03be1 is negligibly small. The function \u03a5 depends on the core layout and ensures that the noise contribution due to XT cannot become stronger than the signal from which the XT originates (i.e., saturates for large L). It is beyond the scope of this article to describe the function \u03a5 and its effect on SE for all kinds of core layouts and crosstalk strengths. Suffice it to say that, if XT is sufficiently small, i.e., \u03be2L 1, the approximation \u03a5(\u03be2L) \u2248 \u03be2L holds, and XT scales linearly with fiber length L [172], [173], i.e., increases by 3 dB for every doubling in the transmission distance. This motivates the specification of XT in terms of \u201cdB/km\u201d and also represents the regime where it is generally not necessary to resort to MIMO DSP to compensate for intercore XT.\nFig. 17 shows the impact of intercore XT on the SE as a function of transmission distance for an aggregate XT\n1638 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nranging from \u221260 to \u221230 dB/km. The calculations assume distributed amplification, no implementation penalty, and a homogenous WDM system across the C + L-band operating over a standard SMF. Parameter assumptions are the same as those for Fig. 2. The aggregate XT is the sum of the XT arising from all parallel spatial channels contributing to XT within the core of interest. The curves are plotted up to the point where the noise contribution due to aggregate XT stays below \u221210 dB, and thus, the approximation \u03a5 \u2248 \u03be2L holds. In this regime, signal loss due to XT and interactions between XT and fiber nonlinearities are negligibly small and are, therefore, not modeled. Importantly, though, it can be shown that the optimal signal launch power is mainly a tradeoff between ASE and NLIN, and is independent of XT [cf. (A12)]. Furthermore, note that, at a fixed transmission distance, the effect of XT on the SE is identical to that of SNRTRX, as they both make up the signal-independent SNR contribution SNR0 [cf. (9b)]. This is depicted in Fig. 17 by the cyan star marker where the individual contributions of an XT of \u221250 dB/km and a transponder noise floor at \u221230 dB (1/SNRTRX) result in the same SE at L= 100 km. The combined effect is depicted by the green solid curve. At distances L > 100 km where the accumulated XT becomes gradually larger than 1/SNRTRX, the transponder noise becomes irrelevant. Conversely, at distances L < 100 km where XT is smaller than 1/SNRTRX, the effect of a transponder noise floor is noticeable. The presence of a transponder noise floor, therefore, makes short-reach systems up to about 100 km more resistant to XT, as SNRXT SNRTRX for such systems. On the other hand, for transmission distances where the system is not strongly influenced by SNRTRX, the SE reduction (in bit/s/Hz) due to XT depends only on \u03be2 and is nearly independent of the transmission distance, reflected by XT curves being parallel to the XT-free curve at long transmission distances in Fig. 17 [174], [175].\nFig. 18(a) shows the percentage SE penalty due to XT as a function of transmission distance, with the lengthdependent XT factor \u03be2 as a parameter. The SE penalty due to a certain XT (e.g., \u221240 dB/km) at a certain distance (e.g., 300 km) is given by s2/(s1 + s2) (with s1 and s2 as defined in Fig. 17 for an SNRTRX of 30 dB). For an SE penalty of less than 5% up to 10 000 km, an aggregate XT of about \u221260 dB/km must be maintained. Consequently, the optimum number of cores of an MCF (for any fixed cladding diameter up to \u223c250 \u03bcm) is nearly independent of the transmission distance (i.e., independent of the system application), which opens the door to manufacturing universal MCFs for deployment in various system contexts [174]. Looking at the same situation from a MIMO perspective, Fig. 18(b) addresses the question of how much capacity one could gain back if one were to implement MIMO at the receiver to undo the XT by showing the MIMO gain. The MIMO gain is defined by (s1 + s2)/s1. A MIMO gain of 3 dB implies that MIMO processing of parallel XT-inducing propagating paths doubles system capacity at the expense of significant DSP and\nhardware complexity. Note that, due to the dependence of XT on the wavelength (cf. Fig. 16), the SE reduction and MIMO gains due to XT pertain to the longest-wavelength WDM channels and the overall WDM system capacity loss due to XT will, in general, be smaller than the SE loss at the longest operating wavelength. Refined system designs may use this fact to transmit more information in the shorter wavelength portion of the spectrum than in the longer wavelength portion (e.g., by using different PCS factors across the band).\n2) Coupled Spatial Parallelism (Mode Multiplexing): Once XT between spatial paths (whether between adjacent cores in an MCF or between different propagation modes in a single core) becomes too high to be tolerated in terms of an SE loss or, for fixed system settings (including modulation and FEC), becomes too high to allow for error-free operation at the allocated XT margin, the system exceeds its \u201cMIMO threshold.\u201d In this case, MIMO DSP is needed to recover the individual signals at the receiver, and we speak of a coupled-mode or coupled-core transmission\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1639\nsystem. Note that, in an unperturbed waveguide (i.e., a waveguide that does not change its properties in the longitudinal direction), true waveguide modes are by definition orthogonal and propagate independently and without any coupling. LP fiber \u201cmodes\u201d are not true waveguide modes but represent a linear combination of true fiber modes, resulting in deterministic coupling at a given beat length between them, e.g., between the LP11a,x and LP11b,y modes [176]. This beating phenomenon is also known under the term \u201cmodal birefringence\u201d [177]. The same is true when launching a linear combination of supermodes into an array of parallel waveguides by exciting only a single waveguide of that array, as it is done when sending light through, e.g., a directional coupler or an ideal (i.e., straight and unperturbed) CCF. The coupling process of deterministic mode coupling does not vary along the transmission path.\nMore important for coupled-mode fiber transmission systems, however, is random mode coupling along the transmission path due to random field perturbations induced by fiber imperfections, by temperature variations and external perturbations, such as fiber twists and bending affecting the deterministic mode beating, by splices and connectors with random offsets, and by nonideal spatial multiplexers/demulitplexers (MUXs/DEMUXs) (see Sections V-B and V-C). Random mode coupling, which is always present in some form in a realistic transmission scenario using polarization and/or spatial modes, is also the main reason why a coupled-mode transmission system beyond the MIMO threshold needs to resort to MIMO DSP.\nIn an FMF [145], a special kind of MMF, spatial channels are typically represented by spatial (pseudo)modes, such as the LP modes [69]. An MMF can easily support more than a hundred spatial modes without the need to increase the cladding diameter. An FMF for MIMO-assisted SDM transmission is designed to support typically a small amount of low-order spatial modes to keep the MIMO complexity at the receiver low. A CCF is typically made from a few (e.g., 4 or 7; see Fig. 20) homogeneous single-mode cores that are located just at the right distance to each other to enable strong random coupling [144]. Such a fiber supports as many spatial supermodes as it has cores. Due to the strong random field coupling between the spatially separated cores, uniform CCFs exhibit more uniform mode coupling characteristics compared to FMFs. Irrespective of the coupled-mode fiber type, strong random coupling between modes is preferable to suppress transmission impairments, such as differential mode delay (DMD) and mode-dependent loss (MDL) [178], [179], both of which affect the performance of the MIMO DSP in terms of system outage probabilities [180]. Note, in this context, that purely unitary (i.e., lossless) mode coupling does not affect MIMO system capacity. For systems in which the transmitter does not use channel state information (CSI), which is the typical assumption in optical MIMO-SDM systems, nonunitary mode coupling (i.e., MDL) due to components closer to the transmitter (i.e., before channel\nnoise loading) has a stronger impact on MIMO capacity than MDL of components closer to the receiver [180]. In systems using CSI at the transmitter, MDL occurring prior to random channel perturbations (e.g., in the mode MUX) could be perfectly precompensated at the transmitter and would have no impact on the system capacity.\nDMD (also referred to as differential group delay (DGD), group delay spread, or modal dispersion) is caused by the differences in group delay between the spatial modes. Modal dispersion lets a single impulse launched into an FMF spread over a time window whose width is proportional to the DMD. To compensate for this spread, MIMO DSP requires enough filter taps (i.e., a sufficiently long memory or filter length) to accommodate the DMD [181]. For strong random coupling (as is found, e.g., in optimized CCFs), the impulse response takes on a Gaussian shape, and DMD (proportional to the width of this Gaussian distribution) scales moderately, with the square root of transmission distance [182]. This scaling is also reflected in the unit ps/km0.5 typically used to describe modal dispersion of strongly coupled spatial modes, in analogy to its traditional use in describing the DGD due to PMD in SMFs. It was shown both theoretically [183], [184] and experimentally [185] that strong coupling among spatial modes also reduces nonlinear impairments and, thus, enhances transmission performance.\nMDL is a measure of the power variations between modes due to individual modal loss or gain. MDL accumulates during propagation and, when specified as the ratio of the strongest to the weakest mode, can range from 1 (0 dB) for no power variations between modes to infinity if the power of one mode drops to zero, i.e., a mode is completely filtered out. MDL extends the definition of polarizationdependent loss (PDL) to coupled-mode systems. MDL is caused by nonideal optical network elements, such as OAs or MUXs, as well as by perturbations along the fiber such as bends and imperfect splices. MDL affects the quality of the MIMO channel and, in conjunction with amplifier noise, sets a fundamental limit to the performance of a mode multiplexed transmission system. The specification of MDL as the ratio of strongest to weakest modal powers (peak-to-peak MDL) lends itself best to lumped system components, such as mode MUXs, optical filters, and amplifiers. In distributed systems, the combination of random mode coupling and MDL leads to a statistical modal loss distribution that requires knowledge of statistical MDL parameters, such as the root-mean-square value (rms MDL) [186], and, ideally, the probability distribution of MDL [180] for conclusive statements on the impact of MDL on system capacity and outage. Also, note that the modes determining MDL, in general, do not correspond to the modes that are launched into the fiber (e.g., LP modes) but are found as the eigenmodes of the end-to-end MIMO channel, including all its random and deterministic perturbations.\nWhile CCFs are usually designed to form only a single group of strongly coupled modes (with their effective\n1640 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nrefractive indices or propagation constants very close to each other), FMFs and MMFs typically form multiple groups of strongly coupled modes, with relatively weak random coupling between mode groups (MGs) [187]. This results in a less favorable linear growth of DMD with distance, which increases the MIMO DSP complexity if the crosstalk between MGs needs to be removed as well. This linear growth is reflected in the unit ps/km, which is typically used to describe the modal dispersion of weakly coupled modes. The formation of MGs in FMFs can suppress coupling between MGs to a negligible level over modest distances such that MIMO only needs to be performed within MGs but not across MGs, i.e., MIMO is only used to compensate for intra-MG coupling but not for inter-MG coupling [188], [189]. Successful transmission of up to 1800 km of two MGs was recently demonstrated in conjunction with coherent detection and MIMO processing only within each MG [190]. Optimizing the separation of the effective refractive indices of the various MGs allows for fiber designs suitable for such systems. If all modes within an MG carry the same information, each MG acts as an individually isolated spatial channel, and MIMO DSP can be avoided altogether, which is referred to as MG multiplexing. MG multiplexing without MIMO processing at the receiver in combination with OOK and direct detection has been demonstrated for various transmission scenarios [191], [192], [193], [194] and transmission distances up to \u223c150 km [195].\n3) Combinations of Coupled and Uncoupled Spatial Parallelisms: Combinations of coupled and uncoupled SDM fiber types to achieve both core multiplexing and mode multiplexing have also been demonstrated. In few-mode MCFs (FM-MCFs), each core of an uncoupled-core MCF supports multiple coupled spatial modes. The number of spatial channels provided by the MCF can, thus, be more easily multiplied by tolerating a modest increase in MIMO complexity per core. Each core effectively forms a local MG that is independently maintained over long distances and does not couple much with other (spatially separated) MGs (i.e., cores). The MIMO threshold between nominally uncoupled groups of coupled spatial channels, e.g., the cores in an FM-MCF, was found to be the same as the MIMO threshold between individual single-mode channels, e.g., the cores in a single-mode MCF [196]. However, the fact that higher order mode fields spread further into the cladding [149], [155] requires a larger core pitch for such fibers, a larger outer cladding thickness, and, often, also a heterogeneous trench-assisted core profile in the fiber design to suppress intercore XT, which results in cladding diameters much larger than 125 \u03bcm of SMFs, FMFs, or MMFs. Nevertheless, FM-MCFs have so far achieved the highest spatial channel count in a single strand of fiber. Fibers supporting up to 120 spatial channels (12 cores \u00d7 ten spatial modes per core, with a cladding diameter of 217 \u03bcm [197]) have been reported for fabricated fibers and up to 114 spatial channels (19 cores \u00d7 six spatial\nmodes with a cladding diameter of 267 \u03bcm [11] and 38 cores \u00d7 three spatial modes with a cladding diameter of 312 \u03bcm [12]) have been used in conjunction with high capacity transmission experiments achieving transmission capacities of \u223c10 Pb/s (see Fig. 19). Note that, in accordance with (2), polarization is treated separately from spatial modes and is, therefore, not included in the above count of \u201cspatial channels.\u201d\n4) Transmission Experiments Using SDM Fibers: Figs. 19 and 20 summarize the evolution of record single-span experiments together with a few representative multispan experiments that have used SDM-specific fiber types. FM-MCFs with 114 spatial channels have demonstrated the so-far highest data throughput of more than 10 Pb/s in a single strand of fiber [11], [12]. CCFs with up to seven spatial channels (seven coupled single-mode cores) have demonstrated SDM transmission over trans-Pacific distances over more than 9000 km, outperforming SMFs in terms of their nonlinear transmission characteristics [185]. As shown in Fig. 19, all MCFs used in experiments with transmission rates above 2 Pb/s have employed larger cladding diameters than 250 \u03bcm. In view of this constraint and the experimental results presented so far at top conferences, we conclude that it will be difficult to boost the number of spatial channels incorporated in a single strand of silica MCF much beyond a factor of a few tens compared to SMF in practical long-distance transmission scenarios. On the other hand, all fibers underlying the results summarized in Fig. 20 have a cladding diameter of 125 \u03bcm, with the tolerable MIMO DSP complexity at the transponder dictating the maximum number of spatial channels.\nApart from these impressive transmission results in the laboratory, a practically important and highly relevant question when assessing the scalability of MCFs, FM-MCFs, FMFs and CCFs concerns the related savings on a systems\u2019 level (including fiber fabrication). So far, bundles of SMFs are still more cost-effective compared to SDM-specific\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1641\nfiber types and avoid higher order MIMO-DSP altogether. Furthermore, given the wide range of possible cladding diameters and the plethora of conceivable core layouts and mode multiplicities, it is clear that standardization efforts [60] are crucial for the further development of SDM components and their adoption in commercial systems.\n5) Cabling: The number of optical fibers that can be packed into an optical cable depends mainly on the allowable cable diameter and weight. Submarine cables are strongly limited in their allowable diameter to ensure the highest level of reliability under deep sea conditions. In terrestrial long-haul, regional, and metro systems, limited available duct space and difficulties in pulling long cables through existing ducts are of consideration, as is the ability to transport heavy cable drums to locations accessible by construction crews for deployment. The shorter practically deployable individual cable segments have to be, the more splice points are needed, which adversely affects loss and deployment costs. While DCI systems often use newly deployed ducts, it is preferable in most other terrestrial network segments to utilize existing ducts as efficiently as possible, as the deployment of new duct infrastructure outside a datacenter campus environment can be prohibitively expensive. Fig. 21 depicts an example of how the fiber count can be upgraded in an existing duct. Fig. 21(a) shows a duct (e.g., 60 mm in diameter) housing a single high-density optical cable (A1) that can accommodate more than 100 optical fibers with a cable diameter of \u223c10 mm, as is typically used today. Such high-density optical cables are made from partially bonded optical fiber ribbons that, similar to traditional edge-bonded or encapsulated fiber ribbons, have the benefit of enabling very dense packing in the cable while allowing for simultaneous fusion splicing of multiple optical fibers using a ribbon splicer. In one upgrade scenario [see Fig. 21(b)], the duct is gradually filled with additional high-density optical cables\nof the same type (A2, A3, and A4). In another upgrade scenario [see Fig. 21(c)], the remaining duct space is filled with a single ultrahigh-density optical cable with a larger cable diameter (A2\u2019). Such ultrahigh fiber count cables can be fabricated by leveraging the technology used for high-density cable and optical fibers with a thinner coating diameter.\nAlthough cables with a larger diameter provide more instantaneous capacity, their use increases the installation workload, i.e., a thicker and heavier cable restricts the installation length, which also increases the overall number of splice points. Moreover, the installation of an ultrahigh-density cable makes it more difficult to add further cables at a later point in time. Manufacturing of these cables also entails a longer total fiber length (TFL) per cable, where TFL refers to the product of the cable length times the number of fibers in the cable. With requirements toward carbon neutrality of optical networks getting more stringent in the coming years, the CO2 emission generated during the life cycle of a fiber cable cannot be neglected anymore, with fiber drawing being the dominant factor, as recent studies have revealed [223]. The TFL per cable will, therefore, have a significant impact on choosing cable types. Against this backdrop, a sensible choice could be to first use multiple high-density cables [A1\u2013A4 in Fig. 21(b)] whose installation workload and TFL per cable remain the same. Using cables with smaller diameters also facilitates the adjustment of the remaining duct space relative to the cable space. Eventually, however, this upgrade scenario will result in the need for another duct once the original duct is filled up with the maximum number of cables. Before this point is reached, the smaller diameter optical cables have the benefit of facilitating a gradual replacement of the cables containing conventional SMFs [A1\u2013A4 in Fig. 21(b)] with cables containing SDM fibers, e.g., a replacement with B\u2013D in Fig. 21(d) may accommodate SDM fiber cables with an increasingly higher spatial multiplicity compared to their SMF counterparts A1\u2013A4. SDM technology may, thus, enable a gradual increase in capacity while keeping the installation workload and TFL per cable constant. Assuming that four cables are the maximum number of cables that the duct of Fig. 21 can\n1642 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nsupport while still allowing for cable replacements, duct sustainability could be more easily achieved. This would be done by first adding cable B, next moving services from cable A1 to B, and, finally, taking out cable A1. The same process would be repeated until the duct is filled up with SDM cables of maximum spatial multiplicity. Switching from the SMF cable to an SDM cable with higher spatial multiplicity may also mitigate the risk of link loss during cable replacement as the newly added SDM cable with higher spatial multiplicity provides a higher capacity than the replaced cable right away.\nAlthough the above considerations indicate that physical limitations and sustainability of ducts and cables serve as key motivations to use MCFs in long-haul networks, we note that there is currently no commercial technology available that allows for simultaneous fusion splicing of MCF arrays or ribbons in a field-deployable setting. This is one of the remaining technical challenges that need to be resolved to realize commercially viable MCF-based networks."

            "heading": "B. Splices and Connectors",
            "text": "Splices and connectors are essential elements of optical transmission systems and networks. As most cores of an MCF are not located in the fiber center, the alignment of MCFs upon splicing or connectorization requires precise control of the core position in both radial and angular directions with respect to the fiber center. Both lead to a lateral offset between coupling core pairs at splices and connectors. The open markers in Fig. 22 show the coupling loss (CL) of a single-mode core as a function of a lateral core-to-core offset and apply to both SMFs and MCFs with single-mode cores. For MCFs, the lateral coreto-core offset can be due to a lateral offset between the two MCFs but can also be due to an angular misalignment of the two MCFs, which results in a lateral offset between MCF cores that increases with the distance of the core from the fiber center, making the cores closer to the cladding-coating boundary more prone to CLs. This is especially critical for high-core-count MCFs with large cladding diameters. For example, an angular misalignment of 1\u25e6 causes a lateral offset of \u223c0.87 \u03bcm at a distance of 50 \u03bcm from the fiber center and a lateral offset of \u223c1.75 \u03bcm at a distance of 100 \u03bcm from the fiber center. As a point of reference, typical angular alignment tolerances for polarization-maintaining SMFs today are \u00b13\u25e6 (for standard grade) and \u00b11.5\u25e6 (for high grade). Similar to polarization-maintaining fibers, to mitigate issues associated with angular misalignment of MCFs, fusion splicers equipped with both end- and side-view functions can be used to inspect the core arrangement on the fiber facet while rotating the fiber before splicing [224], [225], [226]. Also, new types of MU-, SC-, and LC-type MCF fiber connectors have been developed, which avoids unintentional rotation of the fiber upon connection [227], [228]. The latest reported LC-type MCF connectors have demonstrated less than 0.07-dB insertion loss on average for a 125-\u03bcm-cladding 8-core fiber with a fiber-center-tocore-center distance of 40.5 \u03bcm and are ready for mass production [229]. Multi-MCF connectors have also been demonstrated with up to 256 cores (32 \u00d7 8-core MCFs) [230]. In addition, due to the 2-D core layout, there are also some network applications where MCF cables need to distinguish between \u201cinput ports\u201d and \u201coutput ports\u201d (\u201cMCF polarity\u201d) to guarantee the connection of cores with the same core ID [231]. An example is the directionally interleaved cores discussed in Section V-A1.\nFMFs, on the other hand, employ only a single core in the fiber center. Angular misalignment is, therefore, irrelevant for cores with a circularly symmetric refractive index profile. However, the tolerances to the lateral misalignment are more severe for higher order modes, as illustrated in Fig. 22, with respect to an FMF designed to support 5 MGs (i.e., 30 spatial and polarization modes) at a wavelength of 1.55 \u03bcm with a graded-index profile (\u0394 = 1%) and a core diameter of 28 \u03bcm [232]. Fig. 22(a) shows the MG CL, i.e., the power loss of an MG when coupled\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1643\nto the same MG after the splice. The curves represent the average loss within the group, while the vertical bars (only visible in the higher order MGs) indicate the loss variations within each MG. MG 1 containing the two fundamental (polarization) modes of LP01 exhibits a slightly better offset tolerance than that of the standard SMF (core diameter of 8.5 \u03bcm and a step-index profile with \u0394 = 0.35%). Note, though, that the coupling of any particular mode to the same mode includes both true power loss and power coupling to other modes. In a MIMO-system context, coupling to other propagating modes is irrelevant, which makes the power loss at the splice point the much more relevant quantity as it directly leads to an increase in MDL [233], [234]. Fig. 22(b), therefore, shows the CL of various fiber modes to nonpropagating cladding modes after a lateral offset splice. In the case of an SMF, the MG CL is equivalent to the loss due to coupling to the cladding modes. Being closest to the cladding index in terms of modal indices, the highest-order MG naturally is affected most strongly, and this MG (i.e., MG 5 in our example) will also experience the strongest degradations in transmission quality, unless MGs strongly couple to each other. If they strongly couple, MG coupling in the fiber following the offset splice randomizes the effect. On the other hand, the low-order MGs are more robust against lateral offsets as they mainly exchange power among themselves, which could be compensated for by MIMO DSP across MGs.\nWe note that all these calculations are based on the fiber\u2019s circular-symmetric true mode field profiles to avoid numerical artifacts that may lead to a misleading dependence of the results on noncircular symmetric LP mode profiles (of modes within the same MG, e.g., LP11a and LP11b). LP modes are often used to describe mode propagation in optical fibers in a simplified approximation, but their individual effects average out over longer transmission distances due to strong mode coupling of degenerate or nearly degenerate modes within the same MG."

In the case of a MUX for a single-mode MCF or CCF, the coupling mechanism is straightforward and maps an array of single-mode input beams (e.g., originating from an SMF bundle) to an array of single-mode output beams whose spatial distribution is matched to the core layout of the MCF or CCF. This has been achieved with free-space optics [235], [236], 3-D waveguides [237], [238], and reduced-cladding or pitchreduced fiber bundles [239], [240], including pluggable types [241]. The MUXs and DEMUXs for an MCF or CCF are also often referred to as fan-in\u2013fan-out (FIFO) devices. FIFOs for MCFs are not XT free, but the level of XT is usually small (typically below \u221250 dB on average) compared to the intercore XT accumulating along the fiber upon transmission.\nIn the case of an FMF, a MUX couples spatially separated single-mode input beams onto the modes of the FMF. This coupling does not need to happen to any particular mode basis, as long as the orthogonality of the spatial channels is sufficiently preserved, i.e., as long as the MUX implements a (nearly) unitary transformation between its input fundamental modes of SMFs and its output guided FMF modes. Numerous devices have been developed over recent years that can achieve this transformation. Among these are phase masks [242], [243], directional couplers implemented either in form of 3-D waveguides [244] or planar waveguides [245], photonic lanterns that can be directly fused to both the SMF array and FMF [246], and multiplane light converters [247] that were even demonstrated to work in conjunction with >1000 modes [248]. Modal XT due to an FMF MUX is somewhat higher (typically below \u221225 dB on average) than the typical XT of FIFOs but again negligible compared to the modal XT accumulating along the fiber. However, care must be taken that the MUX\u2019s nonideal (i.e., nonunitary) coupling behavior does not significantly contribute to the overall system MDL."

Wall-plug efficiencies (or energy conversion efficiencies) of amplifier line cards used in today\u2019s networks range from slightly less than 1% to a few percent [48], which is much below the fundamental OA efficiency limit. The pump-to-signal photon conversion efficiency is \u223c60% assuming a 980-nm pump and a 1550-nm signal, and typical pump lasers have efficiencies of up to \u223c50%. This indicates that there is still ample headroom for improvement in the efficiency of amplifying optical signals. The development toward a fully integrated SDM amplifier is likely to happen in several phases, as illustrated in Fig. 23. In the first phase, each spatial channel has its own EDF and pump laser unit, but common housekeeping functions, such as laser diode (LD) control, monitoring, and thermoelectric cooling, are shared among all units. In the second phase, the output of a single or a few highpower LDs is distributed among multiple spatial channels\n1644 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nto pump their individual EDFs. This is done both for energy efficiency reasons and to provide redundancy in the case of LD failure. The latest submarine cable systems employing pumping schemes known under the term \u201cpump farming\u201d [249] are already pertinent to this phase of SDM amplifier development. Individual EDFs, isolators and WDM couplers for pump combining, however, are still used for each spatial channel. This phase may also comprise methods that efficiently reuse the unabsorbed pump light after passing through the EDF [250]. Finally, in the third phase, the input and output fibers, as well as the entire EDFA, are built from SDM components, such as MCFs or FMFs and multicore or few-mode isolators [251] with one or a few high-power LDs pumping the cores of the MCF or modes in the FMF. In this respect, two pumping concepts have been devised in recent years: EDF cores are pumped either directly, or they can be pumped indirectly via the cladding [252].\nSo far, SDM-OAs have not yet achieved efficiencies exceeding those of conventional single-mode EDFAs. Core pumping of MCFs requires either fan-out devices to couple the pump light to each core individually [253] or uses WDM couplers built with free-space optics [254]. Cladding pumping can make use of side-pumping schemes and highpower multimode LDs, and has been demonstrated for both MC- and FM-EDFAs [255]. FM-EDFAs can be a significant source of MDL (due to gain variations among the modes), and various amplifier designs have been devised with the goal to minimize MDL [256], [257], [258]. As it will be difficult to completely eliminate MDL in amplifiers solely by optimizing the refractive index profile of the active fiber, the use of gain flattening filters in the spatial domain at the amplifier output, analogous to the way they are being used to compensate for gain variations in the spectral domain in conjunction with single-mode EDFAs, has been investigated to deal with residual MDL [259]."

            "text": "Optical network nodes are used to aggregate, disaggregate, and switch optical signals between their various inputs and outputs, transparently on a wavelength granularity, thereby enabling the ability to perform optical mesh networking. Today\u2019s network nodes are implemented as colorless, directionless, and contentionless ROADMs, enabling optical signal routing of any wavelength, in any nodal direction, and without blocking other wavelength channels, provided that the respective wavelength slot is still available at the targeted output port.\nIn future networks, ROADMs will have to increasingly complement wavelength switching with spatial switching to accommodate high degrees of spatial parallelism [260], [261]. In addition, as the bit rate of logical router interfaces in the core network approaches the capacity of a full WDM system, wavelength switching will be phased out in favor of space switching only [48]. This will not only substantially simplify the network architecture\nitself but will also make wavelength routing algorithms and amplifier transient control systems no longer needed. Transient control is needed today to avoid the transient impact of OAs due to the sudden wavelength add/drop actions onto other channels in a WDM system. Wavelength routing algorithms are needed because transparent optical network nodes currently cannot perform wavelength conversion [262]. A routing request needs to occupy the same wavelength range from source to destination, which can lead to stranded bandwidth and defragmentation issues in WDM networks.\nIt is important to note that spatial switching and spectral switching are fundamentally different in terms of their ability to perform contention resolution, as wavelength conversion is a nonlinear operation and, hence, not easily done all-optically, while spatial path conversion is a linear operation that is easily implemented. To illustrate this point and the associated networking implications, Fig. 24 shows two optical switching scenarios for a node with four directions and M parallel spatial paths connected to each direction, each spatial path carrying a WDM system [3]. In the upper scenario [see Fig. 24(a)], logical ports are implemented as spectral superchannels, i.e., a logical data stream consists of multiple wavelength signals on a single spatial path. In the lower scenario [see Fig. 24(b)], spatial superchannels are being used, i.e., a logical data stream consists of same-wavelength signals on multiple spatial paths. Hybrid cases are also possible. To illustrate network operational differences between spectral and spatial superchannels, assume that a superchannel occupying N contiguous spatial or wavelength slots is to be routed from west to east in the nodes of Fig. 24. Further assume that the system loading at the output port (East) is given by 0 < \u03b3 < 1, i.e., the probability that a superchannel occupying N contiguous spatial or wavelengths slots is already occupied\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1645\nat the output is \u03b3. In the case of a spectral superchannel, routing is impossible if all M spatial paths already carry a spectral superchannel in the needed wavelength range, which leads to a blocking probability of \u03b3M . In contrast, routing for the spatial superchannel is impossible if there are not enough wavelength slots available at the output port to fit a spatial superchannel of N spatial slots, leading to a blocking probability of \u03b3M/N > \u03b3M . This example shows the asymmetry in space and wavelength when it comes to switching applications, which is fundamentally rooted in the fact that spatial switching is a linear process, while wavelength switching is inherently nonlinear and therefore cannot be easily implemented [3]. Note, though, that the choice between spatial and spectral superchannels is not always optional. For example, if MIMO-SDM is being used, all coupled modes belonging to a single transmitter\u2013 receiver pair must stay together upon transitioning through an optical network node. Despite research reports being published now and then stating otherwise, the constituents of a coupled-path spatial superchannel cannot be independently routed without destroying the integrity of the signal. This is analogous to polarization multiplexing in an SMF system: a network node in an SDM system must never route the two polarizations of a single wavelength channel to different output ports.\nWhether spatial or spectral superchannels are the better option depends on the network scenario: the use of MIMO forces spatial superchannels, and spatial superchannels also have benefits in terms of transceiver hardware simplicity and power consumption. On the other hand, optically routed mesh networks favor spectral superchannels as a logical entity in terms of blocking probability and in terms of switch node architectures, especially once the logical port capacity of an IP router becomes comparable to the capacity of an entire fiber [48]. For a detailed discussion on the node architecture and networking of SDM networks, the interested reader may refer to [263] in this Special Issue."

            "text": "In the context of transponder hardware, SDM integration asks for massive array integration in order to make the transponders addressing M spatial paths more cost-efficient than M individual transponders. While this general desire also applies to the integration of spectral superchannel transponders (i.e., transponders addressing N wavelengths), spatial instead of wavelength integration offers distinct advantages, including the use of a single laser source, no need for spectrally gain-flattened optical amplification within a transponder, and no need for skew compensation of different-wavelength signals sent in parallel. In a spectral superchannel, CD causes significant temporal walk-off between wavelength constituents of a spectral superchannel. For example, the two outermost wavelength constituents of a spectral superchannel with ten wavelengths on a 100 GHz grid in the C-band experience a walk-off of \u223c120 ns after 1000 km of SMF\npropagation. This skew needs to be compensated at the receiver in order to interpret the data as a single logical stream.\nAs shown in Fig. 25, and as further discussed in [264], there are three aspects to transponder array integration: 1) optoelectronic array integration, i.e., the placement of multiple elements of the same kind onto a commonly integrated chip, such as modulator arrays, electrical amplifiers arrays, or multichannel DSP-ASICs; 2) optics\u2013electronics integration, i.e., the close integration (hybrid or monolithic) of the optoelectronic array and the CMOS DSP ASIC; and 3) holistic DSP integration, i.e., the codesign of DSP functions to compensate for performance shortcomings due to the high integration density of the optoelectronic hardware components. An example of the latter is the possibility to digitally compensate for crosstalk in densely integrated modulator arrays [265]. Note that multichannel ASICs are limited both by their digital (co)processing abilities and by their ability to interface with multiple high-speed data signals (cf. footnote 9 for an example of the required data rates). The DSP complexity to perform MIMO processing seems manageable at a constant interface rate of a spatial superchannel [266]."

            "text": "Table 3 summarizes the main characteristics of the above-discussed three types of SDM fibers (MCF, FMF, and CCF) in terms of the link, OA, transponder, and node design. A green circle indicates similar performance (or complexity) to the equivalent network element in SMF systems, and an orange triangle indicates higher complexity.\nMCF and CCF employ traditional refractive index profiles, which allows the fabrication of pure silica cores with similar loss characteristics as SMFs. On the other hand, the graded-index profile of FMFs requires doping in the core, leading to intrinsically higher propagation losses. In terms of fabrication complexity, the presence of multiple cores not located in the fiber center of MCFs and CCFs requires not only precise control of the core pitch but also the development of new fabrication processes of the fiber preforms. In addition, the drawing of MCFs with cladding diameters exceeding that of the SMF reduces production yield for a fixed preform volume. A preform with a larger volume than the one currently used for SMFs would\n1646 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nrequire significant modifications in both manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes.\nThe FMF requires a precise control of the graded-index profile shape to suppress DMD but can be manufactured with traditional fabrication processes. All SDM fiber types are compatible with existing cable designs. All fiber types also fulfill the standard requirements regarding bending loss. Compared to SMFs, MCFs need to manage intercore XT, and FMFs and CCFs need to manage modal properties, such as DMD and MDL. All these properties are sensitive to cabling and installation whose effects need to be considered in the fiber design phase. In terms of connectivity, the need for angular alignment in the case of MCF and CCF makes the connection and splicing process more complex. Ribbon splicing (or mass-fusion splicing) of MCFs is currently still an unresolved technical challenge. Note, however, that also the lateral alignment during the splicing of FMFs can be critical to suppress MDL, as discussed in Section V-B. Regarding the connectivity to amplifiers, all SDM fibers can be readily connected via FIFO devices or spatial mode MUX/DEMUXs (in conjunction with an array of parallel SMFs) to existing single-mode OAs. With improved technology, more energy-efficient SDM OAs (i.e., native solutions) are expected to replace single-mode amplifiers in the future. MCFs can be also designed to be directly connected to integrated transmitter and receiver arrays, while FMFs and CCFs typically need mode MUXs and MIMO DSP to jointly detect and process multiple spatial channels. When applying MCFs to network nodes, all spatial and spectral channels can be switched individually. On the other hand, in a mode-multiplexed link using FMFs or CCFs, individual coupled modes cannot be separately switched. This limits the switching granularity of FMFs and CCFs to an MG or even the whole optical fiber at a given wavelength as a switching unit.\nIn summary, the MCF offers better compatibility with existing transmission technologies, but the nature of the 2-D core arrangement requires specific fabrication processes and specific network operation if MCF polarity is of concern. Also, the number of cores that can be accommodated in MCFs with a standard cladding diameter of\n125 \u03bcm is strongly limited. Expanding the cladding diameter will require extensive further investment in manufacturing facilities and processes. On the other hand, FMFs may require MIMO DSP (for spatial demultiplexing) but are compatible with traditional single-core technologies and network operation. CCFs also require MIMO DSP, but the effect of DMD can be minimized, which makes them suitable for long-distance point-to-point links."

            "text": "We have examined a variety of methods to increase capacity in optical networks, confirming that massive spatial parallelism (SDM) is the only viable option to effectively deal with an unabated growth in network traffic. Spatial parallelism may be supported by UWB systems. For terrestrial networks, UWB systems will be used as long as they make economic sense due to the high costs of new fiber deployments. On the other hand, the power constraints of submarine systems, which comprise newly deployed cables for each installation anyway, as well as the massive amounts of data transfer and associated energy challenges of data centers, are already making SDM the preferred choice. In the long term, efficiently integrated spatial parallelism will eventually become an unavoidable requirement and will dominate all network segments.\nA P P E N D I X A. Model for the Nonlinear Fiber Channel\nThroughout the analyses presented in this article, we assume a WDM system loaded with ideal Nyquist (sinc) pulses, i.e., WDM channels with rectangular-shaped spectra (Bch = RS), and ideal Gaussian modulation constellations as approximated, e.g., by PCS with a sufficiently large QAM template. The system bandwidth of a WDM system loaded with N spectral channels is then B = NBch. Furthermore, we assume that all spectral channels within the system bandwidth B have uniform launch power Pch. Except for Fig. 3, the transmission medium is assumed to be a standard SMF with a uniform loss coefficient \u03b1 = 0.2 dB/km, dispersion parameter D = 17 ps/nm/km, and a nonlinear coefficient \u03b3 = 1.3 (W \u00b7 km)\u22121. In the case of Fig. 3, we assume a low-loss and low-nonlinearity fiber (SMFLL), with a uniform loss coefficient \u03b1 = 0.16 dB/km, dispersion parameter D = 21 ps/nm/km, and a nonlinear coefficient \u03b3 = 0.8 (W \u00b7 km)\u22121 corresponding to typical fibers used in ultralong-haul submarine transmission systems.\nThe SNR of the linear channel without implementation penalty and without linear crosstalk, i.e., \u03b7 = 1 and PXT = 0, is given by\nSNRL = Pch\nPSH + P ASE + PTRX . (A1)\nThe SNR of the nonlinear channel is given by\nSNRNL = Pch\nPSH + PASE + PTRX + PNLIN . (A2a)\nVol. 110, No. 11, November 2022 | PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE 1647\nNote that, in the main text, we omit the subscript \u201cNL\u201d when we refer to SNRNL. In a dual-polarization transmission system, such as exclusively considered in this article, Pch represents the sum of the channel\u2019s launch power in both polarizations. In an optically amplified (multispan) system, the received signal power equals the signal launch power, as the signal power is restored at each amplifier output (including an amplifier following the last span, i.e., directly at the receiver). In an unamplified single-span link, the received power is Pche\n\u2212\u03b1L [see Fig. 7(c)] with \u03b1 expressed in13 Neper/m or Neper/km. In this case, the SNRNL can be written as\nSNRNL, single = Pche\n\u2212\u03b1L\nPSH + PTRXe\u2212\u03b1L + PNLINe\u2212\u03b1L . (A2b)\nThe individual noise terms are given as follows (all normalized to the LO power PLO, which appears in the numerator and in the denominator of the SNR and consequently cancels out).\n1) LO Shot Noise:\nPSH = 2hfRS (A3)\nwhere h is Planck\u2019s constant and f is the optical frequency. We note that other shot noise terms exist, but these are negligible in a well-designed coherent receiver with PLO Pch considered for the analyses presented in this article.\n2) LO-ASE Beat Noise: 1) For ideal distributed amplification, this noise term is\nPASE = 2hfRS\u03b1L (A4)\nwith RS being the symbol rate (cf. Section III\u2013A) and where we set the factor KT equal to 1 (cf. Section IV-3). We note that, also, other beat noise terms exist, but these, too, are negligible in a welldesigned coherent receiver with balanced detection considered for the analyses presented in this article.\n2) For lumped amplification, this noise term is [267]\nPASE = 2nspNshfRS (G\u2212 1) (A5)\nwith nsp being the spontaneous emission factor, Ns = L/LS being the span number, G = e\u03b1Ls being the amplifier gain compensating for the propagation loss of the span preceding the amplifier, and LS being the span length. The amplifier\u2019s noise figure F can be obtained from the spontaneous emission factor as\nF = 2nsp 1 \u2212 1\nG\n+\n1 G . (A6)\n13The conversion from the more typically used fiber loss unit of dB/km is \u03b1Neper/km = (ln(10)/10)\u03b1dB/km.\nUnder the assumption that the amplifier is operated with sufficient gain, i.e., G 1, nsp = 1 corresponds to a noise figure of \u223c3 dB, and nsp = 1.6 corresponds to a noise figure of \u223c5 dB.\n3) Transponder Noise:\nPTRX = \u03baPch (A7)\nwith \u03ba being a constant determining the transponder noise floor.\n4) NLI Noise:\nPNLIN = \u03c7Pch 3. (A8)\nWhile several models for NLIN exist in the literature [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], we employ the GN model [87], [88], which provides analytical formulas for the NLI coefficient \u03c7 as follows.\n1) For ideal distributed amplification [91, eq. (44)]\n\u03c7 = 16\n27\u03c0\n\u03b32L |\u03b22|RS2 asinh \u03c02 3 |\u03b22|LB2\n(A9)\nwith the group velocity dispersion parameter \u03b22 = \u2212D\u03bb2/ (2\u03c0c), \u03bb being the wavelength, and c being the speed of light in a vacuum.\n2) For lumped amplification [91, eq.

Since (A10) is not reliable in conjunction with scenarios where the span loss (\u03b1Ls) drops below \u223c10 dB (which may be the case for either short span lengths or ultralow propagation losses as predicted for HCFs), (A10) was recently extended in [269] and heuristically simplified in [84] to\n\u03c7 = \u03b51asinh (\u03b52) (A11)\nwith\n\u03b51 = 8\n27\u03c0\n\u03b32\n|\u03b22|RS2 Ns \u03b1\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Ls 3\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Ls \u2212 \u03b1Lse\u2212\u03b1Ls\nand\n\u03b52 = 2\u03c02 3 |\u03b22| Ns \u03b1 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Ls \u2212 \u03b1Lse\u2212\u03b1Ls 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Ls B 2.\n1648 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE | Vol. 110, No. 11, November 2022\nIn Fig. 26, we compare (A11) with (A10) for Ns = 1 and B = 4.4 THz (C-band) as a function of loss and span length. The NLI coefficient \u03c7 given by (A11) converges to\nthat of (A9) when the span loss (i.e., either loss coefficient \u03b1 or span length LS) approaches zero. It also converges to that of (A10) when the span loss exceeds \u223c10 dB. For Ns > 1, nearly identical curves are obtained if in (A10) is set to \u223c0.08. Note that (A11) does not require the adjustment factor . We conclude, therefore, that (A11) reliably predicts \u03c7 for a wide range of parameter choices.\nNext, by taking the first derivative of (A2a) with respect to Pch, one finds the channel\u2019s optimum launch power and optimum SNRNL as\nP optch = 3\nPSH + PASE\n2\u03c7 (A12)\nand\nSNRoptNL = 1\n\u03ba+ 3 2\n3 2\u03c7 (PSH + PASE) 2 . (A13)\nNote that the optimum launch power is independent of any transponder noise floor or linear crosstalk (i.e., independent of SNR0). The curves shown in Fig. 2(b) are obtained by plotting the SE given by the SNR of the nonlinear channel (SNRNL) as a function of the SNR of the linear channel (SNRL) for a range of launch power values.\nThe above equations do not consider NLC at the receiver. Modern coherent receivers, however, often perform digital single-channel NLC on the spectral channel of interest. NLC can be taken into account analytically [88] by subtracting PNLIN of a single spectral channel (P SCNLIN), obtained by settingB = Bch in the above equations, from that of the total PNLIN as follows:\nPNLCNLIN = PNLIN \u2212 P SCNLIN (A14)\nand substituting PNLIN in (A2) with PNLCNLIN. To give an example, an improvement in SE of \u223c0.3 bit/s/Hz can be achieved with single-channel NLC for the case of distributed amplification over 1000 km of standard SMF with RS = 100 GHz, B = 4.4 THz, and \u03ba = 10\u22123, as shown in Fig. 27. Details on the system benefits of NLC are summarized, e.g., in [104] and [105].\nA c k n o w l e d g m e n t The authors gratefully acknowledge insightful discussions with respect to the Gaussian noise (GN) model with P.
