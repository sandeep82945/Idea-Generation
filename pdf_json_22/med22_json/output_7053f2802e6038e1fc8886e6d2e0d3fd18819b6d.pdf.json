Happiness and resilience are closely related to individual physical and mental health. Their contributing factors, internal mechanisms, and interventions are essential to positive psychology.\nMuch research has been conducted to study what aspects would influence happiness and resilience, and emotion regulation is one of important aspects. In terms of happiness, emotion regulation, as an essential component of social and emotional ability (Zhi et\u00a0al., 2021), is a basic capability to maintain physical and mental well-being (Martin et\u00a0al., 2017; Haijuan et\u00a0al., 2022). Emotion regulation can improve happiness by enhancing positive emotions (Quoidbach et\u00a0al., 2015) as emotion is significant to happiness from the definition (Li et\u00a0al., 2007). Many studies have proved that emotion regulation correlated with well-being (OECD, 2015; Strickhouser et\u00a0 al., 2017). Besides, emotional regulation significantly predicts happiness (Zhi et\u00a0 al., 2021). Cognitive emotion regulation has a positive effect on happiness (Kohn et\u00a0al., 2014). Moreover, cognitive appraisal, one emotion regulation strategy, also affects individual happiness (Li et\u00a0al., 2007).\nResilience also highly correlates with emotion regulation (Gross, 1998; Juzhe et\u00a0al., 2013). Previous studies have found that people with high resilience adopt positive emotion regulation and implement good emotional regulation strategies to deal with negative emotions. Emotional regulation also well reflects resilience (Bonanno and Diminich, 2013; Caina et\u00a0 al., 2016). Individuals with a high level of emotion regulation utilize positive emotion regulation strategies, which can be\u00a0used as a protective factor to stimulate internal resources to stabilize emotional state, develop positive factors, and improve the level of psychological resilience in challenges and adversity (Tugade and Fredrickson, 2007). Regulatory emotion Self-efficacy of Emotional Regulation not only directly affects psychological resilience (Yong and Zhenhong, 2013; Wenjiang et\u00a0al., 2020), but also plays a mediating role in family harmony and psychological resilience (Qisheng and Dan, 2017). For early gastric cancer patients, strengthening the intervention of emotional regulation ability can improve psychological resilience (Lili, 2019). Additionally, cognitive appraisal, one of the emotion regulation strategies, predicts psychological resilience (Guolai et\u00a0al., 2017; Sukui and Yue, 2022).\nHowever, what is the internal mechanism of the effect of emotional regulation on happiness and resilience? Are there other factors that might mediate the influence of emotional regulation on happiness and resilience? What roles do interpersonal relationships, learning motivation, and target positioning play in the impact of emotional regulation on happiness and resilience? In this article, we\u00a0built a structural equation model to explore the relationship of emotion regulation, learning motivation, target positioning, interpersonal relationship, happiness, and resilience on the basis of previous empirical research."

            "text": "Since the 1980s, researchers have paid more attention to the influence of targets on happiness (Brunstein, 1993; Kasser and\nRyan, 1996). Emmons pointed out that having the meaningful purposes in life and moving toward them is a prerequisite for wellbeing. Diener proposed in the Telic Theory that, as an important reference standard of affective system, target can affect the level of happiness and predict well-being. It is found that the internal goals orientation is highly related to positive emotions, higher satisfaction, and well-being (Vansteenkiste et\u00a0al., 2006), which also positively predict happiness (Jiejie et\u00a0 al., 2021). Besides, Individuals with a heightened sense of life purpose tend to have more robust subjective well-being (Hooker et\u00a0al., 2017).\nAlthough there were relatively few studies on the impact of target positioning on resilience, some studies proved that target positioning significantly predicts resilience (Sagone and Caroli, 2014; Biao et\u00a0al., 2022). Purpose in life is a good protective factor for resilience, which is conducive to resilience reorganization (Biao et\u00a0al., 2022). Existential psychology believes that individuals who experience the purpose and meaning of life are more likely to take a certain personal attitude toward incidents in the face of suffering, and are less likely to be\u00a0stroke down (Schulenberg et\u00a0al., 2008).\nLearning motivation and target positioning, which are of great importance to university students, affect the learning outcomes and future planning. As a complex system, learning motivation contains a series of subsystems. Target positioning, belonging to the subsystem of learning motivation as one of the motivation variables, is closely correlated to learning motivation (Ling and Dejun, 2003).\nLearning motivation is affected significantly by emotional regulation. As an active and indispensable variable in the structure of learning motivation, emotion is a necessary basis for forming and realizing learning motivation (Jianzhong and Xingyun, 1995). Thus, emotion plays an important role in learning motivation (Shilu and Youzhi, 2005). Therefore, emotion regulation can mobilize students\u2019 inner will and improve learning motivation by regulating positive emotions (Barrett et\u00a0 al., 2001). Emotion regulation strategies can also enhance the level of learning motivation (Macher et\u00a0 al., 2013). In Ling\u2019s study, during the COVID-19 period, emotions and emotion regulation significantly predicted online learning motivation due to the impact of the pandemic environment (Ling and Kuiliang, 2021). Hence, based on the previous arguments, this article proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Learning motivation and target positioning played a chain mediating role in the effect of emotion regulation on happiness.\nHypothesis 2: Learning motivation and target positioning played a chain mediating role in the effect of emotion regulation on resilience.\nInterpersonal relationship plays a critical role in university students\u2019 mental health (Jiyuan and Zhongzeng, 2012). There are many factors that affect interpersonal relationships, one of which is emotion regulation. Some studies proved that emotion, which is important to interpersonal relationship (Garner, 2010), affects how\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nindividuals deal with interpersonal communication. Thus, how to manage emotions affects the state of interpersonal relationships. Campos (Campos and Camras, 2004) proposed that the rational emotion expression and the control of emotional experience played an essential role in forming interpersonal relationships.\nIn addition, interpersonal relationships affect well-being. Previous research has shown that interpersonal relationships reflect happiness (Ling et\u00a0 al., 2007; Feng and Man, 2012). In China, interpersonal relationships have been a stronger indicator of happiness (Hong and Siping, 2012). Few studies directly explored the relationship between emotional regulation and interpersonal relationship (Lisong et\u00a0 al., 2012). Interpersonal relationship is often used as the mediating variable in the research on the influencing factors and mechanism of happiness (Tse and Yip, 2009; Ling et\u00a0al., 2013; Yangjun et\u00a0al., 2017). Moreover, it is found that interpersonal relationship plays a mediating role in the effect of emotional regulation on happiness among college students (Ling et\u00a0al., 2013). Hence, based on the abovementioned arguments, we\u00a0proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3: Interpersonal relationship mediating the influence of emotion regulation on happiness.\nIn sum, most previous studies only considered the direct impact of emotional regulation on happiness and resilience, or other factors that mediate the relationship between emotional regulation, happiness, and resilience. They paid little attention to the relationship between learning motivation, goal positioning, emotion regulation, interpersonal relationship, happiness, and resilience. Therefore, this study makes the following hypotheses: (1) Learning motivation and target positioning play a chain mediating role in the influence of emotional regulation on happiness; (2) Learning motivation and target positioning play a chain mediating role in the influence of emotional regulation on psychological resilience; and (3) Interpersonal relationship plays a mediating role in the influence of emotional regulation on happiness among university students."

The adapted scale is mainly used to measure the mental health of college students at the level of healthy personality orientation and consists of 27 questions divided into six dimensions: emotion regulation, interpersonal relationship, happiness, learning motivation, target positioning, and resilience. Interpersonal relationship mainly involves the problems of getting along with the opposite sex, dealing with interpersonal problems, communicating with strangers, and being respected by others. Emotion regulation includes the problems of emotion, external influence, and emotion control. Happiness involves the problem of satisfaction with the present situation, meaning of life, fulfillment in life, and the sense of control in life. Resilience involves the problem of the desire of challenge, recovering from setbacks, and coping with challenging. Learning motivation involves the problem of selfdiscipline, lack of motivation, procrastination, concentration, and perseverance. Target positioning includes the problem of graduation plans, future plans, and a sense of meaning in life. The higher the score on the dimension of emotion regulation and resilience, the higher the level of mental health. The higher the score on the dimension of interpersonal relationship, happiness, learning motivation, and target positioning, the lower the level of mental health. The scale has internal consistency reliability of 0.887. In this study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha measured by the adapted scale was 0.626."

            "text": "This is the first study using a questionnaire to explore the relationship and internal mechanism of emotion regulation, interpersonal relationship, learning motivation, target positioning, happiness, and resilience among 904 students from a university in Sichuan Province. The result showed that learning motivation and target positioning played a chain mediating role in the influence of emotion regulation on happiness and resilience. Besides, interpersonal relationship played an intermediary role in the effect\nbetween emotion regulation and happiness. This research helps to further understand the factors that influence happiness and resilience among university students and their internal connections with happiness and resilience. It also gives suggestions to improve happiness and resilience. The specific analysis was as follows.\nLearning motivation and target positioning played a chain mediating role in the influence of emotion regulation on happiness and resilience, which is consistent with the hypothesis of this research. Emotion regulation can indirectly predict happiness and resilience by affecting learning motivation and target positioning. Under positive emotions, students are able to understand the learning content from multiple levels and angles, organize and summarize knowledge in an orderly way, and change from mechanistic passive learning to meaningful learning. Whereas negative emotions are the opposite. Individuals with a high level of emotion regulation can adopt adaptive emotion regulation strategies to reduce the influence of negative emotions and generate positive emotions, so as to stimulate higher learning motivation. Motivation can lead to goal-directed behavior. The high level of learning motivation is closely correlated to a high level of learning self-control, a high standard of learning engagement, and high academic achievement, which all contribute to the orientation of university students in their graduation goals and life targets. Individuals who have clear targets are more likely to persist in challenges and difficulties (Schulenberg et\u00a0al., 2008), and experience more happiness.\nInterpersonal relationship played an intermediating role in the influence of emotion regulation on happiness, which is consistent with the hypothesis of this study, and verified the results of the previous study (Ling et\u00a0al., 2013). Emotion regulation is closely related to interpersonal communication situations. Individuals with high emotion regulation ability can express reasonable emotions and control inappropriate emotional experiences in different interpersonal communication environments, so as to cultivate a good interpersonal atmosphere and form a good interpersonal relationship. A good interpersonal relationship is a key to improving satisfaction and happiness (Okada et\u00a0 al., 2010). Interpersonal resources are an essential source to obtain instrumental assistance and affective support. In the context of Chinese collectivism, interpersonal relationship plays an important role. Good interpersonal relationship predicts the experience of happiness, while bad interpersonal relationship makes university students face greater psychological pressure, thus affecting their happiness.\nThis study reveals the internal mechanism of emotion regulation on happiness and resilience, and answers how emotion regulation affects happiness and resilience. Additionally, the two chain mediation models displayed in this study have certain implications for improving happiness and resilience: the cultivation of emotion regulation ability is important for the formation of good interpersonal relationships, the promotion of learning motivation, the specific positioning of goals, and the improvement of happiness and resilience. For students, it is necessary to encourage positive learning and open courses on graduation career planning, but more attention should be\u00a0paid to\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nemotional experience and expression, to improve happiness and psychological resilience. Subsequent research can continue to explore whether (1) different emotion regulation strategies in the same chainmediated model still significantly predict happiness and resilience, (2) different goal orientations, such as internal and external goals, are still influenced by learning motivation in the same chain-mediated model, and (3) different target positioning plays a mediating role in the relationship between emotional regulation and well-being and resilience. Moreover, longitudinal studies can be\u00a0designed to test the chain mediating model proposed in this study."

The results show that learning motivation and target positioning played a complete chain mediating role in the relationship between emotion regulation and happiness, but played a partially mediating role in the relationship between emotion regulation and resilience. Interpersonal relationship played a dominating mediating role in the influence of emotion regulation on happiness."
