            "text": "Materials exhibiting effective spin (Jeff) \u00bd behaviour at low temperatures have been found to be promising candidates to study the mesmerizing physics behind the dynamically disordered states due to inherent strong quantum fluctuations. In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, the competing interactions between spins enhance the quantum fluctuations resulting in unusual ground states. Particularly, in spin (S) = \u00bd 2D triangular spin systems, the quantum fluctuations are more robust, which evades the long-range ordering (LRO) even at 0 K. Such systems are proposed to be potential candidates to achieve the highly entangled quantum spin liquid (QSL) states [1-3]. Initial study on S = \u00bd systems was mainly focussed on 3d (Cu 2+ ) based compounds. Recently, this interest has extended to 4d, 5d and 4f rare earth based magnetic materials [4-18]. The signatures of Jeff = \u00bd at low temperatures has been observed in various Ru 3+ , Ir 4+ and Yb 3+ based compounds, through various experimental as well as theoretical probes. The origin of emergence of this exotic Jeff = \u00bd features has been attributed to combined effects of strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) and crystal field effects. Examples of this kind of systems include 4d honeycomb lattice \u03b1-RuCl3 [4], 5d honeycomb lattice A2IrO3 (A = Li, Na, Cu) [5-7] and H3LiIr2O6 [8]. As far as the 4f rare earth compounds are considered, Yb 3+\n-based triangular lattices are the best to understand the physics of Jeff = \u00bd.\nThese Yb-based compounds include dichalcogenide delafossites with formula AYbX2 (A = Li, Na, Ag; X = O, S, Se) [9-14], YbMgGaO4 [15, 16] and YbZnGaO4 [17]. Along with this, more recently, another Yb 3+\n- based compound K3Yb(VO4)2, belonging to the family of\nglaserite, have been found to be a potential candidate to achieve Jeff = \u00bd state [18]. In this system, based on magnetic and specific heat measurements, it is observed that the Yb 3+ - site hosts Jeff = \u00bd moments. As both Yb 3+ and Ce 3+ based systems correspond to S = \u00bd, this motivated us to investigate a Ce 3+\nbased compound, CeVO4 in same context.\nCeVO4 belongs to the family of rare earth orthovanadates with chemical formula\nRVO4. The compounds of this series show interesting magnetic and optical properties due to the presence of indirect super-exchange magnetic interaction and 4f electron-phonon coupling [19-23]. Recently, this series had gained a lot of interest as some of the compounds of this series exhibits exotic magnetic properties. In TmVO4, magnetic field tuned ferroquadrupolar quantum phase transition is reported [24, 25] whereas, a field tuned quantum criticality has been observed in DyVO4 [26]. Along with this, another member of this series HoVO4 is reported to show signatures of novel QSL state [27]. CeVO4 is an interesting compound due to its f-electron structure and complexities arising in its synthesis; as Ce can exist in both Ce 3+\nand Ce 4+ states. It has been reported to be a potential candidate in the fields of solid oxide fuel anode cells [28], luminescent materials [29] and gas sensors [30]. But, the low temperature magnetic properties of CeVO4 had not been extensively studied. Reports of first principal studies suggest the presence of insulating antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state in CeVO4 [31, 32]. The ground state term symbol for Ce 3+ is 2 F5/2 and the six-fold degeneracy of Ce 3+ ions is expected to be lifted into three Kramers doublets due to the combined effect of strong SOC and crystal electric field. Hence, it will be interesting to investigate the low temperature magnetic ground state of this compound.\nIn this manuscript, we report the signatures of magnetic ground state associated with\nJeff = \u00bd in CeVO4 at low temperatures through temperature (T) and magnetic field (H) dependent magnetic and heat capacity (C) measurements. Powder X-ray diffraction and Xray photoemission analysis confirms the presence of single-phase tetragonal structure. T dependent magnetic and C measurements at zero field do not show any signs of long-range ordering as well as spin freezing. In the low-T region, the Curie-Weiss (CW) fit to the DC magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7DC) gives the effective moment corresponding to total angular momentum, J = \u00bd, which is further confirmed by the Brillouin function fitting of field dependent magnetization curve at 2 K, corresponding to J = \u00bd. The H dependent heat capacity fits very well with two-level Schottky scheme. The magnetization and C analysis confirms that Ce 3+\nions host the Jeff = \u00bd states at low temperatures and thus, our system can\nbe a promising candidate to study the physics behind low temperature magnetic ground states in other 3D spin system."

The initial reagents were taken in the stochiometric ratio, grinded and given first heat treatment at 800 o C, followed by final sintering at 900 o C. Room temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed in the range (10\u00b0-90\u00b0) using Rigaku diffraction with Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.54) radiation. The crystal structure was refined by the Rietveld method using FullProf Suite software. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were obtained using a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 (1486.6 eV) X-ray source with an energy resolution of 400 meV and Scienta analyser (R3000). The sample surface was cleaned in situ by scraping with a diamond file until sample has the minimum O 1s signal as measured by Al K\u03b1 x-ray. The binding energy was calibrated by\nmeasuring the Fermi energy of Ag in electrical contact with the sample. The base pressure during the measurement was 5\u00d7 10 \u221210 mbar. H and T dependent magnetic measurements in the temperature range 1.8-300 K were performed using the Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) from Quantum Design, USA.

            "text": "Rietveld refinements of the XRD data obtained at 300 K shows that CeVO4 crystallizes in the tetragonal structure with the space group I41/amd and is in single phase (Fig. 1 (a)). The refinement parameters are Rp = 12.8 %, Rwp = 13.9 % and Rexp = 10.21 %, with a goodness of fit (GOF) ~ 2.6. The obtained lattice parameters a = b = (7.348 \u00b1 0.006) \u00c5, c = (6.454 \u00b1 0.003) \u00c5 and V = 355.62 \u00c5 3 are found to be in good agreement with previous reports [33]. The position coordinates and occupancy, obtained from the Rietveld refinement is given in the Table 1. The structure of CeVO4 is comprised of isolated VO4 tetrahedron (orange color) which share corners and edges with CeO8 bisdisphenoids (grey color) (Fig. 1 (b)). Each Ce atom is bonded to four different O atoms at two different distances in form of compressed and elongated bonds (i.e., Ce-Oc and Ce-Oe bonds). Thus, the CeO8 polyhedron is considered to be comprised of two interpenetrating CeO4 tetrahedra. The calculated different bond lengths and bond angles, along with the number of bonds are listed in the Table 1. Further, in order to do a comparative study, we have made a table (Table 2) describing the structural parameters of the different members of the lanthanide series (Ce \u2013 Lu) [33]. From here, it can be inferred that the lattice parameters and volume show a continuous decrement as the atomic number increases.\nIn order to get an insight on the charge states of CeVO4, we have performed XPS at\nroom temperature. Fig. 2 (a, b, c) depicts the Ce 3d, V 2p and O 1s core level XPS spectra. The in-elastic background is subtracted using the Touggard function [34] and the peaks are fitted using the Voigt function. The solid red and green lines in the figure represent the resultant fit and individual fitted peaks, respectively. Fig. 2 (a) reveals the XPS spectra of Ce 3d. Two peaks at 881.3 and 885.5 eV demonstrates the presence of Ce 3d5/2, while another two peaks appearing at 899.7 eV and 904.2 eV corresponds to Ce 3d3/2 peaks. The binding energies at 885.8 eV and 904.4 eV represents the 3d10 4f1 electronic state, corresponding to\nCe 3+ oxidation state [35]. For Ce 4+ electronic state, the XPS spectrum shows the peaks at 884.82 eV and 882.43 eV binding energies [36]. In the analysed XPS spectra, no peaks corresponding to the above-mentioned energies is found and this rules out the presence of Ce 4+ oxidation state. The four deconvoluted peaks, shown by the solid green lines, confirm the presence of Ce 3+ electronic state. In addition, two different peaks of less intensity (shown by the black arrows) belong to vibrational satellites of Ce 3d state. The fitted core XPS spectra of V 2p are represented in the Fig. 2 (b). The V 2p spectrum is characterised by two states: 2p3/2 and 2p1/2. The peaks at 516.7 and 524.2 eV are attributed to the dominant V 5+ oxidation state [37]. Along with this, a very minor peak around 514.8 eV can be seen which is ascribed to the 2p3/2 trace of the V 3+ state present at the surface of the sample [38]. This V 3+ state is believed to reduce to V 5+ state on exposing to oxygen in the air [38]. Further, Fig. 2 (c) indicates that the O 1s spectra appear as two broad peaks centred around 529.8 eV (major peak) and 531.4 eV (minor peak). The former value corresponds to the lattice oxygen (i.e., O 2-\nof the CeVO4) [39] and the latter one is ascribed to the surface adsorbed oxygen\nattributed to the defects or off-balance oxygen stoichiometry [40]. Also, in order to investigate the chemical composition of the sample, we have performed energy dispersive xray spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS spectrum (not shown here) illustrates the presence of Ce, V and O elements and no other impurities are seen. The weight percentage is found to be consistent with previous results on pure CeVO4 [41]."

            "text": "T dependent DC magnetic susceptibility ( DC) measurements at different applied fields (up to 60 kOe) are performed under the zero-field cooling (ZFC) condition and are shown in the main panels of Fig. 3. As noted from Fig. 3 (a), the 100 Oe and 10 kOe curves follow same path. An inflection point is observed around 160 K for the 100 Oe curve (shown by the black arrow). For better visualization of this behaviour, we have plotted the same in an expanded form (inset of Fig. 3 (a)). It is also to be noted that the curve below and above this inflection point follows the paramagnetic (PM) behaviour. This implies that around 160 K, the Ce spins try to order and with decrease in T, the spins again attain the random configuration. To investigate the effect of magnetic field on the inflection point, we have plotted the T dependence of differential susceptibility (d DC/dT) at various applied fields, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 (b). The curve at 100 Oe shows a dip around 162 K which vanishes at 500 Oe. To shed some more light on this observed feature, we have performed temperature dependent AC susceptibility and heat capacity measurements. Fig. 4 depicts the real part of the AC\nsusceptibility (\u03c7\u2019) in the temperature regime of 1.8 \u2013 200 K at various frequencies (31 \u2013 831 Hz) with AC amplitude 2 Oe and zero DC field. The curve does not show any signature of inflection around 160 K. The behaviour can be more clearly visualised from the inset of Fig. 4 which shows the same data in an expanded form. Additionally, the curve does not exhibit any frequency dependent peak, thereby, ruling out the possibility of any kind of spin freezing. The zero-field heat capacity data (discussed in details in the next section) do not show any peak around the inflection point which indicates towards the absence of any kind of long ranged magnetic ordering. Thus, it is believed that around 160 K, the Ce spins try to order in a preferred direction, but the magnetic interactions are not strong enough to induce a longrange magnetic ordering. Below 160 K, the spins again acquire random configuration. Similar kind of behaviour was also reported in a pyrochlore Na3Co(CO3)2Cl where the magnetic susceptibility exhibits an inflection point at 17 K, but the neutron diffraction data do not reveal any long range ordering [42]. Further, as mentioned above, we have performed T dependent DC measurements at various applied fields. Fig. 3 (b) illustrates the T response of DC at H 30 kOe. From here, it is evident that DC does not show signs of saturation even at an applied field of 60 kOe, implying that the spins do not tend to align along the direction of applied field. This signifies that the Ce spins prefer to remain disordered even in the presence of high external magnetic field of 60 kOe.\nFig. 5 (a) shows the inverse DC magnetic susceptibility ( ) vs. T curve at 100 Oe.\nIn the high-T (HT) region (above 160 K), the data is fitted with CW law: (T \u2013 \u03b8HT)/CHT (shown by the solid red line). The obtained values of the HT Curie constant (CHT) and HT Curie-Weiss temperature (\u03b8HT) are (0.855 0.001) emu/mol-Oe-K and (\u2013119.631 0.422) K, respectively. The obtained value matches well with the theoretical value calculated by using the expression given as: C = NA(gJ\u00b5B) 2 J(J+1)/3kB (where NA, \u00b5B and kB are Avogadro\u2019s number, Bohr magneton and Boltzmann constant respectively. gJ and J corresponds to Lande\u2019s factor and total angular momentum, respectively), with J = 7/2 and gJ = 0.877. The calculated value of gJ matches very well with the theoretical value of gJ = 6/7 ~ 0.857 for Ce 3+ state. Also, the experimentally calculated effective magnetic moment (= 2.8\n~ 2.58 ), matches very well with the theoretically calculated value of = 2.54 for Ce 3+ , having 2 F5/2 multiplet with gJ = 6/7. This implies that the thermal energy is comparable to the crystal field splitting in this temperature range and all the states are equally populated. The negative sign of \u03b8HT signifies the dominance of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations among the Ce 3+\nspins. Also, in the HT regime, the large value of \u03b8HT can be attributed to the\ndominance of crystal electric field (CEF) excitation of Ce 3+ , along with the antiferromagnetic correlations. From the ground state term symbol 2 F5/2, the total angular momentum is J = 5/2 and it exhibits 2J + 1 = six-fold degeneracy. In the CEF environment of D2d symmetry, the energy levels split into three Kramer doublets. The ground state doublet is separated from the first excited doublet by an energy difference which is termed as the CEF gap. In many Ybbased systems (S = \u00bd), this gap has been calculated and is found to be proportional to the parameter \u03b8HT [43, 44, and 45]. In these systems, the observed large value of \u03b8HT is correlated to a large CEF gap. Thus, in our system CeVO4, as \u03b8HT is large (~ - 110.23 K), the CEF gap is also expected to be large. At temperatures lower than the gap (where the CEF excitations are\nnot that much dominating) a slope change in is observed. This deviation from the CW law possibly indicates towards the evolution of a ground state CEF doublet with small exchange couplings. Thus, in order to get an insight on the low-T (LT) magnetic ground state, we have further plotted the as a function of T below 20 K and at 100 Oe (Fig. 5 (b)). This data is fitted with the modified CW law: 1/ [\u03c70 +CLT/(T \u2013 \u03b8LT)], as shown by the solid red line [18]. Here, the 0 term is composed of the contribution from the core diamagnetic susceptibility and temperature independent Van Vleck paramagnetic susceptibility. This term is included as it contributes to DC at low temperatures. The obtained values of 0, CLT and \u019fLT are ~ (2.67 \u00d7 10 -3 0.096 \u00d7 10-3) emu/mole-Oe, ~ (0.168 0.001) emu/mol-Oe-K and ~ (- 0.372 0.005) K, respectively. The obtained CLT gives the effective moment equal to 1.16\nwhich is very less than the theoretically calculated value (~ 2.54 ) for free Ce 3+ ion. This reduced value can be attributed to the presence of J = \u00bd doublet at LT regime with ground state of Ce 3+\nion having Jeff = \u00bd and gJ = 1.20, obtained from the value of CLT. The\nnegative value of \u019fLT signifies the presence of weak AFM correlations among the Ce 3+ spins. Furthermore, H dependent magnetization (M) measurement at 2 K (> \u019fLT) is performed up to a field of 60 kOe and is shown in the Fig. 6. It displays linear behaviour up to 10 kOe and then starts showing the features of non-linearity at higher fields. The red solid line shows the fitting to the simulation of the Brillouin function for the J = \u00bd given by the equation:\n\u2026\u2026.. (1)\nwhere, gJ, J, \u00b5B and kB are Lande\u2019s g-factor, total angular momentum, Bohr magneton and Boltzmann constant, respectively. The best fit to the equation with J = \u00bd yields the value of gJ ~ 1.13 0.02, which matches very well with the one obtained from the LT (T). Thus, our magnetic analysis shows the signature of presence of Jeff = \u00bd state at low temperatures."

Fig. 7 depicts the temperature response of C measured at 0 Oe, along with solid red line showing the fitting to equation (2). The obtained parameters from the fitting are ~ (348 \u00b1 3) K, ~ (939 \u00b1 19) K and m ~ (0.83 \u00b1 0.01). Additionally, inset (a) of Fig. 7 shows the same curve in a small temperature regime (150 \u2013 160 K). No feature was noted in the curve (in contrast to the \u03c7DC curve at 100 Oe), implying the absence of any kind of magnetic ordering. Further, the inset (b) of Fig. 7 shows the expanded view of the same data below 15 K. An upturn is clearly visible around 5 K, as shown by an arrow. This upturn is attributed to emerge from the Schottky anomaly of Ce 3+ ions. This upturn exhibits field dependent behaviour and shows an increment on increasing the H (Fig. 8 (a)). At 70 kOe, it exhibits a hump centred around 2.5 K, implying that this hump is possibly present at T below 1.8 K for lower fields. This behaviour can be ascribed to the Zeeman splitting of the ground state Kramer doublet (J = 1/2) on application of H. In order to further understand it, we have used two-level Schottky scheme given by the equation [18]:\nC (H kOe) \u2013 C (0 kOe) =\n\u2026\u2026... (3)\nwhere, \u0394 is the Zeeman energy gap between the energy levels of the ground state doublet. Fig. 8 (b) shows the data corresponding to C (H kOe) \u2013 C (0 kOe). The solid red lines show the best fitting to the two-level Schottky scheme defined in the equation (3). The obtained value\nof \u0394 follows a linear behaviour with respect to H, as clearly visible from the inset of Fig. 8 (b), implying that the splitting between the ground state doublet increases linearly with externally applied magnetic fields. This trend found in \u0394 is fitted with an equation \u0394 = gJ\u00b5BH, as shown by solid red line (inset of Fig. 8 (b)). The obtained value of gJ from the slope of fit is found to be ~ (1.073 0.055), which is in good agreement with our magnetic studies. Hence, it can be said that, this observation from the heat capacity, along with magnetic measurements confirm the presence of Jeff = \u00bd ground state at low temperature in CeVO4. Thus, our studies suggest that CeVO4 is a potential candidate to study the physics behind the Jeff = \u00bd in 3D spin systems."

            "text": "The realization of Jeff = \u00bd magnetic ground state in rare earth magnetic systems attract great attention, as it can be an alternative to Cu-based spin (S) = \u00bd systems. In the presence of strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) and crystal field effects, the rare earth ions with odd number of 4f electrons can be treated as Kramer\u2019s doublet with effective spin, Jeff = \u00bd. In this context, a number of Yb-based quantum magnets have shown experimental signatures of Jeff = \u00bd magnetic ground state [11 \u2013 18]. The eight-fold degenerate J = 7/2 states of the Yb 3+ ions split into four Kramer\u2019s doublet due to combined effect of SOC and crystalline electric field. In these systems, the ground state and first excited state are separated by a large energy gap such that the low temperature magnetic ground state can be ascribed to a pseudospin \u2013 \u00bd with effective gJ parameter. The compounds with Ce 3+ ions also exhibit odd number of 4f electrons with ground state term symbol 2 F5/2. The six-fold degenerate J = 5/2 states split into three Kramer\u2019s doublets. Also, we have compared our experimental observations on CeVO4 with other conventionally reported Yb-based systems. A good number of Yb-based chalcogenides, AYbX2 (A = monovalent ions like Li, Na, Ag; X = divalent chalcogen ions like O, S, Se) are also reported to exhibit Jeff = \u00bd ground state [9 \u2013 14]. Namely, NaYbS2 [10], NaYbO2 [11], and NaYbSe2 [12] exhibits large energy gap between the ground state and first excited state which is around 200 K, 400 K and 180 K, respectively. This energy gap is directly related to the CW temperature obtained from the CW fitting in the high temperature PM regime. At low temperatures, considerably lower than this energy gap, the magnetic properties are well described by the effective spin \u2013 \u00bd state. In CeVO4, the large value of the CW temperature (~ - 120 K) signifies the presence of large energy gap between the ground state and first excited state. The low temperature magnetic and heat capacity studies yield the signatures of magnetic ground state associated with Jeff = \u00bd. As mentioned above, till now,\nsuch kind of study was mainly focussed on transition metal-based system having spin angular momentum (S = \u00bd) and 2D triangular Yb-based systems. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of study is not reported in 3D spin systems and hence, we believe that our study might be beneficial to explore the possibility of effective spin \u2013 \u00bd state in other 3D spin systems."
