    "abstractText": "To evaluate the stability and permanence of the liquid film created after the instillation of 0.15% crosslinked hyaluronic acid with liposomes and crocin versus the effect of 0.15% standard hyaluronic acid, a prospective, longitudinal, single-blind, single-center study was conducted in symptomatic populations with a novel noninvasive ocular surface analyzer. Limbal and bulbar redness classification, lipid layer thickness, tear meniscus height, and first and mean noninvasive break-up time (FNIBUT and MNIBUT) were performed before and 30 and 45 min after liposomecrosslinked hyaluronic acid (LCHA) and standard hyaluronic acid (HA) eye drop instillations. LCHA had a higher lipid layer thickness than HA (grades 2.00 \u00b1 0.83 and 1.17 \u00b1 0.63 on the Guillon pattern, respectively). LCHA achieved a better tear meniscus height than HA (0.23 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 mm, respectively). LCHA improved FNIBUT and MNIBUT more than HA (for FNIBUT, 6.30 \u00b1 0.94 and 4.77 \u00b1 0.89 s, respectively. For MNIBUT, 17.23 \u00b1 5.11 and 12.41 \u00b1 4.18 s, respectively). Crosslinking hyaluronic acid with liposomes and crocin significantly increases the permanence and stability of the lipid, aqueous, and mucin tear film layers. In a short-term period, liposome and crosslinked hyaluronic acid achieved better first and mean noninvasive break-up times than standard",

            "text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is usually a consequence of several related factors. On the one hand, abnormal physiology of the Meibomian glands and reduced tear production or excessive evaporation produce evaporative DED and aqueous-deficient DED, respectively. The heterogeneous nature of disease and the variability of signs and symptoms do not allow an accurate diagnosis. Earlier studies have measured tear meniscus height using the Schirmer test and tear break-up time (BUT) invasively using fluorescein [1\u20133]. The use of non-invasive diagnostic tests that improve the repeatability of measurement and diagnosis is recommended, and comprehensive DED treatment is jointly considering the symptoms and all possible etiologies [4]. Included among the non-invasive instruments for dry eye measurement are the LipiView\u00ae interferometer (TearScience Inc., Morrisville, NC, USA), the IDRA\u00ae ocular surface analyzer from SBM System\u00ae (Orbassano, Torino,\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3719. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11133719 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3719 2 of 13\nItaly), and the Ocular Surface Analyser (OSA) from SBM System\u00ae (Orbassano, Torino, Italy) [5\u20137]. The OSA is an instrument very similar to IDRA; however, IDRA performed an automatic tear meniscus measurement, while OSA does it manually. Lipi View II is a limited instrument that does not measure subjective questionnaire, conjunctival hyperemia, or NIBUT. In our study, an automated, non-invasive diagnosis of the ocular surface was performed with the OSA. The OSA allows to identify the type of DED and which layers of the tear should be treated according to the type of deficiency [5,8]. Artificial tears are used in the treatment of dry eye as a substitute for the tear film. Usually, they all have an aqueous base to which different molecules are added to improve their lubrication, viscosity, osmolarity, tolerance, and residence time on the ocular surface [9]. Many of the tear preparations include viscosifying agents in their composition that function as a lubricant and increase the permanence of the ophthalmic solution on the ocular surface. There are few studies reporting the ocular surface effects of artificial tears that include Crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA), liposomes, and crocin in their composition. That is why we carried out our study to ascertain whether there is an improvement in the anterior surface of the eye after using a tear that combines the three components. In recent years, it is very common to include HA in the composition of artificial tears. HA is a linear polymer with a high molecular weight, a natural origin, and a high hydrophilic property. It does not generate an immune response and has a viscoelastic capacity. When formulated in eye drops, it improves the stability of the tear film by better retaining water and helps keep the ocular surface lubricated, hydrated, and protected [10\u201313]. In addition, it has a high regenerative, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory capacity [14,15]. HA concentrations vary from 0.03%, 0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.18% to 0.4% [1,13] in the wide variety of commercially marketed eye drops. However, the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid decreases over time [16]. Crosslinked HA increases its molecular density and allows the effects to last longer because the body takes longer to reabsorb and degrade it, endowing it with better longevity [15]. In addition, the incorporation of antioxidant agents in the formulation of artificial tears is recommended, since oxidative stress is one of the factors involved in DED [17]. Crocin is a natural chemical compound of the carotenoid or pigment type found in the stigmas of the Crocus sativus or saffron flower. Specifically, it is the diester formed from the disaccharide gentiobiose and the dicarboxylic acid crocetin [18]. It belongs to a group of unusual carotenoids due to its solubility in water. In addition, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties stand out [18,19], and, in aqueous solution, it is capable of increasing the viscosity and mucoadhesive properties of the preparation on the ocular surface [20]. The presence of lipids is also recommended in the formulation of tear preparations, especially when there is tear film lipid layer (TFLL) instability [2,21]. The use of liposomes, which are lipid vesicles that allow replenishment (TFLL) and reduce the surface evaporation of water, is recommended [21,22]. In addition, liposomal formulations are often used as transport vehicles for active ingredients, both hydrophilic and lipophilic, improving their bioavailability at the ocular level [21]. The combination of crosslinked HA, liposomes, and crocin should generate a synergistic action on the ocular surface, improving the stability of the tear film after instillation. The purpose of this research was to make a non-invasive diagnosis of the ocular surface in terms of limbal and bulbar redness, lipid layer thickness, tear meniscus height, and break-up time, and to evaluate the stability and permanence of the liquid film created after the instillation of 0.15% crosslinked hyaluronic acid with liposomes and crocin versus the effect of 0.15% standard hyaluronic acid alone."

            "text": "LLT is produced mainly in the Meibomian glands and contains mostly (80\u201390%) low polarity lipids (wax esters, cholesterol, and triglycerides) that are located in the outermost part, and 10\u201320% high polarity lipids (free fatty acids, glycolipids, lecithins, and phospholipids) that are located in the deepest part, orienting their hydrophilic polar group toward the aqueous phase [29]. The main function of the lipid phase is to prevent the evaporation of the aqueous phase [30]. Alterations of the lipid layer can be both qualitative and quantitative and are the cause of many of the changes related to dry eye [21,31]; therefore, maintaining the stability of the lipid layer is considered essential in clinical practice to prevent evaporation and improve the symptoms of these patients. Currently, it is common to include lipids in the formulation of eye drops [21] to restore the altered lipid layer, reduce the evaporation of the tear film, and relieve the symptoms of DED. The instillation of a single lipid-containing artificial tear drop is capable of increasing the thickness of the lipid layer [32,33]. Our results confirmed this trend and showed a statistically significant increase in the LCHA group at 30 and 45 min after drop instillation compared to the HA group. In a longitudinal approach, this trend was also maintained over time, showing statistically significant increases in LLT at 30 min (p < 0.01) and 45 min (p = 0.04) in the LCHA group. LCHA eye drops contain liposomes, which are spherical structures that form spontaneously when lipids are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Phospholipids are commonly used in the manufacture of liposomes [9] to increase the thickness of the lipid layer. Our results are consistent with studies that show an increase in LLT after the instillation of drops that include lipids in their composition [32,34\u201336]. However, in the HA group, the thickness of the lipid layer decreased at 30 min (0.50 \u00b1 0.51 degrees on the Guillon Scale) (p = 0.01) and 45 min (0.04 \u00b1 0.55 degrees on the Guillon Scale) (p = 0.70). HA is an excellent ocular lubricant due to its high capacity to retain water [16,37]. By instilling HA eye drops, the volume of the aqueous layer increases, which improves the distribution of the lipid layer [38], producing the LLT thinning shown by our results. Goto et al. [38] reported that dry eye disease patients present a thicker lipid layer due the lack of aqueous tear film. Consequently, HA instillation replenishes the aqueous part of the tear and therefore the lipid layer returns to the original volume according to our reported results. In their research, Li et al. [39] reported a decrease in LLT in a group of patients without alteration of the lipid layer after the administration of HA. In addition, they showed that the lower the concentration of HA, the higher the LLT increases in subjects with lipid deficiencies."

            "text": "The mucin layer is the highly hydrated inner layer of the tear film that covers the corneal and conjunctival epithelium. It is comprised of hydrated glycoproteins secreted by the goblet cells of the conjunctiva. Mucin contributes to water retention on the ocular surface [44]. Our study included two tear break-up times using the OSA, the first break-up time (FNIBUT) and the mean break-up time (MNIBUT), which is the mean of all tear film break-ups that occur over the entire cornea. There was an increase in FNIBUT in the LCHA group between instillation and the following 30 and 45 min with statistically significant values (p < 0.01). However, in the HA group, FNIBUT decreased 30 min after eye drop instillation. Regarding MNIBUT, the LCHA group also showed increases with statistical significance at 30 and 45 min after instillation, while, in the HA group, the average time increased over time, but only with statistical significance at 45 min after instillation. To our knowledge, the active ingredients that promote mucin secretion are diquafosol sodium and rebamipide, which were recently introduced in the Japanese market [45]. HA is ineffective when the cause of DED is due to alteration of the mucin layer, since it does not act on goblet cells, but its high capacity to retain water provides beneficial effects that improve dry eye symptoms. This capacity is increased when combined with other molecules (galactoxyloglucan, cyanocobalamin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, crocin, liposomes, etc.) [1\u20133,16,24,46] or when formulated as LCHA. The results of our study show how both FNIBUT and MNIBUT were improved in the LCHA group compared to the HA group. A similar trend has been confirmed by numerous investigations [1\u20133,16,24,25,46] showing that the use of HA and LCHA drops in combination with other agents improves dry eye-related symptomatology, including tear break-up time values."
