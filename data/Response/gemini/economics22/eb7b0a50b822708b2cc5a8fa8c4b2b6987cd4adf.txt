1. **Investigate the role of social media in disseminating health insurance information and its impact on health insurance uptake, particularly among women in Rwanda.** This could involve conducting a survey or focus group study to understand how women use social media to access health information, their perceptions of health insurance, and the factors that influence their decision to enroll in a health insurance scheme.


2. **Explore the relationship between women's empowerment and health insurance utilization in different regions of Rwanda.** This could involve conducting a comparative study to examine the variations in health insurance coverage and women's empowerment across different regions and identify the factors that contribute to these variations.


3. **Assess the impact of health insurance on maternal and child health outcomes in Rwanda.** This could involve conducting a longitudinal study to track the health outcomes of women and children who are enrolled in health insurance schemes compared to those who are not, and to determine the extent to which health insurance contributes to improved health outcomes.


4. **Evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies to increase health insurance coverage among women in Rwanda.** This could involve conducting a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of different interventions, such as financial incentives, community-based education programs, or mobile health interventions, in increasing health insurance uptake among women.


5. **Examine the role of the government and other stakeholders in promoting health insurance coverage among women in Rwanda.** This could involve conducting a policy analysis to assess the existing policies and programs aimed at increasing health insurance coverage among women, and to identify areas where improvements can be made.
