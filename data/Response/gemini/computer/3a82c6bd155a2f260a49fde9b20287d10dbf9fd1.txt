1. **Investigate the use of the emulator for longitudinal studies.** The emulator could be used to track changes in core affect dynamics and social participation over time. This could provide valuable insights into the development of social behavior and the impact of life events on affect and social behavior.


2. **Explore the use of the emulator for different social contexts.** The emulator has been tested on a dataset of dyadic interactions. It would be interesting to see how it performs in other social contexts, such as group interactions or online interactions.


3. **Develop a more sophisticated causal model.** The current emulator uses a simple causal model that assumes that core affect dynamics directly cause social participation. A more sophisticated model could take into account the role of other factors, such as personality traits and situational factors.


4. **Investigate the use of the emulator for generating synthetic data.** The emulator could be used to generate synthetic data that could be used to train machine learning models. This could be useful for developing new affective computing applications.


5. **Explore the use of the emulator for understanding the effects of interventions.** The emulator could be used to simulate the effects of different interventions on core affect dynamics and social participation. This could be useful for designing interventions to improve social behavior.
