First, teachers\u2019 professional agency, the volitional actions they take\nin response to perceived opportunities, was examined to consider individual\ndifferences in its enactment. Second, \u201cstrong\u201d emotions have been proposed\nas important in teaching and learning, and we wished to clarify which basic\nemotions might be involved, besides curiosity, which is a known emotional\nfactor in engagement in teaching. We also explored how agency and basic\nemotions might be related.\nApproach: Thirteen teachers working in Scottish secondary schools were\ninterviewed at the start of the covid pandemic in 2020 to discuss relevant\nfeelings, thoughts and actions arising from unprecedented changes in their\nlives and professional practices. Thematic analysis was used to identify aspects\nof agentic behavior and basic emotions expressed.\nFindings: Teacher agency was expressed through adaptability, collective\nagency, constrained agency, and non-action. Four basic emotion percepts\nwere identified, which we label as \u201cCARE\u201d, \u201cCURIOSITY\u201d, \u201cCOOPERATION\u201d, and\n\u201cCHALLENGE\u201d.\nOriginality: We extend the definition of agency to include volitional\nnon-action as a response to opportunity. In contrast to prior research\nemphasizing emotions as an outcome of volitional behavior, we explore\nemotions preceding agency. We develop four theoretical propositions related\nto teacher emotions. (1) Four emotion percepts substantially influence\nteachers\u2019 voluntary motivated behavior. (2) The amount and proportion\nof emotions experienced varies between individual teachers. (3) The four\npercepts are experienced concurrently or in rapid succession in engaged\nteaching contexts. (4) Professional experience and specific situational factors\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nalso influence teachers\u2019 behavioral choices. For future consideration, we\nsuggest that awareness of emotion percepts may encourage both teachers\u2019\nengagement and their professional agency for the benefit of their pedagogical\npractice and outcomes for their students.\nKEYWORDS\nteaching, individual differences, education, agency, emotion, emotion percept, complex dynamic systems, thematic analysis"

            "heading": "Introduction",
            "text": "The commitment that humans make to teaching is unique. Despite the prevalence of social learning behavior, few other species have been found to demonstrate teaching, changing their behavior at a cost to themselves to support a learner in acquiring new skills or knowledge (Caro and Hauser, 1992; Kline, 2015). Many of our own species, on the other hand, intentionally devote significant amounts of their limited resources to transmit cumulative cultural capital to others. Research investigating teaching has largely focused on cognitive phenomena and behavioral outcomes, notably neglecting close examination of the role of emotions in teachers\u2019 volitional engagement in their chosen profession (Carson and Chase, 2009; Han and Yin, 2016), despite growing recognition of the role played by emotions in teaching and learning (Pekrun et al., 2007; Keller and Becker, 2021). The research reported in the current paper therefore seeks to expand on the question \u201cwhat motivates us to teach?\u201d with an assumption that there is a significant role for basic emotions in addition to cognitive and behavioral factors, recognizing that relationships between factors involved in teaching constitute complex dynamic systems. Before detailing the research methods and findings, we offer context by expanding on theories about teacher agency, and on current accounts of the role emotion plays in teaching.\nExisting theories of teacher agency\nTeacher agency remains poorly conceptualized and undertheorized, despite growing recognition of its value in education settings (Emirbayer and Mische, 1998; Priestley et al., 2015; Aspbury-Miyanishi, 2022). The lack of consensus is partly due to recognition that teacher agency is a complex multilevel construct, often considered in conjunction with other constructs such as identity and power (Impedovo, 2021; Sherman and Teemant, 2021). Nevertheless, we take as a starting position Sherman and Teemant\u2019s summary of agency as \u201caction taken not accidentally, unknowingly, unwittingly or unwillingly\u201d (2021, p. 5). A recurring consideration of teacher\u2019s agency has been the influence of the social context in which it is experienced, including factors such as available resources, relations with\nothers (Impedovo, 2021), policies, norms, language, and support structures (Lasky, 2005), as well as relationships between teachers, their colleagues, pupils, and parents (Pyh\u00e4lt\u00f6 et al., 2015).\nReasons proposed for the recent growing interest in teachers\u2019 agency may appear contradictory (Erss, 2018). On the one hand is the perception that recent education initiatives necessitate teachers\u2019 active engagement in collective issues requiring change, such as shaping pedagogical practices, curriculum reform, and social progress (Pyh\u00e4lt\u00f6 et al., 2014; Biesta et al., 2015; Priestley et al., 2015). Individually, teachers are also required to be \u201chorizon workers\u201d (Tateo, 2021, p. 93), responding dynamically to their students\u2019 ongoing progression and their own professional development. Indeed, teachers subject to fewer constraints imposed by rigidly defined curricula (Sang, 2020) are assumed to be acting in response to their own values and goals rather than simply delivering centrally mandated curriculum content (Scottish Executive, 2006b). On the other hand, education reforms have also made teachers accountable for delivery of practices, such as standard tests, to which they may have had no input, resulting in perceptions of being deprived of professional standing, collective power, and individual agency (Sahlberg, 2010; Tao and Gao, 2017; Benesch, 2018). Combining these two viewpoints, personal history, school contexts and the prevailing political milieu unite in complex ways to affect teachers\u2019 experience of agency, both from a bottom-up perspective driven by the individual\u2019s values, and from a top-down socio-cultural perspective involving a web of intricate interactions.\nCompared to the sociocultural and temporal focus on teacher agency, relatively little effort has been focused on individual differences in teachers\u2019 experience of agency. Although MacLean (2016) concurs with the notion of teacher agency as an emergent phenomenon, she proposes that it develops through a process of reflective, individualized practice. By contrast, Aspbury-Miyanishi (2022) argues that, although teachers may retrospectively ascribe actions to be the result of conscious choices, in fact experienced teachers recognize themselves as making few conscious choices. Instead, they act in the only way they consider appropriate to the circumstances in which they find themselves. From a theoretical perspective\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\ntherefore, a clear gap exists in our understanding of how teachers differ in their enactment of agency."

            "text": "Emotions are increasingly recognized as integral to engagement in teaching and learning, and to teachers\u2019 experience of agency when contentious situations arise (Benesch, 2018). Research into the role of emotions in workplaces has been limited compared to more general contexts (H\u00f6kk\u00e4 et al., 2019), with education settings forming a subset of such research, and a still smaller body of work specifically focused on teachers\u2019 rather than students\u2019 emotions (e.g., Hannula, 2012; Frenzel, 2014; Xu, 2018; Henritius et al., 2019; Sun and Yang, 2021). Relations between teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 emotions have been investigated in both directions. Effects of teachers\u2019 emotions on students include the impact on Students\u2019 emotions and perceptions, competence, motivation, use of regulatory strategies, academic performance, discipline, and social behavior (Fried, 2010; Rodrigo-Ruiz, 2016). Conversely, teacher emotions are impacted by students\u2019 academic performance, behavior, student-teacher relationships, students\u2019 reported enjoyment and the perceived effectiveness of support they receive (Frenzel et al., 2007; Scott and Sutton, 2009; Beilock et al., 2010; Klassen et al., 2012; Chang, 2013). Students believe that good teachers nurture their wellbeing, despite researchers\u2019 ongoing issues with how to measure \u201cgoodness\u201d (Usher, 2021).\nIn practice, teachers\u2019 emotions are proposed as resulting from appraisal and evaluation of multi-component relationships (Reschly and Christenson, 2012; Frenzel, 2014; Reeve and Su, 2014). Although there is recognition in existing literature of reciprocity between cognitive constructs (such as goals, perceptions, and appraisals), and teachers\u2019 emotions (Baird et al., 1990; Frenzel, 2014), examination of relationships between these constructs has typically considered the impact of cognitions on emotion (Chang, 2013). Specifically, Control-Value Theory proposes that emotions result from appraisal of the perception of control one has, and the value assigned to specific goals and situations (Pekrun and Perry, 2014). In the specific case of teachers, Frenzel (2014) proposes a model that links emotions with antecedents such as perception of student behaviors, goals for student behaviors, and appraisals of student and teacher performance and progress toward meeting goals. The resulting achievement emotions include enjoyment, pride, enthusiasm, anger, anxiety and shame, depending on appraisal of outcomes (Frenzel, 2014; Owens and Hudson, 2021). Similarly, beliefs about self-efficacy have been related to resulting emotions and the degree of effort teachers subsequently expend (Jarrell et al., 2017; Harley et al., 2020). The focus to date on teachers\u2019 emotional outcomes contrasts with the dearth of research on\nroutes by which teachers\u2019 emotions impact their beliefs and actions.\nDistinguishing basic and secondary emotions\nIn broad terms, emotions are complex constructs incorporating neural, physiological and behavioral responses to stimuli, together with subjective responses to the experience (Celeghin et al., 2017). A contentious debate continues about whether humans experience basic emotions that are distinguishable from secondary emotions (Ortony, 2021; compare Fossati, 2012; Feldman-Barrett, 2017). Secondary emotions are distinguished by their abundance and by presumed complex processes involving cognitive appraisal of situations that gives rise to their experience (Braniecka et al., 2014; Linnenbrink-Garcia and Barger, 2014). One set of criteria for basic emotions includes the presence of distinct biological mechanisms closely associated with specific behavior, thought and memory responses, characterized by distinct physiology and physiognomy, early ontogeny and phylogeny, and rapid arousal and short duration (Ekman, 1992). Theoretical accounts disagree, among other things, on the number of basic emotions proposed, which some argue do not correlate directly with what they term \u201csurvival circuits\u201d (Panksepp et al., 2017, p. 192). In addition to biological definitions of what constitutes a basic emotion, Celeghin et al. (2017) also offer categorical and psychological definitions of basicness. Categorical definitions incorporate sufficient criteria to allow specific examples to be confidently included in, or excluded from that category, for example \u201ctrees\u201d incorporates oak and ash, while excluding daffodil. For present purposes, therefore, basic emotions are defined as referring to only a single emotion, as distinct from combinations of single emotions or combinations of emotion and cognition (Celeghin et al., 2017).\nIn education settings, teachers\u2019 curiosity has been shown to impact relationships with students to a small but significant extent (Amorim Neto et al., 2020). For example, Izard (2007) identified curiosity as a ubiquitous quality that sustains active engagement in exploration, improved learning, information retrieval and behavior choices (see also Grossnickle, 2016; Oudeyer et al., 2016). Experiencing curiosity also allows humans to benefit from their own and others\u2019 experiences, passed on through cultural knowledge (Silvia, 2017). Curiosity is also considered to be a fundamental emotion driving and maintaining cognitive system development (Buck, 2014). Consistent with the comments about emotion above, there is also no universally agreed definition of curiosity (Pekrun, 2019), nor is it always clear when potential synonyms such as openness, interest and seeking are being used to describe the same phenomenon (Grossnickle, 2016). Nonetheless, curiosity is considered as an adaptive emotion that motivates\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nlearning (Alcaro and Panksepp, 2011), distinct from cognitive or behavioral phenomena (Pekrun and Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2014; Ryan and Deci, 2017). Defining curiosity as a basic emotion therefore acknowledges biological processes distinct from cognitively derived states that prime autonomous seeking behavior (Ainley and Hidi, 2014). For example, a study of the association between curiosity and agency found energetic engagement with novel or ambiguous situations was associated with a willingness to wait and, rather than being given the right answer, a preference for hints that allow a correct solution to be found through one\u2019s own effort (Metcalfe et al., 2021). Findings of a direct association between curiosity and volitional effort highlights the importance of considering how the experience of curiosity and other basic emotions is associated with teachers\u2019 agency, complementary to research focused on cognitive appraisals giving rise to complex emotions that in turn influence autonomous behaviors (Schutz et al., 2007; Braniecka et al., 2014; Frenzel, 2014; Pekrun and Perry, 2014; Feldman-Barrett, 2017)."

            "heading": "Motivation for the current study",
            "text": "As the preceding review makes clear, we recognize reciprocal causality between various constructs that interact in complex dynamic systems to give rise to teachers\u2019 agency. Crucially, the current study diverges from the existing literature in one key way, namely in how the complex processes that we examine are related. As illustrated in Figures 1A,B, existing theories typically begin with cognitive constructs when describing routes to the experience and enactment of agency, viewing emotion as either an experience that results from behavior (Figure 1A) or as a way of influencing behavioral outcomes (Figure 1B). Whilst we would not disagree that both viewpoints provide a useful way of understanding emotion, here we offer a distinctly different perspective. Specifically, the research reported in the current paper aims to examine the role that emotions play in the generation and enactment of agentic behavior (Figure 1C), viewing emotion as a driver of cognition and behavior, rather than simply an outcome (Damasio, 2006).\nIn addition to exploring how curiosity might relate to the initiation of agency in teachers, we considered that other emotions may also influence teachers\u2019 expression of agency, given earlier reports of a role for unspecified \u201cstrong\u201d emotions in education (e.g., Danvers, 2015; Tillmanns, 2019). Indeed, we consider the lack of both empirical research and theory development about the role of emotions in teaching to be surprising given the prevalence of emotions in the classroom (Pekrun and Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2014). Consequently, we address the question of how teachers report the experience of emotions in the classroom by exploring the following hypotheses:\n\u2022 Teachers report experiencing agency in the course of their professional lives. \u2022 Teachers experience a range of emotions that influence their expression of agency during teaching, incorporating a small number of distinct emotions including, but not limited to, curiosity. \u2022 Individual differences in the profile of teachers\u2019 emotional experiences are reflected in the number and proportion of emotions observed."

Here we propose an alternative framework emphasizing routes to action that begin with emotion (C).\nteachers\u2019 agency, particularly their capability to design and deliver flexible curricula aligned with the needs of their school and classroom. The Curriculum for Excellence prioritizes outcomes in the form of children and young people becoming successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors rather than focusing on specific curriculum content (Hedge and MacKenzie, 2016). Critics have, however, identified incongruity between declarations of support for teacher agency, and subsequent narrow definitions of expected experiences and outcomes that promote compliance at odds with teachers\u2019 autonomy (Priestley et al., 2015).\nFollowing a decade of ongoing curriculum change then, participants in the current study faced specific challenges as schools abruptly closed, with teaching and learning redirected to online channels with immediate effect (Swinney, 2020). Sudden fundamental changes in teaching practices, and concern over their own and others\u2019 wellbeing, meant unparalleled challenges to teachers\u2019 roles as educators. Increased opportunities to exercise agency therefore arose from the need to develop innovative practices to augment or replace previously dominant approaches (Tsui et al., 2020), while the resultant upheaval was assumed to elicit a range of emotions and beliefs in relation to their own and their students\u2019 unprecedented experiences (Narayanan and Ordynans, 2022). Teachers were uniquely placed to articulate their experiences of agency, motivation and internal emotional landscape since they are assumed to be reflective practitioners in their professional role as change agents for learners (GTCS, 2020).\nThirteen teachers were recruited using opportunistic sampling through an advertisement on professional support groups on Facebook whose members were primarily teachers in Scottish secondary schools (serving 12\u201318-year-olds). Secondary teachers were targeted since, as well as sharing challenges with teachers of other stages, they faced additional issues in respect of students scheduled to take crucial external exams in the near future. Potential participants contacting\nthe lead author were provided with a participant information sheet giving details of what was required, inclusion criteria, and a consent form.

Consent forms were either returned prior to the interview, or acknowledged and verbally agreed to at the start of the interview. All interviews were conducted between April and June 2020. The authors analyzed developing themes as each interview concluded and determined that data saturation was reached when analyses no longer introduced new themes, although rich data was still being found (Guest et al., 2016).

Recordings and all subsequent files used for analysis were stored securely in line with data security and retention guidance issued by the University of St. Andrews.\nSince the scope of the current study extended to at least two complex phenomena, we adopted a transdisciplinary integrative approach to defining aims, selecting the unit of analysis, and selecting research methods (Hiver et al., 2022). Our aims were twofold: to investigate whether agency and curiosity were reported by our participants, as has been previously reported, and to explore whether other emotions were reported as relevant to participants\u2019 professional lives.\nThe primary unit of analysis was individual interviews, with additional analysis conducted to confirm thematic findings by comparing individuals\u2019 responses. Individual transcription files were analyzed using six phase thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006, 2013) to identify common and repeated emergent themes. Initial codes and themes were generated using a combined deductive/inductive approach aligned with phases 1\u20133 of Braun and Clarke\u2019s approach. The deductive component arose from a priori assumptions that (a) teachers would report feelings of curiosity related to opportunities arising from recent novel circumstances, and (b) teachers would report behaviors that demonstrate their experience of professional agency. Inductive analysis was driven by interest in what other psychological phenomena, particularly emotions, would emerge from the data (Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2006). For phase 4, the first author and two independent coders met to discuss initial findings from the first six interviews, and reached\nagreement on theme descriptions, numbers and codes. The first author and one coder each then separately coded a transcript. During analysis, coders recognized that the same utterance could refer to more than one emotion and agreed that multiple codes should be assigned where relevant. Assigned codes matched in 87% of instances. A similar exercise with a second transcript and the second coder resulted in 85% agreement on codes assigned, indicating a high level of consistency in interpreting participants\u2019 meaning. The first author completed coding on the remainder of the transcripts. Subsequent meetings between coders, and between all authors further clarified emergent themes, definitions and names of themes (phase 5). The final phase is addressed in the findings reported below (Braun and Clarke, 2013). In addition to textual analysis, we reference examples where gestures added to the communication of emotion states (Hostetter, 2011). Although we recognize the limitations of a tool initially aimed at biomedicine and health services (Buus and Perron, 2020), and the risk of formulaic interpretation of qualitative data (LaMarre and Chamberlain, 2022), nevertheless the Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) served as a valuable guideline for including relevant methodological detail in reporting findings (Tong et al., 2007, Supplementary Appendix 2)."

We identified four subthemes related to the experience of agency and four themes related to distinct emotions. An a priori assumption that teachers would report behaving with agency was supported. Examples of participants\u2019 expressions of agency are shown in Table 1, highlighting the dominance of adaptability as a sub-theme. The first three examples of agency in Table 1 exemplify adaptability at strategic, tactical and operational levels, respectively. Heather reported previously making a strategic decision when she seized an opportunity to leave a career in financial services and retrain as a teacher; Amanda made tactical efforts to change her behavior so that she continued to perform as an effective teacher; and Sheila described a specific circumstance in which she chose an unprecedented course of action (Greer, 1991; Goi, 2018).\nBesides adaptability, themes of collective agency, constrained agency, and non-action are also illustrated in Table 1. Collective agency was illustrated by participants\u2019 choices to engage in collaborative efforts such as subdividing large tasks among colleagues and then sharing results for the greater good of their students, colleagues, and themselves (Bandura, 2016). The agency shown by Emily was distinct from other participants in that, having perceived that there were no \u201cgood\u201d choices open to her, she expressed a desire to have had other options available (Damman and Henkens, 2017).

In contrast, George\u2019s decision not to take a job offer was a deliberate response after considering the opportunity offered, his future goals, potential alternatives, and his emotional \u201cgut\u201d response. His decision informs our proposed extension to Sherman and Teemant\u2019s definition of agency in that his inaction was not accidental, unknowing, unwitting, nor unwilling (2021). We therefore propose an addendum to include intentional inaction as a possible expression of agency.\nThematic analysis also confirmed the a priori assumption that curiosity would be identified as a motivating emotion that underpinned agentic behavior. Crucially, a posteriori themes of care, cooperation and challenge also emerged. For the purposes of disambiguation, subsequent references will be to CURIOSITY, CARE, COOPERATION, and CHALLENGE, following the convention of using block capitals to distinguish themes related to emotions as descriptions of perceptual experience, and not simply lexical entities (Montag and Panksepp, 2017). We\nprefer the term percept over concept since percepts incorporate multiple modalities including thinking about and experiencing bodily feelings, and exhibiting actions associated with or exemplifying emotions.\nFor each participant, the number of utterances related to emotion was tallied, with subtotals calculated for each percept (Table 2), demonstrating considerable variation in the number of utterances. Nine participants made most utterances related to CARE, one made most utterances about CURIOSITY, and two made the same number of utterances related to CURIOSITY and CARE. The highest proportions of utterances were Gregory\u2019s 55% related to CARE and Emily\u2019s 55% related to CHALLENGE.

For example, participants reported that changing circumstances had provided opportunities to pursue longstanding interests in practices, tools and technologies that they had previously never acted on, suggesting a direct link between CURIOSITY and acting with agency. Perhaps surprisingly given our a priori hypothesis about the important role of emotion, CURIOSITY was the dominant percept for only one participant, with considerable variability in its reported frequency (Table 2).\nThe most prevalent emotion reported was CARE, which was the most frequently noted percept for nine of the thirteen participants, suggesting a key role for CARE in motivating teachers\u2019 agency. Indeed, Heather suggested this was the primary reason most teachers enter the profession. A variety of behavior was enacted in response to feelings of CARE, including presenting students with small physical tokens, some of which were practical (such as delivering jotters and pens to students\u2019 homes), while others were symbolic (such as crocheted hearts). Other demonstrations of CARE included shifting the workday to support students working in the evenings, reassuring students of teachers\u2019 high levels of availability, offering words of encouragement, and expressing recognition of students\u2019 individuality and uniqueness. In addition, both Heather and Amanda made expansive embracing gestures, hugging themselves and \u201cvirtually\u201d hugging the interviewer via their cameras, in indication of how much they missed and valued physical contact with learners.\nWith one exception, participants reported experiencing COOPERATION as warm feelings toward colleagues. Participants valued companionship, camaraderie and distraction provided by belonging to communities experiencing similar circumstances and with comparable goals. As well as explicit emotional support, participants recognized that sharing materials and practices also contributed to their emotional wellbeing, whether as net contributors or net beneficiaries. Another association between emotion and the experience of agency can be seen in Heather\u2019s reporting of valuing her school\u2019s focus on \u201crelationships and building those relationships and giving teachers agency to do things\u201d since \u201cif we get the relationships right then other things will follow from there.\u201d Here Heather directly links COOPERATION, with \u201cdoing things,\u201d distinguishing between the emotional feeling and collective agency in action. Uniquely, the participant who reported having no professional community, either within her school or beyond, demonstrated poor emotional wellbeing. We will shortly consider the distinct circumstances reported by Emily.\nAll participants reported having to cope with CHALLENGE arising from their prevailing circumstances. Being unable to be physically present with students and colleagues was often experienced as distressing but was also clearly associated with agentic behavior (Sepulveda-Escobar and Morrison, 2020). Participants acknowledged emotional discomfort arising from their circumstances, then offered examples of innovative ways in which they had attempted to mitigate\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\ntheir difficulties through, for example, exploiting previously underutilized communication channels to make connections and share experiences with empathetic colleagues. Whilst most of our participants reported relatively few experiences of CHALLENGE despite the sudden disruption to their professional and personal lives, in one case CHALLENGE was dominant. Uniquely, 55% of Emily\u2019s speech was focused on CHALLENGE, particularly emphasizing that she felt she was not coping, compared with others\u2019 range of between 4 and 35%. Emily\u2019s self-reported mental wellbeing was also notably poor, possibly as a result of the difficulties she was experiencing. She criticized herself (using \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly\u201d), her students who she felt were not engaging appropriately, unsupportive colleagues, and senior management who she felt imposed unrealistic demands.\nHaving noted earlier how COOPERATION and agency align, here we identify another example of a link between emotion and agency. Emily reported both high levels of CHALLENGE and low levels of COOPERATION and CURIOSITY, indicating potential combinations of specific emotions, as well as links between emotions and her constrained agency. Conversely, more adaptability in agency may result from experiencing permutations of emotions that create recognizable opportunities to act in novel ways. For example, Gregory exemplified the experience of combinations of emotions when he reported CURIOSITY-driven development of expertise in creating videos that he subsequently shared online. He expressed \u201ca lot of satisfaction that something I spent a lot of time doing for my students (CARE) is actually having a wider benefit for the teaching community (COOPERATION).\u201d\nAlthough presented above as distinct themes, the combination of multiple emotions and rapid switching between them was also notable, suggesting that the different percepts are typically experienced in combination or at least in rapid succession, and that emotional complexity and variation is the norm. We found support for the hypothesis that a combination of emotions influences teachers\u2019 expression of agency and that there are individual differences in the profile of emotions teachers experience. Evidence of the fundamental nature of these differences was identifiable particularly in relation to CURIOSITY and CARE focused individuals. Quotations from two participants exemplify the distinction between the two:\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had an enquiring mind and a desire to, to improve what I\u2019m doing but also just enquiring about the subjects that I\u2019m teaching. I\u2019m curious about mathematics, and I\u2019m curious about how to then compare the two, mathematics and people. . . I want (students) to have those moments of discovery and to facilitate that. . . I always say to my pupils, you may never be passionate about maths but by the time you leave school I want you to be able to say, I know at least one person who is.\u201d (Gregory).\nand,\n\u201cWhen I started my teacher training (the lecturer) said \u2018If you\u2019re here because you. . . can\u2019t wait to impart your love of Shakespeare to the young people. . . you\u2019re here for the wrong reason. If you\u2019re here because you like young people, because you like making connections with young people, you\u2019re in the right place.\u2019 And I remember thinking, thank goodness for that, I might even be able to do this after all. I think most teachers are the same. Some of them it\u2019s very much about the love of their subject but most of us it\u2019s just about people.\u201d (Heather).\nEach quotation indicates an important role for emotions, respectively CURIOSITY and CARE, in teachers\u2019 professional motivation. Whilst all participants demonstrated each percept (Table 2), indicating that all four are relevant for each of our teachers, they were reported in highly variable proportions (illustrated in Figure 2), suggesting distinct individual differences in the ways that participants experience and act on emotions associated with their professional life (see Table 3 for more exemplars)."

Thematic analysis of interview transcriptions confirmed assumptions related to professional agency that teachers would take volitional action in response to prevailing exigencies. We identified four sub-themes of agency: adaptability, collective agency, constrained agency, and inaction. We found evidence in support of the assumption that teachers would report feelings of CURIOSITY in respect of their professional lives, and we identified three other emotion percepts participants reported as important to their commitment as teachers, these were CARE, COOPERATION and CHALLENGE. Further, we found that the four emotions were experienced in different proportions between individuals, and that they were frequently reported together.\nContemporary approaches to teaching reform such as Scotland\u2019s Curriculum for Excellence emphasize the role of teachers in developing and delivering content in the context of their unique classroom situations in a climate of reflexivity and cooperation between classroom practitioners exercising their professional agency (cf. Scottish Executive, 2006a). In emphasizing flexibility and adaptability, contemporary teaching approaches aim to exploit the complexity arising from individual differences in teachers\u2019 attributes, knowledge and experience, rather than imposing uniformity on teaching practice. To date, however, exploration of individual differences in teachers\u2019 basic emotions and their experience and expression of agency has been limited. The current study demonstrates teachers acting with agency in response to the unprecedented\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\ncircumstances unfolding at the time the interviews were conducted, and highlights the relevance of basic emotions, albeit in differing proportions, in achieving that agency.\nThe project to explore emotions relevant to teachers\u2019 experience of agency was conceived before the start of the pandemic, and it is evident that the challenges arising from the unprecedented circumstances impacted the results we found. Practically, teachers had to deal with pupils who lacked digital connections required for remote learning. Socially, they were supporting those living in poverty in inadequate housing. Emotionally, they were addressing mental health difficulties in themselves and their learners (Moss et al., 2021). The prevalence of CARE toward learners in the circumstances prevailing at the time of data collection is perhaps unsurprising given teachers\u2019 pastoral role in supporting student wellbeing and the considerable threat to mental health resulting from the experience of a pandemic. Although data about teachers\u2019 responses to the pandemic are still scarce, a recent survey found an association between teachers\u2019 wellbeing and the support they felt from friends, colleagues and senior management (Connor et al., 2022). This association aligns with our findings of the importance of teachers feeling CARED for and recognizing that they have opportunities for COOPERATION with others. It also aligns with the experience of collective agency, in which colleagues provide practical support in tackling CHALLENGING situations."

            "text": "Distinct from existing research that offers cognitive rationalizations for teacher agency such as serving society, on the basis of the current findings we make a novel proposal for four emotion percepts that influence the experience and expression of agency. Our proposal is also distinct from research exploring secondary emotions arising from appraisals of teachers own performance or that of their students by its focus on basic emotions preceding such appraisals.\nWe have reported connections between emotions and teacher agency, both of which are recognized as complex constructs. Complex systems operate on multiple levels, across different temporal scales, and are liable to be impacted in non-linear ways by myriad factors (Overton, 2014; Wilson, 2016). A corollary of recognizing an area of study as complex is acknowledging that investigating that domain solely by identifying and measuring variables will generate little insight (Lykken, 1991; Agar, 2004; Gigerenzer, 2010). Our methodological choices recognize that phenomenological and methodological issues constrain how research is conducted within and between complex and dynamic systems, and further, that there is no single effective approach to studying complex systems. Instead, research methods that recognize subtle and complex interactions that influence teachers\u2019 agency are preferable to attempting to establish categorical distinctions\nsuch as assuming that teachers are either CURIOUS or CARING or COOPERATIVE or CHALLENGED. Our open process of analysis proved particularly appropriate for identifying complex patterns of interaction between emotions and feelings of agency.\nParadoxically, complex systems can be described by a few simple rules governing how component entities interact to generate a wide range of behaviors at higher levels of the system (Wilson, 2016). The challenge is to accurately identify and describe elemental components, together with relevant rules under which they operate. In response to calls for psychology to mature as a discipline through greater theory development (Borghi and Fini, 2019), we therefore propose four theoretical rules that aim to articulate teachers\u2019 experience of agency, in particular extending existing theories that omit or downplay references to emotions (Emirbayer and Mische, 1998; Priestley et al., 2015; Aspbury-Miyanishi, 2022). The first three encapsulate results and discussions already reported above: Proposition (1) four emotion percepts of CARE, CURIOSITY, COOPERATION, and CHALLENGE substantially influence teachers\u2019 voluntary motivated behavior; Proposition (2) individual differences between teachers are reflected in the amount and proportion of emotions reported; Proposition (3) the four emotion percepts are experienced by engaged teachers concurrently or in rapid succession.\nIn recognition of the unique circumstances of heightened concern about students\u2019 wellbeing, we offer Proposition (4) prior experiences and the exigencies of the current situation influence which category of action has priority in the moment. For example, although in the current situation he expressed a greater emphasis on CARE, Gregory reported an earlier episode when he was driven by CURIOSITY to gain skills in digital learning. While proposition 3 highlights concurrency of emotions, we also recognize that proportions of each percept may change over time for an individual. For instance, a similar data-gathering exercise at another time may have seen the same participants reporting more CURIOSITY and COOPERATION, and less emphasis on CARE.\nAs well as novel theoretical propositions, we highlight three distinct features of our approach. The first is the contrast with existing theories of teacher emotions. We examined the role that emotions play in producing behaviors, in contrast with the prevailing focus on emotions that result from appraisal of actions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun et al., 2007; Frenzel, 2014; Pekrun and Perry, 2014). Other research has identified \u201cstrong\u201d emotions as relevant to educational practices (Danvers, 2015; Tillmanns, 2019), and CURIOSITY specifically has been shown to relate to outcomes (Silvia, 2008; Grossnickle, 2016). Here we have offered greater specificity about \u201cstrong\u201d emotions, presenting evidence that teacher agency can be understood as a behavioral outcome motivated by CURIOSITY, as well as three additional emotion percepts of CARE, COOPERATION, and CHALLENGE.\nThe second distinct feature of our approach is the contrast with the existing body of research focused on teachers\u2019 negative emotions, such as UK teachers reporting high levels of stress,\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nwith symptoms of poor wellbeing attributed to high workload and lack of support (Education Support, 2020). Stress leads to decreased motivation, absenteeism, poor student behavior, and lower academic achievement (Ravalier and Walsh, 2017). Particularly in Emily\u2019s case we found evidence supportive of an association between negative emotions, wellbeing, and the experience of agency. However, an inference from the focus on negative emotions (Frenzel, 2014; Pekrun and Perry, 2014) might be that these exert more influence on teachers\u2019 motivation than positive emotions. In contrast with Emily though, other participants did not report feeling overwhelmed by the CHALLENGE they were experiencing, but rather appeared able to balance the influence of positive and negatively valenced emotions in their experience of agency. Further effort to gain understanding of interactions between emotions of different valence is needed, particularly given findings that positive engagement is more conducive to favorable outcomes than punishment (Skinner, 1953; Prescott and Buchanan-Smith, 2003)."

Researchers distinguish between innate, phylogenetically developed basic emotions (Damasio, 2006) and secondary emotions characterized by the degree of cognitive processing associated with their experience (Leyens et al., 2001; Becker-Asano and Wachsmuth, 2008). For instance, the experience of enjoyment is reported as \u201cresulting from\u201d historical actions, current engagement or future anticipation (Frenzel, 2014, p. 495, italics added). Given that a consensus is unlikely to emerge anytime soon between opposing viewpoints, we limit our current position to a pragmatic proposal that the four percepts at least satisfy the categorical and psychological definitions outlined by Celeghin et al. (2017), and therefore offer potentially useful distinctions (Box, 1979). Future interdisciplinary efforts to clarify definitions, distinctions, phylogenesis and necessary and sufficient components of emotions would prove valuable. Similarly, the current paper proposes no physiological mechanisms or emotional/cognitive processes linking the four percepts with agency. A starting point could be work characterizing CURIOSITY as the inherent reward experienced when acquiring knowledge, leading to a cycle of information-seeking behavior and increasing knowledge (Murayama, 2022). We are unaware of similar work linking multiple basic emotions. In order to record relevant behavioral and physiological measures of emotion in the classroom, recent developments in cognitive neuroscience (cf. the mobile cognition approach: Ladouce et al., 2017) indicate how future studies may augment understanding by\ninclude measures such as heart rate variability or mobile EEG recordings.\nWe present a qualitative study, which remains relatively unusual in a discipline that favors self-report measures (Dinsmore et al., 2008; Dinsmore, 2017). Of course, the nature of complex systems necessarily requires dynamism and flexibility throughout the analysis process, as well as recognition that a variety of means will be needed to guard against spurious associations, lack of reproducibility and future replication failures (Wasserstein and Lazar, 2016). As psychology transitions from assumptions that behavior is purely rational, to acknowledging that motivated behavior incorporates emotion (Hall and Knapp, 2015) opportunities arise to incorporate multiple disciplinary and conceptual foci in future efforts to understand complex psychological processes. We advocate proceeding cautiously using appropriate methods to extend understanding of the impact of emotion percepts in catalyzing effective teaching. In particular, relationships between researchers and the objects of investigation need to be explicit and subject to scrutiny, with a range of methods used to improve validity and triangulation of findings.\nAlthough we have responded to ongoing encouragement to vary methodological approaches (e.g., Lykken, 1991; Borsboom et al., 2009; Gigerenzer, 2010), we recognize that single engagements with participants do not present the same opportunities to record change over time that longitudinal and ethnographic methods would have afforded (Agar, 2004; Dinsmore et al., 2008). While participants in the present study reported major recent changes, conducting subsequent studies over extended timeframes might enhance the validity of reports by allowing intraindividual comparisons of multiple observations.\nAlso related to methodological concerns, we identified instances of gesture conveying supplementary information about participants\u2019 emotional states (Hostetter, 2011). To our surprise, reporting of such additional data is often missing from relevant literature. For example, Oplatka (2012) reports only the words of teacher interviews. Similarly, although Eidsv\u00e5g and Rosell (2021) report actions, their analysis to \u201cmake sense of what we perceived was happening\u201d (p. 88) results in summary explanations such as reporting that a participant\u2019s \u201cbody language is vigorous and confident\u201d (p. 91), rather than describing specific gestures and movements. Aligned with concerns about the universality of facial expressions conveying specific emotions (Feldman-Barrett, 2017), there are concerns about the ubiquity of specific gestures communicating additional information (Hostetter, 2011) and a pressing need to develop effective coding strategies to facilitate robust interpretation of gestures. Nonetheless, we encourage the reporting of non-verbal communication and physiological measures alongside verbal responses as a way of generating richer data leading to more complete understanding.\nIt is also important to acknowledge that the current study was unable to determine the extent to which lack\nFrontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org\nof CURIOSITY, CARE, COOPERATION, and excessive CHALLENGE each influenced constrained agency. Indeed, further studies are needed to establish whether the four percepts provide a complete account of the emotional experience associated with agency. For example, it may be that teacher agency is enhanced or compromised by the experience of specific profiles of emotional percepts. We also note that although there is widespread adoption of the idea that agency is an important feature of effective teaching practice, to date there is relatively limited empirical evidence regarding how agency operates in the classroom, whether it can be developed, and how it changes with experience. Further enquiry is clearly necessary and we particularly advocate proceeding cautiously before encouraging widespread adoption of pedagogical practices that lack strong evidential support (Newton and Salvi, 2020).\nThe current study involved only teachers working in the secondary stage, giving rise to obvious opportunities to examine further questions. Do teachers in the primary stage show similar sub-themes of agency? Do tertiary-stage teachers have different experiences of basic emotions? Do teachers of different subjects have distinct differences in their basic emotions? Are there different basic emotions at work for some teachers compared to those already identified in the current paper? We also recognize the need to investigate the roles of students and the wider social context in teachers\u2019 experience of agency and the efficacy of their practices (Priestley et al., 2015). Moreover, participants in the current study volunteered their efforts at a time when teachers were experiencing unprecedented disruption. They may therefore have been unrepresentative of the profession in judging that they had capacity for additional effort, whilst others might have felt that their ongoing volume of work and personal circumstances precluded their participation. Future research should also examine effects of students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 emotions on student satisfaction, wellbeing and academic achievement (Collie et al., 2017). More broadly, work in classrooms could inform understanding about whether each of the four percepts is always necessary for teachers to experience agency, why some teachers feel overwhelmed by professional and personal circumstances affecting their work, and whether students and teachers necessarily experience interactions in the same way (for example, do teachers\u2019 expressions of CARE sometimes translate into experiences of CHALLENGE for students?) Likewise, since organizational and environmental factors affect individuals\u2019 development and enactment of agency (H\u00f6kk\u00e4 et al., 2019), pressure to achieve centrally imposed targets and increase efficiency might have significant impact on teachers\u2019 capacity to experiment with innovative practices and pedagogical resources. Since context-dependent curricula recognize teachers\u2019 individual differences and focus on their critical thinking skills and reflectivity to promote increased self-awareness (Education Scotland, 2021), increased awareness of the role of emotions in teaching may support relevant institutions in developing appropriate curricula and monitoring learning outcomes.\nCoaching focused on emotional awareness has been shown to impact the sense of personal agency experienced by managerial staff (H\u00f6kk\u00e4 et al., 2019). Adopting a similar approach using longitudinal and comparative studies would provide invaluable insights into the impact of teachers\u2019 awareness of emotion percepts on motivation, self-efficacy, engagement, behavior, and teaching outcomes (Reeve and Shin, 2020; Usher, 2021). We are optimistic about opportunities and outcomes arising from greater focus on emotions, particularly in teachers\u2019 effective modeling of emotion percepts and associated behaviors for students in the same way that they model meta-cognitive abilities (cf. Branigan and Donaldson, 2019, 2020). Partnerships between psychology and education practitioner-researchers should also encourage more nuanced development and adoption of research findings in education settings (Immordino-Yang, 2016), particularly exploring the impact and limitations of awareness of emotion percepts on pedagogical practices through collection and analysis of rich, robust data (Newton and Salvi, 2020)."

            "text": "We examined teachers\u2019 professional agency through enthusiastic and effortful commitment to adapting their behaviors as circumstances demanded, to support themselves, their colleagues and their students. We clarified existing conceptualizations of agency by identifying that teachers act adaptably at multiple levels, making strategic, tactical and operational choices, including choices not to act. We also identified constrained agency when choices felt limited, leading to action without wholehearted engagement, as well as agency operating within communities of teachers acting collectively. In questioning \u201cwhat motivates us to teach,\u201d we identified factors linked to basic emotions and proposed a novel theory that teachers\u2019 agency is substantially influenced by feelings of CARE, CURIOSITY, COOPERATION, and CHALLENGE. We also proposed that the degree to which these emotions are experienced differs between individuals, that the percepts are experienced concurrently or in rapid succession, and that circumstances influence which emotions are most influential in any situation. We distinguish basic emotions that motivate engagement in teaching from achievement emotions that result from such commitment. For example, we suggest that feelings of CARE that motivate a teacher to spending additional time with students is more basic than the pride that results from students\u2019 success at reaching goals, although the potential link between the two is evident.\nAt a time of major challenges, participants in the current study showed how dedication to their craft, students, and colleagues led them to volitional actions aimed at minimizing losses and exploiting opportunities for the perceived benefit\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org\nof each of those populations. Those concerned with whether students reliably experience supportive teaching may be reassured by our findings of highly motivated, agentic teachers. Further careful and critical consideration of the role of emotion percepts may also help educators to fine-tune responses to their own and their students\u2019 individual needs. Indeed, our view is that gaining a clearer understanding of the role that emotions play in the classroom will encourage learner-shaped education that promotes the development of agency, instead of attempting to mold compliant school-shaped learners. By listening to and observing teachers we can see that implicit awareness of emotion percepts already supports agency and good pedagogy. Our hope is that future studies will show that enhancing teachers\u2019 explicit understanding of the roles of CARE, CURIOSITY, COOPERATION, and CHALLENGE in their experience of agency will result in more great practice."
