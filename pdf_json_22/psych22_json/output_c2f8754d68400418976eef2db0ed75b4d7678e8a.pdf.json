    "abstractText": "Life satisfaction is an essential construct of well-being that is tied to behavioral, emotional, social and psychological outcomes. This study aimed to examine changes in total and domain-specific life satisfaction during the retirement transition and additionally examine whether those changes differ by gender, occupation, health and spousal working status. Aging public sector employees (n = 3543) from the Finnish Retirement and Aging Study cohort study were followed up annually before and after retirement. Total life satisfaction score (range 4\u201320) was computed by summing up the responses in four domains (interestingness, happiness, easiness and togetherness). The mean and mean change estimates and their 95% CI were calculated by using the linear regression models with generalized estimating equations, adjusted for age, gender, occupation, health and marital status. Total life satisfaction score improved among the entire study population during the retirement transition and remained stable thereafter. The improvement was greater among women versus men (gender * time interaction p = 0.004), among those with suboptimal health before retirement vs. those who had good (health * time p < 0.0001) and those who had no spouse vs. those who had a retired or working spouse (spousal-status * time p < 0.0001). In case of domain-specific life satisfaction scores, the greatest improvement was observed in the easiness domain. Life satisfaction improves during the retirement transition period, especially among women, those with suboptimal health and those living without a spouse. The improvement was considerably greater in the easiness domain than any other domains. Life satisfaction remained improved and stable during the post-retirement period.",

Life satisfaction is a key indicator of well-being that is tied to behavioral, emotional, social and psychological outcomes (Proctor et\u00a0al. 2008). Life satisfaction emphasizes an individual\u2019s ability to cope against the development of psychopathological problems and is assessed through anticipated subjective feeling (Moen 1996; Pavot and Diener 2008; Proctor et\u00a0al. 2008). Generally, happiness and achievement of good life are linked to the positive evaluations of life satisfaction, and on the contrary, unhappiness increases the tendency of negative evaluations of life satisfaction. These findings suggest that life satisfaction is a subjective evaluation of quality of life and a key component of subjective well-being (Diener and Diener, 1995). In fact, the components of subjective well-being are often synonymous to happiness and mostly used as substitutes of each other (Seligman 2002).\nPrevious studies have examined changes in life satisfaction during the retirement transition (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021; Carr et\u00a0al. 2020; Gorry et\u00a0al. 2018; Hansson et\u00a0al. 2018; Hershey and Henkens 2014; Pinquart and Schindler 2007; Weber and H\u00fcl\u00fcr 2020) showing that life satisfaction improves during the transition period. However, the previous studies have relied on a single item to measure life satisfaction. The only exception is the study by Calasanti et\u00a0al. (2021), where they studied the change in domain-specific life satisfaction (leisure, family and finance) during retirement transition using longitudinal sample drawn from the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The study reported higher improvement in life satisfaction among those who were satisfied with their financial status before retirement. This implies that the measurement of life satisfaction is a sensitive approach, and several domains of life could influence the change in life satisfaction during retirement transition. Therefore, additional use of domain-specific measures of life satisfaction is equally important.\nMoreover, the changes in life satisfaction during retirement transition in previous studies have been attributed to variations in resources and characteristics such as gender, health and marital status. According to the theory of perspective on retirement, gender and well-being, by Moen (1996), men and women who retire from their career jobs are vulnerable to feelings of role loss, which can lead to decreased mental well-being of an individual (Moen 1996). The transition to retirement can come with a different feeling for women compared to men (Kim and Moen 2002; Price and Joo 2005) as women may come to retirement with lower level of personal control than men (Kim and Moen 2002). However, the process of retirement may represent reduction in role strain and gain in time resources in case of both genders. Previous studies have reported gender difference in changes in well-being\nduring retirement transition (Butterworth et\u00a0al. 2006; Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021; Coursolle et\u00a0al. 2010; Kim and Moen 2002; Poto\u010dnik et\u00a0al. 2013). The improvement in life satisfaction during the retirement transition (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021), emotional well-being (Coursolle et\u00a0al. 2010) and psychological well-being (Kim and Moen 2002) has been reported higher among men compared to the improvement among women. However, there is lack of studies that have considered gender difference in life satisfaction during the retirement transition.\nFurthermore, previous studies have also attributed the improvement in life satisfaction during the retirement transition to the financial resources (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021; Carr et\u00a0al. 2020; Weber and H\u00fcl\u00fcr 2020). A stronger improvement has been reported among the retirees who were financially stable. However, there is lack of studies considering the role of occupation, one of the important proxies for financial stability (Galobardes et\u00a0al. 2006). Therefore, we want to expand the previous literature by investigating differences in life satisfaction during the retirement transition based on occupation.\nHealth status is likewise reported to be the significant predictor of life satisfaction among the older adults (Camacho et\u00a0al. 2019; Dumitrache et\u00a0al. 2017; Gana et\u00a0al. 2013), and there is a two-way association between physical health and subjective well-being such as life satisfaction (Steptoe et\u00a0al. 2015). Previous studies have reported small or no change in self-rated health during the transition to retirement (Mein et\u00a0al. 2003; Stenholm et\u00a0al. 2020), while few other studies have reported an improvement (Majer et\u00a0al. 2011; Westerlund et\u00a0al. 2009). However, the role of health status in life satisfaction during the retirement transition is still unclear.\nMoreover, family relationships such as marital status and spousal working status may influence on life satisfaction during retirement years because the retirement transition process is crucial event in life that requires necessary adjustments in part of both spouses (Kim and Moen 2002). According to the theory of interdependence of linked lives during the life transitions, the retirement transition process has been conceptualized also as a relational transition (Kim and Moen 2001). Further, the role of employment status of partners and involvement in family and marital roles has been further emphasized as an integral aspect affecting the process of retirement transition by previous studies (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021; Price and Joo 2005; Weber and H\u00fcl\u00fcr 2020; Zang 2020). Previous studies considering the family relationship status reported that the satisfaction with life (Price and Joo 2005) and psychological well-being (Kim and Moen 2002) among married women improved more compared to single women during the retirement transition. Likewise, increased life satisfaction was reported among both retirees and their partners (Weber and H\u00fcl\u00fcr 2020). What is currently lacking in the literature is how spousal working\n1 3\nstatus influences on life satisfaction during the retirement transition.\nTo address the gaps in the literature, the aim of this longitudinal study was to examine changes in total and domainspecific life satisfaction during the retirement transition period. The domain-specific changes were examined in terms of personal feelings in relation to interestingness, happiness, easiness and togetherness. We additionally examined whether the change in total and domain-specific life satisfaction was dependent on pre-retirement characteristics that are known to associate with life satisfaction such as gender, occupations, self-rated health and spousal working status.\nWe build our hypothesis based on findings from previous empirical studies. We hypothesize, first, that life satisfaction (total and domain-specific) increases during the retirement transition period and the increase is higher among men than among women (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021). Life could get easy, and retirees may feel content with their life to execute new roles (Kim and Moen 2001). Previous studies have also reported higher overall well-being among men than among women during retirement transition (Kim and Moen 2001). Second, we hypothesize that the individuals in occupation that require high skill have higher improvement in life satisfaction than among those in occupations that require low skills as previous studies have reported a stronger improvement among those with better financial status during retirement (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021). Third, we hypothesize that the change in life satisfaction during retirement transition depends on pre-retirement health status so that those having poorer health improve more because of short-term easiness and removal of work-related stress after retirement (Gana et\u00a0al. 2013). Fourth, we hypothesize that the changes of an individual\u2019s life satisfaction during retirement transition also depend on working status of their spouse during retirement, because retirement transition period has been conceptualized as a relational transition by theory of interdependence of linked lives (Kim and Moen 2002)."

The eligible population of the FIREA study was employees whose individual retirement date was between 2014 and 2019 and who were working in the year 2012 in one of the 27 municipalities in southwest Finland or in the nine selected cities or five hospital districts across Finland.\nParticipants were first contacted 18\u00a0months prior to their estimated individual pensionable age, obtained from the institute for public sector pensions in Finland, by sending a questionnaire, and the follow-up questionnaire was sent annually. The participants responded on average 4.3 (SD 0.8) times to the surveys. Informed consent was obtained from the participants, the ethics committee of Hospital district of Southwest Finland approved the study, and the FIREA study was conducted in line with the declaration of Helsinki.\nBy the end of 2019, in total 6,783 of the FIREA cohort members (64% of the eligible sample, n = 10,629) had responded to at least one questionnaire. This study is comprised of two possible study waves before retirement (wave \u2212 2, wave \u2212 1) and three possible waves after retirement (wave + 1, wave + 2, wave + 3) with each successive wave one year apart from each other. To be eligible for the analytical sample of the study cohort, the participants needed to have answered to the life satisfaction questionnaire in waves before (wave \u2212 1) and after retirement (wave + 1) (n = 3543). The description of pre-retirement, retirement transition and post-retirement period with annual study waves and the study design are presented in eTable 1. The selected participants provided information on total life satisfaction at an average of 3.8 (SD 0.6) of the possible five study waves. There were no major differences in terms of background characteristics between the final analytical sample and the eligible population (83% vs 80% of women).\nTiming of\u00a0retirement for\u00a0Finnish public sector employees\nIn Finland, the Public Sector Pensions Act regulates the retirement ages of the public sector employees. From 2005 onward, public sector employees can retire on a statutory basis after aged 63\u00a0years but at the latest before the age of 68\u00a0years. Following a pension reform in January 2017, each age group has their own retirement age, which is tied to the life expectancy, although the general rule of 63 to 68\u00a0years still applies. However, some public sector employees have chosen to keep their earlier retirement age from the previous pension act in which pension ages in some occupations were below 63\u00a0years (e.g., 60\u00a0years for primary school teachers, 58 for practical nurses). The institute for public sector pensions in Finland (Keva) has calculated an individual pensionable date for each employee accordingly. Postponing retirement from this date will accrue pension income level. (El\u00e4keturvakeskus 2017). The average retirement age in this sample was 63.8\u00a0years (Standard deviation, 1.2)."

There were five response alternatives, and separate ratings for each response were given, partly following procedure used in the previous study (Koivumaa-Honkanen et\u00a0al. 2000). The original responses and re-ordering of responses is described in detail in eTable 2.\nThe total life satisfaction score was computed by summing up the responses in four domains of life satisfaction. The sum score ranged from 4 to 20, with increasing values indicating improved life satisfaction. To harmonize the scores used in our study, the name of the domain \u201cloneliness\u201d has been renamed to \u201ctogetherness\u201d henceforth. If the response was missing for three or four domains, the sum score of total life satisfaction was treated as missing. In addition, we used domain-specific life satisfaction information and the domain-specific scores ranged from 1 to 5 with increasing values indicating improved domain-specific life satisfaction. The calculation of life satisfaction based on these four domains was validated and used in a previous study (Koivumaa-Honkanen et\u00a0al. 2000)."

Before the retirement transition, the mean age of the study population was 63.4\u00a0years (standard deviation 1.4). The occupational titles of the last occupation preceding retirement were coded according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08). We classified occupations according to the broad skill levels in three categories: skill levels 3 and 4 (ISCO-08 classes 1\u20133: e.g., managers, professionals), skill level 2 (ISCO-08 classes 4\u20138: e.g., clerical support workers, service sale workers) and skill level 1 (ISCO-08 class 9: elementary occupations) (International Labour Organization, 2008). As there were very few people in skill level 1, we merged skill level 1 and skill level 2 that makes it two occupational categories (high: skill level 3 and 4 and low: skill level 1 and 2) for the analytical purpose. The other pre-retirement characteristics were obtained from the survey preceding retirement (wave \u2212 1). Marital status was originally collected in five categories (never married, cohabitation, married, divorced or separated and widowed), and in order to use in this study, it was dichotomized into currently married/cohabiting (yes)\nand non-married/non-cohabiting (no). Spousal working status was created based on the marital status of respondents (wave \u2212 1), working status of their spouses one year before retirement (wave \u2212 1) and working status of their spouses one year after retirement (wave + 1). We created three categories of spousal working status namely \u201cNo spouse: never married, divorced or separated and widowed,\u201d \u201cWorking (-1, + 1): spouse working full time at both time points (wave \u2212 1) and (wave + 1)\u201d and \u201cRetired (\u2212 1, + 1): spouse retired at both time points (wave \u2212 1) and (wave + 1).\u201d\nSelf-rated health was assessed by asking participant to rate their overall health status on a 5-point scale (1\u2014\u201cgood,\u201d 2\u2014\u201crather good,\u201d 3\u2014\u201caverage,\u201d 4\u2014\u201crather poor\u201d and 5\u2014\u201cpoor\u201d).

The advantages of using the GEEs over other contemporary models is that GEEs are not sensitive to measurements missing completely at random and control for the intra-individual correlation between repeated measurements using an exchangeable correlation structure (Diggle et\u00a0al. 1994; Zeger et\u00a0al. 1988).\nTo study changes in total and domain-specific life satisfaction during retirement transition, we created retirement transition period from wave \u2212 1 to wave + 1 corresponding approximately 0.5\u00a0years before and 0.5\u00a0years after retirement. The change in total and domain-specific life satisfaction during retirement transition period (wave \u2212 1 to wave + 1) is presented as mean change and their 95% CI.

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective studies examining changes in both total and domain-specific life satisfaction across the retirement transition. Life satisfaction in general improved during the retirement transition and stabilized thereafter. Likewise, there was an improvement in interestingness, easiness and happiness domains of life satisfaction during the retirement transition, whereas the togetherness domain remained constant. During the transition to retirement, life satisfaction improved more among women, among those with suboptimal self-rated health and among those who had no spouse with a small effect size. The improvement was greater in the easiness domain of life satisfaction than other domains, and it was greater for those with suboptimal health than for those with good health and greater for those having no spouse than for those having spouse irrespective of their spouse\u2019s working status.\nOur findings are in agreement with the previous longitudinal studies suggesting that life satisfaction improves during the retirement transition (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021; Carr et\u00a0al. 2020; Gorry et\u00a0al. 2018; Hershey and Henkens 2014; Weber and H\u00fcl\u00fcr 2020). An advantage of our study over the previous studies is the investigation of annual change in life satisfaction using the measures of both total and domain-specific life satisfaction scores. The domain-specific changes were examined in terms of personal feelings in relation to interestingness, happiness, easiness and togetherness, whereas previous study using the HRS cohort from the US examined life satisfaction in terms of leisure, family and finance (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021). In addition, the study population in our study was relatively homogenous compared to heterogeneous study populations in most of the previous studies. Homogeneity in the study population minimizes and controls for selection bias. Further, we studied the changes based on several individual and circumstantial factors such as gender, occupational status, self-rated health and spousal working status. Most of the observed changes in life satisfaction during retirement transition were marginal, and the effect size for change was small because the life satisfaction\n1 3\nwas already at quite high level among our study participants before retirement. However, a small difference could be considered better and meaningful than no difference in terms of effect size if it is presented as standardized mean difference (Andrade 2020).\nThe consideration of individual factor such as gender is important to understand the effects of retirement on life satisfaction (Kim and Moen 2002; Price and Joo 2005). We found firstly, that although both men and women had similar levels of life satisfaction before retirement and both had an improvement in their life satisfaction scores during the retirement transition, life satisfaction among women increased more than among men. However, Calasanti et\u00a0al. (2021) reported in their study a greater improvement in life satisfaction among men than among women during the retirement transition. Although the retirement ages were rather similar between our and their study (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021), our study was larger and female-dominated compared to their study, which hinders comparability of these two studies.\nPrevious studies have attributed the improvement in life satisfaction during the retirement transition to financial resources (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021; Carr et\u00a0al. 2020; Weber and H\u00fcl\u00fcr 2020). Kim & Moen (2002) used the cohort from US in their study and reported the important role of financial situation for the changes in well-being during the retirement transition (Kim and Moen 2002). Similarly, the improved life satisfaction among men compared to women during the transition period was associated with lower financial satisfaction among women in the HRS cohort (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021). In addition, retirees with higher financial resources reported improved life satisfaction in a study of nationally representative sample of German households (Weber and H\u00fcl\u00fcr 2020). Likewise, another study using the HRS cohort reported that financially vulnerable retirees were more likely to report decreased life satisfaction during the retirement transition compared to their financially rich and stable counterparts (Carr et\u00a0al. 2020). We considered occupation as a proxy for financial status and examined differences in life satisfaction between occupations categorized according to broad skill level. We found that those in high-skill level were more satisfied before retirement; however, the improvement in life satisfaction during the retirement transition was similar in both high- and low-skill level occupations. These results are in contrast with the previous findings where retirees with higher financial resources reported improved life satisfaction during retirement transition (Hershey and Henkens 2014). These differences may be due to the lack of direct measurement of financial resources in our study. However, a decline in financial status could come as a contextual change during the retirement transition (Hershey and Henkens 2014), resource-rich individuals are less likely to experience retirement-related changes (Pinquart and Schindler\n2007), and the level of satisfaction could differ based on the type of retirement.\nSince health status may influence life satisfaction (Camacho et\u00a0al. 2019; Dumitrache et\u00a0al. 2017; Gana et\u00a0al. 2013; Steptoe et\u00a0al. 2015), we were interested in investigating the change in life satisfaction during the transition period based on self-rated health before retirement, which was found to be an important explanatory factor of life satisfaction. In line with the previous study (Gana et\u00a0al. 2013), we found life satisfaction was higher among those with good self-rated health than among those with suboptimal self-rated health throughout the follow-up period. However, the improvement in life satisfaction during the retirement transition period was greater among those with suboptimal self-rated health than among those with good self-rated health before retirement. Since retirement comes as a relief from work-related stress and more easiness (Atchley RC 1976), the people with poor health feel more satisfied with their life and tend to improve more in their life satisfaction levels compared to their healthier counterparts who already have a quite higher level of life satisfaction before retirement.\nFurther, the importance of spousal working status during retirement transition has been highlighted by previous studies (Calasanti et\u00a0al. 2021; Kim and Moen 2002), which motivated us to study the change in life satisfaction during retirement transition by spousal working status. A previous study focused on spousal working status as a predictor of change in well-being during retirement transition and found that there was no difference in well-being depending on spousal working status (Kim and Moen 2002). Similar to the findings from the previous study (Kim and Moen 2002), we did not find any difference in change in life satisfaction based on spousal working status. However, life satisfaction among those who had no spouse remained lower than among those who had spouse throughout the follow-up period, which is consistent with the previous finding (Price and Joo 2005). Moreover, the improvement in life satisfaction during the retirement transition period was greater among those who had no spouse than among married/ cohabiting respondents with different spousal working status. The improvement in life satisfaction was discontinued thereafter, and it was constant during the post-retirement period. This could be explained by the fact that retirement comes with short-term easiness as life satisfaction improves during the retirement transition process, and it remains constant during post-retirement phase as a person adapts the new situation.\nRegarding the domain-specific findings of our study, more marked improvement was observed in the easiness domain than among other domains, partly explained by the feeling of easiness as a person nears the retirement period (Atchley RC 1976; Kim and Moen 2001). Most of the observed changes in our study were stable, as the improved life satisfaction during the transition phase remained during\n1 3\nthe post-retirement phase. During the retirement transition period, the retirees may feel content with their life with an increased level of energy to execute the new roles in society and to plan desired activities in post-retirement life, which could be attributed to the concept of \u201choneymoon phase\u201d (Atchley RC 1976). Moreover, the retirees may be relieved from the pressure of the jobs, and they could enjoy the shortterm well-being as a part of retirement relief that could be partly related to the role strain hypothesis (Kim and Moen 2001, 2002). The removal of work-related schedules as well as physical and psychosocial work stressors (e.g., strenuous working conditions, high demands, low appreciation) and availability of more sleeping time (Myllyntausta et\u00a0al. 2017) come with retirement. In addition, there are more opportunities and time to be involved in leisure activities and other social activities after retirement (Heaney et\u00a0al. 2014; Henning et\u00a0al. 2021; Stenholm et\u00a0al. 2016; Vigezzi et\u00a0al. 2021). Thus, retirement may be experienced as a gain and relief, and this may be reflected as an increased feelings of easiness during the transition to retirement. Moreover, we and others have shown earlier that psychological distress decreases (Lahdenper\u00e4 et\u00a0al. 2022) and self-rated health improves (Stenholm et\u00a0al. 2021; Westerlund et\u00a0al. 2009) after retirement transition, which could partly explain increased easiness among those who had suboptimal self-rated health before retirement in our study. Further, part of our findings could be explained by the financial aspects as the earned accrued pension rights in Finland offers relatively rewarding pension schemes for Finnish old-age pensioners (El\u00e4keturvakeskus 2017; Palom\u00e4ki et\u00a0al. 2022). However, this question was not examined in the current study.\nThe major strength of this study is the use of repeated yearly measurements for a comprehensive period among a relatively homogenous working population over the transition to statutory retirement. The availability of information on actual retirement age is another strength of this study. When first contacted, all the respondents were still in employment, which partly controlled for health-related selection bias.\nThe dependence on self-rated life satisfaction scores could be a subject to bias and estimation error in ratings; however, life satisfaction is an indicator of a general wellbeing assessed through anticipated subjective feeling of an individual (Moen 1996), and self-rated items are the only means to measure subjective feelings such as wellbeing and life satisfaction. Moreover, as we used repeated measurements, the participant served as their own controls, effectively controlling for individual differences in response style. The other possible limitation of this study is that we calculated the total life satisfaction score based on domain-specific scores, and we were not able to control the simultaneity of domain-specific life satisfaction, which could have resulted in slight overestimation of total\nlife satisfaction score. However, this way of calculation of total life satisfaction has been previously validated and used (Koivumaa-Honkanen et\u00a0al. 2000; Korpim\u00e4ki et\u00a0al. 2012). Likewise, the information on domain-specific life satisfaction in each of the five study waves were gathered using the same questionnaire.\nFurthermore, the study population of this study is a representative sample of public sector employees in Finland; therefore, the findings may not necessarily be generalizable to other sectors. In addition, the results should be cautiously generalized to male workers, since majority of our participants were women. However, the gender distribution in our study (83% women) is typical in Finnish public sector occupations in recent decades as 78% of people working in public sectors are women (Statistics Finland 2016)."
