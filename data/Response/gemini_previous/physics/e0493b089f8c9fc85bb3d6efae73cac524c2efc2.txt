1. **Investigate the role of the SGOC pathway in MDSC differentiation and function.**
   - How does activation of the SGOC pathway contribute to MDSC generation and immunosuppressive activity?
   - Can targeting the SGOC pathway inhibit MDSC development or function?


2. **Explore the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and MDSC maturation.**
   - How does impaired mitochondrial function affect MDSC differentiation and maturation?
   - Can interventions that improve mitochondrial function promote MDSC maturation and reduce their immunosuppressive activity?


3. **Study the role of GLUT1 overexpression in MDSC metabolism and function.**
   - How does GLUT1 overexpression contribute to the high glucose concentration and altered metabolism observed in MDSCs?
   - Can targeting GLUT1 inhibit MDSC generation or function?


4. **Investigate the effects of a hyperglycemic environment on MDSC differentiation and function.**
   - How does a high glucose concentration influence MDSC generation, differentiation, and immunosuppressive activity?
   - Can modulating glucose metabolism in the tumor microenvironment impact MDSC activity and anti-tumor immune responses?


5. **Explore the potential of targeting MDSC metabolism for cancer immunotherapy.**
   - Can inhibitors of the SGOC pathway, GLUT1, or other key metabolic enzymes in MDSCs enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy?
   - Can modulating MDSC metabolism improve the response to immune checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapeutic approaches?
