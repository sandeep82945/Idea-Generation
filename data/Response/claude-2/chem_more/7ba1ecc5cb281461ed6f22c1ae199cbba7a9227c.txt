 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore new methods to synthesize single-layer or few-layer MoS2 with more defects and high surface area. This could further enhance the number of active sites and catalytic performance.

2. Investigate the synergistic effect between different metal promoters (e.g. Co, Ni, Pt) and defect-rich MoS2. The metal-vacancy interface may provide new insights into designing efficient catalysts. 

3. Develop in-situ characterization techniques to study the dynamic structure changes of active sites during the HDO reactions. This can help understand the deactivation mechanism.

4. Design novel catalysts with bifunctional sites for hydrogenation and deoxygenation. This may allow tuning selectivity and activity.

5. Explore more economical and earth-abundant transition metal dopants (e.g. Fe, Cu) to replace noble metals like Pt while maintaining high performance.
