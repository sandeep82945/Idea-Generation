 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct clinical trials in patients with malignant brain tumors using myxoma virus engineered to express IL-15. The preclinical studies in mice showed promising results, but further research is needed to determine safety and efficacy in humans.

2. Explore combination therapies using the IL-15 expressing oncolytic viruses along with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immunotherapies. The combination approach may further enhance the anti-tumor immune response. 

3. Optimize the dosing and delivery method of the IL-15 armed oncolytic viruses for treating brain tumors. Intratumoral, intravenous, or intrathecal administration could be compared to determine the most effective approach.

4. Engineer the IL-15 expressing oncolytic viruses to also express other cytokines or costimulatory molecules to further boost anti-tumor immunity. Possibilities include IL-12, IL-18, OX40L, or 4-1BBL.

5. Isolate and characterize the tumor antigens released after oncolytic virus infection of glioma cells. These antigens could then be used to develop personalized dendritic cell or peptide vaccines for each patient to specifically target their tumor.
