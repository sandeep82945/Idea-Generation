Our theoretical calculations reveal that the disorder present in the Co2FeAl compound enhances the Berry curvature induced intrinsic AHC.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.105.035124\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe Hall effect is defined as the realization of a transverse electric field when a magnetic field is applied to a current-carrying conductor [1]. Ferromagnetic materials show an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to the interaction between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and magnetization [1\u20134]. AHE finds renewed attention in condensed matter physics due to its huge application in magnetic sensors, random access memory, and spin logic devices [2,5,6]. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of AHE: an extrinsic mechanism related to the scattering events, which includes skew scattering and side jumps, and another that is an intrinsic mechanism related to the band structure of the material [2,7,8]. The intrinsic mechanism was proposed by Karplus and Luttinger (KL theory of intrinsic mechanism), which is connected to the role of SOC in the electronic band structure of ferromagnetic materials and results in the anomalous velocity of electrons perpendicular to the electric field direction [2,9,10]. Later, KL theory was well understood in terms of the Berry phase and Berry curvature [11]. The Berry curvature is identical to a fictitious magnetic field in momentum space related to the geometrical phase of the electronic wave function [12]. The Berry curvature in momentum space introduces transverse momentum to the electrons and gives an intrinsic AHE [13,14].\nThe Berry curvature is highly sensitive to the electronic band structure of the material, and modulation in the band\n*ssingh.mst@iitbhu.ac.in\nstructure can influence the Berry curvature and hence intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) [15]. The disorder may change the topology of the Fermi surface or position of the Fermi level or modify the local potential environment that breaks translational symmetry, inevitably modifying the band structure, which may reshape the AHE [15\u201319]. An increased AHC has been reported in a thin film of Co2MnAl1\u2212xSix due to increased L21 ordering within the lattice [18]. Recently, an enhancement in the AHC has been observed in Fe2-based high Curie temperature Heusler compounds due to the increase in the crystal symmetry, when the system transforms from an inverse Heusler to B2 type (CsCl) structure [20].\nCo2-based full Heusler compounds got enormous attention for their half-metallic behavior, and 100% spin polarization around the Fermi level, which are the most prominent properties useful in spintronics devices and other memory-based applications [21\u201324]. Additionally, Co2-based Heusler compounds are of current interest, because of their large AHE due to the large Berry curvature linked with their band structure [17,25\u201328]. Among Co2-based Heusler compounds, Co2FeAl is the most prominent candidate for data processing and storage-based applications due to its large Curie temperature (\u223c810-900 K), high-spin polarization, low Gilbert damping factor, and ultrafast magnetization dynamics [29\u201333]. As the literature suggests that Co2FeAl generally crystallizes into a B2-type [31,34\u201336] disordered structure, this compound therefore provides an opportunity for the investigation of the disorder effect on the Berry curvature and intrinsic AHC. Attempts to investigate anomalous transport in Co2FeAl thin films report controversial results concerning the origin of AHE [34,35,37].\n2469-9950/2022/105(3)/035124(8) 035124-1 \u00a92022 American Physical Society\nIn the present paper, we studied AHE in a polycrystalline bulk Co2FeAl Heusler compound. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction (SXRD) data reveals a large degree of antisite disorder between the Fe and Al atoms. The experimental value of AHC was found to be about 227 S/cm at 2 K and 219 S/cm at 300 K with an intrinsic contribution of 155 S/cm. This intrinsic value of AHC is an order of magnitude larger than the theoretically predicted AHC for an ordered L21 phase of Co2FeAl. Our theoretical calculations show that the antisite disorder present in Co2FeAl enhances the Berry curvature induced intrinsic AHC."

            "text": "A polycrystalline Co2FeAl Heusler compound was synthesized using a conventional arc melting technique using a stoichiometric amount of its high pure constituent elements. The compound was melted four times to ensure chemical homogeneity. A very small weight loss of 0.32% was noted after melting. Further, the ingot was sealed in a quartz ampoule under Ar atmosphere and then annealed at 800 \u25e6C for 12 h for better homogeneity. The energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis reveals a composition ratio of 2:1:1 within the standard deviation (3%\u20135%) of the EDX measurement. A small piece was cut from the annealed ingot and crushed into powder for the SXRD measurement. The SXRD measurement was performed at PETRA-III, DESY for a structural analysis using a wavelength of 0.207 \u00c5. Magnetic field-dependent magnetization measurements were carried out using the magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) from Quantum Design. A small polished rectangular piece was used for four-probe and five-probe magnetotransport measurements to obtain the longitudinal resistivity (\u03c1xx) and the Hall resistivity (\u03c1H), respectively. To obtain the actual \u03c1H, raw Hall resistivity data (\u03c1rawH ) were antisymmetrized by averaging the difference of \u03c1rawH at the positive and negative magnetic fields.\nElectronic structure calculations were carried out using pseudopotential based density-functional theory and planewave basis sets as implemented in QUANTUM ESPRESSO (QE) [38], whereas the exchange-correlation potential is approximated through the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) functional [39]. Optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials [40] are used in the calculations and the kinetic energy cutoff for the plane wave is taken as 80 Ry. The electronic integration over the Brillouin zone is approximated by a Gaussian smearing of 0.01 Ry both for the self-consistent (SC) and non-self-consistent (NSC) calculations. The threshold for the SC energy calculations is taken as 10\u22128 Ry. The projections of Bloch wave functions are made into maximally localized Wannier functions. The WANNIER90 tool (implemented within QE) has been used to compute the Wannier interpolated bands and AHC [38,41,42]. SOC is introduced in all the calculations. A Monkhorst-Pack k grid of 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 is considered in the SC, NSC, and WANNIER90 calculations. The transition metald and Al-p orbitals are used as projections for the WANNIER90 calculations. The AHC calculation is carried out with a dense k grid of 75 \u00d7 75 \u00d7 75. Further, through the adaptive refinement technique, a fine mesh of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 is added around the points wherever the mode of the Berry curvature [| (k)|]\nexceeds 100 bohr2. The calculations are carried out using an experimental lattice parameter."

            "text": "The SXRD pattern of the Co2FeAl compound was collected at room temperature for a detailed analysis of crystal structure. In the first step, the Rietveld refinement of the SXRD pattern was carried out using the L21 ordered cubic structure with space group Fm3\u0304m. For the refinement, all the atoms were considered at special positions, i.e., Co at 8c (0.25, 0.25, 0.25), Fe at 4b (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), and Al at 4a (0, 0, 0) Wyckoff positions, respectively. The result of refinements is shown in Fig. 1(a).\nWe noticed the presence of (111) superlattice reflection in the calculated x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern [black lines of\n035124-2\nFig. 1(a)], while this reflection is completely absent in the observed XRD pattern [red dots in Fig. 1(a)]. Interestingly, attempts to anneal the Co2FeAl at different temperatures also could not show any remarkable difference in the XRD pattern in comparison to that observed in Fig. 1(a). It is important to mention here that atomic disorder is a common phenomenon in Heusler compounds [16,18,43]. The available literature also suggests that the Co2FeAl crystallizes either in a B2 type structure, i.e., there is an antisite disorder between Fe and Al atoms (mutual swapping of the Fe and Al atomic position keeping the same stoichiometry) [31,34\u201336] or in a mixed phase of L21 and B2 structures [44]. However, the complete absence of a (111) peak in the SXRD pattern [inset of Fig. 1(a)] indicates the presence of antisite disorder in the present sample. So, in the next step we simulated the XRD pattern of Co2FeAl considering the Fe-Al antisite disorder in such a way that the total number of Fe and Al atoms remains the same. For the XRD simulation, we used POWDERCELL software [45]. It is clear from Fig. 1(b) that the intensity of the (111) peak decreases with an increase in the amount of disorder and vanishes completely with about 50% antisite disorder between the Fe-Al atoms. Therefore, finally we performed the Rietveld refinement of the SXRD data assuming 50% antisite disorder between the Fe-Al atoms, which could fit the Bragg peaks very well [Fig. 1(c)] and confirm the phase purity (cubic) as well as the large antisite disorder (B2 type) in the sample. Moreover, the presence of a (200) Bragg peak primarily indicates the formation of an ordered Co sublattice and also precludes the possibility of A2 disorder (atomic disorder among all sites) in the sample. The intensity ratio of the superlattice reflection (200) and the fundamental reflection (220) (i.e., I200I220 ) was found to be 0.048 and 0.046 from the experimental SXRD pattern and simulated XRD pattern, respectively, which are nearly the same, and further confirms the ordered Co sublattice in the present compound [34]. The refined unit cell parameter was found to be 5.73 \u00c5, which is in good agreement with the literature [46,47]."

The variation of \u03c1xx as a function of temperature [Fig. 3(a)] depicts that \u03c1xx increases with increasing temperature, indicating the metallic character of the compound. The residual resistance ratio [RRR = \u03c1xx (300 K)\n\u03c1xx (2 K) ] of\nabout 1.25 is similar to the reported value for other Co2-based Heusler compounds [25,51,52]."

            "text": "We carried out detailed magnetotransport measurements in a wide temperature range of 2\u2013300 K to study the AHE in Co2FeAl. The Hall resistivity (\u03c1H) can be given by the equation \u03c1H = R0H + RsM, where R0 and Rs are the normal and anomalous Hall coefficients respectively. \u03c1H vs H was measured at different temperatures up to a field of 7 T. From Fig. 3(b), it is evident that \u03c1H steeply increases with fields up to 1 T, which can be observed due to AHE. However, under the\napplication of higher fields (>1 T), a negative slope is noted due to the ordinary Hall effect. The normal Hall coefficient (R0) was calculated from the slope of the high-field \u03c1H curve. Figure 3(c) shows a temperature variation of R0. The negative value of R0 indicates the electrons are the majority charge carriers. The inset of Fig. 3(c) shows the magnitude of carrier concentration (n) at different temperatures, calculated using the relation R0 = 1ne , where n was found to be around 3 \u00d7 1021 at 300 K and the variation of n with temperature is slightly scattered. The anomalous Hall resistivity (\u03c1AH) was calculated by extrapolating the high-field \u03c1H curve on the y axis at zero field.\nIn order to elucidate the mechanism giving rise to AHE, we have plotted \u03c1AH vs \u03c1xx on a double logarithmic scale and fitting was employed to determine the exponent \u03b2 using the relation \u03c1AH \u221d \u03c1\u03b2xx [25] as shown in Fig. 3(d). If \u03b2 = 1, the origin of AHE is assigned to the skew scattering, and if \u03b2 = 2, the origin of AHE is due to intrinsic and side jump mechanisms [2,25]. We found the exponent \u03b2 = 1.69, which indicates that the AHE in Co2FeAl is dominated by the intrinsic and side jump mechanisms. The contribution of a side jump in AHC can be estimated using an expression e2/(ha)( so/EF), where so is the spin-orbit interaction and EF is the Fermi energy [53,54]. The terms e, h, and a are the electronic charge, Planck constant, and lattice parameter, respectively. For most of the ferromagnetic metals so/EF is an order of 10\u22122, and hence a very small contribution of AHC is expected due to a side jump in comparison to the intrinsic part of AHC. However, it is not possible to decouple the intrinsic and side jump mechanisms practically because both have similar dependencies on \u03c1xx.\nWe have calculated the Hall conductivity using the tensor conversion \u03c3H = \u03c1H(\u03c12H+\u03c12xx ) [43,55] as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). The AHC is calculated by averaging the extrapolated values of the high-field Hall conductivity curve at zero field of the positive and negative field directions. Temperaturedependent \u03c1AH (black dots) and AHC (blue dots) are shown\n035124-3\nin Fig. 4(a). The value of AHC is found to be about 227 S/cm at 2 K and does not show an appreciable change at 300 K (219 S/cm). The variation of AHC is nearly temperature independent, suggesting that the origin of AHE is intrinsic [56,57].\nTo separate the extrinsic and intrinsic parts of AHE, we have plotted \u03c1AH vs \u03c1xx and fitted [Fig. 4(b)] according to the well-established equation for AHE, \u03c1AH = \u03b1skew\u03c1xx + \u03c3 int\u03c12xx, where \u03b1\nskew and \u03c3 int correspond to the skew scattering parameter and intrinsic AHC, respectively. \u03c3 int was estimated as \u223c155 S/cm, which is about 70% of the total AHC at 2 K. Thus, in the present system, the intrinsic Berry phase driven KL contribution dominates along with finite skew scattering [2,56\u201358]."

            "text": "After obtaining the experimental value of AHC, we have theoretically calculated AHC for Co2FeAl by setting the magnetization direction along [001]. For Co2-based Heusler alloys the ground state energy in another magnetization direction such as [110] was found close to the [001] direction and the band structure was also found to be quite similar in both directions, therefore the average picture of AHC is expected to be close to the [001] direction [17,27,59,60]. The intrinsic AHC is proportional to the Brillouin zone (BZ) summation of the Berry curvature over all occupied states [61],\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = e 2\nh\u0304\n1\nN\n\u2211\nk\u2208(BZ) \u03b3 (k) f (k), (1)\nwhere the indices \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are the Cartesian coordinates. f (k) stands for the Fermi distribution function, \u03b3 (k) denotes the \u03b3 component of the Berry curvature for the wave vector k, and N is the number of electrons in the crystal. Further, the Berry curvature is related to the Berry connection [An(k)] as\nn(k) = \u2207k \u00d7 An(k), (2) where n is the band index and An(k) in terms of cellperiodic Bloch states |unk\u3009 = e\u2212ik\u00b7r |\u03c8nk\u3009 is defined as An(k) = \u3008unk|i\u2207k|unk\u3009 [62]. In the first step of the AHC calculation, we considered the ordered L21 structure of Co2FeAl, i.e., without any disorder. As discussed earlier, the intrinsic AHC of a system is strongly connected to its electronic band structure. In Fig. 5 (top), we have compared the full electronic band structure of L21 ordered Co2FeAl with the Wannier interpolated one. The better interpolation suggests that it will provide WANNIER90 related properties accurately. The Wannier interpolation is a potential tool to calculate the momentum space integrals of rapidly varying functions [63]. Such integrals are involved in calculating the properties such as anomalous Hall conductivity, spin Hall conductivity, orbital magnetization, and optical properties [64]. The most popular technique to construct the Wannier functions is the maximally localized method [41] which is implemented in the WANNIER90 code [64]. The Wannier functions are generated using the unitary transformation of the Bloch wave function, so there is no loss of information during the generation. The main advantage of the Wannier interpolation over other approaches is that it allows for the most precise interpolation of band energies and\n035124-4\nmatrix elements compared to other methods such as the tight binding approach because there is no limitation in terms of the size of the basis set [65].\nBy this method, we found the theoretical value of AHC (\u03c3 xy) about \u223c42 S/cm, which is in good agreement with the literature [66]. Thus the theoretical AHC considering an ordered L21 structure is an order smaller than the experimental\nintrinsic AHC. Therefore, in the next step we incorporated 50% antisite disorder between the Al and Fe sites (as observed from the SXRD analysis) in order to compute AHC for the disordered Co2FeAl. In Fig. 6 (top), we have plotted the full electronic band structure of disordered Co2FeAl with the Wannier interpolated band structure. The Berry curvature along the high-symmetry path of the disordered structure (space group Pm3\u0304m) is depicted in Fig. 6 (bottom). The intrinsic AHC (\u03c3 xy) for disordered Co2FeAl calculated from the integration of Berry curvature turned out to be \u223c63 S/cm, which is interestingly larger than the ordered L21 structure. Thus, our theoretical calculations suggest that the disorder can modify the Berry curvature and result in an increased value of intrinsic AHC. Recently, it has been suggested in the literature that the presence of B2 disorder lowers the value of AHC in comparison to an ordered L21 structure [18,20]. Therefore, our combined experimental and theoretical results suggest that there is no straightforward rule that connects the Berry curvature to the disorder, but rather it depends on the disorder induced change in the electronic structure, which is different for different Heusler compounds as they have different numbers of electrons. If the effect of disorder is such that it brings the band crossings or avoided band crossing very close to the Fermi energy, then the value of Berry curvature will be large. We would also like to mention here that the experimentally found intrinsic AHC (155 S/cm) is larger than the theoretically predicted intrinsic AHC similar to other metallic compounds [17,56,66,67]. Hence, our results provide a platform for the systematic investigation of AHE in disordered Heusler compounds and related materials."

            "text": "In conclusion, we investigated the anomalous transport properties of a polycrystalline Co2FeAl Heusler compound by experiment and theoretical calculations. SXRD data reveal a large degree of Fe-Al antisite disorder. Experimental values of AHC were found to be 227 S/cm at 2 K and 219 S/cm at\n035124-5\n300 K with an intrinsic AHC of 155 S/cm. Our experimental analysis shows that the AHE in Co2FeAl is dominated by an intrinsic Berry phase mechanism. Our theoretical calculations suggest that the enhanced Berry curvature induced intrinsic AHC is linked with the antisite disorder present in the Co2FeAl Heusler compound."
