Close to the infinite-temperature steady state, the real-time Lindbladian dynamics of this system is identical to the near-zero-temperature dynamics in Euclidean time of a two-site non-Hermitian SYK with intersite coupling whose gravity dual has been recently related to wormhole configurations. We show that the saddle-point equations in the realtime formulation are identical to those in Euclidean time. Indeed, an explicit calculation of Green\u2019s functions at low temperature, numerical for q \u00bc 4 and analytical for q \u00bc 2 and large q, illustrates this equivalence. Only for very strong coupling does the decay rate approach the linear dependence on the coupling characteristic of a dissipation-driven approach to the steady state. For q > 2, we identify a potential gravity dual of the real-time dissipative SYK model: a double-trumpet configuration in a near-de Sitter space in two dimensions with matter. This configuration, which we term a Keldysh wormhole, is responsible for a finite decay rate even in the absence of coupling to the environment.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.106006\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe existence of an environment, either thermal, quantum, or the very measurement process, makes the time evolution of a quantum system not strictly unitary, complicating the description of its time evolution. An elegant approach to this problem, advocated by Caldeira and Leggett [1], is to describe the system plus environment by an Hermitian Hamiltonian. The integration of the environmental degrees of freedom then results in nonunitary dynamics. Especially for many-body systems, it is technically hard to tackle the resulting problem, either numerically or analytically, because the tracing out of the environment leads to nonlocal interactions in time. In the limit where the environment has a sufficiently short correlation time, the Liouvillian generator that\ngoverns the quantum time evolution of the density matrix of the reduced system can be written in the socalled Lindblad form [2\u20136]. Compared to the usual von Neumann equation of motion, the Lindblad equation contains additional terms modeled by the so-called jump or Lindblad operators [3] that describe the coupling of the system to the environment. The advantage of this approach is that the quantum master equation is expressed only in terms of the system degrees of freedom, which facilitates its solution. In recent times, there has been a renewed interest in different aspects of the Liouvillian dynamics, especially in random systems [7\u201316], including the study of the spectrum [7,10,11,14], with the aim to extending the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture [17] to dissipative quantum systems [18\u201320], the characterization of the late-time dynamics [8\u201310,15] towards a steady state [10,16,21,22], or the robustness of dissipative quantum chaotic features [23]. The Keldysh path integral [24,25] is the standard\nprocedure used to investigate the nonequilibrium time evolution of the density matrix. A key difference to the standard path integral, which will be very important in the following, is that, in order to set up the calculation for the density matrix, it is necessary [24,25] to consider the time evolution of a state matrix, not a state vector.\n*amgg@sjtu.edu.cn \u2020lucas.seara.sa@tecnico.ulisboa.pt \u2021jacobus.verbaarschot@stonybrook.edu \u00a7jpzheng@sjtu.edu.cn\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In this representation, the density matrix is a state in the doubled Hilbert space and the Liouvillian has two parts: the first is anti-Hermitian, corresponding to the Hermitian Hamiltonian, before any coupling to the environment but multiplied by the imaginary unit, and its conjugate such that the whole system is anti-Hermitian; the second contains Lindblad jump operators depending on fields living in both copies and includes (i) an explicit coupling between the degrees of freedom of the two copies and (ii) intrasite interactions effectively modifying the (anti-)Hermitian part. Using standard field theory techniques, it is then possible to investigate the out-ofequilibrium time evolution of a strongly interacting system either coupled to a bath or undergoing a continuous measurement process. If we are interested in the steady state, and in sufficiently long timescales, it is plausible to assume that the initial state becomes irrelevant, leading to further simplifications, namely, a timetranslational-invariant relaxation. Intriguingly, operators similar to the vectorized Liouvillian are being employed in a completely different context: as non-Hermitian two-site Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonians [26\u201334], N Majoranas with infinite range q-body interactions in zero dimensions, whose gravity dual is a wormhole [35\u201337]. Earlier, a single-site SYKmodel was proposed as an example of the holographic duality based on the fact that features such as the saturation of a bound on chaos [38], spectral correlations described by random matrix theory [39,40], and an exponential growth of the density of low-energy excitations [41\u201343] are shared by certain near-AdS2 backgrounds [44\u201347] in the lowtemperature limit. It has also been noticed [35] that the gravity dual of two identical two-site Hermitian SYKs with a weak intersite coupling is a traversable wormhole [36]. These traversable wormholes are the dominant configurations only for sufficiently low temperature. At higher temperature, a transition to a black hole configuration occurs, which can also be characterized by an analysis of level statistics [48]. By contrast, a pair of non-Hermitian PT-symmetric SYKs with no explicit intersite coupling in the lowtemperature limit is dual to a Euclidean wormhole [37]. The presence of an explicit coupling triggers [49] a transition from Euclidean to traversable wormholes. Both traversable and Euclidean wormholes are characterized by a gapped ground state and a first-order phase transition in the free energy separating the wormhole and black hole phases. Differences include a qualitatively different dependence of the gap on the parameters of the model and a different pattern of oscillations of Green\u2019s functions in real time directly related to different symmetries of the solutions: U\u00f01\u00de for Euclidean and SL\u00f02; R\u00de for traversable.\nFor earlier work on wormholes, mostly in higher dimensions, see [50\u201354]. In this paper, we show that the near zero-temperature dynamics of a two-site SYK Hamiltonian in Euclidean time, dual to gravitational wormholes in certain limits, and the real-time Liouvillian describing a single-site SYK coupled to a Markovian bath close to the infinitetemperature steady state coincide. More specifically, we show that the equations of motion in the Euclidean problem in the low-temperature limit are identical to the equations of motion in the real-time Liouvillian evolution close to the steady state. This implies that the retarded Green\u2019s function of the real-time problem is identical to the equivalent one in the Euclidean problem. As a consequence, the so-called gap in the Euclidean formulation that characterizes the wormhole phase is equal to the dominant decay rate in the real-time Liouvillian evolution. This equivalence only holds when neglecting the boundary conditions, which are generally different for the two approaches. In practical terms, the equivalence works for sufficiently low temperatures in the Euclidean problem and for times such that the system is sufficiently close to the steady state in the real-time problem. Finally, we would like to stress that there are already several works that have studied different aspects of the non-Hermitian SYK model: from the use of the Lindblad formalism [55,56] and the investigation of the entanglement entropy growth [57,58] and decoherence effects [59\u201361], to its relation to Euclidean wormholes [37,62], replica symmetry breaking [49,63], and a symmetry classification [64]. However, these studies have not investigated the mentioned intriguing relation between wormholes in Euclidean time and strongly interacting dissipative systems in real time. We shall see that this finding has a strong impact on important features of the dynamics, such as an enhancement of the decay rate in the limit of very weak coupling to the environment. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce the open SYK model, which will be our main object of study, and the equations of motion in the \u03a3G formulation [34] in both real and Euclidean time. In Sec. III, we calculate the long-time behavior of the Green\u2019s function by numerically solving the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations for q \u00bc 4 and find an anomalously large decay rate (or gap) for small intersite coupling. For q \u00bc 2, the Green\u2019s functions can be evaluated analytically and, because the model is not quantum chaotic, no anomalous relaxation is found, which is discussed in Sec. IV. The large-q limit is worked out analytically in Sec. V. The gravity dual of the SYK Hamiltonian coupled to an environment, dubbed Keldysh wormhole, is discussed in Sec. VI and concluding remarks are made in Sec. VII. Additional technical details are worked out in six appendices.\n106006-2"

We assume that boundary conditions play no role in the dynamics, which allows us to extend the limits of integration in the action to infinity. This assumption holds if the system is sufficiently close to the steady state. We evaluate the Green\u2019s functions of the operator L in two different ways: by the Keldysh approach corresponding to open real-time evolution, in the next subsection, and in Appendix B; and in Euclidean time, see Sec. II C and Appendix C. In both cases, the saddle-point equations are obtained under the assumption of translational invariance.

If the system is gapped, naively, we expect that GLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de decays exponentially at a rate given by the spectral gap \u0394, namely, the gap between the ground state energy and the first excited state. However, we will see that, in the weak-coupling limit \u03bc \u226a 1, the decay rate Eg, also referred to as the gap, that governs the exponential decay of GLR is much larger than the spectral gap Eg \u226b \u0394.

II B.\n106006-5\nImportantly, we note that in the limit of zero temperature, and assuming no memory of the initial state, both actions, the Euclidean one for the Hamiltonian and the Lorentzian one for the Liouvillian are identical, upon setting \u03c4 \u00bc t. We also have seen that the Green\u2019s functions satisfy the same Schwinger-Dyson equations, and at low temperature the solutions will be the same. More discussion of this equivalence can be found in Appendix D. We have thus established a complete equivalence between the two problems: the real-time path integral of an SYK coupled to a bath close to the steady state and the Euclidean path integral of a two-site non-Hermitian SYK related to wormhole configurations in the low-temperature limit. For instance, the value ofEg in the Euclidean problemwill be the same as the decay rate \u0393 that describes the typical relaxation time to a steady state in the real-time problem. We have shown that the retarded Green\u2019s function in the real-time problem is equal to\u2212iGLL \u2212 GLR in the Euclidean problem. Wewould like to remind the reader that, althoughwe use\u03c8L, \u03c8R in both Liouvillian and Euclidean discussions, they are not exactly the same: the former is for real time and L, R represent different branches of the Keldysh contour, while the latter is for imaginary time and L, R denotes two sites of the system. Rather than using a Keldysh contour, we could also have solved the real-time problem as a two-site system. In the remainder of the paper, we discuss the solutions of the saddle-point equations which illustrate the equivalence of the Keldysh approach and the Euclidean approach at low temperature. We will start with a study of the q \u00bc 4 SYK model, whose dynamics is quantum chaotic, by solving numerically the saddle-point Schwinger-Dyson equations. We will then continue with analytical studies both for q \u00bc 2, whose dynamics is integrable, and in the large-q limit, whose dynamics is quantum chaotic. Finally, we will explore the possible existence of a gravity dual and its relevance in the late-time dynamics of our real-time SYK model. We are motivated by the recent result that, in the low-temperature limit, a similar nonHermitian SYK model, with additional real couplings, is dual to a Euclidean wormhole [37]. This possibility was originally noticed in Ref. [35] and later formulated in detail in Ref. [37], see also Refs. [49,62,63,66]. We shall show that qualitatively similar results are found in our model and we will dub the possible gravity dual a Keldysh wormhole. Interestingly, this identification between strongly correlated dissipative quantum matter and quantum gravity strongly suggests that the observation of a gap or decay rate, even if there is no coupling to the bath, is closely related to the existence of a wormhole gravity dual."

            "text": "We now proceed with the explicit calculation of \u0393, Eg that control the exponential decay of Green\u2019s functions in the real-time and Euclidean problem respectively, by\nsolving the Schwinger-Dyson equations of both the Euclidean problem related to the non-Hermitian q \u00bc 4 SYK model, or the Lorentzian problem related to Liouvillian dynamics, which, as we have seen in the previous section, give the same results. For that purpose, we will compute the relevant Green\u2019s functions by solving the SD equations (30) and (31) at \u03b2 \u00bc 500 and the SD equations (B30) and (B31), respectively. Similar calculations have been carried out recently. In Ref. [56], the real-time calculation was carried out but no results were presented in the small-\u03bc region of interest. In this limit, we shall see that the large-q calculation shows some deviations from the result obtained from the explicit solution of the SD equations for q \u00bc 4. The Euclidean calculation for a similar model, where the SYK couplings are not purely imaginary but also have a real part, was carried out in Ref. [66]. However, we shall see that Eg and other observables are qualitatively different. In Fig. 1, we depict the Euclidean, GLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de, and retarded Lorentzian, GR\u00f0t\u00de=2, Green\u2019s functions for different values of the coupling to the environment \u03bc. As argued above, the two computations coincide. We stress that we are not making any analytical continuation but just compare Euclidean and Lorentzian times. For small \u03bc, we observe oscillations in the Green\u2019s functions and a fast decay for long times. In both cases, as shown in the figure, we find an excellent agreement with a fit to Ae\u2212Egt sin \u00f0\u03a9t\u00fe \u03d5\u00de with A, Eg, \u03a9, and \u03d5 fitting parameters. The frequency of the oscillations, \u03a9, vanishes for sufficiently large \u03bc > 0.15. In the Lorentzian case, similar oscillations [55,56] have been found in a model with a random jump operator involving two Majorana fermions. The exponential decay, controlled by Eg, persists for any coupling strength \u03bc provided that temperature is sufficiently low. Following previous literature [35,37,48,66], we have denoted the decay rate as Eg in reference to a gap. However, we stress that, especially for zero or small \u03bc, this is not related to a gap in the spectrum between the ground state and the first excited state. It is rather the order parameter that, in the gravity dual, characterizes the wormhole phase. Therefore, it is a feature of the model resulting after ensemble averaging. A heuristic explanation of its origin is that the low-energy excitations in the partition function are nullified because the spectrum is complex and PT symmetric. The ground state is not affected because it is real. As \u03bc increases, Eg approaches the spectral gap \u0394. In Fig. 2, we show the gap Eg (left), or decay rate \u0393 for the real-time calculation, and the frequency of the oscillations (right) of the Green\u2019s function as a function of the coupling \u03bc. The curves for Eg\u00f0\u03bc\u00de; \u0393\u00f0\u03bc\u00de, and \u03a9\u00f0\u03bc\u00de are barely distinguishable which further supports that, in the T \u2192 0 limit, the Hamiltonian (22) is identical to the Liouvillian (8) that represents a SYK coupled to a Markovian bath. Both Eg and \u03a9 have an intriguing \u03bc dependence that we now analyze in detail.\n106006-6\nFor \u03bc \u00bc 0, the gap is finite and the frequency of the oscillations in the Green\u2019s function is largest. Physically, this corresponds to a complex order parameter whose real part controls the exponential decay and the\nimaginary part the frequency of oscillation. As \u03bc increases, the imaginary part of the excited eigenvalues becomes smaller. Therefore, a larger \u03bc is expected to reduce the value of \u03a9\u00f0\u03bc\u00de. Indeed, we find that the frequency decreases\n106006-7\nmonotonically with \u03bc. Interestingly, \u03a9\u00f0\u03bc\u00de shows excellent agreement with a simple ansatz \u03a9\u00f0\u03bc\u00de \u2248 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\u03bcc \u2212 \u03bcp with \u03bcc \u2248 0.15. For \u03bc > \u03bcc, the decay of Green\u2019s function is purely exponential, which implies the vanishing of the frequency of oscillations. This is consistent with the existence of a second-order phase transition at \u03bc \u00bc \u03bcc. The gap or decay rate in the small-\u03bc limit, which has not been investigated before, has also a rather unexpected behavior. The decay rate (or gap) is not zero even in the limit \u03bc \u2192 0 of the coupling to the bath. We stress that, as mentioned earlier, Eg at \u03bc \u00bc 0 is not related to the spectral gap. On the Euclidean side, an analog feature has already been predicted [35] by noticing that the existence of a finite Eg, which is a signature of the dual wormhole configurations, only requires that the variance of the leftright coupling is stronger than the left-left or right-right ones. This can be easily achieved with complex couplings in the SYK model. Indeed, the purely imaginary couplings of our model are sufficient since the variance of the left-left, or right-right, couplings are negative while the left-right ones are positive [35]. Strictly speaking, the gravity dual cannot be a Euclidean wormhole because the variance of real couplings (zero in our case) is not larger than the imaginary ones [35]. However, we shall see that our model still has wormhole-like features similar to those of a Euclidean wormhole. Its counterpart in the real-time calculation is the existence of a finite decay rate even if there is no coupling with the environment, which is expected provided that the SYK model is quantum chaotic (q > 2) [33,34,39,41]. We term the wormhole configuration in real time and \u03bc \u226a 1, responsible for the finite decay rate, a Keldysh wormhole. We shall give a more precise characterization of this possible gravity dual in Sec. VI. For a small but finite \u03bc=\u03bcc < 1, Eg\u00f0\u03bc\u00de \u2212 Eg\u00f00\u00de \u223c \u03bc (or \u0393\u00f0\u03bc\u00de \u2212 \u0393\u00f00\u00de \u223c \u03bc) increases linearly. Thismakes sense physically since a stronger coupling to the bath results in a larger decay rate. We think this linear behavior is related to the fact that the energy of the first excited state is always real and equal to 4\u03bc. However, the overall effect on Eg is relatively small compared with the \u03bc \u00bc 0 contribution, namely, the spectral gap\u0394\u2261 E1 \u2212 E0, where E0 and E1 are the energies of the ground and first excited state, is only a small contribution to Eg. The linearity suggests that the slope can be obtained by a perturbative treatment in \u03bc. This is in contrast with the \u03bc2=3 behavior observed for a two-site SYK with \u03bc \u226a 1 whose gravity dual is a traversable wormhole [35]. Therefore, we can rule out any quantitative relation between our setting and this gravity dual. At a critical value \u03bcc \u2248 0.15, corresponding to the vanishing of the oscillation frequency, the linear increase of Eg stops abruptly. A further increase in the coupling \u03bc leads to a sharp, likely continuous, drop in Eg or \u0393. This is rather unexpected as an increase in the coupling to the bath should always lead to an increase in the decay rate as the\napproach to equilibrium should occur faster. Similarly, a stronger explicit left-right coupling in the Euclidean problem is expected to give a larger gap because the hopping probability increases. However, we clearly observe a drop as \u03bc\u2273 0.15 increases. A possible explanation of this nonmonotonic behavior is that the oscillations become imaginary, \u03a9 \u2192 i\u03a9, for \u03bc > \u03bcc, so that they effectively become a negative contribution to the gap. More generally, we believe that this sharp decrease is directly related to the effective weakening of the strength of the imaginary couplings in each SYK due to the left-right term which is Hermitian in our model. For a sufficiently large \u03bc, in agreement with Ref. [56], the decay rate \u0393, or Eg, approaches a linear dependence Eg \u223c \u03bc, which is the expected result [25] for a strong coupling to the environment. In this region, the spectrum is mostly real and Eg is close to the spectral gap \u0394. In order to gain a more complete understanding of the physical meaning of Eg and \u03a9, we computed the finite-N Green\u2019s functions, see Appendix E, by exact diagonalization (ED) techniques. Most of our finite-N results have been obtained for N \u00bc 9, and at this point we are satisfied with a qualitative agreement between the finite-N results and the SD results. For \u03bc < 0.15, we find a large difference between the average of the Green\u2019s function and the average of the absolute value of the Green\u2019s function. In both cases, we find an initial fast exponential decrease followed by a slower exponential decrease at longer times. However, the range of the initial exponential decay increases substantially upon ensemble averaging because of cancellations in the average of the Green\u2019s function. We expect that in the large-N limit, and in the limit of a very large number of realizations, where these cancellations become manifest, the initial exponential decrease will become dominant and will converge to the result obtained from the solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equations. Indeed, we find qualitative agreement with the results of this section, see Fig. 9 of Appendix E. In particular, we find a finite gap at \u03bc \u00bc 0 which increases linearly for small \u03bc. The long-time tail remains dominant for the average of the absolute value of the Green\u2019s function. For small \u03bc its decay rate converges to the result given by the spectral gap, which is equal to \u0394 \u00bc E1 \u2212 E0 \u00bc 4\u03bc, while for large \u03bc the decay rates of the initial exponential decay and the long-time exponential decay become equal. At finite N, we observe oscillations realization by realization but, because their period fluctuates, they are mostly averaged out after ensemble averaging. The detailed nature of the cancellation mechanism of the long-time tail is not clear at this point. For \u03bc > 0.175 no cancellations happen, but the initial decay rate is still different from the long-time decay rate. A better understanding of this difference requires a detailed finite-size scaling analysis. Results on the finite-N scaling of the Green\u2019s function are relatively scarce in the SYK literature.\n106006-8\nThey have been studied to some extent for out-of-timeorder correlator (OTOC) [67] but in that case the problem is that the exponential behavior is barely visible at finite N, while in the present problem the exponential decay is very clear for the long-time tail. Also the free energy, which is studied in Sec. VI, only shows a weak N dependence at low temperatures, much weaker than the one observed in a different non-Hermitian SYK model [63]. One of the reasons is that, in the present case, the finite-N ground state is reproduced identically by ED techniques. The free energy also has finite-N issues that are not well understood: for small \u03bc, it has oscillations that are not observed in the solutions of the SD equations. Another potential source for the absence of the long-time tail in the SD equations is the averaging procedure. In the exact diagonalization, the average is done directly on the individual Green\u2019s function while in the SD analysis the average over disorder is taken at earlier stages of the calculation. At present, we cannot rule out completely that this is in part related to other solutions of the saddle-point equations. In any case, progress in this problem requires substantially larger values of N than those discussed in Appendix E and a more precise understanding of the relation between the spectral gap \u0394 and the decay rate Eg. Finally, a natural question to ask is to what extent the anomalous behavior we have found in the weak-coupling limit is universal or whether it is a particularity of the SYK model. More specifically, is it related to the fact that the system is strongly interacting and quantum chaotic? In order to answer this question we turn to the study of a nonchaotic q \u00bc 2 SYK coupled to a Markovian bath described by the same Lindblad operator as for q \u00bc 4."

In Fig. 3, we compare the analytical solution discussed above with the exact numerical solution of the SD equations for both the real-time and Euclidean-time problems. We find that both are indistinguishable from the analytical result without using any fitting parameters which confirms that also for q \u00bc 2 the real-time calculation agrees with the Euclidean calculation in the low-temperature limit. However, unlike the q \u00bc 4 case, we do not observe an anomalously large value for the gap or the decay rate for small values of \u03bc. For q \u00bc 2,Eg \u00bc \u0393 \u00bc \u03bc for all values of \u03bc, so the approach to equilibrium is dissipation-driven. The reason is the integrable nature of the q \u00bc 2 SYK, which requires a coupling to the environment to reach a steady state. Therefore, in the absence of any coupling to the environment, (many-body) quantum chaos and strong interactions seem necessary conditions to reach a steady state. Finally, we note that, for q \u00bc 2, the analytic prediction for Eg is in agreement with the spectral gap. In this case, the finite-N spectrum is given by (for k \u00bc 0; 1;\u2026; N)\n\u03bbk;n \u00bc \u2212\u03bc N 2 \u2212 k \u00fe iek;n; n \u00bc 1;\u2026; N k\n\u00f055\u00de\nwith ek;n real, and it is realization-dependent except for the single real eigenvalue for each value of k. The gap between the first excited state energy with zero imaginary part and the ground state energy is thus equal to \u03bc. So, unlike q \u00bc 4, the resulting spectral gap is equal to the decay rate of the Green\u2019s functions, Eg \u00bc \u0394 \u00bc \u03bc. The observed oscillations in the Green\u2019s functions are determined by the imaginary parts of \u03bbk;n."

            "heading": "VI. GRAVITY DUAL OF A DISSIPATIVE SYK: KELDYSH WORMHOLE",
            "text": "We now turn to the tentative gravitational interpretation of the results obtained above. As was mentioned earlier, it is well established [35,37] that, in the low-temperature limit, the field theory dual of two-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS2) wormholes is a two-site SYK. Depending on the setting, the gravity dual can be a traversable or a Euclidean wormhole. Since the path integral describing the dissipative SYK is identical to the path integral of the two coupled non-Hermitian SYK models, its gravity dual will be the same. Therefore, the findings of this section could shed light on the gravity dual of a single-site SYK coupled to an environment in real time. Our two-site SYK model is qualitatively similar to that recently investigated in Ref. [66], which reported a Euclidean-to-traversable wormhole transition by tuning the intersite coupling. However, there is an important difference: the random couplings in our model are purely imaginary while those of the model of Ref. [66] are complex with the variance of the real part larger than the variance of the imaginary part. Therefore, the lowenergy effective action of our model cannot be easily identified with a Euclidean or a traversable wormhole. The reason is that in our model the coupling J in the Schwarzian term of the low-energy effective action becomes complex, JL \u2192 iJ and JR \u2192 \u2212iJ, with respect to that in the Euclidean and traversable cases. This is a direct consequence of performing the ensemble average over a two-site SYK Hamiltonian that is purely imaginary after vectorization. Intriguingly, this complexification of couplings is precisely the necessary prescription [68] to obtain the correct Schwarzian action describing a double-trumpet configuration in a near-de Sitter background in two dimensions (dS2) [68] in Lorentzian time from the equivalent in a near-AdS2 in Euclidean time [44,45]. If this is the case, our setting would correspond to that of a wormhole in this near-dS2 geometry. Indeed, the so-called bra-ket wormholes [69,70]1 with a similar double-trumpet geometry have been identified in near-dS2 backgrounds coupled to conformal matter. These wormholes are connected geometries between bra (ket) states prepared forward (backward) in time following the Keldysh protocol. Finally, it has been speculated that the SYK dual of a one-boundary near-dS2 background [71] in Lorentzian time, not related to wormholes, would require the same coupling complexification J \u2192 iJ. Beyond the explicit comparison of the low-energy effective action, a potential way to identify the gravity duality more explicitly is to compare the gravitational quasinormal modes in a near-dS2 setting and the decay rate and frequency that characterizes the approach to a steady state in the dissipative SYK.\nFor an interpolating AdS2-to-dS2 geometry, the study of quasinormal modes was carried out in Ref. [72,73]. More recently [74,75], quasinormal modes leading to a purely exponential decay\u2014with no oscillations\u2014of the retarded Green\u2019s function have been computed in a dS2 static patch. It has been conjectured [74,75] that the dual field theory may be a certain Hermitian single-site SYK in the double scaling limit [76]. We note that this is qualitatively different from our non-Hermitian two-site SYK model whose retarded Green\u2019s function in the small \u03bc limit also has oscillations and an exponential decay that does not require large q even for \u03bc \u00bc 0. Therefore, it is expected that the gravity dual of both models is qualitatively different as well. We now turn to confirm the wormhole features of the low-temperature limit of the two-site non-Hermitian model by the study of the free energy, where wormhole configurations are characterized by an almost flat free energy at low temperature that ends abruptly at a certain temperature where a first-order phase transition takes place. In the first two rows of Fig. 4, we present results for the free energy of our model by solving the SD equations for different values of the coupling \u03bc. We note that the free energy is obtained [34] by inserting the solutions of the SD equations back in the action. The free energy has two branches from different solutions of the SD equations. For very low temperatures, and finite but not very strong coupling, we observe a flat part typical of wormhole configurations. This branch eventually crosses a fast decreasing branch, signaling the presence of the first-order transition consistent with a wormhole-black hole transition [35,48]. For a stronger coupling\u03bc, the transition becomes a crossover, a feature that has been observed in the free energy corresponding to a two-site SYK model dual to wormhole configurations [48,66]. For intermediate temperatures above the first-order transition, where the two branches coexist, the free energy undergoes a close to linear decrease. At a higher temperature, close to the end of the wormhole branch, the slope of F\u00f0T\u00de in the high-temperature phase changes rather abruptly. This is consistent with the existence of a higher-order phase transition separating this linear temperature behavior from the black hole phase. We note that around the same temperature at which this change in slope occurs, there is also a qualitative change in the Green\u2019s functions: GLL\u00f0\u03c4\u00de and GLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de have finite real and imaginary parts in this range of temperatures, while they are, respectively, purely real and imaginary elsewhere. These results for the free energy and the ones of Appendix F strongly overlap with those of Ref. [77], which was posted on the arXiv a few days after this paper. Motivated by this intriguing intermediate phase, we have also carried out a numerical calculation of the free energy by computing the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian using ED techniques. The results depicted in the last two rows of Fig. 4 reproduce well the flat part for low temperatures and 1A. M. G. G. thanks Victor Godet for suggesting bra-ket wormholes as a possible gravity dual of our SYK setting.\n106006-13\nthe crossover for larger values of \u03bc. For intermediate temperatures and weak intersite coupling, corresponding to the region of coexistence of two solutions in the large-N calculation above, we observe oscillations that are suppressed as \u03bc increases. This is an indication of a pathological behavior characterized by a negative specific heat and a negative entropy. For \u03bc \u2273 0.125, there are no oscillations and the free energy of the large-N calculation is reproduced qualitatively including the change in slope in the high-temperature limit mentioned above. Further research will be needed to find out both the physical mechanism causing the change of slope and the origin of the observed oscillations in the finite-N free energy. Overall, the first-order transition is rather similar to that reported in other SYK settings [66] where the wormhole gravity dual is explicitly known. Another distinct feature of wormhole configurations [65,66,78] are oscillations of Euclidean Green\u2019s functions after analytic continuation to real time. The frequency of the oscillations is related to Eg. For Euclidean wormholes, GLR and GLL are in phase [66], while for traversable wormholes, they are out of phase [65,78]. Since we have that GLL\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u00bc \u2212isign\u00f0\u03c4\u00deGLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de, the Green\u2019s functions of our Euclidean model in real time will oscillate in phase. Although we cannot identify precisely the dual gravity background, we summarize, based on results in this and previous sections, its main features: a gapped ground state, with a gap that has a nontrivial dependence on the couplings but which is different from that of Euclidean or traversable wormholes; oscillating Green\u2019s functions in real time with jGLL\u00f0t\u00dej \u00bc jGLR\u00f0t\u00dej, as observed in Euclidean wormholes; and a flat free energy in the low-temperature limit that terminates in a first-order phase transition (for higher temperatures, we observe a change of trend in the free energy consistent with a higher-order phase transition). Moreover, as mentioned above, the Schwarzian action of our model should correspond to that of bra-ket wormholes [69] in a near-dS2 background. Since these features are similar to those corresponding to Euclidean or traversable wormholes, but with important qualitative differences, we have termed Keldysh wormholes the field configurations with wormhole-like features that govern the path integral describing the time evolution of an SYK model coupled to an environment."

            "text": "We have shown that in the near-zero-temperature limit, the dynamics of a two-site non-Hermitian SYK model in Euclidean time are equal to the real-time evolution of the Liouvillian describing a one-site SYK model coupled to an environment close to the infinite-temperature steady state. The two-site model has features, like Green\u2019s functions that decay exponentially with a decay rate that is finite even if there is no coupling to the environment and a free energy with a first-order phase transition, consistent with those\nfound earlier in SYK models with a wormhole gravity dual. Indeed, the low-energy effective action is that of a Euclidean wormhole but with the coupling J in the Schwarzian term complexified, J \u2192 iJ. This complexification of the coupling has been related [68,79] to wormholes in a near de-Sitter background and we have termed it a Keldysh wormhole. However, we stress that a precise identification of the gravity dual requires further research. We have also shown that the decay rate of the open SYK is finite even if the coupling to the environment is zero provided that the dynamics is quantum chaotic (for q \u00bc 4). Only in the limit of strong coupling to the bath, the approach to the steady state is controlled by the environment. Interestingly, only in the region of weak or vanishing coupling do Keldysh wormholes control the path integral. An analytical study of the large-q limit, which is also quantum chaotic, confirms that the decay rate is finite even if there is no coupling to the environment. Another distinct feature of these wormhole configurations is that Green\u2019s functions show damped oscillations whose amplitude decreases as the coupling to the bath increases. For a sufficiently strong coupling, the oscillations vanish and, later, the decay rate becomes a monotonic function of the coupling. In contrast, for a dissipative integrable SYK model (q \u00bc 2), the decay rate, which we have obtained analytically, is always dominated by the coupling to the environment. Indeed, contrarily to the quantum chaotic case, it vanishes if there is no coupling to the bath, showing no anomalous relaxation. Also unlike the quantum chaotic case, the pattern of oscillations is observed for any coupling. Natural extensions of this work are a more detailed analysis of the low-energy effective action in Euclidean signature in order to establish a precise relation to wormhole configurations and de Sitter holography [68,79]. We also plan to study the relation between the decay rate and the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and the nature of the largeN limit. Another interesting avenue of research is to investigate more general Lindblad jump operators in order to characterize the conditions for the observation of a phase at weak or zero coupling to the environment where the decay rate is not controlled by the environment and investigate whether it is related to the presence of Keldysh wormholes."

We expect that for large N these results will approach the results obtained from the SD equations. Before discussing the numerical finite-N results, we first discuss the exact analytical results we have used as checks of the numerical finite-N calculations, i.e., the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the ground state and the first excited state, and the large-\u03c9 behavior of GLR\u00f0\u03c9\u00de in the low-temperature limit.\n1.

Numerical finite-N results for q = 4\nIn this section, we discuss the low-temperature finite-N results for GLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de obtained by exact diagonalization. The Green\u2019s functions can be evaluated using Eq. (E14) and the completeness relation of the eigenstates of H. Care must be taken that the right eigenvectors are only orthogonal to the left eigenvectors. The right eigenvectors satisfy\nHVT \u00bc VTD; \u00f0E25\u00de where D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of H. Inserting VTVT\u22121 after the exponential into Eq. (E14) within the region \u03c4=\u03b2 \u226a 1, we obtain\nGiiLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u00bc h0j\u03c8 iLVTe\u2212\u00f0D\u2212E0\u00de\u03c4VT\u22121\u03c8 iRj0i: \u00f0E26\u00de\nThis can be easily evaluated numerically for small values of N. As a check of our numerics, we show in Fig. 5 a comparison of the Green\u2019s functions in frequency space with the large-\u03c9 results derived in the previous subsection. Results are shown for \u03bc \u00bc 0.05 (left) and \u03bc \u00bc 0.25 (right) andN \u00bc 10. The solutions of the SD equations (blue curve)\n106006-21\nshow the same large-\u03c9 behavior but deviate from the finiteN results at low and intermediate frequency. Next,we study the large-timebehavior ofGLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de. In Fig. 6 we show results forN \u00bc 10 and two values of \u03bc (see legend) and compare them to the result from the SD equations. We observe a discrepancy between the SD results and the finiteN behavior of the Green\u2019s function at long times, especially when \u03bc is small. At this moment we do not have a complete understanding of this discrepancy. It might have its origin in the large-N limit of the spectrum, but we do not see this from the finite-N calculations. As an example, in Fig. 7 we give scatter plots of spectra for N \u00bc 12 and various values of \u03bc. Next, we will show that the discrepancy is mainly due to cancellations that becomemanifest only for a large number of realizations. In Fig. 8, we show results forN \u00bc 9 and various values of \u03bc (see legends). For small \u03bc, we can distinguish two exponents, an early rapid decay and a much slower decay at large times. The exponent of the early rapid decay is in\nqualitative agreement with the results of the SchwingerDyson equations, but the exponent of the long-time tail is definitely not in agreement with the SD equations for \u03bc<0.15. We have performed the same analysis for N\u00bc11 and N \u00bc 13, which shows a similar behavior of GLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de. To obtain a better understanding of the discrepancy between the long-time tail of the Green\u2019s function obtained from the SD equations and from exact diagonalization, we plot in Fig. 8 both the ensemble average of the Green\u2019s function (black curve) and the ensemble average of the absolute value of the Green\u2019s function (dashed black curve). For \u03bc < 0.15we observe large cancellations in the ensemble average of the Green\u2019s function, which increases the range of the initial exponential decay. The exponent of the long-time tail is not affected by these cancellations and remains equal to the exponent of the tail of the ensemble average of the absolute value of the Green\u2019s functions. The cancellations are strongest when \u03bc \u2248 0.075 and decrease both for smaller and larger values of \u03bc. They are absent for \u03bc > 0.175.\n106006-22\n106006-23\nThe\u03bc dependence of the initial exponent (red curve), denoted byEg, and the long-time exponent (green curve), denoted by E0g, for N \u00bc 9 are shown in Fig. 9. The gap is obtained by fitting exp\u00f0\u2212Eg\u03c4\u00de to the initial decay (green line in Fig. 8). For the decay rate of the long-time tail, we fit exp\u00f0\u2212E0g\u03c4\u00de (red line in Fig. 8) to the numerically obtained long-time tail of GLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de. Also shown is the result obtained from the solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equations (black curve). We observe that the result for the Schwinger-Dyson equations is in qualitative agreement with the exponent of the initial decay rate. For small \u03bc, the gap in the spectrum is well defined and is given by (see green line in Fig. 9)\n\u0394 \u00bc E1 \u2212 E0 \u00bc 4\u03bc: \u00f0E27\u00de\nThe finite-N numerical results for the long-time tail are in good agreement with this analytical prediction, but we did not find solutions of the SD equations with this behavior. Our finite N results show that the cancellations that take place for \u03bc < 0.15 increase the range of the initial exponential behavior, but it requires a very large ensemble to realize this. We expect that, in the large-N limit, this initial exponential behavior will become dominant. A detailed finite-size scaling analysis required to show this will be deferred to future work.\nAPPENDIX F: LARGE-q LIMIT IN THE EUCLIDEAN PROBLEM\nFollowing the method in Ref. [35], the SD equations can be solved analytically in the large-q limit at low temperature. The main idea is to solve the equations in small-\u03c4 and\nlarge-\u03c4 region with proper boundary conditions, then match these two solutions to fix the undetermined parameters.

Since the large-q interaction provides only a weak constraint on the momenta through the conservation law at each vertex of the Feynman diagram, Gab\u00f0\u03c4\u00de can be expanded in powers of 1=q around the free solution as\nGLL \u00bc 1 2 sign\u00f0\u03c4\u00dee1qgLL \u00bc 1 2 sign\u00f0\u03c4\u00de 1\u00fe 1 q gLL \u00fe\u2026 ;\nGLR \u00bc i 2 e 1 qgLR \u00bc i 2 1\u00fe 1 q gLR \u00fe\u2026 ; \u00f0F2\u00de\nwhich leads to\n\u03a3LL \u00bc \u2212 J 2 q e q\u22121 q gLL \u2248 \u2212 J 2 q egLL ;\n\u03a3LR \u00bc \u2212i J 2 q e q\u22121 q gLR \u2212 i\u03bc\u03b4\u00f0\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42\u00de\n\u2248 \u2212i J 2\nq egLR \u2212 i\u03bc\u03b4\u00f0\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42\u00de: \u00f0F3\u00de\nSubstituting the expressions for Gab and \u03a3ab into SD equations, and applying an additional partial derivative, the leading order terms cancel and at order 1=q we obtain\nsign\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u00f0\u22022\u03c4gLL \u00fe 2J 2egLL\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u00de \u00bc 0; \u2202 2 \u03c4gLR \u00fe 2J 2egLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u00fe 2\u03bc\u0302\u03b4\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u00bc 0; \u00f0F4\u00de\nwith \u03bc\u0302 \u00bc \u03bcq.

(F4) over an infinitesimal region \u03c4 \u2208 \u00bd0; \u03f5 , respectively. In addition, when T \u2192 0, gLL and gLR satisfy the boundary condition\ngLL\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u2212 gLR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u2192 0; \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e; \u00f0F6\u00de which will select the exponentially decaying solutions. At finite but low temperatures, gLL and gLR are not equal, and we need to solve theSDequations to find the relation between gLL and gLR.\n106006-24\nWith the above boundary conditions, Eqs.

In order to find the value of \u03c3, the SD equations need to be solved in the long-\u03c4 region. Note that Gab\u00f0\u03c4\u00de decays exponentially near \u03c4 \u00bc 0 and \u03c4 \u00bc \u03b2.
