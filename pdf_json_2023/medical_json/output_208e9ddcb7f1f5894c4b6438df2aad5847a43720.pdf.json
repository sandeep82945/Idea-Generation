    "abstractText": "Scleritis is a classical inflammatory feature of systemic vasculitides, including notably large-vessel (such as Takayasu arteritis) and small-vessel (such as ANCA-associated vasculitis [AAV] and urticarial vasculitis) vasculitides. In a large multicentric French study [1], Perray and colleagues recently reported 38 patients with clinically isolated ANCA-positive scleritis. Patients exhibiting other systemic manifestations attributable to AAV prior to, contemporary with or within 1 month of the diagnosis of scleritis were excluded. They compared these patients with 82 patients with \u2018idiopathic\u2019 scleritis (absence of ANCA, and no infectious or other systemic disease at diagnosis). Therefore, the difference at inclusion between these two groups is ANCA status. This interesting work raises several comments concerning the information provided by ANCA positivity, the concept of organ-restricted vasculitis, and the natural history and time-to-diagnosis for AAV. The study by Perray and colleagues [1] highlights the importance of screening ANCA in scleritis, after ruling out a systemic or infectious cause. Indeed, compared with isolated scleritis without ANCA, isolated ANCA-associated scleritis more frequently required systemic treatments, including glucocorticoids, and rituximab. It also exhibited a lower remission rate after the firstand second-line treatments. In addition, about one-third of isolated scleritis with MPOor PR3-ANCA (MPO/PR3-ANCA) evolved towards systemic vasculitis (mostly granulomatosis with polyangiitis), whereas none of the other patients (those with positive ANCA but no specificity and those without ANCA) did. So, in this condition, ANCA positivity and type have discriminating values, both for diagnosis and prognosis. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the discovery of ANCA was a revolution in the field of systemic vasculitides, as the identification of these autoantibodies simplified the diagnosis, making it possible to strengthen the AAV hypothesis over a few hours and rapidly start glucocorticoids, after ruling out infection hypotheses. Nowadays, the importance of MPO/PR3ANCA positivity in the presentation, prognosis and nosology of AAV is illustrated by the new (and yet debated) ACR/ EULAR 2022 classification criteria, which give these autoantibodies a prominent place [2]. However, these criteria are supposed to be applied when vasculitis is histologically proven, while ANCA positivity does not always reflect the presence of AAV. Before diagnosing AAV, a certain degree of caution is necessary, so as not to ignore a mimicker situation. In a recent study by Merindol and colleagues on 288 ANCApositive patients [3], ANCA positivity was linked to various diagnoses: AAV (17%), another autoimmune disease (34%) and another diagnosis lacking autoimmune disease (49%) (including 38 patients [13%] with infectious diseases). In this study, the highest value of MPO/PR3-ANCA levels (higher than three times the threshold value) could help to discriminate between AAV and their mimickers. In the case of isolated scleritis, it is important to bear in mind that an infectious cause may be present, in particular tuberculosis, which can also give rise to cor p-ANCA positivity, but usually without MPO or PR3 specificity [4]. In addition, the histopathological demonstration of vasculitis is exceptionally obtained by scleral biopsy [5]. Isolated scleritis can therefore be a diagnostic trap, and while ANCA positivity should be taken into account, its actual diagnostic value should not be exaggerated. In any case, the study by Perray and colleagues [1] provides important data on isolated scleritis according to ANCA status: mostly anterior scleritis with risk of scleromalacia, more difficult-to-treat ophthalmological disease, and increased risk for systemic AAV. According to the 2012 Chapel Hill nomenclature [6], \u2018single-organ vasculitis (SOV)\u2019 (such as cutaneous arteritis, primary central nervous system vasculitis, isolated aortitis) should be distinguished from \u2018limited expression of a systemic vasculitis\u2019. Both may develop additional involvements that warrant reclassifying the disease as a well-characterized systemic vasculitis. However, as stated by this reference article, clinical, laboratory and pathological features may help distinguish SOV from an isolated expression of systemic vasculitis. Thus, ANCA positivity is strongly suggestive of AAV and, consequently, ANCA-associated scleritis should probably be considered more as a \u2018limited expression of AAV\u2019. This does not mean that the vasculitis will or will not develop into a systemic disease. In their retrospective study, Perray et al. reported a progression to systemic AAV in 30.7% of MPO/ PR3-ANCA, after a median interval of about 30 months [1]. Among the eight patients involved, the extreme delays ranged from 4 to 65 months (see Supplementary Table S3 in the original article). So, the occurrence and severity of systemic onset varied, which may be influenced by the treatment of scleritis (local or systemic). An increase in CRP >5 mg/l at diagnosis was the only significant risk factor for progression to systemic AAV.",

As indicated above, the ANCA type has a crucial importance in clinical presentation and outcomes (higher mortality or relapses for MPO and PR3ANCA, respectively) [2]. The time between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of AAV may be several weeks, months or even years, with very heterogeneous features from one patient to another. This time-to-diagnosis represents a challenge for physicians, a dangerous situation for patients, who may suffer from acute and/or chronic damage, as well as an increased financial cost for health systems [7\u20139]. The longest inhospital time to diagnosis was recently reported in patients with non-generalized disease and ENT involvement as a presenting symptom [9]. Among 194 patients, the time-todiagnosis was 9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1\u201343) days in generalized disease vs 22 (IQR: 3\u201373) days in non-generalized disease. This delay was impacted by the diagnostic yields of biopsies (ENT [34%] vs kidney [86%] and lung biopsies [64%]), which once again points to the diagnostic approach to AAV, based primarily on anatomical and clinical evidence.\nWe can only stress the need for a coherent medical approach to avoid diagnostic pitfalls. However, all these findings irresistibly draw the main focus to the ANCA, as diagnostic biomarkers that also shed light on the pathophysiology, presentation and prognosis of AAV. Reading the article by Perray and colleagues [1], we are more convinced than ever of their special role, including in situations where vasculitis has a limited expression."
