The analyzed dataset was built using technical reports from surveys carried out in 152 buildings. Principal component analysis was capable of explain the interdependence of data variable and allowed conditions of understand the consequences and evidenced pathologies. Heavy vehicle traffic caused more damage (57% of buildings) to the studied buildings than the contact with the tailing mud (43% of buildings).",

            "text": "Mineral industry is very important to humanity, being responsible to the production of essential material for various human activities, such as: civil construction, agriculture, etc. Due to the growing of humanity needs, the ore requesting increased, low-content deposits began to be mined and the production of tailings increased. In year of 2010, the tailing production around the world was estimated in 14 billion of tonnes (Adiansyah et al. 2015).\nCommonly, tailings generated by mineral processing are stored in dams. These structures have reached large volumes and heights and its management became a geotechnical concern. A tailing dam failure can lead to human, economic and environmental disastrous consequences. The risk of failures is an apprehension of whole world and public concern about the risk and impacts of these structures growing since recent incidents occurred (Rico et al. 2008).\nDespite failures of tailing dams being a concern for several decades, Fund\u00e3o dam from Samarco\u2019s iron mine collapsed in year of 2015. More than 32.6 million of m3 of iron ore tailings left the dam reservoir, causing a large environmental damage, affecting 680 km of watercourses from Rio Doce Basin to the Atlantic Ocean (Carmo et al. 2017, SAMARCO 2020). The volume of waste and the extent of ecosystems affected assumed unprecedented proportions, involving the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The dam was built using upstream method and its height were 130 meters.\nThe failed volume of tailings caused the death of 19 people, destroyed buildings, houses and the infrastructure of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo districts (city of Mariana, Minas Gerais state), and Gesteira district (city of Barra Longa, Minas Gerais state) (SAMARCO 2020). Researchers analyzed\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2023) 95(Suppl.1)\nthe dispersion of the tailing in Rio Doce basin and the Atlantic Ocean, the contamination of reefs, the affectation of bee pollination, the dam failure catastrophe extent, among others studies of the large environmental and human health impacts caused by the Fund\u00e3o dam failure (Coimbra et al. 2020, Orlando et al. 2020, Guerra et al. 2017, Marta-Almeida et al. 2016, Quadra et al. 2019).\nDue to the impacts caused by one of the world large catastrophes related to tailing dam failures, this topic is still much discussed and researched in the last years. However, studies about the event consequences in terms of building pathologies were not found in the literature. Many buildings from Gesteira district were affected by the event, either by contact with the tailing mud or by the heavy vehicle traffic related to the reconstruction of its infrastructure. The tailing mud reached the district by Carmo river overflow.\nContact of tailing mud with building grounds can cause overloading. An overloading generates stress increase in the structure and it may cause masonry and/or structural elements cracking, foundation settlement and even building collapse (Watt 2007). The heavy vehicle traffic can be a source of vibration, inducing dynamic loads and waves, which reach the foundation of adjacent buildings (Hunaidi & Tremblay 1997).\nThis article presents an analysis of building pathologies caused by failure of Fund\u00e3o tailing dam. In Gesteira district (Barra Longa city), 152 buildings were surveyed, analyzed and used to build a dataset. The dataset was analyzed using a unsupervised machine learning, named Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Machine learning is largely used for data analysis and these tools started to be used recently in civil and mining engineering (Santos et al. 2018, 2019, Ali et al. 2019, Coelho et al. 2016, Kang et al. 2021, Qi et al. 2019, Paulo et al. 2020, Yang et al. 2021, Santos & Oliveira 2021).\nPrincipal component analysis was applied to the dataset to understand the interdependence between the surveyed variables. This knowledge allowed determine and evaluate the consequences and pathologies caused by Fund\u00e3o dam failure to buildings."

Second step included the dataset construction, using the variables collected at the field. Dataset knowledge was carried out in the third step. In the fourth step, the correlation matrix was defined and the non-significant variables were removed. Fifth and sixth step consisted of the application of Bartlett\u2019s Test and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), respectively. Finally, the seventh and eighth steps comprised the result analysis and conclusion of the research. Figure 1 presents the flowchart of the research methodology.\nDetermining of the qualitative and quantitative variables and survey of building pathologies\nWith the goal of analyzing the building pathologies caused by the dam failure, a technical survey was carried out in buildings from Gesteira district, Barra Longa city. In each surveyed building were identified its architectonic and urbanistic characteristics; structural system; pathologies; if the tailing\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2023) 95(Suppl.1) e20220458 2 | 21\nmud reached to the building ground; and the presence of heavy vehicle traffic correlated with the tailing clean-up.\nSurvey of building pathologies in this research was based on a visual inspection. According to the Brazilian entity, named Instituto Brasileiro de Avalia\u00e7\u00f5es e Per\u00edcias de Engenharia (IBAPE 2012), this type of survey is an inspection Level 1, which consists of an assessment with low technical complexity, normally employed in buildings with very simple or inexistent maintenance plans (case of the buildings located in Gesteira). Inspection Level 1 must to be carried out by qualified professionals through a visual inspection in loco.\nClassification of anomalies and cracks and their probable origin factor was carried out in the buildings through in loco inspection. According to recommendations of the standard published by IBAPE, the anomalies were classified as endogenous, exogenous, natural and functional (IBAPE 2012). Cracks were classified as operational, managerial, associated to the planning or associated to execution of the building.\nPathologies were also classified according to their probable risk level. They were classified as critical, medium and minimum. Critical level is correlated to the risk of causing damage to health and security of personal and environment; loss of performance and functionality, possible occupancy stoppage; increase of maintenance and repair costs and significant loss of useful life. Medium level is correlated to the risk of causing the partial loss of building performance and functionality and it does\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2023) 95(Suppl.1) e20220458 3 | 21\nnot cause occupancy stoppage. Minimum risk level is associated to a minor damage to the building esthetics or planned maintenance activity, without probability of critical and medium risk occurrence, and low or anyone reduction of real estate value.\nBuilding pathologies have various types, such as cracks, stains, displacements and deformations, among others. Cracking classification was based on its opening (tiny, medium and large). Cracks were also classified according to its possible causes in five groups: caused by overloading, thermal variations, retraction and expansion, excessive deflection of concrete structural elements and foundation settlement (Magalh\u00e3es 2004).\nUsing the presented guidelines, an inspection was carried out on 152 buildings affected by Fund\u00e3o dam failure from Gesteira district. For all buildings, qualitative and quantitative characteristics were surveyed, being subdivided into 19 variables, see Table I."

This information is correlated to the geographical position of Gesteira and Carmo river. The district is located in one side of the river bank (see Figure 2a), then a majority of buildings is located above the flooding level. They do not had contact with the mud. Considering heavy vehicle traffic, 84.0% of the buildings had in its surroundings (P2). Figure 2 (b) presents the traffic route of these vehicles, which coincides with the river bank and the location of the damaged buildings, respectively.\nA percentage of 69.7% of the building pathologies are endogenous and 30.3% are exogenous (P3). During technical survey, the identified architecture of the district was characterized by a combination of traditional constructive techniques (the city born in colonial period) and contemporary techniques. Moreover, the self-construction phenomenon is the predominant way of construction. It consists of constructive technical passed from generation to generation, which the building owner is the responsible by the construction, often without assistance of qualified professionals (Balthazar 2012). This fact can explain the high percentage of endogenous pathologies. Despite 69.7% of endogenous pathologies, dwellers of affected buildings attest that 90.8% of pathologies worsened due to the event (P5), showing the importance of the event in the increase of the building damages.\nPathologies caused by masonry expansion (P7), thermal variation of the system floor (P9), floor system deflection (P10), support deflection (P11), superior beam deflection (P12), structural deflection (P13), overloading (P14), negative bending in the sills (P16) were found in 5.3% of surveyed buildings. Considering the cracks caused by settlement (P6), 46.7% of the studied buildings presented one or more of this type of cracking. This value is greater than 37.5% of the buildings which have contact with the tailing mud. It can be justified by the high number of buildings with endogenous pathologies (69.7%). Probably, part of the surveyed buildings presented cracking before the dam failure and this cracking could have been worsened by the event.\nA percentage of 16.4% of the surveyed buildings presented detachment (P18), 17.1% presented infiltrations (P19), 27.6% presented cracks caused by thermal variations in the masonry (P8) and 47.4% presented cracks in openings (P17).

So, exogenous pathologies will have greater values of P2 and the greater the degree of risk, the greater the value of variable P4. Then, the closer themud is to the building, the greater the probability of generating greater overloads to the building, which can cause greater cracks by settlement, which are exogenous pathologies and, finally, increasing the degree of risk of the building.

Observing Table II, P1 is equal to 0 when the building do not have contact with the mud, P3 is equal to 0 when the pathology is endogenous and P4 have lower values for lower risk level. Then, negative values of principal component 2 represent the building pathologies that not are related to the direct contact with the mud (P1), but are related to heavy vehicle traffic (P2). The pathologies measured in P8, P13, P17 e P18 variables are fissures, which have endogenous nature and the vibrations induced by heavy vehicle traffic can cause increase of these fissures (this subject will be more discussed further in the article).\nStill evaluating principal component 2 (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc362), P5 (building pathologies worsen by the event) has a negative coefficient with smallest magnitude (value of 0.1 \u2013 see equation 8). Regardless of the origin of the pathology being due to direct contact with the mud (P1) or heavy vehicles traffic (P2), both were capable of worsen the pathologies, justifying this lower magnitude. The number of buildings with contact with heavy vehicle traffic (129 buildings) is much higher than the number of buildings that had direct contact with the mud (15 buildings), see Figure 3. Then, P5 has more relation with P2 than P1, due to the greater number of recurrence, thus having its negative coefficient. Finally, P5 has relation\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2023) 95(Suppl.1) e20220458 15 | 21\nwith P1 (positive coefficient) and P2 (negative coefficient) and, therefore, it has a lower absolute value in principal component 2.\nTherefore, the buildings with positive values of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc362 weremajority damaged by the tailing proximity (Tailing reached to the building ground - P1) and the associated pathology was cracks caused by settlement (P6) and buildings with negative values of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc362 were majority damaged by the heavy vehicle traffic (P2) and the associated pathologies were cracks caused by thermal variations of the masonry (P8), cracks caused by structural deflection (P13), cracks caused by negative bending in the sills (P16), cracks in openings (P17) and detachments (P18). Figure 4c-d present the histogram and pie chart of PC2 values for the 152 buildings.\nContact with the tailing mud cased damage to 43% of the buildings and 57% of the buildings were damaged by heavy vehicle traffic, see Figure 4c-d. \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc362 opposes the contact with the tailing mud and the pathologies generated by its overload (settlement) with the heavy vehicle traffic and the pathologies generated by vibration. Pathologies caused by settlement are correlated to driving forces greater than the soil strength capacity in the foundations and, it is knowing that, the driving forces are increased by the extra overload of tailing mud. The heavy vehicle traffic (trucks, heavy machinery and compaction equipment) has been could generate vibrations on buildings and, depending on the vibration level, fissures could manifest (Andrews et al. 2013).\nFigure 5 shows the graph of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc361 versus \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc362, knowing as a Biplot graph, where is possible to evaluate the variable interdependence discussed in the topics above.\nInduced vibrations in buildings caused by heavy vehicle traffic\nThe vibration level generated by vehicle traffic depends on the vehicle weight and road conditions. Irregular pavement roads, such as prismatic blocks or damaged roads, are those responsible to generate greater vibratory energy (Hunaidi & Tremblay 1997). Considering the type of the vehicle, according to California Department of Transportation (Andrews et al. 2013), the vibration caused by construction and maintenance equipment directly influence in the ground and, consequently, in foundation buildings.\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2023) 95(Suppl.1) e20220458 16 | 21\nPeak Particle Velocity (PPV) transmitted from vehicle to building is an index used to verify the influence of induced vibration of heavy vehicle traffic in urban roads given by Equation 12 (Andrews et al. 2013). This index is compared with the allowable PPV limit values of buildings, see Table XI.\nPPVheavy vehicle traffic = PPVRef ( 25 \ud835\udc37 ) \ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b/\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50) (12)\nwhere: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49Ref is the reference PPV at 25 ft., see Table XI; \ud835\udc37 is the distance from equipment to the receiver (building) (ft) and \ud835\udc5b is the value related to the attenuation rate through ground.\nAccording to California Department of Transportation (Andrews et al. 2013), the suggested value of \ud835\udc5b is equal to 1.1, considering the studied site. The equipment vibration originates near to ground surface, then the determination of \ud835\udc5b is not influenced by the soil type.\nConsidering the values of Table XII and the Equation 12, PPV of the heavy vehicle traffic used to clean up the tailing mud and reconstruct the district was calculated. A distance D equal to 2.5 meters (distance of the equipment gravity of center to the building facade) was considered. The obtained results are presented in Table XIII.\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2023) 95(Suppl.1) e20220458 17 | 21\nComparing the obtained results of PPV (Table XIII) with the allowable PPV limit values of buildings (Table XI), considering transient sources, it is possible to notice that some PPV generated by the heavy vehicle in Barra Longa city are very close to the limit values from old buildings and others are greater from fragile buildings. Observing on the results, it is possible to conclude that the heavy vehicle traffic may have worsen preexisting pathologies of the buildings, considering that buildings from Gesteira are old, constructed using self-construction techniques."

            "text": "Principal component analysis was capable of explain the interdependence of data variable and allows conditions of understand the consequences caused by Fund\u00e3o dam failure in Gesteira district, city of Barra Longa. Through the analysis, it was possible to defining the existence of relationship between the heavy vehicle traffic with the appearance of several pathologies related to fissures. Besides, the contact with the tailing mud, according to the analysis, caused pathologies related to settlement. These conclusions are expected of technical point of view, but the analysis provides way of determining the coverage of these consequences in the studied location. This type of conclusion would not possible through univariate statistical analysis.\nAccording to the obtained results of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc361, 7% of analyzed building were very damaged by the dam failure, where new pathologies with critical level of risk tended to appear on them. 34% of the buildings\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2023) 95(Suppl.1) e20220458 18 | 21\nwere moderately damage, where new pathologies with minimum risk level tended to appear on them. 52% of the studied buildings were slightly damaged, where preexisting pathologies tended to present minimum risk of level and were worsen by the failure event. Finally, 7% of building were not damaged by the event, where the pathologies tended to be endogenous and were not worsen by the event. According to obtained results of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc362, 43% of building were damaged by the contact with the tailing mud and 57% of them were damaged by the heavy vehicle traffic, which were validated by the results of PPV analysis.\nObserving the obtained results, it possible to conclude that the heavy vehicle traffic associated to reconstruction of Gesteira infrastructure caused more damage to the studied buildings than the contact with the tailing mud. Is result is related to the reach of the tailing mud, which were limited to the buildings located next to the river (9.9% of the studied buildings), whereas the heavy vehicle traffic occurred along several streets of the district. In case of future events with the same characteristics, the concern with the vibration level of heavy vehicle traffic involved in the infrastructure reconstruction must to be seriously considered, because they can be more harmful for the building than the mud flood."
