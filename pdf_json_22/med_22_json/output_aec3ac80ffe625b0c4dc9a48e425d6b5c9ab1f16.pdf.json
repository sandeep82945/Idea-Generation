    "abstractText": "Primary cilia play pivotal roles in embryonic patterning and organogenesis through transduction of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Hh). Although mutations in Hh morphogens impair the development of the gonads and trigger male infertility, the contribution of Hh and primary cilia in the development of male reproductive ductules, including the epididymis, remains unknown. From a Pax2Cre; IFT88fl/fl knock-out mouse model, we found that primary cilia deletion is associated with imbalanced Hh signaling and morphometric changes in the Wolffian duct (WD), the embryonic precursor of the epididymis. Similar effects were observed following pharmacological blockade of primary cilia formation and Hh modulation on WD organotypic cultures. The expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix, mesenchymal-epithelial transition, canonical Hh and WD development was significantly altered after treatments. Altogether, we identified the primary cilia-dependent Hh signaling as a master regulator of genes involved in WD development. This provides new insights regarding the etiology of sexual differentiation and male infertility issues. Summary Sentence Modulation of primary-ciliogenesis and downstream Hedgehog signaling controls Wolffian duct development.",

            "text": "The Wolffian duct (WD) originates from the mesonephros and is the embryonic precursor of the epididymis, a unique 6-m-long tubule in which spermatozoa acquire their motility and fertilizing capacity at the onset of puberty (reviewed by Hinton et al. 2011) [1]. In men, the proximal segment of the epididymis is mostly composed of efferent ductules, which are absorptive tubules indispensible for male fertility [2\u20134]. In mice, the most apical region of the WD forms the efferent ductules [5]. During embryonic development, the WD is subjected to profound morphological and molecular changes that convert a small linear duct into a long, convoluted and highly regionalized tubule [6]. Impairment of correct in utero WD morphogenesis is associated with structural and functional defects of the epididymis that eventually impede male fertility [7, 8]. As observed in other tubular structures, the elongation, coiling, and differentiation of the WD require a well-orchestrated interplay between epithelial and mesenchymal compartments [9, 10] mediated by several players, including androgens, inhibins (e.g. Inhba), transcription\nfactors (e.g. Pax2 and Pax8), growth factors (e.g. Fgf8) and Wnt pathway components (e.g. Wnt5a and Wnt8b) (reviewed by Murashima et al. 2015) [7]. Although never explored, the importance of WD primary cilia to the transduction of these developmental pathways has been suggested based on the impairment of in utero WD coiling and development following epithelial-specific deletion of Pkd1 and Pkd2 ciliary components [11, 12].\nThe primary cilium is a non-motile microtubule-based organelle that extends from the surface of most cells [13], and is composed of a basal body to which the axonemal extension is anchored [14]. The formation of this sensory antenna is dynamic throughout the cell cycle and involves bidirectional intraflagellar transport (IFT) along the axonemal microtubule. While the membrane that surrounds the axoneme is continuous with the cell plasma membrane, it is composed of specific lipids and receptors that potentiate the response to extracellular factors, including to the morphogens Indian, Desert, and Sonic Hedgehog [15, 16] (IHH, DHH, and SHH, respectively) (reviewed by Garcia et al. 2018) [17]. In vertebrates, both activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling\nic.oup.com /biolreprod/article/108/2/241/6917038 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\npathway and its basal repression have been shown to depend on the primary cilium [18]. Although Hh signaling is essential for the development of diverse embryonic structures [19] and participates in epithelial\u2013mesenchymal communication in fetal prostate and kidney [20, 21], SHH produced by the mesonephros is not required for correct WD development and differentiation [22]. However, a recent genetic study performed on a cohort of 430 male subjects indicated that mutations in the Dhh gene are associated with impaired development of the gonad, and male infertility issues [23] as well as with peritubar cell defects in the testis [24]. In addition, testicular tubule-like structures are formed in vitro under the control of the Hh signaling pathway [25]. These findings shed light on the possible involvement of other morphogens than SHH, i.e. IHH and/or DHH, in fetal male excurrent duct development.\nAlthough primary cilia and the downstream Hh signaling pathway contribute to the homeostatic control of adult male reproductive tissues [26\u201328], their functions at early developmental stages of the male reproductive system remain poorly understood. Herein, to gain insights on mechanisms involved in higher mammal reproduction, we used mouse WD as a model system. By using a combination of in vivo/in vitro approaches, we tested the hypothesis that the primary ciliadependent Hh pathway controls the regulation of WD/epididymis morphogenesis. Following the localization of primary cilia and Hh components in the developing WD from Arl13bCetn2 and Pax2Cre; IFT88fl/fl mice, ex vivo organotypic cultures of embryonic murine WD were treated with a blocker of primary ciliogenesis as well as Hh agonist and inhibitor to elucidate the role and the molecular response associated with primary cilia and Hh signaling during WD growth. Together, our results shed light on the role of WD primary cilia as mediators of the canonical Hh pathway, and as a master player in the control of WD mesenchymal\u2013epithelial cell communication and development."

For each of these treatments, dose-response studies and washout recovery tests were performed to select drug concentrations that were reversible and not detrimental to WD tissues (Supplementary Figures S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7).\nCilioD is an inhibitor of the ATPase motor cytoplasmic dynein [31] and was used to assess the contribution of primary cilia to Hh signaling in the WD by preventing ciliogenesis. Organotypic WD cultures were treated with 20-\u03bcM CilioD diluted in DMSO (0.3% in the final medium) in the presence or absence of SAG to evaluate the contribution of primary cilia to Hh signaling in the WD. CilioD control received 0.3% of DMSO in the final medium. WD cultures received one of four different treatments, as follows: (1) control condition (no SAG/no CilioD in culture medium; n = 6), (2) 0.5-\u03bcM SAG (n = 6); (3) 20-\u03bcM CilioD (n = 6); and (4) 0.5-\u03bcM SAG and 20-\u03bcM CilioD (n = 6).\nSAG acts as an activator of the G protein-coupled receptor Smoothened, and was used to activate the Hh signaling pathway by circumventing the initial step of Hh morphogens\u2013 PTCH1 receptor binding. The effect of SAG on WD development was investigated as follows: WD were isolated from E16.5 embryos and cultured in control medium (n = 14) or in the presence of 0.5-\u03bcM SAG (n = 17).\nCyclo is a steroid alkaloid that inhibits the Hh signaling pathway through direct binding to Smoothened. To assess the effect of Cyclo on WD development, WD were isolated from E16.5 embryos and cultured in control medium (n = 11) or in 25-\u03bcM Cyclo diluted in ethanol (0.2% in final medium) (n = 11). Cyclo control received 0.2% of ethanol in the final medium.\nImages of WD were captured under 4\u00d7 magnification on an inverted microscope (EVOS\u2122 XL Core, Invitrogen, USA) before and after each culture session. At the end of the treatments, WD were either fixed for subsequent immunofluorescence staining or immunohistochemistry, or snap-frozen for RNA or protein extraction."

The number of coils was determined by counting the number of bends forming an angle of \u226460\u25e6, as previously described [33]. The luminal area was determined using polygon selection and fit spline tool. Lastly, the extraluminal thickness was determined by measuring the mean of the distance of five straight lines from the external border of\nthe duct to the edge of the extraluminal space. For characterization of WD from Pax2Cre; IFT88fl/fl embryos, three and five WD for Control and cKO, respectively, were analyzed. For pharmacological treatments, measurements were taken individually on each side (right and left) of the WD and the mean was calculated for each WD pair in six replicates organotypic cultures sets.

Primary cilia were detected at the apical pole of epithelial cells (see Supplementary Video S1) and were found associated with mesenchymal cells from the proximal, median, and distal regions of WD from 16.5 days post-coitum (E16.5) of Arl13b-Cetn2 mouse embryos (Figure 1A\u2013C).

All quantitative data are presented as means and standard errors of the mean (SEM).\n(Figure 1E). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining for the \u03b1SMA protein, a marker of smooth muscle differentiation that is absent until E14.5 [21], indicated that primary cilia were ubiquitously found in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and MSC-derived smooth muscle cells at E16.5 (Figure 1F\u2013G).\nSince primary cilia mediate the canonical Hh signaling pathway in vertebrates in response to Hh morphogens (SHH, IHH, and DHH) [18, 46, 47], we investigated the presence of Hh signaling ligands in the WD from E16.5 Arl13b-Cetn2 and CD-1 mouse embryos. Considering that both IHH and SHH were detected in the adult epididymis [27, 28], we investigated the presence of these two Hh morphogens in the WD from E16.5 embryo. Although SHH was not detected at the protein level in our experimental conditions (not shown), IHH was detected and displayed a partial overlap with the Arl13bpositive axoneme of primary cilia from the proximal WD region (Figure 2A, and insets a, a\u2019). Whereas IHH was detected in all segments of the E16.5 WD (Figure 2A\u2013E), the signal was not overlapping with Arl13b-positive primary cilia in the median (Figure 2B, and insets b, b\u2019) and distal (Figure 2C, and insets c, c\u2019) segments. Although these observations indicate that IHH and primary cilia are predominant in the proximal region where they may be more potent, we have considered the WD as a whole to investigate the role of Hh signaling and primary cilia in its development.\nImpairment of primary cilia formation in vivo and in vitro has an impact on WD morphological features and Hedgehog signaling To investigate the contribution of primary cilia organelles to WD development, we first examined WD morphological features from E16.5 Pax2Cre; IFT88fl/fl (IFT88 cKO) embryo in which ciliogenesis is impaired [29]. In this model, IFT88 anterograde transport component [48] has been conditionally\ninvalidated in epithelial cells positive for Pax2 [49], whose expression occurs as early as E13.5 in the epithelium of the WD [12]. In E16.5 IFT88 cKO embryos, primary cilia were specifically deleted in the WD epithelium, but not in the mesenchyme (Figure 3A and B, and insets a, a\u2019, b, b\u2019). In addition, WD from IFT88 cKO embryo displayed enlarged lumens and thicker \u03b1SMA-positive (\u03b1SMA+) and \u03b1SMA\u2212negative (\u03b1SMA) mesenchymal cell layers (Figure 3C). Although Ptch2 and Hhip expression was significantly upregulated in the mesenchyme of IFT88 cKO WD compared with controls, Hhip displayed a decreased expression level in the proximal epithelium of IFT88 cKO WD (Figure 3D and E), as shown by RNAscope studies. These results suggest that primary cilia found in WD epithelial cells, at least in the proximal WD, are required for normal Hh signaling transduction and tissue patterning in vivo.\nThe contribution of primary cilia to WD development and signaling was further investigated in ex vivo WD organotypic cultures from Arl13b-Cetn2 E16.5 embryos (in vitro model). Following the pharmacological blockade of primary ciliogenesis with CilioD, a specific blocker of AAA+ ATPase motor cytoplasmic dynein [31], the number of primary cilia present at the apical pole of epithelial cells as well as the length of primary cilia found in all cells from the WD were significantly reduced (Figure 4A and B). This size reduction was also observed after treatment with CilioD in presence of the smoothened agonist SAG, an activator of the Hh signaling pathway. To determine if the presence of primary cilia was a requisite to proper Hh signaling in the developing WD, Hh activation was induced on CilioD-treated WD. CilioD pharmacological concentration was determined by drug response/recovery approach on WD ex vivo cultures (see Supplementary Figures S2 and S3).\nWith regard to WD morphological features, both WD elongation and extraluminal thickness were significantly reduced\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /biolreprod/article/108/2/241/6917038 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 2.

The activation of Hh signaling by SAG did not conteract the impaired development observed in absence of primary cilia (CilioD). This suggests that, in line with the phenotype observed in vivo, the presence of primary cilia organelle is a requisite to proper WD development. Furthermore, although the expression of both Gli1 and Hhip Hh target genes was significantly increased following Hh signaling activation by SAG (Figures 4D), impairment of ciliogenesis by CilioD prevented the transcriptional activation of these two genes, suggesting that normal primary ciliogenesis\nis required for the proper transduction of Hh signaling in the developing WD. This ex vivo organotypic model thus mimics, at least in part, the responsiveness of the developing WD to primary cilia-dependent Hh signaling observed in vivo.\nThe Hh signaling pathway controls WD elongation, coiling, and mesenchymal space extension ex vivo To further scrutinize the effect of Hh signaling on WD development, organotypic cultures of WD isolated from CD-1 mice were incubated with either SAG (Hh agonist),\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /biolreprod/article/108/2/241/6917038 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 3.

Furthermore, recovery assays performed 72 h after these treatments\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /biolreprod/article/108/2/241/6917038 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nindicated that WD development recovered following SAG or Cyclo removal, thereby demonstrating that the treatment conditions were reversible and not detrimental to WD tissues (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7).\nWD elongation, the number of coils and intraluminal area were significantly reduced following 72 h of SAG treatment compared to control (Figure 5A and B), suggesting a contribution by Hh signaling to correct WD morphogenesis. These features were associated with significant increase of the extraluminal thickness (Figure 5A and B), possibly due to the increase in vimentin-positive mesenchymal cells following SAG treatment (Figure 5A and C). The equivalent \u03b1SMA levels detected following SAG and control conditions suggested that the \u03b1SMA-positive smooth muscle cells layer remained unchanged following the activation of the Hh pathway (Figure 5C). Contrasting effects were observed on WD features following Cyclo blockade of the Hh signaling pathway (see Supplementary Video S2), which triggered a decrease in WD elongation and extraluminal thickness in addition to an increase in the intraluminal area (Figure 5A and B). These results suggest that Hh signaling is involved in the control of WD development.\nThe increase in extraluminal layer induced by SAG is not associated with a higher cell proliferation rate in mesenchyme Since the activation of Hh signaling induced an increase in WD extraluminal thickness and vimentin expression, we hypothesized that the activation of Hh signaling might stimulate cell proliferation in the mesenchyme. As observed by immunohistochemistry on WD sections, the cell proliferation marker KI-67 was detected in epithelial cells as well as in \u03b1SMA-positive and \u03b1SMA-negative mesenchymal cells in the control (Figure 6A). Quantification of KI-67-positive cells in the whole WD section and in the different cellular populations, i.e. epithelial and mesenchymal cells and in \u03b1SMA-positive and \u03b1SMA-negative mesenchymal cells, was performed following SAG treatment. No significant change in KI-67 detection was observed in the whole WD (Figure 6B), nor in epithelial and \u03b1SMA-negative mesenchymal cell populations after SAG treatment (Figure 6C). In contrast, the proliferation rate of the \u03b1SMA-positive smooth muscle layer was significantly decreased following activation of the Hh pathway by SAG (Figure 6C). Thus, a higher cell proliferation rate in WD was not associated with the increase in extraluminal layer induced by SAG.\nActivation and blockade of the Hh signaling pathway trigger major WD gene expression changes As the activation and blockade of the Hh signaling pathway promoted opposing morphological changes that impaired WD development ex vivo, we scrutinized the molecular components and pathways involved in these responses. To this end, we performed complete RNA expression profiles of WD organotypic cultures treated with SAG (Hh activation) or Cyclo (Hh blockade) and compared them with the control conditions. Wolffian ducts were collected on E16.5 and cultured during 3 days (72 h) in the different conditions. Principal components analysis showed a clear distinction between the overall transcriptome profiles from samples subjected to the specific treatments (Figure 7A).\nANOVA was conducted between the following groups: SAG vs. Control; Cyclo vs. Control; and SAG vs. Cyclo. Treatment with Cyclo showed a much greater effect on the transcriptomic profile than with SAG. Furthermore, since these two agents exert essentially opposing effects on the same pathway, the contrast between SAG and Cyclo was particularly enhanced (Figure 7B). For instance, with the same filtering stringency (i.e. statistical significance when FC > 1.5 and P-value corrected by FDR < 0.03), we identified 736 genes whose expression was significantly different between Cyclo vs. Control, 104 for SAG vs. Control and 1883 for SAG vs. Cyclo. The genes specific to each contrast were systematically studied with five functional analysis suites (DAVID, STRING, GOrilla, Metscape, GSEA, and Blast2GO). In this analysis, six biological processes were revealed in four of the analysis suites for SAG; these included morphogenesis and regulation of hormone levels (Supplementary Figure S8). For Cyclo, 29 biological processes consistently emerged in three of the analysis suites, including the regulation of cell adhesion, and cell surface receptor signaling pathway, with cell differentiation being the most represented biological process (Supplementary Figure S8). Finally, the comparison of SAG vs. Cyclo provided a total of 743 significantly enriched biological process terms, among which 22 were consistently found in four of the analysis suites, including kidney development, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, branching morphogenesis of an epithelial tube and regulation of Wnt signaling pathway.\nThe canonical Hedgehog pathway modulates genes and biological processes important to WD morphogenesis The comprehensive repertoire of genes modulated in WD organotypic cultures after treatment with activator (SAG) or inhibitor (Cyclo) of Hh pathway showed that 17 genes belonging to well-described Hh canonical target genes were altered, including nine genes (Hhip, Gli1, Ptch1, Ptch2, Gpc3, Foxf1, Hhat, Gli2, and Boc) that were significantly up-regulated following SAG treatment and down-regulated following Cyclo treatment, and three genes (Fgf10, Shh, and Pax2) that displayed the opposite trend. In addition, five canonical Hh target genes (Bcl2, Arl13b, Fgfr2, Cdon, and Lrp2) were significantly modulated following Cyclo treatment only. Overall, all the main components of the canonical Hh pathway, including Hh receptors and co-receptors, GLI transcription factors, and Hh-interacting proteins, responded to WD treatment with an activator and blocker of this pathway as represented in Figure 7C. Genes belonging to different major pathways have been clustered downstream of this initial response. Out of these, 261 genes are likely to be regulated by GLI factors according to the presence of GLI consensus binding sites in their promoter regions (see Supplementary Table S2).\nAmong the pathways altered by the regulation of Hh signaling in the WD, ECM factors, and major players involved in WD development showed important and opposite effects following SAG and Cyclo treatments. Within the ECM cluster, the expression of 12 genes encoding collagen alpha chains, integrins Itga4 and Itgb8, and fibronectin 1 were significantly induced following Hh activation and conversely reduced following Hh inhibition. In contrast, the expression of integrin Itga3, syndecan-4 (Sdc4), and Fras1-related ECM gene 2 (Frem2) was strikingly induced following Hh\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /biolreprod/article/108/2/241/6917038 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n/biolreprod/article/108/2/241/6917038 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 6.

Although Hh signaling is a cell\u2013cell communication system that regulates embryonic structures through the primary\ncilium, its contribution to epididymis development remains poorly characterized. Here, by using complementary in vivo and ex vivo models, we revealed that impairment of primary ciliogenesis and modulation of downstream Hh signaling result in defective WD coiling, elongation, and patterning. This occurs through the regulation of ECM components and key developmental genes, pointing to the maintenance of the Hh equilibrium as being of paramount importance during WD development (Figure 8)."

In mouse models, the contribution of Hh to WD development has been supported in a model where the ablation of Gli1 expressing cells impaired WD coiling and elongation [87]. Here, we also identify IHH as a potential driver of WD development through its probable association with epithelial primary cilia from the proximal segment of the embryonic tubule. Although this regionalized IHH feature in the embryo may reflect the differences existing between the rodent initial segment and the remainder of the epididymis at the adult stage, advance lineage tracing approach will be required to support this potential developmental link. This observation suggests that IHH binds to PTCH1 or PTCH2 ciliary receptors to control WD epithelial cell functions. Although WD development was shown to occur independently from mesonephro-derived SHH [22], the respective contributions of IHH and DHH morphogens to male reproductive tract development remain to be deciphered through complementary genetic studies in men and functional analyses from mouse models.\nOn/off Hh cues controls WD development through the regulation of the ECM and developmental genes In the present study, imbalanced Hh signaling triggered disproportionate development of the WD mesenchymal/intraluminal compartment in vivo and ex vivo. This tissular phenotype was associated with reduced coiling/elongation of the WD, as well as marked changes to ECM components at the gene expression level. The contribution of ECM to WD development has already been suggested from a microarray study, in which changes in gene expression of ECM components were observed in different regions of the developing epididymis, and at different time points (E14.5\u2013P1) [88]. This concept was further supported from studies on protein tyrosine kinase 7 (Ptk7) knockout WD that displayed an impaired elongation and changes in ECM integrity [33,89]. Given the opposing effects on modulation of ECM components in the presence of smoothened agonists and antagonists, it is likely that Hh-dependent ECM integrity is the major cause of impaired WD elongation observed in our system. For instance, the expression levels of collagen I-, II-, IV-, and VIencoding genes are strongly reduced following Hh blockage, and is associated with both an increase size of the intraluminal compartment and a reduced WD elongation. These features mimic the cyst-like dilatation effect observed following collagenase treatment on WD organotypic cultures [89].\nIn addition, other genes involved in WD development respond to Hh signaling treatment, including genes known to participate in pro/mesonephros morphogenesis (Androgen receptor (Ar), Gata3) [70,82], maintenance of the WD structure (Emx2) [74], mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition (Wnt9b, Pax2, and Pax8) [68,71,90], WD/epididymal patterning (Fgfr2, Ros1, Dusp6) [78\u201380,91] as well as in coiling and elongation of the WD (Inhba, Pkd1) [12,82], cystic development and epithelial neoplasms in adult epididymal tissues (Pax2 and Pax8) [69,73] (Table 1). The overall modulation of key developmental genes therefore identifies Hh signaling as a master switch of WD development and patterning. Interestingly, corroborating the results on the ex vivo model as regard to Ar expression level, the anogenital distance of newborns Paxcre; IFT88fl/fl mice was lower (data not shown) compared with control mice, indicating that the\nproduction of testosterone were probably impaired in mutants [92]. This finding raises new questions regarding the potential contribution of primary cilia and downstream signalings in testicular steroid hormones production."

            "text": "Although \u201ccanonical\u201d Hh signaling involves the contribution of the downstream Gli family of transcription factors and the regulation of target gene expression through GLIconsensus binding sites [86], some organ systems respond to Hh morphogens through a Gli-independent \u201cnoncanonical\u201d Hh signaling [93\u201395]. By investigating the molecular response of the developing WD to Hh cues, we detected a change in expression level of Gli1 and Gli2 canonical Hh target genes, in addition to Ptch1, Ptch2, and Hhip that contain GLI consensus binding sites in their promoter region. Furthermore, in accordance with the recognized mechanisms that link Hh signaling with the primary cilium in vertebrates [18], the blockade of ciliogenesis in both in vivo (Paxcre; IFT88fl/fl mice) and ex vivo (CilioD) models triggered changes in the expression of Hh factors as well as WD morphometric features. Although primary cilia-dependent Hh signaling contribute to WD development, other signaling pathways also mediated by this organelle could be involved in that response, including Wnt, Notch, and Hippo [96]. For instance, in addition to Hh signaling factors Gli1 and Hhip that were used as a read-out of proper Hh signaling activation or inhibition, changes in Wnt (e.g. Wnt5a/b), Notch (e.g. Notch3), and Hippo (e.g. Wwc1) related genes were also observed in response to Hh treatments (Supplementary Figure S10), suggesting that Hh signaling is the nexus of diverse signaling pathways. The role of primary cilia in WD development aligns with previous studies where invalidation of Pkd1 or Pkd2 that encode the ciliary components polycystin1 (PC1) and 2 (PC2), respectively, displays impaired in utero epididymal coiling [11, 12] comparable to our ex vivo observations, following the pharmacological removal of primary cilia. The same developmental phenotype was observed in epithelial-specific Pdk1 or Pkd2 knockout mice, suggesting that the ciliary PC1\u2013PC2 channels from epithelial cells are instrumental to proper WD elongation and coiling. In the kidney, PC1 and PC2 play a key role in the mechanical sensing of extracellular shear stress through the primary cilium [97]. It remains to be established whether mechanical shear stress or other signaling pathways such as FGF, Wnt, Notch, and Hippo [96] could potentiate/modulate the response of the developing WD to the Hh cue. Furthermore, Pax2 being expressed in the mesonephric ducts/efferent ductules, it is possible that an impaired luminal signaling coming from upstream the WD, for instance from the efferent ductules, could indirectly affect WD development in addition to the direct effect of disrupting primary cilium in the WD epithelium. For instance, an excretory function has been described across mouse mesonephric tubule epithelium as early as embryonic day E10.5 [98], and could potentially influence the luminal content and the downstream regulation of WD morphogenesis."
