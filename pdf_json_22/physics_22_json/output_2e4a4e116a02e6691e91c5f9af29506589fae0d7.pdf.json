    "abstractText": "Dark field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) is an experimental technique employed to investigate material properties by probing their \u2018mesoscale,\u2019 or microscale structures, in a bulksensitive manner using hard X-rays at synchrotron radiation sources. However, challenges remain when it comes to applications of this technique to examine low-temperature phenomena in quantum materials, which exhibit complex phase transitions at cryogenic temperatures. One such material is NaMnO2, which hosts an antiferromagnetic transition at 45 K that is suspected to coincide with local structural transitions from its majority monoclinic phase to nanoscale triclinic domains. Direct observation of local heterogeneities and this effect at low temperatures in NaMnO2 is an important step in understanding this material, and serves as an ideal candidate study for expanding the DFXM experimental design space. This paper details a foundational highresolution DFXM study, down to liquid-helium temperature and below, conducted to explore phase transitions in NaMnO2. The outlined experiment ushers in the evaluation of other functional materials at low temperatures using this technique.",

Introduction\nDark field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) is a\nnon-destructive bulk-sensitive technique that provides a high-accuracy spatially resolved map of an ordered material\u2019s \u2018mesoscale\u2019 structure [1]. These maps possess information about the local crystallographic orientation spread (such as mosaic and twins) and lattice strain heterogeneities. DFXM has been used to study structure-property relationships in a variety of materials (Refs. [2,3] and the references therein), but its effective use beyond room-temperature studies remains a challenge, particularly at the cryogenic temperatures frequently encountered in investigations of quantum materials [4]. This is due to competing requirements of low vibrations and mechanical stability, versus the operational demands and physical connections of a cryostat mounted on an X-ray diffractometer. Here, we demonstrate an advancement of this technique, leveraging a low-vibration cryostat uniquely adapted\nto an unobstructed horizontal-diffraction geometry, and detail a novel DFXM study conducted at cryogenic temperatures (see Figure 1). This experiment included collecting magnified-real-space diffraction-contrast images using a standard rocking curve scan methodology, with the unique benefit of in-situ cooling and heating. The range of temperatures achieved spanned 3.2 K to 300 K, which establishes an original approach to characterizing thermal phase transformations of crystal, electronic, and magnetic structures.\nIn DFXM, a real-space image is formed by\nplacing an X-ray objective lens into the diffracted beam. The objective, commonly a compound refractive lens (CRL) well-suited for hard X-ray energies, magnifies the diffracted beam and projects it onto a far-field area detector that is placed at the image plane. This provides a full-field image due to diffraction contrasts from a plethora of heterogeneities (e.g., twins, charge and/or magnetic domains, dislocations, competing phases, impurities,\nCryostat Assembly DFXM in Experimental Hutch\netc.) with a high spatial resolution on the order of 200 nanometers (transverse to a diffracted beam). A sample-to-detector distance ranging in meters enables high angular resolution as well, on the order of 0.001\u00b0. The use of an objective lens with a focal length on the order of 100s of millimeters, leaves space for a cryostat, discussed below, and other sample environments (i.e., load frame, magnet, etc.).\nNaMnO2 has gained attention due to an ever-\nincreasing demand for energy transformation and storage, requiring modern electronic and battery applications to exploit functional materials with exceptional properties. This field of research has recently turned toward layered sodium oxides, such as NaMnO2, for use as cathodes, due to their high reversible capacities and the low cost of earthabundant sodium. Its \u03b1-phase consists of layers of MnO6 octahedra separated by layers of Na ions that form a monoclinic C2/m crystal structure. Furthermore, its room-temperature electronic properties are complemented by a rich magnetic phase space at low temperatures. The MnO6 octahedra mentioned above are subject to a JahnTeller distortion, resulting in short-range quasi-1D antiferromagnet interactions that are eventually driven to three-dimensional order below the N\u00e9el temperature of 45 K. This antiferromagnetic state remains incommensurate with the crystal lattice until another transition to a commensurate phase occurs at 22 K [5]. The functional properties exhibited by this material are further complicated by a series of crystal defects (i.e., stacking faults, twinning, polymorphism and an Mn3O4 intergrowth presented in Figure 2).\nThus, there are several sources of meso- and\nmicroscale heterogeneities in NaMnO2 that can significantly impact its macroscopic behavior via local strain fields, spatial variance, and lattice rotation, making DFXM an ideal probe. DFXM has been used to identify individual dislocations and the strain fields around them [6-8]; a DFXM study of crystal defects in steel (twinning, stacking faults, precipitates, etc.), identified defect features in the collected images [9].\nIn NaMnO2, twin populations have been\ncorrelated to its electrochemical potential [10], while the native strains induced from twinning in a similar Ni- or Co- doped sodium manganese oxide have been linked to its failure during high-voltage charge cycling [11]. Additionally, a structural transition from a monoclinic to triclinic crystal structure has\nbeen postulated to occur locally within NaMnO2 at 45 K [12], but the effect is subtle and a lack of spatial resolution leaves this question largely unanswered. These examples highlight the need for highaccuracy, spatially resolved measurements to better understand hierarchical structural complexity and its impact on the functional behavior of NaMnO2. In particular, the impact of the low-temperature magneto-structural transition of NaMnO2 on its structural complexity is the focus of this work.\n2. Material and Methods\n2.1 Sample Preparation\nThe single-crystal NaMnO2 sample was\ngrown using the floating zone technique [13] and characterized previously using neutron scattering [5,14,15]. The high angular resolution of DFXM requires knowledge of the sample orientation prior to the experiment. As determined via Laue diffraction, NaMnO2 forms a facet during growth along the (- 101) lattice plane, which serves as a cleavage plane during sample preparation, with the short b-axis extending parallel to the growth direction. The sample was cleaved along this plane and cut to a size\nof approximately 20 mm x 3 mm x 2 mm for the room temperature survey and 6 mm x 2 mm x 0.1 mm for the low temperature experiment.\nSolid-state nuclear magnetic resonance\n(ssNMR) experiments conducted previously on samples grown using this method estimate the population of stacking faults and \u03b2-phase content with reference to the primary \u03b1-phase. The sample used here derived its Na content from approximately 96% \u03b1-phase, 4% stacking fault regions and < 1% \u03b2phase [13]. The relatively low \u03b2-phase content of the sample enabled our DFXM study to focus primarily on the effects of twinning and stacking faults within the majority \u03b1-phase. However, the additional presence of Mn3O4 intergrowths, albeit minute, may contribute to diffraction contrast, creating difficulty in uniquely identifying some defects.\nThe sample was glued to a sample mount\nusing GE varnish (see Figure 1) with its (2,0,-2) reciprocal lattice vector oriented in the horizontal scattering plane for a reflection geometry. It was then positioned and aligned with the X-ray beam center using a video microscope unit (VMU), configured with a 10x objective and a 5-megapixel Flir CMOS camera, oriented with the optical axis aligned to the crystal surface normal. A single-photon-counting sodium iodide point detector was initially used to optimize the (2,0,-2) Bragg peak (2\u03b8=30.5\u00b0 at 10 keV) and to characterize its profile aided by lowtemperature cryogenic alignment stages (Figure 4). Once optimized, the point detector was moved out of the way and the diffracted beam was allowed to pass through an objective lens in order to form an image.\n2.2 DFXM Setup\nA DFXM experiment was conducted on a\nnominally single-crystal sample of NaMnO2 with insitu cooling using a state-of-the-art cryostat, discussed below. The experiment was carried out at 6-ID-C experimental station of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory.\nA monochromatic X-ray beam from a Si\n(111) double-crystal monochromator was passed through a pair of entrance slits forming a 300 \u03bcm x 300 \u03bcm square to uniformly illuminate the sample. Two types of X-ray objective lenses were employed in this work. A beryllium-based objective consisted of a series of 2D parabolic lenses, in groups of 8, or 16, to create a variable compound refractive lens (CRL), which offered a \u2018zooming\u2019 capability. For the low temperature experiment, with a large field of view (FoV), a group of 24 individual lenses were combined to achieve a focal length of 320 mm (10 keV) and a sample to objective distance (dobj) of 368.5 mm, resulting in an X-ray magnification of 7.6x at the image plane (dimg), 2,800 mm away from the sample. The CRL had an effective aperture of 300 \u03bcm. To achieve a deeper probe into the bulk at a higher X-ray energy (13 keV), polymer-based lenses with a short focal length (100 mm) [18, 19] were used for the room temperature survey (Figure 3). See Refs. 19-21, for details of CRL \u2018zoom\u2019-lens design and characterization using Talbot Interferometry.\nThe far-field detector consisted of an anti-\nreflection coated LuAG:Ce scintillator (0.02 mm thick and 10 mm diameter) that converted the magnified X-ray beam to visible light, followed by a 45\u00b0 reflective mirror, a high resolution 5x optical objective and Andor\u2019s Zyla 5.5-megapixel sCMOS camera, respectively. The far-field detector is placed at the image plane to capture data in the form of 16- bit, 2560x2160 pixel tiffs. The optical magnification combined with the X-ray magnification resulted in a 38x total magnification using the Be CRL for the temperature dependent measurements, and an 86x total magnification using the polymeric CRL for the room temperature survey. The native pixel size of the sCMOS is 6.5x6.5 \u03bcm2, so the diffraction limited resolution for these experiments were 170 nm and 76 nm corresponding to 38x and 86x magnifications respectively.\nTo enable low-temperature in-situ DFXM\nmeasurements, a custom-modified commercial lowvibration closed-cycle helium refrigerator (Montana\nInstruments, model s100) was employed. This cryostat provided several features: (i) a set of optical viewports for a complementary VMU, mentioned above, focused on the sample\u2019s region of interest (ROI); (ii) 12.5 mm tall beryllium windows on either side to allow for the passage of X-rays at angles of\nincidence up to 55 degrees and scattering angles up to 110 degrees; (iii) low-vibration (on the order of tens of nanometers) platform mounting; (iv) a base temperature of <3.5 K; and (v) a sample chamber sufficiently large to house a series of nanopositioning stages and goniometer. The cryostat was mounted on top of a diffractometer, using a vibration-damped optical breadboard, which is capable of sample translations in three independent directions and a rotation around the vertical axis (\u2018rock\u2019, denoted here as \u03b8) with an orthogonal circle segment (\u2018roll\u2019, denoted here as \u03c7), providing a horizontal scattering geometry (Figure 1). The rotational resolution of the diffractometer is 0.0001\u00b0 with a sample translation resolution, aided by optical encoders, of approximately 100 nm.\n3. Results & Discussion\nDFXM images were collected at each \u03b8 as it\nwas stepped through the (2,0,-2) Bragg peak in 0.002\u00b0 increments to obtain the material\u2019s mosaic spread, known as rocking curve imaging (RCI). RCI is carried out before microscopy to assess the full range of mosaic spread and to ensure that chosen region is a good representation of the entire sample. In Figure 4 we present a representative DFXM image (Fig. 4a), associated rocking curve (Fig 4b), and a derived mosaic map (Fig 4c) from a roomtemperature RCI, collected using a Be-CRL with an exposure time of 10 seconds per image. The intensity image Fig. 4a was generated by plotting each pixel\u2019s maximum intensity over all frames collected at a given location. Clear contrasts arising from slanted linear twin boundaries, mutually separated by a range of distances, are observed. Furthermore, nonuniform features are visible along the \u2018ridges\u2019 of linear domains. A Bragg-peak line profile obtained by a point detector shows a total mosaic spread of ~0.1 degrees. By integrating each image, a nearidentical line profile was obtained. The process of generating a mosaic map, as shown in Fig. 4c, involves mapping material points to individual pixels and comparing their intensity values over variations in sample orientation. As the sample is rocked, crystal domains with varied reciprocal lattice vectors are rotated through the Bragg condition, causing different pixels to illuminate. By finding the center \u03b8 value of each pixel\u2019s intensity peak, local regions can be labeled based on their deviation from the principal crystallographic peak [22]. The mosaic map in\nFigure 4c shows a gradual distribution of local orientation with an overall spread consistent with the Bragg-peak profile discussed above. These measurements, performed over spots shown in Figure 3, indicate that the sample does not have drastic changes in its mosaic distributions across its millimeter length scale. Therefore, it is expected that the results of the low-temperature experiment detailed below, performed on an arbitrary spot on the sample, are representative of properties of NaMnO2 in general.\nThe triclinic nanodomains are reported to\noccur below the magnetic ordering temperature of 45 K, with an additional magnetic transition existing at 22 K [5,15]. In this proof-of-principle work, we focused our efforts primarily on the structural\ntransition at 45 K, for which magneto-structural effects are likely to be less subtle.\nFor the temperature dependent experiment,\nwe used a Be-CRL with a 300 \u03bcm diameter field of view, while still resolving micron-scale features (see Figure 5) at all temperatures (3.2-300 K). The same region of the sample was identified through temperature changes using optical images, via the VMU mentioned above. A shallow depth-of-field (10 \u03bcm) combined with the high-resolution (345 nm per pixel) of the optical microscope, a similar scale as the DFXM images (see Figure 5), provides confidence that sample position was maintained during temperature-dependent measurements.\nA series of RCI was then carried out at\nvarious temperatures from 3.2 K through low-\nsize. In this case, images at both temperatures displayed a feature resolution of ~1 \u03bcm or ~6 pixels.\ntemperature transitions to detect any local changes in strain and/or orientation due to a purported structural transition at 45 K. These raw images were used to generate \u2018mosaic\u2019 maps, or maps of the spread in orientation of the sample at various temperatures. Mosaic maps generated from RCI, done before and after the transition temperature, are shown in Figure 6. There is a notable (-\u03b8) shift in the orientation of several regions as the sample is heated from 9 K to 52 K, indicating that the transition impacts the mosaic spread of the material at a local level, possibly causing an average broadening of the (2,0,- 2) peak.\nTo make our observations more quantitative,\ntemperature-dependent measurements, focused on this transition, were taken by holding \u03b8 fixed at the peak value and capturing images at a constant rate as the sample was slowly heated from 10 K to 52 K. The total intensity of the images was calculated and plotted against temperature in Figure 7. A logistic curve fit to the data is overlaid and shows a significant jump (20% increase) in the intensity of the total (2,0,-2) peak, centered on 44 K, spanning over a temperature range of ~10 K. It is intriguing that while certain regions are significantly affected through the transition, the rest of our FoV remained quiescent. The regions outlined by boxes undergo an overall 55% and 25% increase through the transition for the first and second ROIs respectively.\nThe magnified images show subtle changes\nin various features as the sample was heated through the transition, but it remains difficult to say whether these changes are direct observations of nanoscale triclinic domains undergoing a transition to the primary monoclinic phase. These effects may also be\nan example of a magnetoelastic coupling, which results in structural strain or rotation due to the magnetic transition. Additionally, the Mn3O4 intergrowth, mentioned above, exhibits a weak ferrimagnetic transition at 43 K [23]. We suspect that the intergrowth forms in stacking fault regions or twin boundaries. Thus, the transition from para- to ferrimagnetism could result in magneto-striction of the NaMnO2 lattice, causing certain regions to \u2018fall off\u2019 the primary Bragg-peak. While previous studies of this transition have measured powders, the spatially resolved images collected using DFXM on a single crystal sample give the first indication of local heterogeneities playing a significant role in the magneto-structural transition at low temperatures.\n4. Conclusions\nDFXM is a versatile and powerful technique\nto study spatially resolved \u2018mesoscale\u2019 phenomena of functional, structural, and quantum materials, complementing observations of \u2018average\u2019 properties using X-ray diffraction in routine use. The experiment detailed here is the first low-temperature DFXM study reaching liquid-helium temperature on a highly heterogeneous single-crystal sample at a third-generation light source, which enables spatially resolved studies of twins, dislocations, charge-order or magnetic domains through a wide array of thermal phase transitions. The outlined experimental procedure lays the foundation for the characterization and evaluation of other functional and structural materials at low temperatures.\nThe preliminary low-temperature\ninvestigation of NaMnO2 provided valuable insight into its possible structural transition at 45 K, which has been a challenge to unambiguously detect. We speculate that a \u2018phase transformation\u2019 might be taking place in privileged regions within an intertwined hierarchy of three-dimensional structural and phase heterogeneities spanning a wide range of length scales. This is consistent with significant local changes observed herein. More comprehensive DFXM studies of spatially resolved strain as a function of temperature may indicate a mechanism for intensity step through transition. Furthermore, complementary imaging methods [24, 25] such as high-energy diffraction microscopy performed on the specimen, may isolate and identify these active regions susceptible to this transition.\nData Availability\nThe raw/processed data required to reproduce\nthese findings cannot be shared at this time as the\ndata also forms part of an ongoing study.\nAcknowledgments\nThe research reported here was supported by\nthe National Science Foundation (NSF) Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at UC Santa Barbara (NSF DMR 1720256) through IRG-1.
