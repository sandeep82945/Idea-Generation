    "abstractText": "There is a scarcity of knowledge regarding the potential benefits of human\u2013nature contact within the context of working life. Even more limited is the research that focuses on working outdoors and the setting in which it takes place. This study aimed to obtain insight into key aspects of the physical environment relevant for the experienced benefits and challenges of workers exploring office work outdoors. We conducted interviews with key informants as well as photo registration and mapping of the different green spaces in the environments of six small or medium-sized workplaces. The information gathered was used as background knowledge for exploratory qualitative interviews, which were conducted while walking in natural settings chosen by the interviewees. With a landscape architectural perspective and an inductive approach, we explored employees\u2019 experiences of bringing office work outdoors. The following themes emerged: \u2018Simplicity,\u2019 \u2018Safeness\u2019, \u2018Comfort\u2019, and \u2018Contact with Nature\u2019 were experienced as key aspects in relation to the physical environment, whereas \u2018Sociality\u2019, \u2018Well-being\u2019, and \u2018Functioning\u2019 stood out as the main benefits and, \u2018Digital dependency\u2019 and \u2018Illegitimacy\u2019 as challenges to overcome. Based on the identification of potential benefits and their prerequisites, we propose implications for practice and research that can be useful when focusing on bringing office work outdoors.",

Research within a multitude of scientific disciplines points towards the importance and potential benefits of human\u2013nature contact [2]. The body of knowledge about the restorative effects of greenspace is comprehensive, both regarding stress reduction and mental fatigue, the prevention of depression, and the enhancement of people\u2019s mood and vitality [3\u20135]. Across various fields, there is a consensus regarding the value and impact of nature experiences on mental health, including emotional well-being and cognitive functioning [6]. In addition to these and other dimensions related to health\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6689. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20176689 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6689 2 of 19\nand well-being, there are several other potentially beneficial perspectives to consider when investigating a greenspace as a workplace. Notably, there is a growing body of research on the potential of the outdoors to foster creativity [7] and facilitate learning [8]. Furthermore, there are several significant environmental factors, including natural sights, natural sounds and negative air ions. Exposure to these factors can contribute to various positive physiological and psychological states, such as relaxation, vitality and attention restoration. Exposure to the mentioned factors can also lead to positive health outcomes, including a decreased prevalence of cancer, cardiovascular disease and depression [2]. The positive association between exposure to natural environments and health and well-being is evident even with the rather crude measure of time, without taking the type of activity or various contextual conditions into account. In a study involving nearly 20,000 Britons who were asked about the time they spent in natural environments over the past seven days, the results showed that people were significantly more likely to report good health or well-being if they had spent more than 120 min in natural environments. The positive associations peaked at 200\u2013300 min per week, and this was true regardless of whether the time was spent in many short or few longer periods [9]. In another study, a scoping review of college-aged adults\u2019 time spent sitting or walking in nature revealed beneficial effects on their mental health after as little as 10\u201320 min [10]. The possible pathways are numerous and, so far, not fully understood [11,12]. The objective of the subsequent paragraphs is to assess the existing body of research, with a specific emphasis on identifying the key variables that influence the implementation of outdoor office work."

            "text": "Despite much evidence of positive relations between exposure to natural elements and human well-being and health in general [2], as well as the more specific topics of mental health [6], stress reduction [13,14], attention restoration [15], cognitive performance [16], creativity [7], and learning [8], research relating this knowledge to the area of working life has been scarce until recently. However, research conducted in the context of the workplace has shown that greenery can contribute to lower levels of stress, as well as to a more positive attitude towards the workplace [17]. When addressed, it is often from the point of view of the indoor environment\u2014and its connection to the outdoors. Several studies have shown that a window view of natural elements or environments (e.g., trees, lawns, shrubs, or flowering plants) at the workplace can have a positive impact on the well-being of employees [18\u201320]. Moreover, it can affect job satisfaction positively [21\u201324] and lower employees\u2019 stress levels [20,25,26]. Consistent with this, Lottrup et al. [27] found that a view of a green outdoor environment from inside the workplace was associated with high workability. Moreover, if employees take breaks in a green outdoor environment, their stress levels are significantly lower than if they stay indoors [28]. Such breaks may also contribute to improving the employee\u2019s quality of life in general [29]. However, there may be significant advantages to not only having a \u201cgreen window\u201d or taking outdoor breaks, but also moving work outside. Research studies indicate that exposure to natural elements and environments can lead to increased attention and improved cognitive performance in solving various tasks [30\u201334], as well as enhanced alertness [26]. The use of green space for tasks can furthermore have a positive effect on creativity [35] and can impact employees\u2019 enthusiasm and satisfaction with work [36]. In summary, there are a multitude of positive effects associated with bringing work out into green surroundings. Several theories have been proposed to elucidate these findings, with the most prominent theories being elaborated below."

            "text": "Among theories explaining the benefits of being in contact with natural environments, one of the most influential is the Attention Restoration Theory [37]. It suggests that some\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6689 3 of 19\nenvironments require attentional effort which can lead to mental fatigue while others allow attentional rest and restoration. The theory further suggests that the restorative environments have four essential characteristics that are likely to be found in natural settings. These are \u2018fascination\u2019, \u2018being away\u2019, \u2018extent\u2019 and \u2018compatibility\u2019. Fascination is what happens when experiencing a sunset or the movement of leaves in a slight breeze, stimuli that calls for involuntary attention, and which allows both reflection and recovery. Being away implies that you leave the activities that require attentional effort and that you find escape or withdrawal from mental effort and nuisance. Extent refers to the sense of being in a completely different world, a setting that gives the experience of connectedness and scope. Finally, compatibility is where one\u2019s purpose fits the demands of the setting and where you find the facilities and information needed for action. Another theory relevant to understanding preferences for certain features of natural environments is the Prospect\u2013Refuge Theory [38]. It claims that humans prefer landscapes that afford good scope for both refuge and prospect compared to landscapes that have neither. Refuge is about the opportunity to hide, and prospect implies an unhindered opportunity to see. The preference is linked to an apparent potential in landscapes to satisfy many of our biological needs, such as food, rest, and escaping danger [38]. Both the four characteristics that are important for a restorative experience and the preference for landscapes that afford both prospect and refuge can be useful when studying preferences for natural environments and, in this context, outdoor settings for office work."

            "heading": "1.4. The Significance of the Outdoor Setting",
            "text": "Although research studies have addressed the benefits of exposure to natural elements and environments at workplaces [18,20,27,28,30], there is only a little focus on issues related to working outdoors and which settings the workers prefer. Access to green space, such as a roof terrace or a park in the city, has until recently been scarce in the leading architectural literature about office spaces [39\u201342]. The focus in office spaces is primarily on the creation of different kinds of spaces and facilities supporting the activity of the office, such as spaces for brainstorming, lounges and quiet rooms. Grangaard [43] criticized this literature for the lack of focus on the connections and shifts between activities and spaces. However, in a recent literature study, Hu et al. [44] focused upon knowledge workers and the relation between landscape preference and health benefits from a theoretical perspective. They proposed four theoretical mechanisms which may promote the health of knowledge workers: stress reduction, attention restoration and landscape preference, physical activities promotion and sensory enrichment. In addition, they identified 29 key characteristics of restorative environments that can promote knowledge workers\u2019 well-being and health, for example \u2018being away\u2019, \u2018complexity\u2019, \u2018safety\u2019, \u2018deflected vistas\u2019, \u2018legibility\u2019 and \u2018compatibility\u2019. Hu et al. [44] pointed to the importance of further interdisciplinary research, including empirical studies such as interviews and on-site observations. In the interactive research project \u2018StickUt Malm\u00f6\u2019, the potential benefits and challenges of bringing work, traditionally conducted indoors, outdoors, were explored [45]. The findings showed that many different work activities could be taken outdoors in a variety of ways, both individually and in collaboration with others. The participants (58 civil servants from the City of Malm\u00f6) associated their outdoor work with many positive experiences, such as a sense of well-being, enhanced cognition, recovery from stress, autonomy and better communication and social relations. Feelings of guilt and illegitimacy were, however, also prevalent. Apart from the importance of supporting workplace culture and leadership, it was evident that easy access to greenspaces and pedestrian paths were crucial for outdoor office work to occur and function well [46]. The studies cited in this paper have provided valuable insights into the positive effects of spending time in natural environments on mental health, job satisfaction and cognitive performance. However, they have not fully explored the specific requirements and preferences for outdoor settings in the context of office work. To bridge this gap and to advance knowledge in the field of outdoor office work, the project Pop out! was\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6689 4 of 19\ndeveloped. Inspired by the Stick Ut project [47], the Pop out! project seeks to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the prerequisites and preferences related to outdoor office work. We explored employees\u2019 experiences of taking work outdoors in different types of greenspaces, investigating the challenges of going outside as well as the relationships between employees\u2019 work tasks, outdoor settings and experiences. Understanding the relationships and experiences will help identify key factors for successful implementation and inform landscape architectural interventions. This knowledge is important for creating work environments that may promote well-being, enhance productivity and offer a positive alternative to traditional indoor office spaces. Thus, the purpose of this study was to gain further insight into key aspects of the physical environment relevant for the experienced benefits and challenges of workers exploring office work outdoors."

The sample selection criteria for the inclusion of companies were pragmatic and primarily based on the individual organisation\u2019s motivation for participation, a geographical diversification among the participating companies (to strengthen geographical representativeness) and an assessment of the individual company\u2019s scope to include a relevant outdoor environment that both created variety between the participating companies and ensured varied experiences. Employees were invited to attend a process of identifying tasks from their indoor office work and bringing them outdoors. For two months, different types of outdoor activities related to work were facilitated by process consultants with specific knowledge in mental health, organisational change, and outdoor office work. Three 45 min meetings were held: A kick off meeting, a webinar and a workshop at the end of the intervention.

The interviewer was the same person who had carried out the research of the first phase of this study\u2013a researcher within the field of landscape architecture with expertise in connections between human health, nature, and design. The interviews were carried out while walking through the different greenspaces, which the interviewees had used during the active testing. The walkand-talk also included a photo registration of the outdoor settings discussed during the walk. The eight interviews lasted approximately 30 min each and were semi-structured [49], covering several topics of conversation. The topics revolved around their use of greenspace for work, positive and negative aspects, needs and preferences for settings and activities, as well as benefits and challenges of working outdoors. The topics were designed to capture the nuances and breadth of experiences in conducting work outside. Conducting the interview in the outdoor setting gave the interviewer a good understanding of the connections between the experiences discussed and their relation to specific aspects of the physical environment. The photo registration helped capture these connections. The seven stages of an interview inquiry described by Kvale and Brinkmann [50] assisted in the planning of the interview study. The recordings from the interviews were transcribed and analysed. Thematic analysis [51] was used to analyse the transcriptions in connection with the data from the photo registration and phase one. The focus was on relating the interviewees\u2019 statements to the specific greenspaces they talked about, bringing into play the information gained through the registration of their outdoor environment. The thematic analysis was driven by the search for issues related to going outside, as well as the relations between employees\u2019 work tasks, outdoor settings, and experiences. The steps of the analysis were as follows: getting to know the data, generating initial codes, identifying themes, reviewing themes, naming themes, and writing up themes [51]."

Themes The following themes emerged through the thematic analysis, highlighting various benefits and challenges with regards to bringing office work outdoors. Additionally, the themes help identify the significant features and types of settings necessary for successfully establishing and maintaining outdoor office work environments.\n3.2.1. Simplicity In one way or another, interviewees talked about the importance of it being easy to take work outside (1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6a). To provide an example, Interviewee 3 emphasised the need for simplicity and minimal planning in relation to working outdoors. Interviewees mentioned that the successful solutions included those that were quick and easy, such as sitting out on a terrace to read, eat lunch outside, or take a mobile phone call outdoors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6a) (see Figure 3). Among other things, it was mentioned that it made things a lot easier if the outdoor area was close by: \u201cWhen the phone rings, I put on my headset and then I just open the door and walk straight out onto the terrace \u2013 so it\u2019s easy!\u201d (5a). In this context, Interviewee 5a pointed out that a paved surface was a deciding factor for her because then she could go outside irrespective of which footwear she was wearing. Interviewees also pointed out other things that facilitated going outdoors. For instance, for it to be part of their routine (1, 5b and 6a): \u201cI think it is about getting a habit\u2026a routine\u2026you know that when you have been outside taking a break, you're ready for the remaining four hours, right\u2026\u201d (1). Being able to easily adapt or choose their route in relation to the time needed and the task to be solved was also mentioned as an important factor for successful outdoor work (1, 5a, 6a): \u2026\u201dand the awareness that you can walk further and adjust the length according to your talk\u2026 because when you come back to the office, the conversation that you had outside always ends promptly\u201d. (5a) In summary, the interviewees talked about simplicity, in the sense that working outdoors should not demand too much planning or investigation of the outdoor environment. They preferred an accessible greenspace close by, a fixed \u2018going outdoors-routine' and information/knowledge about routes with a flexibility in length as factors that could promote working outside.\nFigure 3.

Safeness\nInterviewees described how they wanted to avoid having to watch out for and be bothered by cars and bicycles (1, 5b, 6a). In the middle of the walk, interviewee 5b suddenly said: \u201clet\u2019s go this way. . .it is much calmer here where we do not need to watch out for cars\u201d. Interviewee 6a specified that her favorite greenspace was a place where cars do not drive back and forth. In line with this, Interviewee 1 mentioned calmness and a minimum of traffic as assets of the route she liked and took daily together with a group of colleagues at lunchtime. Part of this route goes through a nature park and offers views to water, woodland and a common area. Interviewee 3 said that it was important for her that the space she was in felt cozy and secure. In relation to this, she depicted an urban park featuring benches nestled amidst greenery and strategically shielded from the wind. Similarly, Interviewee 2 described her preferred location as follows: \u201cI like to have a view but also to have a forest around me (see Figure 4). And then to sit in a sheltered spot. I like to be able to withdraw, but for it to still be open in the other direction. I guess I like that it feels like a cave.\u201d\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

The fixed time c uld also motivate peopl to get started on and res lve a task. In response to this, Interviewee 4 observed that the chilly spring weather had naturally put a limit on how long they could sit outside. One aspect mentioned by Interviewee 3 was that working outside had, in a way, given the workplace an expanded inclusivity in that it was possible for an individual employee to withdraw and get some air outdoors if the need arose: \u201c...the freedom it gives to be able to go outside\u2026I think that\u2019s quite important because we are all different\u2026it gives space to withdraw.

Well-Being and Functioning\nInterviewees gave examples of how going outdoors affected them (1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b). Among other things, they said that they wound down and became calm in a different way than they were indoors (1, 2, 5a, 5b, 6b). Interviewees also mentioned that their mood improved (2, 4, 5a). One interviewee, 5a, said the following about walking in the woods in her free time: \u201cYou can\u2019t walk in the woods and be angry! You just can\u2019t. I\u2019ve experienced being angry when I go out, but I always come back happy.\u201d Interviewee 4 had the same experiences in terms of mood, which also influenced her job satisfaction: \u201cSomehow it makes you happy. And when you\u2019re happy and have that chemistry inside your body, I think you just get new ideas more easily, and things get easier. Things aren\u2019t as heavy.\u201d Interviewees also experienced a shift in creativity (1, 2, 4, 5a). Interviewee 1 had only experienced this when she had time off work and pointed out that for her it could not be forced but came quite naturally when her thoughts were just allowed to flow, for example, cycling to and from work or on a run. In addition, an enhanced ability to concentrate was also mentioned as a beneficial effect (6b), as well as the pleasure of exercise (1, 2, 4, 6b): \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re just sitting on your behind all day\u2014it just gives you something. In fact, it\u2019s usually after lunch that we walk\u201d (2). \u201cIt\u2019s great if you can combine getting exercise with doing your job and getting some fresh air. Whether you\u2019re having discussions while walking around, or phone conversations, or you\u2019re sitting out having lunch, you know?\u201d (6b) (see Figure 8).\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

Several aspects were mentioned including calming down, improved mood, enhanced creativity, better ability to concentrate and experiencing the pleasure f getting physical activity.\nFigure 8.

Several aspects were mentioned including calming down, improved mood, enhanced creativity, better ability to concentrate and experiencing the pleasure of getting physical activity.\n3.2.7. Digital Dependency\nInterviewees also discussed hindrances. Interviewee 5b was restricted in getting outside because her phone was a landline and she sat in the reception. Dependence on one or more computer screens to perform one\u2019s job was also mentioned as a key obstacle to getting outdoors (1, 2, 3). There were also divided opinions on whether sunshades for computers work or not: \u201cWe bought these leather sunshades. . . It works but you must look through this tunnel and they are quite difficult to fold out. It can be challenging if you are not the patient type\u201d (3). \u201cI waited some time to get my computer shade. . .then I went outside to work and in fact I sat there for a whole hour. . .that was a great experience (6a)\u201d.\n3.2.8. Illegitimacy\nIn different ways, the interviewees felt ambiguous about bringing their work outdoors during the workday. For example, Interviewee 4 said: \u201cI like the route behind the lake house it\u2019s nice and there\u2019s a special atmosphere over there you feel very close to nature. You almost feel that you ought not to be there during working hours.\u201d Interviewee 3 had a similar expression of ambivalence: \u201cThere is probably something in all of us, even though we know very well that it is legal, and that the management wants it and that everything is good. Then there is still something in you. Either way, it\u2019s there\u201d. In line with these expressions, Interviewee 6a pointed out a need for reassurance: \u201cIt\u2019s this thing. . . that it is legal to do it. . . without any of your colleagues thinking \u2018oh now she is outside wandering around again\u2019. . . I think we need to articulate its legality occasionally so that we do not fall back into old habits\u201d. Interviewee 6b expressed the same need: \u201cThis culture where it is acceptable. . . you need to acquaint yourself with it. . .I mean that it is something that is actually allowed\u201d. Interviewee 4 also touched upon the challenge when she described how some staff teased those who took their work outdoors. She said that they did this because they thought the project was a bit silly. On the other hand, Interviewee 6b mentioned that the COVID-19 crisis had helped to expand the boundaries of what one can and cannot do in terms of where and when we work. To sum up, the interviewees\u2019 expressions relate to a sense of illegitimacy when working outdoors. Although the project had been approved and was supported by management, the interviewees still expressed difficulty getting used to the fact that they were permitted to go outside. This indicates that it can be difficult, on an individual level as well as an organisational level, to change rooted ideas about what is appropriate and inappropriate in a work situation."

            "text": "In conclusion, the presented themes highlight aspects of the physical environment that are relevant to office workers\u2019 experience of benefiting from doing office work outdoors. To briefly restate, the theme of \u2018Simplicity\u2019 refers to the ease of access to the outdoor environment, with convenient proximity to the office and established routines for going outdoors. \u2018Safeness\u2019 entails the absence of disruptive elements like traffic and wind. \u2018Comfort\u2019 involves the suitability of the outdoor environment for work, with a preference for favorable weather conditions or sheltered areas. \u2018Contact with Nature\u2019 highlights the appreciation for outdoor work experiences that encompass diverse encounters with nature. The theme of \u2018Sociality\u2019 suggests that office workers may experience enhanced collaboration and cooperation with colleagues and a more creative, informal, and inclusive work environment when the aforementioned aspects of the physical environmental are present. \u2018Well-being and functioning\u2019 capture the advantages of working outdoors in terms of im-\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6689 15 of 19\nproved mood, heightened creativity, and enhanced concentration, among other positive factors. Challenges mentioned by workers include the difficulty of performing tasks outdoors, particularly when dependent on computer screens, reflecting \u2018Digital dependency\u2019. \u2018Illegitimacy\u2019 arises when the organisational level does not explicitly permit or support the practice of outdoor work. The finding of this study therefore reveals several perceived benefits, including improved relationships and cooperation with colleagues, reduced stress levels, enhanced mood, increased creativity and concentration, and the opportunity for physical exercise. Several of these findings align with earlier studies that indicate that the sight and use of natural elements and environments can lower stress levels [28] and improve attention, task solving [30\u201334], alertness [26], as well as creativity [35]. There are some obvious parallels between some of the themes generated in our study and the characteristics of restorative environments, as proposed in the Attention Restoration Theory [37]. The concept of \u2018Compatibility\u2019 may be related to Simplicity and Comfort, as it implies that the environment should align with the desired activities and encompass the need for an easy and meaningful transition from office work to an outdoor setting. Similarly, the idea of \u2018Being away\u2019 can be linked to the theme of Contact with Nature, as it involves disengaging from effortful activities and environments. This is reflected in the interviewees\u2019 desire for a peaceful break from their busy and noisy office environment. With this said, there is a contradiction in the fact that the interviewees express a need to be away while at the same time taking part in what is effortful with them as they go outside. It may be argued that the interviewees exchange the tiresome aspects of the indoor work environment with a less formal and restorative setting and, in this exchange, still experience being away to some degree. The concepts of \u2018Fascination\u2019 and \u2018Extent\u2019 also intersect with the theme of Contact with Nature, where Fascination is seen in the focus on natural stimuli, and interviewees, who valued different qualities of outdoor spaces, expressed a focus on natural environments and sensory impressions. \u2018Extent\u2019 refers to an environment that offers rich experiences capable of capturing the mind, which aligns with how the interviewees described their preferred greenspace as a comprehensive and immersive encounter with nature. The theme of Safeness encompasses the need for a greenspace that provides a sense of security, like a cave with a view of open space. This aligns with the Prospect\u2013Refuge Theory [38], which suggests that humans prefer landscapes that offer both refuge and prospect. When comparing the findings to the theoretical study conducted by Hu et al. [44] on knowledge workers, landscape preference, and health benefits, several similarities emerge. These similarities encompass mechanisms and characteristics such as safety, pathways, biodiversity, and compatible facilities. Additionally, numerous parallels can be drawn to the results of the \u2018StickUt Malm\u00f6\u2019 project [45,46]. Both projects demonstrate that various work activities can be conducted outdoors, including one-on-one, walk-and-talk meetings, collaborative work with colleagues and individual tasks. Moreover, both projects highlight similar benefits, such as enhanced well-being, improved work ability, better communication and social relations. The issue of illegitimacy was also identified in both projects. In terms of the physical environment, both projects emphasise the importance of easy access to greenspaces, appropriate furniture, sun-/rain-/windshields and pedestrian paths as facilitating factors for outdoor office work. The project \u2018Pop out!\u2019 contributes with more detailed findings on different types of greenspaces and their features, revealing individual preferences for open or more enclosed spaces, the influence of sensory qualities such as sounds and scents and the connections between features in the environment and feelings of safeness, simplicity and comfort. These features include opportunities for prospect and refuge, minimal disturbance from traffic and availability of suitable equipment and attire, as well as paved and/or sheltered adjacent areas.\nInt.

            "text": "The significance of the findings in this study should be acknowledged in relation to the case selection strategy, which deliberately focused on interviewees who were excep-tionally informative and highly engaged. The companies were selected for their qualities with regards to greenspace, covering different types of natural elements and environments. Furthermore, the interviewees picked out were those that, among the participants, had the most experience working outside during the test period. Two of the interviewees were anchor-persons for project \u2018Pop out!\u2019, which added to their dedication to the project. In this study, the participants who were most committed to working outdoors and therefore selected as cases, were female. As a result, the gender composition of the interviewees may have impacted the findings related to the benefits and challenges associated with working outdoors. If the study had focused on especially problematic cases [48], both with regards to the setting and interviewees, results would probably have been different accordingly. In fact, a good share of employees at the companies chose not to participate in the study. This de-selection may be due to different factors such as personal preference for using the outdoors or an incompatible job function with regards to bringing work activities outdoors. Moreover, the test period was during a favorable time of year for being outdoors. Had it been in the two winter months, findings would most likely have been different. The purpose of employing an information-oriented case selection strategy, specifically targeting particularly good cases [48], was to maximize the amount of information obtained from a small sample size. The more outdoor experiences, with the more varied greenspace, the more varied information concerning working outdoors. The topic of this study is in its in-fancy and needs to be further explored. Transferability may be limited due to various contextual aspects such as type of business, employee characteristics, organizational culture, outdoor environment and climate [48,52]. Still, the findings of this study may serve as a useful building block for enterprises aiming at integrating the outdoors into an everyday working life."

Even more limited is the research that focuses on issues related to bringing office work outdoors and preferences for such settings. This study points to an array of both psychological and landscape architectural aspects to be further explored. This includes investigating the outcome of outdoor working in relation to creativity and health, the notion of the workspace in relation to shifts in activity and change of place, and challenges such as experiences of illegitimacy and barriers related to the outdoor environments. However, the study also suggests looking more into facilitators such as preferred settings, features and equipment, with a goal of identifying health design guidelines for supportive work environments that can maximize the benefits of working outdoors. These would be relevant avenues of exploration in order to study the ideal design of an outdoor adjacent construction specialized for outdoor work. It could also be relevant to further explore the design of settings that can foster different types of work, such as creative collaboration or individual learning, outdoors."
