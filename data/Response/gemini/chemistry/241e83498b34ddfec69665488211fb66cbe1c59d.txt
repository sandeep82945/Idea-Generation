1. **Investigate the effect of linker length and rigidity on the sensitivity and selectivity of peptide-based biosensors for other volatile organic compounds (VOCs).** The study focused on aldehydes, but it would be interesting to see if the same principles apply to other VOCs, such as ketones, alcohols, and esters.
2. **Develop a theoretical model to predict the effect of linker length and rigidity on the binding affinity of peptide-based biosensors.** This would help to guide the design of new biosensors with improved performance.
3. **Use peptide-based biosensors with linkers to detect VOCs in real-world samples, such as exhaled breath or environmental air.** This would help to evaluate the potential of these biosensors for practical applications.
4. **Explore the use of other types of linkers, such as non-proteinogenic amino acids or synthetic polymers.** This could lead to the development of biosensors with even better performance.
5. **Investigate the use of peptide-based biosensors with linkers for the detection of other analytes, such as proteins or nucleic acids.** This would expand the potential applications of these biosensors.
