    "abstractText": "Peptide-based therapeutics have gained attention as promising therapeutic modalities, however, their prevalent drawback is poor circulation half-life in vivo. In this paper, we report the selection of albumin-binding macrocyclic peptides from genetically encoded libraries of peptides modified by perfluoroaryl-cysteine SNAr chemistry, with decafluoro-diphenylsulfone (DFS). Testing of the binding of the selected peptides to albumin identified SICRFFC as the lead sequence. We replaced DFS with isosteric pentafluorophenyl sulfide (PFS) and the PFS-SICRFFCGG exhibited KD = 4\u20136 \u03bcM towards human serum albumin. When injected in mice, the concentration of the PFS-SICRFFCGG in plasma was indistinguishable from the reference peptide, SA-21. More importantly, a conjugate of PFS-SICRFFCGG and peptide apelin-17 analogue (N3-PEG6-NMe17A2) showed retention in circulation similar to SA-21; in contrast, apelin-17 analogue was cleared from the circulation after 2min. The PFS-SICRFFC is the smallest known peptide macrocycle with a significant affinity for human albumin and substantial in vivo circulation halflife. It is a productive starting point for future development of compact macrocycles with extended half-life in vivo.",

Pomerantz 2 & Ratmir Derda 1\nPeptide-based therapeutics have gained attention as promising therapeutic modalities, however, their prevalent drawback is poor circulation half-life in vivo. In this paper, we report the selection of albumin-binding macrocyclic peptides from genetically encoded libraries of peptides modified by perfluoroaryl-cysteine SNAr chemistry, with decafluoro-diphenylsulfone (DFS). Testing of the binding of the selected peptides to albumin identified SICRFFC as the lead sequence. We replaced DFS with isosteric pentafluorophenyl sulfide (PFS) and the PFS-SICRFFCGG exhibited KD = 4\u20136 \u00b5M towards human serum albumin. When injected in mice, the concentration of the PFS-SICRFFCGG in plasma was indistinguishable from the reference peptide, SA-21. More importantly, a conjugate of PFS-SICRFFCGG and peptide apelin-17 analogue (N3-PEG6-NMe17A2) showed retention in circulation similar to SA-21; in contrast, apelin-17 analogue was cleared from the circulation after 2min. The PFS-SICRFFC is the smallest known peptide macrocycle with a significant affinity for human albumin and substantial in vivo circulation halflife. It is a productive starting point for future development of compact macrocycles with extended half-life in vivo.\nThere are around80peptidedrugs on the globalmarket;more than 150 peptides are in clinical development, and another 400\u2013600 peptides are undergoingpreclinical studies1. In contrast to typical smallmolecule drugs, the large surface area of peptides allows them to interact with expanded binding interfaces commonly found in protein\u2013protein interactions, protein\u2013carbohydrate, and protein\u2013DNA interactions. These proteins, classified as \u201cundruggable targets,\u201d have been difficult to target using conventional small molecule therapeutics but many of\nReceived: 25 August 2022\nAccepted: 17 August 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G2, Canada. 2Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. 3Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA. 4Department of Chemistry, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155, USA. 5Ferring Research Institute, San Diego, CA 92121, USA. 6Quantum Intelligence Corp., 31F, One IFC, 10 Gukjegeumyung-ro, Yeongdeungpo-gu-Seoul, Republic of Korea. 7Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada. 8These authors contributed equally: Jeffrey Y.

Peptides are the smallest among the latter threemodalities\u20142 to 10 kDa for peptides versus 150 kDa for full-sized antibodies\u2014and they possess distinct pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. For example, biodistribution of peptides and small proteins inside tumours and other non-vascularized tissues is improved compared to full-size antibodies. Several clinical candidates (TH1902, TH1904, BT5528, BT8009, BT1718, MMP-14) capitalize on such improved bio-distribution2\u20134. Unlike antibodies, which remain in circulation for 1\u20133weeks due to the association with the neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn) on the surface of endothelial cells5\u20137, peptide therapeutics clear withinminutes to hours fromplasma by renal filtration. Fast clearance is a beneficial property in several therapeutic applications, such as imaging (e.g., \u201ctumour paint\u201d), radionuclide delivery (e.g., LuratheraTM)8, and in administration of shortacting peptide hormones. However, for the more widespread adaptation of peptide modalities in diverse therapeutic applications, it is desired to tune the circulation lifetime of peptides from minutes to hours.\nOnly a few peptides exhibit a naturally extended circulation lifetime: a therapeutically relevant example is a natural venom, 39-residue peptide \u2018exendin 4\u2019, with low renal clearance in humans (5\u20137 h)9. This peptidegave rise to the FDA-approveddrugexenatide for treating type 2 diabetes10,11. Despite favourable circulation half-life, modified derivatives of exenatide\u2014liraglutide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, and semaglutide1\u2014have been developed to further tune circulation half-life and other PK properties. The majority of peptides and small proteins have to be modified as well to increase their circulation time. Such modification could be divided into several classes: Class 1: increase in size via covalent linkage to polyethylene glycol (PEG)12,13, polyglycerol14, and other synthetic macromolecules. Interestingly, steric hindrance by these size-increasingmoieties alsoprotects against proteolytic degradation15\u201317; Class 2: increase in size via controlled oligomerization18; Class 3: covalent linking to long-living serumprotein (e.g., FDA-approved drugs albiglutide and dulaglutide, exenatide that conjugated to albumin and the IfG4 Fc domain)19\u201321 and Class 4: incorporation of moieties that bind non-covalently to serum proteins such as albumin22\u201325, immunoglobulin26,27, FcRn28, transthyretin29, and transferrin30,31. An important example in the last class is the lipidation of peptides to allow interaction with serum albumin. Lipidation has been one of the most successful strategies to prolong the half-life of peptides and small proteins such as insulin, giving rise to FDAapproved drugs such as Levemir\u00ae, Tresiba\u00ae, Victoza\u00ae, Saxenda\u00ae, and Ozempic\u00ae with extended serum half-life32,33. The improved properties of these and many other drugs stemming from their association with albumin mandate investigation of albumin as a carrier for therapeutic applications.\nAlbumin is themost abundant protein in plasma, with an average concentration of 600 \u00b5M and an average half-life of 19 days in humans34. The main mechanism leading to the long half-life of albumin and antibody are similar: both proteins interactwith FcRns on the surface of endothelial cells6,7. This binding results in transient endocytosis of these proteins, and as a result, they are frequently sequestered from circulation and protected from clearance. At physiological pH, the binding affinity between albumin and FcRn is low; however, the interaction under acidic conditions in the endosome is strong to avoid lysosomal degradations and recycling of albumin to the extracellular space5. Albumin is a versatile carrier of essential fatty acids and diverse small organic molecules34. Among all the longcirculating serum proteins, albumin is considered to be one of the most important targets because of its ability to interact with hydrophobic small molecule drugs and enhance their pharmacokinetic properties. The recurrent therapeutic success of rationally lipidated peptides and proteins35 fuels interest in rational development of small molecules as well as non-lipidated proteins and peptides that bind to albumin.\nMany FDA-approved small molecule drugs have an intrinsic affinity for human serum albumin (HSA). Targeted development of small molecules with high affinity for HSA has been a topic of research over the last 15 years (see recent review, ref. 25). Anti-HSA antibodies, nanobodies36, DARPins37, and other protein domains have been also developed. Such proteins can be fused to therapeutic proteins of interest to extend their in vivo circulation. Similarly, short peptides that bind to HSA could be used in tandem with therapeutic peptide or protein sequences to dial in predictable half-life for such therapeutics. Such short albumin-binding peptides could empower development of many future therapeutic peptides because they could be built into any genetically encoded peptide library (e.g., displayed on phage, RNA, and other platforms) to give rise to billion-scale libraries with predictable in vivo half-life. However, short HSA-binding peptides are scarce. A 31-mer peptide DX-236 (Ac-AEGTGDFWFCDRIAWYPQHLCEFLDPEGGGK-NH2) with a binding affinity of 1.9 \u00b5M was identified by Dyax Corp., and used to purify albumin (Fig. 1A)38. A 21-mer peptide SA-21 (Ac-RLIEDICLPRWGCLWEDD-NH2) with a binding affinity of ~0.5 \u00b5M to HSA was identified at Genentech (Fig. 1B)39 and subsequently conjugated to ligands for urokinase-type plasminogen activator22,40, Fab antibody fragments41,42 and small proteins43 to prolong their circulation half-lives. Heinis and co-workers developed a short heptapeptide modified by fluorescein isothiocyanide (FITC) and palmitic acid (FITC-EYEYKpalmESE-NH2) with a binding affinity of 39 nM to HSA (Fig. 1C)23, and the presence of both lipid moiety and fluorescein was critical for the binding of this peptide. This FITClipopeptide was fused with two different bicyclic peptides to boost the half-lives from minutes to hours23. Success of DX-236, SA-21, and FITC-lipopeptide, and other examples from the literature demonstrated the possibility of using HSA as a target for genetically-encoded selection to identify HSA-binding peptides with extended circulation half-life. Despite availability of generic lipid-based albumin binders, antibodies and protein-based binders to albumin, and small moleculebased human-albumin binders, there remains an interest in developing other classes to develop small peptide-based albumin-binding ligands with lower molecular weight23,39. In this work, we employ genetically encoded phage-displayed libraries of chemically modified macrocycles to develop albumin-binding mini scaffolds. To hone on the shortest possible peptide sequences, we employed a phage-displayed libraries SXCXnC, n = 3\u20135 modified with decafluorodiphenyl sulfone (DFS)44,45 where X is any amino acid except for cysteine (Fig. 1D). We hypothesized that a perfluoroaromatic linchpinmight serve as a useful pharmacophore and itmight be recognized by one of the binding sites of HSA similar to the binding of fatty acid; however, as we observed in the NMR studies and late-stage pharmacokinetic evaluation of albumin-binding macrocycles, the primary function of perfluorolinchpin is to constrain the discovered peptide macrocycle in a productive albumin-binding conformation. While perfluoroaromatic linchpin alone does not equip a random peptide with albumin-binding properties, the change in the shape of perfluoroaromatic linchpin is detrimental to the albumin-binding properties and in vivo circulation."

            "text": "We devised and conducted three discovery campaigns that used different library architecture and selection strategies. In the first discovery campaign, we modified the phage libraries of structure SXCX4\u20135C with DFS following a previously published protocol and confirmed that 85%of the phage library ismodified to yield octafluorodiphenylsulfone-cross-linked macrocycles (OFS-SXCX4\u20135C-phage) (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 1A)44. We performed three rounds of phage selection usingHSA coated to the surface of 96-well polystyrene plates as bait. In parallel, we screened the same library on polystyrene wells coated with Protein A (negative control) to distinguish specific HSA-binding sequences from poly-specific protein binding sequences\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5654 2\n(Supplementary Fig. 1A). In round 3, the recovery of the OFSmacrocycle library against HSA was 17-fold lower than the recovery of the unmodified library, indicating that the OFS linchpin contributes selection; however, the increase in round-to-roundphage recoverywas only modest. Despite depletion on protein A, the enriched population bound equally to HSA and protein A (Supplementary Fig. 1D). To mitigate these problems, the second discovery campaign increased the stringency and altered the immobilization of HSA between 96-well plate in rounds 1 and 3 and biotinylated HSA immobilized onto streptavidin beads in round 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Such changes to selection stringency led to 200-fold increase in recovery in round 3 when compared to rounds 1 and 2. The recovery of the unmodified library panned against HSA was insignificant (Supplementary Fig. 2D). The binding of the OFS-macrocycle phage library recovered from round 3 to Protein A, ConA, and Casein was 2, 14, and 300-fold lower, respectively, compared to recovery on HSA-coated wells (Supplementary Fig. 4). These observations suggested that (i) specific albumin-binding sequences had been selected and (ii) the binding of these sequences to albumin required the presence of an OFS linchpin (Supplementary Fig. 4). Differential enrichment (DE) analysis of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of all test and control experiments (Supplementary Table 1) identified families of peptide macrocycles that had statistically significantly higher (p <0.05) enrichment in binding to HSA when compared to binding to unrelated protein (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). DE analysis of the first selection yielded three consensus motifs: STCHDITC (1), STCHYIGC (2) and STCHANC (3) (Supplementary Fig. 1E) whereas the second selection campaign yielded consensus motif: STCHTIYC (4) (Supplementary Fig. 2E). Although the original libraries were designed as SXCXnC where n = 4 and 5, and the SXCX3C sequences exist in such libraries only as rare\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5654 3\ndeletions46, we still observed the enrichmentof these rare sequences in the selection. Intrigued by the preference for smaller macrocycles, we devised a third selection campaign that employed only SXCX3C libraries modified with DFS (Fig. 2A). We used previously reported biotin capture44 to confirm that OFS linchpin can modify SXCX3C library to 88% conversion (Supplementary Fig. 3).\nThe SXCX3C library has been used in our previous publications successfully using only one round of sequencing46\u201348. It was sufficiently small (160,000 variants) to be fully covered by NGS and copy number of each member of the naive library was sufficiently large to afford quantification of the selection by NGS and DE analysis. To maximize the stringency of one-round-selection, we replaced immobilized albumin with soluble albumin as a screening bait. Soluble bait minimized preference of multivalent phage for multivalent display of albuminon the surfaceand avoided anydetrimental change in albumin structure resulting from its immobilization on polystyrene surface. To mimic the complex serum environment, the panning mixture contained unlabelled milk proteins mixed with biotinylated HSA (BioHSA), His-tag fusion T4-PG protein (His6-T4-PG). After addition of phage, HSA and T4-PG were captured from this mixture with streptavidin or Ni-NTA affinity beads, respectively. Control selection employed the same mixture with biotinylated ConA (Bio-ConA)\ninstead of Bio-HSA (Fig. 2B). The captured phage DNA was liberated from beads by treatment with hexane, amplified by PCR (Supplementary Fig. 6) and analysed by NGS (Fig. 2B). A DE analyses of selections against Bio-HSA, His6-T4-GP and Bio-ConA identified significantly enriched (p <0.05, >3-fold) 85 hit sequences (Fig. 2C\u2013E, Supplementary Fig. 4); their pairwise amino acid clustering identified FF and other motifs (Fig. 2F). From the combined analyses, we nominated sequences SICRFFC (5), SFCPMFC (6) and SLCKREC (7) as hits and STCQGEC (8) as a negative control for chemical synthesis and further validation (Fig. 2G). In summary, three selection strategies against HSA yielded divergent binding motifs. Such divergence of selection campaigns is not surprising because protein immobilization, depletion and amplification strategies were different among these strategies selection. To compare the sequences from these screens, we synthesized a series of hits and tested their binding to albumin using a battery of biochemical assays."

Molecular dynamics simulation suggested the OFS-macrocycles and the PFS-macrocycles exhibit similar ground-state conformational landscapes (Supplementary Fig. 9). Poor solubility of perfluoro-aryl cross-linked macrocycles 1\u20138 (STCHDITC, STCHYIGC, STCHANC, STCHTIYC, SICRFFC, SFCPMFC, SLCKREC, STCQGEC) made it difficult to evaluate their interaction with albumin in aqueous buffers. To increase their solubility, we synthesized these sequences with GGKKK or GGG tag at the C-terminus. The C-terminal tags provided sufficient solubility properties for downstream analyses. Some sequences were synthesized with both tags to verify that these tags did not affect binding to HSA.\nThe unique fluorine handle in perfluoro-aryl-modified peptides made it possible to determine their binding to HSA using 19F NMR (Fig. 3A). In a typical experiment,wemaintainedpeptide concentration at 50 \u00b5M and varied the concentration of HSA from 10 to 100 \u00b5M (4). The broadening of and disappearance of 19F signals that correspond to\nfluoroaromatic groups indicated the binding of the peptide to HSA (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 10A). It was not always possible to fit a definitiveKD value to the binding response due to the complex binding behaviour and quality of the NMR signal. However, in an albumin titration series, it was straightforward to obtain a qualitative estimate such as the albumin concentration necessary to suppress 50% of the initial fluorine signal. After evaluation of eight sequences found in all discovery campaigns (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Figs. 10\u201311), we nominated PFS-SICRFFCGGG (14c) as the lead for further evaluation and PFS-STCQGECGGG (17c) as the negative control in further investigation.\nA substantial change in measured KD values resulting from subtle amino-acid changes inPFS-macrocycles highlighted that the binding is not driven by the perfluoroaromatic linker alone. The peptide sequenceplays amajor role. Alanine scanof 14c further reinforced this observation (Fig. 3B, C). We observed that R4A or F5A changes in 14c ablated the binding between the perfluoro-macrocycles and HSA. In contrast, the S1A and I2A changes resulted in smaller changes in KD of\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5654 5\n3- and 10-fold, respectively. The alanine scans indicate that variation to any of the four discovered amino acids in SXCXXXC sequence negatively affects the binding. Even serine, a constant residue in selection, becomes modestly important in albumin recognition as well. We titrated 14c and 17c against rat serum albumin and observed similar binding to rat and human albumin (Supplementary Fig. 12). We attempted to confirm the binding affinity of these sequences by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using SA-21 as a control39; however, a complex multi-site binding behaviour for all peptides obscured the accurate evaluation of binding affinity by ITC (Supplementary Figs. 13\u201315), and thismulti-step binding to albumin in ITC experiments has been observed in previous reports49. The 19F NMR assay, thus, was critically enabling for validation and ranking of the albumin binding leads.\nA fluorescence polarization binding assay (FP) served as a complementary assay to confirm the binding affinities of the macrocycles labelled with the fluorophore BODIPY at the C- (18d) or N-terminus (14e). In a typical experiment, we used PFS-SICRFFCGGK (18d) or PFSSTCQGECGGK (19d) at 1 \u00b5Mconcentration and titratedHSA from0.1 to 100 \u00b5M.Thedose-response curve couldfit a single-state bindingmodel with a binding affinity of KD = 4\u20136 \u00b5M for 18d and at least 100 times weaker affinity for PFS-STCQGECGGK (19d) (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. 16). BODIPY bound weakly to HSA with >300 \u00b5M binding affinity (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. 16). The FP assay like the previous 19F NMR assay could also measure binding to other proteins or even complex mixtures (serum). A titration of the mouse serum (Supplementary Fig. 16C) yielded a similar binding profile to that observed in binding to pure albumin (Fig. 4A). Replacing HSA with lysozyme and RNAse, the assay detected no binding response, confirming that 18d binding was specific to HSA (Fig. 4B). Switching the location of the fluorescent probe from the N-terminus to C-terminus did not significantly change the affinity of 14c (KD = 4\u20136 \u00b5M, Supplementary Fig. 17). The switching from DFS (18f) to PFS (18d) exhibited no difference in FP experiment (Supplementary Fig. 18A), but minor differences were observed by NMR (Supplementary Fig. 18B). The results from FP were in the same order of magnitude as the semiqualitative estimates acquired for BODIPY-free peptides by the 19F NMR binding assay, indicating that the presence of a fluorophore did not significantly increase the binding (Supplementary Fig. 19). Heinis and co-workers observed that fluorophores could dramatically increase binding affinity of peptides for albumin, and removing the fluorophore can be detrimental to the binding of the albumin ligand23. To exclude this possibility, we tested PFS-SICRFFCGG macrocycles with and without BODIPY in 19F NMR binding assay and observed similar binding affinity (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

            "text": "To identify the binding location of PFS-SICRFFCGGG (14c), we attempted to co-crystalize 14c with HSA but were not successful. As an alternative, we attempted to map the binding pocket of 14c by testing whether carbamazepine, diclofenac, or ibuprofen inhibit the binding of 14c (Supplementary Fig. 20). As none of these drugs influenced the binding of 14c, we concluded that primary binding pocket for 14c does not coincide with the primary binding pockets of carbamazepine, diclofenac, or ibuprofen. To identify the plausible binding location of 14c, weperformeda series ofdocking calculations.Ninedistinct sites on HSA bind to fatty acids50, some of which also accommodate ibuprofen and diclofenac51,52 (Supplementary Fig. 21, Fig. 5A). Docking of 14c to thesenine sites identifiedbinding site 1,which is close toHemin-binding site, as the most favourable (Fig. 5A). The docking score for site 1 averaged over all the docking calculations across five distinct HSA structures (PDB 1E7E, 1E7F, 1E7G, 1E7H, 1E7I) was \u20138.95 \u00b1 1.0 kcal/mol whereas the scores for the next sites were \u20136.6 \u00b1 1.1, \u20136.2 \u00b1 0.7, and \u20136.0 \u00b1 1.2 kcal/mol (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23). Observed docking preference away from known ibuprofen and diclofenac sites corroborated the experimental observation (Supplementary Fig. 20). As site 1 is hemin-binding site, a desired experimental validation of this prediction would be inhibition of HSA:14a interaction by hemin. We attempted to measure 14c:HSA interactions in the presence of hemin, but the results were inconclusive due to strong association of hemin and 14c in 19F NMR experiments. We note many drugs have primary and secondary (lower affinity) binding sites on HSA surface and further discussion on how multi-site binding affects prioritization of site 1 is provided Supplementary information section 28 \u201cDocking Calculations\u201d.\nTo further evaluate prioritization of albumin site 1 as a plausible binding site for 14c, we performed NVT (constant temperature, constant volume) and NPT (constant temperature, constant pressure) simulations of 14c in site 1 of HSA solvated with explicit TIP3P water molecules and calculated binding free energy using steered molecule dynamics (SMD) and umbrella sampling techniques. We then calculated the potential of mean force (PMF) of the unbinding process in biased MD simulations with a harmonic potential whose interaction center is located at a specific distance between the binding pocket and the center ofmass of 14c. The\u0394Gwas about \u20137.0 kcal/mol for pocket 1, while the \u0394G for the other pockets was less than \u20134.2 kcal/mol. The PMF corroborated that pocket 1 has significantly stronger binding energy than the others (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. 26). Furthermore, the calculated \u0394\u0394G of free energy perturbation calculations (FEP) for 14c andfiveAlamutants of 14cwere in alignmentwithKDmeasured for the same alaninemutants in the 19F NMR assay (Fig. 3B, C). The biggest lossof function forR4Amutant highlighted the importanceofArginine\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5654 6\ninteraction for albumin binding (Fig. 5E\u2013G); in contrast, both NMR and FEP agreed on a relatively minor role of N-terminal Ser and minor loss for S1A mutant.\nIn summary, while we failed to co-crystalize 14c with HSA, the combined findings from FP and NMR, drug inhibition, docking/MD, and aligned performance of Ala-mutants in FEP and NMR studies offer a useful guide for optimization of 14c and its use in delivery. For example, both the binding pose in site 1, and NMR/FP studies suggest that both C- andN-termini of the 14cmight be accessible as a plausible location for the attachments of payloads to 14c. We followed up on these suggestions in pharmacokinetic studies.\nCirculation lifetime of 14c derivatives in mice We evaluated the half-life of 14c, its derivatives, and SA-21 peptide as a positive control in mice by administrating a mixture of peptides into mice\u2019s tail vein followed by HPLC/MS analysis of plasma samples at 2 and 60min. The concentration of SA-21 in plasma at 2 and 60min decreased subtly from4\u00d7 104 to3 \u00d7 104ng/mLwhereas concentrationof\nmacrocycle 14c in plasma was 3 and 1.5 \u00d7 104ng/mL at the same time points (Fig. 6B). In contrast, four derivatives of 14c were excreted at 2min or were not detectable at 60min. The fast-clearing analogues were linear SICRFFCGGGwith the cysteines alkylated by iodoacetamide (14l), the alanine mutants PFS-SICAFFCGGG (23c) and PFS-SACRF FCGGG (21c), and the control PFS-STCQGECGGG sequence (17c); poor plasma retentionof the last three analogueswas in agreementwith their significantly decreased association with albumin in the NMR studies (Fig. 3). Replacing PFS by hexafluorobenzene (HFB, 14j) and decafluorobiphenyl (DFB, 14k) did not ablate retention in plasma completely (Fig. 6A); however, concentration of HFB- and DFB-modified macrocycles after 60min were factor of 10 lower when compared to PFS-modified 14c parent. These observations reinforced the important structural features of 14c: both the amino acids sequence of 14c and specific conformational constraint of this sequence imposed by PFS linker are critical for even a short-term retention in circulation.\nIn the same short-term circulation study, we examined the several N- and C-terminal derivatives of 14c to identify the permissive location\nHemin\nPFS-SICRFFCGGG (14c)\nIIIA\nIIA\nIA\nIIIB\nSudlow\u2019s site II FA3 and FA4\nIbuprofen binding siteIIB\nIB\nSudlow\u2019s site I and FA7\nA B\nC\ndomain I\ndomain II\ndomain III\nFA I\nFA5\nFA6\nFA2\nDiclofenac binding site\nARG4\nASP183\n2.1 \u00c5\n1.8 \u00c5\nARG4\nASP183\nASP183\nARG4 8.5 \u00c5\nD\n4.8 \u00c5\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\nKd (\nM )\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nuncertainty of NMR fit\nS1A I2A R4A F5A F6Aparent\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nS1A I2A R4A F5A F6A \u2206\u2206G from NMR binding (kcal/mole)mutations\nmutations\nS1A\nR4A\nF5AI2A F6A\nE F G\nS I C R F F C G 3\nA I C R F F C G 3\nS A C R F F C G 3\nS I C A F F C G 3\nS I C R A F C G 3\nS I C R F A C G 3\n\u2206 \u2206G\n, F EP\nc al\ncu la\ntio ns\n(k ca\nl/m ol\ne)\nuncertainty of NMR fit\n\u2206 \u2206G\n, F EP\nc al\ncu la\ntio ns\n(k ca\nl/m ol\ne)\nFig. 5 | Docking predictions of HSA-14c complex.

We then examined the retention of three C-terminal derivatives: PFS-SICRFFCGGK(N3) (26c) where K(N3) denotes a \u03b3-azidolysine, PFSSICRFFCGGGZ (20c), where Z indicated propargyl glycine and 20h synthesized by Cu-catalysed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) of 20c and di-azido-PEG3 linker. The concentration of 26c decreased in plasma by factor of >10 after 60min but we were delighted to observe that plasma concentration of C-terminal conjugates 20c and 20h at 60minwas indistinguishable from that of the parent 14cmacrocycles.\nEncouraged by the initial evaluation of serum retention, we extended the study to 3 h. Gratifyingly we observed that the concentration of 14c and SA-21 in plasma after 3 h were indistinguishable (Fig. 6C). Analogues of 14c in which PFS was replaced by HFB (14j) or DFB (14k) perfluoroarenes consistently showed over 10x decrease in plasma concentration; a decrease of nearly 100xwas observed for 14m analogue in which perfluoroarene was substituted by metabromoxylene linker (MBX) (Fig. 6C). As expected, macrocycle 25c, the F6A mutant of 14c, was not detectable in serum at or after 60min and the concentration of macrocycle 21c S1A mutant of 14c was significantly lower than 14c at 3 h (Fig. 6D). After 3 h of circulation plasma concentrations of PFS-SICRFFCGGGZ (20c) at 3 h were indistinguishable from 14c (Fig. 6E) whereas the PFS-SICRFFCGGK(N3) 26c showed a suboptimal long-termperformance in plasma (Supplementary Fig. 32). Similarly to the short-term observations (Fig. 6B), it appeared that the molecules with longer (Gly)3-linker at the C-terminus provided better plasma retention than those with (Gly)2 linker. We did not investigate the linker requirements in detail but we attached all subsequent payloads to the C-terminal end via (Gly)3-linker.\nThe PK properties of the analogues that contained polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties at N- or C-termini reinforced the above observation and identified the optimal location for attachment of therapeutically-relevant payloads such as peptide apelin analogues53\u201356. Themacrocycle 14g synthesized from 14cby acylationof N-terminal Ser with azido-PEG6-carboxylic acid was not detectable in plasma after 3 h whereas the concentration of C-terminal PEG-ylated compounds 20h and 14i after 3 h of circulation was indistinguishable from unmodified PFS-SICRFFCGGG. Compounds 14i is a product of C-terminal amidation of PFS-SICRFFCGGG-COOH by NH2-PEG5-N3, whereas in compound 20h di-azido-PEG3 linker was ligated to PFSSICRFFCGGGZ (20c) by CuAAC. An indistinguishable plasma concentration of 14c, 14i, 20c, and 20h after 3 h suggested that structural changes after the (Gly)3-linker are permissive for albumin recognition and do not affect long-term circulation in plasma. Gratifyingly we observed that conjugation of PFS-SICRFFCGGG to apelin-17 analogue (N3-PEG6-NMe17A) increased its plasma retention significantly. We could not detect the apelin-17 analogue in plasma even 2min after injection and such rapid clearanceof apelin analogues is consistentwith previous observations57. In contrast, plasma concentration of compound 20n, produced by CuAAC ligation of N3-PEG6-NMe17A53 to PFSSICRFFCGGGZ (20c) by Cu-catalysed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was indistinguishable from the plasma concentration of 20c after 3 h. Such enhanced circulation of apelin-17 analogue promoted by a relatively small albumin-binding peptide is a promising starting point formore indepth investigation and benchmarking to previously reported conjugates of apelin and albumin binding antibody58 or apelin and 40kDa PEG group59."

            "text": "Late-stage modification of peptides and genetically-encoded (GE) libraries of peptides by cross-linkers (linchpins) is one of the common approaches to incorporate beneficial attributes to their properties60. Alkylation of cysteine residues in peptides via an SN2 reaction using bi- or tri-dentate alkyl halides has been used for cyclization of peptides, incorporation of unnatural fragments into the resulting macrocycles47,61,62, and late-stage modification of phage- and\nmRNA-displayed libraries to yield billion-scale GE libraries. Peptide cyclization via SNAr reaction with perfluoroarenes popularized by the Pentelute group forms alkyl-aryl thioethers45; other classes reactions have been developed to form aryl63\u201365, alkenyl and alkynyl thioethers66 in unprotected peptides. Aryl and perfluoroaryl thioethers are more resistant toward oxidation when compared to traditional bis-alkyl thioesters44. Decreased conformational mobility or aryl-thioether bond has been proposed to equip the resulting macrocycles with favourable properties such as cell permeability and proteolytic stability50,67. Our report described the selection from perfluoro-aryl macrocyclic GE libraries. There exists only one exampleofGE selection from SNAr-modified phage libraries: Lu and co-workers recently employed 2,4-difluoro-6-hydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetricarbonitrile (DFB) as a reagent that can modify phage libraries in water68. Chen and coworkers also used Pd-catalysed SNAr reaction to yield DNA-encoded libraries69. Both SNAr reaction yield macrocycles do not contain any fluorine atoms. On the other hand, fluorine handles present in perfluoroaryl-cross-linked macrocycles offer a unique possibility to use of 19F NMR to measure protein-macrocycle interactions. Interaction of perfluorinated aryls with proteins is also electronically distinct from non-fluorinated aromatic residues and in some cases it can offer uniquely advantageous interactions70.\nAn interesting observation in selection of GE OFS-macrocycle libraries is mild reactivity of these structures towards thiol nucleophiles71. Libraries of mild electrophiles72\u201374 and phage-displayed libraries with built-in electrophiles75 have emerged as an important starting point for discovery of covalent and reversibly covalent inhibitors. While we do not show it in our report, it is possible that an attenuated reactivity of OFS-macrocycles towards thiols can be used as an advantageous feature in discovery of inhibitors that form covalent bonds with thiol residues in proteins. If reactivity of the selected macrocycles is not desired, one can perform late-stage replacement of OFSmoiety in the identified hits with nearly isosteric perfluorophenylsulfide. The PFS linchpin is not sufficiently reactive for direct modification of phage-displayed libraries in water, but replacement ofDFS linchpin by PFS \u201cpost-discovery\u201d maintains the conformation and binding affinity of the discovered macrocycles while alleviating their undesired electrophilicity. Our report, thus, suggests a general approach for the future utility of perfluoroaryl-modified libraries: Step1: select phage-displayed libraries ofOFS-macrocycles against the desired target. Step 2: evaluate PFS-modified synthetic macrocycles for their ability to bind to these targets.\nHuman serum albumin target used in this publication is a commonly employed model target in screen of phage-displayed or DNAencoded libraries (DEL) and traditional high-throughput screening (HTS). Albumin is a complex multi-pocket receptor with regions that can bind to fatty acid-like moieties, dicarboxylic acids as well a wide variety of aromatic and heterocyclic compounds and large dye molecules51,76. Albumin also contains several binding sites for peptides as well as small proteins that have been utilized for half-life extension strategies23,77. Small footprint peptide macrocycles discovered in this report add to a diverse set of known albumin binders. Small-molecules have been developed with astonishing affinity for human albumin, but such molecules exhibit no binding to mouse albumin and no retention in mice, unless such mouse is engineered to express human albumin78. Mid-size peptide macrocycle described in this report might provide an interesting opportunity for sufficient affinity but also much desired cross-reactivity between the species. The affinity of PFS-SICRFFCGGG (14c) (1\u20134 \u00b5M confirmed in FP and 19F NMR assays) is less than an order of magnitude away from the affinity of benchmark SA-21 (0.6 \u00b5M). An interesting role for (Gly)3 linker at the C-terminus in PK studies suggests that a C-terminal augmentation to this scaffold is a productive avenue for fine-tuning of the affinity without increasing the size of the peptide. Remarkably, 14c and its analogues with C-terminal extensions beyond (Gly)3 linker exhibited virtually identical retention times, mirroring the\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5654 9\nbenchmark albumin binder SA-21. This compelling finding underscores their potential as highly promising tools for albumin-binding applications. The small size of such peptide-macrocycle familiesmakes it trivial to make them by solid-phase synthesis or incorporate them a part of another sequence produced by solid phase synthesis. More importantly, the SICRFFC motif can be easily re-introduced into phagedisplayed libraries to serve as a constant N-terminal albumin binding motif and giving rise to libraries with predictable circulation half-life. The compact nature of themacrocycle allows introducing this albuminbinding moiety to diverse display platforms within the initial stages of screening of genetically-encoded libraries, making it possible to perform de-novo discovery of peptide and macrocyclic modalities with predictable circulation lifetime in animal models."
