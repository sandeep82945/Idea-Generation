Exploring Picein's Mechanism of Action in NDDs: Despite promising initial findings, the exact mechanisms by which picein exerts its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. Future research could focus on detailed mechanistic studies to understand how picein interacts with cellular pathways related to neurodegeneration, including its impact on BACE1 inhibition, oxidative stress mitigation, and protein aggregation. Such studies could involve advanced molecular biology techniques, gene expression analysis, and proteomics to elucidate the pathways influenced by picein.

Clinical Trials of Picein for NDD Treatment: Building on preclinical evidence, the next step would involve designing and conducting rigorous clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of picein in human subjects with various NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These studies would provide critical data on optimal dosages, potential side effects, and therapeutic outcomes, helping to transition picein from a promising compound to a clinically validated treatment.

Comparative Studies of Picein with Existing Neuroprotective Agents: To position picein within the broader context of NDD treatments, comparative studies assessing its efficacy relative to existing neuroprotective and disease-modifying treatments could be valuable. These studies could help to identify unique advantages or synergies of picein when used alone or in combination with other treatments, potentially leading to more effective multidrug therapies for NDDs.

Development of Picein-based Formulations for Enhanced Bioavailability: One challenge with many natural compounds is their limited bioavailability, which can restrict their therapeutic potential. Research focused on the development of novel formulations or delivery systems for picein (such as nanoparticles, liposomes, or transdermal patches) could enhance its bioavailability and effectiveness. Such innovations could also explore the use of picein in combination with other neuroprotective agents, aiming to create synergistic effects for improved outcomes in NDD treatment.

Investigation into Picein's Effects on Cognitive Functions and Brain Plasticity: Beyond its neuroprotective properties, future studies could explore the potential benefits of picein on cognitive functions, learning, memory, and brain plasticity in the context of NDDs. These investigations might include behavioral assessments in animal models, neuroimaging studies in humans to monitor changes in brain structure and function, and in vitro studies to assess neural growth and synaptic plasticity. Understanding these effects could reveal additional therapeutic targets for picein and contribute to a holistic approach to NDD treatment, focusing not only on disease progression but also on enhancing quality of life and cognitive function.
