    "abstractText": "Limited literature explores the relationship between economic impacts and pet ownership. Do people have more pets as a result of economic crises? In the current study, we answer this question by looking at the time series of pet ownership and children present in U.S. households from 2003 to 2018. We utilize a causal inference technique to compare the estimated real trend of pet ownership in American households against the scenario in which the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis would not have occurred. Our findings suggest that the financial crisis triggered households to own more pets, specifically dogs and cats.",

            "text": "Pets have become essential to many Americans\u2019 lives [1]. Eighty-five million families, or 68% of U.S. households, own a pet [2]. According to the 2019/2020 National Pet Owners Survey, 84.9 million homes own a pet, equating to 67% of U.S. households. In 1988, this number was 56%. This signals a marked rise in the last 30 years. Dogs, cats, freshwater fish, and birds are the most common pets in U.S. households [2]. Limited literature has explored the idea that pet ownership has grown as child-rearing has declined in the United States [3], even during economic crises. A small study in an animal shelter in Chicago demonstrated that the 2007\u20132008 United States economic crisis influenced decreased pet adoption rates but did not affect pet relinquishment. The study also demonstrated that dogs were less adopted than cats, probably because dogs are more expensive to maintain [4]. Despite this, pet ownership rates increased after this event. There was a 6% point increase in pet ownership between 2008 and 2013 [5]. During the same years, the birth rate has slightly declined (in 2008, 13.8, and in 2013, 12.5) [6]. The trends are clear: people are having the same or fewer children and are owning more pets, which could mean they are opting more for pets than children. One of the main reasons Americans may opt for pets instead of children is that the former are cheaper to support and do not require as much attention [7], which could matter more during an economic crisis. The yearly investment in a pet can range from $700 to $4000, including recurring medical costs [8,9]. Instead, raising a child until they finish secondary education is more costly, averaging $17,000 per year [10]. Emotional support given by animals could be a way to cope with financial distress, especially during crises [11].

Indeed, around 90% of pet owners in the United States regard their pets as family members [16]. Recently, researchers talked about how people impute dogs and cats a \u201cflexible personhood\u201d [17]. Shirt-Vertesh [17] explains the following in their ethnographic study of pet owners in Israel: \u201cpets are treated as flexible persons or emotional commodities; they are loved and incorporated into human lives but can at any moment be demoted and moved outside of the home and the family\u201d. This premise could suggest that animals have the same adaptability as humans regarding acceptance and exclusion from the household. On the other hand, this adaptability appears to be more extreme, rapid, and problem-free for animals in comparison to humans. Furthermore, when dealing with animals, the degree to which kinship ties can be adjusted depends on whether animals receive this personhood. Pet-human kinship can be so strong that a recent study found that after a flood which is a situation of economic distress, the demand for pet-friendly housing lists was exceptionally high in comparison to other years [18]."

For example, households in the United States with more children own and spend less on pets [19\u201321]. Decision-making power regarding family may also influence pet ownership. Hahn et al. [22] found that the probability of owning any pet was higher for women who lived in states where abortion was legal around 1970. These women had more control over their child-rearing expectations and, thus, their future family composition. Their study suggests that women have more pets when they have more decision power over their family composition. Instead, if they could not have abortions, they probably had to carry the baby to term and, therefore, were less likely to own a pet in the future. These two studies suggest a possible connection between family size and pet ownership."

To our knowledge, no studies explore variations in pet ownership during times of financial strain. In the present paper, employing collapsed data from the American Time Use Survey and causal inference techniques, we demonstrate that the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis in the United States had a positive causal effect on pet ownership and time spent with pets among childless households. Therefore, economic constraints galvanize pet ownership. Finally, according to Zasloff [23], \u201ca dog is not a cat, is not a bird\u201d, indicating differing levels of pet popularity by species. Additionally, we use information from the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association [24] to estimate pet ownership trends by species. We expected that the species that increased the most were those with more \u201cflexible personhood\u201d, such as dogs and cats. Our findings reflect what we expected: dogs and cats have increased compared to the other species in the dataset (birds and fish) after the crisis."

The\nAnimals 2022, 12, 3010 3 of 10\nATUS collected 1-day time diaries from respondents; as part of a telephone interview. Respondents were asked to recall the primary activity they were doing in each period, starting at 4 a.m. on the day before the interview and noting a start and end time for each activity up through 4 a.m. the day of the interview. While the most recent day may not be typical for any one respondent, especially for activities done only sporadically for the sample as a whole, this is a more accurate way to assess what average days look like than asking people what they typically do, which is likely to be more affected by both the lack of clear events memory and desirability bias. Although we only have time use data on one household member, this is sufficient to assess the average time spent with a pet for the average adult American. The main reason why we chose ATUS for the principal causal analysis and not other datasets, such as the AVMA Animal Health Studies Database [26] or the Simmons Pet Food Statistics and Demographics Dataset [27], that have more specific questions about pet ownership information, was that ATUS is a genuinely representative sample of the American population and that does not bias the causal inference analysis.

These are unpaid activities; otherwise, they would be among the ATUS work activities. Households in which their surveyed members spent time taking care of a pet were assigned as pet owners. Those who did not spend any time taking care of a pet were marked as non-owners. Therefore, we created a pet ownership proportion variable per year. The data for the primary causal analysis was constructed assuming that pet ownership is equivalent to having spent time taking care of pets in the household.

The economic crisis started in 2007, and the study period was divided into pre-crisis (2003\u20132007) and postcrisis periods (2008\u20132013). To investigate the causal impact of the financial crisis on pet ownership trends, we applied Bayesian structural time series models using the R-4.2.1 [30], CausalImpact [31]. The methodology employs one or several time series trends not affected by a specific treatment (an intervention) but with a trend moving similarly to the affected series before the treatment takes place. This condition must be met for the counterfactual series to be reasonable since fitting on divergent series would likely lead to bad fits in the pre-treatment stage and poor predictions in the post-treatment stage. These series are then fitted to the affected series as closely as possible in the pre-treatment period. The fitting model is then used with the values post-intervention to create a prediction of what the affected series would have looked like if the treatment had never taken place (i.e., a counterfactual). Any significant gap between the counterfactual and the observed series in the post-treatment period is thus attributable to the effect of the treatment itself. In the case of the CausalImpact tool, the model fitting and creating the predictions iteratively in the post-intervention stage is a Bayesian regression with a spike-and-slab prior. This methodology iterates its estimates and updates, generating a distribution that allows the generation of confidence intervals around the counterfactual.\nAnimals 2022, 12, 3010 4 of 10\nIn our case, the treatment event is the financial crisis of 2007.

The series used to create the counterfactual (\u201ccontrol\u201d) is, in turn, the proportion of households with pets that also have children under the age of 18 in them.

Companion animals are increasingly gaining public recognition as a way to deal with stress and daily issues [36,37]. The pet-human well-being claim is supported by growing research. Pet ownership has been linked to decreased blood pressure, loneliness, anxiety, and fear [38,39]. Pet health-promoting benefits have been demonstrated in populations like the elderly [40] and children with serious illnesses [41,42]. Pets seem to play an especially significant role in the lives of people who are socially isolated or excluded, as they can provide solace, companionship, and a sense of worth. The bonds between people and animals can help smooth over life\u2019s rough edges, providing fuel for perseverance [43], especially during financial crises. For example, a study in Malaysia demonstrated that during the COVIDlockdown, pet owners were found to have significantly higher levels of coping self-efficacy, positive emotions, and psychological well-being in comparison to non-pet owners [44]. This study does not come without limitations. The data for the primary causal analysis was constructed assuming that pet ownership is equivalent to having spent time taking care of pets in the household. While this could be a good approximation of pet ownership only and not more complex pet-human relationships, this highlights the need for a yearly nationwide representative study that includes pet ownership variables. The General Social Surveys (GSS) in the United States began to collect information on pet ownership in 2018 [45]. Since the GSS is a biannual effort, we think this is a promising method to explore further the relationship that pets have with other social forces at the national level and across time. Also, the APPA survey is not ideal; it is not nationally representative of the population employing a random sample [24]. Moreover, other social factors like declining child-rearing desires could be confounding factors for the increase in pet ownership. While this is possible, the increase in pet care time and decrease in household members\u2019 care time after the crisis are stark and do not follow the same speed as their previous trends. Further studies could explore more deeply the mechanisms behind the increase in pet ownership during the 2007\u20132008 economic crisis, such as increased emotional support and unemployment, and leisure time."

            "text": "Has pet ownership increased due to the 2007\u20132008 American economic crisis? In this study, we investigate this question using a causal inference method. We examine the estimated real trend of pet ownership in American households in the light of a hypothetical alternative in which the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 never occurred. Our research suggests that the economic downturn encouraged families to increase their pet ownership, especially those of dogs and cats.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.C. and M.F.-H.; methodology, P.C. and M.F.-H.; software, P.C.; formal analysis, P.C.; data curation, P.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.F.-H. and P.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.F.-H. and P.C.
