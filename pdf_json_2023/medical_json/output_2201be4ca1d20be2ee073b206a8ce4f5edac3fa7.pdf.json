    "abstractText": "Since two quantum states that are local unitary (LU) equivalent have the same amount of entanglement, it is meaningful to find a practical method to determine the LU equivalence of given quantum states. In this paper, we present a valid process to find the unitary tensor product decomposition for an arbitrary unitary matrix. Then, by using this process, the conditions for determining the local unitary equivalence of quantum states are obtained. A numerical verification is carried out, which shows the practicability of our protocol. We also present a property of LU invariants by using the universality of quantum gates which can be used to construct the complete set of LU invariants.",

In particular, multipartite quantum entanglement plays key roles in the rapidly developing field of quantum information science, for example, in one-way quantum computing, quantum error correction, and quantum secret sharing [2,3]. However, it is more difficult to understand multipartite mixed states with nonlocal properties. Fortunately, the entanglement (or the local hidden variable models) of quantum states remains unchanged under local unitary (LU) transformations. In addition, local operations and classical communication (LOCC) equivalence states are interconvertible also by local unitary transformations [4]. Therefore, it is very important to determine whether or not two states are LU equivalent.\nDefinition 1. Let \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0303 be two states in general H1 \u2297 H2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7HN quantum systems with dim Hi = di, i = 1, 2, . . . , N. They are LU equivalent if\n\u03c1\u0303 = (U1 \u2297U2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7UN)\u03c1(U1 \u2297U2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7UN)\u2020\nfor some unitary operators Ui, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, where \u2020 denotes transpose and conjugate.\nAt present, there are many results on LU equivalence and LU invariants [4\u201324]. In this paper, we present a practical method to find the unitary tensor decomposition of an arbitrary unitary matrix. Then, we derive a local unitary equivalence strategy for arbitrary quantum states with non-degenerate density matrices from the point of view of block matrix and unitary matrix tensor decomposition. Exact examples are analyzed numerically. We also present a property of LU invariants which can lead to the construction of a complete set of LU invariants.\nEntropy 2023, 25, 1139. https://doi.org/10.3390/e25081139 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy"

            "text": "In this section, we will present a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of the unitary tensor decomposition of an arbitrary unitary matrix. We start with the bipartite decomposition.\n2.1. The Decomposition Scheme of W = U \u2297V Set W = U \u2297V, with U and V as 2\u00d7 2 and d\u00d7 d matrices, respectively. Set\nU = [\nu11 u12 u21 u22 ] with ukl as the entries, and\nW = [\nW11 W12 W21 W22\n] (1)\nas the block representation of W. Then, according to the tensor product of matrices, one obtains W = U \u2297V = [\nu11V u12V u21V u22V ] We have WklW\u2020mn = uklVV\u2020u\u2020mn, where k, l, m, n \u2208 {1, 2}. Furthermore, we can obtain\ntr(WklW\u2020kl) = d|ukl | 2, when k = m, l = n. Thus,\nukl =\n\u221a tr(WklW\u2020kl)\nd \u00b7 ei\u03b8kl , (2)\nwhere ei\u03b8kl is the complex phase of ukl , k, l = {1, 2}. Thus, we set\nW = [\nu\u030311 u\u030312 u\u030321 u\u030322\n] \u2297 ei\u03b811 V \u2261 U\u0303 \u2297 V\u0303, (3)\nwith U\u0303 = e\u2212i\u03b811U and V\u0303 = ei\u03b811 V. Without loss of generality, we set tr(W11W\u202011) 6= 0. Combining (1) and (3), we can obtain\nV\u0303 = ei\u03b811 \u00b7V = W11 u\u030311 , (4)\nwhere u\u030311 = \u221a tr(W11W\u202011) d . We can further derive that for the remaining entries of u\u0303kl with kl = {12, 21, 22},\nu\u0303kl = (Wkl)11\nv\u030311 , (5)\nwhere v\u030311 is the (1, 1) entry of V\u0303, which is assumed to be nonzero. We also obtain that matrices Wkl must be the scalar multiplications of V\u0303 for any k, l \u2208 {1, 2}. For unitary matrix W = U \u2297 V, where U and V are arbitrary d1 \u00d7 d1 and d2 \u00d7 d2 unitary matrices, we can also find unitary matrices U\u0303 and V\u0303 such that W = U\u0303\u2297 V\u0303 by using the same method. To summarize, let W be any d1d2 \u00d7 d1d2 unitary matrix with block representation W = (Wkl), where k, l \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d1} and Wkl are d2 \u00d7 d2 matrices. According to the above analysis, we directly derive the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. If Wkl is a scalar multiplication of a unitary matrix for any k, l \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d1}, then we can always derive the tensor product decomposition W = U\u0303 \u2297 V\u0303, where U\u0303 and V\u0303 are d1 \u00d7 d1 and d2 \u00d7 d2 unitary matrices, respectively. We can always select one of tr(WklW\u2020kl) 6= 0. Without loss of generality, we set tr(W11W\u202011) 6= 0. The entries of U\u0303 and V\u0303 are given by\nu\u030311 =\n\u221a tr(W11W\u202011)\nd1 ;\nV\u0303 = W11 u\u030311 ;\nu\u0303kl = (Wkl)11\nv\u030311 , k, l \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d1}, kl 6= 11. (6)\n2.2. The Decomposition Scheme of W = Q\u2297U \u2297V To simplify the expression, we set Q, U and V as 2\u00d7 2 matrices with entries qkl , ukl and vkl , respectively. We then consider W = Q\u2297U \u2297V = Q\u2297 P, and set P = U \u2297V. We obtain\nW = [\nq11P q12P q21P q22P\n] = [ W11 W12 W21 W22 ] ,\nwhere Wkl are the block matrices of W, and\nP = [\nu11V u12V u21V u22V\n] =  p11 p12 p13 p14 p21 p22 p23 p24 p31 p32 p33 p34 p41 p42 p43 p44 , V = [v11 v12v21 v22 ] .\nWe can obtain WklW\u2020mn = qkl PP\u2020q\u2020mn, and tr(WklW\u2020kl) = 2|qkl |, for k, l, m, n \u2208 {1, 2}. Thus,\nqkl =\n\u221a tr(WklW\u2020kl)\n4 \u00b7 ei\u03b8kl ,\nwhere ei\u03b8kl is the complex phase of qkl , k, l \u2208 {1, 2}. Without loss of generality, one still sets tr(W11W\u202011) 6= 0. We then set\nq\u030311 =\n\u221a tr(W11W\u202011)\n4 ;\nP\u0303 = W11 q\u030311 ;\nq\u0303kl = (Wkl)11\np\u030311 , kl = {12, 21, 22}.

Numerical Verification\nWe use the rand() function in MATLAB to generate a random matrix [25,26]. This function can generate random numbers between 0 and 1 according to a uniform distribution.\nThen, using the singular value decomposition of this matrix, a random unitary matrix can be obtained.\nExample 1.

In this section, we present a general method to determine the LU equivalence of any pair of non-degenerate quantum states by the unitary tensor decomposition protocol derived in the above section. Let \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0303 be the density matrices of two states in quantum systems H1\u2297H2\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7HN with dimHi = d, i = 1, 2, . . . , N. We assume that both \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0303 are non-degenerate. We further set that \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0303 have the same eigenvalues, which is the necessary condition for the LU equivalence of the two density matrices. Let \u03c1 = X\u03a3X\u2020 and \u03c1\u0303 = Y\u03a3Y\u2020 be the spectral decomposition of \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0303. Thus, there is a unitary matrix W = YX\u2020 such that\n\u03c1\u0303 = W\u03c1W\u2020.\nTo certify that \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0303 are local unitary equivalent, one needs to further find unitary matrices Ui, i = 1, 2, . . . , N such that\nW = U1 \u2297U2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7UN .\nIn the following, we consider bipartite quantum systems as an example. The processes of judging the local unitary equivalence of quantum states are as follows: [1] Check whether the density matrices \u03c1 and \u03c3 of quantum states are non-degenerate and whether they have the same eigenvalues;\n[2] Find the spectral decompositions \u03c1 = X\u03a3X\u2020 and \u03c1\u0303 = Y\u03a3Y\u2020.

It should be noted that our schemes are convenient to discuss the local unitary equivalence when the number and the dimension of the subsystems are small.
