External Validation of the BN Model in Diverse Populations: Conduct multi-center, international studies to validate and potentially refine the Bayesian Network (BN) model across different populations and settings. This could help in assessing the generalizability and robustness of the model across diverse genetic backgrounds, lifestyle factors, and clinical practices.

Integration of Genetic and Epigenetic Factors: Explore the integration of genetic and epigenetic markers into the BN model. Given that disrupted genetic and epigenetic patterns have been reported to contribute to the risk of fertilization failure, incorporating these factors could enhance the predictive power of the model and offer deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying fertilization failure.

Development of Dynamic Prediction Tools: Utilize the BN model to develop dynamic, real-time prediction tools for clinicians and patients. These tools could be integrated with electronic health records and updated as new data becomes available, providing clinicians with the most current clinical decision support and personalized treatment plans.

Investigation of Modifiable Risk Factors: Conduct detailed studies on the impact of modifiable risk factors (e.g., lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, and targeted therapies) on fertilization outcomes. This could include randomized controlled trials to test interventions that the BN model predicts could influence key variables, such as the number of oocytes retrieved or the probability of TFF/LFR.

Exploration of BN Models in Other Aspects of ART: Extend the use of BN models to other critical outcomes and processes in assisted reproductive technology (ART), such as embryo implantation success, live birth rates, and the long-term health of offspring. This could help in understanding complex interactions among variables that influence these outcomes and in developing comprehensive strategies to improve ART success rates.
