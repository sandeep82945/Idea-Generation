    "abstractText": "Multiphase flowmeters (MPFMs) measure the flow rates of oil, gas, and brine in a pipeline. MPFMs provide remote access to real-time well production data that are essential for efficient oil field operations. Most MPFMs are complex systems requiring frequent maintenance. An MPFM that is operationally simple and accurate is highly sought after in the energy industry. This paper describes an MPFM that uses only pressure sensors to measure gas and liquid flow rates. The design is an integration of a previously developed densitometer with an innovative Venturi-type flowmeter. New computing models with strong analytical foundations were developed, aided by empirical correlations and machine-learning-based flow-regime identification. A prototype was experimentally validated in a multiphase flow loop over a wide range of field-like conditions. The accuracy of the MPFM was compared to that of other multiphase metering techniques from similar studies. The results point to a robust, practical MPFM.",

            "text": "A multiphase flowmeter (MPFM) measures the volumetric flow rates of multiple fluids/phases flowing through a pipeline. An MPFM is typically installed between the wellhead and the separator in an oil/gas production field. MPFMs are widely used in the energy industry for production optimization and reservoir management [1]. The operators use data from the MPFM for various purposes [1\u20133]. During routine operations, the data help to ensure that oil/gas production rates are within target ranges based on the capacity of downstream processing facilities. In case of an upset condition, the data are beneficial for timely corrective actions such as choke adjustment. In artificial-lift operations, these data help to optimize operational parameters such as the lift-gas injection rate or pump speed. For reservoir management, MPFM data represent a valuable input for maximizing long-term oil/gas extraction. A typical MPFM [2] primarily measures the total mass flow rate, mixture density, and water liquid ratio, from which it calculates the oil, gas, and brine flow rates. To make these three primary measurements, MPFMs use various combinations of sensors, at least three, working in tandem [2,3]. One of the biggest challenges for these sensors is that multiphase flows are highly unsteady and non-homogenous. For example, a multiphase flow can be in one of several flow regimes (such as \u2018bubbly\u2019, \u2018churn\u2019, \u2018slug\u2019, or \u2018annular\u2019) or it may transition continuously (and frequently) between those regimes [2]. Another major challenge is that gas and liquid phases typically travel at different velocities\u2014a phenomenon called slip [4,5]\u2014that can bias the raw sensor response. Many multiphase sensors are also sensitive to fluid properties (such as salinity and viscosity). To deal with these challenging flow conditions, most multiphase sensors require special calculation models, periodic maintenance, and frequent tuning. Table 1 summarizes common measurement principles for the total mass flow rate and fluid mixture density. For measuring the total flow rate, differential pressure devices are very common ([6\u20138]). These devices are based on Bernoulli\u2019s principle (ca. 1738); non-ideal\nSensors 2023, 23, 7267. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23167267 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 7267 2 of 9\nlosses are empirically characterized using a \u2018discharge coefficient\u2019 (Cd). While Cd correlations are well-understood in single-phase flows [9], they are more involved in multiphase flows [10]. For measuring mixture density, gamma-ray attenuation is one of the most prevalent techniques in oil-and-gas applications ([6\u20138]). Another well-known technique for measuring the total mass flow rate is the Coriolis-force-induced deformation/twisting of a vibrating flow tube [11]. A \u2018Coriolis meter\u2019 can additionally measure fluid density based on the natural frequency of tube vibration. Another multiphase metering technique is the use of a strain\u2013sensor array that measures the speeds of propagating pressures in the fluid stream (i.e., both the fluid velocity and sound speed) [12]. It is a \u2018full bore\u2019 measurement because it has no intrusive components or flow constrictions. While all the above are \u2018inline\u2019 techniques that do not physically separate the phases, another class of MPFMs uses a built-in separator. These systems measure each phase separately using single-phase flow meters that are installed downstream of the separator [13].\nTable 1. Measurement principles used in select multiphase flow metering technologies.\nLiterature References\nMeasurement Principle for Total Flow Rate\nMeasurement Principle for Mixture Density\n[6\u20138] Differential pressure across area reduction Gamma-ray attenuation [11] Coriolis (vibrating tubes): deformation Coriolis (vibrating tubes): natural frequency [12] Pipe strain (cross correlation): flow velocity Pipe strain (cross correlation): sound speed [13] Gas\u2013liquid cyclonic separator, with a Coriolis meter in the liquid line and an orifice plate in the gas line\nAll the above-mentioned measurement techniques have unique limitations. The gamma-ray technique ([6\u20138]) uses nuclear sources which have safety concerns and logistical hassles. A Coriolis meter may underperform at high gas fractions (above 20%), particularly with respect to measuring density, due to the phenomenon of gas\u2013liquid decoupling [11]. Strain\u2013sensor arrays may underperform at medium gas fractions (in the 20\u201380% range) due to a fundamentally weak relationship between the sound speed and fluid density [12]. Separation-based systems are larger/heavier, have smaller rangeability, and rely on the frequent adjustment of valves to control flow separation [13]. This article describes a new MPFM that uses only differential pressure sensors to measure both the total flow rate and mixture density. Differential pressure sensors are mature technologies that are easy to maintain and reliable, even in harsh environments. This translates to lower operational costs, especially for remote installations that are common in oil-and-gas applications. Furthermore, the new MPFM design leverages conventional piping arrangements without any special/custom machining, thus minimizing manufacturing costs. This article comprehensively explores whether this favorable sensing technique can be innovatively harnessed to accurately measure gas and liquid rates under all multiphase flow conditions."

For a given flow/fluid condition, the frictional force will ideally be equal and opposite. So, the term DP2 + DP3 cancels out the frictional losses, yielding the total hydrostatic head, i.e., \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc54\u210e \u2219 2 (1) where \ud835\udf0c is the mixture density.

But, to account for the downstream tap location at a height of \u2018y\u2019 and the resultant hydrostatic head, the standard equation for \ud835\udc5a must include a correction term (\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc66) such that \ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc36 2 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43 \u2212 \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udf0c (3)\nThus, the MPFM measures both the mixture density and the mass flow rate by strategically placing pressure sensors in a conventional piping arrangement."

But, to account for the owns ream tap location at a h ight of \u2018y\u2019 and the resultant hydrostatic head, the standard equation for . mt must include a correction term (\u03c1mgy) such that\n. mt = KCd \u221a 2(DP1 \u2212 \u03c1mgy)\u03c1m (3)\nThus, the MPFM measures both the mixture density and the mass flow rate by strategically placing pressure sensors in a conventional piping arrangement."

Experimental Setup and Test Envelope To experimentally validate the concept (and the model), a prototype was tested at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)\u2019s multiphase flow test facility in San Antonio, Texas, USA. The flow loop had a multiphase pump and a three-phase separator instrumented with Coriolis meters in the oil/water legs and the orifice plate in the gas leg. The facility was able to pressurize the flow loop to a target pressure and circulate known flow rates of oil, brine, and gas through the test section in a closed loop. The SwRI test facility attests that the uncertainty of their reference data (for non-slugging, steady-state conditions) is as follows: liquid flow rates: <\u00b11%; gas flow rates: <\u00b11.5% (for low-flow conditions), and <\u00b10.6% (for high-flow conditions). The picture in Figure 3 shows the prototype installed in the test section of the flow loop. The pressure sensors had an accuracy of \u00b10.04% of full scale. Good practice guidelines [16] were followed in the design and operation of these sensors and impulse lines. The test envelope was selected to represent a typical oil well with a 3-inch production line. The range of flow conditions is summarized in Table 2. Within this test envelope, a total of 221 test points were chosen such that they included low, mid, and high flow levels, roughly equivalent to 2000, 5000, and 8000 BPD, respectively. The test points were distributed across the entire GVF range of interest. Figure 4b shows all test points in terms of the gas/liquid flow rates and GVFs. The test used methane, synthetic oil, and brine as the fluid media. Roughly half of the test points were at 4% salinity, and the remaining were at 13% salinity.

            "text": "As indicated earlier, to achieve the best accuracy from a differential pressure device with multiphase flows [10], its discharge coefficient (Cd) must be well characterized based on flow conditions, and this necessitates an identification of the flow regime using raw data. The same logic can be extended to the slip ratio (S) which is also influenced by the flow regime [2]. In addition to improving the model\u2019s accuracy, the flow-regime-identification step will also improve the model\u2019s generalizability. As a first step, features that correlate well with flow regimes were selected. The mean and standard deviation of DP1 are good predictors of the flow regime [17]. The mean of DP1 is a logical choice because it correlates well with the total mass flow rate which, in turn, strongly influences the type of flow regime [2]. The standard deviation of DP1 is also a logical choice because some flow regimes, such as slug flows, are more unsteady than others (such as bubbly/annular flows) [2]. As the next step, the k-means machine learning algorithm [18] was applied to the entire dataset. The k-means algorithm is an unsupervised classification algorithm that clusters data with similar characteristics based on distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) in a feature space. The features (the mean and standard deviation of DP1) were first normalized in the range of 0 to 1. The algorithm was implemented with k = 4, and the results are shown in Figure 4a, which shows clearly segregated groups. When these groups are plotted on a flow map (Figure 4b), they clearly correlate well with different flow conditions. For example, in mid-range flows, the test points in a mid-to-high GVF range, presumably slug flows, are in group 2, while those in a low-to-mid GVF range, presumably bubbly or churn flows, are in group 3.\nFinally, one simple linear regression was used per group to correlate Cd and S."

The gas rate is the least accurate for low-to-mid-range GVFs (i.e., groups 1, 3, and 4 in Figure 5a). This requires further investigation in future studies. The overall accuracy of this technique compares well with other multiphase meters that were experimentally evaluated in multiphase flow loops in the published literature. Zhou et al.

A prototype was experimentally validated in a multiphase flow loop, demonstrating good accuracy over a wide range of gas and liquid flow rates. Flow-regime identification was one of the key elements in the calculation model. The study determined that the largest measurement deviations occurred at gas fractions in the range of 25\u201350%. The next logical step is to optimize the pressure tap locations to improve the MPFM\u2019s measurement accuracy. However, there is an inherent three-way tradeoff between accuracy, size, and field-readiness in the future roadmap of this technology. Regardless, given its simple, reliable design, this technique has the potential to be a compelling choice for inline multiphase metering in oil-and-gas applications.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.R.; methodology, V.R.; validation, V.R.; formal analysis, V.R. and M.A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V.R.; writing\u2014review and editing, V.R. and M.A.; visualization, V.R.; project administration, V.R. and M.A. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: The data that support the findings of this study cannot be made publicly available due to legal restrictions but are available upon reasonable request.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)\u2019s Multiphase Flow Facility\u2019s operators/engineers for their help with the experimental setup and data collection.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest."
