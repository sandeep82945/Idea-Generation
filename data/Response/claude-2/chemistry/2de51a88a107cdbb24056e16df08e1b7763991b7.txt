 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the mechanisms by which porphyrins inhibit normal colon cell migration but not cancer cell migration. The differential effects could be due to differences in porphyrin uptake, localization, metabolism, or interactions with specific molecular pathways between normal and cancerous cells. 

2. Test a wider range of porphyrin concentrations on cancer cell migration. The lack of effect seen in this study may be because the concentrations were too low. Higher doses may impact cancer cell migration.

3. Examine the effects of porphyrins on more advanced cancer cell lines that are highly metastatic. The cancer cells used in this study were from early stage tumors. More aggressive lines may show greater sensitivity.

4. Evaluate the ability of porphyrins to inhibit metastasis and cancer cell invasion in vivo using animal models. This could better replicate the complex tumor environment.

5. Develop porphyrin derivatives or combination therapies to enhance the inhibition of cancer cell migration and metastasis. Structural modifications of porphyrins or combining with other anti-metastatic agents could improve efficacy.
