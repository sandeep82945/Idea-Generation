Although it is generally accepted that\nemotion regulation (ER) has numerous benefits for language teachers, in\nparticular university professors, little is known about how it interacts with\ntwo other important constructs, i.e., self-efficacy and L2 grit. Furthermore,\nthe effect of ER on L2 teacher grit has not been sufficiently investigated. To\nfill this gap, the current study was to test a structural model of English as a\nForeign Language (EFL) university professors\u2019 ER, self-efficacy, and L2 grit. The\nparticipants were 356 Iranian EFL university professors who completed the\nLanguage Teacher Emotion Regulation Inventory (LTERI), the Teacher Sense\nof Efficacy Scale (TSES), and the L2-Teacher Grit Scale (L2TGS). The results of\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that ER and self-efficacy were\nstrong predictors of L2 grit. Moreover, the significant role of self-efficacy\non ER was discovered. The implications of this study may foster effective\nteaching in higher education, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and\nits impacts on education.\nKEYWORDS\nhigher education, EFL university professors, ER, self-efficacy, L2 grit\nIntroduction\nTeaching at university is very demanding, and university professors should use a wide range of skills to teach and act effectively. It is necessary that teachers, in particular university professors be aware of what qualities and skills enhance an efficient instruction. Considering the indisputable relevance of teacher emotion and cognition to their effectiveness, it is prominent that teachers utilize useful methods in order to manage experienced emotions and boost cognitive affairs. In the domain of effective teaching, in particular language teaching, it seems plausible to presume\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nthat a higher level of emotional competencies helps teachers to manage and modify their performance. As Wubbels and Levy (1991) put it, emotional competencies affect not only the effectiveness of instructors but also the cognitive and emotional development of students, leading to successful and effective teaching. ER as a complex process refers to different strategies used for initiating, hampering, or modifying individuals\u2019 position or behavior in a specific circumstance (Gross, 1998a). Teacher emotion regulation (TER) refers to \u201ctheir capability to manage emotional experiences and expressions\u201d (Buric\u0301 et al., 2017, p. 2). Through the lens of emotion regulation (ER), teachers are able to evaluate and modify the intensity and duration of the emotional experiences at the workplace (Chang and Taxer, 2020). In ever-changing and challenging teaching contexts, TER acts as a shield to protect and immune teachers in the face of plights. The role of TER is more significant in language teaching because it is an emotionally charged endeavor (Tsang and Jiang, 2018; Richards, 2020).\nAnother key construct on the road to university professors\u2019 professional growth is self-efficacy. According to Bandura (1997, 1986), self-efficacy may be described as an individual\u2019s perception of their own capacity to successfully complete or display an activity or sequence of behaviors in a certain setting. From another view point, self-efficacy is defined as a cognitive, motivational, emotional, and selection-based regulator of performance (Bandura, 1994). Self-efficacious people set more challenging goals and envisage success. Based on Bandura (1997), self-efficacy beliefs play a significant role in the regulation of motivation and boost individuals\u2019 confidence in their abilities, which may also decrease the stress and depression that self-efficacious people experience in threatening or demanding conditions.\nMore specifically, self-efficacy beliefs influence the kind of activities and environments that individuals select. Selfefficacy beliefs affect individuals\u2019 thinking, their future actions, their coping strategies while facing emotional demands, and the attempts they put forth in a given endeavor (Bong and Clark, 1999; Bandura, 2012). Self-efficacy is both a personal and social construct because each person functions individually and collectively. Individuals\u2019 worries about the effectiveness of the group as a whole have an impact on the activities they choose to pursue together, how much attempt they make to perform it, their persistence and tolerance, and their probability of success (Bandura, 1994). Collective efficacy refers to a group\u2019s common beliefs in its ability to achieve goals and desired tasks (Schunk and Pajares, 2002). Teacher self-efficacy is defined as to the extend they have conviction to successfully execute behaviors to achieve educational objectives (Gibson and Dembo, 1984). Efficacious teachers tend to support, persevere during challenges, open to new ideas, and implement helpful teaching strategies (Gordon et al., 2022; Ma, 2022). Teachers with higher perceived self-efficacy are more engaged in their work activities (Buric\u0301 and Macuka, 2017; Li et al., 2019) and willing to\nimplement curriculum reform (Cerit, 2019). Efficacious teachers also deal with Students\u2019 misbehavior and demotivation more efficiently (Buric\u0301 and Kim, 2020).\nThe metaphor of teacher L2 grit is a personality trait resulting from an amalgamation of perseverance of attempt and teaching passion for long-term objectives (Sudina et al., 2021). Teacher L2 grit is quite uncharted territory, which awaits further research, and its relationships with other teacherrelated construct is still under a shadow, in particular in higher education. Teacher L2 grit might be of immediate relevance to TER and self-efficacy. Despite its dominant role, and perhaps because of the novelty of teacher L2 grit, research has not focused on the relationship between TER, self-efficacy views, and L2 grit. Especially within the realm of higher education. To this end, the present study set out to model the relationships between ER, efficacy beliefs, and L2 grit among EFL university professors. Exploring the relationship between these constructs, which are conductive to effectiveness may envision a picture of EFL of university professors\u2019 ER, self-efficacy, and L2 grit and accordingly their effectiveness."

That is, a specific situation is attended to, appraised, adjusted, and generates emotional responses (Gross, 2014). According to Gross and Barrett (2011), the activation of a regulatory objective, the engagement of regulatory mechanisms, and the alteration of the emotion trajectory are the three components that combine to produce ER. The activation of a goal is the first constituent of ER (Gross and Barrett, 2011). The activation of a goal might take place either inside oneself (via intrinsic ER) or within another individual (extrinsic ER) (Gross and Barrett, 2011). Intrinsic ER describes instances in which people modulate their own emotions (ER in self), while extrinsic ER is when one person regulates another person\u2019s emotions (ER in another). Specialists consider intrinsic ER for studies relevant to adults (Gross, 1998b), while in working with infants and children, extrinsic ER is highlighted (Cole et al., 2004). On some occasions, both intrinsic and extrinsic ER are applied; for instance, in one situation, a person may regulate another\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nperson\u2019s emotions (extrinsic regulation) to calm himself/herself down (intrinsic regulation) (Gross, 2014).\nThe second constituent of ER refers to the engagement of the processes involved in changing emotion trajectory. Different processes are involved in ER that may be explicit or implicit (Gross, 2014). If ER happens with conscious awareness, it is considered as explicit ER. For instance, when a person tries to consider the bright side of a bad happening to cheer themselves up, they are employing explicit ER (Gross, 2014). ER activities may also happen unconsciously and implicitly (Gross, 2014). For example, when individuals quickly turn their attention away from potentially annoying materials (Gross, 2014). In previous studies, explicit and implicit processes in ER are considered separately (Masters, 1991). However, it is recommended to consider ER processes as a spectrum that extends from overt, intentional, and deliberate control to covert, unconscious, seamless, and automatic regulation (Gyurak et al., 2011; Vadivel and Beena, 2019). The effect of ER on emotion dynamics is the third core feature of ER (Thomas, 1990). In this regard, Gross (1998b) pointed out that the ER can have an increased or decreased latency, rising time, size, length, or offset depending on the individual\u2019s objectives (Gross, 1998b). Moreover, as the emotion develops, ER may alter the degree to which the various components of the emotional reaction cohere (Dan-Glauser and Gross, 2013; Vadivel et al., 2021).\nOver the years, different ER models were developed to describe the involved procedures. The Hot/Cool System of ER, for example stimulates the processes involved in ER into willpower (Mischel and Ayduk, 2004). It is imagined that the cool system generated in adulthood helps individuals to keep calm in intensive emotional disturbances. Hot system developed in childhood working as quick emotional processing (Sutton and Harper, 2009; Liu et al., 2021). Another suggested model for ER is the Resources or Strength Model, which is supported by self-regulation theory (Schmeichel and Baumeister, 2004). A more comprehensive model is the process model of ER (Gross, 1998a,b, 2014; Gross and Thompson, 2007), which stipulated five temporal points in the process of emotion generation as follows: situation choice, situation adjustment, attentional deployment, cognitive transformation, and reaction modulation. According to the definitions provided by (Gross, 1998a,b), these five points illustrate five different families of ER processes.\nThe first four families of strategies (i.e., situation choice, situation adjustment, attentional deployment, cognitive transformation) are grouped as antecedent-focused. But, the fifth set (i.e., reaction modulation) modulates the aspects of the fully developed emotional response (Gross and Thompson, 2007). Situation selection, as the first step in ER, refers to employed strategies to decrease the likelihood of any happening that may trigger an undesirable emotion. Situation modification processes enhance changing the features of an occasion that evoke a specific emotion. Attentional deployment refers to individuals\u2019 attempts to redirect their attention to regulate their\nemotion. Cognitive change mainly alters the cognitive appraisal of a situation that triggers emotional experience by reforming an individual\u2019 thinking either by changing the situation or an individual\u2019 capacity to modify it. Response modulation, as the last process, refers to various strategies to intensify, reduce, or extend the physiological, experiential, or behavioral responding components of emotional responses (Gross, 2014).\nRegarding Language TER, recently a model was proposed by Heydarnejad et al. (2021b). This model was generated based on the existing literature on TER (e.g., Buric\u0301 et al., 2017; Chang, 2020; Chang and Taxer, 2020; Richards, 2020; Alipour et al., 2021; Chen and Cheng, 2021), ER (Gross and Thompson, 2007; Taxer and Gross, 2018) in particular, Gross\u2019 process model of ER (1998a,b, 2014). This suggested model for language TER involves six dimensions as following: situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, reappraisal, suppression, and seeking social support. Situation selection, situation modification, and attention deployment were formulated based on Gross\u2019 process model of ER (1998a,b, 2014). The two dimensions of reappraisal and suppression were generated based on Gross and John\u2019s findings (2003). Seeking social support, as the last dimension originated from Jennings and Greenberg (2009) as well as Taxer and Gross (2018).\nAs reviewing the existing literature on TER, in particular university professors reflected, this important concept is still in its infancy and calls for more research to fill this gap. The existing literature confirmed the contributions of ER to other teacher related constructs. For example, Morris and King (2018) investigated the influence of ER in controlling the frustration experienced by university professors in their classes. They found that using contextually dependent ER behaviors assist language university professors in improving their confidence levels and manage their stress. In another study by Chang and Taxer (2020), TER strategies regarding classroom misbehavior were examined. According to their outcomes, those teachers who reappraised were less touched by their learners\u2019 misbehavior; they also experienced less suppression. Taking a similar path, Morris and King (2018) found that emotion regulatory strategies were the best mechanism for managing frustrations among EFL university professors. In a mixed method study, the learners\u2019 attitudes toward their teachers\u2019 emotions and ER in the teaching processes were investigated by Jiang et al. (2016). Based on their findings, antecedent-focused emotion regulatory strategies were preferable to responsefocused ones. Furthermore, they concluded that teachers\u2019 reappraisals increased positive-emotion expressions. Recently, Fathi et al. (2021) investigated the relationship between teacher reflection, self-efficacy, burnout, and ER. Their findings suggested that teacher self-efficacy and reflection predicted ER. The negative relationship between ER and burnout was also confirmed by this study. Parallel with this line of inquiry, the mediator roles of teacher self-efficacy and ER on psychological wellbeing in an EFL context was concluded (Xiyun et al., 2022).\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org"

            "heading": "Teacher self-efficacy",
            "text": "Self-efficacy refers to individuals\u2019 impressions about their abilities to execute behaviors, leading to specific achievements (Bandura, 1982). Self-efficacy does not necessarily involve affective reactions toward the self, but it is mainly a cognitive judgment of one\u2019s ability that attach diverse weights to different sources of information when arriving at such perception (Bong and Clark, 1999). Teacher self-efficacy is defined as \u201cthe teacher\u2019s conviction in his or her capacity to plan and carry out a course of action necessary to effectively complete a given task in a specific situation\u201d (Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998, p. 22). Self-efficacy enhances teachers inter and intra-relationships (Martin and Mulvihill, 2019) and increases their passion for instructional practices (Mo\u00e8, 2016). Furthermore, teachers\u2019 efficacy beliefs influence Students\u2019 motivation, achievement, and efficacy (TschannenMoran et al., 1998). From another perspective, it is evident that teachers\u2019 self-efficacy predicts their attitude, teaching style, self-regulation, commitment, motivation, and effectiveness (Barni et al., 2019; Fathi and Saeedian, 2020; Fathi et al., 2021; Heydarnejad et al., 2021a; Amirian et al., 2022) and supports Students\u2019 academic achievement (Martin and Mulvihill, 2019).\nIn the current study, the Teachers\u2019 Sense of Efficacy Scale was utilized (Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2001), which includes three subscales (efficacy in student engagement, efficacy in instructional strategies, and efficacy in classroom management). The efficacy in student engagement focuses on the teachers\u2019 efficacy beliefs, which in turn fosters support for Students\u2019 learning and motivation. The instructional strategies consider the instructor\u2019 s capability to modify teaching to achieve learner needs. The classroom management evaluates the instructor\u2019s efficacy in managing learner behavior (Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2001; Azari Noughabi et al., 2022; Shirvan and Alamer, 2022).\nTeacher self-efficacy is generated from Bandura\u2019s selfefficacy theory, which concentrates on the teacher\u2019s beliefs of their abilities to involve their students in the learning processes effectively with the aim of realizing teaching and learning objectives efficiently (Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998; Sudina et al., 2020; Heydarnejad et al., 2021a). Bandura (1997) stipulated sources of efficacy beliefs as mastery experience, vicarious experience, social or verbal persuasion, and physiological or affective states. Mastery experience has the most influential role in self-efficacy beliefs, suggesting that successful performance increases self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997; Zarrinabadi et al., 2022). In other words, the perception of successful performance facilitates perceived self-efficacy and ensures future proficiency and success. In contrast, the perception of unsuccessful performance weakens efficacy beliefs and leads to the expectation that future performance will also be inefficient.\nAs Helsin (1997) stated, self-mastery may be accomplished by disassembling a difficult challenge into its component parts, which will increase the likelihood of one\u2019s first achievement. The second significant influence is rooted in observing other similar people to perform a behavior successfully. It can provide individuals with ideas about successful performance (Tompson and Dass, 2000). The third source is social or verbal persuasion which is originated from other people. Successful persuasion enhances individuals\u2019 beliefs in their abilities and ensures that future achievement is achievable (Wolfe, 1997). Whereas, negative persuasion may decrease self-beliefs. According to Schunk and Pajares (2002), the most contributing influence of social persuasion revolves around initiating a task, trying new strategies, and attempting hard to succeed. The fourth source, psychological and affective states such as engagement, anger, and anxiety provide information about efficacy perception and enhance the sense of proficiency. Therefore, attempting to reduce negative experiences and modifying negative debilitative states to positive facilitator states may help amend the perceived self-efficacy beliefs. The influence of these sources on selfefficacy is not automatic, but cognitively weighted and assessed (Bandura, 1997).\nThe importance of teacher self-efficacy among psychologists, educationalists, and social scientists has fueled intensive research over the last decades. For instance, Buric\u0301 and Kim (2020) found that teacher self-efficacy predicts classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate. Similarly, Buric\u0301 and Frenzel (2019) concluded that teacher self-efficacy is associated with anger in a negative direction. In the same vein, Li et al. (2019) affirmed that teachers\u2019 work engagement and self-efficacy were positively related. The beneficial effect of teachers\u2019 motivations on their self-efficacy, openness to change, and self-transcendence was confirmed by Barni et al. (2019). To picture the possible impact of teachers\u2019 self-efficacy and collective teacher efficacy on their psychological wellbeing, a study was conducted by Fathi et al. (2020) in the Iranian EFL context. Their data analysis indicated that teacher self-efficacy was a stronger predictor of psychological wellbeing than collective teacher efficacy. In a recent study, the contribution of critical thinking and self-efficacy beliefs to teaching style preferences among university professors was concluded (Amirian et al., 2022). In the same vein, the contributions of EFL teachers\u2019 self-efficacy and creativity on their Students\u2019 academic achievement was confirmed by Ma (2022)."

            "heading": "Teacher L2 grit",
            "text": "The Grit theory was introduced by Duckworth (2016), which emphasized that the reciprocal relationships of enthusiasm and persistence affected individuals\u2019 potential to achieve their goals effectively. As Duckworth et al. (2007)\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\ndefined grit refers to \u201cworking strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over the years despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress\u201d (pp. 1,087\u20131,088). Thus, enthusiasm and persistence are the key constructs in grit formation (Duckworth, 2016). Enthusiasm is a feeling of eager interest in or desire for a special subject or activity. Persistence is an element of the trait-level grit that provoke individuals to dedicate themselves to competence activities with long-term success (Duckworth, 2016). According to Dale et al. (2018), Grittier people have positive attitudes toward life and show high job dedication. Grit is enhanced when individuals understand the difference between high-priority and low-priority objectives and learn how to manage their energies (Hejazi and Sadoughi, 2022; Lan, 2022).\nTeacher grit is defined as the perseverance of effort and consistency of interest (Duckworth et al., 2007; Pawlak et al., 2022). Teacher grit attributes teachers in handling their stress which leads to effective teaching (Alamer, 2021; Sudina et al., 2021) and work engagement (Maiers and Sandvold, 2017; Namaziandost and \u00c7akmak, 2020). As it was evidenced, gritty teachers devote their energy to their teaching for a long time and enjoy their teaching procedures even if they encounter problems at the workplace (Sudina et al., 2021). Although studies in the realm of language learners\u2019 grit were quite rosy in recent years (e.g., Khajavy et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020; Cheng, 2021; Khajavy, 2021; Yang et al., 2022), language teachers\u2019 L2 grit and its correlates are quite untouched (Sudina et al., 2021; Li, 2022). As Teimouri et al. (2020) discussed, this shortage can be attributed to a lack of domain-specific scales to measure grit in Second Language Acquisition (SLA). As it was concluded by Cormier et al. (2019) and Yang et al. (2022), grit is a domain-specific construct. This idea encouraged Sudina et al. (2021) to propose the model of L2 grit among language teachers. Teacher L2 grit is considered a personality trait that involves perseverance of effort and consistency of interest (Sudina et al., 2021). In this regard, Sudina et al. (2021) developed and validated L2-Teacher Grit Scale (L2TGS) to evaluate the L2 grit among language teachers.\nDue to the recent introduction of language teachers\u2019 L2 grit in 2021, the existing gaps in empirical studies echo a clear need to investigate the correlates of language teachers\u2019 L2 with other teacher-related constructs. Recently, Ashkani et al. (2021) conducted a study to inspect teachers\u2019 cognitive and behavioral manifestations of pedagogical beliefs and how teacher grit influences these two constructs in EFL contexts. Based on their findings, the grittier teachers presented strong associations between their beliefs and actual instructional practices. Moreover, they concluded that teacher grit predicted the relationships between EFL teachers\u2019 self-reported pedagogical beliefs and their actual practices. Confirming the scant attention to L2 teacher grit, a theoretical analysis was completed by Xu (2022), in which the theoretical and empirical literature related to teachers\u2019 hope, trust, and grit were reviewed. Shabani et al. (2022) examined to what extend pedagogical thoughts vary as a\nfunction of EFL teachers\u2019 levels of grit. Their findings revealed that there were significant differences between low grit and high grit teachers considering the subscales of pedagogical thoughts. In the same line of inquiry, Liu (2022) concluded that gritty teachers are more motivated and enjoy the experience of language Instruction. In the realm of university students, Baierschmidt (2022) highlighted the significant role of grit as a predictor of foreign language proficiency."

            "text": "In ever-changing and challenging teaching contexts, teachers in general and university professors, in particular, are exposed to various emotional experiences at the workplace. On such occasions, they need to be equipped with self-aid constructs to help them decide and act effectively. Through the lens of ER and self-efficacy, university teachers are expected to sustain their interest and make more effort to accomplish the established goals (L2 grit). Despite this, it appears that university TER and L2 grit are uncharted territories that await further research. Only within the last decades, TER has generated considerable attention from educators and researchers (Jiang et al., 2016; Taxer and Gross, 2018; Chang, 2020; Chen and Cheng, 2021), although it is virtually unexplored in the L2 domain (Richards, 2020; Alipour et al., 2021; Heydarnejad et al., 2021b). The same is true for L2 grit with emphasis that this concept was generated in 2021 and echoes urgent needs for further research.\nMoreover, TER and L2 grit as well as their influences on other factors and constructs conductive to effective teaching remained relatively unexplored in the field of second/foreign language education. Having attributed this gap, this study sought to propose a model to portray the relationships between ER, self-efficacy beliefs, and L2 grit with the prospect of shedding light on these issues and initiating further research (see Figure 1). The findings of this research may be both theoretically and practically significant. Such a study provides information to be taken into consideration by policymakers, language planners, curriculum designers, language teachers, university professors, as well as learners and their parents. Furthermore, the result of this study could provide Iranian EFL teachers and researchers with an awareness that can help them advance the more meaningful and effective teaching and learning strategies. To this end, the following research questions were posited:\nRQ1: To what extent does EFL university professors\u2019 ER predict their L2 grit?\nRQ2: To what extent does EFL university professors\u2019 selfefficacy predict their L2 grit?\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Theoretical structural equation model.\nThe following null hypotheses were formulated based on the above-mentioned research questions:\nH01.

That is, teacher self-efficacy beliefs significantly and positively\ninfluenced perseverance in teaching (\u03b2 = 0.78, t = 14.10) as well as passion and purpose in teaching (\u03b2 = 0.66, t = 11.92).\nTo investigate the relationships between TER, selfefficacy beliefs, and L2 grit, a Pearson product-moment correlation was utilized.\nAs Table 5 indicates, there were significant relationships among ER and the subcategories of L2 grit were as follows: passion and purpose in teaching (r = 0.912, p < 0.01) as well as perseverance in teaching (r = 0.834, p < 0.01). Considering the correlations among self-efficacy beliefs and the sub-components of L2 grit, the results were as following: perseverance in teaching (r = 0.834, p < 0.01) as well as passion and purpose in teaching (r = 0.719, p < 0.01)."

            "text": "The aim of the current study was to uncover the interrelatedness of language TER, self-efficacy, and L2 grit. This aim was accomplished by utilizing a structural equation modeling approach targeting at building a causal structural model by which the contribution of each of the aforementioned constructs can be estimated. Data analyses indicated that ER and self-efficacy skills predict grit tendencies among EFL university professors (see Model 1). The contribution of self-efficacy beliefs to ER was also found (see Model 1). Additionally, the influence of ER and self-efficacy beliefs on the two subcomponents of L2T grit was confirmed (see Model 2). Henceforth, the first null hypothesis (H01. EFL university professors\u2019 ER does not predict their L2 grit.) and second null hypothesis (H02. EFL university professors\u2019 self-efficacy does not predict their L2 grit.) were rejected, and it can be inferred that these constructs (teacher emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and L2 grit) are inextricably interwoven.\nDiscussing the first research question\nAs the data screening suggests, the effect of ER on L2 teacher grit was significantly positive (see Model 1 and 2). It means that ER influenced passion and purpose in teaching (the first subcomponent) and perseverance in teaching (the second subcomponent). It is implied that ER affects university professors\u2019 attitudes and teaching engagement, that leads to their flourishing cognitive accomplishment of them. In other words, teacher ER acts as a campus and gives direction to perform effectively. Scrutinizing the relevant literature on TER and L2 grit presented no identical studies. A recent study in the domain of language learning (Shafiee Rad and Jafarpour, 2022) confirmed that\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 T-values for path coefficient significance (model 1).\npositive emotions interventions influence learner L2 grit, ER, and resilience. Similar findings reflecting the reciprocal relationship between L2 grit, emotions and academic achievement were supported by the results of Ghanbari and Abdolrezapour (2021) as well as Khajavy and Aghaee (2022).\nBased on the language TER model (Heydarnejad et al., 2021b), ER is the experience of appraisal, attention deployment, situation modification, seeking social support, situation selection, and to some extent, suppression. According to the teacher L2 grit model (Sudina et al., 2021), teacher L2 grit is assumed as the triggering element\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nprovoking perseverance of effort and consistency of interest. Regulation of emotions, which are inevitable parts of teaching improve the strategies that teachers apply (Heydarnejad et al., 2017; teacher\u2019 work life balance and their relationships with students Mulyani et al., 2021). Thus, it can be implied that when university teachers achieve a balance in their emotional states, they can effectively manage their attitudes and skills, which results in responsible decisions. In this regard, Li (2020) noted that grittier teachers are positively engaged and interested in their activities; they make efforts\nand try to do their best even they face challenges and failures.\nDiscussing the second research question\nThe outcome of the present study also confirmed the predictive power of university professors\u2019 self-efficacy beliefs on their L2 grit (see Model 1). That is, university professors\u2019 beliefs in their ability to effectively handle the tasks, obligations, and challenges related to their professional activity (self-efficacy beliefs) foster dedication to and passion for the teaching (L2 grit). Moreover, the results suggested that university professors\u2019 self-efficacy beliefs correlate positively with teacher L2 grit subcomponents. In other words, it is found out that self-efficacy beliefs were associated firstly with perseverance in teaching, and then with passion and purpose in teaching. This result is in accord with the findings of Joy et al. (2020), highlighting the role of self-efficacy skills in boosting grit among school teachers. The intertwined relationships between self-efficacy and L2 grit in the learning context were concluded in the L2 context (Yang et al., 2022). They also emphasize the impact of teachers\u2019 role in helping learners manage their emotions to enhance\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 5 T-values for path coefficient significance (model 2).\nefficacy and grit. This finding is in line with the outcomes of Shabani et al. (2022). They concluded that teacher L2 grit is the product of self-reflection, efficacy skills, and affective evaluation.\nBandura\u2019s self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1982), as the foundation of teacher self-efficacy theory, demonstrates that efficacious teachers implement mastery experiences for cognitive development, which is a powerful predictor of teaching performance. Self-efficacy has become an important framework in education to predict and explain the perceptions\nTABLE 5 The correlation coefficients among TSE, LTER, and L2G\u2019 subscales.\nTSE LTER Perseverance in teaching\nPassion and purpose in teaching\nTSE 1\nLTER 0.694** 1\nPerseverance in teaching 0.813** 0.834** 1\nPassion and purpose in teaching\n0.719** 0.912** 0.532** 1\n**Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).\nand judgments that influence teachers\u2019 and university professors\u2019 decisions and actions in the classroom. The Grit theory (Duckworth, 2016) as well as teacher L2 grit (Sudina et al., 2021), suggest that perseverance and passion for overcoming challenges are inevitable parts of gritty teachers\u2019 traits. This personality trait helps them expand their efforts and keep enthusiastic despite obstacles and inadequate progress. Thus, the results of this study can be interpreted through the lens of these theories that affirm self-efficacy serves to manage teachers\u2019 cognitions and emotions, leading to higher and longer professional development (Duckworth and Gross, 2014).\nAdditionally, ER was discovered to be significantly affected by self-efficacy beliefs as well (see Model 2). According to these data, it can be inferred that quite apart from its direct influences, self-efficacy appeared to assist university professors in modulating their experienced emotions. That is to say, the levels of teacher efficacy positively correlate with increased ER among EFL university professors. This result corroborates with those of Heydarnejad et al. (2021a) and Xiyun et al. (2022), as well as Fathi et al. (2020). Moreover, the findings from Zee and Koomen (2016) and Cansoy et al. (2020) evinced that teacher self-efficacy and their psychological wellbeing are interwoven. Based on selfefficacy theory (Bandura, 1982), teacher efficacy develops from a\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\ncombination of mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological and emotional states. It can be inferred that all of them are directly and indirectly connected to components of the language TER model (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, reappraisal, suppression, and seeking social support). This means that efficacious university professors have high levels of selfawareness, self-worth, and self-perception; thus, they can positively guide actions and responses to the emotional demands of their teaching. Consequently, they can develop relatively positive emotion regulatory strategies that pave the way for stability in the teaching profession."

            "text": "This investigation highlighted the significant contribution of ER and self-efficacy to L2 grit, and provided strong empirical confirmation that via the help of ER and self-efficacy, university professors can ameliorate their practice for a longer period of time even in the face of teaching chaos and complexities. This leads to a positive attitude toward the teaching profession in higher education, which heightens success instead of failure. Furthermore, the present study reflected that the effect of university professors\u2019 self-efficacy on ER is also significant. Taken together, these findings suggest the predictive role of ER and self-efficacy in promoting L2 grit. In the domain of language teaching, especially in higher education, exploring the relationship between these constructs is quite rare. Thus, this domain is a fertile field and calls for more empirical studies, which pave the path for promoting teachers\u2019 wellbeing and effective pedagogy."

            "text": "The findings of this study suggest some pedagogical implications for educators in higher education. The knowledge about situational and personality determinants of ER strategies and their efficiency is vital and should be considered in higher education program. Such training programs should concentrate on practicing the broad repertoire of strategies and showing the conditions under which, they are effective or not. Moreover, training should focus on reflecting more on university professors\u2019 own traits and preferences that may influence the effectiveness of their employed ER strategies. This information, also incites university professors to alter or modify their employed ER strategies to more positive ones, which are in turn expected to facilitate their self-efficacy beliefs and L2 grit.\nIn the area of language teaching training programs, some international centers such as TESOL and CELTA are preparing\nspecialized language teachers around the world. In Iran, preservice and in-service teacher training programs are held, and teacher trainers can make a significant contribution by instructing EFL university professors about the importance of emotions and ways to regulate and modify their emotions. Furthermore, the implications of this research would be of great help to be considered in pre-service and in-service teacher training programs, which are usually held for university professors. Practicing self-aid skills (i.e., self-evaluation, selfefficacy, self-awareness, and self-regulation) in pre-service and in-service teacher training pogroms, particularly in higher education could boost L2 grit and foster efficient teaching, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic and university lockdown. These programs are expected to pinpoint the effective path for enhancing their effective teaching.\nLimitations and suggestions for future researchers\nThe findings of this research suffer from some limitations: Firstly, this study employed quantitative design. To have a deeper understanding of the causal links among the variables, future research can apply mixed-method approaches to delve into the relationship between university professors\u2019 ER, self-efficacy, L2 grit, and other teacher-related constructs (e.g., work engagement, autonomy, critical thinking, job satisfaction, reflective teaching, self-regulation, and immunity). Secondly, the effects of participants\u2019 demographic variables on ER, self-efficacy beliefs, and L2 grit were not explored, which can be a suggestion for future research. Lastly, due to practical constraints, the participants were chosen according to convenience sampling. Which is not truly representative. Therefore, results from this study should be interpreted and generalized with great caution. Concerning delimitations, this study is to focus on the employed ER strategies by EFL university professors at the workplace. Furthermore, to assess EFL university professors\u2019 ER, a trait approach was utilized. That is, frequently and intensively ER strategies in response to emotional experiences at the workplace were assessed retrospectively.\nAs a future research avenue, it is recommended to use a new method of data gathering called the Experiential Sampling Method (ESM) in future studies, which can assess emotions at the intra-individual level. The experience sampling method (ESM) is used to evaluate emotions contextualized in realworld settings. This method helps researchers decrease memory biases and increase ecological validity, and hypothesize testing at the between- and within-person levels. Furthermore, it is recommended to undertake further research to explore whether TER influences their learners\u2019 ER. As a further suggestion,\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nresearchers can explore the relationships between ER, selfefficacy, and L2 grit in other educational contexts such as schools and private language institutes."
