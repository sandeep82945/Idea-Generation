    "abstractText": "F1 domain of ATP synthase is a rotary ATPase complex in which rotation of central \u03b3subunit proceeds in 120 \u030a steps against a surrounding \u03b13\u03b23 fueled by ATP hydrolysis. How the ATP hydrolysis reactions occurring in three catalytic \u03b1\u03b2 dimers are coupled to mechanical rotation is a key outstanding question. Here we describe catalytic intermediates of the F1 domain during ATP mediated rotation captured using cryo-EM. The structures reveal that three catalytic events and the first 80 \u030a rotation occur simultaneously in F1 domain when nucleotides are bound at all the three catalytic \u03b1\u03b2 dimers. The remaining 40 \u030a rotation of the complete 120 \u030a step is driven by completion of ATP hydrolysis at \u03b1D\u03b2D, and proceeds through three sub-steps (83 \u030a, 91 \u030a, 101 \u030a, and 120 \u030a) with three associated conformational intermediates. All sub-steps except for one between 91 \u030a and 101 \u030a associated with phosphate release, occur independently of the chemical cycle, suggesting that the 40 \u030a rotation is largely driven by release of intramolecular strain accumulated by the 80 \u030a rotation. Together with our previous results, these findings provide the molecular basis of ATP driven rotation of ATP synthases. . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

FoF1 consists of a hydrophilic F1 domain containing three catalytic sites9, and a hydrophobic Fo domain housing a proton translocation channel10,11 (Fig. 1a). The movement of protons through the translocation\nchannel of F0 drives rotation of the -stalk and this catalyzes the conversion of ADP to ATP at the 33 dimer catalytic sites referred to as \u03b1E\u03b2E, \u03b1T\u03b2T, and \u03b1D\u03b2D. Upon dissociation from the Fo domain, the F1 domain can catalyze the reverse reaction, i.e. hydrolysis of ATP driven by rotation of the central \u03b3 subunit inside the cylinder comprising \u03b13\u03b23 (Fig. 1b,c). The catalytic sites are located at interface between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit in each catalytic dimer. Most of the residues involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis are found in the \u03b2 subunit, although residues in the \u03b1 subunit are also involved12,13. The binding change mechanism of ATP synthesis at the F1 domain by rotation of the \u03b3 subunit relative to \u03b13\u03b23 was firstly proposed by P. Boyer 9,14. According to this mechanism, the three catalytic dimers adopt different conformational states, and they interconvert sequentially between three the different conformations as catalysis proceeds. Strong support for this asymmetrical F1 arrangement was confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure of mitochondrial F1 (MF1) 13, which revealed the three catalytic \u03b2 subunits in different conformational states and with different nucleotide occupancy at the catalytic sites; closed \u03b2DP with ADP, closed \u03b2TP with ATP analogue, and open \u03b2E with no bound nucleotide. Rotation of F1 driven by ATP hydrolysis was directly demonstrated in single molecule observations using bacterial F1 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus 15. When using 40 nm gold beads with almost negligible viscous resistance, F1 pauses at the 80\u02da dwell position during the 120\u02da rotation step at an ATP concentration close to the Km 16. Histogram analysis of the frequency of dwell times for each dwell position suggests a model in which binding of ATP to F1 at 0\u00b0 causes an initial 80\u02da rotation step of \u03b3 subunit, followed by a 40\u00b0 rotation of the \u03b3 subunit due to hydrolysis of ATP and release of phosphate at the 80\u00b0 dwell position (Fig. 1d)16,17. In addition, measurement of the rotational velocity of the rotating probe with viscous resistance or external force suggests that F1 converts the hydrolysis energy of ATP into torque with high efficiency18,19. However, single-molecule observation experiments only allow observation of the motion of the individual \u03b3 subunits\nto which the observation probe is bound, and do not inform on what events are occurring at each catalytic site. In order to elucidate the entire F1 rotation mechanism driven by ATP, we set out to determine the cryo-EM structures of catalytic intermediates of the F1 domain during rotation. By freezing cryo-EM grids at different time points or under different reaction conditions, it is possible to trap intermediate states and thus build up a picture of the chemo-mechanical cycle of motor proteins step by step20. Previously, we have determined several intermediate structures of V/A-ATPase revealing an unprecedented level of detail for the ATP hydrolysis cycle in these enzymes. The results showed that catalytic events occur simultaneously at the three catalytic sites of A3B3 stator, driving the 120\u02da rotation of the central rotor21. Sobti et al. also performed snapshot analysis using a mutant F1 exhibiting slow ATP hydrolysis and obtained structures corresponding to both the 0\u02da and 80\u02da rotation angles of \u03b3 subunit22. They proposed, however, a different rotation model of rotary ATPase, in which ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis drive the initial 80\u02da rotation and the 40\u02da rotation of F1, respectively. As a result, the coupling of the chemo-mechanical cycle of rotary ATPases remains controversial, 60 years after Boyer first predicted the rotary catalytic mechanism of ATP synthase. Here, we describe multiple reaction intermediates of the wild type of FoF1 from G. stearothermophilus captured using cryoEM. These structural intermediates of the F1 domain fill in the missing pieces in the rotation scheme and have allowed us to redraw the complete chemo-mechanical coupling scheme of rotation in FoF1 powered by ATP hydrolysis."

            "text": "The ATP hydrolytic activity of G. stearothermophilus FoF1 is very low due to the up-form of the C-terminus of \u03b5 subunit23,24. In this study, we used the \u0394\u03b5CT-FoF1 mutant, less susceptible to \u03b5 inhibition by truncation of \u03b5-C-terminal helix than the wild-type24. The \u0394\u03b5CT-FoF1 expressed in E. coli membranes was solubilized in DDM, then purified as described previously24. The \u0394\u03b5CT-FoF1 exhibited ATPase activity, which obeyed simple Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics with a Vmax of 164 s -1 and a Km of 30 \u03bcM (Extended Data Fig.1a). The purified \u0394\u03b5CT-FoF1 was subjected to nucleotide depletion treatment by dialysis against EDTA-phosphate buffer, in order to deplete endogenous nucleotide. The enzymatic properties of the nucleotide depleted enzyme (ND-\u0394\u03b5CT-FoF1) were almost identical to the non-depleted enzyme (Extended Data Fig.1b). Both depleted and nondepleted forms of the purified enzymes were concentrated then subjected to a cryo-grid preparation as described below. The \u0394\u03b5CT-FoF1 is referred to simply as FoF1, hereafter.\nStructures of hydrolysable (81\u02da) and post-hyd (83\u02da) at high [ATP] Cryo-grids were prepared using a reaction mixture of ND-FoF1, containing 26 mM ATP to final concentration, a condition termed high [ATP]. The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 sec at 25 \u02daC, and then loaded onto a holey grid, followed by flash freezing. The flow charts showing image acquisition and reconstitution of the 3D structure of FoF1 at high [ATP] are summarized in Extended Data Fig.2b. The particles containing three rotational states (154 k particles) were subjected to 3D classification focused on the F1 domain in order to obtain sub-states of the F1 domain. As the result of this classification, three sub-classes of the F1 domain were obtained with different \u03b3 positions, termed the 80\u02da, 100\u02da and 120\u02da structures (Extended Data Fig.2b). Each structure was further classified by a masked classification. The two F1 domain 80\u02da structures were obtained from 56 k particles using an \u03b1D\u03b2D covering mask (Extended Data Fig.2b). The two 80\u02da structures shared the canonical asymmetric hexamer which adopts the closed \u03b1T\u03b2T, closed \u03b1D\u03b2D, and open \u03b1E\u03b2E conformation (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig.4). The angle of the \u03b3 subunits in the two 80\u02da structures relative to the 0\u02da structure were 81\u02da and 83\u02da, respectively (Fig. 3c). The nucleotide bound to the \u03b1D\u03b2D differed between the two structures. In the \u03b1D\u03b2D of the 81\u02da structure, ATP was identified at the catalytic site (Fig. 2c, left) and thus we termed the 81\u02da structure as hydrolysable given that the density in the corresponding 81\u02da structure at low [ATP] (Fig. 2c, right) is likely to contain ADP and Pi (see later for more details). In contrast, the 83\u02da structure obtained at high [ATP] clearly contained ADP and Pi and is designated post-hydrolyzed (post-hyd) (Fig. 2c, center). The overall structures of \u03b1T\u03b2T and \u03b1E\u03b2E in the hydrolysable and post-hyd states are mostly identical, but the \u03b1D\u03b2D structures differ slightly. In the post-hyd, the CT domain of \u03b2D was in a slightly more open conformation relative to that in hydrolysable (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 5). In both hydrolysable and post-hyd, ATP and Pi were identified at the catalytic sites of \u03b1E\u03b2E. The Pi is occluded by \u03b2/164K, \u03b2/190E, \u03b2/191K, \u03b2/252D, \u03b2/256R, and \u03b1/365R (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Since \u03b2E has an open structure, the site occupied by Pi is separated from the site where ATP is bound. Therefore, in this state the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP does not directly interact with the bound Pi. For other structures obtained under high [ATP], as described in the next section, ATP was identified at the catalytic sites of \u03b1E\u03b2E (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 4d). This indicates that \u03b1E\u03b2E is capable of binding of ATP to the catalytic site, regardless of the rotary angle of the \u03b3 subunit.\nStructures at 91\u02da, 101\u02da and 120\u02da rotation angles at high [ATP]\nTwo additional structures found to be rotated a further 8\u02da and 28\u02da relative to the post-hyd (83\u02da), respectively, were classified (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We termed these the 91\u02da and 101\u02da structures (Extended Data Fig. 4). In both structures, ATP was identifiable at the catalytic site of \u03b1E\u03b2E, but Pi is additionally bound to the 91\u02da as well as the hydrolysable and post-hyd forms (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 4d). In contrast, Pi is not present at the catalytic site of \u03b1E\u03b2E in the 101\u02da structure, indicating that Pi is released during the 10\u02da rotation of the \u03b3 subunit from 91\u02da to 101\u02da. The \u03b1E\u03b2E in 101\u02da adopts a more open structure than that seen in the 91\u02da structure due to movement of the CT domain of \u03b1E (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 4d). This more open arrangement results in a more exposed catalytic site in \u03b1E\u03b2E and thus a decrease in affinity for Pi in the 101\u02da structure. The geometry of the amino acid residues in \u03b2E that coordinate Pi changes due to the release of Pi (Fig. 3e), but no significant change in the conformation of the main chain in \u03b2E was observed (Fig. 3a), suggesting that the release of Pi directly does not cause the opening of \u03b1E\u03b2E. Two 120\u02da structures were classified (Extended Data Fig. 2b) according to structural differences in \u03b1T\u03b2T. One 120\u02da structure, termed step-waiting, has a more closed \u03b1T\u03b2T than the second, termed 120\u02da. \u03b1T\u03b2T in 120\u02da is almost identical to that of the 101\u02da structure (Fig. 3a, b and Extended Data Fig. 7a). The difference in \u03b1T\u03b2T between 120\u02da and step-waiting is the result of movement of the CT domain of the \u03b1T subunit (Fig. 3a, b and Extended Data Fig. 7). Thus, sequential structural changes occur; a structural change from 101\u02da to the 120\u02da associated with the 19\u02da rotation of the \u03b3 subunit, followed by closing of \u03b1T\u03b2T which occurs between 120\u02da and step-waiting. Notably, the 19\u02da step of the \u03b3-subunit from the 101\u02da to the 120\u02da occurs independently of the catalytic cycle of ATP, such as Pi release and ATP hydrolysis in the F1 domain. Comparing the four conformational states, hydrolysable, post-hyd, 91\u02da, 101\u02da, the difference in \u03b2D among these structures is more marked than that of \u03b2E and \u03b2T. As the rotational angle of the \u03b3 subunit increases, the \u03b2D adopts a more open structure due to movement of the CT domain but remains bound to both ADP and Pi (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). The motion of the CT domain in \u03b2D continues until the rotation angle of the \u03b3 subunit reaches 101\u02da (Fig. 3b). The \u03b1D\u03b2D dimer in the 101\u02da and 120\u02da structures can be described as half open (\u03b1D\u03b2D HO). This conformational change of \u03b1D\u03b2D also occurs largely independently of the catalytic cycle of ATP, with the exception of the release of Pi occurring between 91\u02da and 101\u02da. This suggests that the opening of \u03b1D\u03b2D is largely driven by the release of strain on the molecule accumulated in the initial 80\u02da rotation step."

The solution was incubated at 25\u02daC for 60 seconds and then loaded onto a holey grid followed by flash freezing. The flow charts showing image acquisition and reconstitution of the 3D structure of FoF1 at low [ATP] are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3b. From the combined 75 k particles for the 80\u02da structure, three intermediate structures, two post-hyd and one hydrolysable were classified. The two post-hyd structures are almost identical, including the angle of the \u03b3 subunit, apart from a slightly more open structure of the \u03b2D being evident in one of the forms. Both hydrolysable and post-hyd structures obtained at low [ATP] were very similar to the corresponding structures obtained at high [ATP] (Extended Data Table 1), but there were significant differences. In the hydrolysable and post-hyd structures obtained at low [ATP], Pi was identified at the catalytic site of \u03b1E\u03b2E, but no ATP density was observed (Figs. 2d and 4a). In addition, ATP molecule was not found in other obtained structures at low [ATP] (Fig. 4a, d and Extended Data Fig. 6d, e) indicating that ATP does not bind to \u03b1E\u03b2E at low [ATP]. This contrasts with the binding of ATP to all 80\u02da structures of \u03b1E\u03b2E obtained at high [ATP] (Extended Data Fig. 4d). As described above, ADP and Pi were identified at the \u03b1D\u03b2D binding site in hydrolysable at low [ATP] (Fig. 2c), indicating that ATP and (ADP + Pi) are in equilibrium at the catalytic site of \u03b1D\u03b2D in hydrolysable. This also suggests that ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic site does not directly cause rotation of the \u03b3 subunit, consistent with the binding change mechanism where ATP synthesis at the catalytic site is dependent on rotation of \u03b3 subunit1. From the combined 332 k particles for 120\u02da structure at low [ATP], three structures of the F1 domain, 91\u02da and 120\u02da and step-waiting, were identified (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The 101\u02da structure was not captured in this condition. At high [ATP], the F1 domain of 120\u02da and step-waiting were composed of the \u03b1D\u03b2D HO with ADP and Pi bound, \u03b1T\u03b2T with ATP, and \u03b1E\u03b2E with ATP (Extended Data Fig. 4). However, at low [ATP], ATP nor Pi density was identified at the catalytic site of \u03b1E\u03b2E in either the 120\u02da and step-waiting states (Fig. 4a, d). We refer to the step-waiting containing an empty \u03b1E\u03b2E as ATP-waiting. In summary, ATP was not identified at \u03b1E\u03b2E in all six structures, hydrolysable, post-hyd, 91\u02da, 120\u02da, and ATP-waiting, obtained at low [ATP]. Comparing these results with the nucleotide occupancy of \u03b1E\u03b2E in all structures obtained at high [ATP] indicates that ATP is capable of binding to \u03b1E\u03b2E independent of the rotation angle of \u03b3 in the F1 domain (Fig. 5)."

The first 80\u02darotation occurring via step-waiting of rotational state 1 is coupled with structural transition of three catalytic dimers, \u03b1E\u03b2E to \u03b1T\u03b2T, \u03b1T\u03b2T to \u03b1D\u03b2D, and \u03b1D\u03b2D HO to \u03b1E\u03b2E (Fig 5b, c).

Based on single molecule observation experiments for F1-ATPase, the coupling scheme for chemo-mechanical cycle of F1-ATPase proposed that rotation occurs simultaneously with ATP binding to the structure at a rotation angle of 0\u02da (Fig. 1d)16-18. In contrast, structural snapshots of V-type ATP synthase (V/A-ATPase) revealed that the 120\u02da rotations occur after all three catalytic sites are occupied by nucleotides (Extended Data Fig. 8a)21. The snapshot analysis of FoF1 structures in this study indicates that binding of ATP to empty \u03b1E\u03b2E in ATP-waiting results in step-waiting in which all three catalytic sites are occupied by nucleotides, then the first 80\u02darotation starts (Fig. 5c). This means that ATP binding to the F1 domain does not immediately cause the 80\u02da rotation. Our results clearly demonstrate that FoF1 and V/A-ATPase share a common tri-site mechanism in which nucleotide occupancy transitions between 2 and 3 binding sites during continuous catalysis2.\nThe 80\u02da dwell A further major insight is that the 80\u02da dwell during the 120\u02da step observed in F1-ATPase is the result of waiting for ATP hydrolysis at the \u03b1D\u03b2D. Either ATP or ADP and Pi was observed at the \u03b1D\u03b2D in hydrolysable (Fig. 2c), indicating that hydrolysis of ATP proceeds at \u03b1D\u03b2D in hydrolysable. Notably, the \u03b1D\u03b2D in hydrolysable has the most closed conformation, adopting a slightly more open conformation in the following post-hyd state, (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Figs. 4c and 5a, b). In the \u03b1D\u03b2D of hydrolysable, the \u03b3phosphate of ATP interacts with \u03b2/Glu190 and \u03b2/Arg192 residues, and the adenine ring\ninteracts with the \u03b2/Tyr341 in the CT domain (Fig. 2c). Therefore, ATP bound to the catalytic site of \u03b1D\u03b2D stabilizes the closed conformation of the \u03b2 subunit. Once ATP at the catalytic site is hydrolyzed, \u03b1D\u03b2D is then able to structurally transition to a more open conformation (Extended data Figs. 5c, d). Indeed, the structure of \u03b1D\u03b2D gradually becomes more open as the rotation of the \u03b3 subunit proceeds, to the half open \u03b1D\u03b2D HO state visible in the 120\u02da ATP/step waiting state (Fig. 5e-i). Based on the dwell time analysis at the 80\u02darotation angle of F1, it has been proposed that two or more catalytic events, including ATP hydrolysis and Pi release, contribute to the 80\u02da dwell16,17. Our results support that the dwell at this rotation angle is due mainly to ATP hydrolysis, but is also dependent on the structural transition from the hydrolysable to the post-hyd states (Figs. 5d, e)."

            "heading": "The subsequent 40\u02da rotation step",
            "text": "The third finding is that the final 40\u02darotation of the 120\u02dastep is composed of three short sub-steps (Figs. 5e-h), that are largely uncoupled from ATP hydrolysis occurring in the F1 domain. In previously suggested rotational model of F1, the dissociation of Pi at 80\u02da is reported to drive the last 40\u02da of rotation (Fig. 1d) 17,25. However our structures reveal that the Pi remains both following rotation beyond 80 \u02da, and indeed the structure of \u03b1E\u03b2E without Pi in 101\u02da indicates that release of Pi occurs during the structural transition from 91\u02da to 101\u02da. The rotation of the \u03b3-subunit associated with Pi release is only 10\u02da (Figs. 5f, g), suggesting that the contribution of conformational changes to Pi release (or Pi release by conformational change) is small. Other conformational changes, such as the 8\u02da step of post-hyd to 91\u02da and the 19\u02da step between 101\u02da and 120\u02da, occur independently of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. In addition, the \u03b1T\u03b2T of ATP-waiting adopts a more closed conformation after the structural transition from 120\u02da to step-waiting without rotation of the \u03b3 subunit (Fig. 3b, right). The only explanation for these spontaneous conformational rearrangement, uncoupled from chemical reactions, is that they are caused by the release of strain inside the molecule. The 80\u02da and 120\u02da (0\u02da) structures identified in the F1 domain of FoF1 are also observed in F1-ATPase 22. Therefore, the strain inside the molecule that drives the 40\u02da step is most likely of F1 origin. For instance, a comparison of the \u03b3 subunit in the 101\u02da and 120\u02da structures shows a slight structural difference (Extended Data Fig. 8). Together, our results strongly suggest that these structural changes, including the 10\u02da step of 91\u02da associated with Pi release, is driven by the release of the internal molecular strain accumulated by the initial 80\u02da rotation.\nPrinciple of rotation mechanism of ATP synthases\nTaken together, these structural snapshots of the F1 domain indicate that FoF1 functions via a similar mechanism to the ATP-driven rotation of V/A-ATPase that we have previously demonstrated21 (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The binding of ATP to empty ABopen, corresponding to \u03b1E\u03b2E, in V2nuc with two nucleotides bound forms V3nuc with nucleotides bound to all three AB dimers (ABopen with ATP, ABsemi with ATP, and ABclosed with ADP and Pi). Three distinguishable catalytic events occur at the three AB dimers simultaneously and these events contribute to the first 120\u02da step of the rotor in a concerted manner (Extended Data Fig. 9b)21. Considering each 120\u02dastep, the rotation mechanism of FoF1 and V/A-ATPase is almost identical. ATP binds to the F1 domain of ATP-waiting, resulting in the step-waiting where the three catalytic sites are occupied with nucleotides, corresponded to V3nuc. Step-waiting comprises \u03b1E\u03b2E with ATP, \u03b1T\u03b2T with ATP, and \u03b1D\u03b2D HO with ADP and Pi. Each conformational change, from \u03b1E\u03b2E to \u03b1T\u03b2T, \u03b1T\u03b2T to \u03b1D\u03b2D HO, and \u03b1D\u03b2D HO to \u03b1E\u03b2E occurs simultaneously, along with the full 120\u02da rotation of the of \u03b3-subunit, and with hydrolysis of ATP in the \u03b1T\u03b2T and release of products (ADP and Pi) from \u03b1D\u03b2D HO (Extended Data Fig. 9d). One of the driving events for this structural transition is the conformational change from the ATP-bound \u03b1E\u03b2E to the more closed \u03b1T\u03b2T, which can be explained by a zipper motion of \u03b1E\u03b2E occurring upon ATP binding 26. Our structural analysis indicates that the ATP bound to \u03b1T\u03b2T is hydrolyzed as a result of the conformational change from \u03b1T\u03b2T to \u03b1D\u03b2D which occurs just after the 80\u02da rotation angle (81\u02da to 83\u02da) (Fig. 5). This subsequently leads to the conformational change of \u03b1T\u03b2T to \u03b1D\u03b2D HO that occurs during the further rotation to 120\u02da (Extended Data Fig. 9d). The conformational change from \u03b1T\u03b2T to \u03b1D\u03b2D HO is likely to occur spontaneously since it involves ATP hydrolysis, an exergonic reaction. The full 120\u02darotation of the \u03b3-subunit, coupled with spontaneous reactions occurring at both \u03b1E\u03b2E with ATP and \u03b1T\u03b2T with ATP, reduces the affinity for ADP and Pi at \u03b1D\u03b2D HO, resulting in the release of ADP during the first 80\u02da rotation step and Pi during the following 40\u02darotation step."

This difference may be due to the use of a mutant F1-ATPase (\u03b2/E190D) that significantly slows ATP hydrolysis at \u03b1D\u03b2D. As a result, only the 80\u02da structure with \u03b1D\u03b2D bound to ATP was identified in the previous study, which would have led to the conclusion that the 40\u02da step was driven by ATP hydrolysis. Taken together, our comprehensive study demonstrates that the FoF1 ATP synthase uses\nthe chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive the 80\u02da rotation of the \u03b3 subunit and this causes the internal molecular strain which drives the last 40\u02da rotation step, resulting in minimal heat dissipation of the chemical energy. As a result, the coupling of the chemomechanical cycle in F1 domain is achieved at almost 100 % efficiency, as previously demonstrated for F1-ATPase by single molecule observation experiments 2,18,19."

The expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain DK8 in which the endogenous ATP synthase was deleted. Transformed E. coli cells were cultured in 2xYT medium for 24 hours. Cultured cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 x g and suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10% [w/v] glycerol). The membrane fraction was resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% [w/v] glycerol, and 2% n-dodecyl-D-maltoside [DDM]), and then ultracentrifuged at 85,000xg. The enzyme in the supernatant was affinity purified using a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) column. For protein samples used under high ATP conditions, endogenous nucleotides were removed from \u0394\u03b5CT-FoF1 by dialysis with phosphate EDTA buffer containing 200 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA and 0.03% DDM at 25 \u02daC for 24 hours. Samples were concentrated to ~500 \u00b5l by an Amicon ultra (100 k cut ), and then subjected to gel permeation chromatography using a SuperoseTM 6 Increase column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.03 %DDM. Peak fractions containing FoF1 were collected and concentrated to ~300 \u03bcl using an Amicon ultra (100 k cut ) for grid preparation."

The reaction was initiated by adding 2 pmol of FoF1 to 2 ml of the reaction mixture. ATPase activity of FoF1 was measured by monitoring NADH oxidation over time by absorbance at 340 nm.\nCryoEM grid preparation\nHoley Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 Mo grids were used for high [ATP] conditions and UltraAuFoil R1.2 and 1.3 grid for low [ATP] conditions were used. Before using holly grids, they were treated to 1-minute glow discharge by the Ion Bombarder (Vacuum Device). For high [ATP] conditions, 3 \u00b5l of 200 mM ATP-Mg was added to 20 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M of enzyme solution, and then the solutions mixed well by pipetting. The mixtures containing 26 mM ATP and 9 \u00b5M enzyme were incubated for 20 sec at 23 \u02daC. Then, 3\u03bcL enzyme solution was loaded onto the grid and blotted for 6 sec with a blot force of 10, drain time of 0.5 sec, and 100% humidity using a FEI Vitrobot (ThermoFisher), followed by flash freezing by liquid ethane. For low [ATP] conditions, 2 \u03bcl of reaction buffer containing 0.2 M Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 250 \u03bcM ATP, 40 mM PEP, 1 M KCl, 5 mg/ml PK was added to 18 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM enzyme solution, and then mixed well by pipetting. The reaction mixtures containing enzyme were incubated at 23 \u02daC for 60 sec. Aliquots of 3\u03bcL of the reaction mixtures were loaded onto grids and immediately flash frozen as described above. The prepared cryo-grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until use."

The conversion of file formats between RELION and CryoSPARC was executed using csparc2star.py in pyem. For both high ATP (5922 movies) and low ATP (8200 movies) conditions, beam-induced drift was corrected using MotionCor231, and CTF estimation was performed using CTFFIND4.132. Particle picking was performed by Topaz33. In each dataset, good particles were sorted by 2D classification after template picking from hundreds of images, and 2000-6000 particles were used to train the Topaz model. 1,118,093 high [ATP] particles were and 2,654,860 low [ATP] particles were picked by Topaz and then these were subjected to 2D classification by CryoSPARC, which further selects particles of good quality. Heterogeneous refinement was used to further select\nparticles and classify into different rotation states. The total number of particles selected and classified was 241,668 at high [ATP] and 557,503 at low [ATP] conditions. All particles were combined and a focused 3D refinement was performed on the F1 domain. The F1 structures with different rotation angles were classified by 3D classification\nwithout alignment with masks for the F1 domain. Both CTF refinement and Bayesian\npolishing were carried out multiple times. Finally, we obtained structures with multiple rotational states at 2.6-4.2 \u00c5 resolution, estimated by the gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion (Extended Data Fig. 2c and 3c)."
