Effectiveness of Integrated Migraine Care Models: Investigate the outcomes of integrated care models that combine pharmacological treatments with tailored non-pharmacological interventions (such as psychological support, physical therapy, and lifestyle adjustments). This research could explore how such integrated approaches affect migraine frequency, intensity, disability, and overall quality of life compared to standard care.

Personalized Medicine in Migraine Management: Conduct studies to identify genetic, biochemical, or physiological markers that predict individual responses to specific migraine treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological. This research could lead to personalized treatment plans that are more effective and have fewer side effects for different subgroups of migraine sufferers.

Long-term Effects of Non-pharmacological Strategies: While the paper identifies the use of non-pharmacological strategies among migraine sufferers, there is a lack of comprehensive evidence on their long-term efficacy and safety. Future studies could focus on the long-term outcomes of these strategies, including their impact on migraine progression, and compare them to pharmacological treatments.

Technological Innovations in Migraine Management: Explore the potential of digital health technologies, such as mobile health apps, wearable devices, and telehealth, in supporting self-management of migraine. Research could assess how these technologies improve access to care, adherence to treatment plans, patient education, and overall management of migraine symptoms.

Barriers to Optimal Migraine Care: Despite the availability of various treatment options, the paper highlights that migraine remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Future research could focus on identifying and addressing barriers to effective migraine care, including healthcare provider knowledge gaps, patient access to specialty care, stigma, and the impact of healthcare policies on treatment accessibility and affordability.
