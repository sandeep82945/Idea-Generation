1. **Investigate the effect of different NP shapes on the assembly process and the resulting microgel-NP complexes.** The current study only considers spherical NPs. However, NPs of different shapes, such as rods, cubes, or platelets, may exhibit different interactions with microgels and lead to different assembly structures. This could be explored by performing simulations with different NP shapes and comparing the results to those obtained for spherical NPs.


2. **Study the effect of NP surface chemistry on the assembly process and the resulting microgel-NP complexes.** The current study assumes that NPs have a uniform negative charge. However, in practice, NPs can have a variety of surface chemistries, which can affect their interactions with microgels. This could be explored by performing simulations with NPs of different surface chemistries and comparing the results to those obtained for negatively charged NPs.


3. **Investigate the effect of microgel size on the assembly process and the resulting microgel-NP complexes.** The current study only considers microgels of a single size. However, microgels can be synthesized with a wide range of sizes. This could be explored by performing simulations with microgels of different sizes and comparing the results to those obtained for the microgel size considered in the current study.


4. **Study the effect of microgel crosslinking density on the assembly process and the resulting microgel-NP complexes.** The current study only considers microgels with a single crosslinking density. However, microgels can be synthesized with a wide range of crosslinking densities. This could be explored by performing simulations with microgels of different crosslinking densities and comparing the results to those obtained for the crosslinking density considered in the current study.


5. **Investigate the effect of temperature on the assembly process and the resulting microgel-NP complexes.** The current study only considers the assembly process at a single temperature. However, the assembly process may be affected by temperature. This could be explored by performing simulations at different temperatures and comparing the results to those obtained at the temperature considered in the current study.
