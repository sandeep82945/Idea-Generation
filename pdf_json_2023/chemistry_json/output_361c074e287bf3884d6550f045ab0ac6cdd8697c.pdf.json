The optical rotations were measured on a Jasco P2000-polarimeter. The HR-ESI-MS was measured on an Agilent 6530 Accurate Mass Q-TOF LC/MS. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer. The preparative HPLC were run on an Agilent-1100 system including quaternary pump, DAD detector, autosampler, and preparative HPLC column YMC J'sphere ODS-H80 (4 \u00b5m, 20 \u00d7 250 mm). Isocratic mobile phase with the flow rate of 3 mL/min was used in preHPLC. The compound was monitored at wavelengths of 205, 230, 254, and 280 nm. Flash column chromatography was run using silica gel, reversed phase C-18, and diaion HP-20 resins as stationary phase. Thin layer chromatography was carried out on pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 and RP-18 F254S plates. The spots were detected by spraying with aqueous solution of H2SO4 5% followed by heating with a heat gun. Nitric oxide assay\nThe RAW264.7 cells were received from Perugia University, Italy and were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. The cells were dispensed into a 96-well plate (2\u00d710 5 cells/well) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 and 95% air). After 24 h incubation, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM without FBS and continuously incubated for 3 h. The cells were treated with either compounds or vehicle solution and then stimulated with LPS (1 \u00b5g/mL) in the next 2 h. After an additional 24 h incubation, the cell culture medium (100 \u00b5L) was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) for 10 min and the absorbance was read at 540 nm. The amount of nitrite, an indicator of NO production in the medium, was obtained from a standard curve, which was constructed by NaNO2 serial dilution. N G - monomethyl-L-arginine acetate salt (L-NMMA) was used as a positive control. Cell viability was determined by adding 10 \u00b5L MTT solution (5 mg/mL) and incubating for 4 h. Formazan crystals were dissolved in 50 \u00b5L of DMSO. Absorbance was read at 540 nm and compared with the vehicle group. Experiments were performed in triplicate and data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software.

Nat Prod Res. 35(13):2157-2163.\nAcid hydrolysis and confirmation of monosaccharide\nCompound 1 (8.0 mg) was separately dissolved in 1.0 M HCl (dioxaneH2O, 1:1, v/v, 1.0 mL) and heated to 80 \u00b0C in a water bath for 3 h. The acidic solution was dried under N2 overnight. After extraction with CHCl3, the aqueous layer was dried using N2 to give aqueous residue. This aqueous residue was separated by silica gel CC eluting with CH2Cl2\u2013EtOH (10:1, v/v) and then further fractionated by RP-18 CC using a solvent gradient of EtOH\u2013H2O (6:4, 7:3, and 8:2, v/v) to give the saccharide. The specific rotations (   25\nD  ) of sugars were determined after dissolving\nin H2O for 24h and compared to the literature (lit): D-glucose (1.5 mg): found +49.0 (c 0.1, H2O), lit +48.0 (Abe et al. 1999); D-galactose (0.9 mg): found +46.5 (c 0.1, H2O), lit 45.0 (Voutquenne-Nazabadioko et al. 2013).
