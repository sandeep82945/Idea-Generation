    "abstractText": "The aim of this research was to modify gelatin (GT) with 2-octenyl succinic anhydride (OA) and gallic acid (GA) and investigate its functionalities. GT modified with OA (GT-OA) has an improved water solubility at room temperature and an enhanced surface activity, foaming capacity, and pH buffering ability. Regarding antioxidant activity, GT-OA grafted with GA to generate the compound GT-OA-GA has shown good antioxidant activity. Particularly, GT-OA-GA surpassed GA in ferrous ion (Fe2+)-chelating activity. With respect to antimicrobial activity, GT-OA-GA could be complexed with zinc ions (Zn2+), and this complex exhibited good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (O157:H7). Chemically modified GT has better water solubility at room temperature and more functionalities than unmodified GT. Thus, it can be used as an emulsifier or coating material in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries pertaining to GT applications.",

            "text": "Gelatin (GT) is a protein produced from collagen-containing tissues via an acid (type A) or alkaline (type B) pretreatment and a subsequent extraction. It is one of the most versatile biopolymers and it is widely used in food, confectionery, pharmaceutical, medical, cosmetic, and technical products [1]. Because it contains more hydrophilic amino acids than hydrophobic residues, GT is essentially hydrophilic, which limits its surface activity [2]. In addition, the poor water solubility of GT at room temperature often causes problems for its application in many food and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes [3]. Modifying the chemical structure of GT can improve its defects or enhance its functionalities. Regarding the hydrophobicity and surface activity enhancement of GT, Shilpi et al. [4] conjugated GT to stearic acid activated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to increase the loading efficiency of a drug with poor aqueous solubility. Using a similar activation method, Nguyen et al. [5] synthesized a GT-oleic acid conjugate, which could form self-assembled nanoparticles. The conjugate has a hydrophobic inner core for loading water-insoluble drugs and a GT layer for biocompatibility and circulation extension. The role of hydrophobic molecules in an amphiphilic polymer is important for preparing nanoparticles because it may affect the particle size, drug loading efficiency, and stability. Succinylation is another frequently used method for protein modification. Commercial bovine GT can be modified by using succinic anhydride, which changes the physicochemical properties of GT, such as foaming and bloom strength [6]. Octenyl succinic anhydride (OA) has been used to modify bovine bone GT (type B) and fish skin GT, thus increasing the\nFoods 2022, 11, 1241. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11091241 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2022, 11, 1241 2 of 12\ndroplet stability, phase transition time, and creaming index of fish oil-loaded emulsions [7]. Porcine skin GT (type A) conjugated to 2-octenyl succinic anhydride; however, this has not been studied. Protein-conjugated polyphenols have been widely reported [8]. Regarding the conjugation of GT with polyphenols, GT has been modified with epigallocatechin gallate for medical applications [9]. In addition, polyphenols from plant extracts were used to cross-link GT molecules to enhance their gel strength [10]. A GT-gallic acid conjugate has been fabricated to evaluate its applicability in biomedicine and pharmacy [11]. Cuttlefish skin GT modified with caffeic acid, ferulic acid, or tannic acid was also investigated. In the study, the antioxidant activity of the modified GT increased, but the surface hydrophobicity decreased [12]. The aim of this research was to conjugate GT (type A) with 2-octenyl succinic anhydride and GA to improve the solubility of GT at room temperature and increase its functionalities, such as emulsifying, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities."

            "text": "GT was conjugated to OA to form GT-OA via octenyl succinylation, by which OA reacts mainly with the \u03b5-amino group of lysine and slightly with the N-terminal amino acids in the protein. Thus, the positively charged residues of the protein were changed to negatively charged residues via N-acylation [7]. The amino group substitution (%) was used to evaluate the efficiency of the conjugation because the amino groups of GT are the major reactive sites. The effects of the reactants at different ratios for the synthesis of GT-OA are listed in Table 1. The amount of GT remained constant in the experiment, while the OA concentration was varied (Table 1). To determine if the reaction process would affect the properties of GT, we allowed the GT to go through the same process in the absence of OA. Then, the amino group substitution was determined based on the treated GT rather than the original GT. When the ratio of OA to GT increased, the amino group substitution also increased. This meant that more OA was grafted onto GT. The amino group substitution increased by approximately 5\u20137% for each additional amount of OA that was used. Although the amino group substitution of GT-OA increased, the product yield decreased. For example, when the amino group substitution increased from 70.88% (GT-OA-1) to 80.10% (GT-OA-3), the yield was reduced from 65.02% (GT-OA-1) to 40.89% (GT-OA-3). Comparatively, the increase in the amino group substitution was much less than the yield loss of the synthesized product. The reason is likely that the reactive sites of the GT gradually decreased during the reaction period, which reduced the collision probability between the sites and reactants. Moreover, the grafted OA might interact with the other OA molecules via hydrophobic attraction to deter their approach to the residual reactive GT sites. Thus, the unreacted OA molecules were hydrolyzed in the aqueous solution [20] and removed in the later dialytic process. Considering the amino group substitution and yield, GT-OA-2 was used for conjugation with GA.\nTable 1.

            "text": "3.3.1. Surface Activity, Zeta Potential, and Viscosity\nThe presence of OA in the GT structure influenced the physicochemical properties of GT. Regarding surface activity, the incorporation of OA into GT could increase the surface activity of GT. The more OA that was used, the higher the surface activity of GT-OA became,\nFoods 2022, 11, 1241 7 of 12\nas shown from the surface tension reduction in Table 1. However, the degree of surface tension reduction was not proportional to the amount of OA added. Although the carbon chain of OA could increase the hydrophobicity of GT-OA, the carboxylate group of OA also provided some hydrophilicity, which may have somewhat offset the lipophilic effect of OA. When OA is conjugated onto GT, one carboxyl group of OA reacts with the amino group of GT to form a covalent bond, while the other carboxylate group remains free, resulting in a negative charge in the aqueous solution (Figure 1). Before succinylation, the zeta potential of GT was positive, but after the addition of OA in the reaction, the zeta potential became negative. The zeta potential value increased with the increase of OA in the reaction. Moreover, the zeta potential might affect the viscosity of GT-OA. For example, GT is a gel forming molecule; thus, the greater the interactive forces among the protein molecules, the higher the viscosity of the solution. The results in Table 1 show that GT had the highest viscosity, and the viscosity of GT-OA decreased as the amount of OA increased. The reason for this may be ascribed to the increase in the zeta potential, which represents an increase in the negative charge. The negative charges among the GT-OA molecules generate repulsive forces that might weaken the protein-protein interactions and thereby reduce the viscosity [21].\n3.3.2. Foaming Properties\nThe results showed that the foaming capacity of GT-OA was better than that of GT (Figure 2). This indicated that OA could enhance the foaming capacity of GT after conjugation. High hydrophobicity and viscosity have been reported to favor protein foaming capacity [22]. The carbon chain of OA provided the hydrophobicity for GT-OA. Thus, the more OA that was conjugated onto GT, such as in GT-OA-1 and GT-OA-2, the higher the foaming capacity of the GT-OA conjugate became. However, the foaming capacity seemed to level off when OA was further increased in the conjugates, such as in GT-OA-3, GT-OA-4, and GT-OA-5. Viscosity did not play an important role in this experiment because the foaming capacity did not decrease despite the decreased viscosity of GT-OA compared with GT. It is possible that the differences in viscosity between the GT and GT-OA conjugates in this experiment were not large enough to cause a significant effect as compared to the increased hydrophobicity effect of OA on the foaming capacity. More importantly, the surface activity may be a more critical factor in determining the foaming capacity. GT-OA conjugates have a greater surface activity than that of GT. The reduction of the surface tension between the air and water phases facilitates foam formation by removing the energy barrier. Lawal [23] reported that a progressive increase in the level of succinylation of Lablab bean protein concentrates with succinic anhydride increased the foam capacity. The authors suggested that acylation could cause protein unfolding and increase protein-water interactions. In addition, the increased net negative charge of succinylated proteins could promote protein-water interactions and thus improve foaming capacity. Regarding foaming stability, flocculation is a precursor to the destabilization of bubbles. Flocculation brings about the deformation of colliding bubbles. The deformed bubbles are then separately surrounded by a thin liquid film. The intersection of three such films can form a channel called a plateau border. Liquid drains from the thin film to the plateau border causing bubble instability. One of the driving forces for liquid drainage is called plateau border suction, which is equal to the ratio of the surface tension to the curvature radius of the plateau border. Therefore, reducing the surface tension can decrease the drainage force. Emulsifiers and proteins stabilize foams by reducing the surface tension, thereby lowering the rate of thin film drainage [24]. The foaming stability of GT and all GT-OA conjugates appeared very stable during the experimental period (Figure 3). The higher surface-tension-reducing ability might be a booster for the foaming stability of the GT-OA conjugates. In contrast, the higher viscosity might be an important contributor for the foaming stability of GT.\nFoods 2022, 11, 1241 8 of 12\nFoods 2022, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12\nthe drainage force.

Because GT-OA carries more carboxylic groups derived from the structure of OA, they are negatively charged at neutral or alkaline conditions. Consequently, protonation of the GT-OA conjugates was performed by titrating the solution of the conjugates with HCl. The amounts of HCl used were recorded and plotted with the pH (Figure 3). The more titrant that was used to reach the same pH, the higher the buffering capacity was of the compound. As shown in Figure 3, the more OA that was conjugated to GT, the larger the volume of HCl that was required to reach the same pH value. OA provides the carboxyl group that can be protonated; thus, GT grafted with more OA exhibited a greater pH buffering capacity.\nFoods 2022, 11, 1241 9 of 12"

            "text": "3.4.1. DPPH Radical Scavenging Activity\nThe DPPH assay is frequently used in the evaluation of radical scavengers due to its simple and rapid manual analysis. DPPH is a stable free radical with a purple color, and it can be reduced upon acceptance of a hydrogen atom or electron from an antioxidant, which causes it to become decolorized to a yellow compound [25]. GT or GT-OA did not show any scavenging effect on DPPH, but GT-OA with GA conjugates all showed antioxidant activity. This indicates that the antioxidant activity of GT-OA-GA conjugates mainly came from GA because GA alone exhibited excellent antioxidant activity. In addition, GT-OA-GA-Zn had a lower DPPH scavenging activity than GT-OA-GA. The reason for this might be that a part of the GA OH groups was used to form a complex with zinc ions (Zn2+), which affected its electron-transferring activity.\n3.4.2. Ferrous Ion Chelating Activity\nThe ferrous ion (Fe2+) is an important initiator for oxidation. Namely, Fe2+ can produce a hydroxyl radical, which is the most reactive species of oxygen, via the Fenton reaction. The half-life of the hydroxyl radical in biological systems is about 1 ns, and it can rapidly react with organic molecules with rate constants of 109\u20131010 M\u22121 s \u22121 [26]. Therefore, the Fe2+-chelating activity of the GT conjugates was tested. As shown in Table 2, GT, GA, and GT-OA did not display Fe2+-chelating activity in the tested concentration range. However, when GA was grafted onto GT-OA, GT-OA-GA showed marked chelating activity as compared with the individual compounds. The OH group of GA may play an important role in this chelating effect. Similarly, GA did not show Fe2+-chelating activity in previous reports [16,27]. However, when GA was conjugated to chitosan, the chelating activity of this conjugated compound was markedly elevated [16]. Chelation generally requires unpaired electrons to attract positive metal ions, and some atoms, such as oxygen and nitrogen, can provide these electrons. Therefore, the location and orientation of these atoms in the molecular structure might determine the chelating effect. In this case, even though OA has a free carboxyl group, its location and orientation might not favor this effect on GT-OA. Nevertheless, favorable chelating conditions might be created with the involvement of the OH groups of GA in the nearby structure after conjugation. When GT-OA-GA was complexed with Zn2+, its chelating activity was slightly influenced (Table 2). It is reasonable to infer that part of the chelating site of GT-OA-GA was occupied by Zn2+ ions, which resulted in the decrease.\n1: ascorbic acid or gallic acid equivalent of GT-OA-GA and GT-OA-GA-Zn at 5 mg/mL; 2: the values in the same column with different letters are significantly different at p < 0.05.\nFoods 2022, 11, 1241 10 of 12\n3.4.3.

The ferric ion reducing ability, expressed as an ascorbic acid or GA equivalent, was not significantly different between GT-OA-GA and GT-OA-GA-Zn, which differed slightly from the result of the DPPH assay. The reason for this might be that the sample amounts used for the ferric ion reducing assay were much higher (approximately twice as much) than those used for the DPPH assay. Thus, the influence of the increasing effect of GA might be higher than that of Zn2+ because GA displayed a stronger reducing ability than ascorbic acid, which is a good reducing compound (Table 2)."

Complexation of GT Conjugates with the Zinc Ion and Antimicrobial Activity of the Complexes\nGT-OA was added to a series of Zn(NO3)2 concentrations (16.8\u201333.6 mM) to form a complex. hen the Zn(NO3)2 concentration reached 23.5 mM, the solution became slightly turbid with a colloidal suspension. The turbidity of the solution gradually increased as the Zn(NO3)2 concentration increased. The solution formed heavy precipitates at the highest concentration (Figure 4). This indicates that GT-OA and Zn2+ interact mainly via electric attraction. Therefore, the 20.2 mM Zn(NO3)2 concentration, which was the highest concentration remaining in a clear solution, was sed for the complexation of the GT conjugates for subsequent antimicrobial activity assays in this experiment.\nFig re 4. earances of - ixed ith Zn( O3)2 sol tion at a series of concentrations ( ): (A) 16.8, (B) 20.2, (C) 23.5, (D) 26.9, (E) 30.3, (F) 33.6.\nThe results in Table 3 show that the GT conjugates without Zn2+ did not have antimicrobial activity. This means that Zn2+ is the key component that confers antimicrobial activity to the GT conjugates. The amount of Zn(NO3)2 in the complex of the GT conjugates was estimated to be approximately 3.68%, assuming no significant loss occurred during the experimental process. As a result, the MBC of GT-OA-Zn for S. aureus was 5000 \u00b5g/mL and contained Zn(NO3)2 at a concentration of about 184 \u00b5g/mL, which was higher than the MBC of Zn(NO3)2 (75 \u00b5g/mL). The reason for this is probably that a large portion of the Zn2+ ions are temporally adsorbed in the molecular structure of the GT conjugates so that they are not released during the change in chemical equilibrium. However, the Zn2+ ions that are retained in the GT conjugates might undergo a controlled release by the dynamic change of chemical equilibrium in different conditions.\nFoods 2022, 11, 1241 11 of 12"

            "text": "GT conjugated to OA can improve its water solubility at room temperature and enhance its surface activity. The presence of OA in the GT structure affects the zeta potential, viscosity, foaming property, and buffering capacity of GT-OA. With additional grafting of GA onto GT-OA, this conjugate can be imparted with antioxidant abilities. In particular, the Fe2+ chelating ability, which pure GA lacks, is generated via this conjugation. GT-OA-GA can be further complexed with Zn2+ and rendered antimicrobial activity. This study provides useful information about optional ways of modifying GT to fit various purposes of application. For example, the modified GT with surface activity and antioxidant activity can be used in oil-in-water emulsions as an emulsifier to stabilize oxidatively labile compounds or as a coating material to encapsulate functional ingredients in food, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical industries pertaining to GT applications.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.-T.L. and T.-S.Y.; Data curation, X.-Y.Z.; Formal analysis, X.-Y.Z. and T.-T.L.; Funding acquisition, T.-T.L.; Investigation, T.-T.L.; Methodology, T.-T.L. and T.-S.Y.; Project administration, T.-T.L. and T.-S.Y.; Resources, T.-T.L. and T.-S.Y.; Writing\u2014original draft, T.-T.L. and X.-Y.Z.; Writing\u2014review & editing, T.-S.Y.
