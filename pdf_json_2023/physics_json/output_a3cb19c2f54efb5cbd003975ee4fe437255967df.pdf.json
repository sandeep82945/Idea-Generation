            "text": "The following principles were used when N-benzylbispidinol amides 1a\u2014j were designed: 1) the carbonyl group at position 9 of the bicycle was replaced with a hydroxyl group to prevent covalent binding with the enzyme; 2) the N-benzyl substituent at one nitrogen atom was present in all compounds since N,N\u00b4-dibenzylbispidine was one of the most active compounds in the series of symmetric derivatives; 11 3) substituents in the amide fragment at the second nitrogen atom were varied. It should be noted that the choice of the latter substituents was based both on the previous experimental data and on the new data of computer modelling.\nSynthesis of target compounds. Formyl derivative 1a was obtained in 64% yield by benzylation of 5,7-dimethyl-1,3-diazaadamantan-6-one and subsequent opening of the diazaadamantane cycle in the presence of KOH (5 equiv.), which was accompanied by the ketone group reduction (Scheme 1).12\nAmides 1b\u2014h were obtained in yields from 58 to 86% by acylation of N-benzyl-1,5-dimethylbispidin-9-ol (2) with equimolar amounts of corresponding acyl chlorides 3 in acetonitrile in the presence of triethylamine as a base at room temperature (Scheme 2).\nScheme 2\nCompound 1 Yield (%) Compound 1 Yield (%) b 58 f 86 c 69 g 76 d 66 h 80 e 80\nAmides 1i and 1j were prepared in the 50 and 54% yields by acylation of N-benzyl-1,5-dimethylbispid-\nR = H (a), Me (b), Ph (c), (d), (e),\n(f), (g), (h),\n(i), (j)\nScheme 1\nReagents and conditions: i.

Currently, a large number of chemical compounds have been found that can inhibit the activity of the main protease of SARSCoV-2 due to non-covalent interactions with the amino acids of the active center of the enzyme.13\u201417 The search for non-covalent inhibitors based on the bispidine platform signifi cantly expands the knowledge about their possible antiviral eff ect. Because the replacement of the carbonyl group at position 9 of the bicycle with a hydroxyl group was performed in order to prevent covalent binding to the enzyme, our eff orts were directed to modeling the possible noncovalent interactions of new derivatives with the active site of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Both the estimated energy of interactions in the ligand\u2014receptor complex and the formation of noncovalent bonds between the atoms of the new derivatives and the catalytic amino acid residue Cys145, as well as the amino acid residue His41 involved in the catalytic process were taken into account.\nAs a result of the evaluation of the molecular docking, the minimum binding energy values (E) shown in Fig. 1 were obtained.\nOn the whole, compounds 1a\u2014j exhibit higher binding energy (lower affi nity) with the active center of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the ML188 inhibitor. According to the data of the authors of the X-ray diff raction model of the noncovalent interactions between the ML188 inhibitor\nand the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, the inhibitory activity is associated with the stabilization of the fl exible loop structures of the main protease active site in the 141\u2014145 chain region and with the noncovalent interactions with the amino acid residues Cys145 and His41, which perform the catalytic function of the enzyme.16 A branched molecular structure of the ML188 inhibitor readily occupies pockets of the active center of the main protease, realizing a series of non-covalent interactions with amino acids in the 141\u2014145 chain region due to the acceptor oxygen atoms of its furan ring and due to its amide group, as well as due to the \u03c0-system of its pyridine ring. The catalytically active amino acid residue Cys145 binds to the \u03c0-system of the furan cycle of the inhibitor through non-covalent interactions with the cysteine sulfur atom. The stacking interaction between the phenyl ring of the inhibitor and the His41 imidazole ring provides additional stabilization of the inhibitor in the active site, preventing the catalytic function of the enzyme. Further stabilization of the ML188 conformation in the active center of the main protease is provided by the interactions with Met49, His163, and Glu166 (Fig. 2, a).\nAmong the new bispidine derivatives, a group of compounds (1e\u2014g) stands out. They have uniform arrangement in the active site of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2, b, c, e, f). Their bulky hydrophobic bispidine framework is located in the space occupied by the tert-butylamino group of the ML188 inhibitor, while their unsymmetrical side substituents\nare located in the regions of the active site, where the ML188 pyridine ring and its tert-butylphenyl group are located. This arrangement of these derivatives makes it possible to mimic three of four pharmacophoric groups of ML188. Apparently, this conformation of the bispidine derivatives is best suited for the occupation of a majority of pockets of the active site.\nIt is interesting to note that compound 1h (Fig. 2, d) having a slightly bulkier side substituent than compound 1g because of the presence of the intermediate six-membered ring is unable to occupy the same position in the active site of the main protease, which results in the displacement of its bispidine framework towards the center of the active site. Conformations of compounds 1e and 1f diff er minimally, as well as their estimated binding energies.\nThe majority of the new bispidine derivatives (1b,c,f\u2014j) are capable of stacking interactions with the aromatic system of the amino acid residue His41 due to the \u03c0-system of one of side substituents. The strong non-covalent interaction with the Cys145 amino acid residue is characteristic of compounds 1c and 1e only; in this case, the sulfur atom of the SH group of Cys145 interacts with the \u03c0-systems of side substituents of these derivatives. Lake in the case of the ML188 inhibitor, additional stabilizing hydrogen bonds are formed by compounds 1a\u2014c,e,g,i with the Glu166 amino acid residue. Possibly, compounds 1d and 1h can interact with amino acid residues of the 141\u2014145 chain region due to the correspondence of their molecular structures to this region, which, however, distances them from the amino acid residue Glu166. A specifi c feature of bispidine derivatives, which diff ers them from the ML188 inhibitor, consists in their interactions with amino acid residues Gln189 and Cys44.\nBiological testing. In order to verify the predicted biological activity, all compounds 1a\u2014j were tested for the ability to inhibit the main viral protease 3CLpro using a method previously developed by us.11 The method consists in the measure of the fl uorescence level of a peptide substrate interacting with the sensitive 3CLpro fragment. The 3CLpro activity was determined using the fluorogenic substrate DabcylKTSAVLQ\u2193SGFRKME(Edans)NH2. This substrate contains two fl uorescent dyes selected in such a way as to realize the eff ect of the F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The substrate hydrolysis results in the disappearance of the conditions required for FRET to occur, leading to an increase in the fl uorescence intensity. The addition of potential inhibitor s into the enzyme\u2014substrate system makes it possible to evaluate the inhibitory activity on the basis of the change in the fl uorescence increase rate. The IC50 value corresponds to the test compound concentration that reduces the fl uorescence level by 50% of the value observed without an\ninhibitor. As reference compounds, we used wellknown protease inhibitors \u041cL188 and disulfi ram,18 the semi-inhibitory concentrations IC50 of which are 1.56\u00b10.55 and 6.25\u00b11.97 mol L\u20131, respectively.\nAll tested compounds, except for compound 1g containing 1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazole fragment, exhibited no activity. In the case of compound 1g, the IC50 concentration was 100\u00b15.7 mol L \u20131. It should be noted for comparison that symmetrically N,N\u00b4-disubstituted 1,5-dimethylbispidin-9-one containing two fragments of 1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazole, which, according to computer docking, covalently binds to the Cys145 amino acid residue of the main protease 3CLpro, has an IC50 concentration of 13.0\u00b12.1 mol L \u20131.11 It is noteworthy that for compound 1g, which showed moderate activity against the main protease, the calculated binding energy was the highest among all considered bispidine derivatives.\nIn modern medicinal chemistry, publications on inactive compounds or compounds with low activity are controversial and may be considered not important,19 while the compounds themselves may be regarded as irrelevant. However, data on these compounds are important for the development of computer-aided drug design methods,20 which make it possible to build, optimize, and evaluate new chemical objects.\nThus, in this work, a series of non-symmetric amides of N-benzylbispidin-9-ol (eight of which have not been reported before) were synthesized, their molecular modelling was carried out, and their inhibitory activity against the main protease 3CLpro of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was studied. It is found that N-benzyl-N\u00b4-acylbispidin-9-ols exhibit no pronounced inhibitory activity in contrast to symmetric N,N\u00b4-disubstituted bispidinones. Nonetheless, it is shown that compound 1g may be promising for subsequent modifi cations to obtain compounds with high inhibitory activity.\nExperimental\nNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer (operating frequencies are 400 MHz for 1\u041d and 101 MHz for 13\u0421) at 298 \u041a using SiMe4 as an internal standard. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) using electrospray ionization (ESI) were recorded on a Bruker MicrOTOF II spectrometer. The course of reactions and the purity of the synthesized compounds were monitored\nby TLC on the Merck TLC Silica gel 60G F254 plates. All used reagents and solvents (of 90.0\u201499.9% purity) were those commercially available (Sigma-Aldrich, ABCR, Acros Organics). If necessary, they were further purifi ed to analytical purity by standard procedures immediately before use. Parent N-benzyl-1,5-dimethylbispidin-9-ol 2 and compound 1a were prepared by known methods.12 Acyl chlorides RC(O)Cl 3 (R = Me, Ph, C4H3S) were obtained from commercial sources, hydrochlorides of isonicotinoyl21 and nicotinoyl22 chlorides were synthesized using the corresponding methods, other acyl chlorides were prepared by the method reported previously.11\nSynthesis of compounds 1b\u2014h (general procedure). Corresponding acyl chloride 3 (1.9 mmol) and triethylamine (0.19 g, 0.27 mL, 1.9 mmol) were added to a suspension of N-benzyl-1,5-dimethylbispidin-9-ol (2) (0.495 g, 1.9 mmol) in dry acetonitrile (20 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 h. The course of the reaction was monitored by TLC (using a CHCl3\u2014 MeOH (5\u00a0:\u00a01) mixture as an eluent). After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into ice water (50 mL), the formed precipitate was fi ltered off and dried under reduced pressure in a vacuum desiccator over P2O5 to a constant sample weight.\n1-(7-Benzyl-9-hydroxy-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diaza bicyclo [3.3.1]nonan-3-yl)ethan-1-one (1b).

Molecular modeling was carried out in the Schrodinger Maestro visualization environment using applications from the Schr\u00f6dinger Small Molecule Drug Discovery Suite 2016-1 program package (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, 2016). The 3D structures of the derivatives were obtained empirically in the LigPrep application using the OPLS3 force fi eld.23 All possible tautomeric forms of compounds and various states of polar protons of molecules at pH 7.0\u00b12.0 were taken into account. The X-ray diff raction model of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID 7L0D) was used in the calculations.16 Modeling of the possible mechanism of noncovalent inhibition of the main protease was performed by molecular docking of compounds to the binding site of the ML188 inhibitor using the Glide application.24 The search area for the scoring function was selected automatically based on the size and physicochemical properties of the ML188 inhibitor. The XP (Extra Precision) algorithm of increased docking accuracy was used. Docking was performed using the score in place mode, i.e., in comparison with the calculation of the scoring function for the ML188 inhibitor in the coordinates of the X-ray diff raction model. Non-covalent interactions of compounds at the binding site were visualized using the Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer program (v.17.2, San Diego: Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, 2016).\nMeasurement of inhibitory activity against the viral protease. The 3CLpro activity was measured using the fl uorogenic substrate Dabcyl KTSAVLQ\u2193SGFRKME(Edans) NH2 on a CLARIOstar Plus microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany) with the use of wavelengths of 355 and 460 nm for excitation and detection, respectively. The reaction mixtures were prepared in a 384-well plate, incubated for 30 min; the measurements were carried out at 30 \u0421. Each well contained one reaction mixture consisting of Tris HCl buff er (pH 7.3, 20 mmol of tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane), NaCl (100 mmol), EDTA (1 mmol), DTT (dithiotreitol, 1 mmol)), substrate (10 mol), an inhibitor (400 mol), and 3\u0421Lpro (3\u202210\u20137 mol). The instrument was calibrated using a peptide solution subjected to complete hydrolysis. The fl uorescence value of this mixture was taken as 80%. The measurements were carried out in the kinetic scan mode (50 cycle of 10 s). All experiments were repeated three times (n = 3). Calculations\nwere performed using the accompanying MARS Data Analysis software (BMG LABTECH, Germany). The IC50 value corresponded to the test compound concentration that reduced the fl uorescence level by 50% of the value observed without an inhibitor.\nThis work was performed under fi nancial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Project No. 20-04-60215). Biological testing was carried out under fi nancial support of Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Agreement No. 075-15-2021-1355 dated 12.10.2021) as part of the implementation of certain activities of the Federal Scientifi c and Technical Program for the Development of Synchrotron and Neutron Research and Research Infrastructure for 2019\u20142027.\nThe authors express their gratitude to the Information and Computing Center of Novosibirsk State University for the provided computing resources.\nNo human or animal subjects were used in this research.\nThe authors declare no competing interests."
