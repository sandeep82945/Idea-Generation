Additionally, understanding of the structure\u2013performance relationship is lacking, which hinders the production of elaborate designs for electrocatalysts with greater efficiency.

Despite signicant efforts in this area, it remains a substantial challenge to achieve precise control over the nanoarchitectures within the templates to create 3DOP materials, especially for those beyond the well-studied silica-, carbon- and metal\u2013organic framework (MOF)-based materials.30\u201333\nThe main challenge for the nanospace-conned synthesis of 3DOP metal oxides lies in how to introduce metal precursors into the conned spaces and suppress the migration of metal species out of the conned spaces during the reaction processes. The notorious migration of metal species leads to uctuations in the pore ordering and the overall morphologies, and even results in nonporous products.13,31,34,35 Therefore, irregular porous metal oxides with particle sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to several micrometers have been created by different researchers.13,31 It is crucial to develop a comprehensive understanding and precise control over the growth mechanism of metal oxides inside conned template spaces. By achieving simultaneous regulation of overall morphologies and structural ordering, we can anticipate signicant advancements and superior applications of porous metal oxides.\nTo actualize this concept into practice, we proposed the synthesis of 3DOP Cu2O crystals using a hard-templating strategy. The synthesis of Cu2O is a multistep reaction involving different reagents and, therefore, conferring its conned growth inside hard templates requires several cycles of inltration reaction procedures.36,37 The processes that fulll the voids of hard templates with reagents and prevent their leaching during the subsequent wet chemical reaction processes are crucial for preparing ordered porous Cu2O crystals with satisfactory repeatability.\nIn this work, we developed a molecular fence-assisted hardtemplating strategy, in which Cu2+ ions are converted to [Cu(NH3)n]\n2+ complexes for the synthesis of 3DOP Cu2O crystals (Scheme 1). The loose and less soluble [Cu(NH3)n]\n2+ (Fig. S1\u2020) allowed reagents to inltrate into the inner region of the wellpatterned polystyrene (PS) monolith by capillary effect. Once the aqueous reagents entered the voids of the PS monoliths, the pre-adsorbed Cu2+ ions were dissolved and reacted to form Cu(OH)2, thereby inhibiting the migration of Cu\n2+ ions to the outside of the template. Taking advantage of the capsulating effect of the molecular fence and the shaping effect of the assembled PS template, 3DOP Cu2O cuboctahedra (abbreviated as 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO) were successfully synthesized. The spatial connement effect of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO was claried in the electrocatalyzing CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), with FEs for\n13852 | Chem.

More impressively, 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO provides a maximum partial current density of C2+ products up to \u22120.89 A cm\u22122 at an applied current density of \u22121.2 A cm\u22122 in a ow cell."

As the essence of this approach, ammonia vapor was utilized to stabilize Cu2+ and prevent its dissolution from the template. In the synthetic procedure, the 3D-ordered PS template pre-adsorbed with Cu2+ (denoted as PS@Cu2+) was treated in an airtight container saturated with ammonia vapor. During this process, the color of the PS cake changed from light yellow to bright cyan (Fig. S2\u2020), indicating that Cu2+ was converted to other forms. The cyan color began to form at the outmost layer and then gradually expanded from the exterior to the interior of the PS@Cu2+ monoliths, depending on the treatment time (Fig. S3\u2020). To reveal the exact change, the products formed at this stage were collected and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry.\nThe XRD results revealed that aer ammonia treatment, the cyan-colored complex is a mixture of [Cu(NH3)2]\n2+ and [Cu(NH3)4]\n2+ complexes (Fig. S4\u2020). For simplicity, we denote the copper\u2013ammonia complex formed aer ammonia treatment as [Cu(NH3)n]\n2+. Distinctly different from the FTIR prole of the CuCl2 precursor, several new peaks appeared in the FTIR spectra for the sample aer ammonia vapor treatment. Typically, the sharp maximum peaks at approximately 3350 cm\u22121 and 3130 cm\u22121 were ascribed to the N\u2013H stretching vibrations of NH3. Additionally, the antisymmetric bending fundamental mode of NH4\n+ occurred as an intense absorption at approximately 1406 cm\u22121, and the NH3 wagging of NH3 in [Cu(NH3)n] 2+ appeared at approximately 1254 cm\u22121 (Fig. S5\u2020).38,39 Based on the above results and the inuence of synthetic conditions on the complexation of Cu, the [Cu(NH3)n]\n2+ compound was formed under exposure to ammonia vapor.

The XRD diffraction patterns were consistent with the standard patterns of Cu2O nanocrystals (JCPDS no. 05-0667) (Fig. S7\u2020), demonstrating the formation of Cu2O in the synthesis. No other diffraction peaks were observed, excluding the formation of undesired impurities. The results showed that the [Cu(NH3)n]\n2+ compound formed during the ammonia treatment only serves as a unidirectional encapsulating agent without inuencing the formation of Cu2O.40\nLow-magnication scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that cuboctahedra with uniform and wellpatterned pores were obtained (Fig. 1a). Although the crystal size slightly deviated, there are sharp edges on the cuboctahedra, and a dominant edge length of 1.5 mm was conrmed by statistical analysis (Fig. S8a\u2020). As is known, a cuboctahedron possesses eight triangular facets and six square facets. To more closely examine the pore organization inside the polyhedron, individual particles projected in the directions of the [110] and [100] zone axes were selected and characterized by SEM, transition electron microscopy (TEM), and high-angle annular darkeld scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADFSTEM) (Fig. 1e\u2013g and i\u2013k). The corresponding schematic models are also displayed for comparison (Fig. 1d and h).\nAll the results indicate that ordered macropores (approximately 215 nm) interconnected by mesopore channels with an\nFig. 1 Morphological characterization of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO.

Thus, the resultant porous Cu2O cuboctahedra were characterized by the closepacked order of monodisperse PS templates without any decrease in ordering (Fig. S10\u2020). Thus, the aforementioned results indicated that the 3DOP Cu2O cuboctahedra were successfully synthesized. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of one individual 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO crystal demonstrated its polycrystalline nature by showing diffraction rings (Fig. S11\u2020). This was consistent with the small grain size (23.6 nm) of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013 CO, as calculated by the Scherrer equation based on the most intense (111) diffraction peak (Table S1\u2020).\nThe surface structure around the nanopores of the 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO was further investigated using aberration-corrected atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM (Fig. S12\u2020). The lattice fringes with distances of 0.21 nm and 0.25 nm were attributed to the (200) and (111) planes of Cu2O (Fig. S12a\u2020). The magnied HAADF-STEM image illustrated in Fig. 1c shows that the concave surface possesses a large number of atomic defect sites, which usually enable the adsorption of intermediates in electrocatalysis.41,42 The HAADF-STEM and corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 1l) show the uniform distribution of Cu and O over the entire particle, and the Cu/O atomic ratio was determined to be 2/1 (Fig. S13\u2020). All these results consistently demonstrate the formation of high-quality ordered porous Cu2O cuboctahedra without impurities.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study presents the rst synthesis of 3DOP Cu2O cuboctahedra. Elucidating the mechanism behind the simultaneous regulation of porous structure and morphology holds paramount signicance in the development of a diverse range of innovative porous materials. Considering the synthetic conditions in the present study, the surfactant (polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)) and assembled PS template may be the two factors responsible for morphology control. Therefore, we conducted control experiments to reveal the reasons for the formation of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO. Although PVP is effective in regulating the geometry of Cu2O in wet-chemical synthesis,36,37 irregularly shaped products were obtained under the same synthetic procedure to synthesize 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO using PVP as an additive but without the PS template (Fig. S14\u2020).\nWhen the well-assembled PS@[Cu(NH3)n] 2+ monolith was ground to very small pieces for the subsequent synthesis, the ordered porous structure and cuboctahedral morphology remained in the obtained products (Fig. S15\u2020). All of these results indicate that the 3D-ordered assembly of the PS template, and not the PVP surfactant, shaped themorphology of the porous Cu2O. Therefore, an inspection of the PS assembly was carried out by SEM, which revealed that PS spheres assumed a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure to form a closely packed PS template (Fig. S16\u2020). In a basic fcc unit, each PS sphere is surrounded by 12 other spheres (Fig. S17a\u2020) that are located at the vertexes of a cuboctahedron (Fig. S17b\u2020). Consequently, the space around each sphere in the assembled template is divided into 14 parts, with different orientations by the 12 adjacent spheres.34 When Cu2O crystals grow inside the closely packed PS template, the crystals can move in only 14 directions (6 in the [100] direction and 8 in the [111] direction)\nChem.

The consecutive growth of Cu2O by the same limitations of each PS sphere template will exclusively result in the formation of cuboctahedral morphology (Fig. 2a).\nTo validate the nanospace-conned growth model, control experiments were carried out by changing the assembly ordering of the PS template. It was found that only the closely packed PS template produced porous cuboctahedra, which were gradually transformed to porous spheres aer increasing the chaos of the assembled PS template (Fig. S18\u2020). The HAADFSTEM image consistently revealed that the formed pores were randomly distributed inside the spheres (Fig. 2c\u2013e). Except for the above-mentioned shaping and pore-directing effect of the assembled PS template, fullling the template voids by reagents is critical for producing high-quality 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO because the severe and distinct volume shrinkage occurring during the conversion of copper precursors to Cu2O can easily deform the porous structures and aggravate the irregular morphologies.13,31 In a typical synthesis without ammonia treatment of the PS@Cu2+, the pre-adsorbed Cu precursors will be dissolved and migrate out of the PS template, resulting in irregular products containing porous and nonporous particles (Fig. S19\u2020). Therefore, the success of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO production in the present study relies on the shape and templating effect of the 3DOP PS template and the subtle utilization of a molecular fence, which guarantees the fulllment of Cu2+.\nElectrochemical CO2RR performance in an H-type cell\nAs a proof-of-concept, the conned enhancement of the 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction\nFig. 2 Effect of the assembled PS template on crystal morphology.

For comparison, nonporous Cu2O cuboctahedra (abbreviated as Cu2O\u2013CO) (Fig. S20\u2020) were synthesized and examined under the same conditions. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots obtained in CO2-saturated electrolyte catalyzed by the two different catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3a. The 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO exhibited a higher current response over the entire potential range, indicating that CO2RR is kinetically favored on the 3DOP Cu2O\u2013 CO in comparison to the nonporous catalyst.\nTo investigate the number of active sites and their accessibility, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of different catalysts were then estimated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) method aer electrode activation treatment. The 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO produced a larger Cdl value of 2.9 mF cm\u22122 as compared to that of Cu2O\u2013CO (1.6 mF cm\n\u22122) (Fig. 3b and S21\u2020), indicating the high exposure and accessibility of the active sites in 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO. The sequence of the ECSA value was in agreement with that of the Brunauer\u2013 Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area calculated from N2 sorption isotherms (Fig. S22\u2020), in which 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO possessed a higher surface area of 66.0 m2 g\u22121 in comparison to Cu2O\u2013CO (5.0 m2 g\u22121). More importantly, the capacity of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO to adsorb CO2 molecules (4.96 m\n3 g\u22121) was much larger than that of Cu2O\u2013CO (2.79 m 3 g\u22121), suggesting the promising\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Based on the number of carbon atoms in the products, there were three categories of products: C2+ products (C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COOH, and n-C3H7OH), C1 products (CO, CH4, and HCOOH), and H2 (Fig. S24\u2020). 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO showed superior selectivity for C2+ products in comparison to that of the nonporous Cu2O\u2013CO sample (Fig. 3c, S24, and Table S2\u2020). 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO provided a maximum C2+ FE of 73.4% at\u22121.4 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), exceeding that of Cu2O\u2013CO (56.2%) (Fig. 3c and Table S2\u2020). The 3DOP Cu2O sample promoted the conversion of CO2 to C2+ products other than the C1 products, with relatively high C2+-to-C1 ratios at all the examined potentials, suggesting that the ordered porous structures evoke additional C\u2013C coupling during the CO2RR (Fig. 3d).\nEven when compared with the reported results, the 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO provided top-level FE for the valuable C2+ products (Table S3\u2020). To assess the catalytic stability and selectivity of the catalysts, the electrochemical CO2RR was carried out under steady-state conditions at\u22121.4 V vs. RHE. It is worth noting that 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO possessed robust long-term stability in current response and product selectivity for C2H4 and C2+ during a 24 hour CO2RR electrolysis test (Fig. 3e). Structural degradation and composition regression are the two key factors that decrease the catalytic activity in the CO2RR catalyzed by Cu2O.43,44 By imparting porosity to Cu2O crystals to generate interconnected ordered porous structures, superior structural integrity prevented the 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO from undergoing such degradation (Fig. S25 and S26\u2020). All the above results demonstrate that the as-prepared 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO promotes the conversion of CO2 into C2+ products with a high catalytic durability."

            "text": "To explore the origins of the superior C2+ selectivity of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO, nite-element method (FEM) simulations were implemented to track the key reaction species of CO2RR in the conned space of 3DOP architectures. In the simulations, CO2 molecules diffused into the nanopores of the 3DOP architecture, where the CO2 molecules were adsorbed onto the pore walls and reduced to C1 intermediates (Fig. 4a and S27\u2020). The local concentration of C1 intermediates will accumulate and then dimerize to C2 species by increasing likelihood of C\u2013C coupling (Fig. 4b). All the results validate the concentration of C1 species by nanopores via the steric connement effect, and signicantly enhanced accumulation was achieved in the internal pores of the 3DOP architecture, indicating the coherent effect of the ordered porous structure in conning C1 intermediates for C\u2013C coupling reactions. However, in the case of nonporous Cu2O\u2013CO, the CO2 molecules can only be adsorbed on the external surfaces, and the formed C1 intermediates are\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\neasily released as C1 products (CO, CH4, and HCOOH) (Fig. S28\u2020).\nTo provide mechanistic insights into the enhanced C2+ production, we performed in situ attenuated total reectancesurface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATRSEIRAS) under CO2RR conditions to identify the key intermediates and their evolution as the applied potentials were varied. As displayed in the ATR-SEIRAS spectra of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO, the vibrational band centered at approximately 2100 cm\u22121, which corresponds to the atop conguration of *CO adsorption, appeared at 0.2 V vs. RHE and gradually increased to the maximum at \u22120.2 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4c). As the applied potential bias increased further, the peaks assigned to *CO adsorption disappeared, and new peaks ascribed to *CHO (1490 cm\u22121), *OCCOH (1593 cm\u22121), and *OCCO (1548 cm\u22121),45 which are the key reaction intermediates for forming C2 products, appeared in the ATR-SEIRAS spectra (Fig. 4c).\nThe *CO is widely used to evaluate the *CO coverage on a catalyst,9,46 and, therefore, it can be concluded that the *CO rst accumulates on 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO, and then is consumed by the C\u2013C coupling reaction to form multi-carbon products. As two-factor authentication, the peaks corresponding to the Cu\u2013 CO stretching (369 cm\u22121) and C^O stretching (2090 cm\u22121) of adsorbed *CO were also observed in the in situ Raman spectra for 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO (Fig. 4d).47 In great contrast to 3DOP Cu2O\u2013 CO, no obvious adsorption peaks related to the abovementioned intermediates were detected for the nonporous Cu2O\u2013CO sample (Fig. 4e and S29\u2020). All the above results supply evidence that the 3DOP nanoarchitectures can entrap CO intermediates to form an adequate amount of *CO ready for C\u2013C coupling, thus evoking the formation of C2+ products.\nIt was demonstrated that the product selectivity of the electrochemical CO2RR was pH sensitive. A great pH gradient always occurs at the electrode surfaces with large roughness factors,48 and, therefore, monitoring the local pH near the electrode surface is critical to elucidating the correlation between the local pH environment and the catalytic activity and selectivity. In the CO2/bicarbonate system, the in situ Raman measurement, which displays the adsorbed HCO3\n\u2212 (1015 cm\u22121) and CO3\n2\u2212 (1078 cm\u22121) signals, is an effective method for providing the local pH values.45,49 The local pH value of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO increased from 10.8 to 11.2 when the potential bias changed from 0 to \u22120.5 V vs. RHE, whereas the pH value remained lower than 10.8 for Cu2O\u2013CO (Fig. 4f and Table S4\u2020), suggesting the steric connement of the OH\u2212 of the ordered porous structures. The high local alkalinity triggered by the 3DOP nanoarchitecture not only suppresses the competing reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also greatly benets the C\u2013C coupling reaction of *CO in the formation of C2+ products.48\nThe chemical states of Cu2O during the electrocatalysis of CO2 were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The deconvolution of the Cu 2p spectra and the related analysis of the component tting for different samples (Fig. S30 and Table S5\u2020) were carried out according to previous studies.50 The Cu 2p and Auger Cu LMM XPS spectra revealed that the surface\nChem.

The Cu local structure was probed by extended X-ray absorption ne structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), and showed the typical Cu\u2013Cu bond (2.3 \u00c5) for Cu foil, and Cu\u2013Cu (2.8 \u00c5) and Cu\u2013O (1.5 \u00c5) bonds for the Cu2O reference sample (Fig. 4h). Transformation of the Cu2Orelated peaks to the Cu\u2013Cu bond in Cu foil was clearly\n13856 | Chem.

The smaller CN value for the 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO sample suggests a larger number of unsaturated sites (Fig. S31 and Table S7\u2020), which was in agreement with the abundant atomic defects recognized on the concave surface of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO and the grain boundaries in the Cu2O skeletons (Fig. 1c and S12\u2020). Such unsaturated atomic sites have been proven to be favorable for the adsorption of reaction intermediates.8,52 The abundant adsorption of *CO, *OCCOH, and *OCCO intermediates is capable of preventing the reduction of\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Targeted to CO2-to-C2+ conversion at ampere-level current density, the electrochemical CO2RR of the 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO was then performed in a ow cell reactor, which enabled gaseous CO2 to diffuse to the catalyst layer directly from the gas-diffusion layer.53\u201355 Catalyst ink consisting of 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO or Cu2O\u2013CO was directly spray-coated on hydrophobic carbon paper to form a gas-diffusion electrode (GDE), which was then constructed as the cathode in the ow cell reactor (Fig. 5a).\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nThe ow cell measurement revealed that 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO exhibited high C2+ selectivity and largely depressed H2 and CO production under the entire range of applied current densities (Fig. 5b and S32\u2020). At a current density of \u22121.0 A cm\u22122, the 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO sample achieved the highest FE of 81.7% for C2+ products. However, the FE for C2+ sharply decreased from 41.2% to 6.7% over nonporous Cu2O\u2013CO when the applied current density decreased from \u22120.2 to \u22121.0 A cm\u22122 (Fig. 5b). More impressively, the partial current density of C2+ products over 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO continued to increase, and reached \u22120.89 A cm\u22122 at an applied current density of \u22121.2 A cm\u22122, outperforming that of Cu2O\u2013CO (no higher than \u22120.12 A cm\u22122) (Fig. 5c). Additionally, the C2+ formation rate consistently increased to 2.92 mmol h\u22121 cm\u22122 under a current density of \u22121.2 A cm\u22122 (Fig. 5d).\nA careful comparison of the CO2-to-C2+ electrochemical catalytic performance revealed that 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO exhibited\nChem.

            "text": "Ordered porous Cu2O was designed to selectively convert CO2 to value-added C2+ products by imparting spatial connement engineering to an effective Cu2O catalyst. A molecular fenceassisted hard templating strategy was used to successfully synthesize 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO in a conned space for the rst time. The resultant 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO exhibited a three-dimensional interconnected porous structure obtained from the wellpatterned templates. The integrity of the 3DOP construction not only prevented structural deformation, but also entrapped additional CO intermediates to form an adequate amount of *CO, which was ready for C\u2013C coupling to form C2+ products under CO2 electrolysis.\nTherefore, the as-designed 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO exhibited excellent performance for CO2 electrolysis, with FEs for C2+ up to 73.4% in the H-type reactor, 81.7% in the ow cell reactor, and satisfactory retention of product selectivity. Importantly, 3DOP Cu2O\u2013CO achieved CO2-to-C2+ conversion with a partial current density of \u22120.89 A cm\u22122 at a formation rate of 2.92 mmol h\u22121 cm\u22122 under an applied current density of \u22121.2 A cm\u22122.
