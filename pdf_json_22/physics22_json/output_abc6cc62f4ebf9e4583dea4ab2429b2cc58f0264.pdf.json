    "abstractText": "Confined electrons in low dimensions host desirable material functions for downscaled electronics as well as advanced energy technologies. Thermoelectricity is a most fascinating example since the dimensionality modifies the electron density of states dramatically, leading to enhanced thermopower as experimentally examined in artificial two-dimensional (2D) structures. However, it is still an open question whether such an enhanced thermopower in low dimensions is realized in layered materials with strong 2D characters, such as cuprates. Here, we report unusual enhancement of the thermopower in the layered organic compound \u03b1-(BEDT-TTF)2I3, where BEDT-TTF stands for bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene. We find that the slope in the Jonker plot (thermopower S vs logarithm of electrical conductivity ln \u03c3 ) for \u03b1-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 is significantly larger than that of conventional semiconductors. Moreover, the large slope is also seen in the related layered salt, demonstrating the impact of the 2D-confined carriers in the layered organics on thermoelectricity.",

Thermoelectricity is a most fascinating example since the dimensionality modifies the electron density of states dramatically, leading to enhanced thermopower as experimentally examined in artificial two-dimensional (2D) structures. However, it is still an open question whether such an enhanced thermopower in low dimensions is realized in layered materials with strong 2D characters, such as cuprates. Here, we report unusual enhancement of the thermopower in the layered organic compound \u03b1-(BEDT-TTF)2I3, where BEDT-TTF stands for bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene. We find that the slope in the Jonker plot (thermopower S vs logarithm of electrical conductivity ln \u03c3 ) for \u03b1-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 is significantly larger than that of conventional semiconductors. Moreover, the large slope is also seen in the related layered salt, demonstrating the impact of the 2D-confined carriers in the layered organics on thermoelectricity.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043050\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThermoelectricity, a fundamental property of solids to generate the electric-field E under the temperature gradient \u2207T with the proportional coefficient S known as the thermopower or the Seebeck coefficient as E = S\u2207T in an open circuit, offers a simple solid-state technology for the direct heatto-electricity conversion, yet it is a very challenging issue to establish the guiding principles for the high-performance thermoelectrics [1,2]. From a fundamental point of view, the semiclassical Boltzmann approach gives an approximate formula of the thermopower for a degenerate electron gas, which is well known as the Mott relation,\nS = \u03c0 2\n3 kB q kBT d ln \u03c3 (\u03b5) d\u03b5 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u03b5=\u03bc , (1)\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, q is the carrier charge, \u03c3 is the electrical conductivity, and \u03bc is the chemical potential [3], signifying a close link to the energy dependence of the conductivity. Indeed, this relation underlies as a basal guideline for various schemes, such as the band structure [4] and the mobility [5] engineering in which the microscopic parameters in the conductivity formula, such as the density of states (DOS) and the relaxation time are successfully controlled to increase the thermopower.\nAmong the various concepts based on the Mott relation, the reduced dimensionality is a straightforward and intriguing\n*okazaki@rs.tus.ac.jp\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

If the electron chemical potential is close to the edge as in the case of a narrow-gap semiconductor, the energy derivative of the DOS is expected to diverge so as to afford extraordinarily large thermopower [6]. This theoretical proposal has motivated well-conceived transport measurements on the artificial systems, such as the one-dimensional (1D) nanowires [7,8] and the two-dimensional (2D) superlattices [9], leading to the experimental demonstration of the improved dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2\u03c3T/\u03ba , where \u03ba is the thermal conductivity, although these observations seem to come from the phonon effect [7,8,10] rather than the proposed DOS modification. On the other hand, Ohta et al. presented unusually large thermopower emerged from the 2D electron gas (2DEG) in the oxide superlattice [11], indicating a 2D quantum confinement to vary the DOS. Moreover, such a 2DEG has also been realized at the surface of the three-dimensional (3D) compounds incorporated into the field-effect-transistor structure in which a systematic evolution of the thermopower of the 2D-confined carriers is achieved by the gate voltage tuning [12,13].\nA key question subsequently arises: does such a drastic modification in the DOS enhance thermopower in a bulk material with low dimensionality? Many of remarkable physical phenomena have been found as a result of the low-dimensional structures. Here, we focus on the charge transfer organic salt \u03b1-(ET)2I3 [ET being bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene (BEDT-TTF)] in which the ET and the I3 anion layers are alternatingly stacked to form the 2D-layered crystal structure as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) [14]. This material exhibits a charge-order transition at TCO = 136 K [15,16], which is driven by the intersite Coulomb repulsion [17]. The two dimensionality in the charge-order phase below TCO is clearly evidenced by the anisotropy in the resistivity [18] as well as an occurrence of a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition\n2643-1564/2022/4(4)/043050(6) 043050-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nat TKT \u2248 35 K [19]. In this paper, we performed the electrical conductivity \u03c3 and the thermopower S measurements on \u03b1-(ET)2I3 single crystals with a systematic evaluation of the sample dependence. The thermopower in the charge-order phase is unusually large and incompatible with the conventional band picture but is well scaled in the S- ln \u03c3 plot, which is strikingly similar to that in the 2D-confined electrons realized in the oxide superlattices."

The resistivity and the thermopower were simultaneously measured by using a conventional four-probe method and a steady-state method, respectively [21,22]. For the thermopower measurement, a manganin-constantan differential thermocouple was attached to the sample by using a carbon paste and the temperature gradient (|\u2207T | \u2248 0.5 K/mm) was applied by using a resistive heater. The thermoelectric voltage from the wire leads was subtracted. The rate of temperature change is lower than 0.3 K/min to prevent the damage to the sample."

All the samples exhibit the metal-insulator transition at TCO = 136 K owing to the charge order. On the other hand, one may find the significant sample dependence in the magnitude of the resistivity shown in Fig. 2(a). Although there is an inevitable ambiguity of the the sample size and the current path in the resistivity measurement, in general, this sample dependence may also be intrinsic as observed in the thermopower. In the inset of Fig. 2(a), we plot the temperature dependence of\nthe normalized resistivity by the value at T = 160 K. The in-plane anisotropy between the resistivity data measured for J\u2016a (\u03c1aa) and for J\u2016b (\u03c1bb) is clearly seen just above the transition temperature TCO: whereas \u03c1aa exhibits a gradual decrease in heating, \u03c1bb shows a minimum structure near T = 145 K, which has also been observed in the earlier study [18]. This in-plane resistive anisotropy may originate from the charge-disproportionation fluctuations existing even in the high-temperature phase [23]: the stripe-type charge order along the b axis [24,25] may induce a smooth charge flow along the same direction but form strong potential barriers along the a-axis direction to suppress the conduction."

            "text": "Figures 2(b) displays the temperature dependence of the thermopower S. The overall behavior of the thermopower is similar to earlier results that reported this material [14]: The thermopower is positive and relatively small value as expected in the metallic state, whereas it changes its sign and shows the large absolute value in the insulating phase. This behavior is also qualitatively consistent with the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient [18]. On the other hand, the detailed nature of the thermopower has been not discussed in the first report [14] in which the thermopower was given as evidence for the metal-insulator transition at TCO. We also note that the thermopower of \u03b1-(ET)2I3 has been intensively studied to investigate the exotic Dirac-like electronic states driven by pressure [26,27].\nThe observed sample dependence of the transport properties may originate from the disorder effect, which is suggested to be intrinsic in this material. This is experimentally evidenced by the relaxor-type dielectric response [18,28] in sharp contrast to the 1D charge-order salts [29] and the negative magnetoresistance in the charge-order phase possibly due to the weak localization [18]. Although it requires detailed future study, the origin of disorders may stem from the anions layer [18]: The I\u22123 anions are still chemically reactive as an oxidant\n043050-2\nin the crystal. The transition temperature TCO is, nevertheless, little affected, showing the cohesive properties in the conduction layers are substantially retained. Such a disorder effect, however, should affect on the transport properties seriously [30]. In addition, the high-temperature phase of \u03b1-(ET)2I3 above TCO is semimetallic, consisting of small number of electrons and holes (ne \u2248 nh \u2248 1018 cm\u22123) with high mobility (\u03bce \u2248 \u03bch \u2248 102 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121), where ne(h) and \u03bce(h) are the carrier density and the mobility of the electrons (holes), respectively [18]. In this case, the thermopower is weighted by the conductivity of each carrier as S = (\u03c3eSe + \u03c3hSh)/(\u03c3e + \u03c3h), where \u03c3e(h) = ene(h)\u03bce(h) and Se(h) are the conductivity and the thermopower of electrons (holes), respectively. Hence, the thermopower should be quite sensitive to the balance of the contributions from electrons and holes; the predominant carrier in the semimetallic state above TCO is hole as also indicated from the Hall coefficient [18], but the aforementioned disorder may influence the delicate balanced carrier density and mobility, resulting in the sample-dependent thermopower as seen in the inset of Fig. 2(b)."

Quite interestingly, although the resistivity and the thermopower are sample dependent as mentioned, the slope of the S- ln \u03c3 plot in the insulating phase seems to be nearly equal among the measured samples as guided by the dotted lines. Note that in the semiconductors with the thermal activation energy gap of Eg, the electrical conductivity and the thermopower are expressed as \u03c3 = \u03c30 exp(\u2212Eg/2kBT ) and S = (kB/q)(Eg/2kBT ), respectively (\u03c30 being a constant),\nleading to a relationship between S and ln \u03c3 as\nS = \u2212kB q (ln \u03c3 \u2212 ln \u03c30), (2)\nand, hence, the magnitude of the slope becomes a universal value of kB/|q| \u2248 86 \u03bcV/K (kB ln 10/|q| \u2248 200 \u03bcV/K), which well holds in several conventional semiconductors [32]. On the other hand, the slope of the S- ln \u03c3 plot in the insulating phase of \u03b1-(ET)2I3 is about 700 \u03bcV/K in common, which is much larger than the conventional value of 200 \u03bcV/K, indicating an unusual mechanism to enhance the thermopower operating in \u03b1-(ET)2I3. Note that the intersection of the dotted line to S = 0 in Fig. 3(a), which corresponds to ln \u03c30 in Eq. (2) is sample dependent. This is consistent with the presence of the sample-dependent disorder since the impurity concentration is generally included in \u03c30. (The error of the sample size in determination of the resistivity could also be involved in this horizontal intercept.)\nThe origin of the enhanced thermopower in \u03b1-(ET)2I3 is most crucial. The two-carrier effect is excluded because it generally induces the cancellation of the thermopower. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the mobility is also unlikely since temperature variations of the resistivity and the Hall coefficient are fairly scaled in the insulating phase [18]. On the other hand, a large slope in the Jonker plot has been reported in the 2DEG realized in the oxide superlattice and discussed in terms of the modified DOS for the 2D-confined electrons: whereas the series of the 3D-doped SrTiO3 bulk samples exhibits the conventional value of the slope of 200 \u03bcV/K in the Jonker plot, the 2D-SrTiO3 superlattice yields a large value of the slope of 1000 \u03bcV/K [11]. The remarkable resemblance to the present results evidently suggests a similar modification of the DOS acting for the correlated electrons confined in the 2D layers of \u03b1-(ET)2I3. Although the conventional band picture is not applicable to the present charge-order system with strong electron correlation,\n043050-3\nwe speculate that the edge of the DOS where the carriers are thermally excited, may show a steep change as a function of energy owing to the two dimensionality, leading to the enhanced thermopower. This effect can be enhanced by the in-plane anisotropy, or pseudo-1D character at the bottom of the upper band (electron carriers) as pointed out by the calculations [30]."

This unique behavior in the layered organic salts may stem from the highly anisotropic nature of the molecular orbitals [Fig. 1(a)]: the \u03c0 lobes of the ET molecules spread along the in-plane directions strengthen the 2D nature, whereas the typical layered oxides, such as the layered perovskite A2BO4 are composed of rather 3D units of octahedra BO6 [Fig. 1(b)].\nThe prominent two dimensionality in organics is clearly seen in the resistivity anisotropy \u03c1\u22a5/\u03c1\u2016 (\u03c1\u22a5 and \u03c1\u2016 being the resistivity measured for the out-of-plane and the in-plane directions, respectively). In the insulating phase of \u03b1-(ET)2I3, it yields \u03c1\u22a5/\u03c1\u2016 \u2248 103 [18]. This is significantly larger than\nthat of layered oxide insulators. For instance, whereas the anisotropy in the 2D-correlated metal Sr2RuO4 is as large as \u03c1\u22a5/\u03c1\u2016 \u2248 103 owing to the 2D-cylindrical Fermi surface [38], it becomes almost unity \u03c1\u22a5/\u03c1\u2016 \u2248 1 in the isovalent 2D-Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 [39]. The anisotropy \u03c1\u22a5/\u03c1\u2016 also decreases near the Mott insulating phase of the cuprates so that the system becomes less two dimensional [40]. Thus, the present paper serves a fascinating playground to examine the thermoelectricity of the 2D-confined correlated electrons in the bulk organic compounds, opening up a particular route to apply the low-dimensional organic thermoelectrics. It is noteworthy that the charge glass organic systems exhibit a large resistive anisotropy of \u03c1\u22a5/\u03c1\u2016 \u2248 106 at low temperatures [41]. Also, the 1D organic conductor exhibits a colossal thermopower [42] in which the low dimensionality should be essential."

            "text": "To summarize, we have systematically measured the electrical resistivity and the thermopower of \u03b1-(ET)2I3 single crystals. Although the transport properties are sample dependent, the thermopower is well scaled as a function of the conductivity in the Jonker plot. Importantly, the slope of the S- ln \u03c3 plot in the insulating phase is unusually larger than that in conventional semiconductors, indicating 2D-confined correlated carriers to enhance the thermopower."
