"In this study, flowers, flower buds, stems and leaves of LJT were analyzed with untargeted metabolomics based on UHPLC-Q-TOF MS. The major active components were identified in different tissues of LJT, including flavonoids, phenolic acids and iridoids. The content of metabolites in four tissues were significantly different. Flower buds were rich in flavonols, phenolic acids and iridoids. Flowers contained more acylated flavonol glucosides, phenolic acids and iridoids. Leaves were rich in flavones, and most metabolites showed lower content in the stems. The changes in metabolite content and composition can lead to differences in pharmacological effects and mechanisms among the four different tissues."
