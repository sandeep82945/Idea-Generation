    "abstractText": "The tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) is the most abundant group of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a critical role in the regulation of tumor progression and treatment resistance. Based on different polarization status, TAMs may also induce antitumor immune responses or immunosuppression. The present study identified JMJD6 (Jumonji domaincontaining 6) as a novel modulator of TAM activation, the upregulation of which was associated with the immunosuppressive activities of TAMs. JMJD6 deficiency attenuated the growth of both Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors and B16F10 melanomas by reversing M2-like activation of macrophages, and sensitized tumors to immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs). Moreover, the JMJD6induced inhibition of M2 polarization was potentially mediated by the STAT3/IL-10 signaling. These findings highlight the regulatory activities of JMJD6 in TAM polarization, and the therapeutic potential of JMJD6/STAT3/IL-10 axis blockades to enhance the efficacy of ICBs in cancer treatment.",

            "text": "Tumors are not simple stacks of malignant cells, but a complex system involving the tumor microenvironment (TME) including the extracellular matrix, vascular system and immune cells [1]. The tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) is the most abundant group of immune cells in the TME, which plays a critical role in the regulation of tumor progression and treatment resistance [2, 3]. TAMs are often characterized with the gene expression profile of M2 macrophages, such as the surface markers CD163, CD206 and Arg1, and the secretory factors IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 [4]. Substantial evidence suggests the protumoral effect of TAMs such as the promotion of tumor growth, angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, and tumor cell invasion and motility [5, 6]. TAM infiltration in some cases may induce immunosuppression by reshaping the immune microenvironment through the inhibition of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response [7]. It is thus intriguing to speculate whether the therapeutic targeting of TAMs could revert the suppressive TME by blocking the immunosuppressive activities of TAMs. On the other hand, despite numerous efforts, the molecular mechanism of TAMs polarization remains incompletely defined. The present study for the first time identified JMJD6 (Jumonji domain-containing 6) as a novel regulator of TAM activation which would serve as a therapeutic target and combination partner for ICBs in cancer. The aberrant expression of JMJD6 has been reported in a wide panel of tumor types such as breast [8], hepatic [9], prostate cancer [10], colorectal [11] cancer and neuroblastoma [12]. The tumor expression of JMJD6 was also correlated with treatment resistance [13]. For instance, JMJD6 has been identified as a\npredicting marker for tumor response to tamoxifen endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients [14]. Moreover, with its arginine demethylation activities, JMJD6 is involved in multi-organ autoimmunity, modulating immune pathways such as Toll-like receptor related signal transduction. JMJD6 regulates the level of medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC) mature proteins via its ability to induce intron retention and the release of the Aire gene, which is required for self-immunity in the thymus [15]. JMJD6 was initially conceived as a phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR, Ptdsr) expressed on the surface of macrophages, mediating the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [16]. In recent years, broader localization of JMJD6 was detected including the nucleus [17], cytoplasm, and extracellular matrix [18], and its target proteins including histones [19], non-histones p53 [20] and protein associated with RNA-splicing [21]. A recent report provided new insights to the mechanisms of JMJD6-mediated breast cancer progression. The genetic inhibition of JMJD6 decreased ANXA1 expression, preventing M2 polarization of macrophage and tumor aggressiveness [22]. This study aims to identify the role of JMJD6 in macrophage polarization and the remodeling of tumor microenvironment composition. We detected an upregulated JMJD6 level in TAMs which led to an immunosuppressive phenotype of TAMs. JMJD6 deficiency could attenuate the growth of both LLC tumors and B16F10 melanomas by reversing M2-like activation of macrophages, potentially mediated by STAT3/IL10 signaling. Moreover, therapeutic inhibition of JMJD6 sensitized tumors to ICB treatment. Thus, the JMJD6/STAT3/IL-10 axis is a key switch in TAMs activation and a promising combination partner for ICBs.\nReceived: 25 December 2022 Revised: 9 July 2023 Accepted: 11 July 2023 Published online: 11 August 2023\n1Laboratory of Aging Research and Cancer Drug Target, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.17, Block3, Southern Renmin Road, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, People\u2019s Republic of China. 2These authors contributed equally: Siyuan Chen, Manni Wang. \u2709email: xiaweiwei@scu.edu.cn\nwww.nature.com/oncOncogene\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () ;,:\nRESULTS JMJD6 is upregulated in TAMs and indicates poor prognosis of cancer The TME is characterized by the infiltration of a series of immune cells. To understand the role of JMJD6 in cancer, the expression\nlevels of JMJD6 in different tumor-infiltrating cell subgroups were evaluated with flow cytometry assays in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tissues (Fig. 1a). Among the seven types of tumor-infiltrating cells including tumor cells (CD45-), neutrophils (CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80- Ly6Cmid/+), monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G\u2212 Ly6C+), DCs\nOncogene (2023) 42:2737 \u2013 2750\n(CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80\u2212 CD11c+ MHC-II+), T cells (CD45+ CD3+), B cells (CD45+ CD19+), and TAMs (CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80+), TAMs displayed the highest JMJD6 expression level (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. S1a, b). Notably, although tumor cells constitute the majority of tumor bulks, the average JMJD6 expression level in tumor cells was significantly lower compared with tumorinfiltrating immune cells (Fig. 1a). The immunofluorescence (IF) staining results verified the presence of JMJD6 in TAMs (CD45+ F4/ 80+) (Fig. 1b). Compared with tumor cells (CD45\u2212) and other immune cells (CD45+ F4/80\u2212), TAMs (CD45+ F4/80+) exhibited higher JMJD6 expression. Additionally, JMJD6 expression of TAMs, monocytes in blood or macrophages in vital organs was measured by flow cytometry, which suggested that TAMs had higher JMJD6 expression than macrophages in other tissues or monocytes in blood (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. S1c). To validate the results in cancer patients, we assessed the expression levels of JMJD6 with immunofluorescence in tumor stroma of paired human tumors and adjacent normal tissues. Consistent results were observed that JMJD6 was widely expressed in tumor stromal cells of multiple cancer types including gastric, liver, colon, lung and ovarian cancer (Fig. 1d). To identify the prognostic value of JMJD6 expression in tumor stromal cells, tumor tissues from 109 ovarian cancer patients and 97 lung cancer patients were collected and classified according to their JMJD6 expression in stromal cells as low, medium, and high expression groups. Patients with higher JMJD6 expression in stromal cells had significantly worse survival compared with those with low or medium expression (Fig. 1e, f). These results suggested that JMJD6 was upregulated in tumor stromal cells that are mainly consisted of macrophages [23], and was correlated with the worse prognosis of cancer patients.\nJMJD6 is upregulated in macrophages stimulated by tumorconditioned medium and promotes macrophage activation In order to mimic the effect of tumor cells on macrophages in vivo, we utilized tumor-conditioned medium (tumor-CM) containing supernatants from tumor cell culture to stimulate mouse primary macrophages (M0), including primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and peritoneal macrophages (PM) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Compared with macrophages cultured in normal medium, tumor-conditioned macrophages (TC-M\u03c6) stimulated by tumor-CM were transformed from an elongated, branched appearance to a rounder shape with vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2a). The expression of TAM-associated markers CD206 and the level of IL-10 in TC-M\u03c6 was next evaluated with flow cytometry and CBA analysis, respectively. Results demonstrated that CD206 was upregulated in TC-M\u03c6 and that TC-M\u03c6 produced expressed higher levels of IL-10 than M0 (Fig. 2b). Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF) were increased in the medium supernatants of TCM\u03c6 (Fig. 2c, d). In addition, tumor-CM effectively upregulated JMJD6 expression in both BMDMs and PMs of mice (Fig. 2e). The in vivo impact of JMJD6 expression on macrophage activation was analyzed using wide-type (WT) and Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice. Following stimulation with tumor-CM, BMDMs and PMs of Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice displayed significantly lower JMJD6 mRNA levels than WT mice (Fig. 2f). The expression of CD206 and secretion of IL-10 were both\ndownregulated in macrophages and their medium supernatants collected from Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2g, h). These results indicated that the inhibition of JMJD6 in macrophages might prevent the tumorCM-induced M2-like activation of these macrophages. Moreover, by detecting the secretion of M1-like chemokines and cytokines by macrophages from Jmjd6+/\u2212 and WT mice, we found that Jmjd6 deficiency failed to decrease the M1 activation of TAMs (Fig. 2i), suggesting that the inhibition of JMJD6 only affected the M2 activation, rather than M1 activation of TAMs. The production of IL-10 was significantly correlated with JMJD6 expression in macrophages as detected by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S2b).\nImpaired tumor growth in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice is macrophagedependent To evaluate the role of JMJD6-expressing macrophages in tumor progression, we established two tumor models in WT and Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice with subcutaneous injection of LLC lung cancer cells and intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells. The tumor growth curves demonstrated a delayed growth of subcutaneous LLC tumors in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 3a). At the end of the experiment, the average tumor weight of Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice was significantly decreased (Fig. 3b). According to flow cytometry analyses, the proportion of CD206+ TAMs (M2-like TAMs) and IL-10 expression level of total TAMs and M2-like TAMs were decreased in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 3c\u2013e). Likewise, in the B16F10 pulmonary metastasis model, the Jmjd6 knockdown impaired tumor growth as demonstrated by reduced number of lung metastasis and lung weights (Fig. 3f\u2013h). Though the proportion of total TAMs in immune cells was decreased in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice, the decrease might be attributed to reduced M2-like TAMs rather than M1-like TAMs (Fig. 3i). Meanwhile, IL-10 expression in M2-like TAMs was suppressed in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3j). Immunohistochemistry images of CD31 and Ki67 staining in subcutaneous LLC tumor sections were shown in Supplementary Fig 4. Tumors of Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice displayed decreased CD31 and Ki67 positivity compared with WT mice, suggesting Jmjd6 deficiency in macrophages resulted in decreased intratumoral vascular density and tumor cell proliferation. To determine whether the antitumor efficacy of JMJD6 knockdown was macrophage-dependent, mice were administered with clodronate liposomes (CLO Lipo) to deplete macrophages during the course of tumor growth. As shown in Fig. 3k\u2013l, CLO Lipo significantly depleted total TAMs (CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80+) and M2-like TAMs (CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80+ CD206+) in WT mice, whereas total TAMs and M2-like TAMs were not reduced in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice after intraperitoneal injection of CLO Lipo. The CLO Lipo treatment was also found to delay tumor growth and decrease the foci number of pulmonary metastasis in WT mice, which could not be observed in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3n, m). Interestingly, we found that CLO Lipo reduced the difference in tumor growth between WT mice and Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3n, m). These results indicated that the impaired tumor growth in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice was dependent on macrophages.\nTumor-conditioned medium upregulates JMJD6 expression in human monocyte cell line An acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1 was used to investigate the role of JMJD6 in human monocytes. THP-1 cells\nFig. 1 JMJD6 is upregulated in TAMs, and correlates with the cancer prognosis. a JMJD6 expression in tissue macrophages (monocytes in blood) was detected by flow cytometry, n= 4. b Representative immunofluorescence images of tumor sections from mice subcutaneously implanted with LLC cells, labeled by CD45 (yellow), F4/80 (red), JMJD6 (green) and DAPI (blue). Scale bars are marked in individual images. c JMJD6 expression in tumor cells (CD45-), tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G\u2212 Ly6C+), monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G\u2212 Ly6C+), DCs (CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80\u2212 CD11c+ MHC-II+), T cells (CD45+ CD3+), B cells (CD45+ CD19+), and TAMs (CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80+) was detected by flow cytometry, n= 4. d Representative immunofluorescence images of tumor tissues from clinical samples. As marked in images, sections were labeled with CD68 (red), JMJD6 (green), DAPI (blue). Scale bars are marked in individual images. Survival curves of ovarian cancer patients (e) and lung adenocarcinoma patients (f) grouped by JMJD6 expression in stromal cells (left panel), analyzed by Logrank test for trend. Immunohistochemistry images were representative regions of JMJD6 expression in the stromal cells (right panel). Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.\nOncogene (2023) 42:2737 \u2013 2750\nactivated by either PMA alone or together with tumor-CM from human tumor cells, were named M0-like THP-1 and TAM-like THP1, respectively. Figure 4a presented the morphological changes of na\u00efve THP-1, M0-like THP-1 and TAM-like THP-1. In contrast to the loosely suspended round THP-1 cells, M0-like THP-1 macrophages\ndifferentiated into a tightly adherent state, and TAM-like THP-1 macrophages displayed a fully differentiated morphology with an elongated, pseudopodia-like shape (Fig. 4a). Additionally, flow cytometry results confirmed the increased expression of macrophage differentiation markers including CD11c, CD11b and CD68\nOncogene (2023) 42:2737 \u2013 2750\nin PMA-induced M0-like THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 4b). Moreover, we also observed an increase in expression of CD206, a marker of TAMs, and the production of IL-10 in tumor-CM-induced TAM-like THP-1 compared with M0-like THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 4c, d, Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Notably, western blot results showed that tumor-CM effectively elevated JMJD6 expression level, which was also found to be increased in TC-M\u03c6 cells compared with M0like THP-1 cells (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 6c). Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed the upregulated JMJD6 level in TC-M\u03c6 cells (Fig. 4f).\nJMJD6 knockdown inhibits the activation of human monocytes To further asses the role of JMJD6 in THP-1 activation, we interfered JMJD6 expression in THP-1 cells with JMJD6 mRNAtargeting short hairpin RNA (shRNA-JMJD6, sh-J6). The Mock (blank) group and sh-Scrambled group (transduced with lentivirus expressing scrambled shRNA) were used as control groups throughout all shRNA-involved experiments. The qPCR results confirmed the decrease of JMJD6 expression in mRNA level caused by sh-J6 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Western blot assays indicated that sh-J6 induced a significant reduction in JMJD6 protein level whereas sh-Scr treatment had no effect on JMJD6 expression (Fig. 5a). To examine the role of JMJD6 in THP-1 activation, we detected JMJD6 expression in sh-Scr- or sh-J6transfected THP-1 cells following tumor-CM stimulation (Fig. 5b). The sh-J6 group showed low JMJD6 expression even with tumorCM stimulation, and the control groups both showed higher JMJD6 expression following tumor-CM stimulation. Consistent with the findings on mouse macrophages, the CD206 positivity of sh-J6 THP-1 cells was lower than that of sh-Scr group (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, IL-10 secretion was significantly decreased in sh-J6 TAM-like THP-1 cells compared with TAM-like THP-1 cells in control groups (Fig. 5d), whereas no difference was observed in the secretion of M1-like chemokines and cytokines between sh-J6 TAM-like THP-1 cells and control cells (Supplementary Fig. 7b). To identify differentially expressed protein-coding genes in JMJD6-knockdown TAM-like THP-1 cells, RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was performed in TAM-like THP-1 cells transfected with blank, sh-Scr and sh-J6. The heatmap demonstrating the expression pattern of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was presented in Fig. 5e. A total number of 2765 and 1798 DEGs were extracted in sh-J6 vs Mock group, and in sh-Scr vs Mock group, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7c). The venn diagram summarized the 1424 DEGs overlap between the two comparisons (Fig. 5f). Based on the RNA-Seq results, we identified a global upregulation of M1 related genes and a global downregulation of M2 related genes in JMJD6-knockdown group (Fig. 5g). To identify the role of JMJD6 expression in the antitumor effect of TAM-like THP-1 cells, we collected conditioned medium (CM) of Mock, sh-Scr or sh-J6 TAM-like THP-1 cells, and resuspended human lung cancer H460 cells with the CM, which was then inoculated subcutaneously in NOD-SCID mice (Fig. 5h). Compared with tumors formed by non-treated tumor cells, the volume of tumors formed by H460 cells incubated with supernatant of Mock and sh-Scr group were significantly increased. However, the\ntumor-promoting effect of sh-Scr group was reduced by sh-J6 TAM-like THP-1 supernatants (Fig. 5i\u2013j). These results confirmed the tumor-promoting effect of TC-M\u03c6, which can be reversed by JMJD6 silencing, suggesting the regulatory role of JMJD6 in the protumoral activities of TC-M\u03c6.\nJMJD6 upregulates IL-10 expression of TAM via STAT3 pathways To investigate the underlying mechanisms of JMJD6-modulated macrophage activation, we analyzed the expression level of JMJD6 and M2-polarizing cytokines IL-10 in tumor-CM-activated macrophages. The identified positive correlation between JMJD6 and IL10 expression leads to the hypothesis that IL-10 modulation by JMJD6 might be mediated by the STAT3 pathway. Western blot assay suggested the accumulation of p-STAT3Y705 in tumor-CMactivated macrophages in a time-dependent manner, with the most evident accumulation observed in macrophages following 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 6a). The phosphorylation level of STAT3Y705 was decreased in TAMs derived from BMDM of Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice compared with those from WT mice, and STAT3Y705 expression was also downregulated in sh-J6 THP-1 macrophages compared with sh-Scr THP-1 (Fig. 6b). To determine the action mechanism of JMJD6 on STAT3, the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed which validated the interaction between JMJD6 and STAT3 (Fig. 6c). GST pull-down experiments demonstrated the direct binding between JMJD6 and STAT3 (Fig. 6d). We then performed the tyrosine kinase assay by incubating recombinant STAT3 with different doses of recombinant JMJD6 and assessing the phosphorylation of STAT3. The tyrosine kinase assay suggested that JMJD6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in the in vitro system (Fig. 6e). To elucidate whether the increased induction of IL-10 by tumor-CM in THP-1 cells was p-STAT3Y705 dependent, napabucasin was used as a selectively inhibitor of STAT3 synthesis, phosphorylation and activation. The expression levels of STAT3 and p-STAT3Y705 in TAM-like THP-1 cells were analyzed after treating THP-1 cells with napabucasin for 24 h. Napabucasin significantly reduced the expression of p-STAT3Y705 in a dosedependent manner without affecting the total STAT3 protein levels in TAM-like THP-1 cells (Fig. 6f), and a dose-dependent decrease in IL-10 by napabucasin with the most significant decrease observed in TAM-like THP-1 cells treated with 1 \u03bcM napabucasin (Fig. 6g). The CBA assay was performed on the supernatants from THP-1 cell culture, and revealed a lower level of IL-10 production by TAM-like THP-1 cells treated with napabucasin (Fig. 6h).\nJMJD6 knockdown enhances PD-1-sensitivity in mice Based on the regulatory role of JMJD6 in immunosuppression, we investigated whether targeting JMJD6 in macrophages had a synergistic effect with PD-1 blockade in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. We treated melanoma-bearing WT and Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice with in vivo anti-mouse PD-1 McAb once every 3 days from the third day of tumor inoculation (Fig. 7a). At the end of the experiment, Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice treated with PD-1 blockade developed a smaller number of lung metastasis foci, whereas PD-1 blockade\nOncogene (2023) 42:2737 \u2013 2750\nfailed to induce significant tumor inhibition in WT mice (Fig. 7b, c). The HE staining further suggested that JMJD6 inhibition sensitized mice to PD-1 blockade in terms of tumor formation in lung (Fig. 7d). According to flow cytometry analyses, PD-1 McAb treatment reduced the number of M2-like TAMs in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice,\nbut there was no significant change in the number of immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages in WT mice treated PD-1 McAb (Fig. 7e). In addition, an increase in the proportion of total T cells and activated cytotoxic T cells was observed in Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice treated with PD-1 McAb (Fig. 7f, g). These results collectively\nOncogene (2023) 42:2737 \u2013 2750\nsuggested that Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice were more sensitive to anti-PD-1 McAb, and the combination of JMJD6 inhibition and PD-1 blockade could induce a more potent antitumor immune response."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Immune cells and non-immune cells collectively compose the TME and determine the fate of tumors. By inducing stromal cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix deposition (ECM), the abundantly-infiltrated TAMs reshape the\nTME into one that favors tumor progression [24]. TAMs mainly present the M2 phenotype and are related to the poor prognosis of tumor patients [5, 25]. Thus, targeting M2-TAMs is a potential therapeutic strategy to reverse the immunosuppressive TME. Current therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs mainly fall into four categories. (1) the inhibition the recruitment of TAMs to tumor sites by blocking various chemokines produced by tumor cells and stromal cells [26]; (2) the depletion of TAMs with CSF1R antibodies [27]; (3) reprogramming TAMs by switching the M2 polarization state to M1 [23]; (4) targeting the\nOncogene (2023) 42:2737 \u2013 2750\nimmunoinhibitory molecules on TAMs such as leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B (LILRB) [28] and PDL1 [29]. Given the fundamental role of tissue-resident macrophages in maintaining homeostasis, the indiscriminative depletion of macrophages may cause serious damage to physiological functions [30\u201332]. By contrast, interfering the M2 polarization of TAMs is considered a safe option that effectively reduces the\nimmunoinhibitory activities of TAMs and at the same time has no impact on the recruitment and maintenance of other macrophages [33]. The exact molecular mechanism underlying the switch of TAM polarization status remains incompletely defined. The present work investigated the role of JMJD6 in the polarization and antitumor function of TAMs, and discussed the potential therapeutic value of JMJD6-targeted strategies.\nOncogene (2023) 42:2737 \u2013 2750\nThe aberrant expression of JMJD6 is associated with progression, prognosis and treatment resistance in multiple tumors such as breast [8], hepatic [9], prostate cancer [10] and neuroblastoma [12, 13]. In addition to the tumor expression of JMJD6, recent studies suggested that the correlation of JMJD6 with tumor prognosis was not only based on tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms, but also the molding the TME. These results provided new insights to the mechanisms of JMJD6-mediated cancer progression that JMJD6 might promote the M2 polarization of macrophage and the subsequent tumor aggressiveness [22]. However, it remains incompletely defined whether and trough which mechanism JMJD6 regulates the activation of TAMs and the tumor microenvironment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research demonstrating the high expression of JMJD6 in tumorinfiltrating macrophages. To certify the regulatory role of JMJD6 in macrophage polarization, the macrophages used in this study were collected from different origins, including primary BMDMs, PMs, and human monocyte cell line THP-1. Given the known neonatal lethality of Jmjd6\u2212/\u2212 mice [34], the primary macrophages were isolated from Jmjd6+/\u2212 mice. It has been well-established that STAT3 signaling is involved in the regulation of immune response by macrophages [35], with a higher level of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages of STAT3-knockout mice [36]. STAT3 is a key signaling molecule for macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and is an important signal transducer for oncogenic proteins [37, 38]. In this study, we found that JMJD6 induced M2 macrophage polarization via the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Accordingly, blocking the JMJD6STAT3 axis by JMJD6-knockdown impaired tumor growth in vivo. The upregulated STAT3 in macrophages may also impair the antigen-specific T-cell response [39]. It is thus conceivable that targeting the JMJD6-STAT3 axis in TAMs could improve the antitumor immune reactions mediated by T cells. Though ICB treatments displayed promising efficacy in controlling tumor growth by unleashing the restricted T-cell\u2013mediated activities against tumor cells [40], many patients ultimately develop resistance to ICB therapy, which may be attributed to the high infiltration of immune-suppressive myeloid cells such as TAMs [41, 42]. Whereas the single use of anti-PD-1 antibody failed to induce significant antitumor effect in this study, JMJD6 knockdown overcame the resistance of metastatic melanoma cells to anti-PD-1 treatment, suggesting the combination potential of JMJD6 inhibition with ICB therapies."

            "text": "Taken together, our study demonstrated that the M2 polarization of macrophages in TME is potentially mediated by the JMJD6/ STAT3/IL-10 signaling (Fig. 7h). JMJD6 promotes the M2 activation and protumoral activities of macrophages, thereby establishing an immunosuppressive TME favoring tumor growth. Moreover, JMJD6 knockdown overcame the tumor resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment, making TAMs-targeted therapy a potential combination partner for ICB therapies.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and antibodies THP-1 cells were cultured in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium [supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 mg/ mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL)], and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) was added to the medium to culture THP-1 cells.
