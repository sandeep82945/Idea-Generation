    "abstractText": "Lead is the most widely used X-ray-shielding material, but it is heavy (density \u2248 11.34 g/cm3) and toxic. Therefore, the replacement of Pb with lightweight, ecofriendly materials would be beneficial, and such materials would have applications in medicine, electronics, and aerospace engineering. However, the shielding ability of Pb-free materials is significantly lower than that of Pb itself. To maximize the radiation attenuation of non-Pb-based shielding materials, a high-attenuation crosssection, normal to the incoming X-ray direction, must be achieved. In this study, we developed efficient X-ray-shielding materials composed of sulfated cerium oxide (S-CeO2) and bismuth halides. Crucially, the materials are lightweight and mechanically flexible because of the absence of heavy metals (for example, Pb and W). Further, by pre-forming the doped metal oxide as a porous sponge matrix, and then incorporating the bismuth halides into the porous matrix, uniform, compact, and intimate composites with a high-attenuation cross-section were achieved. Owing to the synergetic effect of the doped metal oxide and bismuth halides, the resultant thin (approximately 3 mm) and lightweight (0.85 g\u00b7cm\u22123) composite achieved an excellent X-ray-shielding rate of approximately 92% at 60 kV, one of the highest values reported for non-heavy-metal shielding materials.",

            "text": "Ionizing radiation, including \u03b3-rays, X-rays, and neutrons, is widely utilized in the nuclear, military, space, and medical fields [1,2]. In particular, X-rays are the most frequently utilized radiation in medical diagnosis, therapy, industrial inspection, and academic research [3\u20135]. Therefore, the demand for X-ray-based technology is expected to increase continuously. However, excessive exposure to X-rays is harmful. In particular, X-ray radiation exposure, particularly long-term high-energy radiation exposure, can cause cancer [6,7]. Therefore, the use of X-rays as an analytical tool presents a risk for the instrument operators [8,9]. Consequently, adequate X-ray protection is crucial to keep workers safe, and numerous strategies for developing effective X-ray radiation-shielding materials have been proposed [10\u201313]. Owing to its high density and Z value, lead is the most effective material for radiation shielding, particularly for preventing \u03b3-ray and X-ray penetration [14]. Typical Pb-based shielding materials comprise Pb particles impregnated with Si or rubber [15,16]. However, a disadvantage of Pb-based materials is their toxicity, and their potential for leakage as a result of matrix damage, cracking, and aging [15]. Additionally, the majority of Pb-based shielding materials are heavy and bulky, and their applications in wearable radiationprotective clothing are hampered by their lack of flexibility and weight [17]. Therefore, for convenience and practicality, lightweight and ecofriendly non-Pb shielding materials are required [18].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6045. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28166045 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6045 2 of 12\nMetals (e.g., W, Ba, and Sn) and metal oxides (e.g., WO3, CuO, and Bi2O3) of high-Z elements have been studied for use in non-Pb-based radiation-shielding materials, to solve these issues [19\u201321]. Because metals and metal oxides are usually processed in powder form, polymers are frequently mixed together as supporting components. Using these composites, a wide range of desired shapes can be obtained, including plates, fibers, and sheets. However, the majority of X-ray-shielding composites described in the literature contain more than 50% polymer, which makes only a small contribution to the X-ray attenuation [21\u201323]. Consequently, the shielding performance is dependent on the distribution of metal particles in the polymer matrix, and is limited by the polymer components in the composites. To achieve a high radiation attenuation, the interaction between the radiation and the shielding material must be maximized; that is, the attenuation cross-section must be high. This is directly affected by the particle dispersion in the composites. However, because the dispersion of metal particles is sensitive to many factors, such as the miscibility, temperature, and humidity, achieving a uniform and reproducible composite remains a challenge. Another factor for efficient radiation shielding is a high electron density in the materials. High-Z elements have high electron densities, but they are usually heavy, owing to their higher proton and neutron numbers. Therefore, doping is a promising strategy to increase the electron density of materials without increasing their weight. In this study, novel multicomponent X-ray-shielding materials composed of sulfated cerium oxide (S-CeO2) and bismuth halides were developed for the first time. As the Ce (\u03c1: 6.76 g/cm3, Z: 58) and Bi (\u03c1: 9.78 g/cm3, Z: 83) are relatively low-density metals with high Z values, their derivatives of CeO2 and bismuth halides were explored for X-ray shielding in this work. Both S-CeO2 and bismuth halides exhibit good X-ray attenuation abilities. Owing to the successful surface sulfation of CeO2 crystals (sulfate ratio of approximately 6.5%), the S-CeO2 showed enhanced shielding ratios compared to pristine CeO2. In addition, we pre-formed the S-CeO2 in a porous polymer-based sponge matrix, and then incorporated bismuth halides into the porous matrix; this strategy was used because the bismuth halides would otherwise be immiscible. The resultant materials were uniform, compact, and intimate composites, with a high-attenuation cross-section. After optimization, the multicomponent X-ray shielding exhibited an excellent X-ray-shielding rate of approximately 92% at 60 kV, which is among the highest values reported for non-heavy-metal shielding materials. Furthermore, the composites are lightweight (0.85 g\u00b7cm\u22123), mechanically flexible, and ecofriendly, because of the absence of Pb. We expect that this study will pave the way for the development of efficient and lightweight radiation-shielding materials, using a combination of doped metal oxides and metal salts."

            "text": "Figure 1 shows the fabrication of the S-CeO2/BiI3 composite, as well as photographs of each product. There were three fabrication steps: (1)sulfation, (2) porous structuring, and (3) the incorporation of bismuth halides. First, CeO2 was sulfated by chemically bonding sulfonic (\u2013SO3H) groups to the CeO2 surface, as shown in Figure 1a. Sulfation was confirmed by the color change from white (CeO2) to yellow (S-CeO2) powder, as shown in Figure 1b,c. Sulfation is a good strategy for increasing the surface electron density of CeO2, thereby improving radiation shielding [24]. Sulfation also increases the catalytic activity and stability of the metal oxides [25\u201327]. Subsequently, a porous S-CeO2 sponge was fabricated as an X-ray-shielding material (Figure 1e). Crucially, for shielding applications, the metal oxide powders should be moldable, enabling the formation of shapes, such as plates, fibers, or films. To achieve this, polymers (for example, epoxy or PDMS) are required as binders. However, because the polymers make a very small contribution to the X-ray attenuation, we introduced a third component with good X-ray attenuation. This was achieved by pre-forming a porous S-CeO2 sponge, and then soaking it in a bismuth halide solution (Figure 1d,e). As a result, a multicomponent X-ray-shielding sponge containing S-CeO2 and bismuth halide was formed, as shown in Figure 1e. Because both S-CeO2 and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6045 3 of 12\nbismuth halides exhibit a good X-ray attenuation, their combination is expected to result in efficient X-ray shielding.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 12\nhalide solution (Figure 1d,e). As a result, a multicomponent X-ray-shielding sponge con-\ntaining S-CeO2 and bismuth halide was formed, as shown in Figure 1e. Because both S-\nCeO2 and bismuth halides exhibit a good X-ray attenuation, their combination is expected\nto result in efficient X-ray shielding.\nFigure 1.

Structural and Functional Group Analysis of S-CeO2\nThe powder XRD (PXRD) patterns of pure CeO2 and S-CeO2 are shown in Figure 2a.\nThe diffraction patterns of CeO2 and S-CeO2 contain sharp and intense peaks, confirming\nthe good crystallinity of these materials. The peaks were indexed to JCPDS Standard No.\n65-5923 for CeO2, and the characteristic peaks in the PXRD pattern of CeO2 (before sul-\nfation) were detected at 28.56\u00b0 (111), 33.12\u00b0 (200), 47.59\u00b0 (220), 56.39\u00b0 (311), 59.14\u00b0 (222),\n69.52\u00b0 (400), and 76.86\u00b0 (331) in 2\u03b8, consistent with the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2.\nThe PXRD pattern of S-CeO2 was identical to the standard card, indicating that the intro-\nduction of sulfur had no effect on the crystallinity. The sulfation process may prevent the\nCeO2 particles from clumping together, which could increase their surface area, and re-\nduce their crystalline size. This is consistent with the observed decrease in crystallite size.\nHowever, the X-ray diffraction patterns did not show any significant peak shifts, suggest-\ning that sulfation did not affect the crystal structure or phase composition of CeO2.\nFigure 2b shows the FT-IR spectra of pure CeO2 and S-CeO2. In the spectrum of pure\nCeO2, the O-H stretching, CO2 asymmetric stretching, and C-O stretching vibrations were observed at 3369, 712, and 1057 cm\u22121, respectively. Figure 2b shows the FT-IR spectrum of\nS-CeO2. The bands observed for S-CeO2 indicate that its structure is substantially different from that of pure CeO2. The peak observed at 1625 cm\u22121 corresponds to the O-H stretching\nvibrations of the O-H group on the surface of S-CeO2 [28]. The observed peaks at 1087, 1047, and 982 cm\u22121 correspond to the stretching of the O=S=O, S=O, and S-O groups, re-\nspectively, in the sulfonic acid group of the S-CeO2 nanostructure. In addition, the sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) yielded a peak at around 3369 cm\u22121, which is similar to the stretching\nvibration of water molecules (-OH) [28]. These results confirm that the sulfation reaction\nintroduced sulfonic acid groups onto the surface of the CeO2 nanostructure.\nFigure 1.

(Stretford, UK)/AXIS SUPRA) was measured using a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 source, with a spot size of 400 \u00b5m and a pass energy of 40 eV. The morphology of the synthesized S-CeO2 was analyzed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-F200, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements and mapping were carried out. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, MIRA3 TESCAN, TESCAN KOREA, Seoul, South Korea) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed, to produce EDX spectra and elemental maps. The X-ray-shielding performance was measured using an X-ray instrument (Spellman, Precision X-ray Inc., X-Rad IR-160, Cabinet X-ray systems, USA) producing X-rays at the tube voltages of 60 and 100 kV, and a current of 4 mA, for 5 s."

            "text": "We have successfully demonstrated efficient and lightweight X-ray-shielding materials based on S-CeO2 and bismuth halides for the first time. The sulfation of the metal oxides enhanced their X-ray-shielding ability, as confirmed by structural, chemical, and spectroscopic analyses. The integration of the doped metal oxide as a porous sponge, and bismuth halide as a filler resulted in uniform, compact, and intimate composites with a high-attenuation cross-section. The thin (approximately 3 mm) and lightweight (0.85 g\u00b7cm\u22123) composites achieved an excellent X-ray-shielding rate of approximately 92% at 60 kV, which is among the highest values reported for non-heavy-metal shielding materials. This multicomponent lightweight PDMS/S-CeO2/BiI3 composite has potential applications in wearable X-rayshielding garments, medical imaging, and nuclear power plant safety.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28166045/s1, Figure S1: Additional data for sample preparation; Figure S2: EDX of S-CeO2; Figure S3: SEM images of PDMS; Figure S4: Elemental mapping of PDMS; Figure S5: SEM images of PDMS/S-CeO2; Figure S6: Elemental mapping of PDMS/S-CeO2; Figure S7: SEM images of PDMS/S-CeO2/BiI3; Figure S8: Elemental mapping of PDMS/S-CeO2/BiI3; Table S1: Quantitative data on the chemical composition; Table S2: Comparison of X-ray-shielding performances.
