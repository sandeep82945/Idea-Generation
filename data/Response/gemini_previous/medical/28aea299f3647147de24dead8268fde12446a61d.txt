1. **Investigate the effectiveness of different educational interventions in improving patient knowledge and understanding of perioperative opioid use.** This could include comparing different types of educational materials, such as written materials, videos, or interactive online modules, as well as different methods of delivery, such as individual counseling, group sessions, or online learning.


2. **Develop and evaluate the effectiveness of clinical decision support tools to help clinicians identify patients at risk of opioid-related adverse events (ORADEs).** This could involve using electronic health records to identify patients with risk factors for ORADEs, such as a history of opioid misuse or a high dose of opioids prescribed.


3. **Conduct a prospective cohort study to examine the relationship between preoperative opioid use and postoperative outcomes, such as pain control, length of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction.** This study could help to identify patients who are at greatest risk of developing persistent postoperative opioid use (PPOU) and could inform the development of targeted interventions to prevent PPOU.


4. **Evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies for deprescribing opioids in patients who are no longer experiencing pain.** This could include comparing different tapering schedules, different types of non-opioid pain relievers, and different methods of patient support.


5. **Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the costs and benefits of different opioid stewardship interventions.** This study could help to determine which interventions are most cost-effective and could inform decision-making about which interventions to implement.
