Investigation of Propolis' Potential in Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Microorganisms: Given the reported antimicrobial activity of propolis, especially against Gram-positive bacteria, further research could focus on its efficacy against antibiotic-resistant strains. This could involve isolating specific compounds within propolis that exhibit the strongest antimicrobial effects and testing them against a wider range of resistant microorganisms.

Exploration of Propolis in Wound Healing Applications: Due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, propolis could be studied as a potential natural remedy for wound healing. Research could focus on the development of propolis-based creams, ointments, or dressings, and evaluate their effectiveness in promoting wound healing and preventing infection in clinical settings.

Standardization and Quality Control of Propolis for Pharmaceutical Use: With the variability in chemical composition of propolis, establishing standardized extraction and purification processes to ensure consistent bioactive profiles would be valuable. This could involve developing guidelines for propolis collection, processing, and storage, alongside the creation of standardized assays to measure the bioactive compound content and activity.

Study of Propolis' Anti-Cancer Potential: The paper highlights propolis' anticancer potential but suggests a need for more comprehensive studies. Future research could focus on identifying and isolating specific phenolic compounds in propolis that exhibit anticancer activities, determining their mechanisms of action, and evaluating their efficacy in vivo using animal models or clinical trials.

Development of Propolis-Based Dental Care Products: Given its antimicrobial activity, particularly against bacteria responsible for dental diseases, propolis could be explored as an ingredient in dental care products such as toothpaste, mouthwash, and gum. Studies could investigate the efficacy of these products in reducing dental plaque, gingivitis, and periodontitis, as well as their safety for long-term use.
