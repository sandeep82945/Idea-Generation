Comparative Studies Across Different Populations and Conditions: Conducting similar studies comparing DCE and PTT methods across different populations, including those with specific health conditions or lower health literacy, could help understand how these methods perform in diverse settings. Additionally, exploring these methods in various countries or cultures could provide insights into the impact of cultural differences on MAR estimates and method preferences.

Investigation of the Impact of Attribute Presentation and Functional Forms on MAR Estimates: This study suggests that the way attributes are presented (linear vs. categorical) and assumed functional forms could significantly impact MAR estimates. Future research could systematically vary these aspects to understand their influence better and to develop guidelines for choosing the most appropriate presentation and analysis strategies for MAR estimation in healthcare decision-making.

Development and Evaluation of Guidelines for PTT Studies: Given the novelty and relative lack of standardized guidelines for conducting PTT studies compared to DCE studies, there is a significant opportunity for research into developing evidence-based guidelines for designing, conducting, and analyzing PTT studies. This could include best practices for attribute and level selection, choice task construction, and data analysis.

Exploration of Techniques to Measure Preference Heterogeneity More Effectively: This paper highlights the challenges of identifying preference heterogeneity using subgroup analyses in DCE data. Research into alternative analytical techniques, such as hybrid models that combine features of DCE and PTT or enhanced latent class models, could provide new ways to uncover and understand heterogeneity in patient preferences more effectively.

Longitudinal Studies to Understand Changes in MAR Over Time: Investigating how individuals' maximum acceptable risks change over time, especially as they acquire personal experience with a condition or treatment, could provide valuable insights for healthcare decision-making and policy. This could involve longitudinal studies tracking changes in MAR and preferences using DCE and PTT methods over significant periods, especially in the context of chronic diseases or conditions requiring long-term treatment decisions.
