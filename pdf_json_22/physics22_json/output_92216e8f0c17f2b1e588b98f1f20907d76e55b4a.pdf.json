            "text": "Understanding of the structure of low-lying scalar mesons is important in hadron physics. So far, several scalar mesons have been observed below 1 GeV: f0(500) with I = 0, K\u22170 (700) with I = 1/2, f0(980) with I = 0, and a0(980) with I = 1, as listed in Ref. [1]. One of the characteristic features of these scalar mesons is that, unlike the vector mesons, the mass of the isovector a0(980) meson is not close to that of the isoscalar f0(500) meson; rather, the a0(980) meson, being nonstrange, is heavier than the strange K\u22170 (700) meson. It is expected that mesons are composed of a quark and an antiquark. Nevertheless, naive quark models based on the q\u0304q picture cannot explain the mass ordering of these light scalar mesons, because the masses of hadrons containing strange quarks should be heavier than those without strange quarks there. It has been suggested that this \u201cinverse mass ordering\u201d of the light scalar mesons can be explained by the tetraquark picture q\u0304q\u0304qq [2]. In this picture the isovector meson can have a hidden s\u0304s component that gives\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Physical Society of Japan.

Apart from that, these scalar mesons have strong coupling to two pseudoscalar mesons and eventually have a large decay width. Such unstable resonances are described in hadron\u2013hadron scattering. For instance, the f0(500) meson can be regarded as an s-wave resonance in the isosinglet pion\u2013pion scattering [3\u20137]. In this way, with the structure of the scalar mesons being controversial, many pictures for the scalar mesons have been proposed so far, such as two-quark q\u0304q, four-quark q\u0304q\u0304qq, glueball, meson\u2013meson scattering, and a mixture [8\u201322].\nAnother aspect of the nature of scalar mesons is that there must exist scalar fields transformed from pion fields under chiral transformation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), i.e., chiral partners of the pions [23]. Chiral symmetry is an approximated symmetry in QCD and is broken dynamically by the flavor-singlet scalar condensate \u3008q\u0304q\u3009 with the emergence of the pseudoscalar Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons corresponding to the pion and its flavor partners. The fluctuation mode of the quark condensate, the \u03c3 meson, is regarded as one of the signals for the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. It is not yet understood how the sigma meson should appear in the observed spectrum. Here we have the reason that we adhere to the q\u0304q picture for the scalar mesons.\nSo far there have been several attempts to reproduce the inverse mass ordering in the q\u0304q picture [9,24\u201332]. The key ingredient is the interaction induced by the U(1) axial anomaly [33\u201341], the so-called Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa\u2013\u2019t Hooft (KMT) interaction. For instance, Ref. [28] employed an extended three-flavor Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the six-point KMT interaction to study the mass spectrum of the light scalar mesons. The KMT interaction works for the flavor-singlet scalar meson as an attractive interaction, while for the octet scalar meson it behaves as a repulsive interaction. This term, therefore, contributes to the isosinglet scalar meson to reduce its mass to below that of the other scalar mesons with I = 1 and I = 1/2. This is consistent with the mass ordering between f0(500) and the other scalar mesons. The flavor SU(3) breaking is introduced to the NJL model by the mass difference of the current quarks and enters the meson mass spectrum through the constituent quark masses and the quark condensates. Owing to the flavor-singlet nature of the KMT interaction, the KMT interaction works for the strange isodoublet meson with the up or down quark condensate, while it contributes to the isovector meson with the strange quark condensate. Because the absolute value of the strange quark condensate is larger than those of the up and down condensates if the perturbative contributions are included, the repulsion of the KMT interaction is larger for the isovector meson than for the isodoublet meson. This is consistent with the inverse mass ordering. Nevertheless, the flavor symmetry breaking in the quark condensates is not sufficient to reproduce the inverse ordering of the masses for the I = 1 and I = 1/2 mesons. Reference [9] was able to reproduce the inverse mass ordering of the light scalar mesons in a linear sigma model with the KMT interaction by introducing unsatisfactorily strong flavor symmetry breaking on the meson decay constants. In an NJL-like model [31,32], by introducing a large number of terms including explicit flavor symmetry breaking with the current quark mass, the inverse mass ordering was reproduced. Recently Ref. [22] proposed a new mechanism to realize the inverse mass ordering of the scalar mesons in a linear sigma model with a U(1) axial anomaly induced term including the current quark mass. The anomaly induced term with the current quark mass works similarly in the original KMT interaction for the scalar meson masses but with the current quark mass instead of the quark condensate. Thanks to a large flavor symmetry breaking in the current quark masses, say ms/mq \u223c 25, the repulsive anomaly induced interaction con-\n2/18\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2023/3/033D 01/7055963 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\ntributes to the isovector meson much more than to the isodoublet meson. Consequently the mass of a0(980) is given as larger than that of K0(700) in this model.\nIn this paper we utilize the Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio model [42] to study the masses of the light scalar mesons in the q\u0304q picture. Motivated by Ref. [22] for the linear sigma model, we introduce the chiral anomaly term with the current quark mass to calculate the meson masses. We examine whether this term also works to reproduce the inverse mass ordering for the light scalar mesons in the NJL model.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, the formulation of this work is explained. In Sect. 3, we show our numerical results. In Sect. 4 we discuss the diquark masses and the GellMann\u2013Oakes\u2013Renner relation in this model. Finally, Sect. 5 is devoted to the conclusion of this paper. In the appendix, the calculation details are shown."

In this Lagrangian, it is understood that the determinant is taken in the flavor space, the latin letters, i, j, k, a, b, c are the flavor indices of the quark fields running from 1 to 3, and the summations is taken over the repeated indices. We assume isospin symmetry by mq = mu = md. We call the up and down quark fields collectively q and the strange quark field s.\nThe last two terms in the Lagrangian (1) originate from the chiral anomaly in QCD. The term with gD, known as the Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa\u2013\u2019t Hooft interaction, provides six-point vertices, and is invariant under SU(3)L\u2297SU(3)R but breaks the U(1)A symmetry. With the presence of this term the \u03b7\u2032 meson is degraded from a Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The term containing gk is also an anomalous interaction and provides four-point interactions of quarks. This term can be found in effective Lagrangians for the quark fields in the instanton vacuum [47,48] by performing Fierz transformations for the color and Dirac spaces [49]. This type of interaction was introduced into a linear sigma model in Ref. [22] to investigate the inverse mass hierarchy of the scalar mesons and is also found in Ref. [31] as L2 for the NJL-like model. This term is unique for the scalar-type quark bilinears, q\u0304(1 \u00b1 \u03b35)q, induced by the U(1)A anomaly with linear dependence on the quark mass M.

To regularize the momentum integral, we make use of the three-momentum cutoff in accordance with the suggestion given in Ref. [46]. The calculated result of Eq. (5) is given in Eq. (A1). In the present work, the cutoff , which determines the mass scale of the scalar meson, is to be fixed at = 650 MeV commonly for three quarks. The qualitative consequences do not change with a small change in the value of the cutoff and the corresponding adjustment of the model parameters. With sufficiently large couplings in magnitude, the gap equations (4) provide non-trivial solutions where chiral symmetry is dynamically broken. We introduce dimensionless coupling constants as\nGS = gS g0S , GD = gD( g0S )2 , Gk = gkg0S , (6) with\ng0S = 2\u03c02\n3 2 , (7)\nwhich is the critical coupling of the dynamical symmetry breaking for gD = gk = 0 in the chiral limit.\nAccording to the effective Lagrangian derived in Ref. [47], the ratio of the coupling strengths of gk and gD is given as gk/gD = \u221225/(28\u03c02\u03c12), where \u03c1 is the instanton size. Equivalently, this implies, for the dimensionless couplings,\nGk GD = \u2212 25 42 2\u03c12 . (8)\nIf one takes a typical instanton size of \u03c1 \u223c 0.3 fm, the ratio of the dimensionless couplings is found to be Gk/GD \u223c \u22121 for = 650 MeV. In the present work, we consider both couplings as free parameters to be fixed by the experimental observations.\n4/18\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2023/3/033D 01/7055963 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nTable 1.

The quark indices i, j stand for the flavor of the quark and are appropriately chosen to provide the meson flavor. For the isospin I = 0 configurations of the flavor singlet and octet, we consider their quark contents to be 0 = 1\u221a3 (u\u0304u + d\u0304d + s\u0304s) and 8 = 1\u221a 6 (u\u0304u + d\u0304d \u2212 2s\u0304s), respectively. The explicit quark contents of the interpolating fields are summarized in Table 1. Here we call the isodoublet scalar meson \u03ba and the isovector scalar meson a0.\nThe mesons are dynamically generated in quark\u2013antiquark scattering with sufficiently strong attraction between the quark and the antiquark, and are expressed as poles of the scattering amplitude T. We calculate the T-matrix by solving the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation:\nT = K + KJT, (10) with the interaction kernel K and the quark loop function J. Here we use the ladder approximation in the center of mass frame.\nThe interaction kernel K is obtained directly from the four-point interactions of the gS and gk terms in the Lagrangian (1) and also from the six-point interaction with the mean field approximation.

We calculate the loop function with the same three-momentum cutoff as in the calculation of the quark condensate. This procedure keeps the chiral symmetry in the calculation. The explicit forms of the loop functions are shown in Eqs. (A2) for the scalar channel and (A3) for the pseudoscalar channel. The loop function for each meson channel is listed as\nJa0/\u03c0 (W ) = JS/P(W ; Mq, Mq), (15a)\nJ\u03ba/K (W ) = JS/P(W ; Mq, Ms), (15b)\nJS/P00 (W ) = 1 3 (2JS/P(W ; Mq, Mq) + JS/P(W ; Ms, Ms)), (15c)\nJS/P88 (W ) = 1 3 (JS/P(W ; Mq, Mq) + 2JS/P(W ; Ms, Ms)), (15d) JS/P08 (W ) = \u221a 2 3\n(JS/P(W ; Mq, Mq) \u2212 JS/P(W ; Ms, Ms)). (15e) The meson mass is obtained as the pole position of the scattering amplitude T(W).

(16)\nWe find the pole position of the scattering amplitude T by solving\n1 \u2212 KJ(W ) = 0, (17) for the single channel case. The loop function J(W) in the complex W plane has two Riemann sheets corresponding to the sign of the momentum and the branch cut runs along the real axis from the threshold of the particle production W = M1 + M2 to +\u221e. The solutions of Eq. (17) found in the first Riemann sheet and below the threshold correspond to the bound states. The bound state solutions appear on the real axis.

Because of the lack of the confinement mechanism in the NJL model, the mesons that are generated above the threshold decayyinto a quark and an antiquark. These decays are indeed model artifacts of the NJL model.\nWith the flavor symmetry breaking, the I = 0 channels of the flavor singlet and octet couple with each other and the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation becomes a matrix equation:(\nT00 T08 T08 T88\n) = ( K00 K08 K08 K88 ) + ( K00 K08 K08 K88 )( J00 J08 J08 J88 )( T00 T08 T08 T88 ) .

In Sect. 3.3 we discuss the constituent quark masses for finite Gk.\n3.1. Determined parameters The model parameters, mq, ms, GS, and GD, are determined for each Gk so as to reproduce the masses of \u03c0 , K, and \u03b7\u2032 and the pion decay constant. The explicit values of these input quantities are shown in Table 2. Since the \u03b7\u2032 meson in this model is found as a resonance with a large width above the threshold of the strange quark\u2013antiquark production, we reproduce the observed \u03b7\u2032 mass by the real part of the calculated resonance mass.

These behaviors can be explained by the following argument. We determine the model parameters so as to reproduce the observed masses of the pion and kaon. The meson masses are obtained as the pole position of the T-matrix, which is calculated by the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (10) with the interaction kernel K. To keep the pion mass as Gk increases, the interaction kernel for the pion should also stay as it is for Gk = 0. According to Eq. (12a), as the effect of the Gk term increases with a massive ms, the effects of the GS and GD terms should be reduced, and thus the sizes of GS and GD have to decrease. Note in Eq. (12a) that both GD and \u3008s\u0304s\u3009 have a negative value. Because the Gk term comes with a small mq for the kaon in Eq. (12b), its effect is insignificant for the interaction kernel for the kaon. This would reduce KK and the kaon channel would get more repulsive. To keep the kaon mass in this repulsive change, the current strange quark mass should be reduced.\nIt is also interesting to mention that GS is less than unity. According to Ref. [50], this situation is called anomaly-driven symmetry breaking, where the U(1)A anomaly plays an essential role in the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. In such a situation, the mass of the sigma meson should be smaller than 800 MeV. The current model also suggests that anomaly-driven symmetry breaking takes place and predicts that the sigma meson mass is found to be less than 800 MeV, as we will show in the next subsection. We also mention that as shown in Eq. (8) the instanton vacuum model suggests Gk \u223c \u2212GD for the instanton size \u03c1 \u223c 0.3 fm and the cutoff = 650 MeV. Table 3 tells us that this relation is realized in our model at Gk \u223c 0.7. Thus, we are considering values of Gk of the same order of magnitude as the instanton vacuum model.\n3.2. Scalar meson masses Fixing the model parameters for each Gk, we calculate the meson masses for Gk from 0.0 to 2.0. The results are summarized in Table 4. The \u03c3 and \u03b7 mesons are found below the threshold of the q\u0304\u2013q pair creation without a decay width. This implies that they are bound states of two constituent quarks and do not decay into the quark pair or mesonic modes. This is because we do not consider mesonic decay channels in the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equations. On the other hand, the a0, \u03ba, and \u03c3 \u2032 mesons are found as resonances with decay widths. The a0 and \u03ba mesons are generated in the single q\u0304\u2013q and s\u0304\u2013q scattering channels, respectively, and these resonance states are located above the thresholds of these channels. The \u03c3 \u2032 mesons are in the coupled channels of the q\u0304\u2013q and s\u0304\u2013s scatterings and are found above both thresholds. The decay widths of these mesons are for the decay of the quark and antiquark due to the lack of the confinement mechanism in the NJL model. Therefore these decay widths are model artifacts and we do not\n8/18\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2023/3/033D 01/7055963 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nTable 4.

In Table 4 we show also our calculated results of the constituent quark masses, Mq and Ms, the quark condensates, \u3008q\u0304q\u3009 and \u3008s\u0304s\u3009, and the kaon decay constant fK.\nLet us first discuss the case of Gk = 0.0, which is the original NJL model with the determinant interaction. The constituent quark masses, Mq and Ms, are found as 309 MeV and 475 MeV, respectively, which are consistent with the empirical values. The kaon decay constant is underestimated in the present calculation, but this is known as one of the drawbacks of the NJL model [51]. As mentioned in the introduction, thanks to the heavier strange quark mass than those of the up and down quarks, the mass of the \u03ba meson is heavier than that of the a0 meson, which is the normal mass ordering and inconsistent with the observation. The \u03c3 meson is reproduced with a 600 MeV mass, which is consistent with an empirical value. The \u03b7 meson mass is reproduced reasonably well, although it is a bit underestimated in comparison with the observed \u03b7 meson mass.\nWe plot the Gk dependence of the meson masses in the left panel of Fig. 1. This figure shows that, as the value of Gk increases, the mass of the \u03ba meson decreases while the a0 mass increases.

Thus, the inverse mass order of the \u03ba and a0 mesons is realized for Gk > 1.0. This is understood as follows. We show the Gk dependence of the interaction kernels in Fig. 2. As seen in the left panel, the interaction kernel of the a0 meson decreases as Gk increases on one hand. This is because, as seen in Eq. (11a), the negative contribution of the Gk term to the interaction kernel Ka0 appears with a large current mass of the strange quark. On the other hand, the interaction kernel for the \u03ba meson increases gradually. This is because, for the \u03ba meson, the Gk term comes with the small current quark mass mq and its contribution becomes minor for the interaction kernel K\u03ba . In this way, we confirm that the new mechanism proposed in Ref. [22] also works well in the NJL model.\nFigure 1 shows that the \u03c3 meson mass gradually decreases as Gk increases. One may wonder why the \u03c3 meson mass decreases although the interaction kernel for the \u03c3 meson becomes weaker, as seen in Fig. 2. This is because in the \u03c3 meson the flavor-singlet component is dominant, as shown in Table 5, and thus the strange quark is also one of the main components of the \u03c3 meson. In addition, as seen in Fig. 1, the constituent strange quark mass is reduced as Gk increases, which will be discussed in the next section. Because the mass of the constituents is reduced, the mass of the \u03c3 meson decreases even though the coupling strength gets weaker.\n10/18\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2023/3/033D 01/7055963 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nFig. 3. Contents of the constituent quark masses for Gk = 0.0, 1.0, 2.0. The constituent quark masses are decomposed according to the right-hand sides of the gap equations (4). The symbols in the key, m, gS, gD, and gk, stand for the contributions from the first, second, third and fourth terms of the right-hand sides of Eq. (4), respectively.\n3.3. Constituent quark masses It is also interesting to note that Fig. 1 shows that the constituent strange quark also reduces its mass Ms as Gk increases, while the constituent quark mass Mq stays at the same value. This is also one of the reasons that the \u03ba meson mass is reduced with increasing Gk. In order to understand the origin of the reduction of the strange quark mass, let us decompose the contents of the constituent quark masses. The constituent quark masses are determined by the gap equations (4). The quark masses can be decomposed according to the right-hand side of Eq. (4), and we show this decomposition of the quark masses in Fig. 3. For the light quarks, u and d, one finds that the contribution of the Gk term is enhanced for larger Gk. This is because the Gk term for the light quarks appears with the current strange quark mass ms. At the same time, the contributions from the GS and GD terms are reduced. The contribution from the current quark mass is negligibly small for the light quarks. For the strange quark, the contribution of the Gk term is negligible, because this term appears together with the tiny current quark mass mq in the gap equation for the strange quark mass. Therefore, for the strange quark, there are no enhanced contributions for larger Gk. In addition, the contribution from the current quark mass also gets smaller with the reduction of the current strange quark mass.\n4. Discussion 4.1. Diquark mass With a finite Gk we obtain a smaller constituent strange quark mass. For Gk 2.0, where the inverse mass ordering is realized, the constituent strange quark becomes almost degenerate to the constituent up\u2013down quark. This means that the SU(3) breaking on the constituent quark masses gets weaker. In such a situation, one may wonder whether this degeneracy of the constituent quarks would be inconsistent with the baryon mass spectra. While the flavor SU(3) breaking of the constituent quark mass explains the mass difference of the light baryons in constituent quark models, other sources are also possible in different pictures. For instance,\n11/18\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2023/3/033D 01/7055963 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nTable 6. Quark contents of the diquark interpolating fields. Indices a, b, c are for the color space, q is the isodoublet quark field, and C is the charge conjugation matrix.\nScalar diquarks\naud = abc\u221a2 (uTb C\u03b35dc \u2212 dTb C\u03b35uc) aqs = abc\u221a2 (qTb C\u03b35sc \u2212 qTb C\u03b35sc)\nin the MIT bag model, the flavor breaking of the current quark masses introduces the mass difference of the light baryons [52,53], and in the cloudy bag model the mass difference between the pion and kaon contributes to the mass difference between the nucleon and hyperons [54\u201356]. Here we explore another source of flavor symmetry breaking in the baryon masses. The baryon masses in the NJL model may be obtained by using three-body Faddeev approaches [57\u201361]. Instead of direct calculations of the baryon masses, we would rather calculate the diquark masses, because the diquarks are significant ingredients of the baryons and the baryon masses can be expressed in terms of the diquark mass together with the constituent quark mass [62\u201364].\nWe consider flavor-antisymmetric scalar diquarks, so-called good diquarks, which are the most attractive channels among the diquarks. The interpolating fields for the scalar diquarks are shown in Table 6. To obtain the scalar diquark masses, we calculate the pole position of the scattering matrix of the two-quark system using the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (10). The interaction kernels for the diquark channels are also obtained from the Lagrangian (1) by performing a Fierz transformation. However, it is known that the Fierz transformation of the gS term in the Lagrangian (1) does not provides scalar diquark interactions. Here we assume that the strength of the gS term for the scalar diquark channels is a quarter of that of the pseudoscalar meson channel, which is obtained in the Fierz transformation of the color current interaction Lint = \u2212Gc \u22118 a=1(\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bct\na\u03c8 )2, where ta is the generator of color space. It is our aim to see the dependence of the diquark mass on the Gk parameter, while we are not interested in the quantitative reproduction of the diquark masses. Thus, the exact value of the coefficient of the gS term is irrelevant to our discussion. The gD and gk terms for the diquark channels can be obtained by the Fierz transformation of the Lagrangian (1), and then we have the interaction kernel of the diquark channels as\nKud = 14gS + 1 2 gD\u3008s\u0304s\u3009 + 14gkms, (23a)\nKqs = 14gS + 1 2 gD\u3008q\u0304q\u3009 + 14gkmq. (23b) The loop function for the diquark channel is defined by the correlation of the interpolating fields aD(x) given in Table 6 with (anti)color a and is obtained as the same form as the loop function for the pseudoscalar meson channel:\nJabD (W ) = i \u222b\nd4x eiP\u00b7x\u30080|T [ aD(x) bD(0)]|0\u3009 = \u03b4ab 2 3 JP(W ), (24)\nwith P\u03bc = (W, 0, 0, 0). The loop functions for the ud and qs diquarks are obtained as Jud (W ) = 23JP(W ; Mq, Mq), (25a)\nJqs(W ) = 23JP(W ; Mq, Ms), (25b) respectively.\n12/18\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2023/3/033D 01/7055963 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nThe diquark mass is obtained as a pole position of the T-matrix by solving Eq. (17). The calculated masses of the ud and qs scalar diquarks are plotted in the right panel of Fig. 1. Here we are interested in the flavor SU(3) breaking in the diquark masses, namely the mass difference between the ud and qs diquarks. The adjustment of their absolute values is out of the current scope. If one needed to reproduce diquark masses, one could tune the coefficient of the gS term, which acts on the interaction kernels in a flavor-symmetric way. The diquark masses are found above the qq and qs thresholds, and thus the diquarks have a decay width. In the figure we show their real parts. We find that the mass difference of the diquark masses is insensitive to the Gk parameter. This means that the flavor SU(3) breaking in the diquark mass is still kept even when the constituent quark masses become degenerate. This is because the loop functions for the scalar diquarks have the same form as those for the pseudoscalar mesons. Because the model parameters are determined so as to reproduce the masses of the pion and kaon, the flavor SU(3) breaking is kept in the pseudoscalar sector; this is also the case for the scalar diquark. This means that the flavor symmetry breaking of the diquark masses stems from the current quark masses, like for the Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons, instead of the constituent quark masses. This symmetry breaking may propagate to the light baryon masses. In this way, the flavor SU(3) breaking in the NJL model might be different from the constituent quark models.\n4.2. Gell-Mann\u2013Oakes\u2013Renner relation By introducing the anomaly induced interaction with the current quark mass into the model, the symmetry breaking pattern in this model is somewhat different from that in the original theory. The divergence of the axial vector current Aa\u03bc = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03b35 \u03bb a\n2 \u03c8 can be calculated by the Noether theorem:\n\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bc = \u2212i[LNJL, QaA], (26) where QaA is the generator of the axial transformation labeled by a. In the current model, the divergence of the third component of the axial vector current A3\u03bc is calculated as\n\u2202\u03bcA3\u03bc = mqP3 \u2212 gkmq ( P3 s\u0304s + S3 s\u0304i\u03b35s \u2212 s\u0304i\u03b35u u\u0304s \u2212 u\u0304i\u03b35s s\u0304u + s\u0304i\u03b35d d\u0304s + d\u0304 i\u03b35d s\u0304d ) , (27)\nwhere the pseudoscalar and scalar fields, Pa and Sa, are defined as Pa = \u03c8\u0304 i\u03b35\u03bba\u03c8 and Sa = \u03c8\u0304\u03bba\u03c8 , respectively. This is the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) relation in this model, and it is different from that of QCD due to the presence of the gk term.\nThe Gell-Mann\u2013Oakes\u2013Renner (GOR) relation [65] is derived by combining the Glashow\u2013 Weinberg relation [66] and the PCAC relation (see, e.g., Ref. [67]). The Glashow\u2013Weinberg relation is a relation in the chiral limit and reads, for the massless pion,\nF\u03c0G\u03c0 = \u22122\u3008q\u0304q\u3009, (28) with the matrix elements defined by\n\u30080|Aa\u03bc(x)|\u03c0b(p)\u3009 = i\u03b4abp\u03bcF\u03c0e\u2212ip\u00b7x, (29)\n\u30080|Pa(x)|\u03c0b(p)\u3009 = \u03b4abG\u03c0e\u2212ip\u00b7x. (30) Taking the derivative of Eq. (29), we obtain, on one hand,\n\u30080|\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bc(x)|\u03c0b(p)\u3009 = \u03b4abm2\u03c0F\u03c0e\u2212ip\u00b7x, (31)\n13/18\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2023/3/033D 01/7055963 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nwhere the on-shell condition p2 = m2\u03c0 is taken for the pion. On the other hand, taking the matrix element for the vacuum and the pion of the PCAC relation (27), we obtain \u30080|\u2202\u03bcA3\u03bc(x)|\u03c00(p)\u3009 = mqG\u03c0 (1 \u2212 gk\u3008s\u0304s\u3009)e\u2212ip\u00b7x (32) for \u03c00. Thus, from the PCAC relation we obtain m2\u03c0F\u03c0 = mqG\u03c0 (1 \u2212 gk\u3008s\u0304s\u3009). (33) Eliminating G\u03c0 from Eqs. (28) and (33), we obtain the Gell-Mann\u2013Oakes\u2013Renner relation for this model as\nm2\u03c0F 2 \u03c0 = \u22122mq\u3008q\u0304q\u3009(1 \u2212 gk\u3008s\u0304s\u3009). (34) Taking gk = 0, one sees that the original form of the GOR relation is recovered. In the numerical calculations given in Sect. 3, the GOR relation (34) is satisfied with more than 99% precision, which is estimated by the ratio of the left-hand side to the right-hand side of Eq. (34) with the values obtained in our calculation.\nActually, Eq. (34) is consistent with the GOR relation in QCD. The current model is an effective model of QCD at low energy. According to the idea of the effective field theory, one presumes that the partition functions Z[v, a, s, p] defined through the path integral form with external fields s, a, s, p should have common symmetry properties and should be shared by the original theory and the effective theory at low energy:\nZ[v, a, s, p] = \u222b DqDq\u0304DG\u03bcei \u222b d4xLQCD[v,a,s,p] = \u222b D\u03c8D\u03c8\u0304ei \u222b d4xLNJL[v,a,s,p]. (35)\nIn this formulation, the quark condensate is obtained by\n\u3008 |q\u0304q| \u3009 = \u2212i 1 Z[0] \u03b4Z \u03b4s \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 s=mq,v=a=p=0 . (36)\nCalculating the above functional derivative for both theories in the mean field approximation, we obtain \u3008q\u0304q\u3009QCD = \u3008q\u0304q\u3009(1 \u2212 gk\u3008s\u0304s\u3009), (37) where the left-hand side denotes the quark condensate for QCD. This means that the mean fields in the current model may different from those in QCD. Combining Eqs. (34) and (37), one restores the original GOR relation for QCD. Equation (37) corresponds to Eq. (15) of Ref. [22], which was obtained in the linear sigma model."

Motivated by the previous work on scalar meson masses in a linear \u03c3 model [22], we have introduced an axial anomaly induced interaction containing the current quark mass. Without this term, the q\u0304q scalar meson spectrum has an inconsistent ordering with observation in which the \u03ba meson with strangeness is heavier than the a0 meson with isospin I = 1. The anomaly induced interaction with the current quark mass gives repulsion to the quark and antiquark systems for the flavor-octet scalar channels, and it comes to the a0 meson with a sizable strange current quark mass, and to the \u03ba meson with a tiny up or down current quark mass. This different influence induces the reversal of the mass order between the a0 and \u03ba mesons. By fixing the model parameters to reproduce the masses of the pion, kaon, and \u03b7\u2032 meson and the pion decay constant, we have calculated the scalar meson masses.

Thus, the inverse mass ordering is realized even in the q\u0304q configuration for the scalar meson. It is also interesting to mention that this model suggests that the constituent quark masses become degenerate for Gk 2.0. This might be inconsistent with the baryon mass spectra in which one sees substantial flavor SU(3) breaking. By calculating the scalar diquark masses in the current model, we have found that the scalar diquark masses still have substantial flavor breaking even if the constituent quark masses become degenerate. Therefore, if the baryons have a considerably large amount of the diquark component in their structure, the baryon masses still have enough flavor breaking even if the constituent quark masses become degenerate.\nIn conclusion, by introducing the U(1) axial anomaly term with the current quark mass, it is possible to realize the inverse mass ordering of the light scalar meson even in the q\u0304q picture. This fact would suggest that the f0(500) meson could be the chiral partner of the pion or at least should have a substantial component of the chiral partner."
