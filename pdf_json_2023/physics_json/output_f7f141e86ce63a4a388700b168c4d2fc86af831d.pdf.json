    "abstractText": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a worldwide concern among infectious diseases due to increased mortality, morbidity and treatment cost. According to WHO 2019 report, among the 32 antibiotics in the clinical trials, only six were classified as innovative and containing novel moiety. The remaining antibiotics from this list contain previously known moiety (WHO AMR 2019). Therefore, the development of novel antibiotics to control resistance problems is crucial. Benzothiazole derivatives are of great interest due to their wide range of biological activities and medicinal applications. Reported data indicated that benzothiazole derivatives displayed antibacterial activity by inhibiting the dihydroorotase, DNA gyrase, uridine diphosphate-n-acetyl enol pyruvyl glucosamine reductase (MurB), peptide deformylase, aldose reductase, casdihydrofolate reductase, enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase, dialkylglycine decarboxylase, dehydrosqualene synthase, dihydropteroate synthase and tyrosine kinase. The present review analyzed the synthesis, structure-activity relationship (SAR) and mechanism of action studies of benzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents reported by various research groups in the last five years (2018\u20132022). Different patents on the antimicrobial activity of benzothiazole derivatives have also been summarized. The finding of the present review will be beneficial for the researchers in the development of novel antibacterial molecules based on benzothiazole moiety.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR) withholds a pressing global challenge to the healthcare system in the expression of morbidity, mortality, and economic freight [1]. Predominantly, the speedy global spreading of multidrugresistant bacteria (superbugs) causes non-treatable infections with existing antibiotics (WHO AMR 2015), which is a frightening challenge [2]. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asserted that in the USA 23,000 deaths occur annually due to antimicrobial drug resistance and could be enhanced by millions in the coming eternity [3]. According to WHO 2019 report, among the 32 antibiotics in the clinical trials, only six were classified as innovative and containing novel moiety. The remaining antibiotics from this list contain previously known moiety [4]. Therefore,\ndeveloping new antibiotics to manage AMR problem is vital. Among the various antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, modification in the molecular targets is one of the key mechanisms. The development of effective antimicrobial drug molecules is a challenging task due to the modification in the exploited molecular targets. Therefore, the discovery of novel unexploited targets is becoming a major path for researchers to prevent antibiotic resistance [5].\nBenzothiazole is a bicyclic heterocyclic compound containing a 5-membered 1,3-thiazole ring fused with a benzene ring [6]. Their wide range of various biological activities is associated with the nature and positions of different substituents. A review of the literature concluded that different heteroaryl substitutions at the 2nd, 5th and 6th positions of benzothiazole moiety are very flexible in attaining diverse activities. Benzothiazole derivatives showed antimicrobial [7\u20139], anti-inflammatory [10, 11], antitumor [12, 13], anti-tubercular [14, 15], anti-HIV [16], anti-malarial [17\u201319], anticonvulsant [20], anti-helminthic [21, 22], anti-oxidant [23, 24] and analgesic activities [25, 26]. Ethoxzolamide, benzothiazol-2-ylthiomethyl thiocynate (TCMTB) and dimazole are the clinically approved antimicrobial drugs having benzothiazole moiety (Fig. 1) [27, 28].\nAccording to reported evidence, benzothiazole derivatives displayed a variety of antibacterial activities by inhibiting the dihydroorotase [29], DNA gyrase [30, 31], uridine diphosphate-n-acetyl enol pyruvyl glucosamine reductase (MurB) [32], peptide deformylase [33, 34], aldose reductase [35, 36], dihydrofolate reductase [37\u201339], enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase [40], casdihydrofolate reductase [41], dialkyl glycine decarboxylase [42, 43], dehydrosqualene synthase [44], dihydropteroate synthase [45] and tyrosine kinase [46, 47] (Fig. 2).\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents via uridine diphosphate-n-acetyl enol pyruvyl glucosamine reductase (MurB) inhibition\nMaliyappa et al. (2022) synthesized antipyrine containing 6-substituted benzothiazole-based azo dyes and evaluated their antibacterial action (Scheme 1). Between the studied compounds, 4b depicted equipotent antibacterial activity in comparison to the standard drug streptomycin\n(MIC= 25\u201350 \u03bcg/ml) against Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumonia. SAR study indicated that the presence of chloro group (4b) at the 5th location of the benzothiazole ring increased the antibacterial activity. The docking study depicted that compound 4a displayed the highest interaction (binding energy=\u2212263.28 kcal/mol) with the target site of MurB enzyme (Fig. 2) and interaction\nwas found to be significant as compared to standard drug streptomycin (Binding score=\u2212289.65 kcal/mol) [32].\nTratrat et al. (2022) synthesized thiazolidin-4-one derivatives of benzothiazole as antibacterial agents (Scheme 2). Results showed that among the studied compounds, 8a, 8b, 8c and 8d were found to be the most active (MIC= 0.09\u20130.18 mg/ml) having comparable activity as\nFig. 2 Different antibacterial targets of benzothiazole derivatives [29\u201347, 100]\nstandard drugs streptomycin (MIC= 0.05\u20130.1 mg/ml) and ampicillin (MIC= 0.2 mg/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. SAR study indicated that the substitution of nitro (8a and 8c) and methoxy groups (8b and 8d) at the 4th position of the phenyl ring improved the antibacterial action. Docking analysis depicted that compounds 8a (binding energy= 10.21 kcal/mol) and 8d (binding energy= 10.08 kcal/mol) created the most stable complex with E. coli MurB enzyme [48].\nHaroun et al. (2021) synthesized and performed molecular docking of thiazolidinone derivatives of 2-aryl-3-(6-trifluoromethoxy) benzothiazole as an anti-bacterial agent (Scheme 3). Among the studied compounds, 11a and 11b\nexerted maximum antibacterial activity. Compound 11a indicated comparable activity (MIC= 0.10\u20130.25mg/ml) to the standard drug streptomycin (MIC= 0.15mg/ml) towards Listeria monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 11b showed equivalent activity (MIC= 0.15mg/ml) as reference compound against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes. SARs emphasized that the existence of 2,3-dichloro (11a) and 2,4-dichloro phenyl moieties (11b) linked with thiazole ring amplified the antibacterial activity. The molecular docking study depicted that the compound (11a) with a maximum in vitro activity showed the highest interaction (docking score=\u221210.74 kcal/mol) with the targeted enzyme E. coli MurB (Fig. 2) and formed the most stable\nScheme 2 The chemical reaction for the synthesis of thiazolidin-4-one derivatives of benzothiazole analogues (8a-d)\nScheme 3 Synthesis of thiazolidinone substituted of 2-aryl-3-(6-trifluoromethoxy) benzothiazole derivatives (11a-b)\nScheme 1 The chemical reaction involved in the synthesis of azo dyes based benzothiazole analogues (4a, b)\ncomplex among the studied derivatives. The fluoro atoms of the trifluoromethoxy moiety are involved in two hydrogen bonds with ARG A:326 and SER A:115 amino acid residues of the targeted enzyme. The keto group present on the 2nd position of the thiazole ring also formed H- bond with SER A:228 amino acid. The chloro atom on the phenyl ring (11a) interacted with PRO A:110 residue through carbon-hydrogen bond. Whereas, in compound 11b chloro group present on the para-position of the phenyl ring interacted with ALA A:123 through an alkyl bond [49].\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents via DNA gyrase inhibition\nNehra et al. (2021) synthesized hybrids of 2- or 4-hydroxyphenyl benzothiazole derivatives and naphthalen1-ol/8-hydroxyquinoline moieties linked through triazole\nring and evaluated their antibacterial activity (Scheme 4). Compound 15 was found to be the most active (ZOI= 15.5\u201317.6 mm) out of the studied compounds, however less than reference molecule ciprofloxacin (ZOI= 22.3\u201324.1 mm) against all tested bacterial strains. SAR study illustrated that the substitution of the 8-hydroxyquinoline moiety at benzothiazole improved the antibacterial activity more than naphthalen-1-ol moiety. Substitution of ethyl aliphatic side chain (15) with triazole ring boosted the antibacterial activity. The docking study indicated that the compound with maximum activity also showed the highest interaction (binding affinity=\u22128.7 kcal mol\u22121) with targeted DNA gyrase B dodecamer. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms of 8-hydroxyquinoline interacted with DG2 through H-bonds, whereas the nitrogen atom of triazole formed H-bonds with DG4 [50].\nScheme 4 Synthesis of naphthalen-1-ol and 8-hydroxyquinoline containing benzothiazole derivative (15)\nScheme 5 The chemical reaction involved in the synthesis of carboxamide containing benzothiazole analogues (19a-b)\nSkok et al. (2020) evaluated the antibacterial activity of benzothiazole derivatives as DNA gyraseB inhibitors (Scheme 5). Results showed that compounds 19a and 19b depicted the highest inhibition (MIC= 3.13 \u03bcM) among the screened derivatives and similar to the reference drug ciprofloxacin (MIC= 3.03 \u03bcM) against\nEnterococcus faecalis. DNA gyrase inhibition assay study indicated that 19a showed potent inhibition (IC50 = 9.5 nM) against DNA gyrase enzyme (Fig. 2). SARs deduced that acetamide and Boc-glycin moieties at the 5th position of the benzothiazole ring improved the antibacterial action [30].\nScheme 6 Synthesis of 2-arylbenzothiazole derivatives (25a-c)\nScheme 7 Synthesis of azo clubbed benzothiazole derivative (31)\nGhannam et al. (2019) synthesized 2-arylbenzothiazole analogues and assessed their antibacterial potency (Scheme 6). Between the studied benzothiazole analogues, 25a, 25b and 25c (MIC= ~ 1 \u00b5M) showed excellent antibacterial activity in comparison with reference drug ciprofloxacin (MIC= 2.93 \u00b5M) against E. faecalis. Further, the studied compounds 25a (MIC= 2.03 \u00b5M), 25b (MIC= 1.04 \u00b5M) and 25c (MIC= 1.04 \u00b5M) showed good activity in comparison to the reference drug (MIC= 2.93 \u00b5M) against K. pneumoniae. SAR study indicated that the substitution of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy (25a), 4-hydroxy (25b) and 3-hydroxy (25c) groups on the benzylidene moiety attached via hydrazine group increased the antibacterial activity. DNA gyrase inhibition assay demonstrated that among the studied compounds, 25a depicted the highest inhibitory action (IC50= 4.85 \u03bcM) against the DNA\ngyrase enzyme (Fig. 2). However, activity was fewer than the reference drug ciprofloxacin (IC50= 1.14 \u00b5M). Molecular docking study assessed that compound 25a has the maximum interaction (binding energy=\u221216.17 kcal/mol) with the targeted enzyme among the studied derivatives [51].\nGhanavatkar et al. (2019) synthesized azo clubbed benzothiazole analogues and evaluated their antibacterial activity (Scheme 7). All the studied compounds showed very poor antibacterial activity (MIC= 312.5\u20131250 \u03bcg/ml) as compared to the reference drug ciprofloxacin (MIC= 50\u201325 \u03bcg/ml) against S. aureus and E. coli. Molecular docking study demonstrated that compound 31 formed the most stable complex (binding affinity=\u22127.353 kcal/ mol) with DNA gyrase enzyme [52].\nVenkatesh et al. (2018) synthesized novel pyrimidine benzothiazole derivatives and studied their antibacterial\nScheme 8 Synthesis of novel pyrimidine containing benzthiazole derivatives (35a-h)\nScheme 9 Synthesis of benzothiazole-based thiazolidinones derivatives (38a-b)\nScheme 10 Synthesis of isatin containing benzothiazole derivatives (41a-c)\nactivity (Scheme 8). Results showed that compounds 35d, 35e and 35 g depicted potent antibacterial action (ZOI= 17\u201319 mm) as compared to reference drug ciprofloxacin (ZOI= 14 mm) against S. aureus. Compound 35c indicated better inhibitory action (ZOI= 18 mm) between the evaluated derivatives and equipotent to the standard drug (ZOI= 16 mm) against Salmonella typhi. Compounds 35b, 35d and 35 h displayed equipotent activity (ZOI= 18 mm) as standard drug against E. coli. SAR study depicted that the substitution of 3-nitro (35a), 2,6-difluoro (35d), 4-hydroxy (35e) and 4-chloro (35 f) groups at the 4th position of the phenyl ring enhanced the antibacterial activity. Substitution of the halogen group at the benzothiazole moiety enhanced the activity. The most active compounds also displayed good receptor binding affinity (binding energy=\u22125.9 kcal/mol, \u22125.6 kcal/mol and \u22125.5 kcal/mol respectively) with target enzyme DNA gyrase in the docking study [53].\nHaroun et al. (2018) synthesized benzothiazole-based thiazolidinones compounds and assessed their antibacterial action (Scheme 9). Between the studied compounds 38a and 38b (MIC= 0.18\u20134.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcmol/ml) showed better antibacterial action as compared to reference drug ampicillin (MIC= 24.80\u201374.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcmol/ml) and streptomycin (MIC= 4.3\u201325 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcmol/ml) against all the tested strains. SAR analysis revealed that unsubstitution (38a) and replacement of chloro group (38b) at the 3rd position of the\nphenyl ring enhanced the activity. Docking study showed that compounds 38a and 38b have maximum interaction (docking score=\u22129.0 kcal/mol) and formed a stable complex with targeted DNA gyrase B enzyme. The nitrogen atom of the intermediate chain and the hydrogen atom of the side chain formed hydrogen bond interactions with Thr165 (distance 3.01 \u00c5). The keto group present in the thiazole ring also formed H-bond with Asn46 (distance 2.53 \u00c5) [54].\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents via peptide deformylase inhibition\nMishra et al. (2020) screened benzothiazole derivatives of isatin as antibacterial compounds (Scheme 10). The analysis of results displayed that benzothiazole clubbed isatin derivatives showed better antibacterial activity against Gramnegative bacterial strains rather than Gram-positive stains. Among the studied compounds, 41c indicated excellent antibacterial activity against E. coli (MIC= 3.1 \u03bcg/ml) and P. aeruginosa (MIC= 6.2 \u03bcg/ml), even more than reference drug ciprofloxacin (MIC= 12.5 \u03bcg/ml). Compound 41c also depicted equipotent activity (MIC= 12.5 \u03bcg/ml) as standard drug against Bacillus cereus and S. aureus. Compounds 41a and 41b depicted significant inhibition action (MIC= 6.2 \u03bcg/ml) in comparison to the reference drug ciprofloxacin (MIC= 12.5 \u03bcg/ml) against E. coli. SAR study assessed that the placement of the bromo group (41c)\nScheme 11 Synthesis of substituted 2-(imino) phenol clubbed benzothiazole Schiff analogues (46a-b)\nat the 5th position of the isatin ring enhanced the antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacterial strains. Moreover, a molecular modeling study revealed that compound 41c has the highest interaction with the target enzyme peptide deformylase [55].\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents via aldose reductase inhibitions\nKousaxidis et al. (2021) developed the non-acidic bifunctional benzothiazole-based thiazolidinones derivatives and assessed their antibacterial potency via aldose reductase inhibition assay (Fig. 2). Between the studied compounds, 42 depicted the highest aldose reductase inhibition (IC50= 3.99 \u03bcM). SARs demonstrated that the presence of the chloro group at the 4th position of the benzylidene moiety improved the activity against tested strains and boosted the aldose reductase enzyme inhibition. Moreover, molecular docking analysis indicated that compound 42 also formed a stable complex (binding affinity=\u22127.34 kcal/mol) with the target site [56].\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents via dihydroorotase inhibition\nMorsy et al. (2020) performed in silico study and antimicrobial evaluation of benzothiazole derivatives. Compounds 43a and 43b displayed maximum inhibition (ZOI= 21\u201327 mm) against S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis and E. coli and activity was found to be better as compared to standard drug kanamycin (ZOI= 28\u201331 mm). SAR study demonstrated that the substitution of methyl (43a) and bromo (43b) groups at the 7th position of the benzothiazole\nring enhanced the antibacterial action. Further, the substitution of hydroxy (43a) and nitro (43b) groups on phenyl moiety enhanced their antibacterial action. In silico study indicated that compound 43a has the highest interaction (docking score=\u22125.02 kcal/mol) with targeted dihydroorotase enzyme (Fig. 2), however, the interaction was less in comparison to reference compound HDDP (docking score=\u22127.37 kcal/mol) [29].\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents via casdihydrofolate reductase inhibition\nSuyambulingam et al. (2020) prepared amino-benzothiazole Schiff base analogues and evaluated their antibacterial activity (Scheme 11). Between the studied derivatives 46a and 46b were found to be the most active and exhibited equipotent antibacterial activity (MIC= 15.62 \u03bcg/ml) as compared to standard drug ciprofloxacin against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. SAR study indicated that the substitution of the hydroxyl group at the 2nd position of the benzylidene ring improved their antibacterial action. Docking study depicted that compound 46a (binding energy=\u22124.36 kcal/mol) and compound 46b (binding energy=\u22124.78 kcal/mol) formed the most stable complexes with E. coli and Lactobacillus casdihydrofolate reductase enzyme (Fig. 2). The OH group was found to be involved in the creation of hydrogen bond with the Tyr 100 residue of the targeted enzyme [41].\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents via enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase inhibition\nBhoi et al. (2019) synthesized isoniazid containing 4H-pyrimido[2,1-b] benzothiazoles derivatives as antibacterial agents\nScheme 12 Synthesis of isoniazid containing 4H-pyrimido[2,1-b] benzothiazoles derivatives (53a-d)\n(Scheme 12). Among the studied compounds, 53a (ZOI= 25 \u00b1 1.115mm) and 53d (ZOI= 23 \u00b1 1.112mm) displayed excellent antibacterial activity and similar to reference drug streptomycin (ZOI= 24mm) against Enterobacter aerogenes. Compound 53c (ZOI= 24mm) indicated equipotent activity as compared to the standard drug against E. coli and B. cereus. SARs demonstrated that the substitution of 4-ethoxy (53a), 4-trifluoro methoxy (53b), 4-hydroxy (53c) and 2-methoxy (53d) groups at the benzothiazole ring improved the activity. Docking study indicated that compound 53b formed the most stable complex (binding energy=\u22129.077 kcal/mol) with targeted enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme (Fig. 2), among the studied compounds. Compound 53b formed four hydrogen bond interactions with Thr164, Thr164, His208, and Thr304 through -NH atoms of side chain of pyrimidine and pyridine rings [57].\nBenzothiazole derivatives as antibacterial agents via dialkylglycine decarboxylase inhibition\nMishra et al. (2019) synthesized Schiff base containing benzothiazole derivatives and evaluated their antibacterial activity (Scheme 13).

Among the studied compounds, 78a, 78b, and 80b were found to be most active. Compound 78a depicted better inhibition against Gram-positive bacterial strains (MIC= 8 \u00b5mol L\u22121 against S. aureus and MIC= 4 \u00b5mol L\u20131 against Streptococcus pneumonia) than Gram-negative bacterial strains and activity was higher than standard drug cefotaxime (MIC= 6\u201310 \u00b5mol L\u20131).

The electronwithdrawing and electron releasing groups at the 5th and 6th positions of benzothiazole ring enhanced the antibacterial activity. In general, substitution of halogen groups viz, F, Cl and Br at the 5th position of benzothiazole ring significantly enhanced the antibacterial activity. Analysis of various mechanism of action studies showed that different aryl and heteroaryl substitutions at the 2nd position of benzothiazole ring formed most stable complexes with their\ntarget proteins/enzymes.
