 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Explore different aggregation methods for combining the local and neighbor activity predictions beyond just a simple mean. For example, weighted averages could give more influence to certain trusted neighbors, or clustering methods could identify subgroups with correlated activities.

2. Investigate how to dynamically adjust the frequency of sharing activity predictions between devices based on factors like the rate of activity change or neighbor set changes. This could optimize the tradeoff between communication overhead and recognition accuracy. 

3. Collect larger real-world datasets with more participants, activities, and diversity to further validate the approach. Larger datasets could also enable training more complex models.

4. Study methods to handle imperfect communication like lost or delayed messages. This could involve tracking neighbor reliability or using prediction histories to fill gaps.

5. Extend the approach to recognize group activities where individuals perform different personal activities that contribute to a joint group goal. New techniques would be needed to model the relationships between personal and group activities.
