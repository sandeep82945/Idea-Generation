    "abstractText": "The unique contribution of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), intronic region 2 (STin2), and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) genes to individual differences in personality traits has been widely explored, and research has shown that certain forms of these polymorphisms relate to impulsivity and impulsivity-related disorders. Humans showing these traits are also described as having an asymmetrical prefrontal cortical activity when compared to others. In this explorative study, we examine the relationship between serotonergic neurotransmission polymorphisms, cortical activity features (prefrontal alpha asymmetry, individual alpha peak frequency [iAPF]), emotion-related and non-emotion-related impulsivity in humans. 5-HTTLPR, MAO-A, and STin2 polymorphisms were assessed in blood taken from 91 participants with high emotion-related impulsivity levels. Sixty-seven participants completed resting electroencephalography and a more comprehensive impulsivity index. In univariate analyses, iAPF correlated with both forms of emotion-related impulsivity. In multiple linear regression models, 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (model 1, adj. R2 = 15.2%) and iAPF were significant interacting predictors of emotion-related impulsivity, explaining a large share of the results\u2019 variance (model 2, adj. R2 = 21.2%). Carriers of the low transcriptional activity 5-HTTPLR and MAO-A phenotypes obtained higher emotion-related impulsivity scores than others did. No significant results were detected for non-emotion-related impulsivity or for a form of emotionrelated impulsivity involving cognitive/motivational reactivity to emotion. Our findings support an endophenotypic approach to impulsivity, showing that tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, iAPF, and their interaction are relevant predictors of one form of emotion-related impulsivity.",

            "text": "Impulsivity is a multidimensional personality construct associated with a wide range of psychological disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder, suicide) [1\u20135]. While older impulsivity definitions tended to focus on problems with planning, deliberation, and attention [6, 7], newer research reports the importance of impulsivity in response to states of high positive or negative emotions [2, 8, 9]. Emotion-related impulsivity has been defined as the reflexive tendency to act impulsively during periods of heightened emotion [9]. A large body of work shows that emotion-related impulsivity is more robustly tied to psychopathologies, aggression, and suicide than are other forms of impulsivity [10, 11]. * Florian Javelle f.javelle@dshs-koeln.de 1 Clinical Exercise-NeuroImmunology Group, Department for\u00a0Molecular and\u00a0Cellular Sports Medicine, Institute for\u00a0Cardiovascular Research and\u00a0Sports Medicine, German Sport University Cologne, Cologne, Germany 2 Experimental Psychology Unit, Helmut Schmidt University/University of\u00a0the\u00a0Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany 3 Department of\u00a0Psychology, University of\u00a0California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA 4 Division of\u00a0Performance and\u00a0Health (Sports Medicine), Institute for\u00a0Sport and\u00a0Sport Science, Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany\n1 3\nSerotonergic neurotransmission modulates mood and emotion [12, 13], consequently affecting a wide spectrum of impulsivity-related traits. Two key regulators of serotonergic signaling are the\u00a0serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and the\u00a0monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), which respectively\u00a0remove serotonin from the synaptic cleft and catabolize monoamines with a strong affinity for serotonin and catecholamines [13\u201315]. The 5-HTT protein is encoded by the gene SLC6A4, whose transcriptional activity is modulated by several variations, including two repetitive sequences called the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and the serotonin transporter intronic region 2 (STin2) variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) [16]. Likewise, the MAO-A gene has a VNTR polymorphism modulating its transcription. Transcriptional activity levels in each of these monoamine genes result in different expression rates of their respective mRNA and subsequent proteins and can therefore be classified in phenotypic categories (Fig.\u00a01) [14, 15, 17, 18]. These phenotypic distinctions are also related to some psychological traits, especially impulsivity [14, 15].\nMore specifically, these polymorphisms have been associated with impulsivity and impulsivity-related disorders. For example, impulsivity [9], neuroticism [14], anxiety [19], and emotional instability [14] are more frequent in people having the low 5-HTTLPR\u00a0transcriptional activity\u00a0(5-HTTLPRLow) phenotype. The shortest repetitive sequences of STin2 are associated with elevated cognitive impulsivity [20], anxiety scores [21], major depressive disorders [22], early-onset bipolar disorder [23], and suicide attempts [24]. Finally, MAO-A phenotypes are linked to antisocial behaviors [15], emotional instability [25], impulsivity [26], bipolar disorders [27], and violent aggression [28].\nAttempts to understand the neurogenetic basis of impulsivity have been limited by the relative absence of attention to the multidimensional nature of impulsivity. One previous study suggested that emotion-related impulsivity, but not non-emotion-related impulsivity, was tied to 5-HTTLPR [9]. Therefore, the aim of this explorative study was to evaluate serotonergic genetic markers while differentiating between emotion-related and non-emotion-related impulsivity.\nBeyond these genetic markers, we consider other stable genetically modulated variables to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the determinants of impulsivity. Cortical activity, including lateralization of frontal oscillations in the alpha frequency band, is a partially genetically modulated parameter sometimes found to be associated with genetic polymorphisms such as the 5-HTTLPRLow phenotype [29]. For more than 50\u00a0years, research has demonstrated that frontocortical regions are asymmetrically related to motivational and emotional variables, such as approach and avoidance tendencies: heightened relative activity in the left frontal cortex is related to approach motivation, whereas heightened relative activity in the right frontal cortex is\nrelated to avoidance motivation [30\u201333]. Impulsivity (in particular, its urgency and positive urgency dimensions) can be depicted as the inability to inhibit approach urges [34, 35]. Drawing on these findings, multiple investigators have shown that greater left prefrontal activity during rest (i.e., a right-sided predominance of alpha power as alpha oscillations are inversely related to cortical activity [36]) is associated with impulsivity [37\u201339].\nThere is reason to believe that emotion-related impulsivity may be more closely tied to lateralization indices than non-emotion-related impulsivity is. High emotional instability has frequently been associated with lateralization of the frontal alpha activity [29, 37\u201340]. Regions of the left prefrontal cortex are believed to play an important role in inhibiting the amygdala [41, 42], and their activation leads to downregulation of the amygdala when participants are asked to downregulate negative affect [43, 44]. Accordingly, we hypothesize that persons exhibiting highly impulsive responses to emotion may show stronger right alpha prefrontal activity than others.\nOther cortical activity characteristics, such as individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF), are highly heritable, appear to be under substantial genetic control [45\u201347], and show high stability over test\u2013retest intervals in healthy and clinical conditions [48, 49]. Given this, iAPF is considered to be a valuable marker for understanding psychological traits [50]. Furthermore, seminal research has already shown that alpha power and alpha peak frequency were higher in highly impulsive individuals when compared to low impulsive individuals [51]. Compared to the alpha power, the iAPF has more robust heritability estimates and better test\u2013retest reliability [48, 52].\nThus,\u00a0in the current study, we used an endophenotypic approach, combining genetic and cortical features to better understand the\u00a0mechanisms underlying emotion-related impulsivity. Serotonergic neurotransmission polymorphisms (i.e., 5-HTTLPR, STin2, and MAO-A), prefrontal alpha asymmetry, and iAPF were assessed in emotionally impulsive humans. We hypothesized that the\u00a0low transcriptional activity\u00a0phenotypes in serotonergic\u00a0neurotransmission polymorphisms and high right prefrontal alpha asymmetry would relate to higher emotion-related impulsivity. According to seminal research, the iAPF should be higher in highly impulsive individuals when compared to others."

Items are rated from 1 (\u201cI strongly disagree\u201d) to 5 (\u201cI strongly agree\u201d), with higher scores reflecting higher impulsivity levels. The questionnaire covers eight different components of impulsivity shown in oblique factor analyses and confirmatory structural equation\n1 3\nmodeling to load onto three separate factors [9, 57]: Pervasive Influence of Feelings, (lack of) Follow-Through, and Feelings Trigger Action; alphas = 0.837, 0.897, and\n0.857, respectively. The first and the third factors are emotion-related. Factor one, Pervasive Influence of Feelings, reflects unconstrained cognitive and motivational responses\n1 3\nto negative emotions and includes items from previously validated scales for negative generalization [58], negative urgency [8], and novel items to capture lethargy in response to sadness and extremely negative thoughts of self and the world in response to emotions. Factor two, (lack of) FollowThrough, includes items from previously validated scales designed to cover distractibility and lack of perseverance [8]. The third factor, Feelings Trigger Action, which was used for screening, includes items from the previously validated scales of Negative Urgency [8], Positive Urgency [59], and items to capture responding reflexively and quickly when experiencing emotions. The German validated version of the questionnaire was used [60].

First, power line noise at 50\u00a0Hz and its respective harmonics was attenuated by notch filters (overlap-add finite impulse response filtering). Then, the data were re-referenced to the average reference. Bad channels were detected automatically using the noisy channel detection algorithm of pyprep (per deviation; threshold = 5z) [62] and via visual inspection. If bad channels were\ndetected, they were subsequently removed, and data were interpolated using spherical splines as long as three original neighboring signals were available for interpolation. Muscle artifacts were automatically detected and annotated within the continuous raw data using the MNE annotate_muscle_zscore method. Then, the raw data were filtered with a 1-Hz high-pass and 40-Hz low-pass filter (both overlap-add finite impulse response filtering). Power spectra density was computed by Welch\u2019s method using 1-s segments with 50% overlap. Segments containing previously annotated muscle artifacts and a peak-to-peak amplitude exceeding 200\u00a0\u00b5V in any channel were rejected. On average across participants, 533 \u00b1 47 quality-sufficient epochs were used in the analysis.\nScientific literature provides a spectrum of studies linking impulsivity to different frontal cortex regions, e.g., [31\u201333, 37, 39, 63\u201365]. Thus, we used a comprehensive approach going from the general to the specific. In preliminary analyses, we have first tested the frontal cortex, then the prefrontal cortex, and finally specific pairs of electrodes from the prefrontal region often used in asymmetry literature: Fp2/Fp1, F2/F1, F4/F3, and F8/F7 (details in Supplementary Material A). These multiple tests were adjusted using a familywise Bonferroni correction (see \u201cStatistics\u201d section). As suggested in previous research [29], the alpha asymmetry was indexed using laterality coefficients (LC) using the following formula: LC = (power right \u2013 power left) / (power right + power left) \u00d7 100. Values superior to zero indicate higher alpha activity in the right cortex compared to the left one, in other words, a greater left cortical activity. LC has been used for a long time in the field of laterality because it separates the asymmetry variance from the general magnitude variance [64]. This score is perfectly correlated with another metric commonly reported in EEG studies (ln (right) \u2013 ln (left)) [66]. Nevertheless, using the LC allows easier comparison between different studies, different frequency bands, and locations [67].\nIAPF was estimated from the power spectra densities computed from 1-s non-overlapping segments that were zero-padded to 10\u00a0s to have a frequency resolution of 0.1\u00a0Hz. The iAPF between 8 and 13\u00a0Hz was determined from the mean over 17 posterior electrodes (Pz, P1/2, P3/4, P5/6, P7/8, POz, PO3/4, PO7/8, Oz, and O1/2) [50]."

Data were first z-standardized (for dependant variables and continuous predictors) and then winsorized at \u00b1 3z [68]. The distribution of each variable was evaluated using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and checked for linearity (via quantile\u2013quantile plots and histograms of standardized residuals), skewness, and kurtosis.\n1 3\nPearson\u2019s bivariate correlations were used to evaluate the relationship of EEG markers with impulsivity levels. As the alpha asymmetry was evaluated using six parameters, a Bonferroni alpha correction was applied family-wise by setting the significance level at p < 0.008. All univariate analyses were controlled for age and gender.\nMultiple linear regression models were used to assess how gene phenotypes, individual alpha frequency, and cortical asymmetry LC contributed to impulsivity (continuous scores). The predictors were either categorical (i.e., phenotypes, gender) or continuous (i.e., iAPF, LCs, age) [68]. As the MAO-A gene is located on the X chromosome, and impulsivity can vary with gender, gender was included as a potential predictor. Because impulsivity and iAPF have been shown to change with age, age was included as a predictor [50, 69]. To avoid potential collinearity, we included F4/F3, the most commonly used asymmetry marker, as the only pre-frontal-asymmetry marker. Based on the literature, one can expect interaction between 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms and cortical activity [29]. Thus, these interaction terms were included in the regression models. Missing values were imputed based on the mean when inferior to 10% of the total number of values (F4/F3 LC: 4.5% and iAPF: 8.9%) [70, 71].\nAll predictors were checked for multicollinearity (variance inflation factor and tolerance values were acceptable at < 2 and > 0.2, respectively), independence (Durbin Watson test was acceptable, results ranged from 1 to 3), and linearity (graphically via quantile\u2013quantile plot, scatterplot, and histogram of studentized residuals) [72]. All assumptions for the statistical analysis were met. As models 1 and 2 both assessed Feeling Trigger Action, a Bonferroni alpha correction was applied, bringing the significance level to p < 0.025. For the other parameters, the significance level was set to p < 0.050."

Even though not significant, the interaction term 5-HTTLPRHigh\u00a0/\u00a0iAPF also had a negative beta score suggesting that the positive relation between iAPF and Feeling Trigger Action scores was very likely to be driven by 5-HTTLPRLow phenotypic category.

            "text": "Impulsivity triggered by positive or negative emotions has been shown to be more clinically relevant than other forms unrelated to emotions [73, 74]. Given the evidence that impulsivity is linked not only to serotonergic neurotransmission polymorphisms (i.e., 5-HTTLPR, STin2, and MAO-A) but also to cortical activity (i.e., iAPF and prefrontal alpha asymmetry), this explorative study aimed to assess the conjoint importance of these variables in explaining emotion-related impulsivity. The study examined two forms of emotion-related impulsivity\u2014\u00a0Feelings Trigger Action, which captures tendencies to engage in regrettable behavior in response to emotion, and\u00a0Pervasive Influence of Feelings, which covers unconstrained cognitive/motivational responses to emotions. Both forms of emotion-related impulsivity were linked to higher iAPF. Carriers of MAO-ALow and 5-HTTLPRLow phenotypes had higher Feelings Trigger Action scores. Furthermore, findings of the multiple regression models show that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, iAPF, and their interaction term are significant predictors of Feelings Trigger Action\u00a0scores. Significant effects of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were observed for both administrations\nof the Feelings Trigger Action subscale. These findings support the endophenotypic approach to emotion-related impulsivity.\nIn line with previous research [9], the moderate to large effect sizes detected between Feelings Trigger Action scores and 5-HTTLPR (at screening and T0) and MAO-A (T0) transcriptional activity phenotypes confirm the importance of these polymorphisms in explaining emotion-related impulsivity levels. This fits with the findings from several studies showing\u00a0that carriers of 5-HTTLPRLow and MAOALow phenotypes show hyper-responsivity of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex during the display of negative emotional stimuli [75\u201378]. Even though it would be logical to relate the transcriptional activity levels of these genes to monoamine rates within neurons and synapses, research suggests that this relation is more complex. This reactivity is tied to decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex in the\u00a05-HTTLPRLow , compared with 5-HTTLPRHigh\u00a0phenotype\u00a0carriers [76]. The source of this functional connectivity difference might arise during fetal neurodevelopment, in that 5-HTTLPRLow and MAO-ALow phenotypes have, respectively, fewer 5-HTT and MAO-A mRNA levels in placenta tissue [56]. Therefore, emotion-related impulsivity levels could be driven by fetal monoamine levels affecting structural connectivity, and consequently functional interactions within neural circuits that regulate emotional reactivity.\nWe observed only non-significant trend-level correlations between prefrontal alpha asymmetry and emotion-related impulsivity. Prefrontal alpha asymmetry, though, is influenced not just by trait-like characteristics but also tends to shift in a state-dependent manner, and our current study design did not allow us to consider the state-like dynamic variation. We also did not record handedness preference or state levels of affect and motivation, which can potentially influence asymmetry results. Finally, post hoc power analyses (power > 0.8) suggest that effect sizes below r = 0.260 were probably undetectable.\nDespite the null effect in the correlational analyses for alpha asymmetry, our findings suggest that a form of emotionrelated impulsivity related to regrettable behavior (Feelings Trigger Action) is tied to a set of neural (iAPF) and genetic variables (5-HTTLPR and MAO-A). Intriguingly, results were not generalized to unconstrained cognitive or motivational responses to emotion (Pervasive Influence of Feelings), dovetailing with previous work to suggest the importance of distinguishing between these two factors in understanding neurocognitive correlates and psychopathology.\nUnivariate analyses indicated that the cognitive and behavioral forms of emotion-related impulsivity were both correlated to higher iAPF. These results are counterintuitive when considering research linking decreasing iAPF to central system pathologies [50] and high resting iAPF\n1 3\nto high executive function performances [79]. Nonetheless, it is important to recall that these measurements were obtained from healthy participants without any emotional trigger. Furthermore, regression model 2 (Table\u00a01) did put in evidence a significant interaction between the two predictors (i.e., iAPF and 5-HTTLPR), displaying a very different relationship between iAPF and Feelings Trigger Action scores per 5-HTTLPR phenotypes (Fig.\u00a04). The positive relation depicted in the univariate analysis and in the beta score of iAPF (Table\u00a01, model 2) appeared to be driven by the large effect in the carriers of the 5-HTTPLRLow (n = 19, R2 = 0.330, p < 0.010). These ties were of negligible magnitude for 5-HTTLPRModerate (n = 30, R2 = 0.001, p = 0.900) and 5-HTTLPRHigh (n = 11, R2 = 0.014, p = 0.726). More research investigating the link between 5-HTTLPR and iAPF is warranted. Moreover, 5-HTTLPR should now be considered systematically in iAPF research to have a better understanding of the results.\nDespite the intriguing and novel findings, the results of this study should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. First, even though this study used a multifactorial endophenotypic approach, the scope of the investigation was limited. For example, polymorphisms in the dopaminergic pathway [80, 81], circulating levels of tryptophan [53, 82], central serotonin shortage [83, 84], and activity of the kynurenine pathway [53] have been tied to impulsivity but were not assessed in the present study. Second, the recruited sample had only a modest range of impulsivity scores (the\n35% highest emotion-related impulsivity scores), which may have reduced result variance and constrained effect sizes. Third, even though most research in the field of alpha asymmetry underlying personality traits recommend resting EEG (e.g., [31, 32, 39, 63]), another body of research suggests that this condition might not be the most optimal [65, 85]. They argue that uncontrolled experimental conditions may affect resting measures and that individuals can engage in a variety of mental states that are not controlled during the resting tasks. As we used resting EEG condition, we cannot exclude that these parameters may have affected our results. Including an additional motivational induction paradigm followed by EEG measures [65, 85] in future studies may provide further insights into the relationship between frontal asymmetry and impulsivity. Finally, it is worth noting that future studies might also consider using clinical interviews and behavioral tests (e.g., Go/No-Go test) to gain deeper insights into impulsivity.\nIn conclusion, our results highlight the importance of using endophenotypic approaches to characterize impulsivity, demonstrating that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, iAPF, and their interaction are relevant predictors of a key form of emotion-related impulsivity involving regrettable behavior. Moreover, carriers of 5-HTTPLRLow and MAO-ALow phenotypes showed higher levels of this form of emotionrelated impulsivity than did those with other phenotypes. This multifactorial neurogenetic approach to impulsivity could be applied to developing better identification and\n1 3\nprediction for impulsivity-related disorders. Our findings were specific to emotion-related impulsivity involving regrettable behavior, which is of importance given the burgeoning literature suggesting that this form of impulsivity is uniquely powerful in predicting externalizing, suicidal behavior, and other key outcomes [1]. Evaluating conjoint changes between impulsivity and epigenetic mechanisms in serotonergic neurotransmission polymorphisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone acetylation) represents another rich domain for future work that can be incorporated into endophenotypic approaches.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s12035- 022- 02957-6.\nAcknowledgements The authors want to thank Annika Vo\u00df for her advice regarding the polymorphism analyses and Anke Vogel for help in the recruitment of participants.\nAuthors' Contribution F.J. and P.Z. did the conceptualization of the study.
