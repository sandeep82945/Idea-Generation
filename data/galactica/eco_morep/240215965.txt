Amidst the era of networking, the e-commerce sector has undergone notable expansion, notably with the advent of Cross-border E-commerce (CBEC) in recent times. This growth trend persists, necessitating robust logistical frameworks to sustainably support operations. However, the current e-commerce logistics paradigm faces challenges in meeting evolving user demands, prompting a quest for innovative solutions. This research endeavors to address these complexities by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of CBEC logistics models and integrating embedded technology into logistical frameworks, resulting in the development of an advanced logistics tracking system. Moreover, employing the ant colony algorithm, the study conducts experimental investigations into optimizing logistics package distribution route planning. Noteworthy enhancements are observed in key metrics such as average delivery time, signaling the efficacy of this approach. In essence, this research offers a promising pathway towards optimizing logistics package distribution routes and bolstering package transportation efficiency within the CBEC domain. 1. conclusions The rapid proliferation of e-commerce has precipitated the emergence of Cross-border E-commerce (CBEC), accentuating the crucial interdependence between e-commerce and logistics. With CBEC transactions steadily increasing, existing logistical infrastructures struggle to accommodate the evolving needs of consumers, underscoring the necessity for continuous innovation. To address this challenge, this study conducts an exhaustive examination of the CBEC logistics model while incorporating embedded technology to establish a comprehensive logistics package tracking system. Furthermore, the study employs the ant colony algorithm to evaluate and refine end distribution route planning within the realm of e-commerce logistics. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's notable reductions in logistics package delivery time, thereby optimizing delivery routes.
