1. **Investigate the long-term psychological effects of COVID-19-related treatment delays on breast cancer patients.** This study focused on the immediate psychological impact of treatment delays, but it would be valuable to examine how these effects persist or change over time. A longitudinal study could track breast cancer patients over several months or years to assess how their psychological well-being evolves as they receive treatment and recover from the pandemic.


2. **Explore the role of social support in mitigating the psychological impact of treatment delays.** Social support has been shown to be a protective factor against psychological distress in cancer patients, and it is likely that this is also the case for breast cancer patients experiencing treatment delays due to COVID-19. Future research could examine the specific ways in which social support can help breast cancer patients cope with the challenges of treatment delays and maintain their psychological well-being.


3. **Develop and evaluate interventions to address the psychological needs of breast cancer patients experiencing treatment delays.** The findings of this study suggest that breast cancer patients experiencing treatment delays are at increased risk for psychological distress. Future research could focus on developing and evaluating interventions to address the specific psychological needs of this population. These interventions could include individual therapy, group therapy, or online support groups.


4. **Examine the impact of treatment delays on the physical health of breast cancer patients.** While this study focused on the psychological impact of treatment delays, it is also important to consider the potential physical health consequences. Future research could investigate whether treatment delays are associated with worse cancer outcomes, such as increased risk of recurrence or death.


5. **Compare the psychological impact of treatment delays on breast cancer patients with other types of cancer.** This study focused on breast cancer patients, but it is possible that the psychological impact of treatment delays may differ for patients with other types of cancer. Future research could compare the psychological experiences of breast cancer patients with those of patients with other types of cancer to identify similarities and differences in their experiences.
