Once emitted, the particulate matter derived from BB 40 can be taken up by the oceans. However, the fate and impact of BB in the marine biological carbon pump, and carbon cycle are largely 41 unknown. This work presents the first attempt to investigate the bioavailability of two BB tracers, levoglucosan and galactosan, in seawater 42 inoculated with marine prokaryotes. Levoglucosan and galactosan were incubated with a marine bacterial inoculum and monitored for six 43 weeks under controlled laboratory conditions. Along with the anhydrosugar concentrations, multiple chemical and biological parameters 44 were monitored over time. The results indicate that levoglucosan and galactosan can be assimilated by marine prokaryotes as their 45 concentrations decreased by 97 \u00b1 4% and 36 \u00b1 21% (n = 3) of their initial values. However, this decrease occurred only after a 9 and 15 46 days from the beginning of the experiment, respectively. The decrease in the levoglucosan and galactosan concentrations was 47 accompanied by an increase in both heterotrophic prokaryotic production, and abundance. These results demonstrate that these 48 anhydrosugars have the potential to be assimilated by heterotrophic prokaryotes and thus contribute to the microbial food web 49 functioning. Under our experimental conditions, levoglucosan exhibited a bacterial growth efficiency of 17 \u00b1 5% (n = 3), suggesting that 50 most of the levoglucosan is mineralized into CO2. Prokaryotic diversity analyses revealed the predominance of a few bacterial genera from 51 the Roseobacter clade that were selected after the addition of the anhydrosugars. The presence of this widespread marine bacterial clade 52 reflects its ability to process semilabile compounds (here levoglucosan and galactosan) originating from BB and contribute to the dissolved 53 organic matter pool in surface seawaters. 54\nkeywords: biomass burning, anhydrosugars, marine biological carbon pump, carbon cycle, semilabile dissolver organic matter, 55 Roseobacter clade 56\n3/17"

            "text": "Wildfires, controlled burns, and biofuel combustion (biomass burning, BB) are major contributors to the emission of 58 particulate matter in the atmosphere (up to 90% of primary organic aerosol (Bond et al., 2004) and thus have an impact on 59 climate, human health, and ecosystems. Furthermore, the importance of BB emissions can potentially increase in the future 60 due to the climate change-driven rise in wildfire occurrence in several regions of the world (Dennison et al., 2014; Ponomarev 61 et al., 2021; Sierra-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2022), including the Mediterranean Basin (Durrieu de Madron et al., 2011), and the 62 parallel increase in fire severity in high biomass-containing woody vegetation (Daniau et al., 2012; Nolde et al., 2021; van 63 Wees et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2020). 64 Once emitted, BB particulate matter can be deposited in the terrestrial ecosystem or eventually transported to the ocean. 65 Although previous investigations showed the presence of BB tracers (PAHs and anhydrosugars) in several compartments of 66 aquatic ecosystems including sinking particles (Castro-Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2012; Schreuder et al., 2018; Simoneit and Elias, 2000; 67 Theodosi et al., 2013), concentrated dissolved organic matter (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2013), and sediments (Froehner et al., 68 2010; Guigue et al., 2017; Hopmans et al., 2013; Schreuder et al., 2018; Theodosi et al., 2013) the fate of BB particulate 69 matter in the marine environment is currently unknown, particularly its link with the microbial food web and the biological 70 carbon pump (BCP). Recent investigations have demonstrated that wildfires can potentially trigger phytoplankton blooms 71 (Tang et al., 2021) and modify the composition of their communities (Kramer et al., 2020) pointing to a possible utilization of 72 such substrates by marine planktonic microorganisms. Conversely, the survival and the persistence of these substrates in 73 sediments (Froehner et al., 2010; Hopmans et al., 2013) may imply a slow degradation mechanism in the marine environment 74 which may be compound dependent. The above contrasting results clearly demonstrate that there is a gap in knowledge on 75 the dynamics of BB particulate matter in seawater. 76 Several studies have highlighted the importance of atmospheric nutrient input in oligotrophic regions (Letelier et al., 77 2019; Van Wambeke et al., 2021) whereas incubation experiments comprising organophosphate compounds (Vila-Costa et 78 al., 2019) atmospheric particulate matter (i.e., Saharan dust and anthropogenic aerosols; Djaoudi et al., 2020) and fossil fuel 79 particles (i.e diesel, ship soot; Martinot et al., 2023) have shown an active response by marine heterotrophic prokaryotes. 80 Interestingly, the former study on organophosphate compounds showed that in seawater bacteria (particularly 81 Flavobacteria) exist with a high potential to utilize such organophosphate substrates, while the latter study on atmospheric 82 aerosols highlighted significant differences in the metabolic response of heterotrophic prokaryotes between Saharan dust 83 and anthropogenic aerosol substrates. 84 This work presents the first attempt to investigate the bioavailability of two BB-produced molecules (i.e., levoglucosan 85 and galactosan) in seawater inoculated with marine microorganisms. These anhydrosugars are produced during wildfires 86 and/or BB events and are due to the pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose occurring at temperatures > 300 \u00b0C (levoglucosan 87 represents > 90% of the anhydrosugars). Since cellulose and hemicellulose account for 60 \u2013 80% of the dry weight of wood, 88 levoglucosan is very abundant in BB emitted particles and thus is an unequivocal tracer of these processes (Bhattarai et al., 89 2019). 90 To investigate the bioavailability of these two molecules, a novel method was developed to extract these anhydrosugars 91 from their salty matrix and monitor their evolution for 44 days under controlled laboratory conditions. Along with the 92 anhydrosugar concentration, multiple parameters (dissolved organic carbon or DOC, inorganic nutrient concentrations, 93 heterotrophic prokaryotic production, abundances of heterotrophic prokaryotes, and heterotrophic prokaryotic diversity) 94 were monitored to achieve a complete picture of their fate in seawater in relation to the physiological responses and changes 95 in the taxonomic composition of the prokaryotic communities. Furthermore, two experiments (one with a reference labile 96 substrate, glucose; and one control, a nonamended substrate with an organic molecule) were run in parallel for comparison 97 purposes. 98"

Seawater sampling 101 Seawater was pumped at 30 m depth at the SOLEMIO station (26 March 2021) in the Bay of Marseille (43.24\u00b0N; 5.29\u00b0E), 102 filtered online through GF/F glass-fiber filters and then transferred to two 20 L Nalgene Carboys (previously washed with 5 103 % HCl, Milli-Q water and seawater). Seawater was allowed to stand in the dark at 5 \u00b0C for approximately two months to allow 104 labile organic matter to be degraded (DOC concentrations dropped from 70\u00b11 to 65\u00b11 \u00b5M C) and then filtered through a 105\n4/17\nWhatman Polycap cartridge (0.2 \u00b5m) to remove any particles or microorganisms. This \u2018prokaryotic free\u2019 seawater was used 106 as background for the biodegradation experiments, and hence, it can be considered as \u2018recalcitrant\u2019 marine DOC. 107\n2.1.2. Preparation of bacterioplankton inoculum 108 The bacterioplankton inoculum was prepared with seawater collected at the same site one day before the experiments 109 were run. First, 10 L of seawater was filtered at 0.8 \u00b5m using polycarbonate filters (precleaned with 10% HCl solution and 110 Milli-Q water) to remove bacterioplankton predators, phytoplanktonic organisms, and detrital particles. Then, this 0.8 \u00b5m 111 filtrate was further concentrated to reach high bacterial abundances by filtration through 0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate filters until 112 a final volume of 0.9 L, in which we resuspended the 0.2 \u00b5m filters. The bacterioplankton inoculum contained 3.95\u00d7106 113 heterotrophic prokaryotes as indicated by flow cytometry. The DOC concentration of the inoculum was 100 \u00b1 6 \u00b5M C (n = 2). 114\n2.1.3. Batch preparation 115 Biodegradation experiments were performed in 2 L precombusted Schott bottles (450 \u00b0C, 6 h) containing 1.95 L of 116 \u2018prokaryotic free\u2019 seawater and the natural prokaryotic community (i.e., 0.05 L of bacterioplankton inoculum). Anhydrosugars 117 and glucose standards were added to each incubation bottle at a final concentration of 10 \u00b5M C resulting in initial DOC 118 concentrations of \u223c 70 \u00b5M C in the bottles, typical carbon concentrations of surface water at this sampling site. Control 119 experiments were run in triplicate without the addition of any organic substrate. To avoid nutrient limitation throughout the 120 experiments and maintain a C/N/P ratio of approximately 106/16/1, nitrate (NaNO3), and phosphate (NaH2PO4) were added 121 to each bottle, including the triplicate controls, to achieve final concentrations of 3.32 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b5M N and 0.20 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5M P. 122 Incubations were run for 44 days in the dark at 21 \u00b0C to ensure the degradation of substrates. To prevent oxygen depletion, 123 the bottles were opened for a few seconds every 2-3 days and stirred quickly by hand. Several parameters were monitored 124 at selected time points for a duration of approximately 6 weeks (Table S1). These parameters included the anhydrosugar 125 concentrations, dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]), inorganic nutrient (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and silicate) 126 concentrations, heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP), heterotrophic prokaryote abundance (HPA), and heterotrophic 127 prokaryotic diversity (HPD). 128\n2.2. Sample analyses 129\n2.2.1. Anhydrosugars 130 Anhydrosugars were sampled from bottles after filtration on precombusted (450 \u00b0C, 6 h) Whatman GF/F (retention size, 131 0.7 \u00b5m) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. Anhydrosugars were extracted from their salty matrix using a mixed anion\u2212cation 132 exchange resin (Amberlite\u00ae IRN-150). First, a 2.5 g bed of resin was packed in a 20 mL glass syringe. Prior to use, the resin 133 was conditioned using successively of acetonitrile, methanol, and water (3\u00d715 mL each). A 2 mL volume of sample was loaded 134 and allowed to stand for 20 min, and the anhydrosugars were then eluted with 30 mL of Milli-Q water. The sample was 135 freeze-dried and redissolved in 1 mL of an acetonitrile/water mixture (90/10, v/v) containing 0.01% TEA, and 2 \u00b5M 136 deuterated levoglucosan (internal standard for MS). 137 Analyses were performed by an Agilent LC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS system equipped with an LC system (Agilent 1290 Infinity) 138 coupled to a Q-TOF (Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass). Separation was performed with a Luna\u00ae 3 \u00b5m NH2 100 \u00c5 (150 x 2 mm, 139 Phenomenex) at 25 \u00b0C. Both solvents, acetonitrile (A) and water (B) contained 0.01% TEA. The flow rate was set at 200 \u00b5L 140 min\u22121 and the gradient elution was as follows: 97% of A for 7 min; it gradually goes to 80% of A for 6 min; held for 2 min; 141 returns to initial conditions in 1 min and is held until the end of the analysis (20 min since injection). The injection volume 142 was 10 \u00b5L. Detection was performed in negative mode under the following conditions: drying gas flow 5 L min\u22121 at 275 \u00b0C, 143 sheath gas flow 11 L min\u22121 at 250 \u00b0C, nebulizer pressure 60 psig, capillary voltage 5000 V, nozzle voltage 2000 V, fragmentor 144 voltage 100 V, skimmer voltage 65 V, and octopole RF 750 V. MS data were recorded at full scan in the range of 50 to 350 145 m/z at a rate of 1 spectrum min\u22121. 146\n2.2.2. Quality assurance/quality control 147 The extraction efficiencies of levoglucosan and galactosan were 89 \u00b1 8 and 71 \u00b1 6% (n = 14), respectively, at a 148 concentration of 2 \u00b5M. To correct for extraction variability, 2 \u00b5M galactosan (surrogate) was added to the levoglucosan 149 subsamples before extraction, and vice versa. Then, the anhydrosugar concentration was calculated as follows: 150 [\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\u210e\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66. ]\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 =\n[\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u210e\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66.]\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2219\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\u2219[\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60]\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 (1) 151 where [\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\u210e\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66. ]\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 is the concentration of the anhydrosugar in the incubation batch, [\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\u210e\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66. ]\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 R is the 152 concentration provided by the LC-Q-TOF, [\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60]\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 is the concentration of surrogate, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 is the preconcentration 153 factor of 2, \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 is extraction efficiency ratio between the two anhydrosugars (which was necessary since levoglucosan 154 systematically present higher extraction efficiencies than galactosan). The latter factor was fairly constant in each extraction. 155 The detection limits of levoglucosan and galactosan in the LC-Q-TOF were 100 and 60 nM, respectively. 156\n5/17\n2.2.3. Dissolved organic carbon 157 DOC subsamples were filtered through a 25 mm precombusted (450 \u00b0C, 6 h) Whatman GF/F filter (nominal retention size, 158 0.7 \u00b5m) and 15 mL of filtrate was acidified with 21 \u00b5L of pure H2SO4 (95-98%) and stored at 5 \u00b0C until analyses. DOC 159 concentration was measured by high-temperature combustion on a Total Carbon Analyzer (Shimadzu TOC 5000) (Para et al., 160 2013; Sohrin and Semp\u00e9r\u00e9, 2005). To avoid random errors associated with day-to-day instrument variability, all samples from 161 a given biodegradation experiment were analyzed in a single day. The procedural blanks (i.e., Milli-Q water) ranged from 1 162 to 2 \u00b5M C and were subtracted from the values presented here. Deep seawater reference samples (provided by D. Hansell, 163 Univ. of Miami) were run daily (43.5 \u00b5M C, n = 4) to check the accuracy of the DOC analyses. The concentrations represent 164 the average of two replicates, ensuring a coefficient of variance (CV) below 2%. 165\n2.2.4. Inorganic nutrients 166 Inorganic nutrient subsamples were filtered with a precombusted GF/F filter (450 \u00b0C, 6 h) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until 167 analyses. Concentrations of nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate were measured by colorimetry using a gas-segmented 168 continuous flow analyzer (Aminot and K\u00e9rouel, 2007). The detection limits of nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate were 169 0.03, 0.05, 0.02, and 0.05 \u00b5M, respectively. In-house standards, which were regularly compared to commercially available 170 products, were analyzed to ensure the reproducibility of the analyses. The standard deviation of triplicate measurements 171 was generally better than 5% at the 0.5 \u00b5M level for all nutrients. 172\n2.2.5. Hetrotrophic prokaryotic production 173 Heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP) was immediately estimated after sampling by 3H-leucine incorporation using 174 the centrifugation method (Smith and Azam, 1992). The detailed protocol has been described elsewhere (Djaoudi et al., 175 2020). Briefly, 1.5 mL samples were incubated in the dark for 1\u22122 h after the addition of 3H-leucine at a final concentration 176 of 20 nM, with the standard deviation of the triplicate measurements being on average 9%. Isotopic dilution was checked 177 and was close to 1 (Van Wambeke et al., 2018); and thus, a conversion factor of 1.5 kg C mol leucine\u22121 was applied to convert 178 leucine incorporation to carbon equivalents (Kirchman, 1993). 179\n2.2.6. Heterotrophic prokaryote abundance 180 Subsamples (1782 \u00b5l) for heterotrophic prokaryote abundances (HPA) were immediately fixed with 18 \u00b5L of mix of 181 glutaraldehyde and pluronic acid (0.25% and 0.01%, respectively of final volume) and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C upon analyses. 182 Analyses were performed using an Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer with an error measurement < 5%, as described 183 elsewhere (Layglon et al., 2020). 184\n2.2.7. Hetrotrophic prokaryotic diversity 185 Polycarbonate filters (0.2 \u00b5m) were used to collect prokaryotes from 300 mL of sample. The filters were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. 186 After thawing, they were cut with sterile scissors into small pieces, immersed in 750 \u00b5L of sterile saline TSE buffer (50 mM 187 Tris-HCl, 750 mM sucrose, 20 mM EDTA, 40 mM NaCl, pH = 9.0) and vortexed horizontally for 5 min at ambient temperature. 188 Cell lysis was performed with lysozyme, SDS and proteinase K as reported elsewhere (Bostr\u00f6m et al., 2004). DNA was 189 precipitated in 70% ethanol, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH = 5.2) and linear polyacrylamide (Genelute-LPA, Sigma\u2212Aldrich) 190 (Gaillard et al., 1990). After 2 rinsing steps with 70% ethanol, DNA pellets were air-dried, resuspended in Milli-Q water, and 191 stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Amplification of the V4-V5 region of 16S rRNA gene was performed with primers 515F-Y/926R (Parada et 192 al., 2016) as described previously (Misson et al., 2021). Extraction and amplification negative controls did not yield any 193 amplification product. After purification (Nucleospin Gel and PCR clean-up, Macherey-Nagel), PCR products were paired-end 194 sequenced (2\u00d7300 bp) with an Illumina MiSeq sequencer by Eurofins (Germany). Sequencing reads were deposited in the 195 National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive (NCBI SRA) under the accession number 196 PRJNA908786. MiSeq raw reads were analyzed with DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016) in RStudio (R Team, 2021) as described 197 previously (Misson et al., 2021). Taxonomic information was assigned to amplicon sequence variants (ASV) with the SILVA 198 database v.138.1 (Quast et al., 2013). Sequences classified as mitochondria or chloroplasts were removed from the dataset. 199 Alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed with RStudio using the phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013) package 200 and represented using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and metacoder (Foster et al., 2017) packages. Differences in alpha and beta 201 diversity metrics were tested for significance (P value < 0.05) using ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests and PERMANOVA with 202 stats and microbial (Guo K. and Gao P, 2021) packages, respectively. 203\n6/17\n3. Results & Discussion 204\n3.1. General observations 205\nThe results of this study showed that levoglucosan concentrations decreased from 15 \u00b1 4 to 0.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5M C (n = 3) 206 throughout the experiment (Fig. 1a). This decrease was also mirrored by the corresponding decrease in DOC concentrations, 207 which dropped from 73 \u00b1 2 to 61 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M C (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the decrease in galactosan concentrations was less 208 pronounced and dropped from 14 \u00b1 2 to 9 \u00b1 4 \u00b5M C (Fig. 1c), while DOC concentrations remained relatively unchanged 209 (initial: 69\u00b12 and final: 68\u00b13 \u00b5M C; Fig. 1d). In a parallel biodegradation experiment run with glucose, the results showed 210 that DOC concentrations rapidly decreased during the first two days of incubation, dropping from 67.6 \u00b5M C to 59.4 \u00b5M C (n 211 = 3) and then remained stable until the end of the experiment (Fig. 1e). Overall, DOC concentrations in the glucose 212 experiment dropped by 10 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M C indicating a complete depletion of the molecule as 10 \u00b5M C was initially added to the 213 batch as a glucose substrate. These results agree with laboratory incubation experiments (Djaoudi et al., 2020) and field 214 studies indicating the rapid utilization of glucose by marine heterotrophic prokaryotes (Kirchman et al., 2001). Finally, in the 215 control experiments (no added organic substrate), DOC concentrations remained fairly constant at \u223c 60 \u00b5M C throughout 216 the experiment (Fig. 1b, d, and e) indicating that changes in DOC concentrations for the other experiments were associated 217 with heterotrophic bacterial activities that were ignited from the addition of a degradable substrate (anhydrosugar/glucose). 218\n7/17\n219\nFig. 1. Time course responses of anhydrosugars (levoglucosan: a and galactosan: c) and DOC concentrations (b, d, e) 220 for all biodegradation experiments. The exponential fit of the average anhydrosugar concentrations is also presented 221 with a dashed line with a 95% confidence interval shaded with a red/green surface (a, c). The time response of the 222 mean DOC concentrations in the control experiments is shown in black (b, d, e), with the maximum and minimum 223 observed values shaded in black. Abbreviations: LEV, levoglucosan; GAL, galactosan; GLU, glucose; Ctrl, control. 224\n8/17\nIn line with the above observations, the decrease in the concentration of anhydrosugars and glucose was accompanied 225 by an increase in heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP) and abundance (HPA) (Fig. 2). In the levoglucosan experiments 226 (Fig. 2a and b), both HPP and HPA reached maximum values after at least \u223c15 d, whereas for the galactosan experiment, 227 significant increases in both parameters (Fig. 2c and d) were observed only at the end of the incubation period (44 days), 228 consistent with the slight decrease in galactosan concentration and DOC. In the glucose experiments (Fig. 2e and f), a rapid 229 increase in both HPP and HPA was observed after \u223c 1 d of incubation, with maximum values of 2000 \u00b1 300 ng C L\u22121 h\u22121 and 230 (1.11 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7106 cell mL\u22121, respectively, representing an increase of at least one order of magnitude from the initial values. 231 As expected, control experiments showed little variation in HPP and HPA, with values relatively stable at \u223c 10 ng C L\u22121 h\u22121 232 and \u223c 1.7\u00d7105 cell mL\u22121, indicating low prokaryotic activity in the absence of added organic substrate. 233\n234\nFig. 2. Time course responses of heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP: a, c, e) and abundances (HPA: b,d,f) in 235 anhydrosugars (levoglucosan and galactosan) and glucose biodegradation experiments. The time response of the 236 mean of HPP and HPA values in the control experiments are shown in black dots, with the maximum and minimum 237 observed values shaded in black. Abbreviations: LEV, levoglucosan; GAL, galactosan; GLU, glucose; Ctrl, control. 238\n9/17\nFor the levoglucosan experiment, the measurements of HPP and HPA showed a degree of variability among replicates, 239 which was not a measurement artifact since all investigated parameters were consistent within replicates. Indeed, HPP and 240 HPA increases were observed first in the second replicate of the levoglucosan experiment (LEV2 in Fig. 2a and b), which 241 displayed simultaneous decreases in DOC and levoglucosan concentrations (Fig. 1a and b). This variability may be related to 242 differences in the ignition time at which some species of heterotrophic prokaryotes start to degrade the substrate added 243 within the replicates, the low frequency of sampling during the most intense period of prokaryotic activity (which may miss 244 the real time of peaks in this case) and finally the biological heterogeneity and complexity of biotic interactions within the 245 bottles Such variability among the replicates has already been reported in similar biodegradation experiments carried out 246 with atmospheric aerosols (Djaoudi et al., 2020), phytoplankton culture (Suroy et al., 2015) or fast sinking particles 247 (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2002). 248 Inorganic nutrient concentrations showed similar patterns with the above observations (Fig. S1). For levoglucosan, nitrate 249 and phosphate concentrations decreased after \u223c44 d of incubation (initial concentrations: 3.3 \u00b1 0.1 and 0.20 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M, 250 respectively; final concentrations: 2.6 \u00b1 0.3, and 0.16 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5M, respectively) indicating that the utilization of these nutrients 251 provides the N and P sources necessary to degrade levoglucosan by marine heterotrophic prokaryotes. In contrast, for the 252 galactosan experiment, nitrate and phosphate concentrations remained constant and similar to those of the control 253 experiment. Finally, nitrite and silicate concentrations for all the experiments were similar to the control experiment 254 indicating, low utilization compared to the initial concentration of these nutrients during the experiments and/or equilibrium 255 between uptake and mineralization processes. In contrast, in the glucose experiment, a significant increase in nitrite and 256 phosphate concentrations was observed at the end of the incubation, showing a decoupling between nutrient uptake and 257 regeneration with time. 258\n3.2. Are anhydrosugars labile substrates assimilated by marine prokaryotes? 259\nThe results of this study demonstrated that anhydrosugars exhibited different dynamics compared to a labile substrate 260 such as glucose with regard to their utilization by marine heterotrophic prokaryotes. Specifically, levoglucosan and galactosan 261 exhibited a distinct lag time during which their concentration remained unchanged (Fig. 1a and c), in contrast to the 262 immediate degradation of glucose which occurred 1 d after the beginning of the experiment (Fig.1e). In fact, levoglucosan 263 assimilation started between 9 and 15 d, while for galactosan, it was after 15 d. Although the decrease in both anhydrosugars 264 was much slower than that of glucose, galactosan showed a much longer persistence in seawater than levoglucosan. The 265 average half-life times (calculated assuming first-order kinetics (Castro-Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2022)) were 78 \u00b1 12 and 8 \u00b1 1 d (n = 266 3) for galactosan and levoglucosan, respectively. Previous field studies in marine and aquatic environments showed a rapid 267 utilization of glucose by bacterioplankon with glucose always exhibiting the shortest turnover time (5-12 h) over other 268 monosaccharides including galactose (Bunte and Simon, 1999; Skoog et al., 1999). Considering that levoglucosan and 269 galactosan are dehydrated forms of glucose and galactose, respectively the differences in assimilation between these two 270 anhydrosugars observed in this experiment may be possibly to the different utilization rates between glucose and galactose 271 as demonstrated for the marine environment. 272 The time responses of HPP and HPA (Fig.2) confirmed that both levoglucosan and galactosan are bioavailable substrates, 273 although they do not appear to be the first choice for marine heterotrophic prokaryotes compared to a model of labile 274 substrates such as glucose. They can be partially taken up at the scale of a few weeks, suggesting that they may be considered 275 semilabile compounds based on their reactivity (Carlson and Hansell, 2015; Nelson and Wear, 2014). The semilabile nature 276 of these substrates also concurs with the radiocarbon measurements made on levoglucosan (\u2206 = 48.5\u2030) and galactosan 277 (\u2206 = 35.4\u2030) standards used for this biodegradation experiment highlighting the modern age of these compounds which 278 further points to recent photosynthetic molecules (Nouara et al., 2019). 279 The low uptake of anhydrosugars by marine heterotrophic prokaryotes, as revealed by biodegradation experiments, is 280 consistent with their detection at low concentrations in marine sediments (Hopmans et al., 2013; Schreuder et al., 2018) or 281 other aquatic ecosystems (Elias et al., 2001). Nevertheless, as the compounds are semilabile, they might potentially be 282 biodegraded and thus reintegrated into the carbon cycle. To better understand the biological fate of C for anhydrosugars, 283 the bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) of levoglucosan was calculated (see details in Supplementary Section S1). Under our 284 experimental conditions, levoglucosan had a BGE of 17 \u00b1 5% (n=3). Compared to the BGE calculated for glucose (70 \u00b1 10%; 285 n=3), and assuming conservative leucine-carbon conversion factors through the 4 experiments and time, this suggests that 286 levoglucosan is primarily used by bacteria for cell maintenance and energetic needs rather than growth, resulting in its 287 mineralization into CO2. The BGE of galactosan was not calculated due to its very low degradation during the incubation 288 period and possible interference with the biological simultaneous use of bulk marine DOC. However, the fate of this 289 compound will likely be the same as levoglucosan due to the low HPP and HPA observed. 290\n10/17\n3.3. Which bacteria can process anhydrosugars? 291\nTo further explore the prokaryotic populations involved in anhydrosugar degradation we analyzed community structure 292 through 16S rRNA gene sequencing at three different incubation times (0, 4.7 and 43.7 days). The results showed that the 293 initial (T0) prokaryotic community was mostly composed of Alphaproteobacteria (50-68%), with a strong predominance of 294 the SAR11 clade, along with diverse Gammaproteobacteria. Such dominance of SAR11 is common in oligotrophic NW 295 Mediterranean surface waters (Coclet et al., 2019; Navarro et al., 2023; Salter et al., 2014). This pattern remained highly 296 similar throughout the experiment in the control condition (Fig. 3 and S1). Similarly, no significant changes were observed in 297 community richness between the initial community and the control condition during the 43.7 days of incubation (Fig. 3 and 298 4). In contrast, the prokaryotic community richness significantly decreased after 4.7 days in glucose-amended incubation (P 299 < 0.002). The presence of glucose also prompted a significant shift in community structure (P < 0.01) linked to the fast 300 development of Gammaproteobacteria from the Vibrionaceae family, representing 68-76% of the entire community after 301 4.7 days of incubation (Fig. S1). Such opportunistic growth of Gammaproteobacteria, especially Vibrionaceae is consistent 302 with previous work (Eilers et al., 2000; Haider et al., 2023). Depletion of glucose triggered a succession by members of 303 Bacteroidota from the Cryomorphacae and Flavobacteriacea families, together with Crenarchaea from the Nitrosopoluminus 304 genera. Given the ability of Nitrosopumilus to perform ammonium oxidation (Walker et al., 2010) and the copiotrophic 305 character of Cryomorphacae or Flavobacteriacea known to contribute to heterotrophic blooms after phytoplanktonic blooms 306 (Ho et al., 2017; Teeling et al., 2016), we propose that the succession of dominant prokaryotes observed with glucose addition 307 reflects niche partitioning between opportunists (Vibrionaceae) and recyclers using organic matter from dead organisms 308 (Bacteroidota) and regenerating nutrients (Nitrosopumilus). This hypothesis is consistent with the nutrient dynamics 309 described above. 310 For levoglucosan and galactosan, the prokaryotic richness did not significantly vary in the short term (P > 0.05, Fig. 4), in 311 coherence with the observed delay (> 8.7 days) of the decay of these anhydrosugars. A significant decrease in the prokaryotic 312 diversity was observed at the end of the incubation (43.7 days) for levoglucosan (P < 0.01). The observed decrease was less 313 pronounced than that observed for glucose after 4.7 days. Similarly, distance analysis did not reveal any significant change 314 in community structure after 4.7 days of incubation, but it significantly shifted after 43.7 days of incubation with levoglucosan 315 and galactosan compared to the initial community and the previous sampling time (P < 0.01). This significant shift 316 corresponded to the development of Alphaproteobacteria from the family Rhodobacteraceae, with a notable development 317 of genera Dinoroseobacter, Jannaschia and HIMB11, with less consistency among replicates for the latter. For two replicates 318 exposed to levoglucosan, Alphaproteobacteria from the Rhizobiales order were particularly enriched (Fig. 3). The SAR11 clade 319 exhibited an important decrease in its proportion with the addition of levoglucosan. The three genera of Rhodobacteraceae 320 selected with anhydrosugars are known to belong to the Roseobacter group (Durham et al., 2014; Wagner-D\u00f6bler et al., 321 2009, 2003). Their delayed selection in our experiments is consistent with the delayed growth and slow growth efficiency 322 mentioned above. This suggests a specific enzymatic capacity of these genera for processing anhydrosugars. Very few studies 323 have reported the bacterial mechanisms and/or metabolic pathways for levoglucosan degradation (Iwasaki et al., 2018; 324 Kuritani et al., 2020), although it appears to be a common function/process distributed across different bacterial phyla (Kaur 325 et al., 2023). However, the demonstration of such potential for marine bacteria including the bacterial degradation of 326 galactosan, remains to our knowledge unknown and warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, our study suggests for the 327 first time the association of widespread marine bacterial genera with the biodegradation of biomass burning tracers. The 328 Roseobacter group is known for its abundance and tremendous diversity in the global ocean (Daniel et al., 2018; Luo and 329 Moran, 2014). By suggesting the importance of specific enzymatic capacities to process semilabile compounds, this work 330 paves the way for further research linking the molecular composition of semilabile organic compounds accumulating in 331 epipelagic/mesopelagic waters and the diversity of the Roseobacter group. 332 333\n11/17\n334\nFig. 3. Heat trees comparing the relative variations in the most abundant (> 2%) prokaryotic taxa between the control 335 condition and different amendments after 43.7 days. Taxa more represented in the control condition appear in dark 336 colors while taxa enriched in levoglucosan, galactosan or glucose-amended conditions appear in red, green, or pink, 337 respectively. Node size is related to the number of genera representing the taxa. The color intensity of edges and 338 nodes is proportional to the enrichment of the taxa in the corresponding condition (median difference based on 339 triplicate experiments). Light gray taxa show similar representation in the compared conditions. 340\n12/17\nThe noteworthy heterogeneity of genera from the Roseobacter group selected among replicates with anhydrosugars 341 addition suggests a functional redundancy that deserves further investigation, the functional ability to process these 342 semilabile compounds appears to be held at the Roseobacter group scale. The demonstrated ability to exchange plasmids 343 between phylogenetically distant members of this group (Petersen and Wagner-D\u00f6bler, 2017) could largely contribute to 344 their functional redundancy. Such functional redundancy could even be extended to Rhizobiales, since the possibility of 345 genetic exchange between roseobacters and rhizobia has been demonstrated (Bartling et al., 2017). This could explain the 346 selection of some Rhizobiales in two replicates of the levoglucosan condition observed in our work. 347 348\n349\nFig. 4. Inverse Simpson index for prokaryotic richness at three incubation times. 350\n351\n4. Conclusions 352\nOur findings have shown that BB tracers (levoglucosan and galactosan) can be assimilated by marine heterotrophic 353 prokaryotes on a time scale of a few weeks and thus may be considered as semilabile substrates. Although these two 354 anhydrosugars cannot entirely represent the complex biomass burning particles the present study suggests that marine 355 prokaryotes mostly use these substrates for cell maintenance and energetic needs (and thus carbon is mostly mineralized 356 into CO2). Prokaryotic diversity analyses revealed the predominance of a few bacterial genera from the Roseobacter clade 357 that were specifically selected by the addition of the anhydrosugars. These results suggest that the tremendous diversity of 358 this widespread marine bacterial clade could reflect its ability to process a large diversity of semilabile compounds (here 359 represented by levoglucosan and galactosan) constituting dissolved organic matter pools in surface ocean waters. 360\n5.
