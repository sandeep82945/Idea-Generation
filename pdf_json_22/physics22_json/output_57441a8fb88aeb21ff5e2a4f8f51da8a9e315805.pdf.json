    "abstractText": "Casimir friction is theoretically studied between graphene-covered undoped bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) in detail. In the graphene/Bi2Se3 composite structure, the coupling of the hyperbolic phonon polaritons supported by Bi2Se3 with the surface plasmons supported by graphene can lead to the hybrid surface plasmon\u2013phonon polaritons (SPPPs). Compared with that between undoped Bi2Se3, Casimir friction can be enhanced by more than one order of magnitude due to the contribution of SPPPs. It is found that the chemical potential that can be used to modulate the optical characteristic of SPPPs plays an important role in Casimir friction. In addition, the Casimir friction between doped Bi2Se3 is also studied. The friction coefficient between doped Bi2Se3 can even be larger than that between graphene-covered undoped Bi2Se3 for suitable chemical potential due to the contribution of unusual electron surface states. The results obtained in this work are not only beneficial to the study of Casimir frictions but also extend the research ranges of topological insulators.",

            "text": "In nature, friction is a very common phenomenon, which extensively exists in the macroscopic to the microscopic world. However, the physical mechanism of friction in the microscopic world is different from that of the friction observed in our daily lives. In recent years, people have paid much attention to nanotribology with the rapid development of nanofabrication technology. Interestingly, there is one type of friction that appears between bodies in relative motion even without direct contact at the nanoscale, which is usually called noncontact friction [1\u20137]. Noncontact friction has been observed experimentally by atomic force microscopy [1,5,6] and has important practical significance in ultra-sensitive force detection. In the past decade, another noncontact friction originating from the momentum exchange of Doppler-shifted photons has attracted much attention [8]. The essence of this friction is closely related to the Casimir effect, so it is called Casimir friction [8,9]. Even at zero temperature, Casimir friction can still exist because of the vacuum fluctuation, so it will be denoted as quantum friction. Casimir frictions have been extensively studied in several configurations that are in relative motion, such as atom and atom [10], atom and plate [11\u201313], and plate and plate [14]. The theoretical method of Casimir friction between two objects separated by a small gap was firstly derived by Pendry with the help of classical electromagnetic theory [8]. Then, Volokitin and Persson also made a series of works on Casimir friction [15\u201320]. Because the Casimir friction is extremely small, it makes a great challenge to detect in an experiment. Enhancing the Casimir friction between bodies in relative motion becomes an important topic. An enhancement mechanism of Casimir friction associated with resonant photon tunneling on different surfaces was proposed [16]. It has been found that Casimir friction will be significantly enhanced if the materials can support low-frequency surface plasmons (SPs) or other surface polaritons [16]. Therefore, plenty of materials that can support\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1148. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12071148 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1148 2 of 13\nsurface polaritons are employed to investigate the Casimir friction [21,22]. Among them, graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of carbon atoms [23\u201325], which can support SPs from terahertz (THz) to infrared frequency ranges [26\u201335]. In particular, the optical conductivity of graphene depends on its chemical potential, which is controlled by an external field or gate voltage. It is shown that SPs supported by graphene can play an important role in enhancing and actively modulating Casimir friction [36\u201339]. In addition, the Casimir friction between graphene-covered hyperbolic materials (HMs) has also been studied [40]. The coupling of graphene plasmon with hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) supported by HMs can enhance the Casimir friction remarkably [40]. In the past decade, topological insulators have received extensive attention because of their exotic characteristic and important applications in the fabrications of new electronic devices [41\u201345]. They are characterized by a full insulating gap in the bulk and gapless surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry [44]. The three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators have been predicted theoretically in the Bi1\u2212xSbx alloy [46] and observed experimentally by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy [47]. Then, several simple 3D topological insulators were predicted theoretically in Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 [48], and Bi2Se3 [48,49] compounds with a large gap in bulk and gapless surface state. Bismuthbased topological insulators have attracted great interest due to their unusual electronic surface states, which are manifested as massless Dirac fermions [43,44,48\u201351]. As one of the representative topological insulators, Bi2Se3 is also well-known for its bulk optical response [52\u201355] besides its novel surface state. It exhibits hyperbolic dispersion relation and can support highly oriented collective HPPs in the THz range [56]. For Bi2Se3 with finite doping, the coupling of HPPs with Dirac plasmon confined at the surface can result in the appearance of hybrid modes [56]. However, the SPs are absent for undoped Bi2Se3. As has been mentioned above, graphene plasmon can be coupled with different surface polaritons, so it is interesting to investigate the coupling between graphene plasmon and HPPs supported by undoped Bi2Se3. In this paper, we study the Casimir friction between graphene-covered undoped Bi2Se3. The low-frequency HPPs supported by Bi2Se3 can be coupled with SPs supported by graphene, and then resulting in the appearance of hybrid surface plasmon\u2013phonon polaritons (SPPPs). We demonstrate that the SPPPs play an important role in the Casimir friction between graphene-covered Bi2Se3. Compared with that between undoped Bi2Se3, the Casimir friction between graphene-covered Bi2Se3 enhances about one order of magnitude in wide separation gaps. Furthermore, the hybrid SPPPs can be flexibly controlled by tuning the chemical potential of graphene that depends on the gate voltage. Therefore, it provides an opportunity to actively modulate the Casimir friction between topological insulators. Casimir friction between doped Bi2Se3 is also studied. Depending on the chemical potential, Casimir friction between doped Bi2Se3 can be larger or smaller than that between graphene-covered Bi2Se3 under the same separation distance. This study not only extends the research ranges of topological insulators but also provides an efficient method to control the Casimir friction."

We assume the top graphene-covered Bi2Se3 moves relatively to the bottom one along the x-axis with a velocity v in the laboratory frame. The temperature of the surrounding environment is denoted by T, which is set to be T = 300 K in all the calculations.

Dependence of the Casimir friction coefficient on chemical potential for different separation distances \ud835\udc51.\nIn Figure 8, we show the FSD in order to understand the physical mechanism of the relationship between the friction coefficient and chemical potential. The separation distance between the top and bottom graphene-covered Bi2Se3 is fixed at \ud835\udc51 = 20 nm in the calculations. When the chemical potential of graphene is smaller (\ud835\udf07 = 0.05 eV), we can see that Casimir friction is mainly determined by the HPPs as shown by the solid black line. In this case, the coupling between HPPs and graphene plasmons is weak. The HPPs and graphene plasmon contribute to the Casimir friction separately. As the chemical potential increases (\ud835\udf07 = 0.1 eV), the coupling between HPPs and SPs occurs, resulting in the enhancement of SPPPs in a wide frequency region compared with the SPs supported by graphene as shown in red dashed lines in Figure 8. However, when the chemical potential continues to increase, the peak of SPPPs shifts toward higher frequencies with a decrease in magnitude. This will lead to the decrease in the Casimir friction. Therefore, we can demonstrate the coupling of graphene plasmon with HPPs supported by undoped Bi2Se3 can enhance the Casimir friction significantly between graphene-covered Bi2Se3. It is also possible to actively modulate the Casimir friction between such graphene/Bi2Se3 composite structures by controlling the gate voltage.\nFigure 8.

The separation distanc between the top and bottom graphene-covered Bi2Se3 is fixed at d = 20 nm in the calculations. When t chemical potential of graphene is smaller (\u00b5 = 0.05 eV), we can see th t Casimir friction is mainly determined by the HPPs as shown by the solid black line. In this case, the coupling between HPPs and graphene plasmons is weak. The HPPs and graphene plasm contribute to the Cas mi fr ction sep rately.

After substituting the conductivity in Equation (4) with \u03c3B in Equation (6), we can calculate the Casimir friction between doped Bi2Se3 by employing Equation (1). In Figure 9, we show the dependence of the Casimir friction coefficient on the separation distance d for different chemical potentials \u00b5B of doped Bi2Se3, which is similar to that shown in Figure 6. We can see that the Casimir friction coefficient decreases rapidly with the increase in separation distance d. When the separation distance is less than 20 nm, the friction coefficient is not sensitive to the chemical potential. When the separation distance becomes larger, the friction coefficient decreases as the chemical potential increases. Such phenomenon is different from that between graphene-covered undoped Bi2Se3 which is shown in Figure 6. In addition, comparing Figure 9 with Figure 3, we can also see that the friction coefficient between doped Bi2Se3 is larger than that between undoped Bi2Se3 when the separation distance is less than 20 nm. However, when the separation is larger than 20 nm, the difference in Casimir friction between undoped Bi2Se3 and doped Bi2Se3 is very small. In Figure 10, we show the dependence of the Casimir friction coefficient on the chemical potential of doped Bi2Se3 for different separation distances d. When the separation distance is 10 nm, the friction coefficient almost does not vary with the chemical potential. That means the chemical potential of doped Bi2Se3 has little impact on the surface states that dominate the Casimir friction at such a small distance. The Casimir friction, in this case, is even larger than that between graphene-covered Bi2Se3 when the chemical potential is larger than 0.1 eV, which can be seen in Figure 7. For the cases with separation distances are 20 and 30 nm, the friction coefficients first increase and then decrease after reaching the maximum values as the chemical potential \u00b5B increase. However, the friction coefficients between doped Bi2Se3 are not as sensitive to the chemical potential as those between graphene-covered undoped Bi2Se3.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1148 10 of 13\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 13"

            "text": "In summary, we have studied the Casimir friction between graphene-covered Bi2Se3. Owing to the coupling of the HPPs supported by Bi2Se3 to the SPs excited by graphene, the Casimir friction between the proposed structures shows a significant enhancement compared to those between undoped Bi2Se3 materials. The Casimir friction can be modulated actively by tuning the chemical potential of graphene. It is found that the maximum value of Casimir friction can be obtained by choosing the appropriate chemical potential. Furthermore, Casimir friction between doped Bi2Se3 is also studied. When the chemical potential is larger than 0.1 eV, Casimir friction between doped Bi2Se3 is even larger than that between graphene-covered undoped Bi2Se3. Although more and more schemes have been proposed to enhance the Casimir force, it is still challenging to observe such a small force exactly in an experiment. Because it may play an important role in the nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), it is feasible to observe the Casimir force in the NEMS successfully. The results of this study are of great help to extend the research range of Casimir frictions and are meaningful to understanding the application of ultra-sensitive force detection of topological insulators.\nAuthor Contributions: The manuscript was written through contributions of all authors.
