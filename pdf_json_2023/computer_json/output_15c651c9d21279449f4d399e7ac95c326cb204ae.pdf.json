            "text": "i-Motifs (iMs), are secondary structures formed in cytosine-rich DNA sequences and are 20 involved in multiple functions in the genome. Although putative iM forming sequences are 21\nwidely distributed in the human genome, the folding status and strength of putative iMs vary 22 dramatically. Much previous research on iM has focused on assessing the iM folding properties 23 using biophysical experiments. However, there are no dedicated computational tools for 24 predicting the folding status and strength of iM structures. Here, we introduce a machine 25 learning pipeline, iM-Seeker, to predict both folding status and structural stability of DNA iMs. 26 The programme iM-Seeker incorporates a Balanced Random Forest classifier trained on 27 genome-wide iMab antibody-based CUT&Tag sequencing data to predict the folding status 28 and an Extreme Gradient Boosting regressor to estimate the folding strength according to 29 both literature biophysical data and our in-house biophysical experiments. iM-Seeker predicts 30 DNA iM folding status with a classification accuracy of 81% and estimates the folding strength 31 with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.642 on the test set. Model interpretation confirms 32 that the nucleotide composition of the C-rich sequence significantly affects iM stability, with a 33 positive correlation with sequences containing cytosine and thymine and a negative 34 correlation with guanine and adenine. 35\n36\nINTRODUCTION 37\nNucleotides are the basic units that form DNA and RNA, two key molecules in the central 38 dogma. DNA encodes genetic information, which is transcribed to mRNA and then translated 39 to protein. In addition to this transfer of information, DNA and RNA can form complex 40 structures, which can play crucial functional roles in organisms. Besides the canonical Watson-41 Crick double-helical B-form structure, DNA can form non-canonical secondary structures such 42 as G-quadruplexes (G4s) and i-Motifs (iMs). G4s are four-stranded structures formed from G-43 rich sequences and are stabilised by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding between guanines (1). iMs 44 are also four-stranded structures, but formed from cytosine C-rich regions that are stabilised 45 by hemi-protonated C-C base pairs (C+:C) (2,3). Complementary G-rich and C-rich sequences 46 can form G4s and iMs interdependently during distinct cellular processes (4). As a non-47 canonical structure, iMs are indicated to play an important role in the genome. There are an 48 increasing number of in vitro and in celluo studies that report evidence that iMs could fold in 49 promotor region of certain genes, telomeres and untranslated regions. They have also been 50 implicated as a regulatory element associated with the cell cycle, transcription, chromatin 51 remodelling, as well as transposable element dynamics (5-7). 52\nCommonly, computational analysis of putative iMs is limited to indirect identification by 53 searching for potential complementary G4 sequences in the genome (8). Plenty of G4 54 prediction tools have been developed previously, and these can generally be divided into two 55 categories based on whether or not the models utilised experimentally-derived G4-specific 56 data. Classical computational tools which do not use G4-specific data, are typically constructed 57 from string-matching models based on a specific sequence pattern. Others use a designed 58 scoring system according to pre-defined rules. For example, platforms like Quadparser (9), 59\nQuadruplexes (10), and AllQuads (11), used algorithms like regular expression to search 60\nG4 forming sequences, whilst QGRS Mapper (12), G4P (13), and G4hunter (14), use scoring 61\nmodels that can estimate the probability or strength of putative G4s (15). These models 62 have potential to be used in iM-forming sequences searching, because the putative iMs have 63 in principle similar sequence patterns and some of the rules will be transferrable to both 64 structures. For example, enrichment of G/C in a C/G-rich sequence disfavours both G4 and iMs. 65 In contrast, there are also platforms guided by G4-specific data (e.g., biophysical properties, 66 G4 ChIP-seq, G4 CUT&Tag, and G4-seq) that can capture additional G4-specific features to 67 improve the G4 prediction performance (16). Software like PQSfinder (17), G4boost (18), 68 Quadron (19), DeepG4 (20), and G4-folding energy estimation module integrated in RNAFold 69 (21) use data from G4-specific experiments to increase the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, 70 the application of these models on iM identification is limited. Out of the existing searching 71 platforms, G4-Hunter is the easiest to use for searching for iMs as it was designed to take into 72 account C with negative values both to disfavour regions rich in alternative G/C and to score 73 both strand of a DNA duplex simultaneously. C-richness and C-skew is obviously important 74 for iM formation (14). Besides, G4-iM Grinder can also be used to predict and evaluate G4 and 75 iM forming sequences (22). Typically, individual C-rich sequences are biophysically assed for 76 their capability to form iMs. UV spectroscopy is typically used to determine the thermodynamic 77 properties such as melting (TM) and annealing (TA) temperatures (23). Furthermore, thermal 78 difference spectra (TDS) are typically generated, using the difference in absorbance spectra 79 between folded and unfolded DNA, determining a signature to identify the formed secondary 80 DNA structure (24). UV spectroscopy is often accompanied with circular dichroism (CD) 81 spectroscopy to conform the formation of i-motif structure. The transitional pH (pHT) is an 82\nimportant measure of the stability of iM structures, determined by assessing the formation of 83 iM across a pH-range (8,25-27). 84\nA systematic prediction tool to identify DNA iM folding status and their potential 85 stability is lacking. Recently, the landscape of iM forming sequences in the whole human 86 genome was determined via the novel CUT&Tag sequencing using anti-iM iMab antibodies on 87 living human cells (7). Here we introduce, iM-Seeker, a novel computational pipeline using the 88 genome-wide iM profile (7), iM-stability data from the literature, and our in-house biophysical 89 analysis to predict iM structure formation and stability. iM-Seeker utilised a newly-designed 90 graph-based algorithm to search for putative iM forming sequences within an entered DNA 91 sequence. The Balanced Random Forest script is trained on the iMs identified in the human 92 genome derived from iMab-based CUT&Tag sequencing data (7) and was further developed 93 to predict iM structure folding status within DNA sequences. iM-Seeker also incorporates the 94 Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regressor to predict the structure stability, by cross 95 referencing iM forming DNA sequences to their corresponding pHT values. Furthermore, this 96 computational model has shed new insight into the importance of nucleotide composition in 97 iM stability. A positive correlation was observed for sequences containing cytosine and 98 thymine whilst sequences rich in guanine and adenine were found to have a negative 99 correlation with iM stability. Alongside nucleotide composition, long C-tract lengths 100 accompanied with short loop lengths contribute towards high stability of iM structure. 101\n102\nMATERIAL AND METHODS 103\nData collection 104\nWe collected the published CUT&Tag sequencing data in the human genome (7). The data was 105 downloaded from the NCBI GEO database (accession number GSE220882). The BigWig format 106 data included iM forming sequences from both 93T449 (WDLPS) cell line and human 107 embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cell line with three biological replicates for each cell line. The 108 focus was concentrated on HEK293T cell data which was presented with more high-confident 109 iM regions than WDLPS cells (7). The downloaded BigWig files were converted to bedGraph 110 files and iM-peak region were cumulated with SEACR v1.3 set to \u201c0.01 non stringent\u201d 111\nparameters (7,28). The intersected iM-peak regions among three biological replicates were 112 defined as the final high-confident iM-peak regions. Literature-derived data of i-Motif forming 113 sequences and their corresponding pHT values were collected (Supplementary Table S1). 114 115 Graph-based putative i-motif searching 116 Putative i-Motifs can be identified based on their sequence pattern (C\u22653N1\u201312)3C\u22653 where C 117\nrepresents cytosine and N represent any nucleotide (29,30). The classic approach to identify 118 potential putative iM-forming sequences is to search complementary sequences of G4-119 forming sequences based on sequence pattern matching. This assumption and current 120 approaches limit the identification of iMs with their different variations in C:C(+) formations 121 and topologies compared to G4s (29,30). To overcome this limitation, we designed a general 122 pattern for iM formation searching using directed graph traversal process. For one sequence, 123 the C-tracts can be regarded as nodes, and the loops can be defined as edges. All possible C-124 tracts (C-tract length \u22653) are identified as nodes in the first phase, and if the distance between 125\ntwo nodes (loop length) is between one and twelve nucleotides, a directed edge is added 126 between the two nodes. After constructing the directed graph, all possible iM formations and 127 conformations are identified via the traversal of the directed graph from every node. All 128 possible putative iMs are represented with the sub-population containing the first four nodes 129 and three edges of the traversing paths with at least four nodes. To choose the representative 130 iM structures from all possible iM structures, four strategies were introduced (greedy non-131 overlapping, greedy overlapping, non-greedy non-overlapping, and non-greedy overlapping) 132 maintaining the nomenclature derived from QuadBase2 (31). Overlapping strategy selects an 133 iM representative structure for each iM starting coordinate while the non-overlapping function 134 has no coinciding iM representatives. The greedy strategy maximises the loop length of iM 135 representatives with longest C-tract. For non-greedy strategies, the iM with the most extended 136 C-tract length and the shortest loop length can be selected. One representative iM forming 137 sequence may have many different iM conformations although they share the same sequence 138 content. Two representative iM formations are chosen for according to their stability: (A) the 139 structure with minimum standard deviation of loop lengths; (B) the structure with minimum 140 length of the two side loops. We called the initial computational pipeline Putative-iM-Searcher 141 (Figure 1A). 142\n143 Dataset construction and feature selection for machine learning 144\nWe employed a Putative-iM-Searcher in high-confident iM-peak regions and interval regions 145 in both Watson and Crick strands in the human reference genome (GRCh38). Putative iMs in 146 high confident iM-peak regions were defined as folded iMs, and unfolded C-rich sequences in 147 interval regions. We used a non-overlapping strategy to avoid bias in the performance 148 estimation of the classification model. Four classification datasets were constructed: 149 (Classification dataset 1) non-overlapping, greedy and conformation A; (Classification dataset 150 2) non-overlapping, greedy and conformation B; (Classification dataset 3) non-overlapping, 151 non-greedy and conformation A; (Classification dataset 4) non-overlapping, non-greedy and 152 conformation B. 153\n154\nWe selected the data items with reliable pHT from literature-derived data. We also generated 155 our in-house biophysical experimental data for developing regression models. The Putative-156 iM-Searcher was applied to filtered dataset of iM forming sequences with their corresponding 157 pHT values. The iMs which meet the sequence pattern with corresponding pHT were used for 158 regression model construction. We also filtered iM items with the same putative iM forming 159 sequence but different pHT and combined iM items with the same putative iM forming 160 sequence and pHT to avoid bias. Both our classification model and regression model used 161 thirty-three different features: C-tract length, iM length, loop length, middle loop length, 162 longest side loop length, shortest side loop length, sum of two side loops, longest loop length, 163 shortest loop length, A density in iMs, C density in iMs, G density in iMs, T density in iMs, A 164 density in loops, C density in loops, G density in loops, T density in loops, A density in middle 165 loop, C density in middle loop, G density in middle loop, T density in middle loop, A density in 166 longest side loop, C density in longest side loop, G density in longest side loop, T density in 167 longest side loop, A density in shortest side loop, C density in shortest side loop, G density in 168 shortest side loop, T density in shortest side loop, A density in two side loops, C density in two 169 side loops, G density in two side loops, T density in two side loops. For the regression system, 170 the iM folding strength is defined as the pHT after standardization and min-max scaling. 171\n172\nThe imbalanced ensemble learning to predict folded and unfolded i-motifs 173\nA five-fold cross-validation assessment was applied to evaluate the classification performance 174 of the iMs for four datasets via nine classifiers including Decision Trees (32), Random Forest 175 (33), Balanced Random Forest (34), Naive Bayes (35), Linear Discriminant Analysis (36), Easy 176 Ensemble (37), Balanced Bagging (38,39), Random Undersampling Boosting (RUSBoost) (40), 177 and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms (41). The combination of dataset and 178 model which achieve best performance via area under the receiver operating characteristic 179 curve (AUROC) and balanced accuracy, was used for classification. 90% of data in the whole 180 dataset was randomly selected and separated into a training & validation set, and the 181 remaining 10% of data was used as the test set. Five-fold cross-validation and grid searching 182 on training & validation set were employed to search for the best hyperparameters and test 183 set was used to evaluate the model\u2019s classification performance on accuracy, recall, specificity, 184 and AUROC. 185\n186 The regression algorithm to measure the strength of i-motif using ensemble learning. 187 Consistent iM searching and conformation identification strategy with classification dataset 188 was applied in the regression model. A five-fold cross validation assessment was applied to 189 evaluate the regression performance of the iMs based on thirteen regressors including 190 Decision Trees (32), Random Forest (33), Linear Regression (42), Ridge Regression (43), Lasso 191 Regression (44), Elastic Net Linear Regression (45), Linear Support Vector Regression (46), 192 Radial Basis Function Support Vector Regression (47), K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN) 193 (48), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) (49), Gradient Boosting (50), Extreme Gradient Boosting 194 (XGBoost) (41), and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithms (51). 80% of data in the 195 whole dataset was separated into training & validation set randomly for hyperparameters 196 adjustment by five-fold cross-validation and grid searching, and 20% of data was used to 197 evaluate the regression performance of the model by coefficient of determination (R2), root 198 mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) (18). The feature importance of 199 the regression model was extracted from the model with \u2018importance_type=gain\u2019. 200\n201 Implementation 202\nThe algorithm was written in Python 3, and machine learning was employed via the Python 203 Scikit-learn package (52), Imbalanced-learn package (53), and XGBoost package (41). The 204 source code and documentation of Putative-iM-Searcher are available at 205 https://github.com/YANGB1/Putative-iM-Searcher. Combining the classification model and 206 regression model, we built a computational tool called iM-Seeker, which is available at 207 https://github.com/YANGB1/iM-Seeker. 208\n209 Biophysical Characterisation of C-rich DNA sequences 210 The test oligonucleotides were synthesised and reverse phase HPLC purified by Eurogentec 211 (Belgium) and were resuspended in ultra-pure water. The DNA final concentration was 212 confirmed via Nanodrop. Samples were prepared as 10 \u00b5M DNA in 10 mM sodium cacodylate 213 (NaCaco) and 100 mM KCl buffer with the range of pH 4-8. The DNA samples were annealed 214 prior to biophysical characterisation by denaturing the DNA for 5 mins at 95\u00b0C and allowing 215 to reanneal by slowly cooling down to room temperature, overnight. 216\nThe CD spectra of the annealed C-rich sequences were recorded on a JASCO 1500 217 spectropolarimeter under a constant flow of nitrogen. An accumulation of four CD spectra 218 scans was acquired from 200-320 nm at 20\u00b0C with a data pitch of 0.5 nm, scanning speed of 219 200 nm/min with 1 second response time, 1 nm bandwidth, and 200 mdeg sensitivity. The 220 measured DNA samples and buffer at corresponding pH were subtracted before zero 221 correction at 320 nm. The transitional pH (pHT) was determined by plotting the measured 222 ellipticity at 288 nm and pH range and the resulting inflection point of the Boltzmann 223 sigmoidal or bi-phase sigmoidal fit using Graphpad Prism (Version 10.1.0.316). 224\nThe CD samples at pH 5.5 were diluted in the same buffer to 2.5 \u00b5M final DNA 225 concentration. These samples were used to perform UV spectroscopy to obtain the thermal 226 difference spectra (TDS) and determine the melting temperature (TM), annealing temperature 227 (TA) and their respective hysteresis (TH). For melting/annealing experiments, the absorbance at 228 295 nm was measured at every 1\u00b0C increase/decrease in three cycles of denaturation and 229 reannealing. The cycle begins with 10 mins at 4\u00b0C followed by gradual increase of 0.5\u00b0C/min 230 to 95\u00b0C (melting). Once the final temperature was reached, the samples were kept at 95\u00b0C for 231 10 mins before reversing the process (annealing). The melting and annealing temperatures 232 were determined via the first derivative method of for each measured cycle as previously 233\ndescribed (54). The samples were kept at 4\u00b0C after the completion of the final reannealing 234 cycle. For the thermal difference spectra (TDS), these samples were used to obtain the 235 absorbance spectrum (230-320 nm). The samples were kept at 4\u00b0C for an additional 10 mins 236 before measuring the absorbance spectrum of potentially folded iMs. This was followed by a 237 second absorbance spectrum after 10 mins at 95\u00b0C for the unstructured DNA structure. 238 Individual TDS signatures were determined by subtracting both absorbance spectra (unfolded-239 folded DNA structure), zero correcting at 320 nm, and finally normalisation to the maximum 240 absorbance to 1 as previously described (24). 241\n242\nRESULTS 243 Description of the iM-Seeker framework 244 iM-Seeker is a computational framework using machine learning to predict the folding status 245 and folding strength of iMs. The outline of the whole iM-Seeker structure is shown in Figure 246 1. The Putative-iM-Searcher was developed to discover the putative iM forming sequences 247 (Figure 1A). Putative-iM-Searcher constructs a directed graph model and obtains 248 representative conformation from all DNA structure conformations based on the configuration 249 of overlapping & non-overlapping strategy, greedy & non-greedy strategy, and 250 representative-conformation-selection strategy. The Balanced Random Forest classification 251 model and XGBoost regression model were trained on iMab-based genome-wide iM 252 landscape and biophysical experimental justified iM with pHT, respectively, for the folding 253 status prediction and folding strength estimation (Figure 1B). The workflow of iM-Seeker after 254 receiving the query sequences is shown in Figure 1C. Putative-iM-Searcher was applied to 255 query sequences to find putative iM forming sequences in the first stage. For each putative iM 256 individual, the Balanced Random Forest classification model will be used to predict the folding 257 status. Next, an estimated folding strength score was calculated by the XGBoost regression 258 model for putative iM individuals. 259\n268\niM-Seeker predicts iM structure folding status 269\nPutative iM forming sequences in the intersected high-confident iM-peak regions among 270 three biological replicates from the CUT&Tag sequencing data were defined as folded iMs 271 while unfolded C-rich sequences can be found in interval regions. For greedy and non-272 overlapped two classification datasets, they both included 8,837 folded iMs and 733,115 273 unfolded C-rich sequences while 9,641 folded iMs and 755,747 unfolded C-rich sequences 274 were in non-greedy and non-overlapped two datasets. 275\n276 Thirty-three features from labelled folded and unfolded putative iM sequences were derived. 277 A five-fold cross-validation assessment was applied on nine classifiers on four classification 278 datasets to select the best dataset and model. Considering the mean AUROC score and mean 279 balanced accuracy of five folds, Balanced Random Forest performed best in all four datasets 280 because the balanced learning strategy can better fit our imbalanced datasets. Thus, Balanced 281 Random Forest was selected as the final classifier. Greedy and non-overlapped two datasets 282 outperformed the non-greedy and non-overlapped datasets in terms of the two indicators. 283 Although there is no significant difference between conformation A and B for greedy and non-284 overlapped datasets, both AUROC and balanced accuracy of conformation A were found to be 285 higher than B (Figure 2A). Thus, we chose conformation A dataset of greedy and non-286 overlapped strategy as final dataset for classification task. 287\n288 The whole dataset was divided into the training & validation set (90%) and test set (10%) 289 because the whole dataset contains ~740,000 data items, test set with ~74,000 (10%) data 290 items is enough to test the model performance. The Balanced Random Forest model was 291 optimised by cross-validation and grid search on training & validation set. We evaluated the 292 model performance on the test set with 81% accuracy, 77% recall, 81% specificity, and 87% 293 AUROC score, which show the model can achieve good performance in both folded iMs and 294 unfolded C-rich sequences (Figure 2B). Besides, we assessed the model\u2019s generalisation 295 performance through five-fold cross-validation deployed across the entire dataset on AUROC 296 (Figure 2C). The AUROC scores on all five folds are all higher than 0.8, which shows the excellent 297 generalisation performance. 298\niM-Seeker measures the iM structure stability 310 The literature-derived data (Supplementary Table S1) and the experimental biophysical data 311 (Supplementary Table S2) were combined to a collection of 206 C-rich DNA sequences with 312 their corresponding pHT values. The comparison of CD spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, and 313 TDS between representative iM forming sequence and representative non-iM forming 314 sequence shows the reliability of our experiments (Supplementary Figure S1). However, one 315 study contained 196 different sequences which contained only C and T. To avoid bias, these 316\nDNA sequences were excluded to avoid misinterpretation of the importance of different 317 nucleotides in the loops. 171 data items were selected as high-confident iM-containing items 318 from 206 items based on criteria including TDS (Supplementary Data Set 1). After filtering data 319 items with the same putative iM but different pHT and combining iM items with the same 320 putative iM and equal pHT from high-confident data items, 120 putative iMs were extracted 321 from the remaining sequence segments using the consistent Putative-iM-Searcher strategies 322 (greedy, non-overlapped, and conformation A) with classification session followed by feature 323 selection (Supplementary Data Set 2). The 120 pHT values standardized and rescaled to range 324 from 0 to 1 via min-max scaling to define iM folding stability. 325\n326 A five-fold cross-validation assessment was applied to thirteen regressors on regression 327 datasets to find the model. Considering the mean of three indicators (R2, RMSE, and MAE) on 328 five-folds, XGBoost was selected as the final model because of the best performance (Table 1). 329 The whole dataset was divided into training & validation set with 80% data and test set 330 containing the remaining data. After optimization using cross-validation and grid search on 331 training & validation set, the final XGBoost model was applied to the test set to assess the 332 performance. R2, RMSE, and MAE can reach 0.642, 0.104, and 0.08, respectively, which shows 333 the model can achieve good performance in estimating the folding strength (Figure 3). The 334 Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) also reveals a strong correlation between measured and 335 predicted folding strength (p<10-7). 336\n337\n338 339\n340\n341\n342\n343\n344\n345\n346\n347\n354 Model interpretation provides insights into important features for iM stability 355\nWe investigated the relative importance of the iM features extracted from the regression model. 356 Features with high importance contribute more to the construction of the model and may play a more 357 crucial role in iM formation than features with low importance. We divided the features into two groups 358 based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC): features with positive PCC were assumed to 359 strengthen iM formation (Supplementary Table S3). In contrast, negative-correlated features were 360 supposed to have a negative effect (Supplementary Table S4). In each group, the top 10 critical features 361 are shown in Figure 4. Nucleotide composition affects the stability of iM structures. Stable iMs prefer to 362 contain more C and T, especially T in side loops (Figure 4A). High G density and A density are associated 363 with unstable iMs, especially these two nucleotides in side loops (Figure 4B). In addition, the C-tract 364 length and loop length are two dominant features in all length-relative features. Long C-tract and short 365 loop length can help with iM stability. Previous studies showed that in the same experimental condition, 366 iMs with long C-tracts tend to be more stable than iMs with short C-tracts (55,56). 367\n372\nDISCUSSION 373\nUnlike the computational prediction of G4 structures, iMs are more complex in terms of what 374 makes them stable (8,27,29,57-60) and it has been difficult to make predictions about iMs in 375 the same way as G4s. Although, putative iMs have a similar sequence pattern to G4s, the 376 stability of the structures has been more difficult to predict, as it has been shown that iMs can 377 tolerate changes in sequence more than G4s (29), but are overall less stable in general. 378 Therefore, iM-specific experimental data is critical to construct accurate computational models 379 for iM prediction and stability. To the best of our knowledge, there are no iM-specific 380 computational tools. Due to the similarity in sequence patterns between G4 and iM, some 381 previous software developed for G4 can be used on putative iM searching and can calculate a 382 numeric value to estimate iM (8,14,22) but there was no iM-specific experimental results which 383 were fed into models to help with model design and training. In this paper, we developed both 384\na putative iM-forming sequence searching tool, Putative-iM-Searcher, and a machine learning 385 approach to prediction of DNA iM folding status and folding strength, iM-Seeker. We 386 considered that the identification of putative iM forming sequences, their folding status and 387 folding strength were three significant parts of iM investigation that could benefit from 388 computational predictions. Putative-iM-Searcher can construct directed graphs based on 389 different configurations, can search all putative iM formations and conformations by graph 390 traversal from input DNA sequences. Users can choose to set parameters including C-tract 391 length, the first loop length, the second loop length, and the third loop length. The 392 representative conformations can be obtained based on overlapping & non-overlapping 393 strategy, greedy & non-greedy strategy, and representative-conformation strategy. Users can 394 choose to obtain all putative iM formations and conformations as well. Based on the detected 395 putative iMs by Putative-iM-Searcher, we used genome-wide CUT&Tag sequencing data and 396 experimental data with pHT from previous studies and our experiments to develop iM-Seeker. 397 This is the first time a machine learning approach has been applied to classification of this 398 specific DNA structure motif and will significantly improve the accuracy of in silco iM prediction. 399 The iMab antibody-based CUT&Tag sequencing data presents the folding status of C-rich 400 sequences and iM-Seeker captures the difference between features in both folded iMs and 401 unfolded C-rich sequences and allows for classification. Another regression model was trained 402 on iM sequences derived from biophysical data, corresponding sequence with pHT to measure 403 the folding strength. 404\niM-Seeker has good performance on both classification and regression tasks. The Balanced 405 Random Forest classifier has higher performance in the imbalanced dataset. The number of 406 folded iMs (8,837 iMs) is much less than unfolded motifs (733,115 iMs), which can mislead the 407 classifier to overfit the unfolded dataset and classify folded iMs into unfolded category 408 incorrectly. However, Balanced Random Forest is a decision-tree-based ensemble learning 409 model that employs an under-sampling strategy to avoid overfitting of unfolded samples. 410 Therefore, both folded samples and unfolded samples have good performance (recall 77%; 411 specificity 81%). XGBoost, another ensemble learning approach which was also used in the G4 412 classification mission (18), is selected for the estimation of folding strength among thirteen 413 regressors. Although the number of data items for the regression model is limited, the 414 regression part of iM-Seeker can also provide a reliable reference to evaluate the iM strength 415\n(R2 0.642; RMSE 0.104; MAE 0.08). Previous studies investigated the iM formation features 416 which can influence the iM strength by biophysical characterisation. The length of C-tracts, 417 short loop length and high density of C and T can enhance the formation of iMs because other 418 strong structures can be formed with G and A, which can result in the competition between 419 iM and other structure motifs (8,55,56,61,62). Important features extracted from the regression 420 model revealed a consistent result with previous research, which also justifies the reliability of 421 our model. However, the stabilising effect of additional thymines is now quite well 422 documented and consistent with the results observed here (29,63). Also the competition 423 between guanines and cytosines were previously used in G4-hunter (14) as a scoring factor as 424 having the complementary base within the sequences can skew structure formation towards 425 hairpin (29). 426\n427\niM-Seeker offers users the opportunity for a dedicated iM-searching tool, which is based on 428 machine learning from existing datasets. The approach could be applied to other DNA and 429 RNA structures where there is a wide range of data available, for example to further increase 430 the accuracy of prediction of formation of G4 structures. 431\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA 432 Supplementary Data are available at NAR online. 433 434 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 435 This research was partly supported by the Norwich Bioscience Institutes Partnership\u2019s Computing 436 infrastructure for Science (CiS) group through the provision of a High-Performance Computing Cluster 437 and the John Innes Centre Informatics team. 438 439 FUNDING 440\nThis work was supported by the United Kingdom Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research 441 Council (BBSRC) [BB/X01102X/1] (BY, HY, YD); [BB/W000962/1] (DG, ZW, YD); BBSRC Norwich Research 442 Park Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership [2578674] (BY); European Research Council (ERC) 443 [selected by the ERC, funded by BBSRC Horizon Europe Guarantee [EP/Y009886/1] (YD); Human Frontier 444 Science Program Fellowship [LT001077/2021-L] (HY);. 445\n446\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST 447 The authors declare no competing financial interest. 448 449 450 REFERENCES 451 452 1.
