            "text": "Gunther and Hartnell [1] introduced the idea of modeling a spy network by a graph whose vertices represent the spies and whose edges represent their connection. If a spy is arrested, the spies who are in direct contact with them are unreliable; therefore, some new graphical parameters such as vertex neighbor connectivity [1] and edge neighbor connectivity [2] were introduced to measure the invulnerability of networks under the \u201cneighbor\u201d case. Observing that the behavior of spies in a spy network is similar to the spread of biological viruses in social networks, we introduced edge neighbor scattering number (ENS) [3] and vertex neighbor scattering number (VNS) [4]. It is shown that they are alternative invulnerability measures of the above networks. Since removing some vertices (or edges) from a graph, all of their adjacent vertices (or edges) are removed simultaneously, we call ENS and VNS neighbor invulnerability parameters. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and e \u2208 V(G). The open-edge neighborhood of e is defined N(e) = { f \u2208 E(G)| f 6= e, e and f are adjacent}. The closed-edge neighborhood of e is N[e] = N(e) \u222a {e}. An edge e is said to be subverted when N[e] and the two endvertices of e are deleted from G. We call S an edge subversion strategy of G if S \u2286 E(G) and each of the edges in S is subverted from G. The survival subgraph is denoted by G/S. An edge subversion strategy S is called an edge cut strategy of G if G/S is disconnected, or is a single vertex, or is .\nThe edge neighbor scattering number of a connected graph G is defined as [3] ENS(G) = max\nS\u2286E(G) {c(G/S)\u2212 |S|}, where S is any edge cut strategy of G, and c(G/S) is the number of the components of G/S. We call S\u2217 \u2286 E(G) a ENS-set of G if ENS(G) = c(G/S\u2217)\u2212 |S\u2217|.\nAxioms 2022, 11, 248. https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms11060248 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms\nInspired by the definitions of vertex neighbor connectivity and toughness, we define edge neighbor toughness(ENT) of a connected graph G as tEN(G) = min\nS\u2286E(G) { |S|c(G/S)}, where S\nis any edge cut strategy of G, and c(G/X) is the number of the components of G/S. We call S\u2217(\u2286 E(G)) an tEN-set of G if tEN(G) = |S \u2217 | c(G/S\u2217) . In this paper, we prove that the computation problem of edge neighbor toughness of a graph is NP-complete. We also give a polynomial algorithm of the ENT of trees, which is a class of special and important graphs. Throughout this paper, we consider the simple, undirected graphs, and use Bondy and Murty [5] for terminologies and notations not defined here."

            "text": "Clearly, it is of prime importance to determine the edge neighbor toughness of a graph when this parameter is used to measure the neighbor invulnerability of a network. In this section, we give the edge neighbor toughness of several basic graphs.\nTheorem 1. Let Pn be a path of order n(\u2265 3). Then\ntEN(Pn) = {\n1, if n = 3; 1 2 , if n \u2265 4.\nProof. The case n = 3 is trivial. When n \u2265 4, for any edge cut strategy S, c(Pn/S) \u2264 |S|+ 1. We thus have tEN(Pn) \u2265 |S||S|+1 . Let f (x) = xx+1 be a function of variate x, where x \u2208 Z+. When x = 1, f (x) reaches its minimum value 12 . So, we have tEN(Pn) \u2265 12 . On the other hand, let e = uv be an edge of Pn such that d(u) = d(v) = 2. Then {e} is an edge cut strategy of Pn and c(Pn/{e}) = 2. By the definition of ENT, we have tEN(Pn) \u2264 |{e}|c(Pn/{e}) = 1 2 .\nTherefore, tEN(Pn) = 12 .\nTheorem 2. Let Cn be a cycle of order n(\u2265 3). Then\ntEN(Cn) = {\n2, if n = 4, 5; 1, if n = 3 or n \u2265 6.\nProof. n = 3, 4, 5 is trivial. When n \u2265 6, for any edge cut strategy S of Cn, c(Cn/S) \u2264 |S|, we have tEN(Cn) \u2265 1. On the other hand, there must exist two edges e, f \u2208 V(Cn) such that {e, f } is an edge cut strategy of Cn and c(Cn/{e, f }) = 2. By the definition of ENT, we have tEN(Cn) \u2264 |{e, f }| c(Cn/{e, f }) = 1. Therefore, tEN(Cn) = 1.\nTheorem 3. Let Kn be a complete graph of order n(\u2265 3). Then tEN(Kn) = b n2 c.\nProof. Observe that for any e \u2208 E(Kn), Kn/{e} = Kn\u22122. Cozzens [6] proved that the edge neighbor connectivity of Kn is b n2 c; therefore, if S is an edge cut strategy of Kn, then |S| \u2265 b n2 c, and c(Kn/S) \u2264 1. By the definition of ENT, we have tEN(Kn) \u2265 |S| c(Kn/S)\n\u2265 b n2 c. On the other hand, if n is even, let M = {u1v1, u2v2, . . . , u n2 v n2 } be a maximum match-\ning of Kn. Replace u1v1 by u1v2, denote M \u2032 = (M\u2212 {u1v1}) \u222a {u1v2}. Then Kn/M \u2032 = v1. By the definition of ENT, we have tEN(Kn) \u2264 |M \u2032 |\nc(Kn/M \u2032 ) = b n2 c. If n is odd, then there exists\na maximum matching M in Kn such that |M| = n\u221212 = b n2 c and Kn/M is an isolated vertex. So we have tEN(Kn) \u2264 b n2 c, too.\nTherefore, tEN(Kn) = b n2 c.\nTheorem 4. Let Kn1,n2,...,np be a complete p-partite graph with vertex partition (X1, X2, . . . , Xp). Assume |Xi| = ni, i = 1, 2, . . . , p, p \u2265 2 and np \u2265 np\u22121 \u2265 . . . \u2265 n1. Then\ntVN(Kn1,n2,...,np) = 1\nnp ( p\u22121 \u2211 i=1 ni \u2212 \u03b1 \u2032 ).\nwhere \u03b1 \u2032\nis the matching number of Kn1,n2,...,np\u22121 .\nProof. For convenience, denote Kn1,n2,...,np as G. Obviously, for any edge cut strategy, S, of G, if G/S 6= , then there exists some i such that all the vertices of G/S are included in Ni. Let S\u2217 be a tEN-set of G. It is not difficult to know that c(G/S\u2217) = np and S\u2217 \u2282 E(G\u2212 Xp) such that (G\u2212 Xp)/S\u2217 = . Let M\u2217 be a maximum matching of G\u2212Xp(that is, Kn1,n2,...,np\u22121), and U = {u1, u2, . . . , uk} be the unsaturated vertex set under M\u2217. Then {u1v1, u2v2, . . . , ukvk} \u222aM\u2217 is a tEN-set of G, where v1, v2, . . . , vk are arbitrary k vertices in V(G)\u2212 Xp \u2212U. Since the unsaturated vertex number in G\u2212 Xp is p\u22121 \u2211\ni=1 ni \u2212 2|M\u2217|, we have tVN(Kn1,n2,...,np) = 1np (\np\u22121 \u2211\ni=1 ni \u2212 \u03b1\n\u2032 ).\nRemark 1. If Kn1,n2,...,np\u22121 has a perfect matching, then tVN(Kn1,n2,...,np) = n 2np \u2212 1 2 , where n = p \u2211\ni=1 ni and np \u2265 np\u22121 \u2265 . . . \u2265 n1.\nExample 1. Let S1,n\u22121 be a star of order n. Then tEN(S1,n\u22121) = 1n\u22122 .\nA comet, denoted by Cn,k, is a graph by coinciding an end vertex of path Pn\u2212k with the center vertex of a star S1,k, where 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u2212 2 and n \u2265 4. The order of comet Cn,k is n, and the center of S1,k is called the center of Cn,k.\nTheorem 5. Let Cn,k be a comet, where 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u2212 3 and n \u2265 4. Then tEN(Cn,k) = 1k+1 .\nProof. Let V(Pn\u2212k) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn\u2212k}, and v1 be the center of Cn,k. Obviously, if S is an edge cut strategy of Cn,k, then |S| \u2265 1. Moreover, for any edge cut strategy S, c(Cn,k/S) \u2264 k + |S| and the function f (x) = xx+k (x \u2208 Z+) is decreased with x, we then have tEN(Cn,k) \u2265 1k+1 . On the other hand, since {v1v2} is an edge cut strategy of Cn,k, and c(Cn,k/{v1v2}) = k + 1, by the definition of ENT, we have tEN(Cn,k) \u2264 1k+1 .\nTherefore, tEN(Cn,k) = 1k+1 , and we complete the proof."

EDGE NEIGHBOR TOUGHNESS Instance: An undirected graph G; a positive rational number t. Question: Does there exist an edge cut strategy S of G such that |S|c(G/S) \u2264 t?\nWe solve this problem by considering the following\nProblem 2. EDGE DOMINATION SET Instance: A bipartite graph G; a positive integer d. Question: Does there exist an edge dominating set D of G such that |D| \u2264 d?\nIt was proved by Yannakakis and Gavril [7] that Problem 2 is NP-complete. Based on this conclusion, we prove that Problem 1 is NP-complete by reducing Problem 2 to a special case of Problem 1.\nTheorem 6. EDGE NEIGHBOR TOUGHNESS is NP-complete.\nProof. Clearly, EDGE NEIGHBOR TOUGHNESS is in the class NP, since a nondeterministic algorithm need only guess an edge cut strategy S \u2286 E(G) and check in polynomial time that |S|c(G/S) \u2264 t. Let G = (V, E) be a bipartite graph of order n. Denote V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. Replace each vertex vi \u2208 V by a copy of the complete graph Kn, denote this copy by Gi. Choose a vertex from Gi, v\u2217i , add edges v \u2217 i v \u2217 j if vivj \u2208 E, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Denote the resulting graph by G\u2217. Denote the subgraph induced by {v\u22171 , v\u22172 , . . . , v\u2217n} in G\u2217 as G \u2032 . Obviously, G\n\u2032 \u223c= G. Let D be a smallest edge dominating set of G and S\u2217 be an ENS-set of G\u2217. In [8], we proved the following claims.\nFact 1. If e is an edge in Gi, which is not incident with v\u2217i , then e 6\u2208 S\u2217, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nFact 2. Let E\u2217i = {e : e \u2208 E(Gi) and e be incident with v\u2217i }. Then |E\u2217i \u2229 S\u2217| \u2264 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nFact 3. There exists a tEN-set S of G\u2217 such that E(G\u2217/S) \u2229 E(G \u2032 ) = and S \u2286 E(G\u2032).\nFrom the above claims, we conclude that tEN(G\u2217) = |D| n . By the construction of G \u2217\nand the NP-completeness of Problem 2, this is sufficient for the conclusion.\nTheorem 7. Let T be a tree with order n(\u22654). Then tEN(T) = 1d\u22122 , where d = max (u,v)\u2208E(T) {d(u) + d(v)}.\nProof. Let e\u2217 = u\u2217v\u2217 \u2208 E(T) such that d = d(u\u2217) + d(v\u2217) = max (u,v)\u2208E(T) {d(u) + d(v)}. Since n \u2265 4, {e\u2217} is an edge cut strategy of T and |{e\u2217}|c(T/{e\u2217}) = 1d\u22122 . Assume that S \u2282 E(T) is any nonempty edge cut strategy of T. By the selection of e\u2217, we have\n|S| c(T/S) \u2265 |S| \u2211\ne\u2208S c(T/{e} \u2265\n|S| |S|\u03c9(T/{e\u2217}) = 1 d\u2212 2 .\nTherefore, by the definition of ENT, {e\u2217} is a tEN-set of T, and tEN(T) = 1d\u22122 . The proof is completed.\nLet T be a tree of order n(\u2265 4), V(T) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and M(T) = (mij)n\u00d7(n\u22121) be\nits incident matrix. Then d(vi) = n\u22121 \u2211\nj=1 mij, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nBased on the above results, we give an algorithm for the problem of computing the ENT of trees.\nInput A tree T = (V; E). Output tEN(T) and the corresponding tEN-set. Step 1. Compute the degree d(v) for each vertex v \u2208 V(T); Step 2. Compute de = d(u) + d(v) for each edge e = uv \u2208 E(T); Step 3. Search an edge e\u2217 = u\u2217v\u2217 satisfying d = d(u\u2217)+ d(v\u2217) = max\ne\u2208E(T) de, output tEN(T) =\n1 d\u22122 and a tEN-set {u\u2217v\u2217}.\nA graph-theoretic algorithm is good if the number of computational steps for its implementation on any graph is bounded above by a polynomial in the order and the size of the graph [5]. We show that the above algorithm is good by the following complexity analysis. Computing the degree for each vertex requires n\u2212 2 additions, so the computations involved in step 1 require n(n\u2212 2) additions. Computing de = d(u) + d(v) for an edge\nAxioms 2022, 11, 248 5 of 6\nuv \u2208 E(T) requires 1 additions only. Since T is a tree, m = n\u2212 1, step 2 requires (n\u2212 1) additions. To find the edge e\u2217 = u\u2217v\u2217, it is sufficient to sort the n\u2212 1 number de; therefore, step 3, in the worst case, requires (n\u2212 1) log(n\u2212 1) comparisons (Quick Sort Algorithm). It is well known that a comparison or an addition is a basic computational unit. So, the total number of computations of this algorithm is approximately n(n\u2212 2) + (n\u2212 1) + (n\u2212 1) log(n\u2212 1), and thus is of order n2.\nRemark 2. If the adjacency list is used instead of the incidence matrix, the complexity can be lowered to O(n)."

Search an edge e\u2217 = (u\u2217, v\u2217) satisfying d = d(u\u2217)+ d(v\u2217) = max\ne\u2208E(T ) de, output tEN (T ) =\n1 d\u22122 and a tEN -set {(u\u2217, v\u2217)}, stop.\nA graph-th oretic algorithm is good if the number of computational steps required for its\nimplementation on any graph G is bounded above by a polynomial in n andm, where n = |V (G)| and m = |E(G)| represent the order and the size of G, respectively[7]. We show that the above algorithm is good by the follows complexity analysis.\nComputing the degree for each vertex requires n\u22121 additions, so the computations involved in step 1 require n(n \u2212 1) additions. Computing de = d(u) + d(v) for an edge (u, v) \u2208 E(T ) requires 1 additions only. Since T is a tree, m = n \u2212 1 the computations involved in step 2 require (n\u2212 1) additions. To find an edge e\u2217 = (u\u2217, v\u2217), it is sufficient to sort the n\u2212 1 number de : e \u2208 E(T ). The computations involved in step 3, in the worst case, require a total of 1 2(n\u2212 1)(n\u2212 2) comparisons.\nIf we regard either a comparison or an addition as a basic computational unit, the total\nnumber of computations required for this algorithm is approximately n(n\u2212 1)+ (n\u2212 1)+ 12(n\u2212 1)(n\u2212 2) = 32(n2 \u2212 n), and thus is of order n2.\n4 Concluding remarks\nThe concept of ENT and ENS are defined well, and these two neighbor invulnerability parameters\nare independent each other. Thi can be illustrated by the follows examples.\ns\nExample 2 Consider the comet C10,3 and G1(see figure 1 (a)). They have the equal order 10,\nvertex neighbor-connectivity 1, edge neighbor-connectivity 1, and edge neighbor-toughness 14 .\n6\nFigure 1. Two graphs with order 10."

            "text": "The above two examples also show that the parameters ENT and ENS have their own characteristics and advantages when measuring the neighbor invulnerability of networks. Network invulnerability is an important problem in graph theory. Many parameters have been introduced to measure the relationship of invulnerability and structure of networks; however, there exist a lot of unresolved problems about the parameters computing [3,9,10]. Since trees have special structure and wide range of applications [11,12], the polynomial algorithm of ENT of trees has a certain theoretical and practical significance. Observing the conclusion of Theorem 4, it is easy to know that the matching number of the complete p-partite graph Kn1,n2,...,np is determined by the numbers n1, n2, . . . , np; therefore, to find a maximum matching of Kn1,n2,...,np is equivalent to divide {1, 2, . . . , p} into two nonempty subset N1 and N2 such that | \u2211\ni\u2208N1 ni \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208N2 nj| is as small as possible.\nLater, we will consider this integer programming and related problems. Furthermore, the algorithm and the bound of ENT for graphs of general structure are also worth considering.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, original draft preparation, F.X., W.Z.; review and editing, Y.Y.
