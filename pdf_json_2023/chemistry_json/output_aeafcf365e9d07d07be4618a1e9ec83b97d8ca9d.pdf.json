    "abstractText": "Removal of heavy metal pollution is an endless topic, because heavy metals can cause irreversible damage to the human body and environment. It is urgent to develop novel materials for detection and adsorption of heavy metal ions. In this paper, waste wolfberry straw was utilized as a carbon source, and two simple methods were developed to successfully prepare activated carbon (AC) and carbon quantum dots (CQDs). The fabrication conditions were optimized by adjusting the mass ratio of precursor to activator, type of activator and activation times. When sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was selected as an activator (6 : 1, mass ratio of NaOH to AC-precursor), and the activation was performed at 600 \u00b0C for 1 h, the highest specific surface area of the obtained AC-NaOH-3 reached 3016 m g\u22121. The adsorption capacity for copper ions (Cu) reached 68.06 mg g\u22121. The preparation conditions for CQDs were also optimized by adjusting the concentration of wolfberry stem, reaction time and temperature. When the wolfberry stem concentration was 7.5 g L\u22121, and the activation was performed at 200 \u00b0C for 24 h, the obtained CQDs exhibited strong fluorescence emission in the blank and 12 kinds of metal ion solutions, respectively, however, the fluorescence intensity was remarkably decreased after adding Cu. In the range of 10\u2013 80 nM, the linear correlation coefficient between the concentration of Cu and fluorescence intensity of CQDs was 0.992, and the limit of detection was 2.83 nmol L\u22121. Thus, these two kinds of materials were prepared from wolfberry stem, which opened up a new way for the application in adsorption and detection of copper ions.",

It is urgent to develop novel materials for detection and adsorption of\nheavy metal ions. In this paper, waste wolfberry straw was utilized as a carbon source, and two simple\nmethods were developed to successfully prepare activated carbon (AC) and carbon quantum dots\n(CQDs). The fabrication conditions were optimized by adjusting the mass ratio of precursor to activator,\ntype of activator and activation times. When sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was selected as an activator (6 : 1,\nmass ratio of NaOH to AC-precursor), and the activation was performed at 600 \u00b0C for 1 h, the highest specific surface area of the obtained AC-NaOH-3 reached 3016 m2 g\u22121. The adsorption capacity for copper ions (Cu2+) reached 68.06 mg g\u22121. The preparation conditions for CQDs were also optimized by\nadjusting the concentration of wolfberry stem, reaction time and temperature. When the wolfberry stem concentration was 7.5 g L\u22121, and the activation was performed at 200 \u00b0C for 24 h, the obtained CQDs\nexhibited strong fluorescence emission in the blank and 12 kinds of metal ion solutions, respectively, however, the fluorescence intensity was remarkably decreased after adding Cu2+. In the range of 10\u2013 80 nM, the linear correlation coefficient between the concentration of Cu2+ and fluorescence intensity of CQDs was 0.992, and the limit of detection was 2.83 nmol L\u22121. Thus, these two kinds of materials\nwere prepared from wolfberry stem, which opened up a new way for the application in adsorption and\ndetection of copper ions."

Industrial wastewater is mainly discharged into rivers and lakes, producing a plethora of heavy metals.1 Most heavy metals are difficult to degrade naturally, which has a signicant impact on the natural ecosystem.2,3 Copper ions (Cu2+), a most common heavy metal ion, can be released into the environment through industrial and human activities. Once Cu2+ is taken into the human body and accumulates, it can cause health hazards and diseases such as liver failure and heart damage and even death.

According to relevant reports,12,13 in most situations, adsorption is the most effective method.

On the hand, biomass is a promising source of carbon for the preparation of AC, because the biowastes from agriculture can be recycled so that the economy can be saved and the environment can be protected.15 On the other hand, detecting heavy metals in the environment is also essential to controlling heavy metal pollution. There are several detection methods by using UV-vis spectrophotometry, ion exchange chromatography, ame atomic absorption spectrophotometry and so on.16 However, they generally require high instrumental costs and complicated detection operations. Therefore, metal ion sensor platforms have received much attention in recent years, for instance, organic molecules, nanoparticles and carbon dots (CQDs). CQDs, as a kind of novel carbon nanomaterials, have attracted great attention since their discovery in 2004, due to their excellent hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, high electrical conductivity, low toxicity and controlled uorescence property.17 Licona-Aguilar et al. synthesized AC with sugarcane bagasse and orange peel as raw materials in acidic medium (H3PO4, 85 wt%) employing a physicochemical activation method. The prepared AC could remove 94% of Pb2+ and 85.1% of Cu2+.18 Malti et al. utilized citrus Sinensis peel as a carbon source and H2O2 as an activator to prepare biochar and achieved a maximum theoretical adsorption capacity of 11.36 mg g\u22121 of Cu2+ in water.19 Zhu et al.17 synthesized uorescent CQDs by a simple two-step method with biomass lignin as the carbon source, which had a signicant selective uorescence quenching effect on Fe3+. These researches offer us hints to fabricate more functional materials of AC or CQDs with biomass resources.\nChinese wolerry is abundantly distributed in Ningxia, Qinghai and Xinjiang Province, China. Amongst others, wolfberry can be used as raw material to obtain nitrogen doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQD) by green preparation methods. These N-CQDs have been developed as a highly sensitive uorescent \u2018on\u2013off\u2019 switch sensor for the detection of Fe3+ and Lascorbic acid. Wolerry stems as a by-product of wolerry has never been used in a rational and high value way.20 In this work, both uorescent CQDs and biomass AC with high specic surface area were fabricated with wolerry stems as carbon\nFig. 1 Schematic preparation of CQDs and AC from wolfberry stem.\n21200 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 21199\u201321210\nsource, which can offer an alternative to wastewater treatment, as shown in Fig. 1. The obtained CQDs were applied in ultrasensitive detection of Cu2+, while AC could be utilized for adsorption of copper ions."

Of these, activation is an important preparation step that directly changes the pore structure of AC as well as the content of the surface functional groups, so choosing a suitable activator is a key step in the successful manufacture of AC. Therefore, three kinds of activators (NaOH,\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nKOH and ZnCl2) were chosen in our experiments. To screen the optimal conditions, this study measured the specic surface area, total pore volume, and pore width of AC by nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption method. The detailed results are summarized in Table 1.\nAC-precursor is the product of carbonization from wolerry stem, which exhibited a specic surface area of 245 m2 g\u22121, pore volume of 0.13 cm3 g\u22121, and micropore volume of only 0.07 cm3 g\u22121. Aer activation with NaOH, KOH or ZnCl2, the products were achieved under the same conditions and assigned as ACNaOH-(1\u20134), AC-KOH-(1\u20134), and AC-ZnCl2-(1\u20134), respectively. Both alkaline activators had signicant effects, and the specic surface area of the prepared AC increased gradually with an increase of the mass ratio of activator to precursor (ACprecursor). The specic surface area increased from 737 m2 g\u22121 to 2253 m2 g\u22121, when the mass ratio of NaOH to ACprecursor was increased from 1 : 1 (AC-NaOH-1) to 4 : 1 (ACNaOH-3). The highest specic surface area of AC-NaOH-4 reached 3016 m2 g\u22121, the pore volume reached 1.54 cm3 g\u22121, while the micropore volume reached 0.74 cm3 g\u22121. The specic surface area slightly increased to 328 m2 g\u22121 aer activation with the ratio of KOH to AC-precursor of 1 : 1 (AC-KOH-1), and the activation effect reached the most effective when the ratio of activator to AC-precursor was increased to 4 : 1 (AC-KOH-3), exhibiting high specic surface area of 2102 m2 g\u22121. However, further increasing the ratio of activator to AC-precursor (6 : 1), the specic surface area decreased to 1459 m2 g\u22121 (AC-KOH-4). So too much activator could not fully activate the AC-precursor. Both ACs possessed mainly microporous structure aer activation, and the microporosity occupied more than 50% of total pore volume. Obviously, KOH was more alkaline and corrosive than NaOH, and the physical structure of AC was seriously destroyed during the activation process. ZnCl2, as common activator, did not affect the material in this study. There was a decrease of specic surface area down to 32m2 g\u22121. As a result, the nal activation effect is signicantly inuenced by the use of different activators. ZnCl2 as neutral salt has little effect on this study, while NaOH owns the strongest activation ability.\nActivation temperature and time are essential factors in determining nal physical structure of AC. The effects of activation temperature and time on properties of AC were investigated, as shown in Table 1. At 400 \u00b0C, the specic surface area was only 17 m2 g\u22121 (AC-NaOH-5) because the temperature was too low for NaOH to achieve activation. When the temperature was increased to 500 \u00b0C, the specic surface area reached 641 m2 g\u22121 (AC-NaOH-6), and when the temperature was increased to 600 \u00b0C, the maximum specic surface area of 2253 m2 g\u22121 (AC-NaOH-3). When the temperature further rose to relatively high temperature of 700 \u00b0C (AC-NaOH-9) or 800 \u00b0C (AC-NaOH10), their physical structure was destroyed, resulting in decrease of specic surface area (1935 or 1899 m2 g\u22121) and pore volume (1.20 or 1.16 cm3 g\u22121). The activation time is an important factor for affecting micropores and mesopores of AC.

Thus, the optimal activation time was 1 h and the activation temperature was 600 \u00b0C.\nSome materials are listed in Table S1.\u2020 Oss et al.21 selected microalgae biomass produced in wastewater treatment plants as a precursor to produce AC, and obtained a specic surface area of 785 m2 g\u22121 by activation at 800 \u00b0C for 160 min. Termite biodiesel could also be prepared as alternative carbon source using KOH as an activator at 900 \u00b0C for 9 h. The specic surface area of as-obtained AC was 1465 m2 g\u22121.22 A. Alazmi et al.23 prepared an AC with a specic surface area of 2344 m2 g\u22121 aer activation by CO2 applied palm seeds as carbon source. The specic surface area of the AC-NaOH-4 prepared in this study was 3016 m2 g\u22121 aer activation with NaOH at 600 \u00b0C. In comparison with the physical and chemical activation described above, the AC produced in our case exhibited higher surface area.\nThe adsorption characteristics of AC and its adsorption effect in actual water samples were studied. The specic operation is as follows: the common metal ions in Cu2+, Fe3+, Cr6+, K+, Na+, Ca2+ are added to domestic water. The adsorption capacity is calculated according to formula S1.\u2020 The results are shown in Table S5.\u2020 AC showed excellent adsorption capacity and extensive adsorption properties.\nFig. S1a and b\u2020 shows the N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of AC-NaOH-3 and ACNaOH-4.

The result is shown in Fig. S4a, b and Table S2.\u2020 The R values of the Langmuir isotherm model for AC-NaOH-3 and AC-NaOH-4 were 0.981 and 0.993, which were higher than those of the Freundlich isotherm model (0.965 and 0.975). The results showed that the adsorption process of AC was more consistent with the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating that the adsorption of Cu2+ by AC was monolayer adsorption, which was similar with other AC.26,27\nThe time of adsorption equilibrium is also an important index to evaluate the adsorption performance, so the adsorption kinetic process is investigated, as shown in Fig. 2b. The adsorption capacity of NaOH-AC-3 reached equilibrium of 50.58 mg g\u22121 aer 60 min, while AC-NaOH-4 reached equilibrium aer 30 min of contact with an adsorption capacity of 59.81 mg g\u22121. In order to investigate the rate of control steps and adsorption mechanisms of the AC adsorption process, pseudo-rst-order and pseudo-second-order models were tted and calculated by eqn S4 and S5.\u2020 So, two kinetic tting results are presented in Fig. S4c, d and Table S3.\u2020 The linear correlation coefficients of the pseudo-second-order kinetic models for both AC (R = 0.999) were much higher than those of the pseudo-rstorder kinetic models (R = 0.566, R = 0.754), conrming the applicability of the pseudo-second-order kinetic model to the observed adsorption behavior. The adsorption may be related to the functional groups and structure of the material. As mentioned above, the surfaces of AC-NaOH-3 and AC-NaOH-4 contained functional groups such as amino group (\u2013NH2), hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) which provide chelating sites for Cu2+, AC-NaOH-4 possessed larger specic surface area and pore volume. Therefore, AC-NaOH-4 could rapidly adsorb Cu2+ capacity in solution, indicating that AC has the ability to rapidly process Cu2+ in water.28,29\nCalculated by eqn S6, as shown in Fig. S4e,\u2020 the segmental t of the intraparticle diffusion model shows that the mass transfer process was characterized by a three-step control of adsorption rate. These three segments represent the thin lm diffusion, mesoporous, and micropore diffusion processes. During the fast adsorption stage, the gradual increase in Cu2+\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nadsorption is attributed to the diffusion of Cu2+ in the pores of the adsorbent, which is an external diffusion-controlled process. The adsorption rates of three stages are kid1 > kid2 > kid3, and the boundary thickness gradually increased during the adsorption process.30,31 In the internal diffusion stage, the adsorption process consists of two stages, a short initial phase characterized by a higher slope and external diffusion phase with lower slopes corresponding to internal diffusion. This suggests that the adsorption of Cu2+ on the adsorbent is a result of the adsorbent being a combination of external diffusion and internal particle diffusion. The adsorption capacities of other ACs were also shown in Table S4.\u2020 Guo et al.32 prepared AC from wheat straw by chemical activation using carbon disulde was used to modify WS by a facile graing method through epichlorohydrin and ethylenediamine. Then, it was used as an adsorbent for the removal of Cu2+ from aqueous solution with a capacity of 57.5 mg g\u22121 at 200 min. Wu et al.33 prepared AC from Walnut shell to adsorb Cu2+ in aqueous polymetallic solutions with a capacity of 32 mg g\u22121 at 40 min. The maximum adsorption capacity of AC prepared from Pinewood as carbon source with H3PO4 as activator was 20 mg g\n\u22121 at 20 min.29 ACNaOH-4 could reach an adsorption capacity of 59 mg g\u22121, indicating the ability to rapidly adsorb Cu2+ from solution and higher adsorption capacity."

The relative QY decreased to 43% and 31% aer increasing the wolerry stem adding concentration to 22.5 and 37.5 g L\u22121. The relative QY increased from 10% to 59% at the reaction time (8 to 24 h) and decreased to 12% aer extending the reaction time to 36 h. When the hydrothermal temperature was increased from 80 to 240 \u00b0C, the relative QY of CQDs also gradually increased to 33%. At shorter heating time and lower hydrothermal temperature, wolerry stem did not decompose sufficiently in the reaction kettle, resulting in the incomplete formation of CQDs.36 Therefore, the optimal condition of CQDs included the hydrothermal temperature of 200 \u00b0C, heating time of 24 h and adding wolfberry stem concentration of 7.5 g L\u22121.\n3.3.2 Morphological and optical properties of CQDs. CQDs were prepared by the hydrothermal method of wolerry stem. It is well known that natural biomass molecules are held together by various chemical bonds. The breaking of chemical bonds, such as hydrogen bonds, provides an excellent incentive to degrade natural biomass into oligomers and microscopic molecules, which contain carboxyl groups, resulting in an acidic solution. The amorphous carbohydrates are further degraded under the conditions of acidity, high temperature and pressure to produce more water-soluble small molecules.37 In the context of high temperature and pressure, small molecules dispersed within an ethanol solution undergo a substantial degree of sp2 hybridization reactions, coupled with carbonization and passivation processes, culminating in the generation of carbon quantum dots at the nano-scale level.38\nTo conrm the structural characteristics of CQDs, the resulting products were analyzed by a series of tests, such as FTIR, XPS and TEM. As shown in Fig. 4a, the peak at 1706 cm\u22121 was assigned to the stretching vibration of C]C, while the strong peak at 1115 cm\u22121 was the deformation vibration of C\u2013H was. Besides, the peaks at 3425, 1706, 1509 and 1215 cm\u22121 manifest the existence of \u2013OH, C]O, C\u2013N and C\u2013O functional\n21204 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 21199\u201321210\ngroups on the surface of CQDs.39,40 The functional groups of CQDs were further characterized by XPS. The C 1s spectrum is shown in Fig. 4b, a strong C]C peak was located at 284.2 eV, and signicant C\u2013O and C]O peaks at 285.7 and 286.4 eV. In the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 4c), two peaks at 531.35 and 533.75 eV was the presence of C]O and C\u2013OH. In the N 1s spectrum (Fig. 4d), three N atom structures, C\u2013N\u2013C (399.3 eV), amine-N (400.1 eV) and graphite-N (400.8 eV), emerged.41 The morphology of synthesized CQDs could be clearly observed in the TEM images (Fig. 5). The zero-dimensional discrete quasispherical nanoparticles were produced, whose particle size was in the range of 1.7\u20132.5 nm.\nThe spectra of CQDs at different excitation wavelengths are shown in Fig. 6a. The maximum luminescence peak of the CQDs was concentrated at 436 nm and 360 nm excitation wavelength. In addition, as the excitation wavelength increases from 300 nm to 380 nm, the emission wavelength slowly shied to red. This excitation-related behavior can be explained by the difference in particle size and emission trap location on each CQDs. As shown in Fig. 6b, the CQDs solution emitted blue uorescence under UV light. As shown in Fig. 6c, UV-vis absorption spectra of CQDs showed two signicant excitation adsorption bands located around 300 nm and 400 nm, respectively, with an optical adsorption edge. The absorption peak at 300 nm appeared due to a p\u2013p* jump, which implies the formation of a conjugated backbone in CQDs. The weak adsorption shoulders below 460 nm was assigned to heteroatom-doped surface states or energy traps, which caused by n\u2013p* leaps of functional groups.42 The lifetime decay of CQDs (Fig. 6d) indicated a tri-exponential decay with average lifetime of 1.06 ns.\nThe stability of CQDs is an essential factor to evaluate these materials, and the effects of ionic strength, pH, and solvent on uorescence intensity were investigated at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm.

As a result of deprotonation, the net surface charge was reduced, leading to further aggregation at high pH conditions and a reduce of uorescence. The pH effect of uorescence suggested that the CQDs microstructure was related to the source of blue uorescence, and the site was prone to hydrogen bonding of the functional groups \u2013OH and \u2013COOH on the CQDs surface under acidic conditions, and thus the CQDs aggregates led to\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 21199\u201321210 | 21205\nFig. 6 (a) Photoluminescence emission spectra of various incident light excitations gradually increasing, (b) intense excitation spectra of CQDs, (c) UV-vis absorption spectra of aqueous solutions of CQDs, and (d) lifetime decay of CQDs.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

As the Cu2+ concentration increased from 10 to 80 nM, the uorescence intensity of the CQDs decreased with increasing Cu2+ concentration, as shown in Fig. 8c. The linear correlation coefficient (r) was 0.992 (Fig. 8d). The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated as 3r/S, where r represents the blank signal standard deviation (n = 11), n refers to the number of repeated measurements performed on a blank sample, and S (refers to the slope of the linear curve). Thus, LOD of CQDs for Cu2+ was calculated to be 2.83 nmol L\u22121. A few reported materials could detect two or more metal ions simultaneously. For example, wool keratin-based uorescent CQDs prepared with nitrogen and sulfur doping could detect Cr6+ and Fe3+.47 In contrast, pigeon dung-synthesized nitrogen and sulfur co-doped uorescent CQDs could detect Hg2+and Fe3+.48 In our case, the CQDs exhibited a high selectivity for detection of Cu2+. The surface organic groups of CQDs (\u2013 COOH and \u2013NH2) have a strong ability to selectively bind with Cu2+, leading to the aggregation of CQDs, which produces a high quenching uorescence intensity, resulting in the quenching of the uorescence intensity of CQDs.49\nThe uorescence intensity showed an excellent linear correlation when the Cu2+ concentration was in the range of 10 to 80 nM,\nas shown in Fig. 8d. Aer that, we studied the quenching mode and nally determined it to be static quenching. Details of the calculation are presented in the ESI\u2020.50\nTherefore, the method of CQDs based uorescence detection was developed and exhibited a wide linear range for quantitative analysis and selective detection of Cu2+. As listed in Table 2, several materials with uorescence properties have been reported to selectively detect Cu2+. For example, N, S-codoped CQDs (NS-CQDs) were synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal process, and detection range of NS-CQDs for Cu2+ was 0\u201312.5 mmol L\u22121 and the LOD was 0.004 mmol L\u22121.42 Zhao et al.45 prepared CQDs from lignin for the detection of Cu2+, with a linear range of 0\u201330 mmol L\u22121 and a LOD of 0.085 nmol L\u22121.

            "text": "Two kinds of carbon-based materials with different properties, AC and CQDs, have been prepared from wolerry stem waste. Preparation of high specic surface AC aer activation with NaOH and an adsorption capacity of 68.06 mg g\u22121 of Cu2+. High adsorption capacity was compared to other biomass AC. The CQDs produce blue emission at 436 nm, which were selective for Cu2+ detection and have ultra-LOD (2.83 nmol L\u22121), Therefore, the preparation of two different performance materials (CQDs and AC) for the detection and removal of heavy metals from the environment by fabrication of waste wolerry straw not only enables the recycling of waste materials, but also provides a new way of thinking about environmental protection. This \u201cgreen\u201d and simple preparation method available for CQDs and AC offer a hint for utilization of a variety of waste biomass.\nEthical statement\nNot involved for both human and/or animal studies.\nAuthor contributions\nYunjia Xu: investigation, writing \u2013 original dra, writing \u2013 review & editing.
