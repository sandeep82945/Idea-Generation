 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore the performance of ROSPAC decoupling at even faster MAS frequencies above 100 kHz. The paper suggests good robustness at 100 kHz, so testing at higher speeds could reveal benefits. 

2. Investigate modifications to the ROSPAC sequence to further improve offset compensation, especially for lower power decoupling. This could expand the applicability of the method.

3. Apply ROSPAC decoupling to study different spin systems and sample types beyond the model compounds tested so far. This can demonstrate the general utility of the technique. 

4. Optimize ROSPAC decoupling for low-gamma nuclei beyond carbon-13, which have wider spectral ranges. Adapting the sequence could enable decoupling for challenging nuclei. 

5. Develop new analytical models beyond Floquet theory to gain additional insight into ROSPAC decoupling mechanisms. This could lead to targeted improvements in the sequence itself.
