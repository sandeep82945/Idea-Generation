We investigate this geometric/kinematic problem in the smooth and the discrete setting, as it is the base for a generalized construction of so-called T-hedral zipper tubes. In contrast to the cylindrical case, which can be solved easily, the conical one is more tricky, but we succeed to give a closed form solution for the discrete case, which is used to prove that these cones correspond to caps of Bricard octahedra of the plane-symmetric type.

            "text": "The work is motivated by the study of so-called zipper tubes, which were introduced by Filipov, Tachi and Paulino [1]. This term always refer to a pair of discrete tubes (in most examples both tubes are congruent) consisting of planar quads where each vertex has valence four. Each of these tubes has a one-parametric isometric deformation (also known as rigid-foldability). Moreover, the tubes are glued together along a row of faces, the so-called zip row, and the resulting zipper structure is still continuous flexible.\nIn [2] it is realized that most of the known zipper structures consist of tubes, which belong to a special class of rigid-foldable quad-surfaces known as T-hedra (cf. [3, 4, 5, 6]). This perspective leads to a deeper geometric understanding of the underlying zipper principle, which also made it possible to contemplate the construction of generalized T-hedral zipper tubes not only in a discrete setting but in a smooth one as well. Moreover, in [2] it is shown that this generalized construction reduces to the solution of the following geometric/kinematic problem studied in this paper.\n1\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n05 48\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.C G\n] 1\n3 M\nar 2\nGeometric/kinematic Problem. Determine all discrete/smooth cones \u039b and cylinders \u0393 , respectively, allowing a 1-parametric isometric deformation \u03b9 in a way that at least two planar curves a and b exist on \u039b and \u0393 , respectively, which remain planar under \u03b9 . Moreover, we assume that the two carrier planes \u03b1 and \u03b2 of a and b, respectively, are not parallel (cf. Fig. 1a)."

            "text": "The considerations within this subsection hold for the discrete and the smooth case. Let us assume that we have found a solution to the geometric/kinematic problem stated above, then planes parallel to \u03b1 (resp. \u03b2 ) also carry curves of \u039b and \u0393 , respectively, which remain planar during \u03b9 . This holds true, as the intersection curve of a parallel plane to \u03b1 (resp. \u03b2 ) results from a (resp. b) by a\n1. central scaling with center in the vertex V of \u039b in the conical case, 2. translation along the ruling direction of \u0393 in the cylindrical case.\nTherefore, we assumed that the planes \u03b1 and \u03b2 are not parallel. Moreover, we can produce further planar curves c on \u039b remaining planar under \u03b9 , by assigning an arbitrary real value to the cross-ratio (a,b,c,V ), which has to be evaluated along every ruling through the vertex V of \u039b . For the cylindrical case V is an ideal point of \u0393 and the cross-ratio reduces to the ratio (a,b,c). Due to the linearity of this construction the obtained curve c is again planar and its carrier plane \u03b3 is contained within the pencil of planes spanned by \u03b1 and \u03b2 . This already shows that there exists at least a one-parametric set of plane orientations implying planar cuts of \u039b and \u0393 , respectively, whose planarity is kept under \u03b9 .\nThe above considerations also show that for the cylindrical case one can always assume without loss of generality that \u03b2 is orthogonal to the ruling direction. As a consequence b remains planar under any isometric deformation of \u0393 , which keeps\n\u0393 a cylinder through the fixed ideal point V . Thus the problem gets more relaxed and one just has to compute \u03b9 in a way that a remains planar. The corresponding computations are straightforward and are given for reasons of completeness in the Appendix (see Section 5.1 for the discrete setting and Section 5.2 for the smooth one). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The discrete conical case is studied in Section 2 and the smooth one in Section 3. We conclude the paper in Section 4."

The corresponding rotation axis is denoted by ri. The intersection point of r1 and r2 is the vertex V and the angle enclosed by r1 and r2 is denoted by \u00b5 (cf.

There exists an 1- parametric rigid-folding of the three faces in a way that a1,a2,a3 keep their coplanarity. Under which geometric conditions also b1, b2 and b3 remain coplanar under this isometric deformation is figured out in the remainder of this section."

In order that for all d2 \u2208 R a value for d1 exists such that D1 = 0 and D2 = 0 hold, the coefficients with respect to d2 have to vanish, which implies the three algebraic equations:\nE4 = 0, E2 = 0, E0 = 0. (8)\nIn a first step we eliminate s2 by means of resultant, which can be done in three ways:\nF0 := Res(E2,E4,s2), F2 := Res(E0,E4,s2), F4 := Res(E0,E2,s2). (9)\nThese three expressions have a greatest common divisor (gcd) of the form\nG := 28s81s 8 3t 4 3 (t1\u2212 t2)2(t1t2 +1)2(t1 + t2)2(t1t2\u22121)2.

Therefore we can only consider the expressions Gk := Fk/G for k = 0,2,4.\nBased on these three expressions we can eliminate again by means of resultant the variable s1; i.e.\nH0 := Res(G2,G4,s1), H2 := Res(G0,G4,s1), H4 := Res(G0,G2,s1). (11)\nThen the solution has to be contained in the gcd of H0,H2,H4, which equals:\n2256m128(m2 +1)32t1282 t 48 3 (t1\u2212 t2)8(t1t2 +1)8(t1 + t2)8(t1t2\u22121)8\n(t2\u2212m)128(mt2 +1)128(s3\u2212 t3)128(s3t3 +1)128T 161 T 162 (12)\nwith\nT1 := t2(t1 + t3)(t1t3 +1)m2\u2212 t1(t23 +1)(t22 \u22121)m\u2212 t2(t1\u2212 t3)(t1t3\u22121), (13) T2 := t2(t1\u2212 t3)(t1t3\u22121)m2 + t1(t23 +1)(t22 \u22121)m+ t2(t1 + t3)(t1t3 +1). (14)\nWe only have to discuss the last four factors in detail as m has to be a real number different from zero and the other factor were already identified to belong to special cases. The factors (s3\u2212t3) and (s3t3+1) belong to the trivial solution that the planes \u03b1 and \u03b2 are parallel which can be seen as follows: Back-substitution of s3 = t3 and s3 = \u22121/t3, respectively, into G0,G2,G4 shows that the resulting expressions can only vanish for\nt82 t 8 3 (s1\u2212 t1)8(s1t1 +1)8(m2 +1)8 = 0 (15)\nBack-substitution of both possible solutions s1 = t1 and s1 = \u22121/t1, respectively, into E0,E2,E4 shows that the resulting expressions can only vanish for\nt21 t 2 3 (s2\u2212 t2)2(s2t2 +1)2 = 0. (16)\nThe possible solutions s2 = t2 and s2 =\u22121/t2, respectively, imply that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are parallel.\nAs a consequence only T1T2 = 0 can imply a non-trivial solution to our problem. Interestingly both conditions are independent of s3; i.e. only depend on m, t1, t2, t3. This means if this condition is fulfilled then one can choose s3 arbitrarily, which shows that a one-parametric set of planar slices remains planar during the oneparametric rigid-folding of the zipper strip (cf.

Then the final back-substitution into D1 = 0 and D2 = 0 yields the relation between d1 and d2. We found a more elegant way, which also yields compact expression, and is based on the following idea:\nAs none of the planes \u03b1 and \u03b2 is privileged the analog condition to T1T2 = 0 also has to hold with respect to the si\u2019s; i.e. S1S2 = 0 with\nS1 := s2(s1 + s3)(s1s3 +1)m2\u2212 s1(s23 +1)(s22\u22121)m\u2212 s2(s1\u2212 s3)(s1s3\u22121) (17) S2 := s2(s1\u2212 s3)(s1s3\u22121)m2 + s1(s23 +1)(s22\u22121)m+ s2(s1 + s3)(s1s3 +1) (18)\nTherefore we obtained two condition S1S2 = 0 and T1T2 = 0 from the initial system of three equations E0 =E2 =E4 = 0. Thus only one more condition is missing which can be computed in the following way. We eliminate from Ei (i = 0,2,4) and Su (u = 1,2) the unknown s2 by means of resultant, which yields Ji,u := Res(Ei,Su,s2). From this expression and Tv (v = 1,2) we eliminate t2 by computing Ki,u,v := Res(Ji,u,Tv, t2).\nThen the gcd of K0,u,v, K2,u,v and K4,u,v, which reads as follows:\n28s81s 8 3t 8 1 t 8 3 m 8(m2 +1)8M4u,vN 4 u,v, (19)\nhas to contain the looked for condition.

(23)\nThe fulfillment of the conditions S1S2 = 0 (resp. T1T2 = 0) already implies that D1 (resp. D2) splits up into several factors. This can be seen by computing the resultant of D1 and Su with respect to s2 (resp. D2 and Tv with respect to t2) which yields Os,u := 26s21s 2 3(m 2 +1)2P2s,uQ 2 s,u (resp.

The common factor of Os,u and Ot,v depends if either Mu,v = 0 or Nu,v = 0 holds.\nAll in all this yields a closed form solution of the problem at hand. One can solve Su for s2, Tv for t2 and Mu,v or Nu,v for one of the variables s1,s3, t1, t3.\nMoreover, one gets also the explicit expression of d2 from the common factor of Os,u and Ot,v.

(resp. b j = b j+4 = b j+8 = . . .) for j = 1, . . . ,4, thus the polygon closes and forms an anti-parallelogram, which is passed multiple times (depending on n). This finishes already the proof of the theorem.\nNote that the first face f1 and the last face fn can be extended in length as no conditions on the opening angles of these two faces are implied by the iteration procedure. They can also be rotated by \u03c0 about the lines r1 and rn\u22121, respectively1."

            "text": "The discussion of the smooth analog has to based on euclidean differential geometry of curves and cones (e.g. [7]).\nWe consider an 1-parametric isometric deformable cone \u039b\u03b7 , where \u03b7 denotes the deformation parameter, with vertex in the origin. This cone can be parametrized by \u03bbe1(\u03c2 ,\u03b7) with \u03bb \u2208R and e1 describes a 1-parametric family of spherical curves c\u03b7 on the unit sphere; i.e. \u2016e1\u2016= 1. Moreover, due to the isometric deformation we can assume without loss of generality that for each curve c\u03b7 the parameter \u03c2 represents its arc length; i.e. \u2016e\u20321\u2016 = 1 where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to \u03c2 . Then one can associate the Cartesian frame e1, e2 := e\u20321, and e3 := e1\u00d7 e2 known as Darboux frame with each curve c\u03b7 . The derivatives of these vectors read as follows [7, Eq. (5.68)]:\ne\u20321 = e2, e \u2032 2 =\u2212e1 +\u03bae3, e\u20323 =\u2212\u03bae2, (28)\nwhere \u03ba(\u03c2 ,\u03b7) is the geodesic curvature of c\u03b7 . Note that \u03ba determines the cone \u039b\u03b7 uniquely up to Euclidean motions due to the fundamental theorem of Euclidean differential geometry of cones [7, Thm. 5.3.13].\nWe can parametrize curves p\u03b7 ,i on the cone \u039b\u03b7 by pi(\u03c2 ,\u03b7) := \u03c6i(\u03c2)e1(\u03c2 ,\u03b7). Note, that due to the isometric deformation \u03c6i only depends on \u03c2 and not on \u03b7 . As p\u03b7 ,i is not arc length parametrized, its torsion has to be computed according to the well-known formula\n1 This corresponds to change of the opening angle\u2019s sign.\n\u03c4i(\u03c2 ,\u03b7) := (p\u2032i\u00d7p\u2032\u2032i )p\u2032\u2032\u2032i \u2016p\u2032i\u00d7p\u2032\u2032i \u20162 . (29)\nThe curve p\u03b7 ,i is planar if and only if \u03c4i(\u03c2 ,\u03b7) = 0 holds thus we get as condition\n(p\u2032i\u00d7p\u2032\u2032i )p\u2032\u2032\u2032i = 0. (30)\nWe substitute the expressions\np\u2032i = \u03c6 \u2032 i e1+\u03c6ie \u2032 1, p \u2032\u2032 i = \u03c6 \u2032\u2032 i e1+2\u03c6 \u2032 i e \u2032 1+\u03c6ie \u2032\u2032 1 , p \u2032\u2032\u2032 i = \u03c6 \u2032\u2032\u2032 i e1+3\u03c6 \u2032\u2032 i e \u2032 1+3\u03c6 \u2032 i e \u2032\u2032 1 +\u03c6ie \u2032\u2032\u2032 1 (31) under consideration of\ne\u20321 = e2, e \u2032\u2032 1 =\u2212e1 +\u03bae3, e\u2032\u2032\u20321 = \u03ba \u2032e3\u2212 (1+\u03ba2)e2 (32)\ninto Eq. (30) which yields Ki = 0 with\nKi := (\u03c6 2i \u2212\u03c6i\u03c6 \u2032\u2032i +2\u03c6 \u20322i )\u03c6i\u03ba \u2032+(\u03ba2\u03c6 2i \u03c6 \u2032i +\u03c6 2i \u03c6 \u2032i +\u03c6 2i \u03c6 \u2032\u2032\u2032i \u22126\u03c6i\u03c6 \u2032i \u03c6 \u2032\u2032i +6\u03c6 \u20323i )\u03ba. (33)\nRemark 1. By assuming that the cross-ratio (p1,p2,pi,V ) is constant \u03bbi \u2208 R we can set \u03c6i = \u03c61\u03c62(\u03bbi\u22121)\u03bbi\u03c61\u2212\u03c62 in Ki = 0. Then (\u03bbi\u2212 1)\n3 factors away and only an equation of the form \u03c6 41 K2\u03bb \u2212 \u03c6 42 K1 = 0 remains. This shows again that two solutions, which are given by K1 = 0 and K2 = 0, imply a 1-parametric set of solutions.\nThis differential equation Ki = 0 can be solved (e.g. with Maple), which yields beside two degenerate solutions (either \u03ba or \u03c6i is zero) the following general one:\n\u03ba = \u03a6i\n\u03c6 3i \u221a Wi with \u03a6i := \u03c6 2i \u2212\u03c6i\u03c6 \u2032\u2032i +2\u03c6 \u20322i (34)\nand\nWi :=2 \u222b \u03c6 \u2032i\n\u03c6i\u03a6i d\u03c2 +8 \u222b \u03c6 \u20323i \u03c6 3i \u03a6i d\u03c2 +8 \u222b \u03c6 \u20325i \u03c6 5i \u03a6i d\u03c2 \u22124 \u222b \u03c6 \u2032i \u03c6 \u2032\u2032i \u03c6 2i \u03a6i d\u03c2\n+2 \u222b \u03c6 \u2032i \u03c6 \u2032\u20322i\n\u03c6 3i \u03a6i d\u03c2 \u22128 \u222b \u03c6 \u20323i \u03c6 \u2032\u2032i \u03c6 4i \u03a6i d\u03c2 + I(\u03b7) (35)\nwhere I(\u03b7) stands for an arbitrary function in \u03b7 . As now the function \u03ba has to be the same for i = 1,2 this implies the condition \u03a62\u03c6 31 \u221a W1 = \u03a61\u03c6 32 \u221a W2, where we take both sides to the power of two in order to get rid of the square roots; i.e.\n\u03a622 \u03c6 6 1 W1\u2212\u03a621 \u03c6 62 W2 = 0, (36)\nwhich has the structure U1(\u03c2)I(\u03b7)+U0(\u03c2) = 0. As this condition has to be fulfilled for all values \u03b7 we end up with the conditions U1(\u03c2) = 0 and U0(\u03c2) = 0, which form a system of ordinary differential equations. The first condition U1(\u03c2) = 0 reads as\n\u03a621 \u03c6 6 2 \u2212\u03a622 \u03c6 61 = 0 (37)\nand can easily be solved for \u03c61, which yields\n\u03c61 = \u03c62\n\u03c62(C1 sin\u03c2 \u2212C2 cos\u03c2)\u00b11 (38)\nwith some constants Ci \u2208 R. If one plugs this expression into U0(\u03c2) = 0, one ends up with a final differential equation. Unfortunately, we are not able to solve it."

The cylindrical case turns out to be simple in contrast to the conical one, which we were able to solve in the discrete setting by showing that the cones correspond to caps of Bricard octahedra of the plane-symmetric type. For the smooth case we were able to solve the resulting system of partial differential equations symbolically up to a final ordinary differential equation. Its solution remains an open problem, but if there exists one then it would imply a continuous flexible semi-discrete suspension [8].\nAcknowledgements The research is supported by grant F77 (SFB \u201cAdvanced Computational Design\u201d, SP7) of the Austrian Science Fund FWF."
