    "abstractText": "In his twistor-particle programme of the 1970\u2019s, Roger Penrose introduced a representation of the massive particle phase space in terms of a pair of twistors subject to an internal symmetry group. Here we use this representation to introduce a chiral string whose target is a complexification of this space, extended so as to incorporate supersymmetry. We show that the gauge anomalies associated to the internal symmetry group vanish only for maximal supersymmetry, and that correlators in these string models describe amplitudes involving massive particles with manifest supersymmetry. The models and amplitude formulae exhibit a double copy structure from gauge theory on the Coulomb branch to gravity, although the graviton remains massless. The formulae are closely related to those obtained earlier by the authors expressed in terms of the polarised scattering equations.",

            "text": "The twistor-strings of Witten [66], Berkovits [4] and Skinner [63] led to remarkably compact amplitude formulae for tree amplitudes for both super Yang\u2013Mills [58] and supergravity theories [12, 16, 17, 29]. These twistor-strings theories and formulae, including the worldsheet formulae of Cachazo, He and Yuan [13, 14, 15], can all be understood under the umbrella of ambitwistorstrings [45]; a family of quantum field theories of holomorphic maps from a Riemann surface to the complexification of phase spaces of massless particles. These can come in various different twistorial or non-twistorial representations, with and without spin or supersymmetry and in different numbers of space-time dimensions. They exhibit a number of beautiful and perhaps unexpected features, such as a uniform simple structure in terms of residues in the moduli space M0,n of n-points on CP1 modulo Mo\u0308bius transformations, and one of the most direct realizations [10, 14, 46, 47] of the double-copy between gauge and gravity amplitudes [6, 7].\nIn their original form, all these ambitwistor-string theories and associated worldsheet formulae appear to be tightly restricted to theories and amplitudes involving only massless particles. However the underlying approach suggests that, if one wishes to compute amplitudes for theories with massive particles, one should consider quantum field theories of holomorphic strings whose\nThis paper is a contribution to the Special Issue on Twistors from Geometry to Physics in honour of Roger Penrose. The full collection is available at https://www.emis.de/journals/SIGMA/Penrose.html\ntarget is the complexified phase space of massive particles. The massless case has also shown that, in order to incorporate fermions simply, we should use a twistor representations of the phase space.\nNearly 50 years ago, Roger Penrose, followed by Zoltan Perjes, gave a twistor description of massive particles in terms of a set of two or more twistors up to an internal symmetry group [51, 54]. He proposed the twistor-particle programme based on the twistor quantization of this description. In particular, it was hoped that the representation theory of the internal symmetry group should classify elementary particles; see for example [36, 37, 52, 55] and references therein. Although this programme has not been pursued further by the twistor community, the framework was taken up by other authors in the particle physics community. For these authors, quantization via a worldline Lagrangian approach was used leading to studies of the spectrum of such twistor particle models, often incorporating supersymmetry. Two-twistor particle models include [8, 9, 22], see also [23, 24] for more recent studies that have a good number of references to the evolution of the subject, including [26, 27].1 Such worldline actions are a stepping stone to ambitwistor-string formulations. These are holomorphic strings whose target is a complexified phase space; the action being built directly from the holomorphic symplectic potential on such a complexified phase space [45].\nA particular advantage of the two-twistor representation of the phase space of massive particles is that it reduces to the nonlinear massive phase space via a symplectic quotient from the vector space of a pair of twistors. Such a symplectic quotient can be done via BRST in the quantum field theory, and all computations can be performed in a linear free-field quantum field theory on the Riemann surface. However, a key lesson from the massless cases is that, even if one is only interested in bosonic Yang\u2013Mills or gravity, fermionic symmetries are needed on the worldsheet and supersymmetries on space-time to obtain simple uniform formulae incorporating all relevant helicities. We will see that these supersymmetries can also be introduced in the massive case, leading to simple compact formulae for amplitudes in otherwise complicated, non-linear gauge and gravity theories. In its simplest approach, massive particles were understood in terms of a pair of 4d twistors( Za, Z\u0304a ) \u2208 T \u00d7 T, a = 1, 2. Each twistor Z \u2208 T has four complex components, that according\nto more recent (and less Penrosian) conventions are written as Z = ( \u03bb\u03b1, \u00b5 \u03b1\u0307 ) , i.e., as a pair of 2-component spinors; Z\u0304 is the SU(2, 2) complex conjugate of Z, defining a dual twistor by Z\u0304 = ( \u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307, \u00b5\u0304 \u03b1 ) . This description of massive particles was defined up to an internal symmetry group SU(2) \u00d7 C, where the SU(2) acts conformally invariantly on the a index. It can be understood in more conventional terms as the stabilizer of the massive momentum in the Lorentz group, the little group, see for example the massive spinor-helicity framework of [3].2 The factor of C in the symmetry group breaks conformal invariance and determines the particle masses.\nHere we complexify twistors so that the complex conjugate twistor Z\u0304 becomes a dual twistor Z\u0303 independent of Z\u0304 giving the pair Y = ( Z, Z\u0303 ) \u2208 TC := T \u00d7 T\u2217. We can also think of such\na complexified twistor as a Dirac twistor Y = ( \u03bbA, \u00b5 A ) , given as a pair of 4-component Dirac\nspinors \u03bbA = ( \u03bb\u03b1, \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307 ) and \u00b5A = ( \u00b5\u0303\u03b1, \u00b5 \u03b1\u0307 ) . We will also incorporate supersymmetry extending\nY \u2192 Y = ( \u03bbA, \u00b5 A, \u03b7I ) with N additional fermionic components \u03b7I . This description gives a natural inner product Y \u00b7 Y := Z \u00b7 Z\u0303 + \u03b7I\u03b7I from the duality between T and T\u2217 and skew form \u2126IJ .\n1Note also a two-twistor model along the lines of an ambitwistor string [40, 41], but focussed on massless particles.\n2More generally, n-twistor descriptions were considered with symmetry groups containing SU(n); in the twistor particle programme, particle multiplets were to be understood via the representation theory of such internal symmetry groups. The quantization of massive worldline models based on these descriptions has been studied by a number of authors, see [23, 50] and references therein.\nOur 4d massive twistorial models are given by holomorphic maps from the Riemann surface \u03a3 to the complexified two-twistor description of massive particles. They consist of a pair of complexified twistor fields Ya(\u03c3) = ( Za(\u03c3), Z\u0303a(\u03c3) ) , a = 1, 2 taking values in worldsheet spi-\nnors \u221a\n\u21261,0\u03a3 . To reduce to the twistor representation of the massive particle phase space, we also gauge the currents ( Ya \u00b7 Yb, \u03bb2, \u03bb\u03032 ) that generate the (complexified) internal symmetry group SL(2) \u00d7 C \u00d7 C\u0303. Here \u03bb2 := det(\u03bb) and its conjugate \u03bb\u03032 determine the squared mass of the massive momentum P\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = \u03bb a \u03b1\u03bb\u0303 b \u03b1\u0307\u03f5ab. Thus we arrive at the model\nS4d = \u222b \u03a3 Ya \u00b7 \u2202\u0304Ya +AabYa \u00b7 Yb +A ( \u03bb2 \u2212 jH ) + A\u0303 ( \u03bb\u03032 \u2212 jH ) + Sm.\nHere Sm is some theory dependent additional worldsheet matter that in particular can give rise to a current jH associated to some symmetry generator H. The Aab = A(ab) are gauge fields for\nthe SL(2) little group, and ( A, A\u0303 ) gauge the C \u00d7 C\u0303 part of the internal symmetry group; they are also Lagrange multipliers relating the values of the particle masses to their charges under H. Although this two-twistor massive model is a string whose target is the complexified twotwistor description of massive particles of [54], it can be identified with the dimensional reduction of the 6d and 5d ambitwistor strings in [34]. The contractions of the massive spinor helicity variables correspond to two components of the internal momentum when embedding the massive variables in a six dimensional massless momentum. The two-twistor string produces correlators that localize on delta functions that fix the values of internal momenta in terms of charges under H and H\u0303 for all particles involved. In addition to this, the correlators are further localized by delta functions imposing a polarised version of the scattering equations as in [1, 30].\nThe models above not only allow us to derive formulae involving any number of massive particles, but also give an alternative formulation of the massless models in [29]. This is of particular importance as it presents a framework in which a massless field can be deformed to go off-shell, which is a necessary prerequisite for defining a gluing operator in the four dimensional twistorial model and producing loop amplitudes.\nPaper summary. In the next section we introduce the two-twistor geometry of the massive particle phase space. We then briefly present the Penrose transform and its complexification. This can be used in a two-twistor string that computes amplitudes for theories with massive particles in four dimensions. Such formulae incorporate fermions and supersymmetry, generalizing the massless case of [29]. They are based on the polarised scattering equations that have already been introduced and studied in six and five dimensions [1, 31, 34]; these can also be related [62] to the formulae of [11]. We focus on a model adapted to the Coulomb branch of N = 4 SYM; this contains a gauge field, fermions and scalars that have a vacuum expectation value to give masses to some of the particles, analogous to the standard model. Nevertheless, as in the models of [33, 34], we can write down a full range of models for particles of spin-0, spin-1 and spin-2 following the double copy, although the scope for introducing masses into the gravity models are limited."

For a massive particle of momentum k\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 we write as above\nk\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = \u03baa\u03b1\u03ba\u0303 a \u03b1\u0307,\nwhere a = 1, 2 is an SU(2) little group index raised and lowered by \u03b5ab = \u03b5[ab], \u03b512 = 1. In the real case \u03ba\u0303a\u03b1\u0307 can be taken to be the complex conjugate of \u03ba\u03b1a reducing the little group to SU(2). We denote little group contractions by\n(v1v2) := v1av2b\u03b5 ab.\nThe mass m is given by k2 = m2 = det(k\u03b1\u03b1\u0307) = det\u03badet \u03ba\u0303; so defining\ndet\u03ba =M, det \u03ba\u0303 = M\u0303,\nwe have MM\u0303 = m2 and although we can fix the phases of \u03ba and \u03ba\u0303 so that M = M\u0303 = \u00b1m, later we will want to keep them independent before they are fixed by the model.\nMassive particles are not chiral, and two-component spinors necessarily double up with their conjugates. For a more compact notation, we introduce Dirac 4-component spinors with indices denoted by capital Roman letters from the beginning of the alphabet as\n\u03c8A = ( \u03c8\u03b1, \u03c8\u0303 \u03b1\u0307 ) , \u03c8A = \u03b5AB\u03c8A := ( \u03c8\u03b1, \u03c8\u0303\u03b1\u0307 ) , \u03c81A\u03c8 A 2 = \u03c81\u03b1\u03c8 \u03b1 2 + \u03c8\u0303 \u03b1\u0307 1 \u03c8\u03032\u03b1\u0307,\nand we will raise and lower indices with \u03b5AB, \u03b5AB, \u03b5 AB\u03b5AC = \u03b4 B C . Also note the \u03b35 matrix defined by\n\u03b3B5A\u03c8B = i ( \u03c8\u03b1,\u2212\u03c8\u0303\u03b1\u0307 ) .\nThe mass-m Dirac operator DmAB = D m [AB] in this notation is\nDmAB := \u2212i\u2207AB +m\u03b5AB = \u2212i\n( 0 \u2207 \u03b2\u0307\u03b1\n\u2212\u2207\u03b1\u0307\u03b2 0\n) +m\u03b5AB.\nThe spin s massive field equations for \u03a8A1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A2s = \u03a8(A1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A2s) becomes\nDmBA1\u03a8 A1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A2s = 0.\nAt spin s = 1, we obtain FAB = F(AB) whose 2 \u00d7 2 block-decomposition contains the 2-form curvature spinors along the diagonal and mA\u03b1\u03b2\u0307 on the off-diagonal, where A\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 is the one-form potential.\nIntroducing a little group spinor \u03f5a, the general plane wave on Minkowski space of spin-s can be decomposed into Dirac spinor wave functions as\n\u03a8A1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A2s = \u03f5A1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03f5A2seik\u00b7x, \u03f5A = \u03f5a\u03baaA =: (\u03f5\u03baA), \u03baAa = ( \u03ba\u03b1a, \u03ba\u0303 \u03b1\u0307 a ) . (2.2)\nFor spin 1/2, this is an ordinary massive Dirac field momentum eigenstate with polarization \u03f5a; for spin s = 1 this describes a massive field with potential A\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = 1 m\u03f5ab \u03ba a \u03b1\u03ba\u0303 b \u03b1\u0307 e\nik\u00b7x, with polarization \u03f5(ab) = \u03f5a\u03f5b. In general, spin-s massive particles transform as the symmetric part of rank 2s tensors of the massive little group SU(2), with polarization data \u03f5a1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a2s = \u03f5(a1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a2s). Note that the polarization in (2.2) is taken to be simple to tie in with later supersymmetric expressions, corresponding to a null polarization vector. We refer to [3, 19, 20] for more extended recent discussions of spinor-helicity for massive particles.\nTo reduce to the massless case, we can take half the spinor components to vanish \u03ba1\u03b1 = 0 = \u03ba\u0303\u03b1\u03070 , whereupon the little group spinor components \u03f50 and \u03f51 parametrize the positive and negative helicity states respectively."

            "text": "In all (massless) ambitwistor strings [45], the target space is the complexification of the massless particle phase space, often referred to as ambitwistor space and denoted by A. To define this we first introduce complexified twistor space TC by\nY = ( Z, Z\u0303 ) \u2208 TC := T\u00d7 T\u2217.\nThen the complexified phase space of massless particles in four dimensions has become known as ambitwistor space A, defined non-projectively as the holomorphic symplectic quotient\nA = {Y \u2208 TC | Y \u00b7 Y := Z \u00b7 Z\u0303 = 0}/ { Z \u00b7 \u2202Z \u2212 Z\u0303 \u00b7 \u2202Z\u0303 } , (2.3)\nwith respect to the symplectic structure\n\u2126A = d\u0398A, \u0398A := iZ \u00b7 dZ\u0303 \u2212 iZ\u0303 \u00b7 dZ.\nThis is the target of the original twistor strings [4, 63, 66] and the closely related ambitwistor strings [29].\nIn analogy with the massless case, here we take the target space to be PCm, the complexification of the massive particle phase space Pm. We represent PCm as the holomorphic symplectic quotient analogue of (2.1) as\nPCm := { Ya \u2208 TC \u00d7 TC | Z(a \u00b7 Z\u0303b) = 0, \u27e8ZaZa\u27e9 = [ Z\u0303aZ\u0303 a ] = m } /SL(2,C)\u00d7 C\u00d7 C\u0303.\nOne of the oldest applications of twistor theory has been to provide solutions to the free field equations. In the massless case this is achieved via the Penrose transform, which represents zero-rest mass helicity-h fields as twistor cohomology classes H1(PT,O(2h \u2212 2)). Using the identifications A = T \u2217PT = T \u2217PT\u2217, representatives of these cohomology classes can also be pulled back to ambitwistor space. While two-twistor descriptions in the literature [37] lead to H2 representatives by building on the real massive particle phase space, we use the complexification PCm to obtain representatives in (Dolbeault) cohomology classes H1 ( PCm,O(2s\u22122) ) that couple naturally to the worldsheet. Here we will focus on the scalar case s = 0, the extension to spinning particles can be achieved most straightforwardly via supersymmetry and is discussed in Section 2.4.\nTo represent the plane wave (2.2) with momentum k\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = \u03ba\u03b1a\u03ba\u0303 a \u03b1\u0307 on TC \u00d7 TC it will be\nconvenient to reorganise the spinor constituents of Ya as a \u201cDirac twistor\u201d Ya = ( \u03bbaA, \u00b5 A a ) , \u03bbaA := ( \u03bba\u03b1, \u03bb\u0303 \u03b1\u0307 a ) , \u00b5Aa := ( \u00b5\u03b1\u0307a , \u00b5\u0303\u03b1a ) .\nWriting \u03baAa = ( \u03ba\u03b1a, \u03ba\u0303 \u03b1\u0307 a ) , we define the corresponding cohomology representative in\nH1 ( PCm,O(\u22122) ) by introducing four auxiliary complex variables ua, va;\n\u03a6\u03ba(Ya) = \u222b d2ud2v\u03b4\u03044((u\u03bbA)\u2212 (v \u03baA))\u03b4\u0304((v, \u03f5)\u2212 1) exp (( u\u00b5A ) \u03f5A ) . (2.4)\nHere the line bundle O(n) is the bundle of homogeneity degree n in the Ya, and for a complex variable z we define \u03b4\u0304(z) to be the distributional (0, 1)-form\n\u03b4\u0304(z) = \u2202\u0304 1\n2\u03c0iz = \u03b4(Re z)\u03b4(Im z) dz\u0304.\nAfter the ua, va integrals have been performed, \u03a6\u03ba(Ya) \u2208 H1 ( PCm,O(\u22122) ) is indeed a (0, 1)- form as desired, and the integration over u ensures invariance under the SL(2,C) little group. For the Penrose transform, we take det(\u03ba) and det(\u03ba\u0303) to be unconstrained; in the two-twistor\nstring these quantities will be constrained to agree with the particle masses determined by the underlying theory.\nTo see that this indeed corresponds to a plane-wave on space-time, we impose the incidence relations \u00b5\u03b1\u0307a = ix \u03b1\u03b1\u0307\u03bba\u03b1 and \u00b5\u0303 \u03b1 a = \u2212ix\u03b1\u03b1\u0307\u03bb\u0303a\u03b1\u0307. Then on the support of the delta functions we have (u\u03bbA) = (v\u03baA) and (v\u03f5) = 1, giving 3(\nu\u00b5A ) \u03f5A = ix \u03b1\u03b1\u0307(v\u03ba\u03b1)(\u03f5\u03ba\u0303\u03b1\u0307)\u2212 ix\u03b1\u03b1\u0307(v\u03ba\u0303\u03b1\u0307)(\u03f5\u03ba\u03b1) = ix \u00b7 k. (2.5)\nThe parameters (ua, va) can be integrated against the delta functions to yield the single delta function \u03b4\u0304 ( k \u00b7 P \u2212 m\u03bb2 \u2212 m\u03bb\u03032 ) , where P\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = \u03bba\u03b1\u03bb\u0303 a \u03b1\u0307; this gives the Dolbeault representation for a simple pole. This delta function imposes a massive analogue of the scattering equations that play a key role in the CHY formulae for massless amplitudes [12, 16, 17, 29]. A version of these massive scattering equations has been studied for massive amplitudes in the CHY representation [48], see the discussion in Section 5 for more details. The delta-functions in \u03a6\u03ba have become known as the polarized scattering equations due to their dependence on a choice of polarization spinor.4 These serve to define additional and unique parameters ua, va on the support of the massive scattering equations that will play a key role later."

            "heading": "2.4 Supersymmetric extension",
            "text": "We will aim to generate supersymmetric formulae for two reasons. Amplitudes for theories with a variety of spins become drastically simpler in the supersymmetric case because many or all the particles can be expressed as one multiplet. This leads to uniform formulae from which different sectors with particles of different spins can be read off. Moreover, amplitudes for non-supersymmetric theories can be extracted from these superamplitudes at tree-level and at one-loop [33, 38]. A more structural reason is that all (ambi-) twistor string models that describe gauge theory and gravity require space-time supersymmetry to be anomaly free \u2013 the supersymmetric extension of twistor space includes additional fermionic variables that cancel anomalies from the bosonic variables. Thus we introduce a supersymmetric extension of PCm, as well as the plane wave \u03a6\u03ba.\nOn the Coulomb branch of N = 4 super Yang\u2013Mills, some scalars acquire a vacuum expectation value, effectively breaking the gauge group from SU(N +M) down to SU(N)\u00d7 SU(M). The states can then be organised into two types of multiplets; a massless vector multiplet transforming in the adjoint of the residual gauge group, and a massive vector multiplet in the bifundamental of SU(N)\u00d7 SU(M). Massive multiplets are in the so-called 1/2-BPS, ultrashort massive representations of N = 4 with central extension ZIJ = 2M\u2126IJ , with Sp(N/2) Rsymmetry, with skew form \u2126IJ and indices I, J = 1, . . . ,N = 4. For massless multiplets on the other hand, R-symmetry is enhanced to a full SU(4) by the vanishing of the central extension as m \u2192 0. Employing the notation of the previous section, we can combine the supercharges into a Dirac spinor QAI = ( Q\u03b1I , Q \u2020\u03b1\u0307 I ) , such that the supersymmetry algebra takes the compact form\n{QAI , QBJ} = 2\u2126IJDmAB.\nIn the massless case, the structure of the supersymmetry algebra greatly simplifies as the only non vanishing component of the Dirac operator is D0\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = \u2207\u03b1\u03b1\u0307.\n3This Penrose transform is closely related to the (indirect) 6d Penrose transform [44, 60]. The twistor space for 6d is TC|Y \u00b7Y =0 and the plane wave (2.2) is represented by\n\u03a8\u03ba(Y ) = \u222b (\u03f5v)n ds\nsn\u22121 (vdv)\u03b4\u03044(s\u03bbA \u2212 (v\u03baA)) exp\n( s\u00b5A\u03f5A/(\u03f5v) ) \u2208 H2(PA,O(n\u2212 2)).\nFollowing [34, 43, 56, 61], the massive \u03a6\u03ba(Ya) in (2.4) can then be constructed via \u03a6\u03ba(Ya) = \u222b \u03a8\u03ba((u, Y ))(udu).\n4The polarization spinor will play a more prominent role in amplitude formulae based on the polarized scattering equations, because the path integrals introduce \u03f5-dependence in \u03bbA(\u03c3).\nThe action of the supercharges arranges the states in multiplets as follows. The massive multiplet is composed of a massive spin one field FAB, five massive scalars \u03d5IJ and four massive Weyl\u2013Majorana spinors \u03a8IA:\nFm = ( \u03d5IJ = \u03d5[IJ ],\u03a8 A I , F AB = F (AB) ) , \u03d5IJ\u2126 IJ = 0. (2.6)\nThe massless multiplet is F 0 = ( \u03d5IJ = \u03d5[IJ ],\u03a8 I \u03b1, \u03a8\u0303I\u03b1\u0307, F\u03b1\u03b2, F\u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307 ) , (2.7)\nwhere the R-symmetry indices now label the fundamental of SU(4) and can therefore no longer be raised and lowered. It contains the two familiar \u00b11 helicity states of the massless spin-1, six real massless scalars \u03d5IJ and eight massless gluino states via the chiral parts of \u03a8 I \u03b1, \u03a8\u0303I\u03b1\u0307. We note that the massless scalars \u03d5IJ are no longer trace-free; the extra 6th component arises from the loss of one of the polarization degrees of freedom going from the massive spin-1 field FAB to the massless case.\nFor momentum eigenstates with space-time dependence \u03d5 = exp(ik \u00b7 x), the supersymmetry generators reduce to the massive little group as\nQAI = \u03ba a AQaI , {QaI , QbJ} = 2\u2126IJ\u03b5ab,\nwhere \u03baAa is defined by (2.2), because the Dirac operator reduces as D m AB\u03d5 = (\u03baA\u03baB)\u03d5. In the massless limit we have the natural embedding of the little group via \u03ba1\u03b1 = 0 = \u03ba\u03030\u03b1\u0307, \u03ba0\u03b1 = \u03ba\u03b1, \u03ba\u03031\u03b1\u0307 = \u03ba\u0303\u03b1\u0307.\nBoth the massive and massless multiplets are annihilated by half of the supercharges so that their 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic states can all be encoded into the exterior powers of N = 4 fermionic supermomenta qI , I = 1, . . . , 4. These are defined to be the eigenvalues of an anticommuting subset of the QIa. To define this subset, we introduce a basis (\u03f5a, \u03bea) of the fundamental representation of SL(2) so that the supermomenta are defined by the action of the supercharges on functions on on-shell superspace via\nQaIF\u0303 (\u03ba, q) = ( \u03beaqI + \u03f5a\u2126IJ \u2202\n\u2202qJ\n) F\u0303 (\u03ba, q). (2.8)\nThe massive and massless multiplets are expanded on on-shell superspace as follows\nF\u0303 (m) (\u03ba,q) = F \u03f5\u03f5(\u03ba) + qI\u03a8 \u03f5I(\u03ba) + q2F \u03f5\u03be(\u03ba) +\n1 2 qIqJ\u03a6 IJ(\u03ba) + q2qI\u03a8 \u03beI(\u03ba) + q4F \u03be\u03be(\u03ba),\nF\u0303 (0) (\u03ba,q) = g h(\u03ba) + qI\u03a8 \u03f5I(\u03ba) +\n1 2 qIqJ\u03c6 IJ(\u03ba) + q2qI\u03a8 \u03beI(\u03ba) + q4g\u2212h(\u03ba), (2.9)\nwith q4 = (qIqJ) ( qIqJ ) and ( q3 )I a = \u2202q4/\u2202qaI .\nIt is then standard procedure to encode such multiplets in superfields on a supersymmetric extension of Minkowski space satisfying (2.8) and to derive a supersymmetric Penrose transform by establishing a supergeometric correspondence with super-twistor space. We can bypass some of this by studying the action of supersymmetry on super-twistors.\nSupertwistors and the Penrose transform. We extend the bosonic complexified twistor Y \u2208 TC with N fermionic coordinates \u03b7I , I = 1, . . . ,N to give Y = ( \u03bbA, \u00b5 A, \u03b7I ) \u2208 T C, using Dirac-spinor notation. These fermionic coordinates allow the supersymmetry to act geometrically as\nQAI = \u03bbA \u2202\n\u2202\u03b7I + \u03b7J\u2126JI\n\u2202\n\u2202\u00b5A , {QAI , QBJ} = 2\u2126IJ\u03bb[A\n\u2202\n\u2202\u00b5B] ,\nwhere the anticommutator now generates the action of translations on T C. This extends in the obvious way to the two-twistor description of supersymmetric massive particles in terms of Ya with sums over the a-index in each term. Again, the supersymmetric extension for the Ya becomes:\nYa = ( \u03bbaA, \u00b5 A a , \u03b7 I a ) ,\nwith again I = 1, . . . ,N . The plane wave representative for particles with spinor helicity data \u03baAa = ( \u03ba\u03b1a, \u03ba\u0303 \u03b1\u0307 a ) , supermomentum q and polarization data \u03f5a will take the form:\n\u03a6(\u03ba,q)(\u00b5, \u03bb) = \u222b d2ud2vw\u03b4\u03044((u\u03bbA)\u2212 (v\u03baA))\u03b4\u0304((\u03f5v)\u2212 1)eiua(\u00b5 Aa\u03f5A+qI\u03b7 Ia)\u2212 1 2 (\u03bev)q2 . (2.10)\nHere w is a function of weight 2 in Ya(or \u22122 in u); as far as the Penrose transform is concerned, this can be taken to be w = ( \u03bb\u03b1\u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307 ) e\u03b1\u03b1\u0307, where e\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 is a polarization vector for the spin-1 1-form. In the string model however, w plays an important role in the vertex operators, and will be constructed differently. This representative indeed satisfies\nQAI\u03a6\u03ba,q(Ya) = ( (\u03baA\u03be)qI + \u03f5A\u2126IJ \u2202\n\u2202qI\n) \u03a6\u03ba,q(Ya),\nand we can then read off the Penrose transform for the component fields from the action of the supersymmetry generators."

            "text": "The significance of the twistor representations of spaces of massless and massive particles is that they are represented as symplectic quotients of vector spaces. This means that in order to construct a theory of maps from a Riemann surface \u03a3 \u2192 PCm, we can start with a quantum field theory of maps \u03a3 \u2192 TC in the massless case and \u03a3 \u2192 TC \u00d7 TC in the massive case; in both cases, by virtue of the twistor representations, these are free field theories on the worldsheet \u03a3. We then realize the symplectic quotient in the Lagrangian framework by gauging the Hamiltonian symmetries as we shall describe below. These gauge symmetries are then dealt with via BRST in the quantum field theory. In both cases, the free field theory action is based on the restriction of the symplectic potential \u0398 to T 0,1\u03a3 . This has the consequence that the worldsheet commutators and OPEs encode the symplectic structure \u2126m on PCm.\nWe first briefly review the massless case; although the construction for the massive twotwistor string will be analogous, but with target PCm and the different massive supersymmetry representation. In the next section we explain how the models allow us to construct amplitudes as correlation functions of vertex operators in these models.\nThe massless case. The twistor strings of Witten [66] and Berkovits [4] and the 4d ambitwistor string of [29] are theories of holomorphic maps Y = ( Z, Z\u0303 ) : \u03a3 \u2192 TC gauged by C\u2217,\nwhere we now use supertwistors Z = ( \u03bb\u03b1, \u00b5 \u03b1\u0307, \u03b7I ) \u2208 T = C4|N , I = 1, . . . ,N and their complexification TC = T \u00d7 T\u2217; this is the complexification of the four-dimensional massless Ferber superparticle [28].\nThe four-dimensional ambitwistor string of [29] is closest to the massive case, being with worldsheet fields twisted to take values in \u2126 1/2,0 \u03a3 and so we briefly review it here. It is a theory of holomorphic maps from a Riemann surface Y : \u03a3 \u2192 TC\u2297\u2126 1/2,0 \u03a3 , so that the coordinates Y are worldsheet spinors. The reduction to ambitwistor space is enforced by gauging the little-group Hamiltonian Y \u00b7 Y := Z \u00b7 Z\u0303 with the worldsheet gauge field A \u2208 \u21260,1\u03a3 . The basic bosonic 4d\nambitwistor action in conformal gauge5 is based on the symplectic potental\nS04d = \u222b \u03a3 Z\u0303 \u00b7 \u2202\u0304Z \u2212 Z \u00b7 \u2202\u0304Z\u0303 +AY \u00b7 Y. (3.1)\nClassically, A is a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the constraint Y \u00b7 Y = 0 and the quotient by its Hamiltonian vector field arises because ( Z, Z\u0303 ) \u2192 ( \u03b1Z,\u03b1\u22121Z\u0303 ) are gauge symmetries of the action when accompanied by the gauge transformations A \u2192 A + \u2202\u0304 log\u03b1. Thus the holomorphic symplectic quotient to A in (2.3) is realized in this Lagrangian framework by the gauge field A. In the QFT this is implemented via BRST quantization. The models of [29] also include additional worldsheet matter fields but these are much as described for the massive case below.\nMassive models. In order to have target space PCm, we start with maps Ya : \u03a3 \u2192 TC \u00d7TC, with the reduction to PCm obtained by gauging the complexified two-twistor massive internal symmetry group. Thus, our theory is one of maps Ya : \u03a3 \u2192 TC \u2297C2 \u2297\u2126 1/2,0 \u03a3 with action (again in conformal gauge)\nS4d = \u222b \u03a3 Ya\u2202\u0304Ya +AabYa \u00b7 Yb +A ( \u03bb2 \u2212 jH ) + A\u0303 ( \u03bb\u03032 \u2212 jH ) + Sm.\nHere a = 1, 2 is the little group index, and ( Aab = A(ab), A, A\u0303 ) are worldsheet (0, 1)-forms that act as Lagrange multipliers for the constraints, and as gauge fields for the internal two-twistor symmetry group. With this symmetry, we no longer have the freedom to allow worldsheet fields of different degrees as we did for the twistor-string. In order to describe specific space-time theories, the basic action must be supplemented by further worldsheet fields such as a current algebra for gauge theory and some analogue of worldsheet supergravity for gravity with details given below. Here we assume that it contains a current-algebra that gives rise to a (1, 0)-form jH on the worldsheet that generates some symmetry.\nTo be more explicit, in quantizing the fields Ya(\u03c3) = ( Za(\u03c3), Z\u0303a(\u03c3) ) , for \u03c3 a coordinate on \u03a3,\nthe only non-trivial OPEs are\nZAa (\u03c3)Z\u0303bB(0) = \u03b4AB \u03c3 \u03b5ab + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nreflecting the Poisson brackets. These OPEs can lead to anomalies for the little group SL(2,C) generated by Jab = Ya \u00b7 Yb. For a consistent model these anomalies have to vanish, which requires judicious choices for the worldsheet matter Sm.\nThe fields a, a\u0303 gauge the constraints \u03bb2 \u2212 jH = 0 = \u03bb\u03032 \u2212 jH . These equations constrain the mass operators\n\u03bb2 := 1\n2 \u03bba\u03b1\u03bb \u03b1 a = det(\u03bb a \u03b1), \u03bb\u0303\n2 := 1\n2 \u03bb\u0303a\u03b1\u0307\u03bb\u0303 \u03b1\u0307 a = det\n( \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307a ) ,\nto be given by a (1, 0)-form jH on the worldsheet \u03a3. We write jH to indicate that this will be taken to be the current associated to the element h \u2208 g, living in the Cartan subalgebra of some symmetry of the system. This jH will be constructed from the matter fields and, through the constraints above, will determine the masses of the particles. For a given matter content, different choices of jH correspond to different distributions of masses within the models. The\n5The full action would start with a term eT , where e \u2208 T 1,0\u03a3 \u2297 \u2126 0,1 \u03a3 is a Beltrami differential thought of as a gauge field parametrizing complex structures on \u03a3 up to coordinate transformations and T \u2208 ( \u21261,0\u03a3 )2 is the\nholomorphic stress energy tensor; this is then gauge fixed, giving rise to ghosts (b, c) \u2208 (( \u21261,0\u03a3 )2 , T 1,0\u03a3 ) and BRST\noperator Q = \u222e cT + bc\u2202c/2.\nmassless models (3.1) are recovered from these massive ones when jH = 0 by reducing the path integral.\nWorldsheet matter. A variety of physically interesting models can be constructed from different choices of Sm. These will be made up of current algebras, whose action will be denoted by SC , and worldsheet fermions providing a supersymmetric extension of the worldsheet gauge algebra, denoted by S\u03c1. The latter will play a similar role to worldsheet supergravity in the superstring, and is requried for models describing gauge theory and supergravity.\nA worldsheet current algebra is a theory on the worldsheet from which one can construct worldsheet currents ja \u2208 \u21261,0\u03a3 \u2297 g for some Lie algebra g, satisfying the OPE\nja(\u03c3)jb(0) \u223c l \u03b4 ab \u03c32 + fabc j c \u03c3 ,\nwhere a, b are Lie-algebra indices, l \u2208 Z is the level and fabc the structure constants of g. Such current algebras can be constructed in a number of ways, most easily for SO(n) and SU(n) by \u201creal\u201d or \u201ccomplex\u201d free fermions on the worldsheet. See also [33] for a construction referred to as a comb-system, with level zero and novel properties that allow the construction of EinsteinYang\u2013Mills amplitudes. We will not specify the action SC explicitly, but merely assume that we have the currents ja in the theory.\nFor gauge and gravity theories, we need a supersymmetric extension of the worldsheet gauge algebra. This plays a similar role to the worldsheet supergravity of the conventional RNS models, see also [45] for the ambitwistor-string version. The supersymmetric extension of the bosonic gauge algebra sl2\u00d7C2 is constructed by introducing the worldsheet fermions ( \u03c1A, \u03c1\u0303 A ) \u2208\n\u21260 ( \u03a3,K\n1/2 \u03a3\n) with action\nS\u03c1 = \u222b \u03a3 \u03c1\u0303A\u2202\u0304\u03c1A + ba ( \u03b3AB5 \u03bb a A\u03c1B ) + b\u0303a\u03bb a A\u03c1\u0303 A. (3.2)\nHere the ( ba, b\u0303a ) are fermionic gauge fields and so are (0, 1)-forms on the worldsheet. They are Lagrange multipliers that impose the constraints \u03b3AB5 \u03bb a A\u03c1B = \u03bb a A\u03c1\u0303\nA = 0 and their gauge transformations translate \u00b5Aa in the direction of ( \u03c1A, \u03c1\u0303A ) . The only non-trivial OPE\u2019s of the constraints are given by( \u03b3AB5 \u03bb a A\u03c1B ) (z) ( \u03bbbB\u03c1\u0303 B ) (w) \u223c \u03b5ab z \u2212 w ( \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03032 ) . (3.3)\nThese symmetries thus give a supersymmetric extension of the two-twistor internal symmetry group C\u00d7 sl2 \u22c9H(0, 4), where H denotes the Heisenberg Lie superalgebra.6\nModels. With these ingredients, models without SL(2,C)-anomalies can be constructed by combining a pair of worldsheet matter systems, much along the lines of the double copy for the RNS ambitwistor strings as in [33] as follows:\nmassive bi-adjoint scalar SBAS = S4d + SC + SC\u0303 , super Yang\u2013Mills on the Coulomb branch SCB = S4d + S\u03c1 + SC , super-gravity Ssugra = S4d + S\u03c11 + S\u03c12 .\n6The Heisenberg superalgebra H(mb,mf ) has a central element z, as well as 2mb even and mf odd generators, H = \u27e8x1, . . . , x2mb , z\u27e9 \u2295 \u27e8\u03c81, . . . , \u03c8mf \u27e9. The generators satisfy the \u201cusual\u201d commutation relations\n[xi, x2i] = z, {\u03c8r, \u03c8s} = 2\u03b4rsz.\nIn this construction two points are worth highlighting:\n(i) The closure of the constraint algebra requires that both constraints \u03bb2\u2212 jH = 0 = \u03bb\u03032\u2212 jH involve the same current jH for super Yang\u2013Mills, whereas a more general construction is possible for the bi-adjoint scalar.\n(ii) Unlike the twistor- and ambitwistor models for 4d massless theories, these models fit neatly into the double copy format [7] expressed directly in the CHY formulae [12] and in the corresponding RNS ambitwistor strings [45]. However, it is harder to find a jH to endow our particles with mass in the gravitational case because there is no additional current algebra, and with jH = 0 our models are massless. We also note that as in [5, 34, 45], both SCB and SBAS also contain a gravity sector, but it is of higher order and remains massless.\nBRST and anomalies. Gauge fixing the action via BRST generates ghost systems, the well-known (b, c) \u2208 ( \u21261\u03a3 )2 \u00d7 T\u03a3 for worldsheet diffeomorphisms, as well as additional fermionic ghosts associated to internal two-twistor symmetry group, and bosonic ghosts for the fermionic currents in S\u03c1. The BRST operator takes the usual form:\nQ = \u222e ci ( Tmi + 1\n2 T gi\n) , (3.4)\nwhere the sum runs over all sets of ghosts, and Tm and T g are the matter and ghost parts of the currents respectively. By construction Q2 = 0 classically, but in the QFT double contractions (or worldsheet bubble diagrams with two external gauge fields) can lead to anomalies so that Q2 \u0338= 0 with a potential obstruction arising from any of the gauged symmetries. Here we briefly summarize the results of such calculations.\nThe models above only have a vanishing SL(2,C) anomaly (corresponding to the two-twistor internal symmetry group) for maximal space-time supersymmetry, as evident from the anomaly coefficient\naSL(2) = \u2211 i (\u22121)FitrRi ( tktk ) =  4 trF ( tktk ) \u2212 tradj ( tktk ) = 0 bi-adjoint scalar,\n3 4(4\u2212N ) Coulomb branch, 3 4(8\u2212N ) supergravity.\nThe anomaly coefficient vanishes trivially for the bi-adjoint scalar, and for maximal supersymmetry in the case of gauge theory and gravity. The sum here runs over all fields that transform non-trivially under the internal two-twistor symmetry group SL(2,C). Similarly, the Virasoro central charge can be calculated for all models, giving\ncBAS = \u221240 + cj , cCB = \u221232 +N + cj , csugra = \u221220 +N ,\nwhere cj denotes the central charge of the internal current algebra. The conformal anomaly thus vanishes for suitable choice of Sj , with N = 4 and cj = 28 for Yang\u2013Mills theory on the Coulomb branch, and cj = 40 for the bi-adjoint scalar. The Virsaoro anomaly for the supergravity model also vanishes if we include a central charge term c6d = 12 arising from six compactified dimensions. After BRST gauge-fixing, all such models are free worldsheet theories with vanishing anomalies.7 We now explain how to obtain n-point amplitudes from these models.\n7Strictly speaking, the Lie algebra element H should also be null or the current algebra should have level l = 0 as in the comb systems of [18]."

            "text": "In string theory, amplitudes are constructed as correlation functions of vertex operators, one for each external particle. Vertex operators come in various forms that depend on how residual gauge freedom is fixed after initial gauge fixing, see for example [65]. The easiest to understand are the integrated vertex operators that require integration over \u03a3; these are the generic case and arise as the perturbations of the action corresponding to infinitesimal background planewave fields. However, one also needs a small number of fixed vertex operators that fix residual worldsheet diffeomorphisms and other symmetries such as those associated to the a, a\u0303 and b, b\u0303 fields. We here just give brief details of the basic recipe required for the amplitude formulae and refer to further work [2] for full details of the derivation."

            "heading": "4.1 Vertex operators",
            "text": "Just as for the original twistor string, vertex operators for the two-twistor string are constructed from the Penrose-transform of plane waves \u03a6\u03ba(Ya) \u2208 H1 ( PCm,O(\u22122) ) (2.4), or its supersymmetric extension \u03a6\u03ba,q(Ya) (2.10) with an appropriate choice of w. The identification of the Ya or Ya as spinors on the worldsheet implies that \u03a6\u03ba(Ya) restricts to \u03a3 to define an element of H0,1(\u03a3, T\u03a3). Similar considerations apply to \u03a6\u03ba,q(Ya) but the line bundle on \u03a3 depends on the choice of w. We will therefore choose w so as to take values in ( \u21261,0 )2 so that w \u25e6 \u03a6 defines a (1, 1)-form on \u03a3 and can be integrated; here the notation \u25e6 indicates schematically that w may depend on u, and should be included under the integral in \u03a6\u03ba. Thus fixed and integrated vertex operator can be constructed by including a state- and theory dependent factor w \u2208 \u21260 ( \u03a3,K2\u03a3\n) respectively as\nV = c w \u25e6 \u03a6\u03ba(\u03c3), V = \u222b d\u03c3 w \u25e6 \u03a6\u03ba(\u03c3). (4.1)\nHere c is the fermionic ghost with values in T 1,0\u03a3 associated to worldsheet diffeomorphisms. Vertex operators are required to be BRST Q-closed which implies invariance under the symmetries. For example, the presence of the c-ghost in V gives Q-closure trivially for that part of Q containing c which is associated to worldsheet diffeomorphisms, whereas, on the other hand, the integration of the (1, 1)-form on \u03a3 that defines V is manifestly diffeomorphism invariant. We also expect to see similar invariance of both fixed and integrated vertex operators under the gauged two-twistor internal symmetry and the gauged fermionic symmetries in S\u03c1 if present. BRST-closed vertex operators can thus be constructed by including ghost factors for the remaining generators, including fermionic ghosts t, t\u0303 associated to the mass constraints gauged by A, A\u0303, and bosonic ghosts \u03b3a, \u03b3\u0303a corresponding to ba, b\u0303a respectively.\nIt is this Q-invariance that will fix the masses of our external particles. In the sum over ghosts in (3.4), Q contains the term for the ghosts t and t\u0303 that arose from gauge fixing the A, A\u0303:\nQm :=\n\u222e t ( \u03bb2 \u2212 jH ) + t\u0303 ( \u03bb\u03032 \u2212 jH ) .\nWhen acting on a vertex operator built as in (4.1), the operator \u03bb2 becomes the mass operator, yielding the Q-invariance condition that requires support on \u03ba2 = MH , where MH is the eigenvalue of the H-action on the vertex operator under jH . Thus Q-invariance requires that the signed mass is given by the action of jH . This action is theory-dependent as follows.\nBiadjoint scalars. This theory involves two Lie algebras g, g\u0303 with fields \u03d5aa\u0303, where a, a\u0303 are the respective Lie-algebra indices. The action is \u222b d4x ( (\u2202\u03d5)2 + fabcf\u0303a\u0303b\u0303c\u0303\u03d5 aa\u0303\u03d5bb\u0303\u03d5cc\u0303 ) , where the fabc, f\u0303a\u0303b\u0303c\u0303 are the structure constants of the respective Lie algebras. We will also incorporate a mass term tr([\u03d5,H])2, whereH \u2208 g\u2295g\u0303. Each particle then has a pair of \u201ccolours\u201d ( ta, t\u0303a\u0303 ) \u2208 g\u2295g\u0303\nand momentum k with mass determined by the eigenvalues of the action of H in the form of the plane wave \u03d5aa\u0303 = tat\u0303a\u0303eik\u00b7x. These theories don\u2019t admit supersymmetry so we will simply use (2.4) and the two colours tat\u0303a\u0303 to build the corresponding vertex operators, so that the mass is assigned via\njH(z) taj a(w) \u223c M\nH t\nz \u2212 w taj\na. (4.2)\nCoulomb branch of maximal super-Yang\u2013Mills. Here one takes the standard N = 4 super-Yang\u2013Mills with Lie algebra g, and assumes that the scalars of the massless sector \u03d5IJ are expanded around the constant H\u2126IJ , where H \u2208 g is taken to be semi-simple. Decomposing g into eigenspaces under the adjoint action of H, those with eigenvalue zero give rise to massless multiplets (2.7), but those with non-zero eigenvalue MH acquire a mass |MH | and become massive multiplets as in (2.6), where the scalar that is a multiple of \u2126IJ becomes a polarization state of the massive spin-1 field via the Higgs mechanism.\nTo be more explicit, consider the symmetry breaking U(N +M) \u2192 U(N)\u00d7U(M), obtained by choosing H \u223c diag(1N , 0M ). This leaves two types of states in the reduced theories, the first corresponding to t \u2208 uN \u00d7 uM , the diagonal blocks that commute with H, and the second the off-diagonal blocks consisting of m \u2208 CN \u2297 ( CM\n)\u2217\u2295CM \u2297 (CN)\u2217 for which [H,m] =MHm m. The first type then corresponds to massless states, and the second will have mass\n\u2223\u2223MHm \u2223\u2223, following from the Q-invariance of the vertex operators as above. As a consequence, the OPEs (4.2) of the respective currents take the following form:\njH(z) t \u00b7 j(w) \u223c 0, jH(z) m \u00b7 j(w) \u223c M H m\nz \u2212 w m \u00b7 j. (4.3)\nWe can thus identify vertex operators built from currents t \u00b7 j with the massless vector multiplet transforming in the adjoint of the residual U(N)\u00d7U(M) gauge group, whereas vertex operators built from m \u00b7 j describe the massive vector multiplet.8\nSupergravity. We are not able to introduce massive spin-2 fields with this mechanism. However, we can introduce masses elsewhere into the supermultiplet by choosing for jH a generator of the R-symmetry. While we will not develop this theme in any detail, a short discussion is included in Section 5. The graviton states remain in a massless supermutliplet with N = 4, formed as spin-2 part of the tensor product of two copies of the gauge mutiplet (2.7), supplemented by an ultrashort matter multiplet, again with N = 4.\nBecause both the A, A\u0303 fields and ba, b\u0303a fields have moduli that need to be fixed when computing correlators, we need to adjust some vertex operators to fix this residual gauge freedom. Here we will suppress these details and give only the equivalent of integrated vertex operators for these symmetries, and refer to the analogous calculations in the 5d ambitwistor string [34] or [2] for details.\nThe main new ingredient here required for BRST-invariance of the vertex operators are delta functions fixing the value of \u03bb2 and \u03bb\u03032 to the relevant masses MHi arising from the eigenvalues of jH . These arise from integrating out the moduli of the associated gauge fields in the presence of vertex operators. Thus the generic integrated vertex operators for these theories can be summarized as\nwBAS(\u03c3i) = \u03b4 ( Res\u03c3i ( \u03bb2 \u2212 jH )) \u03b4 ( Res\u03c3i ( \u03bb\u03032 \u2212 jH )) taj at\u0303aj\u0303 a,\nwCB(\u03c3i) = \u03b4 ( Res\u03c3i ( \u03bb2 \u2212 jH )) \u03b4 ( Res\u03c3i ( \u03bb\u03032 \u2212 jH ))( eABi (\u03bbB\u03bbA) + \u03f5 A i \u03f5iB\u03c1A\u03c1\u0303 B ) taj a,\nwgrav(\u03c3i) = \u03b4 ( Res\u03c3i ( \u03bb2 \u2212 jH )) \u03b4 ( Res\u03c3i ( \u03bb\u03032 \u2212 jH ))( eABi (\u03bbA\u03bbB)\u2212 \u03f5Ai \u03f5iB\u03c1A\u03c1\u0303B ) \u00d7 ( e\u0303ABi (\u03bbA\u03bbB)\u2212 \u03f5\u0303Ai \u03f5iB\u03c1A\u03c1\u0303B ) ,\n(4.4)\n8The massive states are 1/2-BPS, ultrashort massive representations of N = 4 with central extension |ZIJ | = 2m.\nwhere ei and e\u0303i are polarisation vectors. When evaluating correlators including these vertex operators, we will see that the delta-functions enforce the mass-shell condition. One can see from (4.2)\u2013(4.3) that taking the residue of jH acting on a H-eigenstate extracts the mass MHi . Note that in the gravitational case the MHi will be zero for any multiplet containing the gravitational spin two field."

            "text": "Amplitudes are calculated as correlators in the ambitwistor string models. Due to ghost zero modes and residual symmetry after gauge fixing, a non-trivial correlator with n vertex operators must contain three fixed vertex operators V1, V2, V3, not necessarily of the same type, whose details we suppress:\nAn = \u2329 V1V2V3 n\u220f i=4 Vi \u232a .\nAfter gauge fixing, all the fields are free and these correlation functions can be straightforwardly evaluated explicitly for any n to give formulae for scattering amplitudes.\nEach vertex operator contains an exponential from the \u03a6\u03ba factor as in the classes (2.10) embedded in the definition of the vertex operators (4.1). Directly computing their correlation functions would be awkward, but in the expression of the correlation function as a path integral, the exponentials from the vertex operators can be absorbed as source terms into the action for the Ya-path integral. Since the correlator is independent of \u00b5Aa, and the action is linear in \u00b5Aa, the path integrals over these fields can be performed directly, localizing the correlator onto the classical equations of motion, but now with sources arising from the vertex operators\n\u2202\u0304\u03bbaA = n\u2211\ni=1\nuai \u03f5iA \u03b4\u0304(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3i), \u2202\u0304\u03b7aI = 1\n2 n\u2211 i=1 uai qiI \u03b4\u0304(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3i).\nOn the Riemann sphere, these are solved uniquely by\n\u03bbaA(\u03c3) = n\u2211 i=1 uai \u03f5iA \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3i , \u03b7aI (\u03c3) = 1 2 n\u2211 i=1 uai qiI \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3i . (4.5)\nUsing this, the remainder of the correlator can be evaluated as follows:\nPolarized scattering equations and measure. Evaluating the ghost path integrals and collecting the various measure factors as well as the delta-functions from \u03a6\u03ba gives the following measure:\nd\u00b5poln :=\n\u220f j d\u03c3j d 2uj d 2vj\nvol SL(2,C)\u03c3 \u00d7 SL(2,C)u n\u220f i=1 \u03b4\u03044 ( (ui\u03bbA(\u03c3i))\u2212 (vi\u03baiA) ) . (4.6)\nA short counting reveals that the integrals are fully localized on the constraints enforced by the delta-functions, known as the polarised scattering equations EiA = 0, where\nEiA := (ui\u03bbA(\u03c3i))\u2212 (vi\u03baiA) = \u2211 j \u0338=i (uiuj)\u03f5jA \u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j \u2212 (vi\u03baiA). (4.7)\nThese equations and corresponding measure are by now well studied in [1, 30]; the polarized scattering equations imply a massive analogue of the original scattering equations for the \u03c3i described in Section 5, and the measure reduces to the CHY measure [14]. After performing\nthe integrals, the amplitudes still contain six residual delta-functions, whose form can be extracted from\n\u03f5i[AEiB] = \u2211 i KiAB = 0, where KiAB := (\u03baiA\u03baiB) =\n( \u03ba2i \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 ki\u03b1 \u03b2\u0307\n\u2212k\u03b1\u0307i\u03b2 \u03ba\u03032i \u03b5\u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307\n) . (4.8)\nThe residual delta-functions thus encode conservation of momentum k\u03b1\u03b1\u0307, as well as restrictions on \u03ba2 = det(\u03baa\u03b1) and \u03ba\u0303 2: \u2211 i \u03ba 2 i = 0 = \u2211 i \u03ba\u0303 2 i . Notice that the closure of the algebra of constraints (3.3) imposes that \u03ba2i = \u03ba\u0303 2 i so that these two conditions are actually equivalent. One can show that, because each MHi is the charge under a symmetry on a compact worldsheet, the amplitude vanishes unless \u2211 iM H i = 0. Then this condition, together with conservation of \u03ba2 and the n\u2212 1 mass assigning delta functions, entails that also for the remaining particle \u03ba21 =M H 1 . Mass fixing. The action of the operators \u03bb2 and \u03bb\u03032 reduces to the residues of their zeromodes (4.5) at \u03c3i. From the above formula, on the support of the delta functions in (4.6), this can be seen to yield \u03ba2i and \u03ba\u0303 2 i . Thus the mass parameters for each particle \u03ba 2 i and \u03ba\u0303 2 i are fixed to the appropriate value MHi via the delta function in that vertex operator in (4.4):\nn\u220f i=2 \u03b4 ( Res\u03c3i\u03bb 2 \u2212MHi ) \u03b4 ( Res\u03c3i \u03bb\u0303 2 \u2212MHi ) = n\u220f i=2 \u03b4 ( \u03ba2i \u2212MHi ) \u03b4 ( \u03ba\u03032i \u2212MHi ) ,\nnow clearly enforcing the mass-shell condition for n\u22121 particles. That for the 1st particle is omitted in one of the fixed vertex operators (to fix a residual degree of gauge freedom) but arises instead as a consequence of the residual delta functions that gives \u2211 i \u03ba 2 i = 0 = \u2211 i \u03ba\u0303 2 i as discussed above.\nSupersymmetry. In the supersymmetric cases, the vertex operators contain exponential factors in the \u03b7aI s; these localize onto the solution to (4.5), to yield:\neFN := exp (\u2211 j<k (ujuk)qj \u00b7 qk \u03c3j \u2212 \u03c3k \u2212 1 2 n\u2211 j=1 (\u03bejvj)q 2 j ) .\nThis factor carries all the dependence on the supermomenta and can be expanded to yield the various component-amplitudes according to the supermomentum expansion of the supermultiplet (2.9). The form of this factor moreover guarantees that the amplitudes are supersymmetrically invariant [1, 30].\nCombining these factors leads to the following expression for massive amplitudes for super Yang\u2013 Mills on the Coulomb branch and massive bi-adjoint scalar theory;\nAn = \u222b d\u00b5poln IneFN . (4.9)\nHere, In \u2013 the \u201cintegrand\u201d of the amplitude expression \u2013 contains all the remaining correlator factors. Since the current algebra and Heisenberg superalgebra do not interact, In can be split further into two \u201chalf-integrand\u201d factors that can be calculated individually. The current algebra correlator at leading trace gives the omnipresent Parke\u2013Taylor factor,\n\u27e8ta1ja1(\u03c31) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 tanjan(\u03c3n)\u27e9 = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208Sn/Dn\ntr ( t\u03b1(1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 t\u03b1(n) ) \u03c3\u03b1(1)\u03b1(2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c3\u03b1(n)\u03b1(1) =: \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208Sn/Dn\nPT(\u03b1),\nwith the sum running over dihedrally inequivalent orderings. The evaluation of the \u03c1\u03c1\u0303 halfintegrand is also standard (cf. [34]), giving the reduced determinant,\ndet \u2032H := 1\n(u1u2) detH\n[12] [12] ,\nwhere, the n\u00d7 n matrix H is defined by\nHij = \u03f5iA\u03f5\nA j\n\u03c3ij , Hii = \u2212eABi (\u03bbA\u03bbB)(\u03c3i),\nand the sub- and superscripts indicate that both the rows and the columns 1 and 2 have been removed. It can be shown that the reduced determinant det \u2032H is invariant under permutation of all particle labels; this can be seen directly [1, 30], but also follows from its correlator origin. We thus arrive at the following integrands;\nIBASn = PT(\u03b1) PT(\u03b2), ICBn = PT(\u03b1) det \u2032H, IGravn = det \u2032H det \u2032H\u0303. (4.10)\nThis completes the specification of the massive amplitude formulae (4.9). For worked out examples at three and four points, we refer the reader to the computations in six dimensions presented in [1]. They reproduce the formulae present in the literature for two or four particles in the massive supermultiplet and the remaining particles massless."

            "text": "We have therefore seen that a chiral string whose target is the complexification of Penrose\u2019s twotwistor representation of the massive particle phase space yields theories of massive particles in four dimensions. The spectrum of these models includes massive particles, and correlators give amplitude formulae for super Yang\u2013Mills on the Coulomb branch among other theories. These string models represent the confluence of two separate developments: the twistor-particle program of the 70\u2019s describing massive particles, and the more recent ambitwistor string models describing scattering amplitudes for massless particles. In the latter approach a chiral or holomorphic string whose target is the complexification of the space of massless particles yields amplitudes for theories of massless fields. Here we have seen that the logic extends naturally to massive particles. The significance of Penrose\u2019s twistor description is that it provides a canonical representation of the space as the symplectic quotient of a vector space modulo a Hamiltonian group action allowing the BRST quantization of a free quantum string. The twistorial description furthermore facilitates the incorporation of fermions and supersymmetry.\nFrom the path integral of these models, we have arrived at the compact formulae (4.9), supplemented by (4.6) and (4.10) supported on a massive version (4.7) of the polarised scattering equations with manifest supersymmetry for appropriate gauge and gravity theories including massive particles. Like all twistor-string [17, 59], CHY [13] and ambitwistor-string amplitude formulae, all the integrations are saturated against delta functions so that these are really residue formulae summing contributions from the (n \u2212 3)! solutions to a massive extension of the scattering equations discussed further below. As shown in [1], the extra data in the polarised extension is uniquely obtained by linear equations on the support of these scattering equations and the formulae are linear in the polarization data.\nThe models described in this paper, and related ones, can also be derived via a symmetry reduction of the higher-dimensional ambitwistor string models [2]. This alternative interpretation of the two-twistor string highlights that these worldsheet models describe a subset of massive models, where the particle masses are related to their (higher-dimensional) charges under a symmetry. While this may appear restrictive, it includes many theories of immediate interest; in\nparticular, all massive particles that we encounter in the standard model arise from the Higgs mechanism that can be obtained by symmetry reduction. The upcoming paper [2] will also contain full details of the fixed vertex operators and picture changing operators that we omitted for brevity. Mirroring the close relation of the models, the resulting amplitude formulae for massive particles are also closely related to those obtained previously by dimensional reduction from six and five dimensions [1, 30, 34]. These can further be related to the formulae of [11] by a change of gauge choice of an embedding inside a Lagrangian grassmannian [62]. At low point orders, these expressions match the results obtained in [3, 21, 35, 39, 42, 49] by BCFW recursion.\nContrary to the massless four-dimensional formulae of [29], in which the double copy properties are hidden in the measure, the expressions derived here present the standard structure with two half integrands that can be combined to form amplitudes for scalars, spin-1 and spin-2 particles as in the CHY formulae and corresponding RNS models of [18, 45]. The embedding of the massless models in these novel massive ones give a new outlook on the corresponding massless formulae.\nWe conclude by discussing further features and connections to related formulae for massive amplitudes and future directions that we plan to address in [2].\nMassive scattering equations. The massive polarised scattering equations (4.7) are closely related to the massive scattering equations in the CHY framework proposed by Dolan & Goddard and by Naculich [25, 48]. We first note that as remarked after (2.5) that the delta functions imply:\nKABi PAB(\u03c3i) := k \u03b1\u03b1\u0307 i P\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 \u2212mi\u03bb2(\u03c3i)\u2212mi\u03bb\u03032(\u03c3i) = 0.\nAfter the path-integral we have that \u03bbAa is given in (4.5) and we can compute [1, 30]\nPAB(\u03c3) := (\u03bbA\u03bbB) = \u2211 i KiAB \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3i d\u03c3, (5.1)\nwhere Ki is defined as in (4.8). When the momenta Ki are null, PAB plays a crucial role in the vector representation of the ambitwistor string [45], where a similar path integral calculation to the one in Section 4 localizes P onto (5.1). Naculich then showed that certain massive amplitudes localize on a massive extension of the CHY scattering equations,\n0 = KiABP AB(\u03c3i) = \u2211 j \u0338=i ki \u00b7 kj \u2212MiMj \u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j .\nThe polarised scattering equations EiA then clearly imply Naculich\u2019s massive scattering equations via KiABP AB(\u03c3i) = det ( \u03baaiA, \u03bb bA(\u03c3i) ) = 0, where the last equality holds on the support of EiA. Vector ambitwistor models that directly yield these equations will be presented in [2]. Masses from R-symmetry. Novel gauge and gravitational models with massive degrees of freedom \u2013 albeit massless gluons and gravitons \u2013 can be formulated by choosing jH from the Cartan of the R-symmetry. In particular, we may take jH = m1\u03b7\u0303 1 a\u03b7 a 1+m2\u03b7\u0303 2 a\u03b7 a 2 in the two-twistor models SCB and Ssugra. For generic parameters m1 and m2, this results in non-supersymmetric models with massive scalars and fermions (and spin-1 in the supergravity model); no mass can be assigned to the spin-2 field since it transforms trivially under the R-symmetry. It is also possible to preserve a residual N = 2 supersymmetry for gauge theory (and N = 4 for supergravity) by constructing the current jH from only one Cartan generator with m2 = 0.\nLoops from a gluing operator. This two-twistor string provides an alternative formulation of the massless ambitwistor string [29], but in a framework in which a massless field can be deformed to go off-shell. This allows us to adapt the elegant method of deriving loop amplitudes in [57] via a gluing operator but now to theories with fermions and supersymmetry such as super\nYang\u2013Mills theory. This construction arises from the vector model of the ambitwistor string, where it has been shown that loop integrands can be localized on a nodal sphere rather than the torus that more usually arises in string theory [32, 33]. At the level of the worldsheet model, this nodal structure of loop correlators is realized in the worldsheet CFT as the gluing operator \u2206, which encodes the propagator of the target-space field theory. One-loop amplitudes then have two equivalent descriptions; a string-inspired one as correlators on a torus, and an alternative representation as g = 0 correlators in the presence of a gluing operator."
