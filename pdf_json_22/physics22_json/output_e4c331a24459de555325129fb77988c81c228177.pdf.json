    "abstractText": "The objective of this work is to evaluate the applicability of exchange coupling between nanoparticles of Nd2Fe14B (hard magnetic material) and Fe90Al10 (soft magnetic material), as permanent magnets produced by surfactant-assisted mechanical alloying. The obtained powders were then mixed with 85% of the Nd2Fe14B system and 15% of the Fe90Al10 system and subsequently sintered at 300 \u25e6C, 400 \u25e6C and 500 \u25e6C for one hour. The results obtained by M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometry (MS) show a ferromagnetic behavior with six magnetic sites represented by sextets (16k1, 16k2, 8j1, 8j2, 4c and 4e), characteristic of the Nd2Fe14B system. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show a tetragonal and BCC structure for the Nd2Fe14B and FeAl systems, respectively. The results obtained by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), for mixtures of the Nd2Fe14B and Fe90Al10 sy stems sintered at 300 \u25e6C, 400 \u25e6C and 500 \u25e6C, allow for the conclusion that the coercive field (Hc) decreases drastically with temperature and the percentage of soft phase at values of Hc = 132 Oe compared to the coercive field values reported for Nd2Fe14B Hc = 6883 Oe, respectively. Images obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), for the Fe90Al10 system, show a tendency for the nanoparticles to agglomerate.",

            "text": "Permanent magnets based on rare earth (RE) elements, such as Nd2Fe14B, play a fundamental role in current and emerging technologies; they are found in commonly used devices (computers, speakers, smartphones, etc.), in the development of electric vehicles, and are an indispensable input for the construction of electrical generators capable of producing electrical energy from renewable natural sources such as water (hydroelectric power), wind (wind power) and the sea (wave energy) [1\u20137]. For this reason, the design of high-performance permanent magnets represents a need at the industrial level [1,2,5\u20137]. Permanent magnets usually contain large amounts of RE and other elements that are difficult to supply, such as Pr, Sm, Dy, Tb, Nd and Co, most of which are mined in foreign countries such as China, Congo, Russia and the United States [1\u20134]. Therefore, a huge gap crisis has been generated between the supply and demand of these magnets due to the unavailability of these raw materials and the difficulty in supplying them [1\u20133]. Taking into account this problem, recent studies have focused on the search for alternatives to produce magnets with a high energy density (BH)max using the smallest possible amount of rare earths [1,2,5,7\u201310]. Thus, the development of producing a two-phase nanocomposite formed by two magnetic phases, a hard one with high anisotropy (NdFeB or SmCo) coupled with a soft one with high magnetization (Fe, FeSi or FeCo), has gained great relevance in recent years and is considered the new generation of permanent magnets [1,4,7\u201311]. These exchange-coupled magnets average the magnetization and anisotropy of the two\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7190. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27217190 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7190 2 of 12\nconstituents [8]. However, to have a positive impact on (BH)max, one of the direct effects is the improvement of the coercivity by the reduction of the grain size, which should be proportional to the width of the hard phase domain wall, allowing for the optimization of the exchange coupling [1\u20134,8]. The great challenge for researchers today remains in designing nanocomposites at a nanometer scale where the separation between hard and soft grains does not exceed 50 nm [1\u20134,8]. Recently, it has been shown that one process route to obtain nanoparticles with grain sizes smaller than 30 nm is by surfactant-assisted mechanical alloying [12]. In this work, Nd2Fe14B and Fe90Al10 samples produced by arc melting and surfactant-assisted mechanical alloying were structurally and magnetically characterized. In addition, the exchange coupling study of a nanocomposite formed by Nd2Fe14B/Fe90Al10 and heat treated at different temperatures (300 \u25e6C, 400 \u25e6C and 500 \u25e6C) for one hour was carried out."

Here, we can observe that for the three diffractograms, there is only the presence of the phase corresponding to the Fe90Al10 system, with a BCC (cubic) structure and lattice parameter of (2.88 \u00c5) [13\u201315]. This is a consequence of the effect of the milling time by not promoting secondary phases. Additionally, as shown in Table 1, we can observe the X-ray parameters (lattice parameter, crystallite size and weight fraction) of the crystalline phases present in the diffractograms of Figure 1, which were refined with an FeAl phase. Figure 2 shows the TEM images of the Fe90Al10 nanoparticles obtained by surfactantassisted mechanical alloying after 48 h.

Due t th line width, the spectra of the sample was fitted with a magnetic hyperfine field distribution (HMFD). The result of the HMFD is shown on the right side of Figure 3, where it is observed that the distribution has a single site, or more likely a site near 310 kOe. After fitting, a mean hyperfine field of 318 kOe is obtained which is smaller than the field of pure Fe as a consequence of the substitution of Fe by Al atoms. These results are similar to those reported by other authors [13]. Figure 4 shows the spectra of the sample mechanically alloyed with oleic acid as a surfactant for 48 h of milling time, which was fitted with an HMFD (blue line), whose spectral area corresponds to 70%, with a mean-field of 320 kOe, and a doublet whose spectral area is 30% (red line) [13]. This behavior can be explained because the mechanical alloying promotes the diffusion of atoms in the BCC structure. Therefore, now 70% of the Fe sites will be surrounded by many first neighbors of Fe, leading to ferromagnetic behavior, and 30% of the remaining Fe sites will be surrounded by first neighbors of Al, leading to paramagnetic behavior. This interpretation is due to the unique presence of the\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7190 4 of 12\nBCC phase, as given by XRD. Here, the average hyperfine field of the milled sample is higher than the average hyperfine field of the thermally treated sample, indicating that the ferromagnetic sites of the milled sample are richer in Fe than the sites of the thermally treated sample (fewer atoms of the first neighbors).

Experimental Process\nFine Fe and Al powders of 99.5% and 99% purity were melted in an arc furnace and sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for seven (7) days. From the alloy obtained, powders were obtained with a diamond file. These powders and the fine powder of Nd2Fe14B (with a purity of 99% and an average particle size of 150) were mechanically alloyed with surfactant (oleic acid) in a planetary ball mill (Fritsch Pulverisette 5) at 280 rpm with a ball-to-powder ratio of 20/1 for 24 and 48 h milling times [18]. Finally, the soft (Fe90Al10) and hard (Nd2Fe14B) phases were mixed for 48 h, with milling times at 15% and 85%, respectively. Then, the mixture was heat treated at 300 \u00b0C, 400 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C for one hour. Structural and magnetic characterization were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometry (MS) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). XRD measurements were performed at room temperature using Cu-K\u03b1 radiation. The diffraction patterns were refined using the Rietveld method using the GSAS program [19], from the refinement of the calibration sample (LaB6).

            "text": "The Fe90Al10 alloy produced by surfactant-assisted mechanical alloying forms a soft magnetic material with a BCC structure. The milling process decreases the particle size to the nanometer scale, promoting a tendency to agglomeration [21]. The M\u00f6ssbauer results showed that the hyperfine field of the material decreases with milling time, showing a paramagnetic site due to the substitution of aluminum atoms by iron atoms in its crystal structure. The commercial Nd2Fe14B alloy presents a tetragonal structure; this was mechanically alloyed, and assisted with surfactant in order to reduce the particle size. The M\u00f6ssbauer results showed the presence of six magnetic sites (sextets), characteristic of the Nd2Fe14B unit cell [1\u20135]. The VSM results show a reduction of the coercive field with milling time, which is related to the increase of the amorphous part in the sample as a consequence of the milling time. The nanocomposite formed by (Nd2Fe14B/Fe90Al10), and heat treated at 300, 400 and 500 \u25e6C, does not show an exchange coupling between the two magnetic systems, evidencing a soft magnetic behavior, characteristic of the Fe90Al10 alloy, as observed by XRD.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.J.G.R. and D.O.L.; methodology, H.B.R. and Y.R.M.; software, J.S.T.H.; validation, G.A.P.A., L.E.Z.A. and A.J.G.R.; formal analysis, A.J.G.R. and D.O.L.; investigation, A.J.G.R.; resources, H.B.R.; data curation, J.S.T.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.J.G.R., D.O.L., G.A.P.A. and J.S.T.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.A.P.A., D.O.L. and J.S.T.H.; visualization, Y.R.M.; supervision, D.O.L.; project administration, D.O.L. and H.B.R.; funding acquisition, H.B.R.
