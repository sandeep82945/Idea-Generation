 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Develop more efficient algorithms to solve the matching and stability problems, such as using column generation, to handle larger networks and more user groups. 

2. Incorporate more detailed operational constraints for transit and MOD services, such as vehicle scheduling, fleet sizing, and rebalancing constraints. This could allow for evaluating impacts on operations.

3. Model dynamics over time, such as time-dependent demand, congestion, and pricing. This could capture peak spreading effects and optimal pricing strategies. 

4. Incorporate mode choice modeling and elastic demand to endogenously model the dummy link utilities based on availability of alternatives outside the MaaS platform.

5. Extend the model to competitive platforms and analyze equilibrium outcomes between platforms. This could provide insights into competitiveness, differentiation, and regulation of MaaS platforms.
