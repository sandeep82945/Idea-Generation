    "abstractText": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are keeping computers busy around the world, generating a huge amount of data that is typically not open to the scientific community. Pioneering efforts to ensure the safety and reusability of MD data ha v e been based on the use of simple databases providing a limited set of standard analyses on single-short trajectories. Despite their value, these databases do not offer a true solution for the current community of MD users, who want a flexible analysis pipeline and the possibility to address huge non-Mark o vian ensembles of large systems. Here we present a new paradigm for MD databases, resilient to large systems and long trajectories, and designed to be compatible with modern MD simulations. The data are offered to the community through a web-based graphical user interface (GUI), implemented with state-of-the-art tec hnology, whic h incorporates system-specific analysis designed by the trajectory providers. A REST API and associated J up yter Notebooks are integrated into the platf orm, allo wing fully customiz ed meta-analy sis b y final users. T he ne w technology is illustrated using a collection of trajectories obtained by the community in the context of the effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The server is accessible at https://bioe x cel-cv19.bsc.es/ #/ . It is free and open to all users and there are no login requirements. It is also integrated into the simulations section of the BioExcel-MolSSI COVID-19 Molecular Str uct ure and T herapeutics Hub : https://co vid.molssi.org/simulations/ and is part of the MDDB effort ( https://mddbr.eu ).

The picosecond-long trajectories of systems containing a few thousand atoms obtained in the 1970s have led to millisecond-long trajectories on systems containing millions of atoms ( 9\u201312 ). These technical improvements, combined with continuous refinements of force fields (FFs) ( 13\u201315 ), have convinced a large community of biologists and chemists of the predictive power of MD simulations.

No data are shared with the rest of the community and some simulations are repeated hundreds of times under identical conditions by different groups (sometimes even by the same one). Computer resources are wasted, data are not subjected to post-processing in search of additional information, learning from trajectories to improve FFs becomes impossible, and meta-analysis seeking to obtain information from a set of systems sharing common characteristics cannot be performed. In summary, and in the context of data management, the MD community should move to a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) model that is transversally implemented in all fields of the biosciences.\nEarly initiatives to store MD data in a reusable format started a decade ago. These were focused on proteins and aimed to cover a representative subset of the PDB to obtain a pan-proteome description of protein dynamics ( 17\u201319 ). A few family-specific databases have since been developed ( 20\u2013 22 ), and some initiatives have focused on DNA ( 23 ,24 ). All these databases store coordinates\u2014typically without the associated metadata\u2014mainly obtained with a single MD engine by the same group developing the database. They offer the final user a limited set of predefined analyses through a rigid web-graphical interface. Most of these databases were created assuming Markovian ensembles, i.e. single trajectories, and only a few of them allow the generation of meta-trajectories by combining individual trajectories for the same system ( 23 ). While these pioneering efforts have shown the community the potential and power of storing MD trajectories, they do not provide a solution for managing the information gathered from last-generation MD simulations. New platforms should be prepared for huge systems and non-Markovian ensembles, should implant system-specific analysis and should face the need for more flexible and tailored analyses from the final user.\nHere we present a new paradigm for MD database generation. We demonstrate its power in a new database comprising trajectories obtained by dozens of groups in the context of the effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of submitting this paper, the database contains \u223c10 4 (and still growing) trajectories, including classical single trajectories, replica exchange, massive parallel simulations, Markov State Models, biased trajectories, etc. The analyses are tailored for the simulated system, and the user has complete programmatic access to data to perform new on-demand analysis. Developed within the EU MDDB project ( https:// mddbr.eu/ #/ ), the server is accessible at https:// bioexcel-cv19.bsc.es/ #/ . It is free and open to all users and there are no login requirements. It is also integrated into the simulations section of the BioExcel-MolSSI COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub : https:// covid.molssi.org/ simulations/ linked to the EU BioExcel project."

Note that to gain efficient data access and retrieval in the document-based structure of MongoDB, the raw trajectory is converted into an in-house binary format (Supplementary Figure S1).\nThe MongoDB distributed database is deployed in the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), using an Open Nebula private cloud infrastructure. The current COVID19 database uses 18 Virtual Machines (VMs), each of them with a local 6 TB disk, configured as a combination of three replication machines (i.e. mirroring data services), each containing six shards (i.e. distributed data servers). Data are split across multiple instances (shards), and each shard is cloned in different machines (replicas). This scheme offers load balancing, thereby distributing a batch of tasks over the set of available resources, and it allows for parallelized data processing, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of the overall processing. The current database has a total capacity of 108 TB (extendable easily to up to 300 TB). The server portal is also implemented on top of a VM deployed in the same private cloud, allowing direct and efficient connection to the database using the Node.js MongoDB driver. Interestingly, the database system can grow easily to incorporate other databases following the same infrastructure model."

All these databases are monitored continuously to identify new entries to transfer and analyze.\nAs of August 2023, the database contains > 10K MD simulations, with an accumulated time of 12.7 ms, and covering the following 11 S AR S-CoV-2 protein units: Spike; Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2); Receptor Binding Domain (RBD); RBD-ACE2 complex; 3C-like protease (3CLpro); Papain-like Protease (PLPro); polymerase; NonStructural Proteins (NSP); nucleoproteins; membrane proteins; and other proteins (Figure 2 ).

            "text": "The database is open to new simulations and is expected to grow through the addition of new information to be incorporated into the MDDB database infrastructure ( https://mddbr. eu/) in the coming months. Deposited data can consist of one or several trajectories (collections) that fulfill a series of requirements:\n\u2022 Datasets should correspond to MD simulation trajectories of COVID-19-related proteins (e.g. S AR S-CoV-2 main protease, Spike, ACE2, etc.), alone or complexed with proteins or small ligands. \u2022 Dehydrated trajectories should be imaged and individual frames superimposed. Trajectory can be split into multiple files if necessary. Accepted formats are explained in the Analysis Pipeline & Database Loader section below. \u2022 Trajectories should be accompanied by a topology file (PDB files are acceptable). The BioExcel COVID-19 internal workflow uses a collection of biomolecular tools for handling trajectory and topology formats. Refer to the tool\u2019s documentation for additional information. \u2022 Submission should include a series of mandatory metadata items, but we encourage providing metadata covering the entire form (see BioExcel COVID-19 deposition form in the Appendix of the Supplementary Data). \u2022 The data-providers are responsible for the quality of the deposited trajectory and should fulfill quality requirements shown in (Supplementary Table S2). Additionally, before deposition, the internal analysis pipeline checks the simulation for the following: (i) topology and trajectory coordinate matching; (ii) periodic boundary conditions or imaging problems; (iii) topology problems (e.g. incorrect number of bonds); (iv) root mean square deviations (RMSd, RMSd per residue, pairwise RMSd); (v) radius of gyration (Rgyr); (vi) atomistic fluctuations; (vii) principal component analysis (PCA) and (viii) solventaccessible surface area (S AS A). Future tests will be implemented as accepted by the community. Unusual behaviors (Supplementary Table S2) are communicated to the authors who should confirm if they were expected due to the type of simulation. \u2022 Datasets should ideally (but not mandatorily) be supported by a scientific publication or indexed document (e.g. zenodo). Publications in press or submitted are acceptable, with the possibility to keep data on hold until the publication is available.\nWe would like to stress here the importance of data and metadata standards. Assessing the quality of the trajectories is not straightforward, especially when working with enhanced sampling or biased simulations. This quality check requires curated information about the simulation, and there is a clear need for a community effort to raise accepted validation metrics.\nAnalysis pipeline and database loader In addition to the analysis undertaken in the checking part, the system performs a series of analyses that are system-specific, in most cases proposed by the authors of the simulations (see below). The analyses are performed with a collection of biomolecular tools (Supplementary Table S3), integrated into a reproducible workflow\navailable in GitLab: https:// mmb.irbbarcelona.org/ gitlab/ d. beltran.anadon/MoDEL-workflow . The workflow accepts trajectory and topology formats written by the most popular MD engines (AMBER ( 27 ), GROMACS ( 28 ), NAMD ( 29 ), OpenMM ( 30 ) and Desmond ( 31 )). New analyses are constantly being integrated. Note that programmatic access allows tailored analysis by the final user (see below).\nThe set of analyses is uploaded into the database together with the trajectory data, topology and metadata information ( Project, Topologies, Analyses and Trajectories collections, Figure 1 ). Furthermore, the loader automatically retrieves data from external biological databases associated with the sequence / structure of interest, thereby extending the amount of accompanying information for each simulation ( SeqRef and StructRef collections, Figure 1 )."

The endpoints allow a programmatic browse of the database, retrieval of information from the projects, and download of the simulation topology and trajectory. Most of the endpoints take the project accession code (persistent identifier) as input. The trajectory endpoint allows the extraction and download of MD trajectories from the database, with the possibility to specify a particular frame range and protein region. As an example, the atomistic coordinates of only the backbone atoms for a representative set of frames, say one every 10 frames, can be directly queried (Supplementary Figure S2). The trajectory is then automatically generated using the power of the noSQL MongoDB. A similar query can be made with the structure endpoint to generate a matching structure.\nTo achieve interoperability between the life sciences and materials disciplines, an implementation of the BioExcel COVID-19 REST API has been developed and deployed, following the Open Databases Integration for Materials Design (OPTIMADE) specifications ( https://bioexcel-cv19.bsc. es/ optimade/ ), which are the standard in material science ( 32 )."

A second example analyses simulations of ACE2 protein interaction with S AR S-CoV-2 spike RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) by M. Hongying Chen and coworkers and explores the impact of the N501Y mutation in different variants of the virus on ACE2-Spike binding ( 33 ). Although differences in the average interaction energies are mild (Figure 3 C), hydrogen bond interactions with the residues surrounding the mutation are altered (Figure 3 D). A last example uses a collection of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) simulations to study the interactions of the viral non-structural proteins 12 (NSP12), NSP8 and NSP7 with RNA (Figure 3 E). Residues involved in the RNA recognition can be spotted from the interaction energies, which show that while no strong interactions occur with NSP7 and NSP8, strong interactions do take place between RNA and NSP12. The available notebook also exemplifies how to download a number of frames from one of the RdRp simulations and explores the dynamics of these residues through the NGL viewer ( 34 ,35 )."

The first ones include global (RMSd, Rgyr, pairwise RMSd, PCA) and local (RMSd per residue, S AS A) descriptors (Figure 5 A\u2013 C). Interaction analyses include Poisson Boltzmann \u2013 classical molecular interaction potentials estimate of interaction energies ( 42 ), as well as residue contacts and hydrogen bonds (Figure 5 D, E). Finally, system-specific analyses show information considered essential by the authors of the simulations and they are specifically coupled to the molecule of interest. Examples of these analyses are Spike mutations or epitopes (Figure 5 F, G), or the Markov State Model (MSM) centroids, population and transitions between them. Epitopes have been mined from experimental structures in the PDB, defining the S AR S-CoV-2 interface residues as those being at less than 5 \u00c5ngstroms from the antibodies.

Such storge is a requirement to not only guarantee the reproducibilty of the results and the robustness of conclusions derived rom the simulations but also to facilitate further analysis and eta-analysis by the community. Tools to store trajectories nd make them accessible to the MD community are required nd should be adopted by the community in the same way s the structural biology community adopted the PDB. A nice xample of a community effort was done in the context of the ght against the COVID-19 pandemic. The processing, curatng and sharing of these data to facilitate proper analysis are as ecessary as they are challenging. Several criteria to perform hese steps have been discussed and applied to set up a new atabase as proof of concept. A new tool for researchers to asily access stored data, both programmatically and through isual interface, has also been developed. Although it is clear hat maintaining a centralized infrastructure for MD simulaions is not realistic, we believe this project will be the perect prototype for new federated / distributed infrastructures, here compatible DB deployments will be connected by a entral server, avoiding unnecessary data transfer.
