Follow-up optical spectroscopic observations onducted with the Bolshoi Teleskop Alt-azimutalnyi (BTA) 6-m elescope revealed a broad Ly \u03b1 emission line with neutral hydrogen H I ) absorption (Khorunzhev et al. 2021 ); the authors estimated a edshift of z em = 5.466 \u00b1 0.003.

The olometric luminosity and black hole mass of J1702 + 1301 are in ood agreement with the z 6 quasars already disco v ered (e.g. e Rosa et al. 2014 ; Mazzucchelli et al. 2017 ; Wang et al. 2019 ). 1702 + 1301 represents the tip of the iceberg of high- z extremely uminous quasars that contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs) hich were formed rapidly in the early Universe and accreting at high ddington ratios. The existence of such SMBHs just \u223c1 Gyr after he Big Bang places strong constraints on the models of seed black ole formation. Jets may promote rapid accretion and thus accelerate he growth of seed black holes into SMBHs (Jolley & Kuncic 2008 ; hisellini et al. 2013 ), therefore studying high- z jetted AGN helps s to test this hypothesis. The radio counterpart of J1702 + 1301 has been detected in the\nRAO VLA Sk y Surv e y (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998 ) image at .4 GHz, with a flux density of \u223c28 mJy, one of the few radiorightest sources among the high-redshift quasars at z 5 (Perger t al. 2017 ; Belladitta et al. 2020 ).

The natural dea of finding high-redshift luminous sources from the eROSITA urv e y comparable to the X-ray luminosities of the two known arliest blazars is that the newly detected objects are also blazars.\nJ1702 + 1301 has also been detected in the Very Large Array Sky urv e y (VLASS) at 3 GHz (Gordon et al. 2020 ), but not detected by\nhe Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 150 MHz (Intema t al. 2017 ). Its radio loudness parameter R 1 is preliminarily estimated o be \u223c1200 (Khorunzhev et al. 2021 ), a typical value for lowedshift blazars but an extremely high value for high-redshift quasars Ba \u0303 nados et al. 2015 ; Sotnikova et al. 2021 ). Among the active alactic nuclei (AGNs) with z > 5, only a very small number of hem, including J1702 + 1301 have R exceeding 10 3 (Romani et al. 004 ; Ba \u0303 nados et al. 2018 ; Belladitta et al. 2019 ; Ighina et al. 2021 ; otnikova et al. 2021 ). In the NVSS image (resolution of 45 arcsec), he radio source remains an unresolved structure, while in the VLASS resolution of 2.5 arcsec) image, the NVSS source is resolved into two omponents. Higher resolution radio observational data are needed o characterize the radio emission of J1702 + 1301.\nThis paper presents new radio images of J1702 + 1301 from MRT, Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and Australian Square ilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations, and flux density onitoring data from the RATAN-600 telescope. These data help us o understand more clearly the classification and radio properties of his high- z X-ray bright quasar.\nDATA A N D RESULTS\n.1 MWA\nhe MWA (Tingay et al. 2013 ) is the precursor telescope of the quare Kilometre Array (SKA) low-frequency array. The GaLactic nd Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) urv e y is the wide-field continuum imaging surv e y of the MWA Wayth et al. 2015 ) co v ering the sky south of declination + 30 \u25e6 v er a frequency range of 72\u2013231 MHz (Hurley-Walker et al. 017 ). GLEAM was carried out with the MWA Phase I between 013 August and 2015 July, with the longest baseline of \u223c3 km. he highest resolution of the GLEAM images is about 2 arcmin. he root-mean-square ( rms ) noise of GLEAM images is 10 mJy eam \u22121 . We examined the GLEAM archive images 2 and found no lear detection at the location of J1702 + 1301 due to the high rms oise. Higher sensitivity and higher resolution radio images at these ow frequencies are necessary to constrain the radio spectrum of 1702 + 1301 below and around \u03bdrest = 1 GHz (the source\u2019s rest rame). Therefore, we collected the unreleased data observed with he MWA Phase II, consisting of an extended array of 256 tiles and ith the longest baseline of up to 6 km (Wayth et al. 2018 ). The aLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky MWA-eXtended (GLEAM-X) urv e y based on MWA Phase II (Hurley-Walker et al. 2022 ) has an ngular resolution of \u223c45 arcsec at 216 MHz, with a mean image oise lower than GLEAM by a factor of \u223c7. The GLEAM-X data\nNRAS 519, 4047\u20134055 (2023)\nThe conventional radio-optical radioloudness parameter R is defined as the atio between two monochromatic fluxes S 5GHz /S 4400 \u00c5(Kellermann et al. 989 ), where R < 10 for radioquiet AGNs and R > 10 for radioloud AGNs. The GLEAM postage stamp service: http://gleam-vo.icr ar .org/gleam posta e/q/form\nn c c i\n3\nere recorded in five near-contiguous channels of 30.72 MHz each. he observations were made in the snapshot mode, each snapshot\nasting 2 min and cycling between the fiv e frequenc y channels. e downloaded the GLEAM-X data to the clusters of China SKA egional Centre (An, Wu & Hong 2019 ; An et al. 2022a ) and then rocessed them following the pipeline developed by the GLEAM-X eam. 3 The final deep images shown in Fig. 1 were obtained from combination of the astrometrically corrected and primary-beamorrected snapshot images observed between 2018 March 12 and 019 May 21 through a mosaicking procedure.\n.2 GMRT\nhe GMRT (Swarup 1991 ) observations were carried out at 321, 607, nd 1383 MHz on 2021 May 28, May 30, and June 7, respectively proposal id: DDT179). A bandwidth of 32 MHz centred at the requencies mentioned abo v e was used in the observations. The MRT Softw are Back end (GSB) w as used as the back end correlator. he on-source times were \u224830 min, \u224829 min, and \u224821 min in he three observed bands, respectively. 3C 48 was used as the ux density calibrator in the 321 and 1383 MHz observations. For he 607 MHz observation, the sky position of 3C 48 during the bservation was not suitable for this observation, so we used 3C 468.1 s the flux density calibrator. We used the spectral index model arameters of 3C 468.1 to estimate its flux density at 607 MHz, hich was interpolated by fitting the literature data with a fourthrder polynomial function (Riseley et al. 2017 ). Further, 1640 + 123 as used as the phase calibrator for the observations at 321 and 383 MHz, and 1737 + 063 was used as the calibrator at 607 MHz. he complex bandpass functions of each telescope were calibrated sing the flux density calibrator 3C 48 or 3C 468.1. Except for a ew edge channels, the data from other channels were combined and v eraged o v er frequencies to impro v e the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). fter applying phase calibration solutions from the phase calibrator o the target J1702 + 1301, we extracted the data of J1702 + 1301 for elf-calibration and imaging. The final images are shown in Fig. 2 . he rms noise in the images is 0.25 mJy beam \u22121 at 321 MHz, 0.08 Jy beam \u22121 at 607 MHz, and 0.13 mJy beam \u22121 at 1383 MHz, espectively. We fit Gaussian models to the source components in all radio mages using the task IMFIT integrated into the Common Astronomy oftware Applications ( CASA ; McMullin et al. 2007 ). The model fit s conducted in the image domain which exports the peak flux density nd right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec) positions, integrated ux density, and deconvolved size (full-width at half-maximum, WHM) of the radio component. The fitted parameters are listed in able 1 . If the fitted component leads to an unresolved point source odel, the upper limit to the component size is estimated using the omponent SNR and beam information of the image according to the elation given by Lobanov ( 2005 ). In addition to the model fitting rror, we also considered the systematic error due to the visibility mplitude calibration, which typically accounts for a few per cent of he measured flux density.\nFig. 2 shows the 1.4 GHz, 610 MHz, and 321 MHz GMRT images. he unresolved NVSS source is clearly resolved into two compoents, with the north-east (NE) component being brighter and more ompact than the south-west (SW) component. The NE component is lose to the optical position of J1702 + 1301, and the SW component s close to an infrared (IR) source WISEA J170243.84 + 130052.0\nht tps://github.com/t jgalvin/GLEAM- X- pipeline\nIs J1702 + 1301 a blazar? 4049\nFigure 1.

We discuss the adio structure in detail in Section 3 . .3 ASKAP he ASKAP (Hotan et al. 2021 ) is a precursor telescope of the KA-Mid. The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Surv e y (RACS) is the rst shallow large-area surv e y conducted with all 36 antenna before he deep surv e ys are carried out with the full 36-antenna ASKAP McConnell et al. 2020 ). The RACS observations began on 2019 pril 21 and finished on 2020 June 21. RACS co v ers the sk y south f declination + 41 \u25e6 o v er a 288-MHz band centred at 887.5 MHz.

The peak flux density is 11 nd 10 mJy beam \u22121 in the 2019 and 2020 images, respectively. he resolution of the RACS images is \u223c15 arcsec, between the esolutions of the 1.4-GHz and 0.61-GHz GMRT images; all these mages consistently show two identical radio components associated ith J1702 + 1301 and J1702-SW, respectively.\nNRAS 519, 4047\u20134055 (2023)\nCASDA Observation Search: https:// data.csiro.au/ domain/casdaObservatio .\nw o\n6\n.4 VLA\ne downloaded the image of J1702 + 1301 from the NVSS Postage tamp Server. 6 The NVSS covers almost all of the sky north of EC = \u221240 \u25e6 at a central frequency of 1.4 GHz (Condon et al. 1998 ). he angular resolution of NVSS is 45 arcsec, and the rms noise\nn the total intensity images is \u03c3 \u2248 0.45 mJy beam \u22121 . The radio ounterpart of J1702 + 1301 is detected at RA = 17h02m45.18s, ec = + 13d01m01.0s, consistent with its optical position within \u03c3 p . The peak and integrated flux density of J1702 + 1301 is 24.4 Jy beam \u22121 and 27.8 \u00b1 0.4 mJy, respectively. The Very Large Array Sk y Surv e y (VLASS; Lacy et al. 2020 ) is nother large-area continuum surv e y made by the VLA after NVSS ith an increased observing frequency of 3 GHz and a higher angular esolution of 2.5 arcsec (a factor of 18 higher than that of NVSS). LASS co v ers the same sky area as NVSS. The sensitivity of the tacked images is \u223c 70 \u03bcJy. In the VLASS images (Fig. 4 ), the NE omponent is clearly detected abo v e 50 \u03c3 . J1702-SW is weaker but till detected with 6.6 \u03c3\u201310.0 \u03c3 . The morphology of NE is compact, nd SW shows a resolved morphology. No significant feature is etected between the NE and SW components.\n.5 RATAN-600\nhe RATAN-600 is a meridian radio telescope with a ring-shaped ariable profile antenna (Korolkov & Pariiskii 1979 ; Parijskij 1993 ; otnikov a 2020 ) allo wing us to obtain radio spectra at the frequencies f 2.3, 4.7, 8.2, 11.2, and 22.3 GHz quasi-simultaneously within 3\u2013 min. The angular resolution depends on the declination of the ource. For J1702 + 1301, the angular resolution in right ascension s 48, 26, and 20 arcsec at 4.7, 8.2, and 11.2 GHz, respectively; the ngular resolutions in declination are \u223c4 times worse than in RA. bservations of J1702 + 1301 were made in 15 epochs from 2020 ecember to 2022 October, with 3\u201331 measurements per observing poch to impro v e the signal-to-noise ratio. The observations were rocessed using an automated data reduction system (Udovitskiy t al. 2016 ) based on the Flexible Astronomical Data Processing ystem (FADPS) standard data reduction software (Verkhodanov 997 ). The observational statistics and measured flux densities for 1702 + 1301 are presented in Table 2 .\nWe know from the analysis in Section 3 that J1702-SW is a steeppectrum radio source that contributes a small fraction to the total flux ensity at 5 GHz and abo v e. Therefore, we can assume that most of he RATAN-600 flux densities at \u03bd 5 GHz come from J1702 + 1301. he light curves are shown in Fig. 5 . For some epochs without ufficiently significant signals (SNR \u2264 3), the data are not included. his quasar demonstrates moderate variability (30\u201340 per cent) at .7, 8.2, and 11.2 GHz o v er a monitoring period of almost two years, ith the fractional variability values: F var = 0.41 \u00b1 0.06 at 4.7 GHz, var = 0.35 \u00b1 0.03 at 8.2 GHz. F var is calculated by the relation from aughan et al. ( 2003 ). At 4.7 GHz, the highest variability amplitude s approximately 2.5 times the average value in the quiescent state \u223c6 mJy), with the bursts lasting 1\u20134 months (corresponding to 4\u2013 9 d in the source\u2019s rest frame). The average flux density at 8.2 GHz n the quiescent state is about 10 mJy, and the strongest flare is .9 times higher. The data sampling at 11.2 GHz is sparse and does ot allow an accurate assessment of the quiescent-state flux density. he maximum flux density at 11.2 GHz is 23 mJy. The three epochs ith pronounced variability are highlighted in the right-hand panel f Fig. 5 .\nhttps:// www.cv.nrao.edu/ nvss/postage.shtml\nIs J1702 + 1301 a blazar? 4051\nFigure 4.

In low-resolution VSS and MWA images, this region shows only an unresolved ource. But it is resolved into two components in ASKAP, GMRT, nd VLASS images: J1702 + 1301 (the NE component) and J1702W (23.5 arcsec to the south-west). Could NE and SW be radio components of the same AGN? The\nreatest difficulty in this scenario lies in interpreting the inferred ltra-long jet of J1702 + 1301. According to the definition of a uasar in the AGN unified scheme, a core-dominated quasar has viewing angle of less than 10 \u25e6 (Ghisellini et al. 1993 ). If NE s the core and SW is the lobe, the separation between NE and W is 145 kpc, indicating that the intrinsic jet length will exceed 40 kpc and making J1702 + 1301 the only high-redshift z > 5 uasar observed with an Mpc-scale jet. This jet length is very rare n the high-redshift Universe and is three orders of magnitude larger han that previously found in the z = 5.84 quasar PSO J352.40345.3373 (Momjian et al. 2018 ). The strength of the inverse-Compton\ncattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons ncreases with (1 + z) 4 , rendering the survi v al of extended jets in the igh- z Universe a great challenge (Ghisellini et al. 2015 ). Moreover, he dense interstellar medium of the host galaxies of the high- z AGN orms a substantial obstacle to the jet growth (An et al. 2020 , 2022b ), imiting a significant fraction (even majority) of the jets to a few kpc Falcke, K \u0308ording & Nagar 2004 ). Therefore, it is unlikely that NE nd SW belong to one source.\nAre NE and SW in a dual AGN system? We show the radio VLASS) and optical (PAN-STARRS1) o v erlaid images in the leftand panel of Fig. 6 . The optical morphology of SW looks diffuse and nconsistent with the high-redshift quasars observed so far. We then stimated the photometric redshift of J1702-SW to be 0.677 based n the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Abdurro\u2019uf et al. 2022 ) nd Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) photometry data Wright et al. 2010 ; Cutri et al. 2021 ) using a public software program f Easy and Accurate Redshifts from Yale (EAZY; Brammer, van okkum & Coppi 2008 ). We used a set of nine templates from rammer et al. ( 2008 ) that combine the Simple Stellar Population odels (Conroy, Gunn & White (Maraston 2005 ; Conroy, Gunn & hite 2009 ) with varying dust attenuation and ages along with mission line models. The photometric redshift obtained using the ECaLS data (Dey et al. 2019 ) for the SED fitting is slightly o wer. Ho we ver, the south-west source displays multiple structures n the DECaLS z-band image, which causes a larger uncertainty n the estimation of the photometric redshift. Therefore, the phoometric redshift results suggest that J1702-SW is a foreground alaxy.\nWe calculated WISE W 1 \u2212 W 2 and W 2 \u2212 W 3 of J1702-SW. We ound that it is located in the transition region between spiral and tarburst galaxies in the IR colour\u2013colour diagram (Fig. 6 ), indicating hat it is an active galaxy. With this photometric redshift, we calculate ts luminosity at rest-frame 1.4 GHz to be 9.7 \u00d7 10 40 erg s \u22121 , and he corresponding star formation rate (SFR) is 4400 M yr \u22121 . The nferred SFR exceeds that of the most active starburst galaxy Arp 220 Smith et al. 1998 ; Rodr \u0301\u0131guez Zaur \u0301\u0131n, Tadhunter & Gonz \u0301alez Delgado 008 ) by a factor of 20\u201340, suggesting that the radio flux of J1702W could come from the combined contribution of star formation nd AGN.\n.2 Is J1702 + 1301 a blazar? ig. 7 shows the radio spectrum of J1702 + 1301. The o v erall radio pectrum is plotted as a comparison. The o v erall spectrum exhibits clear truncation around 5 GHz: < 5 GHz, the spectrum is flat; 5 GHz, it shows a rising spectral shape.

It basically reflects the flat spectrum characteristics of 1702 + 1301 albeit with the effect of optical variability. The unertainty caused by variability is already included in the error of the pectral index. The variability magnitude of J1702 + 1301 in low-frequency ( \u03bd \u2264 GHz) bands is insignificant on \u223c2-yr time period. For example, the ux density of the NE component (J1702 + 1301) at 3 GHz increased rom 7.7 mJy in 2019 April to 8.1 mJy in 2021 October, and changed nly 10 per cent at 888 MHz on a 1 yr time-scale. Ho we ver, its longerm variability at lower radio frequencies and the strong short-term ariability at higher radio frequencies and high energy bands are orthy of attention. Comparing the total flux density obtained by the MRT at 1.4 GHz in 2021 with that obtained by the VLA NVSS\nn 1995, we found a 2.3-fold decrease in flux density. Due to the teep spectrum feature of J1702-SW (dominated by optically thin et and star formation), we have reason to believe that the 1.4-GHz ariability o v er a time span of \u223c26 yr (4 yr in the source\u2019s rest rame) is mainly from J1702 + 1301. At 4.7 GHz (corresponding to rest \u223c30 GHz) and abo v e, the RATAN-600 light curves in Fig. 5 emonstrate prominent variability on time-scales of 4\u201319 d, with ariation scales of more than a factor of 2. Moreo v er, Khorunzhev t al. ( 2021 ) reported a 2-fold variability in X-rays of J1702 + 1301 v er a six-month period ( t rest a month). J1702 + 1301 exhibits ignificant variability at different time-scales in the X-ray and radio\nands, and the time-scales of the short-term variability obtained from he X-ray and high radio frequencies are consistent with typical lazars. These variability properties support J1702 + 1301 being a lazar.\nKhorunzhev et al. ( 2021 ) used the NVSS flux density at 1.4 GHz nd an assumed flat spectral index \u03b1 = 0 to estimate the 5-GHz ux density in the source\u2019s rest frame, S 5GHz, rest = 9.6 mJy. It is nown from our analysis abo v e that the NVSS flux density contains ontributions from both NE and SW components. Therefore, it is n o v erestimate for the flux density of J1702 + 1301. Moreo v er, our ig. 7 shows a radio spectrum of J1702 + 1301 with \u03b1NE = \u22120.17 etween 0.3 and 3 GHz, which allows us to obtain a more accurate stimate of its flux density S 5GHz, rest = 9.6 mJy.\nThe rest-frame wavelength 4400 \u00c5 for the source at z = 5.5 orresponds to the observing wavelength of 2.8 \u03bcm, close to the avelength of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey ( WISE ; Wright et al. 010 ) W 1 band. Ho we ver, WISE did not detect J1702 + 1301 in its 1 band. If we use the detection limit of W1 magnitude (Vega) of 8.84 to constrain the rest-frame optical luminosity S 4400 \u00c5, we obtain lower limit of the radio loudness parameter R > 1100.\nThe intrinsic radio luminosity of J1702 + 1301 at \u03bd5GH, rest GHz erived from the 2020 ASKAP observation is (3.8 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 43 rg s \u22121 . Its historical luminosity in the 1995 NVSS image is even igher (see the discussion of variability abo v e). The high radio uminosity makes it outstanding in z > 5 AGNs (Ba \u0303 nados et al. 015 ; Belladitta et al. 2020 ; Sotnikova et al. 2021 ). We note that everal z > 5 quasars with L 5GHz > 2 \u00d7 10 43 erg s \u22121 have all been dentified as blazars, e.g. B2 1023 + 25 (z = 5.3, Sbarrato et al. 2012 ; rey et al. 2015 ), Q0906 + 6930 ( z = 5.47, An et al. 2020 ), PSO 047.4478 + 27.2992 ( z = 6.1, Belladitta et al. 2020 ; Spingola et al. 020 ). The observational characteristics of J1702 + 1301, such as ignificant and rapid variability, high radio and X-ray luminosity, and igh radio loudness, are all consistent with its blazar identification. uture observ ational e vidence from X-rays and radio will strengthen ts identification as a blazar.\n.3 Comparison of J1702 + 1301 and J1429 + 5447 1702 + 1301 is one of the two brightest sources disco v ered in the ROSITA surv e y and has the highest X-ray luminosity among the z 5 quasars.

Whereas, they have some different observing haracteristics: J1429 + 5447 has a steep radio spectrum, while the adio spectrum of J1702 + 1301 is flat; J1429 + 5447 has no strong ariability, while J1702 + 1301 sho ws significant radio v ariability on eekly time-scales and X-ray variability on monthly time-scales; the adio loudness of J1702 + 1301 is about one order of magnitude higher han that of J1429 + 5447. These differences between J1702 + 1301 nd J1429 + 5447 may be related to the discrepancy in the relativistic eaming effects of their jets. In addition, the optical-X-ray spectra of J1702 + 1301 and 1429 + 5447 are flatter than that of radio-loud quasars (i.e. \u03b1ox is ower), suggesting an additional contribution of X-rays from the jet Miller et al. 2011 ; Ighina et al. 2019 ). This jet-related X-ray excess is ound to become more pronounced in high-redshift objects (Wu et al. 013 ; Zhu et al. 2019 ), which is associated with the enhanced inverseompton scattering with redshift. Studying J1702 + 1301 in multiple ands is essential for understanding the jet physics in extremely uminous high-redshift X-ray sources.\nC O N C L U S I O N\nRGE J170245.3 + 130104 is a high-redshift quasar disco v ered in the -ray surv e y and confirmed by the follow-up optical spectroscopic bserv ations (Khorunzhe v et al. 2021 ). It is a typical representative of xtremely luminous activ e galactic nuclei in the early Universe and s the tip of the iceberg of high-redshift quasars. Based on the newly bserved radio data and archive data, we performed a comprehensive tudy of the radio properties of J1702 + 1301. In the high-resolution mages, the radio counterpart previously detected in the NVSS image s resolved into two components separated by about 23.5 arcsec, here the north-east component corresponds to the optical and X-ray ositions of J1702 + 1301. The south-west component is associated ith a foreground infrared galaxy with an insignificant contribution o the high-frequency spectrum of J1702 + 1301. Our high-resolution adio data allow an accurate determination of the radio spectrum of 1702 + 1301. J1702 + 1301 shows a flat radio spectrum and can be lassified as a flat-spectrum radio-loud quasar. Significant variability as been observed in J1702 + 1301 in both X-ray and radio bands. e recalculated the radio loudness of J1702 + 1301 as R > 1100. It as a remarkable radio luminosity among high-redshift quasars, and he high-frequency ( \u03bdrest > 30 GHz) radio emission has rapid and arge variability, indicating active jet activity. The observed radio roperties of J1702 + 1301 provide support for it being a blazar. Highesolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) polarimetric bservations of J1702 + 1301 are critical for determining the beaming haracteristics and geometry of the jet as well as the interactions f the jet with the interstellar medium. An in-depth study of the et properties of J1702 + 1301 will not only give a clear picture of he radiative properties of J1702 + 1301 itself but also help us to nderstand the growth mode of black holes in the early Universe.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhis research has been supported by the National SKA Program of hina (2022SKA0120102, 2018YFA0404603).
