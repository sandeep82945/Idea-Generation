    "abstractText": "Infrared optical measurement has a wide range of applications in industry and science, but infrared light detectors suffer from high costs and inferior performance than visible light detectors. Four-wave mixing (FWM) process allows detection in the infrared range by detecting correlated visible light. We experimentally investigate the stimulated FWM process in a hot Rb atomic vapor cell, in which a weak infrared signal laser at 1,530 nm induces the FWM process and is amplified and converted into a strong FWM light at 780 nm, the latter can be detected more easily. We find the optimized singleand twophoton detunings by studying the dependence of the frequency of input laser on the generated FWM light. What\u2019s more, the power gain increases rapidly as the signal intensity decreases, which is consistent with our theoretical analysis. As a result, the power gain can reach up to 500 at a signal laser power of 0.1 \u03bcW and the number of detected photons increased by a factor of 250. Finally, we experimentally prove that our amplification process can work in a broad band in the frequency domain by exploring the response rate of our stimulated FWM process.",

Four-wave mixing (FWM) process allows detection in the infrared range by detecting correlated visible light. We experimentally investigate the stimulated FWM process in a hot 85Rb atomic vapor cell, in which a weak infrared signal laser at 1,530 nm induces the FWM process and is amplified and converted into a strong FWM light at 780 nm, the latter can be detected more easily. We find the optimized single- and twophoton detunings by studying the dependence of the frequency of input laser on the generated FWM light. What\u2019s more, the power gain increases rapidly as the signal intensity decreases, which is consistent with our theoretical analysis. As a result, the power gain can reach up to 500 at a signal laser power of 0.1 \u03bcW and the number of detected photons increased by a factor of 250. Finally, we experimentally prove that our amplification process can work in a broad band in the frequency domain by exploring the response rate of our stimulated FWM process.\nKEYWORDS\namplification, infared detection, conversion, stimulated, four-wave mixing\n1 Introduction\nInfrared optical measurement is an important technique for applications in scientific research and industrial production. However, infrared light detectors in infrared optical devices have higher dark count rates, lower specific detectivities, and higher cost than the detector in the visible range, and often need to be cooled (Griffiths and de Haseth, 2007). For this dilemma, researchers correlate infrared light with visible light through nonlinear optical phenomena, and measure infrared light by detecting visible light with visible light detectors (Kalashnikov et al., 2016; Paterova et al., 2018). Four-wave mixing (FWM) is a common method for generating high-power visible light (Lavoute et al., 2010) and converting infrared light to visible light (Ding et al., 2012a, d, e), the latter is investigated in our work."

In atomic system, the FWM process has been explored extensively due to its wide applications such as observing optical parametric amplification in the process of degenerate stimulated four-photon interaction (Carman et al., 1966) and optical precursors phenomena (Ding et al., 2015); generating non-classical correlated photon pairs (Ding et al., 2012c; Liu et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018) via the spontaneous FWM process for use in long-distance quantum communication (Duan et al., 2001) and optical quantum information processing (Zhang et al., 2020a); observing squeezed light (Slusher et al., 1985) and strong relative intensity squeezing (McCormick et al., 2007); exhibiting localized entanglement of twin images (Boyer et al., 2008); and converting frequency of the optical field (Radnaev et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2012b). The FWM process has been realized in atomic system with various energy-level configurations such as double-ladder type (Lee et al., 2016; Lee and Moon, 2017a), double-lambda type (Ding et al., 2013b; Zhang et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2020), diamond type (Ding et al., 2013a; Shi et al., 2020) and inverted-Y type (Wen et al., 2008). In this paper, we focus on a four-level system with a diamond-type configuration.\nThe stimulated FWMprocess with a four-level atomic system is an extensively researched topic in a double-ladder or diamond configuration. This phenomenon requires the interaction of three optical fields with the atoms in which two strong fields excite the atoms to a higher excited state (such as 5D or 4D state in rubidium atomic system) and a weak seed (driving) field induces the atoms to generate a strong FWM field. This process is also referred to as seeded FWM in some works (Zhang et al., 2020b). To date, the stimulated FWM process in a ladder-type atomic system has been studied to investigate the effects of atomic coherence on the FWM spectrum (Lee and Moon, 2016) or the relationship between three-photon electromagnetically induced absorption and FWM (Lee and Moon, 2017b). The biphoton spectral wave form of photon pairs emitted from a cascade-type atomic ensemble also can be measured by using the stimulated FWM process (Jeong et al., 2019). Recently, the amplified spontaneous emission induced self-stimulated FWM process and the stimulated FWM process have been exploited in the diamond-type atomic system (Zhang et al., 2020b), and the stimulated nondegenerate FWM phenomenon without amplified spontaneous emission has been realized in cesium atoms with a power of the generated FWM light up to 1.2 mW (Wu et al., 2022). The stimulated FWM process has also been investigated in rubidium atoms via Rydberg states (K\u00f6lle et al., 2012). To put it briefly, the stimulated FWM is generally utilized to explore precision spectroscopic measurements, atomic coherence, and efficient generation of FWM light.\nIn this paper, we report on an experimental exploration of the stimulated FWM process in a diamond-type 85Rb atomic ensemble. Realizing the amplified detection of the infrared laser by converting the weak infrared signal light into the strong visible FWM light. In this work, the atoms are excited and populated in the upper state by inputting two strong pump lasers and we make an infrared beam as a seed light to induce atoms to efficiently generate the FWM light. Specifically, we find that we can achieve the purpose of amplifying and detecting the infrared signal by detecting the strong visible FWM signal which is induced by this infrared signal. In addition, in order to investigate the response properties of the amplifier, we compare the waveforms between the input signal and the output signal for various rising edge cases."

            "text": "We experimentally realized the amplified detection of infrared signal through a stimulated FWM process in hot 85Rb atomic vapor with a four-levels diamond configuration as shown in Figure 1A. It consists of one ground state |1\u232a (5S1/ 2(F = 2)), one excited state |4\u232a (4D3/2(F\u2032\u2032 = 3)), and two intermediate states |2\u232a and |3\u232a (5P1/2(F\u2032 = 2) and 5P3/2(F\u2032 = 3)). The pump1 (795 nm) and pump2 (1,475 nm) lasers excite the atoms from |1\u232a to |2\u232a and |2\u232a to |4\u232a respectively, then the atoms decay into the ground state |1\u232a through the intermediate state |3\u232a. Since the difference between the spontaneous decay rates (\u039343) from |4\u232a to |3\u232a and the spontaneous decay rates (\u039331) from |3\u232a to |1\u232a satisfies the relation \u039343 = 0.1\u039331, the populations of |4\u232a and |3\u232a are not significantly inversed and the FWM process cannot occur obviously in the absence of the signal laser (Zhang et al., 2020b). So that we input the signal (1,530 nm) laser which interacts with the |3\u232a \u2212 |4\u232a transition to induce the FWM, and the FWM (780 nm) light can be generated strongly in the transition from |3\u232a to |1\u232a under the phase-matching condition of wave-vector conservation and energy conservation. Through this stimulated FWM process, a weak signal laser can be converted into a strong FWM light to achieve the amplification of the infrared signal laser. The detuning frequencies of the pump1, pump2, and signal lasers correspond to \u03941, \u03942 and \u03943 respectively. The experimental setup is schematically depicted in Figure 1B, where pump 1, pump2 and signal lasers are continuous waves (CW) and overlap in a 5-cm-long 85Rb cell that is heated to 140\u00b0C. The horizontally polarized pump2 beam and vertically polarized signal beam are focused into the center of the cell with the same diameter of 126 \u03bcm. The vertically polarized pump1 beam is superimposed with the pump2 beam and the signal beam through a dichromatic mirror (DM1), and has a diameter of\nFrontiers in Quantum Science and Technology frontiersin.org02\n141 \u03bcm in the focal spot. The strong pump2 laser and signal laser are filtered out by the DM2, and the pump1 laser is blocked by a subsequent interference filter (IF).

Figure 2 shows the variation of the power gain (three black curves) with the detuning frequencies of pump1, pump2, and signal lasers (\u03941, \u03942 and \u03943), where the powers of the signal, pump1 and pump2 lasers are 10 \u03bcW, 110 and 110 mW respectively. In Figure 2A, the power gain are measured when we scan the detuning frequency of pump1 \u03941 laser and the detuning frequency of pump2 \u03942 (signal \u03943) laser is fixed at 475 \u00d7 2\u03c0 MHz (\u2212190, \u00d7, 2\u03c0MHz). The maximum power gain approaches 30 when the \u03941 is equal to 0, \u00d7, 2\u03c0MHz, and the blue curve is the saturated absorption spectrum (SAS) of the pump1 field. We can find that the power gain has two peaks when the pump1 laser is resonant with the |1\u232a \u2212 |2\u232a transition and the frequency of the signal laser is satisfied with \u03943 = \u2212190, \u00d7, 2\u03c0 MHz, as shown in Figure 2B. It is due to another two peaks which are corresponded to the transitions of 5S1/2(F = 2) \u2212 5P1/2(F\u2032 = 3) \u2212 4D3/2(F\u2032\u2032 = 3) and 5S1/2(F = 2) \u2212 5P1/2(F\u2032 = 2) \u2212 4D3/2(F\u2032\u2032 = 3) in the normalized two photons spectrum (TPS) of pump2 laser (green curve) and the maximum power gain occurs at the condition of \u03942 = 475 \u00d7 2\u03c0 MHz. Figure 2C displays the power gain and the normalized TPS of the signal laser (yellow curve) when we scan the \u03943 of the signal laser under the conditions of \u03941 = 0, \u00d7, 2\u03c0 MHz and \u03942 = 475 \u00d7 2\u03c0MHz. It is obvious from Figure 2 that the single-photon detunings of pump and signal fields significantly affect the value\nof the power gain. The maximum point of the power gain reaches 30 when the \u03941, \u03942, and \u03943 are fixed at 0, \u00d7, 2\u03c0 MHz, 475 \u00d7 2\u03c0 MHz, and \u2212190, \u00d7, 2\u03c0 MHz respectively.\nIn Figure 3, we plot the power gain as a function of the signal power Is under the optimal experimental conditions we mentioned above, and the power is measured with a power meter instead of the PMT. Due to the strong pump1 and pump2 lasers, the atoms are mostly populated at the state |4\u232a via two-photon excitation. Meanwhile, the weak signal laser is converted and amplified into a strong FWM light. We can fetch the information from Figure 3 that the power gain increases rapidly with the decrease of the signal power. Figure 3A indicates that the power gain exceeds 100 when the power of the signal laser is less than 2 \u03bcW, and the power gain can be reached up to 500 in the case of Is = 0.1 \u03bcW. The amplification effect exhibits a tendency to saturation when the signal power intensity is beyond 1 mW, which is illustrated in Figure 3B. We also can defined the photon-number gain (or detection gain) Gphoton in this amplification process as the ratio of the number of output visible photons to the number of input infrared photons. Considering that the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, we can obtain the relationship Gphoton = 0.5G between photon-number gain and power gain. Similarly, the photon-number gain can reach 250 at the case of Is = 0.1 \u03bcW according to Figure 3B, which means that the number of photons detected by a detector is increased from 1 to 250.\nTo explain the amplification of signal laser in the stimulated FWM process, we theoretically calculate the relation between power gain and signal power in an atomic diamond-type energylevel system. The equation of motion can be described as (Boyd, 2003).\nz\u03c1ij zt \u2212 i Z \u2211 k Hik\u03c1kj \u2212 \u03c1ikHkj[ ] \u2212 \u0393ij\u03c1ij \u2212 \u03b3ij\u03c1ij (1) where \u03c1ij is the density-matrix element and Hij is the effective interaction Hamiltonian. The subscript indices i and j indicate the |i\u232a and |j\u232a states respectively. \u0393ij denotes the population spontaneous relaxation rate from state |i\u232a to state |j\u232a while \u03b3ij = (\u0393ii + \u0393jj)/2 denotes the relaxation rates of the coherences. For 85Rb, the spontaneous decay rates are \u039333 = 6 \u00d7 2\u03c0 MHz, \u039322 = \u039333, \u039344 = 0.35\u039333, \u039343 = 0.1\u039333, and \u039342 = 0.25\u039333. The matrix of the effective interaction Hamiltonian H\u0302 can be represented as\nH\u0302 Z 2 0 \u03a9p21 0 0 \u03a921 \u22122\u03941 0 \u03a9p42 0 0 2 \u03943 \u2212 \u03942 \u2212 \u03941( ) \u03a9p43 0 \u03a942 \u03a943 \u22122 \u03941 + \u03942( ) \u239b\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d \u239e\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 (2)\nwhere \u03a921, \u03a942 and \u03a943 are the Rabi frequency of pump1, pump2, and signal laser respectively. We can then deduce the steady-state optical coherence \u03c113 from Eqs 1, 2 as (Sun et al., 2004):\nFIGURE 3 (color online) Power gain G between FWM light and signal laser against the power of the signal laser.

(3)\nThe amplitude of the FWM light wave EFWM is proportional to the third-order optical polarization P(3)FWM (Parniak and Wasilewski, 2015):\nEFWM \u221dP 3( )FWM N\u03bcp31\u03c131 +H.c. (4)\nwhere N is the number density of atoms and \u03bcp31 is the transition dipole moment between states |1\u232a and |3\u232a. In our system, the third-order optical polarization can be represented as EFWM \u221dP(3)FWM \u03f50\u03c7(3)Ep1Ep2Es\u2032, where \u03c7(3) denotes the thirdorder susceptibility; \u03f50 is the vacuum permittivity; Ep1, Ep2 and Es are amplitudes of the pump1, pump2 and the signal electric fields, respectively. We can obtain the power conversion efficiency \u03b7\u221dE2FWM/E 2 s between signal light and FWM light by calculating \u03c7(3).\nConsidering the stimulated amplified process of signal light, we treat the state |3\u232a and the state |4\u232a equivalents as a simple twolevel atomic system for the signal field. The stimulated emission from the interaction between this two-level atomic system and signal field can enhance the input signal light with a gain factor of Gfactor = Isout/Is (Isout is the power of the amplified signal light), and Gfactor is satisfied by the following equation which is described in references (Riehle, 2004; Pan et al., 2018):\nIs Gfactor \u2212 1( ) + 2A lnGfactor 12B. (5) with A \u03c0\u03c92s Isat\u0394 2 3+\u0393243 \u0393243\nand B \u03b1N\u03c0\u03c92s h]L, where \u03c9s is the waist of signal light, ] is the frequency of the signal light at 1530nm, L is the length of the 85Rb vapor cell, Isat = \u03c0hc\u039343/(3\u03bb3) is the saturation intensity, and \u03b1 = 1/\u03c4cyc represents the pumping rate with \u03c4cyc 1\u03a943 + 1\u039343 + 1\u039331 being the atomic cycling time (Zhang et al., 2013). We obtain the power gain\nG \u03b7Gfactor (6)\nby considering that the stimulated FWM process consists of an amplification process and a frequency conversion process, where \u03b7 is a constant andGfactor is a function of Is.We then fit our experimental data with the deduced function and the result is shown in Figure 3A. The theoretical analysis agrees with our experimental results.\nFinally, for amplified detection of an infrared signal, we should also pay attention to the response rate in this conversion process. As illustrated in Figure 4, we replace the CW signal laser with a pulsed signal laser. Figures 4A\u2013D compare the signal pulse with the generated FWM pulse at a rising time of 1 \u03bcs, 500 ns, 100 ns and 60 ns, respectively. It can be concluded that the rising time of the input signal light and output FWM light are almost identical and the response time of this conversion process is faster than 60 ns. The study of higher response rate is mainly restricted by the shortest achievable rising time of the acoustic optical modulator (AOM) in our setup, which is 55 ns.\nFrontiers in Quantum Science and Technology frontiersin.org05"

We also investigate the dependence of power gain on the detunings of the three input lasers. Simultaneously, we experimentally confirm that the response rate of the FWM process is faster than 60 ns, therefore it can be applied to the detection of the weak infrared signals in specific situations."
