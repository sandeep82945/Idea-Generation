    "abstractText": "Background: Depression in pregnancy is prevalent, under-treated, and has serious impacts on the wellbeing of women and on child development. Internet programs can reach women who may not access traditional treatments due to distance, stigma or concern about taking medication. We adapted our online postnatal depression program, MumMoodBooster, for antenatal use. We aimed to trial feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the new Mum2BMoodBooster intervention with depressed pregnant women. Methods: Twenty-seven pregnant women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score > 11 used the program in a feasibility trial. Twenty-one had current diagnoses of major or minor depression on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Assessment of symptoms occurred at screening/baseline, post-test (8 weeks post-enrollment), and at follow-up (3 months postpartum) using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Results: In this feasibility trial, depression scores on both the PHQ-9 and the DASS-21, showed significant reductions representing large effects, with average symptom scores reduced by > 50%, and maintained in the \u2018minimal or no depression\u2019 range at 3 month follow-up. Anxiety scores also decreased significantly. Program usage was high with 74% of women visiting all six sessions. Program acceptability ratings were moderate to high. Conclusions: Findings paralleled the magnitude of symptom reductions seen in randomised trials of the postnatal MumMoodBooster program, suggesting that Mum2BMoodBooster is an effective treatment for depressed pregnant women. Effective internet therapies are likely to become increasingly important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make face-to-face access to health care problematic during \u2018lockdowns\u2019.",

Twenty-one had current diagnoses of major or minor depression on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Assessment of symptoms occurred at screening/baseline, post-test (8 weeks post-enrollment), and at follow-up (3 months postpartum) using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21).\nResults: In this feasibility trial, depression scores on both the PHQ-9 and the DASS-21, showed significant reductions representing large effects, with average symptom scores reduced by > 50%, and maintained in the \u2018minimal or no depression\u2019 range at 3 month follow-up. Anxiety scores also decreased significantly. Program usage was high with 74% of women visiting all six sessions. Program acceptability ratings were moderate to high.\nConclusions: Findings paralleled the magnitude of symptom reductions seen in randomised trials of the postnatal MumMoodBooster program, suggesting that Mum2BMoodBooster is an effective treatment for depressed pregnant women. Effective internet therapies are likely to become increasingly important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make face-to-face access to health care problematic during \u2018lockdowns\u2019.\nKeywords: Antenatal depression, Internet intervention, Web-based intervention, Feasibility trial, cognitivebehavioural therapy\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Depression during pregnancy (antenatal depression) is common [1]. A review of studies in 14 developed countries reported a pooled prevalence of 17% [2], which is broadly consistent with previous meta-analyses based on diagnostic criteria [3] and recent cross-sectional studies [4]. Antenatal depression is also a significant risk factor for postnatal depression [5].\n\u2020Alan W. Gemmill and Jessica Lee Oliva contributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence: alan.gemmill@austin.org.au\n1 Parent-Infant Research Institute, Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, Heidelberg Heights, VIC 3081, Australia Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nIn addition, children born to mothers who experienced antenatal depression are more likely to have behavioural and emotional problems. This includes an increased risk of anxiety and attention deficit/hyperactivity in childhood [6\u201310], and increased risk of depression [11] and anxiety disorders [12]. Negative effects, of sizes that are clinically important, have been found to endure at least to adolescence [11, 12].\nA range of treatment approaches are effective for perinatal depression. Systematic reviews by Dennis and Hodnett, and by Cuijpers and colleagues [13, 14] broadly confirm the efficacy of pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), counselling, and interpersonal psychotherapy [13, 14].\nDespite the availability of clinic-based treatments, fewer than 50% of depressed perinatal women are identified and even fewer seek help [15]. Internet-based interventions have potential to overcome many barriers to help-seeking by providing privacy, anonymity and ready access from home. Internet-based interventions for perinatal mental health difficulties (e.g., [16\u201318]) have been shown in meta-analyses to achieve mediumsized effects in reducing depressive symptoms [19, 20]. However, there are very few published studies that have examined internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions, specifically for diagnosed antenatal depression [21].\nWe previously developed a six-session online CBT program for women with postnatal depression, MumMoodBooster [22], based on Milgrom\u2019s Getting Ahead of Postnatal Depression program [23, 24]. The program, supported by weekly calls from a coach, was evaluated in a feasibility trial [25] and two randomised controlled trials (RCT) [16, 26].\nIn the first RCT, all women met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for major or minor depression at enrolment [16]. Following MumMoodBooster, 79% no longer met these criteria, compared to only 18% remission in the treatment as usual condition\u2014a fourfold improvement in remission from a DSM-diagnosed depressive disorder. The second RCT found a similar pattern, and demonstrated an efficacy at least as good as specialised face-to-face CBT treatment [26].\nGiven the efficacy of the postnatal MumMoodBooster program, we adapted the core components for antenatal women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the new Mum2BMoodBooster program in a feasibility trial. It was hypothesised that the program would be well accepted, show similar adherence to the postnatal program and demonstrate improved mood ratings over time similar to those seen in RCTs of MumMoodBooster."

            "text": "The postnatal MumMoodBooster program comprises six interactive sessions that are sequentially accessed weekly, designed to parallel face-to-face treatment [22]. The sessions utilize cognitive-behavioural therapy techniques to target depression and comorbid anxiety, including mood monitoring, relaxation training, behavioural activation, and strategies for managing cognitive distortions associated with depression and anxiety. Each session begins with a video introducing content. Sessions include text, animations, videos, tutorials, and case vignettes relevant to life in the postpartum period. Personalised content such as lists of pleasant activities and goals are created within the program. Self-monitoring tools, such as daily mood and activity tracking, are depicted in charts. Homework activities are to be completed between sessions. Users have access to library articles on topics including stress management, problem solving, parenting support etc., as well as a partner support website that mothers can invite their partner to access. Low intensity (< 30\u00a0 min) telephone coaching once a week encourages participants to use the program.\nThe content of the MumMoodBooster program was modified to be relevant for an antenatal population. Session welcome videos and several video vignettes were edited to remove postnatal-specific content and five new antenatal vignettes were recorded. Text was changed to be specifically relevant to antenatal women, and images of antenatal women replaced postnatal images. Library articles were edited, with new content developed relevant to depression, lifestyle and pregnancy. The voiceover for animations was replaced with antenatal scenarios. Content of many practice change activities and examples were changed to reflect the concerns of antenatal women. The partner support website was edited to be antenatal-focused. No changes were made to the core CBT components and the structure of the program itself. The low intensity telephone coaching component was retained as it was a strongly endorsed feature of the postnatal program. Rather than providing therapy per se, the support provided by the telephone coach is intended to encourage women to use the program, monitor progress, reinforce gains and answer questions [16, 25, 26]."

            "text": "depression has the potential to benefit not only women, but also their children. Emerging evidence suggests that treatment of maternal mental health difficulties in pregnancy may have some beneficial impacts on early infant developmental markers [34].\nThe results also showed statistically significant decreases in anxiety (but not stress) as measured by the DASS-21. This was despite the relatively low level of baseline anxiety in the study sample, which averaged in the \u201cnormal\u201d range (stress scores were in the \u201cmild\u201d range). Although RCTs of the postnatal program [16, 26] showed larger reductions in anxiety and stress than seen here, baseline levels of anxiety and stress were higher. Whilst anxiety levels in this study sample appeared mild, anxiety often accompanies perinatal depression, affecting 7.9% of antenatal women [35]. Wisner and colleagues [36] estimate that this represents almost two thirds of US women with depression.\nProgram usage was high with 74% of women visiting all six sessions and spending an average of 3.7\u00a0h in the program overall, across an average of 13.7 individual visits, only slightly lower than the postnatal version [25]. This slightly lower usage may not be entirely surprising\u2014all but two of the women in our sample were working, which is commonplace for antenatal women in Australia, at an estimated 73% [37]. Indeed, two of the more popular library articles were \u2018Managing Your Stress\u2019 and \u2018Managing Your Time\u2019 with 10 and 8 out of 27 women reading them, respectively. Previous research indicates that stress is a common complaint for time-poor Australian mothers [38].\nInterestingly, the most popular library articles were not only related to the mother\u2019s own self-care (particularly stress management) and support, but also to the couple relationship with 11/27 participants opening the articles \u2018You and Your Partner\u2019 and \u2018Communication Skills\u2019. A similar number (13/27) accessed the partner support website. Changes to their relationship with their partner might be an important concern for antenatal women [39]. By contrast, fewer articles about caring for the baby were opened. This suggests that many women were focused more on immediate help for themselves and their relationship.\nOverall, 87% of respondents at week 8 found the Mum2BMoodBooster program \u2018moderately helpful\u2019 and \u2018very helpful\u2019 with coach calls being the most endorsed feature, followed by strategies for reducing negative thinking and increasing positive thinking, pleasant activities, and mood tracking. This is in line with research demonstrating the importance of a coach in online therapies [40]. However, it also raises an important issue for implementing the intervention at scale. Although the coaching role could be delivered by professionals such\nas nurse practitioners, general practitioners and psychologists (a clinician portal has recently been added), even coaching of a low intensity nature will likely require greater resources than a purely self-guided program. It will therefore be important to balance these considerations in optimising future scale up. For example, women with more severe symptoms may benefit most from coaching support, while those with less severe symptoms may obtain a satisfactory treatment response with a selfguided format [41].\nThe components of the program with the lowest number of \u2018moderately helpful\u2019 or \u2018very helpful\u2019 ratings were the partner support website, library articles and videos, which are ancillary features to the core cognitive-behavioural content (negative and positive thinking, pleasant activities and mood tracking) in the program. These features could be further enhanced in future updates to the program.\nWomen who received coach calls for all six sessions took 6\u201315\u00a0 weeks to complete the program. Feedback from coaches when calls were not completed as scheduled included: women reporting a lack of time to complete the online session, forgetting about their scheduled call and/or double booking their availability.\nPossible limitations to interpretation of results include the nature of feasibility trials (no control group) and the heterogeneity of the sample. Although 21 women met the SCID-IV diagnostic criteria for major or minor depression, six women met criteria for other psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., substance dependency and abuse, manic episode). Thus, the program, which targets depression and anxiety, may have been insufficient for some participants. Moreover, with a feasibility study of this size, it is difficult to identify for whom the program may be most suitable. The design of future research studies might be configured explicitly to evaluate differences in outcomes for women with a current major depression diagnosis compared to those with other diagnoses with depressive features.\nStage of pregnancy also varied; at baseline women were between 6\u201335\u00a0weeks pregnant. Mood during pregnancy has been shown to differ across gestation with more negative affect being experienced in the first and third trimesters [42]. Also, as all participants in this feasibility trial received the treatment, there was no control group to compare the \u2018active\u2019 treatment to. At baseline, 44.5% of women were in their first or third trimesters. As low mood is commonly experienced during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, it is possible that some of these women might have experienced fluctuation of mood over time in the absence of any treatment [42]. Despite these limitations, there was good participant retention at 3\u00a0months and the depression results, and to some extent\nthe anxiety results, parallel those of the RCT of the postnatal MumMoodBooster program, which also had very little attrition at follow-up [16]. Future research might look at the possible differential effectiveness of the intervention relative to stage of pregnancy.\nWe aimed to collect a sample representative of the population likely to use this program; however, due to study exclusion criteria there was some homogeneity in sample demographic characteristics (the majority were partnered and in the same income bracket), and results of this small feasibility trial may not be wholly generalisable to the wider population from which participants were drawn."

            "text": "In conclusion, in a feasibility trial of depressed pregnant women, the Mum2BMoodBooster program was found to be promising as an online CBT therapy for the alleviation of low mood in pregnancy, including those with a major depressive disorder. Outcomes were similar to those reported with the postnatal version of the program in RCTs, including good acceptability and adherence [16, 25, 26]. Like the postnatal version, this therapy was delivered in conjunction with weekly (approximately 30\u00a0min) supportive telephone calls from a coach. Future research may include an RCT of this program compared to usual practice, designed to evaluate whether effectiveness varies with the severity of depression diagnosis, and might address when in pregnancy it is best to intervene.\nFinally, effective, accessible internet interventions for perinatal mental health difficulties are likely to be needed more than ever, Emerging evidence suggests that the advent of COVID-19 has led to a substantial increase in mental health difficulties among perinatal women [43]. At the same time, widespread mandatory restrictions on population movements have at times been enacted in an effort to curb the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that, in many jurisdictions, access to traditional face-to-face treatments may be curtailed or problematic and digital solutions to health care are increasingly relevant.\nAbbreviations CBT: Cognitive behavioural therapy; DASS-21: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales; DSM-IV: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV; EPDS: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; PHQ-9: Patient Heath Questionnaire; PTSD: Post-traumatic stress disorder; RCT : Randomised controlled trial; SCID-IV: Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank all the mothers who took part in this research project, as well as their coaches, who offered them weekly support through the program, in particular Alana Greco, Holly Andrewes, Leigh Elliot, and Eliza Hartley.
