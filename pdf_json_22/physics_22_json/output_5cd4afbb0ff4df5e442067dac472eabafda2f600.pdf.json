These devices can typically be controlled at higher temperatures, higher voltages, and higher power densities, making them extremely interesting for future electronic systems [1, 2].\nDue to its direct-wide band gap (3.4eV) and high thermal conductivity [3, 4], thermal stability, high melting point [5], high electron mobility [6], mechanical hardness, and high breakdown voltage [7], the material gallium nitride (GaN) has become more attractive in recent years. Due to these properties, thin lm has become one of the essential materials of industrial devices.\nGallium nitride (GaN) high thermal conductivity material that makes it ideal for use in different sensors applications [8\u201310] solar cells [11, 12], light-emitting diode devices [13, 14], short wavelength optical devices [15, 16], high-power transistors [17, 18], and beta-voltaic devices [19].\nSeveral studies have attempted to synthesize GaN nanostructures using various growth techniques, including metal-organic chemical vapor deposition[20], reactive molecular beam epitaxy [21], thermal ammonization [22, 23], physical vapor deposition [24, 25], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [26], sol-gel chemistry [27], electrochemical deposition [28], thermal vapor deposition [29], and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [30]. These methods have a common drawback in high temperatures and costly chemicals, leading to a relatively low production yield. Therefore, pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) [31] has recently improved the high quality of GaN lms. This technique has been commonly used in the past to prepare thin lms for high-quality multicomponent oxide ceramics. PLA is a perfect growth approach with many bene ts over other methods, such as being very easy to operate, having no toxic or costly precursors, and thin lm can be achieved at room temperatures [32, 33].\nIn this research involves synthesizing high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) nanoparticles (NPs) under six different ablation energies using the pulsed laser ablation method and deposited on the quartz substrates for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic devices and gas sensors.\nExperimental Detail\nPage 3/15\nIn the experimental part, Fig. 1(a), shows a GaN target immersed in 5ml ethanol and shot with a Nd: YAG pulsed laser. The laser being used has a wavelength of 532 nm and a pulse repetition rate of 4 Hz. For each owing energy one sample was prepared: 1000 mJ, 1200 mJ, 1400 mJ, 1600 mJ, 1800 mJ, and 2000 mJ. Each sample was irradiated with 500 pulses to saturate the nanomaterials liquid. The focal length varies after every 100 pulses to maintain the interaction between the laser energy and the GaN surface. The focal length at the start was 12 cm. Figure 1(b) depicts the liquid sample after laser ablation; the preparation conditions associated with this sedimentation process are listed in Table (1).\nTable\u00a0(1): PLA in liquids conditions.\nConditions Values of PLAL\nLaser wavelength 532nm\nNo. of pulses 500 shots\nPulse repetition rate 4 HZ\nEnergy 1000-2000 mJ\nDistance between sample & target 12cm\nSpot size 2mm\nPulse duration 10ns\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a02, the GaN liquid samples were deposited onto the quartz substrate using a drop-casting process. A hotplate heated the quartz layer at a range of temperatures from (70oC -90oC). When the appropriate temperature was reached, nano-liquid was slowly dropped on the quartz substrate; each drop on the quartz substrate was left to dry and then followed by another drop (100 drops) to form the thin lm GaN on the quartz substrate,the same process have been done for all the samples. The processes were performed in less than 12 hours to prevent oxidation during deposition. Before beginning the falling process with alcohol, the quartz substrate was thoroughly washed. Before each drop, the nano-liquid should be su ciently shaken to preserve the GaN nanomaterials.\nThe quartz/nanoparticles (GaN) sample was tested in the XRD test, TEM, AFM, FESEM, PL. All results are analyzed in the next section of results and discussions.\nResults And Discussions 3-1- Structural properties\nFigure\u00a03 presents the XRD GaN nanoparticles synthesized and drop-casted on quartz substrate at different ablation energies (1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2000mj). The diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern are matched with standard cubic and wurtzite hexagonal structures of the GaN crystal. The nanoparticles prepared for 1000mj exhibit h-GaN rise at 2\u03b8 = 34.64 re ected from (002) plane and c-GaN\nPage 4/15\npeak at 2\u03b8 = 40.22 re ected from (111) plane cubic phase has affected the peak intensity and the sharpness of the hexagonal phase. The sample of 1200mj displays h-GaN nanoparticles at 2\u03b8 = 34.64 and 37.98, which are re ected from (002) and (100) planes. The intensity and the sharpness of the peak begin to increase with increasing the ablation energy. The third sample of 1400mj shows two peaks of hGaN nanoparticles at 2\u03b8 = 34.64, and 37.98 re ected from (002) and (100) planes, the intensity of the peak increased due to increase the structure crystallization. The fourth sample of 1600mj displays h-GaN nanoparticles at 2\u03b8 = 34.64 and 37.98, which is re ected from (002) and (100) planes; this sample has the highest peak due to the excellent quality of h-GaN nanoparticles. The fth sample of 1800mj shows two peaks of h-GaN nanoparticles at 2\u03b8 = 34.64 and 37.98, which re ected from (002) and (100) planes, the peak intensity begins to decrease due to decreasing the structure crystallization, and the sixth sample of 2000 mJ shows two peaks of h-GaN nanoparticles at 2\u03b8 = 34.64 and 37.98 which re ected from (002) and (100) planes, the intensity of the peak is less than the fth sample. This indicates high intensity in response to the excellent quality of h-GaN nanoparticles synthesized in the fourth sample at low temperature.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the intensity of the peaks for the XRD pattern increased with increasing laser ablation energy due to increasing of the grain size and concentration of ablated material and due to enhancement of crystal quality until (1600 mJ) that has the highest intensity peak then the intensity peak back to decrease as the laser ablation increase.\n3-2- Morphological properties\n3-2-1 AFM results\nThis section includes a profound discussion of the results. Figure 4 presents AFM images of the GaN nanophotonic; the change in the root mean square and roughness and grain size of the GaN nanophotonic, with the difference in the pulsed laser ablation energy are shown in Table 1. The GaN nanoparticles prepared for 1000mj exhibit high root mean square (23.40nm) and roughness (3.750nm). The sample of 1200 mJ displays root mean square (16.00nm) and roughness of (4.533nm). The sample of 1400mj and 1600mj shows the highest roughness. The smallest root mean square due to the excellent quality of the structure crystallization and high regular crystals distribution, the roughness back to decrease, and the root mean square increase cause the reduction in the structure crystallization and regular crystals distribution 1800 mJ and 2000mJ [5].\nTable 1: AFM data of GaN/quartz nanostructures at different ablation energies.\nPage 5/15\nLaser ablation energy (mj) Roughness (nm) Root-mean-square value (nm) Grains (nm)"

            "text": "Figure\u00a05 represents the relation between the grains density and the grains size at different ablation energies. The GaN nanoparticles prepared for 1000mj exhibit a wide range of grain size (27. 29 nm \u2212 116.6nm) with grains density (0.002). The sample 1200 mJ display a range of grain size (12.57 nm103.7nm), the range of grain size decrease and the grains density increase. The samples of 1400 mJ and1600 mJ show the smallest range of grain size (4.361nm-58.88nm) and (9.183nm-69.44nm) and the highest grains density due to high regular crystals distribution, then the density of the grain back to decrease at 1800 mJ because of the decrease in the regularity of the distribution of the crystal and then back to increase at 2000 mJ due to regular crystals distribution [5].\n3-2-2 FESEM results\nFigure\u00a06 presents the FESEM images and the EDX spectrum of GaN nanoparticles for the six samples synthesized under different ablation energies. These samples were built using a drop cast on the quartz substrate. The EDX spectra of GaN nanoparticles have both elements Ga, and N. The [Ga]/N ratio depends on laser ablation energy. At 1000 mJ, FESEM image shows the beginning of the crystallization process, and the ratio of [Ga] / [N] was 5. The second sample at 1200 mJ exhibits an increase in the structure crystallization. The ratio of [Ga] / [N] was 3.77. The third sample of 1400 mJ shows improves crystallization than the second sample; the ratio of [Ga] / [N] was 3.633. The fourth sample at 1600 mJ shows a good crystallization quality, the ratio of [Ga] / [N] was 4.19. The fth sample at 1800 mJ exhibits several particles to be agglomerated; the ratio of [Ga] / [N] was 3. The sixth sample at 2000 mJ shows an increase in the number of agglomerated particles with increasing the laser ablation energy, the ratio of [Ga] / [N] was 3.45.\nMoreover, FESEM images showed that the crystallization of GaN nanoparticle increased with increasing laser ablation energy due to increased grain size, the concentration of ablated material becoming higher, and the enhancement of crystal quality until (1600 mJ), and this in good agreement with XRD result. Increasing the laser ablation energy above 1600 mJ will make the particles agglomerated, and the number of agglomerated particles will increase with increasing the laser ablation energy.\n3-2-3 TEM results\nPage 6/15\nTEM was performed to obtain a submicroscopic image of the nanoparticles of less than 100nm. Figure\u00a07a shows the 1000 mJ indicates that the GaN nanoparticles have quasi-spherical particles with grain size varies from 27.29nm to116.6nm. Figure\u00a07b at 1000 mJ, the sample exhibited a good crystallization quality with the lowest grain size ranging from 4.361nm to 58.88nm. Figure\u00a07c prepared for 1800 mJ shows grain size varies from 4.196nm to 88.51nm; the particles began to agglomerate with increasing the laser ablation energy. The TEM images support the FESEM images of GaN. The FESEM with EDX and TEM also validated the GaN nanoparticles' chemical purity earlier shown with the XRD data. Therefore, it can be inferred that ablation energy is crucial in the synthesis GaN nanoparticles.\n3-3- Optical properties\nFigure\u00a08 demonstrates the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the prepared GaN under different laser ablation energies. The energy of the incident photon (E = hv) as a function of the wavelength (\u03bb) was calculated using Eq.\u00a0(1)\nEg = 1240\n\u03bb\n1 The rst GaN nanoparticle prepared for 1000 mJ presents an energy gap of 3.38 eV at the wavelength 366nm. The second sample prepared for 1200mj exhibits an energy gap of 3.41 eV at the wavelength 363nm. The energy gap increases with increasing the ablation energy, and the wavelength will have a blue shift. The third sample prepared for 1400 mJ presents an energy gap of 3.83 eV at the wavelength 323 nm; this sample has the highest energy gap due to the small piratical size and the blue shift. The fourth sample prepared for 1600 mJ exhibits an energy gap of 3.71 eV at 334 nm. The energy gap began to decrease with increasing the ablation energy that will ablate large piratical size, and the wavelength will have redshift. The fth sample prepared for 1800 mJ exhibit an energy gap of 3.54 eV at the wavelength 350 nm; the wavelength will have a redshift, and the energy gap decrease. The sixth sample prepared for 2000mj present the smallest energy gap of 3.34 eV at the wavelength 371nm; the wavelength will have redshift, the photoluminescence (PL) investigation proved the AFM result.\nFurthermore, It can be seen that increasing the ablation energy will remove the larger particle size, and therefore, the wavelength will have a red shift, So decreasing the ablation energy will make a blue shift in the wavelength and increase the energy gap until 1400mj that has the highest peak of power then at 1200 and 1000 mJ the energy gap decrease and wavelength will have redshift due to the core-shell phenomenon.\nConclusion This paper presents the synthesis of gallium nitride (GaN) nanoparticles (NPs) under six different ablation energies using pulsed laser ablation method. GaN deposited on the quartz substrate analyzed using XRD, AFM, FESEM, TEM, and PL tests. XRD test indicates high intensity in response to the excellent\nPage 7/15\nquality of h-GaN nanoparticles synthesized in the fourth sample. The morphological properties (AFM, FESEM, and TEM) inferred that ablation energy is a critical factor in the synthesis GaN nanoparticles. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra proved that decreasing the ablation energy will make a blue shift in the wavelength and increase the energy gap until 1400 mJ, the highest peak of energy at 1400 mJ. The energy gap decrease and wavelength will have redshift due to the core-shell phenomenon.\nDeclarations Ethics approval and consent to participate\n(Not applicable)\nConsent for publication\u00a0\n(Not applicable)\nAvailability of data and materials\n(Not applicable)\nCompeting interests\u00a0\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist\nFunding\nNo fund has been received for this research study.\nAuthors' contributions\nMakram and Evan\u00a0conceived of the presented idea\nMakram and Ali supervised the nding of this work\nAll authors discussed the results and contributed equally to the nal manuscript.\nAli , Husam , Evan, and Forat conducted the experiments\nAll authors provided critical feedback and helped shape the research, analysis and manuscript.\nCon ict of interest\nThe authors have declared no con ict of interest.\nAcknowledgment\u00a0\nPage 8/15\nThe authors would like to thank the department of laser engineering and electro- optic /university of Technology for the logistic support this work.\nCorresponding author: Assoc.
