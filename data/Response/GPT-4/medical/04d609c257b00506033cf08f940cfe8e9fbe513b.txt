Comparative Effectiveness Studies Across Different Regions and Populations: Given the ACH program's success in both urban and rural settings, future studies could compare the effectiveness and patient outcomes of hospital-at-home models across different geographic and demographic contexts. This research could include international comparisons, as well as comparisons across various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds within the United States, to better understand how these factors influence the effectiveness of hospital-at-home care.

Long-term Patient Outcomes and Quality of Life: While the paper focuses on short-term outcomes like 30-day mortality and readmission rates, future research could investigate the long-term outcomes of patients who receive care through the ACH model. This could include tracking patient health outcomes, quality of life, and long-term mortality rates to assess the sustained impact of home-based care on patient health and well-being.

Cost-effectiveness Analysis of ACH vs. Traditional Hospital Care: A detailed cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the ACH model with traditional in-hospital care could provide valuable insights into the financial implications of widespread adoption of hospital-at-home programs. This research could analyze direct costs, including medical expenses, and indirect costs, such as patient time savings and reduced transportation costs, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic benefits and drawbacks of the ACH model.

Impact of ACH on Healthcare System Resources: Investigating the impact of the ACH program on healthcare system resources, including emergency department usage, inpatient bed occupancy, and staffing requirements, could offer insights into how hospital-at-home models can alleviate healthcare system pressures. This research could explore how the ACH model affects the availability of resources for other patients and overall healthcare system efficiency.

Patient and Caregiver Satisfaction and Engagement: Future studies could focus on the satisfaction and engagement levels of patients and their caregivers with the ACH model, including in-depth qualitative research on their experiences. This could help identify areas for improvement in the model and understand the psychological and emotional impacts of receiving high-acuity care at home. Additionally, research could explore the training and support needs of caregivers in the ACH model to ensure they are equipped to assist with care at home.
