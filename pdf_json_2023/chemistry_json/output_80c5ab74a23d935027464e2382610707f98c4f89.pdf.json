    "abstractText": "Background: Echinometra lucunter is a sea urchin commonly found on America\u2019s rocky shores. Its coelomic fluid contains molecules used for defense and biological processes, which may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, that currently have few drug options available. Methods: In this study, we incubated E. lucunter coelomic fluid (ELCF) and fractions obtained by solid phase extraction in SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells to evaluate their effect on cell viability caused by the oligomerized amyloid peptide 42 (A\u03b242o). Moreover, the A\u03b242o was quantified after the incubation with ELCF fractions in the presence or not of cells, to evaluate if samples could cause amyloid peptide disaggregation. Antioxidant activity was determined in ELCF fractions, and cells were evaluated to check the oxidative stress after incubation with samples. The most relevant fraction was analyzed by mass spectrometry for identification of molecules. Results: ELCF and certain fractions could prevent and treat the reduction of cell viability caused by A\u03b242o in SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells. We found that one fraction (El50) reduced the oligomerized A\u03b242 and the oxidative stress caused by the amyloid peptide through its antioxidant molecules, which in turn reduced cell death. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that El50 comprises small molecules containing flavonoid antioxidants, such as phenylpyridazine and dihydroquercetin, and two peptides. Conclusion: Our results suggest that sea urchin molecules may interact with A\u03b242o and oxidative stress, preventing or treating neurotoxicity, which may be useful in treating dementia.",

Both features cause neurotoxicity and neurological damage in the affected area, which spreads through the brain, over time. Moreover, A\u03b2 activates microglia to release pro-inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species [2]. A\u03b2 has been detected in other neurological diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s [3], vascular dementia [4], Lewy body dementia [5], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [6], and Down syndrome [7].\nMolecules that reduce neurotoxicity by impairing amyloid plate formation or inducing degradation of amyloid peptides are being searched from animal venoms. Octovespin is one example. It is a peptide from Polybia occidentalis wasp venom, that was able to reduce the aggregation of A\u03b2 in both in vitro and in vivo models [8]. Exenatide, developed for type 2 diabetes treatment, is now being evaluated for cell death induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), A\u03b2, and oxidative stress agents [9]. Peptides from the sea anemone Heteractis crispa increased N2A viability, after exposure to 6-OHDA [10], and neuroprotection was observed by peptides from Palythoa caribaeorum in zebrafishes [11].\nEchinometra lucunter is an abundant sea urchin living in America\u2019s intertidal rocky shore, which secretes several molecules for chemical defense and homeostasis [12, 13]. Our group has been studying secretion from E. lucunter spines and coelomic fluid and has described several biomolecules \u2013 small molecules, peptides, and proteins, important for the animal\u2019s homeostasis. A cathepsin B/X is related to spine regeneration, a peptide from coelomic fluid participates in the innate immune system and a small molecule has pro-inflammatory activity, helpful against predators [14\u201316]. Thus, this animal can be used as a source of molecules therapeutically relevant.\nIn this study, we show molecules from E. lucunter sea urchin coelomic fluid (ELCF) that reduced the neurotoxicity caused by A\u03b242 in SH-SY5Y neuron-like, in both preventive and treatment approaches."

The coelomic fluid was extracted by puncturing the peristomial membrane and added to acetic acid 0.05%, in a proportion 40:1 v:v. The fluid was kept in an ice bath\nuntil further processing. The coelomic fluid (ELCF) was then centrifuged at 1248 \u00d7 g for 5 min, at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was processed by solid phase extraction (SPE) using C18 cartridges (Strata\u00ae, 55 \u00b5m, 70 \u00c5, 5 g/20 mL, Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA).

The peptide was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to get a 1 mM solution, and then diluted in phosphate-saline buffer (PBS) 50 mM pH 7.2 to 100 \u00b5M. This solution (named A\u03b242o) was maintained at 4\u00b0C for 24 hours for oligomerization.

Similarly, the E. lucunter coelomic fluid fractions, which were generated after solid-phase extraction (Figure 1B), did not show any effect on cell viability. In fact, El 100 even increased cell viability.\nAfterward, ELCF was incubated in neuron-like cells to verify its ability to prevent or treat the reduction of cell viability, caused by the oligomerized amyloid peptide A\u03b242. A\u03b242o induced toxicity in neuron-like 48 h after incubation (Figure 2A, B, C, and D). ELCF, when was added for both 1 h and 6 h before the oA\u03b242, was able to prevent neurotoxicity (Figure 2A). In a treatment effect, the addition of ELCF for 3 or 24h after A\u03b242o incubation could reverse the toxic effect caused by the peptide (Figure 2B).\nBesides MTT, cell viability was quantified after trypan blue staining (additional file 3). The cell death caused by A\u03b242o was confirmed (66% viable cells), as well as the effect of ELCF in reverting cell death (79% viable cells, statistically the same as the control group, 84% viable cells). The additional file 3 also shows a representative photo of the three conditions (control, A\u03b242o, and A\u03b242o followed by the treatment with ELCF), where is possible to see that A\u03b242o caused a reduction in the number of cells, besides alteration in their morphology (cells not adhered, others adhered but without dendrites and with small cell body and nucleus with black spots). On the other hand, the treatment with ELCF reverted this altered morphology, and although the\nnumber of cells is smaller than the control group, the aspect is different from the A\u03b242o group.\nWhen we analyzed ELCF fractions, we could see interesting results in both prevention and treatment effects. All fractions prevented the reduction of cell viability caused by A\u03b242o, and El50, 75, and 100 significantly increased this viability (Figure 2C). Regarding treatment, only fraction El25 could not reverse the toxic effects caused by A\u03b242o, while other fractions reproduced the observed effects of the raw sample (Figure 2D)."

            "text": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis is the most acceptable to explain Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in which APP protein, present in neurons, is cleaved by secretases, generating amyloid peptides [2]. The A\u03b240 is the most abundant amyloid peptide (80 to 90%), but the A\u03b242 is the most toxic, due to its hydrophobic nature, which allows plaque formation and deposit into the neurons [18]. That is the reason we chose to study A\u03b242 instead of other amyloid peptides, and we could verify its neurotoxicity in our cell model, the SH-SY5Y cell line. This line has been widely used for neurodegenerative diseases after differentiation with agents, such as retinoic acid, that changes its morphology to be similar to primary neurons, with neuritic process, electrical excitability, and synaptophysin-positive synapses, characteristics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons [19]. Using this model, we demonstrated that E. lucunter coelomic fluid prevents an impaired reduction of cell viability induced by oligomeric amyloid peptide 42. Some fractions could reproduce such effects \u2013 fractions El 50, 75, and 100. Cell viability was estimated by MTT assay, which reflects the metabolic activity\nLayout and XML SciELO Publishing Schema: www.editoraletra1.com.br | letra1@editoraletra1.com.br\nof the cells and therefore is an indirect measure of cell death. Although is a widely used method to estimate cell viability, we could confirm our first results using trypan blue staining. Moreover, the percent of viable cells observed here after A\u03b242 incubation was compatible with the literature.\nAt physiologically relevant concentrations, monomeric A\u03b2 is not associated with cellular toxicity. However, soluble oligomers, which exhibit considerable heterogeneity in terms of size and structure, have been demonstrated to have significant neurotoxicity [20]. The oligomers induce synaptic dysfunction and neuron apoptosis, besides inducing oxidative stress and the release of inflammatory mediators, contributing to the amyloid-based neurodegenerative disease progression [21, 22].\nConsidering the description of animal venoms in reducing peptide amyloid and the presence of antioxidative molecules in sea urchins, we studied these two mechanisms, to understand how ELCF and fractions reduced the toxicity caused by A\u03b242o: amyloid peptide removal from the cells in its monomeric or aggregated form, and the reduction of oxidative stress. For that, we opted to work with fractions, instead of the raw fluid, to reduce the number of molecules and get an assertive response.\nFractions El 25 and 75 were not able to reduce the oligomerized A\u03b242 in both cellular mechanisms and by direct action on the peptide. Regarding fraction 25, only the oligomerized form of the peptide was found, which explains the lack of effect on either prevention or treatment approach on cell death.\nOn the other hand, fractions El 50 and 100 were effective in reducing oligomerized A\u03b242 levels in cell media, in both prevention and treatment approaches, as evidenced by ThT quantification, a reagent that binds only to oligomeric amyloid peptides. While oligomeric peptides were still detected in the preventive approach, the results were more pronounced in the treatment with E. lucunter fractions 0, 50, and 75, suggesting that the molecules act on the oligomeric peptides after their formation without affecting the aggregation process.\nOur findings confirmed that these three fractions were able to reduce the oligomers even in the absence of cells, indicating a direct action on the oligomer structure. Therefore, one mechanism of reduction of amyloid peptide toxicity by fractions El 50 and 100 is the disaggregation of oligomeric amyloid peptide, especially in a treatment approach, making it less toxic to neurons [23].\nUsing this same ThT assay, molecules isolated from venoms presented similar results. Camargo et al. [8] verified that a synthetic peptide optimized from wasp venom was able to prevent A\u03b2 aggregation, and consequently reduced the toxicity caused by the amyloid peptide, confirmed by animal\u2019s tests, in which memory impairment was reversed. Moreover, one study showed that polyphenols inhibited the oligomerization of amyloid peptides, as we showed here, with a mechanism of monomer stabilization or oligomer disaggregation [24]. Epigallocatechin gallate and myricetin are structures similar to the one found here (in El 50), with antiaggregating effects\non A\u03b2 peptide [25]. The venom from the scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch, containing peptides resistant to heat, increased neurogenesis and, in a Caenorhabditis elegans model that expresses A\u03b21-42, reduced A\u03b2 plaque deposition, in comparison to an untreated group [26].\nMost of the evidence suggests that the N-terminal and \u03b21 regions of A\u03b2 are crucial in disrupting the aggregation process and controlling the toxicity of stabilized oligomers. Changes in the recognition of the monomer/membrane are associated with alterations in the accessibility of the hydrophobic \u03b21-turn region and charged N-terminus, a probable site of inhibitory molecules, and this is one mechanism of disaggregation and reduction of toxicity by oligomers [27].\nThe exact mechanism of amyloid plaque removal or oligomerization reduction observed here needs to be further confirmed and studied, using other techniques than ThT, such as electronic microscopy or mass spectrometry focused on proteins [28, 29].\nAnother mechanism demonstrated here was the oxidative stress caused by A\u03b242 and its reversion by E. lucunter samples. We observed that the E. lucunter coelomic fluid and fractions El 25 and 50 have intense antioxidant propriety, evaluated by two assays. When these samples were incubated in neuron-like cells, they could increase the antioxidant power in SH-SY5Ytreated cell culture media, in both prevention and treatment approaches, indicating reactive oxygen species (ROS) removal.\nAntioxidants have already been described in sea urchins. The first report was from McClendon, in 1912, in which it was reported an antioxidant effect in the coelomic fluid from Arbacia punctulate [30]. A pigment from the Anthocidaris crassispina shell showed important antioxidant activity by the DPPH method [31]. Pigments derived from naphtoquinone, with high antioxidant activity, were isolated from Echinometra mathaei, a sea urchin species related to Echinometra lucunter, used in this work [32].\nEchinochromes were described in sea urchins, being the most abundant Echinochrome A, clinically used in cardiology and ophthalmology, without causing adverse effects [33]. Several free radicals scavenging mechanisms have been related to this molecule [34]\nSintsova et al. [10] showed similar results: peptides from Heteractis crispa sea anemone reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Neuro-2A cells, induced by 6\u2010OHDA, due to the ability of molecules to scavenge free radicals.\nAntioxidants are molecules that scavenge free radicals, able to restore mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial abnormalities, such as the generation and release of ROS, cause lipid and protein peroxidation, and DNA damage. Oxidative stress and consequent neuron apoptosis have been observed in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, closely related to A\u03b2 deposition [35, 36]. The release of inflammatory mediators caused by A\u03b2 also induces the production of ROS. Thus, the control of oxidative stress would impair the toxicity caused by A\u03b242, which we observed in this work.\nLayout and XML SciELO Publishing Schema: www.editoraletra1.com.br | letra1@editoraletra1.com.br\nTaxifolin, a molecule identified in El 50, belongs to the flavanonols class and possesses powerful antioxidant properties [37], which may be responsible for controlling the oxidative stress observed in this study.\nOther identified molecules could have important biological effects. Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, an aromatic carboxylic acid, has antimicrobial and antifungal activity, which could be important for the maintenance of coelomic fluid in sea urchins and has already been found in jellyfish [38]. Minaprine is a phenylpyridazine, used for the treatment of depression due to its action as a reversible inhibitor of MAO-A, serotonin, and dopamine uptake inhibitor. Moreover, it has been found that minaprine weakly inhibits acetylcholinesterase, being considered for Parkinson\u2019s Disease [39]."
