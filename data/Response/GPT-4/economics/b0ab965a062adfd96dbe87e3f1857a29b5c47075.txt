Localized WEF Nexus Assessments and Solutions: Conduct detailed case studies in specific African regions or countries to identify local WEF Nexus dynamics, challenges, and opportunities. This research could explore how localized solutions can contribute to improving the overall WEF Nexus performance, focusing on interventions that are tailored to the unique socio-economic, environmental, and cultural contexts of different regions.

Innovative Technologies for WEF Security: Investigate the potential of emerging and innovative technologies (such as solar-powered irrigation systems, precision agriculture, or advanced water purification techniques) to enhance the WEF security in Africa. This research could explore the feasibility, scalability, and impact of these technologies on improving access to water, energy, and food, with a focus on sustainability and affordability for local communities.

WEF Nexus and Climate Change Adaptation: Study the implications of climate change on the WEF Nexus in African countries and identify adaptive strategies that can enhance resilience. This could include research on climate-smart agricultural practices, water-saving technologies, renewable energy sources to support irrigation and food processing, and the development of early warning systems for climate-related risks to WEF security.

Policy and Governance Frameworks for Integrated WEF Management: Analyze existing policy and governance frameworks related to water, energy, and food in African countries, identifying gaps and barriers to integrated management. This research could propose new policy instruments, institutional arrangements, and governance mechanisms that facilitate a more coherent and coordinated approach to managing the WEF Nexus, including stakeholder engagement and public-private partnerships.

Socio-Economic Impacts of WEF Nexus Interventions: Assess the socio-economic impacts of interventions aimed at improving the WEF Nexus in African countries. This research could focus on the effects of these interventions on poverty reduction, employment generation, gender equality, and social equity. It would also examine how improvements in WEF security can contribute to broader development goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
