Exploring NRPS Impact on Other Chronic Diseases: Building on the findings that NRPS has a positive effect on health status among the elderly with COPD and asthma, future research could explore the impact of NRPS on other chronic diseases not covered in this study. Investigating diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how NRPS affects a broader range of health conditions.

Longitudinal Studies on NRPS Benefits Over Time: Conduct longitudinal studies to track changes in health status over time among NRPS recipients compared to non-recipients. This approach would allow for a more dynamic understanding of the effects of NRPS on health outcomes, including potential long-term benefits or drawbacks.

Effectiveness of NRPS in Urban vs. Rural Settings: Given that this study focused on rural elderly populations, future research could investigate the effectiveness of similar pension schemes in urban settings. Comparing the health impacts of pension schemes between urban and rural populations could uncover important disparities and inform targeted policy interventions.

Impact of NRPS on Healthcare Utilization and Costs: Investigate how receiving NRPS influences healthcare utilization patterns and healthcare costs among the elderly. This research could identify whether NRPS recipients are more likely to seek preventive care, adhere to treatment regimens, or experience reduced financial barriers to accessing healthcare services.

Role of NRPS in Improving Psychological Well-Being: Explore the impact of NRPS on psychological well-being and quality of life among the elderly. Considering the potential for NRPS to alleviate financial stress, future studies could examine whether this translates into improved mental health, increased life satisfaction, and reduced rates of depression and anxiety among recipients.
