INTRODUCTION\nEver since the Higgs boson was discovered at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), confirming at last the last remaining puzzle of the Standard Model (SM) [1], the observed mass of the Higgs boson combined with the mass of the top quark, mt, have caused concern because, as the theory stands, it violates stability of the electroweak vacuum [2]. In the SM there is a single Higgs h with effective potential characterized by two parameters only, the Higgs \u00f0mass\u00de2, \u03ba2 and its self-coupling \u03bb, V \u00bc \u03ba2h2 \u00fe \u03bbh4. The self-coupling \u03bb can become negative at larger scales, so the potential becomes unbounded from below, and there is no resulting stability. Theoretical considerations indicate that if the validity of the SM is extended to MPlanck, a second, deeper minimum is located near the Planck scale such that the electroweak vacuum is metastable, i.e., the transition lifetime of the electroweak vacuum to the deeper minimum is finite with lifetime \u223c10300 years [2].\nIf the electroweak vacuum is metastable then Higgs cannot play the role of inflaton [3]. Explanations involving a long lived-universe, where vacuum instability is not important, were proved to be faulty. Without vacuum stability, fluctuations in the Higgs field during inflation and in the hot early universe would have taken most of the universe into an anti\u2013de Sitter phase, yielding a massive collapse, and the expansion of the universe would never have occurred [4]. The result of this is that either the SM must be incorrect or flawed in some way [5], or at the very least, that new physics beyond the SM which alters the Higgs potential so that it enhances its stability must exist at higher energies. Thus extra degrees of freedom are needed for the SM to explain the inflation of the Universe [3,6\u20138]. Minimal extensions of the SM which stabilize the Higgs vacuum are the most common theories which attempt to solve the Higgs mass problem. The correlation between the Higgs mass and vacuum stability is highly dependent on bosonic interactions. For instance, a model [9] with two Higgs doublets and large soft Higgs mass terms, satisfying the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions, has a stable vacuum and decay branching ratios that are very close to the SM ones, and this only one example. The question remains if models with additional fermions, present in most beyond the SM scenarios, can survive stability constraints, and if so, what are the restrictions imposed on their masses and mixing (if any) with the SM particles. *ashley.n.arsenault@gmail.com \u2020kivanc.cingiloglu@concordia.ca \u2021mariana.frank@concordia.ca Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

(Note however that minimal supersymmetry has its own difficulties with accommodating a Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV.) Or one could study the effect of adding particles to the SM, coupled in the simplest way, and investigate the conditions on their masses and couplings as emerging from vacuum stability conditions, as a simple and elegant way to obtain information about new particles and interactions without assuming complicated frameworks. The latter is the approach we wish to follow in this article, and we investigate inclusion of one additional generation of vectorlike fermions, i.e., fermions whose left-handed and right-handed components transform the same way under SU\u00f03\u00dec\u00d7SU\u00f02\u00deL\u00d7U\u00f01\u00deY. Unlike sequential fourth-generation quarks, which are ruled out by the one-loop induced Higgs production and decay mechanisms (the gluon fusion production and diphoton decay of the Higgs) [10], indirect bounds on vectorlike quarks are much weaker. In particular, vectorlike fermions can acquire a large Dirac mass without introducing a large Yukawa coupling to the Higgs. Vectorlike fermions appear in the context of many models of New Physics [11]. In warped or universal extra dimensional models, vectorlike fermions appear as KK excitations of bulk fields [12], in Composite Higgs models, vectorlike quarks emerge as excited resonances of bound states that form SM particles [13,14], in little Higgs models, they are partners of the ordinary fermions within larger group representations and charged under the group [15], and in nonminimal supersymmetric extensions of the SM, they can increase the Higgs mass through loop corrections without adversely affecting electroweak precision [16]. Vectorlike colored particles are consistent with perturbative gauge coupling unification and are often invoked to explain discrepancies in the data, such as the tt\u0304H anomaly [17]. Vectorlike particles have been considered before in the context of stabilizing the vacuum of the SM in [18,19], in the context of baryogenesis [20], to account for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and discrepancies in the W boson mass [21], and to help explain the observed excess at 750 GeV [22,23]. However, only particular representations have been considered [24], and a complete interplay of all possible vectorlike quark representations and the SM does not exist at present. We redress this here, and analyze the restrictions on the masses and mixing angles for the all anomaly-free representations of vectorlike quarks, as well as the associated boson field which is added to the SM for vacuum stabilization. In addition, we test the effects and restrictions induced by the vectorlike fermions on the electroweak precision observables, S; T , and U.\nOur work is organized as follows. In Sec. II we outline briefly the vacuum stability problem in the SM, and in Sec. II B its resolution with an additional singlet scalar. In Sec. III we then introduce all anomaly-free vectorlike quark representations, their interaction Lagrangians, and derive their masses and mixing angles (assumed to be with the third generation quarks only). We then proceed to analyze the effects on vacuum stability of introducing singlet, doublet, and triplet representations, respectively. In Sec. IV we give the expressions and analyze the effects of the additional fields on the electroweak precision observables. We conclude in Sec. V, and leave the expressions for the relevant RGEs for the models studied to the Appendix.\nII. VACUUM STABILITY IN THE SM"

Introducing an additional boson\nIn this section, we consider the simplest remedy to the stability problem by extending the particle content of the SM by an extra (singlet, as it is simplest) scalar boson which interacts solely with the SM Higgs, and we examine the constraints placed on its mass and its mixing angle with the SM Higgs boson on experimental and theoretical grounds. We leave Higgs vacuum stability condition, the main motivations of this work, to be analyzed in detail in the last discussion in this section. We refer to this scenario as HSM. The addition of a boson provides a positive boost to the coupling parameter, counteracting the effect of the top\n036018-3\nquark and contributing toward repairing the Higgs vacuum stability [28].

(2.6). Figure 1 illustrates the running of the coupling parameters for a typical set of parameter values. Notice that in this model, the scalar couplings increase with increasing energy scales, compensating for the SM Higgs coupling, which becomes negative at around 1010 GeV. Therefore, the addition of an extra scalar boson to the SM rescues the theory from vacuum instability. Of course, we may investigate the mass and mixing angle of this singlet scalar with the Higgs boson by eliminating all parameter values that do not satisfy Higgs vacuum stability. For this we perform a scan over a broad parameter space and disallow all parameter values which do not satisfy the vacuum stability conditions outlined in Eq. (2.18). The resulting allowed parameter space is illustrated in Fig. 2. While the blue points represent restrictions from vacuum stability bounds only, the shaded red region represents the region excluded by constraints from Higgs production and couplings (as discussed below), which are dominant and are the only parameters limiting the parameter space, especially for lighter singlet masses, mS \u2264 700 GeV. Note that, while the mass region allowed for the additional boson for u \u00bc 1 TeV is quite restricted, for larger VEVs it is quite large, and increasing with the new boson VEV. However, in all cases, the mixing with the SM Higgs boson is required to be nonzero (\u03c6 \u2260 0), consistent with the observation of Higgs potential instability in the absence of the additional boson.\nThe additional scalar is subjected to constraints from particle physics and cosmology [30,31]. If the additional scalar is heavier than the Higgs boson at 125 GeV, in HSM the decay channel S \u2192 HH may exist, and act as an extra constraint for the mixing regime. The \u03c1 parameter and its deviation from unity play an important role in measuring the effects of new physics on the masses of electroweak gauge bosons. Corrections to the mass of W-boson originate from the Higgs mediated loops, which enhance gauge boson self-energies, and these are dependent on the masses and the mixing between the scalar fields [32]. In the case where the heavier of the two scalars is the mostly singlet S with mS \u2265 125 GeV, the mixing angle sin\u03c6 agrees with theoretical predictions up to 1\u03c3. Although the region for \u0394MW\n1 is less restricted compared to the other case (where mH \u00bc 125 GeV), this scenario is disfavored by collider bounds and Higgs data. If the lighter scalar corresponds to the SM Higgs boson with mH \u00bc 125 GeV, larger heavy singlet scalar masses impose smaller mixing angles between the two scalars in order to fit \u0394MW to 1\u03c3 level. The minimum scale for the mass of heavier scalar in this work is at least 500 GeV, which in return, corresponds to sin\u03c6 \u00bc 0.37 due only to the constraint on \u0394MW . The bounds on HSM are also constrained by electroweak precision observables (EWPO). The singlet scalar contributes to the gauge boson self-energy diagrams at loop level, generating a shift in the oblique parameters S, T, U [34]. Checking the results from EWPO fit [35] by taking into account only the deviation of the oblique parameters with respect to the SM [33], Fig. 3 shows that, for values of mS below 1 TeV, the restrictions from the bounds from Higgs signal strength are stronger than those from EWPO. For the case considered in this work, where mS \u2264 2 TeV, the parameter space corresponding to agreement between oblique parameters and the EWPO fit imposes an upper bound for sin\u03c6 < 0.4 around mS \u00bc 500 GeV. The effects arising from electroweak precision in HSM, at 1\u03c3 level [32] are consistent with our later considerations of S, T, U parameters in Sec. IV which indicate that, for mass of the singlet Higgs at 1 TeV, the mixing angle must be sin\u03c6 < 0.2 from the requirement of consistency of new physics with allowed deviations from the SM. These results are consistent with those in Fig. 2. An additional theoretical bound comes from perturbative unitary. Two body scattering of scalars at tree level and loop effects to the partial decay widths were derived for HSM in [36]. Near the decoupling region sin\u03c6 \u223c 0, unitarity alone puts a lower bound formS \u2265 1 TeV to one-loop level, whereas otherwisemS can be as large as 7 TeV. In addition,\n1Please note that in this work we assumed MW \u00bc 80.377 0.012 GeV [33] and did not take into account the new CDF measurement, awaiting further confirmation. Our results are thus more conservative.\n036018-5\na lower bound rising from unitarity can be computed at tree level according to the mixing relation\nm2S sin\u03c6 2 \u00fem2H cos\u03c62 \u2265\n4\u03c0 ffiffiffi 2 p\n3GF \u2243 700 GeV2 \u00f02:24\u00de\nBut in general, perturbative unitarity generates a more flexible parameter space compared to other constraints. The Higgs singlet also affects signal rates due to loop effects on the Higgs decay widths through the channels H \u2192 gg; \u03b3\u03b3 at leading order. Previous analyses used various benchmark to test behaviors for different tan \u03b2, defined as the ratio of the VEVs tan \u03b2 \u00bc uv, and mS scales [37]. The mixing between scalars ranges in the interval sin\u03c6 \u00bc \u00f00.31 \u2212 0.20\u00de, corresponding to mS \u00bc \u00f0200\u2013800 GeV\u00de. The parameter space generated from the additional Higgs production channel S \u2192 HH is in agreement with H \u2192 diboson decays for sin\u03c6 \u2264 0.22 in the mass range mS \u00bc \u00f0260\u2013770 GeV\u00de, corresponding to the minimum of BR\u00f0S \u2192 HH\u00de \u00bc 0.17. The mixing is further constrained with increasing mass values of the Higgs singlet, sin\u03c6 \u2264 0.16, for mS \u2264 1 TeV [38]. Apart from the SM Higgs quartic coupling \u03bbH, the couplings \u03bbS and \u03bbHS from Eq. (2.14) are inversely proportional to tan \u03b2, which yields \u03bbi > 1 at tan \u03b2 \u223c 1, mS \u2265 900 GeV. So, \u03bbS and \u03bbHS reach the nonperturbativity region for small tan \u03b2 values. Taking relatively larger VEV scales, the couplings are perturbative for tan \u03b2 \u00bc 5, 10,\n036018-6\nwhich correspond to the singlet VEV scales, u \u00bc 1, 2 TeV throughout our work. Figure 4 shows the electroweak corrections to the production gg \u2192 H while Fig. 5 shows the decay H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, indicating that the electroweak correction \u03b4EW becomes more consistent with the SM limit (blue line) as tan \u03b2 becomes larger. For tan \u03b2 \u00bc 10, u \u223c 2 TeV, \u03b4EW further tends to the SM scale, however, variations in sin\u03c6 become tan \u03b2 suppressed.\nFigure II B yields a strong constraint on the scalar mixing, because for electroweak deviations \u03b4EW to converge toward the SM limit, sin\u03c6 \u2264 j0.2j at TeV scale. Electroweak constraints are more relaxed from diphoton decay Fig. 5. Deviations from the SM are not too severe on sin\u03c6 when mS \u2265 800 GeV. Clearly, as tan \u03b2 becomes larger (and so does the singlet VEV u), the constraints obtained from H \u2192 diboson channels are satisfied for mS \u00bc O\u00f0TeV\u00de scale. On the other hand, the region with small tan \u03b2 in HSM is restricted from perturbativity and relatively larger \u03b4EW inconsistencies.\nThe production and decay channels of the singlet scalar are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. The processes gg \u2192 S and S \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 have no useful experimental bounds for extracting various constraints on HSM. However the corrections \u03b4EW are more dependent on the sign of sin\u03c6 than on tan \u03b2. Similarly, smaller \u03b2 values restrict the perturbativity of \u03bbS and \u03bbHS for mS \u2265 900 GeV. Cosmological constraints on models with additional scalars are interested particularly in cases where the additional singlet is a dark matter candidate. Among the Higgs related dark matter (DM) portal studies, only the scalar portal is renormalizable. However, when it comes to scalar portals, the coupling between different scalars can take values in a relatively large interval. In HSM, \u03bbHS sets various constraints on the freezing temperature Tf at which DM decouples from cosmic heat reservoir [39]. Although additional DM candidates such as singlet fermions can be added to any theory in order to decrease extremely divergent\n036018-7\ncharacteristic of \u03bbHS in RGE level, mixing constraints are still in agreement with other constraints; mS < 1 TeV (without extra fermionic DM), and 200 < mS < 300 GeV (with extra fermionic DM) as the Universe cools down T < Tf [40]. Furthermore, if the singlet VEV u < 400 GeV, tan \u03b2 < 2 in order to allow perturbativity of \u03bbHS; this is however outside the parameter region we considered. Electroweak vacuum stability is affected by the renormalization group equations for the coupling of \u03bbH to \u03bbHS in Eq. (2.20), hence the connection between coupling evolutions gives limited freedom to control the dependence of \u03bbHS on mS. The combined cosmological constraints were explored within the GAMBIT framework [41], and they concluded that for 1 < mS < 4 TeV the singlet scalar portal only can account for the relic abundance. A more recent work [42] treats the electroweak stability problem by analyzing the HSM potential and transition probability of VEVs through radiation dominated era by an transcendental function of temperature. In accordance with the results of this work [42],mS might have to extend to TeV scale to have a stable vacuum, though the exact lower value ofmS depends on the scale of \u03bbHS. Overall, our explored parameter space of SM with the additional scalar is consistent with Higgs data, electroweak constraints, and cosmological constraints. We showed that regions with singlet masses and VEVs around the TeV scale are much preferred. We now proceed to analyze the effects of introducing vectorlike quarks to the model and show that there, as we add more fermions, stability emerges be the most stringent constraint.\nIII.

Unlike SM-like (chiral) fermions which act as doublets under SU\u00f02\u00deL if left-handed and as singlets if right-handed, and spoil the agreement of loop-induced production and decays of the SM Higgs, vectorlike fermions have the same interactions regardless of chirality. They appear in many new physics models, such as models with extra dimensions, and many explanations put forward of deviations from SM physics include vectorlike fermions. Thus it is important that, when considering the addition of a vectorlike fermions to the SM, the presence of a new scalar boson is essential to ensure the stability of the Higgs potential, otherwise, as the fermions decrease the effective self coupling, the singular divergence of the Higgs quartic coupling would worsen compared to the one in the SM. As before we require the Higgs sector potential to be positive at asymptotically large values of the fields, up to Planck scale. The question we need to address is: what are the constraints on the masses of the vectorlike fermions, and mixing angles with ordinary fermions, such as to maintain vacuum stability. The new states interact with the Higgs bosons through Yukawa interactions. The allowed anomaly-free multiplet states for the vectorlike quarks, together with their nomenclature, are listed in Table I [11,24,43].

After spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Yukawa interactions generate mixing between the SM quarks and the vectorlike quarks at tree level. The singlet vectorlike quark and the triplet vectorlike quark exhibit similar mixing patterns, while the doublet vectorlike quarks have a different mixing pattern. To avoid conflicts with low energy experimental data (flavor changing neutral interactions), we limit the vectorlike quarks mixing with the third generation of SM quarks only. This is reasonable also because of the large mass gap between vectorlike fermions and the first two generations of quarks. The mixing patterns will be described below.

The Run 2 results from the LHC have improved previous limits from Run 1 by about\n500 GeV [46]. All measurements assume top and downtype vectorlike quarks to decay into one of the final states involving Z, W or Higgs bosons with 100% branching ratios. So far, lower limits around 800 GeV have been obtained. The most recent search at ATLAS obtains, with 95% C.L., lower limits on the T mass of 870 GeV (890 GeV) for the singlet model, 1.05 TeV (1.06 TeV) for the doublet model, and 1.16 TeV (1.17 TeV) for the pure Zt decay mode quark [47]. The current experimental lower bound on the mass of the down-type vectorlike quark which mixes only with the third generation quark is around 730 GeV from Run 2 of the LHC and around 900 GeV from Run 1. The current lower bound for a vectorlike quark which mixes with the light quarks is around 760 GeV from Run 1. In our analyses, we set a lower limit on all masses of 800 GeV, to allow for the consideration of the largest parameter space. We proceed with analyzing the representations in turn, showing the effects of the additional fermions on the RGEs, and the mass and mixing angles constraints on the fermions and additional boson for each.

            "text": "The evolution of the RGE\u2019s under different vectorlike fermion representations are illustrated in Fig. 8 for different values of the VEVs of the new scalar field (u \u00bc 1, 2, 4 TeV). In the case of u \u00bc 1 TeV, we have taken the mass of the scalar boson to be 0.8 TeV, because formS \u00bc 1 TeV, the Higgs sector couplings diverge, leading to singularities, whereas in the case of u \u00bc 2 TeV and u \u00bc 4 TeV, we chose mS \u00bc 1 TeV because the smaller mass of 0.8 TeV is not large enough to ensure a positive Higgs quartic coupling. As required, all of the Higgs sector couplings remain positive up to Planck scale. As expected, the fermion Yukawa couplings tend to decrease with increasing\n036018-10\nenergy, while the scalar bosonic couplings tend to increase. As we discussed previously, the addition of extra scalar bosons to the Standard Model helps maintain a positive Higgs self-coupling at larger energy scales, while the addition of extra fermions only aids in lowering it further. A common trend with respect to the models is that the Yukawa couplings are generally negatively affected by added loops at higher energy scales, while the Higgs sector couplings are generally affected positively (they tend to increase with increasing energy). The obvious exception here is the SM Higgs coupling, which strays dangerously close to zero at high energy scales, and even becomes negative for the additional singlet vectorlike fermion case. The models that augment the scalar boson by vectorlike representations vary significantly among each other in predictions for the various couplings with the scalar VEV u. Note in particular that for the first case, for the singlet vectorlike case, where u \u00bc 1, the Higgs couplings increase, and \u03bbH becomes negative at \u03bc \u223c 1011, rendering the theory unstable, while if the additional scalar VEV is increased to u \u00bc 2, or 4 TeV, the problem is ameliorated. The same problem recurs for the doublet and triplet models (not shown), but the theory is safe for u \u00bc 2 and 4 TeV. Differences in the running RGE\u2019s are more pronounced for \u03bbS, the new boson self-coupling, and negligible for the others. Note in particular, the difference between the values in Figs. 1 and 8. For the doublet and triplet vectorlike fermions, the RGE evolutions are similar, and the Higgs self-coupling remains positive at all energies. The additional scalar quartic coupling does not lie close to the origin\nas its interactions with fermions are small. There are some variations among models in the new scalar coupling, and the one describing the mixing with the SM Higgs. We have put less emphasis on the vacuum stability bound for the additional scalar, since its mass and VEVare unknown, and thus limiting concrete information from a detailed study of its vacuum stability bound. Imposing the same conditions on the positivity of the potential as in Eq. (2.18), we study the allowed masses and mixing angles corresponding to each vectorlike fermion representation. In Figs. 9 and 10 we perform a scan over random values of the relevant vectorlike quarks between 300 and 2200 GeV, and for the mixing angles sin \u03b2L (in the bottom sector) and sin \u03b8L (in the top sector) between -1 and 1. The allowed values of the scalar mass mS are plotted against the mixing angle in the scalar sector, sin\u03c6 for different values of the expectation values u (1, 2, and 4 TeV), providing an illustration of the possible quantitative properties of the scalar boson in this model. The results are given for all models. In Fig. 9 we plot the scans for singlet vectorlike T (top row), singlet vectorlike B (second row), \u00f0T; B\u00de doublet (third row), \u00f0X; T\u00de doublet (fourth row), \u00f0B; Y\u00de doublet (bottom row). And in Fig. 10 we consider the \u00f0X; T; B\u00de triplet (top row), and \u00f0T; B; Y\u00de triplet (bottom row), providing an illustration of the possible quantitative properties of the scalar boson in these models. We remark from Figs. 9 and 10 that just as in the SM extension containing only an extra scalar boson, considered in the previous section, mass mixing between the two scalar bosons is always required, and this mixing is significant,\n036018-11\nsin\u03c6 \u2265 0.2. Also, consistent with previous discussions, increasing the VEV u enlarges the parameter space, which is now quite restricted for u \u00bc 1 TeV. As expected, the addition of vectorlike fermions worsens the stability of the potential, but larger VEVs (mass scales) survive. The mixing in the singlet U1 model is the most effective counterterm addition, in fact pretty much ruling out the\nscenario where u \u00bc 1 TeV (unless the additional scalar is light, 600\u20131000 GeV), while the other representations provide much milder bounds for the same VEV. We now investigate the restrictions on the vectorlike fermion masses and mixing from requiring the stability of the Higgs potential. We concentrate first on the vectorlike T, which has the same charge as the top quark, and which,\n036018-12\nthrough mixing can affect changes in the Higgs potential, both in the fermion and in the scalar sector. In order to investigate this, we perform the same scan over random values of mS and MU between 300 and 2200 GeV, and for the mixing angles sin\u03c6 and sin \u03b8L between \u22121 and 1, and show the results in Fig. 11. The first row shows the results for the singlet T vectorlike quark, the second row shows the results for the doublet vectorlike \u00f0T; B\u00de, the third for the \u00f0X; T\u00de doublet, the fourth for the \u00f0X; T; B\u00de triplet and the last for the \u00f0T; B; Y\u00de triplet. Unlike the case of scalar mixing, here the mixing between the top quark and the vectorlike one is required to be small, in general, for most cases, in the region sin \u03b8L \u2208 \u00f0\u22120.2; 0.2\u00de (with some exceptions, where it can be larger, discussed below), and it can be zero. The allowed masses of the T quark are restricted for the scalar VEV u \u00bc 1 TeV, and increase with increasing VEVs, so that in the singlet T and doublet \u00f0X; T\u00de models cases, practically no T masses are allowed for u \u00bc 1 TeV, while masses up to 1400 GeV are allowed for u \u00bc 4 TeV. For the SM like doublet \u00f0T; B\u00de, for u \u00bc 1 TeV, mT \u2264 800 GeV, for u \u00bc 2 TeV, mT \u2264 1600 GeV, while for u \u00bc 4 TeV, mT spans the whole axis. Note that here, like in the scalar sector, there are marked differences between the scenarios. For the doublet \u00f0X; T\u00de, any mixing between the T and t quark is allowed. We expect this case to be somewhat similar to the singlet, however, the Yukawa coupling of the X quark lowers the Higgs coupling further, the parameter space continues to be severely constrained, and the mass is allowed in a narrow region near mT \u00bc 1 TeV for all values of the additional singlet. Here, as an exception to small mixing, the constraints on the mixing with the top are lifted. The case with triplets \u00f0X; T; B\u00de, affected by both the X and B vectorlike quarks, exhibits a\nbehavior independent of the singlet VEV. Masses again are favored to be near mT \u00bc 1 TeV (we rule out light masses, \u223c500 from direct searches) and the mixing is allowed to be small or large. The strong enhancements are for the cases where the t and T mix. The mixing is expected to be stronger than between B and b quarks, due to the differences between mass of the top and of the bottom (making the denominator in Eq. (3.8) smaller). It is interesting to note here the effect of the X vectorlike quark, which, while not mixing with SM quarks, is nevertheless important for the mass of the T vectorlike quark [seen clearly if we compare the singlet T model with the doublet \u00f0X; T\u00de, and the doublet \u00f0T; B\u00de model with the triplet \u00f0X; T; B\u00de]. The scans in Fig. 12 illustrate the allowed masses and mixing angles of the B vectorlike quark with the bottom quark for the SM augmented by the additional scalar. We show, in the top panel, the vectorlike singlet Bmodel, in the second panel, the vectorlike \u00f0T; B\u00de model, in the third panel, the vectorlike \u00f0B; Y\u00de model, in the fourth panel, in the vectorlike \u00f0X; T; B\u00de triplet, and in the bottom panel, the \u00f0T; B; Y\u00de triplet. We again perform the same scan over the mB andmS masses and mixing angles sin \u03b2L constrained by vacuum stability requirement, and plot the resulting mB against the mixing the b-sector sin \u03b2L. The effect of the B quark is markedly different from that of the T quark due to weaker constraints on its angle (the denominator in tan \u03b2L is larger than tan \u03b8L). For the B singlet model, the mixing and mass range are restricted, especially for u \u00bc 1 TeV, while for the \u00f0T; B\u00de model the mass restrictions are lifted, but the mixing limits still remain. For the \u00f0B; Y\u00de doublet and for the \u00f0T; B; Y\u00de triplet model, the situation is very similar to that of the T mass and mixing in these models: the mixing is\n036018-13\nrestricted everywhere except around 1000 GeV, and this result is independent on the scalar VEV. Finally, we investigate constraints on the vectorlike fermions with non-SM like hypercharge, X, with charge 5=3, and Y, with charge \u22124=3. As the additional vectorlike\nquarks X and Y do not mix with SM particle, a plot of mass against the mixing angle does not make sense, Instead, in Fig. 13, the allowed values of the scanned fermion massmX is plotted against mT , and mY is correlated with mB. Note that in the \u00f0X; T\u00de quark doublet, the X and T masses are\n036018-14\nstrongly correlated (as seen from the third row of Fig. 11) and the expected mX is required to be close to 1000 GeV regardless ofmT values. We see that, similarly, in the \u00f0B; Y\u00de doublet model, mY must have an allowed mass of approximately 1000 GeV, regardless of mB, or the VEV u, unless both mX and mY would be much lighter (100\u2013200 GeV) in\nagreement with our earlier results. This seems to severely constrain models with vectorlike quarks with exotic hypercharges. For completeness, all the relevant RGE for the Yukawa couplings, couplings between the bosons and coupling constants are included in the Appendix.\n036018-15"

We show the results for the oblique parameters for the vector-like quarks in the singlet representation in Fig. 15, in the doublet representation in Fig. 16, and in the triplet representation in Fig. 17. The S-parameter agrees with the experimental bounds for small mixing angles, and does not bring tighter constraints on the masses of vectorlike quarks. However, the T -parameter becomes negative for small mixing angles for the D1 and DX representations. This feature in return might exclude some regions of the parameter space once combined with the contributions from the SM\u00fe additional scalar, and imposes further conditions on the mass of singlet scalar. Apart from the vacuum stability constraints that connects the two sectors, this unique feature of electroweak precision accounts for the destructive interference between parameter spaces of scalars and vectorlike fermions. Similar studies have been carried out in the literature [51] to impose more restricted constraints on parameter spaces of additional scalars. Checking the Eq. (A21) for \u0394T, the logarithmic term suppress the linear term in the small mixing domain of D1. Similarly, for DX, the first term in Eq. (A23) is inversely proportional to vectorlike quark mass, which is rapidly suppressed by the second term, growing with opposite sign with respect to mass of vectorlike quark. Numerical values for \u0394T and \u0394S atmVLQ \u223c 1 TeV agree with the experimental limits in small mixing throughout all representations. However, it is shown from the mutual regions satisfying S; T-parameters and\nvacuum stability parameter spaces that, in general, vectorlike quark masses and mixings are inversely proportional to each other. Moreover, in the mixing interval sin \u03b8L;R > 0.3, although not shown here, \u0394T and \u0394S dangerously stray away from the experimental bounds, yielding more restrictions on mS, as seen in Fig. 14. Therefore, negative contributions to \u0394T and \u0394S are very likely to be compensated with relatively heavier scalars in various models."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "In this work, we presented a detailed analysis of the stability conditions on the Higgs potential under the presence of extra vectorlike fermions. Since these have the same couplings for left and right components, they do not affect the loop-induced decays of the SM Higgs boson, and indeed, can have arbitrary bare masses in the Lagrangian. We asked the question of whether they can have an effect on the Higgs sector, in particular, we concentrated on one of the outstanding problems in the SM, vacuum stability of the Higgs potential. While vectorlike fermions appear in many beyond the SM models, here we have taken a model-independent approach. We allowed mixing of the vectorlike fermions with the third generation chiral fermions only, and we considered all possible anomaly-free possibilities for the vectorlike representations, with the additional fermions allowed to be in singlet, doublet, or triplet representations. As all other fermions, their effect on the RGE\u2019s of the Higgs self-coupling constant is to lower it further,\n036018-19\nworsening the vacuum stability. An additional boson is introduced to alleviate this problem (representing an additional Higgs boson which would naturally appear in most new physics models). Its presence is essential, and by itself it remedies the stability problem. The allowed additional scalar mass varies with its assigned VEV, but for all scenarios the mixing with the SM Higgs is required to be nonzero. We analyze constraints on the parameter space coming from theory, experiment and cosmology, and accordingly, we require the singlet mass to be preferably in the O\u00f0TeV\u00de scale. Thus this work focuses on TeV scale with small mixing because once vectorlike quarks are introduced, stability becomes the most restrictive theoretical constraint. Even in bare HSM (without vectorlike quarks), stability is one of the most stringent ones. In addition, the singlet scalar VEVmust be in the TeV scale as well, as smaller VEVs spoil pertubativity and severely restrict the parameter space. Additional fermionic representations survive for scalar VEVs u \u00bc 1, 2 or 4 TeV, and the agreement improves with increasing the scalar VEVs, indicating that higher scale physics is more likely to improve the vacuum stability problem. For most models, u \u00bc 1 TeV is highly restricted, and likely ruled out, especially for toplike vector fermions, or in doublet models where this fermion is the only one mixing with the SM top. The situation worsens for the \u00f0X; T\u00de doublet model, where for all values of the VEV u, the massmT hovers around 1000 GeVand is independent of the mixing. For triplet representations, the parameter spaces for T \u2212 t mixing have similar characteristics in imposing a small vectorlike quark mass limit, regardless of the value for the singlet VEV. Compared to the doublet \u00f0T; B\u00de representation, large mixing angles are permitted, for a relatively wide allowed mass spectrum. Comparatively, the model \u00f0X; T; B\u00de is more sensitive to large vectorlike quark masses, and shrinks the mixing angles to a small range as mT becomes large, whereas the model \u00f0T; B; Y\u00de allows for more parameter space for masses and mixing angles space for various singlet VEVs. The differences in parameter spaces can be attributed to the fact that although the vectorlike quark X does not mix with the SM particles, its Yukawa term appears in the RGE for yT, which is unique to the \u00f0X; T; B\u00de model. Vacuum stability is improved if the bottomlike fermion is also present, and allowed to mix with the b quark. The mixing angles are in general small (an exception are extreme cases where the mass is extremely restricted and the mixing completely free). However the difference between models with toplike or bottomlike quarks offer a way to distinguish between them, complimentary to collider searches. Compared to T vectorlike quarks, constraints on the B-like fermion masses and mixing angles are much more\nrelaxed. For the \u00f0T; B\u00de doublet model, the restrictions affect mostly mT and are relaxed for mB (the mixing with the b quark is required to be small). While the mixing can be larger for the \u00f0B; Y\u00de and \u00f0T; B; Y\u00de models, and for mB \u00bc 1000 GeV, the mixing with the bottom quark is unrestricted. (On the other hand, the models (T, B, Y) and (B, Y) have almost identical parameter spaces for B mixings regardless of the singlet VEV. The mixings are constrained everywhere exceptmB \u00bc 1000 GeV. Although its possible, the model \u00f0T; B; Y\u00de is relatively less sufficient to impose mass values for mB around 1000 GeV for u \u00bc 1 TeV. And finally, B mixings become less relaxed as the mass of vectorlike quark gets larger for the models \u00f0T; B\u00de and \u00f0X; T; B\u00de.) The vectorlike quarks carrying nonSM hypercharge do not mix with quarks, and seem to be required to have masses of around 1000 GeV, irrespective of the model, other vectorlike fermion masses, or scalar VEV. Compared to vacuum stability restrictions, electroweak precision constraints are more relaxed. Although the Sparameter does not introduce strong restrictions on parameter space, the T -parameter evolves in negative direction in different models. Combined with scalar contributions to S and T -parameters, deviations from the experimental precision data might impose further restrictions on additional scalars and mixings with Higgs. In conclusion, models where T-quark is unaccompanied by a B-quark yield very restrictive constraints for the masses mT and mixing angles sin \u03b8L. As well, additional vectorlike fermions with hypercharge 5=3 or \u22124=3 are shown to restricted the additional fermions to masses close to 1 TeV, for the sampled range of the parameter space, which, in association with their exotic charges, renders them predictable, making it easy to confirm or rule out the existence of these fermions. Our considerations which constrain the masses and mixings of vectorlike fermions are complimented by analyses on the parameters of models with vectorlike quarks from electroweak fits to the parameters in these models."

The explicit expressions for the\u0394S and\u0394T parameters for the SHM, including the extra singlet scalar representation, but without the vectorlike quarks, are\n\u0394T \u00bc TSH \u2212 TSM \u00bc \u2212 3s2\u03d5\n16\u03c0c2w \u00f0\u00bdtS \u2212 \u00bdtH \u00de; \u00f0A18\u00de\nwhere\n\u00bdtS \u00bc \u00f0\u00f0m2S \u2212m2Z\u00de\u00f0m2S \u2212m2W\u00de\u00de\u22121 m4S ln\u00f0m2S\u00de \u2212 \u00f0m2S \u2212m2W\u00dem2Z ln\u00f0m2Z\u00de \u2212m2W ln\u00f0m2W\u00dec2w\u00f0m2S \u2212m2Z\u00de s2w\nand similarly for \u00bdtH function, with the replacement mS \u2192 mH.\n\u0394S \u00bc SSH \u2212 SSM \u00bc s2\u03d5 12\u03c0 2 ln mS mH \u00fe \u00bdsS \u2212 \u00bdsH\n\u00f0A19\u00de\nwhere\n\u00bdsS \u00bc m4Z\u00f09m2S \u00fem2Z\u00de \u00f0m2S \u2212m2Z\u00de3 ln m2S m2Z \u2212 m2Z\u00f04m2S \u00fe 6m2Z\u00de \u00f0m2S \u2212m2Z\u00de2\nand similarly for \u00bdsH function, with the replacement mS \u2192 mH.\n3.
