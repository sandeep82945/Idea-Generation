 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the background and results presented in the paper:

1. Develop algorithms to automate identification of O-linked glycans. The current GlyKAn AZ app focuses only on N-linked glycans. Expanding the capabilities to also characterize O-linked glycans would broaden the app's usefulness. This would require building databases of common O-linked glycan core structures and developing fragmentation pattern recognition algorithms specific to O-linked glycans.

2. Incorporate additional ion dissociation techniques like ETD and ECD. The current app relies on CID and HCD fragmentation which produce B- and Y-ions. Adding capabilities for other ion types like C- and Z-ions could provide more structural information and improve confidence in glycan identification.

3. Build in statistical analysis for automated glycan quantification. The app currently outputs peak intensity but does not provide relative quantification across samples. Adding statistical analysis tools could allow automated quantification of glycan species across multiple samples. 

4. Develop a cloud-based version of the app. The current desktop version requires users to download MATLAB. Creating a web interface or cloud-based version would improve accessibility and collaboration capabilities.

5. Expand the app for glycopeptide analysis. The current app releases and identifies intact glycans. Expanding the capabilities to also characterize and identify glycopeptides would allow users to obtain more information about glycosylation sites and occupancy. This would require significantly expanding the fragment ion databases.
