            "text": "Englerin A (EA) is a potent agonist of tetrameric transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) ion channels containing TRPC4 and TRPC5 subunits. TRPC proteins form cation channels that are activated by plasma membrane receptors. They convert extracellular signals such as angiotensin II into cellular responses, whereupon Na+ and Ca2+ influx and depolarization of the plasma membrane occur. Via depolarization, voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels can be activated, further increasing Ca2+ influx. We investigated the extent to which EA also affects the functions of CaV channels using the high-voltage-activated L-type Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 and the low-voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3. After expression of cDNAs in HEK293 cells, EA inhibited currents through all Ttype channels at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 7.5 to 10.3 \u00b5M. In zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal gland, angiotensin II-induced elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration leads to aldosterone release. We identified transcripts of low- and high-voltageactivated CaV channels and of TRPC1 and TRPC5 in the human zona glomerulosa cell line HAC15. While no EA-induced TRPC activity was measurable, Ca2+ channel blockers distinguished T- and L-type Ca2+ currents. EA blocked 60% of the CaV current in HAC15 cells and T- and L-type channels analyzed at -30 mV and 10 mV were inhibited with IC50 values of 2.3 and 2.6 \u00b5M, respectively. While the T-type blocker Z944 reduced basal and angiotensin II-induced 24-hour aldosterone release, EA was not effective. In summary, we show here that EA blocks CaV1.2 and T-type CaV channels at low-micromolar concentrations.\nat A SPE T Journals on January 11, 2024\nm olpharm .aspetjournals.org D ow nloaded from\n\u00a0 5"

            "text": "Englerin A (EA), a natural compound derived from the bark of the East African tree Phyllantus engleri, is a potent agonist of TRPC channels containing TRPC4 and TRPC5 subunits (Akbulut et al., 2015). Even sub-micromolar concentrations of EA have a cytotoxic effect on renal cancer cells and other tumor cell lines (Akbulut et al., 2015; Caropreso et al., 2016; Carson et al., 2015; Ludlow et al., 2017; Muraki et al., 2017; Ratnayake et al., 2009; Sourbier et al., 2013; Sulzmaier et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2013). Mice injected intraperitoneally with EA show a reduction in locomotor activity from which they fully recover. TRPC4 and TRPC5 single knockout mice are partially protected from this EAinduced adverse effect, and TRPC4/TRPC5 double knockout mice are fully protected (Cheung et al., 2018). Binding studies showed that EA at micromolar concentrations partially displaced the dihydropyridine-type voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channel blocker nitrendipine from high-affinity binding sites in microsomal membrane fractions of rat brain cortex and that potassium-induced Ca2+ influx in differentiated H9C2 cells was inhibited by 6 \u00b5M EA by up to 45% (Rodrigues et al., 2016). The differentiated H9C2 cells exhibit a cardiac phenotype, and an interaction between EA and L-type cardiac calcium channels, particularly CaV1.2, was assumed to occur. This assumption was supported by molecular modeling (Rodrigues et al., 2016) of EA into the KvAP- and KcsA-based models of the CaV1.2 pore domain (Tikhonov and Zhorov, 2009).\nTRPC cation channels are activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), e.g., in intestinal smooth muscle cells by muscarinic receptors (Tsvilovskyy et al., 2009), in pituitary neuroendocrine gonadotrophs by GnRH receptors (Beck et al., 2017). In these cells, they indirectly convert the extracellular signals acetylcholine and gonadotropin releasing hormone, respectively, into Ca2+ influx and plasma membrane depolarization, thereby eliciting specific cellular responses. Ca2+ influx is caused by the TRPC channels themselves, as they conduct\nat A SPE T Journals on January 11, 2024\nm olpharm .aspetjournals.org D ow nloaded from\n\u00a0 7\nCa2+ as well as Na+. At the same time, depolarization leads to the opening of CaV channels, resulting in additional Ca2+ entry into the cell.\nThe family of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels includes 10 members, which are divided into two subgroups, high-voltage-activated (HVA) channels and low-voltage-activated (LVA) or\nT-type channels. While the T-type channels consist only of the ion-conducting 1 pore\nsubunits, the HVA channels contain additional subunits (Catterall, 2000; Catterall, 2011; Hofmann et al., 2014). HVA Ca2+ channels are activated at membrane potentials of around - 40 mV, whereas T-type channels open at more negative membrane potentials (Carbone and Lux, 1987) and are involved in spiking and oscillatory activities that play a role in the release of hormones and neurotransmitters and trigger the pacemaking activity of cells as well as cellular growth, differentiation, and proliferation (Carbone et al., 2014).\nTo investigate the direct effect of EA on the activity of CaV channels, we recorded currents from the HVA CaV1.2 channel and the LVA CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 channels in the absence and presence of EA. At the same time, we studied the zona glomerulosa HAC15 cell line because in the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex, angiotensin II (Ang II) leads to aldosterone release via its receptor, the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), in which several ion channels are involved. Thus, inhibition of two-pore potassium (K2P) and G protein-coupled, inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels leads to depolarization, whereupon voltage-gated HVA and LVA Ca2+ channels open (Enyeart and Enyeart, 2021). Gain-of-function mutations in the gene of ClCN-2 channels can also trigger depolarization and increased aldosterone release, which is associated with increased blood pressure (Fernandes-Rosa et al., 2018; Scholl et al., 2018).

Figure 1A shows EA-mediated TRPC4/TRPC1 whole cell currents at -80 mV (inward) and +80 mV (outward) plotted versus time. The whole cell currents revealed a soup ladle-shaped current-voltage-relationship (IV; Figure 1A, right panel), the typical signature of heteromeric TRPC4/TRPC1 currents (Muraki et al., 2017;\nStrubing et al., 2001). Whereas 1 nM EA had no effect on TRPC4/TRPC1-expressing\nHEK293 cells, 3 nM EA already induced a detectable whole-cell current, which reached maximal amplitudes at about 1 \u03bcM EA. The dose-response relation revealed EC50 values for TRPC4/TRPC1 channel activation of 21.2 nM EA (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.8 to\n49.6 nM), calculated from the outward current amplitudes, and 24.5 nM EA (95% CI: 21.0 to 29.0 nM), calculated from the inward current amplitudes (Figure 1B).\nEnglerin A inhibits heterologously expressed CaV1.2 and T-type CaV channels\nWhile 30 nM EA was sufficient to induce a robust TRPC4/TRPC1 current, the same concentration had virtually no effect on the high-voltage-activated (HVA) dihydropyridinesensitive CaV current in HEK293 cells expressing the cDNAs of the cardiac ion-conducting CaV1.2 \u03b1 subunit and its auxiliary \u03b22 subunit (Figure 1C, E).

Non-induced cells revealed just a tiny voltage-gated Ca2+ current with maximum amplitude at about 0 mV (Figure 2D, blue trace), which might represent endogenously expressed voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in Flp-In TRex 293 cells. Englerin A at 6 \u00b5M reduced the CaV3.2 current in Flp-CaV3.2 cells by 26.0 \u00b1 11.4% (n=13), at 30 \u00b5M by 91.3 \u00b1 4.9% (n=8; Figure 2D, blue and red traces). The doseresponse relation revealed a half-maximal englerin A concentration for current inhibition (IC50) of 10.3 \u00b5M (95% CI: 6.7 to 14.9 \u00b5M; Figure 2E). Experiments on HEK293 cells stably expressing CaV3.2 (HEK-CaV3.2) revealed a similar IC50 of 8.0 \u00b5M (95% CI: 7.1 to 9.0 \u00b5M) englerin A (Figure 2F) and confirmed the results from tetracycline-inducible CaV3.2 expressing cells. Next, we tested whether englerin A also affects CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 currents in HEK293 cells stably expressing the respective T-type channel. Our experiments revealed half-maximal englerin A concentrations of 7.5 \u00b5M (95% CI: 5.9 to 10.8 \u00b5M) and 9.9 \u00b5M (95% CI: 8.7 to 11.3 \u00b5M) for CaV3.1 (Figure 2G) and CaV3.3 (Figure 2H). Thus, englerin A inhibits all LVA T-type CaV channels with a similar potency and does not discriminate between the subtypes. As pharmacological control, we used the non-specific T-type inhibitor Z944 (Tringham et al., 2012), which, at 1 \u00b5M, inhibited about 90% of the CaV current in the CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 expressing HEK293 cells (Figure S2A).\nExpression and pharmacological characterization of CaV channels in the aldosteroneproducing zona glomerulosa HAC15 cells\nBeside CaV3.2, HAC15 cells endogenously express transcripts of additional voltage-gated Ca2+ channel  subunits including the ion-conducting pores of CaV1.2, CaV1.3, CaV1.4,\nCaV2.2, CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 (Figure 3A, left). They also express transcripts of auxiliary\nCaV and 2 subunits, except of 2-4 (Figure 3A, right). Since englerin A is a potent\nactivator of TRPC4 and TRPC5 (Akbulut et al., 2015), we analyzed HAC15 cells for their\nat A SPE T Journals on January 11, 2024\nm olpharm .aspetjournals.org D ow nloaded from\n\u00a0 17\nTRPC expression. While TRPC1, TRPC5 and TRPC6 transcripts were detected by RT-PCR (Figure 3B), no englerin A-mediated current was observable in HAC15 cells (Figure 3C). However, whole-cell patch clamp experiments revealed prominent voltage-gated Ca2+ currents in HAC15 cells, with a maximal current amplitude at voltage steps to 0 mV (Figure 4A). To dissect the LVA T-type and HVA L-type CaV currents, CaV channel blockers were applied and the current amplitudes at -30 mV (LVA) and 10 mV (HVA) were analyzed (Figure 4B-I). 10 \u00b5M mibefradil (Ro 405967), which blocks HVA and LVA CaV channels (Lacinova et al., 1995; Viana et al., 1997), reduced the current amplitude by 75.2 \u00b1 8.3% and 70.2 \u00b1 9.3% at -30 mV and at 10 mV (n=8; Figure 4B, I). The T-type CaV channel blocker Z944 (Tringham et al., 2012) at 10 \u00b5M inhibited 74.5 \u00b1 7.4% and 38.5 \u00b1 8.9% of the CaV current at -30 mV and 10 mV (n= 8; Figure 4C, I), indicating, that the current in the presence of Z944 mainly represents HVA CaV currents (Figure 4C, red trace). This fraction of the current was further reduced by subsequent addition of the L-type blocker verapamil (Figure S4G). At 1 \u00b5M, Z944 inhibited 57.2 \u00b1 9.2% and 41.7 \u00b1 15.9% of the CaV current at -30 and 10 mV (n=9; Figure S2B). With an inhibition of 18.5 \u00b1 8.7% at -30 mV and 34.7 \u00b1 8.2% at 10 mV, Ethosuximide at 10 mM had only minor effects on the CaV current in HAC15 cells (n=7; Figure 4D, I). SKF 96365 at 10 \u00b5M reduced the CaV current by 52.6 \u00b1 9.0% at 10 mV and by 31.5 \u00b1 12.7% at -30 mV (n=9; Figure 4E, I). The L-type CaV channel blocker verapamil inhibited 58.5 \u00b1 14.4% of the CaV current at 10 mV and 33.3 \u00b1 16.4% at -30 mV (n=8; Figure 4F, I). The remaining currents (Figure 4F, red trace) were further blocked by addition of Z944 (Figure 4F, blue trace), resulting in a final reduction by 68.4 \u00b1 27.2% at -30 mV and by 79.6 \u00b1 12.5% at 10 mV (Figure 4F, I). Like CaV1.2 and CaV3 channels in HEK293 and Flp-In TRex 293 cells, englerin A inhibited endogenous voltage-gated Ca2+ currents in HAC15 cells. 6 \u00b5M englerin A blocked the CaV current by 63.6 \u00b1 8.9% at -30 mV and by 50.1 \u00b1 15.2% at 10 mV (n=8; Figure 4G-I).

Gain-of-function mutations in the genes of the\nion-conducting 1 pores of CaV1.3 and CaV3.2 lead to increased release of aldosterone in\nhumans, which is associated with altered extracellular potassium concentration and hypertension, among other effects (Azizan et al., 2013; Daniil et al., 2016; Fernandes-Rosa et al., 2014; Ortner et al., 2020; Reimer et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2015). Therefore, to further characterize the ability of englerin A to influence CaV currents, we examined the zona glomerulosa HAC15 cell line. These cells express transcripts of the ionconducting pores of CaV1.2, CaV1.3, and all three subtypes of LVA channels (CaV3.1,\nat A SPE T Journals on January 11, 2024\nm olpharm .aspetjournals.org D ow nloaded from\n\u00a0 20\nCaV3.2 and CaV3.3), among others (Figure 3A). In these cells, endogenously present CaV channels are also inhibited by a maximum of 60% at englerin A concentrations of 6 \u00b5M.\nDue to the expression of several potassium leak channels such as TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, the TWIK-related K+ channel 1 and GIRK, under non-stimulated conditions, the membrane potential of zona glomerulosa cells closely follows the potassium resting potential at about -80 mV (Seccia et al., 2018; Spat and Hunyady, 2004). An increase in extracellular K+ concentration or inhibition of K+ channels by Ang II via its receptor (AT1R) leads to depolarization of the cell membrane, opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, the main trigger for aldosterone biosynthesis (Bollag, 2014; Spat and Hunyady, 2004). Binding of Ang II to AT1R also leads to G\u03b1q-mediated signaling and IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. Aldosterone is not released exocytotically but as a steroid can freely permeate the plasma membrane, i.e., its increased synthesis leads to increased release.\nEnglerin A (6 or 12 \u00b5M) had no effect on the basal and Ang II-dependent release of aldosterone from HAC15 cells (Figure 5). In contrast, the T-type Ca2+ channel blocker Z944 (10 \u00b5M) reduced basal and Ang II-dependent 24-hour aldosterone release by almost 50%. Z944 selectively inhibits T-type channels with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 50 to 160 nM by binding in the pore region of inactivated CaV3 channels (Tringham et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2019). CaV3 channels are activated at low membrane potentials - even below the resting potential - and hyperpolarization is often required for de-inactivation. In contrast, nothing is yet known about the mechanisms by which englerin A inhibits LVA CaV (and CaV1.2) currents. Three amino acid residues in the lower gate of TRPC5 have been suggested as binding site for englerin A (Jeong et al., 2019), and binding studies showed that EA partially displaced the dihydropyridine-type CaV blocker nitrendipine from high-affinity binding sites (Rodrigues et al., 2016). That englerin A does not inhibit aldosterone release from HAC15 cells may be due to the fact, that it is not stable in the 24-hour aldosterone\nat A SPE T Journals on January 11, 2024\nm olpharm .aspetjournals.org D ow nloaded from\n\u00a0 21\nrelease assay we employed and is converted to inactive products. Englerin A has been shown to be stable for at least 4.5 hours in canine and human plasma, but less time in rat and mouse plasma (Carson et al., 2015). The low stability of EA in rodent serum may account for the fact that the adverse effects that occurred in englerin A-treated mice were transient (Cheung et al., 2018). However, englerin A, even at 12 \u00b5M, did not affect 4-hour aldosterone release either, and our control experiments revealed, that englerin A, prepared in external saline at a concentration of 12 \u00b5M and kept 24 hours at room temperature, did still inhibit more than 80% of the CaV current in CaV3.2 expressing cells (Figure S2C).\nIn summary, our results show that englerin A, which potently activates TRPC4- and TRPC5-containing TRPC channels at sub-micromolar concentrations, blocks the voltagegated CaV1.2 and the T-type CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 channels at low-micromolar concentrations.\nat A SPE T Journals on January 11, 2024\nm olpharm .aspetjournals.org D ow nloaded from\n\u00a0 22"
