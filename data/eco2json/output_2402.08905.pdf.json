    "abstractText": "Based on interactions between individuals and others and references to social norms, this study reveals the impact of heterogeneity in time preference on wealth distribution and inequality. We present a novel approach that connects the interactions between microeconomic agents that generate heterogeneity to the dynamic equations for capital and consumption in macroeconomic models. Using this approach, we estimate the impact of changes in the discount rate due to microeconomic interactions on capital, consumption and utility and the degree of inequality. The results show that intercomparisons with others regarding consumption significantly affect capital, i.e. wealth inequality. Furthermore, the impact on utility is never small and social norms can reduce this impact. Our supporting evidence shows that the quantitative results of inequality calculations correspond to survey data from cohort and cross-cultural studies. This study\u2019s micro\u2013macro connection approach can be deployed to connect microeconomic interactions, such as exchange, interest and debt, redistribution, mutual aid and time preference, to dynamic macroeconomic models.",

Our supporting evidence shows that the quantitative results of inequality calculations correspond to survey data from cohort and cross-cultural studies.\nThis study\u2019s micro\u2013macro connection approach can be deployed to connect microeconomic interactions, such as exchange, interest and debt, redistribution, mutual\naid and time preference, to dynamic macroeconomic models.\nKeywords: time preference; wealth; utility; inequality; microeconomic interaction;\ndynamic macroeconomics"

            "text": "Wealth inequality has become a significant social problem worldwide. According to the\nWorld Inequality Report 2022 (Chancel et al., 2022), the top 1% of the wealthiest people account for 38% of the world\u2019s wealth, while the World Economic Forum (2017)\nfound that only eight men have the same wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion people. The global Gini index has reached 0.7 (Chancel et al., 2022), well above the warning level\nof 0.4 for social unrest (United Nations Human Settlements Programme). Solving inequality is important because social unrest generates a vicious cycle that reduces\nproductivity, increases inequality and fuels social unrest (Sedik & Xu, 2020).\nAccording to the macroeconomics review literature on heterogeneity (Heathcote et al.,\n2009), efforts to focus on microeconomic heterogeneity in macroeconomics have three main directions: individual endogenous heterogeneity and exogenous shocks, individual\ninsurance against exogenous risks and the interaction between idiosyncratic risks and aggregate dynamics. Concerning sources of heterogeneity, efforts have been made\nregarding endogenous capabilities and preferences as initial conditions for individuals and transitory and persistent shocks as exogenous conditions.\nThe importance of heterogeneity in individuals\u2019 time preferences for wealth inequality is well known (Frederick et al., 2002). Individual wealth accumulation and consumption\nare strongly influenced by how future values are discounted and heterogeneity in time preferences leads to wealth inequality. Considerable research has investigated the\nrelationship between time preference and inequality. The representative literature includes a model in which heterogeneity in discount rates leads to wealth concentration\n(Becker, 1980), an empirical study of the relationship between heterogeneity in time preference and inequality (Lawrance, 1991) and a model to explain inequality from the\ndistribution of discount rates (Krusell & Smith, 1998). Additional studies include a model to estimate heterogeneity in time preferences from the distribution of inequality\n(Hendricks, 2007), a model to account for inequality by adding consumer choice and human capital formation to heterogeneity in time preferences (Suen, 2014) and an\nempirical study of the relationship between differences in saving behaviour and inequality based on the distribution of time preferences (Epper et al., 2020).\nTwo main approaches exist to studying utility functions, including time preference: the constant and endogenous discount rates (Shi & Epstein, 1993). The constant rate is a\nmodel that expresses instantaneous utility as consumption versus reference stock under a constant discount rate (Ryder & Heal, 1973; Carroll et al., 1997; Strulik, 2008). In\ncontrast, the endogenous discount rate adds the effect of endogenous habit formation to the discount rate for instantaneous utility (Uzawa, 1968; Epstein, 1987; Obstfeld, 1990;\nChang et al., 2011; Zhang, 2012). In dealing with heterogeneity in time preference, the model that deals with endogenous changes in discount rates is more suitable than the\nmodel that deals with constant discount rates.\nReviewing the literature on the measurement of time preference (Frederick et al., 2002;\nCohen et al., 2020) indicates three main measurement models: the exponential, hyperbolic and quasi-hyperbolic forms. The classical exponential form is a function\nwith the discount rate as the base and time as the exponent (Samuelson, 1937). The hyperbolic form is a function with the linear function of the term multiplied by the\ndiscount rate and time as the base and the inverse of the discount rate as the exponent (Prelec & Loewenstein, 1991). The quasi-hyperbolic form is a function of the\nexponential form multiplied by the present bias factor (Laibson, 1997). Wang et al. (2016) measured time preference in 53 countries based on quasi-hyperbolic forms,\nwhich Rieger et al. (2021) combined with the sociological and social psychology survey literature to obtain universal time preference in 117 countries.\nPrevious studies on time preference have identified the introduction of various heterogeneities (Sedik & Xu, 2020), reflecting the interaction of multiple psychological\nmotivations (Frederick et al., 2002) and considering psychological factors such as trust, confusion and context (Cohen et al., 2020), as future challenges. Concerning these\nissues, social psychology has traditionally studied the close relationship between self and others (Markus & Wurf, 1987), while cognitive science has investigated the social\nbrain hypothesis that social groups influence the human brain (Dunbar, 2003). The comparative institutional analysis of microeconomics posits that shared expectations\nconstrain individual strategies and behaviours as a summary expression of the group\u2019s equilibrium state (Aoki, 2001). Additionally, the theory of social norms related to public\neconomics states that social norms, including customs, manners and rules, broadly\noriginate from mutual expectations and approval with others based on sympathetic human tendencies (Heath, 2008). Therefore, it is essential to consider interactions with\nothers and social groups as psychological motivations and factors related to time preferences; however, while conventional economic studies on time preference have\nexamined the effects on individuals\u2019 endogenous habit formation and preference changes for exogenous shocks, no studies focus on others\u2019 interactions and social\ncontext.\nThe agent-based model (ABM) is an approach that introduces microeconomic\ninteractions into the macroeconomy. The related literature (Haldane & Turrell, 2018) states that macroeconomic ABM attempts to understand macro-level behaviour by\nhaving rule-based interactions among agents (Turrell, 2016). Representative studies show phase transitions between low and high-unemployment economies by setting firm\nproduction and price rules (Gualdi et al., 2015). Additional studies have shown that policy indicators such as gross domestic product, growth and unemployment rates by\nmodelling the behaviour of government, bank, firm and household agents (Caiani et al., 2016) and that business cycles are due to the interaction of agents\u2019 decision-making\nwith cognitive restrictions (De Grauwe, 2010). Note that agents\u2019 behaviour in macroeconomic ABM is rule-based and autonomous dynamic behaviour is discarded.\nEconophysics is an approach that uses ABM and focuses specifically on wealth distribution and inequality. The literature in this realm (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007;\nChakrabarti AS & BK, 2010) shows that asset exchanges among many agents are modelled based on physical analogies to simulate various wealth distributions.\nRepresentative studies have shown that the gamma distribution is caused by the stochastic process of the exchange of assets other than savings (Angle, 1986) and that\nthe delta distribution uses the analogy of the kinetic energy exchange of gas particles (Chakraborti, 2002). Further research has shown that changes in tax rates and insurance\ncan cause exponential and gamma distributions to interchange (Guala, 2009; Chakrabarti AS & BK, 2010). No macroeconomic models are incorporated into these\neconophysical agents.\nThis study aims to simulate the distribution and inequality of wealth and utility by\nsetting up a new dynamic model concerning both econophysics and macroeconomic\nABM. We also investigate the heterogeneity of time preference, i.e. discount rate, based on the interaction between individuals and others and the social context and norms.\nEconophysics has a physical analogy-based agent that differs from reality and the macroeconomic ABM has a behavioural rule-based agent. In contrast, this study takes\nthe approach of connecting microeconomic interactions with dynamic macroeconomic agents to incorporate the dynamic behaviour of autonomous agents. Unlike previous\nstudies that calculate wealth inequality from the distribution of pre-given time preferences (Suen, 2014), examine the relationship between measured time preference\ndistributions and inequality (Epper et al., 2020) or change time preferences through endogenous habit formation (Zhang, 2012), this study takes a unique approach. We\nexamine the distribution and inequality of wealth and utility generated by the distribution of time preferences generated from initial uniform time preferences through\ninteractions with others and social norms. Our approach is limited in that it assumes an impact on time preference by its interactions and social norms, but as with Zhang\u2019s\nhabit formation, the actual survey researches suport the findings obtained.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The Methods section first refers to\nthe Ramsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans model (Ramsey, 1928; Cass, 1965; Koopmans, 1965), one of the basic models of dynamic macroeconomics. On this basis, we show how to\ncalculate the dynamic saddle path and the utility for discount rate changes concerning capital and individual agents\u2019 consumption. Following an econophysical approach, we\nthen formulate changes in the discount rates based on intercomparisons of capital or consumption among agents and references to social norms. Through repeated\ninteractions and references, the Results section simulates changes in the distribution of discount rates from initial uniform values and corresponding changes in the distribution\nof wealth and utility. This section also presents the calculation results of coefficients of variation and Gini indices that represent inequality among agents. The Discussion\nsection considers the impact of intercomparisons and social norms on inequality, along with the interpretation of the results and mentions the potential of developing an\napproach that connects microeconomic interactions other than time preference, such as exchange, debt, redistribution and mutual aid, to dynamic macroeconomics. Finally, the\nConclusion section presents the main inferences and addresses future issues."

Suppose capital per individual (household) is \ud835\udc58 , consumption is \ud835\udc50, the production function is \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc58), the capital depletion rate is \ud835\udeff, the labour growth rate is \ud835\udf06, the knowledge growth rate is \ud835\udf05, the discount rate of time preference is \ud835\udf0c and the relative risk aversion coefficient is \ud835\udf03.

In econophysics (Chatterjee &\nChakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti, AS & BK, 2010), two agents are randomly selected from a large number of agents, the exchange of assets between them is modelled and the\nrepeated selection of two agents is used to simulate various wealth distributions. Thus, we model the change in time preference due to the interaction between agents \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc57. Let the discount rates of both agents at time \ud835\udc61 be \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61); both change to \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) due to their interaction in equations (20) and (21), respectively.\n\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\n+ \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 \u2212 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\n\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) ).\n(20)\n\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61)\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61)\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61)\n+ \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 \u2212 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61)\n\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) ).\n(21)\nThe second and third terms in the brackets on the right-hand side of equations (20) and (21) represent the interaction based on the intercomparison of capital \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) and consumption \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) (t), respectively, because the time preference is considered to be influenced by both capital (future consumption) and current consumption (Romer, 2019: 370\u2013371). \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc58 \u2265 1 and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc50 \u2265 1 are parameters that represent the so-called \u2018the grass is greener on the other side\u2019 psychological bias. The existence of this psychological bias is well known in neuroscience (Boorman et al.,\n2009; Noritake et al., 2018); however, its effects on capital and consumption remain unexamined; therefore, we formulate them here as in equations (20) and (21). Here, 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 \u2264 1 are the parameters for the strength of the interaction. Equation (20) explains that if \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) > \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) when others\u2019 capital appears larger, the discount rate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) becomes smaller than \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) (reducing consumption). Furthermore, if \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) > \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) when others\u2019 consumption appears larger, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) becomes larger than \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) (increasing consumption).\nThe fourth term represents the reference to the social normative discount rate, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 , where 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c \u2264 1 is a parameter indicating the strength of the reference. Social norms include secular morality, Buddhist teachings and Islamic law. If \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 1 , then \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 . Equation (20) explains that if\n\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) > \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 when the current discount rate is larger than the normative discount rate, then \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) becomes smaller than \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) (reducing consumption). In other words, the normative discount rate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 works in a suppressive manner; however, if \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 is large (when the whole society is ephemeral), \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) will become larger (increasing consumption).\nFigure 1 shows the computational flow for time preference interaction. First, in Step I, the number of agents (\ud835\udc41), the time increment (\u2206\ud835\udc61) of the computation, the period (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5d) for the interaction and the maximum time (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) for the computation are set as initial settings. Furthermore, the initial discount rate (\ud835\udf0c0), the initial utility (\ud835\udc480), the exponent (\ud835\udefc) of the production function, the capital depletion rate (\ud835\udeff) and the coefficient of relative risk aversion (\ud835\udf03) are set as initial settings for all agents. Although not shown in Figure 1, parameters \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc58 , \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 , \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c in equations (20) and (21) are also set together. In Step II, we use the initial values and equations (5) and (6) and calculate the capital (\ud835\udc580 \u2217) and consumption (\ud835\udc500 \u2217) for all agents at time \ud835\udc61 = 0. In Step III, we advance time \ud835\udc61 to \ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udee5\ud835\udc61. In Step IV, we calculate the surplus \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5d\u2044 ) of time \ud835\udc61 and divided by \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5d. If it is 0, we return to Step V; if the value is not 0, we proceed to Step IX.\nIn Step V, we randomly select two agents \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc56 \u2260 \ud835\udc57, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 = 1, 2, \u22ef , \ud835\udc41) among \ud835\udc41\nagents. In Step VI, using equations (20) and (21), we change the discount rates \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) of agents \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc57 to \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61), respectively. In Step VII, using equations (11) and (12), we change the capital \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) and consumption \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) for agent \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) for \ud835\udc57 to \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) , \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61), respectively. In Step VIII, using equations (15) and (16), we\nset the adjustment paths \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3d \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) toward the new\nsaddle points \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) , which are calculated using equations (9) and (10). After that, as time \ud835\udc61 advances, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) proceed along the adjustment path.\nIn Step IX, which follows from Step IV or VIII, we calculate the increment of utility \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56 corresponding to time increment \u2206\ud835\udc61 for each agent \ud835\udc56 ( \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, \u22ef , \ud835\udc41 ) based on equations (17) or (19); we use the discount rate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) and instantaneous utility\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) 1\u2212\ud835\udf03 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf03)\u2044 at time \ud835\udc61. In Step X, if time \ud835\udc61 has reached \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65, we proceed to Step XI; otherwise, we return to Step III. In Step XI, we calculate the utility from time \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 to infinite horizon \u221e using the discount rate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) at time \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65, added to utility \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56 and the process ends. If the discount rate is changed again by returning to Step III and proceeding from IV to VI, the new saddle point is recalculated and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) proceed along the new adjustment path."

            "text": "First, we initialize the common parameters to be used in the calculations. The number of agents is set to \ud835\udc41 = 1,000 (sufficient to compute the wealth distribution and Gini index). The time increment is \u2206\ud835\udc61 = 1 (24 \u00d7 365)\u2044 (hour), the interaction period is \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5d = 1 365\u2044 (day) and the maximum computation time is \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 = 10 (years). These values are relative; therefore, they could be read as 10 hours, 10 days and 100 years, respectively. Over 10 years, 7,300 people (10 \u00d7 365 \u00d7 2) would change their behaviour, each receiving an average of 0.73 interactions per year.\nThe initial discount rate is set to \ud835\udf0c0 = ln(1 \ud835\udf19\u2044 ) = 0.223 using the value \ud835\udf19~0.8 from the literature (Wang et al., 2016) and equation (18). The normative discount rate is set to \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 = 0.2, which is smaller than the initial value and the initial utility is set to \ud835\udc480 = 0. We set the exponent \ud835\udefc and capital depletion rate \ud835\udeff of the production function to \ud835\udefc = 0.5 and \ud835\udeff = 0.1 respectively, based on the values used in the literature (Romer, 2019: 27, 72; Nakata, 2011: 9, 90, 94; Hasumi, 2020: 25\u201326, 71). For the coefficient of relative risk aversion (\ud835\udf03), a wide variety of values have been reported depending on the measurement method and subject (Hartog et al., 2002; Itou, 2008; Elminejada et al., 2022); however, here it is set to \ud835\udf03 = 0.5. Initial capital and consumption are calculated as \ud835\udc580 = 2.39 and \ud835\udc500 = 1.31 using equations (5) and (6), respectively.\nWe used the following 12 calculations for the discount rate, the others\u2019 interaction parameters (\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 , \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50) and the social norm reference parameter (\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c): (i) three cases of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 (\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0); (ii) three cases of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 (\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0); (iii) three cases where the setting in (i) changes to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0.1; and (iv) three cases where the setting in (ii) is changed to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0.1. Primarily, the strength of the interaction is expressed in terms of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 and the constant \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc50 = 1.1 are set for the psychological bias parameter.\nFigure 2 shows the calculated distributions of discount rate, capital, consumption and utility for capital interactions \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.1, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0 and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc58 = 1.1. Figure 2A plots the discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) at time \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 = 10 for agent number #, while Figure 2B shows the frequency distribution of discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65). Similarly, Figures 2C\nand 2D show the distribution of capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) , while 2E and 2F show the consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and 2G and 2H show the utility \ud835\udc48 over an infinite horizon. Figure 2B shows that comparing capital with others, the mean of discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) decreases from the initial \ud835\udf0c0 = 0.223 to 0.207 (future-oriented). Accordingly, Figures 2D and 2F show that the mean of capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) increase from initial \ud835\udc580 = 2.39 and \ud835\udc500 = 1.31 to 2.65 and 1.36, respectively. The skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) are, respectively, 0.44 and 3.30, \u22120.33 and 3.11 for \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), \u22120.40 and 3.23 for \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and \u22121.27 and 5.96 for \ud835\udc48. Except for \ud835\udc48, the others are generally normal distributions.\nFigure 3 shows the temporal changes in discount rate, capital, consumption and utility for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.1 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0, as in Figure 2. Figure 3A plots the discount rate \ud835\udf0c for time \ud835\udc61 concerning agent #1 and Figure 3B is an enlarged part of 3A. Similarly, Figures 3C and 3D show the capital \ud835\udc58 and 3E and 3F show the consumption \ud835\udc50 . Figures 3G and 3H are the values of the interval integral of utility \ud835\udc48 from time 0 to \ud835\udc61. Note that the value of utility \ud835\udc48 converges to a constant value at infinite horizon \u221e. Figure 3A shows that agent #1 received nine interactions. In Figure 3B, the discount rate \ud835\udf0c decreases around time \ud835\udc61 = 7.0 and accordingly, Figure 3F shows that the consumption \ud835\udc50 decreases discontinuously. Thereafter, Figures 3D and 3F indicate that capital \ud835\udc58 and consumption \ud835\udc50 follow an adjustment path and converge to a new saddle point. At the new saddle point, capital \ud835\udc58 and consumption \ud835\udc50 are higher than before the decrease in discount rate \ud835\udf0c (Romer, 2019: 67\u201369). In other words, comparing capital with others suppresses the agent\u2019s consumption once; however, it leads to a higher level\nof economic behaviour in the future. Figure 3H shows a slight inflexion in the curve of utility \ud835\udc48 due to the change in the discount rate \ud835\udf0c.\nFigure 4 shows the calculated distributions of discount rate, capital, consumption and utility for consumption interactions \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.1, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0 and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc50 = 1.1. Figure 4A plots the discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) for agent number # and Figure 4B shows the frequency distribution of discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65). Similarly, Figures 4C and 4D show the capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), 4E and 4F show the consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and 4G and 4H show the utility \ud835\udc48. By comparison of consumption with others, in Figure 4B, the mean of discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) increases from the initial \ud835\udf0c0 = 0.223 to 0.240 (future\ndespised). Accordingly, Figures 4D and 4F show that the mean of capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) decrease from initial \ud835\udc580 = 2.39 and \ud835\udc500 = 1.31 to 2.17 and 1.25, respectively. This finding is opposite to the trend in Figure 2. The skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) are 1.00 and 4.59, respectively, \u22120.73 and 3.72 for \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) , \u22120.85 and 4.08 for \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and \u22121.42 and 5.99 for \ud835\udc48 . These values are all larger than that in Figure 2, indicating that consumption interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 distorts the shape of the distribution more than capital interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 .\nFigure 5 shows the temporal changes in discount rate, capital, consumption and utility for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.1 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0, as in Figure 4. Figure 5A plots the discount rate \ud835\udf0c for time \ud835\udc61 concerning agent #1 and Figure 5B is an enlarged part of 5A. Similarly, Figures 5C and 5D show the capital \ud835\udc58 and 5E and 5F show the consumption \ud835\udc50 . Figures 5G and 5H are the values of the interval integral of utility \ud835\udc48 from time 0 to \ud835\udc61.\nFigure 5A shows that agent #1 received four interactions. In Figure 5B, the discount rate \ud835\udf0c increases around time \ud835\udc61 = 7.8. Accordingly, Figure 5F shows that the consumption \ud835\udc50 once increases discontinuously. After that, as in Figures 5D and 5F, capital \ud835\udc58 and consumption \ud835\udc50 follow an adjustment path and converge to a new saddle point. At the new saddle point, capital \ud835\udc58 and consumption \ud835\udc50 are lower than before the increase in discount rate \ud835\udf0c. This finding is opposite to the trend in Figure 3. The comparison of\nconsumption with others induces the agent\u2019s consumption once; however, it leads to a lower level of economic behaviour in the future. Figure 5H shows a slight inflexion in the curve of utility \ud835\udc48 due to the change in the discount rate \ud835\udf0c.\nFigures 6A\u20136D show the results of calculating the mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of the discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and utility \ud835\udc48 for the interaction parameter \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and the reference parameter \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c. CV is the square root of the variance divided by the mean value and it measures inequality. The horizontal axis is \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 , the first vertical axis is the mean and the second is the CV. The mean for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0 is shown in navy and the CV in light navy and the mean for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0.1 in green and the CV in light green. Similarly, Figures 6E\u20136H show the calculation results for the interaction parameter \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50. Figures 6A\u20136D show that the capital interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 works in the direction of lowering the discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), which raises capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and utility \ud835\udc48. The values of CV are generally small, as\nis the effect of the social norm reference \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c. Comparing the CV of \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and the CV of \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) shows that the former is larger. In Figures 6E\u20136H, the consumption interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 raises the discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) more than the capital interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 , which in turn lowers capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and utility \ud835\udc48. Compared to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 , \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 has a generally more significant impact on CV. The impact on the CV of capital is larger than that of consumption and utility. The social norm illumination \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c reduces the increase in the discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and increases capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and utility \ud835\udc48. For \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.3 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0, the CV of \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) reaches 0.225 for the mean 1.82, corresponding to an increase in the Gini index of 0.14 when calculated from the distribution of \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65). When \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0 changes to 0.1, the CV drops to 0.09 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 the incremental Gini index falls to 0.05 . These results suggest that higher discount rates create capital (wealth) inequality and that social\nnorms that discourage waste are essential.\nFigure 7 plots capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) for discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65). Figures 7A and 7B show the capital interactions \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.1 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0. Figures 7C and 7D show the case where the settings of 7A and 7B change to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.3. Figures 7E and 7F show the consumption interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.1 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0. Figures 7G and 7H show the case where the settings of 7E and 7F are changed to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.3. The plots of \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) in Figures 7A, 7C, 7E and 7G generally ride on the curve represented by equation (5). Furthermore, the plots of \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) in Figures 7B, 7D, 7F and 7H generally ride on the curve represented by equation (6) (see graph of \ud835\udc58\u2217 and \ud835\udc50\u2217 at the saddle point for \ud835\udf0c in Figure 11A). In Figures 7A\u20137D, the plots are scattered on\nthe lower side of the curve and in Figures 7E\u20137H, the plots are scattered on the upper side of the curve. In the former, \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) decreases with \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 , showing the intermediate steps until convergence to a new saddle point, where capital \ud835\udc58 and consumption \ud835\udc50 become larger. In the latter, \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) increases with \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50, showing the intermediate steps until convergence to a new saddle point, where capital \ud835\udc58 and consumption \ud835\udc50 become smaller. Comparing Figures 7G and 7H with Figures 7C and 7D, the impact of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 on the discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) is more significant than that of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 . The curved shape is more clearly visible in Figure 7G and 7H than in Figure 7C and 7D because the range of the discount rate \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) is wider due to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 than due to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 .\nFigure 8 plots utility \ud835\udc48 over an infinite horizon against capital \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and consumption \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65). Figures 8A and 8B show the capital interactions \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.1 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0. Figures 8B and 8C show the case where the settings of 8A and 8B change to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.3 and Figures 8E and 8F show the consumption interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 =\n0.1 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0. Figures 8G and 8H show the case where the settings of 8E and\n8F change to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.3. Comparing Figures 8C and 8D with Figures 8A and 8B shows that as the capital interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 increases, utility \ud835\udc48 increases overall and its distribution widens. Comparing Figures 8G and 8H with Figures 8E and 8F shows that as the consumption interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 increases, utility \ud835\udc48 decreases overall and the shape of its distribution changes. Comparing Figures 8A\u20138D and Figures 8E\u20138H reveals difference in the tendency of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 to affect the distribution of utility \ud835\udc48. For \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 , the distribution moves toward the upper right, where \ud835\udc48 and \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) or \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) become larger. In contrast, for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50, the distribution once moves toward the upper left, where \ud835\udc48 increases and \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) or \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) decreases while \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 is small. It then moves toward the lower left, where \ud835\udc48 and \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) or \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) decrease as \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 becomes large.\nFigures 9A and 9B are plots of \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) versus \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) versus \ud835\udc48 for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.3 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0, respectively. Figure 9A is a repeat of 7C and 9B is a repeat of 8D. Similarly, Figures 9C and 9D are for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.3 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0 and are repeats of Figures 7G and 8H, respectively. Figures 9E and 9D show when the settings of either \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.3 or \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.3 are randomly chosen on the interaction occasion every period \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5d. Figures 9G and 9H are the cases where the settings of Figures 9E and 9D change from \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0 to 0.1 and a reference to the social norm is added. The shape of Figure 9E is intermediate between 9A and 9C and the shape of Figure 9F is intermediate between 9B and 9D. The means of \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc48 in Figures 9E and 9F are intermediate between those values in Figures 9A\u20139D (roughly\nthe average of the values shown in 9A\u20139D). Although not shown in Figure 9, the CVs are intermediate but larger than the average values in 9A\u20139D. Figures 9G and 9H change to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0.1 and also have intermediate shapes and values like 9E and 9F; however, the reference to social norms results in a smaller mean for \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and larger means for \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc48 compared to 9E and 9F. Although not shown in Figure 9, all CVs for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0.1 are smaller than that for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We formulated changes in the discount rate (time preference) based on the\nintercomparison of capital or consumption among agents and reference to social norms by connecting the Ramsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans model of dynamic macroeconomics and\nthe agent interaction model of microeconomics. This approach revealed that interactions with others affect the discount rate and produce inequality in capital (wealth) and utility\nand that references to social norms reduce changes in the discount rate and inequality. Specifically, when the interaction parameter with others \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 0.3 in Figure 6, the coefficient of variation increases to 0.225 and the Gini index increases by 0.14 as the discount rate \ud835\udf0c changes. In this case, when the social norm reference parameter \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c =\n0.1, the coefficient of variation drops to 0.09 and the increment of the Gini index falls\nto 0.05.\nA cohort study (Epper et al., 2020) divides participant groups into tertiles according to time preference (patience), showing that the wealth difference between the top and\nbottom time preference groups is in the 7\u20138 percentile. The difference between the top and bottom tertile is roughly 2\u03c3 (twice the standard deviation); thus, the wealth\ndifference translates into a coefficient of variation of about 4%, which corresponds approximately to cases \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58~0.3 or \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50~0.1 in Figure 6. This result can be interpreted as follows: if every individual had the same time preference at birth, as they grow up, their time preferences would gradually diverge due to their interactions with others,\nresulting in wealth inequality.\nA cross-cultural study on time preference (Reiger et al., 2021) calculates universal time\npreference (UTP) for 117 countries by integrating various survey data, including discount rate data from reference (Wang et al. 2016). A larger UTP means a smaller\ndiscount rate. Figure 10 uses UTP data and World Bank Gini index data to UTP and the Gini index for 104 countries (The World Bank). UTP and the Gini index have a weak\ncorrelation, although considerable variation occurs among countries due to economic conditions and cultural differences. The regression line indicates that the difference in\nthe Gini index relative to the maximum difference in UTP is about 0.15, which corresponds to the case \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50~0.3 in Figure 6. Social norms, including rules and culture, are fostered by mutual recognition (Heath, 2008); thus, we can infer that at least part of\nthe difference in the Gini index is caused by differences in time preference due to interaction with others. The red dots in Figure 10 indicate Islamic states, which are\nroughly below the regression line. This finding may be because Islamic states have laws (Sharia) that discourage waste compared to capitalist states.\nComparing Figures 6B and 6C and Figures 6F and 6G shows that the impact of the coefficient of variation of capital \ud835\udc58 from its interaction with others, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50, is larger than that of consumption \ud835\udc50. This finding is explained in Figure 11. Figure 11A graphs capital \ud835\udc58\u2217 and consumption \ud835\udc50\u2217 at the saddle point concerning the discount rate \ud835\udf0c using equations (5) and (6); 11B is a graph depicting the derivative \ud835\udc58\u2217\u2032 of \ud835\udc58\u2217 and the derivative \ud835\udc50\u2217\u2032 of \ud835\udc50\u2217 for \ud835\udf0c. Figure 11B shows that the absolute value of \ud835\udc58\u2217\u2032 is larger than the absolute value of \ud835\udc50\u2217\u2032; therefore, the impact of \ud835\udc58 from a change in \ud835\udf0c is larger than that of \ud835\udc50. This outcome suggests that interaction with others has a more significant impact on capital (wealth) inequality than consumption. The impact of the CV of utility \ud835\udc48 from \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 is even smaller than that of \ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udc50 because the impact of \ud835\udc50 is smaller than that of \ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc48 is a function of \ud835\udc50 and the integral value \ud835\udc48\nfrom time \ud835\udc61 = 0 is less sensitive than the instantaneous value of \ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udc50. This result is reflected in the slight inflexion of the curve in Figures 3G and 5G. Figures 6D and 6H show that the CV of \ud835\udc48 is about 8%, e.g. the CV of the well-being measured value in the literature (Pontin et al., 2013) is 23%. Among the various constituent factors of\nwell-being, utility based on consumption accounts for about 1/3 of well-being; therefore, the value of the CV of \ud835\udc48 itself is not small.\nComparing the left and right pairs in Figure 6, such as 6A and 6E, 6B and 6F and 6C and 6G, the impact of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 on the mean and coefficient of variation of \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) , \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc48 is larger than that of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 because equations (20) and (21) represent interactions. Looking at these, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 works in the direction of increasing the discount rate \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 decreases it. \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a is expressed as the multiplication of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 concerning the original \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37 ; therefore, as the interaction is repeated, the difference between \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a and \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37 (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a \u2212 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37 ) gradually increases for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 and decreases for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 , i.e. the impact of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 on the change in \ud835\udf0c is larger than that of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 . This finding suggests that consumption interactions impact capital (wealth) inequality more than capital interactions.\nFigure 6 shows the impacts of the social norm reference \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c on \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65), \ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc48 are larger on the \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 side and smaller on the \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 side because, as mentioned in the above paragraph, the change in \ud835\udf0c is larger for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 than for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 . Therefore, the suppression effect of the change in \ud835\udf0c by \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c is more likely to appear.\nFurthermore, the slight change in \ud835\udf0c due to \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 means that the value of \ud835\udf0c is near the initial value \ud835\udf0c0 = 0.223 and close to the normative discount rate \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 = 0.2 because this makes the (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 \u2212 \ud835\udf0c) \ud835\udf0c\u2044 term in equations (20) and (21) smaller. These findings suggest that social norms are more effective in reducing the impact of consumption interactions on inequality than capital interactions. Note that if the \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 setting is too large (i.e. if the social norm is made too loose), \ud835\udf0c will be larger and \ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udc50 will be smaller for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0.1 than for \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c = 0; this is shown in the case of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 = 0.3 in Figures 6A\u20136D. Conversely, a small setting of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 reduces waste, but an excessive setting may lead to stinginess. Therefore, the setting of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 should be set between stinginess and wastefulness. Greek philosophy, Buddhism and Islamic law\nalso teach this.\nThe difference in the shape of the distribution of utility \ud835\udc48 between Figures 8A\u20138D and\nFigures 8E\u20138H can be interpreted as follows. In Figures 8A\u20138D, the new saddle points, \ud835\udc58\u2217 and \ud835\udc50\u2217, are larger because the capital interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 decreases the discount rate \ud835\udf0c and utility \ud835\udc48 increases accordingly, i.e. it has a vector in the upper right direction of the graph. Nonetheless, since a decrease in \ud835\udf0c temporarily lowers consumption \ud835\udc50, \ud835\udc48, a function of \ud835\udc50, goes down; therefore, it has a vector in the lower direction of the graph. Thus, the distribution of Figures 8A\u20138D will have superimposed vectors in the upper\nright and lower directions. Conversely, in Figures 8E\u20138H, the consumption interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 increases \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udc58 \u2217, \ud835\udc50\u2217 and \ud835\udc48 decrease and those distributions have vectors in the lower left direction of the graph; however, since an increase in \ud835\udf0c temporarily raises consumption \ud835\udc50, \ud835\udc48, a function of \ud835\udc50, increases and has a vector in the upper direction of\nthe graph. Thus, the distribution of Figures 8E\u20138H will have superimposed vectors in the lower left and upper directions. Previous studies have examined income and\nwell-being relationships (Killingsworth, 2023); in the future, it might be fruitful to relate this to the graph of capital \ud835\udc58 and utility \ud835\udc48 in Figure 8.\nFigure 9E, with randomly selected capital interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and consumption interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50, has a distribution shape intermediate between Figures 9A and 9C and a roughly mean intermediate value between them. Figure 9F also has a shape intermediate between Figures 9B and 9D and a roughly mean intermediate value between them. These indicate that the impacts of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 on the discount rate \ud835\udf0c , capital \ud835\udc58 ,\nconsumption \ud835\udc50 and utility \ud835\udc48 can be treated as linear independence. The linearity of the graph of means in Figure 6 also indicates that the impacts of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 on \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc50 and \ud835\udc48 can be extrapolated. These are useful in examining various combinations of \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50. If we can understand whether individuals value capital or consumption in their interactions with others, we can approximate the impact on capital (wealth) and consumption. Although the coefficient of variation is an intermediate value, it is not an\naverage value and cannot be treated as linear independence; therefore, it must be recalculated again when examining capital (wealth) and utility inequality.\nThe distribution shapes in Figures 2 and 4 show that the capital interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 and the consumption interaction \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 generate distributions, i.e. inequalities, from initial uniform values; however, they are not power distributions, e.g. Pareto distribution (Newman, 2005), commonly found in wealth and income distributions. In other words, it is\nreasonable to consider that inequalities brought by changes in time preference (discount rate) based on interactions with others are part of the overall inequality. In contrast,\neconophysics studies various distributions, such as power and gamma distributions, by modelling asset exchange among agents based on the analogy of kinetic energy\nexchange (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti, AS & BK 2010); however, since these studies are physical analogies, they do not provide the same insight into\ncapital, consumption and utility dynamics as macroeconomics. To study inequality due to factors other than time preference and macroeconomic dynamics, developing an\napproach that connects the microeconomic interactions with dynamic macroeconomic models would be helpful, as presented in this study. This approach would lead to\ngeneralizations beyond the findings of this study. Based on this study, instead of the interaction model of time preference, it is possible to model the exchange of products\n(market) related to capital (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti AS & BK, 2010) and to model the interest and debt on capital, the production by joint ventures that\ncombine capital, the redistribution and mutual aid of capital (Kato & Hiroi, 2021; Kato, 2022; Kato, 2023). As a future development potential, this study\u2019s approach could be\nfurther extended by incorporating into the utility function not only consumption but also natural capital, social common capital and social relationship capital related to\nwell-being."

            "text": "This study presented a new model that connects the interaction effects of\nintercomparisons between individuals and others and references to social norms on time preferences to a dynamic macroeconomic model. Through this, we estimated the impact\nof changes in time preference (discount rate) on capital, consumption and utility and the inequality (coefficient of variation, Gini index) resulting from these changes. The new\nfindings are that (i) interactions with others significantly impact capital (wealth) inequality more than consumption. (ii) Among interactions with others,\nintercomparisons of consumption have a more significant impact on capital inequality and (iii) social norms effectively reduce the impact of consumption on inequality. These\nfindings reaffirm the importance of social norms against waste. Our supporting evidence indicates that the quantitative impact of the time preference interaction on wealth\ninequality corresponds to survey data from cohort and cross-cultural studies and that it has no small impact on utility inequality.\nPrevious studies have shown that multiple psychological motivations and factors, as well as mutual recognition and shared expectations of social groups, are essential for\ntime preference; however, no specific mathematical model exists for these factors and time preference. Therefore, we formulated the interactions on time preferences as\nrelative capital, consumption and social norm comparisons. Future behavioural economic research on time preferences could improve this study\u2019s model to provide\nfurther insights. Moreover, this study\u2019s approach of connecting microeconomic interactions with dynamic macroeconomic models can be expanded to model exchange,\ninterest and debt, redistribution and mutual aid."
