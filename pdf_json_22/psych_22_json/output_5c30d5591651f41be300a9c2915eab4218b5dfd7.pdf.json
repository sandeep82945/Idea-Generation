    "abstractText": "Purpose Studies of mental illness stigma reduction interventions have been criticised for failing to evaluate behavioural outcomes and mechanisms of action. This project evaluates training for medical students entitled \u2018Responding to Experienced and Anticipated Discrimination\u2019 (READ), developed to focus on skills in addition to attitudes and knowledge. We aimed to (i) evaluate the effectiveness of READ with respect to knowledge, attitudes, and clinical communication skills in responding to mental illness-related discrimination, and (ii) investigate whether its potential effectiveness was mediated via empathy or/and intergroup anxiety. Methods This is an international multisite non-randomised prevs post-controlled study. Eligible medical students were currently undertaking their rotational training in psychiatry. Thirteen sites across ten countries (n = 570) were included in the final analysis. Results READ was associated with positive changes in knowledge (mean difference 1.35; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.82), attitudes (mean difference \u2212 2.50; 95% CI \u2212 3.54 to \u2212 1.46), skills (odds ratio 2.98; 95% CI 1.90 to 4.67), and simulated patient perceived empathy (mean difference 3.05; 95% CI 1.90 to 4.21). The associations of READ with knowledge, attitudes, and communication skills but not with simulated patient perceived empathy were partly mediated through student reported empathy and intergroup anxiety. Conclusion This is the first study to identify mediating effects of reduced intergroup anxiety and increased empathy in an evaluation of anti-stigma training that includes behavioural measures in the form of communication skills and perceived empathy. It shows the importance of both mediators for all of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and hence of targeting both in future interventions.",

Recent international mental health\npolicies have highlighted the need for interventions to reduce discrimination [8, 9]. Several occupational groups have been identified as important sources of stigma and discrimination [10]. One is health-care staff, who was a target group for national anti-stigma campaigns in Canada [11] and Denmark [12] and a regional one in Andalucia [13].\nOn the other hand, a few studies have explored mental health professionals\u2019 potential for leadership in reducing the impact of stigma and discrimination through training [14\u201316]. More broadly, training in health advocacy and social justice is provided to health professionals in some settings, most notably students and trainee primary care physicians [17, 18]. Training on stigma and discrimination The members of The INDIGO READ Study Group are listed in acknowledgements. * Laura C. Potts laura.potts@kcl.ac.uk\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n1 3\ntherefore needs to acknowledge professionals\u2019 as both sources of discrimination and as potential anti-stigma change agents.\nTo date, stigma education for medical students has focussed solely on stigma reduction [19, 20], with research showing short-term attitude changes. These projects have attended little to medical education research, which highlights critical reflection and self-reflection as ways to improve attitudes, beliefs, understanding of a subject, and satisfaction in learning [21]. Nor have such projects made use of skills training, which is widely evaluated in medical education via the observation of interactions based on standardised clinical presentations with simulated patients.\nMeta-analysis of potential mediators of prejudice reduction through intergroup contact shows the importance of both increasing empathy for, and reducing anxiety about being with, the other group [22]. Among health-care professionals and students empathy is associated with patient satisfaction [23] and some clinical outcomes [24]. There has been little study of the role of these mediators in reducing negative attitudes towards people with mental illness despite the widespread use of contact interventions in this field [25]. It should not be assumed that their role is the same across groups; professionals with extensive occupational contact with people with mental illness are less likely to feel intergroup anxiety than are medical students. Understanding whether either has a mediating role in reducing negative attitudes within a given occupational or professional group will therefore inform further development of interventions that are tailored to the group to increase their potential effectiveness.\nThis project implements training for medical students entitled \u2018Responding to Experienced and Anticipated Discrimination\u2019 (READ), which applies the evidence bases from medical education and anti-stigma interventions and focusses on clinical skills in addition to attitudes and knowledge. READ aims to develop the role of future doctors to address and challenge mental illness-related discrimination, by improving medical students\u2019 ability to: respond to discrimination, applying evidence for effective anti-stigma interventions; respond to anticipated discrimination and hence reduce loss of social and economic opportunities due to avoidance; and minimise behaviours that may be experienced by patients as discriminatory.\nWe aimed (i) to evaluate the effectiveness of READ for medical students by investigating potential changes in students\u2019: knowledge, attitudes and skills in responding to mental illness-related discrimination and in simulated patients\u2019 ratings of student empathy; (ii) to investigate whether the potential effectiveness of READ on the above outcomes was mediated via empathy or/and intergroup anxiety."

The sites were either members of the INDIGO Network (a collaboration of researchers co-ordinated by the Centre for Global Mental Health, King\u2019s College London) [27, 28] or received a personal invitation to the study. Eligible participants were medical students undertaking their rotational training in psychiatry of at least 1\u00a0week or taking classes in psychiatry, which takes place in different years of training in different countries. Participants were allocated to either READ or the control condition of usual teaching. Allocation of groups could not be randomised as delivery of READ was dependent on when this was feasible for trainers and the wider research team, who had no funding for the study; allocation of individuals to groups could not be randomised as this is determined by medical schools. The study was approved by King\u2019s College London Psychiatry, Nursing and Midwifery Research Ethics Subcommittee (reference LRS-15/16-2894) and local approvals or exemptions were obtained at each site.\nSample size and power calculations have been described previously [26].

Development included piloting with medical students at King\u2019s College London who provided feedback via focus groups. The content, delivery, and evaluation of READ were informed by: (i) studies of patients\u2019 experiences of discrimination [29]; (ii) research on stigma and discrimination among health-care professionals [10, 30, 31]; (iii) the literature on contact-based education to reduce stigma in health-care professionals [11, 32, 33] and students; and (iv) the broader field of study on intergroup contact to reduce prejudice [22, 34].\n1 3\nREAD was designed to help students interact more effectively with patients they meet during the psychiatry rotation and hence enhance their overall learning rather than add unnecessarily to workload. READ was provided to small groups by the site research teams according to local teaching arrangements. The first session is delivered over 1.5\u00a0h near the start of the psychiatry rotation in each medical school; the second session, lasting 1\u00a0h, took place later before the end of the rotation. The length of the psychiatry rotation varies across medical schools; however, sites aimed to allow at least 1\u00a0week between the two sessions. This allowed time for students to identify the examples of discrimination to discuss in the second session. Further details on session content can be found in the study protocol [26].\nREAD was manualised and includes suggestions on adapting the training to each site\u2019s resources and culture and the inclusion of testimonials by people with lived experience of mental illness, either in person or filmed. The sites also had the option to correspond with each other to share strategies and resources for delivery. A fidelity checklist was included with the manual, covering the facilitators for prejudice reduction identified by intergroup contact research [34] and studies with health-care professionals specifically [11]. Sites were encouraged to complete this for each session."

This is a widely used assessment method in medical education, including for assessment of communication skills. The OSCE used in the study was developed by the research team at King\u2019s College London including the Head of Clinical Assessment (TV), using the GKT School of Medicine\u2019s template and marking scheme for all OSCEs used to assess medical students. We designed the scenario to fit the aims of the training. It required each medical student to discuss a referral to a local mental health team for treatment of the service user\u2019s psychosis. The simulated patient, role played by either members of the research team or their clinical colleagues, reported experienced and anticipated discrimination. The sites were provided with the OSCE scenario and a standardised marking scheme describing the objectives and assessment process. The OSCE simulated patients were briefed in writing to help them standardise their role and responses to students. Examiners (members of the research team at each site) were given guidance on rating the outcome as either pass, borderline pass, borderline fail, or fail [45]. The student was expected to acknowledge and explore the service user\u2019s experience and concerns and demonstrate empathy (verbally or nonverbally expressed). The student was assessed on (i) their response to the reports of anticipated and experienced discrimination; (ii) the extent to which they acknowledge the stereotypes of people with psychosis and distinguish these from the actual diagnosis and proposed treatment. At four sites, it was possible to mask examiners to participants\u2019 group allocation. The interrater reliability among examiners could not be determined, because there was one examiner per site.\nSimulated patients also assessed each student on empathic engagement using the 5-item JSPPPE (Jefferson Scale of\n1 3\nPatient Perception of Physician Empathy) [46]. Results of the OSCE were provided to students at the end of the second training session in the form of individual oral feedback, as students in the pilot teaching sites indicated that this was valuable in improving their skills and exam performance."

We chose priori a p value of lower than 0.15 to select the appropriate mediators to include in our final mediation analysis. We tested the independence of the mediators by examining partial correlations between our mediators after accounting for treatment allocation.\nA parametric multilevel linear regression mediation approach (gsem package in Stata version 16 [StataCorp]) was used to estimate the total effect, the natural indirect effects (NIE), and natural direct effects (NDE) of READ intervention on MAKS, MICA2, OSCE, and JSPPPE. The NDE represented the effect of READ intervention on knowledge, attitudes, skills, and patient perceived empathy that was independent of intergroup anxiety and empathy. An NIE represented the proportion of the relationship between the READ intervention and knowledge, attitudes, skills, and patient perceived empathy that could be explained by its effect with changes in intergroup anxiety and empathy. To quantify the magnitude of mediation, the study estimated the proportion of the effect mediated by intergroup anxiety and empathy (NIE/[NDE + NIE]). All analyses were estimated using bootstrapping (500 replications) to recover the correct SEs for direct and indirect effects. All models adjusted for the baseline outcome measure, and age and gender of the participant. All p values were two-tailed, and statistical significance was set at a p value less than 0.05."

The students in the intervention group also showed greater communication and behaviour skills as they had 2.98 (95% CI 1.90 to 4.67) times higher odds of receiving a higher category OSCE score than the control group students. The results also showed an increase in patient perception of empathy in the intervention group, as they scored on average 3.05 points (95% CI 1.90 to 4.21) higher on the JSPPPE than the control group.\nOur first sensitivity analysis, which adjusted for site rather than country as a random effect in the model, showed no difference in results. Our second sensitivity analysis, using meta-regression on country, also produced very similar effect estimates; however, high heterogeneity amongst sites was observed. Our final sensitivity analysis on a complete imputed dataset also showed no difference in results.

            "text": "Our findings are consistent with the literature on the mechanisms of action of intergroup contact [22]; both reduction in anxiety and increased empathy were important mediators of the observed improvement in attitudes to mental illness. This also applied, though to a lesser extent, to stigma-related knowledge, and to a small extent for the skills shown in the OSCE.\nOur use of knowledge as an outcome differs much other research on intergroup contact. In a recent meta-analysis, knowledge was studied as a potential mediator and was not found to be as important as anxiety or empathy [22]. We used a stigma-related knowledge measure as an outcome instead for two main reasons. First, a public health conceptualisation of stigma implies evaluation of stigma reduction with respect to knowledge along with attitudes and behaviour, as recommended by the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [52]. Second, health professionals and health-care students can be affected by a clinical bias due to exposure to people with mental illness during crisis and to people with more long-term and disabling illness. This can lead to therapeutic pessimism, which for this target group is an important target outcome, and is addressed by several MAKS items. We have thus tailored the outcomes to the mental health-care context [53]. Our results suggest that reduced anxiety and greater empathy can promote more therapeutic optimism.\nThe smaller mediating effects of intergroup anxiety and empathy on the behaviours demonstrated in the OSCE support the view that while these effects are useful in promoting these behaviours, their ability to predict behaviour in practice is precarious. Literature shows that while communication skills teaching can improve empathy, the effects are sustained through continued clinical practice [54].\nThe lack of mediation by self-reported anxiety or empathy on simulated patient perceived empathy in the presence of a direct effect on skills highlights two key issues in professional education. One is the importance of using patient feedback in addition to observer ratings in the assessment of clinical skills; and the other is the need to further explore the\nrelationship between self-rated and patient-rated empathy. We found no relationship between the two in our data; on searching for other studies, we found one recent report of a negative correlation between the two, by authors who had found no previous studies [55]. These authors interpreted their results as suggesting that some physicians underestimate their level of empathy, raising concerns about the validity of this measure. Alternatively, the READ training may have been sufficient to improve performance in that students responded to the simulated patient\u2019s concerns, but not in a way that was perceived as empathetic. Perceived empathy might improve with further clinical experience.\nHigh heterogeneity of effect was observed across countries. This may be due to how the intervention was delivered; however, fidelity checklist scores showed little variation which meant that we could not explore this quantitatively. Another possible explanation is unmeasured student differences among the sites; contact-based education may be counterproductive for some students, although the evidence for this comes from a younger target group [56]."

            "text": "Research on anti-stigma interventions in mental health has been criticised for focussing almost exclusively on attitudes as an outcome [57]. In this study, we took advantage of OSCEs as a long-established and widely used assessment method used in medical education to measure students\u2019 skills in addressing anticipated and experienced discrimination on the part of people with mental health problems. However, we cannot extrapolate the OSCE results directly to clinical practice, especially in settings where appointment times are very short and, therefore, the ability to replicate such discussions would be more constrained. Furthermore, medical students in some sites were more familiar with this method than at others, which may have led to variation in their performance both pre- and post-training. We also note that it was only possible to mask OSCE observers to allocation at four sites, and two sites could not administer the OSCE.\nWe also address a criticism of the evaluation of many contact-based interventions for mental health stigma reduction, namely lack of attention to mechanisms of action [25], through our measurement of the key mediators identified as reducing prejudice [22].\nOur inclusion of a control group strengthened the design and allowed for the mediation analysis; however, the lack of any funding for this study meant that we needed to be pragmatic and we were unable to randomise individual students or groups of students, reducing our ability to infer causality.\nRunning the study in multiple countries and amongst multiple ethnicities increased generalisability. It is highly possible that different sampling frames were used in different countries. Both sporadic and systematic missing data\n1 3\nwere observed across all countries and the primary analysis was complete case. However, a sensitivity analysis imputing to a full dataset using multiple imputation by chained equations showed no difference in results.\nThe intervention both discusses mental illness in general and specific diagnoses in relation to stereotypes and those illnesses disclosed by people in the video clips used (schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder) and other disorders disclosed by the experts by experience who presented in person. However, some disorders were not covered, including substance use disorders and dementia. The results may therefore not be generalisable to these disorders, either in terms of the outcomes or the mediators."

            "text": "There are two implications for medical education: regarding READ, and regarding the potential of psychiatry rotations to increase or reduce stigma. Our results suggest that READ can be used to improve communication skills in relation to addressing patients\u2019 experiences of and anticipation of discrimination, which may be experienced as empathetic on the part of service users, something critical to the development of therapeutic relationships. The partial mediation by anxiety and empathy suggest that READ is effective in improving mental illness stigma-related knowledge, attitudes, and skills even among students who are empathetic and do not feel anxious about working with people with mental illness. Our OSCE scenario of referral from primary care to mental health services is important given the impact of stigma on help-seeking for people with severe mental illness [58], and the large proportion of medical students who pursue careers in primary care. Further research and modification to the content would be needed to examine whether this type of training can promote communication to reduce the impact of stigma by doctors in\u00a0situations other than that covered by the OSCE. For example, doctors frequently have discussions with: patients concerned about disclosure of a mental health problem to a current or prospective employer [59]; stigmatising colleagues [60]; and with family members concerned about stigma affecting the patient and the wider family or who may themselves stigmatise the patient [29].\nPsychiatry rotation leads have educational priorities beyond stigma reduction, but must consider the overall impact of students\u2019 direct contact with service users and extended contact through contact with carers and mental health professionals, which may increase or decrease stigma [61]. Our results suggest that education and contact which reduce student anxiety about working with people with mental illness and preserving and promoting their empathy are both important in achieving stigma reduction during the rotation, and that this may facilitate therapeutic relationships and hence better outcomes in settings such as primary care.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00127- 022- 02284-0.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Norman Sartorius and Maria Milenova of the INDIGO Network, Dr Emmeline Lagunes Cordoba who helped pilot the delivery of READ in London, and members of SUITE, the service user and carer and family focussed part of the Education and Training Department of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust) and members of the Lived Experience Network, Oxleas Foundation Trust, who helped develop and/or deliver READ at the pilot stage.
