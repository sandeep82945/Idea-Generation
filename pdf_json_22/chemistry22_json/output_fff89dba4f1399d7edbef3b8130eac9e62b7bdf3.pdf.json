    "abstractText": "CK2 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase involved in many cellular processes such as gene expression, cell cycle progression, cell growth and differentiation, embryogenesis, and apoptosis. Aberrantly high CK2 activity is widely documented in cancer, but the enzyme is also involved in several other pathologies, such as diabetes, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and viral infections, including COVID-19. Over the last years, a large number of small-molecules able to inhibit the CK2 activity have been reported, mostly acting with an ATP-competitive mechanism. Polyoxometalates (POMs), are metaloxide polyanionic clusters of various structures and dimensions, with unique chemical and physical properties. POMs were identified as nanomolar CK2 inhibitors, but their mechanism of inhibition and CK2 binding site remained elusive. Here, we present the biochemical and biophysical characterizing of the interaction of CK2\u03b1 with a rutheniumbased polyoxometalate, [Ru4(\u03bc-OH)2(\u03bc-O)4(H2O)4 (\u03b3-SiW10O36)2] (Ru4POM), a potent inhibitor of CK2. Using analytical Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), and SAXS we were able to unravel the mechanism of inhibition of Ru4POM. Ru4POM binds to the positively-charged substrate binding region of the enzyme through electrostatic interactions, triggering the dimerization of the enzyme which consequently is inactivated. Ru4POM is the first non-peptide molecule showing a substrate-competitive mechanism of inhibition for CK2. On the basis of SAXS data, a structural model of the inactivated (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex is presented.",

Aberrantly high CK2 activity is widely documented in cancer, but the enzyme is also involved in several other pathologies, such as diabetes, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and viral infections, including COVID-19. Over the last years, a large number of small-molecules able to inhibit the CK2 activity have been reported, mostly acting with an ATP-competitive mechanism. Polyoxometalates (POMs), are metaloxide polyanionic clusters of various structures and dimensions, with unique chemical and physical properties. POMs were identified as nanomolar CK2 inhibitors, but their mechanism of inhibition and CK2 binding site remained elusive. Here, we present the biochemical and biophysical characterizing of the interaction of CK2\u03b1 with a rutheniumbased polyoxometalate, [Ru4(\u03bc-OH)2(\u03bc-O)4(H2O)4 (\u03b3-SiW10O36)2]10\u2212 (Ru4POM), a potent inhibitor of CK2. Using analytical Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), and SAXS we were able to unravel the mechanism of inhibition of Ru4POM. Ru4POM binds to the positively-charged substrate binding region of the enzyme through electrostatic interactions, triggering the dimerization of the enzyme which consequently is inactivated. Ru4POM is the first non-peptide molecule showing a substrate-competitive mechanism of inhibition for CK2. On the basis of SAXS data, a structural model of the inactivated (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex is presented.\nKeywords: CK2, inhibition, polyoxometalate, SAXS, substrate competitive\nINTRODUCTION\nProtein kinase CK2 (previously known as casein kinase 2 or CK2) is a eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinase, ubiquitous and extremely conserved throughout evolution (Pinna, 2002; Niefind and Battistutta, 2013). Despite the name, it is a \u201cpseudo\u201d casein kinase since casein is not a physiological substrate (Venerando et al., 2014). Indeed, CK2 phosphorylates hundreds of cellular proteins involved in practically all biological processes (St-Denis and Litchfield, 2009), and a dysregulated phosphorylation level of many of its targets has been associated with diverse human diseases (Borgo et al., 2021b). While some pathological conditions seem related to reduced CK2 activity (Dominguez et al., 2021), usually the CK2 overexpression and the resulting abnormally elevated catalytic activity have been associated to diseases. Cancer is the best-known example of this\nEdited by: Victor Bustos,\nThe Rockefeller University, United States\nReviewed by: Aleksandar Kondinski,\nUniversity of Cambridge, United Kingdom\nMasooma Ibrahim, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT),\nGermany\n*Correspondence: Maria Ruzzene\nmaria.ruzzene@unipd.it Mauro Carraro\nmauro.carraro@unipd.it Roberto Battistutta\nroberto.battistutta@unipd.it\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nMolecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics,\na section of the journal Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences\nReceived: 28 March 2022 Accepted: 18 May 2022 Published: 02 June 2022\nCitation: Fabbian S, Giachin G, Bellanda M,\nBorgo C, Ruzzene M, Spuri G, Campofelice A, Veneziano L, Bonchio M, Carraro M and\nBattistutta R (2022) Mechanism of CK2 Inhibition by a RutheniumBased Polyoxometalate.\nFront.

The pharmacological inhibition of CK2 has been largely pursued, not only for cancer but also for the drug resistant phenotype (Borgo and Ruzzene, 2019), and several inhibitors have been discovered and characterized, bearing variable degrees of efficiency and specificity, recently reviewed in (Qiao et al., 2019; Borgo and Ruzzene, 2021).\nIn CK2, the \u03b1 catalytic subunit (or its isoform \u03b1\u2019) and the \u03b2 \u201cregulatory\u201d subunit are associated to form the \u03b12\u03b22 tetrameric holoenzyme, the prevailing form of CK2 in cells (Niefind and Battistutta, 2013). CK2 is considered \u201cintrinsically active\u201d because the \u03b1-subunit does not undergo significant conformational changes between active and inactive conformations (which do not exist actually), as typical for other protein kinases, in which phosphorylation events or interactions with regulatory subunits shuffle the enzyme between the two states (Niefind et al., 2001). Instead, in CK2, the \u03b1-subunit is structurally locked in the active conformation, mainly because of the unique N-terminal extension and the presence of the DWG (Asp-Trp-Gly) motif, rather than the conventional DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) one, at the beginning of the activation loop. Together, these two characteristics block the activation segment in the active conformation, hampering the movements seen in other protein kinases, with the formation of inactive structures. As a consequence, the \u03b1 catalytic subunit is catalytically functional either when isolated or part of the tetrameric enzyme. However, mechanisms for the control of CK2 functions in cell should exist, but they have not been firmly established, yet. It was proposed that it is based on a self-inhibitory oligomerization process of the \u03b12\u03b22 holoenzyme, which is active in the monomeric form, but inactive when it forms trimers and higher ordered assemblies, where substrate binding is hampered (Lolli et al., 2012; Lolli et al., 2014; Lolli and Battistutta, 2015; Lolli et al., 2017). This explanation takes into account the absence of a truly inactive conformation of the catalytic subunit.\nSelectivity is one major issue in the development of the most studied class of kinase inhibitors, the ATP-competitive one. This because of the conservation of the structural features of the ATPbinding sites among kinases and other ATP-binding proteins, and the high concentration of ATP inside the cell, ~1\u201310 mM. However, despite these difficulties, effective ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors have been successfully developed, and as of 21 January 2022 there are 70 FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase inhibitors for clinical application (Roskoski, 2021) (http://www.brimr.org/PKI/PKIs.htm). Yet, many of these compounds show unfavorable side effects and are convenient only when conventional treatments of cancers have been ineffective (Montazeri and Bellmunt, 2020).\nThe class of the ATP-competitive inhibitors is the most explored also for CK2. The crystal structure of CK2\u03b1 in complex with the anthraquinone emodin was the first showing the details of the interaction between the enzyme and an ATPcompetitive inhibitor (Battistutta et al., 2000). The main characteristics of the CK2 ATP-binding site were described\nsome time ago (De Moliner et al., 2003; Battistutta et al., 2007; Mazzorana et al., 2008; Battistutta, 2009). As CK2 is constitutively active, only the active conformation (conventionally called \u201cDFG-in\u201d) can be targeted and therefore only the so-called \u201ctype I inhibitors\u201d can be developed (Mazzorana et al., 2008; Battistutta, 2009; Sarno et al., 2011; Niefind and Battistutta, 2013; Atkinson et al., 2021). One of the most studied and used type I ATP-competitive inhibitor is CX-4945 (silmitasertib) (Battistutta et al., 2011). This compound is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of various tumors and was established as Orphan Drug for cholangiocarcinoma in the United States. The selectivity issue in targeting the ATP-binding site is underlined by the fact that even CX-4945, despite its potency and efficacy, is able to inhibit also 12 other kinases with nanomolar activity.\nTo cope with the selectivity issue, recently, other inhibition modes were identified, which target the catalytic CK2\u03b1 subunit in different sites, namely the CK2\u03b1/CK2\u03b2 interaction site, the substrate binding site and some potential allosteric sites outside of the classic \u201ccatalytic box\u201d (Figure 1A) (Iegre et al., 2021). Regarding the targeting of the \u03b1/\u03b2 interaction site, although it could suggest high selectivity, one critical point is that the CK2\u03b1 subunit is constitutively active and CK2\u03b2 is assumed to modulate, but not to fully suppress or switch on, the catalytic activity of the enzyme. CK2\u03b2 can also regulate the substrate specificity of CK2 (Pinna, 2002; Borgo et al., 2021a). Furthermore, the binding pocket at the \u03b1/\u03b2 interface, located in the N-terminal domain of the \u03b1 subunit, is shallow and relatively small, and it seems quite difficult to be targeted with efficiency and potency either by peptides or small molecules. Thus, targeting the CK2\u03b1/CK2\u03b2 interaction site does not seem a promising strategy valid for all substrates and for the full inhibition of the catalytic activity of CK2. The development of substrate-competitive molecules (peptides or peptidomimetics) appears to be a promising approach particularly regarding the selectivity issue. In fact, unlike most protein kinases, CK2 exclusively phosphorylates acidic substrates, with a minimum consensus sequence S/T-X-X-E/D/pX, often with acidic residues also in position n + 1 and/or n + 2 (Pinna, 2002). Polyglutamyl peptides were early identified as CK2 substrate-competitive inhibitors (Meggio et al., 1983). However, the lack of structural data on complexes between CK2 and substrate makes the design of effective peptide inhibitors quite difficult, along with the fact that peptide-based molecules have low pharmacological profiles.\nFor some compounds targeting CK2 it was proposed an allosteric mechanism of inhibition (Prudent and Cochet, 2009; Iegre et al., 2021), yet the exact mode of action was never clarified and no structural data supporting the allosteric mechanism was produced (Brear et al., 2020).\nIt was early noted that in the human enzyme the hinge/\u03b1D region, located near the active site, has an unusual mobility, unique among protein kinases, with the existence of a closed and an open conformation (Figure 1B) (Battistutta and Lolli, 2011; Papinutto et al., 2012; Niefind and Battistutta, 2013). It was then anticipated that this feature could be exploited for the development of more selective ATP-competitive inhibitors\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 9063902\n(Battistutta and Lolli, 2011; Papinutto et al., 2012). Indeed, recently, it was found that inhibitor SRPIN803-rev binds to the ATP-binding site of CK2\u03b1 interacting with the open hinge/\u03b1D conformation of CK2\u03b1, with a binding mode incompatible with the closed conformation adopted by most protein kinases. This rationalizes the high selectivity of derivatives of SRPIN803-rev when tested on a panel of 320 kinases, despite the not exceptional IC50, which ranges from 0.28 to 1.37 \u03bcM. Notably, the lead SRPIN803-rev derivative shows an efficacy analogous to that of CX-4945 in cells (Dalle Vedove et al., 2020).\nThe high mobility of the hinge/\u03b1D region, unique to CK2, is at the basis of the very interesting discovery of a new pocket near the ATP-binding site, in the C-terminal domain, the so-called \u201c\u03b1D pocket,\u201d corresponding to a \u201clarge\u201d conformation of the hinge/\u03b1D region (Figure 1B). The \u03b1D pocket can be efficiently targeted by a new class of inhibitors, for instance compound CAM4066, which shows an IC50 of 0.37 \u03bcM, similar to SRPIN803-rev derivatives, and a promising selectivity on a panel of selected 52 kinases (Brear et al., 2016; Iegre et al., 2018).\nPolyoxometalates (POMs) are other interesting compounds explored as CK2 inhibitors. POMs are a class of polynuclear oxobridged transition metal complexes, which have received extensive attention due to rich topology and tunable chemical/ physical properties. In addition to the application in material design (Long et al., 2010) and catalysts (Wang and Yang, 2015), their biological activity has been highlighted (Van Rompuy and Parac-Vogt, 2019). The main advantages of POMs are that their shape, acidity, surface charge distribution and redox potentials can be easily tuned to optimize the interaction with biological macromolecules. POMs were thus proved to cross cell membranes, to display anticancer, antiviral or antibacterial properties. However, their low stability at neutral pH, associated with low selectivity and relevant cytotoxicity has hampered their clinical applications. In order to overcome\nthese drawbacks, POMs can be encapsulated into different delivery systems (Croce et al., 2019). Moreover, their structure can be successfully strengthened by introducing different transition metals (such as Ru, Ti or Co) or by the covalent grafting of organic pendants (Bijelic et al., 2019). In this way, biomedical studies could be performed on POMs stable in solution, employing physiological conditions and concentrations (\u010colovi\u0107 et al., 2020). The derivatization of POMs may increase both stability and bioavailability, while providing interesting opportunities for tracking and targeting (Zamolo et al., 2018; Ramezani-Aliakbari et al., 2021; Tagliavini et al., 2021).\nOwing to their nano-size, POMs are able to establish various types of interactions with peptides and proteins, ranging from electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds, also mediated by water or cations, to other weaker types of interactions (Arefian et al., 2017). These interactions may become more important when organic counterions and appended organic molecules are also present (Zamolo et al., 2018; Tagliavini et al., 2021). POMs are also able to inhibit several enzymes (Zhao et al., 2020). Some POMs were shown to inhibit CK2 in the low nanomolar range (Prudent et al., 2008), with a mechanism of action still unclear, presumably different form that of classical small organic molecules due to their different chemical nature.\nHere, we present structural and functional data regarding the CK2 inhibition by a ruthenium-based polyoxometalate, [Ru4(H2O)4(\u03bc-O)4(\u03bc-OH)2(\u03b3-SiW10O36)2]10\u2212 (Ru4POM) (Figure 1C), revealing for the first time the mechanism of action of a member of the class of the POMs inhibitors. Ru4POM has a significant biomimetic activity, fostered by the ruthenium atoms (Bonchio et al., 2019; Gobbo et al., 2020), and it has been selected for its high stability and solubility in water, even with high ionic strength, associated with a low toxicity. Moreover, its elongated structure results into dimensions (around 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 18 \u00c5) which seem favorable for a better interaction. Indeed,\nFIGURE 1 |Main interaction sites in catalytic CK2\u03b1.

In order to guarantee its use in all conditions explored, its stability was confirmed by UV-vis, in buffered/saline aqueous environments, up to pH 8.5.\nSince the presence of organic ligand as biotin was reported to be potentially useful for CK2 inhibition (Prudent et al., 2008), we also included in the screening some representative hybrid organic-inorganic POMs (Supplementary Figures S1, S2): [\u03b3SiW10O36{(C5H7N2OS)(CH2)4CONH(CH2)3Si}2O]\n4\u2212, BiotinSiW10 (Zamolo et al., 2018) and [\u03b3-SiW10O36{(C16H9) SO2NH(CH2)3Si}2O]\n4\u2212, Trp-SiW10 (Syrgiannis et al., 2019), which were prepared as tetrabutyl ammonium (TBA) salts, following post-functionalization strategies of the Keggin POM K8[\u03b3-SiW10O36]. The corresponding sodium salts were prepared by counterion exchange as previously described (Zamolo et al., 2018). In case of Trp-SiW10, the two enantiomeric forms of tryptophan were investigated. The giant-wheel-shaped (NH4)12[Mo36(NO)4O108(H2O)16], Mo36POM, was also prepared (Amini et al., 2015) to evaluate the impact of the dimensions and shape.\nIn Vitro CK2 Inhibition by Ru4POM First, we analyzed the efficacy of different POMs in decreasing the catalytic activity of recombinant CK2 (Table 1). We found that all polyoxotungstates inhibited CK2\u03b1, with similar IC50 in the low nM range, however, the most powerful compound was Ru4POM (IC50 3.63 nM). Concerning the hybrid polyoxotungstates, we observed a moderately higher activity for the lipophilic TBA salts.\nIn addition, both the nature and the configuration of the organic ligands had an impact on the inhibitory effect. The larger polyoxomolybdate showed very weak activity on CK2. Owing to these results, we focused the rest of our study on Ru4POM.\nMost inhibition assays and all the structural studies were performed with CK2\u03b1 deleted of the last 55 C-terminal residues since this deletion confers higher stability to the protein without affecting the catalytic activity (Niefind et al., 2000). Indeed, we found that the full-length monomeric enzyme (FL-CK2\u03b1) displayed identical sensitivity to Ru4POM (Table 1). Moreover, the presence of the \u03b2 subunit only marginally reduced the efficacy of Ru4POM, the tetrameric enzyme displaying an IC50 of 5.57 nM (Table 1).\nWe then evaluated if the Ru4POM inhibition efficacy depends on the kind of substrate. We observed a slightly lower inhibition when casein replaced the CK2-tide peptide as substrate; the IC50, however, was still in the low nM range (18.50 \u00b1 1.04 nm). We then checked whether Ru4POM competes with the substrates for the CK2 binding-site. As shown by the kinetics analysis reported in Figure 2, we found that Ru4POM exerts a competitive inhibition towards both model substrates, since it reduced the affinity (increased KM values for both CK2-tide peptide and casein), without decreasing the Vmax values.\nIn the experiments described so far, the activity of recombinant CK2\u03b1 was evaluated at the optimal in vitro conditions, namely at pH 7.5 and in the absence of NaCl. Given the high negative charge of Ru4POM, we evaluated if the inhibitory efficacy was affected by changes in pH and ionic strength. Deviation from the optimal conditions reduced the activity of the controls (see samples without Ru4POM in Figure 3A). Nonetheless, the residual activity was sufficient to perform the experiments, which show that the percent of inhibition induced by Ru4POM was reduced by the pH change: at 5 nM Ru4POM, the inhibition dropped from 75% at pH 7.5% to 66% at pH 8.5 (Figure 3B). A higher variation in the inhibition values was seen varying the ionic strength, from 75% inhibition observed without NaCl to 29% and 22% in presence of NaCl at 0.2 M or 0.5 M, respectively.\nRu4POM Inhibits Endo-Cellular CK2 Next, we wanted to assess whether Ru4POM was able to inhibit CK2 inside intact cells. Preliminary attempts to detect inhibition of CK2 activity in Ru4POM-treated cells failed, indicating a too small cell permeability of the compound (not shown). Therefore, we tried to treat cells with Ru4POM in combination with increasing amounts of two different cationic transfection reagents, the stable cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) and the cationic liposome JetOptimus (Figure 4). Endogenous CK2 activity was monitored by means of the phospho-antibody towards Akt1 phospho-Ser129, a well-known and specific target of CK2 (Ruzzene et al., 2010). We observed that cell treatment with Ru4POM combined with one of the cationic compounds reduced the phosphorylation of this site (while the total amount of Akt1 protein was unchanged) and the effect was potentiated by increasing the amount of the transfecting reagents, likely due to higher amounts of Ru4POM delivered into the cells.

SEC elution profiles (Supplementary Figure S3) were monitored at 280 nm, where both protein and Ru4POM have an absorption contribution (blue and black curve, respectively), but also at 500 nm, where only the signal of Ru4POM is present (red curve). The lack of absorption of CK2\u03b1 at 500 nm (green curve) allows to unequivocally recognize the elution of Ru4POM. In 25mM Tris, 500mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH = 8.5, free CK2\u03b1 elutes at 12.6 ml retention volume, in the monomeric form (Supplementary Figure S3, blue curve), in accordance with the well-known notion that\nCK2\u03b1 is monomeric at high salt, typically above 0.4M NaCl, and tends to aggregate at lower ionic strengths (Niefind et al., 1998; Ermakova et al., 2003; Seetoh et al., 2016), as also confirmed by our SEC-SAXS experiments (see below). In the same running conditions, Ru4POM elutes at higher elution volumes, at 16.0 ml (Supplementary Figure S3, black curve at 280 and red curve at 500 nm), corresponding to lower hydrodynamic volumes, in accordance with the smaller dimensions (MW 5 kDa).\nThe elution profile of samples with Ru4POM:CK2\u03b1 in a 1:1 M ratio on a Superdex 75 column shows a unique peak at about 11.4 ml elution volume (Figure 5A, black curve), with the disappearance of the peaks corresponding to the isolated species (Figure 5A, blue curve for monomeric CK2\u03b1). The presence of the absorption at 500 nm for the peak at 11.4 ml (red curve) confirms that all Ru4POM are tightly bound to CK2\u03b1, with the formation of a stable complex. From the elution volume it can be estimated that the complex is formed by two molecules\nFIGURE 2 | Substrate-competitive inhibition.

This, together with the 1:1 M ratio of Ru4POM:CK2\u03b1, indicates that a complex of stoichiometry (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 is formed.\nTo further investigate the interaction between CK2\u03b1 and Ru4POM, we analysed samples with increasing molar ratios in a Superdex 200 column, which has a higher MWs resolution range. The elution profiles with the unchanged buffer system, 25 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH = 8.5, of samples with various Ru4POM/CK2\u03b1 ratios, namely 1:1, 2:1, 5:1, and 10:1, are shown in Figure 5B. It is evident that increasing amounts of Ru4POM induce the formation of species with larger hydrodynamic dimensions, that is, high-order oligomeric forms of CK2\u03b1/Ru4POM complexes. Very similar elution profiles for ratios 5:1 and 10:1 indicate that the saturation is reached for such values. The large variations in the elution volumes are explained by the formation of oligomeric forms of CK2\u03b1/Ru4POM complexes rather than by the formation of species where monomeric CK2\u03b1 (MW 40 kDa) is interacting with multiple POMs units (MW 5 kDa). Overall, the SEC experiments indicate that Ru4POM induces the oligomerization of CK2\u03b1, with the formation of dimers when the ratio is 1:1 and of larger assemblies when the ratio is higher, with the saturation reached around 5:1 ratio."

The perfect superposition of the peaks recorded at 280 and 500 nm (red curve) indicates the co-elution of CK2\u03b1 and Ru4POM and hence the formation of a stable complex. The absence of peaks corresponding to the single species suggests that the complex eluting at 11.3 ml has a stoichiometry (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2.

Here, the CK2\u03b1/Ru4POM titration produces a typical single transition, saturation-shaped thermogram, which can be fitted by the sigmoidal binding isotherm of the one binding-site model. From two independent experiments, we derived an apparent mean KD of 2.09 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcM for the single macroscopic dissociation constant. The derived stoichiometry for the complex is 1:1 (1.04 \u00b1 0.02), in accordance with the chromatographic data, thus supporting the formation of a stable (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex.

For the sake of comparison, Keggin-type POMs as [H2W12O40]\n6\u2212 (H2W12) interacting with human serum albumin (HSA) were also characterized by enthalpically driven exothermic process, while bigger W-based POMs as [NaP5W30O110]\n14\u2212 (P5W30), showed an important endothermic component, mainly attributed to the unfolding of the protein (Zhang et al., 2008)."

The Rg and I(0) traces as functions of the SEC elution profile frames showed that the protein was monodispersed in presence of 0.5 M NaCl (Figure 7A, black curve). However, decreasing the ionic strength to 0.3 and 0.2 mM NaCl resulted in protein precipitation prior SAXS experiments, as indicated by the very low signals (green and cyan curves), in line with the known behavior of CK2\u03b1 at low salt concentration.\nPrimary analysis from selected scattering curves of CK2\u03b1 at 0.5M NaCl indicated that the protein is globular, with Rg value of 2.3 nm, corresponding to an estimated molecular weight of about 39 kDa, as\nexpected from monomeric CK2\u03b1, in line with the MW estimation from the previous SEC experiments. The comparison between the CK2\u03b1 crystal structure and the SAXS data showed good fitting value (\u03c72 1.29) (Figure 7B) and the 3D bead model of the DAMMIF envelope overlaid well the crystal structure of CK2\u03b1 (Figure 7C), further supporting the presence of themonomeric state at 0.5MNaCl.\nWe then analyzed a mixture of CK2\u03b1:Ru4POM at 1:1 M ratio in presence of 0.5 M NaCl, and the scattering data on the single monodisperse species displayed significant structural differences compared to the free form of CK2\u03b1 (Figure 7B). Notably, at this concentration Ru4POM does not significantly contribute to the scattering profiles (Supplementary Figure S4A). The Rg of the complex determined by Guinier analysis showed a value of 3.1 nm (Figure 7B) and a molecular weight of about 79.7 kDa, a mass that corresponds to the formation of a stable CK2\u03b1 dimer, in accordance with the previous SEC estimations. This supports our hypothesis, based on previous SEC and ITC data, that CK2\u03b1 undergoes a Ru4POM-mediated dimerization, with the formation of a stable (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex. Importantly, in accordance with the lack of a significative entropic contribution for the CK2\u03b1/Ru4POM interaction seen with ITC, SAXS data do not show any evidence of protein denaturation.\nExperiments on 1:1 mixtures of CK2\u03b1:Ru4POM at lower ionic strengths, i.e., 0.3 and 0.2 MNaCl, caused protein precipitation of the sample, as in the case of free CK2\u03b1, hampering the possibility of reliable SAXS analyses (Figure 7D).\nNext, we monitored the effect of 2 and 10 M equivalent of Ru4POM at 0.5 M NaCl, and the Rg and I(0) traces showed the formation of soluble complexes but in a multi-component system, with different size and molecular weight species coexisting in solution (Supplementary Figure S4B). We then tried to get more detailed structural information on the nature of the (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex from the available SAXS data. Starting from the evidence that Ru4POM actively induces the dimerization of CK2\u03b1, the most reasonable assumption is that Ru4POM structurally mediate the interaction between two molecules of the enzyme. This is the simpler and more plausible explanation that globally takes into account our SEC, ITC and SAXS data.\nFIGURE 6 | ITC measurements. (A) A representative raw titration data (black thermogram) obtained from the titration of 30 \u03bcM CK2\u03b1 with 400 \u03bcM Ru4POM at 25.3\u00b0C, in 25 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.5.

The docking of Ru4POM on monomeric CK2\u03b1 was obtained using geometry-based molecular docking algorithms (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005) and yielded several models with good molecular shape complementarity, where negatively charged Ru4POM invariably interacts with CK2\u03b1 along the large positively charged area present on the protein surface between the ATP binding pocket and the substrate binding site (Figure 1A). This result is in accordance with the biochemical data that indicates a substrate-competitive mechanism of inhibition, and with the thermodynamic signature of the interaction, largely enthalpic as deduced by ITC measurements. Since the precise location of Ru4POM in the substrate-binding site of CK2\u03b1 is not known, we generated possible dimers starting from each of the 19 plausible CK2\u03b1Ru4POM docking models (Figure 8).\nFirst, the predicted dimers were validated based on the best \u03c72 value obtained fitting the structures with the experimental SAXS data; then, only dimers stabilized by inter-molecular Ru4POMmediated contacts were selected (Figure 8; Supplementary Figure S5). This strategy allowed to identify a CK2\u03b1-Ru4POM\nFIGURE 7 | SAXS studies on CK2\u03b1-Ru4POM complex.

In this model, each of the two Ru4POM molecules bind to each of the two CK2\u03b1 subunits, in a region adjacent to the ATP binding pocket, between the hinge-\u03b1D region and the Gly-rich loop, overlapping part of the substratebinding site. Ru4POM engages both intermolecular electrostatic interactions and H-bonds with polar and positively charged residues of the enzyme.

            "text": "It was reported that members of the family of the polyoxometalates are potent inhibitors of the CK2 activity in vitro. However, their mechanism of inhibition and CK2 binding site are not firmly established yet. For one of the best POM inhibitors, [P2Mo18O62]\n6\u2212, steady-state kinetic analysis showed that it did not target CK2\u03b1 either at the ATP-binding site or at the protein substrate binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis and proteolytic degradation of the CK2\u03b1-POM complex suggested that this POM binds to domains containing key structural elements such as the Gly-rich loop, the helix \u03b1C and the activation segment. Nevertheless, the low chemical stability in an aqueous environment of this POM hampered to establish a clearly defined binding site and inhibition mechanism (Prudent et al., 2008).\nHere, we confirm that different POMs are potent inhibitor of CK2\u03b1, with IC50 in the low nanomolar range, the best one being a\nruthenium-based polyoxometalate, [Ru4(\u03bc-OH)2(\u03bc-O)4(H2O)4 (\u03b3-SiW10O36)2]10\u2212. Some hybrid organic-inorganic POMs belonging to the Keggin decatungstosilicate family, which share the same SiW10O36 unit of Ru4POM, were also shown to be promising. The variation of the inhibitory activity with the organic domains will thus deserve attention, for the possibility to anchor suitable recognition motifs and develop, for example, bispecific inhibitors (Iegre et al., 2021). Interestingly, cell penetration of these derivative has been previously demonstrated (Zamolo et al., 2018). For now, we have focused our attention on the structurally rigid Ru4POM.\nRu4POM has an IC50 of 3.63 nM on the catalytic subunit, either full-length or deleted of the last 55 C-terminal residues, which are flexible in solution. A very similar IC50, 5.57 nM, was found on the tetrameric enzyme. This similarity in the IC50 values exclude that the Ru4POM binding region is located either at the C-terminus of CK2\u03b1 or at the \u03b1/\u03b2 interface. Importantly, we showed that this compound is stable in the aqueous condition of the biochemical assays (up to pH 8.5), indicating that the full molecule and not some decomposition fragments are active on the enzyme, as instead reported for other POMs (Prudent et al., 2008).\nRu4POM has a net negative charge, like the CK2 substrates, therefore we tested whether it works with a substrate-competitive mechanism. Indeed, we show that Ru4POM competes with the substrates, either small peptides or casein, indicating that it interacts with CK2 at the level of the substrate-binding site. This interaction is modulated by the pH and the ionic strength, in accordance with a substrate-competitive mechanism of inhibition where the electrostatic interactions play an important role in the binding of both negative substrates and Ru4POM to the positively charged CK2 substrate-binding site.\nFIGURE 9 | Structural organization of the (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex.

However, when applied in combination with cationic transfection reagents, we do observe inhibition of endo-cellular CK2, meaning that, with the appropriate delivery system, it can be transported inside the cells despite its dimensions and its highly negative charge. It is worth mentioning that CK2 is also present on the outer cell surface [CK2 ecto-kinase (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2005)], with functions that are largely unknown; in this view, Ru4POM could represent a valuable tool to discriminate between ecto- and endo-cellular CK2, according to the administration conditions.\nTo possibly decipher the mechanism of inhibition of Ru4POM on CK2 we performed different biophysical analyses. Sizeexclusion chromatography experiments at 0.5 M NaCl show that Ru4POM induces the dimerization of CK2\u03b1, with the formation of a (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex, with no residual presence of the single components, indicating the formation of a strong and stable complex. SAXS experiments confirm the presence of such a complex, with dimeric CK2\u03b1 when Ru4POM is present in equimolar amount. According to SEC data, larger assemblies are formed at higher molar ratios, with the saturation reached at around 5:1 for Ru4POM:CK2\u03b1.\nThe specific interaction between Ru4POM and CK2\u03b1 with the formation of a stable complex is confirmed by ITC measurements, which indicates a macroscopic apparent mean KD of 2.09 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcM and a 1:1 stoichiometry, in accordance with SEC and SAXS data. The observed thermodynamic parameters agree with literature data on the interaction between inorganic POMs and proteins, which are characterized by KD in the \u03bcM range (Zhang et al., 2007; Zamolo et al., 2018; Vandebroek et al., 2021) and by a dominant enthalpic contribution. The exothermal process, in particular, entails the key role of the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds, in line with the polar nature of the interaction between Ru4POM and the substrate-binding site of CK2. The negligible entropic term, instead, shows that the possible stiffening of the protein structure on one hand, and the dehydration of this highly hydrophilic POM, on the other hand, are not relevant. Noteworthy, despite larger POMs may display higher free energy of binding (Zhang et al., 2007), their large surface seems to hamper the targeting of the CK2 sites involved in the inhibitory activity, as observed for Mo36POM, indicating the importance of the shape complementarity between CK2 and the other tested POMs.\nThe structural analysis of the SAXS signal reveals the shape of the complex formed by CK2\u03b1 and Ru4POM, with Ru4POM connecting two CK2\u03b1 molecules, which, in turn, can interact with each other. Ru4POM binds to CK2\u03b1 in a region adjacent to the ATP binding pocket, in between the hinge/\u03b1D region and the Gly-rich loop, overlapping part of the substrate-binding site. The two Ru4POMmolecules do not directly interact to each other and bind CK2\u03b1 through polar interactions, likely both hydrogenbonds and electrostatic forces.\nAs Ru4POM is able to inhibit also the \u03b12\u03b22 holoenzyme, we structurally superposed two molecules of \u03b12\u03b22 on the (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex, to see whether the structural information derived by SAXS are valid also for the tetrameric holoenzyme (Figure 10). Indeed, we obtained a reasonable model for the hypothetical Ru4POM-mediated dimerization of the full enzyme, with no evident steric overlaps between the two tetramers. Then, we suggest that Ru4POM binds to \u03b12\u03b22 in a very similar way to that seen for the isolated CK2\u03b1, inhibiting the full enzyme with the samemechanism shown for the free catalytic subunit. It has been proposed that the mechanism of regulation of the enzyme relies on the self-inhibitory oligomerization of \u03b12\u03b22, mediated by inter-tetrameric electrostatic interactions involving the acidic loop of the \u03b2-subunit of one tetramer (Asp55\u2013Asp64) and the positively charged P + 1 loop of the \u03b1-subunit of the other tetramer (Arg191\u2013Lys198). It is plausible that Ru4POM is able to interfere with the normal regulation of the enzyme activity by affecting the oligomerization process of the tetrameric form of CK2. It is also possible that Ru4POM affect the interaction of CK2 with at least some of the interacting partners of this kinase.\nIn summary, we could unravel the mechanism of inhibition of a Ru-based POM, a compound stable in aqueous solution and able to inhibit CK2 in the very low nanomolar range. Cell internalization has also been addressed by using suitable transfecting agents. Ru4POM binds to CK2 and induces the formation of a (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex, which is inactive because the substrate-binding site and the ATP-binding site are inaccessible to substrates and ATP, respectively. This inhibition mechanism is entirely different from the common ATPcompetitive one typical for most of the known protein kinase inhibitors. Ru4POM has physical and chemical properties very different from that of conventional kinase inhibitors (small organic molecules), and this, coupled to its ability of inhibition in cell-based assays, make this compound particularly interesting for further developments. Notably, Ru4POM is the first nonpeptide molecule showing a substrate-competitive mechanism of inhibition. Atomic details of the interaction between CK2 and Ru4POM can be unravelled by the crystallographic analysis of the\nFIGURE 10 | Structural superposition of two \u03b12\u03b22 tetramers, 1 and 2 (\u03b1subunits in cyan, \u03b2-subunits in blue), on the (CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex (in orange). In this arrangement, the two tetramers do not show evident steric clashes, suggesting that they can interact with Ru4POM in a similar way to the isolated catalytic subunit.\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 90639010\n(CK2\u03b1)2(Ru4POM)2 complex, which would be useful to obtain information regarding the most relevant interactions that stabilize the complex. While many crystal structures of CK2 are available, alone or in complex with inhibitors (mainly ATP-competitive), complexes with substrate peptides have never been crystallized, suggesting that also the crystallization of CK2 in complex with POMs acting as substrate-competitive inhibitors could not be straightforward.\nWhile a selectivity profile of Ru4POM against a protein kinase panel is beyond the purpose of this study, our findings suggest that a remarkable specificity for CK2 is highly conceivable, being this compound able to function as a substrate-competitive inhibitor of a kinase, CK2, with the uncommon property of targeting negatively charged substrates."

The CK2\u03b1 and CK2\u03b1/Ru4POM mixtures were measured by SEC-SAXS approaches (Brennich et al., 2017). Samples containing 300 \u03bcM Ru4POM, 300 \u03bcM CK2\u03b1 and 300 \u03bcM CK2\u03b1:Ru4POM at 1:1 M ratio in buffer 25 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.5 and 0.5 M NaCl were loaded on a GE Superdex Increase 200 (3.2/300) column. For samples measured at 0.3 and 0.2 M NaCl (buffer 25 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.5) CK2\u03b1 concentration was 130 \u03bcM. Samples with 200 \u03bcMCK2\u03b1with CK2\u03b1:Ru4POM at 1:2 and at 1:10 M ratio in buffer 25 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.5 and 0.5 M NaCl were loaded on a Agilent AdvanceBio SEC (4.6/300) and on a GE Superose 6 Increase (3.2/300) columns, respectively. The samples were centrifuged (16,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C) prior the measurements and 50 \u03bcl of sample were injected in the columns. The purifications were carried-out via a highperformance liquid chromatography device (HPLC, Shimadzu) attached directly to the sample-inlet valve of the BM29 sample changer. The columns were equilibrated with 3 CV to obtain a stable background signal before measurement. A flow rate of 0.3 ml/min was used for all sample measurements. All SAXS data were collected at a wavelength of 0.99 \u00c5 using a sample-todetector (PILATUS 2M, DECTRIS) distance of 2.867 m. Data reduction and preliminary data processing were performed automatically using the Dahu/FreeSAS pipeline implemented at BM29. In the SEC-SAXS chromatograms, frames in regions of stable Rg were selected with CHROMIXS and averaged using PRIMUS to yield a single averaged frame for each protein sample. Analysis of the overall parameters was carried out by PRIMUS from ATSAS 3.0.4 package (Manalastas-Cantos et al., 2021). For CK2\u03b1 and CK2\u03b1:Ru4POM at 1:1 the pair distance distribution functions, P(r), were used to calculate ab initio models in P1 and P2 symmetries, respectively, with DAMMIF (Manalastas-Cantos\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 90639011\net al., 2021). Plots and protein models were generated using OriginPro 9.0 and UCSF Chimera software, respectively. SAXS parameters for data collection and analysis are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 following international guidelines (Trewhella et al., 2017). SAXS data were deposited into the Small Angle Scattering Biological Data Bank (SASBDB) under accession numbers SASDNF7 for CK2\u03b1 and SASDNG7 for CK2\u03b1: Ru4POM 1:1."

            "text": "The molecular docking of Ru4POM to CK2\u03b1 was obtained exploiting Patchdock (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005) using the pdb model of Ru4POM as ligand and CK2\u03b1 (PDB 3q04) as receptor. The docking resulted in 19 plausible models of a complex formed by CK2\u03b1 monomer binding a single molecule of Ru4POM bound in different positions along the entire positively charged cavity of CK2\u03b1. Symmdock (SchneidmanDuhovny et al., 2005) was then used to generate CK2\u03b1Ru4POM dimers using as input the 19 plausible docking models for a total of about 1,900 dimeric species (i.e., the first 100 best scored dimers obtained with Symmdock per each of the 19 docking models obtained with Patchdock). Our data showed that CK2\u03b1 never forms dimers or multimers in solution while Ru4POM induces CK2\u03b1 dimerization at 1:1 M ratio. Based on this experimental observation, only the Symmdock-generated CK2\u03b1: Ru4POM dimers, where Ru4POM mediates intermolecular contacts between two CK2\u03b1 monomer, were selected. The structures of models were ranked according to the lower \u03c72 value obtained by structure comparison between the models and the SAXS data of the CK2\u03b1-POM complex using CRYSOL (Manalastas-Cantos et al., 2021). The best model was then fitted into the DAMMIF envelope using SUPCOMB (Kozin and Svergun, 2001).\nIn Vitro CK2 Activity Assay For IC50 (concentrations inducing 50% inhibition) analysis, recombinant tetrameric CK2 (\u03b12\u03b22), or C-terminal-deleted CK2\u03b1 (CK2\u03b11\u2013336), or full length CK2\u03b1 (7.5 ng) were incubated with 0.1 mM synthetic peptide substrate RRRADDSDDDDD (CK2-tide), in a phosphorylation buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 \u03bcM [\u03b333P]ATP (1,000\u20132,000 cpm/pmol), in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl, with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor. In the case of tetrameric CK2, 0.1 M NaCl was also present in the phosphorylation mixture. Controls were performed in the absence of any inhibitor, but with equal volume of vehicle (H2O). Reactions were performed at 30\u00b0C for 12 min and stopped by sample absorption on phospho-cellulose papers. Papers were washed three times with 75 mM phosphoric acid and counted in a scintillation counter (PerkinElmer). In the case of casein substrate (used at 0.05 mg/ml concentration), reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer, samples were analyzed by 11% SDS-PAGE, and radioactive bands were detected and quantified by digital autoradiography (Cyclone plus storage phosphor system, PerkinElmer). IC50 calculation was\nobtained by analysis of the results with GraphPad Prism 7.0a software.\nFor kinetics analysis, the assays were performed with increasing concentrations of CK2-tide or casein, in the phosphorylation buffer described above, but with 100 \u03bcM ATP concentration."
