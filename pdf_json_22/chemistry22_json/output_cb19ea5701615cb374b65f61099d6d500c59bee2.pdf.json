    "abstractText": "The development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still a key challenge at the current stage. Herein, FeNi LDH/V2CTx/nickel foam (NF) self-supported bifunctional electrode was prepared via deposition of FeNi LDH on V2CTx/NF substrate by hydrothermal method. Strong interfacial interaction between V2CTx/NF and FeNi LDH effectively prevented the aggregation of FeNi LDH, thus exposing more catalytic active sites, which improved electrical conductivity of the nanohybrids and structural stability. The results indicated that the prepared FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF required 222 mV and 151 mV overpotential for OER and HER in 1 M KOH to provide 10 mA cm\u22122, respectively. Besides, the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrocatalysts were applied to overall water splitting, which achieved a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 at 1.74 V. This work provides ideas for improving the electrocatalytic performance of electrocatalysts through simple synthesis strategies, structural adjustment, use of conductive substrates and formation of hierarchical structures.",

            "text": "Electrocatalytic water splitting to produce H2 and O2 as a green and efficient energy carrier has gained wide recognition and attention in the past decades [1\u20134]. Electrocatalytic water splitting consists of the process of HER and OER at the cathode and anode, respectively. In both cases, it is greatly significant to explore efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts to reduce the excessive overpotential [5,6]. To date, the commonly used OER and HER electrocatalysts are the commercially IrO2, RuO2 materials and Pt/C materials [7,8]; however, the high cost, limited reserves and poor multifunctional properties greatly limit their applications in water splitting [9,10]. At present, non-noble M-based materials like layered double hydroxide (LDH) have received extensive attention because of their flexible structural composition, diversified synthesis techniques and excellent electrocatalytic activity are considered to be outstanding electrocatalysts for water splitting [11\u201317]. Among LDH materials, FeNi LDH has received much attention for its good physicochemical properties, excellent OER electrocatalytic properties and durability in alkaline media [18,19]. Although FeNi LDH has been proved to be efficient in electrocatalysis, there are still two obstacles to further enhancements [20\u201322]. The first obstacle is its low conductivity due to poor carrier mobilities [23]. Two ways can be taken to overcome this obstacle. One is to combine FeNi LDH with highly conductive materials, such as graphene [24], crystal carbon conjugated (g-C3N4) [25], two-dimensional\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2640. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12152640 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2640 2 of 15\n(2D) carbides and nitride (MXenes). The other is to grow FeNi LDH on a conductive skeleton, such as Al foil, Ni foam (NF), Ti sheet, carbon paper, carbon cloth and stainless steel mesh, etc [26,27]. The second obstacle is that aggregation of FeNi LDH leads to a reduction of its active site. There are some works that combined FeNi LDH and electric conducting graphene as a highly efficient electrocatalyst to enhance OER due to reducing aggregation [28,29]. Therefore, it is an effective method to introduce two-dimensional materials to enhance conductivity and increase restricted active sites of FeNi LDH. As two-dimensional materials with a large specific surface area and high electrical conductivity [30], MXene has been extensively used in electrocatalyst applications in recent year [31\u201334]. In the MXene family, V2CTx has various oxidation states of vanadium ion, so that the V surface layer may produce pseudocapacitive behavior [35], thus promoting the charge transfer between adsorbent and V2CTx carrier. The previous work of our group has proved that the combination of V2CTx and FeNi LDH can enhance the conductivity of FeNi LDH, reduce agglomeration phenomenon, and has excellent ORR and OER, which can be applied to a zinc\u2013air battery [36]. To further explore and enhance the electrocatalytic performance of FeNi LDH, FeNi LDH/ V2CTx was grown on NF to form a self-supporting electrode for efficient water splitting. In this work, FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF self-supporting electrode was obtained via onestep hydrothermal deposition of FeNi LDH nanosheets on V2CTx/NF substrate. Then, the properties of HER, OER and overall water splitting of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF were systematically studied. Lastly, the electrocatalytic mechanism of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF was explored by the density functional theory method."

Preparation of V2CTx/NF NFs (1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 0.1 cm3) were pretreated with concentrated HCl (3 M) for 0.5 h, and subsequently washed with acetone absolute ethanol and DI water. After that, NFs (1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 0.1 cm3) were placed in 20 mL MXene suspension for 1 h. MXene is firmly adsorbed on the surface of NF by electrostatic adsorption, and V2CTx/NF is prepared. After repeated washing with Ar de-aerated DI water, vacuum drying for later use.\n2.2.3. Preparation of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF\nFeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF was synthesized by the hydrothermal method. 100 mM urea, 5 mM Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O and 15 mM Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O were dissolved in 5 mL of DI water, stirring for 0.5 h to form a mixed solution (named solution A). 25 mL NMP was added to solution A and continued to stir for 0.5 h (named solution B). Then, V2CTx/NFs\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2640 3 of 15\n(1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 0.1 cm3) were placed in solution B and heated for 12 h at 120 \u25e6C. For comparison, FeNi LDH/NF, V2CTx/NF and Ni(OH)2 V2CTx/NF was synthesized with the same process. The load of electrocatalyst was measured by weighing the NF electrode before and after electrocatalyst growth. In this report, for FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF, the electrocatalyst load was about 5 mg cm\u22122.\n2.2.4. Preparation of RuO2/NF and Pt/C/NF\nThe RuO2 (10 mg) was dispersed ultrasonically in a mixture of isopropanol (750 \u00b5L), Nafion (16 \u00b5L, 5.0 wt%) and deionized water (250 \u00b5L). The suspension was ultrasonic for 30min to obtain an evenly dispersed ink solution. Then, 500 \u00b5L of electrocatalyst ink was loaded on 1 \u00d7 1 cm2 NF and the electrocatalyst load is about 5 mg cm\u22122. The process for preparing Pt/C/NF is the same, except that commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) is used instead of commercial RuO2."

            "text": "The synthesis scheme of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF is shown in Figure 1a. First, the Al layer of massive V2AlC powder was removed by 40 wt% HF selective etching to prepare multilayer V2CTx. After TPAOH intercalation and ultrasonic dissection, V2CTx nanosheets with fewer layers and higher surface functional groups (\u2212F, \u2212OH) were obtained, which was beneficial to electrostatic adsorption on nickel foam and the nucleation and anchoring of FeNi LDH on V2CTx surface. Then, NF was immersed in V2CTx nanosheet suspension to obtain a V2CTx/NF electrode. After that, FeNi LDH nanosheets were hydrothermally deposited on V2CTx/NF substrate to obtain FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF self-supported electrode. The XRD patterns of V2AlC and few-layer V2CTx are illustrated in Figure 1b. The peaks of 41.3\u25e6and 13.5\u25e6 correspond with the (103) and (002) crystal planes of V2AlC, respectively (PDF#29\u22120101). The peaks at 41.3\u25e6and 13.5\u25e6 disappear completely for the exfoliated few-layer V2CTx, and the characteristic peak (002) is reduced to 6.74\u25e6, indicating that the Al atoms of few-layer V2CTx are completely removed, and the C-lattice parameters increase [33,43,44]. In addition, the full and magnification XRD of the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF peeled off the nickel foam are shown in Figure S1 and Figure 1c. The peaks of 2\u03b8 = 44.5\u25e6, 51.9\u25e6 and 76.37\u25e6 correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Ni (PDF#04-0850). As shown in Figure 1c, the peaks at 2\u03b8 = 7.28\u25e6 coincided very well with (002) crystal planes of V2CTx, while the peaks at 2\u03b8 = 11.41\u25e6, 22.974\u25e6, 34.425\u25e6, and 61.254\u25e6 were in good agreement with the (003), (006), (012) and (113) of the FeNi LDH (PDF#40-0215), respectively; these results showed that FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF had been successfully prepared. The pristine V2AlC powders present bulk-like shapes (Figure S2) and unintercalated V2CTx exhibits an accordion-like morphology (Figure 1d and Figure S3). V2CTx nanosheets with a size of 200\u2013300 nm and many edge defects were obtained by further intercalation and ultrasonic exfoliation of TPAOH (Figure 1e). As shown in Figure S4, the clear Tyndall effect in the supernatant illustrates the uniformly dispersed layers of V2CTx. Because of the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged NF substrate and the negatively charged V2CTx surface, V2CTx is able to anchor to the 3D NF structure, with silver NF turning into black NF (Figure S5). The low magnification SEM image of the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF sample can be seen in Figure 1g and the corresponding high magnification SEM image is shown in Figure 1h. The thickness of FeNi LDH nanosheets is about 8.03 nm (Figure S6). FeNi LDH is evenly distributed over the surface of the V2CTx/NF substrate. As a comparison, FeNi LDH was grown directly on NF without V2CTx attached. It can be seen that FeNi LDH are clustered together (Figure 1f). The elemental mapping displays the welldistributed Fe, Ni, C and V elements in the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF (Figure S7); moreover, the TEM image of peeling FeNi LDH/V2CTx from nickel foam (Figure 1i) indicates loose flake texture grows on the surface of V2CTx with fewer layers and Figure 1j shows the interplanar spacing of 0.23 nm and 0.25 nm corresponding to (015) of FeNi LDH and the (100) of V2CTx, respectively. There are multiple diffraction rings on the (110) and (100) planes of V2CTx and the (015) plane of FeNi LDH in the regional electron diffraction image selected in Figure 1j. The even distribution of V, Ni, Fe, O and C in the FeNi LDH/V2CTx nanohybrid is observed in Figure 1k.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2640 5 of 15a o aterials 2022, 12, 2640 5 of 15\nFigure 1.

In the Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 2b), the two characteristic peaks of 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbits of Ni2+ are located at 874.38 eV and 856.59 eV, respectively [45].

The overpotential of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 is 151 mV (\u03b710 = 151 mV), which is smaller than that of FeNi LDH/NF (\u03b710 = 198 mV), Ni(OH)2 LDH/V2CTx/NF (\u03b710 = 214 mV), V2CTx/NF (\u03b710 = 252 mV) and NF (\u03b710 = 305 mV), except for Pt/C/NF (\u03b710 = 81 mV) (Figure 4a). As seen from Figure 4b, FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrocatalyst achieves a current density of 50 mA cm\u22122 with the lowest overpotential of 274 mV; moreover, the Tafel slope of the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF was 136 mV/dec, which was lower than that of FeNi LDH/NF (148 mV dec\u22121), Ni(OH)2 LDH/V2CTx/NF (152 mV dec\u22121) and V2CTx/NF (173 mV dec\u22121) (Figure 4c), further confirmed the internal reaction kinetics of the prepared FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF significantly accelerated. EIS was tested at \u22121.0 V (vs. RHE). The results (Figure 4d and Table S3) showed that FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF had the lowest Rct (Rct = 10.85 \u03a9) of all electrocatalysts, indicating good reaction kinetics and faster charge transfer. The CV curves were obtained between 0.123 to 0.223 V (vs RHE) to estimate the ECSA of all electrocatalysts (Figure S13). FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF measured much higher Cdl (0.88 mF cm\u22122) than FeNi LDH/NF (0.83 mF cm\u22122), Ni(OH)2 LDH/V2CTx/NF (0.84 mF cm\u22122), V2CTx/NF (0.77 mF cm\u22122) and NF (0.56 mF cm\u22122) (Figure 4e).

Besides, Figure S15 shows the XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Fe 2p and V 2p in the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF before and after the durability test. No significant changes were observed, indicating high electrochemical stability.\nFigure 3. OER performances of prepared electrocatalysts. (a) LSV curves. (b) The overpotential of electrocatalysts.

(f) Stability measurements of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF.\nFigure 3d shows the elliptic semicircle of the EIS diagram, in which the sharp reduction of the semicircle diameter in the high-frequency region demonstrates the acceleration of charge transfer. The FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrocatalyst has the lowest charge transfer impedance (Rct = 3.614 \u2126) than that of Ni(OH)2/V2CTx/NF (Rct = 42.270 \u2126) and FeNi LDH/NF (Rct = 4.275 \u2126) electrocatalyst according to Table S2. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) were estimated from the Cdl by cyclic voltammetry at 1.02\u20131.10 V (vs. RHE), as it is linear with ECSA (Figure S10). As shown in Figure 3e, the Cdl value of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF is 8.09 mF cm\u22122, which is larger than those of FeNi LDH/NF (7.28 mF cm\u22122), Ni(OH)2/V2CTx/NF (4.8 mF cm\u22122) and V2CTx/NF (3.79 mF cm\u22122). Figure 3f shows the stability measurements of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF for \u03b7 = 10 mA cm\u22122 at 0.222 V. The current density of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF did not decrease significantly after 10 h. After a 10h OER test, the morphology of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2640 8 of 15\nhas not changed significantly (Figure S11), which further confirms its high stability. In addition, XPS measurements of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF were performed (Figure S12). From the high-resolution Ni 2p spectra and Fe 2p spectra (Figure S11a,b), it can be seen that the characteristic peaks of both Ni 2p and Fe 2p have a slight rise. The former indicates that Ni2+ is oxidized to Ni3+, and the latter indicates that Fe is also partially oxidized, which is beneficial to accelerate the redox activity in the OER process; moreover, the two peaks of the V 2p spectrum (Figure S11c) are still located at 516.91 eV (V 2p3/2) and 524.25 eV (V 2p1/2), corresponding to the V4+ state, indicating its good stability during the OER. To further explore the HER activity, FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF with 1 \u00d7 1 cm2 was served as the working electrode, while Pt plate, Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) and 1 M KOH were used as the counter electrode, reference electrode and electrolyte, respectively.

As seen from Figure 4b, FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrocatalyst achieves a current density of 50 mA cm\u22122 with the lowest overpotential of 274 mV; moreover, the Tafel slope of the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF was 136 mV/dec, which was lower than that of FeNi LDH/NF (148 mV dec\u22121), Ni(OH)2 LDH/V2CTx/NF (152 mV dec\u22121) and V2CTx/NF (173 mV dec\u22121) (Figure 4c), further confirmed the internal reaction kinetics of the prepared FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF significantly accelerated.

(e) Cdl of samples. (f) Stability measurements of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF.\nBased on the results, the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrode can be used as a robust and efficient electrocatalyst for OER and HER. Therefore, the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrode was used as both cathode and anode in 1.0 M KOH for overall water splitting. It can be seen from Figure 5a that when the current density is 50 mA cm\u22122, it is easy to achieve a voltage of 1.74 V (\u03b750 = 1.74V), which is small than FeNi LDH/NF (\u03b750 = 1.81 V), Ni(OH)2 LDH/V2CTx/NF (\u03b750 = 1.87 V) and V2CTx/NF (\u03b750 = 1.92 V) (Figure 5b); moreover, FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF has a superiority compared with other electrocatalysts prepared by the one-step hydrothermal method in the literature (Table S4), such as NiFe LDH/NiCoP/NF (1.75 V) [14], NiCo2S4@NiFe-LDH/NF (1.83 V) [51] and NiCo-LDH/NF (1.86 V) [52]. As can be seen from the LSV curve before and after 24 h of the overall water splitting test (Figure 5c), the performance of the electrocatalyst is relatively stable and the overpotential changes little at 10 mA cm\u22122. Besides, the overall water splitting can be continued for 24 h steadily at 50 mA cm\u22122 (Figure 5d) and the O2 and H2 bubbles can be clearly observed (the inset of Figure 5d).\nFigure 4.

(f) Stability measurements of FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF.\nEIS was tested at \u22121.0 V (vs. RHE). The results (Figure 4d and Table S3) showed that FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF had the lowest Rct (Rct = 10.85 \u2126) of all electrocatalysts, indicating good reaction kinetics and faster charge transfer. The CV curves were obtained between 0.123 to 0.223 V (vs RHE) to estimate the ECSA of all electrocatalysts (Figure S13). FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF measured much higher Cdl (0.88 mF cm\u22122) than FeNi LDH/NF (0.83 mF cm\u22122), Ni(OH)2 LDH/V2CTx/NF (0.84 mF cm\u22122), V2CTx/NF (0.77 mF cm\u22122) and NF (0.56 mF cm\u22122) (Figure 4e). As shown in Figure 4f, the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2640 9 of 15\nelectrocatalyst maintained excellent catalytic performance and showed better durability in alkaline solution after a 10 h cycling test at \u221210 mA cm\u22122. As seen in Figure S14, the morphology of the electrocatalyst was well maintained after HER testing, indicating its good mechanical stability. Besides, Figure S15 shows the XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Fe 2p and V 2p in the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF before and after the durability test. No significant changes were observed, indicating high electrochemical stability. Based on the results, the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrode can be used as a robust and efficient electrocatalyst for OER and HER. Therefore, the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrode was used as both cathode and anode in 1.0 M KOH for overall water splitting. It can be seen from Figure 5a that when the current density is 50 mA cm\u22122, it is easy to achieve a voltage of 1.74 V (\u03b750 = 1.74V), which is small than FeNi LDH/NF (\u03b750 = 1.81 V), Ni(OH)2 LDH/V2CTx/NF (\u03b750 = 1.87 V) and V2CTx/NF (\u03b750 = 1.92 V) (Figure 5b); moreover, FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF has a superiority compared with other electrocatalysts prepared by the one-step hydrothermal method in the literature (Table S4), such as NiFe LDH/NiCoP/NF (1.75 V) [14], NiCo2S4@NiFe-LDH/NF (1.83 V) [51] and NiCo-LDH/NF (1.86 V) [52].

The presence of V2CTx promoted the dispersed growth of FeNi LDH nanosheets onto V2CTx/NF working electrode and reduced the obstacle of electron transfer. The NF scaffold provides a highly exposed active surface and facilitates the electrolyte infiltration and gas dissipation\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2640 12 of 15\nduring OER.
