            "text": "Background: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), lacking targeted therapies, demands relevant animal models to enhance the understanding of the disease. While rodents are essential, G\u00f6ttingen minipigs, resembling human cardiovascular and metabolic features more closely, present a unique opportunity. Current porcine models have limitations, and Sharp et al.'s innovative approach using G\u00f6ttingen minipigs with a Western diet and DOCA-salt stress highlights the urgency of refining animal models to advance HFpEF research.\nMethods: Myocardial tissues, obtained from right ventricular septum biopsies from human patients, mice, rats, and miniature pigs with HFpEF and non-failing donor controls were analyzed by Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) and Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry techniques, with\nsubsequent quality control and data cleaning utilizing LFQ analyst (after cleaning, for each condition, n=\n10 for human and n=3 for each animal) and ReactomeGSA for statistical analysis.\nResults: DDA-MS proteomics identified significantly upregulated or downregulated proteins and pathways for humans and each animal. Reactome enrichment in human HFpEF highlighted immune system and signal transduction upregulated pathways, while downregulated pathways were related to general metabolism and RNA metabolism, including the EIF2AK4 response to amino acid deficiency. For the three animal models, the differentially expressed genes in HFpEF vs. control contributed to only significant downregulations of some pathways and no upregulations. Downregulated pathways in mice HFpEF included cellular responses to amino acid deficiency and protein metabolism. Downregulated pathways in ZSF1 were associated with metabolism, protein folding, neuronal system, vesicle-mediated transport, and organelle biogenesis. Downregulated pathways in Gottingen Pigs were exclusively related to metabolism. Comparative analysis of regulated pathways revealed distinctions between human and animal models. While immune response and EPH/EPHB-mediated signaling pathways were unique to human HFpEF, HFD-LNAME mice closely mirrored human downregulated pathways in the metabolism of RNAs and proteins. ZSF1 rats and Gottingen pigs shared downregulated pathways related to the TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport chain with human HFpEF.\nConclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of myocardial proteomics in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) across humans, mice, rats, and miniature pigs. The HFDLNAME mouse model shows promise, mirroring specific facets of human HFpEF. ZSF1 rats and Gottingen pigs demonstrate potential in capturing certain aspects of human HFpEF, but challenges like\ninbred strain issues and limited protein annotations require consideration. While no single animal model replicates human HFpEF entirely, shared pathways offer promise for translational research. Future efforts should refine models, increase sample sizes, and explore additional species to comprehensively capture human HFpEF diversity.\nMeSH Keywords: human, animal model, myocardium, proteomics, heart disease, molecular medicine"

            "text": "Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has emerged as a prevalent clinical syndrome affecting more than half of global HF patients, posing significant morbidity and mortality challenges. Unlike HF with reduced ejection fraction, HFpEF lacks specific targeted therapies, underscoring the need for comprehensive investigations to unravel its complexities. Initially recognized in the 1970s in patients with ischemic heart disease and normal ejection fraction, HFpEF has evolved to be associated with hypertensive, hypertrophic heart disease, primarily linked to diastolic dysfunction. Preclinical models, notably in rats and mice, have traditionally utilized hypertension as a primary pathobiological trigger, inducing adaptive concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction.\nWhile these models have contributed valuable insights into hypertrophic, hypertensive heart\ndisease, HFpEF's clinical spectrum extends beyond these parameters. Human studies have revealed additional facets, such as abnormal cardiac vascular stiffening, chronotropic incompetence, pulmonary hypertension, renal disease, and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Notably, the intersection of HFpEF with the obesity and metabolic syndrome pandemic has transformed its landscape. Presently, HFpEF patients commonly exhibit marked visceral adiposity, high obesity levels, insulin resistance, and often diabetes. The prevalence of obesity in HFpEF patients underscores the significance of incorporating this major feature into preclinical models.\nThis paper delves into a comparative analysis of myocardium from animal models for HFpEF that\nintegrate obesity and metabolic syndrome as features. In particular, we explore the integration of obesity into HFpEF models and its impact on cardiac and multiorgan dysfunction.\nThe coexistence of animal models for obesity, hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy has\nbeen a longstanding practice, with rats, mice, and larger mammals, notably pigs, serving as key subjects. While rodent models remain integral, pigs, resembling humans more closely in cardiovascular and metabolic features, provide a unique perspective. However, existing porcine models have not fully replicated HFpEF in humans, lacking exertional disability and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures.\nAddressing this gap, Sharp et al. present a novel variation using G\u00f6ttingen minipigs subjected to\na Western diet and DOCA-salt pressure/volume stress. This model exhibits dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, marked hypertension, ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic pressure elevation, fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction\u2014mirroring several aspects of human HFpEF. Despite commendable contributions, the study has limitations, including the rarity of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy observed in HFpEF patients, the small sample size, and the absence of certain clinical features.\nAs the scientific community grapples with the challenge of creating relevant HFpEF models,\nefforts like those by Sharp et al. mark crucial steps forward. The paper discusses the molecular strengths\nand limitations of rodent and minipig HFpEF models, highlighting the need for ongoing refinement. In parallel, advancements in molecular and cellular data from human studies provide a backdrop for robustly evaluating preclinical models and determining their fidelity to human HFpEF. Ultimately, this pursuit aligns with the urgency of addressing HFpEF as a major unmet medical need, leveraging interdisciplinary insights to propel the field toward effective therapeutic interventions."

Files were searched using Fragpipe with label-free quantitation match-between-runs (DDA) and DIA_Speclib_Quant (DIA) presets. Identified proteins were based on peptides comprised of amino acid sequences unique to a protein, isoform identification was based on an isoform-specific peptide. DIA data were searched with OpenSWATH, in which at least 3 transitions were required to quantify a peptide sequence and at least 1 peptide sequence to quantify a protein. The searched proteomics data was filtered, removing proteins with \u226550% of values lower than the limit of quantitation in any group (controls, HFpEF). This affected 31 proteins from the DDA dataset and 1179 proteins in the DIA dataset. In the DIA dataset, 2 patients had principal components > 4 standard deviations from the mean and were excluded, leaving a total of 44 HFpEF patients. DDA outputs were median normalized and processed with LFQAnalyst18 using their standard pipeline which consists of the removal of reverse and potential contaminant sequences, removal of proteins only \u201cidentified by site\u201d, and removal of proteins quantified by a single razor or unique peptide. DIA outputs were median normalized, batch-corrected with comBat, and processed as described previously19. Missing data were imputed using MissForest (missingpy 1.1.3) in Python (ver 3.5). In both datasets, imputed data were log-transformed for normalization. Proteins annotated as red blood cell compartments by Gene Ontology were excluded (n=17). Raw intensity data were downloaded and processed identically as the DDA HFpEF data acquired, including median normalization and processing with LFQAnalyst18, imputation with MissForest, and log-transformation of imputed data.\nStatistical Analysis:\nDifferential protein expression analysis was performed using LFQ analyst for all animal models,\nand P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Proteins were considered significantly different if the adjusted P value was <0.05.\nThe raw spectral counts of all species are also inputted into the R package ReactomeGSA for\nmulti-species pathway comparison.

            "text": "The current study provides a comprehensive analysis of myocardial proteomics in HFpEF across multiple species, including humans, mice, rats, and miniature pigs. The investigation into human HFpEF reveals a distinct proteomic signature characterized by dysregulation in immune response, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways. Notably, the enrichment of pathways related to phagocytic activities in the immune system, signal transduction, and downregulated pathways associated with general metabolism highlights the intricate molecular landscape in human HFpEF. These findings align with the clinical features observed in HFpEF patients, including obesity and metabolic syndrome.\nThe study extends its scope to animal models, recognizing the importance of integrating obesity\nand metabolic syndrome into HFpEF models. The comparison across rodents (mice and rats) and larger mammals (pigs) provides valuable insights into the molecular similarities and differences between human and animal HFpEF.\nThe proteomic analysis of HFDLNAME mice with HFpEF reveals similarities to human HFpEF,\nparticularly in the downregulation of pathways related to cellular response to amino acid deficiency, mitochondrial proteins, and the translational machinery. This alignment underscores the potential of HFDLNAME mice as a relevant model for studying specific aspects of human HFpEF.\nThe proteomic signatures in ZSF1 rats demonstrate downregulation in pathways related to\nmetabolism, neuronal system, and vesicle-mediated transport. However, the limited number of\ndifferentially expressed proteins in this model raises questions about its fidelity to the human HFpEF proteomic profile. This may be due to the fact that mouse models operate on an inbred strain which is not the case with the rat and pig models. This creates greater heterogeneity and potentially necessitates a greater sample size.\nThe proteomic analysis of Gottingen pigs with HFpEF showcases downregulation in pathways\nassociated with metabolism, mirroring findings in humans. The higher log fold change and significant pvalues in the TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport chain pathways suggest that Gottingen pigs may better capture certain aspects of human HFpEF compared to ZSF1 rats. However, there are still less differentially abundant proteins when compared to mice. This may be due to the inbred strain issues mentioned above. Additionally, protein annotations for pigs are much less in number than for mice (~5000 vs ~20,000 respectively). This may cause issues when compared to human data.\nThe comparative analysis highlights both commonalities and disparities in the proteomic\nsignatures across species. While none of the animal models completely replicate the signaling pathways observed in human HFpEF, certain pathways are shared. HFDLNAME mice demonstrate a closer resemblance to human HFpEF in terms of downregulated pathways related to protein and RNA metabolism. Gottingen pigs exhibit similarities in the downregulation of the TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport chain pathways.\nThe study acknowledges limitations, including small sample sizes in some animal models and the\nabsence of specific clinical features in certain models. Future studies should focus on refining these models, addressing model-specific limitations, and exploring additional animal species to comprehensively capture the diversity of human HFpEF. The sample size should be substantially increased to account for the heterogeneity in pig and rat models.\nUnderstanding the proteomic signatures in HFpEF across species lays the groundwork for\ndeveloping more clinically relevant animal models. The identification of shared pathways facilitates the selection of models that closely mirror specific molecular aspects of human HFpEF. Ultimately, this knowledge enhances the translational potential of preclinical studies, offering a bridge between basic research and clinical interventions in the pursuit of effective therapies for HFpEF.\nFIGURES\nEnrichment of the top 20 differentially regulated (p.adj < 0.05) Reactome Pathways in ZSF1 Rat.
