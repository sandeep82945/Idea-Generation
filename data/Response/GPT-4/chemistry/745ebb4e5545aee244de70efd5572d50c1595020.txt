Exploration of Other Proteolytic Enzymes for Lysozyme Modification: Investigate the effects of modifying lysozyme with other proteolytic enzymes beyond pepsin and trypsin, such as chymotrypsin or papain, to evaluate if they can produce biopeptides with distinct or enhanced antibacterial, antioxidative, and physicochemical properties. This could help in tailoring lysozyme modifications for specific industrial applications.

Mechanistic Studies of Biopeptide Activity: Conduct in-depth studies to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the increased antibacterial and antioxidative activities observed in the modified lysozyme preparations. This could involve structural analysis of the biopeptides, identification of active sites, and their interactions with microbial cell walls or oxidative agents.

Application in Food Preservation and Safety: Apply the modified lysozyme preparations in real food systems to assess their effectiveness in prolonging shelf life and ensuring safety against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. This could include testing in dairy, meat, and plant-based products to evaluate the impact on sensory properties and consumer acceptability.

Development of Pharmaceutical and Cosmetic Formulations: Explore the use of modified lysozyme biopeptides in pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of infections and diseases, as well as in cosmetic products for skin care, given their high antibacterial activity and good antioxidative properties. This could involve the development of topical creams, ointments, or oral therapeutic agents.

Scale-Up and Optimization of Enzymatic Modification Processes: Perform studies aimed at scaling up the enzymatic modification process of lysozyme to evaluate the feasibility of industrial-scale production. This would include optimizing reaction conditions, enzyme concentrations, and processing parameters to maximize yield, potency, and stability of the biopeptide preparations while minimizing costs.
