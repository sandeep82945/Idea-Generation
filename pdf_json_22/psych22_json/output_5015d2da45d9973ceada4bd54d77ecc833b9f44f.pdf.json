    "abstractText": "Measuring the quality of information delivered to patients with severe mental illness (SMI), i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and major depressive disorders, is essential to improve their quality of care. In this work, we described the different steps of the validation of the PREMIUM computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for measuring the quality of information delivered to patients with SMI. The PREMIUM item bank regarding information included 25 items. A total of 499 patients with schizophrenia (53%), bipolar disorders (26%), and major depressive disorders (22%) were recruited from numerous inand outpatient settings in France. Unidimensionality, local independence, and monotonicity were verified for 19 items of the item bank. The psychometric properties were satisfactory for both internal (RMSEA = 0.069, CFI = 0.969, TLI = 0.963) and external validity (in particular, significant associations were found with age, educational level, and social functioning). The CAT exhibited satisfactory accuracy and precision (standard error of measurement <0.55 and root mean square error <0.3), with an average administration of eight items. This CAT may be used by healthcare professionals in psychiatric settings to accurately assess the patients\u2019 experience with information.",

Previous studies have reported substantial unmet information needs in patients with SMI [5,6]. For example, the need for information has been reported by more than half of patients with schizophrenia in a recent Brazilian study [7]. Sharing information is particularly challenging in patients with SMI because the nature of mental illness is often difficult to explain, and the treatment options and prognosis may vary considerably [8]. Yet, obtaining information about illness, available treatment and care options, prognosis, are strategies for self-management is an essential issue regarding the quality of care because it can affect the process of shared decision making (i.e., \u201ca decision support model allowing information sharing between doctors and patients concerning different care options and taking into account patient preferences\u201d) [9,10] and treatment adherence [11], leading to improved prognosis, including the patients\u2019 quality of life [8]. Poor adherence to treatment may be partly explained by a patient\u2019s belief that the effect of medications is harmful or that medications are unnecessary [12]. It is therefore essential to provide understandable and appropriate information to patients to improve their treatment adherence [13], which remains a major public health problem. Measuring the quality of information delivered to patients with SMI is an essential step to improve communication strategies for patients with SMI, as well as their quality of\nJ. Clin.

The French group Patient-Reported Experience Measure for Improving qUality of care in Mental health (PREMIUM) has developed computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for seven domains of quality of care experienced by patients with SMI [14,15]: interpersonal relationships, care environment, drug therapy, access and care coordination, respect and dignity, psychological care, and information. The patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) developed by PREMIUM are expected to optimize measurement precision, to reduce the length of the questionnaire and completion time, and to improve the relevance and the acceptability of these questionnaires in psychiatric settings [16]. In this work, we described the different steps that led to the validation of the PREMIUM CAT for measuring the quality of information delivered to patients with SMI."

            "text": "Descriptive statistics of the sample included frequencies and percentages of categorical variables and the means and standard deviations of continuous variables. All the items of the PREMIUM item bank regarding information were analyzed using descriptive indicators to select the high performing items. The item response theory (IRT) assumptions were assessed [21]: unidimensionality using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) or exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by bifactor structure (i.e., one general factor and several group factors), local independence using residual correlations from the CFA model, and monotonicity using visual inspection of characteristic item curves. The generalized partial credit model (GPCM) was used to calibrate the responses to the items [22] after having verified its superiority over other models, such as the partial credit model (PCM) [23]. Item parameters (discrimination and thresholds) were estimated using the maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE)\nand the expectation\u2013maximization (EM) algorithm [24], and then the model fit to the data was evaluated. Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses were performed using ordinal logistic regression models [25,26] according to sex (male vs. female), age (median split: patients 40 years or younger vs. patients older than 40 years), care setting (outpatient vs. inpatient), and psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorders vs. major depressive disorders). Latent trait scores (\u03b8) were estimated by Bayesian expected a posteriori (EAP) estimation [27]. Then, a linear transformation was performed to obtain \u03b8 scores ranging from 0 to 100 (the higher the score was, the better the experience regarding information received). All the indicators of psychometric performance are presented in Supplementary Table S1 [28\u201345]. Convergent validity was investigated by examining the relationships between item bank scores and psychosocial functioning (GAF), quality of life (SF-12), and satisfaction (overall satisfaction item and VAS). Discriminant validity was investigated by comparing the mean scores of the item bank scores, according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, using t tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients. Finally, we developed the item administration algorithm of the CAT. The starting item was the most informative item based on the maximum Fisher information (MFI) criterion [46]. The CAT algorithm then selected the next item with the highest information for the current \u03b8 estimate. The CAT algorithm ended when the stopping rule based on the standard error of measurement (SEM) was reached (acceptable range between 0.33 to 0.55 [47]). Three scenarios with different stopping rules corresponding to SEM values of 0.33, 0.44, and 0.55 were simulated and compared to select the best adaptive administration algorithm. The indicators used to assess the performance of the results at each stage of the statistical analyses are provided in Supplementary Table S1 [28\u201345]. All of the statistical analyses were performed using the following software: IBM PASW SPSS version 20.0 [48], MPlus version 7.0 [49], and R version 4.0.5 [50], using packages \u201cmirt\u201d [51], \u201clordif\u201d [52], \u201cBifactorIndicesCalculator\u201d, [53] and \u201cmirtCAT\u201d [54]."

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated the validity of the PREMIUM-CAT for measuring the quality of information delivered to patients with SMI. This CAT presents interesting characteristics for widespread use in psychiatric settings. The PREMIUM item bank has been developed based on a literature review and patient interviews, ensuring its content validity [15,55]. Similar to a previous study on information needs in mental health [56], the PREMIUM item bank regarding information explores a broad facet of the information delivered to patients, including: basic facts (e.g., diagnosis, symptoms, etc.), treatment (e.g., side effects, etc.), coping (e.g., lifestyle advice, etc.), medical systems (e.g., possibility of accessing medical file, etc.), social aids, professional accommodations, and peer support. The basic facts are the information needs most frequently reported in the literature in contrast to self-help and peer support [56]. These findings are corroborated by our study in which the item regarding the course of care (I13) was the most informative of the bank, while the item on social aids (I20) was the least informative of the bank. Measurement invariance was demonstrated by the few indications of negligible magnitude DIF, which implies that the psychometric properties of the items are invariant across gender, age, care setting, and diagnosis, and that the item bank scores can be compared between respondents, regardless of their characteristics. The different sampling strategies may also have impacted participants\u2019 information experience at different levels. Response bias is known to affect self-reported data, leading to results biased in a positive direction, as in traditional satisfaction surveys [57]. Participants recruited from healthcare facilities are more likely to provide biased responses due to concerns about the impact on their care and relationships with the healthcare team. Participants recruited from healthcare were invited to participate in the study by a psychologist external to the healthcare team in order to limit this bias. However, the scores were significantly higher for participants from the healthcare facilities than for participants from the online survey. External validity, explored by the use of socio-demographic characteristics and established psychiatric and functioning measures, globally confirmed our assumptions. In particular, we confirmed that information experience was slightly and positively correlated to quality of life, which has been shown in other chronic severe illnesses, such as cancer [58]. Conversely, our results showed no statistical difference in information experience according to psychosocial functioning, even though most participants had poor psychosocial functioning. Our results also showed that participants with high educational level and young age reported a poorer information experience. Patients\u2019 preference about information may vary according to age and education [59]. Health literacy and internet use may also explain these results, in part [60\u201363]. Innovative information strategies could be implemented in novel digital adherence-assessment devices [64] and telemedicine interventions [65]. Finally, the item\nbank offers better precision and accuracy measurement over the [\u22122;2] range of theta values, while reducing response burden on participants, with an average of 8 items administered. The analysis of the item scores has yielded three points of information that should be targeted with high priority. First, participants reported poor information experience on the right to access her/his medical file. All physicians are informed during their training of the 2003 Kouchner Law obliging institutions to provide medical records within 8 days to any patient on demand. The reasons for this poorer experience should be explored in future studies. However, it seems necessary to reinforce the information of this right to all patients, perhaps by automatic mailing or phone texting, for instance. Second, participants reported poor information experience regarding social aids and professional accommodations. This information is not directly related to medical care, but rather to medico-social/social/rehabilitation care and occupational medicine. Poor access to medicosocial and social care and lack of knowledge regarding these services may explain why patients report poorer information experience regarding this information. All patients could be delivered systematic written information regarding social aids and professional accommodations when receiving her/his first diagnosis. Third, participants reported poorer information experience regarding associations or programs aimed at helping patients. This poor experience may be due to a lack of knowledge. Physicians are themselves poorly informed about all associations, programs, and initiatives concerning all mental illnesses. This information also may vary across time and geographical areas. Caregivers may also estimate that their role is limited to medical care. Future qualitative studies should explore the reasons obehind this poorer experience and how to address this issue."

The systematic and continuous collection of PREMs through a digital platform has great potential to inform quality improvement actions in mental health care [66]. However, the CAT version requires an appropriate information technology (IT) infrastructure to collect data, at the hospital and/or at home, requiring that patients have internet access. Future dissemination and implementation work will need to determine the feasibility of such a device for routine use and its effectiveness in meeting specific research or clinical needs."

            "text": "Our sample size is large compared to traditional psychiatric studies, but may be limited in the field of psychometric studies. However, our sample size was sufficient, since sample size requirements recommend approximately 500 observations for accurate parameter estimates with multiparameter models (e.g., GPCM) [67,68]. In addition, the sample included a diverse patient population, both inpatient and outpatient, from several facilities in different geographic regions of the country. Future work with a larger and more diverse sample will allow for additional psychometric testing to develop a better understanding of the metric properties, but also to examine the generalizability of this item bank to other populations, such as patients with common mental disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders). Second, in this study, as in previous PREMIUM studies [12,69], we used the GPCM, which showed an adequate fit to the data and whose fit can be compared to the PCM because these are nested models. The graded response model (GRM), which tends to provide similar results, could have been an alternative (e.g., in case of non-convergence) [70]. Third, criterion validity could not be assessed because, to the best of our knowledge, no gold standard was available. In addition, given the cross-sectional study design, responsiveness could not be studied. Fourth, CAT precision depends on the quality of the related item bank, which showed the highest measurement precision in the [\u22122;2] range of theta values. Future studies should evaluate whether additional items are needed to cover the ends of the latent continuum. Fifth, we did not evaluate health literacy, which may have influenced information experience [71]. Likewise, symptom severity was not measured\nusing psychiatric scales (e.g., PANSS, MADRS, YMRS) due to diagnostic heterogeneity and different recruitment strategies that did not allow for hetero-assessment. By using the GAF, which provides an approximate measure of the severity of these symptoms, we examined the impact of the severity of mental illness on the information experience. Future studies should address these questions. Finally, the precision and accuracy of the CAT should be re-evaluated in an independent sample and under real-world conditions to assess whether the responses may be affected by other factors [72]."
