    "abstractText": "Purpose \u2013 Sleep disturbance is a common difficulty in the general population. It has become particularly prevalent in the context of disruption to routine brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to trial a patient-guided \u201csleep workbook\u201d intervention, which was developed by multidisciplinary team members, combining principles of sleep hygiene education and cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia behavioural strategies, and to evaluate its efficacy in a mixed-methods study. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Service users of the community mental health service were invited to participate. A total of 30 service users agreed to participate. A total of 15 participants completed both the intervention and the mixed-methods survey. Four participated in the focus group. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed on the collected quantitative data. A thematic analysis was carried out of qualitative survey responses and focus group discourse. Findings \u2013 There was a statistically and clinically significant improvement in quantity and quality of sleep following intervention. Mean hours of sleep prior to the intervention was 4.4 hours [standard deviation (SD) = 2.2], compared to 6.1 hours (SD = 2.2) afterwards (p = 0.003). Quality of sleep improved from a mean of 2.5 (SD = 2.1) to 6.1 (SD = 2.3) following the intervention (p = <0.001). Four themes were developed using the qualitative data: \u201cunder-recognition of sleep difficulties\u201d, \u201cruminations\u201d, \u201cpractical utility\u201d and \u201ctherapeutic autonomy\u201d. Originality/value \u2013 There is a growing need for occupational therapists and clinicians to provide interventions for patients with sleep difficulties and to develop sleep management practice. This patient-guided sleep workbook may be an effective intervention for these patients.",

            "text": "Sleep in occupational therapy (OT) is conceptualised as a restorative occupation; meaning good sleep supports the formation of self-care, productivity and leisure during the day (Ho and Siu, 2018). Insomnia symptoms, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, early morning wakening and non-restorative sleep, have an annual prevalence of 35%-50% in the general population (Walsh et al., 2011). Sleep disturbance is common in the psychiatric patient population, as a symptom, consequence and contributing factor in mental illness (Freeman et al., 2020). Sleep problems have become particularly prevalent in the general population recently, in the context of disruption to routine brought about by theCOVID-19 pandemic (Franceschini et al., 2020). The American OT Association, in updating the OT practice framework in 2008, reclassified sleep to an occupational domain (Fung et al., 2013). Meyer (1977), as cited in Green (2008), recognised sleep as one of the Big Four factors individuals should balance for the maintenance of health. Despite this, sleep has a limited profile in OT. Many authors\nnote the paucity of research in the area of sleep and OT (Ho and Siu, 2018; Green, 2008; Fung et al., 2013). Pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods are used to manage sleep difficulties. The most commonly used nonpharmacological method is sleep hygiene education (Sivertsen\nThe current issue and full text archive of this journal is available onEmerald Insight at: https://www.emerald.com/insight/2398-8819.htm\nIrish Journal of Occupational Therapy 50/1 (2022) 36\u201341 Emerald Publishing Limited [ISSN 2398-8819] [DOI 10.1108/IJOT-09-2021-0021]\n\u00a9 Rebecca Conlan-Trant, Paula Connolly, Alison O\u2019Sullivan, Anurag Nasa, Mary Sammon and Lauren Alexander.

While improving individual behaviours is shown to improve sleep, there is inconsistent evidence supporting sleep hygiene education as an effective monotherapy (Morgenthaler et al., 2006). Other non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) \u2013 a treatment that augments sleep hygiene with a behavioural strategy \u2013 have been shown to be more effective (Qaseem et al., 2016). Like many community mental health teams (CMHT), this CMHT has abundant expertise but its resources are overextended delivering existing therapeutic programmes. CMHTs comprise of psychiatrists, nurses, psychologists, OTs and social workers. Most CMHT members can offer sleep hygiene education, however it is often psychologists or psychiatrists who offer CBT-I. Furthermore, CMHTs have been subject to COVID-19 restrictions, so options to combat the concurrent increase in insomnia have been limited to no-contact interventions. This pilot intervention sought to trial a patientguided \u201csleep workbook\u201d intervention, combining principles of sleep hygiene education and CBT-I behavioural strategies. Our aim was to implement this intervention and to evaluate its efficacy in amixed-methods study."

The local service user\u2019s forumwas consulted for feedback. The aim of the workbook was to improve understanding of sleep and insomnia, to develop helpful behaviours and to improve the length and quality of sleep. The workbook is a 13- page document that was given to participants. The sleep workbook is designed to engage users in an analysis of their sleep patterns and is divided into sections: Section 1 provides education: the importance of sleep,\nstages of sleep, common sleep problems, sleep hygiene, positive sleep habits and sleep diaries. Section 2 is a guide for patient-led sleep restructuring, a component of CBT-I. This process is designed to reprogramme your sleep cycle, initially by rescheduling your time in bed, and then gradually increasing your time spent in bed."

A thematic analysis of the qualitative survey responses and focus group discourse was carried out by two researchers in parallel (PC, MS). The data was anonymised through use of pseudonyms. According to Braun and Clarke (as cited in Kiger and Varpio, 2020) thematic analysis is an appropriate and powerful method to use when seeking to understand a set of experiences, thoughts, or behaviours across a data set. The sixstep framework for thematic analysis was utilised, adopting an inductive approach and a recursive process (Braun and Clarke, 2022). Both researchers initially familiarised themselves with the data. The data was coded using a coding template.

This study trialled a more advanced intervention than sleep hygiene education that can be administered within the confines of resource limitations and mandatory restrictions in face-to-face contact and explored the experience of sleep difficulties and the intervention using amixed-methods study.\nExperiencing sleep difficulties Participants suffered with considerable sleep difficulties, reporting a mean of 4.4hours sleep per night prior to the intervention. This is in keeping with previous studies, which report that people with mental health problems experience reduced sleep efficiency and total sleep time (Benca et al., 1992). Much of the distress surrounding insomnia related to excessive night-time worrying. This correlates with previous literature which notes that repetitive thought is a key component in the aetiology of sleep disturbance and stating that nearly all insomnia models now highlight worry as a precipitant of sleep disturbance (Pillai and Drake, 2015). Lichstein and Rosenthal (1980) indicate that individuals with insomnia were ten times more likely to attribute their sleep disturbance to cognitive factors than to somatic complaints. Participants in our study sought strategies to manage ruminations, using techniques from the workbook and reported finding it helpful to \u201cput a name on it\u201d. Participants described feeling that insomnia was not something they should mention to the doctor. In fact, while recognised as a common problem in the psychiatric patient population, often insomnia is seen as \u201csecondary\u201d or less important when compared to a diagnosis of a major mental illness (Harvey, 2001) and thus the management of sleep\ndisturbance is infrequently at the forefront of a clinician\u2019s mind. This is a clinically important oversight because insomnia is known to exacerbate distress inmental illness (Krystal, 2012)."

            "heading": "Attitudes towards treatment",
            "text": "Focus group participants stated they would prefer to tackle sleep difficulties with a psychotherapeutic rather than a pharmacological approach. The desire for a psychotherapeutic approach is mirrored in the American and European guidelines for the management of insomnia, which recommend pharmacological intervention is only offered if psychological interventions are ineffective or unavailable (Qaseem et al., 2016; Riemann et al., 2017). However, interestingly, prescriptions for sleep medications have increased exponentially in recent decades. (Ford et al., 2014). This discrepancy between guidelines and clinical practice may be due to a lack of availability of CBT-I (Espie et al., 2012), secondary to a lack of trained therapists and the relative expense of providing CBT-I (Griffiths et al., 2006; Perils and Smith, 2008) and highlights the necessity for resourceefficient and efficacious interventions.\nExperience of using the sleep workbook While all respondents were favourable in their feedback of the intervention, the type and extent of engagement varied between individuals. This is in keeping with the theme of \u201ctherapeutic autonomy\u201d. Stepanski andWyatt(2003) note that there may be significant individual differences among insomniacs regarding their sensitivity to violation of some sleep hygiene behaviours. Respondents in this study noted that \u201cnot one size fits all\u201d and that it involved \u201ctrial and error\u201d. Hauri (1993) also notes that \u201cnot every insomniac should be treated like every other\u201d and that advice should be individualized. He described the effectiveness of customized sleep hygiene recommendations and, doing so, demonstrated improved sleep in participants at one, three and six months after treatment (Hauri, 1993).

This desire to be therapeutically independent and empowered reflects national guidelines around recovery in mental health, which underline the importance of patient-centred interventions (HSE, 2017)\nUsefulness of sleep workbook in clinical setting The quantitative findings demonstrate the sleep workbook to be an effective intervention in patients with a range of diagnoses. This is in keeping with previous research, which demonstrates improvement in sleep in participants using a selfhelp book, compared to a sleep hygiene education sheet (Bjorvatn et al., 2011), in a non-psychiatric population. Although it is recognised that sleep problems are prevalent in patients with psychiatric problems, many CMHTs have challenges with a lack of availability of CBT-I. Faulkner and Mairs (2015) report an urgent need to identify, design and evaluate OT assessments and interventions to address sleep in mental health settings. Furthermore, face-to-face restrictions surrounding this intervention prompted us to consider an intervention that would have minimal or no-contact, but could still engage participants meaningfully. In this context, our sleep workbook intervention was developed. It provides all the recognised benefits of sleep hygiene education, such as immediate availability and cost efficiency (Irish et al., 2015), in addition to being clinically efficacious. We acknowledge the potential added benefit of having a clinician assist the person in picking out individual components to focus on, as was highlighted by participants who suggested that even a brief, onceoff overview with a clinician would have been beneficial. Leland et al. (2014) noted that OTs are uniquely positioned to address sleep problems in a holistic manner to promote health and quality of life. Having established the benefits of the workbook in this pilot study, we recommend that a further, larger interventional study be carried out to compare the relative benefits of a patient-guided sleep workbook intervention (such as this) versus an intervention that is co-led by patient and clinician, to determine whether the benefit of clinician involvement would be of sufficient magnitude to devote additional resources. However, it is possible that mandatory social restrictions may return, and the trend of remote working is likely to continue, so a readily available and clinically efficacious no-contact treatment optionwill be a valuable resource."

            "text": "Of the 30 service users that agreed to participate, 50% returned the survey, with four participating in the focus group. Although the response rate was lower than desired, this is an adequate sample size for a pilot study, with previous literature recommending around 12 participants (Julious, 2005). It is recommended that qualitative studies of this magnitude aim for 2\u20134 participants in focus groups and 10 participants for participant-generated text (Fugard and Potts, 2015). Therefore, the number of respondents was appropriate for this kind of preliminary study and for a qualitative analysis. Furthermore, in spite of the 50% attrition, this study yielded results that were statistically and clinically significant.\nA related limitation is the possibility of selection bias, where only the most motivated completed surveys. However, given the low resources required for this intervention, this is an acceptable shortcoming that does not negate the substantial benefits experienced by participants. Another limitation to consider is the possibility of social desirability bias, where participants may have had a subjective sense of perceived pressure for positive feedback as they were current service users."

It has been shown to be useful in clinical practice as it is a cost-neutral psychotherapeutic intervention that provides patients with therapeutic autonomy and improves quantity and quality of sleep. It is deliverable as a nocontact intervention, which could be of benefit in the coming years, with the possibility that repeated, social restrictions and remote working could be a feature of the Irish landscape for some time. COVID presents as a vicious cycle when it comes to sleep, increasing sleep related problems and reducing access to sleep interventions. This approach with a patient-guided sleep workbookmay just be the key to breaking that cycle."
