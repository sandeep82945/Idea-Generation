    "abstractText": "This study investigated the antitumor effects of foretinib on triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in vivo underlying phosphorylated mesenchymal to epithelial transition (p-MET)/ hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-related mechanism, as well as its pharmacokinetic characteristics. The MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line was used for in vitro experiments, and the tumor xenograft model was established for in vivo experiments. MDA-MB-231 xenograft mice received oral foretinib (15 or 50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 18 days. The xenograft tumors were collected. Protein expressions of p-MET and HGF were examined with Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. The mRNA expression of MET was examined with real-time PCR. Blood samples were collected from the mice treated with foretinib under different doses of 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg, and the pharmacokinetic profiles of foretinib were evaluated. We found that foretinib treatment caused a significant inhibition in tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the continuous administration did not result in weight loss in treated nude mice. In both MDA-MB-231 cells and xenograft tumors, foretinib suppressed the expression of p-MET and HGF. These findings reveal that the decrease of p-MET and HGF may play an important role in the anti-breast cancer properties of foretinib.",

            "text": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype with a poor prognosis and overall survival. It does not express estrogen receptor \u03b1, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Therefore, TNBC lacks molecular targets for effective therapeutics [1,2]. Mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which is overexpressed in 20\u201330% of breast cancer cases [3]. MET overexpression promotes the growth, survival, and migration of cancer cells and appears to be associated with a worse prognosis and a metastatic phenotype. MET can be activated through mechanisms, including ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation, such as mutation autocrine or paracrine stimulation [4,5]. The ligand-dependent activation of MET occurs in the mammary gland, where stromal cells produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [6]. When bound to the ligand (i.e., HGF), the kinase domain is activated and generates phosphorylated MET (p-MET), which activates a number of downstream signaling routes, such as rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) [7,8]. The abnormal HGF/MET signaling pathway confers an aggressive phenotype with a high risk of progression and poor outcome [9,10].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 757. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24010757 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 757 2 of 9\nForetinib is a multitargeted small-molecule kinase inhibitor that targets HGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinases, platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGF-R\u03b2), Tie-2, FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT-3), AXL, 3-KIT, and RON [11]. As a potent inhibitor of MET, foretinib suppressed different MET-activated cell lines and reduced tumor growth in different animal studies [12,13]. Foretinib inhibited the HGF-induced MET phosphorylation and prevented the HGF-induced responses of tumor cells. It is believed that p-MET is a promising therapeutic target due to its elevated expression in multiple TNBC subtypes, which indicates that, by inhibiting the HGF/MET signaling pathway, foretinib may exert an antitumor effect through a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cell proliferation [14,15]. This study aims to investigate the inhibition of foretinib on TNBC in vitro and in vivo and to achieve a better understanding of the potential role of p-MET inhibition in TNBC treatment using foretinib. To accomplish this, we examined the antitumor effects of foretinib in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in vivo and then investigated the effects of foretinib on p-MET/HGF signaling in both breast cancer cells and xenograft tumors."

            "text": "The results of the tumor growth inhibition assay indicated that the high-dose foretinib treatment (50 mg/kg/day) caused a remarkable suppression in tumor growth compared with those of the low-dose group (15 mg/kg/day) and vehicle-treated controls. In a previous study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of foretinib on MDA-MB-231 cells [16]. The in vitro results indicated that foretinib could arrest cancer cells mainly in the G2/M phase and induce marked apoptosis, which may contribute to the antitumor activity and cytotoxic effectivity of foretinib. A previous study indicated that foretinib could remarkably inhibit the expression of p-MET in MDA-MB-231, but the expression of MET remained unchanged [17]. We also demonstrated that foretinib could inhibit the expression of p-MET in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors. A Western blot analysis showed that p-MET and HGF protein levels in the vehicle treatment group were significantly higher than those in breast tissues of healthy nude mice, and treatment with foretinib significantly decreased the level of upstream p-MET protein. Our IHC staining results also confirmed these findings. Compared with the vehicle treatment group, the mRNA expression of MET and HGF in tumors was significantly inhibited by the administration of foretinib in a dose-dependent manner, which was consistent with the results of Western blot and IHC staining. The observed net MET and HGF mRNA levels are the sum of reduction by foretinib and induction by natural cancer disease progression. It was reported that TNBC cells exhibit the perpetual phosphorylation of EGFR, even in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), which correlates with the resistance to these inhibitors induced by MET\u2013EGFR crosstalk. EGFR and MET may interplay independently of both receptor activities, which can promote resistance to EGFR inhibitors via the constitutive phosphorylation of MET [18,19]. In this scenario, the combinations of MET and EGFR inhibitors may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment [5].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 757 6 of 9\nFurthermore, our previous study suggested that foretinib can cause cancer cells to accumulate in the G2/M phase and thus inhibit the metastasis of cells [16]. Therefore, the effects on cell cycles should be considered in combinations of foretinib and other antitumor drugs. One aim of our study is to support this combination regimen. The main limitation of this study was the small sample size of mice in the pharmacokinetic study. Only the blood samples of three mice at each time point were collected to determine the plasma concentrations of foretinib, although the variations among individuals are minor. In summary, this is a study of the anti-TNBC effects of foretinib and its mechanism of action. Our studies demonstrate that inhibiting the autophosphorylation of p-MET plays an important role in the anti-TNBC effect of foretinib. Furthermore, we investigated the pharmacokinetic characteristics of foretinib in the tumor xenograft model, which could help describe the quantitative relationship between the drug concentration and tumor size. With its ideal pharmacokinetic characteristics, low toxicity, and p-MET/HGF pathway inhibition, foretinib displays promising chemotherapeutics for treating and preventing TNBC."

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization and methodology, X.J. and X.Z.; software, X.J., X.M. and Q.H.; validation, X.J., X.M., Y.S. and X.Z.; formal analysis and investigation, X.J. and X.M.; resources, X.J., X.X., Q.H. and X.Z.; data curation, X.J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, X.J. and X.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, Q.H., X.Z. and Y.S.; visualization, X.J. and X.Z.; supervision, Q.H., X.X., Y.S. and X.Z.; project administration, X.J. and X.M.; funding acquisition, X.J.
