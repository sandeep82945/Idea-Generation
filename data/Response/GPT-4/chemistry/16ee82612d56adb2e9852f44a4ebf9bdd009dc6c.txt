Exploration of Other Oxyprenylated Phenylpropanoids: Investigate a broader range of naturally occurring oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids beyond auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin for their potential protective effects on mitochondria against various types of stressors, including but not limited to organophosphate pesticides. This could help to identify new compounds with even greater efficacy or specificity in protecting mitochondrial functionality.

Mechanistic Studies of Protective Effects: Conduct detailed mechanistic studies to understand how oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids exert their protective effects on mitochondria. This includes exploring their interactions with mitochondrial membranes, potential modulation of mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and fission processes), and their effects on the mitochondrial electron transport chain and ATP production. Understanding the precise mechanisms can lead to targeted therapeutic strategies.

Development of Semisynthetic Derivatives: Design and synthesize semisynthetic derivatives of the most promising oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids to enhance their bioavailability, stability, or specificity for mitochondrial targets. This could involve modifications to increase penetration across cellular and mitochondrial membranes or to improve selective binding to mitochondrial proteins involved in stress response pathways.

Preclinical and Clinical Evaluations: Initiate preclinical studies in relevant animal models to assess the neuroprotective and mitochondria-protective effects of the identified compounds in conditions associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Successful preclinical results could pave the way for clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety in humans.

Investigation of Dietary Sources and Nutraceutical Development: Since some of the oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids are found in commonly consumed foods, further research could focus on evaluating the dietary sources of these compounds for their potential health benefits. This could lead to the development of nutraceuticals or functional foods enriched with specific oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids, aimed at enhancing mitochondrial health and preventing diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.
