"It is essential to highlight that to evaluate the negative effect of RONS on barley grains exposed to plasma for extended periods, the following indicators need to be used: (i) decrease in chlorophyll content; (ii) increase in lipid peroxidation; (iii) reduction in photosynthetic efficiency; (iv) oxidative damage to DNA and proteins; and (v) alteration in antioxidant enzyme activity. These indicators can be measured using various techniques such as spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By monitoring these indicators, it is possible to determine the extent of damage caused by RONS to barley grains and to develop strategies to mitigate their harmful effects. Although, this was not the focus of the present research, future investigation on this matter should be considered."
