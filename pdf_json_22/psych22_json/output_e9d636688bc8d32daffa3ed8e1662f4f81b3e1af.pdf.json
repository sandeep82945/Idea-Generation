    "abstractText": "Emerging adult newlywed couples often experience many demands on their time, and three common problems may surface as couples try to balance these demands\u2014problems related to finances, sleep, and sex. We used two waves of dyadic data from 1,001 emerging adult newlywed couples to identify four dyadic latent profiles from husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 financial management behaviors, sexual satisfaction, and sleep quality: Flounderers, Financially Challenged Lovers, Drowsy Budgeters, and Flourishers. We then examined how husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 marital satisfaction, in relation to profile membership, varied at a later wave. We found that Financially Challenged Lovers and Flourishers had significantly higher marital satisfaction than Drowsy Budgeters and Flounderers (mostly medium effect sizes). Whereas, Financially Challenged Lovers and Flourishers did not differ in terms of marital satisfaction, Drowsy Budgeters seemed to have slightly higher marital satisfaction than Flounderers for wives only (small effect size). However, we did not find evidence that these connections meaningfully differed by sex. Implications for the efforts of clinicians and educators are discussed.",

We\u00a0used two waves of\ndyadic data from 1,001 emerging adult newlywed couples to identify four dyadic\nlatent profiles from husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 financial management behaviors, sexual\nsatisfaction, and sleep quality: Flounderers, Financially Challenged Lovers, Drowsy\nBudgeters, and Flourishers. We\u00a0then examined how husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 marital\nsatisfaction, in relation to profile membership, varied at a later wave. We\u00a0found\nthat Financially Challenged Lovers and Flourishers had significantly higher marital\nsatisfaction than Drowsy Budgeters and Flounderers (mostly medium effect\nsizes). Whereas, Financially Challenged Lovers and Flourishers did not differ in\nterms of marital satisfaction, Drowsy Budgeters seemed to have slightly higher\nmarital satisfaction than Flounderers for wives only (small effect size). However,\nwe\u00a0did not find evidence that these connections meaningfully differed by sex.\nImplications for the efforts of clinicians and educators are discussed.\nKEYWORDS\nemerging adult, financial management behaviors, latent profile, marital satisfaction, newlywed, sleep quality, sexual satisfaction, financial behavior\nIntroduction\nAlthough newlywed couples often begin marriage with an optimistic view of their future, couples\u2019 experiences may not be\u00a0commensurate with this view (Lavner et\u00a0al., 2013).

In balancing these demands, two common relational barriers surface for these couples\u2014problems related to money (Risch et\u00a0 al., 2003; Dew, 2008; Barton and Bryant, 2016) and problems related to sex (Risch et\u00a0al., 2003; Rehman et\u00a0al., 2011). As couples handle these two problems well, their marriage may benefit (McNulty et\u00a0al., 2016; Glenn et\u00a0 al., 2019). Additionally, a recent report from the American Psychological Association (APA, 2021) suggests that ~67% of United\u00a0States (US) adults\u2014including emerging adults\u2014 are sleeping more or less than desired. With the added demands of emerging adulthood (e.g., Ranta et\u00a0al., 2014; Brauner-Otto and Geist, 2018; LeBaron and Kelley, 2021), these newlywed couples also may sacrifice sleep to attend to other endeavors. Sleep problems matter because recent research indicates that sleep quality and marital satisfaction are positively associated (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015; Lee et\u00a0al., 2017; Maranges and McNulty, 2017).\nTaken together, it appears that sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction each have the potential to impact emerging adult newlywed\u2019s marital satisfaction in positive or negative ways. However, scholars have not yet examined if there are emerging adult newlywed couples that might fall into particular groups related to these constructs (e.g., proficient at money management and sleep, yet lacking in sexual satisfaction) and if group membership has implications for later marital satisfaction. To this end, we\u00a0examined latent profiles of emerging adult newlywed couples\u2019 sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction and whether profile membership is associated with later marital satisfaction to further research in this area. The remainder of the literature review is organized as follows: first, we\u00a0will review theory and literature about associations between sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction predicting marital satisfaction in emerging adult newlywed couples; second, we\u00a0will describe the potential for sex differences in these associations; finally, we\u00a0 will describe why using a person-centered approach provides unique value in examining these connections.\nScholars have found a positive association between sleep quality and marital satisfaction (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015; Lee et\u00a0al., 2017; Maranges and McNulty, 2017). Research with older married adults that assessed the connection between sleep quality (i.e., the degree to which one receives a healthy amount of sleep) and marital quality found a positive association between the two (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015; Lee et\u00a0 al., 2017). In particular, scholars in one of these studies found a positive association between marital quality and sleep quality over 8 years (Lee et\u00a0 al., 2017), suggesting a longitudinal connection between sleep quality and marital quality. In another study, comprised of many emerging adult newlywed couples, analysis of 7 days of daily diary data suggested that on days when spouses reported getting more sleep, they also reported greater marital satisfaction (Maranges and McNulty, 2017).\nAlthough these studies provide a foundation to build upon, further testing of sleep quality\u2019s longitudinal impact on marital satisfaction (i.e., defined as the degree to which a spouse perceives their marriage is satisfying, rewarding, and happiness promoting) in emerging adult newlywed couples seems warranted. Although longitudinal connections between marital quality and sleep quality have been found in one study (Lee et\u00a0al., 2017), a majority of studies of sleep quality and marital satisfaction have been crosssectional (e.g., Chen et\u00a0 al., 2015). Because previous literature suggests the possibility of longitudinal connections between marital quality and sleep quality (Lee et\u00a0 al., 2017) as well as connections between sleep quality and marital satisfaction in emerging adult newlywed couples (Maranges and McNulty, 2017), we\u00a0suspected that sleep quality might be\u00a0longitudinally associated with marital satisfaction.\nCouples and finance theory (CFT) provides insight into connections between financial management behaviors (i.e., financial behaviors that help individuals achieve financial goals and financial wellbeing; Xiao, 2016, p.\u00a03) and marital quality (Archuleta and Burr, 2015). Indeed, one purpose of CFT is to describe the interrelated nature of financial processes\u2014 including financial management behaviors\u2014and the couple relationship. Based on previous research that has largely shown a positive association between financial management behaviors and marital satisfaction (for a review, see Mentzer et\u00a0al., 2010 and Glenn et\u00a0 al., 2019), CFT assumes the way a couple navigates their finances will be\u00a0associated with their marital satisfaction (Archuleta and Burr, 2015). In other words, if emerging adult newlywed couples navigate potential financial problems (Risch et\u00a0al., 2003; Dew, 2008; Barton and Bryant, 2016) well, their satisfaction with their relationship may benefit. Through this CFT lens, we\u00a0tested if the assumption that financial management behaviors may impact marital satisfaction applies in our sample.\nPrevious literature supports CFT by, in general, suggesting a positive association between financial management behaviors and marital satisfaction (Mentzer et\u00a0al., 2010; Glenn et\u00a0al., 2019). However, much of this research has included samples of more established adults and not emerging adult newlywed couples. Indeed, qualitative evidence from couples in long-term marriages suggests that positive financial management behaviors (e.g., living within one\u2019s means, avoiding debt, etc.) might contribute to marital quality (Skogrand et\u00a0 al., 2011), and quantitative evidence from adult samples supports this positive association (Spuhlera and Dew, 2019; Dew et\u00a0al., 2021). One of few studies of financial management behaviors and marital satisfaction among mostly emerging adult newlywed couples also found a positive association between the two (Kerkmann et\u00a0 al., 2000). Furthermore, other longitudinal work suggests that when newlywed couples pay off consumer debt, their marital satisfaction likely benefits (Dew, 2008). Therefore, it is possible that financial management behaviors, which might be\u00a0negatively associated with consumer debt (e.g., the better financial management behaviors are, perhaps couples might avoid\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nconsumer debt; Dew, 2008), might be\u00a0longitudinally connected to marital satisfaction.\nSpecifically in an emerging adult context, examining financial management behaviors as playing a role, longitudinally, in impacting marital satisfaction among newlywed couples matters because achieving financial independence from family may have romantic relationship implications (Willoughby and Carroll, 2015). Although practicing healthy financial management behaviors may not be\u00a0 synonymous to achieving financial independence, these behaviors may help contribute toward financial independence. For example, making and sticking to a monthly budget or spending plan may help emerging adults become financially independent from their parents swifter than not doing so. Based on this previous (but limited) literature, it appeared that financial management behaviors could be\u00a0 longitudinally associated with marital satisfaction.\nThe interpersonal exchange model of sexual satisfaction (IEMSS) suggests that sexual satisfaction (i.e., defined in this study as a spouse\u2019s satisfaction with their sexual relationship with their spouse) will likely increase when relationship satisfaction increases (Lawrance and Byers, 1995). However, recent work suggests the inverse might also have merit. That is, recent longitudinal evidence suggests that sexual satisfaction may also engender increases in relationship satisfaction (Fallis et\u00a0al., 2016; McNulty et\u00a0al., 2016; Cao et\u00a0al., 2019a). Although the IEMSS\u2019 assumption that romantic relationship satisfaction likely increases sexual satisfaction may also still be\u00a0supported by recent research (e.g., McNulty et\u00a0al., 2016), recent evidence (Fallis et\u00a0al., 2016; McNulty et\u00a0al., 2016; Cao et\u00a0al., 2019a) seems to be\u00a0 suggesting the IEMSS may extend to a possible bidirectional association between romantic relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction. In this study, we\u00a0 tested whether the inverse of one of the main assumptions of IEMSS may apply in our sample\u2014that is, that sexual satisfaction may be\u00a0 positively and longitudinally associated with marital satisfaction.\nResearch over the last two decades supports this possible extension by suggesting that sexual satisfaction seems to be\u00a0positively associated with marital satisfaction (Fallis et\u00a0al., 2016; Gadassi et\u00a0 al., 2016; McNulty et\u00a0 al., 2016; Cao et\u00a0 al., 2019a). Notably, Cao et\u00a0 al. (2019a) tested the directionality between sexual satisfaction and marital satisfaction in a sample of 268 different-sex, newlywed Chinese couples, which included many emerging adult couples. These authors found that across time, husbands\u2019 sexual satisfaction predicted their own marital satisfaction\u2014rather than the reverse (Cao et\u00a0al., 2019a). Other studies support this longitudinal finding (i.e., sexual satisfaction predicting marital satisfaction over time) in mostly adult couples (Fallis et\u00a0al., 2016) and mostly emerging adult newlywed couples (McNulty et\u00a0al., 2016). Based on this previous research, it seemed reasonable to hypothesize a positive, longitudinal association between sexual satisfaction and marital satisfaction in our sample.\nAdditionally, it seems that for different-sex, emerging adult newlywed couples, there may be\u00a0sex differences in sleep quality\u2019s, financial management behaviors\u2019 and sexual satisfaction\u2019s associations with marital satisfaction. For example, Maranges and McNulty (2017) found that newlywed husbands\u2019\u2014but not wives\u2019\u2014sleep quality buffered the negative effect of daily marital evaluations (e.g., including daily evaluations of sex, chores, affection, etc.) on marital satisfaction. Put simply, high quality sleep could benefit husbands\u2019 marital satisfaction more than high quality sleep may benefit wives\u2019 marital satisfaction. This possible sex difference could be\u00a0explained by women tending to report lower quality sleep and more disrupted sleep (Mong and Cusmano, 2016). That is, wives may be\u00a0slightly more accustomed to lower quality sleep than husbands, so when husbands have lower quality sleep, it might be\u00a0more likely to spill over into the marital relationship.\nFurthermore, research suggests that women\u2019s joint involvement in couple financial management longitudinally predicts relationship quality and stability (LeBaron et\u00a0al., 2019). However, men\u2019s joint involvement in financial management was not longitudinally associated with either relationship quality or stability. The authors\u2019 feminist framework would likely support the notion that some women could have less relational power with money (i.e., women having less influence in couple financial decision making), so when women are jointly involved in the couple\u2019s financial management, it might impact relational outcomes\u2014like relationship quality and stability\u2014more than when men are (LeBaron et\u00a0al., 2019). Alternatively, other scholars suggest that similar sex differences (i.e., wives\u2019 financial management behaviors as more predictive of marital outcomes than husbands\u2019 financial management behaviors) could be\u00a0due to societal expectations that husbands might be\u00a0more expected to manage money well than their wives (Saxey et\u00a0al., 2021). That is, because husbands might be\u00a0expected to manage money well, their healthy financial management behaviors could be\u00a0less predictive of marital outcomes.\nOther research with different-sex, newlywed Chinese couples found that husbands\u2019 sexual satisfaction longitudinally predicted their own marital satisfaction (Cao et\u00a0 al., 2019a). For wives, however, their sexual satisfaction did not longitudinally predict their own marital satisfaction. We\u00a0 suspect this sex difference might be\u00a0due to sexual aspects of relationships tending to be\u00a0more salient for men than women (Sprecher, 2002). That is, men tend to experience more pleasure (i.e., orgasm) from sex (Mahar et\u00a0al., 2020), which could partially explain why sexual aspects of relationships might be\u00a0 more salient for men. Together, this previous literature points to the potential for sex differences in different-sex, emerging adult newlywed couples\u2019 sleep quality\u2019s, financial management behaviors\u2019 and sexual satisfaction\u2019s associations with marital satisfaction.\nIn this study, we\u00a0did not use a traditional variable-centered approach in which researchers conduct multiple regression or structural equation modeling to examine how sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction are each\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nassociated with marital satisfaction. Instead, we\u00a0used a personcentered approach to explore latent profiles of these three sets of constructs and how these latent profiles relate to marital satisfaction for the following reasons.\nMethodologically speaking, a person-centered approach treats individuals, couples, and families as an undivided totality (Magnusson, 2003). That is, individuals, couples, and families are formed by the complex interactions among all key variables of the focal phenomena, and characteristics of the totality are based on the meaning of the combination of all variables of interest (Magnusson, 2003; Bergman and Trost, 2006). Specific to our study, sleep quality, sexual satisfaction, and financial management behaviors are usually intertwined. For example, recent research suggests that for newlywed husbands and wives, financial management behaviors were associated with their own sexual satisfaction (Saxey et\u00a0al., 2021). Likewise, other scholars found that sleep quality was associated with financial management behaviors (O\u2019Neill et\u00a0al., 2019). Put simply, each of these three constructs can present challenges for emerging adult newlywed couples (Risch et\u00a0al., 2003; Dew, 2008; Barton and Bryant, 2016; Maranges and McNulty, 2017; APA, 2021), but research has not established, for example, if there are certain couples who might navigate only two of these three challenges well, one of these challenges well, or none of these challenges well and if membership in these groups might have implications for the couple\u2019s marital satisfaction. Thus, instead of regarding sleep quality, sexual satisfaction, and financial management behaviors as isolated constructs, it is necessary to simultaneously consider them all to address this gap in the literature.\nA person-centered analysis assumes the sample is inherently heterogeneous (Bergman and Trost, 2006; Laursen and Hoff, 2006). Instead of focusing on the linear associations from each predictor to the outcome, the person-centered analysis suggests that the complex, high-order interactions among all key components shape the outcomes (Laursen and Hoff, 2006). In line with this perspective, our sample should be\u00a0further classified into subgroups who share specific characteristics of the combination of critical variables of interest. The complex interactions are then interpreted as the difference in outcomes between groups that were characterized by different combinations of key variables (Bergman and Trost, 2006).\nTo this end, the combinations of husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction should be\u00a0associated with marital satisfaction in a way that cannot be\u00a0explained by any single variable. Although some researchers argue that the six-order interaction can be\u00a0 analyzed via a traditional moderating model (i.e., a variable-centered analysis), to unpack the complex connections between sleep quality, financial management behaviors, sexual satisfaction, and marital satisfaction, a notable advantage of a person-centered analysis is the identification of prototypical subgroups within a given sample and the ability to capture the diversity and nuances within the sample (Bauer and Shanahan, 2007).\nUtilizing longitudinal, emerging adult newlywed couples data (N = 1,001 couples), we\u00a0employed a person-centered approach to capture this nuance. That is, we\u00a0 explored latent profiles of husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction. We\u00a0also examined if these latent profiles differ from each other in terms of marital satisfaction, which may provide useful evidence for educators and clinicians who help emerging adult newlywed couples, and if there might be\u00a0sex differences in these connections. Based on the previously outlined theory and literature, we\u00a0 formulated the following research questions:\nRQ1: Are there latent profiles of husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction?\nRQ2: Is latent profile membership for husbands and wives associated with their own marital satisfaction at a later wave in statistically different ways? Said another way, across different profiles, does husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 marital satisfaction vary?\nRQ3: Are there sex differences in marital satisfaction across the latent profiles?"

Seen in our analytic model (Figure\u00a0 1), we\u00a0 ran a dyadic LPA when generating latent profile memberships. That is, each couple was included as a unit and husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 sleep quality, financial\nmanagement behaviors, and sexual satisfaction at W2 were simultaneously included to form profiles. In this way, the identified profiles can reflect the characteristics of each couple. When estimating how latent profile membership is associated with marital satisfaction at W3, both partners\u2019 outcomes were included in the same model, and covariance between husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 marital satisfaction was estimated. Further, pathways from control variables to outcomes were estimated for both spouses. The sleep quality, financial management behaviors, sexual satisfaction, and marital satisfaction variables for husbands and wives had anywhere from 1.6% to 5.7% of missing data. Control variables also had minimal missing data, except for respondents\u2019 credit scores, which were missing up to 25% of observations. In cases of missing data, we\u00a0used Full Information Maximum Likelihood method to retain these observations.\nRQ1: Are there latent profiles of husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction?\nTo determine the optimal number of latent profiles, we\u00a0examined solutions with one to eight profiles, because models with nine or more profiles no longer converged (Weller et\u00a0al., 2020). Log-Likelihood, AIC, and ABIC kept decreasing. BIC was the smallest when the number of profiles reached four, indicating the best fit (Nylund et\u00a0 al., 2007), and VLMRT and BLRT demonstrated that increasing the number of profiles to six or above no longer statistically significantly improved the model fit. In each model, we\u00a0 constrained the variance in residual of a corresponding indicator to be\u00a0 equal across profiles. The covariance among residuals of different indicators within each profile was fixed to zero. The four-profile model and the fiveprofile model were, therefore, the statistically best two models out of all eight solutions. Then, we\u00a0 compared the theoretical interpretability of the four-profile and the five-profile models to determine the optimal choice. Because the five-profile model did not add to common themes identified in the four-profile model, we\u00a0 decided to keep the four-profile model. Subsequently, we\u00a0assigned profiles labels in accordance with information in Figure\u00a02. To demonstrate the accuracy and certainty in assigning every couple to an identified profile, we\u00a0calculated the average posterior class probability (AvePP > 0.70) and odds of correct classification (OCC > 5) according to statistical guidelines (Masyn, 2013) and an empirical study (Li et\u00a0al., 2019).\nRQ2: Is latent profile membership for husbands and wives associated with their own marital satisfaction at a later wave in statistically different ways?\nFollowing the assignments to latent profiles, latent profile membership at W2 was used to assess martial satisfaction of each partner longitudinally at W3, along with other variables that may covary with profile membership. Following the recommendations in statistical papers (Asparouhov and Muth\u00e9n, 2014) and empirical studies (Cao et\u00a0al., 2019b), the Bolck\u2013Croon\u2013Hagenaars\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\n(BCH) method was used. This approach estimates differences in the husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 marital satisfaction across the identified latent profile groups. In this way, all control variables mentioned in the measures section were included in the model when estimating marital satisfaction. Pairwise comparisons were conducted to detect differences in husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 marital satisfaction across every latent profile (Asparouhov and Muth\u00e9n, 2014). To adjust for the inflated type I\u00a0 error, the Bonferroni correction was utilized. Cohen\u2019s ds (i.e., the effect sizes) of between-group differences were calculated using the online calculator developed by Becker (1999).\nRQ3: Are there sex differences in marital satisfaction across the latent profiles\nTo detect whether the associations from latent profile membership to marital satisfaction varied between husbands and wives, we\u00a0analyzed sex differences in line with prior work (Cao et\u00a0al., 2019b). Specifically, and given the non-independent nature of husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 reports on marital satisfaction in the same relationship, we\u00a0 generated a new variable\u2014a within-couple difference score between husbands and wives\u2014 by subtracting wives\u2019 marital satisfaction at W3 from her\nhusbands\u2019 marital satisfaction at W3. Then, continuing using the BCH method (Asparouhov and Muth\u00e9n, 2014) and controlling for the same set of covariates, we\u00a0examined whether the difference score for each identified profile differed statistically significantly from zero. Cohen\u2019s ds for sex differences were calculated using the online calculator by Lenhard and Lenhard (2016) for dependent t-tests."

            "text": "Concerning our first research question, we\u00a0found four latent profiles that provide descriptive nuance to emerging adult newlywed partners\u2019 financial management behaviors, sleep quality, and sexual satisfaction. Indeed, after accounting for relevant control variables, the following four latent profiles emerged. First, Flounderers (11.8% of the sample) included those husbands and wives who were low on financial management behaviors, sleep quality, and sexual satisfaction. Second, Drowsy Budgeters (20.3% of the sample) consisted of those husbands and wives who were low on sleep quality and sexual satisfaction yet were high on financial management behaviors. Third, Financially Challenged Lovers (30.6% of the sample) included those husbands and wives who reported average sleep quality, low financial management behaviors, and high sexual satisfaction. Finally, Flourishers (37.4% of the sample) consisted of those husbands and wives who reported high on financial management behaviors, sleep quality, and sexual satisfaction.\nOur methodology and relatively large, dyadic sample allowed us to build upon previous variable-centered approaches with these constructs. Newlywed couples, especially those with unique challenges in emerging adulthood (Ranta et\u00a0al., 2014; BraunerOtto and Geist, 2018; LeBaron and Kelley, 2021), may struggle with sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction (Risch et\u00a0al., 2003; Barton and Bryant, 2016; APA, 2021), which might have implications for the couple\u2019s marital satisfaction (Dew, 2008; Maranges and McNulty, 2017; Cao et\u00a0al., 2019a). However, until now, scholars have not yet examined complex interactions between these variables. Identifying these four distinct latent profiles, beyond the descriptive nuance they provided, matters because profile membership seemed to differ in terms of marital satisfaction at W3.\nRQ2 and RQ3: W2 latent profile membership, W3 marital satisfaction, and (a lack of) sex differences\nIn support of previous work (e.g., Dew, 2008; Lee et\u00a0al., 2017; Maranges and McNulty, 2017; Cao et\u00a0al., 2019a), it appears that\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nhusbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction were collectively associated with marital satisfaction at W3, and these associations differed by profile membership\u2014but not sex. That is, it appears that the answer to our second research question (i.e., is latent profile membership for husbands and wives associated with their own marital satisfaction at a later wave in statistically different ways?) is mostly yes, and the answer to our third research question (i.e., do these associations differ by sex?) is\u2014rather unmistakably\u2014no.\nFor wives, Financially Challenged Lovers, Drowsy Budgeters, and Flourishers each had significantly higher marital satisfaction at W3 than Flounderers (effect sizes were small and medium). For husbands, however, only Financially Challenged Lovers and Flourishers had significantly higher marital satisfaction at W3 than Flounderers (medium and large effect sizes). Overall, simultaneously having poor financial management behaviors, low sleep quality, and low sexual satisfaction seems to matter for both husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 marital satisfaction at W3. When comparing Flourishers and Drowsy Budgeters to Financially Challenged Lovers, interesting differences\u2014and a lack of difference\u2014 emerged. For both husbands and wives, Drowsy Budgeters had significantly lower marital satisfaction at W3 compared to Financially Challenged Lovers (small effect size for wives; medium effect size for husbands). For both husbands and wives, however, Financially Challenged Lovers and Flourishers did not differ from each other in terms of marital satisfaction at W3. That is, even when financial management behaviors for husbands and wives were poor, if they reported average sleep quality and high sexual satisfaction, their marital satisfaction at W3 was not statistically different from those husbands and wives high on financial management behaviors, sleep quality, and sexual satisfaction.\nAlthough finances tend to be\u00a0 salient for emerging adults (LeBaron and Kelley, 2021), low versus high financial management behaviors in the Financially Challenged Lovers and Flourishers Profiles did not seem to be\u00a0associated with marital satisfaction at W3\u00a0in statistically different ways. Indeed, both of these profiles were high on sexual satisfaction, which could be\u00a0 particularly salient for newlywed couples (Risch et\u00a0al., 2003; Rehman et\u00a0al., 2011), and this high sexual satisfaction could contribute to higher marital satisfaction even if financial management behaviors are poor. Finally, for both husbands and wives, Flourishers tended to have significantly higher marital satisfaction at W3 than Drowsy Budgeters (medium effect sizes). Although financial management behaviors were both high for these two profiles, having high sleep quality and sexual satisfaction seems to be\u00a0important for marital satisfaction at W3\u2014perhaps more important than financial management behaviors. Based on the sex difference comparisons, these connections should be\u00a0considered similar across sex."

            "text": "Within the context of emerging adult newlywed clients who may struggle with some combination of sleep quality,\nfinancial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction (Risch et\u00a0al., 2003; Dew, 2008; APA, 2021), we\u00a0provide specific direction for clinicians who work with these clients. For example, clinicians might have use for our results as they relate to Flounderers and Drowsy Budgeters, which might include ~32% of different-sex, emerging adult newlywed couples. If an emerging adult newlywed couple is struggling with sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and their sexual satisfaction (i.e., Flounderers), clinicians may encourage these couples that if they prioritize improving in these three areas, their later marital satisfaction might be\u00a0higher\u2014due to the medium effect sizes of the differences between Flounderers\u2019 and Flourishers\u2019 marital satisfaction. However, we\u00a0 acknowledge that although couples\u2019 money management and financial wellbeing have repeatedly been linked to relational wellbeing and should not be\u00a0 ignored (Kerkmann et\u00a0al., 2000; Dew, 2008; LeBaron et\u00a0al., 2019), for Flounderers, clinicians might prioritize sleep quality and sexual satisfaction in their initial sessions, given that Financially Challenged Lovers did not differ from Flourishers in their marital satisfaction.\nClinicians might also offer similar support for Drowsy Budgeters. Due to finances being a common problem for newlywed couples (Risch et\u00a0 al., 2003; Dew, 2008; Barton and Bryant, 2016) and emerging adults (LeBaron and Kelley, 2021), a clinician might wonder where the next evidence-based area for intervention might be\u00a0 for Drowsy Budgeters (i.e., which may include roughly 20% of different-sex, emerging adult newlywed couples). Our results provide specific direction for clinicians in this position to consider intervening in sleep quality and sexual satisfaction for these couples.\nIndeed, sexual satisfaction appeared to be\u00a0 salient for marital satisfaction. That is, the two profiles with the highest marital satisfaction at W3 (i.e., Flourishers and Financially Challenged Lovers) both reported high levels of sexual satisfaction. Additionally, the supplemental APIM revealed that the only main study constructs to predict later marital satisfaction were both husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 sexual satisfaction. These results further implicate the importance of helping different-sex, emerging adult clients in new marriages be\u00a0 intentional in their sexual relationship. To help these clients who often struggle with their sexual relationship (Risch et\u00a0 al., 2003), in addition to using other established therapeutic models, clinicians might consider using the sexual wholeness model (Busby et\u00a0 al., 2022). Using this model, clinicians might assist couples in developing a refined perspective of their sexual relationship (i.e., one that emphasizes the physical, emotional, and meaning-making aspects of couple sexuality). For each of these recommendations, along with the recommendations that follow, our results suggest that these implications are similar for husbands and wives.\nRelational educators are interested in helping couples develop and sustain their romantic relationships (Stanley\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\net\u00a0al., 2020), and our findings provide descriptive nuance that may assist in these relational education efforts. For example, because sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction may be\u00a0salient for emerging adult newlywed couples (Risch et\u00a0al., 2003; Dew, 2008; Maranges and McNulty, 2017; APA, 2021), relational educators might be\u00a0interested in teaching emerging adult newlywed couples about how to develop and sustain their romantic relationship in these areas. Describing each of the latent profiles and emphasizing how they each are longitudinally associated with marital satisfaction in different ways may help in illustrating the unique importance of sleep quality and sexual satisfaction. That is, this descriptive nuance might provide motivation to develop and sustain new marriages, especially in the areas of sleep and sex. These efforts to develop and sustain marital satisfaction at the start of new marriages may be\u00a0especially important because initially high levels of marital satisfaction may remain over the first few years of marriage (Williamson and Lavner, 2020).\nWe note that although these latent profiles were identified net of our controls and we\u00a0 used longitudinal data, the constructs we\u00a0 examined (i.e., sleep quality, financial management behaviors, sexual satisfaction, and marital satisfaction)\u2014and, therefore, the latent profiles\u2014could be\u00a0 malleable. For example, an emerging adult newlywed couple might at one point be\u00a0 considered Financially Challenged Lovers or Flourishers. However, the couple may later find themselves as Flounderers or Drowsy Budgeters, which may have implications for the couple\u2019s marital satisfaction. Just as these constructs could change in negative ways, relational educators and clinicians might also help these couples return to, or become, Flourishers. In essence, educators and clinicians who might use these findings may consider the possible malleability of these latent profiles."

Second, since we\u00a0used a sample of emerging adult newlywed couples, our findings may not apply to more established couples, cohabiting couples, etc. Third, although we\u00a0utilized longitudinal data, the associations we\u00a0found among the latent profiles and marital satisfaction should not be\u00a0considered causal. We\u00a0also used a scale to measure sexual satisfaction that was not validated, which was a limitation of the data; future research could use more vetted measures. Finally, while the initial sample was nationally representative of newlywed couples in the US\n(James et\u00a0al., 2021) and attrition remained minimal, attrition by W3 may have affected the sample\u2019s representativeness."

            "text": "Despite the present study\u2019s limitations, we\u00a0 contribute to the literature on sleep quality, financial management behaviors, and sexual satisfaction in emerging adult, different-sex new marriages. Specifically, many emerging adult, newlywed couples may fall into four particular categories in terms of financial management behaviors, sleep quality, and sexual satisfaction, which may have implications for the couple\u2019s marital satisfaction over time. Flourishers and Financially Challenged Lovers reported the highest marital satisfaction a year later. On the other hand, Drowsy Budgeters and Flounderers reported lower marital satisfaction a year later. These findings provide novel descriptive nuance for the efforts of marital clinicians and educators. That is, as these professionals implement practices and efforts in line with these findings, the marital satisfaction of emerging adult newlywed couples may benefit."
