Such experiences are of great interest in sport and exercise as they are 4 associated with highly valued outcomes, such as exceptional performance, intrinsic 5 motivation, and wellbeing (Csikszentmihalyi, 2002). The primary concept studied in the field 6 of optimal experience has traditionally been flow (e.g., Jackson, 1996). Flow is defined as a 7 highly positive, intrinsically rewarding mental state, where an individual is immersed in an 8 activity, to the exclusion of irrelevant emotions and thoughts, and they feel as though 9\neverything harmoniously clicks into place (Csikszentmihalyi, 2002). While 10 Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s nine-dimensions framework of flow1 (e.g., Nakamura & 11 Csikszentmihalyi, 2002) has been predominant in sport and exercise since the early 1990s 12 (e.g., Jackson, 1992), recently alternative perspectives have emerged. 13 Studies indicate that individuals can experience multiple optimal psychological states 14 in sport and exercise, even within the same event. Houge Mackenzie et al. (2011) collected 15 same-day data in adventure recreation and, from a reversal theory perspective, reported two 16 \u201ctypes\u201d of flow - \u201cparatelic\u201d (playful) and \u201ctelic\u201d (serious) flow states. Within the Multi-17 Action Plan Model, Bortoli et al. (2012) proposed \u201cType 1\u201d (automatic) and \u201cType 2\u201d 18 (controlled) performance states, and described how Olympic shooters transitioned between 19 performance types. The Integrated Model of Flow and Clutch States (Swann et al., 2016, 20 2017, 2019) suggests that two psychological states - flow, and a more effortful \u201cclutch\u201d state 21 - underlie exceptional performance and rewarding exercise experiences. These models offer 22\n1 Flow has traditionally been conceptualised as nine dimensions (e.g., Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2002): (i) challenge-skills balance; (ii) clear goals; (iii) unambiguous feedback; (iv) action-awareness merging; (v) concentration on the task at hand; (vi) sense of control ; (vii) loss of self-consciousness ; (viii) transformation of time; (ix) autotelic experience.\nperspectives of optimal experience in sport and exercise. 2 The Integrated Model of Flow and Clutch States 3 The most-studied of these alternatives to the nine-dimensions framework has been the 4 Integrated Model of Flow and Clutch States. The Integrated Model was initially developed 5 through interviews with professional golfers (Swann et al., 2016), and was later refined in 6 studies with a broader range of athletes (Jackman et al., 2017, 2020; Swann et al., 2017a, 7 2017b) and exercisers (Swann et al., 2019). These studies were conducted using \u2018event-8 focused\u2019 interviews (Jackman et al., 2021), which took place on average four days after a 9\nspecific sport or exercise activity/experience. This approach is in contrast to the traditional 10 \u2018career-based\u2019 approach that underpins Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s nine-dimensions framework of 11 flow and prominent flow research in sport based on that framework (e.g., Jackson, 1996). 12 Career-based interviews rely on recall of events that could have occurred months or years in 13 the past (Brewer et al., 1991). As a result, the Integrated Model is based on more recent, 14 specific, detailed, and chronological recall of optimal experiences than the traditional 15 conceptualisation of flow (Swann et al., 2018). 16 In addition to flow, analysis of event-focused data suggested that athletes and 17 exercisers experienced a second, distinct \u2018clutch\u2019 state. Clutch states are conceptualised as the 18 psychological state underlying clutch performance (Swann et al., 2017b), which is defined as 19 enhanced or successful performance under pressure (Schweickle et al., 2020). The 20 characteristics of clutch states are captured by Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s nine-dimensions flow 21 framework (Jackman et al., 2017), raising concerns about discriminant validity within the 22 nine-dimensions framework and accompanying measures (see Swann et al., 2018). There are 23 also differences in the conceptualisation of flow between the Integrated Model and the nine-24 dimensions framework due to the event-focused data obtained and the data-driven approach 25\ndimensions framework refers to clear goals whereas the Integrated Model, more specifically, 2 identifies that open goals are necessary for flow (Swann et al., 2018). 3 According to research underpinning the Integrated Model \u2013 based on interviews with 4 athletes and exercisers (Jackman et al., 2017, 2020; Swann et al., 2016, 2017, 2019) \u2013 flow 5 and clutch states are distinct. That is, both states cannot be experienced at the same time, 6 although participants reported that both states can be experienced during the same activity 7 with transitions from one state to the other possible (e.g., Swann et al., 2017). The Integrated 8 Model describes the situational contexts, processes of occurrence (i.e., the steps through 9\nwhich antecedents are proposed to combine to cause the state), characteristics of the 10 experience (i.e., features of being in flow and clutch states), and outcomes of each state (see 11 Figure 1). 12 INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE 13 Flow and clutch states are proposed to occur in distinct contexts and through different 14 processes of occurrence. Flow has been reported to occur in novel, uncertain, or exploratory 15 contexts, and through a build-up of positive events, feedback, and confidence, before a 16 challenge appraisal, and the setting of open goals (e.g., \u201cto see how many under par I can 17 get\u201d; Swann et al., 2016). Clutch states occur in pressure situations, where the achievement of 18 an important outcome is at stake. These states occur through a process of receiving feedback 19 about the situation (such as seeing a leader board), which leads to a challenge appraisal, 20 before specific goals are set (e.g., to birdie the last two holes to win a golf tournament), and a 21 decision is made to increase effort and intensity in pursuit of those specific goals. 22 Flow and clutch states share overlapping characteristics. In both states, athletes and 23 exercisers reported automatic skill execution, altered perceptions (e.g., altered sense of time), 24 absorption in the activity, and confidence. In addition to overlapping characteristics, there are 25\neffort; absence of negative thoughts; enjoyment of the experience while it is happening; 2 feeling in control; positive feedback about progress (e.g., that the activity is going well); 3 motivation for more (e.g., wanting the state or activity to continue); and optimal arousal. 4 Characteristics specific to clutch states are: effortful concentration; intense effort; analytical 5 thoughts; heightened awareness; feelings of trying to exert control (rather than necessarily 6 feeling in control); feedback towards goal (e.g., what remains in order to achieve the specific 7 goal); motivation to accomplish the specific goals of the situation and to achieve the desired 8 outcomes of the activity; and heightened arousal (i.e., rather than being calm or relaxed, as in 9\nflow). 10 Flow and clutch states also share certain outcomes. Both states lead to intrinsic 11 rewards (e.g., sense of achievement, pride, satisfaction) and perceived excellent performance 12 (i.e., regardless of the objective outcome, athletes and exercisers feel as though they have 13 performed well during these states). However, flow is reported to be an energising 14 experience, whereas clutch states are reported to be exhausting (Swann et al., 2017a, 2019). 15 Although it is in its infancy and still evolving, the Integrated Model is promising in 16 that it identifies specific factors and processes that are proposed to be necessary for flow and 17 clutch states to occur. In contrast to the nine-dimensions framework (e.g., Nakamura & 18 Csikszentmihalyi, 2002), which is based on associations rather than causal explanation (see 19 Swann et al., 2018), the Integrated Model can be used to generate falsifiable hypotheses for 20 future testing. In turn, the Integrated Model could underpin future attempts to purposefully 21 induce flow and clutch states, with existing attempts to induce flow appearing relatively 22 unsuccessful (Goddard et al., 2021; Jackman et al., 2019, 2021). Therefore, this model has 23 the potential to make meaningful progress in understanding the causal mechanisms 24 underpinning these rare and elusive states (e.g., Aherne et al., 2011). 25\nPresently, no validated measure of flow and/or clutch states, based on the Integrated 2 Model, exists2. Clutch states have only been reported recently (Swann et al., 2016, 2017a) so 3 no validated measure for this state has yet been developed. Clutch performance has been 4 studied using archival methods, interviews, mixed-methods, and experimental studies (see 5 Schweickle et al., 2020 for a systematic review). There is no established psychometric 6 measure of clutch performance, and experimental studies have generally used validated 7 measures of anxiety to assess pressure (Schweickle et al., 2020). As such, there is currently 8 no validated psychometric measure of clutch states or clutch performance. 9\nA number of validated measures of flow are used in sport and exercise, including the 10 Flow State Scale-2 (FSS-2; Jackson & Eklund, 2002), Flow Short Scale (Engeser & 11 Rheinberg, 2008), and Short and Core Flow Scales (Jackson et al., 2008). These existing 12 measures are based on Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s nine-dimensions framework of flow, which differs 13 from the Integrated Model\u2019s conceptualisation of this phenomenon. The differences in 14 conceptualisation are important because recent insights suggest that the nine-dimensions 15 framework conflates both flow and clutch states, as do measures based on the nine-16 dimensions framework, such as the FSS-2 (Swann et al., 2018). For example, Jackman et al. 17 (2017) reported that \u201cthe majority of FSS-2 items could represent the experience reported 18 during clutch states\u201d (p. 119). If that is the case, given the fundamental role the FSS-2 has 19 played in flow research (e.g., Moneta, 2021), \u201cquestions could be raised over much of the 20 knowledge of flow generated to date\u201d (Swann et al., 2018, p. 267) and the field could be 21 \u201cmoving towards a crisis point whereby it is difficult to confidently proceed with the 22 traditional nine-dimensions paradigm\u201d (Swann et al., 2018, p. 264). In order to move beyond 23\n2 Note: Schweickle et al. (2017) used a dichotomous measure of flow and clutch states. The scale had acceptable\npsychometric properties in that study, but did not undergo rigorous development or validation processes. Therefore, we do not consider it to be a validated, robust alternative.\nare needed. Such measures would enable testing and falsification of/support for the Integrated 2 Model, as well as critical examination of the concerns raised over the nine-dimensions 3 framework and accompanying questionnaires (Swann et al., 2018, 2021). Therefore, at this 4 stage of research on flow and clutch states in sport and exercise, it is important that measures 5 to test the Integrated Model are developed (Swann et al., 2021). 6 Aims 7 The purpose of this multi-study paper was to develop, and provide preliminary 8 evidence for the validity of, the Flow-Clutch Scale (FCS), which assesses the experience of 9\nflow and clutch states in sport and exercise. In Study 1, we aimed to develop an initial 10 version of the scale and assess its content validity using an expert panel. In Study 2, we 11 aimed to: (i) identify the most appropriate factor structure using exploratory factor analysis 12 (EFA); (ii) examine the scale\u2019s internal consistency; (iii) test if the new measure can 13 differentiate between individuals who experience flow, clutch, or neither; and (iv) assess 14 convergent validity. In Study 3, we aimed to confirm the Study 2 findings with a different 15 sample, using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the proposed factor structure. 16 Theoretical Grounding 17 In the development of a measure of flow and clutch states, we adopted a critical realist 18 approach. Specifically, this involves combing a realist ontology (i.e., there is a real world 19 independent of our constructions) with a constructivist epistemology (i.e., our knowledge of 20 this world is fallible, partial, and socially constructed) (Maxwell, 2012). For the purposes of 21 the current study, two important assumptions of critical realism should be highlighted. 22 Firstly, mental phenomena (i.e., flow and clutch states) are considered real, exist beyond our 23 constructions about them, and can be measured and tested (Maxwell, 2012). Secondly, a 24 critical approach is adopted in understanding and explaining phenomena (Sayer, 1992). In 25\nfurther refinement, we adopted a data-driven approach to measurement development (Swann 2 et al., 2021). Specifically, we first adopted EFA (Study 2) to examine the most appropriate 3 factor solution, and then aimed to check that solution using CFA (Study 3). This differs from 4 the development of other measures in this field, such as the FSS-2, which were based 5 explicitly on fitting the factors to the nine-dimensions framework using CFA (e.g., Jackson & 6 Eklund, 2002, 2004). 7 Study 1: Initial Development of the Flow-Clutch Scale 8 In Study 1 we aimed to develop an initial version of the scale, and assess its content 9\nvalidity using an expert panel. First, we reviewed the literature and drew upon the research 10 team\u2019s own conceptual knowledge (Anstiss et al., 2018) to identify key issues in the 11 measurement of flow and to establish core properties that this new questionnaire needed to 12 encompass. Second, items relating to flow and clutch states were developed and an initial 13 version of the scale was constructed. Lastly, to assess content validity, the items and scale 14 structure were reviewed by an expert panel - an important first step in scale development and 15 validation (e.g., Boateng et al., 2018). 16 Method 17 Issues in the Measurement of Flow 18 Existing flow questionnaires (FSS-2, Jackson & Eklund, 2004; Flow Short Scale, 19 Engeser & Rheinberg, 2008; Flow Questionnaire, Csikszentmihalyi & Larson, 1984) and 20 literature on measurement of flow (e.g., Moneta, 2021) were reviewed to inform the 21 development of this scale and identify limitations to address or avoid. First, and most 22 fundamental, was the need to address concerns over discriminant validity in existing flow 23 measures (e.g., Jackman et al., 2017) by developing a scale that could validly measure flow 24 or clutch states without conflating both (Swann et al., 2018). For this reason, we aimed to 25\nresponse patterns are obtained depending on whether the individual experienced flow, clutch, 2 or neither. 3 Second, it was necessary for the new scale to be able to identify whether individuals 4 experienced flow or clutch states (or neither). Studies have found that the most popular 5 measure of flow in sport and exercise, the FSS-2, is unable to distinguish between 6 participants who did, or did not, experience flow (Jackman et al., 2017; Kawabata & Evans, 7 20163). The FSS-2 conceptualises flow as a continuous variable and assumes that some 8 degree of flow was experienced, which means participants do not explicitly indicate whether 9\nor not they experienced flow (Moneta, 2021). This presumption is contradictory to other 10 findings that suggest flow is rare and elusive, and therefore unlikely to be experienced by 11 every participant on each occasion (Swann et al., 2018). As a result, Swann et al. (2018) 12 stated that \u201cit remains unclear as to whether the primary measure of flow can identify 13 participants who experience it, which is a concern given that much of the research in this 14 field is based on the FSS-2\u201d (p. 264). Therefore, it was important for the FCS to give 15 respondents the opportunity to identify whether they did or did not experience each state, 16 without assuming that some level of each state was experienced (Swann et al., 2021). 17 To address these issues, we focused on developing a scale that could assess both flow 18 and clutch states (i.e., a scale with one set of items, but different response patterns on those 19 items for each state). We sought to achieve this with an initial categorical variable/single-item 20\n3 Based on latent class factor analysis of FSS-2 responses, Kawabata and Evans (2016) suggested that a mean score of 3.4 or greater for the conditions of flow (i.e., challenge-skills balance, clear goals, unambiguous feedback) on the FSS-2 could indicate the occurrence of flow. However, by comparing responses on the FSS-2 to a categorical measure of flow, the Flow Questionnaire (Csikszentmihalyi & Larson, 1984), Jackman et al. (2017) reported that Kawabata and Evans\u2019 (2016) criterion for flow occurrence was satisfied in the majority (92%) of performances (n = 50), but positive responses to the Flow Questionnaire were only found in half of these performances. In turn, Jackman et al. (2017) concluded that the cut-off point suggested by Kawabata and Evans (2016) \u201cwas unable to differentiate individuals who did and did not experience flow\u201d (p. 118).\naimed to use a visual analogue scale to anchor the participant\u2019s responses to a specific section 2 of the activity when they experienced flow or clutch (i.e., rather than asking them to recall the 3 activity as a whole \u2013 see Appendix 1). Finally, we employed items that asked participants to 4 rate on a Likert scale the extent to which characteristics of flow or clutch states were 5 experienced during the specific sections identified. 6 Development of the Scale 7 Single-Item Descriptors. Single-item descriptors for flow and clutch were developed 8 to identify whether participants experienced either state during a specific activity. This 9\napproach is used in the Flow Questionnaire (Csikszentmihalyi & Larson, 1984), in which 10 participants are then asked to respond \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if they had a similar 11 experience (see Jackman et al., 2017 for use of the Flow Questionnaire in sport). This 12 approach was considered to be useful in terms of anchoring the participants\u2019 responses to 13 either flow or clutch states (rather than reflecting on the activity as a whole and potentially 14 conflating multiple states), and enabling them to state whether or not it was experienced in 15 the activity they had just completed (i.e., avoiding the assumption that flow or clutch was 16 experienced to some degree in every activity). 17 Single-items for flow and clutch were based on descriptions provided by athletes and 18 exercisers to date (Swann et al., 2016, 2017a, 2017b, 2019; Jackman, 2017). For flow, the 19 initial single-item description was: 20 At any point in this activity, did you experience a section that felt like you were on 21 autopilot, without needing to think about what you were doing, and feeling like it was 22 going well, as if everything was \u2018clicking into place\u2019? 23 For clutch, the initial single-item description was: 24\npressure, which had an important outcome, and you had to \u2018step it up\u2019 to make sure 2 you met the demands of that situation? 3 Visual Analogue Scale. A visual analogue scale was developed to ask participants to 4 identify when in the activity they experienced the respective state. The purpose of this visual 5 analogue scale was to: (i) anchor participants\u2019 subsequent item responses to specific sections 6 of the activity, rather than asking them to reflect on the activity as a whole (which, for 7 example, could mean they conflate flow and clutch states in their item responses); and (ii) 8 avoid assuming every respondent experienced flow or clutch states to some degree (as with 9\nthe FSS-2, for example). Based on the interview studies conducted to date (Jackman et al., 10 2017, 2019; Swann et al., 2016, 2017a, 2019), there is no evidence that flow and clutch states 11 can be experienced at the same time. Therefore, a visual analogue scale was used to check 12 where in the performance each state was reported to occur. If they were in the same place, 13 then it may indicate that the participants did not understand the single-item descriptors and/or 14 were conflating flow and clutch states (which could justify removal of those data). 15 The timeframe of the activity was presented in a visual analogue scale to help anchor 16 the participant\u2019s reflections/responses to one specific stage of the event. If the participant 17 responded \u2018yes\u2019, they were then asked to identify when in the activity it was experienced, 18 ranging from the beginning to the end (using the instruction: \u201cIf YES, please identify: (1) 19 where this experience began, and (2) where it ended\u201d). The following instruction was then 20 presented: Within the section of this activity that you identified above, please rate how much 21 you experienced each of the following items. 22 Development of Item Pool 23 The FCS questionnaire aimed to capture characteristics of flow and clutch states \u2013 24 including characteristics that overlapped both states - based on event-focused interview 25\n(Swann et al., 2019). An initial item pool based on the characteristics reported in these studies 2 was generated, including at least three items per characteristic, to reduce the potential for 3 weak items or multiple interpretations (e.g., Boateng et al., 2018), and to subsequently 4 identify and retain those that best measured the intended construct (Camir\u00e9 et al., 2021). This 5 process led to the development of 57 items. 6 Expert Review 7 In line with good practice for the development of psychological questionnaires (Clark 8 & Watson, 1995; Cronin & Allen, 2017), a panel of experts was asked to review the initial 9\nversion of the scale via email. Seven researchers who had published peer-reviewed journal 10 articles on flow and/or clutch states or clutch performance (n > 30 publications) were 11 recruited and asked to critically evaluate the single-item descriptors, the visual analogue 12 scale, and initial list of items. This step was conducted to obtain information on perceived 13 clarity and relevance, as well as highlighting any possible issues or missed items (e.g., 14 Anstiss et al., 2018). 15 These expert reviewers were provided with a document explaining the background, 16 aims, and rationale for the design of the questionnaire, followed by the single-item 17 descriptors of flow/clutch states, the visual analogue scale, and the initial list of items. For the 18 single-item descriptors, reviewers were asked how complete, relevant, clear, easy to 19 understand, and representative the description was of flow/clutch states, and to provide any 20 queries, concerns, or suggestions for improvement. For the visual analogue scale, reviewers 21 were asked how relevant, complete, and clear the instructions were, and to provide any 22 queries, concerns, or suggestions for improvement. For the initial item pool, reviewers were 23 asked to: (a) rate each item from \u2018poor\u2019 (1) to \u2018very good\u2019 (4) on its ability to measure the 24 characteristic; (b) comment on the suitability of the item (e.g., item wording and clarity, 25\nopportunity to make suggestions for improvement. Finally, each reviewer was asked to: 2 \u201cPlease provide general comments/feedback on the adequacy of this scale to measure 3 flow/clutch states in sport and exercise\u201d - in line with good practice in questionnaire 4 development (Anstiss et al., 2018; Beck & Gable, 2001). 5 Results 6 Feedback from the expert panel was largely consistent (i.e., none of the feedback was 7 strongly conflicting). This feedback was mainly about the wording of the single-item 8 descriptors, the instructions for the visual analogue scale, and the initial item pool. These 9\nchanges are described below. 10 Single-Item Descriptors. Based on reviewer feedback, changes were made to the 11 wording of the opening anchor questions for each state. The revised wording for the single 12 item for flow was: 13 At any point during this activity, did you feel like you were fully engaged in what you 14 were doing, that nothing else seemed to matter, and that the activity was going well 15 without requiring much thought, as if you were on autopilot? 16 The revised wording for the clutch item was: 17 At any point during this activity, did you feel that an important outcome was in the 18 balance, and you were aware of being under pressure, but you felt like you increased 19 your performance in that situation? 20 Visual Analogue Scale. Following reviewer feedback, minor changes were made to 21 the wording of instructions. The instructions were amended slightly to state: \u201cOn the line 22 below, please mark (1) to identify when in the activity this experience began, and mark (2) to 23 identify when it ended\u201d. The anchors on the visual analogue scale were also amended slightly 24 to state: \u201cbeginning of activity\u201d, \u201cmiddle of activity\u201d, and \u201cend of activity.\u201d 25\nthan 3 (Good), the item was removed or revised, and if any item received more than one 2 score of 1 (Poor) or 2 (Fair) across the experts, it was removed or revised. Reviewer 3 comments were also taken into account when removing/revising items and improving item 4 wording. During this process, the number of items was reduced from 57 to 55 items. 5 Directions and Response Format. After clarifying the single-item descriptors, and 6 selecting items to include within the scale, two further elements of the scale were decided: (1) 7 the directions given to respondents; and (2) the response format. The following directions 8 were developed for the scale items: \u201cBy marking X in the appropriate box, please rate how 9\nwell each of the following items correspond with your experience during the section of this 10 activity that you identified above\u201d. The authorship team selected a 6-point Likert scale with 11 the following anchors: 0 = Not at all; 1 = Not very; 2 = A little; 3 = Moderately; 4 = Very 12 much; and 5 = Completely. These anchors were designed to reflect the notion that flow and 13 clutch states vary in intensity, as well as ensuring respondents had an opportunity to indicate 14 that they did not experience any of the characteristics at all (i.e., through the anchor: 0 = Not 15 at all), which, again, avoided the assumption that respondents experienced these 16 characteristics to some degree. 17 Discussion 18 The development and expert review process in Study 1 led to an initial version of the 19 FCS that had acceptable content validity. This initial version of the scale consisted of: single-20 item descriptors for flow or clutch states; a visual analogue scale to denote where in the 21 activity the state was experienced; and a pool of 55 items. Importantly, this study indicated 22 that the initial version of the scale had content validity in that it had been assessed by seven 23 researchers who had published peer-reviewed academic studies on flow/clutch \u2013 in line with 24 best practice recommendations for questionnaire development (e.g., DeVellis, 2016). 25\nIn Study 2 we aimed to: (i) identify the most appropriate factor structure of the initial 2 version of the FCS through EFA; (ii) examine the measure\u2019s internal consistency; (iii) test if 3 the new measure can differentiate between individuals who experience flow, clutch, or 4 neither; and (iv) examine relationships with the FSS-2: specifically, we expected that all 5 factors of the FCS would be significantly correlated with the FSS-2, but that flow-specific 6 factors would demonstrate stronger correlations with FSS-2 dimensions than would clutch-7 specific factors. Consistent with our critical realist approach, and in line with good practice 8 for scale development (e.g., Cronin & Allen, 2017), we used EFA initially to ensure that our 9\nscale was data-driven (rather than confirming characteristics in the Integrated Model, through 10 initial CFA, for example). 11 Method 12 Participants 13 A sample of 280 participants were included in the EFA, consisting of 132 males 14 (47.1%) and 147 females (52.5%); one participant (0.4%) did not indicate their gender. The 15 mean age was 35.40 years (SD = 13.26; age range 18-67 years). Individuals from 15 different 16 countries participated in the study, of whom 75.64% were Australians. All participants were 17 English speaking. The most frequent sport and exercise activity was running (32.1%), 18 followed by: soccer (7.9%); hurling or camogie (traditional Irish sports, 7.5%); and 19 basketball (5%). Other activities represented less than 5% of the sample per sport. 20 Participants indicated that their standard of participation was recreational (45.7%), club 21 (24.3%), national (3.9%), regional (2.9%), university (2.5%), or international (2.5%), while 22 16.8% of the sample participated in exercise. Gorsuch (1983) recommended a participant to 23 item ratio of 5:1 for EFA, which was exceeded in this study. 24\nCommittee at an Australian university. Participants were recruited face-to-face through 2 sporting events, clubs and gymnasiums. Researchers attended sport and exercise activities 3 and events (after obtaining permission) and handed out questionnaires to participants as they 4 finished the activity \u2013 with the aim of ensuring completion of the scale as soon as possible 5 after completing the activity. After providing informed consent, participants completed a 6 short demographic questionnaire, the FSS-2, and the initial version of the FCS. Surveys were 7 completed, on average, 20.16 minutes after the activity (SD = 32.64; range = 1 - 240 8 minutes). Participants were provided with an overview of the research and asked if they 9\nwould like to voluntarily and anonymously complete the survey. Survey completion took 10 approximately 10 minutes. 11 Measures. A paper-based questionnaire booklet was prepared comprising the partici-12 pant information sheet, consent form, demographic information, the FSS-2, and the FCS. 13 Demographic Questionnaire. Demographic information was collected from 14 participants at the start of the questionnaire booklet. This information included: age; gender; 15 nationality; minutes since completing the activity; what activity was just completed; and 16 standard of participation. 17 Flow-Clutch Scale. The initial 55-item version of the FCS, as described in Study 1, 18 was employed in Study 2. The FCS was presented three times: one for flow (i.e., the single-19 item for flow plus all items); one for clutch (i.e., the single-item for clutch plus all items); and 20 one for participants who reported that they experienced neither flow nor clutch (i.e., with all 21 items). The directions provided were to: 22 Please answer the following questions in relation to your experience in the event or 23 activity you have just completed. These questions relate to the thoughts and feelings you 24 may have experienced while taking part. There are no right or wrong answers. Think 25\nrating scale below by marking X in the appropriate box. 2 All items were taken in each version of the questionnaire to allow another check of validity 3 (e.g., for clutch, the items for flow should have lower scores). The flow and clutch versions 4 were randomised. However, the FSS-2 was always presented first after the demographics 5 because the instructions were more general and presenting it after the FCS would potentially 6 have anchored the participants\u2019 responses differently4. 7 The \u2018neither\u2019 version of the FCS was taken last, and was to be completed if 8 participants responded \u2018no\u2019 to both the flow and clutch single item descriptors (see Study 1). 9\nThese participants would only provide the FSS-2 data and FCS items. The purpose of this 10 was to obtain FCS data from participants who reported that they experienced neither flow nor 11 clutch states, as a further check of construct validity (i.e., scores on this version of the scale 12 should be lower than those when participants report \u2018yes\u2019 to flow and/or clutch). The 13 instructions for the \u2018neither\u2019 version of the FCS were: 14 Please answer the following questions in relation to your experience in the event or 15 activity you have just completed. These questions relate to the thoughts and feelings 16 you may have experienced while taking part. There are no right or wrong answers. 17 Think about how you felt during the event/activity, then answer the questions using 18 the rating scale below by marking X in the appropriate box. 19\n4 To illustrate, the instructions for the FSS-2 are: Please answer the following questions in relation to your experience in the event or activity you have\njust completed. These questions relate to the thoughts and feelings you may have experienced while taking part. There are no right or wrong answers. Think about how you felt during the event/activity and answer the questions using the rating scale below. For each question circle the number that best matches your experience.\nThese instructions could have been biased after completion of the FCS which, in turn, would have been harmful to our comparisons with the FSS-2 for convergent validity.\nFlow/Clutch/Neither Questions (FCNQ). 2 FSS-2. The FSS-2, developed by Jackson and Eklund (2002), is a self-report 3 questionnaire that conceptualises flow based on the nine-dimensions framework. The scale 4 contains 36 items (four per dimension) and is rated on a 5-point Likert type scale from 1 5 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Participants complete the questionnaire as soon as 6 possible after an activity. The FSS-2 has strong internal consistency with alpha coefficients 7 for each of the nine dimensions ranging from 0.80 \u2013 0.90 (Jackson & Eklund, 2002). 8 Statistical Analysis 9\nExamination of the data prior to analysis indicated that the variables were normally 10 distributed. Ten outliers were identified by converting the data to z-scores (i.e., > 3.29 or < -11 3.29; Field, 2018). However, after conducting analyses with outliers adjusted and unadjusted, 12 no difference was found in levels of significance and effect size interpretations. Due to all 13 outliers being possible scores, and there being so few of them, they were retained for 14 analyses. 15 Flow/Clutch/Neither Questions (FCNQ). Prior to EFA, the FCS items derived from 16 Study 1 were assessed to determine whether they could distinguish participants reporting 17 flow, clutch, or neither state, based on responses to the single item descriptors (i.e., the 18 FCNQ). Robust Welch ANOVAs were used to overcome any issues of heterogeneity of 19 variance and unequal sample sizes. Only FCS items that were found to significantly differ 20 between FCNQ groups (p < .05), regardless of specific differences, were included in the EFA 21 (effect sizes for excluded items were < .02, and for included items were >.02). This resulted 22 in 41 items that significantly differentiated the FCNQ groups. 23 Factor Structure. EFA with principal axis factoring (PAF) and an oblique rotation 24 (direct oblimin) were conducted on the FCS data using IBM SPSS (Version 26). EFA was 25\ndevelop a scale which measures a latent variable (Fabrigar et al., 1999). PAF was chosen as it 2 determines latent constructs and is less sensitive to issues of normality (Fabrigar et al., 1999). 3 An oblique rotation was chosen as it produces a more accurate result with correlated factors 4 (Costello & Osborne, 2005). Parallel analysis was used to indicate the number of factors to 5 retain (O'Connor, 2000). Items that loaded above 0.320 (cross loading), communalities below 6 .40, and loadings below .45 were scrutinised (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). The weakest items 7 were removed one at a time until all items met the set criteria. 8 Convergent Validity. Convergent validity assesses how well a scale correlates with 9\nan existing, validated tool measuring a similar construct (Boateng et al., 2018). Correlations 10 between measures at .1 are considered small, .3 is medium, and .5 is large (Field, 2018). To 11 assess the convergent validity of the FCS, a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient 12 was computed between the FCS and the FSS-2. 13 Internal Consistency Reliability. To measure the internal consistency of items 14 within each subscale, Cronbach\u2019s (1951) alpha was calculated for each factor retained. 15 Values over .7 are considered acceptable (Hair et al., 2016; Kline, 2000). 16 Results 17 The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO) was .907, 18 identifying the data as appropriate for EFA. Table 1 shows the final solution based on the 19 criteria described above. This factor structure explained 59.66% of the variance in the data. 20 Factors 5 and 6 contained only two items. Due to instability of factors with less than 3 items 21 (Costello & Osborne, 2005), these factors were not analysed further. All Cronbach\u2019s alpha 22\nscores for the five remaining factors were above the value of 0.70 ( = 0.767 \u2013 0.921), 23\nindicating acceptable internal consistency (Hair et al., 2016; Kline, 2000). 24 INSERT TABLE 1 HERE 25\nwere performed comparing the FCNQ groups. Approximately normal distributions were 2 found for all factors. Heterogeneity of variances was discovered for factors 1 and 7 using 3 Levene\u2019s test (p = .001 and p = .018 respectively). Due to uneven sample sizes (Flow: n = 4 172; Clutch: n = 37; Neither: n = 71), Welch\u2019s robust test was used to compare mean scores 5 of groups. Figure 2 shows the mean scores of the FCNQ groups for each factor. Table 2 6 provides the ANOVA statistics, including effect sizes, for these comparisons. All ANOVAs 7 were statistically significant with moderate effect sizes (Cohen, 1988). 8 Games-Howell post hoc tests (due to heterogeneity of variances) revealed that for 9\nfactor 1 the Flow group scored significantly higher than both the Clutch group (p = .039, 95% 10 CI [0.02, 0.76]) and the Neither group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.35, 0.98]), suggesting that factor 11 1 comprised items specific to flow. For factor 7, the Flow group was significantly higher than 12 the Neither group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.42, 1.04]). The Clutch group was not significantly 13 different to the Neither group but this result was marginal (p = .056, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.96]), 14 suggesting that factor 7 may represent overlapping items. Tukey\u2019s post hoc test was used for 15 all other comparisons. For factor 2, the Clutch group scored significantly higher than both the 16 Flow group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.28, 1.13]) and the Neither group (p = .002, 95% CI [0.21, 17 1.16]), suggesting that this factor comprised items specific to clutch. For factor 3, the Flow 18 group scored significantly higher than the Neither group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.35, 1.14]), 19 however this factor did not appear to differentiate between flow versus clutch, nor 20 differentiate between clutch and neither, suggesting it may not have had strong construct 21 validity. For factor 4, the Flow group scored significantly higher than both the Clutch group 22 (p = .004, 95% CI [0.19, 1.23]) and the Neither group (p = .002, 95% CI [0.19, 1.00]), 23 suggesting that this factor comprised items specific to flow. All other comparisons were non-24 significant (p > .05). 25"

            "text": "All but one pair of factors were found to correlate significantly and positively, as 3 shown in Table 3. Factors 2 and 4 were not significantly correlated. Correlation effect sizes 4 were interpreted using Cohen\u2019s conventions (1988). Significant correlations were deemed to 5 have moderate to large effect sizes in all cases, besides the correlations between factor 2 and 6 factors 1 and 3, which were small to moderate. These correlations provided further indicators 7 of construct validity. Specifically, the factors appearing to measure flow (factors 1, 3 and 4) 8 had stronger correlations with each other, and with factor 7, than with the factor appearing to 9\nmeasure clutch (factor 2). The clutch factor (factor 2) had stronger correlations with factor 7 10 than the apparent flow factors (factor 1, 3 and 4), which further suggested that factor 7 may 11 comprise overlapping items. 12 INSERT TABLE 3 HERE 13 Correlations between the FCS factors and FSS-2 are shown in Table 4. Correlations 14 ranged from small, in six cases non-significant, up to large. Specifically, factor 1 had 15 significant correlations with all 9 of the FSS-2 dimensions, and \u2013 with the exception of time 16 transformation - these correlations were mostly moderate-strong, which further supports 17 factor 1 as comprising flow-specific items. Factor 2 was not significantly correlated with 3 of 18 the 9 FSS-2 dimensions: action-awareness merging, loss of self-consciousness, and sense of 19 control. There were also smaller correlations (than was the case for factor 1) for 5 of the 6 20 significantly correlated FSS-2 dimensions. These findings further suggest that factor 2 21 comprises items specific to clutch states. Factor 3 was not significantly correlated with 3 of 22 the 9 FSS-2 dimensions (clear goals, unambiguous feedback, and loss of self-consciousness) 23 despite findings above indicating that it should be a flow factor. This finding raised further 24 doubt over the construct validity of factor 3. Factor 4 was significantly correlated with all 9 25\nsignificantly correlated with all 9 FSS-2 dimensions, which further suggested that it should be 2 retained for further testing as a factor comprising overlapping items. 3 INSERT TABLE 4 HERE 4 These findings suggested that factors 1 and 4 represented items specific to flow, and 5 that factor 2 represented items specific to clutch. The items in factor 1 generally represented 6 characteristics of flow states (i.e., feeling in control, positive feedback), although there were 7 some exceptions worth noting: (i) one item (\u201cI was very aware of what I needed to do in that 8 situation\u201d) represented heightened awareness, which is a characteristic of clutch states 9\naccording to the Integrated Model; (ii) four items represented automatic skill execution, 10 which is a characteristic proposed by the model to be overlapping both states; and (iii) one 11 item (\u201cI believed that I could achieve what I wanted in this situation\u201d) represented 12 confidence, which is a characteristic that is proposed by the Integrated Model to be 13 overlapping both states. All items in factor 2 represent characteristics specific to clutch states 14 in the model (i.e., analytical thought, exerting control, specific goals). All items in factor 4 15 represent a characteristic specific to flow in the model (i.e., ease/reduced perceptions of 16 effort). 17 Factor 3 contained items representing the characteristic altered perceptions which, 18 according to the model, is overlapping for both states. The ANOVA suggested that the flow 19 group scored significantly higher than the neither group; however, this factor did not 20 distinguish between flow versus clutch, nor clutch versus neither. Furthermore, the results of 21 Study 2 suggested that this factor was more strongly related to flow \u2013 yet it did not correlate 22 well with the FSS-2 dimensions. Overall, therefore, factor 3 was considered to have low 23 construct validity and was not included in the revised version of the scale. 24\nfocus/concentration5). The ANOVA found that the flow group reported significantly higher 2 scores than the neither group. Although the results for clutch versus neither were not 3 significant, this finding was marginal. Furthermore, factor 7 was significantly correlated with 4 all nine FSS-2 dimensions (unlike factor 3), and the between-factor correlations further 5 indicated that this could represent items which overlapped both states. Therefore, factor 7 6 was retained for further testing as a potential overlapping factor. This left a 4-factor, 22-item 7 version of the FCS for further testing in Study 3. Based on the above, the factors were 8 conceptualised as: factor 1 = characteristics of flow; factor 2 = characteristics of clutch; 9\nfactor 4 = effortlessness of flow; and factor 7 = overlapping characteristics. 10 Discussion 11 This study provided preliminary evidence for the validity of a 22-item, 4-factor 12 version of the FCS. Building on Study 1, which provided evidence of content validity, Study 13 2 provided evidence for construct validity in that the single-item descriptors were able to 14 distinguish between participants who experienced flow, clutch or neither, with corresponding 15 scores on each factor as would be expected according to the Integrated Model. Study 2 also 16 established factorial validity in that the factor structure makes sense in relation to the 17 Integrated Model (i.e., with factors specific to flow, factors specific to clutch, and an 18 overlapping factor). These factors had acceptable internal consistency reliability. Finally, 19 Study 2 provided evidence of expected relationships with the FSS-2 which were in line with 20 expected predictions from the Integrated Model (e.g., more/stronger correlations for flow 21 factors; fewer/weaker correlations for clutch factors). 22\n5 In the Integrated Model, effortless attention is a characteristic of flow, whereas effortful concentration is a characteristic of clutch. Both of these represent attention/concentration, for which there were 3 items in factor 7.\ncharacteristics in the model were accounted for by this solution, although there are some 2 minor differences (noted above). There are a number of possible explanations for these slight 3 differences, including: (i) the model itself is tentative and still evolving; (ii) the data-driven, 4 rather than model/theory-driven, approach to scale development that we adopted; (iii) the 5 items may have been interpreted in multiple ways, or differently than intended; and (iv) 6 differences may have been due to context (e.g., sport versus exercise). Overall, these results 7 were promising in terms of developing a scale that can discriminate between the most 8 prominent features of flow and clutch states. Moving forward, it is important to test/refine 9\nboth the model and the scale - indeed, the scale is likely to evolve over time as scale 10 development is an ongoing process (DeVellis, 2016; Cronin & Allen, 2017). The most 11 important step at this stage is the development and validation of a scale that is largely in line 12 with the Integrated Model, in order to begin addressing issues in both the Integrated Model 13 and the nine-dimensions framework (Swann et al., 2018, 2021). As such, we considered the 14 solution identified in Study 2 to be a reasonable way forward, despite minor differences 15 compared to the Integrated Model. Overall, therefore, Study 2 provided preliminary evidence 16 for the validity of a 22-item, 4-factor FCS in sport and exercise. Next, it was important to 17 confirm the factor structure of each subscale and the full scale, and relationships with the 18 FSS-2, with another sample. 19 Study 3 20 In Study 3 we aimed to confirm the Study 2 findings, using CFA to test the proposed 21 factor structure in a different sample of participants. Specifically, in Study 3 we aimed to 22 confirm: (i) the factor structure identified in Study 2; (ii) internal consistency reliability; and 23 (iii) relationships with the FSS-2. As with Study 2, we expected that all FCS factors would be 24 significantly correlated with the nine FSS-2 dimensions, but that flow-specific factors of the 25\nspecific factors. 2 Method 3 Participants 4 A sample of 264 participants were included in the CFA, consisting of 124 males 5 (47.0%) and 134 females (50.8%). Six participants (2.2%) did not indicate their gender. The 6 mean age was 36.40 years (SD = 13.46; age range 18-69 years). Individuals from 18 different 7 countries participated in the study, 77.65% were Australians. All participants were English 8 speaking. The most frequent sport and exercise activity was running (35.2%), followed by 9\nAustralian Rules Football (6.4%) and soccer (6.1%). Other activities represented less than 5% 10 of the sample per sport. Participants reported that their standard of participation was 11 recreational (39.0%), club (28.0%), national (1.9%), regional (4.2%), university (1.1%), or 12 international (1.1%), while 21.2% of the sample participated in exercise. 13 Procedure. Ethics approval was received from the Human Research Ethics 14 Committee at an Australian university. Participants were recruited face-to-face through 15 sporting events, clubs, and gymnasiums. As in Study 2, researchers attended sport and 16 exercise activities and events (after obtaining permission) and handed out questionnaires to 17 participants as they finished the activity \u2013 with the aim of ensuring completion as soon as 18 possible after completing the activity. After providing informed consent, participants 19 completed a short demographic questionnaire, the FSS-2, and the initial version of the FCS. 20 Surveys were completed, on average, 18.25 minutes after the activity (SD = 21.62; range = 1 21 - 120 minutes). Participants were provided with an overview of the research and asked if they 22 would like to voluntarily and anonymously complete the survey. Survey completion took 23 approximately 10 minutes. 24 Statistical Analysis 25\ndistributed. Seven outliers were identified by converting the data to z-scores (i.e., > 3.29 or < 2 -3.29; Field, 2018). However, similar to Study 2, after conducting analyses with outliers 3 adjusted and unadjusted, no difference was found in levels of significance and effect size 4 interpretations. Again, due to all outliers being possible scores, and there being so few of 5 them, they were retained for analyses. 6 Factor Structure. CFA was conducted to confirm the factor structure of the FCS 7 identified in Study 2 using IBM SPSS Amos (Version 26). Following the recommendations 8 of Kline (2016), the Chi square test results, the root mean square error of approximation 9\n(RMSEA) with 90% confidence intervals, the comparative fit index (CFI), and the 10 standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) were used to assess model fit. Suggested cut-11 off scores for these model fit indices are as follows: Chi square test: p > .05 = good model fit 12 (although often significant with large samples); RMSEA \u2264 .05 = good fit, .05 to .08 = 13 reasonable fit, \u2265 .10 = poor fit; CFI \u2265 .95 = good fit, .90 to .95 = reasonable fit; SRMR < .10 14 = favourable (Kline, 2016). 15 Internal Consistency Reliability. Internal consistency was assessed using the same 16 method outlined in Study 2. Cronbach\u2019s (1951) alpha was calculated for each factor retained 17 in the final solution. 18 Results 19 CFA was conducted on the 22-item FCS6, as shown in Figure 3 (see Supplementary 20 File for a table of correlations between all items in the FCS). As was the case in Study 2, 21 factors 2 (clutch) and 3 (effortlessness) were identified as being not significantly correlated (r 22 = .09, p = .273). As a result, this correlation was removed from the model. All other 23\n6 Note: Study 2 referred to the four remaining factors as 1, 2, 4 and 7. Here the four factors are referred to as 1, 2, 3 and 4.\nfactor solution was found to have a significant Chi Square goodness of fit test, 2(204) = 2\n664.17, p < .001, which is often the case in large samples (Kline, 2016). Model fit indices 3 were reported as: RMSEA [90% confidence intervals] = .095 [.087, .103]; CFI = .841; SRMR 4 = .083. While SRMR was favourable, it should be noted that RMSEA and CFI were outside 5 the suggested ranges for reasonable model fit (Kline, 2016). Similar to Study 2, all 6 Cronbach\u2019s alpha scores were above the value of 0.70 (r = 0.769 \u2013 0.914) suggested by Hair 7 et al. (2010), indicating acceptable internal consistency reliability. Overall, these results 8 suggest the four-factor solution is a reasonable starting point - albeit with imperfect model fit 9\n- and represents preliminary evidence of progress towards the validation of the FCS. Table 5 10 presents the items, factors, means, standard deviations, and Cronbach\u2019s alphas of the Flow 11 Clutch Scale. 12 INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE 13 INSERT TABLE 5 HERE 14 To assess the replicability of the analyses run in Study 2, one-way between groups 15 ANOVAs were performed comparing the FCNQ groups. Approximately normal distributions 16 were found for all factors. Heterogeneity of variances was discovered for factors 1 (flow) and 17 4 (overlapping) with Levene\u2019s test (p = .031 and p < .001 respectively). Due to uneven 18 sample sizes (Flow: n = 159; Clutch: n = 53; Neither: n = 52), Welch\u2019s robust test was used 19 to compare mean scores of groups. Figure 4 shows the mean scores of the FCNQ groups for 20 each factor. Table 6 provides the ANOVA statistics, including effect sizes, for these 21 comparisons. All ANOVAs were statistically significant with moderate-to-large effect sizes 22 (Cohen, 1988). Games-Howell post hoc tests (due to heterogeneity of variances) revealed that 23 for factor 1 (flow), the Flow group scored significantly higher than both the Clutch group (p 24 < .001, 95% CI [0.23, 0.85]) and the Neither group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.36, 1.03]) and for 25\n(p < .001, 95% CI [-0.47, -1.10]) and the Clutch group (p < .001, 95% CI [-0.24, -0.99]). 2 Tukey\u2019s post hoc test was used for all other comparisons. The Clutch group scored 3 significantly higher than both the Flow group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.29, 0.99]) and the Neither 4 group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.39, 1.25]) on factor 2 (clutch), and the Flow group scored 5 significantly higher than both the Clutch group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.68, 1.51]) and the 6 Neither group (p < .001, 95% CI [0.61, 1.50]) on factor 3 (effortlessness). All other 7 comparisons were non-significant (p > .05). Thus, the results from Study 2 were largely 8 replicated here in Study 3. The only comparison that differed in significance in relation to 9\nStudy 2 was factor 4 (overlapping) - where the Clutch group failed to reach significance in 10 Study 2, this group was found to significantly differ from the Neither group in Study 3. This 11 finding provides further support for factor 4 representing overlapping items. 12 INSERT FIGURE 4 HERE 13 INSERT TABLE 6 HERE 14 All but one pair of FCS factors were found to have significant positive correlations, as 15 shown in Table 7. Factors 2 (clutch) and 3 (effortlessness) were not correlated. Significant 16 correlations were deemed to have moderate to large effect sizes in all cases besides the 17 correlations between factor 2 and factors 1 and 4, respectively, which were small-to-18 moderate. Specifically, factor 1 had a smaller correlation with factor 2 (clutch), and larger 19 correlations with factors 3 (effortlessness) and 4 (overlapping). These findings further support 20 factor 1 as representing characteristics of flow. Factor 2 had no correlation with factor 3, 21 which is to be expected given that clutch states are described as effortful whereas factor 3 22 captures ease/effortlessness. Small correlations between factor 2 and factor 1 (flow), and a 23 moderate correlation with factor 4 (overlapping) were in line with what would be expected of 24 a clutch factor. Factor 1 had larger correlations with factors 3 and 4, further indicating this to 25\nsupports it representing overlapping items. 2 INSERT TABLE 7 HERE 3 Correlations between the FCS factors and FSS-2 are shown in Table 8. Correlations 4 here range from small, in one case non-significant, up to large. Specifically, factor 1 (flow) 5 had stronger correlations with the FSS-2 dimensions than factor 2 (clutch), which is as 6 expected. Factor 2 was not correlated with loss of self-consciousness which makes sense in 7 that clutch states are reported to involve analytical thought rather than loss of self-8 consciousness. Factor 2 also had weaker correlations with FSS-2 dimensions than most other 9\nfactors which is consistent with it being a clutch factor. Factor 3 was significantly correlated 10 with all FSS-2 dimensions which supports this as a flow factor. Factor 4 was also 11 significantly correlated with all FSS-2 dimensions, and the correlations were moderate to 12 large, which supports the relevance of this to flow. 13 INSERT TABLE 8 HERE 14 Discussion 15 Study 3 confirmed the 22 item, four factor solution of the FCS. CFA provided 16 confirmation that the four-factor solution is a reasonable starting point, albeit with imperfect 17 model fit. This study also confirmed that the four factors, and the scale overall, had 18 acceptable internal consistency reliability. ANOVAs provided confirmation of construct 19 validity, in that: factors 1 and 3 were significantly higher for those in flow versus clutch or 20 neither; factor 2 was significantly higher for those in clutch versus flow or neither; and factor 21 4 was significantly higher for both flow and clutch versus neither. Indeed, these were stronger 22 results than in Study 2 (where factor 4 was not significantly different between clutch and 23 neither). Finally, Study 3 confirmed relationships with the FSS-2. Factors 1, 3 and 4 were 24 significantly correlated with all FSS-2 dimensions, while factor 2 was not significantly 25\ncorrelations compared to the other factors \u2013 as would be expected for a clutch factor. Overall, 2 Study 3 confirmed Study 2 findings and provided further evidence for preliminary validation 3 of the four-factor, 22 item FCS. 4 General Discussion 5 The purpose of this research was to develop a scale to assess participants\u2019 experiences 6 of flow or clutch states in sport and exercise. The studies described above led to the 7 development of the 22 item FCS, which measures four factors: characteristics of flow; 8 characteristics of clutch; effortlessness of flow; and overlapping characteristics. The FCS and 9\nits instructions are provided in Appendix 1. Three separate studies provided preliminary 10 evidence for the validity of the FCS. Study 1 provided evidence for the content validity of the 11 items and structure selected for the initial version of the scale. Study 2 refined the scale to 22 12 items using EFA, and provided initial evidence of the factor structure and internal 13 consistency reliability of the FCS, as well as examining relationships with the FSS-2. Study 3 14 confirmed the factor structure through CFA, as well as internal consistency reliability and 15 correlations with the FSS-2, with a different sample. Combined, these studies provided 16 preliminary evidence for the content, construct, and factorial validity of the FCS in sport and 17 exercise, as well as internal consistency reliability and relationships with the FSS-2. As this is 18 the first validated scale based on the Integrated Model of Flow and Clutch States, the FCS 19 could make a valuable contribution to the field, in both testing propositions of the model, as 20 well as examining criticisms raised over the nine-dimensions framework and existing 21 questionnaires (Jackman et al., 2017; Swann et al, 2018). 22 An important aspect of the FCS is that it focused on the key distinguishing features of 23 flow and clutch states, and the initial evidence was broadly in line with the Integrated Model. 24 Our results evidence the construct validity of the FCS as it contains flow-specific items, 25\ncharacteristics of flow and clutch states (Swann et al., 2017a, 2019). This research provides 2 the first psychometrically robust, quantitative support for core propositions of the Integrated 3 Model, which, was developed based on qualitative data. Results of the EFA and CFA were in 4 line with the Integrated Model as they provided support for the presence of two distinct 5 states, which also shared some overlapping characteristics. A crucial strength of this research 6 was the adoption of a data-driven (rather than theory/model-driven) approach to scale 7 development, which is consistent with the critical realist approach that underpinned the 8 development of the Integrated Model. As noted below, these studies have also raised 9\nquestions \u2013 regarding both the FCS and the Integrated Model \u2013 that require further testing 10 and could lead to refinements. However, preliminary validation of the FCS provides a key 11 step forward and may help researchers move beyond the \u2018crisis point\u2019 in flow research 12 discussed by Swann et al. (2018) due to conceptual issues in the nine-dimensions framework 13 and core measures associated with it (e.g., the FSS-2). 14 Limitations and Future Directions 15 As with any study, there are limitations in this research and a number of important 16 future directions. Validity and reliability are considered ongoing processes (DeVellis, 2016), 17 so it is important that future studies continue to test and provide further evidence for, or 18 refine/improve, the validity and reliability of the FCS. First, the number of participants who 19 reported experiencing clutch states was lower in studies 2 and 3 than was the case for flow. It 20 is important to test the properties of the FCS in larger samples of participants who reported 21 experiencing clutch states. Specifically, to understand these differences, future studies should 22 examine the frequency of flow versus clutch states in sport versus exercise (e.g., do sport 23 participants experience clutch more frequently than exercisers?), across levels of expertise 24 (e.g., do higher level participants experience clutch more frequently than beginners or 25\nWestern cultures?). Second, and relatedly, the samples in studies 2 and 3 were English 2 speaking, adults, primarily Australian, and mostly recreational. Future work examining the 3 properties of the FCS, and the occurrence of flow and clutch states more generally, is needed 4 across levels of expertise, age groups (e.g., youths), and in other cultures. Such work (e.g., in 5 non-English speaking cultures) would also necessitate translation of the FCS into other 6 languages. Third, although a broad range of sports/forms of exercise were included in these 7 samples, there are others which were not \u2013 so the validity and reliability of this scale should 8 be tested in other activities and performance domains in future studies (such as dance and 9\nmusic). Fourth, it should be noted that two other factors in Study 2 (factors 5 and 6 \u2013 see 10 Table 1) were potentially relevant but were removed due to insufficient items. Although 11 preliminary evidence has been provided here for a 4-factor, 22-item scale, future studies 12 should seek to test whether the addition of more factors/items could improve the 13 psychometric properties of the FCS and, in particular, indices of model fit including RMSEA 14 and CFI. Fifth, future research should seek to refine the single-item descriptors and use of the 15 visual analogue scale within the FCS. The single-item descriptors for flow and clutch states 16 are multi-faceted and are, therefore, double-barrelled questions. On the visual analogue scale, 17 respondents who indicated they experienced both flow and clutch states at the same time in 18 the activity were assumed to either not understand the single-item questions, or to have 19 conflated both states. Future studies should test whether alternative approaches, which avoid 20 these issues, can be developed. 21 The FCS generally aligns well with the Integrated Model, however it is important to 22 note that some items did not align as precisely as would be expected. According to the 23 Integrated Model, one item in factor 1 (which represents characteristics of flow) should have 24 aligned with clutch states instead as it refers to heightened awareness (\u201cI was very aware of 25\nexecution and confidence which, according to the Integrated Model, are overlapping 2 characteristics rather than specific to flow. Similarly, factor 4 (representing overlapping 3 characteristics) includes items representing attention/concentration, whereas the Integrated 4 Model differentiates between effortless attention as a characteristic of flow, and effortful 5 concentration in clutch states. It is therefore necessary that future studies critically examine 6 both the FCS and the Integrated Model to work towards a consolidated understanding of the 7 characteristics of each state (i.e., moving beyond the Integrated Model\u2019s infancy to a more 8 mature conceptualisation of flow and clutch states, with which the FCS corresponds). 9\nFuture research should also seek to compare the FCS against other flow 10 questionnaires such as the Flow Short Scale (Engeser & Rheinberg, 2008) and the Short and 11 Core Flow Scales (Jackson et al., 2008), and other constructs (e.g., intrinsic motivation, 12 stress/anxiety, telic/paratelic states) to test convergent and discriminant validity. It is also 13 important to test the predictive validity of the FCS, in terms of its ability to predict outcomes 14 such as performance, enjoyment, and wellbeing. Similarly, future research should seek to 15 further test the reliability of the FCS, for example, test-retest reliability. Mixed-method 16 studies could be conducted to supplement the FCS data with an interview about the same 17 experience to examine the participant\u2019s experience of the relevant state, and their perceptions 18 of the FCS. One example would be to use the think aloud protocol (e.g., Gardner et al., 2020) 19 while completing the FCS to better understand participants\u2019 perceptions of how well it 20 captures each state. 21 Conclusion 22 Overall, this series of studies has developed and provided preliminary validation of 23 the FCS in sport and exercise. This scale is consistent with the core propositions of the 24 Integrated Model of Flow and Clutch States, including the expected relationships with 25\nFCS may be useful for researchers and practitioners seeking to measure and differentiate 2 between flow and clutch states in sport and exercise. That said, scale development is an 3 ongoing process (e.g., DeVellis, 2016), and further testing and refinement of both the Flow 4 Clutch Scale and the Integrated Model is needed in future studies. 5 References 6 Aherne, C., Moran, A.
