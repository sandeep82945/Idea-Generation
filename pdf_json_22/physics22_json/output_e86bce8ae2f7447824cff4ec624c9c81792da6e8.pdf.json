    "abstractText": "The wall, made of ferromagnetic steel, of a nuclear reactor pressure vessel is covered by an austenitic (very weakly ferromagnetic) cladding. In this work, we investigated how the base material and the cladding can be inspected separately from each other by nondestructive magnetic measurements. It was found that with the proper choice of the magnetizing yoke, these two different materials could be measured independently of each other. The effect of the yoke\u2019s size was studied by the numerical simulation of magnetic flux, pumped into the material during magnetic measurements. Measurements were performed by two different sizes of yokes on pure base material, on base material under cladding and on cladding itself. Experiments verified the results of the simulation. Our results can help for the future practical application of magnetic methods in the regular inspection of nuclear power plants.",

Introduction\nIn almost all major industrial countries worldwide today, nuclear power plants (NPPs) are used to generate electricity. However, the Fukushima Daiichi accident affected the nuclear energy renaissance and, since then, safety aspects have been significantly strengthened. For many existing NPPs, lifetime extensions to 40, 50, 60 or even 80 years have been requested [1]. The long-term operation of existing NPPs has already been accepted in many countries as a strategic objective to ensure adequate supply of electricity over the coming decades. Operating conditions that affect the design lifetime include neutron exposure (fluence), as well as the number and magnitude of temperature and/or pressure cycles in both normal conditions and hypothetical accidental conditions [2,3]. License renewal and periodic safety reviews (PSRs) are the two basic regulatory approaches that are required for an authorization of the long-term operation of NPPs [1]. Evaluation of these parameters during the PSRs allows for an estimation of the operational lifetime of NPPs [2]. As a result of the above arguments, the regular inspection of nuclear power plants is an extremely important task, because the mechanical properties of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) wall are modified during its operation mainly due to the long-term and high-energy neutron irradiation [4]. In boiling water pressurized reactors, the most critical and most important part is the reactor pressure vessel, because it is not changeable during the whole period of operation. Apart from the standard destructive tests (mechanical Charpy impact testing [5]) several nondestructive electromagnetic methods have been suggested recently for determination of neutron irradiation-generated embrittlement of the pressure vessel steel material. The precise measurement of the Seebeck coefficient makes it possible to derive the neutron irradiation-induced embrittlement of RPV material [6,7]. An ultrasonic technique is also widely used in the inspection of NPPs [8\u201310].\nMaterials 2022, 15, 1425. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15041425 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 1425 2 of 12\nThe RPV material is ferromagnetic steel, so magnetic methods are useful for this inspection. An overview of nondestructive magnetic methods are given in References [11,12]. The magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN) technique was developed for inspection of residual stresses, surface defects and microstructure changes [13\u201316]. Another method, magnetoacoustic emission, can also be frequently used for the monitoring of residual stresses [17]. A correlation exists between the modification of the microstructure of the material, generated by different effects, and the observed magnetic behavior if the material is influenced by a magnetic field. This phenomenon can be used to characterize the ferromagnetic materials via magnetic hysteresis measurement. Dislocation movement and domain wall motion are both affected by the microstructure of the material. In ferromagnetic materials, the correlation between mechanical and magnetic hardness is well-known and understood [18,19]. Magnetic methods are advantageous because they are not expensive, are technically simple, and they can be used easily, even on active materials. One of them, the so-called 3MA approach (3MA = micromagnetic, multiparameter, microstructure and stress analysis) applies several methods [20\u201322], and it was found suitable for the characterization of the damage in ferromagnetic materials like RPV steels and for monitoring the progress of materials. Another method of magnetic nondestructive testing is the measurement of the magnetic hysteresis loops. For instance, the so-called magnetic minor loops power scaling laws (PSL) were developed, whereby different parameters of minor hysteresis loops are used for material characterization [23]. A similar method, magnetic adaptive testing, also measures systematically minor magnetic hysteresis loops. This is also a multi-parametric, powerful and sensitive method of magnetic inspection [24]. As a conclusion of these works, a reasonable correlation could be found between the destructively measured parameters and nondestructively measured magnetic characteristics through application of these methods. This fact makes possible the future potential use of magnetic methods in the inspection of RPVs\u2019 structural integrity. In several previous works [16,20,25\u201327] irradiated Charpy samples were measured using magnetic methods, and results of magnetic measurements were compared with the destructively measured ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT). However, for the full inspection of nuclear reactors, blocks cut from RPV steel should be also measured, not only samples of Charpy geometry. This aspect of the inspection of a nuclear reactor\u2019s integrity has still not been extensively investigated. If the base material itself is directly measured, magnetic measurement is easy. However, in RPV, the base material (ferromagnetic steel) is covered by a cladding. This cladding, which is made of austenitic steel, is the integral component of a WWER 440-type nuclear reactor pressure vessel. Its role is to warrant an anticorrosive protection for the vessel material. Cladding is about a 10 mm thick stainless steel weld-overlay, which is deposited on the pressure vessel\u2019s inner surface. It shields the base metal of the pressure vessel from the corrosive environment produced by primary light water coolant [28]. Cladding in WWER 440 reactors is made by submerged arc welding technology by using strip electrodes. The surface of the cladding is either ground or machined roughly to ensure ultrasonic testing coupling. For future inspection of nuclear reactors, a tool should be developed that is suitable for non-destructive evaluation of the embrittlement of the vessel wall. The final system should be capable of inspecting the degradation of the microstructure through the cladding. The first step has been made in this direction: cladded blocks were successfully measured even through the cladding [29] via the magnetic adaptive testing method [24]. In this work, cladded RPV blocks were investigated, which had been treated thermally by a step cooling procedure, which caused embrittlement of the material. It was demonstrated that the base material degradation could be followed by magnetic measurements even through the cladding. It was shown that a reliable, nearly linear correlation existed between magnetic parameters and DBTT, as expected. In this type of investigation, when base material is measured through the cladding, the main problem for the magnetic measurement is that cladding means a thick, almost\nMaterials 2022, 15, 1425 3 of 12\nnonmagnetic layer between the magnetizing yoke and base material, which resulted in an extremely low and noisy probe response, as presented in Reference [29]. In other words, cladding causes serious difficulty for base material investigation. Nevertheless, through the proper choice of measuring parameters and suitable software, the measured signal could be successfully evaluated. On the other hand, the impact of cladding on the reactor pressure vessel wall integrity has been investigated in a very limited way in spite of the fact that it can potentially be of great significance to RPV integrity. The reason is that plasticity and the elevated fracture toughness of cladding can provide additional strength to the pressure wall and this process can justify an extended reactor lifetime [30]. In addition, in thermal expansion coefficients, significant differences can be found with respect to pressure vessel base metals, which can cause a stress peak [31]. This is the so-called pressurized thermal shock and it is a potential risk of interfacial crack initiation and propagation. Safety analysis of this phenomenon has lately become a subject of interest for operators of nuclear power plants [32]. In a very recent work, the results of an experimental investigation were presented, aimed at the evaluation of microstructure and failure mechanisms of WWER 440 reactor pressure vessel austenitic cladding (made of stainless steel Sv 08Kh19N10G2B) [33]. The question is arising, as to whether the base material and cladding could be investigated independently of each other by magnetic measurements. The purpose of this paper was to study this problem and to give an answer to this question. Material of cladding is basically austenitic, but it also contains several percentages (2\u20138%) of ferrite (magnetic) phase. The existence of this ferrite phase gives a chance for successfully applying magnetic measurements to study the properties of cladding. However, the huge volume of highly ferromagnetic base metal, close to the weakly ferromagnetic cladding material, causes difficulty for cladding material investigation. In this work, we will show that the characterization of base and cladding material can be separated from each other by a suitable technique of measurement. The idea is to choose the proper size of magnetizing yoke\u2014different sizes of yokes can be used for the characterization of base metal and for the characterization of cladding. To make a qualitative interpretation of the experimental results, the effect of the yoke dimension is calculated by numerical simulation of the magnetic flux distribution in the sample.\n2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials\nAs a first sample, a cladded block was investigated. Chemical composition of the 15H2NMFA base material can be seen in Table 1.

Numerical Simulation\nThe idea behind applying two different sizes of magnetizing yokes for measurement of cla ded blocks was that by doing this, we can separate the magnetic sig al f t base material and from the cladding. Numerical simulation of the distribution of the magnetic flux was performed for both Yoke A and Yoke B. The ferromagnetic base material was characterized by a nonlinear B(H) curve with saturation around 2 T and initial relative\nMaterials 2022, 15, 1425 6 of 12\npermeability of \u00b5rel,0 = 1200. Calculations were performed for three different values of relative permeability of the cladding, \u00b5rel = 1, 5 and 10, respectively. The calculations have been performed by 3D Finite Element Method (FEM), using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. The partial differential equations of the stationary magnetic field have been formulated for the magnetic vector potential [34]. The model domain was closed by an artificial boundary on which the normal component of the magnetic flux density was set to zero. The exciting coil has been modelled as an equivalent surface current density on the yoke\u2019s surface. The coil on Yoke A has 150 turns, whereas Yoke B has 40 turns. The exciting current was set as 0.45 A and 0.3 A, respectively, which approximated the exciting current at maximum differential permeability in the experiments. The nonlinear system of equations resulting from the FEM-discretization has been solved iteratively by the software. In the post-processing step, two magnetic fluxes were calculated: \u03a81 is the flux together in the cladding and in the base material, while \u03a82 is the flux only in the base material, both evaluated at the symmetry plane of the model. The quotient \u03a82/\u03a81 characterizes the relative magnetization of the base material. The numerical results for the two yokes and three different values of the relative permeability of the cladding, are given in Table 3.\nIt can be seen that in the case of Yoke A, this was a large value (>93%), while in the case of Yoke B, it was only around 50%. In this latter case, \u03a82/\u03a81 depended more on the relative permeability of the cladding. The distribution of the magnetic flux is shown for the three values of the relative permeability of cladding (\u00b5rel = 1, 5 and 10) for both yokes in Figures 6 and 7.

This value, which was 0.45 A in the case shown above, does not depend on the actual parameters of the measurement. Evidently, only results of those measurements can be compared with each\nother, which were performed by the same magnetizing yoke.\nThe next measurement was performed on the top of the block (shown in in Figure 2),\nagain by applying Yoke A. In this case, cladding and base material were measured\ntogether. In principle, the magnetic behavior of both somehow influence the measured\nsignal. However, as concluded from the result of simulation, a relatively high amount of\nflux was pumped into the ferromagnetic base material, so it is expected that mainly the\nhigh permeability base material determines the measured signal. The result of this\nmeasurement is shown in Figure 9. The values of the magnetizing currents at maximal\npermeability were very close to each other (0.45 A and 0.47 A), within the error of\nmeasurement. This means that base material was also detected when measurement is\nperformed through the cladding. The influence of cladding was almost negligible in this\ncase. This result verifies our previous measurements on thermally treated cladded blocks\n[31].\nFigure 9.

In order to study the situation better, measurement by Yoke A was done also on pure cladding (see sample in Figure 3). This result is shown in Figure 10. In accordance with our expectation, a weak maximum can be seen in permeability, but at different values of magnetizing current, compared to measurements made either on base material or on cladding above base material. The maximum of the curve appeared at I = 0.47 A if the base material was under the cladding and appeared at I = 0.78 A in the case of pure cladding. This difference cannot be explained by any experimental error, only by the difference in the magnetic behavior of the cladding and base material. The magnetic behavior of cladding is due to the small ferrite content of cladding, as mentioned already in the Introduction. The signal was very low and noisy, but a maximum definitely existed.

Note that the values of magnetizing current at maximal permeability are not comparable with similar current values in the previous section because different yokes were used in the two measurements. As defined above, the characteristic parameter of the base material was 0.30 A (see Figure 12). When the same measurement was performed, but on the cladding, the magnetizing current at maximal permeability was 0.90 A (see Figure 13). This parameter was very far from the base metal, so it can be considered as characteristic for the cladding. This statement is confirmed by the result of the measurement, performed on pure cladding (see Figure 14), where the maximum was observed at 0.87 A magnetizing current.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 1425 9 of 12\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 13 and placing the magnetizing yoke back.

It was demonstrated, by applying two magnetizing yokes with different dimensions, that the two types of very magnetically different components (ferromagnetic base metal and almost austenitic cladding) can be investigated separately from each other. To our best knowledge, this way of measurement is new.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 1425 11 of 12\nIf a large-sized yoke is applied, the ferromagnetic base metal can be measured. This yoke is not suitable for investigation of cladding on the top of base material, because the signal from the ferromagnetic part suppresses the signal of weakly magnetic cladding. With the application of a small-sized yoke, the cladding itself can be measured, even in the presence of highly ferromagnetic steel. The magnetic flux is closed in the cladding and cannot penetrate into the base material. The effect of the different yoke dimension was determined based on simulation of the magnetic flux distribution in the given geometry. The results of measurement correlate very well with the suggestions of simulation. By using our results, the possible material degradation of austenitic cladding on the pressure vessel\u2014due to different effects, like neutron irradiation, thermal treatment, etc.\u2014can be inspected by a simple and nondestructive magnetic method. This way of investigation implies the ability to monitor the integrity of the various layers of the reactor walls. Furthermore, this approach of using two different yoke sizes to test a bilayer material can be applied in general in other areas, where a highly ferromagnetic material is covered by another weakly ferromagnetic layer. This would make the work more meaningful than in connection with the testing of one particular wall. This seems to be possible, since the depth of magnetic permeability testing should increase with the size of the yoke. Based on our results, in the future, it will be possible that material degradation of cladding generated by any effects (neutron irradiation, thermal shock, plastic or elastic deformation) could be inspected by magnetic hysteresis measurements, mainly by magnetic adaptive testing. The measurement can even be done directly on the reactor pressure vessel wall.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization and original draft preparation, G.V.; investigation and methodology, G.V. and A.G.; numerical simulation, S.B.; project administration, A.G. and I.S.
