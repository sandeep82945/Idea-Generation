Despite remarkable recent progress in developing anti-cancer agents, outcomes of patients with solid tumors remain unsatisfactory. In general, anti-cancer drugs are systemically administered through peripheral veins and delivered throughout the body. The major problem with systemic chemotherapy is insufficient uptake of intravenous (IV) drugs by targeted tumor tissue. Although dose escalation and treatment intensification have been attempted in order to increase regional concentrations of anti-tumor drugs, these approaches have produced only marginal benefits in terms of patient outcomes, while often damaging healthy organs. To overcome this problem, local administration of anti-cancer agents can yield markedly higher drug concentrations in tumor tissue with less systemic toxicity. This strategy is most commonly used for liver and brain tumors, as well as pleural or peritoneal malignancies. Although the concept is theoretically reasonable, survival benefits are still limited. This review summarizes clinical results and problems and discusses future directions of regional cancer therapy with local administration of chemotherapeutants. 1. conclusions and future directions This review presents a comprehensive overview of current perspectives on routes of drug administration for cancer. Recently, various types of drugs, such as antibody preparations and nanomicellar modifications, have been developed to enhance selective targeting to solid tumors. However, the route of drug administration is another critical determinant that can regulate pharmacokinetics and toxicity, impacting the clinical efficacy of anti-cancer drugs [197]. A recent report shows that anti-PD-L1 antibody can be delivered more efficiently by an intraperitoneal route compared with the EPR effect of systemic infusion [198].
