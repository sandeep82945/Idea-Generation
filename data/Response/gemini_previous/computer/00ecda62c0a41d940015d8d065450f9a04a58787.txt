1. **Investigate the role of engram cells in different types of memory.** The paper focuses on the role of engram cells in episodic memory, but it is possible that engram cells also play a role in other types of memory, such as spatial memory, working memory, and long-term memory. Future research could investigate the role of engram cells in these other types of memory.


2. **Explore the relationship between engram cells and sharp-wave ripples.** The paper proposes that engram cells can trigger sharp-wave ripples, but the exact relationship between these two phenomena is not yet fully understood. Future research could investigate the causal relationship between engram cells and sharp-wave ripples, and explore the role of sharp-wave ripples in memory consolidation and retrieval.


3. **Develop computational models of engram cells and sharp-wave ripples.** The paper presents a computational model of engram cells and sharp-wave ripples, but this model is still relatively simple. Future research could develop more sophisticated computational models that can more accurately capture the behavior of engram cells and sharp-wave ripples. These models could be used to investigate the mechanisms underlying memory formation and retrieval.


4. **Investigate the role of engram cells and sharp-wave ripples in neurological disorders.** Engram cells and sharp-wave ripples have been implicated in a number of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Future research could investigate the role of engram cells and sharp-wave ripples in these disorders, and explore potential therapeutic interventions that target these phenomena.


5. **Develop new technologies for studying engram cells and sharp-wave ripples.** The current methods for studying engram cells and sharp-wave ripples are limited. Future research could develop new technologies that allow for more precise and detailed study of these phenomena. These technologies could include new imaging techniques, electrophysiological recording techniques, and computational methods.
