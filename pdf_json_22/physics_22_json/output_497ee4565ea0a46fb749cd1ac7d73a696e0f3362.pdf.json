    "abstractText": "Studying the properties of ultra-dense matter is one of the key goals of modern neutron star research. The measurement of the tidal deformability from the inspiral of a binary neutron star merger offers one promising method for constraining the equation of state (EoS) of cold, dense matter. In this work, we report on a new class of EoSs which have significantly different pressures at nuclear densities and large differences in stellar radii, but that predict surprisingly similar tidal deformabilities across the entire range of astrophysically-observed neutron star masses. Using a survey of 5 million piecewise polytropic EoSs, subject to five different sets of nuclear priors, we demonstrate that these \u201ctidal deformability doppelg\u00e4ngers \u201d occur generically. We find that they can differ substantially in the pressure (by up to a factor of 3 at nuclear densities) and in the radius of intermediate-mass neutron stars (by up to 0.5 km), but are observationally indistinguishable in their tidal deformabilities (\u2206\u039b \u2272 30) with the sensitivity of current gravitational wave detectors. We demonstrate that this near-degeneracy in the tidal deformability is a result of allowing for a phase transition at low densities. We show that a combination of input from nuclear theory (e.g., from chiral effective field theory), X-ray observations of neutron star radii, and/or the next generation of gravitational wave detectors will be able to significantly constrain these tidal deformability doppelg\u00e4ngers .",

The measurement of the tidal deformability from the inspiral of a binary neutron star merger offers one promising method for constraining the equation of state (EoS) of cold, dense matter. In this work, we report on a new class of EoSs which have significantly different pressures at nuclear densities and large differences in stellar radii, but that predict surprisingly similar tidal deformabilities across the entire range of astrophysically-observed neutron star masses. Using a survey of 5 million piecewise polytropic EoSs, subject to five different sets of nuclear priors, we demonstrate that these \u201ctidal deformability doppelga\u0308ngers \u201d occur generically. We find that they can differ substantially in the pressure (by up to a factor of 3 at nuclear densities) and in the radius of intermediate-mass neutron stars (by up to 0.5 km), but are observationally indistinguishable in their tidal deformabilities (\u2206\u039b \u2272 30) with the sensitivity of current gravitational wave detectors. We demonstrate that this near-degeneracy in the tidal deformability is a result of allowing for a phase transition at low densities. We show that a combination of input from nuclear theory (e.g., from chiral effective field theory), X-ray observations of neutron star radii, and/or the next generation of gravitational wave detectors will be able to significantly constrain these tidal deformability doppelga\u0308ngers .\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAstrophysical observations of neutron stars provide a unique laboratory for constraining the equation of state (EoS) of ultra-dense matter. Such constraints have been made, for example, using measurements of the neutron star radius from spectral modeling of bursting or quiescent neutron stars in X-ray binaries [1\u20139] or, more recently, from pulse-profile modeling of X-ray pulsars with the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) [10\u201313]. With the advent of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy, a complementary avenue for constraining the EoS is now also possible.\nIn particular, observations of the inspiral gravitational waves from the first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, have constrained the tidal deformability of a 1.4M\u2299 star to \u039b1.4 = 190 +390 \u2212120 at 90% confidence, which in turn has been used to constrain the pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density to within \u223c 125% [14\u201316]. It is projected that within the next five years, the LIGOVirgo-Kagra network is likely to detect O(10\u2212 20) additional neutron star mergers with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), which could further constrain the pressure at twice nuclear densities to within a factor of \u223c 2 [17\u201320]; or, potentially to within 20% given certain assumptions about the nuclear EoS [21].\nWith the construction of next-generation GW detec-\n\u2217Electronic address: craithel@ias.edu \u2020Electronic address: emost@princeton.edu\ntors such as Cosmic Explorer [22], Einstein Telescope [23], or NEMO [24], even tighter constraints on the EoS will become possible in the 2030s. For example, an event like GW170817 would have an SNR of 2800 with Cosmic Explorer, roughly 88 times larger than was observed in 2017 [25]. These detectors will observe tens of thousands of events per year, hundreds of which will have extremely high SNR in the inspiral, leading to anticipated constraints on the binary tidal deformability of \u03c3\u039b\u0303 < 20 and thus enabling a new era of precision EoS constraints [26].\nThe prospects for constraining the EoS with current or next-generation GW observations relies on the unique mapping between the tidal deformability and the underlying EoS. In the standard paradigm, these constraints would be limited only by the sensitivity to which the tidal deformability can be measured, and the masses at which it is measured. In practice, effects such as dynamical tides [27, 28] or systematics in the available waveform models [29] may complicate the extraction of the tidal deformability from the inspiral GWs, but the tidal deformability itself is assumed to map robustly to the EoS at supranuclear densities.\nIn this paper, we describe a new construction of EoS models that poses a challenge to this paradigm. In particular, we demonstrate that uncertainties in the EoS above nuclear densities lead to the emergence of what we call \u201ctidal deformability doppelga\u0308ngers\u201d: these are EoS models that differ significantly in pressure at supranuclear densities and accordingly in the neutron star radius, but that predict nearly identical tidal deformabilities across a wide range of neutron star masses. The most extreme\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n04 29\n5v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .H\nE ]\n2 0\nJu n\n20 23\n2 of these doppelga\u0308nger EoSs can vary in the pressure by factors of \u223c3 and in the radius by up to 0.5 km, but they differ in the tidal deformability by \u2272 10 across the entire range of astrophysically-observed neutron star masses, making them observationally indistinguishable to current GW detectors.\nWe find that pairs of doppelga\u0308nger EoSs are ubiquitous in randomly-generated EoS samples and that they occur as a natural consequence of allowing for a phase transition in the EoS at densities between 1 and 2 times the nuclear saturation density (where the exact density depends on the details of the crust EoS and the high-density parameterization, as we will demonstrate). We demonstrate that these doppelga\u0308ngers can be constructed by exploiting the different density dependencies of the tidal Love number, k2, and the stellar compactness, C, such that the tidal deformability \u039b = (2/3)k2C\n\u22125 remains the same, in spite of large differences in the stellar radii and pressures at supranuclear densities. Interestingly, we find that the doppelga\u0308ngers approximately obey the quasiuniversal relations between the tidal deformability and the moment of inertia, but that the doppelga\u0308ngers tend to fall below the standard quasi-universal relations with stellar compactness [30].\nThe small differences in the tidal deformability curves of the doppelga\u0308nger models will likely require the nextgeneration of GW detectors to resolve. We demonstrate, however, that the parameter space that is subject to this tidal deformability degeneracy can also be reduced by applying more restrictive nuclear priors, e.g. on the crust EoS or on the density-derivatives of the pressure. At lowdensities, such constraints may come from nuclear theory (e.g., from chiral EFT [31\u201334]); while new measurements of neutron star radii or even broad constraints on the tidal deformability with current GW detectors may also help to constrain the parameter space of the the tidal deformability doppelga\u0308ngers , even before the advent of next-generation detectors.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce several examples of doppelga\u0308nger EoSs and illustrate their basic construction. In Sec. III, we perform a large-scale EoS parameter survey with different sets of nuclear priors, to characterize the regions of EoS parameter space where the tidal-deformability degeneracy can occur and we quantify the unique signatures of these models. In Sec. IV, we discuss the implications of the doppelga\u0308nger EoSs and the prospects for resolving the degeneracy with joint input from nuclear physics and astrophysics."

            "text": "We start in this section by introducing a few examples of tidal deformability doppelga\u0308ngers , in order to illustrate their key features.\nHere and throughout this paper, we utilize parametric models of the EoS to explore the EoS parameter space in search of doppelga\u0308nger models. In particular, we adopt a piecewise polytropic (PWP) parametrization of the EoS, using five polytropic segments that are spaced uniformly in the logarithm of the density between \u03c10 and 7.4\u03c1sat [35\u201337], where \u03c1sat = 2.7\u00d7 1014g/cm3 is the nuclear saturation density. The starting density of the parametrization is taken to be between \u03c1sat and 1.5\u03c1sat, below which we adopt a tabular, nuclear EoS to describe the crust. For these crust EoSs, we choose nuclear models that are consistent with low-density nuclear constraints. We fix the pressure at \u03c10 to that of the crust EoS, in order to ensure continuity in the resulting model. The five polytropic segments of the PWP EoS are then determined by specifying the pressures at each fiducial density in the model. In constructing new EoSs, we impose a set of minimal physical constraints on the EoS above \u03c10, namely that:\n1. The EoS must be hydrostatically stable (i.e., \u2202P/\u2202\u03c1 \u2265 0, where P is the pressure and \u03c1 is the rest-mass density).\n2. The sound speed must remain subluminal at all densities.\n3. The EoS must be consistent with the observation of massive pulsars. In particular, we require that Mmax > 2.01M\u2299, which corresponds to the 1\u03c3 lower limit on the current most massive neutron star [38, 39].\nOnce these minimal constraints are satisfied, we exploit the uncertainties in the EoS to freely explore the remaining parameter space. We note that the resulting EoSs are quite broad in their coverage. We intentionally explore the extremes of the EoS parameter space in order to identify and highlight the new behavior of the doppelga\u0308nger models. As we will demonstrate, by applying additional nuclear input, the ubiquity and extremity of the doppelga\u0308ngers can be significantly reduced. We introduce the concept of tidal-deformability doppelga\u0308ngers with a few examples in Fig. 1. In this first illustration, we have chosen commonly-used low-density EoSs, onto which we attach different high-density EoSs that are constructed using PWPs to produce similar tidal deformability curves. For example, in the top row of Fig. 1, the light blue model uses the variational-method nuclear EoS ap3 [40] to describe the crust up to \u03c1sat; while the dark blue model uses the relativistic mean-field EoS ms1b [41] for the crust. At \u03c1 > \u03c1sat, we switch to the PWP construction described above, and we adjust the high-density pressures to specifically minimize differences in the tidal deformability \u039b. The net result is a pair of EoSs that differ in the pressure at \u03c1sat by a factor of 2.6, in the radius R1.4 of a 1.4 M\u2299 star by 0.33 km, but differ by \u2206\u039b \u227210 across the entire range of astrophysicallyobserved neutron star masses. The second and third rows of Fig. 1 show two additional pairs of doppelga\u0308nger EoSs,\n3\nwhich are constructed using different sets of crust EoSs: gnh3 [42], alf4 [43], wff1 [44], and ms1, which is identical to ms1b but features a higher symmetry energy (for additional details on these models, see e.g. [45]). In Fig. 1, we have grayed out masses below 1.17 M\u2299, which is the\n1-\u03c3 lower limit on the lightest-observed pulsar [46], in order to focus on astrophysically-observed neutron star\n4\n.\nmasses. 1 In these examples, we find fractional differences in pressure of 170% and in R1.4 of 0.72 km for the gnh3/alf4 pair of doppelga\u0308ngers (in green); and 365% in pressure and 0.48 km in R1.4 for the wff1/ms1 pair of doppelga\u0308ngers (in red).\nDespite these large differences in pressure and radius, the tidal deformabilities for each set of models are very similar in all three cases. We show the difference in tidal deformability as a function of the mass for each pair of models in the far right column of Fig. 1. In these figures, the vertical shaded bands indicate anticipated 68% measurement uncertainties in the tidal deformability, \u03c3\u039b, for a population of neutron star mergers, assuming an intermediate merger detection rate observed with current and next-generation facilities [25]. 2 When this measurement uncertainty, \u03c3\u039b, becomes comparable to the intrinsic difference between a pair of models, \u2206\u039b, the two EoSs can no longer be distinguished. Already, we see that a next-generation detector such as Cosmic Explorer would be required to distinguish between any of these pairs of doppelga\u0308ngers based on their tidal deformabilities alone.\nWe note that we focus on absolute differences in radii\n1 We note that the 90% lower-limit on the secondary mass from GW170817 was also 1.17M\u2299 and that, to-date, no lighter neutron stars have yet been detected from gravitational wave events [14]. 2 We note that the \u03c3\u039b from [25] was calculated for the binary tidal\ndeformability, \u039b\u0303. In this paper, we assume equal mass binaries for simplicity, in which case \u039b\u0303 reduces to the tidal deformability of either star. We present the difference in \u039b\u0303 as a function of the mass ratio for two example pairs of doppelga\u0308nger EoSs in a companion paper [47].\nand tidal deformabilities, because this allows for the most direct comparison against the observational sensitivity of experiments such as NICER or LIGO. For example, it has been estimated that the sensitivity of next-generation GW detectors will yield constraints on the neutron star radii of 50-200 m [26], significantly smaller than what we construct for the doppelga\u0308nger models shown in Fig. 1. To explore the impact of this tidal deformability degeneracy for current and future GW detector sensitivities, we perform mock Bayesian inferences of the EoS for a pair of doppelga\u0308nger models in a companion Letter [47]. The examples shown here were constructed by using different theoretical calculations for the crust EoS up to \u03c1sat and freely varying the PWP pressures at higher densities. These results are consistent with previous work that has shown that changing the crust EoS (at densities below 1014 g/cm3) can affect the radius without significantly changing the tidal deformabilities [48]. Here, however, we find that EoSs can have significant (\u223c 3\u00d7) differences at supranuclear densities, and still be indistinguishable in their tidal deformabilities. We can also see this behavior emerge more generically, by systematically varying the EoS at densities above \u03c1sat to explore the uncertainties in the EoS at supranuclear densities. We do so in Fig. 2, where we adopt a single low-density EoS, ap3, which we use at densities below \u03c1sat for all models. At densities above \u03c1sat, we construct a sequence of models that exhibit similar tidal deformability curves as the supranuclear pressures are varied.\nIn Fig. 2, it becomes clear that there is actually a continuum of EoS models that produce nearly-degenerate tidal deformability curves. The mass-radius and tidal\n5 deformability curves for these models are shown in the middle panels of Fig. 2, where they are colored according to the pressure at the nuclear saturation density, Psat. The far right panel of Fig. 2 shows the difference in tidal deformability between any two pairs of these EoSs, colored according to the ratio of pressures at 1.5\u03c1sat. As we saw in Fig. 1, the tidal deformabilities of these models are nearly indistinguishable with current GW detectors for all but the lowest-mass systems. In this case, the doppelga\u0308ngers would be distinguishable in an EoS inference from GW data only by the choice of informative nuclear priors. In contrast, for a population of mergers observed with Cosmic Explorer, these models start to become distinguishable from the data directly.\nThe fact that the near-degeneracy in tidal deformability curves applies to a continuous range of EoS parameter space has important implications: it suggests that even as the range of EoS pressures is further constrained by future astrophysical detections and by input from nuclear theory, the tidal deformability degeneracy will be reduced, but not entirely eliminated. We revisit this point and discuss practical ways for further resolving the degeneracy in Sec. IV."

We consider three fiducial densities for the onset of our piecewise polytopes, \u03c10 = {1, 1.2, and 1.5}\u03c1sat, in order to gauge the impact of this starting density on the doppelga\u0308nger behavior. At densities below this fiducial value, we adopt a tabulated, nuclear EoS to describe the crust. The pressure at \u03c10 is set by the crust EOS, in order to ensure continuity in the EoS. We explore two choices for the crust EoS. For the baseline set of models, we use the nuclear model ap3 [40] for the crust; but we also explore the impact of one stiffer EoS model, ms1b [41], which predicts a significantly (2.6\u00d7) larger pressure at \u03c1sat (see top panel of Fig. 1).\nThe pressures at the remaining five fiducial densities are free parameters, which we sample uniformly via a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A tentative MCMC step is rejected if it violates any of the minimal constraints enumerated in Sec. II. We additionally\nimpose a regularizer on the pressure in our MCMC sampling, in order to penalize EoS models that have extreme density variations in the pressure. This helps to compensate for the large degree of freedom inherent to a five-polytrope EoS. We construct the regularizer to be a Gaussian over the second logarithmic derivative of the pressure, i.e.,\n\u03be = exp [ \u2212 (d 2(lnP )/d(ln \u03c1)2)2\n2\u03bb2\n] , (1)\nwhere \u03bb is the characteristic scale. The distribution of d2(lnP )/d(ln \u03c1)2 evaluated at different densities for a large sample of theoretical EoSs is shown in Fig. 1 of [49]. Based on those results, we adopt a conservative value of \u03bb = 8 for our baseline models, which corresponds to a weakly informative prior. We also construct one set of models with \u03bb = 2, which corresponds to taking stronger (more informative) input from the existing set of nuclear models. For further details about how the choice of this Gaussian regularizer affects an EoS inference, see [49]. Altogether, we construct five different sets of PWP EoSs: our baseline model starts at \u03c1sat, uses ap3 for the crust EoS, and adopts a weak prior on the second derivative of the pressures. We explore two samples with the same crust and prior, but starting the PWP parametrization at \u03c10= 1.2 and 1.5\u03c1sat. We additionally modify the baseline sample to use ms1b for the crust EoS, keeping \u03c10 and the weak prior the same; and to use a stronger prior, keeping \u03c10 and the crust EoS the same. For each case, we generate a large number (2-4 million) of parametric EoSs, in order to densely sample the five-dimensional EoS parameter space. We summarize these samples in Table I for reference in the following analysis."

In particular, we take a subset of \u223c 9\u00d7 105 models and compare each of these to every other EoS in the full sample.

We calculate \u2206Rmin as the minimum difference in radius between the two EoSs across the same mass range. The first term in eq. (2) is one for EoSs that predict identical tidal deformabilities at all masses, and goes to zero as the tidal deformability curves become less similar; while the second term is zero for EoSs with identical mass-radius curves, and approaches one as the mass-radius curves become more distinct. Thus, the doppelga\u0308nger scoring criteria is largest when \u2206\u039bmax is minimized and \u2206Rmin is maximized. Finally, to set the scale in eq. (2), we define \u03c3\u039b = 10 and \u03c3R = 0.3 km, based on the characteristic differences that we found in \u039b and R in Sec. II.\nWe note that this scoring metric necessarily selects for doppelga\u0308ngers that are similar to what we constructed by hand in Sec. II. Other scoring criteria would select for different features. For example, maximizing a massaveraged \u2206R (instead of \u2206Rmin) tends to select for EoSs that are dominated by large differences in radius near the maximum mass turn-over, even if the mass-radius curves are identical at other masses. It may also be possible to search for doppelga\u0308nger behavior directly in pressure-density space. Empirically, we find that the scoring criteria in eq. (2) works well for identifying doppelga\u0308ngers with similar phenomenological features to the examples shown in Sec. II.\nFor each EoS in our \u223c 9\u00d7105 subset, we use eq. (2) to identify a \u201cbest\u201d doppelga\u0308nger companion out of all possible (2-4 million) companions. For many EoSs, there is no high-scoring doppelga\u0308nger companion, and the \u201cbest\u201d score is correspondingly very low. However, for the highest-scoring pairs of EoS, we find doppelga\u0308ngers that are comparable to those constructed by hand in Figs. 1 and 2."

In contrast, the samples of EoSs that we identify as doppelga\u0308ngers occupy a distinct part of the EoS parameter space.

From Fig. 3, we already see that the EoS sample constructed with the PWP parametrization starting at \u03c1sat enables the most extreme set of doppelga\u0308ngers , with average radius differences of up to \u223c400 m. As the crust EoS is enforced to higher densities, the allowed doppelga\u0308ngers become less extreme.\nFigure 4 shows the impact of assuming a different crust EoS on the resulting sample of doppelga\u0308ngers . In this figure, the baseline EoS sample, which assumes ap3 to \u03c10 = \u03c1sat, is repeated in teal for reference. The new EoS sample (shown in yellow) is otherwise identical (i.e., using \u03c10 = \u03c1sat and the weak prior), but the low-density EoS\n7\nis exchanged for the stiffer model ms1b. We find that adopting a stiffer crust EoS results in less extreme doppelga\u0308ngers , characterized by smaller average differences in radii. Figure 5 likewise shows the impact of modifying the baseline EoS sample (in teal) to use a stronger prior on the second logarithmic derivative of the pressure (in pink), such that \u03bb = 2 in eq. 1. By restricting rapid variations in the pressure as a function of density, the extremity of the doppelga\u0308nger models can be further reduced. To understand these differences as a function of mass, Fig. 6 shows contours of the differences in \u039b and R at fixed masses, for each set of doppelga\u0308ngers identified in Fig. 3. In general, we find that the doppelga\u0308ngers selected for by eq. (2) have the largest differences in radius at low masses (1.2M\u2299). At all four masses considered, the doppelga\u0308ngers differ in \u039b by a similar degree, albeit with somewhat larger characteristic differences reached at 1.8M\u2299. In fact, we can see that for this mass, \u2206\u039b is more strongly correlated with \u2206R, whereas \u2206\u039b is almost independent of \u2206R at lower masses. Figure 6 again highlights that assuming the crust EoS to higher densities reduces the parameter space of the doppelga\u0308nger EoSs. For example, when the crust EoS is assumed only up to \u03c1sat, the doppelga\u0308ngers are characterized by \u2206R1.4 \u2272 0.25 km. However, in the more restrictive case that the EoS is known to 1.5\u03c1sat, the resulting set of most extreme doppelga\u0308ngers have \u2206R1.4 \u2272 0.1 km. In summary, for all EoS samples considered, we find populations of doppelga\u0308nger EoS models that have average differences in the tidal deformability of \u2272 10, but that differ in radii by up to a few hundred meters. The extremity of the doppelga\u0308nger behavior \u2013 characterized by the average differences in radii \u2013 can be reduced by enforcing the crust EoS to higher densities, using a crust EoS that is relatively stiff, or by adopting stronger priors on the density-derivatives of the pressure."

We caution that these are merely bounds on the mass-radius space, and that multiple different EoSs may contribute to any given feature along these edges (see e.g. Fig. 3 of [49]). However, these edges already demonstrate clearly that the doppelga\u0308nger scoring criterion selects for relatively compact stars. This is even more apparent when we consider the distributions of radii for stars of fixed mass (M = 1.4M\u2299),\n8\nwhich are shown in the top panel of Fig. 7. The randomly-drawn sample of EoSs peaks strongly towards large R1.4, due to the uniform MCMC sampling of the EoSs in pressure space. In spite of this strong preference for large-radius stars in the randomly-drawn EoS sample, the doppelga\u0308ngers select for more compact neutron stars, with R1.4 \u2243 11\u221212 km. As the starting density for the PWP parametrization is increased, the distribution of doppelga\u0308ngers shifts toward smaller radii and spans a narrower region of the mass-radius plane.\nFigure 8 shows the impact on these mass-radius bounds\nof changing the crust EoS (in yellow) or adopting stronger priors (in pink), compared to the baseline sample of doppelga\u0308ngers (in teal). For the same starting PWP density of \u03c10 = \u03c1sat, using a stiffer crust EoS such as ms1b causes the doppelga\u0308nger population to shift to larger radii, with the distribution of R1.4 peaking at \u223c 12.25 km, compared to R1.4 \u223c 11.7 km for the baseline sample that uses the softer crust EoS ap3. When the stronger prior is adopted, the mass-radius bounds shrink and R1.4 is again slightly larger than the weak prior baseline case. The reason for this is that the stronger prior penalizes phase transitions\n9\n(see eq. 1), which generally lead to more compact stars.\nFor the range of crust EoSs, priors, and starting densities considered here, we find that the doppelga\u0308ngers occur in a relatively compact region of parameter space. The range of stellar compactness spanned by these models is consistent with current astrophysical constraints from NICER [10\u201313] and GW170187 [14\u201316]. However, if future observations find that neutron star radii are significantly larger, it may be possible to constrain the ubiquity and extremity of the doppelga\u0308ngers by combining nuclear input (e.g., in terms of the densities to which crust EoS is known) with X-ray observations of neutron stars. We revisit this point in the discussion below.\nIn order to better understand the parameter space of these models, Figs. 9-10 show 2D histograms of the pressure and density for the various populations of dop-\npelga\u0308ngers . For a given pair of doppelga\u0308ngers , we identify one EoS as \u201csofter\u201d and one as \u201cstiffer\u201d, based on which has the larger pressure at the first fiducial density in our parametrization. We then compute the 2D histogram for all of the softer EoSs in blue, and the stiffer EoSs in red. A clear structure emerges in these 2D histograms, with all softer (blue) EoSs exhibiting some degree of a phase transition at densities immediately above \u03c10, for any of the three starting densities considered in Fig. 9. The stiffer (red) EoSs start initially stiff, then soften. We saw a similar behavior in Figs. 1 and 2, where the strongest tidal deformability degeneracy occurred for EoSs that differed maximally in the pressure at low densities, but were similar at higher densities. Here, we see that this signature holds more generally in this larger and randomly-generated EoS sample: that is, the doppelga\u0308nger degeneracy emerges for EoSs that differ significantly at low densities, with one stiffer EoS rising rapidly in pressure, undergoing a phase transition, and then stiffening again (more slowly) to higher densities. The companion doppelga\u0308nger EoS is one that starts with a strong phase transition just above \u03c10, and then stiffens, such that it has the higher pressure just above the first\n10\nsoftening of the other EoS. The large differences between the stiff (red) and soft (blue) doppelga\u0308ngers in Fig. 9 imply significant differences in the underlying physics of the models. In particular, although the PWP construction is phenomenological in nature, the qualitative features found in Fig. 9 are similar to what is found in more realistic calculations of EoSs with first-order phase transitions to deconfined quark matter, or more generally to the emergence of more exotic degrees of freedom [e.g., 50\u201352, and references therein]. Thus, the degeneracy of the tidal deformability curves for these models suggests some limitation to how well we may be able to resolve phase transitions in some regions of parameter space. We investigate this question in the context of mock EoS inferences from GW data for doppelga\u0308nger models in [47].\nAs the crust EoS is assumed to higher densities, we find in Fig. 9 that the differences in pressures between a given pair of doppelga\u0308ngers are reduced. For comparison against the baseline case (with the PWP parametrization starting at \u03c10), we show also in Fig. 10 the doppelga\u0308nger populations with the stronger prior on the pressure derivatives and with the stiffer crust EoS. For the case of the strong prior, which penalizes large secondderivatives of the pressure (eq. 1), first-order phase transitions are severely restricted. Nevertheless, the doppelga\u0308nger scoring criteria still selects for EoSs that are maximally different at intermediate densities and selects, when possible, for smoother, cross-over phase transitions.\nFor the crust EoS ms1b in the bottom panel of Fig. 9, we also find smaller differences in the pressures between the stiff and soft doppelga\u0308ngers , compared to the baseline case which used ap3 for the crust. The reason for this is that ms1b is a relatively stiff EoS (see Fig. 1), thus the parametrization starts from a higher pressure at \u03c10. As a result, there is a narrower region of parameter space in which it is possible to construct a pair of\nmodels with the requisite phase transitions to achieve the doppelga\u0308nger morphology.\nWe emphasize that these pressure-density histograms highlight the most extreme pairs of doppelga\u0308ngers in our full sample. As was shown in Fig. 2, the parameter space between the blue and red curves will also be partially degenerate in tidal deformability. We note that a different parametrization of the EoS (e.g., a constant-sound-speed [53], spectral [54, 55] or non-parametric [56, 57] representation) may influence the EoS features identified here and the resulting tidal deformability degeneracy as well. Further work will be needed to assess the ubiquity of the doppelga\u0308nger degeneracy in other EoS frameworks.\nE. I-Love-C Quasi-Universal Relations\nThe typical differences of \u2272 10 in the tidal deformability found in Sec. III C are much smaller than expected from the quasi-universal relation between \u039b and the stellar compactness, C, first introduced in [30, 58]. This \u039b\u2212 C relation predicts, e.g., that a 0.4 km difference in radii for R1.4 \u2243 12 km stars should propagate to a difference in \u039b1.4 of 85. More generally, it has been shown that \u039b \u221d R\u03b1 for a large range of EoSs, where \u03b1 \u2248 6 [59\u201361], which would further imply that small differences in R should propagate to large differences in \u039b. Given these standard scaling relations, the small differences in \u039b for the doppelga\u0308ngers are quite surprising.\nCuriously, we find that the doppelga\u0308nger EoSs still approximately obey the quasi-universal relations of [30], between not just \u039b and C, but also with the dimensionless moment of inertia I\u0304 \u2261 I/M3. We show these relations in Fig. 11 for our baseline EoS sample (PWP parametrization starting at \u03c1sat, ap3 for the crust EoS, and a weak prior on the pressure derivatives). The highest-scoring\n11\nsample of doppelga\u0308ngers are shown in teal, while the sample of randomly-drawn EoSs are shown in orange. The bottom panel shows the residuals compared to the fit relations from [30].\nWe find that the doppelga\u0308ngers obey these standard quasi-universal relations, with a roughly comparable degree of scatter. In particular, for the I\u0304 \u2212 \u039b relation, which is the tightest relation of the three shown, the doppelga\u0308ngers obey the existing relation nearly exactly, with errors at the sub-percent level. This is nearly indistinguishable from the relation we find for the random sample of EoSs. In the relations between either \u039b or I\u0304 and the stellar compactness, which are generally broader, we find that the doppelga\u0308ngers are approximately consistent with the existing relationships, although there is a\nsystematic deviation from the standard relation at small compactness. This deviation becomes more evident in Fig. 12, where we show a 2D histogram of the \u039b\u2212C relation for the same sample of doppelga\u0308ngers . As in Fig. 9, for each pair of doppelga\u0308ngers , we identify one softer and one stiffer EoS based on which has the larger pressure at the first fiducial density and we color the resulting histograms in blue and red, respectively. We find that the doppelga\u0308nger models tend to fall systematically below the \u039b \u2212 C relationship of [30], with larger deviations at small C. This is perhaps not surprising, given with the compact region of parameter space that these models are found within (see Sec. IIID). We also find that, although the doppelga\u0308ngers generally obey the standard \u039b \u2212 C relation, they select from distinct regions of this plane, as evidenced by the divide in colors in Fig. 12. That is, the doppelga\u0308ngers can be interpreted as originating from different sub-populations that exist within the scatter of the broad \u039b\u2212C relation. The results in Fig. 12 are shown for the weakest set of constraints in order to illustrate the trend. For completeness, we show the I \u2212\u039b\u2212C relations for the EoS samples with additional restrictions (in terms of the the density to which the crust EoS is assumed, the choice of crust EoS, and the prior) in the Appendix. In all cases, we find that the doppelga\u0308ngers exhibit a tight I \u2212\u039b correlation, with sub-percent residuals comparable to the relation of [30]. For the \u039b\u2212C and I\u2212C relations, the doppelga\u0308nger models can deviate more significantly from the relations of [30], especially at low C, depending on the restrictions adopted in the EoS sampling. Finally, we illustrate the origin of the tidal deformability degeneracy in Fig. 13, where we show the tidal Love number, k2, for one pair of high-scoring doppelga\u0308ngers (in the top panel), compared to the random population of EoSs (in the bottom panel). We see in this figure that, although the tidal deformabilities of the two doppelga\u0308nger EoSs are very similar, their tidal Love numbers differ significantly. Figure 13 additionally shows that for a random sample of EoSs, k2 is approximately correlated with the neutron star radius. Because the tidal deformability is constructed from these two quantities according to\n\u039b = 2\n3 k2\n( R\nM\n)5 , (3)\nthe bottom panel of Fig. 13 thus also illustrates the known \u039b \u221d R\u03b1 scaling relation. In contrast, the top panel of Fig. 13 shows that the doppelga\u0308ngers violate this trend between k2 and the radius, across a limited range of radii. For the doppelga\u0308nger models, an increase in k2 at a given mass is balanced by a decrease in R, and the overall \u039b remains approximately unchanged. These results suggest that if a gravitational wave detector were directly sensitive to k2, the doppelga\u0308nger models could be more readily distinguished. However, because the detectors are most sen-\n12\nsitive to the product of k2 and R 5, and because k2 and R are each sensitive to the EoS at slightly different densities, it is possible to construct models that are approximately degenerate in their tidal deformabilities. We note that these trends hold generally for all of the EoS samples considered, but with differing magnitudes. We show results here for the baseline sample for illustrative effect."

            "text": "The example doppelga\u0308ngers first constructed by hand in Sec. II and identified generically from samples of randomly-generated EoSs in Sec. III both share a common signature: namely, that the stiffer EoS undergoes some cross-over (or, in the more extreme case, first-order) phase transition at supranuclear densities. When compared to a sufficiently soft companion EoS, the resulting models can have nearly identical tidal deformability curves across a wide range of neutron star masses, in spite of significant differences (> 100%) in the lowdensity pressures. We see this behavior in EoS samples that are constructed to obey minimal physical constraints and that are subject to different degrees of nuclear input, in terms of the density to which the crust EoS is utilized and in terms of the prior on the derivatives of the pressure. In every case, we find examples of doppelga\u0308nger EoSs, although the extremity of the degeneracy is reduced as more restrictions are added.\nThe existence of doppelga\u0308nger EoSs thus seems to be a natural consequence of allowing for a phase transition. For an EoS to undergo a phase transition and still meet the maximum mass requirement of \u223c 2M\u2299, it requires a significant degree of stiffening at both lower and higher densities. As we have shown in Fig. 10, one way to reduce the extremity of the allowed doppelga\u0308ngers is to apply a stronger prior on the second derivative of the pressure. Thus, by folding in constraints on the sound speed in neutron stars from latest astrophysical measurements, combined with theoretical input from chiral EFT [e.g., 63\u201366], it may be possible to constrain the parameter space of doppelga\u0308nger models.\nIn terms of the crust EoS, further constraints may be possible by incorporating latest results from chiral EFT\n13\ncalculations, which can at least partially constrain the EoS to densities of 2\u03c1sat [67\u201369], Improvements in lowdensity experimental constraints will come in the coming years as well, e.g., from measurements of the neutron skin thickness with PREX and CREX [70], new neutron-rich isotope facilities such as FRIB, RIBF, and FAIR, and next-generation heavy ion colliders such as NICA [71]. As these experiments and theoretical inputs constrain the crust EoS to higher densities, the allowed parameter space for the doppelga\u0308nger models will be further reduced.\nAnother avenue forward is to use the next-generation of astrophysical constraints. Indeed, the most extreme examples of doppelga\u0308ngers that we constructed predicted neutron star radii that differ by\u223c 0.5 km (or even 0.7 km,\nwhen allowing for further freedom in the crust EoS, as in Sec. II). This is comparable to the anticipated radius accuracy for the brightest NICER targets [72]. Gravitational wave detections of mergers with very low-mass neutron stars (\u223c 1\u22121.2M\u2299) may also help to distinguish between some classes of doppelga\u0308ngers , as low-mass stars have generally larger differences in tidal deformabilities. If such low-mass systems exist, they may be a prime target for partially resolving the tidal deformability degeneracy directly with GW data. We demonstrate this prospect in the context of an EoS inference from current and upcoming GW data for a pair of doppelga\u0308nger models in [47]. However, we note that measuring the difference in \u039b for such systems will likely still require very high SNRs, at which point current waveform models become prone to systematic errors [29]. Improvements in numerical waveform models are thus crucially needed as well. Rather than treating each of these types of constraints separately, the most promising route forward will likely be to combine these inputs. For example, consider a scenario in which nuclear theory constrains the crust EoS sufficiently tightly that the allowed parameter space of doppelga\u0308ngers is restricted to R1.4 \u2208 (10, 12) km (as in e.g., Fig. 7). If NICER measures the radius of a future source with high precision to R1.4 > 12 km or if LIGO likewise measures an incompatible tidal deformability, then the most extreme sets of doppelga\u0308ngers can effectively be ruled out. In a companion work to this paper [47], we performed a set of numerical relativity simulations of neutron star mergers, using two example pairs of doppelga\u0308nger EoSs. In that work, we investigated the emission of gravitational waves from the post-merger remnant, and found that the peak frequency of the post-merger signal is the same for a given pair of doppelga\u0308ngers , to within our estimate of the numerical error of the simulations. In other words, it seems that post-merger GWs may not be able to distinguish between doppelga\u0308ngers either, although this conclusion is subject to the numerical and physical uncertainties of current state-of-the-art simulations, including the possible impact of incorporating more realistic magnetic fields [73\u201375], more advanced neutrino physics [76\u2013 79], finite-temperature effects [80\u201382], and rapid neutron star spins [83\u201387], which will need to be considered before a final conclusion can be drawn."

            "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a new class of EoS models that can differ significantly in the pressure near saturation densities and, accordingly, in the radii by up to 0.5 km, but that are surprisingly similar in tidal deformability across the entire range of neutron star masses. These tidal deformability doppelga\u0308ngers will be challenging to differentiate with the current generation of GW detectors, although next-generation facilities such as Cos-\n14\nmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope may be able to resolve the small differences in \u039b for these models.\nWe have shown that it is not only possible to construct EoSs that have nearly-degenerate tidal deformability curves, but that these doppelga\u0308ngers naturally occur in randomly-generated samples of EoS models, as a consequence of allowing for a phase transition at supranuclear densities, where the exact density can be pushed higher by adopting more restrictive nuclear input. This has important implications for EoS inferences from measurements of the tidal deformability. In particular, even with measurements of tidal deformabilities across a wide range of masses, we have shown that there are some regions of the EoS parameter that will be challenging to distinguish based on the tidal deformabilities alone. This implies a fundamental limit to the level at which the neutron star radius can be constrained from current measurements of the tidal deformability, in the absence of informative nuclear priors that would distinguish between these doppelga\u0308nger models.\nHowever, we have also demonstrated that by adopting more restrictive priors on the density-dependence of the pressure, or by utilizing the crust EoS to higher densities, that the extremity of the doppelga\u0308nger models can be significantly reduced. Thus, by incorporating future constraints from nuclear theory and experiments, X-ray observations of neutron star radii, and population constraints on the tidal deformability from currentgeneration facilities, it may be possible to significantly constrain the ubiquity of doppelga\u0308nger models, even before the advent of next-generation GW detectors."

            "text": "In this appendix, we report the I-Love-C relations for three additional EoS samples, to demonstrate the impact of assuming the crust EoS to a higher density of \u03c10 = 1.5\u03c1sat (in Fig. 14), using a stonger prior on the high-density pressure derivatives (in Fig. 15), and adopting the stiffer crust EoS ms1b (in Fig. 16). In each of these figures, we show the correlations between tidal deformability, moment of inertia, and compactness for both a set of randomly-selected EoSs (in orange) or the highest-scoring set of doppelga\u0308ngers from a given EoS sample (in teal).\nFor all three of these EoS samples, which adopt additional restrictions compared to the baseline EoS sample described in Sec. III E, we find that the I\u2212\u039b relation still holds, almost exactly, for the doppelga\u0308nger models. In particular, I \u2212 \u039b correlation for the doppelga\u0308nger models matches that of Ref. [30] with sub-percent residuals, indistinguishable from the correlation for the randomlyselected set of EoS models.\nIn contrast, we find larger deviations of up to \u223c 30% in the \u039b\u2212C and I\u2212C relations for the doppelga\u0308nger models, compared to the quasi-universal relations of [30]. The deviations are largest in the \u039b\u2212 C correlations at small compactness.\nThus, although the EoS samples shown in Figs. 14-16 have more restrictions than the baseline EoS sample of Sec. III E, they deviate more significantly from the existing quasi-universal \u039b \u2212 C relations. Depending on the region of parameter space in which the true EoS resides, these deviations may bias EoS inferences that incorporate the standard \u039b \u2212 C fits; e.g., as was done in one of the EoS inferences of the LIGO-Virgo anaylsis of GW170817 [16].\n[1] F.
