    "abstractText": "Results: A total of 72 physicians were included. The mean total score for the information literacy scale was 59.8 out of 91 (SD = 11.4). The mean score was 29.3 (SD = 5.6) out of 55 on the computer literacy scale. A one-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant association between information literacy and information retrieval efficacy (F (2,69) = 4.466, p = 0.015) and efficiency of information retrieval (F (2.69) = 4.563, p = 0.014). Computer literacy was not associated with information retrieval efficacy or efficiency.",

            "text": "Physicians frequently ask clinical questions during patient encounters at the point of care that require engaging in information seeking to identify and retrieve relevant evidence-based health-related information [1]. In practice, physicians encounter frequent barriers to retrieving relevant clinical information for patient care, including time during the encounter, lack of information searching skills, cost, and accessibility of knowledge resources [2-5]. In addition to information literacy and evidence-based medicine (EBM) skills, physicians report a lack of digital or Internet skills as a barrier to online health information retrieval [6].\nInformation and digital literacy are necessary for information retrieval satisfaction among healthcare\nprofessionals [7]. However, the perspective of digital literacy is still underused in published healthcare studies. A scoping review about digital health competencies for primary health care professionals yielded only 28 articles, with the majority published before 2011 and conducted in developed countries such as the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, and Europe, with one article from Malawi [8]. Moreover, only 20% of the articles focused on basic computer and information literacy skills, and the majority focused on using electronic medical records. Therefore, this study aims to measure the association between community family physicians\u2019 information retrieval and their information and computer literacy.\nSee end of article for supplemental content.\nJournal of the Medical Library Association 111 (3) July 2023 jmla.mlanet.org"

Community family physicians without academic affiliation in developing countries were targeted as their access to reliable resources or paid point-of-care resources and the Internet in the office may be limited [10-12]. Community family physicians without any academic affiliation were recruited by email invitation through the professional scientific societies of the World Organization of Family Doctors- Eastern Mediterranean Region (WONCA EMR) countries (Appendix 1). While it is not possible to know how many physicians received the email invitation, the population of interest's estimated size was 19,600 doctors [13]. The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the American University of Beirut. Appendix 2 includes the survey."

            "text": "There is no consensus definition or framework for digital literacy, and specific digital literacy skills differ among academic disciplines, such as education, information studies, or media studies, which can make it difficult to measure and assess across groups [14]. Digital literacy has been used as an umbrella term for different types of literacies: computer literacy, information literacy, network literacy, communication literacy, visual literacy, and technology literacy [15]. This study focused on two specific domains of digital literacy: information literacy and computer literacy [16].\nInformation literacy was measured using the Information Literacy Self-Efficacy-M scale [17]. It was adapted from the Information Literacy Self-Efficacy Scale developed by Kurbanoglu et al. [18] to include items relevant to the specific context of medical curricula. The total scale consisted of 5 subscales: evaluating and processing information (11 items), searching and finding information (10 items), medical information literacy (10 items), using the physical library (4 items), and bibliography (4 items). Another study used the scale to measure predictors of information literacy among medical students [19]. The internal consistency of the subscales was high, with Cronbach's alpha in the range of 0.858 to 0.930. The exploratory factor analysis of the five factors and 35 items accounted for 58.34% of the total variance. The total scale score was the sum of the various item responses, with higher scores indicating higher information literacy. Two relevant subscales were used for this research study: searching and finding information and medical information literacy. Furthermore, three questions in the subscales were removed as they are not relevant to the research question: finding citing authors, referencing the sources I use in a reference style used in medicine, and\nusing different kinds of print sources (such as books, periodicals, encyclopedias).\nComputer literacy was measured using the General Confidence With Computer Use Scale. It was first developed and validated within the context of learning mathematics among university students [20]. The scale was later validated among a sample of pharmacists in Lebanon [21]. It comprised 12 items answered using a 5- point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The total score was the summation of the answers to all the questions. Higher scores indicated higher computer literacy. The internal consistency was good, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.716. Using exploratory factor analysis, the 12 items explained 57.1% of the total variance."

Digital literacy was operationalized with two scales that measure information and computer literacy. As the two scales used for information and computer literacy were not validated in a similar population of family physicians, the internal consistency of the scales in the sample was studied using Cronbach's alpha. The total scale score is the sum of the various item responses, with higher scores indicating higher information or computer literacy for both scales. The mean total score for the information literacy scale was 59.8 (SD = 11.4), with a Cronbach alpha of 0.862.

            "text": "The efficiency of information retrieval, lack of information retrieval abilities, and ease of use have been reported by physicians as barriers to information retrieval [2-5]. Information and digital literacy are necessary for information retrieval satisfaction among healthcare professionals [7]. This study aimed to understand the relationship between information retrieval efficacy and efficiency with digital literacy. The computer and digital literacy scores of the community physicians in the 8 Arab countries were average. Information literacy, rather than computer literacy, was associated with the efficacy and efficiency of information retrieval behavior.\nDigital literacy among healthcare professionals and practicing physicians, in particular, is still understudied [8]. In this study, community family physicians scored average on information and computer literacy scales. A sample of primary health care physicians in KSA scored 12.84\u00b14.4 out of 24 on their level of knowledge about extracting journals and databases relevant to EBM [23]. A study among nursing students in Australia has shown good competency in basic computer and information literacy skills; however, they were less competent in translating the skills in a clinical context [24]. Similarly, physicians in seven hospitals in KSA scored 80-90% on a 22-item questionnaire regarding their basic computer skills [25]. A cross-sectional study among a diverse group of healthcare professionals in five teaching hospitals in Iran has shown high scores of 83.9% and 80.6% on operational skills and information searching, respectively [26]. A systematic review of pharmacy staff digital literacy levels conducted in 2016 has identified only three studies that lack quantifiable, measurable data on digital literacy [27]. 65.9% of physicians in Wuhan, China, have reported no or little EBP competence regarding medical information retrieval [28]. Family physicians reported a lack of digital and computer skills among major barriers to online health information retrieval [6]. This study is novel in objectively measuring physicians' digital literacy using validated tools. The need to quantify the digital literacy levels of physicians is of utmost importance to better\nunderstand the current situations and propose further research exploring the predictors of digital literacy.\nThis study suggests that information literacy, rather than computer literacy, is associated with better information retrieval efficacy and efficiency among health care professionals. Therefore, there is a need for improvement in the current curricula. EBM has been incorporated into the medical curricula of undergraduate medical students, postgraduate and practicing physicians. However, critical appraisal (Step 3 in evidence-based practice) was the most frequently taught skill, and there was less focus on teaching search strategies and information retrieval skills [29]. The same theme was found in a thematic systematic review of evidence-based practice nursing education, where the focus on critical thinking and analysis was emphasized [30]. Medical librarians consider that information literacy instruction should be mandatory for medical students and delivered through workshops in coordination with medical faculty [31]. A scenario-based workshop delivered by clinical educators and the medical librarian was proven effective by the participants regarding engagement, satisfaction, and reported benefits in actual clinical practice [32]. EBM training resulted in a short-term improvement of knowledge; however, there is a lack of studies that support long-term skills retention beyond one year [33]. There may be a gap between what we teach and what physicians practice in real life, especially with the new surge of summary databases and point-of-care decision tools. Collaboration and communication among faculty, librarians, and students are needed to better understand physicians' current practices and develop educational programs to improve students' and practicing physicians' information literacy skills through interactive learning activities [30, 34]."
