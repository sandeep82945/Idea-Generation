 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the findings and limitations of this paper:

1. Conduct a long-term exposure study (6 months or longer) using the same 150 kHz frequency to determine if more significant effects develop over time. The current study found some histopathological changes after 2 months, so a longer duration may lead to functional impairments.

2. Investigate the effects of chronic exposure on additional organs not examined in depth here, like the reproductive system, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine glands. Expanding the analysis could reveal impacts on other body systems.

3. Repeat the study using different frequencies in the intermediate range (100 kHz - 10 MHz) to see if effects vary based on specific frequencies. This could identify safer vs more harmful frequencies. 

4. Evaluate different exposure levels/intensities, like a dose-response study, to identify potential thresholds for biological impacts. The current intensity used may have been too low to cause major effects.

5. Examine the mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory changes observed in the liver and lungs. This could elucidate the pathogenesis and lead to protective strategies.
