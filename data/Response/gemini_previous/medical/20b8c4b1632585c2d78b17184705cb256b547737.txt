1. **Development of lipid-based nanoparticles for targeted delivery of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)**: ICIs have shown great promise in cancer immunotherapy, but their clinical application is limited by systemic toxicities and low response rates. Lipid-based nanoparticles can be engineered to specifically target tumor cells or immune cells, thereby improving the delivery of ICIs to the tumor microenvironment and reducing systemic side effects.


2. **Exploration of lipid-based nanoparticles for combination immunotherapy**: Lipid-based nanoparticles can be used to deliver multiple therapeutic agents simultaneously, enabling combination immunotherapy strategies. This approach can overcome the limitations of single-agent immunotherapy and improve the overall antitumor efficacy. For example, lipid-based nanoparticles can be used to co-deliver ICIs with other immunomodulatory agents, such as cytokines, chemokines, or adjuvants, to enhance immune responses against cancer.


3. **Development of lipid-based nanoparticles for in situ vaccination**: Lipid-based nanoparticles can be used to deliver antigens and adjuvants directly to the tumor site, creating an in situ vaccine. This approach can induce robust antitumor immune responses and overcome the challenges associated with traditional vaccination strategies, such as poor antigen delivery and limited immune cell activation.


4. **Investigation of lipid-based nanoparticles for modulation of the tumor microenvironment**: The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Lipid-based nanoparticles can be engineered to deliver therapeutic agents that target specific components of the tumor microenvironment, such as tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, or endothelial cells. This approach can reprogram the tumor microenvironment to promote antitumor immunity and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.


5. **Development of lipid-based nanoparticles for personalized cancer immunotherapy**: Lipid-based nanoparticles can be tailored to the individual characteristics of cancer patients, enabling personalized cancer immunotherapy. This approach can be achieved by incorporating patient-specific antigens or tumor-specific targeting ligands into the lipid-based nanoparticles. Personalized cancer immunotherapy can improve the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of immunotherapy by targeting the unique features of each patient's tumor.
