Chen et al. Journal of Nanobiotechnology (2022) 20:466 https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-022-01662-9 conclusions (Fig. 6b, Fig. S13). To comprehensively understand the pathological variation and mechanism of synergistic CDT/PTT, pathological analysis, including H&E, Ki-67 staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) were carried out (Fig. 6f ). For the three laser-treated groups, tumors were isolated at ~ 5 h after laser irradiation, while tumors were isolated at 24  h after the last systemic administration for other groups. The decrease of the number of tumor nuclei was consistent with the effect of tumor treatment, according to the results of H&E staining. Moreover, the tumor tissue of the FTRNPs + MT + laser group showed obvious shrinkage and injury, while the FTRNPs + laser group showed partial damage. For the TUNEL staining, apparent tumor apoptotic cells were observed in the groups treated with FTRNPs. Notably, the FTRNPs + MT + laser group showed the strongest green fluorescence, indicating the enhanced antitumor effect attributed by synergistic CDT/PTT. On the contrary, the FTRNPs + MT + laser group exhibited the weakest fluorescence in the Ki-67 staining results, indicating that the proliferation of tumor cells was seriously impaired after synergistic CDT/PTT. In addition, as shown in the H&E results, the FTRNPs + laser group and the
FTRNPs + MT + laser group showed different degrees of damage, which might be induced by cell necrosis. Meanwhile, as shown in the TUNEL results, the FTRNPs + MT group and the FTRNPs + MT + laser group showed different degrees of cell apoptosis. The results showed that PTT mainly caused tumor cell necrosis, while CDT caused tumor cell apoptosis. Therefore, the combination of CDT/PTT could effectively improve the therapy efficiency. conclusion In conclusion, we have successfully developed a H2O2/acidity cascade-dual-responsive and RGD/magnetic dual-targeting nanoplatform (FTRNPs) for cancer treatment. The FTRNPs after H2O2 treatment exhibited superior photothermal stability and high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 50.9%). The as-prepared FTRNPs exhibited high tumor accumulation in vivo, attributed to the synergistic effect of RGD and magneticactive targeting, which was 3.54-fold higher than that
without active targeting. High imaging and therapeutic specificities were achieved based on Fenton reactions and TMB oxidation, which were activated by elevated H2O2 and acid levels in tumors. The newly developed FTRNPs can significantly reduce the nonspecific signals and treatment side effects routinely encountered by the “always on, single-activated” theranostic agents. More importantly, the photo-chemodynamic therapy achieved noteworthy anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo, exhibiting great potential in future clinical applications. The therapy efficiency of photo-chemodynamic therapy was ~ 97.76%, which was ~ 4-fold higher than that PTT or CDT only. Meanwhile, the FTRNPs had shown high biocompatibility.
