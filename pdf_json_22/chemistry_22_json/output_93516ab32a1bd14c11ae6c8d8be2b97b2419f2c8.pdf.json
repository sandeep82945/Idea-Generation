    "abstractText": "FucoPol is an acylated polysaccharide with demonstrated valuable functional properties that include a shear thinning fluid behaviour, a film-forming capacity, and an emulsion forming and stabilizing capacity. In this study, the different conditions (concentration, temperature, and time) for alkaline treatment were investigated to deacylate FucoPol. Complete deacetylation and desuccinylation was achieved with 0.02 M NaOH, at 60 \u25e6C for 15 min, with no significant impact on the biopolymer\u2019s sugar composition, pyruvate content, and molecular mass distribution. FucoPol depyruvylation by acid hydrolysis was attempted, but it resulted in a very low polymer recovery. The effect of the ionic strength, pH, and temperature on the deacetylated/desuccinylated polysaccharide, d-FucoPol, was evaluated, as well as its emulsion and film-forming capacity. d-FucoPol aqueous solutions maintained the shear thinning behaviour characteristic of FucoPol, but the apparent viscosity decreased significantly. Moreover, contrary to FucoPol, whose solutions were not affected by the media\u2019s ionic strength, the d-FucoPol solutions had a significantly higher apparent viscosity for a higher ionic strength. On the other hand, the d-FucoPol solutions were not affected by the pH in the range of 3.6\u201311.5, while FucoPol had a decreased viscosity for acidic pH values and for a pH above 10.5. Although d-FucoPol displayed an emulsification activity for olive oil similar to that of FucoPol (98 \u00b1 0%) for an oil-to-water ratio of 2:3, the emulsions were less viscous. The d-FucoPol films were flexible, with a higher Young\u2032s modulus (798 \u00b1 152 MPa), a stress at the break (22.5 \u00b1 2.5 MPa), and an elongation at the break (9.3 \u00b1 0.7%) than FucoPol (458 \u00b1 32 MPa, 15.5 \u00b1 0.3 MPa and 8.1 \u00b1 1.0%, respectively). Given these findings, d-FucoPol arises as a promising novel biopolymer, with distinctive properties that may render it useful for utilization as a suspending or emulsifier agent, and as a barrier in coatings and packaging films.",

Structurally, it comprises a main chain\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27217165 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165 2 of 18\ncomposed of a\u21924)-\u03b1-L-Fucp-(1\u21924)-\u03b1-L-Fucp-(1\u21923)-\u03b2-D-Glcp(1\u2192 trimer repeating unit, and a trimer branch \u03b1-D-4,6-pyruvyl-Galp-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-GlcAp-(1\u21923)-\u03b1-D-Galp(1\u2192 in the C-3 of the first fucose [3]. It is an acylated polysaccharide, containing 13\u201314 wt% pyruvyl, 3\u20135 wt% acetyl, and 2\u20133 wt% succinyl as substituent groups [2]. Glucuronic acid, pyruvate, and succinate confer FucoPol an anionic nature that promotes its interaction with charged molecules [2]. FucoPol\u2019s aqueous solutions present a shear-thinning behaviour, with viscoelastic properties comparable to those of guar gum and fucogel [1]. Furthermore, FucoPol possesses valuable functional properties that include an emulsion forming and stabilizing capacity [1,2,4], a film forming [4,5] and gelling capacity [6], as well as biological properties, such as a wound healing ability [7], photoprotection [8], an antioxidant capacity [9], and cryoprotection [3], that potentiate its utilization in several applications. Interchain and/or intrachain interactions between polysaccharide molecules are greatly affected by their degree of substitution and the type of substituent groups [10,11]. The presence of organic acyl groups, such as acetyl, pyruvyl, succinyl, among others, are important for the polysaccharides\u2019 functional properties, including their viscoelastic properties, gelling ability, and bioactivity [10]. Well-studied deacylated polysaccharides include gellan and xanthan gums. For gellan gum, deacetylation induces the formation of harder gels with a higher thermal stability [12] than an acetylated biopolymer. It also improves the capacity to form hydrogels when mixed with cationic surfactants [10], and promotes cation-induced gelation in the presence of Ca2+ in a physiological environment [13]. For xanthan gum, deacetylation increases the gel strength and viscoelasticity [14,15], as well as the formation of films with a higher water absorption behaviour when compared to the acetylated form [16]. Ridout et al. [17] studied the removal of succinyl and acetyl in succinoglycan polysaccharide. Succinyl removal improved the shear thinning behaviour of the aqueous solutions, while increasing the biopolymer\u2019s order-disorder transition cooperativity. When acetyl removal was performed, the order-disorder transition temperature decreased, whereas the succinyl removal increased this physical property. Deacetylation and desuccinylation can be achieved using chemical (e.g., alkaline treatments at a high temperature and/or a high pressure [18]), enzymatic [19], or physical (e.g., ultrasound) treatments [20]. Guetta et al. [21] obtained deacetylated Fucogel by alkaline conditions using 0.1 M NaOH for 30 min at 80 \u25e6C. For chitin deacetylation, Kjartansson et al. [20] used 12.5 M NaOH treatment for 4 h at 100 \u25e6C. Pinto et al. [22] used NaOH and KOH 0.01 M at 25 \u25e6C for 3 h to obtain deacetylated xanthan gum. This study focused on the development of a procedure for the removal of acetyl, succinyl, and pyruvyl substituent groups from the FucoPol macromolecule. The removal of these substituent groups from FucoPol was not studied so far. Alkaline treatments with NaOH were designed and tested for FucoPol\u2019s deacetylation/desuccinylation, while an acid treatment with hydrochloric and oxalic acids was attempted for the pyruvate removal. The impact of the applied treatments on the polysaccharides\u2019 physical-chemical properties were evaluated, including the rheological properties, emulsifying behaviour, and film-forming capacity."

Briefly, the FucoPol samples (5 mg) were dissolved in deionized water (5 mL) and contacted with NaOH, under a\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165 3 of 18\ncontrolled temperature. After the treatment, the samples were cooled to room temperature and extensively dialysed using a 12 kDa MWCO membrane (ZelluTrans/Roth) against deionized water to eliminate the low molecular weight compounds resulting from the hydrolysis procedure and salts. Finally, the samples were freeze-dried (ScanVac CoolSafeTM, LaboGene, Liller\u00f8d, Denmark), at \u2212110 \u25e6C for 48 h. Depyruvylation studies were undertaken on the deacetylated/desuccinylated FucoPol by its hydrolysis with hydrochloric or oxalic acids, following the procedures described by Pinto et al. [22] and Herasimenka et al. [25], respectively. Hydrolysis was achieved using FucoPol solution (1.0 wt%) in hydrochloric acid (2.0 M) at 80 \u25e6C for 16 h. The hydrolysis with oxalic acid (0.5 M) was performed using FucoPol solution (0.1 wt%) at 100 \u25e6C for 2 h. The samples were dialysed and freeze-dried as described above.\nAll assays were performed in duplicate.\n2.3. Physical and Chemical Characterization 2.3.1. Composition\nThe monosaccharides profiles of the deacetylated/desuccinylated FucoPol (herein named d-FucoPol), as well as the original FucoPol were determined by liquid chromatography, using a Carbopac PA10 column (Thermo Scientific\u2122 Dionex\u2122, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), equipped with an amperometric detector. The analysis was performed at 30 \u25e6C with NaOH 4 mM as the eluent, at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. Fucose, glucose, galactose, and glucuronic acid, at a concentration between 5 and 100 ppm, were used as the standards. The acyl substituents groups, namely acetate, succinate, and pyruvate, were quantified by liquid chromatography, using an Aminex HPX-87H 300 \u00d7 7.8 mm column (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) connected to an infrared (IR) detector, using sulfuric acid 0.01 N as the eluent, at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, at 30 \u25e6C. Acetic, succinic, and pyruvic acid were used as the standard at a concentration between 25 and 500 ppm.\n2.3.2. Fourier Transform Infrared analysis\nFourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy with Diamond ATR (attenuated total reflectance) was applied to the spectra collection of the samples with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two (Perkin Elmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), equipped with a lithium tantalate detector with an SNR (signal to noise ratio) of 14.500:1. The resolution was 0.5 cm\u22121 with eight scans. The samples were positioned in the absorbance chamber and corrected by applying the ATR-correction function of Perkin Elmer Spectrum (Waltham, MA, USA) software in the region of 4500\u2013500 cm\u22121 [2].\n2.3.3. Molecular Mass Distribution\nThe average molecular weight (Mw), molecular number (Mn), and polydispersity index (PDI = Mw/Mn) were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The samples were dissolved in deionized water (2\u20134 mg/mL) and injected in a size exclusionhigh-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) system (Knauer, Smartline system 1000, Berlin, Germany), equipped with a Phenomenex Phenogel Linear LC Column (300 mm \u00d7 7.8 mm, Knauer) coupled to a refractive index detector (RI detector, Knauer Smartline 2300). The analysis was performed at 25 \u25e6C with LiNO3 0.1 M as the eluent, at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and an injection volume of 50 \u00b5L. The Mw was estimated after a universal calibration with the pullulans (\u2264600 kDa).\n2.3.4. Thermal Properties\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer Labsys EVO (Setaram, Lyon, France). The samples were arranged in aluminium crucibles and heated until 550 \u25e6C, with a heating rate of 10 \u25e6C/min, in air. The thermal degradation temperature (Tdeg, \u25e6C) corresponds to the temperature value obtained for the maximum decreasing peak of the sample mass [2].\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165 4 of 18\n2.3.5. Intrinsic Viscosity\nThe intrinsic viscosity (\u03b7) was determined by double extrapolation to zero concentration of the Huggins and Kraemer equations, as described by Freitas et al. [1]. The capillary viscosity measurements were performed on an automatic viscosity measuring unit AVS 450 (Schott-Gerate, Mainz, Germany), with an Ubbelhode capillary viscometer (Ref. 53013/Ic, Schott-Gerate, Mainz, Germany) immersed in a water bath at a constant temperature (25 \u00b1 0.5 \u25e6C)."

The emulsification index after 24 h (E24, %) was determined using the following equation [4]:\nE24 = he hT \u00d7 100 (2)\nwhere he (mm) is the emulsion layer height and hT (mm) is the total height of the mixture. The rheological properties of the emulsion were determined as described above.\n2.6. Film-Forming Capacity 2.6.1. Film Preparation\nThe d-FucoPol films were prepared following the procedure described by Freitas et al. [4]. Briefly, the d-FucoPol solutions (1.5 wt%) were prepared by dissolving the polymer in deionized water, under stirring for 12 h, at room temperature. Then, glycerol (86\u201388 wt%, Scharlau) was added as a plasticizer (30 wt%, on a dry basis). After removing the air bubbles under the vacuum, the solution was transferred to plastic Petri dishes (diameter of 6.5 cm) and dried at a temperature of 30 \u25e6C. The formed films were peeled from the dishes\u2019 surface and conditioned at a controlled relative humidity (RH) of 58%, at 22 \u25e6C, for 48 h.\n2.6.2. Morphological Characterization\nThe films\u2019 thickness was measured at three different points using a digital micrometre (Mitutoyo, Andover, UK). The films\u2019 morphology was observed by Scanning Electron\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165 5 of 18\nMicroscopy (SEM) using an SEM Hitachi TM 3030Plus Tabletop (Krefeld, Germany).

The films\u2019 transparency was determined by measuring their transmittance at 600 nm (T600), using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (CamSpec M509T, Leeds, UK), and calculated using the equation [5]:\nTransparency = \u2212 Log T600\nX (3)\nwhere X corresponds to the film\u2019s thickness (mm).\n2.6.3.

The films were cut into rectangular-shaped strips (30 mm \u00d7 15 mm), attached to tensile grips A/TG, and stretched with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/s in tensile mode, until the breaking. The films\u2019 stiffness was determined by the YounG\u2032s modulus (MPa), calculated as the slope of the linear initial section of the stress-strain curve. The tensile strength at the break was determined as the ratio of the maximum force to the films\u2019 initial cross-sectional area. The elongation at the break (MPa) was determined as the ratio of the sample extension upon rupture by the initial gage length. Four replicas were analysed."

            "text": "FucoPol deacetylation and desuccinylation studies in alkaline conditions were performed using several NaOH concentrations, temperatures, and reaction times (Table 1) to define the ones leading to the complete acetyl and succinyl groups\u2019 removal. The original FucoPol sample had succinyl and acetyl contents of 1.1 wt% and 5.8 wt%, respectively, which are within the values reported in previous studies (0.6\u20133.0 wt% and 3.5\u20136.8 wt%, respectively). As shown in Table 1, acetyl was more easily removed from the polymer\u2019s molecule as milder conditions achieved its complete removal. No acetate was detected in the samples treated with an alkali concentration of only 0.01 M, under 60 \u25e6C for 60 min, and at a lower temperature (40 \u25e6C) and for a shorter reaction time (15 min) for NaOH 0.02 M. As reported by Due et al. [26], the hydroxyl group performs a nucleophile attack in the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the acetyl group, resulting in the substitution of the acetyl group by a hydroxyl group. On the other hand, harsher conditions were required for the complete removal of succinyl, namely, a higher NaOH concentration (0.02 M) and a longer reaction time (\u226530 min). Succinyl and pyruvyl have been reported to form strong intra-molecular hydrogen bonds, conferring a higher stability to their ester linkages compared to the acetyl groups [27], which might explain the faster removal of the acetyl groups from the FucoPol. FucoPol depyruvylation was attempted by acid hydrolysis with oxalic acid and hydrochloride acid, following procedures described in the literature for pyruvate removal from xanthan gum [22,25]. However, all treatments in the acidic media were accompanied by a very low polymer recovery, which is probably inherent to the pyruvate branching position (2,3 linkage instead of 4,6 position, which is more often encountered) [3,22]. Given these results, treatment with NaOH 0.02 M at 60 \u25e6C for 15 min was selected as the most suitable to reach complete deacetylation and desuccinylation, while saving on alkali usage and the reaction time. The deacetylated and desuccinylated FucoPol was named d-FucoPol.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165 6 of 18\n3.2. Physical and Chemical Characterization of the Deacetylated/Desuccinylated FucoPol 3.2.1. Sugar Composition\nThe compositional analysis of d-FucoPol showed that the alkaline deacetylation/ desuccinylation treatment had no significant impact on the polysaccharide\u2019s monosaccharide structure, which remained identical to that of the original FucoPol sample. The fucose and galactose contents (37 and 27 mol%, respectively) remained essentially the same (36 and 28 mol%, respectively), while a slight increase in the glucose content was noticed for d-FucoPol (29 mol%, compared to 26 mol% for FucoPol). There was also a reduction in the content of glucuronic acid from 10 to 7 mol%. Deacetylation leads to the removal of acetyl protecting groups in glucuronic acid and to the formation of \u03b2-D-glucosiduronic acid, which could explain the slight decrease in the content of glucuronic acid detected after this chemical reaction [28]. The analysis showed a sugar content increase of approximately 8% from the polymer\u2019s dry weight, which is in agreement with the removal of the substituents (acetate and succinate).\n3.2.2. Structural Analysis\nAs shown in Figure 1, the FT-IR spectrum of d-FucoPol is similar to that reported in the literature for FucoPol [1,2,7], displaying peaks around 3283\u20132925 cm\u22121, which are attributed to the O-H stretching of hydroxyls\u2019 vibrations and the C-H stretching peak of the CH2 groups; around 970\u20131145 cm\u22121, which are related to the C-C and C-O stretching in the pyranoid ring and C-O-C stretching of glycosidic bonds; and at 1603 cm\u22121, which is associated with the bending vibration of O-H, indicating bound water [2]. The main difference noticed for d-FucoPol is the absence of the peak at 1720 cm\u22121 (corresponding to the C=O stretching vibrations of carbonyls), and a noticeable peak intensity decrease at 1261 cm\u22121 (C-O-C vibrations), which are probably related to the removal of the acetyl e succinyl groups from the macromolecule [26,29\u201331]. Additionally, the peak appearing at 1403 cm\u22121, which may be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of carboxylates from glucuronic acid [2], had a decreased intensity compared to the FucoPol spectrum, that might be correlated with the observed decrease in the polymer\u2019s glucuronic content (from 10 to 7 mol%).\n3.2.3. Molecular Mass Distribution\nd-FucoPol showed an average Mw of 2.7\u00d7 106 Da and a PDI of 1.7, which are within the ranges reported in previous studies (Mw = 1.7\u00d7 106 \u2212 5.8\u00d7 106 Da; PDI = 1.3\u20131.9) [1,2,6,7,32]. Contrary results were obtained by Wang et al. [33] where the deacetylation reduced the molecular weight of native xanthan gum (from 1.1 \u00d7 106 to 1.0 \u00d7 106 Da) [33]. The same\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165 7 of 18\nwas reported for succinoglycan, where the removal process of the acetyl and succinyl groups decreased the molecular weight from 1.2 \u00d7 106 to 1.1 \u00d7 106 Da [17].

FT\u2212IR spectra of FucoPol (green line) and d-FucoPol (grey line).\n3.2.3. Molecular Mass Distribution d-FucoPol showed an average Mw of 2.7 \u00d7 106 Da and a PDI of 1.7, which are within the ranges reported in previous studies (Mw = 1.7 \u00d7 106 \u2212 5.8 \u00d7 106 Da; PDI = 1.3\u20131.9) [1,2,6,7,32]. Contrary results were obtained by Wang et al. [33] where the deacetylation reduced the molecular weight of native xanthan gum (from 1.1 \u00d7 106 to 1.0 \u00d7 106 Da) [33]. The same was reported for succinoglycan, where the removal process of the acetyl and succinyl groups decreased the molecular weight from 1.2 \u00d7 106 to 1.1 \u00d7 106 Da [17]. These findings confirm that the applied alkaline treatments had no significant impact on the biopolymer\u2019s molecular mass distribution.\n3.2.4. Thermal Properties FucoPol and d-FucoPol displayed similar TGA curves, with two degradation steps (Figure 2) [2,6]. In the first degradation step, occurring between 40 and around 150\u2013160 \u00b0C, similar weight losses were found for both samples (11\u201313%), which corresponded to the loss of the water adsorbed to the polysaccharides due to their hygroscopic nature [2]. The second and main degradation step occurred between 196 and 320 \u00b0C, with weight losses of around 41% for both samples, which can be attributed to the thermal depolymerization of the polysaccharides\u2019 chains and the dehydration of the saccharide rings [34].

Apparent Viscosity\nd-FucoPol\u2019s aqueous solutions displayed a shear-thinning behaviour (Figure 3), imilar to that of FucoPol and typical of high molecular weight polysaccharides [2,37], for all three tested polymer concentrations (0.75, 1.5, and 3.0 wt%). A clear increase in the apparent viscosity is observed when increasing the polymer concentration which was tested. However, the thickening capacity of d-Fucopol was considerably lower than that of FucoPol (Fig re 3). Indeed, the 1.5 wt% d-FucoPol solution displayed a zer -shear viscosit of 1.61 \u00b1 0.01 Pa.s, which is consid rably lower than the value (17.40 \u00b1 0.04 Pa.s) found for a 1.0 wt% [2] and for 1.5 wt% (64.78 \u00b1 0.31 Pa.s) FucoPol solution (Table 2). These results suggest that the acetyl and/or succinyl groups were probably responsible for promoting intermolecular interactions in the FucoPol solutions, contributing to its higher apparent viscosity [10], thus, their removal resulted in the observed lower viscosity. For both polymer types, higher \u03b70 v lues are associated with higher est mated \u03c4 values, represe ting higher relaxation times. The highest \u03b70 value was observed for the 3.0 wt% d-FucoPol solution (29.5 \u00b1 0.09 Pa.s) (Table 2), which was chosen for the subsequent tests for evaluating the effect of the ionic strength, pH, and temperature on d-FucoPol\u2019s viscoelastic properties.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165 9 of 18 Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 19\nFigure 3.

This fact indicates that less time is needed to form new interactions between polymer molecules at higher temperatures. Consequently, the transition from the Newtonian plateau to the shear-thinning regime is less evident and moves to the higher shear rate values [32].\nAs expected, the G\u2032\u2032 > G\u2032 at low frequencies, indicating a liquid-like behaviour (Table 3; Figure 5C). Moreover, the dynamic crossover, after which the elastic contribution is predominant, occurs at increasingly higher values as the temperature increases. At low temperatures (10 and 25 \u25e6C), the crossover occurred at lower frequencies (0.6\u20131.0 Hz), indicating a more entangled system storing most of the energy received [32,39]. However, at higher temperatures (65 and 80 \u25e6C), the crossover was perceived at 10 Hz (Table 3; Figure 5C(d,e)), showing a much lower number of polymer interactions needing a higher frequency energy input to notice a larger amount of energy stored compared to that dissipated [40]."

Consequently, the transition from the Newtonian plateau to the shear-thinning regime is less evident and moves to the higher shear rate values [32]. As expected, the G\u201d > G\u2019 at low frequencies, indicating a liquid-like behaviour (Table 3; Figure 5C). Moreover, the dynamic crossover, after which the elastic contribution is predominant, occurs at increasingly higher values as the temperature increases. At low temperatures (10 and 25 \u00b0C), the crossover occurred at lower frequencies (0.6\u20131.0 Hz), indicating a more entangled system storing most of the energy received [32,39]. However, at higher temperatures (65 and 80 \u00b0C), the crossover was perceived at 10 Hz (Table 3; Figure 5C(d,e)), showing a much lower number of polymer interactions needing a higher frequency energy input to notice a larger amount of energy stored compared to that dissipated [40].\n3.4. Emulsion Forming and Stabilizing Capacity The ability of d-FucoPol to form and stabilize emulsions was assessed and compared with that of FucoPol, which has been reported as a good emulsifier for several oils [1,2,4]. The emulsions were prepared by mixing the d-FucoPol aqueous solution (1.0 wt%) with olive oil, the test hydrophobic compound, at an o:w weight ratio of 2:3. The results (Table 4) show that d-FucoPol had an identical emulsifying ability (E24 = 98%) to FucoPol (E24 = 81\u201398%) [2,46] under similar conditions. The microscopic observation (Figure 6a) of the emulsion displayed dispersed oil droplets in the aqueous phase, a characteristic of oil-inwater (O/W) emulsions [47,48]. Additionally, the emulsions\u2019 droplets rapidly dispersed in the filter paper wetting test (Figure 6b), thus confirming its O/W nature [49\u201351].\nTable 4.

This flow behaviour is a common attribute of emulsions, in which the individual droplets and/or aggregated droplet clusters are deformed and disturbed by imposed forces at higher shear rates, leading to a reduction in both the flow resistance and viscosity [52]. The experimental results were fitted to the Cross model and the resulting parameters are given in Table 4. The \u03b70 value observed for the d-FucoPol emulsion (13.92 \u00b1 2.36 Pa.s) was lower than that of the FucoPol emulsion (46.5 \u00b1 5.3 Pa.s) (Table 4), thus suggesting that the FucoPol\u2019s acetyl and succinyl substituents are relevant for the emulsion to maintain a high apparent viscosity, as previously reported for chitin and for the polysaccharide from Millettia speciosa Champ [53,54]. In fact, the presence of acetyl groups is known to contribute to the reduction in interfacial tension and the increase in the rate of the molecules\u2019 adsorption into the interface, which leads to the expeditious formation of smaller droplets [52]. This alteration\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7165 13 of 18\nin the viscosity of the interdroplet aqueous solution may be the main cause of variation in the emulsion\u2019s viscosity [55].\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19\nFigure 7.

Film-Forming Capacity 3.5.1. Morphological Characterization\nThe d-FucoPol formed slightly opaque flexible films with a brownish tone (Figure 8a) and a thickness of 45 \u00b1 12 \u00b5m (Figure 8c). The films\u2019 transparency was 5.16 \u00b1 1.09, a value higher than that reported for the native FucoPol films (3.67) [5], thus indicating that the deacetylation and desuccinylation of the polysaccharide slightly increased its film opacity [61]. Transparency is important in packaging applications, providing see through properties and preventing light transmission [62,63], and in wound dressings to accurately monitor wound healing [64]. The films\u2019 complete solubilization when placed in water indicated the inexistence of cross-linking reactions [5]. As shown by the SEM images, the films were compact (Figure 8c) with a smooth surface (Figure 8b). Regarding the FucoPol films\u2019 morphology, the study of Ferreira et al. [65] revealed that it was constituted by a dense and irregular structure.\nFigure 8.

This fact is frequently caused by t e formation of a network composed of polymer chains and oil droplets, leading to a higher resistance to the flow under a steady shear [56]. The same was observed for the emulsions stabilized with the native FucoPol [2].\nInterestingly, the d-FucoPol stabilized emulsion presented the G\u2032 higher than the G\u2032\u2032\nacross the whole frequency range (0.01\u201310 Hz) (Figure 7b) and did not display any crossover, meaning that the oil/deacylated polymer emulsions displayed a gel-like behaviour [57,58]. Gel-like emulsions have been shown to be suitable for cosmetic applications because this elastic mechanical property favours the emulsion stability over long storage periods. Moreover, this structure was demonstrated to improve the moisturizing properties in emulsions with a shear-thinning behaviour [59]. This observation can be related to the formation of a three-dimensional network, supported by the development of an entangled network between absorbed and non-absorbed biopolymer molecules, which impacts the hydrocolloid properties of the emulsion [57,58,60]. This behaviour was not observed for the emulsions prepared with FucoPol in its native form [46] that presented a liquid-like behaviour, where the G\u2032\u2032 > G\u2032 for frequencies of 0.02\u20130.6 Hz (Figure 7b).\n3.5.

[65] revealed that it was constituted by a dense and irregular structure.\n3.5.2. Mechanical Properties\nThe d-FucoPol films showed a higher mechanical resistance (Table 5) compared to the films prepared with the native FucoPol, illustrated by the higher Young\u2019s modulus (798 \u00b1 152 MPa), concomitant with a higher stress at the break (22.46 \u00b1 2.54 MPa) and a higher elongation at the break (9.27 \u00b1 0.66%) [4]. According to Jin et al. [30], deacylation promotes the film\u2019s strength and cohesiveness, which gives an indication of the film\u2019s stiffness. In terms of the polysaccharide films\u2019 mechanical properties, these are heavily determined by three factors: the intrinsic characteristics of the chosen biopolymer; the presence of additives (plasticizers, cross-linking agents, and film formation promoters); and the polymeric matrix water content which is present during the mechanical measurements [5,66]. For these reasons, the comparison of the films\u2019 mechanical properties obtained in different investigations is challenging due to the subjective nature of the reported results which are usually obtained under specific conditions."
