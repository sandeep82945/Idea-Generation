1. **Investigate the relationship between the WEF Nexus Index and other development indicators.** This could help to identify the factors that contribute to high and low WEF Nexus Index scores, and to develop policies that promote sustainable development.
2. **Conduct case studies of countries that have successfully implemented WEF nexus approaches.** This could provide valuable lessons for other countries that are seeking to improve their WEF nexus performance.
3. **Develop new indicators for measuring the WEF nexus.** The current WEF Nexus Index is based on a limited number of indicators, and there is a need for more comprehensive measures that capture the full complexity of the WEF nexus.
4. **Explore the use of the WEF Nexus Index to inform policy decisions.** The WEF Nexus Index can be used to identify areas where there are trade-offs between different resource sectors, and to develop policies that minimize these trade-offs.
5. **Develop a methodology for assessing the impact of WEF nexus interventions.** This would help to ensure that WEF nexus interventions are effective and that they are not having unintended negative consequences.
