However, the intricate interplay between soil physical and chemical attributes, the soil microbial community, and their combined influence on soil humus composition remains poorly understood.\nMethods: Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of natural vegetation restoration on soil properties, microbial community diversity, and composition in the sodasaline soil region of the Songnen Plain. We conducted assessments of soil physical and chemical properties, analyzed community diversity, and composition at a soil depth range of 0\u201320 cm. The study covered soils with dominant soda-saline vegetation species, including Suaeda glauca Bunge, Puccinellia chinampoensis Ohwi, Chloris virgata Swarta, Phragmites australis (Clay.), Leymus chinensis (Trin.), and Tzvelev. We compared these vegetated soils to bare land devoid of any plants.\nResults: We found that soil organic content (SOC) in vegetation restoration areas was higher than in bare land, with SOC content varying between 3.64 and 11.15 g/kg in di erent vegetated areas. Notably, soil pH emerged as a pivotal factor, explaining 11.4% and 12.2% of the variance in soil bacteria and fungi, respectively. There were correlations between SOC content and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups, with Acidobacteria and Mortierella showing a positive correlation, while Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Ascomycota exhibited significant negative correlations with SOC.\nDiscussion: The disparities in SOC composition and content among the sodasaline vegetation types were primarily attributed to variations in pH. Consequently, reducing soil pH is identified as a critical step in the process of vegetation restoration in soda-saline land. Prohibiting grazing has the potential to increase soda-saline SOC content and enhance microbial diversity, with Leymus chinensis and Phragmites australis showing particularly promising results in terms of higher SOC carbon content and microbial diversity.\nKEYWORDS\nvegetation restoration, physical properties of soil, soil humus carbon component, sodasaline soil, soil microorganism\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 01 frontiersin.org"

            "heading": "1. Introduction",
            "text": "The western part of the Songnen Plain is located in the northeast of China. It is one of the three major soda-saline soil regions in the world (Yang et al., 2016), with an area of 3.42\u00d7106 ha (Wang et al., 2003). NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 are the main salts there, with soil pHmostly above 8.5, often ranging between 9.0 and 10.5, which is the characteristic pH value of severe soda-saline land (Chi et al., 2011). In the past, due to long-term salinization and human disturbances, the grassland in this region has suffered severe degradation, leading to a decline in soil productivity and almost no surface vegetation (Zhao et al., 2022). To restore the damaged ecosystem, a no-grazing policy has been implemented since 2002, allowing natural vegetation to regrow and restore soil quality and functionality. After years of regeneration, there has been an increase in vegetation cover, and a relatively stable natural ecology has been established through long-term succession. Additionally, diverse plant communities have emerged due to variations in microtopography, habitats, and degrees of degradation. Plants such as Suaeda salsa, Puccinellia chinampoensis, Phragmites australis, Chloris virgata, and Leymus chinensis exhibit a patchy distribution across plots with different levels of salinization (Figure 1).\nThe status and movement of soil water and salt determine the formation of different vegetation communities, while the change in soil salinity is influenced by various factors, such as climate conditions, surface and subsurface water, vegetation types, and field management. Vegetation growth also contributes to the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) (Mahmood et al., 1994). SOM is a mixture of special polymer compounds formed by animal and plant residues in the soil under the action of soil organisms (K\u00f6gel-Knabner, 2002). The main active components of SOM are humic substances (HS), which are produced by chemical activities in natural environments, including aquatic ecosystems, soils, and sediments, and have a major impact on biogeochemical processes (DiDonato et al., 2016; Zaiets and Poch, 2016). HS can be further classified into the groups of humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and humin (HM) (Kou et al., 2022). HA and FA are the most active components in soil HS and play important roles in enhancing soil aggregation, maintaining soil fertility, increasing soil buffering capacity, and regulating pH (Lehmann and Kleber, 2015). Different soil types have different HA/FA ratios (Kluc\u030c\u00e1kov\u00e1, 2018; Ampong et al., 2022). At the same time, this ratio is related to soil fertility (Kononova, 2013). SOM belongs to the soil solid phase, and most of it combines with minerals to form organomineral complexes or microaggregates of different sizes. High soil salinity has a certain impact on the structure, composition, and characteristics of soil humus, which are closely related to the properties and fertility of the soil. Therefore, the study of the correlation between salinity and humus composition in soda-saline soil is of great theoretical and practical significance for the formation, regeneration, and decomposition of humus in sodasaline soil, revealing the migration and transmission mechanisms of substances between saline soil and vegetation types.\nThe soil microbiome plays a pivotal role in soil ecological processes (Hartmann and Six, 2022). Soil electrical conductivity and soil sodium ion content are the primary factors influencing the structure and composition of soil bacterial communities in sodasaline land (Wang S. et al., 2020). Notably, soil salinity not only\nsignificantly diminishes bacterial richness but also affects bacterial community composition (Guan et al., 2021). In a study by Chang et al. (2022), it was revealed that soda-saline soils covered with natural vegetation have positive effects on soil physicochemical properties and prokaryotic communities, as opposed to highly saline bare sodic spots. Generally, diverse plant communities create distinct soil environments, leading to shifts in soil microbial communities (Wang X. et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2022). These alterations in microbial diversity and community composition undoubtedly influence the interplay between the microbiome and nutrient cycling, subsequently affecting plant growth in saline soils.\nConversely, certain fungi, such as mycorrhizae, possess the capacity to assist plants in resource acquisition and high salinity tolerance within stressful settings (Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, fungi collaborate with bacteria to uphold the stability of soil microbial networks and contribute to ecosystem functionalities (Li et al., 2022). Revegetation affects land productivity and the hydrological cycle and changes the structure and function of soil microbial communities and humus. Soil microorganisms and humus are the main components of soil organic carbon, and they play an important role in the soil carbon cycle and global carbon balance. However, there is still a lack of systematic research on the changes and mechanisms of soil microorganisms and humus in different stages of vegetation degradation in the Songnen Plain.\nBased on the aforementioned considerations, we postulate that soils encompassing various plant communities exhibit distinct organic matter components and diminished salt stress. Consequently, the soil within diverse plant communities harbors greater microbial diversity functionality than the highly saline and alkaline barren soil patches. To scrutinize this conjecture, we studied the diversity and composition of both bacterial and fungal communities in soils beneath five halophytic communities within a soda-saline ecosystem. Our analysis encompassed the measurements of soil pH, electrical conductivity, salinity, organic matter composition, salt stress, and microbial functions. We quantified the ratio of soil bacteria to archaea and assessed fungal diversity and composition using advanced high-throughput sequencing techniques. Notably, we identified indicator taxa that exhibited a significant association with specific habitats. Primarily, the present study aimed to explore the impact of distinct vegetation types on organic matter composition and the interrelationship of microorganisms within soda-saline soils."

Soda-saline meadow soil is the dominant soil type. Due to grazing before 2002, the experimental area has been exposed to heavy salinity for a long time, characterized by severe grassland degradation and low vegetation cover. Since early 2002, grazing has been prohibited on grasslands,\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 02 frontiersin.org\nleading to a subsequent increase in vegetation coverage. Over the course of several years, through long-term succession, a relatively stable and natural ecological system has been established. Additionally, diverse plant communities arose as a result of variations in minor topography, habitat, and degree of degradation.\nWe divided the study site into 80 plots of 15 \u00d7 15m each, which were randomly assigned to one of five treatments (Figure 1).

Finally, 24 mixed soil samples (6 vegetation variants \u00d7 4 replicates) were obtained. Shoots, roots, and gravel were manually removed from the soil samples. Soil samples were then passed through a 2-mm sieve and divided into three equal aliquots. The first one was air-dried at room temperature and used for physicochemical analysis; the second sample was immediately frozen at \u221280\u25e6C and used for microbiological analysis; and the third sample was also air-dried at room temperature but kept in a dark and dry place for backup purposes."

The analysis and determination methods for soil humus and optical properties were adopted from the study by Dou (2010). Specific experimental operations were as follows: 5.00 g of oil passed through a 0.25-millimeter sieve was weighed into a lowspeed centrifuge tube; 30ml of distilled water was added and stirred evenly with a glass rod; the tube was then placed on a constant temperature water bath oscillator (70 \u00b1 2\u25e6C, 145 r/min) for 1 h and centrifuged at a low speed of 3,500 r/min for 15min. The supernatant was filtered into a 50-ml volumetric bottle with a quantitative filter paper, and the residue was washed once with 20ml distilled water to obtain WSS (water-extracted organic matter). Moreover, 30ml of lye mixed from 0.1 mol/L NaOH and Na4P2O7 was added to the residue in the centrifugation tube, mixed evenly with a glass rod, and then extracted for 1 h by shaking on a constant temperature water bath oscillator (70 \u00b1 2\u25e6C, 145 r/min). After the removal, it was centrifuged at 3,500 r/min for 15min, filtered with a quantitative filter paper into a 50-ml volumetric bottle, and the residue was washed with 20-ml mixed lye, filtered into the volumetric bottle, and filled up with distilled water to a constant volume. The soluble solution is HE (extractable humus substance). Then, 30ml of the HE solution was poured into a 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask, and 0.5 mol/L of H2SO4 solution was added to adjust the pH to 1.0\u20131.5. The acidified solution was incubated in a water bath at 60\u201370\u25e6C for 2 h and left to rest overnight. The following day, the solution was filtered with a quantitative filter paper, the precipitate was HA (humic acid), and the solution was FA (fulvic acid). The HA precipitate was washed three times with a 0.05-mol/L H2SO4 solution, and the solution was discarded. Finally, the HA precipitate was dissolved in a warm (60\u25e6C) 0.05-mol/L NaOH solution in a 50-ml volumetric bottle and finally dissolved in a 0.05-mol/L NaOH solution. The residue in the centrifuge tube was humin (HM), which was washed in distilled water three times. After centrifugation, the precipitate was dried, finely ground, and screened for determination. FA and HA\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 03 frontiersin.org\nwere measured using a Shimadzu TOC analyzer (TOC-L, CPH). Analysis of SOM andHMwas performed using the K2CrO7-H2SO4 oxidation method (Walkley and Black, 1934).\nThe PQ value is an indicator of the degree of humification in the soil. It is commonly used to assess the maturity and stability of soil organic matter. The PQ value is calculated by dividing the content of humic acid (HA) by the sum of humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA). A higher PQ value indicates a higher proportion of humic acid in the organic matter, indicating a higher degree of humification. The changes in PQ value can reflect the processes of organic matter formation and decomposition in the soil and the influence of environmental factors such as soil texture and vegetation type on organic matter. The calculation formula is as follows:\nPQ = HA\nHA+ FA (1)\nA 1:5 soil-water ratio was used to extract and analyze water-\nsoluble salts. pH, EC, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, CO2\u22123 , HCO \u2212 3 , Cl\u2212, SO2\u22124 and other major ion concentrations were determined. A conductivity meter was used to measure EC1:5, and a pH meter was used to measure soil pH1:5. Na +, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ion concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and CO2\u22123 and HCO \u2212 3 were determined using double indicator neutralization titration. Cl\u2212 ions were determined using silver nitrate titration and SO2\u22124 ions using barium sulfate turbidimetry.\nThe soil sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is an indicator that measures the relative proportion between the content of sodium ion and the content of other ions, such as calcium and magnesium, in the soil. It can be used to assess the degree of soil salinization and alkalization. SAR is calculated using Equation 2 (Chi et al., 2011):\nSAR = [Na+] \u221a\n([Ca2+]+ [Mg2+])/2 , (2)\nwhere [Na+], [Ca2+], and [Mg2+] are the corresponding ion concentrations in mmolc/L, and the unit of SAR is (mmolc/L).\nTotal alkalinity was calculated using the following formula:\nTotal alkalinity = CO2\u22123 +HCO \u2212 3 (mmolc/L) (3)\nMean weight diameter (MWD) stands for mean weight diameter, which is a measure of soil aggregate stability. Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles that are bound together by various forces. Soil aggregate stability indicates how well the aggregates resist breaking apart when exposed to external forces, such as water or wind erosion. Soil aggregate stability is important for soil structure, water infiltration, nutrient cycling, and plant growth. The wet sieving method was used to divide soil aggregates into four size fractions: (i) macroaggregates (>2.0mm), (ii) small aggregates (0.25\u20132.0mm), (iii) microaggregates (0.053\u20130.25mm), and (iv) silt and clay (<0.053mm). Approximately 100 g of airdried soil moistened to field capacity after soaking was immersed in water over a sieve (2mm, 1mm, 0.25mm, and 0.053mm), oscillating at a frequency of 30 times per minute for 2min with a vertical amplitude of 3 cm. Soil aggregates on the sieve were\ncollected, dried at 50\u25e6C for 3 days, and weighed. Material passing through the 0.053-mm sieve was not collected but calculated by subtracting the remaining weight from the total 100 g.\nThe MWD was calculated using Equation 4:\nMWD =\nn \u2211\ni=1\nXi Wi, (4)\nwhere Xi is the average diameter (mm) of sieved aggregates in any particle size range and Wi is the weight percentage (%) of aggregates in any particle size range, where i= 1, 2, . . . , 4 represent the aggregate size classes such as >2.0mm, 0.25\u20132.0mm, 0.053\u2013 0.25mm, and <0.053mm, respectively (Kemper and Rosenau, 1986)."

Eleven phyla of fungi were identified, with the most prevalent being Ascomycota (61.77%), Mortierellomycota (10.69%), and Basidiomycota (5.26%). Among bacteria, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in LC, CV, and PA was significantly decreased and Acidobacteria was significantly increased in LC and PA community soils (Figure 2). In addition, Verrucomicrobia and Patescibacteria were increased in LC soil. The abundance of Bacteroidetes and Gemmatimonadetes was highest in SG soil. Most of the fungi belonged to Ascomycota, especially in SG and CV community soil samples. PA and LC communities promoted the abundance of Mortierellomycota, and BL provided the highest abundance of Mucoromycota out of all communities.\nThe 30 genera of bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed further to compare their relative abundance, indicator species status, and ecological functions in different plant communities. The relative abundance of the 30 most abundant genera accounted for 20.61% and 37.19% of bacterial and fungal abundance, respectively (Figure 3). Most of these genera (29 for bacteria and 29 for fungi) were also identified as indicator taxa. Abundant bacteria came from Proteobacteria, Planctomonas, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria, belonging to Halomonas, Nitrolancea, and Urania-1B-19_marine_sediment_group. Rhodopirellula is a unique indicator genus of BL. Indicator species belong to the CV community, including Pir4_lineage, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Blastocatella, Stenotrophobacter, and Flavisolibacter. LC has its own indicators: Pirellula, RB41, Streptomyces, AKYG587, and Candidatus_Udaeobacter. Ralstonia, Bryobacter, Sphingomonas, Flavobacterium,Nitrospira, Terrimonas, and Subgroup_10 are indicator species belonging to the PA plant community.

The abundant fungi come from Ascomycota, and the indicator species of the BL community include Cercospora, Ascochyta, Cunninghamella, Candida, and Aspergillus. Periconia is not an indicator species; the rest are indicator species of different plant communities.\nIn the soda-saline environment (Figure 4), among the bacteria, the diversity of PA was the highest, followed by LC, which was higher than that in other communities. In fungi, the diversity of LC was the highest, and the Shannon index of SG was significantly lower than that of the BL plant community. In addition, the observed species of the phylogenetic bacterial community of ASV, Fisher, Chao1, and ACE were positively correlated with the fungal community (Figure 5).\nPCoA plots based on Bray-Curtis distances clearly showed that there were significant differences between fungal and bacterial soil microbial communities (Supplementary Table S2). In the case of bacteria, environmental factors explained 33.3% of the community variation, and for fungi, environmental factors explained 35.8% of the community variation. Variations in bacterial and fungal communities were mainly explained by pH. The SOC explained more variation for fungi (0.086 vs. 0.063) than bacteria (Figure 6)."

Owing to the high pH of the soil and its high electrical conductivity, the rate of soil humification was affected, the accumulation of humus was reduced, and the conversion rate of FA to HA in the soil was also slow, resulting in a low PQ value (Zhao et al., 2019). With the regeneration of LC communities, biomass increases, which strengthens the arrangement of soil particles, further promotes the assembly of microaggregates into macroaggregates, and enhances soil structural stability with higher MWD, which helps keep organic matter from erosion and decomposition (Zhao et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2021). In our study, SOCs of different vegetation communities showed an obvious increasing trend from bare land to squares covered by adapted vegetation. Regarding the increase in soil HA and FA contents with increasing SOC content, the increase in SOC content under different vegetation types was also accompanied by higher MWD and higher proportions of HA and FA in SOM, indicating improved soil structure and humus quality. For different vegetation types, soil salinity and soil organic carbon content showed a significant negative correlation, and salinity had a small correlation with soil PQ value (Supplementary Figure S1). This showed that soil salinity under different plant communities affected the total soil organic carbon content. In the case of high salinity, soil organic carbon content was low. High salinity affects the growth of plants and reduces the return of organic residues to the soil, resulting in a decrease in soil organic matter.\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 09 frontiersin.org\nSpontaneous vegetation regeneration significantly influences the diversity or richness of soil microbial communities (Liu et al., 2021). Chang et al. (2022) sequenced soil bacterial communities under different vegetation conditions and found that vegetation coverage can significantly increase bacterial ACE, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson index communities. This is consistent with our findings that plant community reestablishment can enhance soil microbial diversity. Our results showed that Proteus, Acidobacteria, Actinomycetes, Bacteroidetes, and Monoas are the main bacterial species at all examined vegetated sites. In communities with higher SOC, such as LC and PA, the abundance of the Acidobacteria phylum is significantly increased. In addition, the abundance of the Actinomycetes phylum decreased, which is consistent with findings from previous studies and shows that these phyla are common and ubiquitous in soil (Dai et al., 2017). Acidobacteria harbor a broad library of carbohydrate-active enzymes that encode a wide range of carbohydrates and are involved in the breakdown, utilization, and biosynthesis of a wide variety of carbohydrates (Dedysh and Damst\u00e9, 2018). Acidobacteria play a beneficial role by selectively regulating the ecological processes of the host ecosystem. These bacteria provide two important ecological services, namely SOM decomposition and denitrification, to enhance carbon stability (Banerjee et al., 2018). These bacteria may enhance the key ecological process of soil carbon fixation. As members of Acidobacteria have been identified as the structural and functional cornerstone of the plant-soil microbiome and agricultural ecosystem (Kalam et al., 2020), studies have shown that Acidobacteria have a positive effect on plant root growth (da Rocha et al., 2010). Therefore, their existence can improve the performance and productivity of plants. Actinomycetes are K-strategy microorganisms resistant to stress (B\u00e9rard et al., 2015).\nMost of the fungi belonged to Ascomycota. SG and CV significantly increased the abundance of Ascomycota. PA and LC plant communities increased the abundance of Mortierellomycota. BL significantly increased the relative abundance of Mucoromycota. It was reported in the literature that Ascomycetes were not adapted to grow in high-nutrient environments (Wu et al., 2019). Therefore, the increase in the relative abundance of Ascomycetes resulted from the higher salinity and lower organicmatter content of SG and CV plant communities.\nAccording to the redundancy analysis, the content and composition of soil organic matter varied significantly among different plant communities, which was mainly related to bacterial communities, pH, MWD, and fungal communities (Supplementary Figure S2). Among these factors, pH was the most important factor causing the difference in microbial communities (Figure 5). As the plant residues enter the soil, the differences in the microbial communities of plant communities lead to differences in the nature of soil organic matter produced by the decomposition of the residues (Kallenbach et al., 2016; Domeignoz-Horta et al., 2021). LC and PA plant communities can reduce soil pH, cause soil particles to aggregate (Wong et al., 2010), improve soil aggregation, protect soil organic matter from decomposition (Zhang et al., 2021), and change the soil microbial community, increasing soil organic matter content. This indicates that soil pH can indirectly affect the content and composition of soil organic matter by regulating soil microbial communities and soil aggregation ability,\nwhich shows that reducing soil pH is a key step in the process of restoring vegetation in soda-saline soil to increase soil carbon sequestration and fertility in the future."

            "text": "During our soda-saline vegetation restoration tests, distinct plant communities exhibited the capacity to elevate SOC content and modify its composition compared to bare land. Concurrently, there was a noticeable enhancement in soil aggregation, bolstering plant productivity. Furthermore, these findings underscore the pivotal role of soil microbial communities in orchestrating organic matter alterations. An affirmative correlation was established between SOC content, Acidobacteria, and Mortierella, while Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Ascomycota, and SOC content displayed significant negative correlations. Notably, pH emerged as a potent explanatory factor, accounting for 11.4% and 12.2% of the variability observed in soil bacteria and fungi, respectively. Hence, pH emerged as the primary driver behind microbial transformations. The observed disparities in SOC composition and content within soda-saline vegetation can primarily be attributed to variations in pH levels.\nConsequently, reducing soil pH emerges as a pivotal step in the prospective process of vegetation restoration in sodasaline environments. The prohibition of grazing practices holds the potential to elevate soda-saline SOC content and foster microbial diversity. Among the spectrum of different vegetation types, Leymus chinensis and Phragmites australis stand out due to their heightened SOC carbon content and microbial diversity."
