The current study assessed the performance of 122 active-duty police officers during a realistic lethal force scenario to examine whether performance was affected by the officer\u2019s level of operational skills training, years of police service, and stress reactivity. Results demonstrated that the scenario produced elevated heart rates (i.e., 150 beats per minute), as well as perceptual and cognitive distortions, such as tunnel vision, commensurate with those observed in naturalistic use of force encounters. The average performance rating from the scenario was 59%, with 27% of participants making at least one lethal force error. Elevated stress reactivity was a predictor of poorer performance and increased lethal force errors. Level of training and years of police service had differential and complex effects on both performance and lethal force errors. Our results illustrate the need to critically reflect on police training practices and continue to make evidence-based improvements to training. The findings also highlight that while training may significantly improve outcomes, flawless performance is likely not probable, given the limits of human performance under stress. Implications for the objective reasonableness standard, which is used to assess the appropriateness of force in courts of law, are discussed.\nKeywords: police, stress, training, use of force, objective reasonableness standard\nINTRODUCTION\nPolice officers encounter critical incidents that have the hallmark characteristics of a situation that would cause a physiological stress response: namely \u2013 they are unpredictable, potentially uncontrollable, novel, and often involve time pressure (Sapolsky, 2004; Alison and Crego, 2012; Violanti, 2014). Under these circumstances, officers are occasionally required to make life-ordeath decisions, often in a split-second, to preserve and protect the lives of both the public and themselves (Artwohl, 2002). Video footage of certain police\u2013public encounters highlights deficits in officer performance, including errors in the decision to use lethal force. Such incidents\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 759132\ncan have tragic consequences, including serious injury or death and strained police\u2013community relations. Occasionally, such incidents can also lead to the incarceration of police officers and legal liability for law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that have not adequately prepared their officers for critical incidents (e.g., Public Prosecution Service of Canada, 2018).\nExisting research and theoretical knowledge indicate that stress can adversely impact performance, but that training and experience can moderate stress reactivity and improve performance through the appraisal process (e.g., Driskell and Salas, 1996). Thus, using a sample of Canadian police officers, the aim of the current study is to examine the level of performance that can reasonably be\u00a0expected under conditions that elicit high levels of stress, based on officers\u2019 years of experience and the level of training they have received. Critical reflection on training practices and evidence-based improvements to training may be\u00a0 called for if systemic errors or deficiencies in performance are observed in realistic scenarios. Results from this study may also provide new evidence to inform the objective reasonableness standard, which is used to assess the appropriateness of force in courts of law (Cyr, 2016; Zamoff, 2020)."

            "text": "The authority for police to use force in Canada is granted under section 25 of the Criminal Code (1985), whereby police officers who are acting on reasonable grounds are authorized to use as much force as necessary to enforce the law. In the case of R. v. Nasogaluak (McLachlin et\u00a0 al., 2010, p.\u00a0 208), the Supreme Court of Canada further established that the \u201callowable degree of force is constrained by the principles of proportionality, necessity and reasonableness.\u201d Where lethal force is concerned, the force must also be\u00a0 necessary for the purpose of selfpreservation or the protection of others from death or grievous bodily harm (Criminal Code, 1985). To assess the appropriateness of an officer\u2019s use of force, several guiding principles from international case law have become entrenched in the Canadian criminal justice system. Foremost is the U.S. Supreme Court case of Graham v. Connor (Rehnquist, 1989, p.\u00a0 387), which established the objective reasonableness standard, instructing that the \u201c\u2026\u2018reasonableness\u2019 of a particular use of force must be\u00a0 judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, and its calculus must embody an allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.\u201d In essence, given the totality of the circumstances known at the time and without hindsight bias, would other reasonably prudent officers respond in the same or similar way (Alpert and Smith, 1994; International Association of Chiefs of Police, 2020)?\nScholars have provided research evidence of neurophysiological factors (e.g., cognitive and perceptual distortions) that might frame the perceptions and actions of a reasonable officer on the scene (e.g., Klinger and Brunson, 2009). However, the use of such research in court may be\u00a0 the exception rather than the rule (DuCharme, 2002). Indeed, critics argue that the\nobjective reasonableness standard lacks an evidence-based foundation and that assessments of reasonableness focus too much on the general dangers and stressful nature of policing (Fagan and Campbell, 2020; Zamoff, 2020). To remedy this, Zamoff (2020) recently proposed that in determining the perspective of a reasonable officer, the courts should more heavily weigh the officer\u2019s experience and training, as well as the extent to which they adhered to or deviated from their training and the agency\u2019s policies. While valuable, this approach also lacks evidence of the extent that these factors are related to performance and errors or are influenced by stress (Engel and Smith, 2009)."

            "heading": "Psychophysiological Threat Response",
            "text": "When presented with a threat, whether real or perceived, the body implicitly (i.e., below conscious awareness) engages in a series of physiological processes, colloquially known as the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response (Thayer and Sternberg, 2006; LeDoux and Pine, 2016). This evolutionary adaptive response promotes survival by immediately preparing the body\u2019s physiological and cognitive capacities to meet the demands of the situation, while suppressing unnecessary functions, such as reproduction and digestion (Kemeny, 2003; Artwohl, 2008; Anderson et\u00a0al., 2019). During the fight-or-flight response, the sympatho-adrenal response is triggered, which leads to a wide-spread release of catecholamines and hormones to power the survival response (McEwen, 1998; Lovallo, 2016). Specifically, the hypothalamic\u2013 pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis is activated, which results in the rapid release of epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and cortisol (De Kloet et\u00a0al., 1998; Lovallo, 2016). Cortisol increases blood sugar and prepares the body for energy expenditure by stimulating glucose production and mobilizing fatty acids (Lovallo, 2016; Tsigos et\u00a0al., 2020). Concurrently, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is engaged, stimulating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and suppressing the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which is associated with modifying the sympathetic response when necessary (e.g., focused attention) and performing \u201crest and digest\u201d (i.e., recovery and repair) functions (Berntson and Cacioppo, 2004; Fridman et\u00a0 al., 2019). When the SNS is activated, stress hormones such as norepinephrine and epinephrine are released (Lovallo, 2016).\nThe cascade of these catecholamines, hormones, and glucose in the bloodstream from the stress system response stimulates increased heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and respiration (Tsigos and Chrousos, 2002; Chrousos, 2009). The rapid rise in energy, oxygenation, and blood flow is directed in greatest concentration to the heart, brain, and large muscles, while they are inhibited to other areas not required to respond to a threat, such as the digestive system (Tsigos and Chrousos, 2002). Therefore, activation of this sympatho-adrenal stress response improves chances of survival in the short term, by increasing resistance, strength, and focused attention (Tsigos and Chrousos, 2002; Artwohl, 2008; Fenici et\u00a0 al., 2011).\nWhile fight-or-flight is an automatic behavioral and physiological response that is engaged without the need for higher-order cognitive processing, it can be\u00a0 sustained and moderated through psychological processes, such as threat\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 759132\nappraisal, fear, and anxiety (Thayer and Sternberg, 2006; LeDoux and Pine, 2016; Chan and Andersen, 2020). The degree of SNS arousal depends primarily on the type of threat encountered and one\u2019s perception of how severe it is (Kalisch et\u00a0 al., 2015; LeDoux and Pine, 2016). For example, when the threat of harm during an encounter with a subject is perceived by the officer as outweighing their ability to cope with the situation (e.g., based on experience and training), then the subject may continue to be\u00a0 appraised as a threat, maintaining the intensity of the emotional and physiological response (Folkman et\u00a0 al., 1986; Driskell and Salas, 1996; Anshel et\u00a0 al., 1997). While there is significant evidence that the body implicitly responds to a threat, what is less clear is the extent to which this response varies as a function of experience and training, as well as the impact it has on various aspects of performance.\nThe Impact of Stress on Police Performance Studies demonstrate that the impact of SNS arousal on performance is complex. The type of threat stimulus encountered, and the strength of the resulting threat response can improve or impair perceptual, cognitive, and motor performance depending on context (Arble et\u00a0 al., 2019; Bertilsson et\u00a0 al., 2019). Adaptive SNS arousal, which meets the demands of the situation, can be\u00a0 beneficial to performance (Yerkes and Dodson, 1908), such as shooting accuracy (e.g., Vickers and Williams, 2007), and threat-related decision-making (e.g., Akinola and Mendes, 2012). However, maladaptive stress arousal (i.e., too much or too little) is considered one of the main causes of human performance failure (Vine et\u00a0 al., 2016) and can result in degradation of task accuracy and increased task errors (Driskell and Salas, 1996; Nieuwenhuys et\u00a0 al., 2012). Growing evidence also suggests that performance deficits are related to both maladaptive SNS arousal and the suppression of the stress modulating parasympathetic influence (Saus et\u00a0al., 2006; Andersen et\u00a0 al., 2018; Spangler et\u00a0 al., 2018). For example, impairments to response inhibition, resulting in more lethal force errors, can occur when the PNS is suppressed (Spangler et\u00a0 al., 2018).\nGenerally, stress-induced deficits primarily affect cognitive functions, such as perception, attention, and decision-making (Driskell and Salas, 1996; Di Nota et\u00a0al., 2020). However, motor performance, in particular fine motor skills, is also affected (Staal, 2004; Nieuwenhuys and Oudejans, 2011a; Anderson et\u00a0al., 2019). Since manipulating stressful real-world encounters for research purposes is unethical (Giessing et\u00a0al., 2019), results from realistic scenario-based experiments form much of the existing knowledge about the impact of acute stress on performance among police officers. To date, this literature has revealed that stress inducing scenarios result in impairments to various aspects of police performance including shooting accuracy (Nieuwenhuys and Oudejans, 2010; Taverniers and De Boeck, 2014; Landman et\u00a0al., 2016a), quality of skill execution (Renden et\u00a0al., 2014; Nieuwenhuys et\u00a0al., 2016), proportionality of force applied (Nieuwenhuys et\u00a0al., 2012; Renden et\u00a0al., 2017), and memory (Hope et\u00a0 al., 2016). The stress response also appears to have differential effects, whereby rehearsed and\nautomated skills are influenced to a lesser degree (Vickers and Lewinski, 2012; Renden et\u00a0 al., 2017; Arble et\u00a0 al., 2019). These findings from experimental research with simulations are extremely important to draw conclusions about what might reasonably happen to performance in real-world stressful encounters (Giessing et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nWhile few real-world studies exist, examinations of officerinvolved shootings (OIS) have also uncovered stress-induced performance issues. For example, average hit rates ranging from 14 to 38% have been observed in OIS (Morrison and Vila, 1998; Morrison and Garner, 2011; Donner and Popovich, 2018), which is in stark contrast to the almost 90% hit rate reported in rangebased annual firearms qualifications (Anderson and Plecas, 2000; Brown et\u00a0 al., 2021). In OIS incidents, officers have also reported experiencing perceptual distortions, impaired cognitive function, and reduced motor dexterity (e.g., Honig and Sultan, 2004; Artwohl, 2008; Klinger and Brunson, 2009). For example, Artwohl (2008) surveyed 157 police officers within a few weeks of being involved in an OIS. Findings demonstrated that most officers experienced perceptual narrowing, including diminished sound (84%) and tunnel vision (79%), and that the majority of officers (74%) responded on automatic pilot (i.e., with little or no conscious thought). Other studies have reported similar findings (e.g., Honig and Sultan, 2004; Klinger and Brunson, 2009).\nAttentional control theory adds additional explanatory power to understanding performance impairments (Eysenck et\u00a0 al., 2007). This theory suggests that when exposed to a threatening stimulus, attention is drawn (or distracted) away from task relevant processes (e.g., decision-making) to the threat-related stimuli via psychological and neurophysiological responses (Eysenck et\u00a0 al., 2007; Nieuwenhuys and Oudejans, 2017; Di Nota and Huhta, 2019). Since attentional capacity is limited, it is difficult to attend to two things at the same time (Vickers, 2007). Therefore, when attention is focused on the threat, cognitive overload is more likely to occur, resulting in less attention available for mental and perceptual-motor processing (Driskell and Johnston, 1998; Eysenck et\u00a0al., 2007; Hope, 2016).\nThese attentional, perceptual, and stress reactivity-related deficits mean that when presented with a threat, officers may be\u00a0 more prone to compromised performance, decision-making errors, and perceptual challenges (e.g., missing relevant cues, such as a subject pulling out a cellphone, not a gun; Easterbrook, 1959; Driskell and Salas, 1996; Vickers, 2007). Overall, the effects of stress on performance may be\u00a0particularly detrimental during a critical incident, when officers are expected to demonstrate sound judgment and proficient performance. However, research in this area is limited, as studies tend to examine only narrow aspects of performance (e.g., shooting accuracy), use subjective measures of stress (e.g., self-report), or lack robust methods and measures for assessing performance."

Theoretically, training and experience improve one\u2019s ability to cope with a threat, subsequently affecting the appraisal process, which sustains and moderates the fight-or-flight physiology (Driskell and Salas, 1996; Anshel et\u00a0 al., 1997; Kelley et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nResearch provides mixed evidence for this theory (Rimmele et\u00a0 al., 2007; Johnson et\u00a0 al., 2014; Landman et\u00a0 al., 2016b). For example, during UoF simulation studies, officers on specialized and tactical teams displayed lower HR during a high-pressure scenario as compared to general duty officers (Landman et\u00a0 al., 2016b; James et\u00a0 al., 2020). In contrast, when Baldwin et\u00a0 al. (2019) examined officers\u2019 level of operational skills training and years of experience, neither significantly modulated stress reactivity during general duty calls for service. Instead, stress reactivity was primarily associated with situational risk factors, such as the priority of the call and whether weapons were reported, or force was used. While the evidence is limited and mixed, greater levels of on-the-job experience and police training should, theoretically, improve coping and resilience to stressors, that is the very reason why training exists."

            "heading": "Impact of Training and Experience on Performance Under Stress",
            "text": "Research demonstrates that a wide range of training techniques can improve performance, even under stressful conditions. For\nexample, there are many training strategies that can enhance the acquisition, retention, and application of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), such as the use of spaced practice and providing appropriate feedback (Jenkins et\u00a0 al., 2021; Di Nota et\u00a0 al., 2021a; Bennell et\u00a0 al., 2021b). In addition, meta-analyses and systematic reviews across many domains (e.g., sport, military, medicine, policing) consistently identify the performance benefits produced by training under pressure or threat that replicates the operational environment (Kent et\u00a0 al., 2018; Gr\u00f6pel and Mesagno, 2019; Low et\u00a0 al., 2021). As a result, contemporary operational police skills training now often includes scenariobased training (SBT) that gradually exposes officers to stressinducing simulated encounters in an attempt to develop stressresilient skills and performance (Reaves, 2016). Meta-analyses provide empirical support for this training approach as a way of improving performance (Saunders et\u00a0 al., 1996; Low et\u00a0 al., 2021). Accordingly, we\u00a0 expect that officers with higher levels of operational skills training will perform better than those with less training, as they will have had greater opportunity to acquire and practice their KSAs in SBT, making the KSAs more adaptive and stress resilient.\nIn addition to training, operational experience may also be\u00a0 important to performance and decision-making under stress. For example, through the acquisition and automation of schemas, which are forms of tacit knowledge gained on-the-job or during training, experienced individuals can discern subtleties in their environment that may be\u00a0 imperceptible to novices (Kavanagh, 2006; Kahneman and Klein, 2009; Klein, 2015). Using this tacit knowledge, the recognition-primed decision-making (RPDM) model suggests that under dynamic and complex circumstances, experienced decision-makers can quickly assess situations and draw on their schemas to evaluate options and determine the first workable solution through satisficing (Klein, 1997, 1999; Ward et\u00a0 al., 2011). RPDM is resilient to stress and more adaptable to complex and dynamic situations (Klein, 2015). Accordingly, studies have found that greater levels of policing experience are related to things like flexible rather than serial decision-making (Boulton and Cole, 2016), anticipation and cue recognition (Vickers and Lewinski, 2012; Renden et\u00a0al., 2015; Suss and Ward, 2018), and reduced lethal force errors (Vickers and Lewinski, 2012; Landman et\u00a0 al., 2016b). However, many of these studies dichotomize experience into expert (e.g., tactical officers) and novice (e.g., cadets) categories, which may not account for the broad spectrum of training that officers receive, nor do they disentangle the distinct effects of on-the-job experience compared to training."

As this was not a diagnostic clinical study, we\u00a0 did not perform medical or psychiatric examinations of participants, however, we\u00a0did examine self-reported cardiovascular disease (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and being on medication that affects HR (n\u00a0=\u00a010) in relation to the data. Several cardiovascular measures did significantly differ for the 10 participants who reported being on medication that affects HR, although they did not remain significant once Bonferroni corrected (\u03b1\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.05/6\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.008). Out of an abundance of caution, all analysis involving stress reactivity was conducted with and without participants who reported being on medication that affects HR. An examination of the results did not demonstrate a difference in level of significance or effect size. Thus, all participants were retained in the study.\nthese devices continuously record HR and R-R intervals (i.e., beat-to-beat intervals), with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz for HRV analysis.

The scenario occurred in a building that had been designed to appear as an apartment complex in a rural setting. All participants were dispatched to a second-floor apartment for a call from a female complainant indicating\n2 To reduce the likelihood of lost or corrupted data, participants were also equipped with a \u00a9FirstBeat Bodyguard 2 Heart Rate Monitor (Firstbeat Technologies Ltd., Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland), which has also been validated against ECGs (Parak and Korhonen, 2013; Bogd\u00e1ny et\u00a0 al., 2016; Hinde et\u00a0 al., 2021). Data from the FirstBeat Bodyguard 2 were used to supplement HR and HRV data for 9% (n\u00a0 =\u00a0 11) of participants. 3 StressVest\u00ae does not require the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) that is typically required when training with non-lethal training ammunition (aside from range certified eye protection). This allows participants to observe facial expressions, and does not restrict peripheral vision, nor does it impede communication, hearing, or movement. SecuriBlanks\u00ae are used to maintain the fidelity of the firearm (i.e., recoil and percussion). The StressVest\u00ae can be\u00a0 concealed under clothing, which avoids priming the participant (i.e., actor wearing bulky PPE) and improves decision-making by safely and flexibly enabling more actors to participate in the scenario.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 759132\nthat a male subject had been drinking heavily and was in breach of his probation conditions. At that point, the facilitator said, \u201cscenario on\u201d and participants had the opportunity to ask dispatch for additional information, if they chose to do so.\nUpon arriving \u201con scene\u201d and knocking on the door of the residence, the participant was greeted by a bystander, who indicated that the subject had committed an assault. The bystander remained in the scenario room and demanded the participant remove the subject, who was seated at the dining room table at the other end of the room. A partially obscured knife was on the table and the subject eventually drew it and put it to his throat, threatening to die by suicide. After some time passed, regardless of how much the officer attempted to verbally de-escalate or intervene, the subject ultimately complied and threw the knife on the ground towards the participant.\nThe scenario was allowed to naturally unfold a little longer until the subject spontaneously pulled a firearm, stood up, and started to shoot at the participant. This resulted in a lethal force response from the participant. Once shot at by the participant, the subject feigned a gunshot wound to the chest while the bystander contemporaneously produced and pointed a cellphone, verbally indicating that they were video recording the situation. Participants were then provided the opportunity to prioritize and perform whatever actions they deemed necessary (e.g., request resources, secure weapons, physically restrain subject and/or bystander, search subject, administer first aid). The scenario was allowed to come to a natural conclusion and was ended by the facilitator when the participant failed to demonstrate any new actions or strategies.\nFor the purpose of analyzing cardiovascular stress reactivity, the scenario (M = 9:25 min; SD = 2:32) was broken down temporally into five phases: (1) dispatch phase \u2013 from beginning of the simulated dispatch call to the facilitator saying \u201cscenario on\u201d (M = 1:10 min; SD = 0:53), (2) approach phase \u2013 from the facilitator saying \u201cscenario on\u201d to the bystander opening the apartment door (M = 0:46 min; SD = 0:26), (3) encounter phase \u2013 from the bystander opening the apartment door to the participant recognizing the knife on the table and/or the subject grabbing the knife on the table (M = 1:44 min; SD = 1:22), (4) critical phase \u2013 from the participant recognizing the knife on the table and/or the subject grabbing the knife on the table to the participant making physical contact with the subject (e.g., arrest; M = 3:08 min; SD = 1:40), and (5) scene management and aftercare (SM&A) phase \u2013 from the participant making physical contact with the subject to the facilitator saying \u201cscenario over\u201d (M = 2:38 min; SD = 1:04)."

A paired-samples t test was conducted to compare HRrest at the lowest 1 min while completing paperwork pre-scenario to HR while the officer was sleeping. As expected, HRrest (M = 77.11, SD = 10.76) was significantly higher than HR while the officer was sleeping [M = 55.80, SD = 6.53, t(28) = 13.665, p < 0.001, d = 2.54]. HRrest for the full sample was 75.17 bpm (SD = 11.13; see Table\u00a03), which is in line with the resting rate found for officers (pre-scenario) in similar studies (Andersen et\u00a0al., 2018), although it is 10\u201315 bpm higher than on-duty HRrest (Anderson and Plecas, 2000; Baldwin et\u00a0 al., 2019). The slight elevation may be\u00a0 attributed to factors such as anticipatory stress while waiting for the scenario or the officer\u2019s body positioning during the recording (e.g., sitting upright in a chair; Miles-Chan et\u00a0 al., 2013).\nTable\u00a0 3 presents cardiovascular stress reactivity data for officers across the scenario. In support of the first hypothesis, the results indicate that participants experienced elevated stress reactivity during the scenario. HRmean_scenario was 129 bpm (SD = 18.11). Elevated SNS Indexscenario (M = 7.8, SD = 3.39) and decreased PNS Indexscenario (M = \u22123.39, SD = 0.69) were also observed throughout the scenario. Average participant HRmax_critical was 149.81 (SD = 18.03), consistent with the HR reported during real world UoF encounters (Baldwin et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nFurther supporting the first hypothesis, a repeated measures analysis (n = 117) demonstrated significant differences from at-rest HR and HR across the phases of the scenario [F(3.251, 377.126) = 1091.954, p < 0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.90]. After a Bonferroni post hoc correction (\u03b1 = 0.05/5 = 0.01) was applied, it revealed that HRmax_critical (M = 150.12, SE = 1.67) was significantly higher than HRrest (M = 74.89, SE = 1.02, p < 0.001, d = 4.64), as well as HRmax_dispatch (M = 115.99, SE = 1.57, p < 0.001, d = 2.41), HRmax_approach (M = 139.87, SE = 1.51, p < 0.001, d = 0.96), HRmax_encounter (M = 142.41, SE = 1.67, p < 0.001, d = 0.80), and HRmax_SM&A (M = 143.52, SE = 1.71, p < 0.001, d = 0.59). See Figure\u00a0 1 for a line chart of HR during sleep, while at rest, and during the phases of the scenario.\nSimilarly, there was a statistically significant difference in SNS and PNS index values (n = 111) while at rest and across the phases of the scenario, \u03c72(5) = 316.86, p < 0.001 and \u03c72(5) = 370.77, p < 0.001, respectively. A post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests was conducted with a Bonferroni\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 759132\ncorrection (\u03b1 = 0.05/5 = 0.01).

However, there were no statistically significant differences between SNS Indexcritical and SNS Indexapproach, SNS Indexencounter, or SNS IndexSM&A (p > 0.01, r = \u00b10.04\u20130.09). There were small to large significant decreases in PNS Indexcritical compared to PNS Indexrest (z = \u22129.347, p < 0.001, r = \u22120.61), PNS Indexdispatch (z = \u22129.199, p < 0.001, r = \u22120.61), PNS Indexapproach (z = \u22129.199, p < 0.001, r = \u22120.27), and PNS IndexSM&A (z = \u22122.855, p = 0.004, r = \u22120.19). However, once Bonferroni-corrected, there was a small nonsignificant difference between PNS Indexcritical and PNS Indexencounter (z = \u22122.334, p = 0.02, r = \u22120.15). Overall, these results provide support for our first hypothesis. See\nFigure\u00a0 2 for a line chart of SNS and PNS index values during sleep, while at rest, and during the phases of the scenario.\nTo further assess the first hypothesis, we\u00a0examined perceptual and cognitive distortions experienced by participants. The majority of participants reported experiencing the sensation of being on automatic pilot (90.9%), tunnel vision (87.6%), heightened visual clarity (82.6%), and diminished sound (70.2%) during the scenario (see Table\u00a04). Overall, the mean perceptual and cognitive distortion score for participants was 33.6% (SD = 15.9), indicating a notable presence of distortions. These results also provide support for our first hypothesis. Perceptual and cognitive distortion scores were not significantly associated with cardiovascular stress reactivity (i.e., HR, SNS, and PNS index values) during the overall scenario and during the critical phase of the scenario (p > 0.05)."

Therefore, participants with higher levels of operational skills training displayed measurably better performance. See Figure\u00a04 and Supplementary Material I (https://osf.io/zn6mr/) for performance scores across level of training. Years of police service was not significantly associated with any performance metrics (rs < 0.05, p > 0.05).\nTo examine the unique effects of training, experience, and stress reactivity on performance, multiple regression analysis was conducted. Due to high collinearity between cardiovascular measures (rs > \u00b10.80), and the nonsignificant correlations between performance and both HR and the PNS Index, only SNS Indexcritical was retained in the model. In all four models (see Table\u00a0 6), level of training had a significant effect on performance (p < 0.001), whereby for every increase in level of training (eight levels), there would be\u00a0approximately a three unit (\u0392 = 2.87\u20133.36) increase in each of the performance metrics (%). Conversely, for every increase in years of police service, performance metrics (%) decreased by approximately 0.39 (\u0392 = 0.28\u20130.50), though this effect did not reach significance for either the DFJDM, TSI, and CIT (p = 0.093), or the agency performance metrics (p = 0.054).

Self-reported perceptual and cognitive distortions and large increases in HR were also observed, commensurate with those reported in naturalistic UoF encounters (e.g., Anderson et\u00a0 al., 2002; Artwohl, 2008; Andersen et\u00a0 al., 2016). For example, officers\u2019 cardiovascular stress\nreactivity during the critical phase of our scenario reached an average of 150 bpm (75 bpm higher than their pre-scenario resting rate). In comparison, Baldwin et\u00a0al. (2019) reported stress reactivity in the range of 146 bpm when officers drew their firearm for the purpose of arresting a subject under threatening naturalistic conditions. Therefore, the HR produced during our scenario approximates with stress reactions to real world police encounters.\nOver 70% of our participants also reported experiencing tunnel vision, heightened visual clarity, and diminished sound. These results closely correspond with the perceptual and cognitive distortions reported by others (Honig and Sultan, 2004; Artwohl, 2008; Klinger and Brunson, 2009). The high prevalence of perceptual distortions observed in this study also aligns with attentional control theory (Eysenck et\u00a0al., 2007), which suggests that under stress, attention is directed toward the threatening stimuli, rather than task relevant processes (e.g., decisionmaking). These indications of perceptual narrowing are further supported by research showing that the perceptual field tends to shrink under stress (Vickers, 2007; Honig and Lewinski, 2008). Additionally, the majority of participants (91%) reported that they responded on automatic pilot. This corresponds with decision-making research which demonstrates that under\nTABLE\u00a05 | Correlations between stress reactivity and performance metrics.\nPerformance scales\nOverall scenario Critical phase Perceptual and cognitive\ndistortionsHRmean SNS index PNS index HRmax SNS index PNS index\nDFJDM, TSI, and CIT 0.00 \u22120.10 0.02 0.05 \u22120.22* 0.09 0.034 Agency metric \u22120.02 \u22120.09 0.05 \u22120.03 \u22120.22* 0.12 \u22120.065 STAR scale \u22120.08 \u22120.21* 0.13 \u22120.01 \u22120.30*** 0.16 \u22120.004 Overall rating \u22120.04 \u22120.16 0.08 0.01 \u22120.29*** 0.15 \u22120.006\nPerceptual and cognitive distortions (n = 121), HR (n = 122), and HRV (n = 116).

Our cardiovascular stress reactivity measures (i.e., HR and HRV) were not associated with self-reported perceptual and cognitive distortion scores, suggesting that self-reports of these distortions may not be\u00a0 a good proxy measure for stress reactivity, at least under high levels of stress. This further underscores the importance of collecting both objective and subjective measures of the phenomenon under study (Di Nota et\u00a0 al., 2021c).\nCombined, the stress reactivity data indicate that the scenario developed for this study produced adverse physiological, attentional, and perceptual conditions. Thus, this scenario arguably provides reasonably realistic conditions under which to study and draw conclusions about what might happen to performance in highly stressful real-world police encounters. This is important, not only for assessing the efficacy of agency training, but also for informing the courts about how officers might reasonably perform when responding to a threat, given the current police training they have received. Further, the findings indicate how this performance and stress reactivity may be\u00a0influenced by an officer\u2019s level of current police training and experience."

            "text": "It is believed that training and experience can improve one\u2019s ability to cope with a threatening stimuli, subsequently affecting the threat appraisal process, which sustains and moderates the fight-or-flight physiology (Driskell and Salas, 1996; Anshel et\u00a0 al., 1997; Kelley et\u00a0 al., 2019). The current study\u2019s results provided mixed evidence for Hypothesis 2, which examined this relationship. Specifically, in contrast to what we\u00a0 expected,\nthere was no effect regarding level of training on cardiovascular stress reactivity or the extent of perceptual and cognitive distortions experienced. Current findings correspond with Baldwin et\u00a0 al. (2019) who did not find an effect of level of training on physiological arousal when officers from the same agency as the current study responded to general duty calls for service. Together, these findings may indicate that the agency\u2019s training does not include or sufficiently embed techniques that have been shown to promote adaptive coping mechanisms (e.g., mental rehearsal, reappraisal; Anshel, 2000; Colin et\u00a0 al., 2014). Another possible explanation is that the agency\u2019s SBT is not currently eliciting significant enough stress reactivity to replicate the naturalistic environment and result in improved coping, advanced schemas, and stress resilient KSAs. While we\u00a0 are not proposing that all scenarios in SBT include high levels of stress, a progressive increase in stressful scenarios, once skills have been acquired, has shown benefits for performance that generalize across novel stressors and tasks (Driskell et\u00a0 al., 2001; Di Nota et\u00a0 al., 2021a).\nResearch also indicates that the threat response is malleable, with specific types of training being shown to increase one\u2019s ability to control stress reactions (Arnetz et\u00a0al., 2009; McCraty and Atkinson, 2012; Andersen et\u00a0 al., 2018). For example, using HRV biofeedback, Andersen and Gustafsberg (2016) and Andersen et\u00a0al. (2016, 2018) taught officers to modulate autonomic arousal during threat inducing SBT by evoking parasympathetic activation. This autonomic modulation training resulted in lower maximum HR and quicker recovery from critical incident stress (i.e., the time it took to return to their average resting HR) following threat exposure (a measure of PNS activation; Thayer and Sternberg, 2006). Adopting autonomic modulation training, or embedding such techniques in already existing skills training, may better equip officers to adaptively modify their stress reactivity\nFIGURE\u00a04 | Performance metrics (%) as a function of level of training.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 14 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 759132\nduring real-world critical incidents, and ultimately improve performance under stress (Andersen et\u00a0 al., 2018; Bennell et\u00a0 al., 2021a).\nIn partial support of Hypothesis 2, we\u00a0 did find that more years of police service reduced parasympathetic withdrawal and HR in the critical phase and overall scenario, although no effect was observed for SNS arousal or perceptual and cognitive distortion scores. This provides some evidence that on-the-job experience may be\u00a0 important for parasympathetic regulation, which plays a role in forming a flexible response to environmental demands (Thayer et\u00a0 al., 2009; Roos et\u00a0 al., 2017; Andersen et\u00a0 al., 2018). It is unclear why this mixed effect with training and experience was observed, however, research has previously found that years of police experience influenced the extent to which officers believed they could cope with stressful events (Anshel et\u00a0al., 1997). Further research exploring the role of training and experience is warranted."

            "text": "Given the large positive correlations that were observed between the three performance scales used, the average of the three scales was used to create an overall performance score, which captured a more comprehensive rating of KSAs essential to police work. Under the stressful conditions produced by our scenario, average participant scores for all performance scales ranged from 50 to 66%, arguably demonstrating suboptimal performance. However, it is important to note that due to the broad scope of performance indicators used in this study, it is likely beyond the ability of any officer to perform all expected tasks on their own. For example, many officers justifiably chose to prioritize providing medical care to the subject until back-up and emergency medical services (EMS) arrived. This would have resulted in lower scores for items related to scene management, such as securing weapons and evidence, which the officer may not have assessed as a priority given the circumstances (i.e., the subject suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest).\nAdditionally, under stress, over a quarter of officers made one or more lethal force errors during the scenario, including decision-making errors (7%), mistake of fact errors (16%), or a combination of the two (4%). Since our study did not have a control (i.e., low stress) scenario for comparison, we\u00a0 cannot determine the full extent to which these performance deficits and errors were stress induced. However, our study does show that SNS arousal during the critical phase of the scenario was associated with small to moderate decreases in performance, meaning that those who had higher, more maladaptive SNS arousal during the scenario displayed poorer performance than those with lower, more adaptive SNS arousal. Additionally, while it did not reach statistical significance, small effects were observed, suggesting that parasympathetic withdrawal may also be\u00a0 associated with a deterioration in performance. This trend adds to the growing evidence that indicates performance deficits may not only be\u00a0 related to maladaptive SNS arousal, but also the suppression of the stress modulating parasympathetic influence (Saus et\u00a0 al., 2006; Andersen et\u00a0 al., 2018; Spangler et\u00a0 al., 2018).TA B LE \u00a06 | M ul tip le re gr es si on s fo r tr ai ni ng , e xp er ie nc e an d st re ss re ac tiv\nity o\nn pe\nrfo rm\nan ce\n.\nP re\nd ic\nto rs\nO ve\nra ll\np er\nfo rm\nan ce\nr at\nin g\nD FJ\nD M\n, T S\nI, an\nd C\nIT A\ng en\ncy p\ner fo\nrm an\nce m\net ri\ncs S\nTA R\ns ca\nle\nB S\nE B\n\u03b2 p\nB S\nE B\n\u03b2 p\nB S\nE B\n\u03b2 p\nB S\nE B\n\u03b2 p\nLe ve\nl o f o\npe ra\ntio na l sk ills tr ai ni\nng 3.\n04 8\n0. 54\n9 0.\n46 1\n< 0.\n00 1\n2. 91\n4 0.\n74 4\n0. 35\n3 <\n0. 00\n1 2.\n87 0\n0. 45\n7 0.\n52 0\n< 0.\n00 1\n3. 35\n9 0.\n74 2\n0. 38\n6 <\n0. 00\n1\nYe ar\ns of\np ol\nic e\nse rv\nic e\n\u2212 0.\n39 3\n0. 17\n5 \u2212\n0. 18\n2 0.\n02 6\n\u2212 0.\n40 1\n0. 23\n7 \u2212\n0. 14\n9 0.\n09 3\n\u2212 0.\n28 2\n0. 14\n5 \u2212\n0. 15\n7 0.\n05 4\n\u2212 0.\n49 6\n0. 23\n6 \u2212\n0. 17\n4 0.\n03 8\nS N\nS In\nde x c\nrit ic\nal \u2212\n0. 57\n1 0.\n25 5\n\u2212 0.\n18 8\n0. 02\n7 \u2212\n0. 50\n7 0.\n34 5\n\u2212 0.\n13 4\n0. 14\n5 \u2212\n0. 21\n9 0.\n21 2\n\u2212 0.\n08 6\n0. 30\n4 \u2212\n0. 98\n6 0.\n34 4\n\u2212 0.\n24 6\n0. 00 5 R 2 0. 30 0. 17 0. 30 0. 26\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 15 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 759132\nEven when controlling for level of training and experience, SNS arousal was still associated with performance deficits and increased odds of lethal force decision-making errors, though not mistake of fact error.

These findings and trends are consistent with realworld studies and scenario-based experiments, which demonstrate that maladaptive stress arousal can result in degradation of task accuracy, increased task errors, and deficits in motor skills and cognitive functions, such as perception, attention, and decision-making (e.g., Driskell and Salas, 1996; Johnston et\u00a0 al., 1997; Morrison and Vila, 1998). These findings provide strong evidence in support of Hypothesis 3. Conversely, HR was not found to be\u00a0 associated with performance. Thus, while HR is the most easily monitored physiological proxy of stress, we\u00a0 must caution that this is not an absolute measure of an individual\u2019s stress reactivity, nor does it unequivocally predict individual performance under stressful conditions, as HR is influenced by a variety of factors (Meyerhoff et\u00a0al., 2004; Brisinda et\u00a0al., 2015; Arble et\u00a0al., 2019). Additionally, self-reported perceptual and cognitive distortion scores were not associated with performance, which may indicate that while they may be\u00a0 maladaptive for certain aspects of performance (e.g., situational awareness), they may also\nA B\nFIGURE\u00a05 | Lethal force errors during the scenario.

Therefore, caution should be\u00a0used when inferring things about an individual\u2019s in-the-moment performance based on post-incident self-reported distortions, particularly given what we\u00a0 know about memory distortions during stress and inaccuracies in self-reports (Di Nota et\u00a0 al., 2020). Based on these findings, future studies examining the relationship between stress and performance should use robust measures of stress reactivity (e.g., HRV, antithrombin), which have shown predictive value (e.g., Taverniers and De Boeck, 2014; Arble et\u00a0 al., 2019; James et\u00a0 al., 2020)."

            "text": "In support of Hypothesis 4, there were moderate to large effects of training on all performance scales. For example, overall performance scores increased steadily from 50% for novice officers or those with basic training, to 74% for elite tactical officers. In fact, when controlling for years of police service and stress reactivity, training was the largest predictor of performance, with model estimates showing a 3% rise in performance for every increase in level of training (eight levels). This indicates that while overall performance was low, significant improvements in performance under stress can be\u00a0 achieved through greater levels of operational skills training.\nConversely, when controlling for training and stress reactivity, years of police service was negatively associated with performance, with model estimates showing that for every 5-year increase in years of service, performance decreased approximately 2%. This finding was somewhat unexpected as research shows that experience can improve performance, including decision-making and cue recognition (e.g., Renden et\u00a0 al., 2015; Boulton and Cole, 2016; Mangels et\u00a0 al., 2020). Since experience and training are inevitably related, our findings may be\u00a0 a result of using regression analysis to determine the distinct effect of on-the-job experience, while controlling for level of training. Our findings may then indicate that minimum qualifications and skills maintenance training, absent of additional or supplemental training and practice, are not sufficient to retain KSAs in the long-term (O\u2019Neill et\u00a0 al., 2019). This may be\u00a0 particularly true for certain KSAs that are rarely used in the field, such as the UoF and medical care for a gunshot wound (Baldwin et\u00a0 al., 2020; Singh, 2020). Therefore, years of police service may be\u00a0 a crude measure of experience, as it is not necessarily indicative of exposure to critical incidents (Klein, 1999).\nWhile greater levels of training improved global performance in the scenario, more advanced training, as well as higher years of police service, were both predictors of increased lethal force decision-making errors, even when controlling for stress reactivity. In contrast, with regard to the mistake of fact errors, neither training nor years of police service predicted shooting the bystander who quickly produced and pointed a cellphone after the subject was shot. These findings do not support Hypothesis 4, nor do they align with previous research that has shown a reduction of lethal force errors with greater levels\nof training and experience (Vickers and Lewinski, 2012; Landman et\u00a0 al., 2016b).\nResearch related to decision-making in naturalistic environments is helpful for understanding these unexpected results. According to this body of research, both the decisionmaking and mistake of fact lethal force errors observed in this study would be\u00a0classified as rule-based (or misdiagnosis) errors (Reason, 2000; Taylor, 2019). This type of error involves an intended behavior (e.g., discharging a firearm at a perceived threat) that results in an unintended outcome (e.g., shooting an unarmed subject) due to a misdiagnosis of the situation and application of the wrong rule or schema (Taylor, 2019). Recall from our earlier description of RPDM that individuals rely heavily on cognitive shortcuts (e.g., satisficing) to quickly assess situations, evaluate options, and determine the first workable response (Klein, 1997, 1999; Kahneman and Klein, 2009). While this type of response is resilient to stress, requires less attentional resources, and enables a quick response to a perceived threat, it does not always result in the selection of the best response (Kahneman and Klein, 2009; Ward et\u00a0 al., 2011; Klein, 2015). Thus, with regard to the mistake of fact error, given the context of just being shot at by the subject, when the officers in our study saw the bystander quickly pulling an object from his pocket and raising it, this pattern was congruent with, and likely to be\u00a0 recognized as, a threat."

            "text": "Given the sub-optimal performance observed in this study, it is recommended that LEAs and their trainers reflect on their current training and further incorporate evidence-based best practices from recent reviews (e.g., Jenkins et\u00a0 al., 2021; Di Nota et\u00a0 al., 2021a; Bennell et\u00a0 al., 2021b), in hopes of achieving better performance. Importantly, the exploratory analysis found in the supplemental material identified several behaviors that were highly associated with positive performance. These behaviors included things like assessing the situation, recognizing threat cues, competence with intervention options, de-escalation, and maintaining tactical advantage (i.e., time, distance, cover, concealment). Thus, greater integration and focus on these behaviors in training could result in positive impacts in overall performance.\nRegarding the decision-making errors observed in this study, Andersen et\u00a0 al. (2018) cautioned against use of force models (and associated training) that may reinforce if-then contingencies, such as relating a weapon or the threat of grievous bodily harm or death to the use of lethal force. While it is certainly important for public and police safety for an officer to draw their firearm in response to a weapon or lethal threat in relevant instances, if use of force models do promote if-then thinking, maladaptive heuristics may be\u00a0 relied on that are inappropriate in certain circumstances. For instance, in our study, we\u00a0observed a significant number of officers discharge their firearm at a subject who was armed with a knife but was exhibiting a threat of suicide. The odds of doing so also increased with more training and experience. Therefore, it is possible that the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 17 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 759132\ncurrent UoF model and related training, are inadvertently creating and reinforcing inappropriate mental shortcuts that may be\u00a0used under dynamic and highly stressful situations. Thus, LEAs should examine evidence-based training and models that target decisionmaking (e.g., Vickers, 2007; Klein and Borders, 2016; Engel et\u00a0 al., 2020) and problem-solving abilities (e.g., Rajakaruna et\u00a0 al., 2017; Belur et\u00a0 al., 2019; Blumberg et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nLastly, agencies need to ensure adequate amounts and frequency of training are provided to achieve mastery and retention of evidence-based KSAs (e.g., O\u2019Neill et\u00a0 al., 2019; Bennell et\u00a0 al., 2021b; Di Nota et\u00a0 al., 2021b), as rehearsed and automated skills are influenced to a lesser degree by stress (Vickers and Lewinski, 2012; Renden et\u00a0al., 2017; Arble et\u00a0al., 2019). Training should also include appropriate amounts of representative practice that is commensurate with real-world settings, to allow officers the opportunity to practice and integrate a wide-range of KSAs under stressful conditions (e.g., tactics, de-escalation, decisionmaking, perceptual-motor movement, medical aftercare). Several studies have demonstrated that training under stress can improve police performance, enhance officer safety, and reduce use of force errors (e.g., Nieuwenhuys and Oudejans, 2011b; Taverniers and De Boeck, 2014; Andersen et\u00a0 al., 2018)."

            "heading": "Implications for the Objective Reasonableness Standard",
            "text": "Critics have argued that the objective reasonableness standard lacks an evidence-based foundation and focuses too much on the general dangers and stressful nature of policing (Fagan and Campbell, 2020; Zamoff, 2020). As the courts\u2019 interpretation of what is reasonable is not static, research of the type reported here can advance the standard by \u201cinjecting a consistent dose of evidentiary rigor\u201d (Zamoff, 2020, p.\u00a0 585).\nPerformance under high levels of stress in this study was sub-optimal, with overall performance scores of 59% and over a quarter of officers making one or more lethal force errors during the scenario. While proper training may significantly improve performance, threat-induced performance deficits and lethal force errors in police officers are persistent, even with training (Nieuwenhuys et\u00a0 al., 2015). For example, even the sample of highly trained tactical officers in this study had performance scores of 74, and 14% made lethal force errors under stressful conditions, despite a quarter of their shift time being devoted to training (Cyr et\u00a0 al., 2020). These findings suggest that a reasonable officer, regardless of the amount of training and experience they have received, will likely not perform flawlessly under the unpredictable, novel, and potentially uncontrollable circumstances of a critical incident.\nWhile this information is necessary to inform judgments concerning the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s actions, the purpose of this research is not to excuse sub-optimal performance or errors by the police. Instead, the aim is to paint a realistic picture of human performance under stress, identify the extent to which current police training and experience can improve performance, and promote police accountability. Accordingly, the results suggest that unless\nthere is a significant investment in more frequent and evidencebased training, police officers are likely not sufficiently prepared to deliver optimal performance in critical incidents, which can impact both public and police safety. Thus, absent of evidence of bias, malice, or gross incompetence on the part of an officer, responsibility for poor performance or lethal force errors lies with LEAs and governments who are responsible for setting evidence-based training standards and ensuring that they can be\u00a0met. Currently, many police services identify significant barriers to providing training, such as limited funding, resources, and facilities (Rojek et\u00a0 al., 2020). At this critical juncture in time, when trust and confidence in policing are being significantly tested (e.g., Leger, 2021), a concerted effort is required to address these challenges."

            "heading": "Study Limitations",
            "text": "While we\u00a0are optimistic that our research findings can improve police training and inform the courts understanding of reasonable performance under stress, we\u00a0 caution readers to interpret and use the findings with consideration to various study limitations presented.\nWhile the results of this study paint a stark picture of performance under stress, which may cause some alarm, these results must be\u00a0considered within the context of what is actually occurring in the agency\u2019s operational environment. For example, with over 16,000 officers policing approximately 8 million people, the agency\u2019s OIS are relatively rare, with an average of 21 per year; accounting for 0.0008% of their police occurrences or one OIS in approximately 130,000 occurrences. These incidents also make up less than 1% of the number of times officers from the participating agency displayed or pointed their firearm at a subject, demonstrating that the vast majority of these high-risk situations are resolved without lethal force. Thus, while we\u00a0 can draw conclusions about what might happen to performance in highly stressful real-world police encounters, we\u00a0 must caution that it does not necessarily mean that it is occurring in naturalistic settings.\nThis study also involved only a single scenario, which was specifically designed to be\u00a0 complex and dynamic, and left the officer to respond on their own without backup. Such scenarios are known to elicit significant cognitive load (Mugford et\u00a0 al., 2013; Hope, 2016), which could inflate the sort of performance deficits we\u00a0observed. While the scenario was designed to be\u00a0 as realistic as possible to cause high levels of stress in participants, it is also important to note that even a realistic scenario does not completely mirror the stress induced by a critical incident. For instance, in a training or research scenario, officers are aware they will not be\u00a0 seriously injured or killed, nor be\u00a0 subjected to post-OIS stressors (e.g., external civilian oversight investigations, risk of criminal liability, job loss). Therefore, we\u00a0 caution that no scenario-based study can truly replicate the naturalistic police environment or officer performance within it.\nThe current assessment of performance was also based on a single snapshot in time with one sample of officers\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 18 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 759132\nfrom a specific agency. Consequently, the results may not generalize to other scenarios, other officers, or other agencies. On average, officers from the participating agency receive in-service training that aligns with other LEAs (i.e., 40 h annually; Reaves, 2010), their pre-service and supervised field training are significantly longer (i.e., 6 months each). Additionally, the agency is known to provide high quality training according to industry standards, as exemplified by its dedicated teams of experienced and expert learning designers (civilian and police), standardized training, centralized oversight of instructor training, and collaboration with academics to embed best training practices. Therefore, the results of this study may be\u00a0 reflective of performance with above-average quality training.\nLastly, measurements of HRV can be\u00a0influenced by respiration and physical activity, which may obscure linkages between psychological and physiological processes (Laborde et\u00a0al., 2017). However, to increase confidence in the study findings, the current study used measures which are relatively free of respiratory influences, reported baseline measures, used a scenario room with confined space to restrict movement, and followed recently proposed HRV reporting guidelines (Quintana et\u00a0 al., 2016; Laborde et\u00a0 al., 2017). As cardiovascular stress reactivity is only one aspect of the stress response system, future research should include as much biological sampling (e.g., HPA activity, blood markers) as is logistically and ethically possible (Supplementary Material L (https://osf.io/egkf6/))."

The findings provide LEAs the opportunity to critically reflect on current training practices and offers a roadmap for making evidence-based improvements to training. The results also provide important evidence which may inform the reasonableness standard used in courts of law and paint a more realistic picture of police performance under stress given the current training available to officers. However, perhaps most importantly, we\u00a0 identify a need for a concerted effort to increase police training standards and ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place to achieve them. In this way, we\u00a0 should be\u00a0 able to enhance police performance in stressful police\u2013citizen encounters and significantly reduce critical lethal force errors."
