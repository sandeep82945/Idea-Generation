One of their distinctive features is the presence of a finite band gap in the bulk and gapless, topologically protected edge states that are spin-momentum locked. These materials are characterized by a Z2 topological order where, in the 2D case, a single topological invariant can be even or odd for a trivial or a topological material, respectively. Thanks to their interesting properties, such as the realization of dissipationless spin currents, spin pumping and spin filtering, they are of great interest in the field of electronics, spintronics and quantum computing. In this work we perform an high-throughput screening of quantum spin Hall insulators starting from a set of 783 two-dimensional exfoliable materials, recently identified from a systematic screening of the ICSD, COD, and MPDS databases. We find a new Z2 topological insulator (HgNS) as well as 3 already known ones and 7 direct gap metals that have the potential of becoming quantum spin Hall insulators under a reasonably weak external perturbation.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTopological states of matter1 have been one of the main subject of studies for condensed matter physicists in the past decade. One of the driving aspects lies in the robustness of many properties of topological materials, whose existence can be directly related to a specific set of topological invariants2\u20134. In the case of insulators, the ground state of a topologically trivial material can be connected to the one of an atomic insulator or vacuum by a smooth adiabatic deformation of its Hamiltonian, while for a topologically non-trivial material, this cannot happen without closing a gap in its band structure. Among the possible classifications of topological insulators, quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) represent a class of materials protected by time-reversal (TR) symmetry where the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE)5 can be realized. This is made possible by the presence of a finite bulk gap and spin-polarized gapless helical hedge states6 that can sustain dissipationless spin currents1 thanks to the absence of backscattering forbidden by TR. Other interesting properties arise from spin-momentum locking7, which allows for the possibility to realize spin filtering8, injection, detection9 and pumping3, all of which make QSHIs of great interest for the realization of spintronic devices. It has also been shown that magnetic confinement can be used in order to realize qubits on the surface of a QSHI10, making these materials promising for applications in quantum computing. The need for finding new topological materials, and in particular QSHIs, is further accentuated by the recent surge in high-throughput studies11\u201317, especially when related to easily exfoliable materials18\u201321.\nQSHIs can be identified through a Z2 invariant which can be either even (0) or odd (1), as first proposed by\nKane and Mele, that showed that a Dirac cone, with a gap opened by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lead to a topologically non-trivial order5,22. This concept has later been extended as, in general, a QSHI can be obtained whenever a band inversion takes place, as in the paradigmatic cases of, e.g., HgTe quantum dots23,24 and Bi1\u2212xSbx\n25. A non-trivial Z2 invariant can emerge naturally due to the material intrinsic band structure, or can be induced by a perturbation, such as the application of strain or electric fields or the interaction with a substrate26\u201330. Hence, a trivial insulator can be driven into a topological insulator and vice-versa, leaving open the possibility to realize a topological transistor31,32. While for two-dimensional (2D) materials a single invariant is sufficient in order to describe their topology with respect to the QSHE, it has been shown that for three-dimensional (3D) materials a set of 4 invariants is required, leading to the possibility of weak or strong Z2 topological insulators33. It has also been shown that the topology of a system can often be related to its symmetries34\u201338. For example, in the case of QSHIs with inversion symmetry, the Z2 topological invariant can be computed easily by calculating the eigenvalues of the parity operator at the time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) points of the Brillouin zone (BZ)25.\nIn this work we perform a complementary screening to that of Marrazzo et al.12, by using a set of newly discovered 2D materials from Ref 39, in which 1252 new monolayers, exfoliable from their layered (typically vander-Waals bonded) parents, have been added to the initial 2D portfolio18 used in Ref 12. We set out with this, the aim of identifying all the 2D Z2 topological insulators present in this set, analyzing all the materials with less than 40 atoms per unit cell, with the exception of lanthanides due to their typically complex, correlated electronic structure40. We also identify direct gap metals\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n02 58\n3v 3\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n1 5\nSe p\n20 23\n2 (DGMs) which can serve as Z2 candidates, by calculating the invariant for materials where the valence and conduction band manifolds are separated by a direct gap (DG), but where the indirect gap (IG) is negative."

We perform fully relativistic calculations with SOC, using the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) pseudopotentials43 from the ONCVPSP (v0.4) set44 contained in the PseudoDojo library45. For every calculations we use a kinetic cutoff, high enough to ensure that the uncertainty on the energy eigenvalues is lower than 5 meV. In order to properly account for low-gap and metallic systems, a Fermi-Dirac smearing of 5 meV is used. For the initial self consistent calculations we use a k-point mesh of density 0.2 A\u030a\u22121, which is refined to 0.1 A\u030a\u22121 for QSHI candidates. All the calculations have been performed assuming a non-magnetic ground state, magnetism has been later checked for the selected candidates following the same approach used in Ref.18.\nThe topological invariant are computed either from an analysis of the band structures at the TRIM points or using the Z2Pack package46, for which we set the maximum number of k-points per line to 200, and the lowest acceptable distance between lines to 10\u22127. The threshold on the hybrid Wannier charge centers (HWCC)47 position variation per step on a line (pos tol) is set to 0.01, the threshold on the relative movement of the HWCCs position between neighboring (move tol) to 0.3 and the threshold for the distance between the middle of the largest gap in a line and the position of the neighboring HWCC (gap tol) to 0.3.\nFor the new QSHI found, we also perform a hybrid functional calculation, using HSE0648. We find that in order to obtain a properly converged Wannierization of the system, a very dense 32\u00d7 16\u00d7 1 k-point mesh with a 4\u00d7 2\u00d7 1 q-point mesh has to be used. The Wannierized wavefunctions are then used to compute the topological invariant and edge states, in order to confirm whether the system remains a topological insulator."

            "text": "The original set of material of which we explore the properties is derived from the ICSD49,50, COD51 and MPDS52 databases, by identifying 2D exfoliable materials, starting from experimentally known bulk structures using vdW DF2-C09 DFT calculations18. First we exclude all materials containing lanthanides, due to the inaccuracy of plain DFT pertaining calculations with these atoms caused by the presence of strongly correlated electrons40. For the remaining 603 materials, compared to the 1306 structures studied in Ref 12 by Marrazzo\net al, we follow two strategies for the identification of QSHIs in order to minimize the usage of computational resources. For the ones with inversion symmetry we use the formula given by Fu and Kane25\n(\u22121)\u03bd = \u220f i \u03b4i, \u03b4i = N\u220f m=1 \u03be2m(\u0393i) (1)\nwhere \u03bd is the Z2 topological invariant, \u03be2m is the eigenvalue of the parity operator calculated for a couple of TR-paired bands and \u0393i are the TRIM points, of which there are 4 for a 2D material, defined as\n\u0393i = \u2212\u0393i +G (2)\nwith G being any reciprocal lattice vector. For a 2D material, 4 TRIM points can be found at the coordinates (0, 0), (0, 0.5), (0.5, 0) and (0.5, 0.5) expressed in units of the reciprocal lattice vector. Given the formula in eq.(1), the most computationally efficient route for materials that have inversion symmetry is to calculate first the band structure at the TRIM points to determine the topological invariants. Materials with \u03bd = 0 are discarded, while for those with \u03bd = 1 we proceed with a band structure calculation along the high-symmetry lines. The result can either be a material with finite DG on the entire k-point path, or with a zero DG. The latter is discarded as a metal/semimetal without an isolated valence band manifold, while the former can either be a QSHI if the IG, defined as the difference between the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band, is positive, or a DGM if the IG is negative. The values of the DGs and IGs are further corroborated by analyzing the band structure computed on a dense uniform k-point grid with a spacing of 0.015 A\u030a\u22121. We discard materials that are DGM with an IG lower than -0.15 eV, as attempting to drive such a material to a topological phase would be hardly feasible. The same band structure on the dense uniform grid is also used to derive the density of states (DOS) for the materials studied. If inversion symmetry is not present, we follow a different route, by determining the DG and IG first through a band structure calculation and discarding the metals and semimetals without a finite DG. We then use the Z2Pack package, which tracks the positions of one-dimensional HWCCs across half of the BZ, in order to compute the topological invariant53. The package acts as an automation tool, which interfaces a DFT code (QE in our case) with Wannier9054 in order to calculate the HWCC positions on a progressively denser grid of k-points. If one of the convergence criteria of Z2Pack, with the parameters mentioned before, is not satisfied, then the material is discarded. If the results of the calculation is a non trivial topological invariant, the material is then classified as a QSHI or DGM following the same criteria mentioned for the inversion-symmetric cases, where the direct and indirect gaps are then checked again from the band structures on a dense k-point grid used also for the DOS.\n3\nFinally, for the selected candidates we asses the dynamical stability by computing the full phonon dispersion by means of density-functional perturbation theory55 and we check the non-magnetic ground state assumption comparing the energy of the non-magnetic ground state with different possible ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic configurations following the same procedure adopted in Ref. 18. A flowchart describing the entire high-throughput calculation is shown in Fig. 1. The entire process has been automated using AiiDA56,57, a workflow managing infrastructure, which enable us to keep track of the provenance at every computational step. The data produced in this work, including both the results and the entire provenance tree, has been made available on the Materials Cloud as Ref. 58."

            "text": "We start our screening from a set of 783 2D exfoliable structures taken from Ref 39, which are reduced to 603 after removing materials containing lanthanides. The set is further divided in two groups of 260/342 structures with/without inversion symmetry. For the inversion symmetric materials, we compute the eigenvalues of the parity operator \u03be2m, the calculation of which can sometimes fail due to limitations in the code to handle non-symmorphic space groups, or due to the accuracy threshold imposed for the calculation of the trace of the representation for each group of bands. 78 out of these 260 TRIM point calculation failed and were hence recalculated using Z2pack. Of the 182 successful calculations, 27 resulted in a non trivial topological invariant \u03bd = 1. We then performed a band structure calculations along the high-symmetry path59, from which we excluded 22 metallic materials and identified 1 QSHI (HfBr) and 4 direct gap metals (DGMs). On the 343+78 remaining structures (the noninversion symmetric ones and those with failed parity calculations), the band structure calculations show that 207 materials have a DG greater than 0; for them we proceed with Z2Pack calculations that identify, 3 QSHIs (ZrTe5, HgNS, HfTe5) and 3 DGMs. The summary of the data for every material is reported in Table I, while a more detailed report is given in the supplementary materials60, together with the crystal structure and band structure of the material identified and a plot of the HWCC for every Z2Pack calculation. A summary for all the materials analyzed in the present work, together with those of the previous screening by Marrazzo et al.12 (in absence of strain), is shown in Fig. 2, where the QSHIs are highlighted. In the figure, all materials with a negative IG have been put on the y = 0 axis in order to emphasize QSHIs and DGMs, especially with regard to the magnitude of the DG and IG, as these two parameters can be used to determine the range of temperatures at which a device could operate61. The interest in DGMs with a non trivial \u03bd is twofold. First it is possible that, given the limitations of DFTPBE calculations, the band gap of the material is being underestimated and, using more appropriate methods (such as many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation62), a material that was computed to be a DGM with DFT-PBE could actually result to be a QSHI. It is worth highlighting that the opposite could also be possible, where a material that is estimated to be a QSHI within DFT-PBE could end up being a trivial insulator in a GW calculation (as discussed for the case of TiNI in Ref.12). Second, a DGM could be driven into a Z2 topological state through an external perturbation that could open a gap in the material without driving a band inversion29,30. To this end, it is important to look at both the IG and DG of the material. The former is related to how strong a perturbation needs to be in order to drive the material in a semiconducting state, while the latter\n4\ngives us an idea of how likely it is that a gap could be opened, without causing band inversion, or driving the material into a metallic state. Indeed, the higher the DG of a material, the more difficult it will be to close it. For this reason, DGMs with small negative IG and large DG are prime candidates for further studies; a visual summary of the direct and indirect gap of the DGMs is shown in Fig. 3. Among the various possible perturbations that could open the gap, the most interesting ones, from the standpoint of applications in a device, would be gating/electric fields27, the interaction with a substrate63 and/or the application of strain64.\nFor all the materials found, we searched the current literature to determine which QSHIs were already known, and which one are novel to this study. We find that among the 4 QSHIs identified, 3 were already known, namely the two tellurides of hafnium/zirconium, and hafnium bromide. HfBr65,66 was already known both for being an easily exfoliable material and for its topological properties in its 2D and 3D forms. This material has a\nDG of 233 meV and an IG of 48 meV making it a good candidate for experiments and possible device realization. It should also be noted that this material belongs to a broader class of transition-metal halides MX (M=Zr, Hf X=Cl, Br) which has already been predicted to host topological properties. Furthermore, several class of similar honeycomb materials have also been predicted to host topological states such as transition metal carbides MC (M=Ti, Zr, Hf)67 and transition metal compounds MM\u2019 (M=Ti, Zr, Hf) (M\u2019=Bi, Sb)68.\nHfTe5 (ZrTe5) 69 are two pentatellurides both of which have large DGs of 300(281) meV and IGs of 171(220) meV making them both very good candidates for QSHIs applications at room temperature. Interestingly, as shown by Weng et al.69, the presence of a band inversion in these materials comes mainly from the nonsymmorphic features of their space group which, together with the presence of 2 non-equivalent Te atom chains, drives the ordering of the bands at \u0393. At the same time, the symmetries of the space group give raise to four-fold\n5\ndegenerate bands at the TRIM points, 2 with even and 2 with odd parity, such that the presence of SOC will only open a gap in a band structure that would otherwise be metallic, but will preserve the product of parity eigenvalues at the TRIM points. These pentatellurides have also been proposed for the realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, when the transition metal Hf/Zr is substituted for a rare earth metal which could induce a magnetic ordering in the material, breaking time-reversal symmetry69,70.\nHgNS is a new compound which has not been discussed in the literature for its topological properties. Its direct and indirect gaps are both of 7 meV. Such low gap, in between that of silicene (1.4 meV) and germanene (23.8 meV) precludes room temperature applications. Nevertheless, at the gap, situated along the \u0393 \u2212 Y direction, the material shows a linear band dispersion akin to that of germanene at K when SOC is taken into account. The similarity between the two systems, opens the possibility for a multitude of studies, such as the effect of an electric field on the gap and band inversion27,28 or the possibilities for opto-electronic applications in THz devices71. Given that HgNS would constitute a new QSHI, we also study it using the hybrid HSE06 functional as described in the methods. We find, as expected, that the effect of the hybrid is that of increasing the gap in the material. We can also observe from the band structure shown in the supplementary material60 that the gap opening goes against the band inversion, moving the quasi-linear crossing toward the edge of the zone, but is not strong enough to drive the material to a trivial states. Hence, we find that HgNS is still a QSHI, as corroborated by the HWCCs evolution and edge state calculations shown in the supplementary material60, even when a hybrid functional is used, and\nthe gap increases from 7 meV to 38 meV. Among the DGMs, the most promising ones are Fe2O3 and Mo2Ta2O17, with small IGs of -21 and -36 meV respectively. The small negative IGs indicate that it could be feasible to force those from being DGM to a QSHI by acting via strain, electric field or other perturbations. There is also HfCl which, like HfBr, is a transition metal halide and has been studied in Ref 65, in which the material is identified as a semi-metal for both PBE and PBESOC calculations, but as QSHI in a HSE06-SOC calculation. This reiterates that DGMs identified by DFT can or could actually be found to be QSHIs if studied with techniques, such as many body perturbation theory, that can correctly estimate the gap, or when exposed to a perturbation. When considering the QSHIs identified in this work, we obtain a relative abundance of topological insulators of 0.5%, which goes up to 1.4% if the DGMs are included as well. This result is comparable to that of the previous work of Marrazzo et al12 where an abundance of 1.1% was found for QSHIs. The difference in the values can be explained by two reasons: first, in the work from Marrazzo, strained configurations had also been considered when determining a material topology. Second, when analyzing the space group distributions of the two datasets, shown in Fig. SM1-2, we can observe that the old dataset contained more materials with monoclinic Bravais lattice, in particular with space group 11, which from the analysis seems to be the one with the most QSHIs and DGMs when compared to all other space groups."

Starting from a set of 783 materials we found 4 QSHIs (1 novel) and 7 DGMs (6 novel) that could be driven into a QSHI state by material engineering, for a relative abundance of 0.5% for QSHIs and 1.4% if DGMs are also included. Of the 4 QSHIs identified, the 3 with the largest gaps had already been explored in the literature. In particular, the two pentatellurides HfTe5 and ZrTe5 exhibit both large direct and indirect gaps which makes them promising candidates for room-temperature applications. The remaining material, namely HgNS, represents a newly identified QSHI with linear bands in proximity of its direct gap of 38 meV when computed with an hybrid HSE functional. The main feature of this material is the small gap and band linearity, akin to that of silicene or germanene. For this reason, HgNS could be a promising candidate for future electronic and photonic applications in the low energy regime. All materials identified in this work are easily exfoliable, with a binding energy lower than 20 meV/A\u030a218 and for this reason they are prime candidates for possible experimental realization through exfoliation techniques starting from their experimentally known 3D bulk form.\n6"
