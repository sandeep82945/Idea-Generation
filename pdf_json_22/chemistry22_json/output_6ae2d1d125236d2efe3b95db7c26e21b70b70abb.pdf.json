    "abstractText": "Advances in singe-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have made possible to solve the structures of numerous Family A and Family B G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in complex with G proteins and arrestins, as well as several Family C GPCRs. Determination of these structures has been facilitated by the presence of large extramembrane components (such as G protein, arrestin, or Venus flytrap domains) in these complexes that aid in particle alignment during processing of the cryo-EM data. In contrast, determination of the inactive state structure of Family A GPCRs is more challenging due to the relatively small size of the seven transmembrane domain (7TM) and to the surrounding detergent micelle that, in the absence of other features, make particle alignment impossible. Here we describe an alternative protein engineering strategy where the heterodimeric protein calcineurin is fused to a GPCR by three points .

            "text": "GPCRs have been challenging subjects for structural biology for a long time. First,\nwith the exception of bovine rhodopsin, GPCRs are not sufficiently abundant in any\nmammalian tissue and have to be expressed in heterologous systems (1, 2). Also, most\nFamily A GPCRs are dynamic flexible proteins with little exposed polar surface to facilitate\nthe formation of a crystal lattice(3, 4). Furthermore, most GPCRs are relatively unstable,\nnecessitating long-chain detergents with relatively large micelles (3-5) for efficient\npurification. Three strategies have been used to overcome these limitations: the\ndevelopment of antibodies that stabilize the GPCR and provide additional polar surfaces\n(6); thermostabilizing mutations that enable the use of short-chain detergents with smaller\nmicelles (7, 8); and protein engineering to replace the flexible N-terminus or intracellular\nloop (ICL) 3 with highly crystallizable proteins such as T4 Lysozyme and BRIL (9, 10).\nNevertheless, crystallization of Family A GPCRs still requires an element of luck and\nextensive rounds of optimization of the linkers between the receptor and the fusion\nprotein, as well as optimization of crystallization conditions. Moreover, crystallization of\nGPCRs often depends on the availability of a high affinity ligand. In contrast, structure\ndetermination by cryo-EM is less dependent on luck. If the protein is of sufficient quality,\nstability, and size, a structure will likely be obtained. In this work, we sought to develop a\nprotein engineering strategy that would enable the use of cryo-EM to determine structures\nof inactive-state Family A GPCRs that does not require the development of receptor-\nspecific antibodies or nanobodies.\nWe chose to extend the ICL3 fusion protein strategy previously developed for\ncrystallography (9) by adding an additional link through the C-terminus. We expected that\nthe incorporation of a third link between the soluble protein and the receptor would reduce\nthe flexibility between the two proteins and thereby improve its use as a fiducial marker\nfor the 7TM core. This could be accomplished with a single protein having two or more\nindependently folded domains or with two proteins that form a heterodimer (Fig. 1A). The\nproteins would have to have their N- and C-termini in positions that would be compatible\nwith the relative positions of the cytoplasmic ends of TMs 5, 6 and 7 of the GPCR.\nCalcineurin (CN), composed of CN-A and CN-B subunits (Fig. 1B), was selected as our first candidate as it has the added advantage of being a Ca2+ dependent heterodimer\n(11). As shown in Fig. 1B, CN-B interacts with the C-terminal helix of CN-A (the CN-B binding region) in the presence of four Ca2+ ions. The link between CN-A and CN-B can\nbe further stabilized by the FK binding protein (FKBP12) in the presence of the inhibitor\nFK506 (or Tacrolimus) (Fig. 1B).\nWhile the N and C-termini of CN-B are 19 \u00c5 apart in the structure of CN-\nFKBP12(12), the N-terminus is a 15 amino acid long flexible loop that could be\nconceivably shortened to accommodate the 11 \u00c5 distance between the cytoplasmic ends\nof TM5 and TM6 in the \u03b22AR (Fig. 1B). Our initial construct is shown in Fig. S1A, where CN-B (amino acids 16-170) is inserted between amino acids 230-263 of the \u03b22AR and the CN-A (amino acids 2-371) is fused to Y354 in the C-terminus of the \u03b22AR. We were able to obtain a well-behaved monomeric fusion protein (Fig. S1B-C). 2D averages show\nclear architectures for \u03b22AR, CN-A, and CN-B (Fig. S1D). 3D reconstruction finally yields a map with an overall resolution of 4.2 \u00c5, which shows a relatively rigid orientation\nbetween the 7TM of \u03b22AR and CN (Fig. S1E-G). Of note, computational docking of 3D models into the 4.2 \u00c5 map shows that the N-terminal ~15 aa of CN-A lack observable\ndensity. This region was also not resolved in the crystal structure, pointing to an\nintrinsically disordered character (Fig. S1H). We further truncated the N-terminus of CN-\nA to create a shorter construct (Fig. 1C). Although density in \u03b22AR is lost after position L341 (Fig. S1H), we kept the following residues (342-354) to better accommodate the\ndistance between L341 and the N-terminus of CN-A. Radioligand binding studies show\nthat the functional properties of the optimized construct are similar to those of wild-type\n\u03b22AR, with almost the same binding affinity for the antagonist carazolol and moderately decreased binding affinity (6 fold) for the agonist isoproterenol (Fig. 1D).\nTo further stabilize the conformation of the CN heterodimer, we used the FKBP12\nprotein to form a complex with \u03b22AR-CN (Fig. S2A). Fig. 2A shows a representative 2D class average of the complex, from which we can clearly see all the components of the\nfusion protein and the FKBP12. We finally reconstructed a 3.5 \u00c5 map from the dataset of\nthe \u03b22AR-CN-FKBP12 complex (Fig. S2B-F) that allowed us to build a model for most of the \u03b22AR, CN-A, CN-B, and FKBP12 (Fig. 2B-C and S2G). Densities for the inverseagonist carazolol and most residues in the orthosteric pocket are well resolved and the\nligand can be docked with confidence (Fig. 2C-D). We also observe clear density for the\ncompound FK506 which links FKBP12 with CN-A and CN-B (Fig. S2H). Moreover, the\ndensity for the linkers between CN-B and TM5 and TM6 are well-resolved (Fig. 2E).\nAlthough we didn\u2019t observe a continuous density between the C-terminus of the \u03b22AR and\nthe N-terminus of CN-A in the final high-resolution map, the third linker was clearly seen\nin a well-defined low-resolution map from 3D classification (Fig. S2I).\nFig.2 Cryo-EM structure determination of inverse agonist-bound \u03b22AR using a three-point fusion strategy.

As expected, the overall structures are similar, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.7 \u00c5 (Fig. 2F). The\ncarazolol binding pockets for the two structures are also highly similar, with a RMSD of\n0.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 2G). The largest difference between the two structures corresponds to\nintracellular loop 2 (ICL2), which is folded as a helix in the \u03b22AR-CN cryo-EM structure while it is an unstructured loop in the \u03b22AR-T4L crystal structure (Fig. 2F and 2H). Existing structures of \u03b22AR show that ICL2 is a helix in the active state (Fig. 2H) and that the transition from a loop to a helix conformation may be an important step for receptor\nactivation (13, 14). Our result suggests that the helical conformation of ICL2 can also exist\nin the inactive state of \u03b22AR, possibly in equilibrium with an unstructured loop conformation. The complete absence of the helical conformation of ICL2 in crystal\nstructures of the inactive \u03b22AR might be due to crystal lattice contacts with T4L (Fig. S3). Similarly, the slight difference in the conformation of ECL3 may also result from crystal\npacking (Fig. S3). In addition, we also observed different conformations at the cytoplasmic\nend of TM6, which is likely caused by the different fusion proteins linked to this helix (Fig.\n2F).\nFig. 3 Cryo-EM structure determination of apo-state and agonist-bound \u03b22AR using the CN fusion strategy. (A-B) Three-dimensional maps and models of the \u03b22AR\u2013CN-FKBP12 complex in apo (A) and norepinephrine-bound (B) states. The density map for norepinephrine is shown in the inset as a blue mesh. (C) Superimposition of the \u03b22AR structures in apo (cyan), norepinephrine-bound (green) and carazolol-bound (orange) states. (D) Comparison of the local resolution maps of the \u03b22AR in apo, norepinephrine-bound, and carazolol-bound states. The orthosteric binding pocket is highlighted with black circles in the bottom panels.\nAlthough crystallization has enabled the determination of many inactive GPCR\nstructures, most of the successful cases required a high-affinity antagonist or extensive\nthermostabilization by mutagenesis to make the receptor as stable as possible(3). For\nmost receptors \u2013including the \u03b22AR\u2013 it has not been possible to obtain structures of the apo or agonist-bound receptor alone by crystallography (in the absence of\nthermostabilizing mutations) due to the inherent dynamics of these states(15). Using the\nCN-fusion strategy, we were able to obtain the cryo-EM map of the \u03b22AR in its apo-form and norepinephrine-bound form at 3.9 \u00c5 and 3.6 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 3A-B, S4 and S5).\nDue to the lower resolution of the apo-state, especially in the extracellular ends of the TM\nsegments and extracellular loops (Fig. S4D), many of the side chains could not be\nmodeled; nevertheless, the overall structures of the apo-state and norepinephrine-bound\n\u03b22AR are nearly identical to the antagonist-bound structure (Fig. 3C). However, local resolution analysis show that the apo-state receptor is much more flexible than the\nantagonist-bound or agonist-bound receptor, especially in the orthosteric pocket and\nextracellular loops (Fig. 3D), consistent with the notion that ligand binding stabilizes the\nconformation around the orthosteric binding pocket. Of note, the TM6 conformation in the\nnorepinephrine-bound structure is the same as the inactive state (Fig. 3C). Previously we\nobtained a crystal structure of the \u03b22AR-T4L fusion protein bound to a covalent agonist where TM6 was also in an inactive conformation(16). These results are consistent with\nfluorescence and spectroscopic studies demonstrating that agonist alone cannot stabilize\nTM6 of the \u03b22AR in a fully active conformation (15, 17). It\u2019s also possible that the CNfusion stabilizes the inactive conformation of TM6.\nPharmacological studies have revealed that agonists of GPCRs have at least two\nbinding modes: a low affinity binding mode in the absence of intracellular proteins (e.g. G\nprotein, arrestin, or nanobody) and a high affinity binding mode when coupled to\nintracellular binders(18, 19). This can be explained by the model of allosteric coupling\nFig.4 Comparison of agonist binding modes in inactive and active states. (A) Density map and model of the norepinephrine-bound orthosteric pocket residues. (B) Comparison of the orthosteric binding pockets of norepinephrine-bound inactive structure and epinephrine-bound active structure. (C-D) Detailed polar interactions between norepinephrine with inactive \u03b22AR and epinephrine with active \u03b22AR.\nbetween the intracellular signaling proteins and the ligand-binding pocket(18). Indeed,\nnumerous biophysical studies have revealed the conformational changes stabilized by\nthe intracellular protein propagate to the extracellular ligand binding site of GPCRs(20,\n21). The norepinephrine-bound inactive \u03b22AR structure, together with the previously determined active \u03b22AR crystal structure bound to epinephrine \u2013a nearly identical ligand\u2013 and stabilized by a G protein mimetic nanobody(14) allow us to compare the two states\n(low affinity and high affinity). For the norepinephrine-bound structure, densities for the\nligand and orthosteric pocket residues are relatively well-defined (Fig. 3B and 4A).\nComparison of the inactive and active structures shows that there is a 1.5-2 \u00c5 inward\nmovement for TM5 and TM6 in the pocket upon binding with a G protein mimetic\nnanobody (Fig. 4B). The contraction of TM5 and TM6 results in different polar interactions\nbetween the ligand and receptor (Fig. 4C-D). The amino-ethanol group of norepinephrine/epinephrine forms similar hydrogen-bonding interactions with D1133.32 and N3127.39 in both states (Fig. 4C-D). In the active state, the meta-hydroxyl can form hydrogen bonds with both S2035.42 and N2936.55 while the para-hydroxyl forms hydrogen bond with S2075.46. S2045.43 is also involved in the polar network through a hydrogenbonding interaction with N2936.55, which further stabilizes the interactions between TM5/6\nand the ligand (Fig. 4D). In contrast, in the inactive state, norepinephrine can only form a weak hydrogen bond (~3.5 \u00c5) with S2035.42 through the para-hydroxyl, which results in\nmuch weakened overall interactions between receptor and the ligand (Fig. 4C). Together,\nthese results provide a direct structural explanation for the distinct binding affinity of an\nagonist in the absence and presence of G protein or G protein mimetic nanobody.\nIn summary, we have developed a protein engineering strategy for structural\ndetermination of GPCRs using cryo-EM, in which the heterodimer protein calcineurin is\nfused to a GPCR by three points of attachment. We demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmethod by solving the antagonist-bound inactive structure of the \u03b22AR. Moreover, we show that this fusion strategy can also be utilized to determine the structure of receptors\nin the apo-state and bound to a low affinity agonist. Recently, a three-points fusion\nstrategy has also been used to determine the high-resolution structure of a glucose\ntransporter by fusion a GFP to the intracellular loop and a GFP-binding nanobody to the\nC-terminus(22). Although this particular study uses two different proteins interacting with\neach other, these results, together with our calcineurin-fusion strategy, suggest that the\nthree-points fusion strategy might provide a more rigid fiducial maker for particle\nalignment of small integral membrane proteins during cryo-EM data processing. However,\none might still need to optimize the three linkers to get the fusion protein as rigid as\npossible without affecting the receptor activity. While this might be a time-consuming step,\nthe \u03b22AR-CN design can be used as an initial template for most of other Family A GPCRs through simple sequence alignment. It should be noted that much higher resolution GPCR\nmaps were obtained in a recent published study where a universal nanobody was used\nas a fiducial maker for cryo-EM analysis(23). This is probably due to the more rigid\nnanobody-bound receptor complex. Indeed, the local resolution map of \u03b22AR-CN shows much better resolution of the CN than of the \u03b22AR (Fig. S2F, S4D and S5D), indicating there is still flexibility between CN and receptor. Additional optimization of the linkers\nmaybe helpful to further improve the resolution. We believe this approach may have broad\napplications in determining the structures of other Family A GPCRs in apo-state or ligand-\nbound (orthosteric and/or allosteric) state, and to facilitate structure-based drug\ndevelopment targeting GPCRs."

            "text": "The human FKBP12 gene was cloned into pGEX-2TK vector with a C-terminal 6x His tag. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown to A600 = 0.8 at 37\u00b0C in TB media containing 0.1% glucose, 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG and were incubated for 8 hours at 37\u00b0C. Cells were harvest and disrupted by sonication. FKBP12 proteins were first purified by Ni-NTA chromatography and then size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPEs pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 100 \u03bcM TCEP and 5 \u03bcM FK506. Monodisperse peak fractions were collected and concentration using a 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff Millipore concentrator to a concentration at around 15mg/ml. The concentrated FKBP12 were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C before use. Expression and purification of \u03b22AR-CN The \u03b22AR-CN fusion sequence was cloned into pFastBac vector with a N-terminal FLAG tag. Recombinant baculovirus for insect cell expression was made using the Bac-to-Bac system. Sf9 cells were grown in SIM SF Medium (Sino Biological Inc.) at 27 \u00b0C and were infected with recombinant baculovirus containing \u03b22AR-CN gene at a density of 4 x 106 cells per mL in the presence of 2 \u03bcM alprenolol. After 48 hours infection, the cells were\nspun down and cell pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Thawed cell pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer composed of 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 10 \u03bcM carazolol or 100 \u03bcM norepinephrine, 2.5 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin and 160 \u03bcg/mL benzamidine to lyse the cells by hypotonic. Cell membranes were then spun down and solubilized with a buffer of 20 mM HEPEs pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 % DDM, 0.03 % CHS, 2.5 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 160 \u03bcg/mL benzamidine, 5 mM CaCl2 and 10 \u03bcM carazolol or 100 \u03bcM norepinephrine at 4 \u00b0C for 1 hour. The solubilized receptor was then loaded onto a column with anti-flag M1 affinity resin and was extensively washed with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPEs, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 % DDM, 0.003 % CHS, 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 \u03bcM carazolol or 100 \u03bcM norepinephrine. The receptor was then gradually exchanged into a buffer containing 20 mM HEPEs pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.0075% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG, Anatrace), 0.0025%GDN, 0.001% CHS, 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 \u03bcM carazolol or 100 \u03bcM norepinephrine, and then eluted with same buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml flag peptide and 5 mM EDTA. The flag affinity chromatography purified receptor was supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 immediately, then concentrated to 500 \u03bcL and finally purified by SEC chromatography with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPEs pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.00075%LMNG, 0.00025%GDN, 0.0001% CHS, 0.5mM CaCl2 and 10 \u03bcM carazolol or 100 \u03bcM norepinephrine. The monodisperse peak fractions was collected and concentrated to ~10 mg/ml for cryo-EM analysis. For complexing with FKBP12, the monodisperse peak fractions were collected and incubated with excess FKBP12 in the presence of 5 \u03bcM FK506 for 1 hour on ice. The \u03b22AR-CN-FKBP12 mix was then subjected to SEC chromatography against a buffer containing 20 mM HEPEs pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.00075%LMNG, 0.00025%GDN, 0.0001% CHS, 0.5mM CaCl2, 10 \u03bcM carazolol or 100 \u03bcM norepinephrine and 5 \u03bcM FK506. The complex peak was collected and concentrated to ~10 mg/ml for cryo-EM. For the apo-state sample, no ligand was added in expression and all purification steps. Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection For carazolol and norepinephrine-bound samples, amorphous alloy film (CryoMatrix nickel titanium alloy film, R1.2/1.3, Zhenjiang Lehua Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.) was glow-discharged for 60 s at a Tergeo-EM plasma cleaner. 3 \u03bcL purified \u03b22AR-CN or \u03b22ARCN-FKBP12 sample was applied onto the grid and then blotted for 3 s with blotting force 0 and quickly plunged into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen using Vitrobot Mark IV\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at 4\u00b0C and with 100% humidity. Cryo-EM data were collected on a 300 kV Titan Krios Gi3 microscope. The raw movies were recorded by Gatan K3 BioQuantum Camera at a magnification of 105 000, and a pixel size of 0.85 \u00c5. Inelastically scattered electrons were excluded by a GIF Quantum energy filter (Gatan, USA) using a slit width of 20 eV. The movie stacks were acquired with a defocus range of -1.0 to -1.6 micron with a total exposure time 2.5s fragmented into 50 frames (0.05s/frame) and with a dose rate of 22.0 e/pixel/s. The imaging mode was super resolution with 2-time hardware binning. Semi-automatic data acquisition was performed using SerialEM. For the apo-state sample, a Quantifoil grid (R1.2/1.3, Au) was glow-discharged for 45 s at easiGlow discharged cleaning system. An aliquot of 3 \u03bcL sample was deposited onto the grid and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane using an Vitrobot Mark IV. Data collection was conducted on Titan Krios operated at 300 keV using a nominal magnification of 130,000x. Movies were captured using a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector in counted mode, which resulted in a pixel size of 0.85 \u00c5. Movie stacks were obtained with a defocus range of -1.0 to -2.0 \u03bcm, using SerialEM 3.7.10 with a set of customized scripts enabling automated low-dose image acquisition. Each movie stack was recorded for a total of 8 seconds with 0.2 s per frame. The exposure rate was 7 electrons per pixel per second. Cryo-EM image analysis and model building The image stacks of the \u03b22AR-CN fusion protein were collected and subjected for motion correction using MotionCor2(24). Contrast transfer function parameters were estimated by CTFFIND4(25), implemented in RELION3.1(26). 2,000 particles were manually picked and extracted from the motion-corrected micrographs followed with 2D classification. Templates were selected from the 2D classification result. Particles were auto-picked using the templates in RELION and then subjected to 2D classification using cryoSPARC(27). Selected particles with appropriate 2D average from 2D classification were further subjected to Ab-initio reconstruction. Particles with appropriate initial model were selected from Ab-initio followed by homogeneous refinement in cryoSPARC. After global and local CTF refinement, the particles (kept to 325\u2019064) were subjected to nonuniform refinement for a 4.20 angstrom reconstruction determined by gold standard Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 criterion. Data processing for the \u03b22AR-CN-\nFKBP12 complexes were all done in cryoSPARC. For the carazolol-bound \u03b22AR-CNFKBP12 complex, a total of 6\u2019001 image stacks were collected and subjected to patch motion correction and patch CTF refinement. 2\u2019819\u2019890 particles were auto-picked using the \u03b22AR-CN map as a template and then subjected to 2D classification followed by Abinitio reconstruction and 2 rounds of heterogeneous refinement. The resulting particles were subject to non-uniform refinement and local refinement and yielded a map at 3.6 \u00c5. After local motion correction and another round of non-uniform refinement and local refinement, the resolution was improved to 3.49 \u00c5. The norepinephrine-bound and apostate datasets were processed in a similar way as the carazolol-bound dataset(Fig. S4B and S5B). The crystal structure of the inactive \u03b22AR (PDB code: 2RH1), rat calcineurin (PDB code: 4IL1) and FKBP12-FK506 (PDB code: 1FKJ) were used as initial models for model rebuilding and refinement against EM density map. The models were docked into the EM density map using UCSF Chimera(28), followed by iterative manual building in Coot(29) and refinement in Phenix(30). Radio-ligand binding assay Cell membranes were prepared following a previously reported protocol(31). Radioligand saturation binding of the antagonist [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (PerkinElmer) was conducted with the cell membranes to a final volume of 250 \u03bcL. Briefly, the cell membranes were diluted in assay buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mg/mL BSA. Serial dilutions of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol at indicated final concentrations were incubated with the membranes for 1.5 hours while shaking at 200 rpm at room temperature. The membranes were washed and collected by filtration with a 48-well Brandel harvester. The filter papers containing the membrane were incubated with a 3 mL OptiPhase HiSafe 3 liquid scintillation cocktail. Radioactivity was counted with a Microbeta2 scintillation counter. All curves were constructed from mean \u00b1 s.e.m of three independent experiments at three replicas, and the saturation binding data were analyzed in the GraphPad Prism software using a one-site saturation binding equation. For radioligand competition binding, membrane solutions were incubated with 2nM [3H]dihydroalprenolol and the unlabeled competitor to a final volume of 250 \u03bcL. The assay buffer contains 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mg/mL BSA. Binding reactions were incubated and shaken at room temperature for 1.5 hours and were harvested using a 48-well Brandel harvester. All curves were constructed from mean \u00b1\ns.e.m of three independent experiments at three replicas. Competition binding data were analyzed in the GraphPad Prism software using a one-site competitive binding equation."
