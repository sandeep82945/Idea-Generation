The battery showed a capacity of 81 mA h g 1 at 30 C, and its capacity retention rate was 89% after 50 cycles. After increasing the temperature to 80 C, its initial capacity increased to 111 mA h g 1 with a capacity retention rate of 93.6% after 100 cycles, which was much higher than that of the aqueous electrolyte (WS-20)-based zinc ion battery (71.8%).

In addition, the growth of dendrites needs to be suppressed.6,7 Although highperformance cathodes have been developed to overcome the above-mentioned problems,8\u201310 the electrolyte also directly affects the performance of ZIBs.11 Concentrated salt and other additives (organic solvents and ionic liquids)12\u201315 were incorporated in aqueous electrolytes by tuning the solvation sheath\nEngineering, Jishou University, Jishou,\n.cn ering, Jishou University, Jishou, 416000,\nou, 416000, China (ESI) available: 1H NMR and 13C NMR ng intermediates, Nyquist plots of and ra00298a\n03\nof Zn2+ to promote the plating/stripping and migration of Zn2+.16 However, the water-induced side reactions are inevitable, and thus the development of new electrolytes without water, such as organic electrolytes and solid (or quasi-solid) electrolytes, is very important.17\nIonic liquids (ILs), which are obtained via the quaternization of molecules containing nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur atoms, etc., possess the properties of low vapor pressure, appropriate conductivity, wide ESW and non-ammable nature, and hence can be considered safer than conventional organic electrolytes and better electrode interfacial contacts than solid electrolytes. However, the relatively poor stability of common ILs at high temperature limits their application.18 Among them, imidazolium ILs are the most widely investigated,19 where an improvement in their stability is usually realized via C-2 substitution but their functionalization is relative tedious.20 Triazolium ILs possess similar chemical structures to that of imidazolium ILs but show higher stability and wider ESW,20\u201322 and the emergence of azide\u2013alkyne click chemistry allows the convenient and exible functionalization of triazolium. To date, triazolium ILs have been studied as conductive units in polyelectrolytes,23,24 but seldomly reported as IL electrolytes for electrochemical energy storage devices. As is known, the main shortcoming of ILs is their high viscosity, which limits their conductivity and hinders the diffusion of ions, and thus some strategies have\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Thus, all the above-mentioned results conrm the successful quaternization. Usually, ILs with the TFSI anion possess higher electrochemical stability and weaker interaction intensity with cations, which is benecial for electrochemical applications.36 Subsequently, the I anion was exchanged with the TFSI anion, and the chemical shi of the triazolium protons shied high-eld relative to the corresponding triazolium iodide ILs (Fig. S5, S9 and S12,\u2020 respectively), showing that the anion exchange reactions proceeded completely.

As shown in Fig. 1(a), T1 without \u2013OH groups displayed the highest thermal decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 301 C, whereas T2 and T3 displayed a lower Tds than that of T1, indicating that the presence of \u2013OH groups lowered the thermal stability of the ILs. This because \u2013OH groups possess stronger polarity than that of \u2013OCH3, and hence display a lower activation energy for degradation during heating.37,38 Furthermore, a low glass transition temperature (Tg) is benecial for the rapid transportation of ions to some extent, especially in polyelectrolytes, and hence the Tgs of the ILs was measured via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fig. 1(b) shows the DSC curves of T1, T2 and T3. Similarly, T1 displayed the lowest Tg of 59 C, which is still was higher than that of imidazolium-based ILs with alkyl chains.39 The presence of \u2013OH and \u2013OCH2\u2013 groups results in increased polarity and viscosity in\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

For instance, at 30 C, the conductivity of T1 (0.88 10 3 S cm 1) is about 3-times higher than that of T3 (0.28 10 3 S cm 1) and 1.5-times higher than that of T2 (0.57 10 3 S cm 1). The conductivity decreased with an increase in the number of terminal \u2013OH groups also because the polarity of the \u2013OH group is not conducive to ion transport. The above-mentioned DSC results also demonstrated this trend, that is, T1 without \u2013OH groups displayed the lowest Tg, and hence benecial for ion migration and enhancement in conductivity.41 Furthermore, an increase in temperature also improved the conductivity,22 where the highest s value of T1 was 2.65 10 3 S cm 1 at 110 C.\nThe above-mentioned results illustrate that T1 possesses the best performance among the ILs, but its conductivity still need to be improved. An increase in ionic conductivity depends on efficient ion transport, including the number of ions, which is determined by the portion of salts added. Another factor is the mobility of ions, which depends on the ability of the molecules to move. More importantly, researchers have proposed the use of high concentration zinc salt and lithium salt electrolyte (usually 1 M Zn2+ and 20 M Li+) to overcome the shortcomings of conventional aqueous ZIBs,42 such as low Coulomb efficiency, hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction, and dendrite growth\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 8394\u20138403 | 8397"

The conductivity of T1S-x was calculated based on the measured Nyquist diagram, as shown in Fig. S15.\u2020 The conductivity increased with an increase in the amount of LiTFSI when x is less than 20 due to the increase in carrier LiTFSI salt. Themaximum conductivity of 1.55 10 3 S cm 1 was realized when x was 20. Upon the further addition of LiTFSI, the conductivity decreased due to the increase in viscosity.43 In comparison, an aqueous electrolyte with the concentration of 1 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 + 20 M LiTFSI was prepared, which was denoted asWS-20, and its conductivity was determined to be 2.74 10 3 S cm 1 (calculated using the Nyquist diagram, Fig. S16\u2020), which is higher than that of T1S-20. The conductivity of the two types of electrolytes reached the magnitude of 10 3 S cm 1, and thus they could be used in ZIBs."

A similar phenomenon was reported for PEO-based solid polyelectrolyte with and without terminal \u2013OH groups.45 As reported previously, the addition of salt can reduce the \u201cfree\u201d solvent in the system and decrease the reactivity of the solvent, thus improving the electrochemical stability.46\u201348 Herein, the addition of salts resulted in a broader ESW of 6.36 V for T1S-20 and 4.46 V for WS-20 (Fig. 2(b)).\nTo evaluate the application of the ILs in ZIBs, Zn/Li3V2(PO4)3 batteries were prepared using T1S-20 and WS-20 as the electrolyte. Firstly, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were tested for three cycles at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV S 1 at 30 C. It can be seen in Fig. 3(a) that the T1S-20 system showed two pairs of redox peaks at 1.39/1.47 V and 1.32/1.41 V, which are ascribed to the stepwise Li+ extraction/insertion from/into the Li3V2(PO4)3\nFig. 2 Linear sweep voltammetry curves of (a) T1, T2, T3 and (b) T1S-20\n8398 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 8394\u20138403\nstructure, respectively,30,49 which exhibit a good degree of coincidence.

Aer adjusting the current density back to 0.2 A g 1, the capacity of the T1S-20 andWS-20 systems was 79 and 67 mA h g 1, respectively.

Hence, the T1S-20 system has better cyclic stability than the WS-20 system. As mentioned above, the electrode materials affect the performances of ZIBs, where dissolution of the cathode materials will reduce the utilization of the active substances56 and side reactions will decrease the cycle stability and irreversibility.

On the contrary, in the T1S-20 system, its wide ESW, high thermal stability and absence of water guaranteed the stability of the battery.48,58 Also, no molecules decomposed during the charge/discharge procedure to interact with vanadium and cause its dissolution.56 Furthermore, no (Zn(H2O)6) 2+ was formed in the T1S-20 system, which may generate a irreversibility issue in the Zn anode, and hence the T1S-20 systembased ZIB displayed a better performance.

As shown in Fig. 7(a), two platforms located at about 1.39 and 1.48 V can be observed during the charging process. The rst platform (1.39 V) is ascribed to the rst Li+ ion extraction from Li3V2(PO4)3, resulting in the oxidation of V3+ to V4+. The second platform (1.48 V) corresponds to the extraction of a second Li+ ion with the transformation of Li2V2(PO4)3 to LiV2(PO4)3. The discharge platforms are located at about 1.43 and 1.33 V, respectively, corresponding to the insertion of two Li+ ions in the LiV2(PO4)3 lattice with the reduction of V4+ to V3+.30,49 At 80 C, similar platforms could be observed (Fig. 7(b)).\nFig. 8 depicts the Zn foil anode in the ZIBs aer 50 cycles with the WS-20 and T1S-20 electrolytes at 30 C, verifying the superiority of the ILs.
