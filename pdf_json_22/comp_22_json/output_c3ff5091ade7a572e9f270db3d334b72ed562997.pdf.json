    "abstractText": "This paper presents the SAGT Turkish\u2013German code-switching treebank, and observations and annotation challenges we encountered during its development. The treebank consists of transcriptions of bilingual conversations annotated with several layers: language IDs, lemmas, POS tags, morphological features, and dependency relations. The annotations follow the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme and the conventions used in monolingual treebanks as much as possible. We present and discuss a number of issues that arise because of the need for consistent multilingual annotation within a single treebank, as well as the informal language, which is where code-switching is observed most. Besides proposing solutions to these issues, we present some observations about codeswitching phenomena that are only possible to observe in a data set with rich linguistic annotation. The treebank was annotated with a focus on quality of annotations through an iterative process of detecting and correcting annotation errors. We also present quantitative measures for indication of annotation quality. The code-switching treebank created in this study is released to the public through Universal Dependencies repositories.",

The annotations follow the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme and the conventions used in monolingual treebanks as much as possible. We present and discuss a number of issues that arise because of the need for consistent multilingual annotation within a single treebank, as well as the informal language, which is where code-switching is observed most. Besides proposing solutions to these issues, we present some observations about codeswitching phenomena that are only possible to observe in a data set with rich linguistic annotation. The treebank was annotated with a focus on quality of annotations through an iterative process of detecting and correcting annotation errors. We also present quantitative measures for indication of annotation quality.

            "text": "Code-switching (CS) is the process of mixing more than one language in written or spoken communication (Myers-Scotton 1993; Poplack 2001; Toribio and Bullock 2012). It is a phenomenon commonly observed in multilingual societies (Auer and Wei 2007), mainly in informal settings such as social media and spoken communication. For instance, (1) shows a sentence from a dialogue that mixes Turkish and German (in bold).1 The speaker starts with Turkish, switches to German, goes back to Turkish, and ends the sentence with a mixed word where the German noun Gastfamilie \u2018host family\u2019 is inflected with the Turkish Locative suffix -de.\nThe sentence is relatively simple and the overall meaning is derivable from the individual words. Yet, its syntax is not standard. The main predicate kald\u0131m \u2018I stayed\u2019 is in Turkish and the whole sentence seemingly follows the Turkish syntax, except the noun phrase iki Wochen \u2018two weeks\u2019. Nouns modified by numbers are in singular in Turkish, but Wochen is in plural. The construction is more complex than using the German equivalent of \u2018week\u2019 in a Turkish phrase. It seems, when the speaker switches to German on the surface, s/he inherently switches to the German syntax as well, where the noun should be plural.\nSuch CS-specific constructions vary from non-canonical morphological marking to creating new syntactic representations, to applying a linguistic phenomenon of one language to the other. They make structural analysis of code-switching linguistically interesting and computationally challenging. Several approaches tackle these challenges by utilising labelled and unlabelled monolingual and parallel data, e.g., by creating artificial CS data and using them in training models for processing CS (Pratapa et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). However, to be able to capture unique cases like the singular-to-plural mapping for \u2018week\u2019 in (1), those models need to see such instances. Thus, to observe the characteristics of CS and address them with data-driven tools, we present a treebank, namely the SAGT treebank, of Turkish\u2013German transcriptions with language ID, lemma, part-ofspeech (POS), morphology, and dependency layers.\nWe have chosen Universal Dependencies (UD, Nivre et al. 2016, 2020; de Marneffe et al. 2021) as our annotation scheme. The UD project aims to define morphosyntactic annotation guidelines that are consistent across languages. Its unified tag sets and annotation standards facilitate the annotation of multiple languages within a single treebank. Furthermore, annotations parallel to monolingual resources are useful for making use of these resources, e.g., for transfer learning (Bhat et al. 2018).\n1 Throughout the paper, when an example contains both Turkish and German tokens, German tokens are represented in bold. The morphosyntactic tags used in glosses are explained in Table 2 in Appendix 1.\nDespite clear advantages of the UD framework for annotating CS treebanks, the annotation of multiple languages in a single treebank needs additional considerations that have not been studied before. Although there have been a few UD treebanks with code-switching (Bhat et al. 2018; Partanen et al. 2018; Seddah et al. 2020; Braggaar and van der Goot 2021), the papers describing these treebanks do not document or discuss the code-switching aspects of the annotation process, except for a brief section in (Braggaar and van der Goot 2021).\nIn this paper we address this gap and outline some of the challenges and interesting phenomena that surface during the annotation of a Turkish\u2013German code-switching treebank. Our main contribution is the publicly available treebank, that also has accompanying audio files,2 which enable multimodal studies. Our goal is, however, to go beyond resource description and contribute to both codeswitching and treebanking communities with our observations and discussions. The observations on code-switching, independent of the annotation scheme, help in understanding in what forms it occurs. The annotation solutions we propose explore how to handle CS within the UD framework. Working with spoken data brings another aspect and also opens speech annotation under UD to discussion."

            "text": "Many well-known linguistic theories on CS syntax, e.g., Free Morpheme and Equivalence Constraints (Poplack 1980), Closed-class Constraint (Joshi 1982), Matrix Language Frame (Myers-Scotton 1993), Functional Head Constraint (Belazi et al. 1994) define their formalism and constraints on constituency structures. Eppler (2005) argues that these constraints are too restrictive from a data-driven perspective and favours Word Grammar (Hudson 1990), a dependency-based formalism, where the scope of the constraints is head-dependent pairs. Her annotations on German\u2013English transcriptions and the Chinese\u2013English treebank (Wang and Liu 2013), which also follows Word Grammar, are the only CS dependency treebanks that do not follow UD, to the best of our knowledge.\nThe starting point for our work is the monolingual UD treebanks of both languages in our study. The current 2.8 release of UD includes eight Turkish and four German treebanks. Turkish treebanks include IMST-UD (Sulubacak et al. 2016b), which is semi-automatically converted from the IMST treebank (Sulubacak et al. 2016a) which, in turn, is a re-annotation of the METU-Sabanc\u0131 treebank (Oflazer et al. 2003). Turkish GB (C\u0327o\u0308ltekin 2015) is a manually annotated treebank consisting of grammar book examples. The Turkish BOUN treebank (Tu\u0308rk et al. 2020) is a more recent treebank annotating sentences from five different text types. Version 2.8 of UD introduced four new Turkish treebanks.3 To the best of our\n2 The audio files are available for research purposes, subject to a licence agreement, due to EU data privacy regulations. 3 https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/tr_framenet/index.html\nhttps://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/tr_kenet/index.html https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/tr_penn/index.html https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/tr_tourism/index.html.\nknowledge, these new treebanks are not yet described in a publication. There are PUD treebanks consisting of parallel (translated) sentences for both languages. The PUD treebanks were automatically converted from another dependency scheme for the CoNLL 2017 multilingual parsing shared task (Zeman et al. 2017). The first German UD treebank is the GSD treebank (McDonald et al. 2013), which is also automatically converted from a different dependency formalism. Version 2.4 introduced two new additions to German treebanks; HDT, a conversion of Hamburg Dependency Treebank (Foth et al. 2014; Hennig and Ko\u0308hn 2017), and LIT, a treebank of German literary history.4 There is also a treebank of German tweets, tweeDe (Rehbein et al. 2019), which has not yet taken its place on the UD repositories.\nMost of our annotation decisions and the discussions below are based on the version 2.4 of the UD treebanks, particularly Turkish IMST, and German GSD and HDT. There are, however, inconsistencies across languages, and across treebanks of the same language. For most annotation decisions, we follow the annotations in the monolingual treebanks as much as possible. In case of inconsistencies across treebanks, our policy is to choose the alternative closest to the general UD guidelines, so as to ensure cross-lingual consistency within our multilingual treebank.\nNone of the treebanks noted above include spoken language, let alone codeswitching. Quite a few UD treebanks, on the other hand, contain spoken language partially (Danish DDT, English GUM, English LinES, Greek GDT, Latvian LVTB, Khunsari AHA, Nayini AHA, Persian Seraji, Polish LFG, Scottish Gaelic ARCOSG, Skolt Sami Giellagas, Soi AHA, South Levantine Arabic MADAR, and Swedish LinES) or fully (Beja NSC, Cantonese HK, Chinese HK, Chukchi HSE, French Spoken, Naija NSC, Norwegian NynorskLIA, and Slovenian SST). These treebanks have extended the UD dependency relations with subtypes, in addition to using the existing ones to cover linguistic phenomena mainly observed in speech. For example, Slovenian SST (Dobrovoljc and Nivre 2016) annotates correcting disfluencies either with reparandum or parataxis:restart. Another parataxis subtype, parataxis:discourse is defined to cover sentential parentheticals with fixed semantics that serve as discourse elements (e.g., you know). French Spoken (Gerdes and Kahane 2017) and Naija NSC (Courtin et al. 2018) employ the same tag too. They define a separate tag called parataxis:dislocated for clauses that precede the sentence they are dislocated from. The other relation that is commonly extended is discourse. Slovenian SST separates filler sounds from other discourse elements and assigns them the relation discourse:filler. Norwegian NynorskLIA (\u00d8vrelid and Hohle 2016) follows the same approach. Cantonese HK and Chinese HK (Leung et al. 2016) define the tag discourse:sp for sentence particles common in spoken language. So far we are more conservative in extending relations with subtypes and have introduced two that are described in Sect. 4.1.\nThe Hindi-English UD treebank (Bhat et al. 2018) annotates the mixed language of social media and has no extension to UD dependencies. The major annotation\n4 https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/de_lit/index.html.\naugmentation is the language IDs assigned to each token. Komi-Zyrian IKDP (Partanen et al. 2018) consists of spoken language, and some utterances include Russian phrases. In those utterances mixed and Russian tokens are marked with respective language IDs, and the Russian syntax is applied. However, the authors do not claim any consistency with the annotations of the monolingual Russian UD treebank. Similar to these treebanks, we also assign a language ID to each token following the tag set in (C\u0327etinog\u0306lu 2016). Many other treebanks include words or phrases from a foreign language. Most of them mark foreign tokens with Foreign=Yes, and annotate the internal structure of foreign phrases with flat relations. However, a few treebanks, e.g., Irish IDT (Lynn and Foster 2016), annotate foreign tokens according to their respective language. Recently, two codeswitching treebanks are released. The first contains Romanised Algerian sentences from social media, hence the language is a mix of Northern African Arabic with mainly French and Modern Standard Arabic (Seddah et al. 2020). The second one is a Frisian-Dutch treebank that annotates radio transcriptions (Braggaar and van der Goot 2021). Both treebanks use the existing UD relations and subtypes, although the former one does not fully comply with UD yet."

Example topics are work and studies (i.e., typically German-speaking environments) in a dialogue started in Turkish, or holidays and food in Turkey (hence Turkish-specific words) in a German-dominated conversation.\nThere are 48 distinct conversations in our collection. 20 participants took part in the recordings. The majority of the speakers are university students; hence, the most frequent age range is 18\u201325. Common conversation themes include studies, work, travel, future plans, and free time activities such as sports, books, and TV.\n5 Born and raised in Germany to families with Turkish migration background, they are native speakers of both languages."

            "heading": "3.2 Transcription layers",
            "text": "The transcription and annotations are done using Praat.6 We created six tiers for each audio file: spk1_verbal, spk1_norm, spk2_verbal, spk2_norm, lang, codesw. The first four tiers contain the verbal and normalised transcriptions of speakers 1 and 2. Tier definitions are given in Sect. 3.3. The tier lang corresponds to the language of intervals and can have TR for Turkish, DE for German, and LANG3 for utterances in other languages. The first five tiers are intervals, while the last one is a point tier that denotes sentence and code-switching boundaries. The labels on the boundaries are SB when both sides of the boundary are in the same language SCS when the language changes from one sentence to the next (intersentential), WCS when the switch is between words within a sentence (intrasentential).\nSince Turkish is agglutinative and case markers determine the function of NPs, non-Turkish common and proper nouns with Turkish suffixes are commonly observed in CS conversations. We mark such words in the codesw tier as an intraword switch and use the symbol \u00a7 following C\u0327etinog\u0306lu (2016). Example (2) depicts the representation of a mixed word where the German noun Semester \u2018semester\u2019 (in bold) is followed by the Turkish locative case marker -da. Figure 5 in Appendix 1 demonstrates the Praat representation of this word as part of a full sentence. The \u00a7 and WCS boundaries, and tiers could be observed from the figure.\nFor many proper names and for some loan words, Turkish and German orthography are identical. Here, the speech data in parallel becomes an advantage, and the language is decided according to the pronunciation. If the word is pronounced in German and followed by a Turkish suffix, a \u00a7 switch point is inserted. Otherwise it follows the Turkish orthography. Master\u00a7da \u2018in Master\u2019s\u2019 from (5) is such an example where German Master is followed by Turkish locative suffix da. While Turkish has a translation for Master\u2019s (i.e., \u2018yu\u0308ksek lisans\u2019), it is also common to use the term as Master in academic communities. Thus, orthographically Masterda is ambiguous. However, in German Master is pronounced similar to / /, while in Turkish pronunciation would be / /. Following the pronunciation in the audio, we take Master as a German word hence Master\u00a7da becomes a mixed one. 3.3 Transcription guidelines\nFor speech analysis it is important to transcribe utterances close to how they are pronounced. In some transcription guidelines, capitalisation and punctuation are omitted (e.g., in the SEAME corpus by Lyu et al. 2015);7 in some others they are used to mark speech information (e.g., in the Kiezdeutsch corpus by Rehbein et al.\n6 http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat. 7 https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/docs/LDC2015S04/SEAME.V4.0.pdf.\n2014).8 Text analysis on the other hand generally relies on standard orthography. This raises a conflict between two tasks on how to transcribe speech. To avoid this problem, we introduced two tiers of transcription. The verbal tier follows the speech conventions. If a speaker uses a contraction, the word is transcribed as contracted. The acronyms are written as separate characters. Numbers are spelled out. Recurring characters are represented with the single character followed by a colon. The normalised tier follows the edited text conventions. Words obey the orthographic rules of standard Turkish and German, e.g., characters of acronyms are merged back. Punctuation is added to the text, obeying the tokenisation standards (i.e., separated from the preceding and following tokens with a space).\nExample (3) gives a sentence showing the verbal and normalised tiers for a Turkish sentence. The r sound in the progressive tense suffix -yor is not pronounced, hence omitted in the verbal tier. The vowel of the interjection ya is extended during speech, and the colon representation is used to reflect it in the verbal tier, yet the normalised tier has the standard form. Also, the question mark is present in the normalised tier.\nIf a made-up word is uttered, it is preceded with an asterisk mark in the transcription. Note that dialectal pronunciation or using a valid word in wrong context is not considered within this class. Partial words are marked with two hyphens instead of the common use of one hyphen, as the latter is used in German to denote the initial part of a compound when two compounds share a common part and the first compound is written only as the unshared part (e.g., Wohn- und Schlafzimmer \u2018living room and bedroom\u2019).\nWe also marked [silence], [laugh], [cough], [breathe], [noise], and put the remaining sounds into the [other] category. Overlaps occur usually when one speaker is talking and the other is uttering backchannel signals and words of acknowledgement.9 There are also cases when both speakers tend to speak at the same time. In all such cases, both voices are transcribed, one speaker is chosen to be the main speaker, and an [overlap] marker is inserted to the secondary speaker\u2019s verbal and normalised tiers. The codesw and lang tiers are decided according to the main speaker\u2019s transcription.\n8 http://www.kiezdeutschkorpus.de/files/kidko/downloads/KiDKo-Transkriptionsrichtlinien.pdf. 9 Backchannel signals are a listener\u2019s responses to a speaker to express reactions such as attention, understanding, or confirmation. Common backchannel and acknowledgement utterances from our corpus include mh, ja/evet \u2018yes\u2019 in German and Turkish, genau \u2018exactly\u2019 in German and dog\u0306ru \u2018right\u2019 in Turkish."

            "text": "In data collection, processing, and maintenance we closely follow EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)10 in collaboration with the Central Data Protection Office of Baden-Wu\u0308rttemberg Universities (ZENDAS).11\nAs part of these data protection policies, we anonymise sensitive data. In deciding how to anonymise data, we had two concerns in mind. First, the anonymised sentence should be plausible syntactically and semantically so that it is not possible to infer anonymisation is applied. Second, the semantics of the data should change as minimally as possible so that common world knowledge could still be utilised (e.g., via word embeddings).\nWe employed a selective pseudonymisation strategy for data protection (Medlock 2006). We replaced information that is sensitive in context. In (4) the city where the speaker lives is personal information and should be anonymised. However, the second sentence is an opinion that could not be attributed to a specific person. Thus, we anonymise Dresden with Leipzig, but keep the cities in the second sentence untouched.\nWe paid attention to three criteria in choosing replacements: phonological parallelism (for Turkish), syntactic structure, and semantic consistency. Turkish phonology employs vowel harmony and consonant alternations that change the surface realisation of suffixes. For instance, when female names Ece and Bahar are inflected in Genitive case they have the forms Ece\u2019nin and Bahar\u2019\u0131n, respectively. When we anonymise Ece, we choose another female name ending with the same vowel, e.g., Ays\u00f9e, so that the inflected form Ays\u00f9e\u2019nin preserves the correct orthography.\nSometimes the information to anonymise consists of multiple tokens with a syntactic structure, e.g., titles, organisations, or locations. In such cases we find replacement with exact number of tokens and syntactic structure, e.g., Esslingen am Neckar \u2018Esslingen on the Neckar\u2019 is replaced with Erlenbach am Main \u2018Erlenbach on the Main\u2019. We also take into account the broader context; that is, the transcribed conversation. For instance if other sentences of the conversation explicitly mention that a city is by the seaside and has a small population, we found a replacement city with similar properties. With these criteria, we made sure that anonymisation process does not change annotation layer properties. All anonymisation is done manually. Each transcription is anonymised by two annotators to ensure privacy. Disagreements are resolved via meetings.\n10 https://gdpr-info.eu/. 11 https://www.zendas.de/."

            "text": "Segmentation and Intra-word CS Following UD, we take syntactic words12 as units of annotation. This results in segmenting some of the surface tokens in both German and Turkish. For German, the only case that require segmentation is the contraction of prepositions and definite articles. For example, the word ins \u2018to the\u2019 is tokenised into its parts as in and das. The segmentation of Turkish syntactic words is more involved. We follow previous work (C\u0327etinog\u0306lu and C\u0327o\u0308ltekin 2016; Sulubacak et al. 2016b) and segment copular suffixes and a group of productive derivational suffixes. For instance, in \u00f6g\u0306renciyim \u2018I am a student\u2019, the copula yim \u2018I am\u2019 is split, thus the segmented form is \u00f6g\u0306renci yim. The productive suffix -lH derives nouns and adjectives from a noun (N) with the meaning of \u2018with N\u2019 (e.g., mavi elbise \u2018blue dress\u2019 ! mavi elbise \u2018\u2019li(the one) with a blue dress). elbiseli is segmented into elbise li in this case. However, we do not segment lexicalised derived words. For instance, yas\u00f9l\u0131 \u2018old\u2019 comes from yas\u00f9-l\u0131 \u2018age-with\u2019 but it is completely lexicalised.\nIntra-word CS boundaries coming from transcriptions are kept as a feature in the MISCellaneous column of the CoNLL-U file (see Fig. 6 in Appendix 1). Namely, the CSPoint feature indicates the switch, e.g., CSPoint=Termin\u00a7im, where Termin \u2018appointment\u2019 is in German and -im \u2018my\u2019 is Turkish possessive suffix.\nLanguage IDs We follow the tag set of C\u0327etinog\u0306lu (2016) for language IDs. We take the TR, DE, and LANG3 labels of intervals from the transcriptions and map them to each token of the interval. When a token has intra-word CS, then the LangID value is MIXED. Punctuation and special symbols get an OTHER value. Segmentation might cause MIXED words to split such that segments\u2019 language IDs change, e.g., to DE and TR (cf. (C\u0327etinog\u0306lu and C\u0327o\u0308ltekin 2016)). In such cases annotators manually assign the new tags. The language IDs are kept as the LangID feature in the MISC column of the CoNLL-U file.\nLemmas, Part-of-Speech Tags and Morphological Features We use the Universal POS tag set of Universal Dependencies13 for POS tagging and employ the individual morphological tag set of Turkish and German treebanks.14 Note that the tag sets used might cause different semantics of the same representation between\n12 Segmentation is not in the morpheme level, yet words are not necessarily phonological or orthographic. http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/tokenization.html. 13 https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html. 14 https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/tr_imst/index.html\nhttps://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/de_gsd/index.html.\ntwo languages. For instance in German prepositional phrases Dat case marker indicates a \u2018state\u2019 meaning, whereas in corresponding Turkish phrases the same value indicates a \u2018movement\u2019, and there is a separate Loc case for \u2018state\u2019. Dependency Relations Our tag set consists of the combination of tag sets of Turkish and German treebanks. Only two new subtypes are added to the tag set: appos:trans and parataxis:trans. Both are introduced to handle translation pairs; the details are discussed in Sect. 6.1.4.15"

This analyser also gives the segmentation boundaries as part of the analyses. For German, we derived such possible analyses from the GSD treebank16 since there is no UD features-compatible morphological analyser.\nWe gave the annotators all possible analyses in a random order and asked them to disambiguate the tokens with ambiguous analyses manually, using an in-house tool. The tool provided a dropdown list for ambiguous analyses to choose from as well as individual dropdown lists for tags and features so that the annotators can overwrite values or assign their own analyses. The latter was useful especially when a MIXED or foreign word did not have any provided analyses, and when German words are not covered by the GSD treebank.\nDuring dependency annotation, the language ID, lemma, POS tag, and morphological features of each token were available to the annotators from the previous annotation step. The annotators were provided with an annotation guidelines document covering the union of Turkish and German dependency relation sets, as well as instruction on how to handle CS related issues.

The length of the sentences in the treebank is on average 17.05 tokens, with a minimum of 2, maximum 83 and a standard deviation of 9.66. The distribution of length of the sentences are presented in the left panel of Fig. 1. All sentences in the treebank contains at least one CS point, with a maximum of 20 in one example.\nThe overall distribution of the number of CS per sentence is given in the right panel of Fig. 1. Single CS points have relatively balanced patterns; in 461 cases, speakers start with German and finish with Turkish, and in 489 cases, speakers start with Turkish and finish with German. For the cases of two CS points, it is slightly more common for speakers to insert Turkish words and phrases into otherwise German sentences (277 cases) than inserting German words in Turkish sentences (310 cases).\nThe distribution of language IDs across two languages is slightly imbalanced in favour of German. The treebank contains 18,741 German (DE) and 14,179 Turkish (TR) tokens. Note that this imbalance does not necessarily indicate more dominant usage of German. The number of tokens in German is expected to be higher since\nmany linguistic functions expressed by words in German are expressed by means of morphemes in Turkish (see Sect. 5.1.3 for examples). There are also 429 words with intra-word CS, most of which are German nouns and proper nouns with Turkish suffixes. Although Turkish also has an even larger set of verbal affixes, the common way to modify a German verb through Turkish suffixes seems to be the use of lightverb constructions discussed in Sect. 6.1.3. Less interestingly, the treebank also\ncontains 179 tokens from other languages (predominantly English, tagged as LANG3), and 3704 added punctuation tokens tagged as OTHER. We present the POS tag distribution of the CS treebank in comparison to monolingual Turkish (IMST) and German (HDT) treebanks in Fig. 2. As expected from the spoken aspect of the data, our treebank is characterised by more frequent use of interjections, pronouns and adverbs in comparison to the monolingual treebanks covering standard/written language. The difference in the distributions of POS tags across languages in our treebank is also expected. Notably, there are proportionally more German pronouns (presumably because the differences in prodrop), and subordinating conjunctions (since subordination in Turkish is typically indicated with suffixes rather than subordinating conjunctions) in comparison to Turkish. A similar trend is also visible for auxiliaries, determiners and adpositions.\nThe analysis of dependency labels in comparison to monolingual treebanks indicates similar, expected observations. The spoken CS treebank has a substantially large rate of advmod dependency, and also dependencies that are very rare or nonexistent in monolingual treebanks, such as reperandum, discourse and parataxis. We also present the distribution of dependency labels within the language IDs in our treebank in Fig. 3 in Appendix 1. In general, the dependency distributions also show expected differences between two languages, e.g., more det, nsubj and mark relations for German parallel to the usage of POS tags DET, PRON and ADP discussed above. Our two new dependency types appos:trans and parataxis:trans deserves a closer look. The dependency appos:trans, indicating an apposition relation with exact translation of the head, have almost equal numbers of dependents in both languages. The difference in parataxis:trans, which marks longer parenthetical expressions that are translations of (the constructions headed by) their head, indicates that the speakers more often explain their German expressions in Turkish. We look into the details of these new dependency types as well as many other dependency relations in the following sections."

Most of the problems related to the multilingual nature of the data stem from different annotation choices established for individual languages. In this and the following sections we group these challenges and observations to discuss each of them with examples.

On the other hand, in German the copula sein is a separate word (Eisenberg 2013, p. 79), and the German GSD, PUD and LIT treebanks seem to make distinction where some its uses are annotated as the main verb. For example, these treebanks suggest that copula ist in Die Frau ist \u00c4rztin \u2018the woman is a doctor\u2019 should be annotated using cop (with head \u00c4rztin), while in Der Vortrag ist in dem gro\u00dfen Saal \u2018The lecture is in the great hall\u2019, it should be marked as the main verb.

Existential clauses are formed with the adjectives var/yok \u2018there is/there isn\u2019t\u2019 (Underhill 1976, p. 103) and follow the standard UD analysis for non-verbal predicates.

This practice is open to discussion since Turkish adjectives do not inflect.21 The motivation is to keep the zero derivation information implicitly, which would otherwise be lost in the UD annotation scheme. On the other hand, the German adjectives are marked for inflectional features indicating Case and Number as well as Gender and Degree. This result in parallel annotations within our multilingual treebank with different semantics.

            "text": "Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) is one of the common ways to measure the quality of the annotations. We report agreement on dependency annotations from a 114- sentence subset of the treebank which was annotated by two annotators. Following earlier literature (Berzak et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018; Bhat et al. 2018), we report unlabelled attachment agreement (UAA), where annotators agree on the head attachment, labelled attachment agreement (LAA), where annotators agree on the head attachment and its label, and label agreement (LA). Since it is difficult to determine the probability of chance agreement for dependencies, there is no agreed method to calculate chance-corrected IAA scores on UAA and LAA. As a result, we report only raw scores for all metrics, as well as Cohen\u2019s kappa (Cohen 1960) for label agreement. Table 1 shows the agreement scores.\nCS treebanking is recent and reported IAA scores vary. On one hand, Seddah et al. (2020) do not give actual scores but imply they are low as a result of task difficulty and language variability among annotators. On the other hand Bhat et al. (2018) give agreements over 90%; perhaps having annotators with 10 years of experience helped achieve these high scores. Our scores are in the same range as that of Braggaar and van der Goot (2021). We attribute these medium-level scores to the tasks difficulty as well as to calculating them between a newly trained annotator and an experienced annotator after guideline changes due to new versions of UD treebanks. The detailed analysis of IAA was used for improving the annotation guidelines and resolving common misunderstandings or mistakes. Although we did not calculate agreement scores for after this round, we report an analysis of corrections made as an indication of improvements after this step in the following subsection."

            "text": "Although the IAA is a useful indication of annotation quality, even a perfect IAA does not guarantee an error-free treebank. As a result, we employed a number of error detection and correction iterations. In this section we briefly discuss the methods we used.\nA first step in finding potential errors is the validation script from the Universal Dependencies project,28 which checks the well-formedness of the resulting CoNLLU files, as well as violations of UD \u2018universal\u2019 guidelines, such as allowed POS, feature and dependency labels, head-initialness of coordination or modification of certain word classes. Since some constraints on allowed tags are language-specific, we used a modified version of the script that allows labels from both languages. As an additional way to find mistakes, we used the MarkBugs feature of UDApi.\nAlthough useful, these scripts do not not catch errors that do not result in violation of the general guidelines. A stream of work on error detection on treebanks is based on detecting varied annotation of the same n-grams in different sentences in a treebank (Boyd et al. 2008). Our experiments with freely available software29 did not yield accurate detection of errors, presumably due to the multilingual nature of our treebank and/or the smaller size in comparison to the treebanks used in evaluating this method. We found an iterative approach where we semi-automatically checked for errors against our own annotation guidelines and wrote either regular expressions on CoNLL-U files, or more complex rules that make use of hierarchical relations. Figure 4 in Appendix 1 presents a snapshot of the actual items we had during the correction process. Our own checks include correct case markers for argument types, e.g., Acc for objects in German, Acc or Nom for objects in Turkish; use of clausal dependency labels (csubj, ccomp) for clausal arguments; and common mistakes of POS or dependency tags for certain lemmas.\nThe set of sentences annotated for the IAA calculations has 2106 tokens. The corrections on them resulted in 239 dependency changes (11.34%) of which 162 involves changing the head, 144 involves changing the dependency label (67 cases involving changing both) from the time IAA was calculated to the final version. Most common corrections include confusion between labels advmod and discourse, marking copulas as root mistakenly, and confusion between case and mark. Most of these are common confusions due to the UD annotation scheme. The number of mistakes is reduced as annotators gained more experience, and our annotation guidelines were improved with more examples of common confusions."

            "text": "In this paper we present our experience with creating the SAGT Turkish\u2013German code-switching treebank. The data source is conversation collections of bilingual Turkish\u2013German speakers living in Germany. The recorded conversations are first\n28 https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/tools/blob/master/validate.py. 29 https://github.com/adrianeboyd/decca.\nannotated with sentence and code-switching boundaries (hence language IDs). Sentences that include intrasentential and intra-word CS are transcribed following common conventions for speech corpora. A parallel transcription layer is added to also provide a normalised version following standard orthography of both languages. The normalised transcriptions are then annotated with lemmas, POS tags, morphological features, and dependency relations.\nIn annotations, we follow the general UD guidelines, and earlier Turkish and German UD treebanks. When we encounter new monolingual or bilingual syntactic constructions we apply existing relations to these new conditions; if not sufficient, we introduce a subtype. Due to annotating spoken data, our sentences contain dependencies that are rare or nonexistent in monolingual Turkish and German treebanks. For those cases also, we follow general UD guidelines and other spoken UD treebanks.\nOur observations suggest that annotating a code-switching treebank comes together with several interesting phenomena and their challenges. For instance, in seemingly simple case of annotating titles, there is a conflict among general guidelines, Turkish treebanks, and German treebanks. Choosing any one of the options has its own advantages or disadvantages. As another example, double case marking is an issue that has been observed first in our treebank and so far does not have an ideal solution within the UD framework. Nevertheless, UD is an evolving framework that seeks solutions to challenges. The diverse set of languages increasing at every release and the active community help achieve this goal. As the UD itself evolves and we interact with the community, our treebank is bound to improve. While the maintenance and updates of the treebank continues, our main focus from this point on is to use the treebank as a resource for computational studies.30\nThe treebank is publicly available since the UD 2.7 data release. At the time of the writing, the latest published version is UD 2.8.31 The audio files of the transcriptions are also available for research purposes via a licence agreement as audio recordings are considered personal data and subject to EU data privacy regulations.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to the reviewers for their valuable comments.
