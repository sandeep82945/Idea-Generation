    "abstractText": "Background: Older patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), particularly those with no or one cytopenia and no transfusion dependence, typically have an indolent course. Approximately, half of these receive the recommended diagnostic evaluation (DE) for MDS. We explored factors determining DE in these patients and its impact on subsequent treatment and outcomes. Patients and Methods: We used 2011-2014 Medicare data to identify patients \u226566 years of age diagnosed with MDS. We used Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis to identify combinations of factors associated with DE and its impact on subsequent treatment. Variables examined included demographics, comorbidities, nursing home status, and investigative procedures performed. We conducted a logistic regression analysis to identify correlates associated with receipt of DE and treatment. Results: Of 16 851 patients with MDS, 51% underwent DE. patients with MDS with no cytopenia (n = 3908) had the lowest uptake of DE (34.7%). Compared to patients with no cytopenia, those with any cytopenia had nearly 3 times higher odds of receiving DE [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.81: 95% CI, 2.60-3.04] and the odds were higher for men than for women [AOR, 1.39: 95%CI, 1.30-1.48] and for Non-Hispanic Whites [vs. everyone else (AOR, 1.17: 95% CI, 1.06-1.29)]. The CART showed DE as the principal discriminating node, followed by the presence of any cytopenia for receiving MDS treatment. The lowest percentage of treatment was observed in patients without DE, at 14.6%. Conclusion: In this select older patients with MDS, we identified disparities in accurate diagnosis by demographic and clinical factors. Receipt of DE influenced subsequent treatment but not survival.",

Use of DE as recommended by clinical practice guidelines is low in these patients at approximately 50%. While receipt of proper DE favored receiving MDS treatment, it does not appear to improve survival. In the absence of any clinical benefit beyond establishing diagnosis, DE for all patients presenting with no or one cytopenia and no transfusion dependence who are presumed to be MDS may be deemed as low-value care and can be safely deferred in most of these patients.\nic.oup.com /oncolo/article/28/10/901/7147286 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\ndata evaluating low-value care in patients with hematological malignancies.18\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common myeloid malignancy in the US with 86% of cases diagnosed in individuals >60 years of age and highest incidence in those \u226580 years.19-21 MDS represents a heterogeneous collection of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in peripheral cytopenias of varying severity and an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Approximately 70%-80% of patients with MDS belong to the lower-risk categories as determined by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and IPSS-revised (IPSS-R).22,23 Anemia is the most common cytopenia in lower-risk MDS with approximately 60% of patients\u2019 transfusion independent at diagnosis.24 For lower-risk patients with MDS, treatment options vary ranging from active surveillance in those who are asymptomatic to supportive care including transfusions and growth factors in those with cytopenia-related symptoms.\nIn this study, we specifically focused on patients with MDS with isolated or no cytopenia and no transfusion dependence as a disease cohort with highest likelihood of identifying low-value care for several reasons. First, the vast majority of patients with MDS are older, a demographic cohort in the US where low-value care is especially prevalent across the entire spectrum of health care encompassing diagnostic testing, procedures, imaging, cancer screening, and medication use.1 Second, our preliminary analyses in Medicare beneficiaries revealed that MDS-specific diagnostic evaluation (DE) was performed in approximately half of reported patients with MDS,25 raising questions about the diagnostic certainty in those who did not undergo DE. Lastly, for this select cohort of patients\u2019 with MDS, watchful expectancy is typically recommended as there is no evidence that early treatment of asymptomatic lower-risk MDS improves long-term survival. Taking these factors into consideration, the primary objective of this study was to describe low-value care in MDS population with no or one cytopenia and no transfusion dependence by addressing 2 key questions\u2014which demographic and clinical factors if any were associated with receipt or non-receipt of\nDE, and whether receipt of DE influenced treatment decision and survival."

            "text": "We used Medicare enrollment and claims data spanning the 2011-2014 period. The Medicare Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) includes demographic information (age, race, and sex), comorbidities, county of residence, and monthly indicators for enrollment in each of the managed care programs and Part D plans among others. The Medicare data include the Medicare Provider, Analysis, and Review (MedPAR) file, which includes data on hospitalizations; the Outpatient Standard Analytic File (SAF) for services received in outpatient hospital settings; the Carrier SAF for services in outpatient non-institutional settings; durable medical equipment (DME) files for injectable therapies; and Part D data for oral medications. Non-pharmacy claims carry dates of service, as well as diagnosis and procedure codes, which were used to identify MDS cases, as well as the clinical variables and injectable therapies received by the study subjects. Pharmacy data were used to identify prescriptions for oral medications that were filled. This study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Reserve University Institutional Review Board and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Privacy Board.\nOur study population consisted of fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries 66 years of age or older with at least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient claims with MDS diagnosis within a 12-month period during the years 2012-2013 (Fig. 1). MDS were flagged based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes that have been in use following code change after October 2006 (Supplementary Table S1). Our inclusion criterion of age \u226566 years was to ensure that we had at least a 1-year look-back period. We used the first date of MDS diagnosis in the 2012-2013 period as the index date of diagnosis (IDD). By extending our search period to 2014, we were able to identify services received for up to 36 months following the IDD. We limited our study cohort to patients with MDS who\nFigure 1.

In the race and ethnicity category \u201cAll Others,\u201d 57% were Blacks and the remaining included all other groups. We examined several explanatory variables closest to the IDD that included indicators for the presence or absence of various conditions that may have provided a clinical context for or justified performing DE. These included the number of comorbid conditions (0-4, or \u22655) as assessed by the Elixhauser comorbidity criteria; nursing home status26; prior history of cancers; gastrointestinal bleeding; and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, in the absence of such diagnosis codes, and since anemia is the most common presenting cytopenia in MDS,24 we identified the use of procedures, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, and therapies such as erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), indicating the need to investigate or treat anemia. We further examined the transfusion burden at 6 months and 1 year, use of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and lenalidomide, progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and survival following MDS diagnosis. The definition of the above measures, along with the diagnosis, and procedure codes used to identify them are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.\nOur primary outcome of interest was receipt of DE. Secondary outcome measures included determinants of MDS treatment and survival. We defined DE based on a claimsbased methodology that required the presence of ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for MDS with any combination of the following diagnostic tests or procedures\u2014bone marrow (BM) biopsy, fluorescent in situ hybridization, chromosomal analysis, peripheral blood smear, and flow cytometry, within 1-year preceding or following the IDD. To identify specific combinations of patient and clinical characteristics that were associated with high (and low) probability of the receipt of DE and additionally, to identify determinants of treatment received, we used the classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. CART is a non-parametric, machine learning method that repeatedly splits the data into binary partitions based on the values of explanatory variables so that each partition corresponds to as homogenous outcome as possible. Branches of the tree that did not significantly improve the model as measured by Akaike information criterion were removed to reduce model complexity. To produce reliable results, we limited the maximum depth of the tree to 6 and the minimum number of patients for each end node to 100. Each \u201cpath\u201d in the tree ends with a terminal node that shows the percentage of patients with MDS with a specific combination of demographic and clinical characteristics who received DE. Multivariable logistic regression models were then used to identify demographic and clinical factors that were significantly associated with receiving DE and MDS treatments. For both CART and logistic models, we excluded patients with MDS with end-stage renal disease from analyses to avoid confounding as these patients are typically anemic and receive ESA therapy. For the logistic model predicting receipt of MDS treatment, we excluded patients who were on ESA prior to IDD. We used the Kaplan-Meier estimate to compare the\nsurvivorship between the patients with and without DE at different time frames. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to identify any association between receipt of DE with survival after adjusting for all variables of interest. We used SAS v 9.4 for data management and R version 3.6.3 for statistical analyses."

The comparison of the patients between those who did and did not receive DE revealed significant demographic and clinical differences (Table 1). Compared to the no DE group, patients in the DE group were younger (53.4% vs. 42.7% in the 66-79 age group); included fewer women (46.0% vs. 54.2%); had a higher proportion with any cytopenia (84.1% vs. 69.3%); had a lower proportion residing in a nursing home within 6 months prior to MDS diagnosis (4.8% vs. 7.9%); had a higher proportion with history of previous cancers (16.9% vs. 12.9%); had a higher proportion diagnosed with AML in the year following MDS diagnosis (4.7% vs. 0.5%); or received any treatment for MDS, including ESA, HMAs, or lenalidomide. Approximately 37% of patients with MDS received any MDS treatment. Overall, ESA accounted for 87% of all therapies received whereas the percentage of patients receiving HMAs or lenalidomide was <10%. Higher proportion of patients in the DE group than in the no DE group developed transfusion dependence in the 6 months (7.2% vs. 3.4%) and at 1 year (10.1% vs. 4.0%) following the IDD. High comorbidity burden, defined by \u22655 Elixhauser comorbid conditions was comparable in the 2 groups (33.6% in the DE group vs. 34.2% in the no DE group). Lastly, in analyzing receipt of various procedures to investigate the etiology of anemia, we noted a significantly higher percentage of patients in the DE than in the no DE group undergoing colonoscopy (16.5% vs. 9.0%), EGD (16.6% vs. 9.5%), or with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding (9.2% vs. 7.1%).\nThe results of the CART analysis in Fig. 2 show a specific combination of characteristics that identified transfusion independent MDS cohorts with higher or lower levels of DE. The principal discriminating node in the decision tree for determining receipt of DE was the presence of any one cytopenia. The MDS cohort (n = 1555) that included patients who presented with any cytopenia, no prior ESA therapy, and underwent colonoscopy (nodes 1, 3, 9, and 15) had the highest proportion of DE (73.3%). Two largest MDS cohorts (combined n = 8904) that had > 50% of patients receiving DE had the following combination of characteristics\u201462% in the group with any cytopenia, no prior ESA, no colonoscopy, and between the ages of 66 and 79 years (nodes 1, 3, 9, 10, and 14); and 53.5% in the group with similar characteristics as in the prior group but older (\u226580 years) and not resident of nursing home (nodes 1, 3, 9, 10, 11, and 13). In the group of 3904 patients who had no cytopenia, 34.7% received DE in the absence of a clinical context that would provide a justification for DE. Another group in which it may be difficult to support the decision to perform DE consisted of patients with one cytopenia, on ESA therapy prior to MDS diagnosis and \u226580 years (nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5). Next, we proceeded with conducting logistic regression analysis to identify correlates of undergoing DE (Table 2). Findings from the logistic\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /oncolo/article/28/10/901/7147286 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nmodel indicated that being \u226580 years of age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64-0.73)], having been admitted to a nursing home (AOR, 0.64: 95%CI, 0.56-0.74), ESA use prior to MDS diagnosis (AOR, 0.46: 95%CI, 0.41-0.51), and CKD (AOR, 0.79: 95%CI, 0.74-0.85) were associated with lower odds of undergoing DE. The presence of any one cytopenia had the highest odds of receiving DE (AOR, 2.81: 95% CI, 2.60-3.04). Other factors associated with higher odds of receiving DE included male sex (AOR, 1.39: 95%CI,\n1.30-1.48); NHW (AOR, 1.17: 95% CI, 1.06-1.29), history of previous cancer (AOR, 1.39: 95% CI, 1.27-1.52), receipt of EGD (AOR, 1.44: 95% CI, 1.29-1.62), and receipt of colonoscopy (AOR, 1.50: 95% CI, 1.34-1.69).\nWe additionally performed a CART analysis to identify a specific combination of characteristics that were associated with receipt of MDS therapies (Fig. 3). The principal discriminating node in the CART treatment decision tree was receipt of DE and next in importance was the presence of any cytopenia. Of 6983 patients who did not undergo DE (47.3% of analyzed cohort), 14.6% received MDS treatment (nodes 1 and 2). Of 1332 patients who underwent DE but had no cytopenia, 20.5% received treatment (nodes 1, 3, and 4). In patients who underwent DE and had one cytopenia, CART partitioned the data based on whether these patients underwent EGD. In the group of 5295 patients who did not receive EGD (35.8% of analyzed cohort), 42.8% received treatment (nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6), whereas in 1115 patients who received EGD (7.5% of analyzed cohort), the proportion of treated patients ranged from 45% to 55% in cohorts selected by receipt of colonoscopy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and comorbidities. However, the absolute number of patients receiving treatment in all EGD cohorts combined was low at 578 (3.9% of analyzed cohort). We then performed logistic regression analysis to determine variables that predicted receipt of MDS treatment (Table 3). Patients with any cytopenia had the highest odds of receiving treatment (AOR, 4.0: 95% CI, 3.57-4.53). Other factors associated with higher odds of receiving treatment were receipt of DE (AOR, 3.34: 95% CI, 3.07-3.63), \u226580 years of age [AOR, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.07-1.25)], history of previous cancer [AOR, 1.25: 95% CI, 1.12-1.39), CKD (AOR, 1.22: 95%CI, 1.12-1.33), and receipt of EGD (AOR, 1.32: 95% CI, 1.16-1.50).

First, we observed no clear patterns in clinical decision-making regarding DE in these patients. In the cohort of patients with no cytopenia and not transfusion dependent (23% of study cohort), a condition where index of suspicion for MDS is typically low, a third received DE for MDS for reasons that remain unclear. While the presence of any cytopenia favored DE, we observed considerable heterogeneity in diagnostic techniques used for confirmation of MDS (Supplementary Table S4).

Inability to meet the minimal diagnostic criteria for MDS in absence of a BM biopsy in most patients identified with MDS in this Medicare cohort highlights poor adherence to the clinical practice guidelines in routine clinical care.27,30-32 Of note, approximately 1 in 5 (18.1%) patients underwent DE without presenting diagnoses, procedures, or therapies that may have supported the clinical decision to perform DE. Second, we found disparities in receipt of DE for MDS by age, race/ ethnicity, and sex. Third, higher proportion of patients in DE group compared to non-DE group went on to receive subsequent MDS treatment indicating that DE may have a gatekeeper effect in making treatment decisions. We show no survival benefit in patients who underwent DE compared to those who did not after adjusting for pre- and post-diagnosis prognostic variables. Importantly, DE apart from potentially confirming MDS diagnosis, did not appear to yield useful information to guide clinical management and improve outcomes in majority of these patients.\nConsidering that patients with MDS in this study had 0 or 1 cytopenia, remained transfusion independent up to a year following diagnosis (\u226590%) with low rates of disease progression (<5% with AML at 1-year follow up) and a 1-year survival rate of 90%\u2014this clinical phenotype would be most consistent with very low to low-risk MDS prognostic categories (Table 1).23 Our findings raise a key fundamental question\u2014in this select MDS population with low-risk disease features, is there a clear clinical benefit to pursuing DE\nbeyond establishing MDS diagnosis or conversely, is there a harm in delaying the diagnosis of MDS. Patients with lower-risk MDS, particularly those at extremes of age with multiple comorbidities, are unlikely to receive any treatment, and in fact no treatment for these patients has ever been shown prospectively to prolong survival. In our study population where 52% were octogenarians and 35% had 5 or more comorbid conditions, we show exactly that with no improvement in survival in those who received DE compared to those who did not. Additionally, it is worth questioning whether there is a strong justification for subjecting these patients to an invasive BM biopsy. A BM biopsy although considered safe,33 is associated with pain and anxiety,34,35 and one for which pain remains undertreated.33 Moreover, morphological diagnosis can often be challenging due to poor sample quality, marked hypocellularity or extensive myelofibrosis and a high interobserver variability, with up to 30%-40% disagreement in diagnosis.36-38 On the other hand, without a BM biopsy the timely diagnosis of high-risk MDS, AML, or other myeloid neoplasm with adverse outcome implications might be delayed, but our results suggest otherwise. Compared to the non-DE group, a higher proportion of patients in the DE cohort received treatment with HMA (6.9% vs. 0.4%) and a higher proportion progressed to AML in 1-year (4.7% vs. 0.5%), suggesting that DE probably led to the identification of high-risk disease features. However, these patients comprised a small proportion of the entire cohort (5%-7%). For the rest of the patients, the 3-year survival in both the DE and non-DE groups were comparable at ~65%, indicating that the tradeoff of not pursuing DE did not necessarily lead to adverse consequences. More reassuring data comes from a recent large Dutch study that looked at the natural history of peripheral cytopenia in 152 180 individuals and reported a low risk of developing any hematological malignancy [0.19% (95% CI, 0.17-0.21)] at 5 years with majority\nFigure 4. Kaplan-Meier survival curves by receipt of diagnostic evaluation in older patients with MDS.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /oncolo/article/28/10/901/7147286 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nof deaths attributable to causes other than diagnosed hematological malignancies.39\nOur findings also identified the presence of disparities by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, if and when administering DE may have been considered beneficial to the patient. When holding all other factors constant, we observed higher odds of receiving DE among NHW males between the ages of 66-79 years. Factors like older age (\u226580), higher comorbidity burden (\u22655 comorbidities), and nursing home stay were reassuringly associated with lower odds of undergoing DE. The decision to forgo DE in these older adults probably includes several factors, including patient preference; physician concerns for poor tolerance; prohibitive comorbidity or frailty; and, at times, ageism. Applying the similar clinical rationale on a broader scale to the entire MDS cohort in this study, one can argue that 49% of the MDS cohort who did not undergo DE (despite the caveat of an erroneous diagnosis) probably received appropriate care based on the observed outcomes.\nConsidering the indolent course of majority of clinically low-risk MDS patients in this study, a mandatory DE particularly BM biopsy in all older patients with 0 or 1 cytopenia and transfusion independence meets the definition of low-value care from a clinical benefit perspective and may likely result in a cascade of additional potentially unnecessary tests (ie, repeated marrow evaluations, frequent blood count monitoring), treatments, and associated supportive care. This is particularly pertinent as healthcare costs for patients with MDS exceed the comparable costs for the 18 most prevalent cancer types during the first 5 years post-diagnosis40-42 and have not been shown to be associated with survival.43 The costs of care associated with DE for MDS should not be considered in isolation but should include costs incurred from subsequent downstream tests and related treatment. Two recent studies provide a framework on how best to evaluate these patients non-invasively when referred for primary workup of unexplained cytopenia suspected to be MDS\u2014 combining mutational status obtained using next generation sequencing on peripheral blood with clinical variables44 and second, an algorithm developed by European MDS registry using data of 10 readily available parameters (age, sex, blood counts, and lab biochemistry)45 In light of these observations, our findings suggest adopting a tiered approach of DE for MDS in transfusion-independent patients presenting with one peripheral cytopenia. A reasonable strategy could be watchful waiting and reserving BM biopsy or additional DE procedures in certain circumstances such as patient preference, clonal cytopenia, detection of peripheral circulating blasts, worsening cytopenia or additional cytopenias, and onset of transfusion dependency.\nThe strengths of our study include a large nationally representative study population, representing 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with MDS diagnosis, during our study period. In addition, we examined diagnoses, procedures, and therapeutics both retrospectively and prospectively to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the clinical context in which patients received DE. Lastly, we employed machine learning techniques to identify empirically emerging combinations of factors\u2014rather than one factor at a time\u2014associated with DE and receipt of treatment. Our findings should be interpreted acknowledging the inherent limitations in claims dataset. First, the lack of clinical details in claims data may have limited our ability to fully capture patients\u2019 medical history and the rationale\nto pursue DE. To account for this, we expanded our search of diagnosis and procedure codes\u2014before and after MDS diagnosis\u2014to provide as full of a clinical context as possible for DE to ensure that these tests were not performed to rule out a certain condition. Second, while follow-up was short (up to 36 months) in our analysis, we do not believe that DE would change outcome even with prolonged follow-up as expected lifespan of this cohort would likely be truncated by old age or competing intercurrent illness. Third, the retrospective nature of this study precludes us from accounting for contemporaneous factors driving clinical decisions. To overcome this limitation, we examined the receipt of blood transfusions and MDS-specific treatments downstream, subsequent development of AML, as well as survival. It is likely that some, but not all cases in which we interpreted DE was based on factors too subtle to have been picked up by our analyses."

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically describe patterns and disparities in DE of MDS and its impact on treatment received in patients with MDS with low-risk disease features. Based on inclusion of clinical benefit in lowvalue care framework,1 we are however unable to assert the effectiveness of DE in most of our study population that is representative of lower-risk MDS, especially given the lack of survival benefit. Based on the findings, the current practice of DE and management of patients with MDS with low-risk disease features in the routine clinical practice represents lowvalue care."
