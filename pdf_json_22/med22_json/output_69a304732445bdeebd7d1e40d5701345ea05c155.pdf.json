    "abstractText": "The biogenic aliphatic polyamines (spermine, spermidine, and putrescine) are responsible for numerous cell functions, including cell proliferation, the stabilization of nucleic acid conformations, cell division, homeostasis, gene expression, and protein synthesis in living organisms. The change of polyamine concentrations in the urine or blood is usually related to the presence of malignant tumors and is regarded as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of cancer. Therefore, the detection of polyamine levels in physiological fluids can provide valuable information in terms of cancer diagnosis and in monitoring therapeutic effects. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in fluorescent methods for polyamine detection (supramolecular fluorescent sensing systems, fluorescent probes based on the chromophore reaction, fluorescent small molecules, and fluorescent nanoparticles). In addition, tumor polyamine-suppressing strategies (such as polyamine conjugate, polyamine analogs, combinations that target multiple components, spermine-responsive supramolecular chemotherapy, a combination of polyamine consumption and photodynamic therapy, etc.) are highlighted. We hope that this review promotes the development of more efficient polyamine detection methods and provides a comprehensive understanding of polyamine-based tumor suppressor strategies.",

The homologs of polyamines (such as cadaverine, norspemine, homospemidine, and thermospermine) at lower concentrations play a less significant role [2]. The total number of polyamines found in living systems is on the millimole level, but the concentration of free polyamines is relatively even lower because cationic polyamines are usually bound to anionic nucleic acids, proteins or phospholipids, DNA, RNA, proteins, etc. [3]. Polyamines at appropriate concentrations play several positive roles in many metabolic processes [4]. Under physiological conditions, polyamines can prevent the denaturation of DNA and stabilize the structure of nucleic acid [5]. Moreover, they participate in catalysis and the controlled biosynthesis of nucleic acids [6]. Some results indicate that the synthesis of DNA is stimulated by spermidine [7]. In addition, polyamines are responsible for cell growth, differentiation, gene regulation, cell division, homeostasis, ion channel function, protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, and other biological functions [8,9]. The level of polyamine concentrations is regulated by several key enzymes of synthesis and catabolism [10,11].\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12080633

(a) Chemical structures of polyamines and their homologs. (b) A cartoon diagram of the polyamine fluorescence detection and polyamine suppression strategy in tumor treatment.\nHowever, an excess accumulation of polyamines may lead to apoptosis and various allergic disorders [12]. Some researchers reveal that the rapid proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells are dependent on the intracellular polyamines\u2019 concentrations [13,14]. Due to their high demand for polyamines, tumor cells have to uptake a large number of polyamines from the extracellular matrix to maintain their rapid growth, resulting in a much higher level of polyamines in tumor cells than is found in normal cells [15]. The levels of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in blood samples in cancer patients are significantly higher than those found in healthy people [16]. Therefore, a high level of polyamines is regarded as a biomarker for the timely diagnosis of cancer in certain tumors [17]. For this reason, it is important to detect and monitor non-bonded intracellular polyamines. Since the regulation of biosynthesis and catabolism of polyamines is particularly important, there is an urgent need to develop chemotherapeutic drugs to inhibit tumor\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633 3 of 19\nproliferation, differentiation, or metastasis [18]. For example, the biological pathways for inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis, activating polyamine catabolism, and blocking polyamine transport have been investigated. Likewise, new anti-cancer therapies, such as supramolecular chemotherapy, using polyamine conjugates to interfere with DNA function, and irreversible chemical reactions that consume polyamines have received scientific attention. Fluorescence-sensing technology offers numerous outstanding advantages, such as high sensitivity, simple operation, a fast response speed, low cost, real-time visualization, and non-destructive monitoring. This review summarizes the most recent advances in polyamines detection based on the fluorescence method (a supramolecular sensing system, chromophore reaction-based fluorescent probes, fluorescent small molecules, and fluorescent nanoparticles). The tumor suppressor strategy related to polyamines (such as polyamine conjugates, polyamine analogs, combinations that target multiple components, spermine-responsive supramolecular chemotherapy, a combination of polyamine consumption and photodynamic therapy, etc.) is highlighted (Figure 1). We believe that this review will provide a deep understanding and offer important guidance for the design and development of polyamine-based detection methods and antitumor drugs."

However, some drawbacks such as low selectivity, expensive equipment costs, the need for professional staff, and complicated sample pre-treatment requirements are frequently encountered. On the other hand, fluorescence-sensing technology has attracted more and more attention in the field of polyamine detection, due to its high sensitivity, simple operation, fast response speed, low cost, real-time visualization, and non-destructive monitoring. Therefore, we focus on fluorescent methods for polyamine detection in this review. Scheme 1 shows the roadmap for polyamine monitoring methods.

            "text": "Recently, spermine detection, based on a supramolecular strategy, has received more scientific attention due to the strong complexation ability between the macrocyclic host and spermine [41]. In some cases, the modulation of the supramolecular system\u2019s morphologies by spermine yielded obvious fluorescence signals [42]. By the use of the multi-cationic character of tetracationic spermine (pKa = 11.50, 10.95, 9.79, 8.90) and tricationic spermidine (pKa = 11.56, 10.80, 9.52), the generation of emissive excimers was investigated for the se-\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633 4 of 19\nlective detection of spermine and spermidine [43]. Besides these strategies, the competitive binding induced by spermine is a widely utilized sensing mechanism [44\u201347]. The water-soluble cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) was selected as a popular host because of its strong binding ability toward polyamines. The highly emissive \u201cdumbbell-shape\u201d supraamphiphiles, based on perylene diimides (compound 1) and CB[7], were utilized as a supramolecular sensor for the fast and ultra-sensitive detection of spermine [44]. Due to its high affinity with CB[7], spermine can preferably bind to CB[7] (binding constant K = 2.6 \u00d7 107 M\u22121), leading to the dissociation of the supra-amphiphiles and generating fluorescence quenching. The supraamphiphiles showed good selectivity for spermine over other structural analogs (spermidine, putrescine, L-arginine, L-lysine, etc.). This high sensitivity was maintained even in the presence of a low concentration of spermine (about 10 nM) (Figure 2).\nBiosensors\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 20\u00a0 \u00a0 Fluorescence analysis for detecting food quality and PA content in biological samples mid-late stage late stage LC-MS , ADA ,LC-MS and HPLC for PA detection in urine, blood And saliva ELISA for the monitoring of PA in the urine of cancer patients.

Upon complexation with CB[7] via host\u2013guest interaction, a fluorescent supramolecular system was formed [45]. The binding constant between 2 and CB[7] was found to be 3.77 \u00d7 104, 2.22 \u00d7 104, and 2.86 \u00d7 104 M\u22121 at a pH of 3.0, 7.0, and 10.0, respectively.

In this case, compound 3 spontaneously interacted with HAp NPs by electrostatic interaction and with CB[7] via host\u2013guest interaction. As a result, a three-component supramolecular system showed strong emissions at 615 nm (Figure 4). Spermine showed a higher binding ability to CB[7] than compound 3, leading to a higher binding constant (2.6 \u00d7 107 M\u22121 for spermineCB[7] vs. 5.6 \u00d7 104 M\u22121 for 3-CB[7]).

benzimidazolium platform and ciprofloxacin-Tb3+\nc l were developed for selective spermine detection with the fluorescenc quenching response [48,49]. Guo et al. designed a upramolecul r assembly of an amphiphilic sulfocalix[5]arene (SC5A12C) with lucigenin (LCG) via host\u2013guest interaction [50]. The fluo esce ce of LCG was quenched due to the strong binding capacity between SC5A12C and LCG. In the presence of over x r ssed spermine in cancer cells, the fluor scence was fully recovered due to the mpetition complex b tween spermin and SC5A12C. Coassembled folate further promoted the cellular uptake by folate rece tor-overexpressing cancer cells. Yang\u2019s group reported polyamine detection, based on pyrene excimer fluorescence, through the synergistic/competitive complexation among pyrene compounds (5), polyamines, \u03b3-cyclodextrins (\u03b3-CD), and CB[7] [51]. In this case, \u03b3-CD accommodated compound 5 with binding constants of 5 \u00d7 106 M\u22121 for 1:2 binding modes, leading to the excimer emission of pyrene. Since a 1:1 host\u2013guest complexation between 5 and CB[7] was identified, the ad-\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633 6 of 19\ndition of CB[7] yielded a decrease in the excimer fluorescence, accompanied by an increase in monomer fluorescence. On the other hand, polyamines can bind strongly to CB[7]. For example, spermine showed an association constant two orders higher of 1.28 \u00d7 106 M\u22121 than that of pyrene. The addition of urinary polyamines to a three-component supramolecular system (5, \u03b3-CD, and CB[7]) competitively captured CB[7] and formed a complex of \u03b3-CD-5 at 1:2 binding, enabling the recovery of the excimer fluorescence (Figure 6).

            "text": "The chromophore-reaction-based fluorescent probes possess great advantages, such as a high selectivi y to analytes and synchron us colorimetric and fluorescence changes [52\u201357]. Recently, we reported a series of pyrrolo e aza-BODIPY (PPAB)-based fluorescent pr bes for lyamine detection, wherein the chromop ore reaction-sensi g mechanism was i volved [58\u201361]. For instance, three PPAB dyes (4a\u20134c) showed high selectivity and sensitivity toward p ly mines by colorimetric changes from green to yellow and a fluorescent turn-on process [62]. There was a hypsoc romic shift over 225 nm in the absorption maximu and a 12-fold fluorescence enhancement. The detection mechanism study revealed a B\u2013N bond cleavage, and a transamination and hydrolysis reaction was involved that generated much smaller conjugated molecules. More interestingly, the limit of detection up to ppb level and the response time on the second timescale were demonstrated (Figure 7). It is important to improve the reaction rate between fluorescent probes and polyamines. We designed and synthesized a lactam-fused aza-BODIPY (compound 7), which contained fewer cleaved imine and B\u2013N functional groups [63]. The presence of spermidine and spermine induced an obvious color change from pink to yellow (130 nm hypsochromic shift of the absorption peak) and a 99% fluorescence \u201cturn-off\u201d response within 1 minute. Other amines failed to yield the same optical phenomenon. The high pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) of 15.67 \u00d7 10\u22123 S\u22121 and 8.99 \u00d7 10\u22123 S\u22121 for spermine and spermidine were present, respectively. A similar proposed sensing mechanism was involved through the B\u2013N bond cleavage and hydrolysis reaction, to yield much smaller conjugated molecules (Figure 8). The aza-Michael addition reaction between \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated nitrile and primary amines can proceed smoothly under mild conditions. The pyrrolopyrrole cyanine dye (8) contained \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated nitrile as Michael acceptors, which was further appended with a withdrawing boron atom to enhance the aza-Michael addition reactivity [64]. Through this strategy, a highly efficient fluorescent polyamine probe was developed. Compound 8 showed 158-fold higher kobs with putrescine than compound 6a. As an efficient chromophore reaction-based probe for polyamine detection, the synergistic aza-Michael addition, B\u2013N detachment, and\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633 7 of 19\nhydrolysis reaction were involved between compound 8 and polyamines. The resulting low-conjugated product generated synchronous colorimetric and fluorescence changes (\u2206\u03bbab = 188 nm and \u2206\u03bbem = 151 nm).

The multi-cationic spermine and spermidine easily formed a complex with compound 9 by electrostatic- and hydrogen-bonding interactions at the physiological pH. As a result, a distinct emission enhancement at 473 nm (60- and 80-fold increase for spermine\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633 8 of 19\nand spermidine, respectively) was shown because the restricted intramolecular rotations of compound 9 played a positive role.

The sensing mechanism was ascribed to aggregation-induced fluorescence enhancement via electrostatic pairing and hydrogen bonding. For instance, the fluorescence intensity of compound 10 gave a 75-fold fluorescence enhancement at 480 nm upon the addition of 40 \u00b5M spermine. The detection limit regarding spermine was found to be 0.3 \u00b5M. The practical application for spermine detection in artificial urine was demonstrated (Figure 10)."

            "text": "A dual emissive nanoprobe was prepared from the combination of yellow emissive mercaptopropionic acid-capped CdTe quantum dots (YQDs) and blue emissive carbon dots (BCDs), wherein the former and the latter were employed as sensing and reference fluorophores, respectively [67]. Since spermine or spermidine could dramatically quench the fluorescence of YQDs (\u03bbem = 570 nm) but did not affect the emission of BCDs (\u03bbem = 450 nm), the presence of spermine or spermidine induced a decrease in the I570/I450 ratio. As a result, the green emission turned into a pink emission with the increase of spermine or spermidine, to yield a ratiometric signal. The low limits of detection were found to be 0.2 \u00b5M for spermine and 2.1 \u00b5M for spermidine, respectively. By using this sensing mechanism, a combinational logic-gate fluorescence sensor was achieved. Gluconate-stabilized AuNPs (Glu-AuNPs) possessed an anionic character, which was utilized as a nanosensor for selectively detecting spermine in urine sa ples [68]. In the presence of spermine, the absorption ban at 518 nm gradually red-shifted to 618 nm t r tion, generating an obvious c lor change from pinkish-red to blue. The str i tion betw en spermine and Glu-AuNPs was confirmed via its high binding c 106 \u22121). The rati of A618/A518 showed a good lin ar relationship with s centration. The LOD value was alculated to be 0.25 \u00b5M.

Since host\u2013guest interactions between the polyamines and the MOFs were involved, the donor-acceptor electron transfer process from polyamines to MOFs generated photoinduced electron transfer (PET), leading to fluorescence quenching.\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633 9 of 19\nPutrescine has higher HOMO energy levels than spermidine and putrescine (\u22124.81 vs. \u22124.96, \u22125.01 eV). The higher the energy difference between the HOMO energy levels of MOFs (\u22125.91 eV) and putrescine, the more effective the PET process. Thus, in terms of the lowest limit of detection (LOD) values (0.24 \u00b5M) for putrescine rather than the LOD for spermine, spermidine was shown."

            "text": "Several tumor polyamine-suppressing strategies have been developed, as follows. (1) Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) are important for polyamine synthesis [70]. The \u03b1-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), which acts as an irreversible suicide inhibitor of ODC, has been used to prevent and treat multiple cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, lung carcinoma, neuroblastoma, endometrial cancer, and osteosarcoma [71]. (2) Highly regulated catabolic pathways are utilized to control the intracellular polyamine pool. The modulation of the polyamine catabolic enzyme produces decreasing polyamine content and induces the generation of toxic compounds. (3) Some inhibitors targeting the polyamine transport system (PTS) can hinder polyamine import and antagonize polyamine uptake. (4) Synthetic polyamines, including polyamine analogs and polyamine conjugates, possess anticancer activity against tumor cells.\n3.1. Small Molecules Target Polyamine Metabolism 3.1.1. Polyamine Analogs\nAs potential antitumor drugs, polyamine analogs have a similar structure to natural polyamines but cannot be functionally substituted for them. That means that polyamine analogs can compete with natural polyamines, can enter cells through polyamine transport channels, which down-regulates the activities of various polyamine synthases, and can promote polyamine catabolism. In this way, the intracellular content of natural polyamines is depleted by inhibiting biosynthesis and inducing catabolism. For example, propylenediamine-based polyamine analogs and bis(ethyl)spermine analogs (11a\u201311f, Figure 11) were synthesized to inhibit the ODC activity and growth of tumor cells [72,73].\nBiosensors\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 20\u00a0 \u00a0\nspermidine,\u00a0or\u00a0putrescine\u00a0[69].\u00a0Since\u00a0host\u2013guest\u00a0interactions\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0polyamines\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0MOFs\u00a0were\u00a0involved,\u00a0the\u00a0donor\u2010acceptor\u00a0electron\u00a0transfer\u00a0process\u00a0from\u00a0polyamines\u00a0 to\u00a0 MOFs\u00a0 generated\u00a0 photoinduced\u00a0 electron\u00a0 transfer\u00a0 (PET),\u00a0 leading\u00a0 to\u00a0 fluorescence\u00a0 quenching.\u00a0Putrescine\u00a0has\u00a0higher\u00a0HOMO\u00a0energy\u00a0levels\u00a0than\u00a0spermidine\u00a0and\u00a0putrescine\u00a0 (\u22124.81\u00a0vs.\u00a0\u22124.96,\u00a0\u22125.01\u00a0eV).\u00a0The\u00a0higher\u00a0the\u00a0energy\u00a0difference\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0HOMO\u00a0energy\u00a0 levels\u00a0of\u00a0MOFs\u00a0 (\u22125.91\u00a0eV)\u00a0and\u00a0putrescine,\u00a0 the\u00a0more\u00a0effective\u00a0 the\u00a0PET\u00a0process.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0 in\u00a0 terms\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0limit\u00a0of\u00a0detection\u00a0(LOD)\u00a0values\u00a0(0.24\u00a0\u03bcM)\u00a0for\u00a0putrescine\u00a0rather\u00a0than\u00a0 the\u00a0LOD\u00a0for\u00a0spermine,\u00a0spermidine\u00a0was\u00a0shown.\u00a0\n3.\u00a0Tumor\u00a0Polyamine\u2010Suppressing\u00a0Strategy\u00a0 Several\u00a0tumor\u00a0polyamine\u2010suppressing\u00a0strategies\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0developed,\u00a0as\u00a0follows.\u00a0(1)\u00a0 Ornithine\u00a0decarboxylase\u00a0(ODC)\u00a0and\u00a0S\u2010adenosylmethionine\u00a0decarboxylase\u00a01\u00a0(AMD1)\u00a0are\u00a0 important\u00a0for\u00a0polyamine\u00a0synthesis\u00a0[70].\u00a0The\u00a0\u03b1\u2010difluoromethylornithine\u00a0(DFMO),\u00a0which\u00a0 acts\u00a0 as\u00a0 an\u00a0 irreversible\u00a0 suicide\u00a0 inhibitor\u00a0 of\u00a0ODC,\u00a0 has\u00a0 been\u00a0 used\u00a0 to\u00a0 prevent\u00a0 and\u00a0 treat\u00a0 multiple\u00a0 cancers,\u00a0 such\u00a0 as\u00a0 pancreatic\u00a0 cancer,\u00a0 gastric\u00a0 cancer,\u00a0 lung\u00a0 carcinoma,\u00a0 neuroblastoma,\u00a0endometrial\u00a0cancer,\u00a0and\u00a0osteosarcoma\u00a0[71].\u00a0(2)\u00a0Highly\u00a0regulated\u00a0catabolic\u00a0 pathways\u00a0are\u00a0utilized\u00a0to\u00a0control\u00a0the\u00a0intracellular\u00a0polyamine\u00a0pool.\u00a0The\u00a0modulation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 polyamine\u00a0 catabolic\u00a0 enzyme\u00a0produces\u00a0decreasing\u00a0polyamine\u00a0 content\u00a0 and\u00a0 induces\u00a0 the\u00a0 generation\u00a0of\u00a0 toxic\u00a0 compounds.\u00a0 (3)\u00a0Some\u00a0 inhibitors\u00a0 targeting\u00a0 the\u00a0polyamine\u00a0 transport\u00a0 system\u00a0 (PTS)\u00a0 can\u00a0 hinder\u00a0 polyamine\u00a0 import\u00a0 and\u00a0 a tagonize\u00a0 polyamine\u00a0 uptake.\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Synthetic\u00a0 l i s,\u00a0including\u00a0polyamine\u00a0analogs\u00a0 nd\u00a0 lyamine\u00a0conjugates,\u00a0possess\u00a0 anticancer\u00a0activity\u00a0against\u00a0tumor\u00a0cells.\u00a0\n3.1.\u00a0S all\u00a0 olec les\u00a0 arget\u00a0Polyamine\u00a0Metabolism\u00a0 3.1.1.\u00a0Polyamine\u00a0Analogs\u00a0 \u00a0\ns\u00a0potential\u00a0antitumor\u00a0drugs,\u00a0polyamine\u00a0analogs\u00a0have\u00a0a\u00a0similar\u00a0structure\u00a0to\u00a0natural\u00a0 polya ines\u00a0b t\u00a0cannot\u00a0be\u00a0functionally\u00a0substituted\u00a0for\u00a0them.\u00a0That\u00a0means\u00a0that\u00a0polyamine\u00a0 analo s\u00a0 can\u00a0 compete\u00a0 with\u00a0 natural\u00a0 polyamines,\u00a0 can\u00a0 enter\u00a0 cells\u00a0 through\u00a0 polyamine\u00a0 transport\u00a0channels,\u00a0which\u00a0down\u2010regula es\u00a0the\u00a0activities\u00a0of\u00a0various\u00a0polyamine\u00a0synth ,\u00a0\nd\u00a0can\u00a0promote\u00a0polyamine\u00a0catabolism.\u00a0In\u00a0 \u00a0 ay,\u00a0the\u00a0intracellu ar\u00a0conte \u00a0of\u00a0natur l\u00a0 polya i \u00a0i \u00a0depleted\u00a0by\u00a0inhibiting\u00a0biosynthesis\u00a0and\u00a0i ucing\u00a0 atabolism.\u00a0For\u00a0exampl ,\u00a0 pro ylenediamine\u2010based\u00a0 polyamine\u00a0 a alogs\u00a0 and\u00a0 bis(ethyl)spermine\u00a0 a alogs\u00a0 (11a\u2013 f,\u00a0 Figure\u00a01 )\u00a0 \u00a0 t esized\u00a0to\u00a0inhibit\u00a0the\u00a0ODC\u00a0activity\u00a0and\u00a0growth\u00a0of\u00a0tumor\u00a0cells\u00a0[72,73].\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a011.\u00a0Chemical\u00a0structures\u00a0of\u00a0polyamine\u00a0analogs\u00a011a\u201311f\u00a0[73].\u00a0\n3.1.2.\u00a0Polyamine\u00a0Conjugates\u00a0\nFigure 11.

The former is responsible for driving the conjugates to be transported to cancer cells by PTS, competitively inhibiting the uptake of exogenous polyamines by tumor cells. The latter can effectively embed into DNA, destroying many DNA protein interactions and interfering with their function, resulting in cell death. DNA intercalators are capable of\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633 10 of 19\nintercalating into nucleic acid base pairs. The classic intercalators include naphthalimide, flavonoids, naphthoquinone, anthraquinone, and chalcone. Some naphthalimide-polyamine conjugates significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis [74\u201376]. Xie\u2019s group [74] designed and synthesized a series of naphthalimidepolyamine conjugates (12a\u201312d, 13a\u201313c, and 14a\u201314b). They found that compound 13b exhibited stronger antitumor activity against hepatoma cells than the other compounds. Moreover, its activity was significantly higher than that of commercial antitumor drugs (amonafil and cisplatin). The mechanism of action revealed that 13b can regulate the key enzymes of polyamine metabolism with SSAT and PAO and down-regulate the concentrations of spermine, spermidine, and putrescine, thereby inhibiting the rapid growth of the tumor cells (Figure 12).\nBiosensors\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 11\u00a0 of\u00a0 20\u00a0

            "text": "3.2.1. Spermine-Responsive Supramolecular Chemotherapy\nSupramolecular chemotherapy is devoted to utilizing supramolecular approaches to reduce the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs and enhance their anticancer activity. The use of macrocyclic host molecules can encapsulate clinical anticancer drugs and reduce their toxicity to normal cells. Upon entering the polyamine multi-expression environment, the polyamine can competitively combine with the macrocyclic host, thereby causing the release of anti-tumor drug molecules. Zhang and co-workers developed supramolecular chemotherapy based on cucurbit[n]uril and an antitumor drug [85\u201387]. Upon competitive replacement by spermine, the recovery of the antitumor activities of drugs was obtained. For example, the host\u2212guest c mplex of dimethyl viologen (MV)-CB[7] was added to tumor cells with overexpressed sp rmine; subsequently, the antitu or activity of MV can be recovered by the competitive replacement of spermine [85]. When another clinical drug, oxaliplatin, was used as a model antitumor age , the ox liplatin-CB[7] complex exhibited more cooperatively enhanced antitumor activity than oxaliplatin itself (Figure 15) [86]. The cooperatively enhanced spermine consumption in tumor environments and the release of oxaliplatin were possible reasons. The supramolecular polymeric chemotherapy results were also promising. PEGfunctionalized CB[7] can encapsulate oxaliplatin to form a supramolecular polymeric complex [87]. Due to the presence of the PEG chain, the improved circulation performance of oxaliplatin was achieved. This combined effect led to enhanced cytotoxicity for tumor cells and decreased cytotoxicity for normal cells. Supramolecular chitosan nanogels (SCNs) were fabricated, based on phenylalaninegrafted chitosan and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) by stimuli-responsive host\u2212guest interactions [88]. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), a chemotherapeutic agent, was entrapped in the matrix to yield DOX-SCNs, with an excellent drug loading efficiency.

Due to the higher binding affinity between CB[7] and spermine, the nanocomplex could release DOX and enhance antitumor activity through competitive displacement in tumor microenvironments. Similarly, a heptaplatin-CB[7] supramolecular chemotherapy platform was constructed via host\u2212guest interaction for killing tumor cells [90], since overexpressed spermine competitively exchanged heptaplatin from the supramolecular platform, leading to a stronger anti-proliferative ability than heptaplatin itself. Pillar[n]arene is another popular macrocyclic host in supramolecular chemotherapy. The pillar[n]arene has a high affinity with spermine. Zhang\u2019s group reported that the carboxylated pillar[6]arene-oxaliplatin complex showed a 20% higher anticancer bioactivity than oxaliplatin itself (Figure 16) [91]. The possible mechanism was ascribed to encapsulated oxaliplatin that was released from the carboxylated pillar[6]arene-oxaliplatin complex by competitive replacement with spermine. At the same time, the cytotoxicity toward normal cells was reduced.

Compound 17 had lysosomal targeting ability, ratiometric fluorescence imaging capability, polyamine depletion, and enhanced ROS generation. This study provides an irreversible polyamine consumption strategy, which improves anticancer efficacy after being combined with PDT.\nBiosensors\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 14\u00a0 of\u00a0 20\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure\u00a016.\u00a0Supramolecular\u00a0chemotherapy,\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0host\u2013guest\u00a0complexation\u00a0between\u00a0carboxylated\u00a0 pillar[6]arene\u00a0and\u00a0oxaliplatin\u00a0[91].\u00a0\nWang\u2019s\u00a0group\u00a0reported\u00a0bispillar[5]arene\u2010paclitaxel\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0that\u00a0were\u00a0spermine\u00a0 and\u00a0 glutathione\u00a0 stimuli\u2010responsive,\u00a0 allowing\u00a0 precisely\u00a0 selective\u00a0 drug\u00a0 release\u00a0 in\u00a0 lung\u00a0 cancer\u00a0 cells\u00a0 that\u00a0 overexpress\u00a0 spermine\u00a0 and\u00a0 glutathione\u00a0 [92].\u00a0 Peptide\u2010drug\u00a0 conjugates\u00a0 show\u00a0excellent\u00a0biocompatibility\u00a0and\u00a0tunable\u00a0morphologies.\u00a0Wang\u2019s\u00a0group\u00a0developed\u00a0the\u00a0 supramolecular\u2010peptide\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0CB[7]\u00a0and\u00a0peptide\u2010camptothecin\u00a0 conjugates\u00a0by\u00a0non\u2010 covalent\u00a0 interactions\u00a0 [93].\u00a0 When\u00a0 the\u00a0 supramolecular\u2010peptide\u00a0 was\u00a0 internalized\u00a0 into\u00a0 spermine\u2010overexpressed\u00a0 cancer\u00a0 cells,\u00a0 the\u00a0 free\u00a0 peptide\u2010camptothecin\u00a0 conjugates\u00a0 were\u00a0 released\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 competitive\u00a0 binding\u00a0 of\u00a0 spermine\u00a0with\u00a0CB[7].\u00a0As\u00a0 a\u00a0 result,\u00a0 the\u00a0 drastic\u00a0 morphological\u00a0 transformation\u00a0 from\u00a0 nanoparticles\u00a0 to\u00a0microfibers\u00a0 led\u00a0 to\u00a0 an\u00a0 improved\u00a0 accumulation\u00a0and\u00a0retention\u00a0of\u00a0supramolecular\u00a0peptides\u00a0 in\u00a0tumor\u00a0cells.\u00a0The\u00a0polyamine\u2010 responsive\u00a0 \u201cnanoparticle\u2010to\u2010microfiber\u201d\u00a0 transformation\u00a0 exhibited\u00a0 a\u00a0 potential\u00a0 tumor\u00a0 therapy\u00a0 effect.\u00a0 Li\u2019s\u00a0 group\u00a0 synthesized\u00a0 a\u00a0 peptide\u2010pillar[5]arene\u00a0 conjugate\u00a0 as\u00a0 a\u00a0 supramolecular\u00a0trap,\u00a0showing\u00a0a\u00a0wide\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0antitumor\u00a0activities\u00a0[94].\u00a0\n3.2.2.\u00a0Co bination\u00a0of\u00a0Polyamine\u00a0Consumption\u00a0and\u00a0Photodynamic\u00a0Therapy\u00a0(PDT)\u00a0 Our\u00a0 group\u00a0 explored\u00a0 a\u00a0 new\u00a0 type\u00a0 of\u00a0 PPAB\u2010based\u00a0 photosensitizer\u00a0 (compound\u00a0 17),\u00a0 which\u00a0can\u00a0cooperatively\u00a0consume\u00a0polyamine\u00a0and\u00a0produce\u00a0two\u00a0photosensitizers\u00a0through\u00a0 an\u00a0 irreversible\u00a0chemical\u00a0reaction\u00a0 [95].\u00a0The\u00a0combination\u00a0of\u00a0polyamine\u00a0consumption\u00a0and\u00a0 PDT\u00a0by\u00a0synergistically\u00a0destroying\u00a0tumor\u00a0cells\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0promising\u00a0polyamine\u00a0consumption\u00a0 strategy\u00a0 (Figure\u00a0 17).\u00a0 Compound\u00a0 17\u00a0 had\u00a0 lysosomal\u00a0 targeting\u00a0 ability,\u00a0 ratiometric\u00a0 fluorescence\u00a0 imaging\u00a0 capability,\u00a0 polyamine\u00a0 depletion,\u00a0 and\u00a0 enhanced\u00a0ROS\u00a0 generation.\u00a0 This\u00a0 study\u00a0provides\u00a0an\u00a0 irreversible\u00a0polyamine\u00a0 consumption\u00a0 strategy,\u00a0which\u00a0 improves\u00a0 anticancer\u00a0efficacy\u00a0after\u00a0being\u00a0combined\u00a0with\u00a0PDT.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a017.\u00a0The\u00a0combination\u00a0of\u00a0photodynamic\u00a0therapy\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0putative\u00a0depletion\u00a0of\u00a0polyamines\u00a0on\u00a0 cancer\u00a0treatment\u00a0with\u00a0compound\u00a017\u00a0[95].\u00a0"

            "text": "Several types of cancer cells (e.g., from prostate cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer) demonstrate increased intracellular polyamine concentrations, which can be regarded as a biomarker for the timely diagnosis of cancer. Thus, the determination of polyamine contents in biological fluids is increasingly urgent. Many non-optical (GC, HPLC, GC-MS, immunoassays, etc.) and optical (fluorescence or visible color changes) methods have been developed for the quantitative detection of polyamine. Like any analytical method, they have certain limitations and drawbacks, as shown in Table 1. The instrumental, non-optical methods are reliable for polyamine analysis. However, they often necessitate long and tedious sample pretreatment steps and chemical derivatization processes, and require harmful and HPLC-grade quality organic solvents. In particular, the sample pretreatment, including the extraction, enrichment, and derivatization, often needs to be carried out immediately prior to detection [96]. The most common polyamine derivatization approaches include dansyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, o-phthalaldehyde, etc. Recently, carrier-mediated membrane-assisted three-phase liquid\u2013liquid extraction coupled with liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry was developed for polyamine determination [97]. Fluorescence detection is known as a low-cost, simple operation, with a high throughput and high sensitivity, but most fluorescent sensors are not completely water-soluble. Some of them show an aggregation-caused quenching effect when they are deposited in the solid, film, or aggregated states. Moreover, the fluorescence signal is susceptible to factors that are unrelated to the analytes, such as instrument parameters, auto-fluorescence, and external environment variations (e.g., temperature and humidity). The development of ratiometric fluorescence signals and AIE-active fluorescence probes would be promising strategies.\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 633 14 of 19\nRecently, many novel sensing methods and materials have received additional attention. Enzymatic biosensors such as chemiluminescents, electrochemicals, and fluorescence have been developed for polyamine evaluation [98]. Cu2+\u20142-carboxymethylthio-5mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole-functionalized organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) exhibit the detection and discrimination of multi-polyamines [99]. The electrochemiluminescent (ECL) method was developed for the detection of several polyamines on a microfluidic chip [100]. An ultrahigh-performance supercritical fluid chromatography (UHPSFC) method was utilized for polyamine detection in gentamicin sulfate [101]. The in-situ high-performance chemical receptor-conjugated graphene electronic nose shows potential applications for polyamine detection [102]. Overall, more robust constitution techniques need to be developed to meet the requirements of polyamine determination. In the future, more advanced technology, including intelligent nanofilm biosensors, and multifunctional nanocomposite biosensors, would be a promising research field for polyamine detection. In addition, medications modulating polyamine levels against biosynthesis, transport and degradation have been investigated as cancer-drug candidates. Since the polyamine compensation mechanism is frequently activated, polyamine biosynthesis and metabolic inhibitors are not ideal candidates. Supramolecular chemotherapy can be applied to treat spermine-overexpressed tumors with excellent targeting and high tumor inhibition with minimal side effects, but they fail to efficiently induce tumor cell apoptosis due to the reversible host\u2013guest interaction between the host and spermine. A combination of polyamine consumption and PDT may present a promising strategy. In general, polyaminebased antitumor treatments still have some way to go before they have a desirable antitumor treatment effect. Multiple combination therapeutic approaches based on targeting polyamine depletion would provide new leads in cancer therapeutics.\nAuthor Contributions: B.L.: Collecting references and writing original draft; L.W.: supervision, reviewing and editing; X.R., H.T. and D.C.: reviewing and editing.
