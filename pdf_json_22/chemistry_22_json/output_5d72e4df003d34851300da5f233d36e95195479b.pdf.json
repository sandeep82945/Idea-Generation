    "abstractText": "Widespread application of carbendazim (CBZ) is a major environmental impact because of its residues that caused multi\u2010organ dysfunction. Recently, Chitosan nanoparticles (CS\u2010NPs) are extensively used as nanocarriers due to their non\u2010toxic and biodegradable nature. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the possible mechanistic pathway of modified CS\u2010NPs to reduce the hepatic and nephrotoxicity of CBZ in rats. CS\u2010NPs were synthesized by the ionic gelation method by using ascorbic acid instead of acetic acid to increase its antioxidant efficiency. Twenty\u2010adult male Wistar rats were grouped (n = 5) as follows: Group (1) negative control, group (2) received CS\u2010NPs, group (3) received CBZ, and group (4) co\u2010administered CS\u2010NPs with CBZ. Rats received the aforementioned materials daily by oral gavage for 28 days and weighed weekly. The results revealed that CBZ receiving group showed severe histopathological alterations in the liver and kidney sections including cellular necrosis and interstitial inflammation confirmed by immunostaining and showed marked immunopositivity of iNOS and caspase\u20103 protein. There were marked elevations in the serum levels of ALT, AST, urea, and creatinine with a significant increase in MDA levels and decrease in TAC levels. Upregulation of the Keap1 gene and down\u2010regulation of Nrf2 and HO\u20101 genes were also observed. Co\u2010treatment of rats by CS\u2010NPs with CBZ markedly improved all the above\u2010mentioned toxicological parameters and return liver and kidney tissues to normal histological architecture. We concluded that CBZ caused hepatorenal toxicity via oxidative stress and the Nrf2/HO\u20101 pathway and CS\u2010NPs could reduce CBZ toxicity via their antioxidant, anti\u2010apoptotic, and anti\u2010inflammatory effects.",

Recently, Chitosan nanoparticles (CS\u2011NPs) are extensively used as nanocarriers due to their non\u2011toxic and biodegradable nature. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the possible mechanistic pathway of modified CS\u2011NPs to reduce the hepatic and nephrotoxicity of CBZ in rats. CS\u2011NPs were synthesized by the ionic gelation method by using ascorbic acid instead of acetic acid to increase its antioxidant efficiency. Twenty\u2011adult male Wistar rats were grouped (n = 5) as follows: Group (1) negative control, group (2) received CS\u2011NPs, group (3) received CBZ, and group (4) co\u2011administered CS\u2011NPs with CBZ. Rats received the aforementioned materials daily by oral gavage for 28 days and weighed weekly. The results revealed that CBZ receiving group showed severe histopathological alterations in the liver and kidney sections including cellular necrosis and interstitial inflammation confirmed by immunostaining and showed marked immunopositivity of iNOS and caspase\u20113 protein. There were marked elevations in the serum levels of ALT, AST, urea, and creatinine with a significant increase in MDA levels and decrease in TAC levels. Upregulation of the Keap1 gene and down\u2011regulation of Nrf2 and HO\u20111 genes were also observed. Co\u2011treatment of rats by CS\u2011NPs with CBZ markedly improved all the above\u2011mentioned toxicological parameters and return liver and kidney tissues to normal histological architecture. We concluded that CBZ caused hepatorenal toxicity via oxidative stress and the Nrf2/HO\u20111 pathway and CS\u2011NPs could reduce CBZ toxicity via their antioxidant, anti\u2011apoptotic, and anti\u2011inflammatory effects.\nCarbendazim (CBZ, methyl N-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) carbamate) is a systemic fungicide that is commonly used in agriculture to combat fungal infections1. CBZ is extensively used as a biocide for the protection of product categories such as film, leather, rubber, fiber, polymerized materials, and building facades, according to European Union (EU) regulation number 528/20122. CBZ is a huge global concern because it is frequently transferred via rains to areas where it poses harm to the environment, animal health, and human health3. The residual concentration of CBZ in farmland is about 0.18\u20131.74\u00a0mg/kg soil, while those in some fruits and vegetables were 0.37 and 0.60\u00a0mg/kg4. Moreover, CBZ is considered as a persistent environmental contaminant because its benzimidazolic ring which is difficult to break so, its degradation is slow5. Several countries have reported that CBZ is frequently detected in soil and water for 3\u00a0days to 12\u00a0 months6,7. Humans are exposed to carbendazim by direct (inhalation and cutaneous contact) or indirect (ingestion of polluted water, food, and occupational exposure) pathways8. CBZ gets metabolized to 5-hydroxy-2-benzimidazole carbamate and 5,6-HOBC-N-oxides (5,6- HOBC-N-oxides) that are poorly catabolized and retained in tissues such as gonads, liver, adrenals, adipose, skin and other organs. The CBZ and its retained metabolites in tissues have been shown to cause infertility and destruction of testicles in rats and mice9,10. It was discovered to induce a variety of negative health effects in animal models, including hepatotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and endocrine disruption11.

Nanoparticles (NPs) have significantly increased their use due to their reduced size and unique features15. They\u2019re used in a variety of biological, biotechnological, and optical applications16. Chitosan is a type of natural polysaccharide polymer made from chitin17. It is a non-toxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible agent that has been studied extensively in a variety of biomedical studies, including vaccine delivery, preparation of hydrogels, films, and natural fiber18,19. Recently, chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) are extensively used as nanocarriers for various biological agents such as drugs, proteins, and genes20. CS-NPs are also used in the agricultural field as plant growth promoters and protectors and also used as encapsulated agents for several agrochemicals21. It is reported that the encapsulation of pesticides with non-toxic NPs as CS-NPs can control the release of pesticides22.\nThe adverse health effects of CBZ residues on non-target organisms have directed the science to search for methods to minimize these effects. CS-NPs are known to have many benefits in medicine and agriculture due to their antimicrobial and chelating properties in addition to their biocompatible nature, but their pathophysiology in the body hasn\u2019t been fully elucidated. The in-vivo antioxidant effects of CS-NPs and their mechanisms didn\u2019t report until now. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of CS-NPs against CBZ-induced hepatorenal oxidative stress damage and discuss the role of Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway."

Carbendazim (purity: 97%, CAS number: 10605\u201321-7, MW: 191.19\u00a0kg/Mol), Chitosan (molecular weight 50,000\u2013190,000\u00a0Da, degree of deacetylation 75\u201385%, viscosity 20\u2013300 cP), ascorbic acid and other chemicals used for nanoparticles preparation were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Co., St. Louis, MO, USA.\nChitosan nanoparticles preparation and characterization. Chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized by the ionic gelation method as described by Agarwal et\u00a0al.23 but, with some modification. Briefly, CS aqueous solution (0.1% W/V) was prepared by dissolving 0.1\u00a0g chitosan in ascorbic acid solution (0.4% W/V) with stirring for 1\u00a0h. Afterward, 0.033\u00a0g TPP was dissolved in 10\u00a0ml deionized water and added dropwise to the chitosan solution with continuous stirring. The resulting chitosan particle suspension was centrifuged at 12000\u00a0 g for 30\u00a0min, and the pellet\u00a0was resuspended in deionized water. The chitosan nanoparticles suspension was then freeze-dried before further use or analysis.\nThe elemental and physicochemical structures of the prepared CS-NPs were characterized using FTIR (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and XRD (X\u2019Pert Pro, Analytical, Netherlands). The wavelength was measured using UV-spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian, Australia). The average size and zeta potential were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy and laser doppler anemometry, respectively, in triplicate using Nano-Zetasizer 3,000 HS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The morphological shape of CS-NPs was determined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G20, FEI, Netherlands). Additionally, periodical DLS analysis were done to ensure the stability of NPs in the solution to avoid the particles aggregation.\nAnimals and experimental design. All the procedures of the experimental study were designed in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (PLoS Bio 8(6), e1000412,2010 ) and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) of Cairo University (protocol number: Vet CU12102021369), Cairo, Egypt. Twenty mature male albino Wistar rats weighing 170\u2013200\u00a0g were purchased from VACSERA, Helwan, Egypt. All rats were caged in plastic cages (5 rats/cage) in a well-ventilated environment and acquired 12\u00a0h of light every day. They had been consumed dry commercial standard pellets and had access to tap water ad\u00a0libitum through the trial time frame. Two weeks of acclimatization were done before the start point of the experiment to ensure their health status.\nRats were randomly allocated into 4 groups (n = 5) using the block randomization strategy and received the treatments every day by means of oral gavage for 28\u00a0days. Group (1) received normal saline and was kept as\u00a0a control negative. Group (2) received 5\u00a0mg/kg bwt CS-NPs. Group (3) received 300\u00a0mg/kg bwt CBZ corresponding to 1/20 LD50 and equivalent to human dose of 42.8\u00a0mg/kg bwt24,25. Group (4) received CS-NPs + CBZ at the same doses mentioned previously. The dose of CS-NPs was selected in accordance with the previous study26. CS-NPs were freshly prepared once a week to avoid particles aggregation. All rats were observed daily for any signs of illness and weighted weekly throughout the experimental period.\nSampling. After 28\u00a0days postdosing, all rats were anesthetized with Ketamine and Xylazine then blood samples were collected from the tail vein and centrifuged at 3500\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min to obtain serum samples preserved at -20\u00baC for further use. Afterward, all rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation to collect liver and kidney tissue specimens that were divided into two parts. The first part was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin to carry out the histopathological and immunohistochemical assessment, while the second part was preserved at -80\u00baC till used for oxidative stress evaluations and molecular studies.\nLiver and kidney biomarkers. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were estimated following the directions of the manufacturer\u2019s kits (Bio-diagnostic Co., Egypt).\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:9986 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13960-1\nOxidative stress evaluation. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, catalase activity, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured in hepatorenal tissue homogenates and serum samples following the manufacturer kits instruction (Bio-diagnostic Co., Egypt).\nHistopathological examination. Formalin\u2010fixed liver and kidney tissue specimens were processed by using an ascending grade of alcohol and xylene. Then, the specimens were embedded in paraffin wax, cut by the ordinary microtome at 4.5\u00a0\u03bcm, stained with H&E, and then examined under light Olympus BX43 microscope and\u00a0the images were captured by Olympus DP27 camera linked to CellSens dimensions software (Product Version, 1.13; Core Version, XV 3.12 (Build 13,479)) https:// www. olymp us- lifes cience. com/ en/ softw are/ cells ens/27.\nThe semiquantitative multiparametric classical scoring system was used to assess the degree of severity of the pathological changes in liver and kidney sections in accordance with the protocol mentioned by Khalaf et\u00a0al.28. The diffuse microscopic lesions were blindly evaluated and scored as slight, mild, moderate, and severe, on fivepointed ordinal scale, as the accompanying (0 = normal histology, 1 < 25%, 2 = 25:50%, 3 = 50:75%, and 4 > 75% tissue damage). While grading scheme for focal lesions were blindly assessed as follows: (0) no foci; (1) < 3 foci; (2) 3\u20136 foci; (3) 7\u201312 foci; (4) > 12 foci/ field at low power (100X)29.\nImmunohistochemical staining. Localization of Caspase-3 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were carried out on formalin\u2010fixed paraffin\u2010embedded liver and kidney sections. Briefly, the slides were incubated with different primary antibodies (Abcam, Ltd.) at 1/200 dilutions, then incubated with Peroxidase Block (Sakura BIO) and the reagent needed for the identification of the antigen\u2010antibody complex (Power\u2010Stain 1.0 Poly HRP DAP Kit; Sakura). The sections were treated with 3, 3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzidine chromogen substrate for 10\u00a0min and counterstained by Hematoxylin and inspected by light Olympus BX43 microscope and caught by Olympus DP27 camera connected to CellSens dimensions software (Olympus).\nAbsolute quantitative scoring of the immunostaining reactions was done by using ImageJ software. The average size of various immunostaining reactivity was determined as the percentage of specific positive area concerning the total area per low power magnification (100X).\nQuantitative RT\u2011PCR for Nrf2, HO\u20111, and Keap1 genes. The Total RNA was extracted from both the liver and kidney tissues using EasyRNA\u2122 Cell/Tissue RNA Mini Kit (Biovision #K1337) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The isolated RNAs were used for the synthesis of first-strand cDNA using Super Script Reverse Transcriptase (Thermoscientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using Power Track\u2122 SYBR Green Master Mix\u00a0Applied Biosystems\u2122 on an ABI Prism Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The primer sets of the tested genes were gathered in Table\u00a01 and the target mRNA expression was normalized to ACTB.\nStatistical analysis. The obtained data were expressed as means \u00b1 error of mean (SEM) and analyzed by using SPSS version 24.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey Post Hoc-test Comparison of means was performed. A value of P \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Nonparametric values as microscopic lesion scoring values were represented as median values and analyzed using Kruskal Wallis H-test followed by Mann\u2013Whitney U-test.\nEthics approval and consent to participate.

Liver tissue sections obtained from the control group and those receiving CS-NPs showed ordinal histological architecture (Fig.\u00a02a). On the other side, liver sections obtained from CBZ receiving group showed severe histopathological alterations. Severe diffuse hepatocellular vacuolar degenerations with sparse cell necrosis were observed in most sections (Fig.\u00a02b).

            "text": "Carbendazim is the most widely used systemic fungicide in agricultural and veterinary practices30. It is also considered an environmental pollutant as it leaves residues in crops, food chains, soil, and water causing severe dangerous effects in different body organs31. Recently, nanotechnology has been used in several agricultural purposes as nano-agrochemicals, nano-fertilizers, or as encapsulating materials32. Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) is extensively used in agricultural field as growth promotor to increase the shelf life of some plants and crops33. CS-NPs caught the attention of many researchers and found many uses due to its antioxidant, non-toxic and biocompatible nature34. Despite the many uses of CS-NPs, its antioxidant mechanism hasn\u2019t been studied yet. For this reason, the current study aimed to explore the mechanistic way of CS-NPs to minimize the hepatorenal toxicity induced by CBZ in rats. In addition, new formula of CS-NPs was prepared by using ascorbic acid solution instead of acetic acid to increase its antioxidant effect even if administered at very low dosage level.\nThe results of the present study showed a significant increase in MDA levels and a decrease in TAC, GSH, and catalase activity in the group receiving CBZ suggesting oxidative stress damage on both liver and kidneys. These findings together with the down-regulation of Nrf2 and Ho1 genes, and upregulation of Keap1 gene confirmed that the main mechanism of CBZ-induced hepatorenal toxicity is oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants that lead to the disruption of redox signals causing molecular damage35. Malonaldehyde (MDA) is the end product of lipid peroxidation and its increase supports the hypothesis of oxidative stress involvement36,37. While TAC measures the total antioxidant components and its high level indicates a high response against free radicals38. On the other side, catalase is an antioxidant enzyme\nFigure\u00a05.

It exerts a potent antioxidant role through direct interaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) or by operating as a cofactor for the peroxidase enzyme41. CBZ can induce the excessive generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by altering the oxidants/antioxidants balance by promoting lipid peroxidation (LPO) and depleting both enzymatic and non-enzymatic cellular antioxidants leading to a condition of oxidative stress and cell death42,43. ROS overproduction initiates the processes of DNA and cell membrane damage via lipid peroxidation and protein degradation44.\nCBZ induced oxidative stress and can disturb various parts of cellular signaling and homeostasis through mediating redox signaling and depletion of antioxidant reservoirs45. Exogenous stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines increase intracellular ROS that contributes to the severity of pathological disorders46. One of the main proteins that control the redox signaling in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is cytochrome c (Cc), the functions of which are regulated by the phosphorylation of several residues47. Under oxidative stress conditions,\nFigure\u00a06.

During early apoptosis, Cc population tightly bound to the mitochondrial membrane triggers the peroxidation of phospholipids49.\nFrom the molecular aspect, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular redox balance and activates the natural antioxidants in mammals50. Down-regulation of Nrf2 could reduce the antioxidant defense, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutathione reductase51. On the other hand, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein1 (Keap1) is a master negative regulator of Nrf2 and its up-regulation reflects the oxidative stress damage52. The main intracellular sensor that monitors ROS is Keap1 gene53. The current study suggests that CBZ induced hepatorenal toxicity through prolonged ROS generation that activates Keap1 and results in its ability to degrade Nrf2 and down-regulates the expression of antioxidant factors as HO-154,55.\nOur results reported the highest values of both liver and kidney biomarkers in CBZ receiving group suggesting hepatocellular and renal damage that reflects on the microscopic pictures and showed severe cellular injury and interstitial inflammation in both liver and kidney sections. These findings may be related to the oxidative stress induced by CBZ via continuous ROS production that leads to cellular damage via necrosis or apoptosis56. Apoptosis is another mechanism of CBZ-induced hepatorenal toxicity in the current study and may be mediated by both ROS and nitric oxide (NO) production57. ROS overproduction causes mitochondrial membrane permeability via opening the transition pores leading to the release of cytochrome-c and activating several caspase cascades58,59. Among the effector caspases, Casp-3 is responsible for initiating the hallmarks of the degradation phase of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation, cell shrinkage, and membrane blebbing and has a distinct role in intrinsic apoptosis60. Moreover, NO is an intercellular messenger that has been recognized as one of the most versatile players in the immune system and inflammatory process61. The inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) is most commonly associated with inflammatory conditions in which NO is produced in large amounts62.\nOur results showed that co-administration of CS-NPs with CBZ could reduce all the studied toxicological parameters affirm to prevent both liver and kidney organs from being damage. The novel formulation of CSNPs exerts a potent antioxidant effect manifested by a significant decrease in MDA value and an increase in TAC, GSH, and catalase activity. The results of the present study suggest that CS-NPs had the ability to protect the hepatic and renal cell membrane from oxidative damage through down-regulation of Keap1 that activates Nrf2/HO1 signaling pathway63. The Nrf2/HO-1 system activates cascade of events which in the end, affects oxidative status of the cells and provides robust protection against oxidative challenge64. Under the influence of CBZ-induced oxidative stress, CS-NPs had the ability to induce several antioxidants and anti-apoptotic proteins, including HO-1 via activation of Nrf2. Since Nrf2 is ubiquitously expressed, it plays a critical role in protecting many cell types and organ systems from oxidative stress and an array of toxic insults65. Previous studies reported that administration of rats with 200\u00a0mg/kg Chitosan had the ability to reduce the liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and elevate the antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase and superoxide dismutase66. Another study revealed that CS-NPs administration at a dosage level of 280\u00a0mg/kg demonstrated considerable improvements in rat\u2019s liver biomarkers, oxidant/antioxidant balance, and the microscopic picture67.\nCS-NPs can also improve the microscopic picture of both liver and kidney sections and restore liver and kidney biomarkers to the normal levels. In addition, our results revealed for the first time that CS-NPs have strong anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects manifested by weak immunohistochemical staining of casp-3 and iNOS in both liver and kidney sections. The advantage of this novel CS-NPs formula over other CS-NPs is that novel CS-NPs formula has greater antioxidant effects which could be related to both chitosan and ascorbic acid. The antioxidant capability of CS-NPs is supposed to operate by means of a direct radical scavenging mechanism68 such as super oxide radical and hydroxyl radical69 or indirectly, via metal chelation, which could block the ROS generation and lipid oxidation70. CS-NPs are known to increase the protein expression of Nrf2 and the mRNA levels of NQO1, HO-171. Notably, activation of the Nrf2 pathways has been demonstrated to be involved in suppressing inflammatory responses72. It is reported that chitosan could induce the innate immune cells to release a wide range of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and bioactive lipids73. The new formula using ascorbic acid has increased the antioxidant activity by suppressing free radical generation and attenuating oxidative damage74. It is well known that ROS is the main cause of cell death so, decreasing ROS will decrease the incidence of cell death75. Ascorbic acid is considered an anti-inflammatory agent76, and can be attributed to its ability to modulate the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappa-B77, as it can reduce plasma levels of inflammatory mediators TNF-\u1f70 and IL-678."

            "text": "From the result of the current study, we can conclude that the newly prepared CS-NPs have a potent capacity to reduce the hepatorenal toxicity induced by CBZ via the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of both chitosan and ascorbic acid. Chitosan up-regulates the expression of Nrf2 and the natural antioxidant HO-1, which diminish the hepatorenal oxidative stress damage and inflammation induced by CBZ. In addition, using ascorbic acid in CS-NPs preparation had the advantage to increase its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity via scavenging free radicals and modulating the expression of inflammatory proteins. Our novel CS-NPs formula has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects by diminishing the iNOS and caspase-3 expression. We recommend using these newly formulated CS-NPs as an antioxidant agent for the treatment of several disorders associated with oxidative stress damage. In addition, CS-NPs may be used safely as a nanocarrier for several agrochemicals as fertilizers and pesticides, but further studies are needed to confirm the safety of these newly formulated nanoconjugates."
