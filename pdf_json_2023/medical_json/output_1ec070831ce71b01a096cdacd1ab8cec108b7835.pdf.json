    "abstractText": "Agility is a fitness-skill-related component that should be a part of the standard physiological testing for soccer players and one of the key performance indicators in soccer. The present study aimed to assess the reliability of the CRAST as a research tool in the study of soccer skills. Twenty-one university soccer players (chronological age: 19.3 \u00b1 1.4 years; body mass: 69.6 \u00b1 8.2 kg; stature: 173.5 \u00b1 6.5 cm; federated training experience: 9.7 \u00b1 3.6 years) volunteered for the testing protocol. The CRAST requires players to complete random courses six times as quickly as possible. In addition, the CRAST requires players to control and dribble the markers (four different colors: green, yellow, blue, and red). The soccer players completed three trials, each separated by one week. The first trial accounted for familiarization; the second and third were considered for analysis. The correlation for overall performance was very strong. The reliability of the CRAST was slightly better for total time than that for the penalty score (0.95 vs. 0.93). The TEM and the associated CV range of 7.04\u20137.54% were for the penalty score and the total time, respectively. For both measurements, the ICC values also represent excellent reliability, as both values were over 0.900. The CRAST is a reliable protocol for assessing agility in soccer players.",

            "text": "Talent identification programs play an essential role in sports, aiming to identify gifted players for high-level practice through clubs and academies [1]. Soccer requires a multivariate approach for the early detection of talented players [2,3]. Previous proposals included anthropometry and body composition measurements [3,4], physical and fitness performance [2,4], psychological tests [5], and skill tests [2\u20134,6]. Coordinative capacity agility is one of the key performance indicators in soccer. It is a fitness-skill-related component that should be a part of standard physiological testing for soccer players [7]. Soccer match performance indicates that the game is characterized by fast movements that become prominent in short and long sprints, explosive reactions (such as jumping), and quick changes in direction [8]. Short-term maximal actions impact soccer performance by requiring speed, acceleration, or agility [9]. Agility is defined as rapid whole-body movement with a change in speed or direction in response to a stimulus [10]. Agility has relationships with trainable physical qualities such as strength, power, and technique, and cognitive components such as eye-tracking techniques, visual scanning speed, and anticipation [10]. Agility testing is challenging to quantify since it is a physical component that is influenced by many factors (internal and external), and there is difficulty in providing a test with enough uncertainty to replicate game conditions and enough precision in the protocol for the test to be reliable [1]. Considering this, many tests used to measure agility evaluate other physical capacities in team sports, such as the capacity for a previously planned change in direction and coordination. From this perspective, the literature has numerous evaluation tests, such as the 5\u20130\u20135 agility [11], pro agility [12], Illinois agility [13],\nJ. Funct. Morphol. Kinesiol. 2023, 8, 11. https://doi.org/10.3390/jfmk8010011 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jfmk\nJ. Funct. Morphol. Kinesiol. 2023, 8, 11 2 of 8\narrowhead agility [14], and ladder agility [15] tests. Furthermore, static rather than dynamic drills or opposition can blur the distinction between \u201ctechnique\u201d and \u201cskill\u201d. The specific feature of a skilled movement is that the player has a learned ability to select and with which to perform the correct technique as determined by the demands of the situation. Recognizing the limitations of the available tests, we developed the Coimbra Reactive Agility Soccer Test (CRAST) to assess the multifaceted aspects of soccer skills, including dribbling, control, and decision making. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the reliability of the CRAST as a research tool in the study of soccer skills."

However, most of these tests only examine the ability to quickly change direction (i.e., COD) without including the response to unpredictable external stimuli, which is an essential facet of agility [26]. Therefore, there is a clear distinction between changing direction, which is preplanned, and reactive and nonplanned agility, especially in detecting cognitive (i.e., perceptual, decision making) and physical (i.e., conditioning capacities) determinants of agility [27]. So far, perceptual and cognitive capacities have been identified as significant predictors of reactive agility in team sport athletes [27,28]. Agility is crucial for long-term soccer development, and studies frequently focused on the reliability and validity of the tests aiming to test, retest, and compare this capacity among different ages and competitive levels of expertise [29,30]. For example, a previous study [31] examined the reliability and validity of the modified Barrow COD test, and reported similar high test\u2013retest reliability (ICC: 0.94) for 11-to-14-year-old soccer players. A recent study [8] considered 20 U17 and U19 male soccer players divided into three playing positions (defenders, midfielders, and forwards), and presented appropriate-to-high (ICC: 0.70 to 0.92) reliability in reactive agility and COD testing, respectively. Lastly, consid-\nJ. Funct. Morphol. Kinesiol. 2023, 8, 11 6 of 8\nering adult athletes, performing the butterfly agility test (BAT) [25] had a good reliability value (ICC = 0.89). Agility is essential in soccer [32], involving dribbling, passing, and kicking, and indicating the importance of ball control [32]. Consequently, tests designed to simulate real-game situations in soccer are increasing in the literature [33,34]. Thus, researchers have developed soccer-specific COD drills and reactive agility tests, including ball control [8,35]. Previous studies indicated that sport-specific agility tests should consider the specificity of the movement technique [8]. For example, soccer players must repeatedly change direction with various jumps, breaks, accelerations, and decelerations. Thus, they often perform turns, alternate between running and lateral shuffling, and change from forward to backward running (frontiers). Previous authors [36] suggested that the Y-shaped course may not be appropriate reactive agility to evaluate soccer players. So, it becomes evident that COD and reactive agility should be considered to be vital components for successful performance in soccer [8]. More recently, a study [8] investigated soccer-specific reactive agility where players performed agility tests by adding the soccer-specific movement of kicking. In brief, tests showed high reliability and power to discriminate between playing levels (e.g., U17 vs. U19 players) [8]. However, due to the absence of soccer-specific reactive agility tests that involve specific stop-and-go movement patterns and ball techniques, the primary rationale for this study was to determine whether newly developed tests of reactive agility would be reliable in evaluating soccer-specific agility performance. The main limitation of this study originates from the cross-sectional design. The current study only observed one performance-level group involved in equal sports settings. Furthermore, the chronological age range reflects other noncontrolled factors (i.e., the initial selection of players in different generations). Moreover, the primary purpose was to develop and evaluate a soccer-specific test of reactive agility, including the dribbling ability often executed in real-game contexts. Therefore, although the presented and evaluated tests exhibited very good reliability, further studies are required to investigate dribbling-specific soccer agile performance at different competitive levels."
