    "abstractText": "Abstract In this contribution, we study the quasinormal modes of a Generic\u2013class of a regular black hole with a magnetic charge in nonlinear electrodynamics, considering scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. The Generic\u2013class contains the Bardeen\u2013class, Hayward\u2013class, and New\u2013class solutions. As the Generic\u2013class can represent a black hole with two horizons or one horizon. First, we obtain the critical values of the magnetic charge and mass. Then, using the third\u2013order WKB approximation, we can determine the dependence of the quasinormal modes with the parameters of the Generic\u2013class. Finally, the transmission and reflection coefficients of the scattered wave in the third\u2013order WKB approximation are calculated.",

INTRODUCTION\nIn general, the solutions to the Einstein equations with spherical symmetry representing Black Holes (BHs) have a singularity at the origin. According to the Penrose conjecture, these singularities must be dressed by event horizons, the singularities are nonphysical objects so they do not exist in nature. The violation of the Penrose conjecture is produced when instabilities exist, leading to the destruction of the event horizon and producing naked singularities.\nThe construction of regular solutions (free of curvature divergences) has been proposed to avoid the singularity problem, the theory of general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics has been a good candidate. Born and Infeld [1] were the first ones that considered the nonlinear electrodynamics as an attempt to avoid, at a classical level, the singularity of the electric field of a point charge.This is why the regular magnetic black hole proposed by Bardeen [2] exists. Another regular solution that contains critical scale, mass, and charge parameters was proposed by Hayward [3], this is accomplished by applying the limiting curvature conjecture [4].\nA Generic-class that contains the solutions of Bardeen, Hayward, and another one is addressed in [5] where a regular solution of a charged black hole in general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) is constructed by the authors.\nA black hole constantly interacts with matter and fields that surround it, as a result of these interactions, the BH is in a perturbed state, the perturbations of the black hole are independent of whether the BH is regular or irregular. When a BH is perturbed, the resulting behavior can be described as a stage of damped oscillations with complex frequencies, the modes of such oscillations are called quasinormal modes (QNM). The real part of the frequencies describes the frequency of oscillation, and the imaginary part describes the damping of the oscillation.\nAn application of the study of QNM is the analysis of the stability of BHs, they are also crucial for characterizing the gravitational wave signals detected by LIGO and VIRGO [6]. It is important to mention that several numerical methods to calculate the QNM exist; for example, the continued fraction method [7], finite difference method [8], WKB [9], among other approximation methods, being the WKB method the most used.\nNowadays, different authors have investigated QNM in NLED. For instance, the QNM of\nBardeen BH [10], QNM of charged BHs in Einstein\u2013Born\u2013Infeld gravity [11], Bronnikov BH [12], among others. Scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations are considered in [13] and [14]. In addition, the QNM of Hayward, Bardeen, and Ayo\u0301n\u2013Beato\u2013Garc\u0301\u0131a are compared in [15]. QNM may also be studied using the Eikonal regime and effective geometry as it can be seen in [16] and in [17] where the Eikonal approximation is applied to study the Einstein\u2013Euler\u2013Heisenberg BH.\nMoreover, different investigations have emerged about QNM for other types of scenarios. This can be illustrated in a couple of references, in [18] Braneworld black holes are studied, as well as in [19][20] where black holes and wormholes are considered.\nThe structure of this paper is organized as follows: The subsequent section presents an analysis of the Generic\u2013class of magnetically charged regular BH, the conditions for it to have one or two event horizons are given. Section III derives the effective potentials arising in the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. Then, the behavior of the potentials for the Bardeen\u2013class, Hayward\u2013class, and a New\u2013class solution is shown. In Section IV presents the QNM of the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. The frequencies of the QNM are compared considering different values of the constant that characterizes the strength of nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field. Finally, the Section V includes the reflection and transmission coefficients considering the different perturbations. Conclusions are given in Section VI."

To exclude the singularity at the origin is necessary to consider some restrictions: the function m(r) is at least three times differentiable, it approaches zero sufficiently fast in the limit r \u2192 0, and the third-order derivative has some low\u2013lying curvature polynomials (for more details see [5]).\nThe line element (3) satisfies the symmetry T tt = T r r and the potential can be written as;\nA\u03b2 = \u03d5\u0303(r)\u03b4 t \u03b2 \u2212 q cos \u03b8\u03b4\u03c6\u03b2 (4)\nWhere \u03d5\u0303(r) is the electric potential and the magnetic charge is represented by q. The metric funtion of the Generic\u2013class of magnetically charged regular BH (see [5]) is\ngiven by;\nf(r) = 1\u2212 2Mr \u00b5\u22121\n(r\u03bd + q\u03bd)\u00b5/\u03bd (5)\nThe dimensionless constant that characterizes the electromagnetic field\u2019s nonlinearity strength is given by \u00b5 \u2265 3, M is the gravitational mass, and \u03bd > 0 is a dimensionless constant. The form the Lagrangian density to obtain f(r) in (5) is given by;\nL = 4\u00b5\n\u03b1\n(\u03b1F ) \u03bd+3 4\n[1 + (\u03b1F ) \u03bd 4 ]1+ \u00b5 \u03bd\n. (6)\n\u03b1 > 0 is a constant that has the dimension of length squared and it is related to the gravitational mass (M = \u03b1\u22121q3). Moreover, the construction of charged BHs has been studied in [22] [23].\nFrom (5) several classes of regular BHs can be obtained, such as Bardeen\u2013class (Barc) solutions (\u03bd = 2), Hayward\u2013class (Hawc) solutions (\u03bd = \u00b5) and a New\u2013class (Newc) (\u03bd = 1). The solution (5) can represent a BH with two horizons, or an extremal BH with one horizon. The number of horizons depends on the possible values of parameters \u00b5, \u03bd, M , and q.\nThe event horizons (rh) for the space\u2013time defined by line element (3) are obtained by obtaining the roots of the function f(r), only for this analysis, the radial distance and the charge parameter q are expressed in units of mass as r \u2192 r/M , q \u2192 q/M . As a next step, we determine the range of values of magnetic charge q, were the line element (3) can represent a black hole or an extremal black hole, for this analysis, the method described in [24, 25] id used. First, we consider that f(rh) = 0, then q \u03bd can be parametrized as a function of rh as;\nq\u03bd(rh) = \u2212r\u03bdh + 2\u03bd/\u00b5\n(r1\u2212\u00b5h ) \u03bd/\u00b5\n(7)\nwhere q\u03bd(rh) has extremes (\ndq\u03bd(rh) drh\n= 0 ) in a certain rh = rcri, given by;\nrcrit =\n( 2\u03bd/\u00b5(\u00b5\u2212 1)\n\u00b5\n)\u00b5/\u03bd (8)\nThen, the critical value of the parameter q\u03bd is given in terms of \u00b5 as;\nq\u03bdcrit = q \u03bd(rcrit) =\n\u00b5 ( (\u00b5\u22121)2\u03bd/\u00b5\n\u00b5\n)\u00b5/\u03bd\n\u00b5\u2212 1 \u2212 ( (\u00b5\u2212 1)2\u03bd/\u00b5 \u00b5 )\u00b5 , (9)\nso the magnetically charged regular BH (5) has one (r+) or two (rin and rout) horizons\nfor values of q\u03bd \u2264 q\u03bdcrit. When the equations f(r) = 0 and d\ndr f(r) = 0 are satisfied simultaneously, the extreme\ncase (the inner and outer horizons form a only horizon r+) is obtained. Then, introducing q\u03bd of (7) in d dr f(r) = 0, we can obtain one real root denoted by r+ = rcrit.\nThe Fig. 1 a) shows the behavior of q\u03bdcrit as function of \u00b5. The lines q \u03bd crit contain the values of (q\u03bd , \u00b5) where the magnetically charged regular black holes have one horizon, while in the regions below the lines, there are two horizons and there are no horizons in the regions above the lines.\nThus, the ranges of the charge parameter increase as \u00b5 increases in the Hawc solution (\u03bd = \u00b5) and decrease as \u00b5 increases in the Barc (\u03bd = 2) and in the Newc (\u03bd = 1). It is also possible to mention that the range [q]\u03bd=\u00b5 > [q]\u03bd=2 > [q]\u03bd=1. In [26] the ranges of q for the case with \u00b5 = 3 were studied.\nWe complement the analysis of the horizons of Generic\u2013class, studying the behavior of\nM(rh, q) in (5).\nM(rh, q) = 1\n2 r1\u2212\u00b5h (q \u03bd + r\u03bdh) \u00b5/\u03bd (10)\nNote that as \u00b5 \u2265 \u03bd the function M(rh, q) \u2192 \u221e for rh \u2192 \u221e. A critical mass M\u2217 exists (see equation (11)) and a radius r\u2217 = q(\u22121 + \u00b5)1/\u03bd such that the Generic\u2013class does not have a horizon when M < M\u2217, in the case that M\u2217 = M , the Generic\u2013class has one horizon at r = r\u2217 and has two horizons if M\u2217 < M .\nM\u2217 = 1 2 q\u00b5\u00b5/\u03bd(\u00b5\u2212 1) 1\u2212\u00b5\u03bd (11)\nIn Fig.1 b) the behavior of M as function of rh is shown for \u00b5 = 6, it can be seen that M\u2217(Hawc) < M\u2217(Barc) < M\u2217(Newc). From the Fig. 1 b) we can conclude that when we fix a value of M (for example M = 1) is shown, the rout horizon of Hawc is larger compared with rout horizons of Barc and Newc."

The effective potential V (r) (15) depends on the parameters of the function f(r) and the harmonic index l. It may be noted that the value of both effective potentials (see equation 15) increases with an increasing l, then, to be able to make a comparison between the different effective potentials of the different solutions that emerge from (5), we choose a particular case of l.\nIn the Fig 2, we consider the value of l = 2 and the dependence of effective potentials is shown (15) with the parameter \u00b5 for Newc (Fig 2 a)), Barc (Fig 2 b)) and Hawc (Fig 2 c)). It can be noticed that in the case of Newc and Barc the potentials increase as \u00b5 increases. When \u00b5 is increased, the maximum of potentials increase and their position is shifted to the left for both perturbations, this implies that the strength of nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field increases the magnitudes of the different potentials. But in the case of Hawc, when \u00b5 increases, the maximum of potentials decrease and its position is shifted to the right. It is possible to observe that V (r)elec < V (r)sc for the three different cases of black holes.\nOn the other hand, in Fig. 2 d) the different effective potentials of the three BHs are compared with the same charge. We can observe that V (r)Hawc . V (r)RN < V (r)Barc < V (r)Newc in both perturbations, we note that the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations of the Newc are higher than the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations of Hawc and Barc.\nThe difference between Barc and Hawc potentials is not significant as is shown in the Fig 2 d) . To complete the comparison between the effective potentials, we introduce V (r)RN that represents the effective potential of a Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) BH. In the following sections all the results are compared with the RN BH which is the linear counterpart of nonlinear electromagnetic BHs.\nLastly, we can mention that electromagnetic and scalar perturbations have similar behavior. However, the maximum potential height is much higher for scalar perturbations, and the maximum of the potential depends on \u00b5. It is also possible to mention that the maximum height of the potentials increases as l increases with a \u00b5 fixed. The effective potential V (r) has asymptotic value V (r) \u2248 0 when r \u2192 \u221e, in both cases, scalar and electromagnetic\nperturbation."

            "text": "The QNM are obtained from the solutions of the wave equation (14), in the event horizon the waves have to be purely ingoing \u03be\u0303(r) \u223c e\u2212i\u03c9r\u2217 and purely outgoing at spatial infinity \u03be\u0303(r) \u223c ei\u03c9r\u2217 , the wave function \u03a6 has a time dependency as \u03a6(t, r, \u03c6, \u03b8) \u223c e\u2212i\u03c9t. There exists a discrete set of complex frequencies satisfying these conditions: \u03c9 = \u03c9r \u2212 i|\u03c9i|.\nThe real part of the frequency, \u03c9r represents the oscillation of the black hole, which is always positive. On the other hand, the imaginary part of the frequency \u03c9i can be positive or negative. In the case where \u03c9i < 0, we have a damped oscillation, because \u03a6 decreases as time progresses and eventually tends to zero for very long periods of time, for which the oscillation of the black hole will gradually cease (stable solution).\nSeveral methods are proposed to calculate the quasinormal modes, but the WKB method is one of the most used. Using the code provided in [30], in the tables I and II we show the calculated frequencies with different orders of WKB and different values of \u00b5.\nIn Table I, the spectrum for the \u03c9r frequencies of the QNM of the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations is shown up to the sixth order. We can observe that in all orders, the \u03c9rsc and \u03c9relec of the Newc are more significant than the frequencies of Barc and Hawc. On the other hand, the values of \u03c9r of Barc are very close to the values of \u03c9r of Hawc for both perturbations.\nThe |\u03c9i| of the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations are shown in the Table II, we can observe that in all orders the values of |\u03c9i| are very close for the three\u2013class black holes and in general |\u03c9isc| > |\u03c9ielec|.\nThis paper also uses the third\u2013order WKB approximation developed by Schutz, Will [9],\nand Iyer [31]. The expression for obtaining the quasinormal frequencies is given by:\n\u03c92 = [ Vmax + ( \u22122V (2)max )1/2 \u039b(\u03b1) ] \u2212 i\u03b1 ( \u22122V (2)max )1/2 [1 + \u2126(\u03b1)] , (16)\nwhere\n\u039b(\u03b1) = 1\n( \u22122V (2)max )1/2\n   1 8 ( V (4) max\nV (2) max\n)( 1\n4 + \u03b12\n) \u2212 1\n288\n( V (3)max\nV (2) max\n)2 ( 7 + 60\u03b12 )    , (17)\n\u2126(\u03b1) = 1\n\u22122V (2)max\n   5 6912 ( V (3) max\nV (2) max\n)4 ( 77 + 188\u03b12 ) \u2212 1\n384\n( V (3)\n2 maxV (4) max\nV (2) 3 max\n) ( 51 + 100\u03b12 )\n\u2212 1 288\n( V (6) max\nV (2) max\n) ( 5 + 4\u03b12 ) + 1\n288\n( V (3)maxV (5) max\nV (2) 2 max\n) ( 19 + 28\u03b12 ) + 1\n2304\n( V (4) max\nV (2) max\n)2 ( 67 + 68\u03b12 )    ,(18)\nwith\n\u03b1 = n+ 1\n2 , V (m)max =\ndmV (r)\ndrm\u2217 \u2223\u2223\u2223 r\u2217=r\u2217(rq) , (19)\nwhere r\u2217(rq) indicates the value of r\u2217 at which the effective potential (V (r)) obtains its maximum (Vmax) and n is the oscillation mode.\nThe WKB method works best for l > n, while for l = n it is not appropriate, as other authors have shown (see [32]). The third\u2013order WKB approximation method is used and the Tables III\u2013IV show the spectrum of the frequencies (\u03c9r and |\u03c9i|) of the QNM for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations with different values of n, l and q.\nIt can be seen that the range of real frequencies is approximately the same for each case of l and it does not change drastically, despite its value of n, however, an increase in n for the same l will lead to a decrease in the frequencies (see Table III).\nIn contrast, the range of imaginary frequencies is approximately the same for each case of n and it does not change drastically, despite its value of l. We can also observe that for each value of n and l, the highest value of |\u03c9i| for the Newc is when we take the middle value of the range of charge that was chosen (q = 0.08), for Barc the highest value of |\u03c9i| is when we take the smallest value of the range of charge that was chosen (q = 0.28), for Hawc the same behavior is followed (q = 0.01), but the differences between frequencies is much smaller for this case (see Table IV).\nThe \u03c9r frequencies as a function of magnetic charge q with a fixed n is shown in Fig. (3) for the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. The Fig 3 a) show the dependence of \u03c9r (16) with the parameter \u00b5 for Newc, the Fig 3 b) for Barc and Fig 3 c) for Hawc. It is possible to observe that in both perturbations, the real value (\u03c9r) of the QNM frequency increases when the values of q increase, in the cases of Newc (Fig. 3 a) ) and Barc (Fig. 3 b)), then we can mention that the perturbation in the fundamental mode (n = 0) with larger values of q leads to a more intense oscillation. It is also possible to mention that \u03c9rsc > \u03c9relec . Now, in both perturbations if \u00b5 increases, \u03c9r increases but the range of values for q decreases i.e., the strength of nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field increases the magnitudes of oscillation and decreases the allowed q values.\nIn the Hawc we observe (see Fig 3 c) )that \u03c9r increases if \u00b5 decreases and \u03c9rsc > \u03c9relec , in the case \u00b5 = 8, \u03c9r decreases when q increases, then the presence of the strength of nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field decreases the magnitudes of oscillation in the Hawc.\nIn the Fig 3 d) we show and compare the real part of the quasinormal frequencies for\nthe three classes of BHs, in the case \u00b5 = 6, in general \u03c9r(Newc) > \u03c9r(Barc) > \u03c9r(RN) > \u03c9r(Hawc) for both perturbations, where \u03c9r(RN) represents the real part of the quasinormal frequencies of Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) BH. Then the electromagnetic perturbations present slower oscillations than the scalar ones, the Hawc has the slowest oscillations.\nThe complex quasinormal frequencies are shown in Fig. 4. In the case of the Newc (see Fig. 4 a) ) |\u03c9i| increase with increasing values of q and shows a maximum, then |\u03c9i| decreases. For the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations |\u03c9isc| > |\u03c9ielec|. If \u00b5 increases, \u03c9i increases but the range of values for q decreases.\nNow for Barc and Hawc, in the Fig 4 b), c) we can observe that the imaginary part of QNM frequencies |\u03c9i|, decreases as q augments. The value of q cannot exceed the value of qcrit, which corresponds to the extreme BH. Also in the Barc and Hawc |\u03c9isc| > |\u03c9ielec|.\nIf we make the comparison of \u03c9i of the different BHs (see Fig 4 d)) for a fixed \u00b5 = 6, we\nobserve that in a certain range |\u03c9i(Newc) | > |\u03c9i(RN)| > |\u03c9i(Barc)| > |\u03c9i(Hawc)|.\nThe relaxation time is one of the important properties of perturbations and is defined as (\u03c4 = 1/|\u03c9i|). We can mention that the relaxation time of the Newc diminishes faster compared with the Barc and Hawc (see Fig 4 d)), implying that the Newc system recovers the stationary state faster for both perturbations. When we compare the relaxation times for the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations we can affirm that \u03c4(Newc) < \u03c4(Barc) < \u03c4(Hawc) for charges q < 0.12. However, when the magnetic charge approaches its upper bound (qcrit), the relaxation time grows, which implies that the perturbations in the cases of Barc and Hawc have a longer life."

            "text": "As the BH absorb matter and fields around them, the accretion rate is created. Accretion has an important role in phenomenology, for example, the study of active galactic nuclei. Another interesting aspect that is the studied is the scattering and absorption cross sections,\nthe latter being related to the shadows of BH (high-frequency limit). As we know, the QNM dominate the last stage of the BH\u2019s perturbation process. Moreover, the QNM have an interesting relationship with the scattering and absorption processes of BH.\nDue to the aforementioned, in this section, the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient are discussed for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations of the different classes of black holes.\nWhen an incoming wave towards a black hole is considered, the wave (with a frequency \u03c9) is partially transmitted by the potential (15) and partially reflected by the same potential (15). The behavior of the wave can be written as follows;\n\u03be\u0303(r\u2217) = T (\u03c9)e \u2212i\u03c9r\u2217, r\u2217 \u2192 \u2212\u221e , (20)\n\u03be\u0303(r\u2217) = e \u2212i\u03c9r\u2217 +R(\u03c9)ei\u03c9r\u2217 , r\u2217 \u2192 \u221e , (21)\nwhere R(\u03c9) represents the reflection coefficient and T (\u03c9) the transmission coefficient. For\nthe flux to be conserved, the relation between the reflection and transmission is given by;\n|R(\u03c9)|2 + |T (\u03c9)|2 = 1 . (22)\nWhen the frequency of the incoming wave is minor to the height of the potential barrier (\u03c92 \u226a Vmax), then T (\u03c9) \u2248 0 and R(\u03c9) \u2248 1. But, if \u03c92 \u226b Vmax, the reflection coefficient is close to zero, while the transmission coefficient is close to one, then the wave will not be reflected by the barrier of potential.\nIn the case of \u03c92 \u2248 Vmax the WKB is adequate. The transmission coefficient is understood as the probability that an outgoing wave with a \u03c9 can reach infinity i.e, the absorption\nprobability for an incoming wave to be absorbed. In this case, the wave is absorbed by a BH.\nWhen we consider \u03c92 \u2248 Vmax, the reflection coefficient is given by;\nR(\u03c9) = ( 1 + e\u22122\u03c0i\u01eb )\u22121/2 , (23)\nIn third\u2013order in the WKB approximation, \u01eb is determined from the following equation;\n\u01eb\u2212 i\u03c9 2 \u2212 Vmax\u221a \u22122V (2)max = \u2212\u039b(\u01eb) + \u01eb\u2126(\u01eb) , (24)\nwhere \u039b(\u01eb) is given by Eq. (17) and \u2126(\u01eb) is given by Eq. (18). Now we can express the\ntransmission coefficient as;\n|T (\u03c9)|2 = 1\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223 ( 1 + e\u22122\u03c0i\u01eb )\u22121/2\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 . (25)\nThe absorption cross\u2013section can be written as \u03c3\u0303 = \u2211\u221e\nl=0 \u03c3l(\u03c9), where the partial ab-\nsorption cross\u2013section (\u03c3l(\u03c9)) of the wave is given by;\n\u03c3l(\u03c9) = \u03c0(2l + 1)\n\u03c92 |T (\u03c9)|2 . (26)\nThe reflection and transmission coefficients (with different values of \u00b5) for the Newc, Barc and Newc are shown in Figs. 5\u20137. Fig. 5 a) shows how the reflection coefficient increases as \u00b5 increases in the case of Newc and the Fig. 5 b) shows the opposite behavior for the transmission coefficient. However, the effect is more noticeable in the scalar perturbation than in the case of the electromagnetic perturbation for the reflection coefficient.\nFig. 6 a) and b) show the reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient of the Barc for different \u00b5, the differences between the different |R(\u03c9)|2 or the different |T (\u03c9)|2, are closer for both perturbations. And as we observe in the Newc the effect of the electromagnetic perturbation is more noticeable.\nThe reflection and transmission coefficients corresponding to Hawc are shown in Figs. 7 a) and b), as a function of \u03c9 with different values of \u00b5. The reflection coefficient is very close in the cases \u00b5 = 6 and \u00b5 = 8. The same happens in the case of the transmission coefficient (it is observed for both perturbations). In the small box, the difference is shown.\nIt is clear that the effect of \u00b5 is to diminish the transmission coefficient for the Newc and Barc, but in Hawc it increases. Implying that when the strength of nonlinearity\nof the electromagnetic field increases the transmission of the wave decreases, for any of the perturbations in Newc and Barc. And, an increase in the strength of nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field increases the transmission for Hawc. In general we can mention that |R(\u03c9)|2Newc > |R(\u03c9)|2Barc > |R(\u03c9)|2RN > |R(\u03c9)|2Hawc and |T (\u03c9)|2Hawc > |T (\u03c9)|2RN > |T (\u03c9)|2Barc > |T (\u03c9)|2Newc, when the \u00b5 parameter is fixed and we have the same values of q, M and l.\nFig. 8 a) and b) show that the partial absorption cross\u2013sections are higher for Hawc and Barc. Since the heights of the effective potentials in Fig. 2 d) for Hawc and Barc are smaller\nthan the effective potential of Newc. Thus, there is less absorption for the Newc. On the other hand, when we compare the absorption cross-section scalar and electromagnetic, we can conclude that \u03c3l(elec) > \u03c3l(sc). We can also mention that the absorption cross-section for Hawc is very close to the absorption cross-section of Barc."

When \u00b5 is increased, the maximum of potentials increase for Newc and Barc, but for Hawc it is opposite.\nThe QNM are studied for the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations in the Generic\u2013 class, via the third\u2013order WKB method. We have shown that an increase in q implies a monotonic increase of the \u03c9r for Newc and Barc. Also, we can see that with an increase in the parameter \u00b5, the real part (\u03c9r) of the QNM frequencies increases. But in the case of Hawc when we increase the parameter \u00b5, \u03c9r decreases.\nWe find that in the Generic\u2013class, the imaginary part of the QNM is always larger for the scalar perturbation. However, the roles are swapped for the relaxation time, we also observe that in a certain range |\u03c9i(Newc) | > |\u03c9i(Barc)| > |\u03c9i(Hawc)|. It is possible to say that as the presence of strength of nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field increases or decreases the magnitudes of oscillation and relaxation times of the different kinds of solutions. Being the Newc, the most stable solution for scalar and electromagnetic perturbation, but the range of the values of q is small.\nThe reflection and transmission coefficients have been calculated by applying the third\u2013 order WKB approach for scalar and electromagnetic perturbation. As a result, the transmission coefficient decreases with an increase of \u00b5 to the Newc and Barc, while for the Hawc it increases with an increase in \u00b5, i.e., the probability of the wave transmission through the potential barrier depends inversely on the maximum of the effective potential.\nIn the Hawc, the transmission coefficient increases due to an increase in the value of \u00b5 that weakens the potential barrier. The behavior is oppositely in the cases of Newc and Barc."
