    "abstractText": "We provide the optimal measurement strategy for a class of noisy channels that reduce to the identity channel for a specific value of a parameter (spreading channels). We provide an example that is physically relevant: the estimation of the absolute value of the displacement in the presence of phase randomizing noise. Surprisingly, this noise does not affect the effectiveness of the optimal measurement. We show that, for small displacement, a squeezed vacuum probe field is optimal among strategies with same average energy. A squeezer followed by photodetection is the optimal detection strategy that attains the quantum Fisher information, whereas the customarily used homodyne detection becomes useless in the limit of small displacements, due to the same effect that gives Rayleigh\u2019s curse in optical superresolution. There is a quantum advantage: a squeezed or a Fock state with N average photons allow to asymptotically estimate the parameter with a \u221a N better precision than classical states with same energy.",

We provide an example that is physically relevant: the estimation of the absolute value of the displacement in the presence of phase randomizing noise. Surprisingly, this noise does not affect the effectiveness of the optimal measurement. We show that, for small displacement, a squeezed vacuum probe field is optimal among strategies with same average energy. A squeezer followed by photodetection is the optimal detection strategy that attains the quantum Fisher information, whereas the customarily used homodyne detection becomes useless in the limit of small displacements, due to the same effect that gives Rayleigh\u2019s curse in optical superresolution. There is a quantum advantage: a squeezed or a Fock state with N average photons allow to asymptotically estimate the parameter with a \u221a N better precision than classical states with same energy.\nThe goal of quantum metrology [1, 2] is twofold: (1) estimate the ultimate limits in the estimation of a parameter \u03b1 that is encoded into a physical probe by some transformation or channel \u039b\u03b1, and (2) find the optimal strategies that attain this limit, namely the ones that achieve the quantum Fisher information on the optimal probe. In the noiseless case, where \u039b\u03b1 is a unitary transformation, the ultimate limits (the Heisenberg bound) and the optimal estimation strategies are known, and a quantum advantage exists either through entanglement [3] or squeezing [4], typically a quadratic enhancement of \u221a N in precision, where N is the number of entangled probes or is the average number of photons (or energy) employed in the estimation. In the noisy case [5, 6], the situation becomes very complicated and noise-dependent: there are many transformations for which all quantum advantage is lost [7] and the optimal detection strategy is known only for a handful of them [2]. In this paper we obtain a local optimal detection strategy for a large class of noisy channels, and we show that a physically relevant one of this class retains the usual\u221a N quantum advantage. These are channels parametrized by non-negative parameter \u03b1 \u2265 0 that morph into the identity channel for \u03b1 = 0. We call them \u201cspreading channels\u201d, since the noise is increased as the parameter increases. More rigorously, a spreading channel \u039b\u03b1 is defined as having the property lim\u03b1\u21920 \u039b\u03b1[\u03c1] = \u03c1, with \u039b\u03b1 differentiable in \u03b1 = 0. Our strategies are optimal in the proximity of \u03b1 = 0.\nThe spreading channels may be seen as the ones obtained by the action of a unitary U\u03b1,\u03d5 = U\u2020\u03d5e\ni\u03b1GU\u03d5 with random, rapidly varying directions \u03d5, distributed according to a distribution p(\u03d5), which for specific cases was discussed in [8, 9]. A related, but different, problem refers to the \u201cnuisance parameters\u201d[10, 11], where one works under the assumption that the uninteresting (nuisance) parameter \u03d5 has values close to some known value. We drop this assumption here. Note that our analysis is also different from the problem of quantum estimation in the absence of a reference frame [12\u201314], which can be seen as the action of a rotation U\u03d5 on the final state (we, in contrast, consider a random rotation of the channel itself). For the class of the channels discussed in this paper we show that the averaging over the parameter \u03d5 does not affect the efficiency of extracting the information about the parameter \u03b1 from the output state.\nA physically relevant example of discussed class channels is the estimation of a small value of a displacementD(\u03b1,\u03d5) = e\u03b1(e\ni\u03d5a\u2020\u2212e\u2212i\u03d5a) of a mode a of the electromagnetic field in the presence of complete randomization over \u03d5 [9, 15]. This is relevant for many estimation procedures, such as for axion dark matter searches [16\u201319], in communication channels with OOK modulation with dephasing, in magnetic field estimation either at high temperature [8] or in the presence of a trapped ion with unknown phase [9], in gravitational wave detection with resonant cavities, e.g. [20]. Similar issues appear in many optical imaging procedures [21\u201324].\nWe show that an optimal probe state among strategies employing the same average energy is the squeezed vacuum. It was previously shown [9, 25] that an optimal probe state is also a highly excited Fock state (which is much more complicated to create, impossible with current technologies). We also show the optimal detection strategy: an anti-squeezing transformation (i.e. a squeezing in the orthogonal direction), followed by a photodetection. Current experiments and proposals use homodyne detection, e.g. [19, 26]. We show that, surprisingly, homodyne detection is not only suboptimal, but even useless in the relevant limit \u03b1 \u2192 0: a result that corresponds to Rayleigh\u2019s curse [21\u201324], which, after proper formulation, can be seen as a special case of our theorem. A classical state (coherent or thermal) with N average photons can only attain at most the same sensitivity of the vacuum |0\u3009, whereas employing a squeezed or a Fock state we find a quantum Fisher information proportional to N asymptotically for small \u03b1, which proves a \u221a N enhancement.\nWe start by providing the precision limits of all spreading channels and showing a simple strategy that attains those limits: a simple yes-no projection onto the initial state of the probe. For the channels coming from averaging of unitary transformations rotated over additional parameter, we show that the Fisher information of the averaged output state is equal to averaged Fisher information calculated for the pure states, so no information is lost. Finally, we study in detail the example of the estimation of a displacement in a channel where the displacement phase is completely randomized.\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n09 38\n6v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 9\nN ov\n2 02\n2\n2"

            "text": "Consider the family of channels depending on the unknown positive parameter \u03b1 \u2265 0 satisfying lim\u03b1\u21920 \u039b\u03b1[\u03c1] = \u03c1 (i.e. they become the identity when \u03b1 = 0).\nThe aim is to estimate the exact value of \u03b1 by using a probe system in the input state \u03c1 (which may itself be composed of N entangled sub-probes) and performing the measurement {\u03a0i} on the output state \u03c1\u03b1 = \u039b\u03b1[\u03c1]. This results in a probability distribution p(i|\u03b1) = Tr(\u03a0i\u03c1\u03b1). After M repetitions we assign the estimator to the sequence of the measurement results \u2013 \u03b1\u0303(i1, i2, ..., iM ). From the Cramer-Rao bound (CR), for any unbiased estimator, the RMSE is bounded from below as\n\u2206\u03b1\u0303 \u2265 1\u221a M \u221a FC(\u03c1\u03b1, {\u03a0i}) , (1)\nwhere FC(\u03c1\u03b1, {\u03a0i}) is the classical Fisher information (CFI) (which may depend on number of entangled probesN used in each repetition). The CR inequality is known to be asymptotically saturable in the limit M \u2192 \u221e; in practice the amount of necessary repetitions M depends on the specific model.\nFor a given output state \u03c1\u03b1, the maximal value of the classical Fisher information is equal to the quantum Fisher information (QFI)\nmax {\u03a0i}\nFC(\u03c1\u03b1, {\u03a0i}) = FQ(\u03c1\u03b1) := Tr(\u03c1\u03b1L2), (2)\nwhere L is symmetric logarithm derivative d\u03c1\u03b1d\u03b1 = 1 2 (L\u03c1\u03b1 + \u03c1\u03b1L). Since the channel is a linear map and the QFI is a convex function, the optimal state for estimating \u03b1 is a pure state \u03c1 = |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c8|. Below we show, that for any spreading channel, the simple projection measurement on the initial state, i.e.\n\u03a00 = |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c8| ,\u03a01 = 1 \u2212\u03a00 (3)\nsaturates (2) for small values of \u03b1. More precisely, we assume that lim\u03b1\u21920+ FQ(\u03c1\u03b1) converges to a fixed value F + Q (\u03c10) (see App. A and [27] for a broader technical discussion, which shows that this assumption is inconsequential as long as the value \u03b1 is guaranteed to be non-negative). Then we show that\nFC(\u03c1\u03b1, {\u03a0i}) = F+Q (\u03c10) +O(\u03b1). (4)\nProof: the probability of successful projection of the final state \u03c1\u03b1 onto the initial state, relative to the POVM element \u03a00 is equal to p0(\u03b1) = Tr(\u03c1\u03b1 |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c8|). Using the relation between QFI and the fidelity via the Bures metric, for small \u03b1 we get\nTr(\u03c1\u03b1 |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c8|) = 1\u2212 1\n4 F+Q\u03b1 2 +O(\u03b13), (5)\nso\np(0|\u03b1) = 1\u22121 4 F+Q\u03b1 2+O(\u03b13), p(1|\u03b1) = 1 4 F+Q\u03b1\n2+O(\u03b13). (6)\nThe CFI for this distribution is\nFC(\u03c1\u03b1, {\u03a0i}) = \u2211 i=0,1 1 p(i|\u03b1) ( \u2202 \u2202\u03b1p(i|\u03b1)) 2 =\n1 p(1|\u03b1)[1\u2212p(1|\u03b1)] ( \u2202 \u2202\u03b1p(1|\u03b1) )2 = F+Q (\u03c10) +O(\u03b1), (7)\nwhich ends the proof. Two major issues connected with the measurement (3) should be mentioned. Namely, the smaller is \u03b1, the larger is the number of repetitions M needed to saturate the CR bound, and also the more susceptible to noise is the measurement [28]. For example, consider the noise which changes the probabilities as p0(\u03b1) \u2192 (1 \u2212 )p0(\u03b1) + /2 and p1(\u03b1) \u2192 (1\u2212 )p1(\u03b1)+ /2. Then, from (7) one can see that in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0 even arbitrary small may completely decrease the value of Fisher information. In practice, the procedure works well and gives good estimates of \u03b1 if the noise p1(\u03b1) and the number of repetitions M 1/p1(\u03b1). Note that this issue is not a specific defect of this protocol, but rather an unavoidable difficulty: for certain types of models, maximizing QFI is unavoidably connected with extreme sensitivity to noise [28].\nA physically relevant class of spreading channels is the one obtained by averaging some unitary channel over the direction of action. We consider a quantum channel of the form:\n\u039b\u03b1(\u03c1) = \u222b d\u03d5 p(\u03d5) U\u03b1,\u03d5 \u03c1 U \u2020 \u03b1,\u03d5, U\u03b1,\u03d5 = U \u2020 \u03d5e i\u03b1GU\u03d5.\n(8) This means that, every time the channel is used, \u03d5 is independently randomly drawn from the distribution p(\u03d5). This is not a randomization of the parameter \u03d5 of the probe, but of the channel itself. Assuming a pure input state, from convexity\n\u2200\u03b1>0 FQ(\u03c1\u03b1) \u2264 \u222b d\u03d5 p(\u03d5)FQ(|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009) := FQ(\u03b1), (9)\nwhere |\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 \u2261 U\u03b1,\u03d5 |\u03c8\u3009 and FQ is the average QFI of |\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 over \u03d5. Below we show, that this inequality is tight in the limit of small \u03b1 \u2013 indeed, for fixed initial state, no information is lost during averaging over \u03d5. Moreover, all this information may be extracted through a projection on the initial state. Indeed, from the Bures metric for pure states we have:\n| \u3008\u03c8|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 |2 = 1\u2212 1\n4 FQ(|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009)\u03b12 +O(\u03b13), (10)\nwhich, after averaging over \u03d5, gives (5) with FQ(\u03b1) in place ofF+Q (\u03c10), which shows that they differ by the factorFQ(\u03b1)\u2212 F+Q (\u03c10) = O(\u03b1)\nNote that, if p(\u03d5) is not uniform, some care must be taken to estimate \u03b1 from the measurement outcomes, see App. B."

            "heading": "II. OPTICAL DISPLACEMENT ESTIMATION",
            "text": "In this section we consider a physically relevant example of spreading channels: the estimation of the amplitude \u03b1 of a displacement D(\u03b1,\u03d5) = U\u2020\u03d5e i\u03b1GU\u03d5, where G = 1i (a \u2020 \u2212 a) and\n3 U\u03d5 = e \u2212i\u03d5a\u2020a, with random phase \u03d5. We consider the scenario where the experiment is repeated M times with a bound N for the mean input energy in each realization. This is related to typical realistic constrains, where the total number of repetitionsM is restricted by the time of observation, which is independent of the amount of resources used in a single repetition (i.e. one cannot reduce N increasing M because of total time constrains). For simplicity of the notation we introduce G(\u03d5) = U\u2020\u03d5GU\u03d5 = 1 i (e\ni\u03d5a\u2020 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03d5a). For each \u03d5, the QFI is\nFQ(|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009) = 4(\u3008\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1 |G(\u03d5)2|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1 |G(\u03d5)|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 2 ) =\n4(\u3008\u03c8|G(\u03d5)2|\u03c8\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03c8|G(\u03d5)|\u03c8\u30092) \u2264 4 \u3008G(\u03d5)2\u3009 = 4 \u3008\u2212e2i\u03d5a\u20202 \u2212 e\u22122i\u03d5a2 + 2a\u2020a+ 1\u3009 , (11)\nwhere in the second equality we used the fact that acting with eiG(\u03d5) does not change the variance of G(\u03d5). Therefore, the average is upper bounded by the average photon number of the initial state as\nFQ = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b d\u03d5 FQ(|\u03c8\u3009\u03d5\u03b1) \u2264 8(\u3008a\u2020a\u3009+ 1\n2 ) (12)\nwhich was derived in a different manner in [9]. This bound can be clearly saturated by a Fock state [9] which is invariant for U\u03d5 = ei\u03d5a\n\u2020a. What was unknown up to now is that it can also be saturated by a squeezed vacuum state |r, 0\u3009 (r the squeezing parameter), where for \u03b1 \u223c 0 we have\nFQ(|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009) = 8(cos(2\u03d5) cosh(r) sinh(r) + sinh 2(r) + 1/2),\n(13) where N = \u3008a\u2020a\u3009 = sinh2(r), so indeed after averaging over \u03d5, (12) is saturated. As can be expected, for the squeezing in direction of the shift (\u03d5 \u2248 0), the QFI is significantly enhanced, while for the perpendicular direction (\u03d5 \u2248 \u03c0/2) it performs even worse than the vacuum state. The intuition behind our procedure is that these competing effects do not cancel (due to the nonlinearity of the QFI) and, after averaging over \u03d5, the bound (12) is saturated. For the optimal measurement proposed in (3) the probability of outcome 0 is exactly given by the fidelity between the initial and final state averaged over \u03d5 (the averaging being irrelevant for Fock states). For the squeezed state [29]:\u222b\nd\u03d5 2\u03c0 | \u3008r, 0|D(\u03b1,\u03d5)|r, 0\u3009 |2 =\u222b\nd\u03d5 2\u03c0 e\u2212\u03b1 2(cos2(\u03d5)e2r+sin2(\u03d5)e\u22122r) =\ne\u2212\u03b1 2 cosh(2r)I0(\u03b1 2 sinh(2r)) =\ne\u2212\u03b1 2(2N+1)I0(\u03b1 22 \u221a N(N + 1)), (14)\nwith I0 modified Bessel functions of the first kind, whereas for Fock states [9, 30]:\n| \u3008N |D(\u03b1,\u03d5)|N\u3009 |2 = e\u2212|\u03b1| 2 (LN (|\u03b1|2))2, \u2200\u03d5 (15)\nwith LN the Laguerre polynomial. Both behave in the same way for small \u03b1. So, while both states are equally optimal in\nthe limit \u03b1 \u2192 0, for larger values of |\u03b1| the FI for the Fock state is typically higher even though at specific points it is null (see Fig. 1) and there Fock states become useless. So, in the case of local estimation, the Fock state performs better typically, but the situation changes for global estimation since the averaged squeezed state has a monotonic decreasing fidelity, the Fock state does not. So, the value of \u03b1 cannot always be derived uniquely solely from the measurement (3) if one uses a Fock state, but it can in the case of squeezed states. Indeed, if one uses a squeezed vacuum, the maximum likelihood estimator \u03b1\u0303ML(m0,m1) (where m0,1 are the number of measurements with outcome 0, 1 in the measurement (3)) is simply given by the inverse of the function p(0|\u03b1) (with respect to \u03b1) at point p(0|\u03b1) = m0m0+m1 . Clearly, when a finite number of measurements are employed, statistical fluctuations in the average (14) will become important, which can be estimated through Monte-Carlo methods (App. C). Up to now, we considered the case where the phase is completely randomized between different measurements. If there is no randomization and the value of\u03d5 is known, then the optimal strategy is known [31]: use a squeezed vacuum with \u03d5-dependent squeezing. The intermediate case in which the randomization happens slowly is analyzed in App. D.\nThe quantum enhancement can be shown if one starts from a coherent state |\u03b2\u3009 with average number of photons |\u03b2|2, it is clear that\n|\u3008\u03b2|D(\u03b1,\u03d5)|\u03b2\u3009|2 = |\u30080|D(\u03b1,\u03d5)|0\u3009|2 = e\u2212\u03b1 2 , (16)\nnamely, the fidelity between a coherent state and a displaced coherent state is the same as the fidelity between the vacuum and the displaced vacuum for the same degree of displacement. So one can obtain a strategy that performs equally well using a zero-energy vacuum state instead of a coherent state (and both are impervious to the value of \u03d5 which does not affect the fidelity). In the context of (12), the inequality is not\n4 saturated in this case, since for general coherent state |\u03b2\u3009 the term \u3008\u03b2|G(\u03d5)|\u03b2\u3009 (appearing in (11)) has non zero value.\nThermal states will perform worse. So, it is clear that any classical strategy of energy |\u03b2|2 = N is, at best, as effective as a strategy that uses a vacuum state (which is the optimal strategy for zero energy). In contrast, (12) shows that the optimal quantum strategy of energy N has QFI of order N . While this resembles the typical \u221a N enhancement in precision of quantum strategies vs. classical ones in quantum metrology, interestingly it has a different origin than usual: it originates from the fact that any energy devoted to classical strategies is completely useless, rather than from a different allocation of the resources.\nBoth Fock state and squeezed states may help with the problem with noise susceptibility discussed after (7). Indeed, looking at (14) one can see that for large N the probability of getting result 0 is approximately a function of \u223c \u03b12N , so even for extremely small values of the parameter one is able to keep the probability of the result 1 sufficiently large, by increasing the energy.\nWe now comment on the practicalities of the two strategies. On one hand, the Fock state strategy [9, 30] requires that the initial state of the radiation be prepared in |N\u3009. There is no currently known technique to prepare such state for the electromagnetic field which is scalable to high values of N . Then, at the detection stage one must project onto the initial state |N\u3009, which can be implemented with a photon-number resolving photodetector. Such devices exist, but cannot retain effective photon-number resolution to large numbers N of photons. On the other hand, the squeezed state strategy seems more practical, since there is a vast literature for the preparation of squeezed states at different wavelengths spanning from the optical [32] to the microwave [33]. At the detection stage, one must evaluate the probability that the output state of the channel |\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 is equal to a squeezed vacuum, namely p(0|\u03b1) = |\u30080|S\u2020(r)|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009|2, where |r, 0\u3009 = S(r)|0\u3009. This expression can be also interpreted as the calculation of the overlap between the state S\u2020|\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 with the vacuum state |0\u3009, which can be easily implemented: the first is the state obtained by applying the inverse squeezing transformation S\u2020 after the channel and then performing a photodetection. The probability to obtain zero photons at the measurement will give p(0|\u03b1), whereas the probability to obtain one or more photons will give p(1|\u03b1). An avalanche photodiode (APD) or any equivalent avalanche photodetector (e.g. transition edge sensors) will provide such output signal in the ideal case. The whole procedure must be gated so that it is clear when a \u201cno\nclick\u201d must be interpreted as an outcome. It might seem surprising that one must un-squeeze the signal before the detection, since the state preparation involves a squeezing transformation: however, the squeezing, channel application and un-squeezing is equivalent to a (sub-shot noise) effective amplification of the quadrature, whenever the signal is orthogonal to the squeezing. In general, this condition is not warranted but, as shown in the previous section, this is irrelevant: after the averaging over \u03d5, this procedure still performs very well, and it performs optimally for small values of \u03b1, which is the regime of interest.\nOne could think that an alternative detection for the squeezed strategy could be implemented through homodyne detection, by measuring the quadrature of the light consistent with the squeezing phase. While this strategy may be useful in some cases, surprisingly in the regime of small \u03b1, this strategy fails in a way reminiscent of Rayleigh\u2019s curse [21, 24] for the evaluation of the distance of two point sources (while the last problem also may easily described within our formalism by taking |\u03c8\u3009 \u221d exp(\u2212x2/4\u03c32) |x\u3009, G = 1i \u2202x, p(\u03d5) = 12 (\u03b4(\u03d5) + \u03b4(\u03d5 \u2212 \u03c0)); see App. E for broader discussion about relation between these two models)."

However, for \u03b1 = 0, the symmetric logarithmic derivative is simply L = 0, so also FQ(\u03c1\u03b1)|\u03b1=0 = 0. The simple interpretation of this fact is that the state \u03c1\u03b1 does not distinguish between positive and negative values of \u03b1, so any measurement performed on it cannot allow for local estimation of \u03b1 around point \u03b1 = 0 (while for any different point \u03b1 6= 0 local estimation will be possible). It is clear that, in our case, where we consider only non-negative \u03b1, this issue does not appear, so it is reasonable to consider F+Q (\u03c10) instead of FQ(\u03c1\u03b1)|\u03b1=0 = 0.\n6"

Indeed, the maximum likelihood estimator is\n\u03b1\u0303ML(k0, k1) := arg max\u03b1p(k0, k1|\u03b1), (B1)\nwhere k0/1 the number of results 0/1. Therefore, if one has no a priori knowledge on p(\u03d5) we cannot simply assume that the distribution is uniform, as it may lead to a strongly biased estimator. However, one can add an additional random-uniform rotation, so that the overall rotation becomes uniformly distributed. Indeed, assume that \u03d5 is non-uniform distributed with some unknown function p(\u03d5). Add an additional rotation of the initial state U\u03b8 |\u03c8\u3009 as well as a final rotation prior to the measurement U\u03b8\u03a00U \u2020 \u03b8 .

Of course, this is in general a suboptimal strategy, as the mean value of the QFI for uniform distribution may be smaller than the one for the true p(\u03d5). In practice, it will usually be better to spend some resources to find an estimate to p(\u03d5) and then use the rest to estimate \u03b1."

Moreover, we present some Monte-Carlo simulations that show how the squeezed vacuum (and the other states) perform when considering a finite numberM of repetitions of the experiment with randomly varying phase \u03d5 (in the main text we considered the simple case in which the randomization is perfect).\nConsider the multi-cat state [34]\n|catN,\u03b8\u3009 \u221d N\u2211 n=1 | exp(2i\u03c0n/N + i\u03b8)\u03b2\u3009 , (C1)\nnamely a superposition of N coherent states with equispaced phases. As shown in Fig. 2, this is a good approximation for the Fock state already for moderate values of N , and it may be simpler to create in practice: at least for N = 2 it can be created in quantum optics, e.g. [35, 36] or in the microwave regime also for N = 3, 4 [37].\nIn Fig. 3 we consider various states: the coherent state |\u03b2\u3009, the vacuum state |0\u3009, the squeezed state |r, \u03b8\u3009, the multicat |catN,\u03b8\u3009 for different values of N and \u03b8. We plot the overlap\nbetween each of these states and its displaced version after a displacement D(\u03b1,\u03d5) with a fixed phase. A good metrological state is the one that is highly sensitive to \u03b1, namely whose value changes rapidly as a function of \u03b1. In Fig. 4 we present a Monte-Carlo simulation that shows how the randomly varying \u03d5 affects the overlap. As expected (see also Fig. 1), the random phase ruins the metrological sensitivity of the more phase-sensitive states. Yet, in the regime of small \u03b1 we are interested in, the squeezed state |r, 0\u3009 and the two-cat state |catN=2,\u03b8\u3009 still behave as well as the Fock state which is insensitive to \u03d5."

Then one can use a feedback strategy in which one quickly performs an estimate of \u03d5 and then uses it to prepare a squeezed vacuum with squeezing parameter orthogonal to \u03d5. Such a state performs better than the Fock state, as long as the value of \u03d5 is known. Alternatively, instead of first estimating \u03d5 and then using its value in the subsequent measurements, one could also employ multiparameter estimation [38].\nIn essence, the bounds to precision presented in this paper can be beaten under the hypothesis that the random parameter \u03d5 changes sufficiently slowly.\n7"

            "heading": "Appendix E: Quadrature measurement and Rayleigh\u2019s curse",
            "text": "In this section we analyze how a quadrature measurement compares to the projection onto the initial state that was considered in the main text. Surprisingly, we show that, even though this measurement strategy performs well for large values of \u03b1, it does not work well in the regime of asymptotically small \u03b1 we are interested in.\nThis failure mode is somewhat reminiscent of the Rayleigh\u2019s curse in discriminating two point-like sources at\na distance using a finite-aperture lens. It is known that using a quantum optimized detection strategy, the Rayleigh\u2019s curse can be beaten [21]. Analogously, in the estimation of \u03b1 in the regime \u03b1\u2192 0, the quadrature measurement fails, whereas the projection onto the initial state is optimal.\nConsider estimating the value of \u03b1 from measuring the quadrature of the light in a direction consistent with the initial squeezing. I.e. for an initial squeezed state with zero phase, consider the measurement of the zero-phase quadrature, namely\nx\u0302 = 1\u221a 2 (a+ a\u2020) (E1)\nSince \u03d5 is uniformly distributed, the expected value of the quadrature is \u3008x\u0302\u3009 = 0, so \u03b1 cannot be simply estimated from its mean value. Can we use the second moment or the variance \u3008x\u03022\u3009? Consider the observable A = x\u03022. On the squeezed\n8 vacuum, displaced and averaged over \u03d5, we find\n\u3008A\u3009 = \u03b12 + 1 2 e\u22122r, \u3008\u22062A\u3009 = e\u22122r ( 2\u03b12 + 12e \u22122r) , (E2) Error propagation gives:\n\u22062\u03b1\u0303 = \u3008\u22062A\u3009 |\u2202\u03b1 \u3008A\u3009 |2 = e\u22122r(4\u03b12 + e\u22122r) 8\u03b12 . (E3)\nFor \u03b12 e\u22122r we find \u22062\u03b1\u0303 \u2248 12e \u22122r. It means that the variance scales as the inverse of the mean energy of the input state, which is the optimal scaling, as shown in (12). However, for \u03b12 e\u22122r, the variance scales inversely to \u03b12 and goes to infinity for \u03b1 \u2192 0. This is closely related to the Rayleigh curse [21]. In fact, in our problem the output state may be written in following form:\n\u03c1\u03b1 = \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03d5\n2\u03c0 |\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1 | =\u222b \u03c0\n0\nd\u03d5\n\u03c0\n1\n2\n( |\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1 |+ |\u03c8\u03d5+\u03c0\u03b1 \u3009 \u3008\u03c8\u03d5+\u03c0\u03b1 | ) =\u222b \u03c0\n0\nd\u03d5\n\u03c0\n1\n2\n( |\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1 |+ |\u03c8 \u03d5 \u2212\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03c8 \u03d5 \u2212\u03b1| ) .

(E6)\nThe last equation may be proved for any reasonable initial state (the precise criteria will be given later), not only for squeezed vacuum state. Indeed, for the state 1 2 ( |\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1 |+ |\u03c8 \u03d5 \u2212\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03c8 \u03d5 \u2212\u03b1| )\nthe probability of getting the result x has the form\np(x|\u03b1) = Tr(\u03a0x 12 ( |\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03c8\u03d5\u03b1 |+ |\u03c8 \u03d5 \u2212\u03b1\u3009 \u3008\u03c8 \u03d5 \u2212\u03b1| ) ) =\n1 2 (f(x+\n\u221a 2\u03b1 cos(\u03d5)) + f(x\u2212 \u221a 2\u03b1 cos(\u03d5))), (E7)\nwhere f(x) = Tr(\u03a0x |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c8|). This implies\nlim \u03b1\u21920 \u2202p(x|\u03b1) \u2202\u03b1 = 0 \u2200x. (E8)\nSince FC is given by:\nFC =\n\u222b dx 1\np(x|\u03b1) ( \u2202p(x|\u03b1) \u2202\u03b1 )2 , (E9)\nthen equation (E8) does not immediately lead to the conclusion that the CFI vanishes, since we need to pay special attention to the points where also lim\u03b1\u21920 p(x|\u03b1) = 0 (since in principle it may lead to non-zero Fisher information, as in the example discussed in App. A).\nLet us restrict to the functions f(x) which have a continuous second derivative with respect to x. Moreover, let as assume that there exists an integrable function g(x) such that\n\u2200x,\u03b1 1p(x|\u03b1) ( \u2202p(x|\u03b1) \u2202\u03b1 )2 \u2264 g(x) (which is satisfied for both the squeezed vacuum state and the Fock state discussed in this paper). Then, from the dominated convergence theorem\nlim \u03b1\u21920 FC =\n\u222b dx lim\n\u03b1\u21920\n1\np(x|\u03b1) ( \u2202p(x|\u03b1) \u2202\u03b1 )2 . (E10)\nFor any point where f(x) 6= 0, obviously 1 p(x|\u03b1) ( \u2202p(x|\u03b1) \u2202\u03b1 )2 = 0. Where f(x) = 0:\np(x|\u03b1) = cos2(\u03d5)\u03b12\u22022xf(x) +O(\u03b13) \u2202\u03b1p(x|\u03b1) = 2 cos2(\u03d5)\u03b1\u22022xf(x) +O(\u03b12)\n(E11)\nand therefore:\nlim \u03b1\u21920\n1\np(x|\u03b1) ( \u2202p(x|\u03b1) \u2202\u03b1 )2 ={\n0 if f(x) = 0 4 cos2(\u03d5)\u22022xf(x) if f(x) 6= 0 (E12)\nNote, that for any function f(x), which have a continuous second derivative, there could be at least countably many points where simultaneously f(x) = 0 and \u22022xf(x) 6= 0, so the value of the integral (E10) is equal to 0 anyway.\nIn conclusion, in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0, the measurement (3) is much more informative than measuring quadrature, which is, in general a poor measurement in this regime."
