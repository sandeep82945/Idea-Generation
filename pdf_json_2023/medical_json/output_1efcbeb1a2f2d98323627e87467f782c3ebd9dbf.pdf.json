The aim of plasma exchange is to remove putative disease mediators from the circulation, such as toxic macromolecules and pathogenic ANCAs. To our knowledge, we here provide the first report of applying high-dose IVIGs prior to plasma exchange and assessment of ANCA autoantibody elimination in a patient with severe pulmonary renal syndrome due to ANCA-associated vasculitis. After high-dose application of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) prior to plasma exchange treatment, efficacy of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA autoantibody elimination was substantially increased, associated with rapid clearance of MPO-ANCA autoantibodies. High-dose IVIGs resulted in marked reduction of MPO-ANCA autoantibody levels and did not directly affect autoantibody clearance by plasma exchange itself, as also confirmed by comparable MPO-ANCAs in the exchange fluid relative to serum levels. Moreover, measurements of serum creatinine and albuminuria confirmed that high-dose IVIGs were well tolerated and did not exacerbate kidney injury.\nKEYWORDS\nANCA-associated vasculitis, pulmonary renal syndrome, IVIGs, plasma exchange, ANCA clearance\nIntroduction\nThe field of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) has seen considerable progress in understanding of the complexity of pathophysiology, the course of the diseases and importantly therapeutic options, that have been translated into an improved patient survival in the most contemporary cohorts. Plasma exchange (PEX) rapidly depletes pathogenic ANCA autoantibodies and is considered for induction therapy\nfrontiersin.org01\nin severe AAV (1). This is particularly important in patients presenting with severe diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage (DAH) that is immediately life threatening, where rapid ANCA clearance might make a \u201clife or death\u201d difference. The PEXIVAS trial did not find significant survival benefits for PEX in AAV, there is data supporting PEX may reduce the acute mortality of patients presenting with severe DAH, especially in those with MPOANCA positivity (2\u20134). Therefore, PEX is often recommended as an adjunctive therapy in severe cases of AAV presenting with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and/or DAH (5). In this context, it is attractive to speculate that strategies to enhance clearance of pathogenic ANCA autoantibodies might be beneficial especially in severe cases of AAV. Among them, efficacy of highdose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) to decrease circulating ANCA autoantibody levels in AAV patients has already been shown (6, 7). However, direct assessment of efficacy to eliminate ANCA autoantibodies by PEX combined with IVIGs pretreatment in AAV has not been assessed yet. We here pursued an ANCA level-driven approach to determine efficacy of ANCA autoantibody clearance by PEX and additional high-dose IVIGs in severe pulmonary renal syndrome due to AAV."

Four days prior, she presented to an external hospital with arthralgia and developed acute haemoptysis, a bronchoscopy confirmed severe DAH in both upper lobes. At admission, she presented with lung failure requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 153 mmHg), acute kidney injury (serum creatinine of 1.43 mg/dL, reference range: 0.5-1 mg/ dL; eGFR 36 mL/min/1.73 m2, reference range: >60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and albuminuria (953 mg/g creatinine, reference range: <30 mg/ g), and hematuria (Figure 1A and Table 1). Computed tomography (CT) scans showed bilateral ground-glass opacities and severe DAH compatible with pulmonary vasculitis (Figure 1B), a kidney biopsy showed pauc i - immune cre scen t i c ANCA-as soc i a ted glomerulonephritis (Figure 1C), and laboratory testing confirmed presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA autoantibodies (>134 IU/mL, reference range: <3.5 IU/mL, Table 1). Based on the diagnosis of life threatening pulmonary renal syndrome due to AAV, steroid pulse, intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC, 10 mg/ kg body weight) according to the CYCLOPS protocol, and additional PEX treatment (total plasma volume of 3000 mL, Plasauto \u2211 and Plasmaflo OP-08W(L) filter, Asahi Kasei Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were initiated (8). After a total number of six PEX treatments, pulmonary hemorrhage was still present requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 155 mmHg), and a repeated testing for MPO-ANCAs still confirmed high levels outside of the upper range (>134 IU/mL). Direct assessment of MPO-ANCAs before the sixth PEX treatment and two days thereafter showed limited efficacy of circulating MPO-ANCA autoantibody elimination (647 IU/mL to 575 IU/mL, 11% reduction, Figure 1D). After high-dose application of IVIGs (1 g/ kg body weight, 70 g in total, Kiovig 10g/100mL, Takeda Manufacturing Austria AG, Vienna, Austria) two hours prior to the next PEX treatment, efficacy of MPO-ANCA autoantibody elimination was almost doubled (575 IU/mL to 452 IU/mL, 21% reduction, Figure 1D). Based on these observations, IVIGs were administered prior to additional two PEX treatments and resulted in rapid clearance of MPO-ANCA autoantibodies (Figure 1D). Highdose IVIGs resulted in marked reduction of MPO-ANCA autoantibody levels (575 IU/mL to 370 IU/mL, 36% reduction, Figure 1E) and did not directly affect autoantibody clearance by PEX itself, as also confirmed by comparable MPO-ANCAs in the exchange fluid relative to serum levels (Figure 1F). Pulmonary hemorrhage rapidly ceased and mechanical ventilation was no longer required, while high-dose IVIGs were well tolerated not exacerbating kidney injury (Figure 2A). Furthermore, white blood cell (WBC) counts (reference range: 4,000-11,000/\u00b5L), and fibrinogen levels (reference range: 200-393 mg/dL) were stable by using FFP substitution (Figure 2B). During the half year follow-up, the patient finished remission induction therapy with CYC and is currently receiving maintenance therapy with rituximab (RTX). Kidney function recovered (serum creatinine of 0.92 mg/dL, reference range: 0.5-1 mg/dL; eGFR 61 mL/min/1.73 m2, reference range: >60 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria 273 mg/g creatinine,\nfrontiersin.org\nreference range: <30 mg/g). In summary, we here report an enhanced ANCA autoantibody clearance by high-dose IVIGs prior to plasma exchange in a case of severe pulmonary renal syndrome."

Furthermore, the immunoassay results were not reliable as values were outside of the manufacturer\u2019s reference range. Nevertheless, this ANCA level-driven approach might contribute to novel therapeutical strategies to increase efficacy of pathogenic ANCA autoantibody clearance in severe AAV."
