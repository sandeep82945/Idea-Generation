    "abstractText": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells have a great demand for nutrients in the form of sugars, amino acids, and lipids. Particularly, amino acids are critical for cancer growth and, as intermediates, connect glucose, lipid and nucleotide metabolism. PDAC cells meet these requirements by upregulating selective amino acid transporters. Here we show that SLC38A5 (SN2/SNAT5), a neutral amino acid transporter is highly upregulated and functional in PDAC cells. Using CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated knockout of SLC38A5, we show its tumor promoting role in an in vitro cell line model as well as in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Using metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we show significant reduction in many amino acid substrates of SLC38A5 as well as OXPHOS inactivation in response to SLC38A5 deletion. Experimental validation demonstrates inhibition of mTORC1, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in KO cells, suggesting a serious metabolic crisis associated with SLC38A5 deletion. Since many SLC38A5 substrates are activators of mTORC1 as well as TCA cycle intermediates/precursors, we speculate amino acid insufficiency as a possible link between SLC38A5 deletion and inactivation of mTORC1, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, and the underlying mechanism for PDAC attenuation. Overall, we show that SLC38A5 promotes PDAC, thereby identifying a novel, hitherto unknown, therapeutic target for PDAC.",

Here we show that SLC38A5 (SN2/SNAT5), a neutral amino acid transporter is highly upregulated and functional in PDAC cells. Using CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated knockout of SLC38A5, we show its tumor promoting role in an in vitro cell line model as well as in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model.

Experimental validation demonstrates inhibition of mTORC1, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in KO cells, suggesting a serious metabolic crisis associated with SLC38A5 deletion. Since many SLC38A5 substrates are activators of mTORC1 as well as TCA cycle intermediates/precursors, we speculate amino acid insufficiency as a possible link between SLC38A5 deletion and inactivation of mTORC1, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, and the underlying mechanism for PDAC attenuation.

SLC38A5 is a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter which transports asparagine, histidine, glutamine, glycine, serine, and methionine9,10. It transports Na+ and the amino acid substrate in one direction by functionally coupling to the transfer of H+ in the opposite direction. Not much work has been conducted on SLC38A5 and its relevance to cancer except for two papers that talk about its role in PNET, and its relevance to macropinocytosis in triplenegative breast cancer11,12. Based on these literature evidences as well as on the functional features of SLC38A5, we wanted to investigate the role of SLC38A5 in PDAC growth and proliferation. These functional features include its ability to concentrate the amino acid substrates intracellularly while simultaneously removing H+ (cancer cells generate massive amounts of lactic acid, thus increasing H+ levels inside the cells) and preventing intracellular acidification, increasing the pH near the vicinity of the plasma membrane on the cytoplasmic side of the cell in the presence of amino acid substrates thus leading to induction of macropinocytosis (critical nutrient scavenging mechanism for PDAC), transport of glutamine for glutaminolysis (cancer cells are glutamine-addicted) and serine, glycine and methionine for one carbon metabolism required in purine/pyrimidine synthesis6.\nHere we show that SLC38A5 is significantly upregulated in PDAC and the overexpression leads to poor overall survival in PDAC patients. Further characterizing the transporter, we show that SLC38A5 is not just overexpressed at the mRNA level but is also functional in PDAC cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate the tumor promoting role of SLC38A5 in both cell lines and in athymic nude mice. Using metabolomics and RNA-sequencing, we show significant decrease in many of the amino acid substrates of SLC38A5 as well as inactivation of OXPHOS in response to SLC38A5 deletion. In addition to the already known substrates of SLC38A5, we show alanine, cysteine, threonine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, isoleucine and tyrosine as additional SLC38A5 substrates. Delving deeper into the mechanisms associated with PDAC attenuation in response to SLC38A5 deletion, we observe a serious metabolic crisis as evidenced by inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration as well as inhibition of mTORC1 signaling pathway. Amino acid insufficiency is linked to inhibition of mTORC1 as well as suppression of critical glycolytic enzymes13\u201315. Moreover, amino acids function as TCA cycle intermediates/precursors16. Therefore, we speculate amino acid insufficiency as a possible link between SLC38A5 deletion and inhibition of mTORC1, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, thereby uncovering the underlying mechanism for the observed PDAC attenuation. Additionally, we show that SLC38A5 deletion does not lead to a compensatory upregulation of other amino acid transporters. Collectively, we show that SLC38A5 promotes PDAC and therefore could be a novel therapeutic target for PDAC."

            "text": "SLC38A5 is upregulated in PDAC and affects overall patient survival To study the role of SLC38A5 in PDAC growth and development, we first checked its expression profile in PDAC tumors vs normal pancreas using the web-based tool TCGA. SLC38A5 was found to be significantly upregulated at the transcript level in primary tumors of PDAC as opposed to normal pancreas (Fig.\u00a01A). Additionally, we observed that SLC38A5 expression increased with a corresponding increase in the tumor grade (Fig.\u00a01B). More interestingly, we found that PDAC patients with higher SLC38A5 expression had a significantly lower overall survival and vice versa (Fig.\u00a01C). SLC38A3 expression (another system N amino acid transporter within the SLC38 gene family which is very similar to SLC38A5 in terms of substrate selectivity and functionality) remained unchanged (Fig.\u00a01D). Using real-time PCR, we validated these online findings using PDAC cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Capan-1, Capan-2, CFPAC-1, HPAF-II, MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, Panc 10.05, and SU.86.86) and compared them to the levels found in hTERT-HPNE, a normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line. All the cell lines were cultured in complete medium. Four out of ten PDAC cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Capan-1, and HPAF-II) showed a significant increase in SLC38A5 mRNA expression and the fold-increase ranged anywhere from 3 to ~ 600, relative to hTERT-HPNE (Fig.\u00a01E). We further corroborated the cell lines data using nine PDAC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples wherein majority of the PDXs showed a significant increase in SLC38A5 expression wherein the fold-increase ranged from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of ~ 300, relative to hTERT-HPNE (Fig.\u00a01F). SLC38A3 mRNA expression was downregulated in most of the PDAC cell lines (except PANC-1) and all PDXs tested (Fig.\u00a01G,H). Taken together, the online data in conjunction with our laboratory validation clearly demonstrated that SLC38A5, and not SLC38A3, is significantly upregulated in PDAC and that the increased expression is associated with a poor overall patient survival.\nSLC38A5 is also upregulated in PDAC organoids To further substantiate the cell lines and PDXs data, we checked SLC38A5 and SLC38A3 mRNA expression in human PDAC organoids that were cultured in complete medium. Organoids are three-dimensional models and therefore better recapitulate the human disease (Fig.\u00a02A)17\u201320. Real-time PCR conducted in five human PDAC organoids (hT1, hM1A, hM19B, hF23, and hT105) and one normal human pancreatic organoid (hN31) demonstrated that SLC38A5 mRNA is upregulated in all the PDAC organoids tested when compared to the normal organoid (Fig.\u00a02B). On the contrary, SLC38A3 mRNA was found to be comparable to that of hN31, except in hM19B (Fig.\u00a02C). Furthermore, immunofluorescence data showed that the PDAC organoid (hT1) expressed SLC38A5 protein but the normal organoid (hN31) did not (Fig.\u00a02D). Since hT1 was very easy to culture as opposed to other PDAC organoids, it formed the rationale for its selection for immunostaining. Collectively, the data acquired using different models demonstrate that SLC38A5 is indeed upregulated in PDAC whereas SLC38A3 is either unchanged or downregulated in PDAC.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16863 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43983-1\nSLC38A5 is functional in PDAC cell lines To test its functionality, we performed uptake studies in SLC38A5-positive AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Capan-1, and HPAF-II using serine, glutamine, and glycine as the radiolabeled substrates. The uptake was conducted in LiCl buffer as well as in NMDG-Cl buffer containing 5\u00a0mM tryptophan. The difference in the uptake between the LiCl buffer and NMDG-Cl buffer is considered the actual SLC38A5-mediated uptake. Based on the uptake data, it was obvious that the PDAC cell lines tested had functional SLC38A5, as demonstrated by SLC38A5-mediated uptake of serine, glutamine and glycine in the cell lines. While AsPC-1 had a robust SLC38A5-mediated serine uptake (88%) followed by glutamine (42%) and then glycine (17%), BxPC-3 on the other hand had a robust SLC38A5-mediated glutamine uptake (72%) followed by glycine (58%) and then serine (38%). In Capan-1, SLC38A5-mediated glutamine uptake was the maximum (57%) followed by serine (20%), however, no glycine uptake was observed in this cell line. Likewise, HPAF-II had a robust SLC38A5-mediated serine uptake (77%) followed by glutamine (49%) and glycine (49%) uptake (Fig.\u00a03A\u2013C). Taken together, the data indicated that SLC38A5 is not just overexpressed at the mRNA level, but is also functional in PDAC cell lines.\nshRNA-mediated knockdown of SLC38A5 indicates the tumor promoting ability of SLC38A5 To test the tumor promoting role of SLC38A5, shRNA-mediated knockdown of SLC38A5 was performed in HPAF-II cells. Of the five shRNAs tested, TRCN0000044003 demonstrated the most downregulation of SLC38A5 (~ 71%) as evident from the real time PCR data (Fig.\u00a0S1A). Furthermore, the reduction in serine uptake in HPAFII/pLKO.1-PURO/SLC38A5/shRNA (~ 82%) when compared to HPAF-II/pLKO.1-PURO clearly indicated that downregulation of SLC38A5 mRNA also translated to a reduction in its functionality (Fig.\u00a0S1B). Colony formation assay demonstrated that SLC38A5 knockdown had some impact on the clonogenic ability of HPAF-II cells as evident from the lower number of colonies when compared to the control cells (Fig.\u00a0S1C). In the mouse xenograft studies, the difference in the tumor volume between the control and knockout groups were not significantly different (Fig.\u00a0S1D); however, the post-sacrifice tumor weight did show a significant downregulation in the knockout group (Fig.\u00a0S1E). Body weight remained unchanged between both the groups (Fig.\u00a0S1F). Overall, these data did indicate that SLC38A5 might be a tumor promoter, further alluding that a more efficient knockdown/knockout of SLC38A5 would enable us to better understand its role in tumor promotion in PDAC.\nFigure\u00a01.

We began this process by transducing HPAF-II cells separately with the NTC lentivirus and the SLC38A5/KO sgRNA lentivirus. Using real-time PCR, we selected six (1, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 13) out of the fourteen selected clones that had an almost complete knockout of SLC38A5 (Fig.\u00a04A). Furthermore, using radiolabeled serine uptake, we identified clones 4 and 8 to have complete loss of SLC38A5 functionality (Fig.\u00a04B). Using clone 8 thereafter, colony formation assay and invasion assay was performed which clearly demonstrated that loss of SLC38A5\nFigure\u00a02. SLC38A5 is upregulated in PDAC organoids.

Likewise, in the in\u00a0vivo mouse xenograft study, the group of mice injected with HPAF-II/SLC38A5/CRISPR KO cells had a significant reduction in tumor volume when compared to the group injected with HPAF-II/NTC cells (Fig.\u00a04E). The tumor weight that was measured post-sacrifice was found to be significantly reduced in the CRISPR KO group (178 \u00b1 29\u00a0mg) as opposed to the NTC group (509 \u00b1 111\u00a0mg) (Fig.\u00a04F,G). As expected, no significant change was observed in body weight between the NTC and the CRISPR KO groups (Fig.\u00a04H). Taken together, the data clearly demonstrate the tumor-promoting role of SLC38A5.\nMetabolite profiling reveals significant downregulation of many amino acid substrates of SLC38A5 in response to SLC38A5 deletion To understand how SLC38A5 loss attenuates tumor growth in athymic nude mice, we wanted to check the amino acid profile between the control and KO tumors. This could provide us clues to understand tumor attenuation mechanisms associated with SLC38A5 knockout. Amino acids are known activators of mTORC1, a serine/ threonine kinase signaling pathway that is significantly activated in cancer21\u201326. In the past, only leucine, arginine, and methionine were known to activate mTORC1, however, with recent discoveries, it is known that other\nFigure\u00a03. SLC38A5 is functional in PDAC cell lines.

Interestingly, most of these amino acids (asparagine, glutamine, histidine, methionine and serine) are SLC38A5 substrates. Therefore, we hypothesized that SLC38A5 loss would significantly impact the levels of these amino acids in the KO tumors, leading to mTORC1 inactivation, ultimately leading to an overall reduction in tumor growth. To test that, metabolomics was performed in xenograft tumors (n = 10) from HPAF-II/NTC to HPAF-II/ SLC38A5 CRISPR KO. The hierarchical clustered heatmap of the metabolomic data did show distinct clustering of several metabolites either in the NTC or the KO tumors, suggesting a difference in the metabolite profile between the two groups (Fig.\u00a05A). We then focused on the amino acid profile and interestingly, found several amino acids to be significantly reduced, some of them to be upregulated and while the rest remained unchanged in the KO tumors as opposed to the NTC tumors. Focusing on SLC38A5 substrates, we found asparagine and serine levels to be unchanged, glycine and glutamine levels to be upregulated while that of methionine and histidine to be significantly downregulated. More interestingly, other amino acids like isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, valine, threonine, tyrosine, proline, and alanine were significantly downregulated whereas aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were significantly upregulated. On the other hand, leucine, lysine and cysteine remained\nFigure\u00a05.

Because we saw downregulation in many other amino acids apart from the known substrates of SLC38A5, we wanted to test if these downregulated amino acids are also SLC38A5 substrates. For that, radiolabeled serine uptake was conducted in HPAF-II to check for the substrate selectivity, either in the presence or absence of 5\u00a0mM concentration of various amino acids. As expected, we saw ~ 64% inhibition of 3H-serine uptake with asparagine, serine, and histidine, ~ 52% inhibition with methionine and glutamine, and ~ 18% inhibition with glycine, which are all known substrates of SLC38A5 (Fig.\u00a05D). More interestingly, we found significant inhibition of 3H-serine uptake with alanine (62%), which was comparable to that of asparagine, serine, and histidine. Other amino acids that inhibited 3H-serine uptake include cysteine (41%), threonine (37%), valine and proline (21%), phenylalanine (15%), isoleucine and tyrosine (11%). Amino acids that did not inhibit 3H-serine uptake include tyrosine, leucine, lysine, glutamate, arginine and aspartate. Taken together, the data demonstrates that SLC38A5 KO led to a significant reduction in many amino acids and interestingly, most of them are transportable substrates of SLC38A5. Furthermore, it was interesting to observe that five out of the eight amino acids substrates that were downregulated are also mTORC1 activators, suggesting mTORC1 inhibition as one of the possible mechanisms of tumor attenuation in response to SLC38A5 knockout.\nSLC38A5 knockout inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathway and is not associated with a compensatory upregulation of other amino acid transporters The fact that SLC38A5 knockout led to a significant change in the amino acid profile and because many of the downregulated amino acids were the ones that activate mTORC1, we wanted to check whether this change actually resulted into mTORC1 pathway inhibition. To test that, western blotting was performed in 10 of the NTC tumors and 9 of the SLC38A5/CRISPR KO tumors. As a read-out for activation of mTORC1 pathway, we checked for the phosphorylation status of p70 S6K1 and 4EBP1. Increased phosphorylation of these downstream effectors of mTORC1 would indicate activation of the pathway28,29. SLC38A5 knockout inhibited phosphorylation of both S6K1 and 4EBP1 indicating inhibition of mTORC1 signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a06A). To further corroborate this data, we also checked the phosphorylation status of eIF4E. When mTORC1 is activated, it can phosphorylate 4EBP1, causing it to dissociate from eIF4E which then enables interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G and eIF4A, thus initiating polypeptide synthesis. However, when mTORC1 is inhibited, 4EBP1 can bind competitively with eIF4E, inhibit its interaction with eIF4G and thus inhibit translation30. Western blotting demonstrated that knockout of SLC38A5 inhibited eIF4E phosphorylation, further supporting the fact that mRNA translation was inhibited. Furthermore, mTORC1 phosphorylation was also inhibited. Total protein for all the targets remained mostly unchanged (Fig.\u00a06A). Together, the data clearly indicated that SLC38A5 knockout inhibited mTORC1 signaling pathway, thereby attenuating PDAC growth.\nTo test whether SLC38A5 knockout led to a compensatory upregulation of other amino acid transporters (AATs), we performed real-time PCR in 10 NTC tumors and 10 SLC38A5/CRISPR KO tumors to check for the mRNA expression of 15 AATs. The AATs tested included neutral amino acid transporters (SLC1A4, SLC1A5, SLC6A19, SLC7A5, SLC38A1, SLC38A2, SLC38A3, SLC38A4 and SLC43A2), neutral and cationic AATs (SLC6A14, SLC7A6, SLC7A7, and SLC7A9), and neutral, cationic and anionic AAT (SLC38A7)7,8,31,32. These AATs were selected based on the fact that they also transport neutral amino acids including the ones that are transportable substrates for SLC38A5. Our rationale was that when SLC38A5 is deleted, the cancer cells would find a way to upregulate any of these transporter/transporters to compensate for the loss. Contrary to our belief, we found the mRNA expression of 5 of the AATs (SLC6A19, SLC7A9, SLC38A1, SLC38A2, SLC38A4) tested to be significantly downregulated with the exception of SLC43A2, whose expression was found to be significantly upregulated (Fig.\u00a06B). More interestingly, the expression pattern of the remaining AATs was either unchanged or exhibited a downregulation trend. SLC38A3 expression was undetectable in the KO tumors (data not shown). Therefore, it was interesting to observe that SLC38A5 knockout either did not change or reduced the expression of the majority of the AATs tested, with the exception of SLC43A2. SLC43A2, also known as LAT4 transports methionine, isoleucine, leucine and phenylalanine33. Overall, the data indicate that SLC38A5 knockout inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathway and is not associated with a compensatory upregulation of other AATs, implicating these as the plausible reason for the significant attenuation of tumor growth in the athymic nude mice.\nRNA sequencing reveals significant impact on oxidative phosphorylation following SLC38A5 knockout Having identified mTORC1 signaling pathway inactivation as a mechanism for tumor attenuation in response to SLC38A5 knockout, we were curious to identify additional pathways or targets that could function either independently or in conjunction with mTORC1 pathway, to reduce tumor growth in PDAC. To test that, we performed RNA sequencing using the HPAF-II/NTC (n = 3) and HPAF-II/SLC38A5-CRISPR KO (n = 3) xenograft tumors. Using the IPA software, we checked the canonical pathways that are likely activated or inhibited in response to SLC38A5 knockout. A total of 20 enriched canonical pathways were identified by applying the \u2212 log (p-value) > 2 threshold (Fig.\u00a0S2). Many signaling pathways that are associated with tumor growth and promotion were significantly inhibited; however, the most striking pathway was the mitochondrial dysfunction, and the OXPHOS inactivation in the KO tumors (Fig.\u00a07A). Mitochondrial dysfunction had a \u2212 log (p-value) of 7.935 and a Z-score of 3.938. Likewise, for OXPHOS the \u2212 log (p-value) was 3.44 and the Z-score was \u2212 4.315. Focusing more on the OXPHOS, KEGG analysis was performed. The gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), random ES distribution and the heat map clearly exemplifies the genes that are deregulated in OXPHOS in response to SLC38A5 KO (Fig.\u00a07B\u2013D). Thereafter, we wanted to experimentally validate that OXPHOS was in fact significantly impacted in SLC38A5 KO tumors, which could in turn be the other mechanism in addition to suppression of mTORC1 signaling pathway contributing to PDAC attenuation. For that, real-time PCR was conducted in NTC and SLC38A5/ KO tumors (n = 10) to test for the mitochondrial genes that are specific for mitochondrial respiratory complex I\n8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16863 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43983-1\n(NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase genes), complex II (SDH: succinate dehydrogenase subunits), complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase complex subunits), complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase genes) and Complex V (ATP synthase genes). The lists of genes tested were selected based on the RNA-sequencing data. It was very interesting to note that all the genes tested in all the 5 mitochondrial complexes were significantly downregulated (Fig.\u00a07E\u2013I). To test whether this reduction in mRNA expression also translated into proteins, western blotting was conducted. Using the OXPHOS antibodies cocktail, we monitored the level of one protein from each of the five mitochondrial respiratory complexes i.e., NDUFB8 (Complex I), SDHB (Complex II), UQCRC2 V (Complex III), COXII (Complex IV), and ATP5A (Complex V). Interestingly, significant reduction was seen in the protein level of SDHB, UQCRC2, and COXII that belong to mitochondrial respiratory complex II, III, and IV, respectively. NDYFB8 and ATP5A from complex I and V remained unchanged (Fig.\u00a07J). Taken together, the\nFigure\u00a06.

This could have affected the functional efficiency of the OXPHOS metabolic pathway, resulting into reduced ATP output and ultimately attenuation of PDAC growth.\nSLC38A5 knockout significantly decreases both mitochondrial respiration as well as glucose metabolism in PDAC cells The classical definition of mitochondrial dysfunction is the inability of mitochondria to sustain ATP synthesis sufficient to satisfy cellular demands34. Though it is known that mitochondrial dysfunction exhibits many faces, causes, and consequences, at least in the context of SLC38A5 knockout, OXPHOS seems to be significantly impacted. Therefore, we wanted to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a readout to investigate the effects of SLC38A5 knockout on the metabolic phenotype of PDAC cells. To test that, HPAF-II/NTC cells and HPAF-II/SLC38A5/CRISPR-KO cells were used. Cancer cells are known to shift their energetic metabolism from mitochondrial respiration to aerobic glycolysis35,36. Since OXPHOS was impacted in SLC38A5 KO cells, we hypothesized that there will be a reciprocal relationship between OCR and ECAR. Contrary to our belief, we found both OCR and ECAR to be significantly decreased in SLC38A5/KO cells as opposed to the NTC cells (Fig.\u00a08). Reduction in OCR was indicated by decrease in basal OCR and spare respiratory capacity, decreased ATP production and inhibition of maximal respiration. Likewise, reduction in ECAR was demonstrated by reduced ECAR under basal glycolysis, lower percentage of ECAR from basal glycolysis, and reduced ECAR of compensatory glycolysis. Taken together, the data suggest that SLC38A5 KO leads to a profound metabolic crisis in the KO cells, impacting both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, ultimately leading to attenuation of PDAC growth."

While many SLC38A5 substrates were downregulated, glutamine and glycine levels were upregulated. Since many AATs identify glutamine and glycine as their substrates, it is possible that in spite of SLC38A5 KO, PDAC cells are able to maintain their concentration, in fact at a higher level to compensate for the loss of amino acids. We also demonstrate that apart from the known substrates, SLC38A5 also identifies alanine, threonine, cysteine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, and isoleucine as additional substrates, clearly explaining the profound reduction in amino acid levels in the KO tumors.\nFurthermore, we show mTORC1 inhibition as a consequence of SLC38A5 KO. In the past, only three amino acids viz., leucine, arginine, and methionine were known to activate mTORC1; however, with recent discoveries, it is known that other amino acids like alanine, asparagine, glutamine, histidine, serine, threonine, and valine also activate mTORC1. Since many of these amino acids are SLC38A5 substrates and since their levels were reduced in the KO tumors, it makes sense as to why mTORC1 pathway was inhibited in the KO tumor samples. Furthermore, our results showing lack of compensatory upregulation by other AATs seems important, though perplexing. There could be myriad of reasons; however, we speculate inhibition of mTORC1 signaling pathway associated with SLC38A5 KO as a possible explanation. mTORC1 signaling pathway is regulated by amino acids and therefore it is possible that the synthesis of many of these transporters could be regulated by mTORC1. However, these possibilities require further validation. Nevertheless, this is an interesting finding suggesting that KO of SLC38A5 alone should be able to diminish the expression of these AATs simultaneously. Not much is known about these AATs and their relevance to PDAC except SLC38A2, which is activated in PDAC cells to fuel their alanine demands41. On the other hand, SLC43A2/LAT4 was upregulated in the KO tumors. SLC43A2 transports methionine and it has been specifically shown that upregulation of this transporter in tumor cells depletes methionine in the tumor microenvironment leading to T-cell depletion and tumor evasion33. Therefore, this could be an effort by the KO tumors to compensate for the loss of SLC38A5. However, the fact that SLC43A2 substrate (methionine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, and leucine) levels were still lower, suggests that upregulating SLC43A2 itself is not enough to compensate for the loss of SLC38A5.\nSLC38A5 KO significantly downregulates OXPHOS-associated genes and proteins. Functionally, we show inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration indicating that SLC38A5 KO leads to a serious metabolic crisis. Could deficiency of amino acids lead to these consequences? Amino acids are used for protein synthesis or oxidized as energy sources. They serve as precursors of many important metabolites that regulate gene expression, post-translational modifications of proteins and cell fate. Literature evidence shows that amino acid deficiency lowers mitochondrial membrane potential and leads to early onset of mitochondrial respiratory quiescence\nFigure\u00a08.

The lack of amino acids in the cell is sensed by general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2), which has a high affinity to uncharged tRNAs. Upon binding to an uncharged tRNA, GCN2 undergoes a conformational change, gets activated and inhibits phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), and prevents translation initiation under amino acid deficiency. Processes such as glucose uptake, nucleic acid synthesis and, of course, protein synthesis are rapidly compromised due to amino acid deficiency. Interestingly, studies have shown that deficiency of essential amino acids inhibit phosphofructokinase (PFK1) enzyme by uncharged tRNA, leading to accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, a potent inhibitor of hexokinase which promotes glucose uptake by phosphorylation14,15,42\u201345. Since SLC38A5 KO leads to a significant reduction in the essential amino acids level, this could be the possible explanation for reduction in OXPHOS protein expression as well as inhibition of glycolysis. Literature evidence has also shown that loss of SLC38A2 leads to profound compartmentalized metabolic crisis wherein both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration is inhibited in the PDAC cells41. We see similar effects except alanine is one among many amino acids inhibited in response to SLC38A5 KO. Therefore, we speculate amino acid deficiency as the possible link connecting mTORC1 inhibition as well as inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration as mechanisms resulting in PDAC attenuation post SLC38A5 KO. We further speculate that SLC38A5 KO inhibited macropinocytosis further contributing to amino acid loss, thereby attenuating PDAC growth. These speculations, however, require validation.\nTaken together, we show that SLC38A5 is significantly upregulated in PDAC and its knockout significantly attenuates tumor growth. Mechanistically, we show SLC38A5 KO significantly inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathway as well as inactivates glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Our laboratory has also identified SLC6A14, another AAT as a novel PDAC target46,47. Therefore, SLC38A5 could be equally invaluable as SLC6A14 in targeting PDAC, however, their relative contribution to PDAC needs further validation."

            "text": "Radiolabeled uptake studies were performed as described previously47. SLC38A5 is a Na+-coupled transporter with the involvement of H+ movement in the opposite direction and therefore the transporter-mediated uptakes were done at pH 8.5 to create an outwardly directed H+ gradient across the plasma membrane. Since the transportable substrate of SLC38A5 i.e., serine, glycine and glutamine (used in the current experiment) are also transported by several Na+-coupled amino acid transporters, making it difficult to measure the actual functional contribution of SLC38A5, the uptake was conducted using LiCl containing buffer instead of NaCl. SLC38A5 is Li+ tolerant while the other amino acid transporters are not. The composition of the uptake buffer was 25\u00a0mM Tris/Hepes, pH 8.5, containing 140\u00a0mM LiCl, 5.4\u00a0mM KCl, 1.8\u00a0mM CaCl2, 0.8\u00a0mM MgSO4 and 5\u00a0mM glucose. Additionally, the amino acid substrates for SLC38A5 are also substrates for SLC7A5 (LAT1), which is a Na+-independent amino acid transporter; therefore, uptake via this transporter will contribute to the total uptake measured in the LiCl-containing buffer. To suppress SLC7A5-mediated uptake, the uptake buffer contained 5\u00a0mM tryptophan to compete with and block the transport of SLC38A5 substrates, which is mediated by SLC7A5. SLC38A5 does not transport tryptophan and therefore SLC38A5-mediated uptake is not affected by tryptophan. To determine the contribution of diffusion to the total uptake of amino acids, the same uptake buffer but with LiCl replaced isosmotically with N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (NMDGCl) was used. The uptake was measured in 2 buffers; (i) LiCl-buffer, pH 8.5 with 5\u00a0mM tryptophan and, (ii) NMDGCl-buffer, pH 8.5 with 5\u00a0mM tryptophan. The difference in the uptake between the two buffer conditions reflects the actual SLC38A5-mediated uptake."
