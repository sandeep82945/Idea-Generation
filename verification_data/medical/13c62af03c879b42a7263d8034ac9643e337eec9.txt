"To address these challenges, potential solutions include improving manufacturing processes to reduce costs and working with regulatory agencies to streamline the approval process by developing specific guidelines for these wound dressings. It is also important to consider the future perspectives and scope of improvement in this field. Novel materials hold the potential for providing real-time monitoring of wound healing and improving scalability. In addition, there is potential for these wound dressings to be applied beyond wound care, such as in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. By collaborating with manufacturers to improve production efficiency and reduce costs, nanomaterial-impregnated wound dressings could become more widely available and affordable on the market. Furthermore, integrating these wound dressings into telemedicine platforms could provide remote monitoring of wounds and improve patient outcomes."
