 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate how different net metering tariff designs impact the proposed two-part pricing mechanism and community welfare. The current paper assumes a generalized NEM design, but other designs like net billing or buy-all/sell-all could lead to different pricing behaviors and outcomes.

2. Explore alternative objective functions for the community manager, such as maximizing renewable penetration or minimizing carbon emissions, and how that impacts the optimal two-part pricing.

3. Evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism under different operating envelope constraints, such as dynamic vs static constraints, to see the impact on pricing and welfare.

4. Study the integration of energy storage into the community and its effect on the two-part pricing model and the value of community participation. Energy storage could help shift loads to maximize use of renewables.

5. Analyze the mechanism under different community member utility functions and elasticity of demand to see how customer behavior affects community welfare and pricing outcomes. Less elastic demand could impact the pricing model.
