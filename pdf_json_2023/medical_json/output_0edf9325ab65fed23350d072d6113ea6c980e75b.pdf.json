            "text": "Kerr-Induced Synchronization of a Cavity Soliton to an Optical Reference for Integrated Frequency Comb Clockworks\nGre\u0301gory Moille,1, 2, \u2217 Jordan Stone,1, 2 Michal Chojnacky,1, 3 Curtis Menyuk,4 and Kartik Srinivasan1, 2\n1Joint Quantum Institute, NIST/University of Maryland, College Park, USA 2Microsystems and Nanotechnology Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, USA\n3Sensor Science Division,, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, USA 4University of Maryland at Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA\n(Dated: December 15, 2023)\nThe phase-coherent frequency division of a stabilized optical reference laser to the microwave domain is made possible by optical frequency combs (OFCs). Fundamentally, OFC-based clockworks rely on the ability to lock one comb tooth to this reference laser, which probes a stable atomic transition. The active feedback process associated with locking the comb tooth to the reference laser introduces complexity, bandwidth, and power requirements that, in the context of chip-scale technologies, complicate the push to fully integrate OFC photonics and electronics for fieldable clock applications. Here, we demonstrate passive, electronics-free synchronization of a microresonator-based dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) OFC to a reference laser. We show that the Kerr nonlinearity within the same resonator in which the DKS is generated enables phase locking of the DKS to the externally injected reference. We present a theoretical model to explain this Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS), and find that its predictions for the conditions under which synchronization occur closely match experiments based on a chip-integrated, silicon nitride microring resonator. Once synchronized, the reference laser is effectively an OFC tooth, which we show, theoretically and experimentally, enables through its frequency tuning the direct external control of the OFC repetition rate. Finally, we examine the short- and long-term stability of the DKS repetition rate and show that the repetition rate stability is consistent with the frequency division of the expected optical clockwork system.\nOptical frequency combs (OFCs) are unique metrological tools that provide a phase-coherent link between the optical and microwave domains, and serve as the basis for many metrology applications, such as optical synthesizers [1, 2] and distance ranging [3, 4]. Furthermore, OFCs are essential components in time-keeping applications [5]. Although a microwave frequency Cs atomic clock continues to be the primary standard that defines the second [6], the ability to improve clock performance has led to the use of atoms having energy transitions in the optical spectrum [7]. For optical atomic clocks, a stable laser, referred to as the reference laser in this work, is locked to this optical frequency transition [8\u201310]. Direct electronic measurement of the locked laser frequency is usually not possible, so an OFC is employed as an optical-to-microwave frequency divider [11]. The clock output can be determined by measuring the OFC repetition rate directly, which carries the reference laser stability [12, 13]. Recently, the advent of integrated photonics has made optical clockwork utilizing an OFC available onchip [14, 15]. The integrated photonics OFC is typically realized in a microring resonator through the creation of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS), in which the material\u2019s third-order nonlinearity is employed to convert a continuous wave (CW) optical pump into a single solitary pulse traveling throughout the cavity [16]. The periodic extraction of this soliton forms a pulse train in the bus waveguide, which yields the OFC via Fourier relationship. Recently, octave-spanning on-chip OFCs [17\u201319] whose\n\u2217 gmoille@umd.edu\nspectral extent reaches atomic transitions [20] have been experimentally demonstrated, enabling a direct interface with the reference laser. Whether the OFCs are on a chip or not, the clockwork for optical frequency division using them entails the active locking of a single OFC comb tooth to the reference laser, where the beat note is recorded and stabilized using an active feedback loop to the OFC external degrees of freedom (often its pump current and frequency). Though there has been much progress in developing electronics associated with OFC applications [21, 22], the power budget and limited bandwidth associated with such active stabilization represents a significant barrier to full integration of an optical clock, even if the power required to optically drive the integrated OFC can be extremely low [23].\nIn this work, we show that injecting the reference laser into a DKS microresonator \u2013 hence turning it into another pump for the DKS system \u2013 allows for all-optical, passive Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) between the OFC and the reference laser. Nonlinear Kerr phase locking of the DKS to the reference pump laser is demonstrated by using a microresonator with the appropriate dispersion for exhibiting a dispersive wave at the reference pump frequency. We investigate the system\u2019s nonlinear dynamics, where the experimental findings exhibit excellent agreement with the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Additionally, we derive an expanded Adler equation that describes the requirements for synchronization and its behavior. When synchronized, the reference pump is effectively part of the DKS, and we accordingly show that the DKS repetition rate may be adjusted on demand by detuning the reference pump, with the resulting repetition rate tunar X iv :2\n30 5.\n02 82\n5v 3\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. op\ntic s]\n1 4\nD ec\n2 02\n3\ning in accordance with a frequency division ratio set by the separation between the reference pump and the DKSgenerating laser. Finally, we demonstrate that this passive Kerr-induced synchronization is compatible with clock operation by showing both division of the phase stability of the reference laser onto the OFC repetition rate and the division of the long-term stability.\nThe analogy between optical and mechanical clockworks is frequently used [5], with the OFC portrayed as a set of gears [Fig. 1]. To better understand the context of our work, it is compelling to consider the development of the mechanical pendulum clock, as exemplified by Shortt\u2019s implementation [24], which achieved the highest accuracy for clocks in its era. By actively locking a follower pendulum to a reference vacuum-sealed pendulum not connected to a clockwork, the reference avoids mechanical damping, which is the primary factor contributing to the poor long-term stability of the pendulum [Fig. 1a]. Essentially, the same architecture as Shortt\u2019s is replicated by contemporary OFC clockworks. One can consider synchronization as an alternative to active locking, as Huygens famously established that direct synchronization between two pendulums could happen if a straightforward coupling\nmechanism is offered [Fig. 1(b)]. However, this mechanical architecture offers poor long-term stability because of the coupling\u2019s increased clock damping. While the similarities to the history of mechanical clockworks are compelling, an important distinction with respect to optical clocks is in the damping mechanisms. In particular, optical nonlinearities, which are mostly lossless, can be used to produce the coupling necessary for long-term synchronization. Indeed, such nonlinear synchronization has been observed, for example in counter-propagating DKSs in a microresonator [25]. Therefore, in analogy with a mechanical clockwork, designing an OFC architecture that passively synchronizes the reference laser and the OFC through Kerr-induced nonlinear coupling should be possible. This would significantly reduce optical clock complexity, size, and power requirements.\nBefore delving into the experimental findings, it is necessary to recall the DKS behavior under various driving conditions. The group and phase velocity are the two fundamental characteristics of the DKS. The repetition rate \u03c9rep arises from the former, and specifies the temporal separation between two extracted pulses in the bus waveguide. The DKS phase velocity is connected to the\ncarrier-envelope offset (CEO), which is a phase slip \u03c6(t) of the rapid oscillation below the envelope for each extracted pulse, and results in the CEO frequency \u03c9ceo = \u2202\u03c6/\u2202t [Fig. 2(a)]. When the reference pump laser is injected in the cavity, a secondary pulse is created that is locked to the DKS by cross phase modulation (XPM), so that a multi-color soliton (MDKS) is created that moves at a single group velocity in the microresonator [26, 27]. As a result of the single group velocity MDKS, any comb formed around the reference pump will have the same \u03c9rep as the DKS OFC. To accomplish effective power transfer inside the cavity, the reference must be on resonance when it is injected into the microring. However, the two components of the MDKS will in general have different phase velocities that are determined by cavity dispersion, leading to a non-zero CEO frequency shift between these two comb components \u2126 = \u03c9ref \u2212\u03c9\u00b5,s = \u2202\u03a6/\u2202t [Fig. 2(b) - top], where \u03a6 = \u03c6ref \u2212\u03c6dks, and \u03c9\u00b5,s is the frequency at mode \u00b5s (the comb tooth closest to the reference pump frequency). It has been demonstrated that this phase velocity mismatch can be utilized to produce coherent optical parametric oscillation in the phase velocity domain, yielding an ultra-broadband comb through spectral extension [28] or even cascading to form a so-called two-dimensional comb [27], where each comb component exhibits the same repetition rate with a constant frequency offset between them [Fig. 2(b)]. These demonstrations are intriguing, but by definition, systems exhibiting \u2126 = \u2202\u03a6/\u2202t \u0338= 0 are not synchronized. As a result, the OFC is not phase synchronized to the reference pump, and such a system cannot be used as a coherent clockwork. When the reference and the DKS are synchronized, \u2202\u03a6/\u2202t = 0 [Fig. 2(c)], and no frequency offset is observable. In this situation, it becomes impossible to distinguish between one of the DKS comb teeth and the reference pump as the latter effectively becomes a comb tooth. Until now, multi-driving of a DKS has only been observed when the primary and secondary combs are unsynchronized [27\u201330] and when\nsoliton crystals are generated [31, 32]. Here, we investigate the specific conditions to achieve phase locking and demonstrate its appearance.\nSynchronization between oscillators can be understood using an Adler equation, for which an extended version can be obtained for a DKS under multiple driving fields (see supplementary material Section S-1), such that:\n\u2212 1 \u03ba\n\u22022\u03a6\n\u2202t2 \u2212 \u2202\u03a6 \u2202t = Dint(\u00b5s) + \u2206\u2212 T sin (\u03a6) (1)\nwith \u00b5 the azimuthal order referenced to the main pump, \u2206 = \u03b4\u03c9ref + \u00b5sD1(\u00b50)(1\u2212KNL \u2212K0) the effective reference pump detuning with \u03b4\u03c9ref being the detuning of the reference pump, K0 = 2|A(\u00b50)| EDKS \u221a Pmain\u03baext \u03ba2 the normalized XPM phase shift induced by the mode \u00b5j, Pref and Edks are the power and energy of the reference and the DKS respectively, D1(\u00b5j) is the linear free spectral range at the azimuthal component \u00b5j,KNL accounts for the cross-phase modulation induced by the MDKS (see Section S-1), \u03ba and \u03baext are the total and coupling losses, respectively, \u00b5s is the azimuthal mode at which the reference is synchro-\nnized, and T = D1(\u00b5s)\u00b5s 2|A(\u00b5s)|EDKS \u221a Pref\u03baext \u03ba2 is the effective natural torque of the system. Eq. (1) is similar to the equation that is obtained for counter-propagating DKSs [25], though in our work the synchronization is provided by an external driving force rather than another intra-cavity state. The synchronization state occurs when the left-hand side of Eq. (1) is null, and hence Dint(\u00b5s) must be compensated either by the nonlinear shift or the reference pump detuning. Although it is theoretically possible to achieve this with a large CEO offset from Dint(\u00b5s) that can be compensated by XPM, the complex balance of the phase shift at \u00b5s (K\u00b5,s) and the high power involved would render experimental demonstration challenging. Therefore, minimizing Dint(\u00b5s) allows minimization of the reference power for which the synchronization effect still happens. It has been demonstrated that integrated microring\nresonators can produce an octave-spanning comb, partly due to the generation of dispersive waves (DWs) produced by phase-matching cavity resonances with the DKS. High order dispersion terms become commensurate with the the group velocity dispersion, such that the integrated dispersion Dint(\u00b5) = \u2211 k>1 Dk k! \u00b5\nk = \u03c9res(\u00b5) \u2212 (\u03c9pmp + D1\u00b5) presents multiple zero crossings. These zero-crossings are necessarily phased matched with the DKS since \u03c9res(\u00b5DW) = \u03c9dks(\u00b5DW), creating an oscillatory tail bound to the DKS at the azimuthal component \u00b5DW. In the OFC, it results in a net gain for the comb lines around \u00b5DW. Beyond providing sufficient power in the comb lines of interest to achieve octave-spanning operation, DWs also highlight resonant modes that are nearly phase-matched with the DKS. Thus, Dint(\u00b5s) is minimized at the DW mode, allowing for synchronization to occur, while also letting the reference pump be in the normal dispersion regime where soft-excited bright DKS states cannot be generated. This prevents both multi-DKS states and modulational instability states directly driven by the reference pump.\nOur system under study is a resonator with a 23 \u00b5m outer radius that is made of H = 670 nm thick Si3N4 with a ring width of RW = 830 nm embedded in SiO2. It has an anomalous dispersion when pumped at 286 THz (1048 nm), and this design yields an octave-spanning band-\nwidth while reaching the rubidium two-photon transition at \u2248 386 THz[9, 20]. We characterize the dispersion of the fundamental transverse electric mode of the cavity using multiple continuously tunable lasers (CTLs) and calibrate each resonance using a wavemeter. The obtained experimental Dint(\u00b5) matches with the expected design and finite element method (FEM) simulation, exhibiting a low-frequency DW at \u03c9DW/2\u03c0 \u2248 194 THz (1544 nm), which corresponds to \u00b5DW = \u221292 [Fig. 3(a)]. Although a high-frequency DW should also exist, the waveguide pulley coupler length Lc = 28 \u00b5m is chosen to optimize couplings at both the pump and the low-frequency DW for efficient reference pump injection. To this end, the high-frequency coupling has been sacrificed, and this DW will not be observed in the experimental frequency comb extracted into the waveguide (though it should exist inside the cavity). We actively cool the resonator using a counter-propagative cross-polarized 308 THz (974 nm) laser, allowing for adiabatic detuning of the pump to reach the single DKS state [27, 33, 34], which we obtain with an on-chip pump power of about 150 mW. To probe the synchronization of the system, we use a CTL which we can park at different resonant modes \u00b5 and adjust its detuning finely to study the impact of \u03b4\u03c9ref . Optically, a large change of behavior is observed with varying \u03b4\u03c9ref [Fig. 3(b)]. When the reference is precisely on resonance\n[Fig. 3(b) - on resonance case], the comb lines around \u00b5DW are maximized and have an offset that is larger than the 4 GHz resolution of the optical spectrum analyzer, This case enables the generation of a 2D comb [27], and is an unsynchronized state. Adjusting \u03b4\u03c9ref first reduces these comb lines, decreasing the value of \u2126 = \u03c9ref \u2212 \u03c9\u00b5,s, before the comb lines then increase again, suggestive of a synchronized system. Due to the coherent nature of the system and that the DKS comb and the XPM-induced one from the reference pump are merging, the power at each azimuthal component sums up and explains the increases in the comb line power in the overlap region [Fig. 3(b) - sync case]. A detuning from the resonance is needed to enter synchronization for two main reasons. First, there is the existence of a nonlinear phase shift that requires compensation by \u03b4\u03c9ref , as predicted by the Adler equation (Eq. 1). Secondly, because Dint(\u00b5) is discrete, it will not precisely be zero at the DW mode.\nWe proceed to record \u2126 \u2013 obtained by measuring the comb with a fast photodiode and processed with an electrical spectral analyzer \u2013 with the reference pump detuning \u03b4\u03c9ref [Fig. 3(c)], to demonstrate the synchronization dynamics of the system. The reference pump is centered at \u00b5 = \u221292 and has \u2248 2 mW of on-chip power. Out of synchronization, the OFC that is observed has interleaved comb components, each with a different CEO, induced by \u2202\u03a6/\u2202t \u0338= 0 and as observed in refs. [27\u201330]. Experimen-\ntally, a beat note \u2126 is recorded in the electrical domain between the two components, with a linear dependence on the reference external laser detuning [Fig. 3(c), red dashed line]. Higher harmonics n\u00d7 \u2126 are also expected once \u2126 becomes small enough, which is the signature of the recently observed two-dimensional comb [27]. Yet, the linear trend becomes hyperbolic once the laser is adjusted sufficiently close to the Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) window. Appleton first observed this behavior in his triode oscillator synchronization experiment [35], and it is a signature of the onset of synchronization. We find that \u2126 vanishes, indicating that KIS has occurred, over a range of \u2248 1.75 GHz of reference pump frequency tuning. We also find that the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) model under multi-driving fields introduced in ref. [36] captures this KIS behavior accurately. In that work, though the second pump was situated in anomalous dispersion, which greatly limits experimental demonstration in contrast to pumping at the DW mode, the authors theoretically showed that that an external laser different from the main pump may become a comb tooth, allowing for control of the repetition rate. Using the pyLLE freeware [37], we reproduce the experimental observation of the CEO offset by periodically extracting the DKS every-round trip (as in the experiment) and probing the frequency difference in CEO between the comb components (see Methods). We proceed to measure different azimuthal modes \u00b5 for\n6 the reference pump [Fig. 3(e)]. From the extended Adler equation presented in Eq. (1), one can extract the maxi-\nmum locking window to be \u2206\u03c9lock \u221d \u221a |A\u00b5,s|2Pref , which is proportional to the reference pump power and also to the \u00b5th DKS component power, to which the reference pump locks. Therefore, increasing the on-chip reference pump power up to about 3 mW increases the reference detuning window for which the system is synchronized. Probing modes around the DW enables power variation of the DKS azimuthal component under study. As phase matching is obtained at the DW, the neighboring modes will only exhibit lower comb tooth power [Fig. 3(d)]. Thus, the KIS window is reduced for the same reference power. We note that we have normalized the detuning relative to the center of the KIS window, as under DKS operation, obtaining the exact resonance position is experimentally challenging. All the measurements have been performed with a reference pump detuning from red (lower frequency) to blue (higher frequency). The same synchronization effect happens with a reversed detuning direction, where a hysteris behavior in the Arnold tongue frequency is observed (see Supplementary Material Section S-3).\nSince \u2202\u03a6/\u2202t = 0 in the KIS state, any fluctuations in the reference frequency are divided onto the repetition rate such that \u2202(\u03b4\u03c9ref)/\u2202\u03c9 = \u00b5s\u2202\u03c9rep/\u2202\u03c9, assuming that the main pump is fixed (see Supplementary Material Section S-1). As a result, the azimuthal mode difference \u00b5s between the primary pump and the reference pump defines the frequency division factor in this dualpinned comb. Therefore, by adjusting the detuning of the reference pump while synchronizing with the DKS, one could adjust its repetition rate without interfering with the main pump parameters [Fig. 4(a)]. Although the extended Adler equation itself provides a prediction of such frequency division and disciplining of the repetition rate with the reference pump detuning, we verify this behavior directly using the LLE model [Fig. 4(b)]. We tune the reference pump around the azimuthal mode \u00b5s = \u221289 and extract the repetition rate (see Methods for the simulation protocol). When the KIS state is reached, the closest comb tooth to the reference pump is pulled to exactly match the reference pump frequency, creating a sharp modification of \u03c9rep. The DKS repetition rate then follows a linear trend with the reference detuning up to the edge of the synchronization window. The repetition rate slope with the reference pump detuning follows the expected value for frequency division, which is the number of azimuthal modes between the main (\u00b5p = 0) and reference pump modes (\u00b5s = \u221289). We verify the slope for different azimuthal modes and find that the slope always equals the frequency division rate \u00b5s expected from the extended Adler equation.\nIn order to experimentally demonstrate such an effect, we must accurately measure the repetition rate of the OFC, which is generally not directly achievable with an octave-spanning microcomb. For an OFC to span over an octave in an on-chip format, the repetition rate must be high, here about 997 GHz, to minimize the number\nof comb teeth needed to span the octave and reduce the pump power needed. We use an electro-optic comb apparatus [38] made of three cascaded electro-optic (EO) phase modulators driven at fEO = 17.47 GHz to measure the DKS repetition rate by modulating two of its adjacent OFC comb teeth. The phase modulation of the DKS OFC teeth forms an EO comb spanning over 1 THz with NEO = 57 EO teeth, which, where they overlap, allows us to record their beat note and infer the DKS repetition rate frep = NEOfEO \u00b1 fbeat [Fig. 4(c)]. Using this repetition rate measurement method, we demonstrate that the slope of the linear trend of the repetition rate shift with the reference frequency matches the mode difference between the DKS pump and the reference pump, and is in accordance with the frequency division principle for several azimuthal modes [Fig. 4(d)]. The KIS windows are different for each azimuthal mode, as the comb tooth power in the DKS is not constant with the probed \u00b5. We note that adjusting the reference pump frequency in this dual pinned system not only affects the repetition rate, but also tunes the CEO frequency, and as a result may make it possible to adjust the CEO of the frequency comb so that it falls within a photodetector\u2019s detection bandwidth. In addition, it is worth discussing how our synchronization of the DKS to the reference pump is related to recent work on injection locking of lasers for turn-key DKS generation [39, 40]. In such injection locking, the back-scattered signal from the DKS resonator is sent back into the (isolator-free) laser system, selecting and locking the laser frequency to one appropriate for DKS generation. In the case we present here, the reverse effect takes place. All lasers and amplifiers in use are paired with isolators, and hence the synchronization effect only takes place within the microresonator itself (there is no impact on the lasers), hence the Kerr-induced term. Instead of the laser frequency adjusting for locking, the reference pump is kept at fixed frequency while the DKS adjusts the frequency of its azimuthal components to fulfill the locking condition. The experimental demonstration of the repetition rate tuning highlights this effect.\nFinally, we experimentally demonstrate the viability of the passive Kerr-induced synchronization approach for clockwork applications. Although demonstrating frequency division, the main prerequisite for using a microcomb in a clockwork, has been accomplished by measuring the repetition rate tuning with the reference pump frequency [Fig. 4], demonstration of short-term and longterm stability and its division against the reference must also be verified. In particular, we show that the phase noise and the long-term stability of the reference pump are divided onto the repetition rate. As noted earlier, the inability to extract the short wavelength DW of the DKS OFC prevents us from stabilizing its CEO directly, e.g., via the f \u2212 2f method. Instead, we use a Toptica Photonics 80 MHz fiber comb that achieves CEO-free operation through difference frequency generation [41, 42], referenced to a 10 MHz Rubidium frequency standard, so that we can pin the main and reference pumps in\na phase-coherent fashion (i.e., their noise is correlated). Rather than the full frequency division if the DKS CEO is locked, a frequency division factor \u00b5s between the two pinned comb lines is achieved. First, we demonstrate that the repetition rate is indeed much more stable in the synchronized case [Fig. 5(a)]. Without any synchronization, the repetition rate beat note measured with the EO comb apparatus is relatively unstable, with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of several MHz. When the DKS is synchronized to the reference laser but both lasers are unlocked, the repetition rate is more stable, but still exhibits a large FWHM of about 655 kHz, due to the uncorrelated noise of both the main and reference pumps. However, when both pumps are additionally locked to the fiber comb and become phase coherent, the repetition rate beat note drastically reduces to a FWHM of about 193 Hz, with a perfect Lorentzian shape, albeit with the appearance of shoulders at 3.3 kHz. They can be explained as the frequency divided servo loop bandwidth, which is expected at 460 kHz [Fig. 5(c)], and is consistent with the frequency division given by the number of fiber comb teeth within two adjacent DKS OFC teeth of Nfiber = 12462, the NEO = 57 EOcomb teeth between the two DKS OFC teeth, and the mode spacing \u00b5s = 91 between the two pumps that perform the principle frequency\ndivision (i.e., 460 kHz \u00d7 \u00b5s/(Nfiber \u00d7NEO) = 3.3 kHz). We note that all the spectral frequencies in Fig. 5(a) have been referenced to the actual DKS repetition rate of about 997,387,327,768 Hz \u00b1 200 Hz. The error in the repetition rate is estimated by counting its frequency in time and assuming one standard deviation from its average, with a gate time of 10 ms [Fig. 5(b)].\nWe measure the phase noise of the repetition rate and the reference pump to demonstrate the short-term stability division. The main pump phase noise is similar to the reference one, given that they are both locked to the same fiber comb system and are the same type of CTL laser. We measure the phase noise of the reference pump using a 10 MHz Mach-Zehnder interferometer (see supplementary material for protocol Section S-4) and the repetition rate noise using a phase noise analyzer (PNA) referenced with the 10 MHz Rubidium standard. The repetition rate exhibits a much lower phase noise than the reference pump [Fig. 5(c)]. The two phase noise measurements almost match when accounting for the frequency division factor \u00b52s. A slight discrepancy remains, and the better performance of the repetition rate against the divided reference is likely due to the mutual coherence between the main and reference pumps; i.e, because the two pumps are locked to the same reference comb, their absolute fre-\n8 quency fluctuations are correlated, and this common noise is rejected by the repetition frequency. To fully demonstrate the potential of the passive synchronization approach for clockwork application, we measure the long-term stability of the system by measuring the repetition rate Allan deviation [Fig. 5(d)]. The 1/\u03c4 trend at long averaging time indicates that the only contributions are from white phase noise and demonstrates the phase coherence with the 80 MHz fiber comb. We show a residual noise of 1 part in 1.25 \u00d7 1012 at 1 second, similar to the fiber comb stability at 1 second and demonstrating the stability division, and 1 part in 1014 at 50 minutes. The plateau appearing between 1 second and 10 seconds is likely due to environmental fluctuations, which we have not attempted to reduce and is consistent with previous observations of active locking of a microcomb clockwork [15]. We note that the long-term stability metric is likely limited by a number of factors, including the complexity of our frequency division experiment (which includes both multiplication and division steps [Fig. 5(d)]) and the stability of the fiber comb source and its Rb frequency standard. In the future, we anticipate that much better stability may be obtained using a two-photon stabilized reference laser and a CEO-locked main pump, whereby full frequency division from the optical to microwave can be realized without intermediate multiplication steps. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new approach for a microcomb-based optical frequency division clockwork. Rather than active stabilization of the microcomb to a reference laser, our approach is based on passive, alloptical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) that bypasses electronics that add to the complexity and power budget of the optical frequency divider. In analogous fashion to mechanical clockworks, passive synchronization is enabled by direct coupling to the reference. In particular, the same optical nonlinearity that makes DKS generation possible is used to achieve strong synchronization between the DKS and the reference laser, bypassing the need for active stabilization. By experimentally and theoretically investigating the nonlinear dynamics of the system and demonstrating KIS with as little as 2 mW of on-chip reference pump laser power, compatible with on-chip integrated lasers [43], we demonstrate passive synchronization of a microcromb clockwork for the first time. Indeed, in contrast to existing self-injection locking approaches where the main pump laser frequency follows the DKS existence condition, here it is the DKS which locks its frequency components to a separate reference pump, providing a direct external control to tune the microcomb parameters. We show that the repetition rate of the DKS can be controlled by adjusting the reference pump frequency, with a tuning set by the frequency division factor. Finally, by demonstrating short- and long-term stability division compatible with an optical clock architecture, we show the viability of our clockwork technique. This synchronization technique can be straightforwardly extended to a fully self-referenced microresonator frequency comb with improved coupling engineering to efficiently extract the short wavelength DW. The reference pump being a comb tooth could provide substantially larger power than the originally available comb tooth at the DW for second harmonic generation, to enable the nonlinear interferometry in a more efficient fashion, and allowing for optimized optical frequency division. Our work is a key milestone toward compact optical clocks for fieldable applications in position, navigation, and timing, both by decreasing the power budget and greatly simplifying the architecture. It also paves the way for future physics investigations that can probe novel DKS states thanks to the nonlinear connection between CW light and intra-cavity pulses.\n[1] L.-S. Ma, Z. Bi, A.

In our system, we are in the presence of two driving fields, the main pump at \u00b5 = 0 and the reference at \u00b5s. To obtain the optical frequency comb that is observed in experiment the following protocol is observed, similar to the one presented in ref [27]:\n1. For each reference detuning \u03b4\u03c9ref , find \u2206D1 such that the soliton position in \u03b8 is invariant with t\n10\n2. Solve the LLE and sample the soliton at every round trip time to effectively emulate the periodic extraction by the bus waveguide 3. Reconstruct the pulse train by concatenating every sampled soliton to obtain awg(t) 4. Fourier transform the pulse train to reconstruct the OFC and obtain Awg(\u03c9) 5. Recast the frequency comb into a two dimensional system Awg(\u00b5,\u2126) by resizing Awg(\u03c9) by the repetition rate sampling size, thus any power component within [\u2212\u03c9rep/2;+\u03c9rep/2] around a given comb tooth \u00b5 of the DKS 6. Integrate Awg(\u00b5,\u2126) along \u00b5 to obtain S(\u2126), which is equivalent to the experimental measurement of the beat note arising from the CEO frequency shift. 7. Repeat for every \u03b4\u03c9ref to create the plot presented in Fig. 3(c). In order to retrieve the dynamics presented in Fig. 4, there is no need to obtain S(\u2126) but rather it is about finding \u2206D1. If one assumes a very slow variation of \u03b4\u03c9ref , we can make the approximation that \u03b4\u03c9ref is constant in between t and t + \u03b4t. One can then extract the drift of the soliton within this time window and obtain \u2206D1.\nExperimental Protocol \u2013 For a complete description of the experimental setup, please refer to the supplementary material Section S-2. To measure the CEO offset highlighting the synchronization in Fig. 2, a 6 GHz photodiode measures the comb, with the main pump and the cooler filtered out. For measuring the repetition rate in Fig. 4, we send two adjacent OFC teeth through the EO comb apparatus. We then use a narrow filter to only select the two EO comb teeth that participate in the frequency downconversion repetition rate beat note, which we record with a 50 MHz avalanche photodiode. For the noise measurements presented in Fig. 5, the same type of filtering is used with the 80 MHz fiber comb beating against a single DKS OFC tooth."

            "text": "We are seeking to find the equation of motion of the system, in particular the equation describing the evolution in time of the phase difference between the reference pump laser \u03c6ref at azimuthal mode \u00b5s (defined relative to the main pump at \u00b5 = 0) and the corresponding DKS azimuthal component A\u00b5s with the phase \u03c6dks(\u00b5s). We know that the carrier envelope offset frequency arises from the phase velocity, such that \u03c9ceo = \u2202\u03c6/\u2202t. We are assuming that the pulse that is generated by the reference laser is locked to the pulse that is generated by the pump laser to form a single MDKS that propagates with a single group velocity. However, each component of the MDKS will in general have its own phase velocity, hence its own CEO frequency \u03c9 (ref) ceo and \u03c9 (dks) ceo for the reference and main component of the MDKS respectively. This phase velocity difference is given by:\n\u2202\u03a6 \u2202t = \u2202\u03c6ref \u2202t \u2212 \u2202\u03c6dks(\u00b5s) \u2202t\n= \u03c9(ref)ceo \u2212 \u03c9(dks)ceo = \u03c9ref \u2212 \u03c9dks(\u00b5s) (S.1) = \u03c9cav(\u00b5s) + \u03b4\u03c9ref \u2212 (\u03c90 + \u00b5s\u03c9rep)\nwith \u03c6ref and \u03c6dks(\u00b5s) the relative phase of the reference pump and its closest DKS azimuthal component respectively, \u03c9 (X) ceo being the CEO frequency relative to the DKS (X = dks) or the reference pump (X = ref), \u03c9ref is the frequency of the reference pump which is offset from the cavity resonance \u03c9cav(\u00b5s) by a detuning \u2206\u03c9ref , and \u03c9dks(\u00b5s) = \u03c90 +\u00b5s\u03c9rep is the frequency of the closest comb tooth from the reference pump frequency with \u03c9rep being the repetition rate of the DKS and \u03c90 being the main pump frequency. \u2202\u03a6 \u2202t represents the repetition rate in the second dimension of the 2D comb reported in ref. [27]. Additional differentiation of Eq. (S.1) provides a direct link between the phase mismatch \u03a6 and \u03c9rep:\n\u22022\u03a6 \u2202t2 = \u2212\u00b5s \u2202\u03c9rep \u2202t\n(S.2)\nWe now suppose that in the resonator angular coordinate \u03b8 there is a short-duration pulse whose central angle \u03b8\u0304 is well-defined and rotates at a constant angular velocity with a fixed shape. Therefore, we have:\nEdks\u03b8\u0304 = \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 \u03b8|a(\u03b8, t)|2 d\u03b8 2\u03c0\n(S.3)\nwhere a(\u03b8, t) satisfies the modified LLE equation presented in Eq. (2). The quantity Edks is given by \u222b d\u03b8 2\u03c0 |a(\u03b8, t)| 2 and represent the DKS energy, so that \u03b8\u0304 is the pulse averaged central angle of the pulse. We then have\nEdks d\u03b8\u0304\ndt =\nd\ndt \u222b \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03b8|a(\u03b8, t)|2 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 = \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 \u03b8 [ a \u2202a\u2217 \u2202t + a\u2217 \u2202a \u2202t ]d\u03b8 2\u03c0\n(S.4)\nWe must first assume that the loss and gain terms make a negligible contribution to the momentum. This assumption implies:\n0 \u2248 \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 \u03b8|a(\u03b8, t)|2 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 = \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 \u03b8 [ Fa\u2217 + F \u2217a\u2212 \u03ba|a|2 ]d\u03b8 2\u03c0\n(S.5)\nwith F being the main driving force in Eq. (2) and we assume the reference pump is negligible before the main pump power, which is the case in our experiment. The assumption that the loss and gain terms are negligible is reasonable since the magnitude of these terms is small. There is, however, no expectation that it is exactly zero. Otherwise, the Kerr effect terms cancel out, so we can thus focus on the linear contribution, which is the dominant contribution. It is useful now to work in the mode number domain. We write:\nA(\u00b5, t) = \u222b \u03c0 \u03c0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 a(\u03b8, t)e\u2212i\u00b5\u03b8, a(\u03b8, t) = \u2211 \u00b5 A(\u00b5, t)ei\u00b5t (S.6)\n12\nWe then have under the same approximations:\ndA(\u00b5)\ndt \u2261 i\u03c9cav(\u00b5)A(\u00b5) (S.7)\nwith \u03c9cav(\u00b5) the azimuthal component optical frequencies on resonance. Using Eq. (S.7) and injecting it in Eq. (S.4), accounting only for the linear terms, integrating by parts, and noting that only the term \u00b5 = 0 survive the integration, we obtain:\nEdks d\u03b8\u0304\ndt = \u2212 \u2211 \u00b5 \u03c9\u2032cav(\u00b5)A(\u00b5)A \u2217(\u00b5) (S.8)\nwith \u03c9\u2032cav(\u00b5) = d\u03c9cav(\u00b5) d\u00b5 . It should be noted that we are assuming that A\u00b5 and \u03c9cav(\u00b5) are both continuous functions of \u00b5 with continuous derivatives, and thus assuming a resonator without mode coupling to different propagation directions (i.e. backscattering) or mode families (i.e avoided mode crossing).\nThe dispersion can be accounted in different fashions, either through a Taylor expansion assuming mode-independent coefficients or assuming a mode-dependent free spectral range such that \u03c9\u2032\u00b5 = d\u03c9\u00b5 d\u00b5 = D1(\u00b5). Noting that in the cavity referential the temporal variation of the the pulse averaged central angle \u2202\u03b8\u0304\u2202t translates directly into the repetition rate \u03c9rep, we can write :\n\u03c9rep = \u2212 1\nEDKS \u2211 \u00b5 D1(\u00b5)A(\u00b5)A \u2217(\u00b5) (S.9)\nTaking the time derivative of this equation, we obtain:\n\u2202\u03c9rep \u2202t = \u2212 1 EDKS \u2211 \u00b5 D1(\u00b5) ( \u2202A(\u00b5) \u2202t A\u2217(\u00b5) +A(\u00b5) \u2202A\u2217(\u00b5) \u2202t ) (S.10)\nWe can write the coupled mode theory equation for each azimuthal mode component A(\u00b5) accounting for the Kerr nonlinearity as:\n\u2202A(\u00b5)\n\u2202t = ( \u2212\u03ba 2 + i\u03c9cav(\u00b5) ) A(\u00b5) + i\u03b3L \u2211 \u03b1,\u03b2 A(\u03b1)A\u2217(\u03b2)A(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2 + \u00b5)\u2212 i\u03b4(\u00b50) \u221a \u03baextPmaine i\u03c90t \u2212 i\u03b4(\u00b5s) \u221a \u03baextPrefe i\u03c9ref t\n(S.11) Here, \u03c9cav(\u00b5) are the resonance frequencies of the modes \u00b5 normalized to the pump mode, \u03b3 = \u03c9n2/Aeff is the effective nonlinear coefficient, with n2 = 2.4\u00d7 10\u221215 cm2\u00b7W-1, which we assume constant for simplification (yet given the comb bandwidth it should not be), L is the circumference of the resonator, \u03baext is the coupling rate and \u03ba the total loss rate, Pmain and Pref are the main and reference pump laser power, \u00b5s is the azimuthal mode at which the reference laser is situated, and \u03b4(x) is the Kronecker delta function such that \u03b4(\u00b5 = x) = 1 and \u03b4(\u00b5 \u0338= x) = 0. We note that \u00b50 is the main pumped mode, which is null here per normalization, yet we explicitly label it here to avoid confusion with a simple zero. Plugging Eq. (S.11) into Eq. (S.10), several things can be simplified. First, we can note that all linear imaginary components of Eq. (S.11) cancel each other out for each \u00b5, and only the terms where the pumps are presents need to be kept. In addition, we can note that the relative phase between the main pump and its corresponding phase is fixed. Thus we obtain the following equation for the temporal derivative of the repetition rate:\n\u2212\u2202\u03c9rep \u2202t\n= \u03baD1(\u00b5s)Ks sin [( \u03c6ref \u2212 \u03c6dks(\u00b5s) ) t ] + \u03baD1(\u00b50)K0 + \u03baD1(\u00b50)KNL \u2212 \u03ba\u03c9rep (S.12)\nHere, we note that the sin function appears because of \u2212i(c\u2212 c\u2217) = 2I(c). The following parameters are defined:\nKs = 2 |A(\u00b5s)| EDKS\n\u221a Pref\u03baext\n\u03ba2\nK0 = 2 |A(\u00b50)| EDKS\n\u221a Pmain\u03baext\n\u03ba2\nKNL = \u03b3L\n\u03baD1(\u00b50)EDKS \u2211 \u00b5 D1(\u00b5) A\u2217(\u00b5)\u2211 \u03b1,\u03b2 A(\u03b1)A\u2217(\u03b2)A(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2 + \u00b5)\u2212 c.c \n13\nUsing Eq. (S.2) and Eq. (S.10), we arrive at:\n1\n\u03ba\n\u22022\u03a6 \u2202t2 = \u2212\u00b5sD1(\u00b5s)Ks sin (\u03a6)\u2212 \u00b5sD1(\u00b50)KNL + \u00b5s\u03c9rep (S.13)\nUsing Eq. (S.1), we can replace \u03c9rep to obtain the extended Adler equation which describes the phase locking of the soliton to the reference laser:\n\u2212 1 \u03ba\n\u22022\u03a6 \u2202t2 + \u2202\u03a6 \u2202t = \u2212\u00b5sD1(\u00b5s)Ks sin (\u03a6)\u2212 \u00b5sD1(\u00b50)KNL \u2212 \u00b5sD1(\u00b50)K0 + \u03b4\u03c9ref \u2212 \u03c90 + \u03c9cav(\u00b5s) (S.14)\nWe can recall:\n\u03c9cav(\u00b5s)\u2212 \u03c90 = Dint(\u00b5s) + \u00b5sD1(\u00b50)\nLeading to\n\u2212 1 \u03ba\n\u22022\u03a6\n\u2202t2 \u2212 \u2202\u03a6 \u2202t + = Dint(\u00b5s) + \u2206\u2212 T sin (\u03a6) (S.15)\nThis equation is similar to the equation of motion of a damped pendulum under constant torque driving [44], with the effective detuning \u2206 = \u03b4\u03c9ref + \u00b5sD1(\u00b50)(1 \u2212KNL \u2212K0) along with Dint(\u00b5s) associated to the damping of the effective pendulum system, and T = D1(\u00b5s)Ks\u00b5s the effective \u201cnatural\u201d torque of the system (i.e. the mass, cord length and gravity acceleration product). For the synchronization to occur, the right hand-side of the equation needs to cancel out. This leads to a condition on the integrated dispersion at the reference pumped mode, which needs to be minimized or needs to be compensated for by the reference pump detuning. As \u03b4\u03c9ref is limited, this imposes a hard limit on which mode can be used. Hence, sending the reference laser at the modes where the DW(s) occur allows one to minimize Dint(\u00b5s) and reach a synchronization regime.\nFrom the above, we can extract the locking bandwidth for which the reference laser can be tuned while maintaining synchronization, around a center frequency yet to be determined, as follows:\n\u2206\u03c9lock = 2T = 4D1(\u00b5s)\u00b5s |A(\u00b5s)| EDKS\n\u221a Pref\u03baext\n\u03ba2 (S.16)\nTo give some more insight about the typical values associated with K.I.S. of the DKS to the reference pump laser in our system, we extract the following parameters from the LLE and experiment:\nParameter Values\n|A(\u00b50)| 3\u00d7 102 J1/2 |A(\u00b5s)| 1\u00d7 10\u22122 J1/2 EDKS 1\u00d7 10\u22123J \u03baext 2\u03c0 \u00d7 80 MHz \u03ba 2\u03c0 \u00d7 150 MHz \u00b5s 92\nPmain 150 mW Pref 1 mW K\u00b5s 4\u00d7 10\u22126 K0 1.4\u00d7 10\u22125\nD1(\u00b50) 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1 THz \u00b5sD1(\u00b50)K0 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1.26 GHz \u00b5sD1(\u00b50)KNL 2\u03c0 \u00d7 100 MHz\nT 2\u03c0 \u00d7 365 MHz \u2206\u03c9lock 2\u03c0 \u00d7 730 MHz\nFinally, we can determine how a small change in the reference pump detuning \u03b4\u03c9ref , which we call d\u03b4\u03c9ref , is related to a small change in \u03c9rep, which we call d\u03c9rep, simply by differentiating Eq. (S.1), noting that in the synchronization regime \u2202\u03a6/\u2202t = 0, and assuming the frequency of resonance and the pump are fixed (as in the experiment). This yields:\n14\nd\u03b4\u03c9ref = \u00b5sd\u03c9rep (S.17)\nHence, any variation of the reference pump detuning is frequency divided onto the repetition rate with a factor defined by the reference pump mode number \u00b5s (assuming the main pump remains fixed), similar to the experimental demonstrations in Fig. 4\nS-2.

Although it seems quite complex at first, most of the components are dedicated to characterizing the synchronization state, which in an application system would not have to be used. Three CTLs are used, a main pump from a 1060 nm CTL, a reference laser from a 1550 nm CTL, and a cooler pump from a 980 nm CTL. Only the reference laser is not amplified, as the synchronization does not require high power to be obtained. The polarization is set for each laser, transverse electric for the reference and main pump, and transverse magnetic for the cooler to avoid spurious nonlinear mixing in the ring. The reference and the main pump have a small amount of their power tapped for them to be locked to the 80 MHz Toptica fiber comb and sent to the MZIs for frequency noise characterization. The different lasers are combined using wavelength demultiplexers (WDMs). The cooler is filtered out after the chip to avoid high 980 nm power going upstream toward the main and reference pump. To characterize the DKS OFC, a portion of the light at the output of the chip is sent to the optical spectrum analyzer. The other part of the light exiting the chip is sent to different WDMs for filtering before being sent to different instruments. The CEO offset measurement presented in Fig. 2 is obtained by sending the 1550 nm WDM filtered light\n15\nto a 6 GHz photodiode, with the output analyzed with an electrical spectrum analyzer for each reference detuning. To obtain either the repetition rate presented in Fig. 4 or the repetition rate noise in Fig. 5, we tap a portion of the light going to the 6 GHz photodiode to either go through the EO comb apparatus or beat directly against the fiber comb. Then a narrow bandpass filter is used to select only the frequency components playing a role in the beating, which is then detected using a 50 MHz avalanche photodiode and processed either with the electrical spectrum analyzer or the phase noise analyzer.\nS-3.

Although thermal bistability could exist, the very low reference laser power \u2013 especially below 1 mW \u2013 suggests that it alone is unlikely to explain the observed hysteresis. The zero is determined in both cases by a fixed frequency that is measured accurately (< 30 MHz uncertainty) with a wavemeter.\nThe measurements shown in Fig. 2 of the synchronization bandwidth with reference power are analogous to the well-known Arnold tongue. The experiments presented in the main text are performed with reference laser detuning from red ( frequency) to blue (lower frequency). With the on-chip power of the reference below 3 mW, little thermal bistability would be expected, and no bistability at all should be expected with power below 1 mW. However, performing the Arnold tongue characterization with blue-to-red or red-to-blue tuning exhibit a hysteresis, a signature of bistability. The zero frequency of the reference detuning is the same for both scanning directions and is determined with a wavemeter with an accuracy of about 30 MHz, better than the measured hysteresis bandwidth of about 500 MHz.\nS-4.

(b) Concept to retrieve the frequency noise from the noise measurement of the light set at the quadrature point of the MZIs, converting the frequency noise into voltage noise which can be observed through an electrical spectrum analyzer.\n16\nIn order to measure the frequency noise of the reference laser as shown in Fig. 5, or of a single comb tooth as described in Section S-6, we used an imbalanced fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a free spectral range of 10 MHz. Working at the quadrature point allows us to convert the frequency noise of the light under study into a voltage noise which can then be observed and processed using a spectrum analyzer (RSA). To retrieve the frequency noise from the RSA, the following algebra is used:\nS\u03bd = \u2206\u03bdMZI sin \u22121 ( UMZI Amzi ) [Hz2/Hz] (S.18)\nwith UMZI = \u221a 50\u00d7 10\u22123 \u00d7 10SMZI/10 the voltage obtained from spectral measurement, where SMZI is the optical power in decibels normalized to 1 mW of the MZI noise at quadrature (i.e., in dBm), the spectrum analyzer impedance is assumed to be 50 \u2126, Amzi is the amplitude of the sinusoidal modulation with frequency of the MZI, and \u2206\u03bdMZI is the free spectral range of the MZI at the frequency of interest [Fig. S3].\nTo convert the frequency noise to phase noise, we use the following relation:\nS\u03c6 = 10 log10 ( S\u03bd \u03bd2 ) [dBc/Hz] (S.19)\nS-5.

We have also measured the locking phase noise and long-term stability in Fig. S4 and show that, being orders of magnitude below the repetition rate of our microcomb phase noise and long-term stability, justifies their not accounted for in the final measurement presented.\nS-6. Single comb tooth noise reduction\nThe frequency noise of the individual comb teeth of a microcomb OFC grows quadratically with the mode number, mainly since the thermo-refractive noise (TRN) is one of the dominant noise sources in such a compact cavity. However, in the synchronized case, the repetition rate is fixed by the two pinned frequencies: the reference and the CEO frequency (when the CEO is stabilized); or, in our case for the latter, the main pump frequency. To this extent, measuring the frequency noise of a single comb tooth in the different regimes is interesting. From Fig. S5, it is clear that in the unsynchronized case, the noise is relatively high and follows the characteristic TRN profile. When in the synchronized case, each comb line\u2019s noise is significantly reduced and follows the noise characteristic of the pinned frequencies.\n17\n103102\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n104 105 103102 104 105 103102 104 105\n103102 104 105 103102 104 105 103102 104 105\n\u00b5 = -88 \u00b5 = -89 \u00b5 = -90\n\u00b5 = -91 \u00b5 = -92 \u00b5 = -93\nFourier Frequency [Hz]\nPh as\ne no\nis e [\ndB /H\nz]\nnoise floor\nUnlocked synchronized\nLocked synchronized\nUnsynchronized\nFig. S5 \u2013 Frequency noise of several single microcomb OFC teeth measured using the MZI apparatus from Section S-4, while having the reference at \u00b5s = \u221294. In red, we display the unsynchronized case (i.e. no reference present in the system), in yellow the synchronized system with all lasers being free running, and in blue the synchronized system with locked lasers. The power is referenced to the carrier, i.e., dBc/Hz."
