    "abstractText": "Background: Dizziness and vertigo are common clinical symptoms. Gastrodin injection has shown clinical effects on dizziness or vertigo. However, little is known about the effectiveness and costs of combining Gastrodin injection with conventional treatment on dizziness or vertigo in daily practice. This study aimed to analyze the clinical and economic effects of Gastrodin injection for patients with dizziness or vertigo in comparison to Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection in real-world practice. Methods: Data was collected from the Hospital Information System of 131 hospitals across China from January to December 2018. Patients whose primary discharge diagnosis was dizziness or vertigo according to ICD-10 diagnostic coding were included and divided into two samples: sample of dizziness or vertigo; sample of dizziness or vertigo, with the complication of cerebral infarction. Comparative analysis of the medical cost per hospitalization, hospitalization duration, effective rates, and cure rates between the group of Gastrodin injection and the group of Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection was conducted. Propensity Score Matching was used to control potential confounding factors. Results: In the sample of dizziness or vertigo, although there was no significant differences on hospitalization duration (P = 0.080), the group of Gastrodin injection was significantly better than the group of Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection (P < 0.001) in terms of treatment effect and the per capita hospitalization cost. In the sample of dizziness or vertigo, with the complication of cerebral infarction, there was no significant difference (P = 0.371) in terms of hospitalization duration, but the group of Gastrodin injection was significantly better than the group of Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection (P = 0.009) in terms of treatment effect, and significant difference regarding the per capita hospitalization cost (P < 0.001). \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Chinese Medicine (2022) 17:6 Background Dizziness is divided into vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and lightheadedness in the world [1\u20133]. Dizziness and vertigo are the main manifestations of various central or peripheral vestibular syndromes caused by cerebrovascular disease. Dizziness and vertigo are common morbid syndrome, and the prevalence rate increases with age, which are the top three main reasons for the elderly to see a doctor. Patients are often complicated with various complications, rapid development of the disease, and hidden causes, which significantly increased clinical treatment difficulty [4]. According to the anatomic location of the lesions in clinical, vertigo can be divided into systemic vertigo caused by vestibular nervous system lesions and non-systemic vertigo caused by lesions outside the vestibular system [5]. The isolated dizziness or vertigo of cerebrovascular disease is easily misdiagnosed and might cause severe consequences [6]. However, dizziness is the most common clinical symptom in posterior circulation cerebral infarction with the highest incidence [7]. Some studies on the research between incidence rate of acute cerebrovascular disease and isolated dizziness or vertigo have shown that the probability of acute cerebrovascular disease (cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage) with acute dizziness or vertigo, nystagmus and/or balance disorders is 4.6\u201311% [8, 9]. Specifically, stroke has become the most common high disability and deadly disease globally [10] and the leading cause of death in China in recent years [11]. The age of stroke onset was earlier than before, and the prevalence and hospitalization rate showed a significant upward trend [12]. Cerebral infarction accounts for about 70% of stroke, and posterior circulation cerebral infarction accounts for about 20% of ischemic stroke [13]. Therefore, dizziness and vertigo have caused a heavy economic burden on patients and the health care systems worldwide [14]. According to the Multidisciplinary Expert Consensus of Diagnosis and Treatment of Vertigo (2017 edition), routine treatment with western medicine with the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoid is the first choice thrombolysis, antiplatelet, and anticoagulation [15]. Gastrodin is a active component extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Gastrodia elata Blume, called Tianma in Chinese [16]. Gastrodia elata Blume and Gastrodin have low toxicity [17] and have pharmacological activities such as dizziness, stoke, headache, sedative, analgesic and neurological disorder-improving [18\u201321], which have a potential role in the protection of nerve cells [22, 23]. Gastrodin injection is mainly used in the clinical treatment of dizziness, vertigo, stroke, insomnia, headache, neurasthenia, coronary heart disease, and epilepsy [24\u201326]. The clinical effect is positive, and there is no significant adverse reaction [27]. Compared with western medicine, Gastrodin injection has better effectiveness and safety in treating cerebral infarction [28]. Furthermore, based on a multi-center single-blind randomized controlled trial, Gastrodin injection is safe and effective for vertigo and is better than betahistine injection in relieving vertigo symptoms [29]. Although Gastrodin injection showed sound clinical effects in these studies, there is little known about the clinical and economic evaluations of Gastrodin injection in real-world practice. Some retrospective studies had compared Gastrodin injection with other drugs in the treatment of dizziness and vertigo [30\u201332]. However, the actual conditions of patients are evidence of clinical medication decisions by doctors. It must consider realistic comparator drugs to evaluate specific medicine products\u2019 clinical and economic effects [33]. The leveraging of real-world data can improve clinical evaluation and that is one of the priority areas for improving public safety and facilitating innovation in China [34]. From current literature, there is still lacking studies on the evaluation of curative effect and economic benefit of the Gastrodin injection with the comparison of other drugs for patients in the real clinical environment. In clinical practice, Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection has been widely used for dizziness, vertigo, and cerebral infarction with low toxicity and a good curative effect with little adverse reaction [35\u201337]. It is a naturally extracted medicine, like Gastrodin injection, which can provide new treatment with high efficiency and low toxicity at low development cost [38]. The development of phytomedicine based on modern medicine and pharmaceutical theory is an innovation and has been recognized [39]. Thus, the comparison between these two naturally extracted medicines is more convincing, and it also can provide practical references for guiding the practice of interchangeability of the same type of drugs. Conclusions: Gastrodin injection showed advantages for inpatients with dizziness or vertigo compared with Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection. Future studies using prospective pragmatic controlled trials can test and explore more about the effects of Gastrodin injections on dizziness or vertigo.",

Patients whose primary discharge diagnosis was dizziness or vertigo according to ICD-10 diagnostic coding were included and divided into two samples: sample of dizziness or vertigo; sample of dizziness or vertigo, with the complication of cerebral infarction. Comparative analysis of the medical cost per hospitalization, hospitalization duration, effective rates, and cure rates between the group of Gastrodin injection and the group of Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection was conducted. Propensity Score Matching was used to control potential confounding factors.\nResults: In the sample of dizziness or vertigo, although there was no significant differences on hospitalization duration (P = 0.080), the group of Gastrodin injection was significantly better than the group of Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection (P < 0.001) in terms of treatment effect and the per capita hospitalization cost. In the sample of dizziness or vertigo, with the complication of cerebral infarction, there was no significant difference (P = 0.371) in terms of hospitalization duration, but the group of Gastrodin injection was significantly better than the group of Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection (P = 0.009) in terms of treatment effect, and significant difference regarding the per capita hospitalization cost (P < 0.001).\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "heading": "Background",
            "text": "Dizziness is divided into vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and lightheadedness in the world [1\u20133]. Dizziness and vertigo are the main manifestations of various central or peripheral vestibular syndromes caused by cerebrovascular disease. Dizziness and vertigo are common morbid syndrome, and the prevalence rate increases with age, which are the top three main reasons for the elderly to see a doctor. Patients are often complicated with various complications, rapid development of the disease, and hidden causes, which significantly increased clinical treatment difficulty [4]. According to the anatomic location of the lesions in clinical, vertigo can be divided into systemic vertigo caused by vestibular nervous system lesions and non-systemic vertigo caused by lesions outside the vestibular system [5]. The isolated dizziness or vertigo of cerebrovascular disease is easily misdiagnosed and might cause severe consequences [6]. However, dizziness is the most common clinical symptom in posterior circulation cerebral infarction with the highest incidence [7]. Some studies on the research between incidence rate of acute cerebrovascular disease and isolated dizziness or vertigo have shown that the probability of acute cerebrovascular disease (cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage) with acute dizziness or vertigo, nystagmus and/or balance disorders is 4.6\u201311% [8, 9].\nSpecifically, stroke has become the most common high disability and deadly disease globally [10] and the leading cause of death in China in recent years [11]. The age of stroke onset was earlier than before, and the prevalence and hospitalization rate showed a significant upward trend [12]. Cerebral infarction accounts for about 70% of stroke, and posterior circulation cerebral infarction accounts for about 20% of ischemic stroke [13]. Therefore, dizziness and vertigo have caused a heavy economic burden on patients and the health care systems worldwide [14].\nAccording to the Multidisciplinary Expert Consensus of Diagnosis and Treatment of Vertigo (2017 edition), routine treatment with western medicine with the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoid is the first choice thrombolysis, antiplatelet, and anticoagulation [15]. Gastrodin is a active component extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Gastrodia elata Blume, called Tianma in Chinese [16]. Gastrodia elata Blume and Gastrodin have low toxicity [17] and have\npharmacological activities such as dizziness, stoke, headache, sedative, analgesic and neurological disorder-improving [18\u201321], which have a potential role in the protection of nerve cells [22, 23].\nGastrodin injection is mainly used in the clinical treatment of dizziness, vertigo, stroke, insomnia, headache, neurasthenia, coronary heart disease, and epilepsy [24\u201326]. The clinical effect is positive, and there is no significant adverse reaction [27]. Compared with western medicine, Gastrodin injection has better effectiveness and safety in treating cerebral infarction [28]. Furthermore, based on a multi-center single-blind randomized controlled trial, Gastrodin injection is safe and effective for vertigo and is better than betahistine injection in relieving vertigo symptoms [29].\nAlthough Gastrodin injection showed sound clinical effects in these studies, there is little known about the clinical and economic evaluations of Gastrodin injection in real-world practice. Some retrospective studies had compared Gastrodin injection with other drugs in the treatment of dizziness and vertigo [30\u201332]. However, the actual conditions of patients are evidence of clinical medication decisions by doctors. It must consider realistic comparator drugs to evaluate specific medicine products\u2019 clinical and economic effects [33]. The leveraging of real-world data can improve clinical evaluation and that is one of the priority areas for improving public safety and facilitating innovation in China [34]. From current literature, there is still lacking studies on the evaluation of curative effect and economic benefit of the Gastrodin injection with the comparison of other drugs for patients in the real clinical environment.\nIn clinical practice, Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection has been widely used for dizziness, vertigo, and cerebral infarction with low toxicity and a good curative effect with little adverse reaction [35\u201337]. It is a naturally extracted medicine, like Gastrodin injection, which can provide new treatment with high efficiency and low toxicity at low development cost [38]. The development of phytomedicine based on modern medicine and pharmaceutical theory is an innovation and has been recognized [39]. Thus, the comparison between these two naturally extracted medicines is more convincing, and it also can provide practical references for guiding the practice of interchangeability of the same type of drugs.\nConclusions: Gastrodin injection showed advantages for inpatients with dizziness or vertigo compared with Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection. Future studies using prospective pragmatic controlled trials can test and explore more about the effects of Gastrodin injections on dizziness or vertigo.\nKeywords: Gastrodin injection, Dizziness, Vertigo, Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection, Electronic health record\nTherefore, this study aimed to analyze the clinical and economic effect of Gastrodin injection for patients with dizziness or vertigo in comparison to Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection in real-world practice. It\u2019s expected that the findings can provide references for clinicians to optimize treatment options."

            "text": "In this study, we focused on the clinical and economic anlaysis of Gastrodin injection, comparing with Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection, which is commonly used to treat dizziness or vertigo [50, 51]. We compared the Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection with Gastrodin injection through clinical and economic evaluation outcome indicators such as medical cost of hospitalization, days of hospital stay, effective rate, and cure rate, to analyze the drug economy and effectiveness\nof Gastrodin injection in the real world. The data of this study was from real-world, not from controlled clinical trials. Real-world data is different from controlled clinical trial data, real-world evidence provides external validity and can provide evidence for the effectiveness and economic effects [52]. Real-world evidence can be used to complement data from controlled clinical trials to enable the generalization of clinical findings to a more inclusive and larger population, it can provide instructive information for clinical practice [53]. The correlations of gastrodin injection in the treatment of dizziness or vertigo were analyzed, and the differences of these two groups were found. So, this study\u2019s results can provide valuable reference for the clinical practice of dizziness or vertigo.\nNevertheless, the use of real-world data is prone to pose selection bias challenges [54]. Therefore, to reduce the impact of confounding factors on intervention effect estimation, stratified analysis and PSM were used in this study. After PSM, the baseline situation between the exposed and control groups was more balanced and comparable than before, and some significant findings were generated that are worth further discussion below.\nRegarding hospitalization duration, it found that there were no significant differences that of these two study\ngroups in the sample of dizziness or vertigo and the sample of dizziness or vertigo complicated with cerebral infarction. In the past clinical study, it found that the combination of Gastrodin injection and conventional treatment had significant (P < 0.05) advantages in the improvement time compared with conventional treatment for the treatment of vertigo [55]. Regarding medical cost per hospitalization, this study found that the medical const per hospitalization of Gastrodin injection group was significantly (P < 0.001) lower\nthan of Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection group in the sample of dizziness or vertigo, but no significant differences that of these two study groups in the sample of dizziness or vertigo complicated with cerebral infarction. The economic advantage of Gastrodin injection for dizziness or vertigo patients can be proven in this study.\nAlthough Gastrodin injection is effective in treating dizziness or vertigo [56], it also has some adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occasionally, such as dry mouth and nose, local pain, rash, and somnolence, etc. Based on two meta-analyses, few studies reported ADRs, while reported ADRs were mild and did not need special treatment [27, 28]. In a multi-center single-blind randomized controlled trial, of the 120 patients in the Gastrodin injection group, 10 had adverse reactions; the ADRs rate was 8.33% in the Gastrodin injection group and 10.83% in the control group without statistical significance (P = 0.538) [29]. However, most of the ADRs will return to normal after stopping the drug. Therefore, although the ADRs rate reported in the past studies is low and mild, Gastrodin injection safety still needs to be further clinical verification. It implies that patient-centered clinical medication needs more exploration.\nAlso, the strengths of this study are obvious. This study reflects the correlation of gastrodin injection in the treatment of dizziness or vertigo, and also shows that there are differences between Gastrodin injection and Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaves injection. Firstly, the actual clinical practice can be shown by using real-world data to conduct the clinical and economic evaluation of Gastrodin injection for dizziness or vertigo. Secondly, the data of this study were collected from 131 hospitals across the country, which covered the whole nation, so the findings\nhave more generalizing significance for dizziness or vertigo treatment. Thirdly, there is still lacking studies to evaluate the clinical and economic benefit of the Gastrodin injection with the comparison of other drugs for patients in the actual clinical practice. Therefore, this study supplemented the evidence in this respect."
