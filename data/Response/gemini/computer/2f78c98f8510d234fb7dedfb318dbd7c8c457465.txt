1. **Investigate the use of different observation models for inferring task goals.** The paper uses a sigmoid function to map the discrepancy between the current progress and the desired task goal to a probability distribution over the space of possible actions. However, other observation models could be used, such as a Gaussian distribution or a mixture of Gaussians. Exploring different observation models could lead to improved performance in different task scenarios.


2. **Develop methods for learning task goals in more complex tasks.** The paper focuses on learning task goals in simple pouring tasks. However, it would be interesting to investigate how the proposed framework can be extended to more complex tasks, such as assembling objects or cooking a meal. This would require developing new methods for representing task goals and for inferring them from human interactions.


3. **Explore the use of the proposed framework in different human-robot interaction scenarios.** The paper focuses on using the proposed framework in physical human-robot interaction scenarios. However, it would be interesting to investigate how the framework can be used in other scenarios, such as verbal human-robot interaction or collaborative human-robot learning. This would require developing new methods for representing task goals and for inferring them from different types of human input.


4. **Investigate the use of the proposed framework in real-world applications.** The paper demonstrates the proposed framework in a simulated environment. However, it would be interesting to investigate how the framework performs in real-world applications. This would require developing new methods for dealing with noise and uncertainty in the real world.


5. **Develop methods for transferring learned task goals across different robots.** The paper focuses on learning task goals for a single robot. However, it would be interesting to investigate how learned task goals can be transferred across different robots. This would require developing new methods for representing task goals in a way that is independent of the robot's physical characteristics.
