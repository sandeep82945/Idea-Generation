One unresolved question is why Cu-decient CIGSe absorbers, which typically have a [Cu]/([In] + [Ga]) ratio as low as 0.8, demonstrate such a good or even superior solar cell performance.5 The explanation might be rooted in the unusual ability of CIGSe to accommodate large off-stoichiometry, which, jointly with its high defect tolerance,6 make CIGSe forgiving of unintentional compositional perturbations\nDivision of Solar Cell Technology, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Uppsala University, Sweden.

Previously, off-stoichiometry had been tacitly assumed to result from high concentrations of isolated point defects or compensated (2VCu + InCu) defect complexes, with phase separation into ordered defect compounds (ODCs) occurring in extreme cases. However, in our recent study,7 we found that Cu deciency in CIGSe is enabled by a hitherto unknown series of stable ODCs with zinc-blende-derived lattice and cation vacancies arranged in various 2D and 3D conformations. These compounds span a wide range of compositions and can therefore form to facilitate a range of off-stoichiometries, all the while being nearly invisible to X-ray diffraction (XRD). Consequently, a revised model of offstoichiometry in CIGSe was proposed and veried against the existing experimental evidence, resolving crucial contradictions and proving obsolete the classical model of isolated point defects and complexes. In light of these ndings, it is important to understand how common the discovered behavior is and how signicant its role is in making a good solar absorber.\nAs the rst step towards answering these questions, we extend our previous analysis to a broader family of I\u2013III\u2013VI systems. All of them form chalcopyrite I\u2013 III\u2013VI2 compounds, many of which are already employed or have been intensively investigated for multijunction photovoltaics,8\u201314 thermoelectrics,15 light emitting diodes,16 water splitting devices,17\u201320 etc. Some other I\u2013III\u2013VI2 compounds have shown great promise for improving performance in traditional single-junction photovoltaics, both theoretically2 and experimentally.21,22 Despite their supercial similarity, the observed response to the off-stoichiometry of I\u2013III\u2013VI2 chalcopyrites was at times highly divergent from the expectations elicited from CIGSe processing. For instance, AgGaSe2 and CuInS2 are known to have relatively narrow homogeneity (i.e. single-phase chalcopyrite) regions in the phase diagrams,8,23,24 which complicates the absorber deposition, post-deposition processing, and storage.8,9,25\u201331 Therefore, the extended family of I\u2013III\u2013VI systems, while being technologically important for thin-lm photovoltaics, is also well-suited for a comparative study, with opportunities for experimental verication. Our results indicate that only a third of all considered I\u2013III\u2013VI systems exhibit tolerance to offstoichiometry at a level comparable to that in CIGSe. All of them contain Cu as the group-I cation. We found that their common feature is the existence of stable ODC structures with lattice constants similar to those in the respective chalcopyrite compound. In an attempt to generalize these ndings, we propose that high tolerance to off-stoichiometry is more likely if (i) the compound of interest has a lattice closely related by symmetry with a neighboring phase and (ii) the difference in their lattice parameters is sufficiently small. We believe that these simple principles can serve as a convenient jumping -off point for future highthroughput materials exploration and the growth of high-quality absorbers."

The cell geometries and ionic positions were optimized simultaneously until all forces decreased below a threshold of 10 meV A 1. Since no magnetic moment was expected in the I\u2013III\u2013VI compounds, all calculations were performed in the non-spin-polarized regime. Data processing was facilitated by the use of the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) library39 and the structures were visualized by the Visualization for Electronic and STructural Analysis (VESTA) soware.40\nThe vast majority of I\u2013III\u2013VI structures analysed here were obtained via the isovalent substitution of atoms in the Cu\u2013In\u2013Se structures generated and analysed in our previous study.7 Therein, a large set of Cu\u2013In\u2013Se structures with different compositions were created by lling all cationic sites in various supercells of the zinc-blende unit cell with either Cu, In, or a vacancy, while keeping the anionic sublattice fully occupied by Se atoms. Only those structures that fell on the pseudo-binary In2Se3\u2013CuInSe2 tie-line were considered, and only in the case when they exhibited a small deviation from the octet rule \u2013 a well-known prerequisite of low energy structures.41\u201343 The search for stable ODCs was further facilitated by the use of the cluster expansion formalism for a quick onthe-y energy pre-assessment. More details can be found in our previous work.7 In total, 3174 structures containing up to 64 atomic sites (counting vacancies) were investigated using DFT in every I\u2013III\u2013VI system without Al or Te. The estimated number of inequivalent structures analysed using cluster expansion is of the order of 100 000 in every I\u2013III\u2013VI. A smaller subset of 755 structures containing up to 40 atomic sites was studied using DFT for systems with Al or Te \u2013 such a subset was found to be representative of other I\u2013III\u2013VI systems. Moreover, a series of literature structures were taken from earlier publications,44\u201348 the Materials Project repository,49 and the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD)50 \u2013 all modied by isovalent replacement to generate isomorphs for all I\u2013 III\u2013VI systems.\nFor convenience, the I\u2013III\u2013VI compounds are referred to by the numbers in their empirical formulae, i.e. 1:1:2 for I\u2013III\u2013VI2, 1:5:8 for I\u2013III5\u2013VI8, 2:4:7 for I2\u2013 III4\u2013VI7, and so on. The term \u201cODC\u201d is broadly applied to all structures with a zinc-blende-derived lattice and composition distinct from 1:1:2. These are important to differentiate from stable non-ODC compounds with the same compositions (e.g. CuIn5S8) that do exist and are discussed in comparison with their unstable ODC polymorphs below."

The rst (type-I) category is recognized when a system has a series (or rather a continuum) of ODCs on the convex hull. This behavior is\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 | 359\nFig. 1 Examples of convex hulls from different categories: (a) type-I for Cu\u2013Ga\u2013Se, (b) type-II for Cu\u2013In\u2013S, and type-III for (c) Ag\u2013Ga\u2013Se and (d) Ag\u2013In\u2013Te.

Type-II is ascribed to a system when at least one non-ODC compound falls on the convex hull and, thus, greatly destabilizes the ODCs. A good example of a type-II system is Cu\u2013In\u2013S, which forms a stable thio-spinel CuIn5S8 structure that makes all ODCs highly unstable (see Fig. 1b). Type-II behavior is seen for four systems, all of which are suldes with III \u00bc Al or In. Finally, the third (type-III) category is characterized by \u201cintermediate\u201d ODCs (like 2:4:7, 3:5:9, etc.) being unstable with respect to a mixture of chalcopyrite 1:1:2 and conventional ODC (i.e. either 1:3:5 or 1:5:8). This behavior is common for Agbased I\u2013III\u2013VI systems, although details of the convex hull are found to differ on a case-to-case basis. For instance, the instability of intermediate ODCs is more severe for Ag\u2013Ga\u2013Se (see Fig. 1c) as compared to Ag\u2013In\u2013Te (see Fig. 1d), with the 1:5:8 ODC being expected to form alongside AgGaSe2 (as opposed to the 1:3:5 ODC alongside AgInTe2) in the group-I-poor materials. More examples and peculiarities of convex hulls for other systems can be found in Fig. S1.\u2020\nThe proposed classication is useful because it groups I\u2013III\u2013VI systems based on their tolerance to off-stoichiometry. Specically, the continuum of stable ODCs in type-I systems means that they can accommodate an overall group-I deciency without causing thermodynamic instability. Chalcopyrite phases in such systems are anticipated to have wide single-phase regions, i.e. high tolerance to offstoichiometry. On the contrary, the severe instability of ODCs in type-II systems means that the global energy minimum is achieved when the group-I deciency\n360 | Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

A very narrow single-phase chalcopyrite region is thus anticipated for type-II systems. Finally, type-III systems are expected to exhibit some limited tolerance to off-stoichiometry because the enthalpy of the ODCs with near-1:1:2 composition, despite being positive with respect to the convex hull, can still be overcome by the entropy contribution at elevated temperatures. While the exact single-phase region extension is difficult to predict from these ground-state calculations, it is still possible to conclude that the existence of non-ODC phases (as in type-II systems), whether they are predicted to fall on the convex hull in calculations or observed alongside group-I-poor chalcopyrite 1:1:2 phase in experiment, is an indication of poor tolerance to off-stoichiometry. This principle can thus be employed in high-throughput searches for solar absorbers in the future."

            "text": "For the convenience and simplicity of further analysis, a smaller but representative set of ODCs can be compiled. In our previous work, all stable structures with 0.5 # [I]/[III] < 1.0 in CIGSe were found to consist of chalcopyrite-like domains separated by Cu-free regions.7 This structural motif is conrmed for the extended family of I\u2013III\u2013VI herein. The [I]/[III] ratio of ODCs in this composition range is thus determined by the volume fraction of (or spatial separation between) the group-I-free domains, as exemplied for 2:4:7 and 4:6:11 in Fig. 2a and b. Due to the structural similarity, these two ODCs were considered sufficient to represent the entire series of ODCs in the composition range 0.5 # [I]/[III] < 1.0.\nNext, as evidenced from the convex hulls in Fig. S1,\u2020 a number of low-energy 1:5:8 structures have enthalpies slightly (within 1 meV per atom) above the ground state in most I\u2013III\u2013VI systems. For CIGSe, a common motif containing (001) vacancy planes has been identied before.7 This motif is found to be common for the extended family of I\u2013III\u2013VI systems. In fact, out of the 18 systems considered, 14 have the same lowest-enthalpy 1:5:8 ODC structure (see Fig. 2d). For the remaining four, it falls within 0.5 meV per atom above the convex hull. This structure was thus included as the 1:5:8 ODC reference in the smaller ODC set.\nFurthermore, the same 1:3:5 ODC structure (shown in Fig. 2c) was found on the convex hulls in many I\u2013III\u2013VI systems. The representative ODC set was thus complemented with this 1:3:5 ODC. Chalcopyrite 1:1:2 and defected zinc-blende 0:2:3 ODC (obtained by isovalent replacement in b-Ga2Se3)51 were added for completeness. The compiled set of six compounds (i.e. 1:1:2, 4:6:11, 2:4:7, 1:3:5, 1:5:8, and 0:2:3) was thus adopted for further analysis, which was performed with higher accuracy (k-point grids with a density of 4000 points per reciprocal atom, 550 eV energy cut-off, and 5 meV A 1 force threshold). Note that some ODCs from the smaller set are unstable in some I\u2013III\u2013VI systems, but their enthalpies are always the lowest (or close to the lowest) among all zinc-blende-derived structures considered.\nEvolution of lattice geometries with off-stoichiometry\nThe key to understanding the difference between type-I and type-III convex hulls lies in how the lattice geometry changes with respect to the off-stoichiometry, which is quantied here by two parameters: (i) per-anion volume of the ODC\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 | 361\nFig. 2 The most stable structures of (a) 4:6:11, (b) 2:4:7, (c) 1:3:5, and (d) 1:5:8 ODCs in the Cu-In-Se system.

The directions of the a, b, and c vectors are selected based on the orientation of the chalcopyrite-like domains in ODCs. To deduce the parameters of interest, large rectangular supercells were created to match the directions of the chalcopyrite basis and then the supercell parameters were divided by the number of repeating zinc-blende units. The computed values for different I\u2013III\u2013VI systems are summarized in Fig. 3.\nIt is observed that most I\u2013III\u2013VI systems exhibit gradual lattice contraction with decreasing group-I content. This trend could be expected considering that the evolution is mediated by the incorporation of vacancies. A curious exception here is Cu\u2013In\u2013S, in which ODCs have slightly larger volumes than that of the chalcopyrite 1:1:2 phase. The key nding from Fig. 3a and b is that the changes for ODCs in Ag-based I\u2013III\u2013VI are much greater than for their Cu-based counterparts.\n362 | Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\nFig. 3 Analysis of the computed lattice geometries of ODCs in different I\u2013III\u2013VI systems.

The overall maximum is 15% in the Ag\u2013Ga\u2013Se system.\nThe lattice relaxation is generally not uniform, however, as evidenced from the changes in the computed tetragonal distortion in Fig. 3c and d. For the Cu-based I\u2013III\u2013VI systems, in which the 1:1:2 phase has a nearly ideal tetragonal cell geometry (h in the range of 0.98\u20131.01), the off-stoichiometry alters the cell proportions only slightly, maintaining h at roughly the same level. The datapoints for 0:2:3 compounds notably fall off the trend, presumably due to the unique coordination (this is the only stable structure with anions coordinated by two group-III elements and two cation vacancies).7 In contrast, a systematic increase in h with lowering [I]/[III] is evident for Ag-based I\u2013III\u2013VI. A conclusion can therefore be drawn that group-I off-stoichiometry effectively reduces tetragonal\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 | 363\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

The effective ionic radius of Cu (RCu \u00bc 0.60 A; all values are for four-coordinated ions according to Shannon)54 is not far from those of group-III cations (RAl \u00bc 0.39 A, RGa \u00bc 0.47 A, RIn \u00bc 0.62 A), whereas Ag ions are much larger (RAg \u00bc 1.00 A). The greater difference in sizes of group-I and group-III cations produces greater disproportionality between the I\u2013VI and III\u2013VI bonds in Ag\u2013III\u2013VI, resulting in higher distortion values. Consequently, when the Ag content decreases with offstoichiometry in the ODCs, the disproportionality is reduced, the lattice symmetry is increased, and the h values shi towards unity, as reected in Fig. 3c and d.\nCorrelation between enthalpy and relaxation\nDespite being a purely geometric parameter, tetragonal distortion has been previously linked to various phase transitions in I\u2013III\u2013VI systems. Specically, the magnitude of h was suggested to correlate with the order\u2013disorder transition temperature24 and the extension of the single-phase chalcopyrite region.25,55\u201357 The latter hypothesis is particularly relevant for this work, and thus we put it to the test using our computed data.\nAs discussed above, the single-phase region width is determined by the enthalpy of ODCs with near-1:1:2 composition, which have the same structural motif as the 2:4:7 and 4:6:11 ODCs depicted in Fig. 2a and b. The enthalpy of these ODCs relative to the convex hulls can thus be used as a convenient quantication parameter for the tolerance to off-stoichiometry. The enthalpy values computed for the different I\u2013III\u2013VI systems are plotted in Fig. 4a. Note that compounds with other lattices (e.g. spinel 1:5:8) were not included in these calculations. On the surface, the data seems to conrm the hypothesis about the importance of h because the enthalpies are higher for Ag-based I\u2013III\u2013VI (which have lower h for 1:1:2) as compared to those of the Cu-based systems.52 However, when the enthalpies are plotted versus the computed tetragonal distortion, little-or-no\n364 | Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

This result means that the signicance of h with regard to off-stoichiometry has been overstated. The conclusion is not particularly surprising, considering that doubts about the correlation in question are almost as old as the original hypothesis.56\nOn the other side, the knowledge of the structural motif provides guidance to more descriptive structural parameters. As noted earlier,7 intermediate ODC structures can be represented as mixtures of 1:1:2- and 1:5:8-like domains and, thus, their enthalpies might correlate with the mismatch between the lattices of 1:1:2 and 1:5:8 ODC. Ignoring the different domain orientations, and neglecting the relaxation anisotropy described above, the lattice mismatch can be expressed via the ratio of per-anion volumes of 1:1:2 and 1:5:8 ODC. The computed enthalpies above the hull for the representative intermediate ODCs (i.e. 2:4:7 and 4:6:11) are plotted versus this ratio in Fig. 4b. As one can see, the quantities indeed correlate but loosely, presumably due to different bond stretching force constants and the employed model approximations. A better correlation might be found in the future, but it can already be stated that a large difference in the lattice parameters of the 1:5:8 ODC and 1:1:2 compound is a prerequisite for a high enthalpy for the intermediate ODCs and, thus, poor tolerance to off-stoichiometry in I\u2013III\u2013VI2 chalcopyrite absorbers.\nCompetition between spinel and zinc-blende-derived phases\nTo explore the origins of the type-II convex hull behavior, a closer inspection of the 1:5:8 and 0:2:3 phases is carried out. The primary endpoint for this analysis is the difference in enthalpies of zinc-blende-derived ODCs and spinel structures, the sign of which determines if the system in question belongs to the type-II category. All other compositions and symmetries were excluded because they were found to be unstable or otherwise irrelevant for the type-II systems. Fig. 5 depicts the computed data. As one can see, four systems \u2013 Cu\u2013In\u2013S, Ag\u2013In\u2013S, Cu\u2013\nFig. 5 Relative enthalpies of spinel vs. zinc-blende-derived 1:5:8 and 0:2:3 structures in different I\u2013III\u2013VI systems.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 | 365\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

The fact that all four systems are suldes suggests that the spinel lattice might be unable to incorporate larger anions. It is, however, surprising that the spinel structures are unstable for systems with Ga, which in the periodic table is sandwiched between Al and In, as reected in the ionic radii (RAl < RGa < RIn). The reason for this lack of correlation is currently unclear, but it certainly has nothing to do with the type of group-I cation, since the enthalpy trends for 0:2:3 and 1:5:8 are identical. The explanation might be found in more complex structural factors for the spinel lattice,58\u201360 but no attempts to pinpoint it have been made in this work, in order to retain the focus on the tolerance to off-stoichiometry."

A further complication is that phase boundaries are temperature-dependent. In any case, the values in Table 1 are deemed useful for qualitative comparison. For details on the phase diagrams, the authors recommend the following handbooks: ref. 57 and 61, and the other sources cited in Table 1.\nComparing the literature data with our predictions in Fig. 6, one can notice decent (but not perfect) agreement. CuAlS2, CuInS2, and AgInS2 are indeed intolerant to off-stoichiometry and form stable thio-spinel 1:5:8 compounds in the group-I-poor regime, in accordance with the predicted type-II character. The type-II behavior, however, could not be conrmed for AgAlS2 because the relevant data for Ag\u2013Al\u2013S is currently lacking. Still, the phase diagrams sketched in ref. 62 and 63 imply the coexistence of chalcopyrite AgAlS2 with cubic (most likely spinel)\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 | 367\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

Yet, the limitations of the literature data do not allow us to exclude the possibility of misidentication for the Ag\u2013Al\u2013S system.\nThe majority of other Cu-based systems form several stable ODCs and exhibit broad single-phase regions, in accordance with the predominant type-I character. The exceptions here are Cu\u2013Al\u2013Se and Cu\u2013Al\u2013Te, which do not form any ODCs predicted by the calculations. The homogeneity region of CuAlSe2 is also reportedly narrower than expected for a type-I system. A part of the problem here might again be the relative scarcity and shortcomings of experimental studies of the Cu\u2013Al\u2013VI systems.\nExperimental reports also indicate narrower single-phase regions for Ag-based systems compared to their Cu-based analogues, in compliance with the predicted type-III behavior. A major discrepancy exists, however, with regard to the homogeneity regions of AgInTe2 and AgGaTe2, which in both cases are found to be much wider in the experimental phase diagrams than predicted. We nd no credible explanation for this result at present and call on the reader for further investigation.\nImplications for the fabrication of chalcopyrite-based solar cells\nOur results prove that the response to off-stoichiometry of Cu-poor CIGSe cannot be simply extrapolated to other chalcopyrite materials. For Ag-based I\u2013III\u2013VI systems, in order to stay in the single-phase 1:1:2 region, the chalcopyrite phase must contain a higher, and in some cases perfectly stoichiometric [I]/[III] ratio. In type-III systems, if not enough of the group-I element is being provided, a mixture of 1:1:2 chalcopyrite and 1:3:5/1:5:8 ODC becomes the most energetically favorable conguration. Depending on the processing route, this can prevent intermixing (e.g. producing coexisting 1:1:2 and 1:3:5/1:5:8 ODC grains in CIGSe heavily co-alloyed with Ag and Ga)8,9,25 or trigger the segregation of ODCs upon cooling (has not been reported so far, but is expected based on the narrowing of the single-phase region upon cooling).23 Although the impact of ODC precipitates on the absorber is not completely clear,9,25 it is hard to conceive of any benet for the device. Beyond hitting the perfect stoichiometry, a possible strategy to increase the tolerance to offstoichiometry in type-III systems is alloying with other elements, like alkalis. In particular, alkali elements are known to accumulate in the ODCs,25,90 which may enhance the stabilities of the intermediate ODCs (i.e. 2:4:7 and 4:6:11), converting the I\u2013III\u2013VI of interest into a type-I system. This prospect is supported by the expansion of the single-phase 1:1:2 region for CIGSe observed with Na addition,91 as well as the reported variance in ODC content with respect to the type and concentration of alkali impurities.8,92\u201395 However, the proposed solution remains hypothetical until verication is provided.\nOn the other hand, the addition of alkalis has little chance of changing the character of type-II systems because a much larger enthalpy difference (between the spinel and tetragonal 1:5:8 ODC phases) would need to be compensated for. A practical solution here may instead lie in the modication of the deposition protocol and/or post-deposition treatments to account for the peculiarities of the growth kinetics. For example, three-stage elemental co-evaporation \u2013 a standard method of CIGSe deposition \u2013 yields a bi-layer lm morphology for sulde Cu(In,Ga)S2 due to the segregation of a spinel CuIn5S8-like layer with low [Ga]/[In]\n368 | Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

This discrepancy leads to a miscibility gap between spinel CuIn5S8 and Cu-poor tetragonal Cu1 xGa1+x/3S2 (where 0 < x # 0.75), with both phases being able to accept only a small concentration of the other group-III element. At the same time, stoichiometric CuInS2 and CuGaS2 are known to exhibit full miscibility,18,26,96 and therefore Cu(In,Ga)S2 alloys can form readily when [Cu]/[III] $ 1. Thus, a modied strategy for the co-evaporation growth of Cu\u2013(In,Ga)\u2013S lms could attempt to rst grow Cu1 xGa1+x/3S2 and start adding indium only when [Cu]/[Ga] exceeds unity (i.e. by depositing Ga and In during the rst and third coevaporation stages, respectively). A more straightforward but practically challenging solution could be to maintain [Cu]/[III] \u00bc 1 throughout the deposition while varying [Ga]/[In], if band gap grading is intended. One can try ne-tuning the composition by depositing a sacricial CuxS layer on top of slightly Cudecient Cu(In,Ga)S2, followed by annealing and KCN etching. The intended benet of such post-deposition treatment over the simple KCN etching of Cu-rich Cu(In,Ga)S2 lm is that CuxS would be conned to the lm surface, allowing it to be readily and effectively removed. Unfortunately, the above recommendations are not universal and should be adjusted to every I\u2013III\u2013VI system or alloy individually."

The resulting morphologies are likely to induce additional losses due to unfavorable band alignment, reduction in the active absorber volume, accumulation of recombination centers at interfaces, and so on. The possibility of mechanical failures and thermal instabilities should be expected to increase as well. Therefore, the benet of high tolerance to off-stoichiometry is practical \u2013 it allows the loosening of the composition control requirements during synthesis without triggering the segregation of secondary phases \u2013 but it does not make the main absorber phase better by itself. Intrinsic point defects are present in bulk either way and, thus, defect tolerance is still necessary to avoid the formation of recombination centers. In other words, defect tolerance and tolerance to off-stoichiometry are complementary features that manifest themselves at different defect concentrations. Specically, the equilibrium point defect concentration of 1020 cm 3 is huge when talking about intrinsic defects, but the off-stoichiometry it produces is below the detection limit for most (if not all) material characterization tools. From the other side, the experimentally measured off-stoichiometry cannot plausibly be accommodated by isolated point defects because interaction and clustering cannot be avoided at such small distances (at most 10 A separation between defect complexes in CIGSe at [Cu]/[In] \u00bc 0.8, assuming that they form a uniform 3D grid).\nOur conclusion that only one-third of I\u2013III\u2013VI2 chalcopyrites considered can accept group-I deciency suggests that tolerance to off-stoichiometry is not\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Faraday Discuss., 2022, 239, 357\u2013374 | 369\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

Instead, judging by the trends for I\u2013III\u2013VI systems, we suggest that high tolerance to off-stoichiometry is more probable for a compound meeting two simple conditions. First, it should have a closely related lattice symmetry with the phase it coexists in the equilibrium (i.e. forming a two-phase region). Second, the lattice constants of these two phases should be sufficiently similar. Both conditions sound intuitive, consistent with classical examples of non-stoichiometric compounds, and potentially useful for high-throughput materials screening. For instance, the future identication of novel solar absorbers with a practically favorable high tolerance to off-stoichiometry could be done by analyzing the experimental lattice geometries of all known compounds in the investigated system. However, we must acknowledge that the proposed indicators must be taken with a pinch of salt until the correlation is proven valid for a wider range of materials systems."

            "text": "When noticing the structural similarities of I\u2013III\u2013VI2 isomorphs, one might be forgiven for projecting the behavior of CIGSe onto the entire family of I\u2013III\u2013VI compounds. It might be a reasonable guess for ideal 1:1:2 chalcopyrites, but it is certainly invalid for off-stoichiometric materials. Our stability analysis reveals three types of material response to group-I deciency. Crucially, only a third of all I\u2013III\u2013VI systems investigated are predicted to demonstrate tolerance to offstoichiometry at the level of that in CIGSe. This is unfortunate because the possibility of depositing a homogeneous single-phase absorber without the need for precise composition control is favorable for the device. One way that things can go wrong in a I\u2013III\u2013VI system is when a spinel 1:5:8 or 0:2:3 phase has a much lower enthalpy than its zinc-blende-derived ODC counterpart, resulting in a narrow one-phase chalcopyrite region that causes troubles for the absorber deposition and processing. This problem is predicted for four sulde I\u2013III\u2013VI systems with the group-III element being either In or Al, while the systems with III \u00bc Ga are surprisingly devoid of this issue, in spite of the trend in ionic radii dictating otherwise. A similar but less severe issue emerges when ODCs with 0.5 < [I]/[III] < 1.0 are destabilized and shied above the convex hull. In the analyzed chalcopyrite family, this primarily happens due to the replacement of smaller copper with larger silver ions. The lattice relaxation is emblematical of these changes and it can therefore serve as an indicator of solar absorber materials tolerant to off-stoichiometry. Specically, a compound is deemed to have a greater chance of being tolerant to off-stoichiometry if: (i) its lattice exhibits a close symmetry relationship with the phase it coexists with in the two-phase region of the phase diagram and (ii) lattice constants of these phases are sufficiently close. These simple principles can be integrated into high-throughput screening and ultimately accelerate the discovery of materials for next-generation photovoltaics and beyond."
