INTRODUCTION\nA recent finding by Boz\u030covic\u0301 et al.1 that behavior of cuprate superconductors on the overdoped side of their phase diagram deviates strongly from the expected BCS behavior has generated a lot of attention. Boz\u030covic\u0301 et al. analyzed thousands of La2\u2212xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) thin films, with thicknesses ranging from 0.66 nm to over 100 nm, and found that on the overdoped side the superfluid density decreases as a linear function of superconducting critical temperature Tc, and eventually goes to zero at the quantum critical point. This is stark contrast with the Homes\u2019 law2:\n\u03c1s \u221d Tc \u03c3dc (1)\nwhere \u03c1s is the superfluid density and \u03c3dc is dc conductivity just above Tc. Eq. 1 predicts that when dc conductivity increases as a result of doping, the superfluid density should increase as well, assuming that the same percentage of charge carriers condenses. This is in sharp contrast with the results of Boz\u030covic\u0301 et al.\nIn Fig. 1 we display updated Homes plot2, which includes all the previous data3, along with Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s new data on LSCO films shown with open magenta circles. The plot clearly shows that Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s data does indeed violate the Homes\u2019 law. The optimally doped film, as well as the films close to that doping level are on the scaling line. However, as doping increases on the overdoped side, the points move off the scaling line and progress perpendicular to the line. At the highest doping levels, the points take an additional downturn.\nKogan recently offered an explanation of Homes\u2019\nscaling4, as well as the deviations from it. He argued that Homes\u2019 law is a direct consequence of BCS theory and applies not only to dirty, but also to moderately clean superconductors. Moreover, Kogan showed that for clean superconductors, for which the ratio of superconducting coherence length \u03be0 and the mean free path l is on the order \u03be0/l \u223c 1 or smaller, deviations from the scaling are expected. He predicted that clean superconductors should move below the scaling line. That behavior had indeed been observed previously3 in Sr2RuO4 (three different samples are shown with orange flakes in Fig. 1), which has been known to be a clean-limit superconductor (\u03be0/l 1). Similarly, it was shown that elemental niobium in the clean limit (when recrystallized in ultra high vacuum) also moves below the scaling line5. Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s LSCO films have been known to be ultra clean, with a mean free path l >\u223c 4 \u00b5m (Ref. 1), exceeding their in-plane coherence length (on the order of 20\u201330 A\u030a, Ref. 6) by at least two orders of magnitude. Therefore, it is not surprising that Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s films violate the Homes\u2019 law and move below the scaling line. However, as we show below, there could be other reasons for the violation of Homes\u2019 law."

            "text": "In order to explore the violation of Homes\u2019 law systematically we have conducted an extensive literature search for the relevant experimental parameters from Eq. (1) (\u03c1s, \u03c3dc and Tc). Even though studies of the overdoped side are scarce, we have collected enough data to unveil the trends. Early reports of measurements performed on\nTypeset by REVTEX\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n13 98\n7v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nup r-\nco n]\n2 8\nJu n\n20 22\nceramic, sintered, polycrystalline or powder samples were not considered here7. In Fig. 2(a) we plot the superfluid density \u03c1s for two families of cuprate superconductors: LSCO1,14\u201317 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 (Bi2212)\n18. The superfluid density is shown as a function of reduced critical temperature Tc/Tc,max, where Tc,max is the maximal critical temperature (i.e. optimal doping) for a given family19. Only the overdoped side of the phase diagram is shown, with Tc/Tc,max = 1 being the optimal doping and Tc decreases as doping increases. We point out that Fig. 2(a) includes the data for both thin films (shown with open circles) and bulk single crystals (shown with full circles). The plot also includes our recent infrared (IR) measurement15 on a heavily overdoped bulk single crystal LSCO with Tc= 15 K, combined with a previous IR measurement on optimally doped LSCO16. We note that this heavily overdoped sample does not violate the Homes scaling (see Fig. 1).\nAs shown previously1 the superfluid density of Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s films1 decreases as a linear function of Tc, except at the highest dopings where the dependence becomes parabolic. For comparison, Fig. 2(a) also includes the results on LSCO films from Lemberger\u2019s group14. Even though only several overdoped films were\nmeasured14, they show very similar absolute values and doping dependence as Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s films, and they also violate Homes\u2019 scaling (see Fig. 1). However, the most striking finding revealed by Fig. 2(a) is that the superfluid density in bulk samples (full symbols) does not seem to decease with doping. In bulk single crystal LSCO samples the superfluid density tends to saturate15,16 or increase on the overdoped side17. The superfluid density in Bi2212 also increases with doping18. It is clear from Fig. 2(a) that the trend in the doping dependence is different for bulk samples and thin films: the superfluid density in bulk samples, contrary to thin films, does not decrease on the overdoped side."

We notice that Boz\u030covic\u0301 films1 have the strongest doping dependence, and at the highest doping levels their values are several times greater compared to other films or bulk samples. Lemberger films14 have significantly lower conductivity, even though they have comparable superfluid density (Fig. 2(a)). On the other hand, bulk samples (full circles) display little doping dependence of their \u03c3dc. The values of \u03c3dc obtained from IR spectroscopy\n15,16 (orange stars) are slightly lower.\nIn Fig. 3 we display the values of dc conductivity just above Tc, \u03c3dc, from several different measurements on LSCO. The plot includes both thin films (open circles) from Boz\u030covic\u03011 and Lemberger14 groups, as well as two sets of measurements on bulk single crystals28,29 (full circles). We also plot the results of IR measurements on an optimally and a heavily overdoped LSCO single crystals15,16. Similar to the superfluid density (Fig. 2) the conductivity is shown as a function of reduced critical temperature Tc/Tc,max, and only on the overdoped side of the phase diagram. It is immediately clear that Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s films are superior in terms of their conductivity. They show the strongest doping dependence, and at the highest doping levels (Tc/T max c \u2248 0.1) their conductivity is approximately three times higher compared to all other samples (bulk or film). We also note that overdoped bulk samples might have issues with inhomogeneities15, which can result in their conductivity being lower compared to films.\nIn spite of this finding, we argue that this high normal state conductivity of Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s films is not the main reason for the violation of Homes\u2019 law. Namely, Fig.1 also includes the data for Lemberger films (open blue circles) which also violate the scaling, i.e. as doping increases they move below the scaling line. Even though their conductivity is several times smaller compared with Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s films, their superfluid density is comparable and it follows similar doping dependence (Fig. 2(a)).\n4 Therefore we can conclude that the main reason for the Homes\u2019 law violation is the suppression of superfluid density in thin films compared with bulk crystals."

Using the data from different sources can lead to conflicting results3,16,30. The experimental values for optimally doped LSCO that we have compiled from the literature fully support this argument. To illustrate the point, in Table I we list the values of superfluid density \u03c1s for optimally doped LSCO from several different sources. It can be seen that Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s film has the highest superfluid density (\u03c1s,max), and that other values can be smaller by as much as 80 %. We also note that the value of \u03c1s obtained in Ref. 31 on Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s film, but using a different experimental technique is about 30 % smaller. Similarly, Tajima\u2019s IR and muon spectroscopy measurements have resulted in superfluid densities that differ by almost a factor of three16,32. Therefore one must not compare the absolute values of superfluid density obtained using different experimental techniques, even when taken on the same sample or film. However, we point out that the measurements in Ref. 1 were performed on thousands of samples, grown and measured using the same procedure, which assures that their relative values (i.e. their doping dependence) are reliably extracted and are intrinsic property of these LSCO films."

            "heading": "VI. DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In this section we discuss possible scenarios that might be able to account for the effects observed above. It has been know for a long time that in thin films of conventional superconductors (such as Sn33) the so-called microscopically granular superconductivity might arise. These systems were modeled as Josephson junction arrays and it was shown that quantum fluctuations play an important role in suppressing superconductivity in them34,35. Similar ideas were also discussed in relation to superconductivity in the cuprates36, and they might also apply to overdoped LSCO films. Further support comes from a recent experimental study of heavily overdoped LSCO37.\nMore recently, quantum phase fluctuations have been argued to explain strong suppression of superfluid density in Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s overdopded LSCO films. Schneder employed finite size scaling analysis38 which uncovered that suppression is consistent with a finite length limited 3DXY transition39; in some films this limiting length is set by the film thickness, and in others by inhomogeneities. Moreover, the analysis reveals a crossover from thermal\nto quantum critical regime as Tc \u2192 0, and Schneider argues that in Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s overdoped LSCO films the suppression of superfluid density is driven by quantum phase fluctuations.\nAdditional experimental support for quantum phase fluctuations\u2019 driven suppression of superfluid density comes from the recent terahertz spectroscopy measurements on Boz\u030covic\u0301\u2019s LSCO films by Mahmood et al.41. They discovered that below Tc a significant fraction of charge carriers remains uncondensed in a wide Drude-like peak41 and argued that quantum phase fluctuations play an important role in suppressing the superfluid density.\nBased on all these findings we suggest that in thin films quantum confinement (i.e. reduced dimensionality) enhances quantum phase fluctuations, making them more efficient in preventing pair formation and reducing the superfluid density. This might result in suppression of superfluid density in overdoped thin films, compared with bulk samples. If this suggestion is correct, one might expect that similar behavior could also be observed in pnictide thin films.\nThe final issues that we discuss here is what happens as the quantum critical point (Tc \u2192 0) is approached. In thin films the superfluid density is continuously suppressed and goes to zero as Tc \u2192 0. Based on Fig. 2 we hypothesize that in bulk samples the superfluid density will not be continuously suppressed to zero, but instead will experience an abrupt drop once the critical doping is reached. Measurements on bulk samples with such high doping levels are currently not available."

Analyzing the existing literature data, we have unraveled that the main reason for this violation is the stronger suppression of superfluid density in thin films, compared to bulk single crystals. We hypothesize that in thin films superfluid density is suppressed by quantum phase fluctuations. Our results have uncovered a fundamental difference between the superfluid density in bulk samples and thin films. These findings call for measurements of superfluid density in bulk cuprate samples close to the quantum critical point, i.e. in the region where Tc \u2192 0, as well as on overdoped pnictide films. Note added in proof: We only recently became aware of two studies Refs. (42,43) reporting superfluid density in bulk single crystals of overedoped Tl-2201. The results of these papers are consistent with our main findings."

In our opinion, extracting superfluid density, or any other transport or thermodynamic property, from ceramic, sintered, polycrystalline or powder samples is unreliable and untrustworthy. We do point out, however, that saturation or even increase of superfluid density on the overdoped side was observed in polycrystalline LSCO8, polycrystalline Hg-12018, ceramic Bi-22129, ceramic Bi22239 and ceramic Y-1239. The only two cuprate families in which a decrease in superfluid density was observed were sintered ceramic9 and polycrystalline10 Tl-2201, as well as polycrystalline Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2(Cu1\u2212zZnz)3O7\u2212\u03b4\n11.
