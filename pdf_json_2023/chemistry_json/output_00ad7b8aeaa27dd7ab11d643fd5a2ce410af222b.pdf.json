    "abstractText": "While 2021 ended with the world engulfed in the COVID-19 Omicron wave, 2022 has ended in almost all countries, except China, with COVID-19 being likened to the flu. In this context, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized only 37 new drugs this year compared to an average of 52 in the last four years. Thus 2022 is the second lowest harvest after 2016 in the last six years. This ranking may be transient and will be confirmed in the coming years. In this regard, the reduction in the number of drugs accepted by the FDA this year applies only to the so-called small molecules as there has been no variation in the respective numbers of biologics or TIDES (peptides and oligonucleotides). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) continue to be the class with the most drugs authorized (9), while proteins/enzymes (5) and an antibody\u2013drug conjugate complete the biologics harvest. In 2022, five TIDES and seven drugs inspired by natural products have received the green light, thus showing the same tendency as in previous years. Finally, pharmaceutical agents with nitrogen aromatic heterocycles and/or fluorine atoms continue to be predominant among small molecules this year. Furthermore, three drugs have been approved for imaging, reinforcing the trend in recent years for this class of treatments. A keyword in 2022 is bispecificity since four drugs have this property (two mAbs, one protein, and one peptide). Herein, the 37 new drugs approved by the FDA in 2022 are analyzed. On the basis of chemical structure alone, these drugs are classified as the following: biologics (antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, proteins/enzymes), TIDES (peptide and oligonucleotides), combined drugs, natural products; nitrogen aromatic heterocycles, fluorinecontaining molecules, and other small molecules.",

We were submerged in a wave of the COVID-19 pandemic produced by the Omicron variant, and we had no clear understanding of how the approved vaccines would respond to the new variant and, therefore, of how \u201cnormality\u201d could be achieved again. Right now, a year later, although the situation in China is not entirely clear, the vast majority of countries have been able to efficiently manage the COVID-19 pandemic, and this disease is increasingly treated in a similar way to others such as influenza (flu), which also causes a large number of deaths worldwide every year. Although many pharmaceutical companies have launched vaccine programs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic back in 2020, only two vaccines, both mRNAbased, produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are used in most countries, except for China, Russia, and their areas of influence. This achievement has boosted the standing of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1038. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28031038 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1038 2 of 13\nmRNA technology for the development of vaccines for other diseases, including various types of cancer. As expected, the number of drugs accepted by the FDA in 2020 and 2021 with respect to previous years was not affected by the pandemic: 50 in 2021, 53 in 2020, 48 in 2019, and 59 in 2018 [1,2]. The maintenance of the numbers is attributed to the slow implementation processes of the pharmaceutical industry, which make any major change take years to be reflected in the number of drugs accepted. However, a question is raised regarding the significant decrease in the number of drugs approved in 2022 (only 37) [3]: are we entering a valley in the drug discovery arena, or is this figure temporary? This question will be answered in the coming years. The 37 drugs approved this year are divided between 15 biologics (14, 13, 10, and 17 in 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively) [2,3] and 22 new chemical entities (NCEs), including hyperpolarized Xe-129 in this last category (36, 40, 38, and 42 in 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively) (Figure 1) [2,3]. While the number of biologics approved is in full agreement with the tendency shown by this category over recent years, there are significantly fewer NCEs (22 vs. 37 on average, which represents only 55%). This year, biologics account for 40% of all drugs, when in recent years this figure was approximately 27% (96 biologics out of a total of 352 drugs since 2014) [2].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15\nstanding of mRNA technology for the development of vaccines for other diseases, includ-\ning various types of cancer.\nAs expected, the number of drugs accepted by the FDA in 2020 and 2021 with respect\nto previous years was not affected by the pandemic: 50 in 2021, 53 in 2020, 48 in 2019, and\n59 in 2018 [1,2].

            "text": "Table 1 shows the fifteen biologics that have been approved in 2022, of which nine are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), one an antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC), and five proteins, namely a toxin, a fusion protein, a hormone (glycoprotein), and two enzymes (Table 1).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1038 3 of 13\nRegarding biologics, one of the highlights of this year has been the approval of three drugs, namely two mAbs and one fusion protein, that show bispecificity. Thus, these drugs can simultaneously bind to two distinct epitopes on one antigen or to two different antigens. Teclistamab-cqyv (TecvayliTM), which targets the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, is used for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Faricimab-svoa (VabysmoTM) is indicated for the treatment of neovascular and diabetic macular degeneration, and it targets vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin 2. The fusion protein tebentafusp-tebn (KimmtrakTM), which is a bispecific gp100 peptideHLA-directed CD3 T cell engager, is indicated for the treatment of unresectable/metastatic eye cancer. In previous years, three other bispecific antibodies were approved by the FDA [2]. In 2014, blinatumomab (BlincytoTM), targeting CD19 and CD3, was authorized for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Four years later, in 2018, emicizumab (HemlibraTM), which targets clotting factors IXa and X, was approved for hemophilia A. Finally, in 2021, amivantamab-vmjw (RybrevantTM), which targets epidermal growth factor and MET receptors, received authorization for the treatment of cancer. In addition to the two aforementioned bispecific mAbs approved this year, seven more mAbs received the green light, together accounting for 24% (9 vs. 37) of all the drugs accepted by the FDA in 2022. Interestingly, OpdualagTM is a combination of two mAbs (nivolumab and relatlimabrmbw), and it is used for the treatment of unresectable/metastatic melanoma. Nivolumab (OpdivoTM) is also commercialized alone for a large number of cancer-related diseases. Cancer continues to be the first target for mAbs. In addition to the two mAbs previously discussed, three more have been approved for cancer this year, namely mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (ElahereTM), tremelimumab-actl (ImjudoTM), and osunetuzumab-axgb (LunsumioTM). However, following the trend of previous years, mAbs have been approved\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1038 4 of 13\nfor others targets. In addition to faricimab-svoa (VabysmoTM) for macular degeneration, authorization has been given to spesolimab-sbzo (SpevigoTM) for psoriasis, teplizumabmzwv (TzieldTM) for diabetes type 1, and ublituximab-xiiy (BriumviTM) for relapsed multiple sclerosis. On a negative note regarding mAb, 2022 has seen controversy around aducanumabavwa (AduhelmTM), which was approved last year for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [1,2]. Although the clinical phase IV for this drug is still underway, the market prospects are in line with concerns about its effectiveness. However, as often happens in the roller coaster ride of drug discovery, Biogen, the company that developed aducanumabavwa (AduhelmTM), associated with Eisai, announced in November this year that another mAb, lecanemab, showed success in clinical trials and their intention of securing its approval by the FDA in 2023 [6]. In terms of ADCs, 2022 has continued with a trickle of this type of drug. Thus, mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (ElahereTM) (Figure 2) for ovarian cancer has been approved, being the 14th of this class on the market. This ADC contains as a payload drug mersantine, an analog of maytansine (DM4), which is a microtubule-targeted cytotoxic agent also present in rastuzumab emtansine (KadcylaTM), which was approved by the FDA in 2013 [2]. Mersantine is linked to the Lys of the anti-folate receptor 1 through a cleavable linker formed by a disulfide bridge, whose lability to glutathione is modulated by two methyl groups in the \u03b1-position of the disulfide bridge. In addition, the linker contains a sulfonic acid moiety, which confers hydrophilicity to the linker to facilitate bioconjugation. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 15\nIn addition to the fusion protein tebentafusp-tebn (KimmtrakTM), four more proteins\nhave been approved this year. Eflapegrastim-xnst (RolvedonTM) is a hormone (glycopro-\ntein) that prevents infections in adults with febrile neutropenia associated with myelosup-\npressive anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of non-myeloid malignancies. It is a long-\nacting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analog that produces granulocytes and stem cells to be released into the bloodstream by stimulation of the bone marrow. Olipudase alfa-rpcp (XenpozymeTM) is an enzyme to treat acid sphingomyelinase defi-\nciency (ASMD, Niemann-Pick disease), a metabolic genetic disorder that causes brain\ndamage and swelling of organs such as the spleen and liver. Treatment with this drug can\nimprove the function of affected organs and tissues, based on clinical trials. At the end of the year, anacaulase-bcdb (NexoBridTM), which is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes iso-\nlated from the pineapple plant, was approved for the debridement (removal of eschar,\nwhich is dead and damaged tissue) of severe burn wounds.\nThis year another botulinum toxin, daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm (DaxxifyTM) , has\nbeen authorized for the temporary improvement of the appearance of eyebrows. This molecule joins other toxins from the same family that were authorized by the FDA in previous years [2], such as prabotulinumtoxin (JeuveauTM), approved in 2019 for a similar indication; abobotulinumtoxinA (DysportTM), approved in 2016 for the treatment of lower-limb spasticity in pediatric patients; and onabotulinumtoxinA (BotoxTM), approved in 2010 for\nchronic migraine in prophylactic treatments.

Comprising 39 amino acids, tirzepatide is one of the largest synthetic peptides on the market. It has a lipidated sidechain pending at a Lys residue situated in the middle of the backbone (position 20). The sidechain is formed by eicosanedioic acid (C20 diacid) linked through the \u03b3-carboxylic group of the Glu residue and two mini-polyethyleneglycol (PEG) moieties [(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)acetic acid] to the \u03b5-amino of the Lys. Two amino acids of the backbone are aminoisobutyric acid (Aib). These two residues and the sidechain confer tirzepatide stability to metabolism.

            "text": "Health and well-being have been magic words for society throughout history. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic has served to highlight the importance of having a wellstructured and solid health ecosystem available to the entire population. In this regard, the role played by pharmaceutical companies is fundamental. For the middle classes, these companies have ceased to be distant entities and are recognized as being part of the solution, with positive connotations in many aspects but also some negative ones. The pharmaceutical sector has acted with rigor and efficiency during the pandemic and has entered millions of homes, with brand names and even the names of some of the key researchers becoming known, thus bringing about even greater responsibility for the sector. Regarding the treatment of COVID-19, it can be concluded that this year there have been no major developments. The only two fully FDA-approved vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are prevalent, and the FDA has not granted EUA to new treatments. Thus, only the antivirals molnupiravir (LagevrioTM), remdesivir (VekluryTM) (nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, respectively), and PaxlovidTM, which contains nirmatrelvir and the ritonavir, have received authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in individuals at high risk of progressing to severe status [7]. Furthermore, the long-acting antibody combination EvusheldTM (co-package of tixagevimab with cilgavimab) has been authorized as a preventative treatment [7]. For immunocompromised people with COVID-19, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends convalescent plasma [8], which uses blood from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to treat others. The webpage of the CDC even recommends over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19. In the context of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, if we were to assess the strength of the pharmaceutical industry in 2022 based on the number of new drugs accepted by the FDA, the conclusion could be worrying as the number has been significantly lower than in previous years (37 vs. an average of 52.5 for the last 4 years) [2]. However, it should be considered that the process of putting a drug onto the market is slow and that this number may therefore reflect only a slowdown in bureaucratic and administrative processes. In any case, this relative decrease in the number of drugs should be attributed more to small molecules than to biologics, since the 15 biologics accepted represent the second-best harvest after 2018, when 17 were authorized [2]. Figure 14 shows a breakdown of FDA approvals this year based on the chemical structure of the drugs.

These figures reflect the expansion of this class of drugs for diseases other than cancer, which was the major indication of this class for many years. Next year, lecanemab is expected to be approved for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This will be the second mAb for this target after aducanumab-avwa (AduhelmTM), authorized in 2021, and for which the results are not entirely conclusive. Another ADC, namely soravtansine-gynx (ElahereTM), has been approved this year. A distinctive feature of this drug is the reversible linker, which is a disulfide bridge flanked by a dimethyl moiety to ensure better stability to the glutathione, and sulfonic acid to increase the hydrophilicity of the linker. Furthermore, in 2022, five proteins have been approved, among them a third botulinum toxin daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm (DaxxifyTM). It is interesting to highlight the presence of anacaulase-bcdb (NexoBridTM), a mixture of proteolytic enzymes isolated from the pineapple plant, which can fall in the traditional or popular medicine category. In addition, four peptides and one oligonucleotide have been given the green light, tirzepatide (MounjaroTM) being the most outstanding peptide for its complexity (39 amino acids with an additional sidechain containing a long fatty acid), but more important for its indications: diabetes type 2 and the control of the obesity. The second peptide approved, terlipressin (TerlivazTM), is a simple disulfide cyclic peptide with three Gly residues added to the well-known and studied lysine vasopressin structure. The oligonucleotide approved, vutrisiran, is a double-stranded siRNA, very similar to inclisiran, lumasiran, and givosiran, which were authorized in recent years. In addition to the double strand, all these drugs have the same structural features to confer stability, namely tiophosphate linkages, F and methoxy ribonucleoside units, and the ESC, which is a short dendrimer bearing N-acetylgalactosamine. It is expected that more members of this class of drugs will reach the market in the coming years.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1038 13 of 13\nIn 2022, the use of hyperpolarized Xe-129 (XenoviewTM) was authorized for MRI, thus showing that the use of hyperpolarized noble gasses (He-3 and Xe-129) is an emerging opportunity for diagnostics. In the natural product section, this year has witnessed the approval of seven drugs, namely the botulinum toxin daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm, anacaulase-bcdb, which is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes from the pineapple plant, and five small molecules, two of them belonging to the steroid class, which is one of the most frequent on the market. If biologics and peptides are excluded from the analysis, a large majority of the drugs approved this year are either nitrogen aromatic heterocycle- or fluorine-based. In many cases, both moieties are present in the same drug. The presence of nitrogen aromatic heterocycle- and fluorine-based drugs continues to be a constant. Thus, if biologics and peptides are excluded from the analysis, 82% of the drugs approved this year contain the first moiety and 33% the second. Although oncology continues to be the main indication of the drugs approved by the FDA, this year, interestingly, dermatology is the second one. We consider that our honorific title \u201cMolecule of the Year 2022\u201d should go to the peptide tirzepatide (MounjaroTM), which is a bispecific molecule GIP and GLP-1 receptors, being a first-in-class drug. Several peptides on the market mimic GLP-1, but this is the first one that also mimics GIP. This is also the first fully synthetic peptide launched by Eli Lilly through a hybrid solid-phase synthesis (synthesis of the three protected fragments) and solution synthesis (assembly on the protected fragments and final global deprotection) approach. The sales are forecasted to reach more than $10 billion.\nAuthor Contributions: Both authors wrote the paper.
