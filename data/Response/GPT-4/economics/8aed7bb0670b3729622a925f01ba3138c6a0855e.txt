Comparative Effectiveness of Surfactant Formulations Across Diverse Populations: A multi-country, multicenter trial comparing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different surfactant formulations (e.g., beractant, calfactant, poractant alfa) across diverse populations. This study could help understand the variability in response due to genetic or regional differences, providing insights into personalized medicine approaches for treating neonatal RDS.

Long-term Economic and Clinical Outcomes of Surfactant Therapy: A longitudinal study assessing the long-term health outcomes and economic impacts of early vs. late surfactant administration in neonates with RDS. This research could include follow-up into childhood to evaluate the incidence of chronic lung diseases, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and their associated healthcare costs.

Cost-Effectiveness of Surfactant Administration Strategies in Low-Income Settings: Since the reviewed studies were limited to developed and pharmerging countries, there's a significant research opportunity in evaluating the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of surfactant therapy in low-income countries, where healthcare resources are more constrained, and the burden of preterm births may be higher.

Impact of Innovative Surfactant Administration Techniques on HCRU and Outcomes: Investigating newer, less invasive surfactant administration techniques (e.g., aerosolized surfactants) and their impact on hospitalization duration, need for mechanical ventilation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates, and overall healthcare costs. This could also explore the potential for reducing the intensity of care required for preterm infants with RDS.

Development and Validation of Predictive Models for Surfactant Therapy Outcomes: Utilizing machine learning and big data analytics to develop predictive models that can accurately identify neonates with RDS who would benefit most from early surfactant therapy. Such models could incorporate clinical, genetic, and demographic data to optimize treatment decisions, improve outcomes, and reduce unnecessary healthcare spending.
