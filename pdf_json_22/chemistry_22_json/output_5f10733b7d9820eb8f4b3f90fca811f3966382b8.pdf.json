    "abstractText": "Resin glycosides, mainly distributed in plants of the family Convolvulaceae, are a class of novel and complex glycolipids. Their structural complexity and significant biological activities have received much attention from synthetic chemists, and a number of interesting resin glycosides have been synthesized. The synthesized resin glycosides and their analogues not only helped in structural verification, structural modification, and further biological activity exploration but also provided enlightenment for the synthesis of glycoside compounds. Herein, the present review summarizes the application of various efforts toward the synthesis of resin glycosides in the last decade.",

Their structural complexity and significant biological activities have received much attention from synthetic chemists, and a number of interesting resin glycosides have been synthesized. The synthesized resin glycosides and their analogues not only helped in structural verification, structural modification, and further biological activity exploration but also provided enlightenment for the synthesis of glycoside compounds. Herein, the present review summarizes the application of various efforts toward the synthesis of resin glycosides in the last decade.\nKEYWORDS\nresin glycosides, total synthesis, glycolipids, macrolactonization, glycosylation\nIntroduction\nNatural products have significantly contributed to the development of new drugs for human disorders (Newman and Cragg, 2020). Resin glycosides are a class of novel and complex natural glycolipids mainly discovered in plants of the family Convolvulaceae. Because of the diversified structures and various bioactivities, resin glycosides have attracted plenty of interests from organic chemists and pharmacologists (PeredaMiranda et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2022). Up to now, hundreds of resin glycosides and their derivatives have been identified and reported, some of which exhibited significant biological activities, such as cytotoxic (Fan et al., 2014; Ono et al., 2019), anti-viral (Ono et al., 2014), anticonvulsant (Castro-Garc\u00eda et al., 2018), anti-tumor migration (Chen et al., 2017), sedative (Le\u00f3n-Rivera et al., 2014), vasorelaxant (Le\u00f3n-Rivera et al., 2014), and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects (Pan et al., 2015), as well as multidrug-resistant reversal effects on both microbial pathogens and mammalian cancer cells (FigueroaGonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2018; Lira-Ric\u00e1rdez and Pereda-Miranda. 2020), indicating their potential as lead compounds for drug discovery. However, not enough indepth biological exploitation has been taken place. Possible reasons could be the difficulties on the isolation and purification.\nThe structures of resin glycosides consist of three ingredients: oligosaccharide chain, long-chain fatty acid aglycone, and modified acyl groups (Pereda-Miranda et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2022). The sugar units of oligosaccharides mostly range from three to seven, with D-glucose (Glc), L-rhamnose (Rha), D-fucose (Fuc), D-quinovose (Qui), D-xylose"

The aglycones are usually monohydroxy to trihydroxy C14\u2013C17 long-chain fatty acids, which often link through an intramolecular esterification with the oligosaccharide chain to\nform a macrolactone ring. The oligosaccharide residues are also modified with some fatty acids (Fan et al., 2022). Due to the variation in the oligosaccharide units and sequence, aglycone, macrolactone site, acylated residues, and the formation of the\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org02\ndimers, the structural complexity of resin glycosides has received much attention from synthetic chemists.\nThe first total synthesis of resin glycosides was published in the 1990s (Lu et al., 1997), and then many resin glycosides have been synthesized successfully. The construction of the macrolide structures and oligosaccharide chains presented a major challenge to develop methodologies for their synthesis. In 2010, Pereda-Miranda and coworkers reviewed the state of resin glycoside synthesis to early 2009 (Pereda-Miranda et al., 2010). Since then, more total synthesis research studies on resin glycosides have been achieved and published. Therefore, to obtain a comprehensive perspective, the present review provides a systematic summary of synthetic strategies for the total synthesis of resin glycosides over the period from 2009 to the end of 2021. Several electronic databases, including the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched using the keyword \u201cresin glycoside\u201d paired with \u201csynthesis\u201d or \u201ctotal synthesis.\u201d A total of 13 resin glycosides, as shown in Figure 1, have been synthesized during this period, including ipomoeassins A\u2013F (1\u20136), batatoside L (7), murucoidins IV (8) and V (9),\nmerremoside D (10), tricolorins A (11) and F (12), and batatin VI (13)."

(2010), here we give amore comprehensive review on the F\u00fcrstner\u2019s work.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the route by F\u00fcrstner\u2019s group relied on the use of compound 19 as a new cinnamic acid surrogate, which was hydrogenation-resistant over Wilkinson\u2019s catalyst and allowed the unsaturated acids to be attached at an early phase of the synthesis. The key disaccharide 16 was assembled by a BF3\u00b7Et2O-mediated glycosidation method and was esterified with tiglic acid at the more nucleophilic O-3 site of \u03b2-glucoside to\nform 17. Then, the reductive opening of the substituted benzylidene acetal using NaBH3CN in combination with TMSCl furnished a mixture of 6-OPMB ether (18) and 4- OPMB ether in up to 84% combined yield with a 4:1 isomeric ratio. Alcohol 18 was esterified with 19 under Yamaguchi conditions, which was then subjected to oxidative PMB cleavage followed by the attachment of the 4-oxo-8-nonenoic acid ester segment. The resulting diene 21 was treated with catalytic amounts of ruthenium alkylidene complex 22 for RCM macrolactonization and then was hydrogenated with the aid of [RhCl(PPh3)3] to afford macrolactone 23. After cleavage of the C-silyl and O-silyl groups and deprotection of isopropylidene acetal, ipomoeassin B (2) was obtained. Ipomoeassin A (1) was converted from ipomoeassin B (2) by treating withMeC(OEt)3 in\nFIGURE 3 Structures of 26\u201331.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org04\nthe presence of camphersulfonic acid, followed by an HOAcinduced rearrangement. The synthesis of ipomoeassins D (4) and E (5) was very similar with ipomoeassins A (1) and B (2), respectively, with the only difference on the use of a synthetic chiral acid 26 (Figure 3) for the esterification of the primary alcohol in 20. The PMB-protected acid 27 (Figure 3) was used to form diene in the synthesis of ipomoeassin C (3), which was cleaved with DDQ to form the hydroxyl group in the C-5 position of the aglycone moiety. Ipomoeassin F (6) differs from ipomoeassin A (1) only by the presence of two additional methylene units in the tail of aglycone, and no synthetic strategy was changed for the ipomoeassin F (6), except for the substitute of heptenol with nonenol to form the building block 28 (Figure 3) instead of 14.\nApart from ipomoeassins A\u2013F (1\u20136), three analogues 29\u201331 (Figure 3) were also synthesized by F\u00fcrstner\u2019s group. By comparing the cytotoxic activity of these compounds, it was observed that the acetylation of the axial 4-OH group of fucopyranose and hydroxylation of the C-5 position in the lipophilic tether are detrimental. In addition, the ketone in the tether, the exact location of the two unsaturated esters, and the lipophilicity/hydrophilicity balance also showed strong influences on the bioactivity. A cell cycle analysis showed that\nthose ipomoeassins could cause G0/G1 arrest in L-929 cells, followed by the apoptotic induction (Nagano et al., 2009)."

            "text": "Two strategies for the construction of ipomoeassin F (6) were described by Shi and colleagues and were both based on the RCM in constructing ring structures, with the difference on the introduction stage of the tiglate moiety (Zong et al., 2015; Zong et al., 2017b).\nIn the first strategy shown in Figure 5, the tiglate was introduced into the glucosyl donor 42 in an early stage, and the fucosyl acceptor 43 was designed with minimal protection steps from the fucosyl donor and chiral alcohol. The regioselective Schmidt glycosylation of 43 and 42, followed by the acetylation of the remaining hydroxyl group, gave disaccharide 44 in 71% yield. The resulting alcohol obtained by the removal of the Alloc group was treated with TBSOTf and 2,6-lutidine to afford the silyl ether 45 as the major product (66%). The removal of the isopropylidene group followed by the esterification of 6-OH-Glcp with 4-oxo-8-nonenoic acid gave diene 47 as the RCM precursor. Treatment of diene 47 with the Hoveyda\u2013Grubbs catalyst and the subsequent hydrogenation over Wilkinson\u2019s catalyst gave 48. After the introduction of the cinnamate moiety and the removal of the TBS groups, ipomoeassin F (6) was finally obtained. In this route,\nipomoeassin F was synthesized in 3.8% overall yield over 17 steps of the longest linear sequence from commercially available starting materials, and thus the synthesis can be easily scaled up to gram-scale (Zong et al., 2015).\nIn the second strategy, Shi\u2019s group tried to install two acyl groups in the late stage by utilizing the highly regioselective esterification of the glucose diol (Figure 6). The disaccharide diol 52 was obtained by the removal of the isopropylidene group of 51, which was built through regioselective glycosylation of the glucosyl donor 50 and fucoside acceptor 43, followed by acetylation of the remaining 4-OH-Glcp. The chemoselective esterification of 6-OH-Glcp in diol 52 with carboxylic acid 53 gave diene 54 as the RCM precursor. The treatment of diene 54 with the Hoveyda\u2013Grubbs catalyst and the subsequent hydrogenation reaction gave the ring structure 55. The cinnamate moiety was then introduced using Steglich esterification to furnish disaccharide 56. The removal of Lev groups followed by the cleavage of ketal in the presence of CSA gave the key intermediate 57. Steglich or Mukaiyama esterification of 57 with tiglic acid yielded the desired 3-Otigloyl product 58, the TBS group of which was removed to afford ipomoeassin F (6) (Zong et al., 2017b). This route was developed with an overall yield of 4.0% over 17 steps of the\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org06\nlongest linear sequence from commercially available D-glucose penta-acetate and was particularly suitable for the efficient preparation of ipomoeassin F analogues with modifications at 3-OH-Glcp.\nUsing these two strategies, Shi\u2019s group also synthesized a series of ipomoeassin F analogues, including the 11R-epimer (59), acyl group-removed or -modified analogues (30, 60\u201371), chain-modified or open-chain analogues (72\u201383), and monosaccharide analogues (84\u201386) (Zong et al., 2015; Zong et al. 2016; Zong et al. 2017a; Zong et al. 2017b; Zong et al. 2018; Zong et al. 2020, Figure 7). These analogues were evaluated for the cytotoxic activity, followed by the structure\u2013activity relationship study. Based on the evaluation result, two \u03b1, \u03b2unsaturated esters, the natural 11S configuration of aglycone, the size and flexibility of the ring, and the 6-membered ring of the fucoside moiety are critical for the activity, whereas, the cyclic skeleton, ketone in the aglycone, and 3-OH of the Fuc unit showed less influences on the activities of ipomoeassin F (6).\nIn addition, the biotin analogue of ipomoeassin F was synthesized by Shi\u2019s group and was used to identify Sec61\u03b1, the pore-forming subunit of the Sec61protein translocon, as a direct binding partner of ipomoeassin F (6) (Zong et al., 2019). A ring-expanded ipomoeassin F analogue (74, Figure 7) exhibited improved cytotoxicity and in vitro protein translocation inhibition, implying that the binding pocket of Sec61\u03b1 can\naccommodate further structural modifications, likely in the fatty acid portion (Zong et al., 2020). Due to the Sec61 inhibitory potential, ipomoeassin F (6) was developed as a valuable tool to research the protein biogenesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (Leznicki et al., 2022; O\u2019Keefe et al., 2021a; 2021b; Roboti et al., 2021)."

Although the common activation of trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors or thioglycosyl donors were the mostly used glycosylation methods, Wan\u2019s group have developed the interrupted Pummerer reaction-mediated (IPRm) glycosylation and one-pot relay glycosylation methods, which were successfully utilized for the synthesis of murucoidins IV (8) and V (9), merremoside D (10), and tricolorin A (11). A Pdcatalyzed stereoselective glycosylation was used for the synthesis of merremoside D (10).\nIn general, the synthesized resin glycosides and their analogues helped in structural verification, structural modification, and further biological activity exploration, as well as provided enlightenment for the synthesis of glycoside compounds. However, compared with the vigorous structure and bioactivity studies, only a limited number of bioactive resin glycosides have been synthesized. The development of novel methods for the synthesis of resin glycosides and their analogues with better biological outcomes would be of strategic importance for further drug discovery."
