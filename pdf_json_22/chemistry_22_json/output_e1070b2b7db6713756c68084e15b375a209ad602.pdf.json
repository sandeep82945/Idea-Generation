The proposed drug delivery system has significant potential to achieve efficient, stable, and targeted delivery of drugs and cancer therapy.\nKeywords: targeted drug delivery, DNA hydrogel, aptamer, synergistic therapy, doxorubicin\nINTRODUCTION\nChemotherapy [especially doxorubicin (DOX)] has been widely applied in the treatment of various cancers. Nevertheless, its non-specific and inefficient delivery to tumor tissue often leads to serious side effects and reduces the therapeutic effect (Smuder, 2019). Therefore, it is urgent to develop an ideal treatment platform with targeted and efficient drug delivery. In recent years, nanomaterials such as organic nanoparticles and polymer nanomaterials have been built into therapeutic platforms because of their strong antienzymolysis ability, easy surface functionalization, and good stability (Chen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021). However, due to the existence of exogenous components, these nanomaterials still face obvious challenges of cytotoxicity and immune response in the process of long-term use (Chen et al., 2018). At the same time, their complex preparation process also limits their clinical application to a great extent.\nFor the past few years, biocompatible deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nanostructures, such as DNA polyhedron, DNA origami, and DNA nanotubes, have been widely applied in biosensors, imaging, and therapy, which serve as carriers of small interference RNA (siRNA), chemotherapeutic drugs, and immunostimulatory cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) (Jiang et al., 2019a; Jiang et al., 2019b). However, there are still some inherent defects in DNA nanostructures. DNA nanostructures are easy to degrade by endogenous nuclease in vivo (Keller and Linko, 2020). It is still highly desired to improve DNA biological stability. To date, DNA hydrogels have shown great potential in cancer theranostic applications, which integrates the biocompatibility, degradability, molecular\nEdited by: Veli Cengiz Ozalp, At\u0131l\u0131m University, Turkey\nReviewed by: Murat Kavruk,\nAtilim University, Turkey Bilge G\u00fcven\u00e7 Tuna, Yeditepe University, Turkey\n*Correspondence: Tingmei Chen\ntingmeichen@cqmu.edu.cn\n\u2020These authors have contributed equally to this work\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nPharmacology of Anti-Cancer Drugs, a section of the journal\nFrontiers in Pharmacology\nReceived: 11 November 2021 Accepted: 03 January 2022\nPublished: 23 February 2022\nCitation: Jin F, Zeng Q, Qian H, Zhang D, Wei Y, Wang Y, Chai C, Cheng W, Ding S and\nChen T (2022) Dual-Targeted SelfAssembled DNA Hydrogels Decorated\nWith Multivalent Aptamers Loaded With DOX for Anticancer Therapy.\nFront.

In particular, the serum stability of DNA hydrogel is much better than that of other DNA nanostructures (Chandrasekaran et al., 2020). Moreover, DNA hydrogel can be constructed via simple rolling circle amplification (RCA), an isothermal enzymatic process driven by DNA polymerase (Huang et al., 2017). The circular DNA template and short DNA primers are catalyzed by DNA ligase to synthesize long single-stranded DNA molecules with the most repetitive sequence motifs that can guide the programmable selfassembly of DNA hydrogel fabrication. Therefore, DNA hydrogel is considered as ideal drug delivery material because of its excellent biocompatibility and high biological stability.\nThe uptake of DNA nanoparticles by cells usually relies on passive delivery including enhanced penetration and retention effect (EPR) (Shi et al., 2020). This model may not be suitable for certain cancers that require specific targeting, such as breast cancer and lymphoma. Alternatively, molecular recognition ligands that could specifically bind to the receptor overexpressed on the surface of the target cell can accurately deliver the drug to the target cell, such as aptamers screened by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (Wang et al., 2019). Besides, aptamers have many remarkable characteristics, including receptor-mediated internalization and easy integration into DNA nanostructures by the Watson\u2013Crick concept of complementary base pairing. In particular, aptamers can be used as agonists and antagonists similar to antibodies (Nimjee et al., 2017). It has been reported that the binding of some aptamers to the target protein can induce the degradation of the target protein (Ma et al., 2019), thus improving treatment efficiency. So far, some DNA nanomaterials have been able to recognize target cells through the binding of bivalent or tervalent aptamers (Yu et al., 2018), and these DNA nanostructures have shown elevated targeting effects for target cells. However, there are still few reports on dual-targeted drug delivery mediated by multivalent aptamers.\nHerein, we proposed a dual-targeted aptamer-decorated DNA hydrogel system (DTA-H) to achieve efficient, stable, and targeted delivery of drugs. The HER2 aptamer and AS1411 aptamer were easily incorporated into the DTA-H by DNA complementary base pairing. Moreover, the targeted delivery of DOX was achieved by inserting DNA base pairs as well as the G-rich quadruplex structure of AS1411, which significantly reduced the severe side effects of DOX in cancer chemotherapy (Ouyang et al., 2020). The DTA-H may hold great promise for applications in drug delivery and cancer therapy."

Here, we designed two sequences (the red part of Supplementary Table S1)\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8074983\nin the template strand to form the long single-stranded RCA product with repetitive sequence motifs which can complement the L-HER2 aptamer and L-AS1411 aptamer (the green part of Supplementary Table S1) respectively. As shown in Scheme 1A, after DNA hydrogel annealing, L-HER2 and L-AS1411 aptamer can be decorated on DNA hydrogel to form dual-targeted DNA hydrogels decorated by multivalent aptamers (DTA-H). HER2 aptamers could specifically recognize HER2 protein on the cell membrane surface, such as SK-BR-3 cell (human HER2-positive breast cancer cell line). It is reported that HER2 breast cancer accounts for about 20%\u201325% of breast cancer, and the expression level of HER2 protein is 100 times higher than that of normal cells (Cooke et al., 2001). Besides, AS1411 aptamer could specifically bind to nucleolin (a protein overexpressed in many tumor types) (Trinh et al., 2015). In particular, AS1411 aptamer can load\nenough DOX by its G-rich G quadruplex structure (Taghdisi et al., 2018).\nThe above aptamer-decorated DNA hydrogels were used as the drug carriers to load DOX. In Scheme 1B, DOX-loaded DNA hydrogels (DTA-H/DOX) can specifically recognize SK-BR-3 cells and internalize into the cytoplasm, then DOX is gradually released into the cytoplasm in the lysosome and spreads to the nucleus to play an anticancer role.\nCharacterization of DTA-H and Assembly Optimization The assembly feasibility of DTA-H was verified by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1A, compared with the single-strand L-HER2, the DNA hydrogel (RCA product) had almost no migration, which is consistent with other reports (Jiang et al., 2019a; Ye et al., 2020). Then, we\nSCHEME 1 | Illustration of DTA-H self-assembly and targeted cancer therapy. (A) RCA reaction formed DNA hydrogel, then multivalent aptamer and DOX were loaded into DNA hydrogel.

As shown in Supplementary Figure S1B, when the volume ratio of L-HER2:P-RCA= 3:5, L-HER2was successfully assembled into DNA hydrogel. Then, Figure 1A showed the optimization of the volume ratio of two L-type aptamers and RCA products. It can be seen that with the increase of two L-type aptamers, the aptamer band gradually appeared on the gel. When the volume ratio of L-HER2:L-AS1411:P-RCA was less than or equal to 3:3:5, no obvious aptamer bandwas shown, suggesting that aptamers were completely connected to the DNA hydrogel. However, when the ratio of L-HER2:L-AS1411:P-RCA was more than 3:3:5, the aptamer band appeared, indicating an excess of aptamers did not bind to DNA hydrogel. We proved once again that the L-type aptamer can be wholly decorated on the DNA hydrogel when the ratio of L-HER2:L-AS1411:P-RCA is equal to 3:3:5 in Supplementary Figure S1C. Therefore, the ratio of L-HER2:L-AS1411:P-RCA less than or equal to 3:3:5 is the appropriate proportion of aptamer-decorated DNA hydrogel.\nTo better verify the formation of hydrogel, the morphology of hydrogel was observed by the naked eye. Supplementary Figure S2 showed that the DNA hydrogel formed after the reaction, making the solution turbid compared to the solution before the reaction. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied to observe the external and internal structures of P-RCA and DTA-H hydrogel (Supplementary Figure S3 and Figure 1). Figure 1C showed the spherical structure of the dried hydrogel sample (external structure), while the internal structure of the sphere was DNA nanoflowers (Figure 1D). These structures indicate the successful synthesis of DNA nanohydrogels."

Therefore, HER2 aptamer and AS1411 aptamer were selected as the dual targeting part to improve targeting efficiency, and SK-BR-3 cells were selected as target cells.\nThe intracellular behaviors of DTA-H/DOX were observed by CLSM imaging, where MCF-10A (normal breast cells) were set as control cells. The optimal incubation time had been observed for 4 h (Supplementary Figure S5). Meanwhile, the dual targeting of DTA-H to target cells SK-BR-3 was proved. Supplementary Figure S6 showed the co-localization of L-HER2 and L-AS1411 in SK-BR-3 cells (both HER2 and nucleolin positive) and MDA-MB-231 cells (only nucleolin positive) in the DTA-H group, while the fluorescence was stronger in SK-BR3 cells than in MDA-MB-231 cells, which was suspected to be due to the existence of dual targeting in SK-BR-3 cells. Also, from\nFigure 2A, strong fluorescence of L-HER2 and L-AS1411 decorated on DTA-H on the cell membrane was monitored and was co-located in SK-BR-3 cells rather than in MCF-10A cells. Meanwhile, the red fluorescence of DOX is restored after being released from the internalized DTA-H in the intracellular environment. DOX was initially co-localized with DTA-H and finally unloaded and distributed in other intracellular areas in SKBR-3 cells. These results suggested that the DTA-H/DOX was first bound to the membrane proteins (HER2 or nucleolin), internalized into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and then mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. It has been reported that the unloading of DOX from internalized DNA nanocarriers was through simple diffusion and affected by intracellular factors such as pH, ionic environment, and nuclease degradation (Zhu et al., 2013).

Also, it was verified in normal breast cells in Supplementary Figure S7B. Then, the non-targeted inhibitory effect of DOX in SK-BR-3 cells was detected, as shown in Supplementary Figure S8; the impact of DOX on cell proliferation was time- and dose-dependent, indicating that DOX therapy is non-targeted and has strong side effects. In control, Figure 2B shows that the viability of SK-BR-3 cells treated with DTA-H/DOX considerably decreased in a time-dependent manner, but no obvious cellular cytotoxicity is detected in MCF10A cells within 12 h (Supplementary Figure S9).\nIn addition, DTA-H was found to inhibit the proliferation of SK-BR-3 cells within 48 h (Figure 2B). Because the cell safety of P-RCA alone has been proved in Supplementary Figure S7, we believe that P-RCA alone has no effect on cell proliferation when the treatment time is not more than 48 h. It has been reported that HER2 aptamers can bind to the HER2 on the cell membrane and internalize into cells, induce the degradation of HER2 protein in lysosomes, and indirectly inhibit cell proliferation (Ma et al., 2019), and it is well known that HER2 protein is strongly expressed on the membrane of SKBR-3 cells; thus, we speculate that decoration of HER2 aptamers may play a role in inhibiting cell proliferation."

Firstly, the expression of HER2 protein in SK-BR-3 cells was detected by Western blotting; HER2 protein was strongly expressed in SKBR-3 cells in Supplementary Figure S10. We know that nucleic acid aptamers are easy to degrade, so taking advantage of the high serum stability of DNA hydrogel mentioned above, HER2 aptamers were decorated on DNA hydrogels to enhance their stability and form multivalent HER2 aptamer decorated hydrogels (P-RCA-L-HER2).\nWe compared the effects of single-stranded HER2 aptamers (L-HER2) and P-RCA-L-HER2 on HER2 protein, cell proliferation, and apoptosis by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. In Figures 3A,B, the expression of the HER2 protein with P-RCA-L-HER2 incubation for 48 h was more significantly inhibited than L-HER2, suggesting that P-RCA-L-HER2 had a stronger binding ability to target cells, thus inducing the significant degradation of HER2 protein. Meanwhile, there was no significant change in the DNA hydrogel incubated group (P-RCA).\nIt has been reported that the overexpression of HER2 can promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis by activating\nPI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways (Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001). Therefore, the expression of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways and apoptosis-related proteins has been detected. Figure 3D shows that compared with the control, the phosphorylation level of AKT and ERK in the downstream pathway of HER2 decreased after incubation with P-RCA-LHER2, indicating that the downstream pathway of HER2 was also inhibited. Figure 3E shows that the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was inhibited, while the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax was promoted, indicating that the treatment of multivalent P-RCA-L-HER2 induced apoptosis to some extent. Furthermore, Supplementary Figure S11 shows that dual aptamer-decorated DNA hydrogel (DTA-H) induced more degradation of HER2 protein, indicating that dual aptamerdecorated DNA hydrogel enhanced targeting ability for SKBR-3 cells. Simultaneously, consistent with the above results, the downstream pathway of HER2 was also inhibited in the DTAH hydrogel treatment group in Supplementary Figure S11. Surprisingly, we found that Bax significantly increased, and the Bcl-2 and the proliferation-related protein C-myc decreased, indicating that DTA-H could induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation.

The dual targeting of DTA-H was accomplished by two aptamers (HER2 aptamer and AS1411 aptamer) targeting the HER2 and nucleolin protein, which increases the specificity of drug delivery. (2) The multivalence decoration of aptamer. The polyvalent aptamer is decorated on the DNA hydrogel formed by the RCA reaction by simple base complementation pairing. Its advantages are as follows: Firstly, the multivalent aptamer increases the binding affinity between the system and target cells, thus improving the efficiency of drug delivery; secondly, compared with other strategies that amplify aptamers by RCA reactions, our design better preserves the functional secondary structure of aptamers by suspending aptamers on the DNA\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8074989\nhydrogel with an additional sequence.
