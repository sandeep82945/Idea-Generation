    "abstractText": "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, well-being, and behavior is likely influenced by individual characteristics that determine one\u2019s capacity for resilience. In this exploratory study, we examined whether individual differences in working memory (WM) capacity and habit propensity (HP), measured before the outbreak, could predict variation in subsequent psychological coping efficacy (as operationalized by measures of depression, mental well-being, perceived stress, and loneliness) and behavioral adjustment (by evaluating compliance and self-reported automaticity of four COVID19 guidelines) among Dutch older adults (n = 36) during the pandemic (measured April 25 to May 6, 2020). While we found elevated levels of depression and emotional loneliness, overall mental well-being, and perceived stress were not affected by the pandemic. Contrary to our expectations, we found no robust evidence for a protective role of WM in predicting these outcomes, although our findings hint at a positive relationship with perceived change in mental well-being. Interestingly, WM and HP were found to affect the self-reported automaticity levels of adherence to behavioral COVID-19 guidelines (i.e., washing hands, physical distancing), where a strong HP appeared beneficial when deliberate resources were less available (e.g., low WM capacity). These novel and preliminary findings offer new potential avenues for investigating individual differences in resilience in times of major life events or challenges.",

            "text": "Soon after the World Health Organization declared COVID19 a pandemic, it became clear that older adults were especially susceptible and at higher risk for developing serious complications from infection (e.g., Wang et\u00a0al., 2020a).\nAccordingly, governments across the world adopted strict measures to contain the outbreak and protect their elders. This led to severe disruptions of daily routines and lifestyle behaviors (de Haas et\u00a0al., 2020; Rodr\u00edguez-Rey et\u00a0al., 2020), and for some people to moderate to severe psychological consequences (e.g., increased levels of depression, loneliness, and stress Krendl & Perry, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez-Rey et\u00a0al., 2020; van Tilburg et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020b). The early impact of the pandemic on mental health, well-being, and behavior in older adults was likely influenced by individual characteristics that determine someone\u2019s capacity for resilience (Polizzi et\u00a0al., 2020; Uddin, 2021). The present study, conducted during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, was set out to explore the (potentially) protective role of cognitive capacities (in particular, working memory and habit propensity) in psychological coping and behavioral adjustment among older adults.\nResilience is commonly conceptualized as the process of adapting well in the face of difficult or challenging life\n* Lotte P. Brinkhof l.p.brinkhof@uva.nl\n1 Department of\u00a0Psychology, Faculty of\u00a0Behavioural and\u00a0Social Sciences, University of\u00a0Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The\u00a0Netherlands\n2 Centre for\u00a0Urban Mental Health, University of\u00a0Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The\u00a0Netherlands\n3 Faculty of\u00a0Science, Swammerdam Institute for\u00a0Life Sciences, University of\u00a0Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The\u00a0Netherlands\n4 Amsterdam Brain & Cognition (ABC), University of\u00a0Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The\u00a0Netherlands\n1 3\nexperiences, especially through mental, emotional, and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands (American Psychological Association, 2020b). It can be seen as a protective characteristic that helps individuals to regain or maintain normal levels of functioning and mental well-being after setbacks (Hayman et\u00a0al., 2017; Hildon et\u00a0al., 2010), and can, therefore, strongly impact successful aging (e.g., MacLeod et\u00a0al., 2016). Indeed, old age is marked by several challenges that require adequate regulation (e.g., physical/cognitive decline), but especially in response to major life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, (flexible and) prompt adaptation may be essential to prevent maladaptive developmental changes (Kamo et\u00a0al., 2011; Shenk et\u00a0al., 2009). Here, we distinguish between psychological coping and behavioral adjustment as vital elements of resilience. Psychological coping involves the use of cognitive strategies to modulate internal and external demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding personal resources (Endler & Parker, 1990; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Behavioral adjustment refers to the actual changes in behavior that individuals make in accordance with environmental demands (American Psychological Association, 2020a; Kitayama et\u00a0al., 2018).\nIn the present study, we considered the protective role of two aspects of cognitive functioning in resilience: working memory (WM) and habit propensity (HP; only in relation to behavioral adjustment outcomes; see Fig.\u00a01). Working memory (WM) refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of a limited amount of information (Baddeley, 1992; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974) and has been suggested to facilitate resilience by \u2018enabling individuals to organize and assimilate information associated with adverse circumstances, to plan and make appropriate decisions to guide behavior, and to regulate emotions, thereby enabling the adaptation to and coping with adversity\u2019 (Bemath et\u00a0al., 2020, p. 4). Indeed,\nWM capacity has been shown to be positively correlated with coping (Andreotti et\u00a0al., 2013; Schmeichel & Demaree, 2010; Schmeichel et\u00a0al., 2008; Stawski et\u00a0al., 2010). In turn, adaptive coping strategies have been related to better outcome measures of resilience during COVID-19, including better well-being and reduced mental problems (Dawson & Golijani-Moghaddam, 2020; Passavanti et\u00a0al., 2021; Pearman et\u00a0al., 2020). This suggests that people higher in WM capacity may have better resources for coping and maintaining mental health in the face of difficult or challenging life experiences, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The first aim of our study was to examine whether WM capacity, as assessed prior to the pandemic, could indeed protect individuals from maladaptive changes in mental well-being, depression, loneliness, and stress among older adults during the pandemic (see Fig.\u00a01). In other words, we operationalize the efficacy of coping in terms of measures of well-being and mental health.\nBesides its potential role in psychological coping, WM may also facilitate flexible adjustment to behavioral challenges, as was required to adequately and promptly incorporate mandated COVID guidelines into one's daily life. WM capacity is essential for the organization of goal-directed behaviors, as it maintains and manipulates task-relevant information and thereby facilitates conscious and deliberate action selection (Hofmann et\u00a0al., 2008). In line with this idea, previous research during the initial stage of the pandemic showed that individuals high in WM capacity adopted social-distancing rules better as compared to those low in capacity (Xie et\u00a0al., 2020), and high levels of self-control (i.e., which largely depends on WM) have been associated with better adherence to social-distancing guidelines (Bieleke et\u00a0al., 2021; Wolff et\u00a0al., 2020). Furthermore, subjective cognitive functioning was associated with increased\n1 3\nadherence to several prevention behaviors (e.g., avoid touching surfaces in public; Thoma et\u00a0al., 2021).\nHowever, both WM capacity and goal-directed control have been shown to decline with increasing age (Eppinger et\u00a0al., 2013; Kirova et\u00a0al., 2015), compromising immediate, flexible behavioral adjustment. This is in line with the age-related deterioration of the prefrontal cortex (PFC; Grieve et\u00a0al., 2007), with particularly the dorsolateral and ventromedial PFC being implicated in WM and goaldirected control, respectively (Watson et\u00a0al., 2018). Consequently, in line with dual-process accounts of action control, behavioral change in older adults may be relatively dependent on the gradual automatization of efficient routines (Verplanken, 2006; Wood & R\u00fcnger, 2016). Experimental research with the outcome-revaluation paradigm has provided evidence for a disrupted balance between habitual and goal-directed processes in healthy aging. Specifically, older adults showed a higher vulnerability to \u2018slips-of-action\u2019 towards no longer valuable outcomes, suggesting a relatively stronger involvement of habitual processes (as opposed to goal directed; de Wit et\u00a0al., 2014; Watson & de Wit, 2018). This disposition towards habitual (action) control is referred to as habit propensity (HP). Indeed, a strong HP may be due to relatively weak goaldirected control in aging, but could also (at least partially) arise as a consequence of stronger habit formation. Here, we argue that a strong habit propensity may facilitate the automatizing of novel guideline behaviors by predisposing\nindividuals to habitual responding (Lally & Gardner, 2013; Linnebank et\u00a0al., 2018), especially when other cognitive resources that enable flexible adjustment are less available (e.g., low WM capacity, or increased WM load/stress; e.g., Otto et\u00a0al., 2013; Watson et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, the second aim of our study was to examine whether individual differences in both WM capacity and HP could affect compliance and automatization of COVID-19 guideline behaviors (Fig.\u00a01), as indicators of adequate behavioral adjustment.\nAs part of another as of yet unpublished study, we assessed WM and HP in a small (Dutch) sample of older adults prior to the onset of the pandemic. Subsequently, at the start of the pandemic, we recognized a unique opportunity to relate baseline cognitive functioning (that was unaffected by the pandemic) to subsequent resilience, as reflected in both psychological coping and behavioral adjustment. To this end, we obtained self-report measures from (a smaller group) of the same individuals, pertaining to mental health, well-being, and COVID-guideline compliance behavior during the initial lockdown period of the pandemic (Fig.\u00a02). We hypothesized that WM capacity would be a protective factor, as reflected in a positive relationship with change in mental well-being and negative relationship with change in depression, loneliness, and stress. The role of WM and HP in predicting compliance and self-reported automaticity of four main COVID-19 guidelines was assessed in an exploratory fashion.\nFig. 2 Timing and overview of the current study.

Due to a minimal number of responses from younger individuals, this age group was not considered. All participants were free from severe cognitive decline, as indicated by scores higher than 17 on the Cognitive Screening Test 20 (Deelman et\u00a0al., 1989; van Toutert et\u00a0al., 2016), reported no diagnosed neurological or psychiatric disorders, and scored above average on intelligence scores at T0. Participants\u2019 average crystallized intelligence (or IQ) was 118.56, SD = 7.88 (with raw scores: M = 92.8, SD = 6.66; see: Dutch Reading Test for Adults; Schmand et\u00a0al., 1991). The average Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III Matrix Reasoning (MR) score was 15.7, SD = 3.42, and 11.3, SD = 1.85, for the raw and norm scores, respectively (Peck, 1970; Wechsler, 2008). One participant reported to have been tested positive for COVID-19 at T1, but only with minimal symptoms. The study was approved by the local Ethics Review Board of The Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences of the University of Amsterdam, and complied with relevant laws and institutional guidelines (2020-CP-12248)."

Participants were subsequently presented with a sequence of discriminative stimuli and had to respond rapidly to stimuli that predicted still-valuable and upvalued outcomes, while refraining from responding to stimuli that signaled still-notvaluable and devalued outcomes. A HP score was operationalized as the mean of the accuracy differences between incongruent trials during which behavior had to be flexibly adjusted and congruent trials (still-valuable\u2014upvalued; still non-valuable\u2014devalued)."

The WEMWBS and PSS items were scored on Likert scales (1: never, 5: always; 0: never; 4: very often), and summed to a total. Response options for the items of the LS were \u2018yes,\u2019 \u2018more or less,\u2019 or \u2018no,\u2019 with one point being assigned to each answer pointing in the loneliness direction (including \u2018more or less\u2019).

The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 reliability coefficient of the WEMWBS and PSS were 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. For the LS, the Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of the emotional subscale was remarkably low (0.34; as opposed to 0.77 for the social subscale), which negatively impacted the internal consistency of the overall scale (0.45). This could be explained by the fact that agreement with one of the emotional loneliness items (i.e., \u2018I miss having people around me') was exceedingly higher than for the other items. Since this pattern of responding was, however, completely in agreement with the anticipated impact of the pandemic (see also: Huber & Seifert, 2022; Landmann & Rohmann, 2021; van Tilburg et\u00a0al., 2020) and may, therefore, provide highly valuable information, we retained the item and relied on the reliability coefficients from previous studies using the loneliness scale, ranging from 0.80 to 0.90 (de Jong-Gierveld & van Tilburg, 1999). For all constructs, higher scores indicated better mental well-being and more loneliness and perceived stress.\nParticipants were also asked to rate the thoughts and feelings as described in the WEMWBS (\u03b1: 0.77), LS (not computed, see previous paragraph), and PSS (\u03b1: 0.79) over the past two weeks as compared to their normal experience. Each thought or feeling was scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from \u2018a lot less than normal\u2019 (1) to \u2018a lot more than normal\u2019 (5) with \u2018similar to normal\u2019 (3) in the middle, and summed to a total of 14\u201370, 3\u201330, and 14\u201350 points for the different constructs, respectively."

Next, a bivariate regression model was adopted to determine whether O-SPAN scores could predict changes (T1\u2013T0) in depressive symptomatology. As difference scores can sometimes be unreliable, we also adopted a multiple regression, with GDS-15 T1 scores being predicted by O-SPAN scores, while correcting for GDS-15 T0 scores. Given the lack of a pre-COVID evaluation, the impact of the pandemic on mental well-being, loneliness, and perceived stress was assessed by comparing sum scores of the WEMWBS, LS, and PSS to their corresponding population norms as assessed prior to the pandemic (51.61, 1.89, 12; Stewart-Brown & Taggart, 2015; de Jong-Gierveld & van Tilburg, 2010; Nordin & Nordin, 2013; also see Fig.\u00a02). Furthermore, self-perceived change in mental well-being, loneliness, and perceived stress were compared to the sum scores reflecting no (average) change in those constructs (conceptual average; 42, 18\u20139 for subdimensions\u2014and 30, respectively). Three separate bivariate regression models determined to what extent O-SPAN scores were predictive of the selfperceived change in those three constructs.\nBehavioral Adjustment To ascertain compliance and automaticity of the four guideline behaviors and the extent to which these were predicted by individual differences in O-SPAN and HP scores, several (2 \u00d7 4) regression models were adopted with frequency or SRBAI scores included as outcome variable. Models aimed at predicting frequency included SRBAI scores as predictor, and vice versa. Other predictors included in these models were the actual number of times/days someone went outside or to the supermarket, total scores on the PSS and COVID-19-related stressors list and NEO-FFI conscientiousness scores. Conscientiousness was thought to facilitate the formation of new COVIDguideline routines (Conner et\u00a0al., 2007). Inclusion of the stress variables was based on previous studies showing that stress may influence the balance between goal-directed and habitual control (Schwabe & Wolf, 2010, 2011)."

In case an interaction effect was observed, a type III sum of squares (SS) approach was used. Otherwise, we continued with the analysis for main effects, using a type II SS approach (Langsrud, 2003). To make a decision on appropriate p value corrections for violations of sphericity we used a Greenhouse\u2013Geisser estimate of sphericity (\u03be). When \u03be < 0.75, the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser was selected as the appropriate correction; when \u03be > 0.75 Huynh\u2013Feldt was used. Partial eta squared (\u03b7p2) was used as measure of effect size.\nNon-parametric relative (guideline) frequency data was tested by means of the non-parametric ANOVA-Type Statistic (ATS; R Software Package: nparLD; Noguchi et\u00a0al., 2012). This ATS allowed us to measure the relative treatment effects (RTEs) based on the mean ranks (i.e., the probability an observation randomly chosen from the whole dataset is smaller than a randomly chosen observation from that specific group and/or timepoint), with the denominator degrees of freedom set to infinity. When appropriate, pairwise comparisons of main effects were performed using the mctp.rm (dependent sample) functions from the \u2018nparcomp\u2019 R Software Package (Konietschke et\u00a0al., 2015), providing robust rank-based, Tukey-type non-parametric contrasts. These contrasts were performed by considering differences between each pair in terms of their RTE, providing a measure of effect size.\nIn the regression models, many variables could theoretically explain the dependent variable. Because of that, a stepwise model selection based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) was performed by using the stepAIC() function (R Software Package \u2018MASS'; Venables & Ripley, 2002), to ensure parsimonious models that only included the predictors that were necessary to explain the data. Predictors were iteratively added and removed from the predictive model in order to find the subset of variables resulting in the best performing model (i.e., explaining\nvariance of the dependent variable; lowering prediction error). Prior to the stepwise procedure, we checked for (marginally) significant interactions among predictors and used an hierarchical approach to determine whether the observed interaction(s) improved the fit and explained variance of the model in case this term was included in the final model (i.e., delta R2, AIC, and BIC). Again, outliers were removed with cook\u2019s distance 4/n criterion."

            "text": "The present study examined the impact of individual differences in WM capacity and HP on resilience among older adults during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We distinguished between psychological coping and behavioral adjustment as vital elements of resilience. The idea that WM capacity plays an important role in psychological coping and, therefore, prevents maladaptive changes did not receive strong support. While the pandemic did lead to an increase in depressive symptomatology and loneliness, we found that individual differences in WM did not robustly predict changes in depression, loneliness, nor stress in our sample. There was a trend for a positive relation with mental well-being, but this failed to meet our stringent criteria. On the other hand, this study provides unique exploratory insights into the role of WM and HP in behavioral adjustment, as HP was positively related with self-reported automaticity of physical distancing in the supermarket, as well as automaticity of hand washing among those low in WM capacity.\nForemost, this study confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on mental health, as reflected in an increase in depressive symptomatology and self-perceived emotional loneliness, in accordance with several other studies conducted during the initial phase of the pandemic (e.g., Luchetti et\u00a0al., 2020; van Tilburg et\u00a0al., 2020). Indeed, the design of our study does not allow us to rule out with certainty that increases in these outcomes were in fact due to natural fluctuations. Yet, it seems unlikely that all participants would show a similar pattern of fluctuations that would lead to such main effects. Importantly, since our T0 measurements were taken at completely different times throughout the pre-COVID year, any seasonal effects are highly improbable. Therefore, we argue that the pandemic is indeed the most plausible explanation for the observed increases in depression and loneliness. In contrast, we found that selfperceived mental well-being remained roughly the same (see also: van Tilburg et\u00a0al., 2020), as did perceived stress. These findings may be explained by the fact that some thoughts and feelings as described in these constructs seemed to be positively affected (e.g., more interested in others), whereas others were negatively affected by the pandemic (e.g., less experienced feelings of optimism; less grip on things; see Supplement A), thereby balancing each other out. It remains to be established whether this pattern would remain stable for a longer period of time.\nAlthough we did not find robust evidence for a role of WM in predicting resilience to the impact of the pandemic\non mental health and well-being, one marginal finding is worth mentioning. Specifically, we found a trend for a positive relationship between WM capacity and change in self-perceived mental well-being. While we decreased the evidentiary standard to minimize the likelihood of false positives, this has increased the chance of missing a genuine effect (Drachman, 2012), especially given the limited number of participants we could include in our study (CurranEverett, 2017). Additionally, it may be that our measure of WM does not tap onto the crucial components that impact psychological coping (see e.g., Fellman et\u00a0al., 2020). Both leave open the possibility that WM capacity may indeed protect against the pandemic\u2019s effects on psychological health (see e.g., Brush, 2021; Sin et\u00a0al., 2021). This could be mediated by the role of WM capacity in coping (e.g., Stawski et\u00a0al., 2010), with (mal)adaptive coping strategies predicting mental health and well-being outcomes during COVID-19 (e.g., Pearman et\u00a0al., 2020). Alternatively, WM may promote resilience via other higher-order abilities (e.g., attentional processing) that could influence the capacity to withstand difficult life events (Derakhshan, 2020; Johnson et\u00a0al., 2013). Clearly, these speculations warrant future investigations, in which the relationships between those factors could be estimated using more causal or associative analysis techniques in a larger sample (e.g., network analysis; Brinkhof et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThe most compelling factor in explaining variation in behavioral adjustment appeared to be HP. While an overreliance on habits is often linked to clinical conditions (Robbins et\u00a0al., 2012; Watson & de Wit, 2018), our data suggests that, at a non-clinical level, a disposition towards habit learning may be beneficial. HP was positively related to self-reported automaticity for the maintenance of physical distance in the supermarket and hand washing, albeit the latter only among individuals with relatively low WM capacity. This indicates that a stronger reliance on habitual control can facilitate the gradual automatization of new routines (Lally & Gardner, 2013). In addition, it also indicates that such a disposition may be especially beneficial when more deliberate resources to direct action in accordance with new goals (i.e., reducing transmission, not becoming infected; e.g., Xie et\u00a0al., 2020) are less available, and the dependence on habitual behavior is enhanced. This applies to those having a relatively low WM capacity in general, as well as to a specific situation in which someone\u2019s WM capacity is taxed with other tasks or strains (e.g., searching for products in the supermarket; maneuvering between other people; Foerde et\u00a0al., 2006; Otto et\u00a0al., 2013; Quaedflieg et\u00a0al., 2019; Watson et\u00a0al., 2021). In other words, a strong HP may offer an alternative route to automatization and compliance to new behaviors when goaldirected resources cannot be deployed optimally. This is in line with the notion that relying on beneficial habits may be a promising pathway to reduce the need for effortful top-down\n1 3\ncontrol functions (Galla & Duckworth, 2015). Moreover, it concurs with recent findings showing that engagement in behavior regulation strategies that are thought to promote the formation of desirable habits (i.e., if\u2013then planning) is associated with more successful and effortless social-distancing adherence, particularly in the long run (Bieleke et\u00a0al., 2021). Critically, this previous study showed that a strong inclination to engage in such planning facilitated social distancing, especially for those who perceived adherence as difficult. In our study, self-reported automaticity of maintaining physical distance outside may not have been affected by HP (nor WM), because it is relatively easy to comply to this guideline. Altogether, our results emphasize that in response to changes in circumstances and challenging environmental demands, older adults may benefit from a stronger propensity to rely on habits or from interventions that facilitate habit formation. Recent insights suggest this also has positive effects for the long term, with Gillebaart et\u00a0al. (2022) showing that a strong hand washing habit buffered against a decrease in hand washing compliance over time.\nWe also show that compliance to (and possibly also the automatization of) the guideline to refrain from touching one\u2019s face was lower as compared to the other guidelines. This is in line with the idea that forming new desirable habits is substantially different from breaking unwanted habits and that attaining control over habitual responses can be extremely difficult (Bargh, 1994). Furthermore, the average self-reported automaticity score of refraining could not be predicted by the relative frequency, HP, WM capacity or any other variable. Potentially, when a new desired behavior has to compete with an old habit, a strong HP may actually enhance the expression of the old habit and thereby impedes the formation of a new routine (Quinn et\u00a0al., 2010). In other words, the contribution of HP to the automatization of new behaviors may depend on the presence and strength of an existing, conflicting habit. Future studies are needed to identify the specific situations and circumstances in which HP may or may not be beneficial when forming new routines.\nIn line with the idea that being more organized, careful, dependable, self-disciplined, and achievement oriented can reduce the intention\u2013behavior gap (Conner et\u00a0al., 2007), conscientiousness seemed to have a positive effect on guideline adherence, yet only for hand washing and not robustly so. Similarly, no robust influences of perceived stress or COVID-19 related stress were observed. Interestingly, however, perceived stress seemed to have a positive effect on adherence (hand washing), whereas COVID-19 related stress had a negative effect (distance outside). This suggests that moderate levels of stress may be beneficial, for instance by making people more aware of the importance of hand washing. The negative effect of COVID-19 related stress is in line with the idea that stress can improve reliance on existing habits, thereby impeding the automatization of\nnew, conflicting behaviors (e.g., Schwabe & Wolf, 2010). However, it should be noted that this relationship may also be found because those with more COVID-19 related stress considered their own adherence to be less sufficient and adequate as compared to individuals that were not experiencing too much stress.\nThe present study pioneers research into the combined role of WM and HP in behavioral adjustment and influence of WM on psychological coping among older adults during a subsequent shared major life event. Despite the smallscale, exploratory character of this study, our findings and individually focused research approach provide a unique window for future research on resilience and the role of individual differences in response to major (historical) life events specifically. A recommendation for follow-up studies is to include more heterogeneous samples that allow for the generalization of current findings. The sample in the present study was above average in intelligence, which may have impacted the results (in particular regarding our cognitive factors, e.g., Conway et\u00a0al., 2002). Furthermore, most participants were from (municipalities near) Amsterdam, and there may be substantial differences in psychological coping and behavioral adjustment during the pandemic with individuals living in rural areas (e.g., due to higher presence of green space; physical distancing being more challenging in densely populated areas). Another opportune direction for future research would be to explore the role of several risk factors in both elements of resilience.\nFinally, individuals having undergone a moderate amount of life adversity have been shown to be less vulnerable to the deleterious effects of future stressors than individuals with limited or massive life-time exposure, a phenomenon called \u2018stress inoculation\u2019 (Seery et\u00a0al., 2013; Serino et\u00a0al., 2014). Similarly, life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may expand individuals\u2019 repertoire of skills and competencies that enable better (flexible) behavioral adjustment in future circumstances. In this way, the COVID-19 pandemic may also bolster against age-related cognitive impairments, thereby reducing overall cognitive aging (Kalisch et\u00a0al., 2017). Future interventional studies could test whether emotional resilience inoculation, as well as acquired behavioral adjustment skills, may indeed decelerate cognitive aging, and to what extent HP and WM can modulate these effects.\nAltogether, this study offered a unique opportunity to examine (potential) protective factors that could determine one\u2019s ability to successfully adapt to challenging and/or difficult life experiences. Specifically, our design enabled us to include baseline levels of WM and HP, thereby excluding the possibility that these cognitive capacities would be affected by the consequences of the pandemic itself (e.g., stress; Klein & Boals, 2001). In this way, we have provided preliminary evidence that WM may be an important resilience factor, explaining variation in behavioral adjustment and possibly\n1 3\nalso in psychological coping. Especially when more deliberate resources are less available and no conflicting habit is present, a high propensity to rely on habitual control also seems to contribute to behavioral adaptability. While future work is needed to test the robustness of our findings, the present study offers novel insights into the cognitive components that may facilitate resilience and offers new potential avenues to investigate individual differences in resilience in times of shared major life events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as other (age-related) challenges (e.g., loss of a spouse, physical decline). Moreover, our results highlight the potential of lifestyle interventions and strategic planning techniques (i.e., implementation intentions) that capitalize on habits to improve prompt and adequate behavioral adjustment in favor of resilience among older adults.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10804- 022- 09404-9.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank our participants who took part in this study.\nFunding This research was funded by the Centre for Urban Mental Health, a Research Priority Area at the University of Amsterdam.
