    "abstractText": "Background: The pathogenesis of depression is complex, with the brain\u2019s reward system likely to play an important role. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key region in the brain that integrates reward signals. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can induce depressive-like behaviors and enhance neuroplasticity in NAc, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We previously found that eukaryotic translation initiation factor A1 (eIF5A1) acts as a ribosome-binding protein to regulate protein translation and to promote neuroplasticity. Methods: In the present study, LPS was administered intraperitoneally to rats and the expression and cellular location of eIF5A1 was then investigated by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Subsequently, a neuron-specific lentivirus was used to regulate eIF5A1 expression in vivo and in vitro. Neuroplasticity was then examined by Golgi staining and by measurement of neuronal processes. Finally, proteomic analysis was used to identify proteins regulated by eIF5A1. Results: The results showed that eIF5A1 expression was significantly increased in the NAc neurons of LPS rats. Following the knockdown of eIF5A1 in NAc neurons, the LPS-induced increases in neuronal arbors and spine density were significantly attenuated. Depression-like behaviors were also reduced. Neurite outgrowth of NAc neurons in vitro also increased or decreased in parallel with the increase or decrease in eIF5A1 expression, respectively. The proteomic results showed that eIF5A1 regulates the expression of many neuroplasticity-related proteins in neurons. Conclusions: These results confirm that eIF5A1 is involved in LPS-induced depression-like behavior by increasing neuroplasticity in the NAc. Our study also suggests the brain\u2019s reward system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression.",

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key region in the brain that integrates reward signals. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can induce depressive-like behaviors and enhance neuroplasticity in NAc, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We previously found that eukaryotic translation initiation factor A1 (eIF5A1) acts as a ribosome-binding protein to regulate protein translation and to promote neuroplasticity. Methods: In the present study, LPS was administered intraperitoneally to rats and the expression and cellular location of eIF5A1 was then investigated by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Subsequently, a neuron-specific lentivirus was used to regulate eIF5A1 expression in vivo and in vitro. Neuroplasticity was then examined by Golgi staining and by measurement of neuronal processes. Finally, proteomic analysis was used to identify proteins regulated by eIF5A1. Results: The results showed that eIF5A1 expression was significantly increased in the NAc neurons of LPS rats. Following the knockdown of eIF5A1 in NAc neurons, the LPS-induced increases in neuronal arbors and spine density were significantly attenuated. Depression-like behaviors were also reduced. Neurite outgrowth of NAc neurons in vitro also increased or decreased in parallel with the increase or decrease in eIF5A1 expression, respectively. The proteomic results showed that eIF5A1 regulates the expression of many neuroplasticity-related proteins in neurons. Conclusions: These results confirm that eIF5A1 is involved in LPS-induced depression-like behavior by increasing neuroplasticity in the NAc. Our study also suggests the brain\u2019s reward system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression.\nKeywords: depression\u037e nucleus accumbens\u037e eukaryotic translation initiation factor A1 (eIF5A1)\n1. Introduction\nDepression endangers the physical and mental health of individuals and affects their quality of life. According to WHO statistics, there are currently about 350 million people in the world with depression. This condition is expected to become the number one disease in humans by 2030 [1]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates CD14 and TLR4 signaling pathways to initiate inflammation-related responses [2]. LPS in the brain not only causes a wide range of acute inflammatory responses, but also leads to depressive-like behaviors in experimental animals. As a consequence, LPS has been widely used in depression-related research [3,4].\nThe pathophysiological mechanism of depression is unclear, but it is currently thought to result from the interaction of genetic factors with environmental factors. Multiple brain regions may be involved in depressive symptoms. For example, the neocortex and hippocampus contribute to cognitive memory functions that mediate symptoms such as memory impairment, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, self-blame, and suicide in patients with depression.\nMoreover, the striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc) and amygdala are involved in emotional memory and regulate symptoms such as anhedonia, anxiety and decreased motivation. The hypothalamus regulates autonomic nervous system function and is associated with changes in sleep, appetite, energy and libido during depression [5,6]. In addition, studies have found that depression reduces synapses and causes atrophy and the reduction of neuronal volume in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and ventral striatum [7]. Autopsy studies of patients with depression have observed decreased neuronal volume in the pre-orbital cortex, a decreased number and volume of glial cells in the frontal cortex and pre-orbital cortex, decreased cortical thickness, and atrophy of the basal ganglia [8]. Morphological studies have confirmed that depression leads to a decrease in the number of neural spines in brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and cortex [3,4,9]. Of note, spine density in the NAc was consistently found to be significantly elevated. For example, Ma et al. [4] found that neuronal spine density in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of LPS-induced depressed rats was decreased,\nwhereas it was significantly increased in the NAc. These changes were reversed after combined treatment with brexpiprazole and fluoxetine. Similar results were also found in antidepressant studies of TrkB. The number of spines in the NAc is increased in depressive conditions, whereas in other brain regions it is reduced [9]. Therefore, in the present study the aim was to explore the underlying mechanisms of spine density changes in the NAc. The NAc includes an outer shell and an inner core and is an important brain region in the mesolimbic dopamine system [10]. This system is well known for its role in regulating the reward mechanism of the brain. Its regulation of feeding, mating and drug addiction is considered to be a possible factor in the development of depressive-like symptoms. More than 95% of the neurons in the NAc are GABAergic medium spiny neurons. The NAc can receive projections from the ventral tegmental area, the prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala. It therefore plays a pivotal role in many conscious actions. The symptoms of anhedonia, loss of interest, and lack of motivation in depressive disorder may be related to the NAc [11]. For example, there is evidence that\u2206FosB in NAc plays an important role in depression and chronic stress resistance [12]. Therefore, we believe that abnormal changes in NAc neurons may be involved in depression-related mechanisms. eIF5A1 is a translational regulator that has been shown to promote neuronal growth [13,14]. We previously reported that eIF5A1 can increase spinal cord neuroplasticity, promote neurofilament protein expression, and increase the formation of neuromuscular junctions [14,15]. eIF5A1 is specifically expressed in embryos and especially in differentiated and proliferating cells. Its expression is greatly reduced at the end of growth and development [16]. A high level of eIF5A1 expression in the developing brain has been reported [17] and this may increase neuronal growth and survival [13]. Mechanistic studies have shown that eIF5A1 is related to the cytoskeleton. The eIF5A1-specific inhibitor GC7 (CAS 150333-69-0) can block cell transition at theG1S phase [18]. The mechanism by which eIF5A1 regulates ribosomal translation remains controversial. Blaha et al. [19] reported that the prokaryotic homolog of eIF5A1, EFP, acts at the 30S and 50S junction of the ribosome, between the P and E sites. There is also evidence that eIF5A1 regulates the translation of consecutive proline structures on the peptide chain, e.g., PPP, PPG, etc. Such structures can slow down or even stop the translation process. eIF5A1 helps to release the consecutive prolines that form a peptide bond, thus accelerating the translation process [20,21]. The aim of this study was therefore to explore whether increased neuroplasticity of the NAc observed in depression is related to eIF5A1.\n2. Methods"

The first two days were the adaptation stage, where two bottles of drinking water were placed in each cage and the position of the bottles was changed at 7:00 AM. From the third day, one bottle was filled with drinking water and the other with 1% sucrose water. Both were weighed before the test. The position of the bottles was changed every day at 7:00 AM to prevent the rats from favoring a certain bottle due to its location. The bottles were weighed after the fifth day and the sucrose preference was calculated as: sucrose water consumption/(sucrose water consumption + normal water consumption).\n2.2.2 Tail Suspension Test (TST) Rats try to escape after hanging from their tails but are unable to, whereupon they give up struggling and enter a special depressed immobility state. The degree of depression was estimated according to the time the rats were still. The rear 1/3 of the tail was fixed with tape and hung on a bracket, with the head about 15 cm from the ground. The first 2 min was the adaptation time. The immobility time from 3 to 6 min was recorded and analyzed using the small animal behavior tracking and recording software Smart 3.0 (Bioseb, Pinellas Park, FL, USA) .\n2.2.3 Forced Swimming Test (FST) The rats were placed in a transparent drum with a 12 cm diameter and which contained water to a height of 10 cm and at a temperature of about 23 \u00b0C. The rats try to escape at first, but give up the struggle a short while later. Similar to the TST, the first 2 min was the adaptation time and the quiescent time from 3 to 6 min was recorded and analyzed using Smart 3.0.\n2.2.4 Lentivirus The hSyn promoter was used to express eIF5A1 mRNA or shRNA so that the virus was specifically expressed in neurons. 293T cells were cultured in six-well plates. Once the cell density reached 80%, the medium was\nreplaced with opti-MEM without penicillin, streptomycin or serum. After incubation at room temperature for 25 min, 30 \u00b5L of Opti-MEM containing 0.5 \u00b5g expression plasmid, 1 \u00b5L packaging plasmid and 3 \u00b5L transfection reagent mixture was added to the 6-well plate and the cells further cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h. Finally, the cell supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter and virus particles were enriched using a Virus Concentration Kit (C2901M, Beyotime, Shanghai, China).\n2.2.5 Western Blotting The NAc was lysed by RIPA, centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min, and the supernatant collected. The protein concentration was then measured by BCA assay. After protein denaturation, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was performed and the proteins transferred to PVDF membranes and blocked with 5% milk. Primary antibodies were incubated as follows: eIF5A1 (1:5000, Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA), ACTB (1:2000, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA). Secondary antibodies (GeneTex, USA) were then incubated at 1:5000 dilution. The HRP-ECL luminescence method was used to detect signal."

Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C as follows: eIF5A1 (Abcam, USA, 1:400), Neun (Abcam, USA, 1:500). Sections were then incubated with fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies (Abcam, USA, 1:1000) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 hours. Finally, the nuclei were stained with DAPI and the sections observed by fluorescence microscopy.\n2.2.8 Golgi Staining The staining was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol for FD Rapid Golgi Staining (FD Neurotechnologies). Under deep anesthesia with 60mg/kg ketamine and 0.25mg/kg medetomidine (i.p.), the rat brains were removed from the skull as quickly as possible and rinsed quickly in Milli-Q water to remove blood from the surface. Tissue preparation was performed according to the manual\u2019s description. Coronal sections of 200\u00b5M thickness were cut on a freezing microtome and then stained using solutions C, D, E and ethanol, respectively. For analysis, 5 sections of NAc area were selected for each brain and 5 evenly distributed pictures were taken on each side of the NAc. As described previously [22,23], Neuron J and Sholl plugins of ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) was used to analyze neuroplasticity. The neuronal processes (axons and dendrites) of each neuron were traced using NeuronJ, a semiautomated tracing software. To describe the dendritic arborization in detail, Sholl analysis of neuronal arbors was used. This creates a series of concentric shells (circles) around the focus of a neuronal arbor and then counts how many times the arbor intersects the sampling shells. Sholl analysis was performed on reconstructed neurons using the Sholl Analysis Plugin for ImageJ 1.8.0 (NIH, Bethesda, USA).\n2.2.9 Neuron Culture One-day old neonatal rats were sacrificed by decapitation and the NAc was harvested and digested with papain for 20min. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in DMEM. The cells were seeded in dishes at a density of 2\u20135 \u00d7 105 cells/ml and cultured for 4 h. The medium was then changed to neurobasal containing B27 (Thermo, USA). When the cells reached 70% density, 10 \u00b5L of virus was added and then after five days the cells were imaged for analysis.\n2.2.10 Proteomic Analysis NAc neurons in which eIF5A1 expression was regulated by the virus were collected and lysed by RIPA. Peptides from different samples were labeled with isotope iTRAQ reagent and the samples analyzed by LCESI-MS/MS. Proteins were identified and analyzed using Mascot 2.3.02 (Matrixscience, USA). The differentially expressed proteins with a >2 fold-change and with p < 0.05 were screened for functional analysis. Considering the positive regulatory effect of eIF5A1 on protein translation, the up-regulated proteins were analyzed in the eIF5A1 overexpression ORF group, while down-regulated proteins were analyzed in the eIF5A1 low expression SH group. GO analysis was performed using DAVID online software https: //david.ncifcrf.gov/."

Several studies have shown neuroplastic changes such as spine density reduction in most areas of the brain after LPS administration. However, spine density in the NAc showed a significant increase after LPS [3,4,9]. We previously demonstrated that eIF5A1 acts as a translational regulator to increase neuroplasticity [14]. In the present study, rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.5 mg/kg) and the expression of eIF5A1 in the NAc was subsequently evaluated. Fig. 1A shows increased protein andmRNA levels for eIF5A1 after LPS administration. Immunofluorescence was used to localize eIF5A1 expression in the NAc. Fig. 1B shows that eIF5A1 co-localized with the neuronal marker NeuN, indicating that it was expressed in neurons. Consistent with the results of molecular experiments, immunofluorescence showed that eIF5A1 expression in neurons was significantly increased after LPS administration. These results suggest that eIF5A1 may be involved in the LPS-induced increase in the density of NAc spines."

            "text": "To confirm the role of eIF5A1 in LPS-induced NAc neuroplasticity, lentivirus was used to decrease eIF5A1 expression in rats NAc. The interfering RNA sequence for eIF5A1was described in our previous study [24]. The hSyn promoter was used to regulate shRNA expression and thus to specifically knockdown eIF5A1 in neurons. Following injection of the virus into the NAc, molecular experimentation was subsequently performed to evaluate eIF5A1 expression. Western blotting results showed that eIF5A1 expression in the NAc of LPS-treated rats was significantly increased compared to the control group, whereas it was significantly reduced after virus injection. On the other hand, the control virus constructed using random sequences had no effect on the increased expression of eIF5A1 in the NAc (Fig. 3A). Reverse transcription PCR was used to measure mRNA expression and similar results to the protein changes were obtained (Fig. 3B). The neuroplasticity changes in NAc were also analyzed by Golgi staining. Sholl analysis revealed that LPS increased neuron intersections and branches (Fig. 3C,D). eIF5A1 knockdown in the NAc significantly decreased the intersection and branches of neurons, whereas the control virus had no effect on the LPS-induced increase in intersections and branches. Spine density also increased in LPS-conditioned rats, but was reduced in rats receiving intra-NAc infusion of Sh-eIF5A1 (Fig. 3E,F). These results suggest that eIF5A1 is involved in LPS-induced NAc neuroplasticity.\nThe NAc plays an important role in the brain\u2019s reward system, which has in turn been implicated in depressive behavior. Therefore, to further analyze whether eIF5A1 could regulate LPS-induced depression-like behaviors, we conducted the Sucrose Preference Test (SPT), Tail Suspension Test (TST) and Forced Swimming Test (FST) in a rat model. For the SPT, the consumption of sucrose water was significantly lower in LPS rats. And the resting time of the TST and FST was significantly longer in LPS rats (Fig. 3G\u2013I). Together, these results suggest that LPS induces depression-like behavior in rats. After knockdown of eIF5A1 in the NAc, the consumption of sucrose water in LPS rats increased significantly, while the immobility time in the TST and FST was significantly shorter, indicating a reduction in depression-like behavior. The random sequence virus used as a control did not change the depression-like behavior in rats (Fig. 3G\u2013I). This result suggests that LPS increases eIF5A1 expression in the NAc to promote neuroplasticity, and this change is involved in the depression-like behavior of rats.\nTo confirm the effect of eIF5A1 in vitro, NAc neurons from one-day old neonatal rats were isolated and cultured. The expression of eIF5A1 in neurons was subsequently regulated by lentivirus. Neurite outgrowth from these neurons was examined 5 days after lentivirus infection. Compared to the control group, the eIF5A1 up-regulated group\nshowed a significant increase in neurite length, whereas the eIF5A1 down-regulated group showed a significant decrease in length (Fig. 4A,B). The control virus did not significantly alter the neuronal processes. Therefore, eIF5A1 was again confirmed to promote the plasticity of NAc neurons."

Proteins with elevated expression in the eIF5A1 up-regulated group, and those with decreased expression in the eIF5A1 downregulated group were compared to the control group. A total of 227 proteins were identified, of which 129 had >2- fold changes with a p value < 0.05 (results are presented in the Supplementary materials). Of these, 52 are closely associated with neuroplasticity (Fig. 5A). Functional analysis performed on the 129 differentially expressed proteins found that biological process (BP) was mainly enriched in items such as synaptic vesicle endocytosis, actin cytoskeleton organization and axon guidance. In the cellular component (CC), items such as axon, synapse and neuron projection are mainly enriched (Fig. 5B).\nNext, we analyzed five proteins with important roles in neuroplasticity from the proteome results (Marked in red in Fig. 5A).

            "text": "Depression is an important psychological disorder characterized by significant and persistent dark mood and aversion to activity as the main clinical features. Depressive episodes are often accompanied by slow thinking, decreased volitional activity, and other somatic symptoms such as loss of appetite and weight loss [3]. The involvement of neuroinflammation in the development of depression has been widely discussed and it is generally believed there are two important pathways. First, some peripheral cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) \u00a0to cause an inflammatory response [25]. Second, there exists a \u201clo-\ncal immune system\u201d. For example, microglia are in a quiescent state under physiological conditions. However, when the brain is subjected to external stimuli such as trauma or infection, microglia turn into active forms and secrete a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species [26]. Previous studies have shown that inflammation is related to depression. It has been reported for example that macrophage-induced inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression [27]. In addition, patients suffering depression of-\nten have increased levels of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in their blood. The administration of pro-inflammatory factors such as LPS induces depressionlike behaviors. Moreover, inflammation-related diseases such as arterial inflammatory disease and cerebral ischemia often cause depressive symptoms [28\u201330]. Therefore, LPSinduced depression-like behavior in a rat model can provide an effective research tool to study the mechanism of depression.\n(A) Representative neuron images of eIF5A1 expression regulated by lentivirus. bar = 50 \u00b5m.

            "text": "Increasing evidence suggests the pathogenic basis for depression involves themesolimbic dopamine system. This system is well known for regulating the reward mechanism of the brain. Regulation of feeding, mating and drug addiction by the mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to be a factor in the development of depressive-like symptoms. The two most important brain regions in this system are the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) [11]. Dopaminergic neurons of the VTA send dopamine neurotransmitter to theGABAergicmedium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the NAc. The NAc is composed of two parts, the core and the shell. GABAergic MSNs comprise more than 95% of all neurons in the NAc. Dopaminergic transmission that affects the VTA-NAc pathway can regulate depression-like behavior in animal models [31].\nOur and other studies found that LPS could elevate the neuroplasticity in the NAc (Fig. 2) [4,32,33]. However, adding LPS directly in cultured neurons couldn\u2019t induce neuroplasticity, but neurotoxicity [34\u201336]. There are two possible mechanisms that we speculate. First is that neuronal projections from other brain regions alter NAc neuroplasticity. The NAc receives projections from glutamatergic neurons in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus, as well as diffuse projections of norepinephrine and serotonin [37]. Moreover, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) also projects to the NAc. Suppressing the activity of BLA neurons can effectively alleviate depression-like behaviors [38]. The NAc is clearly a major hub that integrates signals for the brain reward system. Under LPS stimulation, co-projection from multiple brain regions may enhance neuroplasticity of the NAc. The second is that LPS improves NAc neuroplasticity by glial cells.\nStimulating primary microglia and astrocytes with LPS increased neurotrophic factors secretion [39,40]. These neurotrophic factors may promote neuroplasticity in the NAc by increasing the branches and spines density of neurons. Therefore, LPS may not directly target neurons but alter the neuronal microenvironment of the NAc to induce neuroplasticity."

Here, LPS treatment showed an increased expression of eIF5A1 in NAc neurons (Fig. 1). We further knocked down eIF5A1 in NAc neurons, and the results showed that the expression of eIF5A1 was reduced to the level of the control group, and the spine density and depression symptoms was also reduced to the control level (Fig. 3). Since shRNA is used as a tool for knocking down genes, its own characteristics make it impossible to further reduce eIF5A1 expression. A better tool is knockout mice, but homozygous eIF5A1 embryos died early in embryonic development [40]. Therefore, we will try to create conditional knockout mice in the future. After proteomic experiments, the results showed that eIF5A1 regulated neuroplasticity-associated proteins (Fig. 5). Among them, Rab GDI\u03b1 (GDIA) regulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of most Rab proteins by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from them, and the subsequent binding of GTP to them. It\u2019s thought to function in the processes by which transport vesicles identify and/or fuse with their respective target membranes [41]. Lack of \u03b1GDI impairs synaptic vesicle biogenesis and recycling in the hippocampus [42]. SNAP-25(SNP25) and VAMP-2 are major SNARE protein of synaptic vesicles which mediates fusion of synaptic vesicles to release neurotransmitters [43]. And we also demonstrated that the intermediate filament protein vimentin increased neurite outgrowth [44]. Thus eIF5A1 promotes neuroplasticity by increasing the translation of these proteins."

            "text": "Human eIF5A1 consists of 154 amino acids and is highly conserved in eukaryotic cells [24]. eIF5A1 is the only protein found to contain the uncommon amino acid, hypusine. The 50th lysine residue of eIF5A1 is catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase to form deoxyhypusine, which is then hydroxylated by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase to form hypusine [45]. eIF5A1 stimulates the translation of mRNA. Knockdown of eIF5A1 results in reduced protein synthesis and polysome size. Conversely, adding purified eIF5A1 to in vitro cells can significantly restore protein synthesis and rescue the cells from eIF5A1 inhibition [46].\nInitially, eIF5A1 and its homologous protein EF-P were thought to play a role in the initiation of protein translation. It was speculated that eIF5A1 is not involved in the entire process of protein synthesis, but only in the formation of the first peptide bond [47,48]. However, this molecule was also subsequently found to contribute to the elongation process during protein translation [46,49]. There is now evidence that eIF5A1 stimulates elongation, but not initiation. Reduction of the eIF5A1 level in yeast was observed to decrease protein synthesis by only 30%, raising doubts about eIF5A1 as a translation initiation factor [50]. More\nrecent studies have re-examined the role of eIF5A1 in protein translation. It has been demonstrated that eIF5A1 binds to active ribosomes, suggesting it plays a central role in the control of translation [51]. Another important finding was that eIF5A1 accelerates the translation of proteins containing polyproline structures (PPP or PPG), thus preventing the stall of translational due to polyproline [20,21]. Cryoprecipitation electron microscopy has revealed that eIF5A1 binds to ribosomal 80S and is localized between the P and E sites. The hypusine residue of eIF5A1 can be inserted into the pocket formed by the CAA end of P-tRNA. In this\nway, eIF5A1 assists the translation of polyproline by stabilizing the ribosomal structure, rather than by catalyzing the synthesis of peptide bonds [52]. eIF5A1 can also interact with eIF2 by binding eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet and thereby stimulating its binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit, causing eIF2 to dissociate from the ribosome. Ultimately, inhibition of GDP dissociation by eIF5A1 promotes translation of the protein [53]. Taken together, these results have clarified the role of eIF5A1 in protein translation. However, the central role of eIF5A1 in translation still requires further exploration.\n5. Conclusions In the present study we investigated whether eIF5A1\nwas elevated in the NAc of LPS-treated rats and whether it regulated neuroplasticity. Our results indicate that increased neuroplasticity of NAcmay be due to up-regulation of eIF5A1 by LPS. This finding provides new evidence that the brain\u2019s reward system is involved in depression.\nAuthor Contributions QL and FFS designed the research study. QL, HZ and\nLL performed the research.
