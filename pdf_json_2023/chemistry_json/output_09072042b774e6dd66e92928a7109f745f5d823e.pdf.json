    "abstractText": "In this study, pig manure rich in phosphorus was used as the recovery object, In order to realize the maximum recovery of phosphorus resources in pig manure, this study established a phosphorus recovery route combining the electrochemical method with the Vivianite method using sacrificial iron anode. And in order to obtain phosphorus rich supernatant, pig manure was treated with different pH values, and the changes in phosphorus components and metal content in the liquid phase were mainly investigated; Graded phosphorus components and microbial communities in the solid phase; Finally, the effect of electrolytic recovery of phosphorus from fermentation supernatant was studied. The results showed that the highest total phosphorus (TP) content in the liquid phase follows a trend of acidity > control > alkalinity; The analysis of the results of solid-phase phosphorus fractionation extraction shows that acidic conditions are more conducive to the release of Non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) and Apatite inorganic phosphorus (AP); The microbial community promotes the release of phosphorus by participating in the decomposition of fermentation substrates; The analysis of the change of metal content in the liquid phase before and after electrolysis showed that the two chamber electrolytic cell can not remove other metal components while recovering the vivianite; More than 90% of the phosphorus in the supernatant after fermentation was recovered by electrolysis. The characterization results showed that 84.66% of the precipitate was Vivianite.",

            "text": "release from pig manure and phosphorus recovery by vivianite method Tengshu Chen 1*, Xingfu Song 2 & Mengyao Xing 3\nIn this study, pig manure rich in phosphorus was used as the recovery object, In order to realize the maximum recovery of phosphorus resources in pig manure, this study established a phosphorus recovery route combining the electrochemical method with the Vivianite method using sacrificial iron anode. And in order to obtain phosphorus rich supernatant, pig manure was treated with different pH values, and the changes in phosphorus components and metal content in the liquid phase were mainly investigated; Graded phosphorus components and microbial communities in the solid phase; Finally, the effect of electrolytic recovery of phosphorus from fermentation supernatant was studied. The results showed that the highest total phosphorus (TP) content in the liquid phase follows a trend of acidity > control > alkalinity; The analysis of the results of solid-phase phosphorus fractionation extraction shows that acidic conditions are more conducive to the release of Non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) and Apatite inorganic phosphorus (AP); The microbial community promotes the release of phosphorus by participating in the decomposition of fermentation substrates; The analysis of the change of metal content in the liquid phase before and after electrolysis showed that the two chamber electrolytic cell can not remove other metal components while recovering the vivianite; More than 90% of the phosphorus in the supernatant after fermentation was recovered by electrolysis. The characterization results showed that 84.66% of the precipitate was Vivianite.\nWith the large-scale and intensive development of China\u2019s pig breeding industry, the wastewater produced in the process of breeding will pollute the water. The problem of pollution has become increasingly serious and has become the main source of pollution in rural areas of China. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the wastewater is 5000\u201320,000\u00a0mg/L, the ammonia nitrogen (NH3\u2013N) is 600\u20131600\u00a0mg/L, the P concentration is 100\u2013250\u00a0mg/L, and it carries a large number of pathogenic bacteria, giving off a very strong odor. Generally, livestock manure is regarded as a nutrient resource pool because it contains a large amount of organic matter and is the source of nitrogen (N), P and kalium (K)1. However, the total P loss of China increased from 0.2 million tons in 1950 to 3.1 million tons in 20102, most of which was due to the direct release of animal manure from livestock farms into water3, on the one hand, excessive P discharged into the water will cause the waste of resources, and on the other hand, it will also cause eutrophication of water. In addition, the Ministry of Electricity and Water Resources has studied the reserves and consumption of P, and they predict that the global P ore resources will be exhausted in the next 50\u2013100\u00a0years, resulting in a surge in the price of P ore market4.\nPrevious studies have shown that phosphate can be removed from wastewater by chemical precipitation, biological polyphosphate accumulation or the combination of the two methods5. Chemical P removal includes adding Ca, Fe or Al to combine phosphate to form precipitation6. Pig manure also contains a large amount of phosphate. Most of the P will be released into the supernatant after treatment.

Most of the P released during the fermentation process is in the form of phosphate (PO43\u2212). Furthermore, with the progress of hydrolysis acidification, the P concentration also increased rapidly, and PO43\u2212\u2013P increased from 50L to 280\u00a0mg/L 20\u00a0days later10. The excrement contains a large amount of P, and most of the treated P is free state, which is convenient for subsequent recycling. The phosphorus content in pig manure is closely related to the cleaning method. The most common defecation processes in intensive pig farms in China include dry defecation, water flushing, and water soaking. Dry defecation has high value as a manure fertilizer, making it easy to compost at high temperatures. However, most of the phosphorus is present in the manure and cannot be directly utilized; Water flushing has advantages such as low labor intensity and high efficiency, but the amount of wastewater is large, the concentration of pollutants is high, and the phosphorus content in wastewater is low; Soaked feces have low labor intensity and high efficiency. Long term soaking of feces can create conditions similar to anaerobic fermentation, promote phosphorus release, and have a high phosphorus content in the supernatant. Due to the significant impact of different defecation methods on phosphorus release in pig manure, this study adopted a pre-treatment method of adding water to dry manure and soaking manure.\nThe emerging vivianite recovery method can only be formed in an environment rich in P and iron. The optimum formation pH is 6\u2013811. Vivianite has high economic value, the price of vivianite is about 10,000 \u20ac/t. And it is the basic raw material for the production of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), Lithium iron phosphate is increasingly used as a precursor in the manufacture of lithium-ion secondary batteries12,13. The use of vivianite as a pigment can be traced back to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries14,15. And large high-purity vivianite has high collection value16. At the same time, vivianite also plays an important role in Heavy metal fixation (HMs), carbon tetrachloride (CT) dechlorination, P retention and eutrophication mitigation17.Therefore, the recovery of P by the vivianite has great development potential.\nThe previous experiment successfully set up a two-chamber electrolytic cell and successfully recovered more than 97% of P in the form of vivianite18. This study has established a phosphorus recovery route combining the electrochemical method using sacrificial iron anode and the Vivianite method. Compared with other Vivianite synthesis methods, it can achieve rapid phosphorus removal, wide application range, simple operation, easy collection of products and other advantages. This experiment is the follow-up work of the previous experiment. The main research content is to take pig manure as the object, conduct anaerobic fermentation through pH adjustment to obtain P-rich supernatant, and then use the two-chamber electrolytic tank to treat the supernatant, demonstrating the feasibility of the two-chamber electrolytic tank to recover vivianite for actual sewage treatment. .The experiment was made in triplicate and an average value was reported."

In the acid zone (pH is 5\u20136), on the first day of fermentation, the P in the liquid phase rose to 494.7\u00a0mg/L and 403.9\u00a0mg/L respectively, and as time went on, the P release under pH = 5 conditions reached a\n(1)\u03b7P = C0 \u2212 Ct\nC0 \u00d7 100%\n(2)K = ( 1\u2212\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n1\u2212 X\n1.5\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n)\n\u00d7 100%\nFigure\u00a02.

On the 7th day after fermentation, the final P content was 515.3\u00a0mg/L, 1.25 times higher than 411.1\u00a0mg/L in the NC group. Under the condition of pH = 6, the P content continued to rise in the following period, and the final content remained at 604.3\u00a0mg/L, 1.47 times higher than that of the NC group 411.1\u00a0mg/L.\nAt pH = 8, pH = 9 and pH = 10, the P content increased to 233.8\u00a0mg/L, 110.3\u00a0mg/L and 129.5\u00a0mg/L respectively on the first day of fermentation. When the fermentation reached the the\u00a0fourth\u00a0day, the P content rose to a larger value in the pH range, and the P content did not increase rapidly in the subsequent period, it remained within the relatively stable error range, and the final P release was lower than the control group. This phenomenon shows that in the anaerobic fermentation of pig manure, acid treatment is beneficial to the release of P, while alkaline treatment is not conducive to the release of P.\nIn summary, speaking, the P release effect generally follows the trend of acid > neutral > control > alkaline. The final P release under acidic conditions was greater than that of the control group, while the final P release under alkaline conditions was lower than that of the control group. It also follows the trend that the higher the pH, the less the P release. Therefore, it can be concluded that promotion effect of anaerobic fermentation of pig manure under acidic conditions is better than that under alkaline conditions."

            "text": "After the end of anaerobic fermentation by adjusting pH, the P content in the solid phase of pig manure decreased to varying degrees. This also confirmed that acid\u2013base regulation is also conducive to the release of P in sludge. As shown in the Fig.\u00a03, Organic phosphorus (OP) content after fermentation still occupies a small part. After pH adjustment, the residual P content in pig manure is 30\u00a0mg/L, regardless of acid and alkali conditions, which proves that acid and alkali adjustment has similar effect on promoting the release of OP, while OP under acidic conditions is slightly lower than OP under alkaline conditions, because acidity is more conducive to the disintegration of small and medium-sized particles in pig manure.\nNAIP is still the component with the highest content in the solid P component. On the whole, the content of NAIP under acidic conditions is lower than that under alkaline conditions, and the content of NAIP under alkaline conditions is also higher than 134.9\u00a0mg/L of the NC group, indicating that the promotion of NAIP release effect under alkaline conditions is weak. The P release of NAIP under acidic conditions is mainly due to the leaching of metal ions, and the release of NAIP under alkaline conditions depends on the competition between OH\u2212 and PO43\u2212 adsorption sites. The residual content of AP under acidic conditions is far less than that under alkaline conditions. Under alkaline conditions, the content of AP remains stable, indicating that alkaline conditions are not conducive to the release of AP, and even lead to the formation of AP. AP is usually used as calcium-bound P of non-active P. Under acidic conditions, Ca2+ is leached by acid to release calcium-bound P. However, under alkaline conditions, the release amount is less or even no, indicating that alkaline conditions are not suitable for AP release."

Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes are the main microorganisms in the anaerobic digestion system20\u201322. In the sludge of the NC group, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were the dominant species, accounting for 19.64%, 20.77% and 50.29% of the total flora, respectively. The research shows that the two dominant microflora animal\nFigure\u00a03. Distribution diagram of solid phosphorus components.\n5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16095 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43216-5\nintestines are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes23. Therefore, in the analysis of microbial community, the sum of these two kinds of bacteria accounts for more than 1/3 of the total microflora.\nIn the control group, Proteobacteria is the dominant flora, accounting for 50.3% of the total flora. Proteobacteria is the largest of the bacteria, which has important metabolic functions in anaerobic digestion24. It can use small molecular compounds such as glucose and butyrate to promote the degradation of amino acids and long-chain fatty acids. The main function of Bacteroidetes is to decompose carbohydrates and plant wall cell polysaccharides, while Thicklyophila can degrade organic substances such as starch and protein25. After different pH treatments, compared with the NC group, Firmicutes became the most dominant species. The reason is that Firmicutes can effectively resist the extreme environment, so it can adapt to the pH changes after acid/alkali treatment and enrich, lead to the population abundance increased after acid and alkali treatment. The abundance of Proteobacteria decreased from 50.3 to 10.29\u201322.55%, and it is no longer the dominant species in the bacterial community. Because Proteobacteria mainly plays the role of inducing cell lysis and releasing intracellular substances, this proves that the alkali-regulated AF process can reduce the organic P and degrade the insoluble protein26. Furthermore, it is reported that Spirochaetes is the main strain that promotes glucose fermentation to produce acetate, ethanol, H2, CO2 and other intermediates27.\nIn summary, the existence of microorganisms relies on various substrates as nutrients, decomposing and producing various substances that can be directly utilized by phosphorus accumulating microorganisms, such as short chain volatile fatty acids, as energy sources for anaerobic phosphorus release. At the same time, microorganisms can induce cell lysis and release intracellular substances, which in turn decompose into phosphorus elements, causing the phosphorus concentration in the supernatant to gradually increase. In addition, OP in sludge can be released into the liquid phase through sludge disintegration, and then converted into PO43\u2013 P through biological action. It can also be directly converted from solid phase OP to PO43\u2212\u2013P through biomineralization.\nEffect of anaerobic fermentation on metal/heavy metal release With the adjustment of pH, metal ions will inevitably be produced in the liquid phase. Through further analysis of metal ions, the mechanism of pH affecting the release of P in pig manure will be further clarified. As shown in the Fig.\u00a05, under the condition of pH = 5, the contents of metals and heavy metals in the liquid phase are 1134.1\u00a0mg/L, 256.9\u00a0mg/L, 3.9\u00a0mg/L, 13.2\u00a0mg/L, 0.6\u00a0mg/L and 1.2\u00a0mg/L respectively. The content of major metals Ca2+, Mg2+ is the highest, and the content gradually decreases with the increase of pH. Under acidic conditions, Ca2+ mainly comes from the dissolution of AP, while Mg2+and Fe3+/Fe2+come from the dissolution of NAIP, which is consistent with the P composition in the solid phase. The dissolution of AP and NAIP causes the increase of the content of Mg2+ and Ca2+. With the increase of pH, the content of the two metals gradually decreased, because the combination of OH\u2212 and Mg2+ subsequently formed metal hydroxide. The decrease of Ca2+ concentration may be due to the formation of apatite from Ca2+ and PO43\u2212 under alkaline conditions, indicating that alkaline conditions are not conducive to AP release, which is consistent with the results of solid-phase phosphorus fractionation extraction. In addition, the contents of Ca2+ and Mg2+ under alkaline conditions are lower than those of NC 646.8\u00a0mg/L and 165.3\u00a0mg/L, which also indicates that metal hydroxide is formed under alkaline conditions. The contents of heavy metals Cu2+ and Zn2+ in the liquid phase are very small, and they are 0.6\u00a0mg/L and 1.2\u00a0mg/L respectively at pH = 5. And its content decreased significantly with the increase of pH, and decreased to 0.1\u00a0mg/L and 0.3\u00a0mg/L respectively at pH = 10. Similar to the release law of major metals, heavy metals are released by acid leaching, and retained in the solid phase by forming hydroxide precipitation under alkaline conditions.\nThe result evaluation of P recovery in two-chamber electrolytic cell The supernatant after fermentation is analyzed and evaluated for P recovery by two-chamber electrolysis. The sampling interval is 1\u00a0h.The content of PO43\u2212- in the solution was determined after the samples passed through 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm membrane, and the P change trend was shown in the Fig.\u00a06. The experimental results show that under different pH conditions, the residual P content in the solution is lower than 10\u00a0mg/L, and the P recovery rate\nFigure\u00a04. Relative abundance distribution of microbial community at phylum level under different pH conditions.\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16095 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43216-5\nis more than 90%, which proves that the effect of P recovery in the two-chamber electrolytic cell is excellent. P removal time is different under different pH conditions. The higher the P content, the longer the removal time, the higher the pH, and the shorter the removal time. However, P removal does not follow a linear change, indicating that P removal is not constant per unit time, which indicates that P removal is a dynamic imbalance process. In addition, under high pH conditions, the removal rate of P per unit time is faster. At the same time, it is observed in the reaction that the precipitate formed in the reactor is dark green, and rapidly turns to reddish brown when placed in the air. It is speculated that the product contains a large amount of Fe(OH)2, and the removal of P is mainly the adsorption of hydrogen oxides28. Previous studies have shown that when the pH value is fixed in the range of 6\u20137, the phosphate removal efficiency is the highest, and a large amount of precipitates into vivianite29.\nChange of metal composition after electrolytic supernatant In order to explore the influence of the two-chamber electrolytic cell on the change of metal ions in the solution, the composition of metal ions in the electrolytic solution was analyzed. Previous studies have found that, the pH of the vivianite synthesized in the two-chamber electrolytic cell is stable at 6.29 \u00b1 0.2. In this experiment, the final pH was maintained at 6.45 \u00b1 0.1 under the condition of electrolysis of pH = 6. From the perspective of resource and economy, only the electrolytic results under this condition were quantitatively analyzed, and the supernatant after anaerobic fermentation of pH = 6 and NC was selected as the research object. After the completion of electrolysis, the residual P is 10.5\u00a0mg/L and 8.2\u00a0mg/L, and the P recovery rate is 96.58% and 95.43% respectively, which is also the maximum P recovery value in this experiment. The change of metal after electrolysis is shown in the Fig.\u00a07: the result shows that under the condition of pH = 6, the content of Fe3+/Fe2+ increases from 13.98 to 1491.9\u00a0mg/L, and the content of Fe3+/Fe2+ in NC increases from 8.2 to 501.1\u00a0mg/L. The results show that the electrolytic iron anode of the two-chamber electrolytic cell has achieved the expected effect. Other metal\nFigure\u00a05.

Under pH = 6, Ca2+ and Mg2+ decreased by about 3.9% and 27% respectively. Under NC conditions, Ca2+ and Mg2+ decreased by 19% and 1.6% respectively. Al3+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ also decreased to varying degrees, but the change is small due to its low content.\nThe change of metal composition may be due to the formation of insoluble metal hydroxide attached to the surface of proton membrane due to the increase of local pH, which is considered as membrane pollution. However, this kind of precipitation is less than the detection threshold, so the existence of these metal ions is not detected in the EDS analysis of subsequent precipitation. Therefore, the removal of metal ions in the twochamber electrolytic cell in this experiment is not obvious, and it is not suitable to remove certain metal ions by forming hydroxide precipitation, and it also proves that other metal ions do not participate in the formation of vivianite. During this reaction process, there may be the following reactions:"

Therefore, for the subsequent anaerobic fermentation, under the condition of avoiding acid and alkali pollution, neutral fermentation can be used, and under this pH condition, the phosphate recovery rate is the best, which is also the theoretical pH range of vivianite synthesis. For the contribution of different P components, acidic conditions are more suitable for the release of NAIP and AP, and the NC group is also higher than the P contribution under alkaline conditions. The content of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions gradually decreases with the increase of pH, and the content of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions is high under acidic conditions due to the acid dissolution of metal ions, while the decrease of ion content under alkaline conditions is due to the formation of metal hydroxide precipitation.
