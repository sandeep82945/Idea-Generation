Conclusive observational evidence f such a connection remains elusi ve, ho we ver, as studies that iffer in their selection of active galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts and erging galaxies yield conflicting results, from a strong mergerGN connection to no connection at all (see e.g. Ellison et al. 2019 , nd references therein).\nThe AGN feedback associated with merger-induced BH growth ould have a transformative effect on the star formation activity in the emnant galaxy. AGNs are observed to drive mass-loaded outflows hat could significantly deplete their host galaxies of interstellar gas e.g. Rupke & Veilleux 2011 ; Maiolino et al. 2012 ; Harrison et al. 014 ; F \u0308orster Schreiber et al. 2019 ; Fluetsch et al. 2019 ; Circosta t al. 2021 ; Concas et al. 2022 ), and the BH mass (or a proxy for it) s the best predictor of quenching in galaxy surv e ys (e.g. Kauffmann\nE-mail: j.j.davies@ucl.ac.uk\nt g r\nPub\nt al. 2006 ; Cheung et al. 2012 ; Fang et al. 2013 ; Terrazas et al. 016 , 2017 ; Bluck et al. 2020 ; Piotrowska et al. 2021 ). While AGN eedback has long been recognized as the most likely means of egulating the growth of massive galaxies (e.g. Bower et al. 2006 ; roton et al. 2006 ; McCarthy et al. 2010 ; Fabian 2012 ), cosmological imulations such as EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA have only ecently revealed an intimate connection between BH growth and the tar formation rates of lower mass, Milky Way-like galaxies, with he impact of AGN feedback on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) laying a key role in this connection. In these simulations, correlations exist (at fixed halo mass) etween the central BH mass, halo g as content, and g alaxy star ormation rate (Dav \u0301e et al. 2019 ; Davies et al. 2019 , 2020 ; Terrazas t al. 2020 ; Appleby et al. 2021 ; Cui et al. 2021 ; Robson & Dav \u0301e 021 ), and the cooling time of the CGM (Davies et al. 2020 ; Zinger t al. 2020 ), such that quenched galaxies typically host o v ermassiv e Hs and have gas-poor and inefficiently-cooling circumgalactic eservoirs. Together, these correlations suggest that for quiescence o be achieved and maintained in Milky Way-like galaxies, AGN eedback must eject a large fraction of the CGM o v er the galaxy\u2019s lifeime, preventing the CGM from efficiently cooling and replenishing he galaxy\u2019s gas supply for star formation. This connection remains hallenging to demonstrate through observations, though analysis f soft X-ray maps from the eFEDS surv e y pro vides encouraging vidence that star-forming galaxies with stellar masses similar to he Milky Way have brighter X-ray atmospheres than quenched alaxies of similar mass, suggesting that their haloes are more gasich (Chadayammuri et al. 2022 ).\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s) lished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nd c l b p t t e T h t h M t\ns B P r c a a e\nc w a p o a g o h a m\nc e a i B d a o o s\n2\nI E c \u2018 2 d s l t a ( d g\n2\nI t b f g h s h E s s ( c ( t\nE w f e f a i M s\nw a i f o m M r\ne t ( c i s i r r h a o p h t a\nm\nw\nm\nH g t V\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\nDisrupti ve e vents such as galaxy mergers could play a key role in riving the BH growth and AGN feedback needed to produce these orrelations. In addition to the aforementioned theoretical studies inking mergers and rapid BH growth, this hypothesis is supported y other, related correlations in the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG galaxy opulations; at fixed halo mass, galaxies hosted by gas-rich haloes end to be star-forming discs, while those with gas-poor haloes end to exhibit disturbed, dispersion-dominated kinematics (Davies t al. 2020 ), indicative of an earlier merger or disruption event. hrough the AGN feedback they induce, galaxy mergers could ave a transformati ve ef fect on the content and physical state of he CGM, fundamentally altering the baryon cycle of the galaxy\u2013 alo ecosystem. In this study, we investigate how the CGM of a ilky Way-like galaxy is affected by a merger event, and examine he consequences for the evolution of the remnant galaxy. We do so by performing a controlled experiment on a single galaxy, imulated in its full cosmological context using the \u2018zoom\u2019 technique. y using the genetic modification (GM) technique (Roth, Pontzen & eiris 2016 ), we are able to systematically adjust the stellar mass atio of an individual merger that occurs in this galaxy\u2019s lifetime, ausing a more disruptive event or even preventing it from happening ltogether, whilst preserving the o v erall halo mass accretion history nd environment of the galaxy (see e.g. Pontzen et al. 2017 ; Sanchez t al. 2019 , 2021 ).\nBy using this method to probe how mergers impact the baryon ycle, we disentangle different effects in a way that is not possible ith statistical studies. The connection between mergers, AGN, nd the CGM may depend on the halo and stellar masses of the articipating galaxies, the luminosity of the AGN, the identification f merging systems, the properties of the environment, and the halo ccretion and merger histories. By examining the evolution of a single alaxy and adjusting one variable (in this case, the stellar mass ratio f a merger), we can keep the environment fixed and reveal in detail ow each of the aforementioned quantities changes in response to this djustment. This enables us to establish a causal link between this erger , A GN feedback, and the evolution of the galaxy and its CGM. We begin by describing our numerical experiment, the simulation ode employed, and our analysis techniques in Section 2 . We v aluate the mass assembly and merger histories of our galaxy nd its genetically modified counterparts in Section 3.1 , before nvestigating how a merger affects the evolution of the central H and the CGM in Section 3.2 . We examine how mergers can rive high BH accretion rates in Section 3.3 , and explore how the ssociated AGN feedback impacts the thermodynamic properties f the CGM in Section 3.4 . Finally, we explore the consequences f this process for the evolution of the galaxy in Section 3.5 , and ummarize and discuss our results in Section 4 .\nM E T H O D S\nn this study, we produce a suite of simulations evolved using the AGLE version of the gravity and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics ode GADGET3 (last described by Springel 2005 ). We employ the zoom\u2019 simulation technique (e.g. Katz & White 1993 ; Bertschinger 001 ) to follow the evolution of an individual galaxy and its immeiate environment at high resolution, while also simulating a largecale periodic volume using collisionless gravitational dynamics at ow resolution, thus preserving the correct large-scale forces. In his section, we describe how our candidate galaxy was selected nd how its zoom initial conditions were constructed and evolved Section 2.1 ), outline how its genetically modified variants were esigned (Section 2.2 ) and describe how we identify and track alaxies and haloes within the simulations (Section 2.3 ).\n.1 Construction and evolution of the initial conditions\nn this study, our unmodified fiducial galaxy (henceforth referred o as the ORGANIC system) is the same system that was studied y Davies, Crain & Pontzen ( 2021 ), to which we refer the reader or further details. In brief, we selected a present-day central disc alaxy with stellar mass M = 4.3 \u00d7 10 10 M that is hosted by a alo of mass M 200 = 3.4 \u00d7 10 12 M . We focus on this halo mass cale as this is where correlations between the central BH masses, alo gas contents and specific star formation rates of present-day AGLE central galaxies are the strongest (Davies et al. 2020 ). We elected this particular galaxy because it lies on the star-forming main equence (sSFR = 10 \u221210.2 yr \u22121 ) and has a CGM mass fraction, f CGM normalised to the cosmic baryon fraction b / 0 ), of 0.31, which is lose to the median value at this mass in the flagship EAGLE volume Davies et al. 2020 ). We define f CGM \u2261 M CGM / M 200 , where M CGM is he total mass of all gas within the virial radius that is not star forming.\nThe galaxy was not selected from the publicly available suite of AGLE simulations, but from a separate periodic simulation volume, hich was evolved using the Reference EAGLE simulation model\nrom initial conditions generated with the GENETIC software (Stopyra t al. 2021 ). This parent volume adopts the cosmological parameters rom Planck Collaboration XIII ( 2016 ), is L = 50 cMpc on a side, nd contains 512 3 dark matter particles of mass 3.19 \u00d7 10 7 M and, nitially, an equal number of baryonic particles of mass 5.6 \u00d7 10 6 , a particle resolution similar to that of the standard EAGLE imulation suite. To generate our zoomed initial conditions, we select all particles\nithin a sphere of radius r = 3 r 200 centred on our candidate galaxy, nd identify the Lagrangian region defined by these particles in the nitial conditions. We then refine this Lagrangian region using a actor of 8 more particles, while also downsampling the remainder f the simulation volume by a factor of 8, yielding particle masses of g = 7.35 \u00d7 10 5 M , m dm = 3.98 \u00d7 10 6 M , and m lr = 3.02 \u00d7 10 8 for gas, dark matter, and low-resolution mass tracer particles, espectively. We evolve these initial conditions with the EAGLE model (Crain t al. 2015 ; Schaye et al. 2015 ; McAlpine et al. 2016 ). We adopt he recalibrated (Recal) parameter values defined by Schaye et al. 2015 ) for EAGLE\u2019s subgrid physical prescriptions, as these were alibrated at a mass resolution close to that of our simulations. To solate the impact of AGN feedback, we also perform complementary imulations in which BHs are not seeded, and hence AGN feedback s absent. Detailed descriptions of the EAGLE model (and its ecalibration for use at higher resolution) may be found in the EAGLE eference articles listed abo v e, so for brevity we do not include one ere. Given that the focus of this work is on the impact of BH growth nd AGN feedback; ho we ver, we summarize the implementation f these processes in the EAGLE model. BHs are treated as \u2018sink\u2019 articles which are seeded on the fly at the centres of dark matter aloes when they attain a mass of 10 10 M h \u22121 . They then grow hrough a combination of BH\u2013BH mergers and Eddington-limited ccretion at a rate given by \u02d9 accr = m\u0307 Bondi \u00d7 min ( C \u22121 visc ( c s /V \u03c6) 3 , 1 ) , (1)\nhere m\u0307 Bondi is the Bondi & Hoyle ( 1944 ) rate,\n\u02d9 Bondi = 4 \u03c0G 2 M 2 BH \u03c1\n( c 2 s + v 2 ) 3 / 2 , (2)\nere, the quantities \u03c1, v, V \u03c6 , and c s describe the properties of the as within the BH kernel (i.e. within the SPH smoothing length of he BH); \u03c1 is the density, v is the bulk velocity relative to the BH, \u03c6 is the rotation velocity around the BH and c s is the sound speed.\nMNRAS 515, 1430\u20131443 (2022)\nM\nT B t m s T h a i b\ns e c S a o c H c e a s c w\n2\nW P c g B ( t m r\n7 r o m 0 s o i d F B c\na s p b i c t\n1\no m\no fi r W a s S ( S\ns a s g f t \u2248 a s d\n2\nH t ( a o ( t ( t\nd t b t s w O g n n i i b\na a c P G c q f\n\u03ba\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\nhe factor C \u22121 visc ( c s /V \u03c6) 3 modulates the purely spherically symmetric\nondi rate according to the rotational kinematics of the gas within he BH\u2019s SPH kernel, since the accretion of gas with high angular\nomentum through an accretion disc is posited to proceed more lowly than the Bondi\u2013Hoyle rate (see Rosas-Guevara et al. 2015 ). he value of C visc is set to 2 \u03c0 \u00d7 10 3 in the Recal model employed ere. 1 Energy from AGN feedback is injected thermally and with fixed efficiency at a rate E\u0307 AGN = 0 . 015 \u0307m accr c 2 , by stochastically ncreasing the temperature of the BH\u2019s neighbouring SPH particles y T AGN = 10 9 K. EAGLE\u2019s subgrid model includes stochastic elements; the converion of gas particles to star particles and the coupling of feedback nergy to gas require that quasi-random numbers be drawn and ompared to probabilities set by the properties of the gas (see chaye & Dalla Vecchia 2008 ; Dalla Vecchia & Schaye 2012 ). In sufficiently large cosmological volume, the emergent properties f the galaxy population are, in a statistical sense, insensitive the hoice of the initial seed for the quasi-random number generator. o we ver, when considering the evolution of individual systems, this hoice can cause significant uncertainty (e.g. Genel et al. 2019 ; Keller t al. 2019 ; Davies et al. 2021 ). To demonstrate that our results re borne out of differences in merger/assembly history and do not imply reflect stochastic noise, we simulate each unique set of initial onditions (both with and without BH seeding and AGN feedback) ith nine different seeds each.\n.2 Producing genetically modified galaxies\ne use the genetic modification (GM) technique (Roth et al. 2016 ; ontzen et al. 2017 ) to generate several complementary sets of initial onditions that yield adjusted merger histories for the ORGANIC alaxy, whilst preserving the large-scale environment of the system. y applying this technique, the initial conditions generator GENETIC Stopyra et al. 2021 ) yields a modified field that is as close as possible o the original field and remains consistent with a Lambda cold dark atter ( CDM) cosmology, but which also satisfies constraints that esult in a modified merger history. For our experiment, we focus on a merger that occurs at t \u2248\nGyr ( z \u2248 0.74) for the ORGANIC galaxy, with a stellar mass atio \u03bc \u2261 M infall /M = 0 . 17, where M infall and M are the masses f the infalling and primary galaxies, respectively. We define \u2018major\u2019 ergers to have \u03bc > 0.25, and \u2018minor\u2019 mergers to have 0.1 < \u03bc < .25. This is the galaxy\u2019s last significant merger (i.e. \u03bc > 0.1), and we elected it for modification because it has the most significant effect n the galaxy\u2019s dynamical history; as shown by Davies et al. ( 2021 ), t remo v es some rotational support from the galaxy disc, but is not isruptive enough to transform the galaxy into a spheroid by z = 0. ollowing the merger, there is a modest increase in the supermassive H (SMBH) mass and a decrease in the CGM gas mass, but the entral galaxy remains actively star forming to z = 0.\nWe generate a pair of modified initial conditions, designed to djust the ratio, \u03bc, of this merger, with the aim of enhancing or uppressing its disruptive effects. To achieve this, we identify all articles that are bound to the infalling halo at z = 1.73, trace them ack to their locations in the initial conditions (at z = 99), and ncrease or decrease the mean o v erdensity in the patch of the field ontaining those particles. To fix the mass of the main galaxy at his time, we apply the simultaneous constraint that the o v erdensity\nNRAS 515, 1430\u20131443 (2022)\nRosas-Gue v ara et al. ( 2015 ) showed that the results of this prescription are nly weakly dependent on the precise value of C visc , since the ratio V \u03c6 / c s is ore important.\nw a o d\nf the matter that will comprise the main halo at z = 1.73 remains xed, and we also require that the o v erdensity across the Lagrangian egion of the z = 0 halo is kept fixed to preserve the final halo mass.\ne note that while the g alaxy\u2013g alaxy merger occurs at z \u2248 0.74, we djust the properties of the haloes at z = 1.73 because this is the latest napshot output in which the haloes are clearly distinguishable by the UBFIND algorithm. We henceforth refer to these initial conditions and the galaxies/haloes that evolve from them) as ENHANCED and UPPRESSED .\nFor each of our simulations, the state of the particles in the imulation volume is saved in 29 \u2018snapshot\u2019 outputs between z = 20 nd z = 0, which match the output times adopted by the main EAGLE imulation suite. To more finely sample the evolution of our candidate alaxy o v er the course of this merger, we perform a final simulation or each set of initial conditions, outputting 600 snapshots o v er he time interval t = 1.74 \u22128.35 Gyr ( z = 3.600 \u22120.533), affording\n10 Myr time-resolution. We hencefore refer to these simulations s \u2018high cadence\u2019. These simulations were performed with different eeds to their nine more coarsely-sampled counterparts, such that we id not cherry-pick one particular simulation to examine in detail.\n.3 Identifying and tracking haloes and galaxies through time\naloes are tracked on the fly in the EAGLE simulations by applying he friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm to the dark matter distribution with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation), fter which gas, star, and BH particles are assigned to the FoF group f their nearest dark matter particle. We apply the SUBFIND algorithm Springel et al. 2001 ; Dolag et al. 2009 ) in post-processing in order o identify bound haloes, and use the analysis packages PYNBODY Pontzen et al. 2013 ) and TANGOS (Pontzen & Tremmel 2018 ) to rack them through time and calculate their properties.\nFor each simulation, we use TANGOS to link haloes to their immeiate progenitors and descendants based on the number of particles he y hav e in common, yielding a merger tree that allows any halo to e traced back to its progenitors. We identify the main branch of this ree in our fiducial ( ORGANIC ) simulation by computing the sum of the tellar masses along each possible branch, and selecting the branch ith the largest value. We then ensure that we reliably identify the RGANIC system\u2019s counterpart in our other simulations (evolved from enetically modified initial conditions and/or with different random umber seeds) by finding the halo at z = 5 that has the greatest umber of particles in common with the ORGANIC system, and tracing ts descendants forwards through time. Since the descendant of a halo s unambiguous, this ensures that we are comparing the same system etween different simulations at a given time.\nThroughout this work, we calculate the properties of haloes (such s the halo mass, M 200 , and the CGM mass fraction, f CGM ) within radius, r 200 , that encloses a mean density equal to 200 times the ritical density, centred on the halo centre of mass as determined by YNBODY using the shrinking-sphere method (Power et al. 2003 ). alaxy properties, such as the specific star formation rate, are alculated within a 30 pkpc aperture about the centre of mass. We uantify rotational kinematics within spherical apertures using the raction of kinetic energy that is invested in co-rotational motion,\nco = 1 K \u2211 i,L z ,i > 0 1 2 m i\n( L z ,i\nm i R i\n)2 , (3)\nhere m i are the masses of particles within the aperture, L z, i are their ngular momenta projected along the rotation axis (the direction f the total angular momentum vector), and R i are their 2D radial istances from the centre in the plane of the rotation axis.

We calculate this diagnostic using the ublicly available routines of Thob et al.

Our aim is to determine whether this hange to the halo mass accretion history induces strong differences n the growth of the galaxy\u2019s SMBH, and leads to a different evolution n the properties of the CGM and galaxy.\n.1 Mass assembly and merger histories\ne first e v aluate the halo and stellar mass accretion histories of the alaxies to verify that they attain approximately equal present-day asses and to examine the behaviour of the target merger. In Fig. 1 , e show, as a function of time, the halo mass ( M 200 ( t ), upper panel) nd stellar mass ( M ( t ), lower panel) of our galaxies. To quantify he uncertainty in these histories that arises from stochasticity in he EAGLE model, we show the results of nine re-simulations of ach set of initial conditions, each performed with a different seed or the quasi-random number generator. The median value of the -axis quantity is shown as a function of time with solid lines, and he distribution arising from the nine re-simulations is shown with rogressively lighter shading between the pairs of seeds that give ncreasingly divergent results from the median. We note therefore hat any given line does not show the evolution of one particular ystem, but that the solid lines and shading give the median and istribution of values at a given epoch. Throughout this study, we uantify the scatter at a given time with the interquartile range (IQR); he difference between the third and seventh values in a rank-ordered et of nine values gives a good approximation for this statistic.\nTo highlight the times at which our target merger takes place for hese simulations, we use the high-cadence simulations to identify hen the final coalescence of the galaxies takes place, and highlight his time on Fig. 1 with vertical lines of the appropriate colour for ach set of initial conditions. We also use these high-cadence outputs o compute the stellar mass ratio, \u03bc, at the time when the stellar mass f the infalling galaxy is maximal, to account for any stellar mass xchange between the galaxies during close encounters.\nAs noted in Section 2.2 , the target merger for the ORGANIC galaxy as a mass ratio \u03bc = 0.17; this merger occurs at t = 7.09 Gyr. As result of our genetic modifications, in the ENHANCED simulations he galaxy experiences a major merger, with a mass ratio \u03bc = 0.38. ince the infalling system is more massive than in the ORGANIC ase, this merger happens at an earlier time, at t = 5.73 Gyr. In ontrast, the infalling galaxy never merges with the main galaxy in the UPPRESSED case, and remains a separate object until z = 0, at which ime \u03bc= 0.03. When the host haloes of the progenitor galaxies merge, he infalling galaxy enters the primary halo on a highly tangential rbit, and dynamical friction is insufficient to bring the galaxy to he halo centre. While other very minor mergers occur during the volution of the SUPPRESSED system, the disruptive effect of the target erger has been entirely remo v ed through genetic modification. The aim of our genetic modifications is to adjust how significantly he galaxy is disrupted by the target merger; this is not solely etermined by the stellar mass ratio of the participating systems,\nut also by the geometry of the merger. Zeng, Wang & Gao ( 2021 ) howed that star-forming discs in IllustrisTNG can survive even ajor mergers if the infalling system \u2018spirals-in\u2019 on a near-tangential rbit, while head-on collisions are far more likely to strongly disrupt he disc and yield an elliptical remnant. We find that increasing the\nass of the infalling system in the ENHANCED case causes a more iolent, head-on collision; the first interaction of the galaxies has n impact parameter r impact = 0.09 r 200 , while in the ORGANIC case impact = 0.23 r 200 . The closest the infalling system ever comes to the ain galaxy in the SUPPRESSED case is r impact = 0.75 r 200 . The more isruptive nature of the tar get mer ger in the ENHANCED simulations an therefore be attributed to both an increased stellar mass ratio and more head-on collision.\nBy construction, the three sets of initial conditions produce resent-day haloes of approximately equal mass; the ORGANIC , NHANCED, and SUPPRESSED haloes have masses M 200 = 10 12.51 , 0 12.44 , and 10 12.51 M , respectively (IQR = 0.02, 0.03, 0.01 dex). he final halo masses of the ORGANIC and SUPPRESSED haloes are onsistent, while that of the ENHANCED halo is slightly lower; we iscuss the reason for this in Section 3.2 .

Dotted lines show the evolution of a \u2018high-cadence\u2019 simulation for each set of initial conditions, performed with a unique random number seed and 10 Myr output time resolution. While the three systems exhibit similar star formation histories, adjusting the merger ratio significantly alters the BH growth history; an enhanced merger is followed by rapid BH growth and a more massive BH by z = 0, while suppressing the merger yields less integrated growth.\ns w w a t g t o\nt A t b c ( t a ( e s c t\no m M f T d fi t\ns m 4 E c f h s m r s e h fi s\n3\nW o f t o d\nm t c t M t m ( t c m t i m c\ns o o e s M s t A t i\nt f o t t s f a c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\nimulation, the halo mass histories track each other closely, but ith a notable difference occurring at t = 4.93 Gyr ( z = 1.26), here the halo masses increase far more rapidly for the ORGANIC nd ENHANCED haloes than for the SUPPRESSED halo. This is the ime at which the haloes of our primary galaxy and the infalling alaxy merge. Our genetic modification experiment is therefore able o control the significance of an individual merger while inducing nly very small changes to the overall halo mass accretion history. In the EAGLE model, SMBHs are expected to grow very little until heir host halo reaches a redshift-dependent critical mass, M crit ( z). t this mass, the characteristic entropy of the CGM becomes greater han that of outflo ws dri ven by stellar feedback, which cease to e buoyant within the halo; this ef fecti vely confines gas within the entral galaxy and causes the BH to enter a \u2018rapid growth phase\u2019 Bower et al. 2017 ; McAlpine et al. 2018 ). Haloes of the same mass hat have different mass assembly histories will cross this threshold t different times, causing large differences in the BH growth history see Davies et al. 2021 ); this is a variation that we must a v oid in our xperiment, as we w ould lik e to isolate the influence of a merger. We how M crit ( z) as a dashed black line on the upper panel of Fig. 1 , and onfirm that the ORGANIC halo and its GM counterparts all cross this hreshold at the same time (to an accuracy of < 500 Myr).\nIn the lower panel of Fig. 1 , we show the stellar mass evolution of ur galaxy and its modified variants. By the present day, the stellar asses of the galaxies are not significantly dif ferent, with v alues of = 10 10.74 , 10 10.63 , and 10 10.71 M (IQR = 0.01, 0.16, 0.06 dex) or the ORGANIC , ENHANCED , and SUPPRESSED variants, respectively. he stellar mass histories are similar in each case, with significant ifferences only arising at two points in the system\u2019s evolution. The rst, at t \u223c 4 Gyr, occurs because our modifications slightly alter he timing of a major ( \u03bc \u2248 0.5) merger that occurs early in the\nNRAS 515, 1430\u20131443 (2022)\nystem\u2019s evolution. The high-cadence simulations reveal that this erger is complete by t = 3.8 Gyr in the ORGANIC case, but later ( t = .2 Gyr) in the SUPPRESSED case and later still ( t = 4.5 Gyr) in the NHANCED case. Small differences such as these are an una v oidable onsequence of maintaining consistency with the CDM correlation unction; we will show in later sections that the timing of this merger as a negligible effect on how the SMBH affects the CGM. The econd and most notable differences occur at the time of the target erger; the stellar masses of the ENHANCED and ORGANIC galaxies ise rapidly between snapshot outputs as a result of the addition of tars formed ex situ . The SUPPRESSED galaxy does not gain such an x situ contrib ution to its stellar mass since the galaxies never merge; o we ver, this is compensated for by in situ star formation so that the nal stellar masses at z = 0 are comparable, despite widely differing tar formation rates.\n.2 BH growth and evolution of the CGM mass fraction\ne now examine how adjusting the merger ratio affects the evolution f the SMBH and its effect on the CGM. Fig. 2 shows, in the same ashion as Fig. 1 , the evolution of the central SMBH mass, M BH , for he ORGANIC , ENHANCED , and SUPPRESSED galaxies. The evolution f M BH is also o v erlaid for the three high-cadence simulations with otted lines. While the halo and stellar mass histories of our galaxy are only ildly affected by our modifications, enhancing or suppressing the ar get mer ger induces dramatic dif ferences in the gro wth of the entral SMBH. The ORGANIC BH grows steadily throughout the ar get mer ger event, and attains a median final mass M BH = 10 7.9 (IQR = 0.1 dex). The ENHANCED BH initially has a lower mass han its ORGANIC counterpart, but grows very rapidly following the erger and attains a greater median final mass M BH = 10 8.2 M IQR = 0.2 dex). The BH in the SUPPRESSED galaxy, for which the ar get mer ger does not occur, grows at a slower rate than its ORGANIC ounterpart from t \u2248 6 Gyr onwards, and attains a lower median final ass of 10 7.5 M (IQR = 0.2 dex). We note that differences in the iming of the earlier merger at t \u2248 4 Gyr causes minor variations n the subsequent evolution of M BH , as was the case for the stellar\nass (Section 3.1 ). Ho we ver, these dif ferences are very small in omparison to those induced by the target merger.\nThe BH growth histories exhibit significantly more stochastic catter than the halo and stellar mass histories. The growth rate f the BH depends on the availability of gas, which in part depends n both the conversion rate of gas into stars and on the injection of nergy by stellar and AGN feedback, processes that are implemented tochastically in the EAGLE model. The deterministic changes to BH in response to our adjustment of the target merger are, ho we ver, ignificantly larger than this scatter. We have therefore demonstrated hat merger events can modulate the total energy injected through GN feedback (which is proportional to the total mass accreted on o the BH), and change how rapidly large fractions of that energy are njected into the system.\nThe energy injected by AGN feedback can drive strong changes in he gas content of the CGM, which we quantify with the CGM mass raction, f CGM . In the upper panel of Fig. 3 , we show the evolution f f CGM , normalized to the cosmic baryon fraction, b / 0 , for our hree families of simulations in the same fashion as Fig. 2 . Prior o the enhanced tar get mer ger, the CGM mass fractions of all three ystems are approximately equal at f CGM \u2248 0.50, but then diverge rom this value. Since we have confirmed that the three systems form pproximately equal stellar masses, these differences in the CGM ontent must be due to the expulsion of baryons from the halo (and,\nFigure 3. Upper panel: Evolution of the CGM mass fraction, f CGM ( t ), for the ORGANIC , ENHANCED , and SUPPRESSED simulations, shown in the same fashion as Fig. 2 . Lower panel: Solid lines and shading indicate the evolution of the halo baryon fraction, f b ( t ) in complementary simulations without AGN feedback, and dashed lines indicate the median f b ( t ) in simulations with AGN feedback. Both f CGM ( t ) and f b ( t ) are normalized by the cosmic average baryon fraction, b / 0 . Relative to the ORGANIC system, the rapid growth of a more massive BH in the ENHANCED system depletes the CGM of a greater fraction of its baryons, while the steadier growth of a lower-mass BH in the SUPPRESSED system leads to the expulsion of fewer baryons. In the absence of AGN feedback, the halo is not depleted of baryons in any simulation.\na a f\ni E t r m a 0 s u a o r e r a\nt s\ns e a i f i s c i f m\no f a A ( r c o A F a r a f r 8 E\nm e a E a A s o g a ( e t w g o t o\n3\nW g i F i a fi\nt g m\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\ndditionally, the prevention of baryons from entering the halo) and re not the result of differences in how much of the CGM cools and orms stars. The differences in the evolution of f CGM reflect the differences n the BH growth history for our three systems; the CGM in the NHANCED system is depleted of a larger fraction of its baryons han the CGM in the ORGANIC system, while the SUPPRESSED system etains a greater fraction of its CGM mass. The z = 0 median CGM ass fractions are significantly different for the three systems; they\nre f CGM = 0.48 ( SUPPRESSED , IQR = 0.11), 0.31 ( ORGANIC , IQR = .05), and 0.12 ( ENHANCED , IQR = 0.07). The distributions of f CGM ( t ) how that the stochastic variations in M BH ( t ) correspond to large ncertainty in the CGM mass fraction; ho we ver, the distributions re distinctly different after the median values diverge, with some v erlap between only the most extreme values for each system. The eduction of f CGM in the ENHANCED system is the reason why its halo xhibits a slightly lower final halo mass (Fig. 1 ); gas expulsion at high edshift both reduces the halo gas mass and suppresses the long-term ccretion of baryons on to the halo (e.g. Wright et al. 2020 ).\nIn the ENHANCED system, the rapid BH growth induced by the arget (major) merger triggers the expulsion of gas from the CGM, ince f CGM is approximately constant prior to the merger, but declines\na\nharply immediately after the galaxies coalesce. In comparison, the volution of f CGM ( t ) and M BH ( t ) for the ORGANIC system suggest that less significant target merger has little effect; when it occurs f CGM s already declining steadily, and this decline does not accelerate ollo wing the merger. Ho we ver, prior to the tar get mer ger its BH s significantly more massive than its counterpart in the SUPPRESSED ystem, for which the merger is absent, indicating that a minor merger an dri ve slo w enhancement of SMBH gro wth long before the merger s completed. As a result of this difference, f CGM declines gradually or the ORGANIC system, but remains constant in the absence of a erger in the SUPPRESSED system. To confirm that adjusting the merger ratio changes the evolution f f CGM because of differences in the expulsion of gas by AGN eedback, we examine our simulations in which BHs are not seeded nd hence AGN feedback is absent. To isolate the e xpulsiv e effect of GN feedback, we examine the evolution of the halo baryon fraction f b \u2261 M b / M 200 , where M b is the total mass of all baryons within r 200 ) ather than the CGM mass fraction, since disabling AGN feedback an allow a larger fraction of the CGM to form stars. The evolution f f b ( t ) (normalized to the cosmic baryon fraction) in the absence of GN feedback is shown for our three systems in the lower panel of ig. 3 , and the median f b for simulations including AGN feedback re shown with dashed lines for comparison. Regardless of merger atio, the halo is not depleted of baryons following the target merger, nd f b increases as the halo potential deepens. The inclusion of AGN eedback expels a greater fraction of the halo baryons as the merger atio increases; with AGN feedback the SUPPRESSED halo retains 6 per cent of the baryons that it contains without AGN, while the NHANCED halo retains only 28 per cent.\nA Milky Way-like galaxy may experience several major or minor ergers o v er its lifetime, though the majority of these will occur at\narly times ( z 2, see e.g. Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2015 ). Mergers t such early times will likely not induce AGN-dri ven outflo ws in AGLE galaxies similar to our ORGANIC galaxy, since M 200 < M crit t these times (see Section 3.1 ) for typical halo assembly histories. ll three systems experience a major merger at t = 3.8 \u22124.2 Gyr, hortly after M crit is exceeded, and the difference in the timing f this merger (see Section 3.1 ) may explain why the BHs begin rowing at slightly different times (Fig. 2 ). However, the CGM ppears insensitive to these early differences in the BH\u2019s growth Fig. 3 ) because the BH mass is low, and therefore so is the AGN nergy injection rate ( \u0307E AGN \u221d m\u0307 accr \u221d M 2 BH , see Section 2.1 ). The ar get mer ger is the only significant merger (i.e. \u03bc > 0.1) that occurs hen sufficiently high-energy injection rates can be reached to expel as from the CGM. By systematically adjusting the stellar mass ratio f this merger, we can show clearly that a disruptive merger can lead o strong CGM expulsion, while preventing a disruptive event from ccurring can inhibit the growth of the BH.\n.3 Effect of mergers on the BH accretion history\ne ne xt e xplore why adjusting the mass ratio of a merger impacts the rowth of the central BH by studying the evolution of the gas in the ts vicinity using the high-cadence simulations. The dotted lines on igs 2 and 3 show that the evolution of M BH and f CGM for the galaxies n these simulations falls within the scatter induced by stochasticity, nd that these simulations are consistent with those adopting our ducial output frequency. In Fig. 4 , we show the evolution of several properties of the gas in he vicinity of the BH for the ORGANIC , ENHANCED, and SUPPRESSED alaxies o v er the interval t = 5 \u22128 Gyr, during which the target ergers occur, as indicated by vertical dotted lines.

We focus on the time period o v er which the tar get mer gers occur, which are highlighted with vertical dotted lines. The enhanced merger is followed by a period of very rapid BH accretion, because the gas loses rotational support and collapses to the galaxy centre, greatly increasing the density around the BH. The less significant merger experienced by the ORGANIC galaxy does not remo v e this rotational support, and no such rapid BH accretion occurs.\nr r m i d t k B ( s s a t t k\nr s B t\ng g t t o t s a \u2248 t o T r A\no r i a b a p\ng w v m \u03c1 i t p o d c\nm ( c w a s i t r i a\ns t w s b i c w h w c p s\ng\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\nadius 3 pkpc about the position of the BH, which we consider to be epresentative of the galaxy scale gas distribution; the total gas mass, gas , and the fraction of the kinetic energy of the gas that is invested n co-rotational motion, \u03baco, gas , calculated using equation ( 3 ). We o not show results when there are fewer than 10 particles within his aperture. In panel (c), we show the density \u03c1 within the BH ernel, which is used in the calculation of the accretion rate of the H, m\u0307 accr (see Section 2.1 ). The evolution of m\u0307 accr is shown in panel\nd); since it varies significantly o v er short time-scales, for clarity we mooth it with a Gaussian kernel of standard deviation 40 Myr and how the result with solid lines, whilst showing the instantaneous ccretion rate with thinner, fainter lines. Through examination of hese quantities, we can investigate how changes to the properties of he larger-scale gas distribution affect the conditions within the BH ernel and modulate the BH accretion rate.\nWe focus first on the ENHANCED galaxy, in which the BH grows apidly following the merger. Panel (a) shows that m gas does not ignificantly increase at the time of the merger, indicating that rapid H growth does not occur because a large supply of gas is introduced o the central region of the galaxy. Ho we ver, the kinematics of the\nNRAS 515, 1430\u20131443 (2022)\nas already present within 3 pkpc of the BH are transformed by the ravitational effects of the merger, as shown by the sharp decline in he \u03baco, gas diagnostic in panel (b). Prior to the merger (at t = 5.5 Gyr), he gas forms a near-perfectly co-rotating disc, with \u2248 90 per cent f its kinetic energy invested in co-rotation, but this fraction drops o \u224820 per cent after the merger takes place. Now lacking rotational upport, the gas on \u2018galaxy scales\u2019 flows to the centre of the galaxy nd towards the smoothing kernel of the BH, which has a radius h BH\n0.1 \u22120.2 pkpc o v er the course of the merger. As seen in panel (c), he smoothed gas density within the kernel increases sharply as this ccurs (by a factor of \u224815) and remains ele v ated until t = 5.9 Gyr. his increase causes a commensurate increase in the BH accretion ate, as shown in panel (d), initiating the expulsion of the CGM by GN feedback. Following the merger, the majority of the gas mass in the vicinity f the BH is either accreted or ejected through AGN feedback, and apid accretion on to the BH ends when \u03c1 sharply declines to below ts pre-merger value. After this time, the \u03baco, gas diagnostic indicates turbulent spheroid of gas with little rotational support. Several very rief periods of high m\u0307 accr occur while the galaxy is in this state, until final AGN feedback event at t \u223c 7 Gyr leaves the galaxy very gas oor. In the EAGLE model, the accretion rate is also modulated by the as vorticity within the BH kernel, V \u03c6 / c s (see Section 2.1 ). Ho we ver, e find that unlike the rotational motion of gas on larger scales, the orticity within the BH kernel is not significantly affected by the erger. The BH accretion rate is therefore responding to a change in within the kernel and not to a change in the gas vorticity. This result s important for the generalization of our findings, as it demonstrates hat they do not originate from the specifics of EAGLE\u2019s BH growth rescription. Instead, the rapid accretion on to the BH occurs because f the disruption of gas on the scale of the resolved galaxy disc, riving high densities at the galactic centre. This process is likely ommon to cosmological simulations performed with other models.\nWe illustrate this sequence of events in Fig. 5 , in which we show aps of the stellar surface density ( , upper row) and gas velocity lo wer ro w) in the ENHANCED galaxy at four output times o v er the ourse of the merger. Streamlines in the lower row show the masseighted mean gas velocity in a 1 pkpc deep slice, and their colours nd widths indicate the magnitude of this velocity, | v gas | .

All panels are centred on he location of the SMBH (indicated with a grey cross in the lower ow), and are aligned consistently such that the galaxy disc in the first mage (i.e. at t = 5.28 Gyr) is viewed face-on. We indicate a spherical perture of radius 3 pkpc about the SMBH with a dashed line.\nPrior to the merger (first column, at t = 5.28 Gyr) the galaxy is a tar-forming disc in which gas is co-rotating, with little to no inflow owards the BH. The galaxy then experiences a close interaction ith the infalling system (with r impact = 2.7 kpc); the second column hows the pair of galaxies 10 Myr after this interaction, revealing that oth the stellar disc of the main galaxy and the motion of gas within t are strongly disrupted. The galaxies merge 100 Myr later; the third olumn shows the system immediately after this happens. The gas ithin 3 pkpc of the BH is now predominantly f alling inw ards at igh velocity, fuelling BH growth and giving rise to AGN feedback, hich drives outflows from the remnant galaxy as seen in the fourth olumn. We show the magnitude of the gas velocities for illustrative urposes, and refer the reader to Mitchell et al.

Critically, ho we ver, the co-rotational motion f the gas in the ORGANIC galaxy is not disrupted by this more entle merger. Within the 3 pkpc aperture, \u03baco, gas is characteristic of ear-perfect co-rotational motion prior to the merger, briefly dips as he galaxies coalesce, then quickly returns to its pre-merger value. here is therefore no sudden inflow of gas towards the BH, and no ignificant increase in \u03c1 or the accretion rate. The BH in the ORGANIC alaxy grows steadily o v er the course of the merger, and as shown by ig. 3 , the AGN feedback associated with this growth is less efficient t removing baryons from the CGM than the intense, brief episodes f feedback experienced by the ENHANCED galaxy. The tar get mer ger in the ORGANIC system does appear to cause ubtle, long-term effects that are revealed through comparison with he SUPPRESSED system, for which the target merger never occurs. oth systems host co-rotating discs of gas o v er the time period\nhown in Fig. 4 , with similar \u03baco, gas ; however, there is more gas resent within the inner 3 pkpc of the ORGANIC system. The tidal orces e x erted on the main galaxy by the merging system, as it falls o the centre of the halo may cause gas to migrate to the centre of he galaxy, yielding a higher m gas in the inner 3 pkpc than is found n the absence of any merging activity. Note that this is a far more radual and subtle effect than the sudden collapse of gas towards he BH seen in the ENHANCED galaxy. This larger reservoir of gas llows the ORGANIC BH to accrete more gas (and hence, inject more eedback energy) o v er the lifetime of the system. It therefore forms\nt\nmore massive BH and ejects more gas from the CGM (Figs 2 and ), than its counterpart in the SUPPRESSED galaxy. It appears that mergers can unlock the AGN-driven expulsion of\nhe CGM. The small increase in m gas following the enhanced merger ndicates that the gas required to drive a strong outflow was already resent in the vicinity of the BH, but could not be accreted due to its igh angular momentum. The disrupti ve ef fects of a merger can bring his gas close to the BH, and this can happen very rapidly following a isruptive merger, or more gradually as a result of tidal interactions. e note that as shown in Fig. 3 , f CGM continues to fall many Gyr fter the merger unlocks the AGN in the ENHANCED galaxy, and M BH ontinues to slowly rise. This likely occurs because the turbulent emnant galaxy is able to rapidly remo v e angular momentum from ny gas reaching the system, which will then accrete on to the BH ather than forming stars (see also Pontzen et al. 2017 ), driving ntermittent AGN feedback.\n.4 Influence of merger-induced AGN feedback on CGM ooling\naving established that the AGN feedback triggered by a disruptive erger is capable of ejecting a significant fraction of the CGM rom the halo, we now examine how the physical state of the emaining CGM is modified by this process.

Isocontours of constant radiative cooling (or, at low n H nd T , heating) time, obtained from the CLOUDY look-up tables mployed by the EAGLE model, are o v erlaid. F or simplicity, we ssume solar abundance ratios for the metallic elements but rescale he cooling function to the mean metallicity for each distribution ollowing Wiersma, Schaye & Smith ( 2009 , their equation 5).\nThe impact that the AGN feedback induced by a merger can have n the physical state of the CGM is evident from the distributions hown in Fig. 6 . The ENHANCED CGM has been significantly depleted f gas, and the majority of the mass that remains has been shifted to oth lower densities and slightly higher temperatures. As a result, the ooling time of the gas has been extended, as can be seen with refernce to the isocontours of constant cooling time. In the SUPPRESSED ystem, 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 M of gas can radiatively cool within a Hubble ime, t H , while only 5.7 \u00d7 10 9 M of gas in the ENHANCED system an do so. In our simulations in which AGN feedback is absent, the\nNRAS 515, 1430\u20131443 (2022)\nemperature\u2013density distribution of the gas is insensitive to the target erger, and resembles that of the SUPPRESSED system in Fig. 6 . In order to continue forming stars, central star-forming galaxies ust replenish their interstellar medium with gas from the CGM, nd this process will be inhibited in systems such as our ENHANCED alaxy where the CGM cooling time is ele v ated through expulsion. his is a form of pre ventati ve feedback, and has been identified in arlier statistical studies of simulated galaxy populations as a route to he quenching of star formation in central galaxies (e.g. Davies et al. 020 ; Zinger et al. 2020 ). The characteristic radiative cooling time of he CGM likely increases primarily due to the reduction in the density f the CGM (since the radiative cooling time t cool \u221d 1 /n 2 H ) with the ncrease in temperature being a secondary effect (as t cool \u221d 1/ T ). The hift in the density seen in Fig. 6 is substantially greater than the shift n temperature, in agreement with the findings of Davies et al. ( 2021 ), here we showed that in the EA GLE model, A GN feedback does ot strongly alter the CGM temperature profile, but reconfigures the GM at a lower density without affecting the shape of the density rofile. Here, we have shown that this can be achieved by increasing he significance of an individual merger.\n.5 Ho w mer ger-dri v en CGM transformation affects the galaxy\ne conclude our study by examining how the transformation of the aryon cycle following a disruptive merger affects the star formation istory (SFH) and kinematics of the central galaxy. We quantify he SFH by calculating the evolution of the specific star formation ate, sSFR = M\u0307 /M , inte grated o v er the preceding 300 Myr at each utput time. 2 We quantify the kinematics of the system with the cootational kinetic energy fraction, \u03baco, , of the stellar component of he galaxy. We show the time evolution of these quantities in Figs 7 nd 8 in the same fashion as Fig. 3 , imposing a minimum sSFR of 0 \u221213 yr \u22121 for clarity. In Fig. 7 , we also show the location of the green valley as a unction of time for galaxies of a comparable stellar mass in the argest EAGLE simulation volume (Ref-L100N1504, Schaye et al. 015 ; Crain et al. 2015 ). To obtain this at each output time, we use the ublicly-available EAGLE galaxy catalogues (McAlpine et al. 2016 ) o find the sSFR of all galaxies in a 0.2 dex-wide window about the urrent stellar mass of the ORGANIC galaxy. Following Wright et al. 2019 ), we then take the locus of the star-forming main sequence o be the mean sSFR of these galaxies, subject to a threshold log 10 sSFR/yr \u22121 ) > \u221211 + 0.5 z, and define the green valley to lie within per cent and 50 per cent of this value.\n.5.1 Star formation activity\nhe upper panel of Fig. 7 shows that adjustment of the target merger atio leads to significant changes in the SFH of the galaxy. The SFHs f the ENHANCED and ORGANIC galaxies diverge from that of the UPPRESSED galaxy when their target mergers occur. The SUPPRESSED alaxy remains on the star-forming main sequence until z = 0, with final median sSFR of 10 \u221210.14 yr \u22121 (IQR = 0.10). Following the erger, the median sSFR of the ORGANIC galaxy falls \u223c0.3 dex elow that of the SUPPRESSED galaxy, and its final median sSFR f = 10 \u221210.55 yr \u22121 (IQR = 0.22) is indicative of a galaxy moving nto the green valley. The more disruptive merger experienced by the NHANCED galaxy has a more dramatic impact on its SFH; the median\ns a d m t g g d W n g\nc t t a a c a \u2018 i g f q t\nFigure 8.

Adjusting the merger ratio also transforms the kinematics and morphology of the disclike ORGANIC galaxy; an enhanced merger yields a dispersion-dominated spheroidal galaxy instead, while a suppressed merger yields a more strongly co-rotating disc. The presence of AGN feedback does not appear to strongly influence the kinematics of the ORGANIC and SUPPRESSED galaxies; ho we ver, the ENHANCED galaxy is able to \u2018rebuild\u2019 its disc to a greater degree when no AGN feedback is present to prevent cooling from the CGM.\nf t o h\nf r g i a t s T e m r m t h i o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\nSFR is briefly enhanced relative to the other systems immediately fter the merger, likely due to a short-lived increase in the central gas ensity, but then falls rapidly into the green valley as the interstellar edium is ejected by AGN feedback. The median sSFR remains in he green valley for \u22483 Gyr before falling below it, indicating that the alaxy is quenched until z = 0. The SFHs in resimulations of these alaxies without AGN feedback, shown in the lower panel of Fig. 7 , emonstrate that AGN feedback is responsible for these differences. hen no BHs are seeded in the galaxies, the enhanced merger does ot lead to quenching, and the SFHs and final sSFRs of all three alaxies remain similar.\nWhile the quenching of the ENHANCED galaxy is undoubtedly aused by the merger that it experiences, it is important to note hat in the short term, the AGN feedback induced by the merger is ypically only sufficient to drive the galaxy into the green valley, nd not to quench it entirely. The galaxy continues forming stars t a slower rate with its remaining interstellar gas, though the sSFR ontinues to decline because the baryon cycle has been fundamentally ltered by AGN feedback as discussed in the previous section. The refuelling\u2019 of the galaxy is inhibited because very little gas remains n the CGM that can cool efficiently. Once the remaining interstellar as is consumed by star formation and/or BH growth, or ejected by eedback, the galaxy leaves the green valley, quenches, and remains uiescent o v er long timescales. The time a post-merger galaxy takes o pass through the green valley in this way is likely sensitive to many\nactors, though the evolution of the ENHANCED system here indicates hat quenching can be causally connected to a merger event that ccurred several Gyr earlier, because of the impact that the merger ad on the CGM and baryon cycle.\nAs shown in Figs 2 and 3 , considerable scatter exists in M BH and CGM between simulations of the same initial conditions with different andom number seeds. This scatter propagates into the sSFR of the alaxy and is compounded by the fact that star formation itself is mplemented stochastically in these simulations. For the SUPPRESSED nd ORGANIC galaxies, the SFHs of most realizations lie close to he median and indicate present-day star-forming galaxies, though a mall number indicate green valley or quenched galaxies at z = 0. he scatter in the ENHANCED galaxy\u2019s SFH indicates that stochastic ffects alone generate a broad range of timescales o v er which a posterger galaxy can pass through the green valley and quench; some ealizations pass through the green valley within \u2248700 Myr of the erger and remain quenched, while others take o v er 4 Gyr to leave he main sequence and enter the green valley. The distributions shown ere demonstrate the importance of accounting for stochastic effects n simulations of individual galaxies. Producing many realizations f each galaxy reveals that the SFHs are distinctly different, but\nMNRAS 515, 1430\u20131443 (2022)\nM\ne i\n3\nT a a f O w b S d t y t s c h m f k t\ni s g v b l m m e p\nk w F i t g c a c t i f a\n4\nI t M b\n3\ns s\n= M a e s a e 2 2 E r k s a c o\no p m i u 0 e a o o i o\ng C l d p d M f m t O t\ni t t h t f c c g C n ( c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\nxamining only a single realization of each galaxy could lead to nsecure conclusions.\n.5.2 Stellar kinematics\nhe evolution of \u03baco, , shown in the upper panel of Fig. 8 reveals that djusting the significance of an individual merger can significantly lter the kinematics of a disc galaxy. At early times, \u03baco, increases or all three systems as stars are formed from co-rotating gas. In the RGANIC and SUPPRESSED cases, the increase in \u03baco, slows at z \u223c 1, hen \u03baco, = 0.66 (IQR = 0.13) and 0.63 (IQR = 0.04), respectively, oth high values characteristic of a star-forming disc galaxy. 3 The UPPRESSED galaxy experiences no significant mergers capable of isrupting this rotational motion, and \u03baco, increases steadily for his system until t = 12.5 Gyr, after which a mild decline occurs, ielding a present-day \u03baco, = 0.57 (IQR = 0.10). The minor merger hat occurs for the ORGANIC galaxy has a disruptive influence on its tellar kinematics, causing a decline in \u03baco, , though it remains a o-rotating disc galaxy by z = 0 ( \u03baco, = 0.44, IQR = 0.05). The ead-on major merger experienced by the ENHANCED galaxy has a far ore disruptive effect on its stellar kinematics, with the median \u03baco, alling below 0.4 immediately after the merger. The remnant retains inematics characteristic of an elliptical (or spheroidal) galaxy until he present day, with a final \u03baco, = 0.30 (IQR = 0.12).\nA strong correlation between \u03baco, and f CGM has been previously dentified within the present-day galaxy populations of cosmological imulations (Davies et al. 2020 ), indicating that high- \u03baco, disc alaxies are more likely to reside within gas-rich haloes and vice ersa. The results of this study suggest that this correlation could e driven by mergers; galaxies that experience strong mergers are ikely to exhibit dispersion-dominated kinematics and spheroidal\norphologies for dynamical reasons, and our results here show that ergers can trigger AGN feedback, reducing f CGM . Ho we ver, the xtent to which the galaxy kinematics are directly affected by the roperties of the CGM remain unclear. We can assess the role of the CGM in determining a galaxy\u2019s inematics by comparing the evolution of the ENHANCED galaxy ith and without AGN feedback, as shown in the lower panel of ig. 8 . The galaxy is disrupted by a merger in both cases; ho we ver, n the absence of AGN feedback the CGM remains gas rich and able o cool. The galaxy therefore continues to form stars from CGM as that has coherent angular momentum, thus \u2018rebuilding\u2019 the disc, ausing \u03baco, to rise and eventually yield a value representative of disc galaxy. The origin of the \u03baco, \u2212 f CGM correlations found in osmological simulations is therefore complex; mergers can disrupt he galaxy and trigger an AGN-driven reduction in f CGM , and galaxies n gas-poor haloes are less readily able to gain angular momentum rom the CGM. We defer a detailed analysis of the origin of galaxy ngular momentum to a future study.\nSUMMARY A N D DISCUSSION\nn this study, we have investigated the impact of a galaxy merger on he interaction between AGN feedback and the CGM of a simulated\nilky W ay-like galaxy. W e then examined the consequences for the aryon cycle and the evolution of the galaxy.\nNRAS 515, 1430\u20131443 (2022)\nA threshold value of \u03baco, = 0.4 has been shown to clearly distinguish tar-forming disc galaxies from quenched elliptical galaxies in the EAGLE imulations (Correa et al. 2017 ).\na s c\nE\nTo do so, we selected a present-day moderately star-forming (sSFR 10 \u221210.2 yr \u22121 ) central galaxy, with stellar mass M = 4.3 \u00d7 10 10 and host halo mass M 200 = 3.4 \u00d7 10 12 M from a simulation of periodic volume evolved with the Reference EAGLE model (Crain t al. 2015 ; Schaye et al. 2015 ) and used zoom initial conditions to reimulate the galaxy and its environment at 8 \u00d7 higher mass resolution, dopting EAGLE\u2019s recalibrated subgrid parameter values. We then mployed the genetic modification (GM) technique (Roth et al. 016 ), using the initial conditions generator GENETIC (Stopyra et al. 021 ), to generate two modified variants of our initial conditions, NHANCED and SUPPRESSED , designed to respectively increase or educe the disruptive influence of a z \u2248 0.74 \u2018target\u2019 merger, whilst eeping the o v erall halo mass history from the fiducial ( ORGANIC ) imulation intact. These modified variants of a single galaxy form controlled experiment, through which we can establish causal onnections between the impact of a galaxy merger and the evolution f the system. The genetic modifications affect both the stellar mass ratio, \u03bc, f the target merger, and its geometry, quantified by the impact arameter, r impact , of the first close interaction. In the ORGANIC case, a inor merger occurs, with \u03bc = 0.17 and r impact = 0.23 r 200 , where r 200 s the halo\u2019s virial radius. In the ENHANCED case, the galaxy instead ndergoes a more head-on, major merger, with \u03bc = 0.38 and r impact = .09 r 200 . Conversely, in the SUPPRESSED case the infalling galaxy nters the primary halo on a tangential orbit, with r impact = 0.75 r 200 nd does not merge with the central galaxy, remaining a separate bject at z = 0 with \u03bc = 0.03. This ef fecti v ely remo v es the effect f the target merger. These modifications to the characteristics of an ndividual merger can be achieved without significantly changing the v erall accretion history or final mass of the galaxy\u2019s halo (Fig. 1 ). Enhancing the significance of a merger can trigger very rapid rowth of the central BH and yield a greater final BH mass. onversely, suppressing a merger reduces the BH accretion rate o v er ong time-scales, yielding a lower final BH mass (Fig. 2 ). These iffering BH accretion histories give rise to significantly different resent-day CGM mass fractions; by inducing AGN feedback, a isruptive merger can cause a substantial fraction of the CGM of a ilky Way-like galaxy to be ejected (Fig. 3 ). The rapid BH growth ollowing the ENHANCED major merger occurs because the rotational otion of gas in the galaxy disc is disrupted, causing gas to collapse owards the centre, elevating the density within the BH kernel. The RGANIC minor merger is not able to disrupt the motion of gas around he BH, and this motion inhibits accretion on to the BH (Fig. 4 ). The expulsion of a large fraction of the CGM by AGN feedback n response to a merger causes a significant shift in the densityemperature distribution of the CGM. The gas remaining within he virial radius after a disruptive merger has a lower density and igher temperature than it does when no merger occurs, giving rise o longer cooling times that prevent the galaxy\u2019s interstellar medium rom being replenished by CGM gas (Fig. 6 ). This transformation auses the central galaxy to quench, after a delay of several Gyr orresponding to the timescale for the galaxy\u2019s remaining interstellar as to either form stars, fuel BH growth or be expelled by feedback. onversely, the more gas-rich CGM of the system that experiences o merger enables a higher sustained sSFR in the central galaxy Fig. 7 ). This transformation of the baryon cycle also impacts the entral galaxy kinematics; the ENHANCED galaxy is converted to dispersion-dominated spheroid by the merger, but it remains a pheroid until z = 0 because the disc cannot be rebuilt by gas with oherent angular momentum from the CGM (Fig. 8 ).\nThe significant increase in the BH accretion rate seen in the NHANCED galaxy, following a major merger is in line with the\nb M t m u g m s a t o g\nb u t i W M 2 c m m o g t w g C i d a\ns s q s g c n t B t k\ns m i a T i c I m m d t ( t g m r\nm i B a c c\nd s t e M T s a m e b B e g B 2\ni e\nb i m\ni t a c u\ni w o i e t t p a\ns e t e A b o a t l e a t s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\nehaviour of the wider population in the EAGLE simulations. cAlpine et al. ( 2020 ) found that galaxies hosting AGN are up to hree times more likely to be undergoing mergers than stellar massatched control galaxies without AGN and that merging galaxies are p to 1.8 times more likely to host an active AGN than non-merging alaxies. We find that the AGN feedback induced by a disruptive erger persists for a very short period of \u22480.2 Myr (Fig. 4 ); this hort time-scale offers an explanation for why it is so difficult to ssociate AGN feedback with mergers in large-volume simulations hat are necessarily limited in their output time resolution, and in bservations that can only capture an instantaneous snapshot of the alaxy population.\nWhile the intense AGN feedback induced by the merger is very rief, its effects on the evolution of the galaxy-CGM ecosystem nfold o v er long time-scales. Sev eral recent studies hav e shown hat when quenching follows a merger in cosmological simulations t typically does so after a time delay of up to several Gyr (e.g.\neinberger et al. 2018 ; Correa, Schaye & Trayford 2019 ; Rodr \u0301\u0131guez ontero et al. 2019 ; Quai et al. 2021 ; Pathak, Belli & Weinberger 021 ), leading to the notion that mergers and quenching are not ausally connected. In our ENHANCED galaxy, quenching occurs a edian \u22483 Gyr after the merger takes place (Fig. 7 ), yet these events ust be causally connected since by construction the parameters f this merger are the primary difference between this quenched alaxy and the star-forming ORGANIC galaxy. Our results show that he CGM can mediate this connection o v er such long time-scales; hile the feedback induced by the merger expels enough interstellar as to place the galaxy in the green valley, it is the ele v ation of the GM cooling time by this feedback that ultimately prevents further nflow and quenches the galaxy o v er a longer period. These highly isparate time-scales will make it challenging to associate mergers nd quenching in both observed and simulated galaxy populations.\nObservational indicators of past morphological transformation uch as the spin parameter ( \u03bb) and the ratio of ordered to disordered tellar velocity ( V / \u03c3 ) have been found to be poor predictors of uenching relative to the overall stellar velocity dispersion (Brownon et al. 2022 ). While we find that the kinematics of our ENHANCED alaxy are transformed by a merger, this takes several Gyr to omplete (Fig. 8 ) and it is not clear that such a transformation is ecessary for the galaxy to quench. The key action of the merger is o introduce a short-term local change to the motion of gas in the H vicinity (Fig. 4 ), and such brief disruptions may be sufficient o unlock rapid BH growth in galaxies without changing the global inematics of the stars and gas. This study was performed within the context of the EAGLE imulation model, and it is important to consider how our results ight differ if another model were used. The most critical difference s likely to be in how efficiently AGN feedback can impact the CGM s a function of the BH accretion rate, m\u0307 accr , and the BH mass, M BH . he EAGLE model implements AGN feedback with a single mode n which energy injection rate into the CGM scales with m\u0307 accr . In a ontrasting example, the two-mode AGN feedback employed by the llustrisTNG model can only expel gas from the CGM in a \u2018kinetic ode\u2019, which is active when the Eddington ratio is low and the BH ass is greater than \u224810 8.2 M (Terrazas et al. 2020 ). Despite these ifferences, the two models can yield similar correlations between he properties of galaxies and those of their gaseous environments e.g. Davies et al. 2020 ) because the key quantity for the CGM is the otal AGN feedback energy injected in a mode capable of expelling as. In EAGLE, the high accretion rate induced by the ENHANCED erger dri ves ef ficient feedback, but also increases the BH mass elative to the ORGANIC case, facilitating higher rates still (since\n\u02d9 accr \u221d M 2 BH ). It is possible that in a two-mode model akin to that n IllustrisTNG, the action of this rapid accretion is to increase the H mass until efficient kinetic feedback commences, thus achieving similar effect on the CGM but through a different route. A direct ode comparison would be required to determine whether this is the ase.\nWith our controlled study, we have shown for the first time how isrupti ve e vents such as galaxy mergers are capable of driving trong changes in the content and properties of the CGM through he AGN feedback the y induce. A ke y question remains: are such vents r equir ed for AGN feedback to significantly impact the CGM of ilky Way-like central galaxies, driving diversity in their properties? his study shows that the BH mass, CGM mass fraction and sSFR are ensitive to individual merger ev ents; howev er, these properties are lso strongly correlated with the intrinsic properties of the host dark atter halo (Davies et al. 2019 , 2020 , 2021 ). Haloes that assemble arlier at a given mass tend to host quenched, CGM-poor galaxies ecause they are quicker to reach the threshold mass at which Hs can grow at a non-linear rate (Bower et al. 2017 ; McAlpine t al. 2018 ), and because they are more concentrated and confine as at the halo centre more ef fecti vely, yielding a more massive H and the injection of more AGN feedback (Booth & Schaye 010 , 2011 ). There are two possible scenarios in which merger events and the ntrinsic properties of the dark matter halo can both influence the volution of the galaxy-CGM ecosystem:\n(i) Merger events are required for AGN feedback to transform the aryon cycle and quench galaxies, but the quiescent galaxies residing n early-assembling haloes have almost al w ays experienced such a erger. (ii) Merger events are not required, and early halo assembly alone s sufficient for enough BH growth and AGN feedback to transform he baryon cycle and quench galaxies. Galaxies residing in laterssembling haloes are typically star forming at the present day, but an end up quenched if they experience a disruptive merger and ndergo the process seen in our ENHANCED system.\nEstablishing which of these scenarios is correct will be challengng. Galaxies residing in haloes with differing assembly histories ill experience different merger histories as a natural consequence f hierarchical assembly, and many degenerate factors determine the mpact of a merger on a galaxy, such as the geometry (e.g. Zeng t al. 2021 ), mass ratio, gas richness, and redshift. Controlling for hese variables makes it difficult to assemble samples of galaxies hat have (or have not) experienced disruptive mergers in statistical opulations, or to construct a GM experiment in which the halo ssembly time is varied for a fixed merger history.\nTaken in isolation, the results of this study appear to fa v our cenario (i). Our haloes have near-identical assembly times and xceed the critical mass for non-linear BH growth at z \u2248 2, yet he SUPPRESSED system, which evolves secularly after this time, xperiences suppressed BH growth and very little CGM ejection. disruptive merger appears to be required for the baryon cycle to e transformed in this system. Our results reveal the importance f mergers in inducing BH growth in an EAGLE galaxy which lready hosts a massive BH; McAlpine et al. ( 2018 ) also note hat at low redshift, mergers can be important in initiating noninear growth of EAGLE BHs at or near the seed mass. Further vidence supporting scenario (i) exists in the present-day EAGLE nd IllustrisTNG populations; early-assembling, gas poor haloes ypically host spheroidal galaxies with low \u03baco, (Davies et al. 2020 ), uggesting that these systems may have experienced a disruptive\nMNRAS 515, 1430\u20131443 (2022)\nM\ne a i\ni r a i T g b u\nA\nW p S g E u a e p I a a p a T\nD\nT t\nR\nA\nB\nB B B B B B\nB\nB\nC\nC C C\n4\ne m 2\nC\nC C C C\nD D\nD\nD\nD D D D D\nE\nF F F F G H\nH\nH\nK K\nK\nM M M\nM\nM M M\nP P\nP P P\nP\nP\nQ\nR\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/1430/6615465 by Liverpool John M oores U niversity user on 17 O ctober 2022\nvent that unlocked the growth the BH in the past. 4 These correlations re relati vely mild, ho we ver, and there are many undisturbed systems n gas-poor haloes, lending some credence to scenario (ii).\nWhile the relative importance of mergers and disruptive events n driving diversity in the properties of the wider galaxy population emains unclear, we have shown in this study that they can profoundly ffect the galaxy\u2013CGM ecosystem when they occur, and that their mportance may be underestimated due to the time-scales involved. he small-scale, short-time-scale processes of gas disruption and BH rowth that they induce can drive a large-scale transformation of the aryon cycle, the consequences of which can take several Gyr to nfold and culminate in quenching.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the referee for their constructive suggestions that imro v ed this manuscript.
