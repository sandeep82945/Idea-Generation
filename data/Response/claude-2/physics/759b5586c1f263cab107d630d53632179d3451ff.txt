 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop new drug delivery systems for essential oils using click chemistry methods like CuAAC, SPAAC, etc. Test their ability to improve bioavailability and effectiveness of essential oils for treating symptoms of DMD.

2. Evaluate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and muscle-relaxing properties of specific essential oils like lavender, lemongrass, thyme, and coconut oil in animal models of DMD. Determine their impact on muscle regeneration and inflammation.

3. Explore the use of essential oil loaded nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels, etc. to provide sustained and targeted delivery of essential oils to skeletal and cardiac muscles affected in DMD. Assess their efficacy in preclinical studies.  

4. Investigate the potential of essential oil derivatives synthesized using click chemistry reactions as novel therapeutic agents for DMD. Screen them for pharmacological activity and drug-likeness.

5. Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of optimized essential oil formulations, either alone or as adjunct therapy, in improving muscle function, cardiac health, and quality of life in DMD patients. Assess their impact on delaying disease progression.
