Caudocranial hemorrhage extension through the subarachnoid space can predictably cause symptoms including headache, nuchal rigidity, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and impairment of consciousness.

Common iatrogenic causes include diagnostic or anesthetic (subarachnoid or extradural) lumbar puncture, and spinal surgery.

He was evaluated for possible acute cardiac pathology. His medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation for which he was anticoagulated, and he had recently had an artificial cardiac pacemaker implanted for treatment of sinus node dysfunction. He had known hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and several benign skin lesions had been excised previously. While in the emergency department, his back pain escalated in severity. He had a headache and was vomiting. He was investigated for possible aortic pathology with computed tomography (CT) and bedside sonography, but there was no evidence of this. He was treated with analgesia.\nHe subsequently developed numbness and weakness of the right lower limb. is was only detected after several hours had passed, at which time he was re-evaluated for\nneurological pathology. CT imaging of the brain and circle of Willis revealed no abnormality of note. He was attributed a presumptive diagnosis of a likely anterior or posterior circulation embolic stroke and was admitted to the care of the inpatient cardiology service, with a plan for continuing anticoagulation (rivaroxaban was ceased in favor of enoxaparin), antiplatelet therapy (aspirin), and non-urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Later that evening, he was reviewed for persisting abdominal and back pain. He had developed allodynia of the lower chest and abdomen and had begun to retain urine, necessitating catheterization.\nBy day 3 of admission, his right lower limb paresis had progressed to flaccid paralysis and sensory loss. Our patient subsequently developed paresis of his left lower limb and loss of anal tone. He could not feel the tug of his catheter. ere were no reflexes in his lower limbs, nor clonus. He could sense punctate stimuli but described the sensation as dull and paresthetic. He was finally referred to the inpatient neurosurgical service for consideration of spinal pathology.\nEmergent MRI of the entire spine and brain was performed. Two discrete foci of non-contiguous acute SIEH were discerned, approximately localized behind T1-2 and T10-11. ere was associated spinal cord displacement and acute spinal cord edema due to compression, at both sites of hemorrhage. Our patient\u2019s pre-operative radiology is depicted in Figure 1. Metastatic disease was suspected as the most likely underlying etiology, due to the multiplicity of the lesions. MRI of the brain showed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the dependent foramen magnum. is was favored to be migratory from a spinal origin. is radiology is depicted in Figure 2. Hematology advice was sought to reverse the effects of enoxaparin, and aspirin. CT pan scan with contrast did not reveal any underlying neoplastic, vascular, or other lesions that might account for the hemorrhages observed. Decompressive surgery was delayed further as enoxaparin had been administered in the morning of the 4th\u00a0 day, and there was concern of unacceptable intraoperative bleeding risk. Surgery was finally performed later that evening, specifically C7-T2 and T9-11 laminectomies. e dura was darkly colored at both foci of hemorrhage. ere were no extradural blood products. Durotomy was performed at each site and subdural and subarachnoid clots were discerned. e hematomas were removed in piecemeal fashion until pulsatile neural tissue was observed. No underlying culprit lesions were apparent intraoperatively. Onlay duraplasties with fibrin glue were performed and the wounds were closed in routine fashion.\nImmediately post-operatively, there was minimal neurological improvement. Our patient\u2019s pain ameliorated but flaccid paraplegia persisted and he was doubly incontinent. His post-operative radiology is depicted in Figure 3.

[Table\u00a0 1] lists all reported cases of medication-associated spontaneous intradural hemorrhage. ese were primarily older patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. While not exhaustively listed in each report referenced, vascular disease risk factors feature prominently. BruceBrand et al. (2013)[3] postulated that the vascular spinal subarachnoid space is a potential site for spontaneous blood vessel rupture, perhaps precipitated by sudden rises in intraabdominal or intra-thoracic pressures. Bleeding would then rupture the subarachnoid mater to involve the subdural compartment. Another theory postulated is that internal dural vessels rupture initially, and bleeding extends to involve the subarachnoid compartment.[9] Seldom is a culprit bleeding vessel identified. Involvement of the subarachnoid compartment may confer a worse prognosis, due to the neurotoxic effects of blood, and the development of arachnoid fibrosis.[3] It is unclear what proportion of these hemorrhages are monocompartmental and multicompartmental.\nSurgical and non-surgical treatment strategies have been employed in the treatment of SIEH. e underlying derangement of coagulation should be corrected. Conservative management strategies have been reported in patients with mild or spontaneously improving neurological deficits, although this is uncommon.[9] Watchful waiting with serial radiological and neurological assessments is the cornerstone of a non-surgical approach.[7] Surgical treatment involves decompression with a regional laminectomy, durotomy, and careful evacuation of the hematoma.[2,7] Improvement of neurological deficits post-operatively seems\nTable\u00a01: (Continued).\nStudy Age/ gender Medical history\nAnticoagulant/ antiplatelet and hematology Vertebral levels and extension Symptoms/signs Treatment Outcome\n[6] 52 F Angular vein thrombosis and suborbital abscess Unspecified oral anticoagulant At least T2-7 Abdominal paresthesia, meningismus, paraparesis, urinary, and fecal incontinence T2-7 decompression Almost complete neurological recovery after 5 months.

            "text": "Spontaneous SIEH associated with anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications, in the absence of an underlying lesion, is extremely rare. e gold standard in the assessment of spinal cord or neural compromise due to SIEH is MRI.[3,8] Hyperacute and acute blood products demonstrate signal isointensity to spinal neural elements on T1-weighted MRI.[11] Blood products during the hyperacute phase are signal hyperintense, becoming isointense, then hypointense, after the first 12\u00a0 hours (the acute phase) on T2-weighted imaging. CT is a useful initial investigation because of its comparably greater accessibility; and its utility in identifying and localizing acute SIEH, and differentiating it from adjacent lower density elements.[2] Intradural hemorrhage, regardless of the compartmentalization of bleeding, may be recognized radiologically by the \u201cinverse Mercedes-Benz sign.\u201d is is the tri-star shaped appearance of the descending and exiting neural elements of the spinal cord, limited to the thecal sac, and not extending to the intervertebral foramina, when encased in intradural hemorrhage. Extradural spinal hemorrhage comparatively appears radiologically as a broadbased biconvex lesion that displaces the spinal neural elements.\ne pathogenesis of SIEH is not well understood. Previous studies have reported a preponderance of SIEH to occur in the thoracolumbar spine without a gender predominance.[4-7,11] ere is a greater incidence among older individuals, especially those with vascular disease-associated\nSurgical Neurology International \u2022 2022 \u2022 13(235) | 7\nto be a function of the severity of myelopathy/radiculopathy incurred and the time between symptom onset and decompression.

Vascular disease risk factors including atherosclerosis, and hypertension, may be implicated in its pathogenesis.

Timely decompression confers a more favorable prognosis. More severe neurology (especially motor deficits) at presentation implies a worse recovery."
