 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Developing more robust communication protocols and architectures for cooperative and collaborative AVs to enable efficient coordination and collaboration. This could involve things like decentralized approaches, redundancy, and security.

2. Exploring the potential of using collaborative AVs for last-mile delivery. This could involve coordination of delivery robots and autonomous vehicles to enable cost-effective and efficient parcel delivery. 

3. Investigating methods for collaborative perception among AVs to enable them to build a more comprehensive model of their environment. This could allow AVs to detect objects beyond their own sensors' field of view.

4. Designing human-machine interaction methods to allow effective supervision and takeover of semi-autonomous vehicles. This is important for supervised automation levels.

5. Testing collaborative AV systems in simulated environments to evaluate their performance on metrics like efficiency, robustness and safety before real-world deployment. Simulation allows rapid iteration.
