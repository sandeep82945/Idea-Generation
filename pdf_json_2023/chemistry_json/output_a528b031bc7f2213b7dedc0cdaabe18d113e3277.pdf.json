    "abstractText": "Photocatalytic technology for inactivating bacteria in water has received much attention. In this study, we reported a dark\u2013light dual-mode sterilized g-C3N4/chitosan/poly (vinyl alcohol) hydrogel (g-CP) prepared through freeze\u2013thaw cycling and an in situ electron-beam radiation method. The structures and morphologies of g-CP were confirmed using Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), solid ultraviolet diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET). Photocatalytic degradation experiments demonstrated that 1 wt% g-CP degraded rhodamine B (RhB) up to 65.92% in 60 min. At the same time, g-CP had good antimicrobial abilities for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) within 4 h. The shapes of g-CP were adjustable (such as bar, cylinder, and cube) and had good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. The tensile and compressive modulus of 2 wt% g-CP were 0.093 MPa and 1.61 MPa, respectively. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) test and Hoechst33342/PI double staining were used to prove that g-CP had good biocompatibility. It is expected to be applied to environmental sewage treatment and wound dressing in the future.",

            "text": "The economy is growing fast, but there are still some thorny problems. Firstly, the discharge of dyes\u2019 wastewater can cause serious pollution to the environment. After light exposure, dyes will consume a large amount of oxygen in water, resulting in hypoxia and affecting the growth of aquatic organisms and microorganisms [1,2]. Secondly, overuse of antibiotics can lead to bacterial resistance. The high rates of isolating clinically resistant strains and the complex mechanisms of resistance contribute to the challenges associated with treating bacterial infections [3\u20135]. Because conventional methods do not solve the above problems well, photocatalytic technology is considered an effective method for degrading pollutants and inactivating bacteria [6\u20138]. Photocatalytic technology has the advantages of simple operation, rapid reaction, and no secondary pollution, which promotes its applications in dye degradation and bacterial inactivation [9,10]. Hydrogel consisting of a three-dimensional network structure has been applied in tissue engineering [11], drug slow release [12], antibacterial [13], and other fields. The prepa-\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7544. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28227544 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7544 2 of 16\nration methods of hydrogel include physical methods, chemical methods, and radiation methods. The physical method mainly uses hydrophobic association, hydrogen bonding, or electrostatic interaction to cross-link it, so its mechanical properties are poor [14]. Although the hydrogel prepared using chemical methods solves the above shortcomings, it needs the addition of a crosslinking agent and initiator. The toxicity of initiators and crosslinking agents can limit the application of hydrogel in biomedical fields [15]. Electron beam radiation is a green synthesis method, which mainly uses free radicals generated after water is radiated to initiate the crosslinking of polymers [16]. In addition, the hydrogel prepared through radiation has high mechanical properties and controllable shapes. Graphite-phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is an excellent photocatalytic material with simple preparation, cheap raw materials, non-toxicity, and good catalytic activity. It has a broad application prospect in energy storage, hydrogen production, nitrogen fixation, and pollutants removal [17\u201319]. Nano-sized g-C3N4 is not conducive to recovery and reuse. The typical carriers are activated carbon, ceramic, and zeolite, among which hydrogel stands out. Hydrogel has the advantages of porosity, high permeability, and easy swelling, making it an excellent biomimetic photocatalytic reactor [20\u201322]. For example, Hao et al. prepared g-C3N4 hydrogel microspheres exhibiting good photocatalytic performance by chelating calcium ions and sodium alginate [23]. Thurston et al. used sulfuric acid, glutaraldehyde, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form g-C3N4-based hydrogel exhibiting photocatalytic antibacterial properties [24]. Chitosan is widely distributed in nature and is an excellent natural polymer [25]. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCh) is one of its common derivatives. It is a good antibacterial agent [26]. At present, many studies have focused on the development of carboxymethylchitosan-based antibacterial hydrogels. Wahid [27] et al. prepared CMCS/copper oxide hydrogel, which had good swelling and antibacterial properties. Kang [28] et al. prepared vinyl carboxymethyl chitosan thermo-sensitive hydrogel for drug release. In this paper, g-C3N4/CMCh/PVA (g-CP) hydrogel was prepared through freezing\u2013 thawing and electron beam radiation, which solved the disadvantage of the poor antibacterial ability of g-C3N4 in the dark. The structures and properties of g-CP were investigated using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and solid ultraviolet visible diffuse reflection (UV-vis DRS). The photocatalytic degradation of RhB by 1 wt% g-CP was 65.92% in 60 min. g-CP had good antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). In addition, this hydrogel had good biocompatibility. Most importantly, g-CP had good mechanical properties and shape controllabilities (such as strip, cylinder, and cube), thus expanding its application range in environmental and biomedical fields."

The absorption peak at 1647.6 cm\u22121 corresponded to the superposition of the C=C stretching vibration and the hydroxyl group deformation vibration peaks in RHC=CH2. The absorption peak at 1144 cm\u22121 was contributed by the C-C-C stretching vibration of PVA. The absorption peak at 837.3 cm\u22121 corresponded to the C=C stretching vibration at the end of the vinyl [29]. The absorption peaks at 1582 cm\u22121, 1409 cm\u22121, 1310 cm\u22121, and 1053 cm\u22121 corresponded to the symmetric stretching vibration and asymmetric stretching vibration of the carboxymethyl of CMCh, and the stretching vibration of C-N and C-O bonds, respectively [30]. In the spectrum of g-C3N4, the absorption peak at 810 cm\u22121 corresponded to the out-of-plane bending mode of heterocyclic C-N, and the stretching vibrational peaks of aromatic C-N were at 1200\u20131600 cm\u22121 [31].

The diffraction peak at 13.1\u00b0 and 27.4\u00b0 corresponded to the (100) and (002) crystal\nplane of g-C3N4. Diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 in composite hydrogel were covered by PVA.\nThe reason for this phenomenon might be the low content of g-C3N4 in the composite hy-\ndrogel or the weak crystallinity [33].\n2.3. UV-Vis Analysis\nFigure 1c,d showed the UV-Vis spectra and band gap diagrams of the samples, re-\nspectively. The optical absorption wavelength of g-C3N4 was about 414.7 nm and the band\ngap width was 2.98 eV. The optical absorption wavelengths of PVA and PVA/CMCh were\nlarger compared to g-C3N4. Therefore, when g-C3N4 was loaded in PVA/CMCh hydrogel,\nits absorption wavelength was redshifted. At the same time, the band gap width of 2 wt%\ng-CP narrowed to 1.65 eV, which promoted its absorption in visible light.\n2.4.

The pseudo-first-order kinetic model and pseudosecond-order kinetic model of Lagergren [37] were used to analyze the adsorption rate data.

As shown in Figure 7a, the maximum adsorption capacities of PVA, CMCh/PVA, and g-CP hydrogels were 8.23 mg g\u22121, 10.9 mg g\u22121, and 11.69 mg g\u22121, respectively (C0 = 50 mg L\u22121, V = 50 mL, m = 0.5 g, T = 298 K). All the hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium within 80 min. g-CP had the highest adsorption capacity probably related to the increase in specific surface area. According to the dynamic fitting curves and correlation coefficients (Table 2), the R2 of the quasi-second-order dynamic model was larger than that of the quasi-first-order dynamic model (Figure 7 b,c). The results of quasi-second-order fitting were more consistent with the experiments. Therefore, the adsorption process of gCP on RhB showed chemisorption [38]. Of course, this might also be caused by the physical adsorption expansion of hydrogel [39]. As shown in Figure 7d\u2013h, the degradation rates of RhB by 1\u20135 wt% g-CP were 65.92%, 56.83%, 51.18%, 49.78%, and 47.74%, respectively. Among them, 1 wt% g-CP showed the highest degradation rate. The possible reason was that when the masses of g-C3N4 were the same, the content of 1 wt% g-CP was the largest. Therefore, the existence of hydrogel increased the adsorption capacity and improved the catalytic efficiency. In order to study the involvement of reactive species in the photocatalytic reaction process, p-benzoquinone (BQ), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na), and isopropanol (IPA) were, respectively, introduced as the scavengers of superoxide radicals (\u2022O2\u2212), holes (h+), and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) to examine the effects of reactive species on the photocatalytic degradation of RhB. From Figure 7i, the BQ and EDTA-2Na led to an obvious suppression of the degradation efficiency of RhB. However, the IPA had little impact on the degradation efficiency. The results indicated that \u2022O2\u2212 and h+ played a major role in the degradation of RhB."

            "text": "The mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of g-CP was the decomposition of RhB into carbon dioxide and water by active species such as superoxide radicals (O2\u2212\u2022) and holes (h+) generated by g-C3N4. The good antibacterial properties of g-CP were mainly classified into the following two aspects. Firstly, the physical antibacterial effect: the positive charge (amino group) in the CMCh molecule interacted with the negative charge on the surfa e of bacteria, which led to leakage of bacterial proteins and other components, t us achieving the antib cterial effect [44]. S condly, the photocatalytic antibacterial effect: Under sunlight, g-C3N4 in g-CP would produce free radicals, which would further react with O2 to form ROS. ROS reacted with phospholipids of the bacterial membrane, which led to membrane destruction and interfered with the normal metabolism of cells, thus achieving the bactericidal effect [45]."

The photoreactor consisted of a quartz cold trap reactor, a stirring device, and a light source (500 W Xenon lamp). PVA, PVA/CMCh, and g-CP of different masses of g-C3N4 (1 g 1 wt% g-CP, 0.5 g 2 wt% g-CP, 0.33 g 3 wt% g-CP, 0.25 g 4 wt% g-CP, 0.20 g 5 wt% g-CP) were mixed with 50 mL of RhB (4 mg L\u22121). The suspension was stirred in the dark for 80 min in order to obtain absorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. After the dark reaction, the Xenon lamp was turned on and 4 mL suspension was centrifuged at regular intervals. An ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrophotometer was used to detect the absorbance of supernatant at 554 nm.\n3.4.2. Zone of Inhibition Test\nThe hydrogels were immersed in deionized water to remove uncross-linked components and sterilized under UV light for 30 min. The OD value of E. coli (or S. aureus) was measured using an enzyme-labeled instrument at a wavelength of 600 nm (0.1 OD = 1 \u00d7 108 CFU mL\u22121). The 0.1 mL suspension of the bacterial solution (1 \u00d7 106 CFU mL\u22121) was evenly spread in LB Petri dish. Then, PVA, CMCh/PVA, and g-CP hydrogels with a diameter of 1 cm were placed above the medium. The bacteriostatic properties of the hydrogels were observed after 24 h.\n3.4.3. Photocatalytic Antibacterial Experiment\nFirstly, 1 g of g-CP materials with different mass fractions was weighed and sterilized under a UV lamp. Then, 50 mL of E. coli suspension (1 \u00d7 106 CFU mL\u22121) was added. A Xenon lamp at 500 W was used to simulate sunlight. The dark reaction was carried out for 80 min. Then, 0.1 mL of the bacterial solution was evenly spread on LB medium every 30 min during the light reaction stage and incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 24 h. Finally, an automated colony counter was used to count the number of colonies. The steps of photocatalytic antimicrobial experiments of hydrogels against S. aureus were the same as above.\n3.4.4. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Test\nMouse fibroblasts (L-929) were derived from Wuhan Punosai Life Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China. They were cultured in 5% CO2, 37 \u25e6C incubators using a 90% DMEM high-glucose medium. First, 1 g of materials was soaked in 10 mL of medium for 24 h to obtain their extracts. The adherent cells were digested with 2\u20133 mL of 0.25% trypsin for 1\u20132 min. After termination of digestion, the cell suspension was counted and diluted (1 \u00d7 105 mL\u22121), and the cells were inoculated into 96-well culture plates. The cells were cultured overnight, and the hydrogel extracts were added. After 24 h of incubation, 10% CCK-8 enhancement solution was added and OD values were measured five times at 450 nm.\n3.4.5. Live and Dead Cell Staining Experiment\nCell viabilities were evaluated by using the Hoechst33342/Propidium lodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit. First, L-929 cells (1 \u00d7 105 mL\u22121) were inoculated in 6-well plates and cultured overnight. The hydrogel extracts and cells were co-cultured for 24 h and washed twice using PBS buffer. Then, Hoechst33342 (10 mg L\u22121) solution was added and the cells were incubated in an incubator for 10 min. After the cells were washed twice with PBS, PI solution (10 mg L\u22121) was added and co-cultured for 20 min. After washing with PBS, blue and red fluorescence were detected at 400\u2013500 nm and >630 nm, respectively."

Adsorption\u2013degradation experiments showed\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7544 14 of 16\nthat 1 wt% g-CP degraded RhB up to 65.92% in 60 min. The zone of inhibition and photocatalytic antimicrobial experiments proved that g-CP had a good dark\u2013light dual-mode antibacterial effect on E. coli and S. aureus. At the same time, the cytotoxicity test proved that 2 wt% g-CP had good biocompatibility. More remarkably, 2 wt% g-CP had good mechanical properties (tensile and compressive moduli of 0.093 MPa and 1.61 MPa, respectively) and deformation recovery properties, which expands its applications in catalysis, engineering, and biomedical fields.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.L.; methodology, J.-Y.Y. and D.-X.T.; investigation, K.L.; resources, D.-L.L.; data curation, D.-L.L. and D.-X.T.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.-Y.Y.; writing\u2014review and editing, X.-J.Y.; visualization, D.-L.L. and Y.-S.L.; supervision, Y.L. and X.-J.Y.; funding acquisition, Y.-S.L.
